Further genera were identified, at first on an annual basis, as time progressed. Since its publication in 1931, Eisenack's <b>original</b> <b>classification</b> has been much honed by these additional discoveries, as well as advances in microscopy. The advent of the scanning electron microscope in the 1970s allowed the improved detection of surface ornamentation which is hugely important in identification - as can be appreciated by {{a comparison of the}} images on this page. Even the light microscope image here is of far greater quality than could have been achieved earlier in the century, using poorly preserved specimens and less advanced microscopes.|$|E

500|$|The common name, [...] "green {{and golden}} bell frog", was first adopted by Harold Cogger in his 1975 book Reptiles and Amphibians of Australia. Before this, its common names were [...] "golden frog" [...] and [...] "golden tree frog". The green and golden bell frog has many {{physical}} and behavioural characteristics representative of ranids, hence its <b>original</b> <b>classification</b> as Rana. It has a pointy snout, long legs, and almost complete toe webbing; the tympanum {{is large and}} distinct; and the overall body shape is similar to many Rana species. Like many frogs in the Rana genus, green and golden bell frogs are mostly aquatic, and only travel over land during periods of rainfall.

The bone and cartilage structural formations of the green and golden bell frog are closest to those of species in the family Hylidae; it was therefore reclassified.|$|E
500|$|The {{discovery}} of specimens with upright crests, classified by Harksen in 1966 {{as the new}} species Pteranodon sternbergi, complicated the situation even further, prompting other revision of the genus by Miller in 1972. Because {{it was impossible to}} determine crest shape for all of the species based on headless skeletons, Miller concluded that all Pteranodon species except the two based on skulls (P. longiceps and P. sternbergi) must be considered nomena dubia and abandoned. The skull Eaton thought belonged to P. ingens was placed in the new species Pteranodon marshi, and the skull Eaton assigned to P. occidentalis was re-named Pteranodon eatoni. Miller also recognized another species based on a skull with a crest similar to that of P. sternbergi; Miller named this Pteranodon walkeri. To help bring order to this tangle of names, Miller created three categories or [...] "subgenera" [...] for them. P. marshi and P. longiceps were placed in the subgenus Longicepia, though this was later changed to simply Pteranodon due to the rules of priority. P. sternbergi and P. walkeri, the upright-crested species, were given the subgenus Sternbergia, which was later changed to Geosternbergia because Sternbergia was already in use ("preoccupied"). Finally, Miller named the subgenus Occidentalia for P. eatoni, the skull formerly associated with P. occidentalis. Miller further expanded the concept of Pteranodon to include Nyctosaurus as a fourth subgenus. Miller considered these to be an evolutionary progression, with the primitive Nyctosaurus, at the time thought to be crestless, giving rise to Occidentalia (with a small crest), which in turn gave rise to Pteranodon with its long backwards crest, finally leading to Geosternbergia with its large, upright crest. However, Miller made several mistakes in his study concerning which specimens Marsh had assigned to which species, and most scientists disregarded his work on the subject in their later research, though Wellnhofer (1978) followed Miller's species list. and Schoch (1984) somewhat oddly published another revision that essentially returned to Marsh's <b>original</b> <b>classification</b> scheme, most notably sinking P. longiceps as a synonym of P. ingens.|$|E
500|$|On August 23, a {{moderate}} tropical storm developed 200 miles (323km) east of Sint Maarten. Operationally, {{the system was}} treated as an easterly wave until it moved through the Bahamas. It is believed that the system originated near the Cape Verde islands. On August 24, the tropical storm passed north of the Leeward Islands and San Juan, Puerto Rico, and then strengthened to a minimal hurricane with 75mph (120km/h) winds on August 25. Subsequently, it strengthened rapidly, and the cyclone was noted as [...] "well developed" [...] when it passed near Nassau with 115mph (185km/h) winds {{on the morning of}} August 26. At the time, it was the equivalent of a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. The storm strengthened further over the Gulf Stream, and it moved ashore over the city of West Palm Beach as a strong Category 4 hurricane around 7:20 p.m. EDT. The city's airport reported calm conditions from 7:20–7:40 p.m., and the minimum central pressure of 954 mbar (28.18 inHg) was measured at the site. Peak gusts were recorded at 125mph (205km/h) before the anemometer blew away. A maximum sustained wind of 153mph (246km/h) was reported from the Jupiter Inlet Light station prior to the loss of the anemometer; although conditions were slightly more severe after the reading, reliable estimates are unavailable. The Atlantic hurricane database lists the cyclone as a strong Category 4 hurricane at landfall. The wind reading is the basis for the Category 4 designation in the Atlantic hurricane database, although a reduction from the anemometer's elevated location lends credence to the concept of a weaker system. Originally, the system was designated as a Category 3 hurricane in the state of Florida, based on the minimum central pressure reading of 954 mbar (28.18 inHg); this pressure corresponds to the <b>original</b> <b>classification</b> of a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. However, modern analysis applies Saffir-Simpson rankings based on maximum sustained wind speeds. The 1949 Florida hurricane will be eventually reanalyzed by the Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project, which may find a weaker hurricane in Florida. The central pressure of 954 mbar (28.18 inHg) is unusually high for a strong Category 4 hurricane; the reanalysis project has discovered that hurricanes erroneously featured stronger winds than the typical pressure/wind relationship in the 1940s–1960s, unlike subsequent hurricanes in the 1970s–1980s. The evidence suggests wind speeds may have been overestimated for hurricanes in the 1940s–1960s.|$|E

2500|$|The {{species was}} first scientifically {{described}} by the famed French naturalist Georges Cuvier in 1833 based on specimens collected off Waigio, Indonesia; {{one of which was}} designated to be the holotype. He named the species Caranx melampygus, placing the species in the jack genus Caranx which had been established by Bernard Lacépède three decades previously. The name's specific epithet is derived from the Latin translation of [...] "black spotted". This is still currently considered the correct placement, however later authors placed in other now defunct genera (Carangus and Carangichthys) which has since been deemed incorrect, and the <b>original</b> <b>classification</b> stands. The species was independently redescribed and named seven times after Cuvier's initial description, with all of these names assigned between 1836 and 1895. The names C. bixanthopterus and C. stellatus were often used in the literature, and were variably classed as synonyms of C. melampygus or valid individual species after their naming. This confusion culminated in Yojiro Wakiya concluding in 1924 they should be treated as separate species. The taxonomy of the species was finally revised by Frederick Berry in 1965, who resolved these two names as being synonymous with C. melampygus, and placed several other names in synonymy with C. melampygus. Under ICZN nomenclature rules, these later names are deemed junior synonyms of C. melampygus and rendered invalid. The species has not been included in any detailed phylogenetic studies of the Carangidae.|$|E
