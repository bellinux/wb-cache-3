5|$|After passing slower cars, Vettel {{began to}} resume his battle with the Ferrari drivers. Button made a pit stop on lap 22 and reemerged in fifth {{position}} behind his teammate Hamilton. The Ferrari cars began to set faster lap times {{than the rest of}} the field as Massa started to pull away from Alonso and held a lead of three seconds over his teammate. Alonso responded to Massa's newfound pace by recording a new fastest lap of the race, a 1:18.075 on lap 28, having backed out to see how fast his car was in clean air, before the two drivers began to trade fastest times over the next three laps. Webber attempted to place pressure <b>on</b> <b>Button</b> in a battle for fifth place, although Button was using a defensive strategy by using his McLaren's straight-line speed advantage. De La Rosa caught up to Hülkenberg and passed him at the turn six hairpin on lap 35. Three laps later, Hamilton was instructed by McLaren to conserve fuel usage in the event they could use an aggressive fuel saving mode towards the end of the race.|$|E
25|$|In {{the mid-1970s}} the first calculators {{appeared}} with field-effect, twisted nematic (TN) LCDs with dark numerals against a grey background, though the early ones often had a yellow filter over them {{to cut out}} damaging ultraviolet rays. The advantage of LCDs {{is that they are}} passive light modulators reflecting light, which require much less power than light-emitting displays such as LEDs or VFDs. This led the way to the first credit-card-sized calculators, such as the Casio Mini Card LC-78 of 1978, which could run for months of normal use <b>on</b> <b>button</b> cells.|$|E
25|$|At Spa, he {{qualified}} 4th, but {{suffered from}} anti-stall {{for the third}} time in 2009 and he found himself last, but missed the first lap crash which took out four drivers including teammate Button. While the safety car was out he pitted and changed strategy which enabled him to climb back up to 7th. During the last three laps the car had an engine oil leak, but he still managed to finish, before his car caught fire in the pit lane after the race. At Monza, he qualified 5th, despite carrying more fuel to try a different strategy with only one stop. After passing Kovalainen at the start, Barrichello managed not to lose too much time, as he had the advantage of just one stop against Hamilton, Räikkönen and Sutil's two stop strategy. By Hamilton's second pit stop, Button and Barrichello were running first and second. Hamilton tried to pressure Button by forcing his car, but on the last lap he crashed, giving third place to Räikkönen, and fourth to Sutil. Barrichello won the 11th race in his Formula One career, and gained more points <b>on</b> <b>Button</b> in their fight for the world title.|$|E

Superstitious responding, <b>on</b> the second <b>button,</b> was often maintained because presses <b>on</b> that <b>button</b> were frequently followed by reinforcement for a subsequent press <b>on</b> the first <b>button.</b> The introduction of a changeover delay (COD), which separated in time presses <b>on</b> the second <b>button</b> and subsequent reinforced presses <b>on</b> the first <b>button,</b> reduced or eliminated the superstitious responding of these subjects.

500|$|The {{stewards}} did {{not impose}} a penalty <b>on</b> <b>Button</b> for his collisions with Hamilton and Alonso, having judged that no driver {{was to blame}} in either incident.

2500|$|His bad run {{continued}} in Valencia; he was out-qualified by his teammate, and then, held up behind Webber {{for a lot}} of the race, could finish only in seventh place. Barrichello pushed on to win the race, and close the gap <b>on</b> <b>Button</b> to 18 points. Martin Brundle felt that Button was struggling with the pressure of leading the world championship, writing: [...] "He has tightened up in the car and his natural instincts behind the wheel are being restricted." [...] The following race at Spa-Francorchamps, Button had his first retirement of the season after a collision with Romain Grosjean during the first lap. This meant Button had scored only 11 points from his previous five races, and with five races left his lead was down to 16 points over Barrichello, and 19 and 20.5 over Vettel and Webber respectively.|$|E
