5|$|In PC Magazine testing, Norton removed most {{traces of}} 40 {{percent of the}} malware. On a similar test, {{specifically}} using commercial keyloggers, Norton was able to remove most of the keyloggers, beating other tested products. Norton blocked all attempts to install malware <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>clean</b> system. Modifications made to the samples did not fool Norton.

5|$|The {{installation}} {{was noted}} as lengthy by PC Magazine, especially on malware-infected systems. Spyware detection has been tweaked {{since the last}} release. It has been updated to better identify keyloggers. In PC Magazine testing, Norton successfully detected all 11 spyware threats and removed all but two. PC Magazine did give Norton credit even when manual removal was required. The suite also removed three of four commercial keyloggers. When attempting to install the spyware <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>clean</b> system, Norton blocked all 11 {{and two of the}} four commercial keyloggers. In most cases, it did not block the installation, however Norton did call for a scan after the spyware was installed. In PC Pro testing, Norton detected 78 percent of spyware, removed 82 percent, and blocked 65 percent from installing.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this work, {{infrared}} thermography was {{employed as a}} monitoring technique during water capillary rise tests <b>on</b> <b>a</b> choice of porous stones in the laboratory, {{as well as in}} situ <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>cleaned</b> porous stone surface of a historic building. While the emissivity values of the investigated materials were considered for the thermographic survey, other investigative techniques, such as mercury intrusion porosimetry and water sorption analysis for studying the stone in terms of their microstructure and isothermic behaviour respectively, were additionally used for the laboratory investigation on quarry samples. Results, such as water absorption coefficient and percentage, total porosity and isothermic behaviour were presented and discussed, in an attempt to explain the thermal images from the capillary rise tests. Furthermore, correlation between the thermal contrast and the imbibed water percentage for each sample obtained from the capillary rise tests was also presented in an attempt to show how powerful the action of water inside a porous stone is. Lastly, an in field thermographic survey <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>cleaned</b> historic stone surface, using a wet micro blasting method, was also carried out. Representative samples were collected from the investigated surface with the intention of studying their microstructure by means of mercury intrusion porosimetry and water sorption analysis...|$|R
5|$|Most of the {{physical}} properties of astatine have been estimated (by interpolation or extrapolation), using theoretically or empirically derived methods. For example, halogens get darker with increasing atomic weight– fluorine is nearly colorless, chlorine is yellow-green, bromine is red-brown, and iodine is dark gray/violet. Astatine is sometimes described as probably being a black solid (assuming it follows this trend), or as having a metallic appearance (if it is a metalloid or a metal). The melting and boiling points of astatine are also expected to follow the trend seen in the halogen series, increasing with atomic number. On this basis they {{are estimated to be}} , respectively. Some experimental evidence suggests astatine may have lower melting and boiling points than those implied by the halogen trend. Astatine sublimes less readily than does iodine, having a lower vapor pressure. Even so, half of a given quantity of astatine will vaporize in approximately an hour if put <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>clean</b> glass surface at room temperature. The absorption spectrum of astatine in the middle ultraviolet region has lines at 224.401 and 216.225nm, suggestive of 6p to 7s transitions.|$|E
5|$|Neil Rubenking of PC Magazine {{successfully}} {{installed the}} beta version on 12 malware-infected systems and commented on its small installation package (about 7 MB, {{depending on the}} operating system) and speedy installation. But the initial virus definition update took between 5 and 15 minutes, and the full installation occupied about 110 MB of disk space. Rubenking noted that the beta version sets Windows Update into fully automatic mode, although it can be turned off again through Windows Control Panel. Some full scans took {{more than an hour}} on infected systems; a scan <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>clean</b> system took 35 minutes. An on-demand scan test Rubenking conducted in June 2009 with the beta version found 89 percent of all malware samples: 30 percent of the commercial keyloggers, 67 percent of rootkits, but only half of the scareware samples. The product's real-time protection found 83 percent of all malware and blocked the majority of it: 40 percent of the commercial keyloggers and 78 percent of the rootkits were found.|$|E

25|$|It is {{important}} to remember that the builders were not working <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>clean</b> site but would have had to clear back the rubble and surviving parts of the old church as they built the new. Nevertheless, work progressed rapidly. The south porch with most of its sculpture was installed by 1210, and by 1215 the north porch had been completed and the western rose installed. The nave high vaults were erected in the 1220s, the canons moved into their new stalls in 1221 under a temporary roof at the level of the clerestory, and the transept roses were erected over the subsequent two decades. The high vaults over the choir were not built until the last years of the 1250s, as was rediscovered in the first decade of the 21st century.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the safest}} and easiest ways to clean {{textiles}} is to vacuum them. [...] The fabric is placed <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>clean,</b> flat work surface.

[...] The screen allows dirt and dust to pass through, but prevents individual threads from being pulled loose or unravelled further by the suction. [...] Using a vacuum attachment and the lowest power setting, move the suction over the screen until the entire area has been cleaned. [...] If needed, move the screen to a new area and begin again. [...] Always remember to vacuum {{both sides of the}} textile, as dirt may filter through to the other side. [...] Hanging textiles will need to be vacuumed less often than horizontal pieces, as there are fewer places where dust can collect.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the {{presence}} of any extended foreground correlated regions in <b>a</b> <b>cleaned</b> CMB map. To estimate the cosmological parameters of interest, it is cus-tomary to employ <b>a</b> galactic mask <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>cleaned</b> map to omit the galactic region which remain contaminated even after cleaning. This study shows that there are residual foreground correlations present even outside a galactic mask, which could potentially be responsible {{for some of the}} large scale anomalies found in CMB. Here, we defined two correlation statistics, one in pixel space and the other in multipole space. Pixel correlation statistic was used to convey a pictorial impression of the level of resid-ual foregrounds present in <b>a</b> <b>cleaned</b> map, while the multipole correlation statistic was used to identify any polluted multipoles. Using the pixel statistic, we find that there are notable spatially-extended, foreground-correlated features in the estimated CMB map. One interesting feature we found is that, the anomalous CMB cold spot region in the southern galactic hemisphere is highly correlated with synchrotron emis-sion templates. Using the multipole statistic, we find that the CMB quadrupole is contaminated by synchrotron. Key words:...|$|R

2500|$|Equilibrium {{of forces}} on the surface is {{required}} for a bubble to exist. The sum of the Ambient pressure and pressure due to tissue distortion, exerted {{on the outside of}} the surface, with surface tension of the liquid at the interface between the bubble and the surroundings must be balanced by the pressure on the inside of the bubble. This is the sum of the partial pressures of the gases inside due to the net diffusion of gas to and from the bubble. The force balance on the bubble may be modified by a layer of surface active molecules which can stabilise a microbubble at a size where surface tension <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>clean</b> bubble would cause it to collapse rapidly, and this surface layer may vary in permeability, so that if the bubble is sufficiently compressed it may become impermeable to diffusion. If the solvent outside the bubble is saturated or unsaturated, the partial pressure will be less than in the bubble, and the surface tension will be increasing the internal pressure in direct proportion to surface curvature, providing a pressure gradient to increase diffusion out of the bubble, effectively [...] "squeezing the gas out of the bubble", and the smaller the bubble the faster it will get squeezed out. A gas bubble can only grow at constant pressure if the surrounding solvent is sufficiently supersaturated to overcome the surface tension or if the surface layer provides sufficient reaction to overcome surface tension. Clean bubbles that are sufficiently small will collapse due to surface tension if the supersaturation is low. Bubbles with semipermeable surfaces will either stabilise at a specific radius depending on the pressure, the composition of the surface layer, and the supersaturation, or continue to grow indefinitely, if larger than the critical radius. Bubble formation can occur in the blood or other tissues.|$|E
