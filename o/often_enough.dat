5|$|The lower esophageal sphincter, or {{gastroesophageal}} sphincter, {{surrounds the}} lower part of the esophagus at the junction between the esophagus and the stomach. It is also called the cardiac sphincter or cardioesophageal sphincter, named from the adjacent part of the stomach, the cardia. Dysfunction of the gastroesophageal sphincter causes gastroesophageal , which causes heartburn and if it happens <b>often</b> <b>enough,</b> can lead to gastroesophageal reflux disease, with damage of the esophageal mucosa.|$|E
5|$|After {{the split}} with the Bahá'ís, some Azalis were {{very active in}} secular reform {{movements}} and the Iranian Constitutional Revolution (19051907), including Shaykh Ahmad Ruhi Kermani and Mirza Abd-al-Hosayn Kermani. However, the community was still suppressed as a heresy and the accusation of being an Azali was <b>often</b> <b>enough</b> for most to {{believe it to be}} true. Coupled with the Azali practice of taqiyya (dissimulation) determining whether or not a particular figure in Persian politics was an Azali is difficult.|$|E

50|$|All impedance, currents, {{voltages}} and two-port parameters will {{be assumed}} to be purely real. For practical applications, this assumption is <b>often</b> close <b>enough.</b>|$|R
5|$|As already described, chiral liquid-crystal {{molecules}} usually {{give rise}} to chiral mesophases. This means that the molecule must possess some form of asymmetry, usually a stereogenic center. An additional requirement is that the system not be racemic: a mixture of right- and left-handed molecules will cancel the chiral effect. Due to the cooperative nature of liquid crystal ordering, however, {{a small amount of}} chiral dopant in an otherwise achiral mesophase is <b>often</b> <b>enough</b> to select out one domain handedness, making the system overall chiral.|$|E
5|$|Progress is {{punctuated by}} cutscenes and codec, {{as well as}} {{encounters}} with bosses. To progress, players must discover the weaknesses of each boss and defeat them. Play controls and strategies can also be accessed via the Codec radio, where advice is delivered from Snake's support team; for example, the support team may chastise Snake for not saving his progress <b>often</b> <b>enough,</b> or explain his combat moves in terms of which buttons to press on the gamepad. The Codec {{is also used to}} provide exposition on the game's backstory.|$|E
5|$|The feud between Razor Ramon and Shawn Michaels also dated back to {{the fall}} of 1993. Jack Tunney {{announced}} that he was stripping Michaels of the WWF Intercontinental Championship for not defending the title <b>often</b> <b>enough.</b> There have been reports that the real reason for vacating the title was because Michaels refused to drop the belt. Ramon won the title after competing in a battle royal and defeating Rick Martel, the other finalist in the match. In the angle, Michaels refused to acknowledge the title change, however, as he insisted that he was the true Intercontinental Champion. To gain revenge against Ramon for taking the belt, Michaels attacked Ramon and helped Irwin R. Schyster to steal Ramon's gold chains.|$|E
30|$|Experiments {{change on}} weekly basis: {{these changes are}} <b>often</b> {{profound}} <b>enough</b> that adapting the veto/trigger parameters and algorithms to each experiment would represent a huge effort.|$|R

5|$|The {{roughness}} of {{this version}} succeeded {{in a way}} the recorded version on 'Emotions' could never manage. In the sterile atmosphere of a studio, where perfection, technology, and overdubbing were the rules, spontaneity had no place. On the stage, it was valued, and this performance had it. Everyone pushed everyone just a little further, to create something wonderful, and judging by the response, the audience realized it, as did Mariah when the song was finished. It was a rare moment, one that true performers strive for and don't find <b>often</b> <b>enough</b> to satisfy themselves.|$|E
5|$|On 18 July, Casares Quiroga refused {{an offer}} of help from the CNT and UGT, proclaiming that nowhere outside Spanish Morocco had joined the rebels and that the populace should trust legal methods {{to deal with the}} uprising. Handing out weapons would be illegal. The CNT and UGT proclaimed a general strike, in effect mobilising. They opened weapons caches, some buried since the 1934 risings. The {{paramilitary}} forces, better trained than the army, often waited to see the outcome of militia action before either joining or suppressing the rebellion. Quick action by either the rebels or anarchist militias was <b>often</b> <b>enough</b> to decide the fate of a town. General Queipo de Llano managed to secure Seville for the rebels, arresting a number of other officers.|$|E
25|$|Class: Class {{traits are}} {{specific}} to a certain class. These are generally earned by using a class skill or power <b>often</b> <b>enough,</b> or meeting certain conditions with these skills <b>often</b> <b>enough,</b> such as achieving enough critical strikes with a certain skill. These skills improve the power of certain abilities and often give an additional passive bonus to character statistics.|$|E
5|$|Like other lanthanides, many isotopes, {{especially}} isotopes with odd mass {{numbers and}} neutron-poor isotopes like 152Eu, have high cross sections for neutron capture, <b>often</b> high <b>enough</b> to be neutron poisons.|$|R
50|$|Landmines <b>often</b> contain <b>enough</b> {{ferrous metal}} to be {{detectable}} with appropriate magnetic sensors. Sophisticated mines, however, may also sense a metal-detection oscillator, and, under preprogrammed conditions, detonate to deter demining personnel.|$|R

25|$|Dandruff {{can have}} several causes, {{including}} dry skin, seborrhoeic dermatitis, not cleaning/scrubbing <b>often</b> <b>enough,</b> shampooing too often, psoriasis, eczema, sensitivity to hair care products, or a yeast-like fungus. Dry skin {{is the most}} common cause of flaking dandruff.|$|E
25|$|The {{distribution}} of the n-th digit, as n increases, rapidly approaches a uniform distribution with 10% {{for each of the}} ten digits, as shown below. Four digits is <b>often</b> <b>enough</b> to assume a uniform {{distribution of}} 10% as '0' appears 10.0176% of the time in the fourth digit while '9' appears 9.9824% of the time.|$|E
25|$|IE 6 {{launched}} more swiftly than Firefox 1.5 on Windows XP {{since many}} of its components were built into the OS and loaded during system startup. As a workaround for the issue, a preloader application was created that loaded components of Firefox on startup, similar to Internet Explorer. A Windows Vista feature called SuperFetch performs a similar task of preloading Firefox if it is used <b>often</b> <b>enough.</b>|$|E

50|$|Nations <b>often</b> {{stockpile}} <b>enough</b> {{tanks to}} respond to any threat without having to make more tanks as many sophisticated designs can only be produced at a relatively low rate. The US for instance keeps 6,000 MBTs in storage.|$|R
25|$|Some special integrands occur <b>often</b> <b>enough</b> {{to warrant}} special study. In particular, {{it may be}} useful to have, in the set of antiderivatives, the special {{functions}} (like the Legendre functions, the hypergeometric function, the gamma function, the incomplete gamma function and so on— see Symbolic integration for more details). Extending the Risch's algorithm to include such functions is possible but challenging and has been an active research subject.|$|E
25|$|Tinamous are avid bathers. During {{heavy rain}} they may stand erect with their bill {{pointing}} skyward allowing the rain to wash over them. They will dust-bathe at regular intervals, {{and have been}} known to dust-bathe <b>often</b> <b>enough</b> to tint themselves the same color as the soil. They also sunbathe, and will do so while resting on one leg with an outstretched wing. Defecation for a tinamou is a slightly involved task as it must move aside the dense plumage that surrounds the cloaca to avoid soiling itself. Captive tinamous defecate once daily.|$|E
25|$|More recently, {{democracy}} is criticised for not offering enough political stability. As governments are frequently elected {{on and off}} there tends to be frequent changes in the policies of democratic countries both domestically and internationally. Even if a political party maintains power, vociferous, headline grabbing protests and harsh criticism from the popular media are <b>often</b> <b>enough</b> to force sudden, unexpected political change. Frequent policy changes with regard to business and immigration are likely to deter investment and so hinder economic growth. For this reason, many people have put forward the idea that {{democracy is}} undesirable for a developing country in which economic growth and the reduction of poverty are top priorities.|$|E
50|$|Load is <b>often</b> large <b>enough</b> to {{influence}} the market outcome by varying the quantity they bid into the DA market. Virtual bidding mitigates this power by allowing other market participants to simply bid in the load that was under-scheduled.|$|R
50|$|An {{antibiogram}} is {{the result}} of an antibiotic sensitivity test. It is by definition an in vitro sensitivity, but the correlation of in vitro to in vivo sensitivity is <b>often</b> high <b>enough</b> for the test to be clinically useful.|$|R
50|$|These two {{symptoms}} are <b>often</b> severe <b>enough</b> to seriously disable an individual; among 36 people with Costeff syndrome, 17 experienced major motor disability {{as a result}} of choreoathetosis, and 12 experienced spasticity-related symptoms severe enough to do the same.|$|R
25|$|Prevention is {{by early}} {{diagnosis}} of the disease followed by keeping the person from putting the wound in drinking water to decrease spread of the parasite. Other efforts include improving access to clean water and otherwise filtering water {{if it is not}} clean. Filtering through a cloth is <b>often</b> <b>enough.</b> Contaminated drinking water may be treated with a chemical called temefos to kill the larva. There is no medication or vaccine against the disease. The worm may be slowly removed over a few weeks by rolling it over a stick. The ulcers formed by the emerging worm may get infected by bacteria. Pain may continue for months after the worm has been removed.|$|E
25|$|Snow falls {{intermittently}} and mainly affects {{northern and}} eastern areas, high ground in Wales {{and especially the}} mountains of Scotland, where there is <b>often</b> <b>enough</b> snow lying to permit skiing {{at some of the}} five Scottish ski resorts. These resorts usually operate between December and April, depending on the snowfall. Frequently in the mountains potent depressions may move in from the north in the form of 'polar lows', introducing heavy snow and often blizzard-like conditions to parts of the United Kingdom, particularly Scotland. Blizzards have become rarer in the 21st century, although much of England was affected by one on 30 January 2003. During periods of light winds and high pressure frost and fog can become a problem and can pose a major hazard for drivers on the roads.|$|E
25|$|Ubuntu {{packages}} {{are based on}} packages from Debian's unstable branch. Both distributions use Debian's deb package format and package management tools (e.g. APT and Ubuntu Software). Debian and Ubuntu {{packages are}} not necessarily binary compatible with each other, however; packages {{may need to be}} rebuilt from source to be used in Ubuntu. Many Ubuntu developers are also maintainers of key packages within Debian. Ubuntu cooperates with Debian by pushing changes back to Debian, although there has been criticism that this does not happen <b>often</b> <b>enough.</b> Ian Murdock, the founder of Debian, had expressed concern about Ubuntu packages potentially diverging too far from Debian to remain compatible. Before release, packages are imported from Debian unstable continuously and merged with Ubuntu-specific modifications. One month before release, imports are frozen, and packagers then work to ensure that the frozen features interoperate well together.|$|E
