After considerable study, the RCAF selected a dramatically more powerful design, and serious development began in March 1955. The aircraft was intended to be built directly from the production line, skipping the traditional hand-built prototype phase. The first Arrow Mk.

25|$|Johnson {{decided on}} a {{systematic}} bombing campaign in February after a ground report from Bundy recommending immediate US action to avoid defeat; also, the Viet Cong had just killed eight US advisers and wounded dozens of others in an attack at Pleiku Air Base. The eight-week bombing campaign became known as Operation Rolling Thunder. Johnson's instructions for public consumption were clear—there was to be no comment that the war effort had been expanded. Long term estimates of the bombing campaign ranged from an expectation that Hanoi would rein in the Viet Cong to one of provoking Hanoi and the Viet Cong into an intensification of the war. But the short-term expectations were consistent - that the morale and stability of the South Vietnamese government would be bolstered. By limiting the information given <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> and even to Congress, Johnson maximized his flexibility to change course.|$|E
25|$|The 1971 Mujib regime {{pursued a}} pro-socialist agenda. In 1972, the {{government}} decided to nationalise all banks to channel {{funds to the}} public sector and to prioritise credit to those sectors that sought to reconstruct the war-torn country – mainly industry and agriculture. However, government control of the wrong sectors prevented these banks from functioning well. This was {{compounded by the fact}} that loans were handed <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> sector without commercial considerations; banks had poor capital lease, provided poor customer service and lacked all market-based monetary instruments. Because loans were given out without commercial considerations, and because they took a long time to call a non-performing loan, and once they did, recovery under the erstwhile judicial system was so expensive, loan recovery was abysmally poor. While the government made a point of intervening everywhere, it didn't set up a proper regulatory system to diagnose such problems and correct them. Hence, banking concepts like profitability and liquidity were alien to bank managers, and capital adequacy took a backseat.|$|E

500|$|In August 2012, another roundup was completed, {{resulting}} in a further 45 horses being removed and adopted <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> through an auction. In this gather, 38 adults and 7 foals were removed, and the public paid an average price of $225 for each horses; the maximum paid was $2,300 for a mare and foal combination. During the roundup, 63 mares were treated with contraceptives, and the post-gather herd population was estimated at 133 horses. The price paid for these horses is higher than that paid for horses from most other Mustang herds; horses removed from unnamed herds in Oregon can be adopted for a walk-up fee of $125. However, it {{is lower than the}} price paid for horses from some other popular herds; horses from the Kiger Mustang herds sometimes sell for over $7,000 each. As of 2013, the BLM estimated there to be 145 horses in the Pryor Mountain Wild Horse Range (PMWHR), a number above the [...] "Appropriate Management Level", which has continued to be set at 120. The PMWHR is the only Herd Management Area (a BLM area managed for feral horses and/or burros) in Montana. There are six additional Herd Areas (BLM areas that currently have or have had in the past populations of wild horses, but are deemed not suitable for horses) in the state, but none currently contain horses, leaving the Pryor Mountain Mustangs the only free-roaming mustangs remaining in Montana.|$|E

Two official Church of Scientology responses were titled [...] "Facts vs. Fiction, A Correction of Falsehoods Contained in the May 6, 1991, Issues of Time Magazine", and [...] "The Story That Time Couldn't Tell". Prior to the advertising campaign, Scientologists distributed 88-page bound booklets which disputed points from Behar's article. The [...] "Fact vs. Fiction" [...] piece was a [...] booklet, which criticized Behar's article and asserted [...] "Behar's article omits {{the information on the}} dozens of community service programs conducted by Scientologists... which have been acknowledged by community officials". One of the advertisements in USA Today accused Time of promoting Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany, and featured a 1936 issue of Time which had Hitler's picture on the front cover. The Church of Scientology sent out a news release condemning Time [...] "horrible history of supporting fascism", and said that the article was written because Time had been pressured by [...] "vested interests".

500|$|In 1985, Milken raised $750 {{million for}} a similar blind pool for Ronald Perelman which would {{ultimately}} prove instrumental in acquiring his biggest target: The Revlon Corporation. [...] In 1980, Ronald Perelman, {{the son of a}} wealthy Philadelphia businessman, and future [...] "corporate raider" [...] having made several small but successful buyouts, acquired MacAndrews & Forbes, a distributor of licorice extract and chocolate that Perelman's father had tried and failed to acquire 10 years earlier. [...] Perelman would ultimately divest the company's core business and use MacAndrews & Forbes as a holding company investment vehicle for subsequent leveraged buyouts including Technicolor, Inc., Pantry Pride and Revlon. [...] Using the Pantry Pride subsidiary of his holding company, MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings, Perelman's overtures were rebuffed. [...] Repeatedly rejected by the company's board and management, Perelman continued to press forward with a hostile takeover raising his offer from an initial bid of $47.50 per share until it reached $53.00 per share. [...] After receiving a higher offer from a white knight, private equity firm Forstmann Little & Company, Perelman's Pantry Pride finally was able to make a successful bid for Revlon, valuing the company at $2.7 billion. [...] The buyout would prove troubling, burdened by a heavy debt load. [...] Under Perelman's control, Revlon sold four divisions: two were sold for $1 billion, its vision care division was sold for $574 million and its National Health Laboratories division was spun <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> market in 1988. [...] Revlon also made acquisitions including Max Factor in 1987 and Betrix in 1989 later selling them to Procter & Gamble in 1991. [...] Perelman exited the bulk of his holdings in Revlon through an IPO in 1996 and subsequent sales of stock. [...] As of December 31, 2007, Perelman still retains a minority ownership interest in Revlon. [...] The Revlon takeover, because of its well-known brand, was profiled widely by the media and brought new attention to the emerging boom in leveraged buyout activity.|$|E
