5|$|Cagney's seventh film, The Public Enemy, {{became one}} of the most {{influential}} gangster movies of the period. Notable for a famous scene in which Cagney pushes a grapefruit against Mae Clarke's face, the film thrust him into the spotlight. He {{became one of}} Hollywood's biggest stars and one of Warner Bros.' biggest contracts. In 1938, he received his first Academy Award for Best Actor nomination, for Angels with Dirty Faces, for his subtle portrayal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tough</b> guy/man-child Rocky Sullivan. In 1942, Cagney won the Oscar for his energetic portrayal of George M. Cohan in Yankee Doodle Dandy. He was nominated a third time in 1955 for Love Me or Leave Me. Cagney retired from acting and dancing in 1961 to spend time on his farm with his family. He came out of retirement 20 years later for a part in the movie Ragtime (1981), mainly to aid his recovery from a stroke.|$|E

25|$|The {{design was}} modular in construction, {{and the gun}} could {{be broken down into}} eleven modules within three to five minutes for {{transport}} by animals or men.

25|$|The {{first line}} of defense against invading parasites in {{vertebrates}} is the physical barrier <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tough</b> and often dry and waterproof skin, as in reptiles, birds and mammals. Most microorganisms need a moist environment to survive. By keeping the skin dry, it prevents invading organisms from colonizing. Human skin also secretes sebum, which is toxic to most microorganisms. On the other hand, larger parasites such as trematodes detect chemicals produced by the skin to locate their hosts when they enter the water. Saliva in the vertebrate mouth prevents foreign organisms from getting into the body orally. The mouth also contains lysozyme, an enzyme found in tears and the saliva. This enzyme breaks down cell walls of invading microorganisms. Should the organism pass the mouth, the stomach with its hydrochloric acid, toxic to most microorganisms, is the next line of defense. Some intestinal parasites have a thick, tough outer coating which is digested slowly or not at all, allowing the parasite to pass through the stomach alive, at which point they enter the intestine and begin the next stage of their life. Parasites can also invade the body through the eyes. The lashes on the eyelids of mammals help to prevent microorganisms from entering the eye. Tears contain the enzyme lysozyme, which kills most invading microorganisms. Once inside the body, parasites must overcome the immune system's serum proteins and pattern recognition receptors, intracellular and cellular, that trigger the adaptive immune system's lymphocytes such as T cells and antibody-producing B cells. These have receptors that recognize parasites.|$|E
500|$|Shortly before 5 September 2007, Licciardello, who {{was dressed}} as a police officer, {{performed}} random security checks and procedures on {{members of the public}} to demonstrate the glorification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tough</b> APEC security measures.

500|$|As a {{continuation}} of the Leningrad–Novgorod Offensive of January 1944, the Soviet Estonian operation pushed the front westward to the Narva River, aiming to destroy [...] "Narwa" [...] and to thrust deep into Estonia. The Soviet units established a number of bridgeheads on the western bank of the river in February while the Germans maintained a bridgehead on the eastern bank. Subsequent attempts failed to expand their toehold. German counterattacks annihilated the bridgeheads to the north of Narva and reduced the bridgehead south of the town, stabilizing the front until July 1944. The Soviet Narva Offensive (July 1944) led to the capture of the city after the German troops retreated to their prepared Tannenberg Defence Line in the Sinimäed Hills 16 kilometres from Narva. In the ensuing Battle of Tannenberg Line, the German army group held its ground. Stalin's main strategic goal—a quick recovery of Estonia as a base for air and seaborne attacks against Finland and an invasion of East Prussia—was not achieved. As a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tough</b> defence of the German forces the Soviet war effort in the Baltic Sea region was hampered for seven and a half months.|$|E

2500|$|The {{names of}} pulquerias are {{considered}} to be important for their identity and are often representative of contemporary popular culture in Mexico. They not only told the customers what to expect from that particular establishment, but also made references to popular literature, the theater, as well as international figures or events. Opera titles such as Norma, Semiramide, and La Traviata were in use, as were literary figures, Don Quixote and The Hunchback of Notre Dame, among others. More romantic and militant names like The Great Napoleon and Mexico's Former Glories were also common. More bizarre names included Get out if you Can and The Assault Barrels of pulque were also given different names depending on their flavor or alcoholic strength, such as the [...] "pulque <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tough</b> ones" [...] or the [...] "whining female". Many of the names written {{on the walls of the}} outside of the pulquerias were misspelled, which is thought to be a testimony to the low literacy rates in Mexico at the time.|$|E
2500|$|In 2013 Finneran {{starred in}} the second series of The Syndicate on BBC1, portraying Mandy, a {{hospital}} worker and domestic abuse victim who wins the national lottery with her colleagues. Finneran was attracted to the role because of the suspense of her character's storyline, {{and the challenge of}} keeping the abuse scenes as true-to-life as possible. Also in 2013, Finneran portrayed Mrs Swift in The Selfish Giant an independent film inspired by both Oscar Wilde's short story of the same name and screenwriter and director Clio Barnard's personal experiences of the socially fragmented northern English underclass. Finneran's character is a troubled yet loving mother, who she describes as [...] "not quite the full shilling". In spite <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tough</b> subject matter of the film Finneran enjoyed the filming process noting that she felt [...] "safe and secure" [...] in the hands of Barnard, who she felt to be a calmer director than any other she had worked with. For her portrayal, Finneran was nominated for the 2013 British Independent Film Award for Best Supporting Actress. In 2014, Finneran appeared in the French-Language film Un Illustre Inconnu (Nobody from Nowhere). In her private life, 2014 saw Finneran obtain a divorce her husband, Mark Jordan.|$|E
2500|$|To reduce {{government}} borrowing, the March 1993 budget {{announced a}} rising wedge of tax increases – £0.5bn {{in the first}} year, £6.7bn in the second, rising to £10.3bn in the third, the aim being to give markets confidence that government borrowing was under control without damaging the recovery. Although the budget provoked a fierce reaction {{in some parts of}} the press, its reputation improved with the passage of time. After the 2009 budget, the Sunday Times editorialised that Lamont's budget had been so badly received that he was out of his job within two months, [...] "but it fixed the public finances and set up the prosperity of the 1990s and beyond" [...] and Derek Scott, Tony Blair's economic adviser from 1997 to 2003, wrote that Lamont was [...] "rightly praised" [...] for putting in place the post-ERM framework, that stage of Lamont's career being [...] "due for rerating since, in addition to designing a proper framework for monetary policy (later consolidated by Bank of England independence in 1997), he also took most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tough</b> decisions on spending and tax to put the public finances on the road to recovery." [...] Sir Alan Walters, whose opposition to the ERM as Mrs Thatcher's economic adviser triggered Nigel Lawson's resignation as chancellor, wrote on the buoyant state of the British economy in 2001 that [...] "all the difficult and correct decisions that produced this happy state of affairs were taken and implemented by Norman Lamont, who thus showed himself, in his Mark 2 post ERM version, to be not only the most effective but also the bravest Chancellor since the War." ...|$|E
