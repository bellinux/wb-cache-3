50|$|There {{are three}} {{variations}} of the gearbox. There is a version for the cast-iron 4-cylinder engines of the 940 (redblock), the all aluminum 6-cylinder of the 960 (whiteblock), and the version for the Volkswagen 6-cylinder diesel engine D24TIC. The differences are the bell housing bolt pattern and the <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>flange</b> with a 3-bolt flange for the redblock/diesel engines and a 4 bolt flange for whiteblock engines.The variant for the 6-cylinder Volvo engine will fit on all 4/5/6 all-aluminum Volvo N/RN-series engines.|$|E
50|$|Input and <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>flanges</b> are {{bolted to}} the giubo on either side using {{alternating}} hole positions, so that the flanges are not connected directly to one another but instead only through the rubber material of the coupling. The elasticity of the rubber absorbs vibration and flexes for alignment. It follows that the rubber must withstand the application's full transmitted torque, for which reason the rubber is often reinforced internally using moulded-in fibre material.|$|R
5000|$|The engine gave {{maximum power}} at 7,500 rpm (the rotors turning at only 2,500rpm), but a 2.96:1 {{reduction}} gearbox (closely {{based on that}} in the Hewland AE75 engine) gave a maximum propeller rotation of an efficient 2,500 rpm. [...] Unlike the Hewland's gearbox, where the <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> and propellor <b>flange</b> was below the crankshaft, the MidWest's gearbox had its <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> higher than the eccentric shaft. This feature allowed a larger propeller and better prop clearance, while raising {{the height of the}} engine's thrust line, and reducing downward visibility over the nose very slightly.|$|R
40|$|A {{torque meter}} {{comprising}} hollow-keyed, input and <b>output</b> female <b>shafts</b> adapted {{to receive the}} male shafts of the power source and machine respectively. Each shaft has a circular flange whose face is perpendicular to the center line of the <b>shafts.</b> Each <b>flange</b> has a plurality of equally spaced cylindrical recesses machined into the inside face thereto adapted to receive conical inserts therein. Balls are contained by the conical inserts and transmit the rotational movement from the input to the <b>output</b> <b>shaft.</b> A stationary housing extends around the input and <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> and has a transducer shell secured thereto. When {{force is applied to}} the input shaft to cause movement, the balls encounter torsional resistance which causes the balls to roll up the ramps of the conical seat inserts to separate the two torque flanges. The force transmitted through the balls causes rotation to the <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> and produces tension to the stationary transducer shell. The stationary transducer shell is instrumented with semi-conductor strain gauges...|$|R
50|$|It is a three-axis design, with first, second, fifth, {{and sixth}} gears on an <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> behind {{and below the}} input shaft, and third and fourth gears are on an <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> in front of and above the input <b>shaft.</b> Both <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> pinions drive a helical gear with a {{conventional}} differential. The clutch is mounted on a dual-mass flywheel to dampen vibrations on whichever <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> is idle depending upon which gear is selected.|$|R
50|$|The {{input shaft}} drives an {{eccentric}} bearing {{that in turn}} drives the cycloidal disc in an eccentric, cycloidal motion. The perimeter of this disc is geared to a stationary ring gear and has a series of <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> pins or rollers placed through {{the face of the}} disc. These <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> pins directly drive the <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> as the cycloidal disc rotates. The radial motion of the disc is not translated to the <b>output</b> <b>shaft.</b>|$|R
50|$|The F40 has a three-axis design, with first, second, fifth, {{and sixth}} gears on an <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> behind {{and below the}} input shaft, and third and fourth gears are on an <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> in front of and above the input <b>shaft.</b> Both <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> pinions drive a helical gear with a {{conventional}} differential.

40|$|A {{sample testing}} device {{includes}} a motor, a gear reducer, and an <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> coupled for rotation by the motor via the gear reducer. The sample testing device further includes a first device adapted {{to enable the}} <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> to move linearly in a first direction substantially parallel with an axis of the <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> and a second device coupled to the first device for enabling the <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> to move linearly in a second direction substantially perpendicular to the first direction. The sample testing can further include a third device coupled to {{the first and second}} devices for enabling the <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> to translate linearly in a third direction substantially perpendicular to the first and second directions...|$|R
40|$|A motor {{controller}} system uses a rotary sensor with {{a plurality of}} signal conditioning units, coupled to the rotary sensor. Each of these units, which {{is associated with a}} particular range of motor <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> rotation rates, generate a feedback signal indicative of the position of the motor s <b>output</b> <b>shaft.</b> A controller (i) converts a selected motor <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> rotation rate to a corresponding incremental amount of rotational movement for a selected fixed time period, (ii) selects, at periodic completions of the selected fixed time period, the feedback signal from one of the signal conditioning units for which the particular range of motor <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> rotation rates associated therewith encompasses the selected motor <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> rotation rate, and (iii) generates a motor drive signal based on a difference between the incremental amount of rotational movement and the feedback signal from the selected one of the signal conditioning Units...|$|R
50|$|Many Powerglides {{share the}} same length, 27 spline <b>output</b> <b>shaft,</b> and {{transmission}} mounting as the THM 350; thus, the transmissions are easily interchangeable for owners wanting three speeds instead of two. Other Powerglides came with an incompatible 16 spline <b>output</b> <b>shaft.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Each {{crown wheel}} {{interfaces}} to the respective <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> directly, whilst the spider carrier interfaces to each <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> using a clutch pack {{which gives the}} unit {{the ability to control}} torque distribution over and above the static torque distribution.|$|R
50|$|The AW4 is {{also used}} behind the 2.5 L (150 CID) AMC Straight-4 engine. It has a {{removable}} bell housing with a mount for the crankshaft position sensor. Early AW4s used 21-spline <b>output</b> <b>shafts.</b> In 1991 the AW4 was changed to a 23-spline <b>output</b> <b>shaft,</b> concurrent with adoption of the High Output (commonly known as H.O.) inline six-cylinder engine. Some sources state that the <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> spline change occurred for the 1990 model year. The change most likely occurred during the 1990 model run with early 1990 models receiving 21-spline transmission and later models receiving 23-spline. If swapping transmissions in 1990 model year vehicles either swap the transfer case as well or make sure to check spline count. The input on the transfer case can also be changed to match the <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> spline count. Rear-wheel-drive-only transmissions {{all have the same}} spline count on the <b>output</b> <b>shaft,</b> only 4x4 models are affected by differing spline count.|$|R
50|$|The PT6D-114A {{is based}} on the PT6A-114A. The main {{difference}} is the deletion of the second stage reduction gearing and <b>output</b> <b>shaft,</b> because the engine is intended for integration with a combining gearbox incorporating power turbine governors and a propeller <b>output</b> <b>shaft.</b>|$|R
50|$|Likewise, {{the size}} of an idler wheel in a non-geared {{friction}} drive system does not affect the gear ratio between the input and <b>output</b> <b>shafts.</b> The surface speed of the input shaft is transferred directly to the surface speed of the idler wheel, and then from the idler wheel to the <b>output</b> <b>shaft.</b> A larger or smaller idler wheel maintains the same surface speed (which equals the surface speed of the input <b>shaft),</b> therefore the <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> is driven at a constant speed regardless of {{the size of}} the idler wheel.|$|R
5000|$|Comes in two varieties: 20 and 22-splines on the <b>output</b> <b>shaft.</b>|$|R
40|$|Proposed {{flexible}} coupling provides nearly error free measurements of shaft rotation in presence of misalinements between shaft and position sensing transducer. Intended {{to be used}} in situations in which input or <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> is mounted on flexible joint. Its function is to insure equal input and output angular velocities by forcing input and <b>output</b> <b>shafts</b> to remain parallel...|$|R
50|$|In the Sulzer LDA engine, a {{gear wheel}} on each {{crankshaft}} meshed {{with a slightly}} smaller gear wheel on the central <b>output</b> <b>shaft.</b> The crankshafts ran at around 750 rpm but the <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> ran at about 1,000 rpm. This allowed {{the use of a}} smaller, and lighter, electrical generator when the engine was used in a diesel-electric locomotive.|$|R
5000|$|While the {{standard}} (Type 1 or T1) Torsen supports a static torque ratio of 50:50; i.e., input torque is supported equally across both <b>output</b> <b>shafts,</b> the T1 has a Torque Bias Ratio (TBR) of 2.7-4:1; i.e., it allows about 3 to 4 times the torque {{to be supplied}} to the most tractive <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> than that {{is available on the}} least tractive shaft or, a torque split of between 25% to 75%. However, by nature the T1 Torsen is locked under most circumstances (<b>output</b> <b>shafts</b> locked together). Only when the TBR is reached (i.e., there is a greater torque difference across the <b>output</b> <b>shafts</b> than can be supported by the TBR) do the <b>output</b> <b>shafts</b> turn relative to each other, and the differential unlocks. This characteristic results in a relatively free torque movement between both outputs of the (centre) differential, within the limits of the TBR. Thus the static torque distribution of the T1 Torsen in a centre differential installation, rather than being 50:50, will mirror the weight distribution (both static and dynamic) of the vehicle due to the traction available at either (front:rear) <b>output</b> <b>shaft.</b> In a standard car, this is desirable from the perspective of stability, acceleration and traction, but can be undesirable in terms of handling (understeer). While {{the standard}} quattro Torsen T1 with 2.7:1 TBR is more than sufficient in most conditions, Torsen T1 differentials with higher TBRs (4:1) are available and can further limit understeer by supporting a wider torque split. A better solution, however, is to apportion a torque split directly between both <b>output</b> <b>shafts</b> (front & rear) and for this reason Audi has adopted the Type 3 (T3) Torsen design in the latest generations of quattro.|$|R

50|$|On a {{conventional}} rear-drive transmission, {{there are three}} basic shafts; the input, the output, and the countershaft. The input and output together are called the mainshaft, since they are joined inside the transmission so {{they appear to be}} a single shaft, although they rotate totally independently of each other. The input length of this shaft is much shorter than the <b>output</b> <b>shaft.</b> Parallel to the mainshaft is the countershaft. There are a number of gears fixed along the countershaft, and matching gears along the <b>output</b> <b>shaft,</b> although these are not fixed, and rotate independently of the <b>output</b> <b>shaft.</b> There are sliding dog collars, or dog clutches, between the gears on the <b>output</b> <b>shaft,</b> and to engage a gear to the shaft, the collar slides into the space between the shaft and the inside space of the gear, thus rotating the shaft as well. One collar is usually mounted between two gears, and slides both ways to engage one or the other gears, so on a four-speed there would be two collars. A front-drive transmission is basically the same, but may be simplified. There often are two shafts, the input and the output, but depending on the direction of rotation of the engine, three may be required. Rather than the input shaft driving the countershaft with a pinion gear, the input shaft takes over the countershaft's job, and the <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> runs parallel to it. The gears are positioned and engaged just as they are on the countershaft and <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> of a rear-drive. This merely eliminates one major component, the pinion gear. Part of the reason that the input and output are in-line on a rear drive unit is to relieve torsional stress on the transmission and mountings, but this isn't an issue in a front-drive as the gearbox is integrated into the transaxle.|$|R
