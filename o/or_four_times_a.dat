5|$|The tuatara's greenish brown colour matches its environment, and {{can change}} over its lifetime. Tuatara shed their skin {{at least once}} per year as adults, and three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>times</b> <b>a</b> year as juveniles. Tuatara sexes differ in more than size. The spiny crest on a tuatara's back, made of triangular, soft folds of skin, is larger in males, and can be {{stiffened}} for display. The male abdomen is narrower than the female's.|$|E
5|$|Born in Sydney on 7 November 1944, Windle {{grew up in}} {{the eastern}} Sydney suburb of Waverley. Windle and his sister Norma learnt to swim at nearby Bronte Beach. His family later {{relocated}} to Bexley North, and he swam for his school team at Marist College Kogarah. Windle was coached by Frank Guthrie at the Enfield pool from the age of 12. After a fortnight of training, he entered the district age group championships and won a place in the top three. From then on, he began training three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>times</b> <b>a</b> week, and his father drove him to Enfield for morning training. By the age of 15, he was training every day.|$|E

5|$|In 1828, Heliade {{published}} his first work, {{an essay on}} Romanian grammar, in the Transylvanian city of Hermannstadt (which {{was part of the}} Austrian Empire at the time), and, on April 20, 1829, began printing the Bucharest-based paper Curierul Românesc. This was the most successful of several attempts to create a local newspaper, something Golescu first attempted in 1828. Publishing articles in both Romanian and French, Curierul Românesc had, starting in 1836, its own literary supplement, under the title of Curier de Ambe Sexe; in print until 1847, it notably published one of Heliade's most famous poems, Zburătorul. Curierul Românesc was edited as a weekly, and later as a bimonthly, until 1839, when it began to be issued three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>times</b> <b>a</b> week. Its best-known contributors were Heliade himself, Grigore Alexandrescu, Costache Negruzzi, Dimitrie Bolintineanu, Ioan Catina, Vasile Cârlova, and Iancu Văcărescu.|$|E
5|$|In 1954 Blyton adapted Noddy for the stage, {{producing}} the Noddy in Toyland pantomime {{in just two}} or three weeks. The production was staged at the 2660-seat Stoll Theatre in Kingsway, London at Christmas. Its popularity resulted in the show running during the Christmas season {{for five or six}} years. Blyton was delighted with its reception by children in the audience, and attended the theatre three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>times</b> <b>a</b> week. TV adaptations of Noddy since 1954 include one in the 1970s narrated by Richard Briers. In 1955 a stage play based on the Famous Five was produced, and in January 1997 the King's Head Theatre embarked on a six-month tour of the UK with The Famous Five Musical, to commemorate Blyton's centenary. On 21 November 1998 The Secret Seven Save the World was first performed at the Sherman Theatre in Cardiff.|$|E
25|$|A 1997 report {{published}} in the Journal of Family Violence, found that among male perpetrators of spousal homicide, 60–75% of offenders had been drinking prior to the incident. In a 2004 study of domestic violence in the Central Black Earth Region of Russia, 77% of offenders of violent crime towards family members were frequent drinkers - 12% engaged in regular binge drinking three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>times</b> <b>a</b> month, 30% {{three times a week}} or more, and 35% every day or almost every day.|$|E

50|$|Mental and {{physical}} tolerance to psilocybin builds and dissipates quickly. Taking ethocybin {{more than three}} <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>times</b> in <b>a</b> week (especially two days in a row) can result in diminished effects. Tolerance dissipates after a few days, so frequent users often keep doses spaced five to seven days apart to avoid the effect.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Bumble {{regarded}} Oliver's piteous {{and helpless}} look, with some astonishment, {{for a few}} seconds; hemmed three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>times</b> in <b>a</b> husky manner; and after muttering something about 'that troublesome cough,' bade Oliver dry his eyes and be a good boy. Then once more taking his hand, he walked on with him in silence.|$|R
25|$|In mid-1998, Atta worked {{alongside}} Shehhi, bin al-Shibh, and Belfas, at a warehouse, packing {{computers in}} crates for shipping. The Hamburg {{group did not}} stay in Wilhelmsburg for long. The next winter, they moved into an apartment at Marienstrasse 54 in the borough of Harburg, near the Hamburg University of Technology, at which they enrolled. It was here that the Hamburg cell developed and acted more as a group. They met three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>times</b> <b>a</b> week to discuss their anti-American feelings and to plot possible attacks. Many al-Qaeda members lived in this apartment at various times, including hijacker Marwan al-Shehhi, Zakariya Essabar, and others.|$|E
25|$|Throughout his New York radio career, Kaufman {{produced}} multi-racial rock 'n' roll shows three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>times</b> <b>a</b> year, usually {{during the}} Easter school recess, {{the week before}} Labor Day, and between Christmas and New Year at the Brooklyn Fox Theater. Those shows featured the top performers of the era and introduced new acts, such as The Delicates, Dionne Warwick, The Shirelles, Chuck Jackson, The Zombies, Little Anthony and the Imperials, the Ronettes, the Shangri-Las, Gene Pitney, Ben E. King, The Tymes, Smokey Robinson & The Miracles, Bobby Vinton (who {{was the leader of}} the house band when he asked for a chance to perform as a singer), The Lovin' Spoonful, Cream, and The Who, among many others.|$|E
25|$|Doctors treat a {{dislocation}} {{by putting}} {{the head of the}} humerus back into the joint socket (glenoid fossa) of the scapula — a procedure called manipulation and reduction (M). This is usually followed up with an x ray to make sure the reduction did not fracture the surrounding bones. The arm is then immobilized in a sling or a device called a shoulder immobilizer for several days. Usually the doctor recommends resting the shoulder and applying ice three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>times</b> <b>a</b> day. After pain and swelling have been controlled, the patient enters a rehabilitation program that includes exercises to restore the range of motion of the shoulder and strengthen the muscles to prevent future dislocations. These exercises may progress from simple motion to the use of weights.|$|E
50|$|During {{the decade}} that Mawby {{supplied}} information he handed over lists of parliamentary committees, and details about his fellow politicians, including a supposedly confidential parliamentary investigation into a Conservative peer. Meetings sometimes took place three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>times</b> in <b>a</b> month, although this greatly decreased {{by the end}} of the 1960s, and ended completely in November 1971.|$|R

25|$|For {{the next}} eight years Liszt {{continued}} to tour Europe, spending holidays with the countess and their children on the island of Nonnenwerth on the Rhine in summers 1841 and 1843. In spring 1844 the couple finally separated. This was Liszt's most brilliant period as a concert pianist. Honours were showered on him and he met with adulation wherever he went. Franz wrote his Three Concert Études between 1845 and 1849. Since he often appeared three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>times</b> <b>a</b> week in concert, it could be safe to assume that he appeared in public well over a thousand times during this eight-year period. Moreover, his great fame as a pianist, which he would continue to enjoy long after he had officially retired from the concert stage, was based mainly on his accomplishments during this time.|$|E
500|$|Svalbard Airport, Longyear, located [...] from Longyearbyen, is {{the only}} airport {{offering}} air transport off the archipelago. Scandinavian Airlines has daily scheduled services to Tromsø and Oslo. Low-cost carrier Norwegian Air Shuttle also has a service between Oslo and Svalbard, operating three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>times</b> <b>a</b> week; there are also irregular charter services to Russia. Finnair announced commencement of service from Helsinki, operating {{three times a week}} starting 1 June 2016 and lasting until 27 August 2016, but Norwegian authorities did not allow this route, citing the 1978 bilateral agreement on air traffic between Finland and Norway. Lufttransport provides regular corporate charter services from Longyearbyen to Ny-Ålesund Airport and Svea Airport for Kings Bay and Store Norske; these flights are in general not available to the public. There are heliports in Barentsburg and Pyramiden, and helicopters are frequently used by the governor {{and to a lesser extent}} the mining company Arktikugol.|$|E
500|$|Recalling {{the release}} {{in his book}} Revolution in the Head, Ian MacDonald writes that, with Revolver, the Beatles [...] "had {{initiated}} a second pop revolution – one which while galvanising their existing rivals and inspiring many new ones, left all of them far behind". In a February 1967 review, Hit Parader declared: [...] "Revolver represents the pinnacle of pop music. No group has been as consistently creative as the Beatles, though the [...] Spoonful and Beach Boys are coming closer all the time... Rather than analyze the music we just suggest that you listen to Revolver three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>times</b> <b>a</b> day and marvel..." [...] Later that year, in Esquire, Robert Christgau called the album [...] "twice as good and four times as startling as Rubber Soul, with sound effects, Oriental drones, jazz bands, transcendentalist lyrics, all kinds of rhythmic and harmonic surprises, and a filter that made John Lennon sound like God singing through a foghorn".|$|E
25|$|The present {{organization}} {{known as}} the National Basketball Association, then called the BAA (Basketball Association of America), had its inaugural season in 1946–47.

500|$|... "I'm Goin' Down" [...] {{features}} an energetic rhythm, propelled by a heavy drumbeat by Weinberg, and contains a saxophone solo by Clemons. The music has a basic chord progression of A–E–F#m–D. In concerts in 1984, Springsteen introduced the song by describing the diminishing intimacy and sexual activity {{that can occur}} {{over the course of}} a romantic relationship: [...] " [...] you're making love to 'em all the time, three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>times</b> <b>a</b> day. Then you come back a little bit later, and, uh-oh... it's like 'Are you gonna make love to me tonight, or are we gonna wait for the full moon again', y'know?" [...] The song's lyrics include lines such as [...] "I'm sick and tired of you setting me up / Setting me up just to knock-a knock-a knock-a me down" [...] and [...] "You used to love to drive me wild / But lately girl you get your kicks from just driving me down". The lyrics later turn into a stream of gibberish syllables.|$|E
500|$|Both sexes become {{sexually mature}} {{when they are}} {{one to two years}} old. Oestrus in females lasts one to four days; it {{typically}} occurs once or twice a year, though it can occur three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>times</b> <b>a</b> year if the mother loses her litters. Observations of captive servals suggest that when a female enters oestrus, the rate of urine-marking increases in her as well as the males in her vicinity. Zoologist Jonathan Kingdon described the behaviour of a female serval in oestrus in his 1997 book East African Mammals. He noted that she would roam restlessly, spray urine frequently holding her vibrating tail in a vertical manner, rub her head near the place she has marked, salivate continuously, give out sharp and short [...] "miaow"s that can be heard for quite a distance, and rub her mouth and cheeks against the face of an approaching male. The time when mating takes place varies geographically; births peak in winter in Botswana, and {{toward the end of the}} dry season in the Ngorongoro Crater. A trend generally observed across the range is that births precede the breeding season of murid rodents.|$|E
500|$|The cinema {{opened in}} 1912 as [...] "The Scala". It {{was the third}} cinema to open in Britain, {{and by the time}} of its closure in 2001 it was the third longest-running cinema in the country. As Cine City its {{original}} single-screen auditorium had been fitted with 675seats in three cinema screens. Before the advent of [...] "talkies", the Scala had a resident female cinema pianist, and the conductor Sir John Barbirolli once played the piano to accompany the silent films. Violet Carson, who went on to play Ena Sharples in Coronation Street, was also a resident pianist. During the 1930s the popularity of the new [...] "picture houses" [...] grew rapidly, with 109 in Manchester at its peak. Many people visited The Scala three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>times</b> <b>a</b> week. The craze for cinema-going was seen by some as a social ill of its time; school teachers complained that pupils were not doing their homework because they were spending too much time at the cinema. One regular movie-goer at the cinema in the 1920s was Robert Donat, a local boy who went on to become an Oscar-winning actor.|$|E
50|$|A T. {{angostura}} colony {{will only}} reproduce once a year, {{as opposed to}} many honeybees that can reproduce three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>times</b> in <b>a</b> year. The largest colony cycle occurs during the summer in South America, {{with most of the}} new brood hatching between December and March. This time of the year coincides with the best foraging conditions, which ensure enough food can be provided for the larvae. Each colony has one reproductive queen to mate and lay eggs.|$|R

500|$|On February 2, 2010, it was {{reported}} that Williams would travel to the United States to have heart surgery. The move raised questions about the quality and availability of health care services and procedures in Canada's health care system. According to Deputy Premier Kathy Dunderdale, [...] "It was never an option offered to him to have this procedure done in this province." [...] Dunderdale refused to answer how the procedure would be paid for, or whether the procedure could have been scheduled to be performed in another province of Canada. On February 8, 2010, it {{was reported}} that Williams' surgery had been successful. On his return, Williams later defended his choice saying: [...] "I did not sign away my right to get the best possible health care for myself when I entered politics". Williams said although he had [...] "the utmost confidence" [...] in his own province's health care system, his decision was to go to Mount Sinai Medical Center, Miami to undergo [...] "a very specialized piece of surgery [...] somebody who's doing this three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>times</b> <b>a</b> day, five, six days a week." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{moving to}} Hamburg in 1998, al-Shehhi helped form the Hamburg cell with Mohamed Atta and Ramzi bin al-Shibh. There, his views {{became more and}} more radical.
