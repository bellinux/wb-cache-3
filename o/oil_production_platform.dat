50|$|A semi-submersible {{platform}} is a specialised marine vessel {{used in a}} number of specific offshore roles such as offshore drilling rigs, safety vessels, <b>oil</b> <b>production</b> <b>platforms,</b> and heavy lift cranes. They are designed with good stability and seakeeping characteristics. Other terms include semi-submersible, semi-sub, or simply semi.|$|R
50|$|A {{pipelaying}} ship is a maritime vessel used in {{the construction}} of subsea infrastructure. It serves to connect <b>oil</b> <b>production</b> <b>platforms</b> with refineries on shore.

50|$|Due to {{the high}} level of {{accuracy}} required during custody transfer applications, the flowmeters which are used to perform this are subject to approval by an organization such as the American Petroleum Institute (API).Custody transfer operations can occur at a number of points along the way; these may include operations, transactions or transferring of oil from an <b>oil</b> <b>production</b> <b>platform</b> to a ship, barge, railcar, truck and also to the final destination point, such as a refinery.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{point out}} that the title “Rigs to Reefs” is {{somewhat}} of a misnomer. As Milton Love, a biologist with the UC Santa Barbara Marine Science Institute noted, the <b>oil</b> <b>production</b> <b>platforms</b> are not just potential artificial reefs: [...] "They are in fact artificial reefs right now." [...] The question to Rigs-to-Reef supporters is whether it is good public policy to remove established artificial reefs.|$|R
50|$|The Perhentian Islands {{were once}} {{home to a}} {{significant}} green and hawksbill sea turtle nesting population. Now the islands receive only 300 nestings per year, partly due to frequent oil spills from nearby <b>oil</b> <b>production</b> <b>platforms</b> and <b>oil</b> tankers owned by Petronas. The Department of Fisheries runs a turtle hatchery on the islands to help address the declining turtle populations. Egg poaching from the beaches is a continuing problem.|$|R
50|$|Commercial Diving Support Vessels {{emerged during}} the 1960s and 1970s, when the need arose for diving {{operations}} to be performed below and around <b>oil</b> <b>production</b> <b>platforms</b> and associated installations in open water in the North Sea and Gulf of Mexico. Until that point, most diving operations were from mobile oil drilling platforms, pipe-lay, or crane barges. The diving system tended to be modularised and craned {{on and off the}} vessels as a package.|$|R
5000|$|The {{legacy of}} the Hansa is remembered today in several names: the German airline Lufthansa (i.e., [...] "Air Hansa"); F.C. Hansa Rostock; the Hanze University of Applied Sciences, Groningen, in the Netherlands; the Hanze <b>oil</b> <b>production</b> <b>platform</b> (also in the Netherlands); the Hansa Brewery in Bergen; the Hansabank in the Baltic states (now known as Swedbank); and the Hanse Sail in Rostock. DDG Hansa was a major German {{shipping}} company from 1881 until its bankruptcy in 1980.|$|E
50|$|A typical <b>oil</b> <b>production</b> <b>platform</b> is {{self-sufficient}} {{in energy}} and water needs, housing electrical generation, water desalinators {{and all of the}} equipment necessary to process oil and gas such that it can be either delivered directly onshore by pipeline or to a floating platform or tanker loading facility, or both. Elements in the oil/gas production process include wellhead, production manifold, production separator, glycol process to dry gas, gas compressors, water injection pumps, oil/gas export metering and main oil line pumps.|$|E
50|$|The Saipem 7000, {{originally}} {{named the}} Micoperi 7000, was conceived {{in the mid-1980s}} by its original owners Micoperi as a multipurpose offshore oil platform installation vessel that {{would be able to}} install very large <b>oil</b> <b>production</b> <b>platform</b> decks (known as integrated decks) as well as the decks' supporting structures (known as jackets) using its two very large fully revolving cranes. It would also be able to support the offshore completion of the platform by providing hotel and workshop facilities for large construction crews. Saturation Diving facilities would support subsea connection work. The vessel's size and semi-submersible form would allow it to operate in worse weather conditions than smaller and conventionally shaped vessels.|$|E
50|$|Following {{a number}} of hurricanes from 2004 to 2008, {{including}} Katrina, Ike, Ivan, and Rita, that damaged <b>oil</b> <b>production</b> <b>platforms,</b> offshore <b>oil</b> operators filed numerous applications to abandon unused platforms in place. The federal government responded by placing a moratorium on Rigs-to-Reefs, and requiring unused platforms to be speedily decommissioned by removal. In June 2013, the BSEE lifted its moratorium on Rigs-to-Reefs, subject to Coast Guard determination that the structure would not {{pose a threat to}} navigation, and acceptance of ownership and liability by the state government.|$|R
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1970s, offshore technology became an important field of activity for Germanischer Lloyd. In 1973, working on behalf of the German Federal Ministry of Research and Technology, the society surveyed the construction of the research platform “North Sea” and supervised its installation to the North West of the German island Helgoland. GL was also involved in the installation of the first German <b>oil</b> <b>production</b> <b>platforms</b> “Mittelplate”, located in the Wadden Sea, and “Schwedeneck”, located in the Baltic Sea at the German Bight off Kiel, Germany. Many other offshore technology projects followed and the work continues today.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Pulsed Eddy Current (PEC) {{has been}} applied to monitor wall {{thickness}} in piping of refineries and <b>oil</b> <b>production</b> <b>platforms.</b> PEC is a non-intrusive and noncontact NDT method and has a much better reproducibility than e. g. periodic ultrasonic wall thickness measurements and is therefore a preferred choice for corrosion monitoring with relative short intervals. As PEC is a non-contact NDT technique, it can also be applied for wall thickness monitoring at high temperatures. PEC corrosion monitoring is illustrated here with an example of a hydrocracker unit in a refinery. Precision wall thickness monitoring allowed extension of runtime despite aggressive flow-assisted NH 4 HS corrosion. PEC has also been applied at crude distillers and high vacuum units of refineries and to verify corrosion inhibition at <b>oil</b> <b>production</b> facilities...|$|R
50|$|Months later, Esther, a North Sea supply ship, {{takes on}} board {{a group of men}} posing as reporters who are visiting the <b>oil</b> <b>production</b> <b>platform</b> Jennifer. The leader of this group, Lou Kramer (Anthony Perkins), along with his second-in-command, Harold Shulman (Michael Parks), hijacks the ship, and two scuba diving henchmen attach limpet mines to the legs of Jennifer and its oil {{drilling}} rig, Ruth. From the bridge of Esther, Kramer issues a ransom demand for £25 million or he will blow up Ruth; then, if the ransom is still not paid, he will destroy Jennifer. For good measure, he rigs Esther with explosives and has all the charges wired to a control panel that never leaves his side.|$|E
50|$|Until 2001, {{the field}} was {{developed}} using Petrobras 36 <b>oil</b> <b>production</b> <b>platform.</b> In {{the early hours of}} March 15, 2001 there were two unexplained explosions in the aft starboard column. At the time there were 175 people on the platform; 11 were killed. Following the explosions, the platform developed a 16° list, sufficient to allow down-flooding from the submerged fairlead boxes. Marine salvage teams tried over the weekend to save the platform by pumping nitrogen and compressed air into the tanks to expel the water, but they abandoned the rig after bad weather. The platform sank five days after the explosions (March 20), in 1200 m of water with an estimated 1500 t of crude oil remaining on board.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{characteristic}} features of microbial degradation is that it involves not individual organisms growing in axenic culture but rather mixed communities of species with differing but complementary metabolic capabilities. Often such consortia demonstrate structural as well as functional organisation and exist {{in the form of}} flocs or biofilms within which there are likely to be localized microenvironments, each with a particular combination of organisms and physico-chemical conditions. Such biofilms are ubiquitous in nature being found, for example, on soil and sediment particles, and on the surfaces of teeth, ships and off-shore <b>oil</b> <b>production</b> <b>platforms.</b> In controlled processes of biodegradation and biotransformation they are the active component of trickling filters and the various forms of immobilized cell and fixed bed reactors...|$|R
