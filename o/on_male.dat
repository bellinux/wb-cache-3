5|$|Despite the {{political}} upheaval, the Egyptian temple style continued to evolve without absorbing much foreign influence. Whereas earlier temple building mostly focused <b>on</b> <b>male</b> gods, goddesses and child deities grew increasingly prominent. Temples {{focused more on}} popular religious activities such as oracles, animal cults, and prayer. New architectural forms continued to develop, such as covered kiosks in front of gateways, more elaborate column styles, and the mammisi, a building celebrating the mythical birth of a god. Though {{the characteristics of the}} late temple style had developed by the last period of native rule, most of the examples date from the era of the Ptolemies, Greek kings who ruled as pharaohs for nearly 300 years.|$|E
5|$|Hermaphroditism {{appeared}} in medical literature {{enough to be}} considered common knowledge, although cases were rare. Homoerotic elements in literature were pervasive, specifically the masquerade of one gender for another to fool an unsuspecting woman into being seduced. Such plot devices were used in Shakespeare's Twelfth Night (1601), The Faerie Queene by Edmund Spenser in 1590, and James Shirley's The Bird in a Cage (1633). Extraordinary cases during the Renaissance of women taking <b>on</b> <b>male</b> personae and going undetected for years or decades have been recorded.|$|E
5|$|Take Off Your Pants and Jacket is {{the fourth}} studio album by American rock band Blink-182. Produced by Jerry Finn, the album was {{released}} on June 12, 2001, through MCA Records. The band {{had spent much of}} the previous year traveling and supporting their third album Enema of the State (1999), which launched the band's mainstream career. The title is a tongue-in-cheek pun <b>on</b> <b>male</b> masturbation ("take off your pants and jack it"). The cover art has icons for each member of the trio: an airplane ("take off"), a pair of pants, and a jacket. The album's first, limited pressing came in three separate discs reflecting each icon and containing separate bonus tracks and joke songs.|$|E

5|$|The Homosexual Matrix was {{controversial}} and received many negative reviews. It {{was criticized for}} Tripp's alleged bias in favor of homosexuality, dismissive treatment of psychoanalytic theories, rambling style, sexism, focus <b>on</b> <b>male</b> homosexuality and neglect of lesbianism, and failure to discuss the gay liberation movement. The book drew a negative reaction from psychoanalysts, including an ethics complaint against Tripp with the American Psychological Association. Tripp himself believed that it had received a negative reaction from the gay media and from some gay people. Nevertheless, it was influential and has received praise as an important work on homosexuality. Commentators have supported Tripp's view that erotic feeling depends on resistance to its satisfaction.|$|E
5|$|On 8 June 1867, Ottoman Sultan Abdülaziz {{formally}} recognized Isma'il Pasha by {{the title}} Khedive, which ranked {{higher than that}} of Vizier but lower than that of Caliph. The Khedivate of Egypt was still nominally a subject of the Ottoman Sultan, and its rulers were still technically appointed and dismissed by an imperial firman. Nevertheless, the Khedive actually exercised most sovereign powers, including the appointment of his council of ministers, the rector of Al-Azhar, and high-ranking military and naval officers. He could also sign treaties with foreign powers and borrow money for the state treasury. On 17 May 1866, the rule of succession in Egypt was changed from one based on agnatic seniority to one based <b>on</b> <b>male</b> primogeniture in the direct line of Isma'il Pasha. After the British occupied the country in 1882, the Khedive's exercise of power was limited greatly by the advice of the British agent and consul general, who became the de facto ruler of the country.|$|E

25|$|CAH {{has little}} effect <b>on</b> <b>male</b> {{fertility}} unless an adult stops taking his glucocorticoid medication entirely {{for an extended}} time, in which case excessive adrenal testosterone may reduce testicular production as well as spermatogenesis.|$|E
25|$|Vasectomy: The {{cutting and}} tying of the vasa deferentia. Failure rates are insignificantly small. This {{procedure}} is routinely carried out <b>on</b> <b>male</b> ferrets and sheep {{to manipulate the}} estrus cycles of in-contact females. It is uncommon in other animal species.|$|E
25|$|Females can {{sometimes}} change their differential ovulation responses based <b>on</b> <b>male</b> stimuli to affect male reproductive success. In lions some females will reduce fertility after the male commits infanticide, {{resulting in low}} offspring counts after a new male takes over a pride.|$|E
50|$|Sub-adult lions: The smaller size, the {{presence}} of spots/rosettes and the insignificant manes <b>on</b> <b>males</b> could indicate sub-adult specimens, possibly ousted from their prides.|$|R
50|$|Both sexes have tightly spiraled, 'V'-shaped horns. They can {{be up to}} 123 cm long <b>on</b> <b>males</b> and 66 cm <b>on</b> females. <b>Males</b> have horns {{that are}} thicker at the ends, longer, and more {{divergent}} than those of females. These features of the horns suggest that the giant eland evolved from an ancestor with true display horns.|$|R
50|$|Males {{are more}} {{susceptible}} to mtDNA defects, not only because of lack of selection for mtDNA <b>on</b> <b>males</b> but also due to sperm’s higher energy requirements for motility. There are evidence showing mtDNA mutations are more likely to affect males. In humans, Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) is caused by one or several point mutations on mtDNA and LHON affects more males than females. In mice, a deletion on mtDNA causes oligospermia and asthenozoospermia, resulting in infertility. Taken together, mtDNA mutations pose a greater threat <b>on</b> <b>males</b> than <b>on</b> females.|$|R
25|$|An {{explanation}} for the queen’s near monopoly <b>on</b> <b>male</b> production is that worker production is costly and therefore reduces total colony reproduction. The cost toward worker production acts as a selective pressure on the workers, so {{they are more likely}} to exercise reproductive restraint.|$|E
25|$|Male {{prisoners of}} war {{may be subject to}} rape and sexual {{violence}}. Sexual violence against male prisoners of the Iraq War gained wide publicity after graphic photos documented such abuses <b>on</b> <b>male</b> Iraqi prisoners by US guards at Abu Ghraib prison, where prisoners were forced to humiliate themselves.|$|E
25|$|The {{emergence}} of modern democracy generally began with male citizens obtaining {{the right to}} vote in advance of female citizens, except in the Kingdom of Hawai'i, where universal manhood and women's suffrage was introduced in 1840; however, a constitutional amendment in 1852 rescinded female voting and put property qualifications <b>on</b> <b>male</b> voting.|$|E

50|$|Wedgies, {{especially}} when performed <b>on</b> <b>males,</b> can be dangerous, potentially causing testicular or scrotal damage. An incident in 2004 involving a ten-year-old boy required reattachment of a testicle to the scrotum.|$|R

25|$|Robert L. Moore and Douglas Gillette {{collaborated on}} a series of five books <b>on</b> <b>male</b> {{psychology}} and mythopoetic aspects of human development, including King, Warrior, Magician, Lover, and a book exploring each of these four archetypes.

25|$|Evidence from {{neurogenesis}} (formation of new neurons) studies <b>on</b> <b>male</b> rats {{has shown}} that the hippocampus is a useful brain region to examine when determining the effects of androgens on behavior. To examine neurogenesis, wild-type male rats were compared with male rats that had testicular feminization mutation (TMF), a genetic disorder resulting in complete or partial insensitivity to androgens and a lack of external male genitalia.|$|E
25|$|In modern times, {{despite the}} formal disapproval of {{religious}} authority, the segregation {{of women in}} Muslim societies and the strong emphasis <b>on</b> <b>male</b> virility leads adolescent males and unmarried young men to seek sexual outlets with boys younger than themselves—in one study in Morocco, with boys in the age-range 7 to 13. Men have sex with other males {{so long as they}} are the penetrators and their partners are boys, or in some cases effeminate men.|$|E

25|$|Often the {{greatest}} concern {{with respect to}} varicocele is its effect <b>on</b> <b>male</b> fertility. The relationship between varicocele and infertility is unclear; some men with the condition are fertile, some have sperm that are normal in shape and move normally, but are compromised in function, and some have sperm with abnormal shapes or that do not move well. Theories as to how variocele affects sperm function include damage via excess heat caused by the blood pooling and oxidative stress on sperm (ROS).|$|E
25|$|Other slang {{terms for}} oral sex include going down <b>on</b> (<b>male</b> or female), licking out and muff diving (female), blow job (male), dome (male or female), sucking off (male), playing the skin flute (male recipient), rolling cigars (male recipient), lolly-gagging (gay male-on-male), gaining {{knowledge}} (male recipient) and bust down (male). Forced fellatio {{is often called}} Egyptian rape or simply Egyptian; {{this goes back to}} the time of the Crusades when Mamluks were alleged to force their Christian captives to do this.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, {{a special}} {{procedure}} {{is required to}} obtain the pharmaceutical. In most other countries, a consent form is required which explains these risks. Women taking isotretinoin must not get pregnant during and for 1 month after the discontinuation of isotretinoin therapy. Sexual abstinence or effective contraception is mandatory during this period. Barrier methods by themselves (e.g., condoms) are not considered adequate due to the unacceptable failure rates of approximately 3%. Women who fall pregnant whilst on isotretinoin therapy are generally counselled to have a termination. Isotretinoin has no effect <b>on</b> <b>male</b> fertility.|$|E
50|$|Sexual {{dimorphism}} in {{this species}} {{is typical of}} many species in the Nannostomus genus. The anal fin of males is modified in shape in most populations, the male's fin being slightly elongated. It is the least evident in the Guyanese population. The white tips of the ventral and anal fins are invariably brighter and more prominent <b>on</b> <b>males.</b> Males are also usually slimmer in profile.|$|R
