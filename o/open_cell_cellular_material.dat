40|$|Purpose: {{the work}} {{presents}} an innovative approach {{for the production}} of <b>cellular</b> metallic <b>materials</b> as well as low density metal matrix composites, by using thixoforming techniques; thixotropic semisolid metal is infiltrated into removable and non-removable space holder preforms. Different kinds of preforms are tested to obtain <b>open</b> <b>cell</b> material (sponges), syntactic foams and low density composites. Products are evaluated concerning relative density and mechanical behavior under compressive stresses. Design/methodology/approach: Al alloy AA 2011 was infiltrated in the semisolid state into preforms of sintered NaCl particles, sintered glass spheres, vermicular ceramic particles and porous ceramic granulates. After solidification, preforms were either removed by leaching (NaCl) resulting in <b>open</b> <b>cell</b> <b>cellular</b> product, or not (all others), resulting in composites of low density. Tomography tests were used to observe internal quality, and semi-static and dynamic compression tests were performed to evaluate the deformation ability of the material. Findings: results show that thixoinfiltration is a simple and low cost technique to produce different types of low density, porous material. <b>Open</b> <b>cell</b> material as well as syntactic foams and low density composites can be produced with reliable internal quality and dispersion of cells and reinforcement. Composites containing porous reinforcements can present some mechanical characteristics of the conventional cellular metals. Research limitations/implications: as all new developments, the complete understanding of the influence of processing variables upon the final quality of the product, as well as its consistency, must be provided before the technology can be widely used commercially. Practical implications: the technique can represent an alternative, low cost processing route for the fabrication of sponges, foams and low density composites, which can avoid restrictions and operational difficulties of presently available manufacturing processes based in liquid manipulation or powder sintering methods. Originality/value: infiltration of appropriate preforms by thixotropic metallic alloys to produce low density composites and <b>cellular</b> <b>material</b> is a new technique under development by the proposing group at FEM/UNICAMP...|$|R

A Hürthle cell is larger than a follicular <b>cell,</b> and its <b>cellular</b> <b>material</b> stains pink. Hürthle cells {{also tend to be}} large, polygonal cells with distinct cell borders. The cytoplasm of the oncocytes in Hürthle cell adenomas and carcinomas is characterized by an eosinophilic granular nature, which is commonly due to the oncocytes' high content of mitochondria. Some of these cells can contain up to 5,000 mitochondria, which fills the cytoplasm to the point of nearly excluding other organelles. This high amount of mitochondria is reported to be a result of mutations in the mitochondrial DNA. Some scientists have identified these mutations as deletions in the mitochondrial DNA of Hürthle cells found in neoplasms and Hashimoto's thyroiditis.|$|R

The organic solvent dimethyl sulfoxide (Me 2 SO) {{is one of the most}} commonly utilized CPAs and has been used with various levels of success depending on the type of cells. In recent years, to improve cryogenic outcomes, the non-reducing disaccharide trehalose has been used as an additive to Me 2 SO-based freezing solutions. Trehalose is a naturally occurring non-toxic compound found in bacteria, fungi, plants, and invertebrates which has been shown to provide cellular protection during water-limited states. The mechanism by which trehalose improves cryopreservation outcomes remains not fully understood. Raman microspectroscopy is a powerful tool to provide valuable insight into the nature of interactions among water, trehalose, and Me 2 SO during cryopreservation. We found that the addition of trehalose to Me 2 SO based CPA solutions dramatically reduces the area per ice crystals while increasing the number of ice crystals formed when cooled to − 40 or − 80 °C. Differences in ice-formation patterns were found to have a direct impact on cellular viability. Despite the osmotic stress caused by addition of 100 mM trehalose, improvement in cellular viability was observed. However, the substantial increase in osmotic pressure caused by trehalose concentrations above 100 mM may offset the beneficial effects of changing the morphology of the ice crystals achieved by addition of this sugar...|$|R

The autophagy {{is thought to be}} a critical process for cancer stem cell (CSC) or tumor-initiating cell maintenance but the mechan-isms by which autophagy supports survival of CSCs remain poorly understood. In this study, inhibition of autophagy by knockdown of ATG 7 or BECN 1 modified the CD 44 þ/CD 24 low/ population in breast cancer cells by regulating CD 24 and IL 6 secretion. In a breast cancer cell line that is independent of autophagy for survival, autophagy inhibition increased IL 6 secre-tion to themedia. On the other hand, in an autophagy-dependent cell line, autophagy inhibition decreased IL 6 secretion, cell sur-vival, and mammosphere formation. In these cells, IL 6 treatment or conditioned media from autophagy-competent cells rescued the deficiency inmammosphere formation induced by autophagy inhibition. These results reveal that autophagy regulates breast CSC maintenance in autophagy-dependent breast cancer cells by modulating IL 6 secretion implicating autophagy as a potential therapeutic target in breast cancer. Implications: Modulation of autophagy in breast cancer has different and even opposite effects, indicating the need for a selection strategy when trying to manipulate autophagy in the context of cancer therapy.

This neural phenotypic plasticity allows us to consider the utilization of mesenchymal stem <b>cells</b> as <b>cellular</b> <b>material</b> in regenerative medicine. In this study, we demonstrate that cultured adult rat stromal cells can express nestin, an intermediate filament protein predominantly expressed by neural stem cells. Two factors contribute to the regulation of nestin expression by rat stromal cells: serum in the culture medium inhibits nestin expression and a threshold number of passages must be reached below which nestin expression does not occur. Only nestin-positive rat stromal cells are able to form spheres when they are placed in the culture conditions used for neural stem cells. Likewise, only nestin-positive stromal cells are able to differentiate into GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein) -positive cells when they are co-cultivated with neural stem cells. We thus demonstrated that adult rat stromal cells in culture express nestin in absence of serum after passaging the cells at least ten times, and we suggest that nestin expression by these cells might be a prerequisite for the acquisition of the capacity to progress towards the neural lineage.

Auxetic <b>cellular</b> <b>materials</b> are characterised by a negative Poisson's ratio expanding in all directions when pulled in only one, therefore behaving in an unusual manner compared to conventional materials. Auxetic <b>open</b> <b>cell</b> foams were shown to have unusual acoustic absorption properties particularly at lower frequencies compared to their conventional counterparts. The main objective {{of this study is to}} obtain a better understanding of the acoustic behaviour of auxetic <b>open</b> <b>cell</b> PU foams by performing a combined numerical and experimental analysis. Wave propagation through foams was modelled using a homogenisation approach based on Biot's theory. A method to evaluate Biot's Poroelastic Parameters describing the foam's Static and Dynamic properties was proposed. The structural response of conventional and auxetic foams under loading conditions was studied by evaluating Biot's static poroelastic coefficients.

30|$|The {{major step}} of the {{separation}} process is the extraction of PHA granules (Jacquel et al. [2008]). Extraction using solvents such as chloroform, methylene chloride, propylene carbonate and dichloroethane resulted in very pure PHA (Ramsay et al. [1994]). This extraction method required large quantities of toxic and volatile solvent, which not only increased the total production cost but also had adverse environmental consequences ([Choi and Lee 1997]). During digestion of non-PHA <b>cellular</b> <b>materials</b> using hypochlorite, severe degradation of PHA was observed. An enzymatic digestion method developed by Zeneca {{was used for the}} production of Biopol (PHBV) but the use of expensive chemicals and complex processes {{did not seem to be}} economical ([Holmes and Lim 1990]). The extraction {{step of the}} described procedure consumed no energy and lesser quantities of chemicals compared to other recovery methods such as solvent and supercritical fluid extraction, digestion by sodium hypochlorite and enzymes as well as mechanical disruption of cell walls by high-pressure homogenization and ultrasonication (Jacquel et al. [2008]). As the PHA granules themselves do not contain much contaminant (Steinbüchel et al. [1995]), highly pure PHA can be produced by processes that break the <b>cell</b> and solubilize <b>cellular</b> <b>material</b> other than PHA. Therefore, a simple digestion method by inexpensive chemicals seems to be the most efficient and economical recovery process. Subsequent purification steps were essential to obtain a high-purity product. Surfactant pre-treatment and hypochlorite digestion under optimized conditions resulted in a very pure PHB with less degradation (Choi and Lee, [1999]) and was applied for post-extraction purification in the present study.|$|R

Because of their cellular structure, they have unusual mechanical properties: {{they can be}} stiff, yet light, and {{they are capable of}} absorbing large deflections and thus large amounts of energy. Yet their mechanical behaviour has hardly been studied: no comprehensive attempt to relate mechanical properties to structure exists. In this thesis, we have attempted to do this. We first model a <b>cellular</b> <b>material</b> as a simple, two-dimensional array of hexagonal cells and identify and analyze the mechanisms by which it deforms. From this we calculate the elastic moduli and the elastic and plastic collapse stresses for ideal two-dimensional <b>cellular</b> <b>materials.</b> The results (which we have experimentally verified) show that each of these properties depends on three parameters: a solid cell wall material property, a geometric constant, and the relative density of the <b>cellular</b> <b>material</b> raised to the power two or three. We then examine three-dimensional <b>cellular</b> <b>materials.</b> Because their geometry is irregular and very complicated, no exact analysis of their behaviour is possible. But, with our understanding of two dimensional <b>cellular</b> <b>materials</b> and how they deform, we can use dimensional arguments to analyze three-dimensional <b>cellular</b> <b>materials.</b> The results of this analysis agree well with experimental data.

40|$|Corrugated Wire Mesh Laminates (CWML) are <b>open</b> <b>cell</b> type <b>cellular</b> {{structures}} {{manufactured by}} bonding {{several layers of}} metallic corrugated wire meshes {{on top of each}} other. Due to their <b>open</b> <b>cell</b> structure and the mechanical properties of the parent material, CWML can offer high stiffness and strength per unit weight. Therefore, they have many potential applications where lightweight and high rigidity and strength are required, such as in sandwich constructions in mechanical and aerospace engineering, and orthopaedic implants in biomedical engineering. The main loading in such applications is transverse compression, occasionally accompanied by in-plane shear. This thesis presents an attempt to understand and characterise the behaviour of corrugated wire mesh laminates under transverse compression loading. First, a theoretical model is developed for the CWML using a truss structure to approximate the corrugated wire. Although simplistic, this model is useful in establishing expressions for the relative density, effective transverse stiffness and transverse compressive strength of the CWML. The influences of wire diameter, opening width, and the corrugation angle on these parameters are established. A new method is developed for the fabrication of CWML at a relatively low temperature of 225 degrees Celsius making it significantly simpler and cost effective compared to existing methods. For the first time, a finite element model is developed to numerically simulate the deformation behaviour of CWML under transverse compression and shear loading. The numerical model investigates the effects of nonlinearities such as material nonlinearity, large deformation behaviour, curvature {{at the tip of the}} corrugations and friction. Experimental testing is conducted on several samples of single layer, two layer, and four layer wire mesh laminates under transverse compression and separately under shear loading. The test results show considerable scatter probably due to variations in the quality of the bonding in the manufacturing process. The load deflection behaviours of the single and multi layer laminates observed in the tests are compared to those analytically determined by the numerical simulations. Unfortunately, the agreement between the numerical analysis and the experimental results is rather poor; this is attributed to the bends in the wires as they cross over each other in the mesh, which were not modelled in the simulation. The finite element (FE) model, therefore, requires further improvement; nevertheless, it does provide significant insight into aspects that influence the deformation behaviour of CWML...|$|R

In this paper, the authors investigate the use of Three-Dimensional Printing (3 DP) to manufacture metallic <b>cellular</b> <b>materials</b> by selectively printing binder into a bed of metal oxide ceramic powder. The resulting green part undergoes a thermal chemical post-process in order to convert it to metal.

40|$|Due {{to their}} {{mechanical}} properties, <b>cellular</b> <b>material</b> structures {{are often used}} in automotive, aerospace, ship and railway industries, as elements for deformational energy absorption. New advanced <b>cellular</b> <b>material</b> structures have been evaluated and characterised in {{the scope of this}} study in order to determine their energy absorption capability through the deformation process. Parametric computational simulations in the framework of the finite element method have been used for this purpose. Newly developed computational models of regular open-cell <b>cellular</b> <b>material</b> structures considering viscous pore fillers have been developed and their response under impact conditions was analysed using the explicit code LS-DYNA. The results of the performed study show that introduction of viscous fillers indeed increases the energy absorption capability of open-cellular material structures. Additionally, it was determined that the size of the <b>cellular</b> <b>material</b> (number of <b>cells)</b> dramatically influences the cellular structure response and that the filler influence is stronger in cellular structures with higher relative density...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to design {{isotropic}} periodic microstructures of <b>cellular</b> <b>materials</b> using the bidirectional evolutionary structural optimization (BESO) technique. The goalwas to determine the optimal distribution of material phase within the periodic base cell. Maximizing bulk modulus or shear moduluswas selected as the objective of the material design subject to an isotropy constraint and a volume constraint. The effective properties of the material were found using the homogenization method based on finite element analyses of the base cell. The proposed BESO procedure utilizes the gradient-based sensitivity method to impose the isotropy constraint and gradually evolve the microstructures of <b>cellular</b> <b>materials</b> to an optimum. Numerical examples show the computational efficiency of the approach. A series of new and interesting microstructures of isotropic <b>cellular</b> <b>materials</b> that maximize the bulk or shear modulus have been found and presented. The methodology can be extended to incorporate other material properties of interest such as designing isotropic <b>cellular</b> <b>materials</b> with negative Poisson&# 039;s ratio...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} computational modelling {{of regular}} closed-cell <b>cellular</b> <b>materials</b> behaviour when subjected to impact loading conditions. Parametric computational simulations {{have been carried}} out to evaluate influences of the relative density, strain rate, pore gas and gas type on the macroscopic dynamic behaviour of <b>cellular</b> <b>materials.</b> The behaviour of the model under uniaxial impact loading conditions and large deformations has been analysed with the LS-DYNA code, which is based on the finite element method. This study helps to clarify which effects are indeed important and would have to be considered in developing new homogenised constitutive relationships for analysing impact problems with use of general computational codes. Additionally, the detailed computational models provide an insight into behaviour of <b>cellular</b> <b>material</b> accounting for pore filler and basic constitutive relations for further development of homogenised models under impact conditions and large deformations. Furthermore, they allow for determination of most appropriate geometrical and <b>material</b> parameters of <b>cellular</b> <b>materials</b> in regard to individual engineering application demands. ...|$|R
