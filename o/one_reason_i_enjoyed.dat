40|$|Thank you, Chris, {{for that}} generous introduction. And thanks to Matt, Günter, Chris and Thomas for {{organizing}} {{such a great}} conference. <b>I</b> always <b>enjoy</b> being able to step back into the research world for a while – as things are going these days, it falls {{in the category of}} rest and relaxation! But another <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> <b>enjoy</b> doing so is that I, like most modern centra...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, he isn't," [...] said Honora, rather breathlessly; [...] "that's the <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> came here. That's <b>one</b> <b>reason,</b> <b>I</b> mean. I {{was coming}} to see you this morning, but I simply didn't {{have time for a}} call after I got to town." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{do that at}} once, by {{telephone}}. That's <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> came over. I'll telephone the steamship office {{while the}} girl is getting ready." ...|$|R
2500|$|Recalling Ali's anti-war position, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar said: [...] "I {{remember}} the teachers at {{my high school}} didn't like Ali {{because he was so}} anti-establishment and he kind of thumbed his nose at authority and got away with it. The fact that he was proud to be a black man and that he had so much talent... made some people think that he was dangerous. But for those very <b>reasons</b> <b>I</b> <b>enjoyed</b> him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he answered, [...] "for <b>one</b> <b>reason,</b> <b>I</b> {{generally}} call {{here when}} I'm {{going to the}} bluff. It's convenient to get there for supper." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hadn't {{a notion}} that you disliked him," [...] said Austen. [...] "I am curious about his career; that's <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> came down. He somehow inspires curiosity." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{on account}} of my red hair," [...] she {{explained}} smiling. [...] "I do not care for red hair myself, which is <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> usually wear other forms." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I meant {{his visit}} to the Farquhar {{homestead}} when I told him about Lucy; but I'll try to answer you. For <b>one</b> <b>reason,</b> <b>I</b> wanted to make amends for my previous--rashness." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{she said}} slowly, [...] "I can't {{denounce}} your folly, {{as they call}} your decision to go North. For <b>one</b> <b>reason,</b> <b>I</b> have no right of any kind to force my views on you." ...|$|R
5000|$|Says Griffith, [...] "Jim Rooney is {{the number}} <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> have a career. He gave me {{confidence}} in my writing, inspiration to write, and handed me the want ads to look for an apartment in Nashville." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you can't {{say that}} I'm not honest. It is {{positively}} my only virtue. I adore the truth. I loathe a lie. That is <b>one</b> <b>reason,</b> <b>I</b> daresay, why I can only barely tolerate you. You are a shocking--a gross liar." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, {{and that}} is <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> don't want to give her up; it seems so sad to send Maurice's child away leaving such an impression. One thing I am. thankful for, {{that it will be}} all over before grandmamma and Bessie Merrifield come.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you again, Peter," [...] cried Dotty, [...] "and {{please let}} me return the compliment. I like cold weather. I like winter when there isn't too much ice and bad weather. I always feel good in cold weather. That is <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> go north to nest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To be sure!" [...] responded Nerle. [...] "Let us hope, at any rate, that {{we shall}} suffer more privations and {{encounter}} more trouble than we did in that mountainous Kingdom of Spor." [...] Then he added: [...] "For <b>one</b> <b>reason,</b> <b>I</b> regret you are my master." ...|$|R
5000|$|In a 2009 {{interview}} with IFC, Kurosawa {{talked about the}} reason why he has cast the actor Koji Yakusho in many of his films: [...] "He has similar values and sensitivities. We’re from the same generation. That’s a big <b>reason</b> why <b>I</b> <b>enjoy</b> working {{with him on the}} set." ...|$|R

5000|$|... {{government}} policies must be predictable and certain. Both consumers and producers need policies they {{can count on}} so they can plan ahead. This is <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> am working with the Congress {{to create a new}} Department of Energy, to replace more than 50 different agencies that now have some control over energy.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why,' said Captain Charteris, 'I hardly know. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> came alone was, that I {{believe that}} little elf of a Cilly has some {{notion of what}} is {{plotting}} against her. You can't speak a word but that child catches up, and she will not let her father out of her sight for a moment.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Commenting on {{rumors about}} her life, Hunt said of an {{apocryphal}} story: [...] "You must have read {{that on the}} internet. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> haven't had it removed {{is that it is}} proof that the Internet is full of absolute bullshit. Ridiculous things have been written about me so often that we won't even go there." ...|$|R
6000|$|Godfrey Palliser smiled curiously. “Tony {{has many}} likable qualities, {{but he is}} weak,” he said. “That, my dear is <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> am glad {{that he is going}} to marry you, for it is a burden I shall, I think very shortly, {{bequeath}} him. You will help him to lighten it, as well as bear it honorably.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "DEAR WILSON,--In every letter I {{tell you}} I'm better! Why, pretty soon there'll be {{nothing left to}} say about my health. I've been up and around now for days, but only lately have I begun to gain. Since Jack has been away I'm getting fat. I eat, and that's <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> suppose. Then I move around more.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> did it," [...] said I. [...] "I didn't want {{to fight}} him as I should have fought a fellow of my own size. I wanted to punish him. Do you think that when a father wants to whip his son he ought to wait until he grows up as big as he is?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> {{have not}} {{answered}} sooner is because your letter was so sweet and loving {{that it made}} me feel an ungrateful and unappreciative wretch. Another is that this life I now lead does not induce writing. I am outdoors all day, and when I get back to this cabin at night I am too tired for anything but bed.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Victoria, [...] "I {{was afraid}} you wouldn't. And moreover, you never would. There is no use in my {{trying to make}} myself any clearer, and you'll {{have to keep your}} appointment. I {{hesitate}} to contradict you, but I am not the kind of woman you want. That is <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> cannot marry you. And the other is, that I do not love you." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{music critic}} Robert Christgau, who had {{previously}} criticized the alleged misogyny of Nixon's song [...] "Stuffin' Martha's Muffin'", gave Root Hog or Die an A-, calling it [...] "Nixon's finest artistic achievement". However, he was unimpressed with Roper's cuts, calling them [...] "the usual yawn" [...] and commenting that [...] "Mojo's loyalty to his partner, who has-his-own-album-out God-help-us, is <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> think he's got a good heart." ...|$|R
6000|$|Brooke smiled curiously. [...] "Of course! That is <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why <b>I</b> {{am pleased}} you sent for me. This, you see, brings {{it back to}} me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, {{there is}} no use in {{dwelling}} on this,' he said, quietly. 'The <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> asked you to be kind enough to come here, is that I {{do not think it}} well to be far from home under the circumstances. There, don't look frightened--they say it may very possibly not come for several months or a year. I hope to have time to put things a little in order for you, and that is <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> wished to see you; I thought I could make the beginning easier to you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't," [...] replied Whitefoot. [...] "I sleep most of {{the time}} during the day, and work and play at night. I feel safer then. But on dull days I often come out. It is the bright {{sunlight}} I don't like. That is <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> stick to the Green Forest. I don't see how Cousin Danny stands it out there on the Green Meadows. Now I guess it is his turn." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I guess you're right there," [...] {{answered}} Dave. [...] "And that's <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> {{think we}} ought to try to get back to Crumville. But just the same, I'd hate to get stuck somewhere along the road, as he says. We boys {{might be able to get}} out of it along with Wash, but we couldn't expect the girls to do any tramping in such deep snow and in such a wind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The last news I had {{indicated}} that I was wanted," [...] he replied. [...] "After all, {{there is only}} <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why <b>I</b> have abused Mrs. Chisholm's hospitality so long." ...|$|R
50|$|I {{want you}} to hear me tonight, I am not saying that President Obama is the Antichrist, I am not saying that at all. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> know he's not the Antichrist is the Antichrist is going to have much higher poll numbers when he comes. President Obama is not the Antichrist. But what I am saying is this: the course he is {{choosing}} to lead our nation is paving the way for the future reign of the Antichrist.|$|R
6000|$|... "There, then!" [...] I flung her Mark's letter. There wasn't {{anything}} {{in it that}} it was sacrilege to let another person see. That was <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why <b>I</b> had been crying.|$|R
6000|$|... "The joke {{of it is}} that I, too, {{am being}} watched whereever I go. That fellow Streuss has spies everywhere. That is <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why <b>I</b> believe that Von Behrling was serious.|$|R
40|$|A key {{application}} of user-visible hardware performance counters {{is to give}} the software developer clear, accurate, and useful hardware-related performance information. This information provides guidance on software changes that can improve performance. An intuitively appealing way to represent the major performance components is to quantify their contributions to the average cycles per instruction (CPI). However, for out-of-order superscalar processors, conventional performance counters don’t provide the type of information from which software developers can determine accurate CPI components. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>i...</b>|$|R
5000|$|During {{the height}} of the TV show's popularity, the Maverick {{brothers}} starred in a comic book drawn by Dan Spiegle. [...] Spiegle met Garner at the studio before the first Maverick comic was drawn because no publicity photographs were available yet. Spiegle talked in an interview about comic books he had drawn:I would say my favorite was Maverick, which ran about three years— fairly successful, considering the run of other western strips published then. I was assigned this strip even before they had stills available for the show, so I was sent down to Warner Bros. to see it in production, where I met James Garner, which is perhaps the <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> <b>enjoyed</b> it so much. Having met the star, I was extra careful to make the drawings I did look as parallel to the real person as possible. I put my all into that strip, having fun all the way.|$|R
5000|$|Spiegle {{began work}} on Maverick comics before any {{publicity}} photographs of series star James Garner were available, so he met the actor on the set and the resultant drawings of Garner in the subsequent comics are eerily exact. In 1972, Spiegle explained in an interview: I would say my favorite was Maverick, which ran about three years — fairly successful, considering the run of other western strips published then. I was assigned this strip even before they had stills available for the show, so I was sent down to Warner Bros. {{to see it in}} production — where I met James Garner, which is perhaps the <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> <b>enjoyed</b> it so much.
