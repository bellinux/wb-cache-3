Odenkirk drew inspiration for Goodman from film producer Robert Evans. I thought about Robert Evans because I've listened to The Kid Stays in the Picture on CD. He's constantly switching up his cadence and his delivery. He emphasizes interesting words. He has loads of attitude {{in almost every}} line that he says. So when I rehearse the scenes alone I do my impersonation of Robert Evans to find those moments and turns. Then I go <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> do Saul.|$|E

In an interview with Ben Fong-Torres of Rolling Stone, Charles said of the similarities between the blues and country music, [...] "he words to country songs are very earthy like the blues, see, very down. They're not as dressed up, and the people are very honest and say, 'Look, I miss you, darlin', so I went <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> got drunk in this bar.' That's the way you say it.

500|$|Among the Canadians, {{only two}} players were not suspended: goalie Jimmy Waite and forward Pierre Turgeon. [...] Waite {{felt he could}} not risk being ejected for {{fighting}} under {{the belief that the}} game would resume, and that the Canadian backup goaltender, Shawn Simpson, was injured. [...] Steve Nemeth would later apply for early reinstatement arguing that he was not fighting, but trying to help break the players apart.

500|$|In 1984, American Continental Corporation bought Lincoln Savings and Loan Association {{for just}} over $50 million. Up {{through the early}} 1980s, Lincoln had been a conservatively-run enterprise, with almost half its assets in home loans and {{only a quarter of}} its assets {{considered}} at risk. It made slow growth at best, and had shown a loss for several years until it made a profit of a few million dollars in 1983. Once he took over, Keating fired the existing management. Savings and loan associations had been deregulated in the early 1980s, allowing them to make high-risk investments with their depositors' money, a change of which Keating and other savings and loan operators took advantage. When Keating later was asked why he got into savings and loans, he said, [...] "I know the business inside <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> always felt that an S & L, if they'd relax the rules, was the biggest moneymaker in the world." ...|$|E

[...] Wyman was originally supposed to direct several episodes the previous year and earlier in the season, but found he was too busy. He explained, [...] "Then an episode was coming up that we were thinking about writing and I really felt close to it. [...] The opportunity came up where somebody had fallen <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> felt {{that this is the}} perfect time because everything was completely under control.

Regarding her short financial disclosure reports prior to her Supreme Court nomination, she has said, [...] "When you don't have money, it's easy. There isn't anything there to report." [...] As a federal judge, she is entitled to a pension equal to her full salary upon retirement. Upon joining the Supreme Court, she took up residence in Washington but sorely missed the faster-paced life of New York. After renting in the Cleveland Park neighborhood for three years, in 2012 she purchased a condominium in the U Street Corridor. She said, [...] "I picked [...] because it's mixed.

You know, his addiction is obviously serious, drugs, and, but, Trump is just addicted to feeling important.

Taraborrelli felt that at that moment, riding on Madonna's coattails proved {{profitable}} for everyone involved, including Warner Bros.

But still they wanted to [...] "milk-in" [...] the success of Madonna, a view shared by Peter Guber and Jon Peters, executive producers of the film. Hence they felt a worldwide concert tour was the appropriate thing to do, since it would promote both the soundtrack and the film, as well as Madonna's successful third studio album True Blue, released the year before. As Madonna's first world tour, Who's That Girl ended up being a resounding success, although by its end, Madonna declared {{that she did not}} want to hear any of her songs again and she did not know whether she would ever write another one.

[...] The portion of the music video in which she enters the [...] "carnival-like" [...] scene drew influences from the 1950s and Hairspray.

His second dam, or maternal grandmother, was Leche, who was also fathered by Nick by Shiek P-11. The colt was named Skipper W because, as Wiescamp related:I had another good stud colt born {{around the same time}} as Skipper. He was a palomino sired by Gold Mount and out of Slipalong Wiescamp. That was also the year that the good movie, Showboat, came <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> named the little yellow colt after that picture. Anyway, I had Hired Girl up in a corral and, after she foaled, I told a fellow who was working for me to disinfect the naval on the colt [...] After the man did that, the colt got up and turned around and kicked him 'cause it smarted. I said to that fellow, [...] "Look at that, he already knows he's the boss! I've got a showboat, and every boat needs a skipper, so that's what I'm going to name him– Skipper."

500|$|De Fratus is {{a devout}} Roman Catholic who, {{though he was}} raised in a large Catholic family, {{struggled}} with his faith after an injury early in his career, but ultimately determined the injury was a gift from God to help him better understand his faith: [...] "I really feel that the setback was God telling me, ‘Hey you are not done. [...] You are not done yet figuring out what you need to figure <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> am {{going to give you a}} little more time.’ [...] There is a big reason why that injury happened and I feel that I used it as best as I could have." [...] He noted that he would like to take classes at a seminary to help proselytize to others. Early in his professional career, he struggled to find fellow Catholics, and noted that most of his teammates were either Protestants or not religious. Moreover, in many small towns that house minor league teams, there are no Catholic churches, so De Fratus found it easy to slide away from leading a Catholic lifestyle. However, upon realizing that there is more to life than material success, he discovered a need for God, and has thus developed his faith. Aside from his faith, he enjoys writing and recording music, and playing the guitar. He has two brothers, the older of whom, Steve, played in the minor leagues, and the younger of whom, Chris, caught a foul ball during De Fratus's major league debut.|$|E
500|$|Federal {{district}} judge David L. Bunning of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky, the judge {{assigned to the}} cases, held hearings with Davis in Ashland, at which {{she was the only}} witness. Davis argued tearfully that issuing licenses under her name violated her beliefs, citing her religious rights under the First Amendment: [...] "It wasn't just a spur-of-the-moment decision", she said. [...] "It was thought <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> sought God on it." [...] Davis had already decided against resigning from her post, as doing so, she said, would only leave the matter to her deputies: [...] "If I resign, I solve nothing. It helps nobody." [...] Governor Beshear stated that he would not call a special session of the General Assembly to address Davis' concerns, while other state legislators believed that such a session could accommodate Davis with possible new legislation. Davis' attorneys, from the Maitland, Florida-based law firm Liberty Counsel, stated that the plaintiffs were free to drive to other counties to obtain their same-sex marriage licenses, with one adding, [...] "This case is not about these plaintiffs' desires to get married, the case is about [...] desire to force Kim Davis to approve and authorize their marriage in violation of her constitutionally protected religious beliefs." [...] Davis and her attorneys then sued Governor Beshear for ordering her to violate her religious beliefs instead of trying to accommodate them, arguing that Beshear, not Davis, should be held accountable for any legal damages from the ACLU lawsuit.|$|E
500|$|Following his transfer, Garland {{opened his}} stint with La Salle on December 15, 2012 in a road game against Bucknell, scoring 9 points in 22 minutes {{off the bench}} and {{recording}} 2 turnovers and 4 personal fouls. He did not {{take part in the}} team's earlier games because he was ineligible due to NCAA regulations regarding player transfers. In the game that followed, he posted a career-best 26 points as a bench player in a win over Iona. He also added 3 rebounds, an assist, and a steal in the 23 minutes he was on the court. In a seven-minute stretch in the second half, Garland scored 14 straight points. He said after the game, [...] "I used to do it in high school. It kind of felt like high school when I was out there; it just felt good". Garland, who led the Explorers in scoring, also received praise from head coach John Giannini. On December 22, 2012, he had another impactful performance vs Sacred Heart, with six assists in 31 minutes of play. This was also his first-ever start under Giannini. The coach commented about Garland, [...] "He's a very underrated passer. People think because he scored all those points in high school he's a scorer first and foremost. I think he's a very good passer". However, this would be his sole start in his junior year at La Salle. Garland was effective in the opening, First Four round of the 2013 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament against Boise State, finishing with a team-high 22 points and, in turn, scoring 20 or more points for the second time as a junior. After the game, Giannini told Garland, [...] "This is why I chased you all over the place, to win NCAA tournament games and see if you could be a great player". On March 23, 2014, against the Ole Miss Rebels, Garland made a scooping layup off the backboard with 2.5 seconds left in regulation to send La Salle into the Sweet 16 round of the 2013 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. The game-winner was known as the [...] "Southwest Philly Floater," [...] following Garland's post-game comments, in which he said, [...] "That's the Southwest Philly Floater, man. Shoutout to my Cousin Bern, shoutout to my Mom". He made the shot in spite of defensive efforts from the Rebels' 6ft 9 in (2.06 m) center Reginald Buckner, who had blocked the Explorer multiple times in the game. Garland recalled the play, saying, [...] "Time was running <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> felt like I could get the drive. When I cut, I just saw an opening and took the ball up...I went in there and knew if I could get an open shot, I could make it". Following a defeat to Wichita State that ended the team's tournament run and their season, Garland was averaging 13.1 points, 2.1 rebounds, and 2 assists.|$|E
