5|$|A {{few days}} after the war began, the Chartered Company formed the Rhodesian Reserves, an {{amorphous}} entity intended to accommodate the many white men who were keen to put on uniform, as well as to make a start towards organising what might eventually become an expeditionary force. Eminent citizens and elected leaders formed their own platoons, each bringing 24 volunteers; three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>of</b> these 25-man troops made a company. Units representing the Caledonian Society, the Lancashire and Yorkshire Society, the Legion of Frontiersmen and other local organisations mirrored the Pals battalions in Britain. Volunteers could opt to serve overseas, within Rhodesia or only locally; around 1,000 had volunteered in all by 13 August.|$|E
5|$|Before the 2004 college {{football}} season, the Atlantic Coast Conference determined its champion via round-robin play {{during the course}} of the regular season and there was no conference championship game. In 2004, the Atlantic Coast conference added two teams—Virginia Tech and Miami—expanding the league to 11 teams. At the time, {{college football}} teams were limited by the NCAA to 11regular-season games, three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>of</b> which typically featured teams outside the home team's conference. Following the 2004season, the league added a 12th team—Boston College—and became eligible to hold a championship game at the conclusion of the 2005 season.|$|E
5|$|Dance formed his ships into a line {{of battle}} and ordered three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>of</b> them to raise blue ensigns and the others red, giving the {{impression}} of a heavy escort by implying that the ships with blue ensigns were warships. This ruse provoked a cautious response from Linois, who ordered his squadron to shadow the convoy without closing with them. During the night, Dance held position and Linois remained at a distance, unsure of the strength of the British convoy. At 09:00, Dance reformed his force into sailing formation to put distance between the two forces and Linois took the opportunity to attack, threatening to cut off the rearmost British ships. Dance tacked and his lead vessels came to the support of the rear, engaging Marengo at long range. Unnerved by the sudden British manoeuvere, Linois turned and retreated, convinced that the convoy was defended by an overwhelming force. Continuing the illusion that he was supported by warships, Dance ordered his ships to pursue Linois over the next two hours, eventually reforming and reaching the Straits of Malacca safely. There they were met several days later by two ships of the line sent from India.|$|E

First Lieutenant Charles Ellis, the company commander, {{attempted}} to rally his men but they crumbled under fire, retreating without orders. During the night everyone in E Company ran off the hill except Ellis and 11 men. Several E Company men fled through a mine field they had set up and were killed. North Korean fire pinned Ellis' men down after dawn on September 1. When three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>of</b> the group tried to escape, North Korean machine gun fire killed them. Ellis and the remaining men stayed in their foxholes on the hill for two days, repelling several attacks in that time. Ellis was then able to withdraw south, up the mountain to the 3rd Battalion's position. In his withdrawal, Ellis, discovering {{a man who had}} been injured earlier in a mine explosion, entered the mine field to rescue him.|$|E
5|$|Geologists {{believe that}} coast of western India {{came into being}} around 100 to 80mya after it broke away from Madagascar. Soon after its detachment, the peninsular region of the Indian plate drifted over the Réunion hotspot, a {{volcanic}} hotspot in the Earth's lithosphere near the island of Réunion. An eruption here some 66mya {{is thought to have}} laid down the Deccan Traps, a vast bed of basalt lava that covers parts of central India. This volcanic activity resulted in the formation of basaltic outcrops, such as the Gilbert Hill, that are seen at various locations in the city. Further tectonic activity in the region {{led to the formation of}} hilly islands separated by a shallow sea. Pleistocene sediments found near Kandivali in northern Mumbai by British archaeologist Todd in 1939 indicate habitation since the Stone Age. The present day city was built on what was originally an archipelago of seven islands of Bombay Island, Parel, Mazagaon, Mahim, Colaba, Worli, and Old Woman's Island (also known as Little Colaba). The islands were coalesced into a single landmass by the Hornby Vellard engineering project in 1784. By 1000 BCE, the region was heavily involved in seaborne commerce with Egypt and Persia. The Koli fishing community had long inhabited the islands. They were Dravidian in origin and included a large number of scattered tribes along the Vindhya Plateau, Gujarat, and Konkan. In Mumbai, there were three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>of</b> these tribes. Their religious practices could be summed up as animism.|$|E

25|$|In 1812 he {{was sitting}} in his rooms in the Analytical Society looking at a table of logarithms, which he knew to be full of mistakes, when the idea {{occurred}} to him of computing all tabular functions by machinery. The French government had produced several tables by a new method. Three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>of</b> their mathematicians decided how to compute the tables, half a dozen more broke down the operations into simple stages, and the work itself, which was restricted to addition and subtraction, was done by eighty computers who knew only these two arithmetical processes. Here, for the first time, mass production was applied to arithmetic, and Babbage was seized by the idea that the labours of the unskilled computers could be taken over completely by machinery which would be quicker and more reliable.|$|E
25|$|Buoyed by {{the recent}} victory in the Binh Gia {{campaign}} {{and the support of}} their major allies, North Vietnamese leaders began preparing a strategy to defeat South Vietnamese and United States military forces. Lê Duẩn, Secretary of the Communist Party, believed that the South Vietnamese regime was able to survive because they still had a strong army to rely upon. Therefore, to win the war and reunite the country, the South Vietnamese military had to be destroyed completely. Lê Duẩn believed the Communist forces must destroy three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>of</b> South Vietnam’s nine regular army divisions in a series of large battles, and pin down the eleven elite battalions of the South Vietnamese strategic reserve. Thus, North Vietnamese leaders decided to launch a summer offensive with the objective of defeating the South Vietnamese army by drawing them into battle repeatedly with numerous, geographically dispersed attacks.|$|E

500|$|Typical of most early jets, the Thunderjet's takeoff {{performance}} left {{much to be}} desired. In hot Korean summers with a full combat load, {{the aircraft}} routinely required 10,000ft (3,000m) of runway for takeoff even {{with the help of}} RATO bottles (two <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>of</b> these were carried, each producing 1,000lbf (4.4kN) of thrust for 14 seconds). All but the lead aircraft had their visibility obscured by the thick smoke from the rockets. Early F-84s had to be pulled off the ground at 160mph (140kn, 260km/h) with the control stick held all the way back. Landings were made at a similar speed, for comparison the North American P-51 Mustang landed at approximately 120mph (100kn, 190km/h). Despite the [...] "hot" [...] landing speeds, the Thunderjet was easy to fly on instruments and crosswinds did not present much of a problem.|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{limitations}} of the knee brace, Goebel led the Wolverines to victory in the first game played at Ohio Stadium. The official [...] "Dedication Day" [...] for the stadium was October 21, 1922, and the opponent was Michigan. Ohio State fans recalled for years afterward how Goebel and his teammate Harry Kipke managed to turn Dedication Day sour for the Buckeyes. Michigan shut out the Buckeyes, 19–0, with Goebel and Kipke scoring all the points. In the first period, Goebel blocked a punt and then kicked a long field goal from the 30-yard line for the game's first points. He also penetrated into the Ohio State backfield in the second quarter to recover a fumble. As the game wore on, the Buckeyes [...] "seemed to realize (Goebel's) importance in the Michigan lineup because he was forced to take plenty of punishment." [...] Football writer Billy Evans described Goebel's performance against Ohio State this way: [...] "No end in recent years has played a greater game (than) that which Goebel put up against Ohio State. For three periods Goebel was the mainspring of the Michigan eleven. He seemed to be in every play. It was always Goebel who was gumming things up for State. No man could go through an entire game at the speed with which Goebel played in the first three quarters. It was beyond the power of any human being. With a few minutes to play in the third period the big fellow practically collapsed. Even when three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>of</b> his teammates were carrying him off the field the old spirit was still there. He tried to induce his teammates {{that he was able to}} play, and tried to break away from their grasp, but the punch was gone and he was forced to give way as the big crowd cheered him to the echo. If any one man made possible the defeat of State by Michigan, it was Captain Paul Goebel." ...|$|E

[...] Robert Christgau of The Village Voice gave the album an A- rating, writing that [...] "Three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>of</b> these songs are faster and riffier than anything else in P. Jam's book, token experiments like [...] "Bugs" [...] are genuinely weird, and in an era of compulsory irony [...] sincerity is something like a relief—a Kurtlike relief at that." [...] David Browne of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B+. He said, [...] "Vitalogy marks the first time it's possible to respect the band's music as much as its stance." [...] He added that [...] "despite its musical advances, Vitalogy leaves an odd, unsettling aftertaste. You walk away from it energized, but wondering what price Eddie Vedder, and Pearl Jam, will ultimately pay for it." [...] Chicago Sun-Times writer Jim DeRogatis gave it three out of four stars and commended Pearl Jam for their earnest songwriting. However, DeRogatis also wrote that the album [...] "leaves you wishing that they'd just lighten up". USA Todays Edna Gundersen gave Vitalogy three and a half out of four stars and stated that it [...] "delivers the band's most compelling, inventive and confident music to date", while calling it [...] "the rebel yell of a band that is maturing without mellowing". Los Angeles Times critic Robert Hilburn gave Vitalogy four out of four stars and viewed its music as an improvement over Pearl Jam's previous work, writing [...] "This isn't just the best Pearl Jam album but a better album than the band once even seemed capable of making". AllMusic staff writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album four and a half out of five stars, saying, [...] "Pearl Jam are at their best when they're fighting, whether it's Ticketmaster, fame, or their own personal demons." [...] According to The New Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), [...] "By Vitalogy PJ hit their apex … the band's creative zenith, finding them doing a Led Zeppelin III on acoustic tracks like 'Corduroy' and turning in a Tom Waits-like weird attack on 'Bugs'".|$|E
