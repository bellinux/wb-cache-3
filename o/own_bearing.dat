Moghaddam, acting as chief designer, {{set out to find}} solutions to engineering problems he saw as inherent in the belt-driven suspended sub-chassis turntable design of Edgar Villchur, where the sub-chassis and tonearm are free to rotate. Moghaddam believed that the design generated undesirable torsional modes. One such torsional mode is said to be caused by [...] "groove drag" [...] – dynamic forces exerted by the stylus on the record as it tracked it. Moghaddam chose to attenuate the torsion by mounting the turntable-drive motor casing on its <b>own</b> <b>bearing.</b> The motor, mounted separately and tethered to a spring, is allowed limited rotation about its own axis; because the load varied with groove modulations, the increases in drag would thus be dampened by the spring-loaded motor, and the platter acceleration mitigated. In the words of Tufan Hashemi, Roksan Audio's managing director: [...] "We argued that using a suspended or floating surface to support a record could not allow it to be accurately read, as the record itself would be floating. We said that the record surface should remain stationary and solid but in complete isolation {{from the rest of the}} deck, and our design provided a very stable base for isolating a record without suspending it." ...|$|E

60|$|Phineas, {{though he}} had {{intended}} to show to Mrs. Bonteen how little {{he thought about the}} Duke of Omnium,--how small was his respect for a great peer who took no part in politics,--could not protect himself from a certain feeling of anxiety as to the aspect and gait and words of the man of whom people thought so much, of whom he had heard so often, and of whom he had seen so little. He told himself that the Duke of Omnium should be no more to him than any other man, but yet the Duke of Omnium was more to him than other men. When he came down into the drawing-room he was angry with himself, and stood apart;--and was then angry with himself again because he stood apart. Why should he make a difference in his <b>own</b> <b>bearing</b> because there was such a man in the company? And yet he could not avoid it. When he entered the room the Duke was standing in a large bow-window, and two or three ladies and two or three men were standing round him. Phineas would not go near the group, telling himself that he would not approach a man so grand as was the Duke of Omnium. He saw Madame Max Goesler among the party, and after a while he saw her retreat. As she retreated, Phineas knew that some words from Madame Max Goesler had not been received with the graciousness which she had expected. There was the prettiest smile in the world on the lady's face, and she took a corner on a sofa with an air of perfect satisfaction. But yet Phineas knew that she had received a wound.|$|E

50|$|His first {{appearance}} in the historical record is in a Greek charter of 1083, where he is named Βαλσωχερεζ (Balsocherez). His name in Latin charters commonly appears as Fulco de Basagerio, but the identification of Basagerio remains elusive. It could be Bazoches in the Nivernais, but more probably he was from Normandy, perhaps Bazoches-au-Houlme or Bazoches-sur-Hoëne. He was powerful enough to mint copper coins (follari) of his <b>own,</b> <b>bearing</b> the inscription FVLCVI DE BASACERS beneath a cross on one side, and two outward-facing busts with a cross {{between them and the}} letters RVC on the other. The busts probably represent Fulco and his lord, Roger Borsa, who is probably referenced by RVC. Some of Fulco's coins are overstruck on Salernitan and Amalfitan coins known to date from the 1090s. Probably these coins were minted with Roger's approval. It has been suggested that they were minted at Capua as late as 1134, after Fulco is recorded in that vicinity with Roger II, but such a late date is unlikely. Nor were the coins minted at Salerno, as once suggested.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe coal pillar {{is usually}} subject to mining {{influence}} on both sides. The loading distribution on coal pillar is unsymmetrical under the unilateral influence. Its <b>own</b> <b>bearing</b> characteristic {{is closely related}} to the surrounding rock structure. To determine the width of the pillar in coal mine, the dynamic stability of the pillar should be taken into account besides the consideration of the maximum static loading capacity. Theoretical calculating formula of the plastic zone of the coal pillar induced by one-sided mining is presented according to the limiting equilibrium theory in this paper. The unsymmetrical loading effect during the advancing process of the mining is analyzed through the field monitoring by the deployment of the stress sensors in the pillar along the longitudinal direction.

50|$|A {{revolving}} center, {{also known}} as a live center in some countries, is constructed so that the 60° center runs in its <b>own</b> <b>bearings</b> and is used at the non-driven or tailstock end of a machine. It allows higher turning speeds without the need for separate lubrication, and also greater clamping pressures. CNC lathes use this type of center almost exclusively and they may be used for general machining operations as well. Spring-loaded centers are designed to compensate for center variations, without damage to the work piece or center tip. This assures the operator of uniform constant tension while machining. Some live centers also have interchangeable shafts. This is valuable when situations require a design other than a 60° male tip. A live center, which may be hard or soft, is a plain center placed in the revolving mandrel - it moves therefore is live.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} problem of bearing {{measurement}} based distributed localization for sensor networks that are undirected and switching. Each node holds a local coordinate system with no knowledge about the global coordinate system and measures the bearing angle information about its neighbors in its local coordinate system. A novel scheme for localization is developed using a complex Laplacian to overcome the challenges due {{to the absence of}} a global coordinate system and the presence of topology switching in communication. First, by using bearing-only measurements, an algorithm is proposed to establish linear equation constraints for the coordinates of sensor nodes in the global coordinate frame. The main idea is that each node uses its <b>own</b> <b>bearing</b> and its neighbors' bearing information to construct a similar configuration, though it is not able to recover the true configuration by using only bearing measurements. Second, a distributed iterative algorithm is proposed such that all the sensor nodes can cooperatively find the true coordinates of themselves. It is shown that the algorithm exponentially converges, provided that the communication network jointly satisfies certain connectivity properties. The simulation results validate our proposed algorithm...|$|E
