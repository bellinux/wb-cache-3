500|$|Los Angeles Times Kenneth Turan, {{who felt}} {{the special effects}} were unusual, stated that Spielberg may {{actually}} have done his job in War of the Worlds [...] "better than he realizes", showing how fragile the world is. Turan claimed Spielberg raised a most provocative question: [...] "Is the ultimate fantasy an invasion from outer space, <b>or</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>the</b> survival of the human race?" [...] However, Broomfield Enterprises Dan Marcucci and Nancy Serougi did not share Berardinelli and Turan's opinion. They felt that Morgan Freeman's narration was unnecessary, and that the first half was [...] "great" [...] but the second half [...] "became filled with clichés, riddled with holes, and tainted by Tim Robbins".|$|E
500|$|The song [...] "All Hands on the Bad One" [...] {{features}} guitar riffs {{that are}} reminiscent of the band's second album, Call the Doctor. It {{was chosen as the}} title track because, according to guitarist Carrie Brownstein, it is the song that best represents the sentiment of the album. Brownstein explained that the song deals with [...] "your relationship to evil and your relationship to the hypocrisy of forcing a morality on someone else when you yourself are no better." [...] She added, [...] "'Ballad of the Ladyman', for instance—who is 'the ladyman'? Is the person that wants to be on the radio, 'the bad one,' <b>or</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>the</b> fans assuming that they [...] {{want to be on the}} radio—are they 'the bad one'? Or is 'The Professional,' the ominous professional figure, 'the bad one'? I think all these songs can go into that machine of 'the bad one' and that mentality and then be spit out in a bunch of different scenarios. So that's why I think it works as the title." ...|$|E

500|$|Various {{critics have}} written about the story's {{paradoxical}} themes of deformity and monstrosity. Not only does Henry Johnson suffer a literal and physical defacement that brands him a monster, but the Trescotts' suffer metaphorical loss of face when they are cast out by society. The trope of monstrosity takes on a second meaning when {{it becomes clear that}} the townspeople's actions make them more monstrous than the man they shun for his deformity; as professor and critic Lee Clark Mitchell asked in his essay, [...] "Face, Race, and Disfiguration in Stephen Crane's 'The Monster'", [...] "Is 'the monster' the disfigured black man <b>or</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>the</b> town that comes to dis-figure him?" [...] Similarly, Harold Bloom called The Monster an example of the [...] "invasion myth", made worse {{by the fact that the}} [...] "monster" [...] is born from within the townspeople's collective mind. Henry-the-monster is therefore [...] "generated by its fears of social instability, its prejudices about appearance (including racism), and its all-consuming passion for gossip and drama." [...] Trescott, the only man in town not to see Henry as an invader, also becomes ostracized by the frenzied small-town mentality.|$|E
