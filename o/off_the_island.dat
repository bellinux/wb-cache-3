5|$|Pyroclastic {{flows from}} an {{eruption}} would destroy much wildlife about the volcano. Gareloi has historically produced several pyroclastic flows, which can travel extremely fast. Future flows at Gareloi Volcano could travel <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> into the Pacific Ocean and, if large enough, could {{fall into the}} ocean and generate tsunamis, though unlikely.|$|E

Juliet is shown {{operating}} with Ethan and Goodwin (Brett Cullen) on a pregnant patient, Sabine, who dies; she is comforted by Goodwin. Juliet meets with Ben, and explains her theory that the problems with pregnant women happen at conception. She wants to test this theory by having a woman conceive <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>island,</b> but Ben refuses to let anyone <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>island.</b> When Juliet tells him that nothing else can be done and asks {{to go home and}} be with her sister, Ben informs Juliet that her sister's cancer has come back. He offers her a choice: either Juliet can go home and be with her sister as she dies, or she can stay and he will have Jacob cure her sister's cancer.|$|E
5|$|Bottlenose {{dolphins}} {{studied by}} Bottlenose Dolphin Research Institute researchers <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> of Sardinia show random social behavior while feeding, and their social behavior {{does not depend}} on feeding activity. In Sardinia, the presence of a floating marine fin-fish farm has been linked to a change in bottlenose dolphin distribution as a result of high fish density around the floating cages in the farming area.|$|E
5|$|Grouped into cooperatives, women play {{a leading}} role in the island's economy. Notably through microcredit, they engage in fishing-related activities, such as smoking fish and {{processing}} shrimp, oysters, and shellfish in general. As there is no industrial activity on the island (the closest such activity is in Ziguinchor), the island is experiencing a rural exodus of young people. They return to help their parents in the rice fields and participate in religious ceremonies during the dry season, but they tend to settle <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> permanently.|$|E

The U.S. forces were {{defending}} the Lunga perimeter, which guarded Henderson Field on Guadalcanal, that had been captured from the Japanese by the Allies in landings on Guadalcanal on 7 August 1942.

5|$|The main {{industries}} on Mersea are farming, {{fishing and}} servicing the leisure boating and yachting industry. Oysters have been harvested <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> since Roman times, and are shipped worldwide.

The Essex oyster fishery is opened by the Mayor of Colchester every September.|$|E

5|$|At dawn on 31 October 1991, the {{squadron}} sailed out of Dubrovnik {{to meet the}} Libertas convoya fleet of civilian vessels, the largest among them being the Jadrolinija shipping line's Slavija, which was endeavoring to deliver humanitarian aid to the city under siege. The fleet sailed from Rijeka and made several port calls, growing to 29 vessels as it approached Dubrovnik. The convoy, accompanied by the last President of Yugoslavia Stjepan Mesić and the Prime Minister of Croatia Franjo Gregurić, was stopped and searched by the Yugoslav Navy <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> of Mljet before {{the squadron}} linked up with the convoy and escorted it to Dubrovnik.

Sakamochi, however, reveals {{that he knows}} Nanahara and Nakagawa are alive and that his supposed execution of Noriko and Shuya was a ruse after he {{found a way to}} disable their collars, and attempts to kill Shogo. Shogo kills him as a hidden Nanahara and Nakagawa hijack the ship and kill the soldiers on board. As the boat sails towards the mainland, Shogo succumbs to his wounds sustained during the hijacking, and dies, but not before thanking Shuya and Noriko for being his friends.|$|E
5|$|Following the German {{capitulation}} in November 1918, Derfflinger was interned with {{a significant}} portion of the High Seas Fleet in Scapa Flow. On 21 June 1919, with the guard ships of the Royal Navy out on maneuvers, Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter ordered that the fleet be scuttled. The resulting scuttling of the German fleet saw some 66 vessels of various types sunk. Among those was Derfflinger, which sank at 14:45. The ship was raised in 1939 to be broken up for scrap metal, but the outbreak of World War II intervened. The ship, which remained capsized, was anchored <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> of Risa until 1946, at which point she was sent to Faslane Port, where she was broken up. The ship's bell was delivered to the German Federal Navy on 30 August 1965.|$|E

5|$|Following the Soviet {{capture of}} that city, the {{remaining}} crew detonated scuttling {{charges in the}} wreck on 21 March to further destroy the ship. After the war, the ship was raised during 1945–46 by the Soviet Navy and transferred to Tallinn. Although reference books long stated that she was scrapped there or in Marienburg, in actuality she was towed out in 1948 and beached for long-term use as a target in shallow water <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> of Osmussaar in the Gulf of Finland. Last used for target practice around 1966, the remains are now submerged. Her bell {{was held in the}} collection of the Military History Museum of the Bundeswehr in Dresden as of 1990.|$|E
5|$|Komet {{returned}} to Nauru following the unsuccessful attempt to mine Rabaul, and arrived <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> at 05:45 {{on the morning}} of 27December. After issuing a warning for those on shore to not use radio and signalling her intent to destroy the phosphate loading plant, she opened fire at 06:40. The bombardment lasted for about an hour, during which time the raider wrecked the loading plant, oil tanks, boats, buildings and mooring buoys. Following this attack, she sailed to the south-east and Nauru broadcast news of the attack to Australia. This was the last visit of German ships to Nauru during the war, and Komet transferred her activities to the Indian Ocean.|$|E
5|$|Léopard {{had been}} {{selected}} to convince the Vichy government of La Réunion to join the Free French in June, but the collision and her consequent repairs delayed her mission. On the night of 27/28 November, she arrived <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> with 80 troops aboard. They were landed successfully and seized control of Saint-Denis, Réunion, the island's capital, although the governor fled into the interior. A coast-defense battery engaged the contre-torpilleur and she fired back, with men killed on both sides. The Vichy hold-outs surrendered on the 30th and Léopard remained in the Indian Ocean escorting convoys until March 1943.|$|E

5|$|On 8 August, Goeben and Breslau met the collier <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> of Donoussa near Naxos, and {{two days}} later they entered the Dardanelles. To {{circumvent}} neutrality requirements, Germany transferred the two ships to the Ottoman Navy on 16 August, though the supposed sale was simply a ruse. On 23 September, Souchon accepted an offer to command the Turkish fleet. Breslau was renamed Midilli while Goeben was renamed Yavûz Sultân Selîm; their German crews remained with the ships and donned Ottoman uniforms and fezzes. The British did not accept {{the sale of the}} ships to the Ottoman Empire and stationed a blockading force outside the Dardanelles with orders to attack the ships if they appeared, regardless of the flag they flew.|$|E
5|$|On 8 March 1668, the Venetians were victorious in a hard-fought night battle <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> of St Pelagia, where 2,000 Ottoman {{troops and}} 12 galleys {{attempted}} to seize a small Venetian galley squadron. Forewarned of their intentions Morosini reinforced it, {{and won a}} costly victory, {{which was to be}} Venice's last victory at sea in this war. Reinforced again with Papal and Hospitaller ships, the Venetians maintained a blockade of Canea, the Ottomans' main supply base, during summer. To secure their anchorage off St Todero island, the allied forces seized the fortress island of St Marina, a minor success which did not in the end prevent the Kapudan pasha's fleet, bearing fresh troops and supplies, from reaching Canea in September, after the Maltese–Papal squadron had departed.|$|E
5|$|Prior to World War II she {{participated in}} several cruises to Mediterranean ports. During the German-led Axis {{invasion}} of Yugoslavia in April 1941, she {{was captured by}} Italian forces at the Bay of Kotor. Initially designated N1, her armament was changed and her conning tower modified. Due to her age and shallow diving depth, when she was commissioned into the Royal Italian Navy as Francesco Rismondo her service was limited to training and experimentation. She was scuttled <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> of Corsica by the Germans shortly after her capture in September 1943 following the Italian surrender.|$|E
