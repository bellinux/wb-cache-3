5|$|A {{representative}} {{piece of}} Mycenaean armor is the Dendra panoply (c. 1450–1400 BC) {{which consisted of}} a cuirass of a complete set made up of several elements of bronze. It was flexible and comfortable enough {{to be used for}} fighting on foot, while the total weight of the armor is around 18kg (about 40lb). Important evidence of Mycenaean armor has also been found in Thebes (c. 1350–1250 BC), which include a pair of shoulder guards, smaller than to those from Dendra, with additional plates protecting the upper arms, attached to the lower edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> guards.|$|E
50|$|Dislocations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulders</b> or hip joints are {{sometimes}} performed as a short novelty act by itself. One example is lifting the {{arm to the}} side until it passes behind the head and lies across <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulders.</b>|$|R

5|$|Injury to the {{accessory}} nerve {{can result in}} neck pain and weakness of the trapezius muscle. Symptoms will depend on at what point along its length the nerve was severed. Injury to the nerve can result in shoulder girdle depression, atrophy, abnormal movement, a protruding scapula, and weakened abduction. Weakness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> girdle can lead to traction injury of the brachial plexus. Because diagnosis is difficult, electromyogram or nerve conduction studies {{may be needed to}} confirm a suspected injury. Outcomes with surgical treatment appear to be better than conservative management, which entails physiotherapy and pain relief. Surgical management includes neurolysis, nerve end-to-end suturing, and surgical replacement of affected trapezius muscle segments with other muscle groups.|$|E
5|$|Strength {{testing of}} these muscles can be {{measured}} during a neurological examination to assess function of the spinal accessory nerve. Poor strength or limited movement are suggestive of damage, which can result {{from a variety of}} causes. Injury to the spinal accessory nerve is most commonly caused by medical procedures that involve the head and neck. Injury can cause wasting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> muscles, winging of the scapula, and weakness of shoulder abduction and external rotation.|$|E
5|$|Many {{aspects of}} the {{gameplay}} were reworked for this sequel. Some changes were made due to user feedback and others {{were meant to be}} included in previous games but were omitted either because of time or technological constraints. The camera was switched to the right analog stick of the DualShock controller instead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> buttons and the Gummi Ship travel was reworked. The combat system was completely redone and did not use any animations from the first game. Because Sora had matured, Nomura wanted his fighting style to reflect that. Other changes included more integration between exploration and battles. The variations in combat styles associated with each Drive Form and the introduction of the Reaction Command were added to give players more choices in battles. The inclusion of worlds based on live-action Disney films was aided by technology that generated the character models from live-action pictures.|$|E

5|$|Steel {{cylinders}} may {{be manufactured}} from steel plate discs, which are cold {{drawn to a}} cylindrical cup form, {{in two or three}} stages, and generally have a domed base if intended for the scuba market, so they cannot stand up by themselves. After forming the base and side walls, the top of the cylinder is trimmed to length, heated and hot spun to form the shoulder and close the neck. This process thickens the material <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder.</b> The cylinder is heat-treated by quenching and tempering to provide the best strength and toughness. The cylinders are machined to provide the neck thread and o-ring seat (if applicable), then chemically cleaned or shot-blasted inside and out to remove mill-scale. After inspection and hydrostatic testing they are stamped with the required permanent markings, followed by external coating with a corrosion barrier paint or hot dip galvanising.|$|E
5|$|The entire {{puddled iron}} {{armature}} designed by Gustave Eiffel was replaced. Low-carbon corrosion-resistant {{stainless steel bars}} that now hold the staples next to the skin are made of Ferralium, an alloy that bends slightly and returns to its original shape as the statue moves. To prevent the ray and arm making contact, the ray was realigned by several degrees. The lighting was again replaced—night-time illumination subsequently came from metal-halide lamps that send beams of light to particular parts of the pedestal or statue, showing off various details. Access to the pedestal, which had been through a nondescript entrance built in the 1960s, was renovated to create a wide opening framed {{by a set of}} monumental bronze doors with designs symbolic of the renovation. A modern elevator was installed, allowing handicapped access to the observation area of the pedestal. An emergency elevator was installed within the statue, reaching up to the level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder.</b>|$|E
5|$|The shoulderblade or scapula {{is short}} and wide, its length about 6.8 times the minimum width; this is a rare and basal trait within Tetanurae. Its top curves {{slightly}} to the rear in side view. On the lower outer side of the blade a broad ridge is present, running from just below the shoulder joint to about midlength where it gradually merges with the blade surface. The middle front edge over about 30% of its length is thinned forming a slightly protruding crest. The scapula constitutes about half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> joint, which is oriented obliquely sideways and to below. The coracoid is in all known specimens fused with the scapula into a scapulocoracoid, lacking a visible suture. The coracoid as such is an oval bone plate, with its longest side attached to the scapula. It is pierced by a large oval foramen but the usual boss for the attachment of the upper arm muscles is lacking.|$|E

5|$|There {{are three}} main muscle {{groups of the}} forelimb. The triceps muscle {{straightens}} the elbow and foreleg, running from the elbow to the bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> blade. The muscles which extend the lower leg are called extensor muscles, while the flexion of the lower leg joints is achieved through movement of the flexor muscles. There are five main muscles and muscle groups in the hind legs. The vastus muscle flexes the hind leg and runs from stifle to hip, while the gluteal muscles, the large muscles in the hip, extend the femur. Forward motion and flexion of the hind legs is achieved through {{the movement of the}} quadriceps group of muscles {{on the front of the}} femur, while the muscles at the back of the hindquarters, called the hamstring group, provide forward motion of the body and rearward extension of the hind limbs. Extension of the hock is achieved by the Achilles tendon, located above the hock.|$|E
