Other views suggest gain of toxic function by PrPSc due to sequestration of PrPC-associated metals within the aggregates, resulting in the generation of redox-active PrPSc complexes. The physiological implications of some PrPC-metal interactions are known, while others are still unclear. The pathological implications of PrPC-metal interaction include metal-induced <b>oxidative</b> <b>damage,</b> and in some instances conversion of PrPC to a PrPSc-like form.|$|E

40|$|A {{critical}} role of oxidative stress has {{been implicated in}} ischemic brain damage. Mild ischemic pretreatment and/or synthesis of heat shock proteins (HSPs) has been suggested to protect against <b>oxidative</b> brain <b>damage.</b> However, experimental support of this suggestion {{have proven to be}} difficult partly because sensitive indices to assess oxidative consequences of ischemic brain damage were few. In this study, we have attempted to establish biochemical assay systems to quantitate <b>oxidative</b> brain <b>damage</b> following ischemia. We produced experimental brain ischemia in the Mongolian gerbil (Meriones unguiculatus) and examined the hippocampus for ischemic brain damage. The results obtained from ischemic gerbil hippocampus demonstrated that <b>oxidative</b> brain <b>damage</b> can be quantitated by determining glutathione oxidation ratio together with the accumulation of the <b>oxidative</b> DNA <b>damage</b> product, 8 -hydroxy- 2 '-deoxyguanosine (8 ohdG). Our results also demonstrated a role for mild ischemic pretreatment and synthesis of HSPs against <b>oxidative</b> brain <b>damage.</b> We showed that mild 2 -min ischemic pretreatment reduced the degree of both glutathione oxidation ratio and 8 ohdG accumulation in gerbil hippocampus subsequent to 10 min ischemic challenge. We also showed that the accumulation of HSP 70 was closely associated with the reduction of <b>oxidative</b> brain <b>damage.</b> To our knowledge, this is the first report to investigate glutathione redox states and <b>oxidative</b> DNA <b>damage</b> levels to evaluate a protective role of mild ischemic pretreatment and HSP synthesis following brain ischemia.

5|$|Similar {{mechanisms}} {{exist to}} promote the degradation of oxidatively damaged proteins via the proteasome system. In particular, proteasomes localized to the nucleus are regulated by PARP and actively degrade inappropriately oxidized histones. Oxidized proteins, which often form large amorphous aggregates in the cell, can be degraded directly by the 20S core particle without the 19S regulatory cap and do not require ATP hydrolysis or tagging with ubiquitin. However, high levels of <b>oxidative</b> <b>damage</b> increases the degree of cross-linking between protein fragments, rendering the aggregates resistant to proteolysis. Larger numbers and sizes of such highly oxidized aggregates are associated with aging.|$|E
5|$|From {{about three}} billion years ago, prokaryotic selenoprotein {{families}} drive {{the evolution of}} selenocysteine, an amino acid. Selenium is incorporated into several prokaryotic selenoprotein families in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes as selenocysteine, where selenoprotein peroxiredoxins protect bacterial and eukaryotic cells against <b>oxidative</b> <b>damage.</b> Selenoprotein families of GSH-Px and the deiodinases of eukaryotic cells {{seem to have a}} bacterial phylogenetic origin. The selenocysteine-containing form occurs in species as diverse as green algae, diatoms, sea urchin, fish, and chicken. Selenium enzymes are involved in the small reducing molecules glutathione and thioredoxin. One family of selenium-bearing molecules (the glutathione peroxidases) destroys peroxide and repairs damaged peroxidized cell membranes, using glutathione. Another selenium-bearing enzyme in some plants and in animals (thioredoxin reductase) generates reduced thioredoxin, a dithiol that serves as an electron source for peroxidases and also the important reducing enzyme ribonucleotide reductase that makes DNA precursors from RNA precursors.|$|E
5|$|The {{result of}} {{breathing}} increased partial pressures of oxygen is hyperoxia, {{an excess of}} oxygen in body tissues. The body is affected in different ways {{depending on the type}} of exposure. Central nervous system toxicity is caused by short exposure to high partial pressures of oxygen at greater than atmospheric pressure. Pulmonary and ocular toxicity result from longer exposure to increased oxygen levels at normal pressure. Symptoms may include disorientation, breathing problems, and vision changes such as myopia. Prolonged exposure to above-normal oxygen partial pressures, or shorter exposures to very high partial pressures, can cause <b>oxidative</b> <b>damage</b> to cell membranes, collapse of the alveoli in the lungs, retinal detachment, and seizures. Oxygen toxicity is managed by reducing the exposure to increased oxygen levels. Studies show that, in the long term, a robust recovery from most types of oxygen toxicity is possible.|$|E

40|$|This {{work has}} been focused on the study of <b>oxidative</b> DNA <b>damage</b> induced with {{hydrogen}} peroxide and on the relationship of this damage to cytotoxic effect. The repair of the <b>oxidative</b> DNA <b>damage</b> and the cell survival was followed both in normal Chinese hamster cells and their mutant derivative UV- 20. The modified single cell gel electrophoresis (the comet assay,) was used to estimate the DNA damage. The cytotoxiciy was measured using the inhibition of colony forming capacity of cells. Both normal AA 8 and mutant UV- 20 cells repair the <b>oxidative</b> DNA <b>damage</b> with approximately the same velocity, and they show also the same sensitivity towards the hydrogen peroxide. These results indicate, that the defect in the nucleotide excision DNA repair in UV- 20 cells does not play any important role in the response of these cells to the <b>oxidative</b> DNA <b>damage,</b> and therefore this mechanism is not involved in the removal of this damage. This may indicate, that the main mechanism of the repair of <b>oxidative</b> DNA <b>damage</b> is the base excision repair.

5|$|When {{the amount}} of copper in the liver overwhelms the {{proteins}} that normally bind it, it causes <b>oxidative</b> <b>damage</b> through {{a process known as}} Fenton chemistry; this damage eventually leads to chronic active hepatitis, fibrosis (deposition of connective tissue) and cirrhosis. The liver also releases copper into the bloodstream that is not bound to ceruloplasmin. This free copper precipitates throughout the body but particularly in the kidneys, eyes and brain. In the brain, most copper is deposited in the basal ganglia, particularly in the putamen and globus pallidus (together called the lenticular nucleus); these areas normally participate in the coordination of movement as well as playing a significant role in neurocognitive processes such as the processing of stimuli and mood regulation. Damage to these areas, again by Fenton chemistry, produces the neuropsychiatric symptoms seen in Wilson's disease.|$|E
5|$|DNA can {{be damaged}} by many sorts of mutagens, which change the DNA sequence. Mutagens include {{oxidizing}} agents, alkylating agents and also high-energy electromagnetic radiation such as ultraviolet light and X-rays. The type of DNA damage produced {{depends on the}} type of mutagen. For example, UV light can damage DNA by producing thymine dimers, which are cross-links between pyrimidine bases. On the other hand, oxidants such as free radicals or hydrogen peroxide produce multiple forms of damage, including base modifications, particularly of guanosine, and double-strand breaks. A typical human cell contains about 150,000 bases that have suffered <b>oxidative</b> <b>damage.</b> Of these oxidative lesions, the most dangerous are double-strand breaks, as these are difficult to repair and can produce point mutations, insertions, deletions from the DNA sequence, and chromosomal translocations. These mutations can cause cancer. Because of inherent limits in the DNA repair mechanisms, if humans lived long enough, they would all eventually develop cancer. DNA damages that are naturally occurring, due to normal cellular processes that produce reactive oxygen species, the hydrolytic activities of cellular water, etc., also occur frequently. Although most of these damages are repaired, in any cell some DNA damage may remain despite the action of repair processes. These remaining DNA damages accumulate with age in mammalian postmitotic tissues. This accumulation appears to be an important underlying cause of aging.|$|E
25|$|Memory {{capabilities}} decline with age, {{evident in}} human degenerative {{diseases such as}} Alzheimer's disease, which is accompanied by an accumulation of <b>oxidative</b> <b>damage.</b> Current studies demonstrate that the accumulation of ROS can decrease an organism's fitness because <b>oxidative</b> <b>damage</b> is a contributor to senescence. In particular, the accumulation of <b>oxidative</b> <b>damage</b> may lead to cognitive dysfunction, as demonstrated in a study in which old rats were given mitochondrial metabolites and then given cognitive tests. Results showed that the rats performed better after receiving the metabolites, suggesting that the metabolites reduced <b>oxidative</b> <b>damage</b> and improved mitochondrial function. Accumulating <b>oxidative</b> <b>damage</b> can then affect the efficiency of mitochondria and further increase the rate of ROS production. The accumulation of <b>oxidative</b> <b>damage</b> {{and its implications for}} aging depends on the particular tissue type where the damage is occurring. Additional experimental results suggest that <b>oxidative</b> <b>damage</b> is responsible for age-related decline in brain functioning. Older gerbils were found to have higher levels of oxidized protein in comparison to younger gerbils. Treatment of old and young mice with a spin trapping compound caused a decrease in the level of oxidized proteins in older gerbils but did not have an effect on younger gerbils. In addition, older gerbils performed cognitive tasks better during treatment but ceased functional capacity when treatment was discontinued, causing oxidized protein levels to increase. This led researchers to conclude that oxidation of cellular proteins is potentially important for brain function.|$|E

[...] Similar, but usually transient epigenetic alterations were recently found during repair of <b>oxidative</b> <b>damages</b> caused by H2O2, and {{it was suggested that}} occasionally these epigenetic alterations may also remain after repair.
