5|$|As {{with nearly}} every Dragon Quest game, Koichi Sugiyama {{composed}} the musical score. As {{was done for}} Dragon Quest VI, the original sound version was bundled with the symphonic suite in a two-disc set called Dragon Quest VII: Eden no Senshitachi Symphonic Suite + OST. The entire first disc and the <b>opening</b> <b>track</b> of the second disc consists of the symphonic suite, {{while the rest of}} the second disc is the original sound version. The Symphonic Suite was released alone on Super Audio CD later that year, and re-released in 2009. A disc titled Dragon Quest VII: Eden no Senshitachi on Piano was also released, and contained 27 piano-arranged tracks. The Symphonic Suite was later re-recorded in 2006 along with the rest of the music from the series. An original soundtrack for the 3DS remake was released on March 19, 2014, and features the original recordings by the Tokyo Metropolitan Symphony Orchestra from the remake.|$|E

5000|$|The 1970 album Eric Burdon Declares [...] "War" [...] is {{dedicated}} to Kirk in its <b>opening</b> <b>tracks.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The album {{continues}} the space rock lyrical theme introduced on Black Noise; the <b>opening</b> <b>track's</b> chorus is a chant of [...] "Sci-fi rock, rocket roll".|$|R
5000|$|Beorn's theme: A {{deep and}} brassy theme played {{several times in}} the <b>opening</b> <b>tracks.</b> The harmony, based on the Nature theme, appears by itself as well, {{potentially}} as a motif for the Wilderland itself.|$|R
25|$|The album had {{tentatively}} been titled 'Uncle Tom's Cabin' {{after the}} original <b>opening</b> <b>track.</b> However, the label wanted an 'anthem' track, resulting in Lane coming up with 'Cherry Pie' and the track becoming not only the lead cut but the album's title track. The video for the song employed model actress Bobbie Brown, whom Lane would later marry.|$|E
25|$|In 1994, {{after the}} great leap forward of Wide Skies, McMahon formed a second band, Gondwana, with an {{emphasis}} on rhythm and increasingly dominant bass and experimental didge sounds. The band released three albums: Travelling, Xenophon, and Bone Man, with the last two featuring another McMahon innovation: the mouth-held use of a geologist's seismic microphone to amplify the growling subsonic didge dynamics. This approach to music gave McMahon a new audience: the trance/dance crowd. A success evidenced by the placing of a Gondwana tune in the all important <b>opening</b> <b>track</b> position on each of the two volumes of highly successful Australian trance/dance compilation series.|$|E
500|$|Lavigne {{included}} [...] "Hello Kitty" [...] on her The Avril Lavigne Tour (2013–14) as the <b>opening</b> <b>track.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The Daily Blam gave a {{positive}} {{review of the}} album, noting that the band's sound lent well to remixing and that, [...] "Hollywood Undead have managed to blend rock and hip hop without sounding like trend hoes." [...] The choice in remixers was noted {{as well as the}} three <b>opening</b> <b>tracks.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{compilation}} was edited {{down from}} the previously released five CD, Looking Back, box set.

500|$|... "Zoo Station" [...] {{is a song}} by Irish {{rock band}} U2. It is the <b>opening</b> <b>track</b> from their 1991 album Achtung Baby, [...] a record on which the group reinvented {{themselves}} musically by incorporating influences from alternative rock, industrial, and electronic dance music. As the album's <b>opening</b> <b>track,</b> [...] "Zoo Station" [...] introduces the band's new sound, delivering industrial-influenced percussion and several layers of distorted guitars and vocals. Similarly, the lyrics suggest the group's new intents and anticipations. The introduction, featuring an [...] "explosion" [...] of percussion and a descending glissando for a guitar hook, was meant to make the listener think the album was mistakenly not U2's latest record or that their music player was broken.|$|E
500|$|Don Gilmore. It {{serves as}} the <b>opening</b> <b>track</b> to her second studio album Under My Skin (2004) and was first {{featured}} as a B-side of the album's lead single, [...] "Don't Tell Me", CD Single in many regions, including Australia, Japan and Europe.|$|E

5000|$|In James Robert Baker's novel, Boy Wonder, fictional movie {{producer}} Shark Trager {{makes it}} his goal to surpass Touch of Evils three minute <b>opening</b> <b>tracking</b> shot when filming a movie of his own. Tanya's line, [...] "He {{was some kind}} of a man. What does it matter what you say about people?" [...] was also quoted extensively in the book.|$|R

500|$|... "Yes! I Am a Long Way from Home" [...] is the <b>opening</b> <b>track</b> on the Scottish post-rock band Mogwai's 1997 debut album, Mogwai Young Team. It was {{primarily}} composed by the band's bassist, Dominic Aitchison, {{prior to the}} 1997 Mogwai Young Team recording sessions.|$|E
500|$|The {{music on}} Vulture Street was more rock orientated than Powderfinger's past work, {{especially}} Odyssey Number Five. The <b>opening</b> <b>track,</b> [...] "Rockin' Rocks", {{was described by}} Harp as [...] "far too cheesy to open this record—or any record, for that matter". The song became the band's <b>opening</b> <b>track</b> for live performances, though. [...] The first single, [...] "(Baby I've Got You) On My Mind", {{was one of the}} heavier songs on the album; varying reviewers alikened it to AC/DC, Bad Company, and Stereophonics, and musicOMH called it [...] "an unashamed full-tilt rocker". dB magazine said the title of [...] "Stumblin'", released as a single from [...] after appearing on Vulture Street, was representative of the [...] "classic rock clichés" [...] on the album.|$|E
500|$|<b>Opening</b> <b>track</b> [...] "Courageous", a pop {{rock and}} soft rock song, was {{described}} by Hall as an [...] "anthem of encouragement. It’s one brother reminding all of God’s men we were meant for greatness, and that greatness is defined in contagious and courageous abandonment to Jesus".|$|E
50|$|Side one has 7 non-datable {{tracks of}} {{depressed}} blues-destroying ramble... Early optimism on the <b>opening</b> <b>tracks</b> transmutes into full desolation by the closing hack-gulps at the end... “The Electric End” is a nineteen-plus minute excursion into frothful extremes. Piercing electro-search guitar, revolutionary ultra-primitive drumming, lost-mind vocalism of real cracked creation and {{some sort of}} high end squeal (a penny whistle?) combine in an incredibly wasted fashion.|$|R
5000|$|The opening shot is {{discussed}} {{briefly in the}} opening shot of Robert Altman's 1992 film, The Player, by two characters who work for a fictional Hollywood studio, as the longest <b>opening</b> <b>tracking</b> shot in history. It {{then goes on to}} surpass that shot in length. The opening is also referenced by Rainn Wilson in the DVD commentary of The Office episode entitled [...] "Performance Anxiety".|$|R
5000|$|Mystery Walk is a 1984 album by M + M (also {{known as}} Martha And The Muffins), {{produced}} by Daniel Lanois.

500|$|The album's <b>opening</b> <b>track,</b> [...] "Breadcrumb Trail", {{describes}} a day spent at a carnival with a fortune-teller. The song features a complex arrangement with sharp transitions, and the guitar fluctuates between a clean-sounding riff with harmonics in the verse to heavy distortion featuring extremely high-pitched {{notes in the}} chorus.|$|E
500|$|... "Reap What You Sow", the <b>opening</b> <b>track</b> on Transfusion, {{received}} {{air time}} on Triple M in Brisbane, and on Triple J nationwide in Australia.

5000|$|The <b>opening</b> title <b>track</b> of Shot of Love makes a few spiritual {{references}} while railing against substance abuse.|$|R
50|$|The track {{has been}} used during various {{television}} programmes around the world. It was featured {{as one of the}} <b>opening</b> <b>tracks</b> during the Grand Final of the Eurovision Song Contest 2016 in Stockholm, Sweden. It was performed by a group of children in the British soap opera Emmerdale at the funeral of the character Gemma Andrews. The song is playable in the video games Just Dance 2014 and Just Dance 2015.|$|R
5000|$|David Gonzales of AllMusic {{negatively}} {{criticized the}} follow {{up to the}} band's previous album Natin 99 as [...] "another bewildering mess". While he considered the album's first two <b>opening</b> <b>tracks</b> ("Ultrasound" [...] and [...] "Maskara") as [...] "good alternative rock songs", {{he pointed out that}} these songs will fail to appeal {{to a wide range of}} listeners. Gonzales dismissed most of the album as [...] "pointless and meandering".|$|R
