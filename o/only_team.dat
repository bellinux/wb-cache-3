This meant {{that they would have}} a home quarter-final against the second-best runners-up from the pool stage, Toulouse. Cardiff won the quarter-final 9–6.|$|E
5|$|Germany (incl. West Germany) {{holds the}} record for most hat-tricks scored with 7. Germany also shares with South Korea {{the record for}} most hat-tricks conceded with 4, and is the <b>only</b> <b>team</b> to have conceded four goals by the same player twice.|$|E
5|$|New Zealand are {{the most}} {{successful}} team {{in the history of}} the tournament, with three wins. They are also the <b>only</b> <b>team</b> to have won consecutive tournaments, with their victories in the 2011 and 2015 Rugby World Cup. Australia and South Africa have won the competition twice, while England have one win. They are the only nation from the northern hemisphere to have won the competition. France are the <b>only</b> <b>team</b> to appear in a final without winning, losing all three finals they have contested.|$|E

5|$|New Zealand {{have won}} the World Cup three times, the <b>only</b> <b>team</b> to have done so. They beat France in {{the final of the}} 1987 inaugural {{competition}} held in New Zealand and Australia, defeated France again in the final of the 2011 tournament, also hosted in New Zealand, and most recently defeated Australia in England in 2015, making them the first and <b>only</b> <b>team</b> to win the World Cup in consecutive tournaments. In 1991, they lost their semi-final to Australia before winning the playoff for third. In 1995, they reached the final, before losing in extra time to hosts South Africa. They finished in fourth place in 1999, after losing their semi-final and then the third-place playoff game. In 2003, New Zealand were knocked out by hosts Australia in their semi-final, before finishing third. The 2007 World Cup saw their worst tournament, being knocked out in the quarterfinals by the host nation France; until this they were the <b>only</b> <b>team</b> to have reached the semifinals of every tournament. As a result of the poor performance in the 2007 World Cup the NZRU commissioned a 47-page report to detail the causes of the failure. The All Blacks have never lost a World Cup pool match, and have finished top of their pool in all seven tournaments.|$|E
5|$|Tech eclipsed 100 points three {{different}} times. Its only road game was its only loss to national champion Pittsburgh at Forbes Field. Pittsburgh was the <b>only</b> <b>team</b> to score on Tech during the 1918 season. The defeat ended Georgia Tech's 33-game winning streak.|$|E
5|$|The Hokies, {{who won the}} Orange Bowl the {{previous}} season, have back-to-back bowl wins {{for the first time}} in school history and continued the streak of 10-win seasons to six. The <b>only</b> <b>team</b> with a longer active streak is Texas with nine.|$|E

5|$|As {{the team}} with the best regular season record, the Presidents' Trophy winner is {{guaranteed}} home-ice advantage in all four rounds of the Stanley Cup playoffs, provided they advance that far. However, it does not guarantee that success; only eight of these winners have gone on to win the Stanley Cup. Three other teams reached the Stanley Cup Finals, but failed to win. The last team to win both the Presidents' Trophy and the Stanley Cup in the same season was the 2012–13 Chicago Blackhawks. The <b>only</b> <b>team</b> to accomplish this more than once is the Detroit Red Wings.|$|E

With future Hall of Famers Grant Fuhr, Paul Coffey, Jari Kurri, Mark Messier, and Glenn Anderson, they established numerous new scoring records.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1930s, Chicago Black Hawks {{owner and}} staunch American {{nationalist}} Frederic McLaughlin commanded his general manager {{to compile a}} team of only American players; at the time, Taffy Abel was the only American-born player who was a regular player in the league. With eight out of 14 players Americans, the Black Hawks won only 14 of 48 games. In the playoffs, however, the Hawks upset the Canadiens, New York Americans, and the Maple Leafs to become the <b>only</b> <b>team</b> in NHL history to win the Stanley Cup despite a losing regular-season record. In the 1942 Stanley Cup Finals, the heavily favoured Toronto Maple Leafs were facing an upset, having fallen 3–0 in the seven-game series to the fifth-place Detroit Red Wings. Toronto rebounded, and won the next four games to capture the Stanley Cup, becoming {{the first of four}} teams in the NHL to come back from a 3–0 series deficit and the <b>only</b> <b>team</b> to accomplish that in the Stanley Cup Finals.|$|E

They were joined by the Force India of Nico Hülkenberg, who was to start 16th on the grid.|$|E
5|$|Milan and Barcelona {{share the}} record for the most victories, each having won the {{competition}} five times since its inception. Two of Milan's wins were achieved in consecutive years (1989 and 1990), which makes them the <b>only</b> <b>team</b> to have retained the UEFA Super Cup. Barcelona have the most appearances (nine) and also the most runner-up finishes (four). Spanish teams have won the competition the most times, with thirteen wins, ahead of the nine wins by Italian teams. The current holders are Real Madrid, who beat 2016–17 UEFA Europa League winners Manchester United 2–1 in the 2017 edition.|$|E
5|$|Rugby {{union was}} not entirely driven from Northern England, and in the 1970s the region was home to several strong teams. The high-water mark of rugby union in Northern England was the 1979 New Zealand tour during which the English Northern Division was the <b>only</b> <b>team</b> to defeat the All Blacks. In the 21st century the region's club sides have become less popular, with {{association}} football, cricket and rugby league attracting more spectators and talent. In the 2017–18 season, Sale Sharks and Newcastle Falcons play in the English Premiership, whereas Yorkshire Carnegie, Doncaster R.F.C. and Rotherham R.U.F.C. play in the RFU Championship.|$|E

5|$|Since 2005, the Toronto Blue Jays are the <b>only</b> <b>team</b> in Major League Baseball based {{outside of}} the United States. Established in 1977, the Blue Jays' first manager was Roy Hartsfield, who held the {{position}} for two seasons. The team's current manager is John Gibbons. Toronto's most successful manager, Cito Gaston, leads the team in regular-season managerial wins (809) and losses (760), postseason appearances (34), and playoff wins (18) and losses (16). He is the only manager {{to win a championship}} with the Blue Jays; the team won consecutive championships in 1992 and 1993, becoming the <b>only</b> <b>team</b> to date based {{outside of the}} United States to win a World Series and, upon completing their 1993 victory, the first team to win a World Series on foreign soil.
