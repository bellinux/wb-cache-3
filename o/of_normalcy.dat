His entire life has taken place within a giant arcological dome in Hollywood, fashioned to create the seaside town of Seahaven Island, and equipped with thousands of cameras to monitor all aspects of Truman's life. All of Seahaven's residents are actors, either acting out a script or repeating lines fed {{to them by the}} show's creator and executive producer, Christof, who seeks to capture Truman's real emotion and human behavior, give audiences a relatable everyman, and protect him from the outside world with a sense <b>of</b> <b>normalcy.</b>|$|E

However when Akihiko pieces {{together}} {{the connection between the}} full moon and the powerful Shadows, Mitsuru and Yukari come under attack by the Emperor and Empress Arcanas at Tartarus' entrance. Junpei, Akihiko and Fuka rush to their aid however the Arcanas easily overwhelm all of their Personas. In the midst of the battle, Fuka also awakens a Persona, Lucia, to defend an entranced Natsuki. However when the Emperor moves to attack her, Makoto arrives {{in the nick of time}} and launches a barrage of Persona attacks despite his teammates begging him to flee for his safety. With everyone approaching their physical limits, Fuka uses Lucia to sense the Arcanas' weaknesses and coordinates the SEES members in a collaborative effort which results in the Shadows' defeat. A few days later, Fuka moves into the Iwatodai dorm and repairs her relations with Natsuki, while life returns to a level <b>of</b> <b>normalcy.</b>|$|E

25|$|The Internal Security Department (Singapore) or ISD, {{together}} with the Police, helped contain a volatile situation. Sino-Malay tensions surfaced again in Singapore in 1969 following {{the outbreak of the}} 1969 racial riots in Malaysia after the General Election. Many incidents of Sino-Malay clashes erupted and the situation was brought under control following security sweeps by the Police and armed forces throughout Singapore. The vigilance of the security forces in Singapore and the persistent efforts of ISD officers in making island-wide coverage contributed to the return <b>of</b> <b>normalcy</b> in Singapore.|$|E
25|$|Housing First has {{met with}} success since its initial {{implementations}} in 2009 by providing relatively no strings-attached housing to homeless people with substance abuse problems or mental health issues. Housing First allows homeless {{men and women to}} be taken directly off the street into private community-based apartments, without requiring treatment first. This allows the homeless to return to some sense <b>of</b> <b>normalcy,</b> from which it is believed that they are better-poised to tackle their addictions or sicknesses. The relapse rate through these types of programs is lower than that of conventional homeless programs.|$|E

Indeed, several paddy fields that had been since the Mongol invasions were restarted only in 1386. By all accounts, he had successfully established some degree of central control over his vassals, including Toungoo, by {{the eve of the}} war with Pegu.

Defeated by Taft for the 1912 nomination, Roosevelt bolted the party and led the third party ticket of the Progressive Party. The Republicans returned to the White House throughout the 1920s, running on platforms <b>of</b> <b>normalcy,</b> business-oriented efficiency, and high tariffs.

25|$|Predictors of poor {{mental health}} after a trauma, such as mental health status {{prior to a}} trauma and {{individual}} characteristics, can help determine those who will be more vulnerable to developing mental health problems. Those that exhibit lower mental health prior to an earthquake {{will be more likely}} to experience negative life changes than positive life changes with regard to personal strength. Depressive symptoms before a disaster can predict higher chances of developing PTSD following a trauma. People who exhibit lower mental health prior to the trauma don't adapt as well following trauma, and show higher levels of PTSD. Personality traits, such as neuroticism and low self-control are associated with a lower sense <b>of</b> <b>normalcy</b> following an earthquake, however optimism is predictive of lower and less severe PTSD symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Toole {{tried to}} {{maintain}} a sense <b>of</b> <b>normalcy</b> and enrolled in Tulane {{in the fall of}} 1968 with the hopes of acquiring a Ph.D. He took a course studying Theodore Dreiser, on whom he had lectured while at Hunter, and was particularly interested in Dreiser's close relationship with his mother and his anti-Catholic beliefs. The assassinations of Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968 added to his feelings of grief and heightened his paranoia. Several of Toole's longtime friends noticed he had an increasing sense of feelings of personal persecution. Toole went to see his friend Bob Byrne at his home in August 1968, where he again expressed sadness and humiliation that his book would not be published. Toole told Byrne that people were passing his home late in the night and honking their car horns at him, that students whispered about him behind his back, and that people were plotting against him. Byrne had a talk with him, which he felt, for the time being, calmed him down.|$|E

500|$|The {{immediate}} {{result of}} the war was the collapse of the Pagan Empire. However, the war merely accelerated the collapse but did not cause it. Pagan's disintegration was [...] "in fact more prolonged and agonized." [...] The kingdom had been in long gradual decline since the early 13th century. Had Pagan possessed a stronger central government, the collapse could have been temporary, and the country “could have risen again”. But the dynasty could not recover, and because the Mongols refused to fill the power vacuum, no viable center emerged in the immediate aftermath. As a result, several minor states fought it out for supremacy {{for the better part of}} the 14th century. It was only in the late 14th century that two relatively strong powers emerged in the Irrawaddy basin, restoring some semblance <b>of</b> <b>normalcy.</b> The vast region surrounding the Irrawaddy valley would continue to be made up of several small Tai-Shan states well into the 16th century.|$|E
500|$|According to Sheikh Ahmed Abu Risha, many Iraqis became disaffected with AQI {{but were}} {{hesitant}} {{to take up}} arms against them out of fear.

[...] Other sheikhs specifically said that the large number of killings and kidnappings by AQI prompted the tribal revolt. [...] AQI leader Ayyub al-Masri practically admitted as much in 2008 when he ordered fighters in Anbar to avoid harming Sunnis who were not working closely with coalition forces and [...] "not interfere in social issues". [...] However, David Kilcullen argued that the abuses themselves may have been less of an issue than AQI disrupting the tribes' smuggling businesses, the belief that AQI was linked to Iran, and their general [...] "high-handed" [...] behavior. [...] He added that, whatever the spark, there was already a perception that AQI [...] "had it coming".|$|E
500|$|Ferdinand's actions {{constituted}} a definitive de facto break {{both with the}} autonomous governments, which had not yet declared formal independence, and with the effort of Spanish liberals to create a representative government that would fully include the overseas possessions. Such a government {{was seen as an}} alternative to independence by many in New Spain, Central America, the Caribbean, Quito, Peru, Upper Peru and Chile. Yet the news of the restoration of the [...] "ancien régime" [...] did not initiate a new wave of juntas, as had happened in 1809 and 1810, with the notable exception of the establishment of a junta in Cuzco demanding the implementation of the Spanish Constitution. Instead most Spanish Americans were moderates who decided {{to wait and see what}} would come out of the restoration <b>of</b> <b>normalcy.</b> In fact, in areas of New Spain, Central America and Quito, governors found it expedient to leave the elected constitutional ayuntamientos in place for several years in order to prevent conflict with the local society. Liberals on both sides of the Atlantic, nevertheless, continued to conspire to bring back a constitutional monarchy, ultimately succeeding in 1820. The most dramatic example of transatlantic collaboration is perhaps Francisco Javier Mina's expedition to Texas and northern Mexico in 1816 and 1817.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{developments}} in laser-ultrasonic technology {{have made it}} possible to remotely inspect large and complex aeronautic structures for structural integrity as well as gauge hot steel products on the production line.

In fact the same features that make laser-ultrasonics attractive for the inspection of complex structures, such as relaxed requirements <b>of</b> the <b>normalcy</b> <b>of</b> the transducer, a broad frequency bandwidth, and large standoff distances make this technology unique and extremely useful for characterizing materials both in the laboratory and on the production line.
