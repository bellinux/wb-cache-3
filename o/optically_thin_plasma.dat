These populations are used to determine the ratios of line intensities for dipole allowed transitions between various energy levels. This approach can be applied to impurities other than the lithiumlike ions and is especially useful for diagnostics of systems where nonintrusive spectroscopic techniques must be used...|$|R
40|$|Radiation damping of {{the motion}} of charged {{particles}} in relativistic, <b>optically</b> <b>thin</b> <b>plasmas</b> is described {{within the framework of}} the covariant gyrokinetic theory. It involves description of the collisionless single-particle dynamics as well as the Vlasov and Maxwell equations both written in the covariant formulation. The damping causes corrections to the phase-space trajectory of the particle, as well as to the form of the kinetic equation itself, due to the failure of conditions of the Liouville theorem. Both effects result independent of the gyrophase, which is retained as an ignorable variable. In addition, the applicability range of the covariant gyrokinetic theory is extended to describe short-wavelength perturbations with the background of zero parallel electric field. The presented theory is suitable for description of magnetized, relativistic, collisionless plasmas in the context of astrophysical or laboratory problems. Non-uniquenes of the gyrokinetic representation and consequences thereof are discussed. Comment: 36 pages, no figur...|$|R

40|$|We {{present results}} from ASCA {{observations}} of the binary CI Cam both in quiescence and in outburst {{in order to identify}} its central accreting object. The quiescence spectrum of CI Cam consists of soft and hard components which are separated clearly at aound 2 – 3 keV. A large equivalent width of an iron Kα emission line prefers an <b>optically</b> <b>thin</b> thermal <b>plasma</b> emission model to a non-thermal power-law model for the hard component, which favors a white dwarf as the accreting object, since the <b>optically</b> <b>thin</b> thermal hard X-ray emission is a common characteristic among cataclysmic variables (binaries including an accreting white dwarf). However, since the power-law model, which represents the X-ray spectrum of the soft X-ray transients in quiescence, provides with an equally good fit to the hard component statistically, we cannot exclude possibilities of a neutron star or a black hole from the quiescence data. The outburst spectrum, on the other hand, is composed of a hard component represented by a multi-temperature <b>optically</b> <b>thin</b> thermal <b>plasma</b> emission and of an independent soft X-ray component that appears below 1 keV intermittently on a decaying light curve of the hard component. The spectrum of the soft component is represented well by a blackbody with th...|$|R

40|$|We {{present an}} {{analysis}} of a pointed 141 ks Chandra high resolution transmission gratings observation of the Be X-ray emitting star HD 110432, a prominent member of the gamma Cas analogs. The Chandra lightcurve shows a high variability but its analysis fails to detect any coherent periodicity up to a frequency of 0. 05 Hz. The analysis of the Chandra HETG spectrum shows that, to correctly describe the spectrum, three model components are needed. Two of those components are <b>optically</b> <b>thin</b> thermal <b>plasmas</b> of different temperatures (kT~ 8 - 9 and 0. 2 - 0. 3 keV respectively). Two different models seem to describe well the third component. One possibility is a third hot <b>optically</b> <b>thin</b> thermal <b>plasma</b> at kT= 16 - 21 keV with an Fe abundance Z~ 0. 3 Zo, definitely smaller than for the other two thermal components. Alternatively, the third component can be described by a powerlaw with a photon index Gamma= 1. 56. In either case, the Chandra HETG spectrum establishes that {{each one of these}} components must be modified by distinct absorption columns. The analysis of a non contemporaneous 25 ks Suzaku observation shows the presence of a hard tail extending up to at least 33 keV. The Suzaku spectrum is described with the sum of two components: an <b>optically</b> <b>thin</b> thermal <b>plasma</b> at kT ~ 9 keV and a very hot second plasma with kT ~ 33 keV or, alternatively, a powerlaw with photon index Gamma= 1. 58. The analysis of the Si XIII and S XV He like triplets present in the Chandra spectrum point to a very dense (n_e ~ 10 ^ 13 cm^- 3) plasma located either close to the stellar surface (r< 3 R_*) of the Be star or, alternatively, very close (r ~ 1. 5 R_WD) to the surface of a (hypothetical) WD companion.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{detailed}} analysis of the X-ray emission from the middle-aged supernova remnant W 51 C and star-forming region W 51 B with Suzaku. The soft X-ray emission from W 51 C is well represented by an <b>optically</b> <b>thin</b> thermal <b>plasma</b> in the non-equilibrium ionization state with a temperature of ∼ 0. 7 keV. The elemental abundance of Mg is significantly higher than the solar value. We find no significant feature of an over-ionized plasma in W 51 C. The hard X-ray emission is spatially coincident with the molecular clouds associated with W 51 B, overlapping with W 51 C. The spectrum is represented by an <b>optically</b> <b>thin</b> thermal <b>plasma</b> with a temperature of ∼ 5 keV or a powerlaw model with a photon index of ∼ 2. 2.
