The copper rings for sealing the portholes were left in Kronstadt and were not found until February 1897.|$|E

5|$|In April 1941, county {{officials}} admitted {{that it was}} likely that the $7million appropriated would not be enough, and instead {{it would be better}} spent on improving other nearby parkways. The proposed parkway would have needed $400,000 more for additional right-of-way, and the construction costs would leave no money to repave the Bronx River Parkway, the link to the Cross County Parkway, and to extend the Saw Mill River Parkway. The county would have had to spend $8million of its <b>own</b> <b>money</b> as well. The parkway was instead shortened from Bronxville to Elmsford.|$|E

50|$|Oliver L. J. {{had given}} {{considerable}} {{weight to the}} fact that the existence of Greenjacket Investments Ltd. was real and had enduring consequences. At the end of the transaction, the Dawsons did not <b>own</b> the <b>money</b> which had been paid by Wood Bastow Ltd.: instead, Greenjacket Investments Ltd. <b>owned</b> that <b>money</b> and the Dawsons owned Greenjacket Investments Limited. Legally speaking, those are two very different situations. However Lord Brightman saw this as irrelevant. In any case where a predetermined series of transactions contains steps which are only there for the purpose of avoiding tax, the tax is to be calculated on the effect of the composite transaction as a whole.|$|R
5|$|While {{the game}} neared completion, the funding began to dry up.

5|$|As {{a test to}} see if his gubernatorial {{authority}} was still recognized, Taylor issued a pardon for a man convicted of manslaughter in Knott County. The pardon was signed by the proper county officials, but officers at the penitentiary refused to release the man. It was feared that Taylor would dispatch the state militia to remove the prisoner, but no further {{attempts were made to}} secure his release. Continuing to live under heavy guard in his executive office, Taylor was criticized for not having offered a reward for the capture of Goebel's unknown assailant. Responding that he was not authorized to make an offer {{in the absence of a}} request to do so by the officials in Franklin County, he offered a $500 reward from his <b>own</b> <b>money.</b>|$|E
5|$|Born in Huntington on Long Island, Whitman {{worked as}} a journalist, a teacher, a {{government}} clerk, and—in addition to publishing his poetry—was a volunteer nurse during the American Civil War. Early in his career, he also produced a temperance novel, Franklin Evans (1842). Whitman's major work, Leaves of Grass, {{was first published in}} 1855 with his <b>own</b> <b>money.</b> The work was an attempt at reaching out to the common person with an American epic. He continued expanding and revising it until his death in 1892. After a stroke towards the end of his life, he moved to Camden, New Jersey, where his health further declined. When he died at age 72, his funeral became a public spectacle.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 1730s public taste for Italian opera was {{beginning}} to fade. The popular success of John Gay and Johann Christoph Pepusch's The Beggar's Opera (first performed in 1728) had heralded a spate of English-language ballad-operas that mocked the pretensions of Italian opera. With box-office receipts falling, Handel's productions were increasingly reliant on private subsidies from the nobility. Such funding became harder to obtain after the launch in 1730 of the Opera of the Nobility, a rival company to his own. Handel overcame this challenge, but he spent large sums of his <b>own</b> <b>money</b> in doing so.|$|E
5|$|Following {{financial}} difficulties during the First World War, the mining operations were bought by Store Norske, which was incorporated in Oslo on 30 November 1916. That year, SNSK built five new barracks, {{including one that}} {{was made into a}} hospital. SNSK introduced its <b>own</b> <b>money</b> with approval from Norges Bank, consisting entirely of banknotes at par with Norwegian krone. The American community buried their dead at Hotellneset. In 1918, eleven people were killed by the Spanish flu and a graveyard was established in Longyear City. Two years later, 26 men were killed in a coal dust explosion in Mine 1. This resulted in the mine being closed and electric operation being taken into use in Mine 2. The same year, the first truck was delivered for use in the mining operations.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, despite {{changes to}} the {{campaign}} finance laws, there was no perceptible decrease in campaigning activity. One reason was a compensatory expansion of advertising by way of internet search engines such as Facebook and other social media which were relatively inexpensive. Helsingin Sanomat called election workers in all electoral districts, excluding the Åland Islands, to ask for their assessments of the electoral campaigns. They reported that while the NCP's campaign was the most visible, the Centre Party and the Social Democrats also had high-profile campaigns with some variations across districts. The NCP were also said to be spending more of their <b>own</b> <b>money</b> than in the past.|$|E
