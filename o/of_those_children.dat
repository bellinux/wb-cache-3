5|$|IQ tests {{generally}} are reliable enough {{that most people}} ages ten and older have similar IQ scores throughout life. Still, some individuals score very differently when taking the same test at different times or when taking more than one kind of IQ test at the same age. For example, many children in the famous longitudinal Genetic Studies of Genius begun in 1921 by Lewis Terman showed declines in IQ as they grew up. Terman recruited school pupils based on referrals from teachers, and gave them his Stanford–Binet IQ test. Children with an IQ above 140 by that test {{were included in the}} study. There were 643 children in the main study group. When the students who could be contacted again (503 students) were retested at high school age, they were found to have dropped 9 IQ points on average in Stanford–Binet IQ. More than two dozen children dropped by 15 IQ points and six by 25 points or more. Yet parents <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>children</b> thought that the children were still as bright as ever, or even brighter.|$|E
25|$|The {{languages}} {{spoken at}} home also vary from age; for example, approximately 68.2% {{of children who}} are 5–17 years old speak only English, while 16.9% <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>children</b> speak other Indo-European languages. Among adults aged 18–24 years, 23.4% speak other Indo-European languages; while 63.9% of adults who are 18 to 24 years old speak English.|$|E
25|$|The Protracted Relief and Recovery Operation200509 (PRRO) {{was formed}} {{to respond to the}} high levels of {{malnutrition}} in Burkina Faso, following the food and nutrition crisis in 2012. The efforts of this project are mostly geared towards the treatment and prevention of malnutrition and include take home rations for the caretakers <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>children</b> who are being treated for malnutrition. Additionally, the activities of this operation contribute to families' abilities to withstand future food crises. Better nutrition among the two most vulnerable groups, young children and pregnant women, prepares {{them to be able to}} respond better in times when food security is compromised, such as in droughts.|$|E

50|$|Defined as {{marriage}} {{before the}} age of 18 years, child marriage is widespread in Pakistan and linked to spousal violence. Child marriage occurs most often in rural and low-income households where education is minimal. The Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey conducted from 2012 to 2013 reported that 47.5% of currently married women aged 15 to 24 had been married {{before the age}} of 18.

25|$|On 6 December 2006, the {{influential}} science journal Nature published {{a new study}} which examined the mutation history of the HIV found in blood samples {{from some of the}} children, and concluded that a number <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>children</b> had been infected well before the six defendants arrived in Libya. In addition, a common ancestor of the strains that infected the children was already present in Libya. The study was based on statistical models of the rate of evolution in HIV derived from previous outbreaks. The publication was reported in newspapers world-wide and sparked an editorial campaign by Nature calling for the acquittal of the defendants.|$|E
25|$|On January l, 1866, {{the twin}} {{brothers}} were married by their {{father in a}} double wedding ceremony to sisters; Cyrus to Emma Lillie and Darius to Laura Marie Lillie. The two girls were lineal descendants of John Alden of Pilgrim fame. Darius {{and his wife had}} seven children, including four daughters: Lillie Alden, Cora Stanwood, Estelle Marcy and Edith Harriet; and three sons, Stanwood, Percival Bartlett and Frederick Walter. <b>Of</b> <b>those</b> <b>children,</b> Frederick resided in Newton Upper Falls, Massachusetts, and was shipping agent for the Pettee Machine Works. His home was on Rockland Place in the old John A. Gould House. Cyrus and his wife had five children, including three daughters, Grace, Elsie, and Florence, and two sons, Francis S. and Ernest. Ernest purchased the old Cunningham estate on Richardson Road in 1918 from which he and his wife, Bertha, successfully operated the Arlo Publishing Company which featured children's books.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{the queen}} showed {{increasing}} signs of mental instability. On , seventeen doctors signed a document declaring her unable {{to manage the}} kingdom, with no prospect for her condition to improve. John was reluctant to take the reins of power, rejecting {{the idea of a}} formal regency. This opened the way for elements of the nobility to form a de facto government via a Council. Rumors circulated that John exhibited symptoms of the same insanity, and that he might be prevented from ruling. According to longstanding laws that guided the institution of regency, were the regent to die or become incapable for any reason, and having children of less than fourteen years (which was John's situation at the time), government would be exercised by the guardians <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>children</b> or, if guardians had not been formally named, by the wife of the regent. In John's case, {{that would have been a}} Spanish infanta. Fear, suspicion and intrigue engulfed the entire institutional framework of the nation.|$|E

500|$|Dickinson {{was named}} {{coordinator}} and {{six weeks later}} he, McSpadden, Murray and others had selected a staff, developed a program, recruited students, and moved into the Mount Adams Public School building at 1125 St. Gregory Street. Described by Cincinnati Magazine as [...] "a quaint village of imaginative, arty residents, unusual shops and restaurants, and historic buildings" [...] and overlooking downtown Cincinnati and the Ohio River, Mount Adams had been home to the Art Academy of Cincinnati (the museum school of the Cincinnati Art Museum) since 1887, and was a [...] "mecca for students and teachers of art". The Mount Adams School was nearly defunct, with fewer than 80 students remaining. Fifty <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>children,</b> ranging from kindergarten (around age five) to third grade (around age eight) remained alongside the new SCPA. A dozen of the Mount Adams middle school students were accepted into the new program, along with the 140 other fourth through sixth grade pupils selected from schools around the city by audition.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} days of Kew Asylum, the {{distinction}} between [...] "lunatics" [...] and [...] "idiots" [...] (or [...] "imbeciles") was not made. Therefore, many wards of the state, [...] "difficult" [...] children and children with intellectual disability were housed with the adults at Kew. By 1879 nearly 600 children, representing a quarter of all inmates, were accommodated in various institutions in Victoria. [...] In the 1880s the government decided that a separate building should be built to accommodate child inmates. The Zox Commission recommended the Yarra Bend Asylum site as appropriate for buildings for [...] "imbecile" [...] children. However, a site between the main building and the entrance gates of Kew was chosen and in 1885 a contract was let for the erection of cottage units. [...] The Kew Idiot Ward (Kew Cottages) was opened in May 1887. The Idiot Ward was initially considered a ward of Kew Lunatic Asylum, however later became known as a separate institution [...] Kew Idiot Asylum. Although the Idiot Asylum only admitted children, many <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>children</b> remained in residence at the Cottages as adults.|$|E
500|$|Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky {{was born}} in Votkinsk, {{a small town in}} Vyatka Governorate (present-day Udmurtia) in the Russian Empire, into a family with a long line of {{military}} service. His father, Ilya Petrovich Tchaikovsky, had served as a lieutenant colonel and engineer in the Department of Mines, and would manage the Kamsko-Votkinsk Ironworks. His grandfather, Pyotr Fedorovich Tchaikovsky (né Petro Fedorovych Chaika), served first as a physician's assistant in the army and later as city governor of Glazov in Viatka. His great-grandfather, a Ukrainian Cossack named Fyodor Chaika (accordingly, 'Tchaikovsky' is the derivative of the Ukrainian family name 'Chaika' - 'seagull' in Ukrainian), distinguished himself under Peter the Great at the Battle of Poltava in 1709. Tchaikovsky's mother, Alexandra Andreyevna ( [...] d'Assier), was the second of Ilya's three wives, 18 years her husband's junior and [...] French on her father's side. Both Ilya and Alexandra were trained in the arts, including music—a necessity as a posting to a remote area of Russia also meant a need for entertainment, whether in private or at social gatherings. Of his six siblings, Tchaikovsky's was close to his sister Alexandra and twin brothers [...] Anatoly and Modest. Alexandra's marriage to Lev Davydov would produce seven children and lend Tchaikovsky the only real family life he would know as an adult, especially during his years of wandering. One <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>children,</b> Vladimir Davydov, whom the composer would nickname 'Bob', would become very close to him.|$|E

[...] This is the problem with filtering content at the user end, and not at the source. [...] It is impossible to enforce parental monitoring of their children.

2500|$|Piaget first {{developed}} as a psychologist in the 1920s. He investigated the hidden side of children’s minds. Piaget proposed that children moved {{from a position of}} egocentrism to sociocentrism. For this explanation he combined the use of psychological and clinical methods to create what he called a semiclinical interview. He began the interview by asking children standardized questions and depending on how they answered, he would ask them a series of nonstandard questions. Piaget was looking for what he called [...] "spontaneous conviction" [...] so he often asked questions the children neither expected nor anticipated. In his studies, he noticed there was a gradual progression from intuitive to scientific and socially acceptable responses. Piaget theorized children did this because of the social interaction and the challenge to younger children’s ideas by the ideas <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>children</b> who were more advanced.|$|E
