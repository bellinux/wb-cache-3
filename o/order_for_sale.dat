50|$|The Court of Appeal {{held the}} purpose of the trust was to give Mrs Chhokar and her {{children}} a home. There was no reason for an <b>order</b> <b>for</b> <b>sale,</b> having regard to the interest of third parties. Because Mr Parmar stepped into Mr Chhokar’s shoes, it would be inequitable for her to have to pay an occupational rent, but he should be entitled to credit for paying off the mortgage. Accordingly, she and Mr Parmar held the house as tenants in common in equity in equal shares. Cumming-Bruce LJ remarked that for the question about whether an <b>order</b> <b>for</b> <b>sale</b> should be made, the bankruptcy case law was relevant. He first referred to Goff LJ in Re Holliday 1981 1 Ch 405, before continuing his judgment.|$|E
50|$|In United Kingdom, {{foreclosure}} is {{a little}} used remedy which vests the property in the mortgagee with the mortgagor having no right to any surplus from the sale. Because this remedy can be harsh, courts almost never allow it. Instead, they usually grant an order for possession and an <b>order</b> <b>for</b> <b>sale,</b> which mitigates some of the harshness of the repossession by allowing the sale.|$|E

40|$|Students new {{to family}} law {{are likely to}} find that a {{significant}} portion of the syllabus focuses on the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 (MCA). Part I is primarily concerned with divorce and nullity and Part II with financial provision on breakdown of a marriage 1 and it is the latter which this article will consider. By way of overview for students new to the subject the law does not normally intervene in respect of how money and property are distributed amongst family members. Ownership of family property is largely governed by the law of property and equity and trust. However, following divorce or dissolution of a civil partnership the courts may split assets according to what is fair between the parties having regard to the individual needs and circumstances of the parties and any children. This can include an order for a lump sum or periodical payments 2; a property adjustment order or <b>order</b> <b>for</b> <b>sale</b> 3 and orders relating to pension provision 4 with section 25 setting out what the court must take into account in deciding whether to exercise its powers in respect of those provisions. This area of family law has recently received considerable coverage in the legal press following the unanimous Supreme Court decision in Wyatt v Vince 5 to allow the appellant wife’s appeal against the striking out of her claim for financial relief 18 years after the grant of the decree absolute and direct that her application proceed to the High Court Family Division. This article will not focus on the procedural aspects of this decision other than to highlight that Lord Wilson, delivering the judgement, made it clear that Rule 4. 4 of the Family Procedure Rules does not confer on the family court the power of summary judgement equivalent to that found in the Civil Procedure Rules. Instead when a former spouse applies for a financial order, the court has a duty under section 25 (1) of the MCA to consider all the circumstances of the case including the eight areas set out in subsection 2...|$|E

40|$|The {{introduction}} of state ownership during communist rule fundamentally blurred the organizational boundaries {{between government and}} business. The state became the sole employer – private employers were non-existent, while the business function of state enterprises was highly politicized. The latter were controlled by the party-state through central planning and the nomenklatura system of recruitment and appointments. Central plan meant direct bureaucratic management of the economy by institutions of the state. The central plan rather than market mechanisms designated what enterprises should produce and at what cost. It further designated the suppliers and customers for enterprises, the general framework for pay scales and terms of employment. Investment was provided primarily by the state, which in turn {{had the right to}} income earned by enterprises and organizations under its ownership. The abundance of administrative <b>orders</b> <b>for</b> <b>sales,</b> marketing and distribution resulted in lack of initiative and entrepreneurship. Competition was considered wasteful and unnecessary in a system of soft budget constraints (Kornai, 1980; 1992). 1 Managers were thus not decision makers but only implementers of decisions taken at higher political level—the main function o...|$|R

50|$|With {{the help}} of S.K. Packham, Chief Clerk in the Public Relations Office, Allan {{compiled}} a notebook with all the names, numbers, classes and shed allocations of Southern Railway locomotives, based {{on many of the}} requests he received about rolling stock. This was so well-received that Allan asked his chief officer, Cuthbert Grasemann, if he might publish it as a small booklet which would save costs in terms of replying to public enquiries and which could even make a small profit. The proposal was turned down but Allan was allowed to begin publication on his own behalf. Through the Public Relations Office, he met W.C. Brett of McCorquodale & Co. printers who agreed to publish the booklet. Two thousand copies of his first book, ABC of Southern Locomotives, were <b>ordered</b> <b>for</b> <b>sale</b> <b>for</b> a shilling each. On the day of its publication, 21 November 1942, Allan presented copies to Grasemann and Oliver Bulleid, the Southern's Chief Mechanical Engineer. This backfired as Bulleid objected violently to the publication of a book about his locomotives without his knowledge and he threatened Allan with dismissal from the Southern Railway as well as an action for breach of copyright if he were to publish.|$|R
