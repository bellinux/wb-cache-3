25|$|Human {{cannibalism}} is the act {{or practice}} of humans eating the flesh or internal organs of <b>other</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings.</b> A person who practices cannibalism {{is called a}} cannibal. The expression cannibalism has been extended into zoology to mean one individual of a species consuming {{all or part of}} another individual of the same species as food, including sexual cannibalism.|$|E
25|$|David G. Bromley {{described}} Prem Rawat {{and other}} founders of new religions as {{being held in}} awe by their early followers, who ascribe extraordinary powers to them that set them apart from <b>other</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings.</b> When describing the difficulty of charismatic leaders in proving to be above normal human failings such as not to suffer ill health or indulge in worldly pursuits, he used Rawat's marriage as an example.|$|E

25|$|Generally, {{the nobility}} grew from wealthier or more {{powerful}} {{members of the}} peasantry, those who were capable of assigning work or wealth to provide the requisite cavalrymen. In Finland, there never existed outright serfdom. Hence, nobility was basically a class of well-off citizens, not owners of <b>other</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings.</b> In the Middle Ages {{and much of the}} modern age, nobles and other wealthy men were landowners, as well as lords of villeins and servants. Members of the nobility utilized their economic power and sometimes also other powers to have smaller farmowners sell their lands to manor lords, so landowning centralized gradually more {{in the hands of the}} noble class.|$|E
25|$|According to Malhotra, Dharmic traditions rely on adhyatma-vidya, {{while the}} Abrahamic {{religions}} rely on God's interventions in human history. For followers of history-centric (Abrahamic) religions, truth-claims based on history are {{more significant than}} the scriptural message itself. History-centric dogma such as original sin and resurrection become critical beliefs and no compromise can be made on their acceptance. This explains the centrality of Nicene creed to all major Christian denominations. Followers of history-centric religions believe that the God revealed His message through a special prophet and that the message is secured in scriptures. This special access to God is available only to these intermediaries or prophets and not to any <b>other</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings.</b>|$|E

25|$|The serum is {{a success}} and {{transforms}} Steve Rogers into a nearly perfect human being with peak strength, agility, stamina, and intelligence. The success of the program leaves Erskine wondering about replicating the experiment on <b>other</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings.</b> The process itself has been inconsistently detailed: While in the original material Rogers is shown receiving injections of the Super-Serum, when the origin was retold in the 1960s, the Comic Code Authority had already put a veto over graphic description of drug intake and abuse, and thus the Super-Serum was retconned into an oral formula. Later accounts hint at a combination of oral and intravenous treatments with a strenuous training regimen, culminating in the Vita-Ray exposure.|$|E
25|$|Many consequentialist {{theories}} {{may seem}} {{primarily concerned with}} human beings and their relationships with <b>other</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings.</b> However, some philosophers argue {{that we should not}} limit our ethical consideration to the interests of human beings alone. Jeremy Bentham, who is regarded as the founder of utilitarianism, argues that animals can experience pleasure and pain, thus demanding that 'non-human animals' should be a serious object of moral concern. More recently, Peter Singer has argued that it is unreasonable that we do not give equal consideration to the interests of animals as to those of human beings when we choose the way we are to treat them. Such equal consideration does not necessarily imply identical treatment of humans and non-humans, any more than it necessarily implies identical treatment of all humans.|$|E
25|$|Two psychiatrists testified upon {{behalf of}} the defence. The first of these, Dr. James MacKeith, began his {{testimony}} on 26 October. MacKeith testified as to how, through a lack of emotional development, Nilsen experienced difficulty expressing any emotion other than anger, and his tendency to treat <b>other</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> as components of his fantasies. The psychiatrist also described Nilsen's association between unconscious bodies and sexual arousal; stating that Nilsen possessed narcissistic traits, an impaired sense of identity, {{and was able to}} depersonalise other individuals. He stated his conclusions that Nilsen displayed many signs of maladaptive behaviour, the combination of which, in one man, was lethal. These factors could be attributed to an unspecified personality disorder from which MacKeith believed Nilsen suffered. In response to prosecution contention that, in attributing Nilsen to an unspecified disorder, MacKeith was therefore undecided in his conclusions, MacKeith contended that this unspecified personality disorder was severe enough to substantially reduce Nilsen's responsibility.|$|E

25|$|Heidegger {{theorized that}} Dasein exists {{as an agent}} who is always-already engaged in a world with <b>other</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings.</b> Charles Taylor built on Heidegger's work {{when he talked about}} engaged agency, or the idea that Dasein is an agent inescapably engaged in his world. What Heidegger, and later Taylor, are saying is that that world is {{constantly}} “there-for-us” to experience prior to any abstract, disengaged scientific theorizing, and this is where hermeneutics starts to deviate from mainstream psychological and personality theories. In other words, Dasein (a person) does not need to scientifically analyze human interaction to take part in it. All he needs to do is observe human interaction, interpret what those observations mean for him, and then participate accordingly. Heidegger termed this description as being-in-the-world, i.e. human beings exist in the world as active participants who are so deeply immersed that their world around them becomes utterly inescapable, especially when trying to understand themselves.|$|E

500|$|Andrew O'Malley {{writes in}} his survey of 18th-century children's literature, [...] "from helping poor animals [...] {{eventually}} makes a seamless transition to performing small acts of charity for the poor children he encounters". Charles learns to care for his fellow human beings through his exposure to animals. Barbauld's Lessons is not, therefore, Romantic in the traditional sense; it does not emphasise the solitary self or the individual. As McCarthy puts it, [...] "every human being needs <b>other</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> in order to live. Humans are communal entities".|$|E

500|$|Referring to the September 11 attacks, John Koller {{states that}} the threat to life from {{religious}} violence in modern society mainly exists due to faulty epistemology and metaphysics as well as faulty ethics. A failure to respect the life of <b>other</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> and other life forms, states Koller, is [...] "rooted in dogmatic but mistaken knowledge claims that fail to recognize other legitimate perspectives". Koller states that anekāntavāda is a Jain doctrine that each side commit to accepting truths of multiple perspectives, dialogue and negotiations.|$|E
500|$|While {{discussing}} the song's theme with French radio Europe 1, Madonna {{spoke about the}} intolerance going around the world, especially in France whom she believed to have lost its ability to accept people of all race and color. Adding {{that the level of}} intolerance and antisemitism was increasing all-throughout Europe, Madonna said that [...] "Ghosttown"s apocalyptic theme was a foreshadow of the destruction of humanity, should the [...] intolerance continue. [...] "The way we behave, to treat one another the way we're treating one another, to maintain this level of intolerance and discriminatory prejudice... hateful behavior towards <b>other</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> who are different than you are," [...] Madonna concluded.|$|E

500|$|James F. McGrath of the {{religious}} website Patheos found that [...] "A Town Called Mercy" [...] had strong religious themes and moral messages, writing that it [...] "really is about mercy, about forgiveness, about war crimes, about vengeance, and about justice". He interpreted Amy's comment about how the Doctor's behaviour was due to his being alone for too long to mean that [...] "when we loosen our ties to <b>other</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings,</b> {{we can begin to}} treat matters of mercy and justice, and the fate of other persons, differently, impersonally". McGrath also noted a [...] "take-home religious message" [...] in the scene near the end where the town gathers in the church while the Gunslinger and the Doctor face off; he felt that it emphasised the importance of valuing human life.|$|E
500|$|The Catechism {{associates}} this commandment {{with the}} three theological virtues. The first virtue, faith, instructs Catholics to believe in God and avoid heresy, apostasy, and schism. The second virtue, hope, cautions Catholics against despair and presumption. According to the Catechism, the last virtue, charity, can be met only if Catholics refrain from indifference or ingratitude toward God, and avoid spiritual laziness and a hatred of God stemming from pride. The Catechism enumerates specific violations of this commandment, including superstition, polytheism, sacrilege, atheism, and all practices of magic and sorcery. It further prohibits astrology, palm reading, and consulting horoscopes or mediums. The Catechism attributes the latter actions to a [...] "desire for power over time, history, {{and in the last}} analysis, <b>other</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> as well as a wish to conciliate hidden powers".|$|E
500|$|The United States Catechism for Adults devotes {{a section}} to in vitro fertilization, stem-cell {{research}} and cloning in its {{explanation of the}} fifth commandment, because these often involve the destruction of human embryos, {{considered to be a}} gravely sinful form of murder. Embryonic stem cell research is called [...] "an immoral means to a good end" [...] and [...] "morally unacceptable." [...] Citing the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith's Instruction on Respect for Human Life in its Origin and on the Dignity of Procreation, the US Bishops quote: [...] "No objective, even though noble in itself, such as a foreseeable advantage to science, to <b>other</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings,</b> or to society, can in any way justify experimentation on living human embryos or fetuses, whether viable or not, either inside or outside the mother's body." [...] The Bishops note that adult stem cell research, using cells obtained with informed consent, is a promising field of research that is morally acceptable.|$|E
