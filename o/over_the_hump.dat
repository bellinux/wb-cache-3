5|$|Brereton sent Haynes to Dinjan Airfield in the Indian {{state of}} Assam to {{continue}} his supply-line work under the name Assam-Burma-China Ferry Command, or ABC Ferry Command, with the mission of supplying American forces in China. This air organization was formed to carry supplies <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hump,</b> the air route replacement for the enemy-held Burma Road. At first, Haynes worked with only two C-47 transports, and was accompanied on some missions by just one P-40 Warhawk fighter flown by the outfit's executive of operations, Colonel Robert Lee Scott, Jr., who had shifted to flying a fighter once HALPRO was canceled. When Burma appeared to be falling to the Japanese, Haynes {{and a handful of}} other airmen of the Chinese National Aviation Corporation and the Royal Air Force flew hundreds of evacuation missions from April to mid-June, bringing some 4,500 passengers westward to safety in India. The American ferry aircraft would typically deliver supplies to China then stop in Burma on the way back to Assam.|$|E
5|$|Seven of the {{participants}} became general officers. Hull was recalled to active duty to be an intelligence officer in World War II, then remained in the Air Force as a career. He retired as a brigadier general in 1964. Meloy served as a brigadier general in the Air Transport Command and retired in 1946. Goddard was recognized as the principal aerial photography expert of the USAF and retired in 1953 as a brigadier general. Caleb V. Haynes and his crew won the MacKay Trophy in 1939 flying an earthquake relief mission to Chile in the XB-15, and delivered the first B-24 Liberator overseas in early 1942. Assigned initially to the Tenth Air Force, {{he was the first}} commander of the Assam-Burma-China Ferry Command, the airlift operation flying supplies <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hump</b> to China. Haynes went on to command the bombers of the China Air Task Force under Maj. Gen. Claire Chennault, became a brigadier general, commanded the India Air Task Force, and retired from the USAF as a major general in 1953.|$|E
25|$|CNAC pilots made a key {{contribution}} to India-China flight operations. Between 1942 and 1945, the Chinese received 100 transport aircraft from the United States: 77 C-47s and 23 C-46s. Of the eventual 776,532 gross tons and approximately 650,000 net tons transported <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hump,</b> CNAC pilots accounted for 75,000 tons (about 12%). The India-China airlift continued beyond {{the end of}} the war. The final missions of the ICD, made after most of its attached organizations had departed, were the transporting of 47,000 U.S. personnel west <b>over</b> <b>The</b> <b>Hump</b> from China to Karachi for return to the United States.|$|E

25|$|By {{at least}} 1200 BC, the first camel saddles had appeared, and Bactrian camels could be ridden. The first saddle was {{positioned}} {{to the back}} of the camel, and control of the Bactrian camel was exercised by means of a stick. However, between 500–100 BC, Bactrian camels attained military use. New saddles, which were inflexible and bent, were put <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>humps</b> and divided <b>the</b> rider's weight <b>over</b> <b>the</b> animal. In the seventh century BC, the military Arabian saddle appeared, which again improved the saddle design slightly.|$|R
25|$|Speed {{cushions}} are a type {{of speed}} hump installation designed to alleviate the negative impacts that vertical deflections have on emergency vehicle response times. Speed cushions installations are typically made up of several small speed <b>humps</b> installed across <b>the</b> width of the road with spaces between them. They force normal cars to slow down as they ride with one or both wheels <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>humps.</b> Meanwhile, they allow fire engines (and other large vehicles) with wider axles to straddle the cushions without slowing down.|$|R
25|$|Also on 17 May, a {{force of}} two Chinese regiments, Unit Galahad (Merrill's Marauders) and Kachin guerrillas {{captured}} the airfield at Myitkyina. The Allies did not immediately follow up this success and the Japanese were able to reinforce the town, which fell only after a siege which lasted until 3 August. The capture of Myitkyina airfield nevertheless immediately helped secure the air link from India to Chongqing <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hump.</b>|$|E
25|$|In February 1945, Scott was {{transferred}} to Dum Dum Airfield on the northeastern edge of Calcutta, India {{and away from the}} front lines. Dum Dum airfield served as a major supply point for ferrying supplies to Chiang Kai-shek’s forces in Kunming, China. Scott flew cargo and personnel <b>over</b> <b>The</b> <b>Hump</b> from in both Curtiss-Wright C-46 Commandos and C-47 aircraft. With the war over, on December 16, 1945, Scott returned to the United States.|$|E
25|$|In the end, Stilwell's plan {{to train}} and {{modernize}} thirty Chinese divisions in China (as well as two or three divisions from forces already in India) was never fully realized. As Chennault predicted, supplies carried over the Ledo Road at no time approached tonnage levels of supplies airlifted monthly into China via the Hump. In July 1945, 71,000 tons of supplies were flown <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hump,</b> compared to only 6,000 tons using the Ledo Road, and the airlift operation continued in operation {{until the end of}} the war. By the time supplies were flowing over the Ledo Road in large quantities, operations in other theaters had shaped the course of the war against Japan. Stilwell's drive into North Burma, however, allowed Air Transport Command to fly supplies into China more quickly and safely by allowing American planes to fly a more southerly route without fear of Japanese fighters. American airplanes no longer had to make the dangerous venture <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hump,</b> increasing the delivery of supplies from 18,000 tons in June 1944, to 39,000 tons in November 1944. On August 1, 1945 a plane crossed the hump every one minute and 12 seconds.|$|E
50|$|The {{race was}} the last time the 24 Hours of Le Mans ran without the two chicanes on the Mulsanne Straight; for the {{interest}} of safety to reduce speeds after speeds reaching 250 mph in the previous years and this race, these chicanes were installed the following year and have been used ever since. The speeds on the Mulsanne Straight were so high that many of the drivers were concerned if their cars would stay on <b>the</b> ground <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>humps</b> and bumps of the straight. Fortunately, there were no serious accidents, something Le Mans in the 1980s had many of.|$|R
50|$|It was {{discovered}} in the 1980s that Balquhain had lunar associations. The eastern flanker is aligned to the most southerly moonrise at 172 degrees, whilst the western flanker is aligned to the minor moonset at 232 degrees. The major moonset is aligned <b>over</b> <b>the</b> central <b>hump</b> of <b>the</b> recumbent stone at 190 degrees.|$|R
50|$|By {{the time}} the A7s entered LNER {{ownership}} in 1923, the A7s had been relegated to shunting in the larger marshalling yards. Their power was invaluable when shunting heavy trains <b>over</b> <b>the</b> shunting <b>hump.</b> In <b>the</b> 1930s, Nos. 1136 and 1175 were allocated to hauling chalk quarry trains from Hessle Quarry to Stoneferry Cement Works, in the Hull area.|$|R
25|$|After the Japanese {{occupied}} Burma, China {{was almost}} completely {{cut off from}} Allied aid and materiel except through the hazardous route of flying cargo aircraft <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hump.</b> Early on, the Roosevelt administration and the War Department had given priority to other theaters for U.S. combat forces, equipment, and logistical support. With {{the closure of the}} Burma Road and the fall of Burma, it was realized that even replacing Chinese war losses would be extremely difficult. Consequently, the Allies' initial strategy was to keep Chinese resistance to the Japanese going by providing a lifeline of logistical and air support.|$|E
25|$|The Japanese Fifteenth Army {{consisted}} of three infantry divisions and a brigade-sized detachment ("Yamamoto Force"), and initially a regiment from the Indian National Army. Mutaguchi, the Army commander, planned to cut off and destroy the forward divisions of IV Corps before capturing Imphal, while the Japanese 31st Division isolated Imphal by capturing Kohima. Mutaguchi intended to exploit the capture of Imphal by capturing the strategic city of Dimapur, in the Brahmaputra River valley. If this could be achieved, {{the lines of communication}} to General Stilwell's forces and the airbases used to supply the Chinese <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hump</b> would be cut.|$|E
25|$|Convinced {{that the}} Chinese soldier was {{the equal of}} any given proper care and leadership, Stilwell {{established}} a training center (in Ramgarh, India, 200 miles west of Calcutta) for two divisions of Chinese troops from forces that had retreated to Assam from Burma. His effort in this regard met passive, sometimes active, resistance from the British, who feared that armed, disciplined Chinese would {{set an example for}} Indian insurgents, and from Chiang Kai-shek who did not welcome a strong military unit outside of his control. From the outset, Stilwell's primary goals were the opening of a land route to China from northern Burma and India by means of a ground offensive in northern Burma, so that more supplies could be transported to China, and to organize, equip, and train a reorganized, reequipped, modernized, and competent Chinese army that would fight the Japanese in the China-Burma-India theater (CBI). Stilwell argued that the CBI was the only area at that time where the possibility existed for the Allies of engaging large numbers of troops against their common enemy, Japan. Unfortunately, the huge airborne logistical train of support from the USA to British India was still being organized, while supplies being flown <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hump</b> were barely sufficient to maintain Chennault's air operations and replace some Chinese war losses, let alone equip and supply an entire army. Additionally, critical supplies intended for the CBI were being diverted due to various crises in other combat theaters. Of the supplies that made it <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hump</b> a certain percentage were diverted by Chinese (and American) personnel into the black market for their personal enrichment. As a result, most Allied commanders in India, with the exception of General Orde Wingate and his Chindit operations, were focused on defensive measures.|$|E

25|$|The 2nd MATS {{moved in}} {{entirety}} from its base at Dergaon to Luliang Field, China, completing the deployment by December 13. The 1st MATS operated from Ledo, and ICD's 1348th AAF Base Unit at Myitkyina South airfield coordinated the entire operation {{and provided the}} staging base for refueling all transports. The C-46s moved the 14th Division from five airfields in Burma, including a field at Nansin whose construction was completed December 4. Takeoffs there were subject to artillery and sniper fire. The 1348th Base Unit scheduled operations 24 {{hours a day and}} in bad weather, although the operation was suspended between 16 and 22 December when the situation in China seemed improved. Of the six pick-up fields, only Myitkyina South was capable of night operations, and troop carrier C-47s were used to shuttle troops there during the day for ICD aircraft to fly <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hump</b> at night.|$|E
25|$|Following Chennault's advice, Generalissimo Chiang {{rejected}} the proposal; British commanders sided with Chennault, aware {{they could not}} launch a coordinated Allied offensive into Burma in 1943 with the resources then available. During the summer of 1943, Stilwell's headquarters concentrated on plans to rebuild the Chinese Army for an offensive in northern Burma, despite Chiang's insistence on support to Chennault's air operations. Stilwell believed that after forcing a supply route through northern Burma {{by means of a}} major ground offensive against the Japanese, he could train and equip thirty Chinese divisions with modern combat equipment. A smaller number of Chinese forces would transfer to India, where two or three new Chinese divisions would also be raised. This plan remained only theoretical at the time, since the limited available airlift capacity for deliveries of supplies to China <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hump</b> was used to sustain Chennault's air operations instead of equipping Chinese ground units.|$|E
25|$|During the 2009 {{recruiting}} cycle, Texas acquired top-tier prospects Avery Bradley and Jordan Hamilton. Partnered with veteran Damion James, center Dexter Pittman {{and a solid}} {{stable of}} guards, the Longhorns achieved their first-ever No. 1 ranking in 2010, roaring to a 17–0 start. Texas' fortunes turned upside-down with a 71–62 loss {{on the road to}} Kansas State and the ensuing 88–74 loss to Connecticut, beginning a 7–10 finish and raising the pressure for Barnes' Texas teams to reach <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>hump,</b> a recurring theme in the head coach's final six seasons in Austin. More of the same occurred in 2011, when Texas garnered two elite prospects in Canadians Tristan Thompson and Cory Joseph and had a similar scorching (23–3) start—only to lose the league to Kansas again and fall {{in the second round of}} the NCAA Tournament to the Arizona Wildcats. Bradley left the program for the NBA in 2010, and Hamilton, Thompson, and Joseph followed suit in 2011.|$|E

25|$|After {{business}} school, McNamara {{worked a}} year for the accounting firm Price Waterhouse in San Francisco, then returned to Harvard in August 1940 to teach accounting in the business school and became the highest paid and youngest assistant professor at that time. Following his involvement there in a program to teach analytical approaches used in business to officers of the United States Army Air Forces, he entered the USAAF as a captain in early 1943, serving most of World War II with its Office of Statistical Control. One of his major responsibilities was the analysis of U.S. bombers' efficiency and effectiveness, especially the B-29 forces commanded by Major General Curtis LeMay in India, China, and the Mariana Islands. McNamara established a statistical control unit for the XX Bomber Command and devised schedules for B-29s doubling as transports for carrying fuel and cargo <b>over</b> <b>The</b> <b>Hump.</b> He left active duty in 1946 with the rank of lieutenant colonel and with a Legion of Merit.|$|E
25|$|Giles was {{promoted}} to lieutenant colonel in February 1941, to colonel in January 1942, and to brigadier general in March. In July, General Giles went to Hamilton Field just north of San Francisco where he organized and commanded the 4th Air Service Area Command. Giles received his second star in September 1942. He was named director of military requirements and assistant chief of air staff for operations in March 1943 and chief of Air Staff in July. Giles was appointed lieutenant general in May 1943 and in July was named deputy commander of the Army Air Forces. In this role, he often served as acting head of Army Air Forces because of General Arnold's prolonged illness. Giles actively promoted the development of long-range capabilities for fighter aircraft such as P-38 Lightnings, P-47 Thunderbolts and P-51 Mustangs. He went to the China-Burma-India Theater in mid-July and held a conference with commanders to arrive at some agreement on the allocation of tonnage <b>over</b> <b>The</b> <b>Hump.</b>|$|E
25|$|Both the {{accident}} {{rate and the}} raw number of accidents decreased notably {{as a result of}} these measures with the exception of the C-87/C-109 types, which remained 500% higher than on the C-54. Tunner called for their replacement entirely by C-54s and plans were drawn up to increase the Skymaster force to 272 by October 1945 and 540 by April 1946. With a fleet of 410 C-46s augmenting the ICD, the tonnage lift capability <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hump</b> was predicted to become more than 86,000 tons per month. A shortage of C-54 engines hampered the plan, which was modified to have a quarter of the force always in a pipeline between India and Florida for engine changes, carrying cargo and passengers as they traveled in both directions. The modified plan was approved in April 1945 and Morrison Field, Florida, was chosen for the maintenance but it proved an impediment to success when C-54s sent there remained at the field for periods five times the seven days originally estimated for turnaround.|$|E
50|$|The {{body size}} of living {{specimens}} of Pseudunela viatoris is 3-4 mm.

25|$|In {{coordination}} with a southern offensive by Nationalist Chinese forces under General Wei Li-huang, Allied troops under Stilwell's command launched the long-awaited invasion of northern Burma; after heavy fighting and casualties, the two forces linked up in January 1945. Stilwell's strategy remained unchanged: opening a new ground supply route from India to China {{would allow the}} Allies to equip and train new Chinese army divisions for use against the Japanese. The new road network, later called the Ledo Road, would link {{the northern end of}} the Burma Road as the primary supply route to China; Stilwell's staff planners had estimated the route would supply 65,000 tons of supplies per month. Using these figures, Stilwell argued that the Ledo Road network would greatly surpass the tonnage being airlifted <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hump.</b> General Chennault doubted that such an extended network of trails through difficult jungle could ever match the tonnage that could be delivered with modern cargo transport aircraft then deploying in-theater. Progress on the Ledo Road was slow, and could not be completed until the linkup of forces in January 1945.|$|E
25|$|In October, the {{regiment}} was flown to Myitkyina, entering combat {{with the task}} force. The regiment moved into the mountains of northern Burma on 15 December, and in subsequent months fought in numerous pitched battles with Japanese troops {{in and around the}} Burma Road. The 124th conducted long range operations deep behind Japanese lines, and used pack mules and aerial resupply. The 124th built roadblocks along the Burma Road during the campaign to wrest the road from Japanese control below Nankam. To block the road at Nampakka, it moved over 300 miles in Japanese-held territory, relying only on aerial resupply. On 15 January 1945, {{the regiment}} met in battle with Japanese forces. Troop F commander 1st Lieutenant Jack L. Knight was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions on 2 February 1945 near Loi Kang, in which he singlehandedly knocked out two Japanese pill boxes and continued the attack despite having been blinded by a Japanese grenade. Knight was the only Army Ground Forces recipient of the Medal of Honor in the China-Burma-India Theatre of the war. The regiment subsequently moved south along the Burma Road, reaching Lashio by 23 March. Between 26 April and 14 May, the regiment was flown <b>over</b> <b>The</b> <b>Hump</b> to Kunming in China.
