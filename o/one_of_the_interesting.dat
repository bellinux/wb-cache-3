25|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interesting</b> coincidences {{of the war}} {{was that}} the Germans had already {{developed}} their own version of chaff under the code-name Düppel, and had tested it near Berlin and over the Baltic. However, Hermann Göring was worried that if they used Düppel over the UK, the RAF would quickly copy the concept and use it against them. As Bomber Command's fleet was rapidly growing, the results would likely be greatly in the RAF's favour. Learning from past mistakes when older material had leaked, Göring had most of the paperwork on Düppel destroyed.|$|E
25|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interesting</b> {{dynamics}} of conservation of this butterfly {{is associated with}} increased nitrogen through air pollution. Increased nitrogen increases the fertility of serpentine soils, soils naturally low in nitrogen. This increased fertility allows invasive plants to thrive and exclude the nectar sources that the Bay checkerspot needs. This is where moderate grazing brings help to the threatened checkerspot. In a large metapopulation south of San Jose, removal of cattle from grasslands that the butterfly inhabited led to {{a significant decrease in}} the butterfly population because grazing leads to a net export of nitrogen as the cattle are removed for slaughter after eating the plants of the grasslands. In this way, moderate grazing enhances the butterfly's chance for survival.|$|E

2500|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interesting</b> {{properties}} of the Fourier transform which we have mentioned, is that it carries convolutions to pointwise products. If that is the property which we seek to preserve, one can produce Fourier series on any compact group. Typical examples include those classical groups that are compact. This generalizes the Fourier transform to all spaces of the form L2(G), where G is a compact group, {{in such a way}} that the Fourier transform carries convolutions to pointwise products. The Fourier series exists and converges in similar ways to the [...] case.|$|E

This is essentially saying that temperature comes either from some source or from earlier in time because heat permeates but is not created from nothingness. This is a property of parabolic partial differential equations and is not difficult to prove mathematically (see below).|$|E

2500|$|Fluorescence {{correlation}} spectroscopy (FCS) [...] is a correlation analysis of fluctuation of the fluorescence intensity. The analysis provides {{parameters of the}} physics under the fluctuations. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interesting</b> applications of this is {{an analysis of the}} concentration fluctuations of fluorescent particles (molecules) in solution. In this application, the fluorescence emitted from a very tiny space in solution containing a small number of fluorescent particles (molecules) is observed. The fluorescence intensity is fluctuating due to Brownian motion of the particles. In other words, the number of the particles in the sub-space defined by the optical system is randomly changing around the average number. The analysis gives the average number of fluorescent particles and average diffusion time, when the particle is passing through the space. Eventually, both the concentration and size of the particle (molecule) are determined. Both parameters are important in biochemical research, biophysics, and chemistry.|$|E
2500|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interesting</b> {{problems}} in Schumann resonances studies is determining the lightning source characteristics (the [...] "inverse problem"). Temporally resolving each individual flash is impossible because the mean rate of excitation by lightning, ~50 lightning events per second globally, mixes up the individual contributions together. [...] However, occasionally extremely large lightning flashes occur which produce distinctive signatures that {{stand out from}} the background signals. Called [...] "Q-bursts", they are produced by intense lightning strikes that transfer large amounts of charge from clouds to the ground and often carry high peak current. Q-bursts can exceed the amplitude of the background signal level by a factor of 10 or more and appear with intervals of ~10 s, which allows to consider them as isolated events and determine the source lightning location. The source location is determined with either multi-station or single-station techniques and requires assuming a model for the Earth–ionosphere cavity. The multi-station techniques are more accurate, but require more complicated and expensive facilities.|$|E

[...] Unlike most extremists, his 'brain storms' have met with more frequent reward. [...] It must not be inferred from this, however, that Yost does not know the game from the ground up – merely that any move he makes is absorbingly interesting for the reason that something fancy is apt to develop from it without notice to or benefit of clergy for his opponent. [...] The more startling type of play usually comes out of the West, anyway; for the Westerners like shortcuts to victory." ...|$|E

60|$|He had proof, {{the next}} morning, that the editor had acted promptly, {{at least so}} far as {{regarded}} the house. The house had approved his plan, if one could trust the romantic paragraph which Verrian found in his paper at breakfast, exploiting the fact concerned as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interesting</b> evidences of the hold his serial had got with the magazine readers. He recognized in the paragraph the touch of the good fellow who prepared the weekly bulletins of the house, and offered the press literary intelligence in a form ready for immediate use.

Yet Verrian felt, in reading the paragraph, a shock of guilty dismay, as if he had betrayed a confidence reposed in him, and he handed the paper across the table to his mother with rather a sick look.|$|E
6000|$|But {{from the}} same high windows we catch without any {{stretching}} of the neck a still more indispensable note in the picture, a famous pretender eating the bread of bitterness. This repast is served in the open air, on a neat little terrace, by attendants in livery, {{and there is no}} indiscretion in our seeing that the pretender dines. Ever since the table d'hôte in [...] "Candide" [...] Venice has been the refuge of monarchs in want of thrones--she would n't know herself without her rois en exil. The exile is agreeable and soothing, the gondola lets them down gently. Its movement is an anodyne, its silence a philtre, and little by little it rocks all ambitions to sleep. The proscript has plenty of leisure to write his proclamations and even his memoirs, and I believe he has organs in which they are published; but the only noise he makes in the world is the harmless splash of his oars. He comes and goes along the Canalazzo, and he might be much worse employed. He is but <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interesting</b> objects it presents, however, and I am by no means sure that he is the most striking. He has a rival, if not in the iron bridge, which, alas, is within our range, at least--to take an immediate example--in the Montecuculi Palace. Far-descended and weary, but beautiful in its crooked old age, with its lovely proportions, its delicate round arches, its carvings and its disks of marble, is the haunted Montecuculi. Those who have a kindness for Venetian gossip like to remember that it was once for a few months the property of Robert Browning, who, however, never lived in it, and who died in the splendid Rezzonico, the residence of his son and a wonderful cosmopolite [...] "document," [...] which, as it presents itself, in an admirable position, but a short way farther down the Canal, we can almost see, in spite of the curve, from the window at which we stand. This great seventeenth century pile, throwing itself upon the water with a peculiar florid assurance, a certain upward toss of its cornice which gives it the air of a rearing sea- horse, decorates immensely--and within, as well as without--the wide angle that it commands.|$|E
