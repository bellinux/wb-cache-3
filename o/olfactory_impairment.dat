40|$|A {{decrease}} in olfactory function with increasing age {{has been well}} reported (1, 2). We previously reported a 27. 0 % (3) prevalence of <b>olfactory</b> <b>impairment</b> among Blue Mountains Eye Study (BMES) participants aged 60 years or older. This rate was comparable to the 24. 5 % rate observed in the Wisconsin Epidemiology of Hearing Loss Study for persons aged 43 – 86 years (2), and the 32. 9 % prevalence in persons aged 53 years or older in the Skövde study (4). In spite of this relatively high prevalence, <b>olfactory</b> <b>impairment</b> {{appears to have been}} overlooked compared with dysfunction of other senses, such as vision and hear-ing. Although hearing and seeing are obviously of greater interest to humans, the sense of smell encompasses a wide range of functions (5).

40|$|Decreased smell {{could cause}} {{appetite}} suppression and malnutrition. However, {{there is a}} paucity of longitudinal data between olfaction and nutritional status in older adults. We aimed to prospectively {{examine the relationship between}} <b>olfactory</b> <b>impairment</b> and overall diet quality (reflecting adherence to dietary guidelines) in a population-based cohort of older adults. Methods: We used 5 -year follow-up data from 557 adults (aged 60 + years at baseline) whose olfaction was measured using the San Diego Odor Identification Test (SDOIT). Dietary data were collected using a validated semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire. A total diet score (TDS) was calculated for intake of selected food groups and nutrients for each participant as described in the national dietary guidelines. Final scores ranged from 0 to 20; higher scores indicated closer adherence to dietary guidelines. Results: After adjusting for all potential confounders, older adults with moderate/severe <b>olfactory</b> <b>impairment</b> (SDOIT score ≤ 3; lower scores indicate impairment) compared with those with no <b>olfactory</b> <b>impairment</b> had significantly lower adjusted mean (±SE) TDS, 9. 09 (0. 40) versus 9. 94 (0. 10), p = 0. 04. Women with moderate/severe impaired olfaction (i. e., scored poorly on the odor identification test) compared with those with normal olfaction had significantly lower adjusted mean TDS, 8. 87 (0. 69) versus 10. 31 (0. 13), p = 0. 04. No associations were observed between olfaction and TDS in men. Conclusions: <b>Olfactory</b> <b>impairment</b> in older women could signal an increased risk of poorer diet quality, defined as adherence to national dietary guidelines. Additional longitudinal studies are needed to confirm or refute the observed link between olfactory loss and overall patterns of food intake in older adults...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Olfactory</b> <b>impairment</b> is {{increasingly}} {{recognized as an}} early symptom {{in the development of}} Parkinson's disease. Testing olfactory function is a non-invasive method but can be time-consuming which restricts its application in clinical settings and epidemiological studies. Here, we investigate odor identification as a supportive diagnostic tool for Parkinson's disease and estimate the performance of odor subsets to allow a more rapid testing of <b>olfactory</b> <b>impairment.</b> METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Odor identification was assessed with 16 Sniffin' sticks in 148 Parkinson patients and 148 healthy controls. Risks of <b>olfactory</b> <b>impairment</b> were estimated with proportional odds models. Random forests were applied to classify Parkinson and non-Parkinson patients. Parkinson patients were rarely normosmic (identification of more than 12 odors; 16. 8 %) and identified on average seven odors whereas the reference group identified 12 odors and showed a higher prevalence of normosmy (31. 1 %). Parkinson patients with rigidity dominance had a twofold greater prevalence of <b>olfactory</b> <b>impairment.</b> Disease severity was associated with impairment of odor identification (per score point of the Hoehn and Yahr rating OR 1. 87, 95 % CI 1. 26 - 2. 77). Age-related impairment of olfaction showed a steeper gradient in Parkinson patients. Coffee, peppermint, and anise showed the largest difference in odor identification between Parkinson patients and controls. Random forests estimated a misclassification rate of 22. 4 % when comparing Parkinson patients with healthy controls using all 16 odors. A similar rate (23. 8 %) was observed when only the three aforementioned odors were applied. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings indicate that testing odor identification can be a supportive diagnostic tool for Parkinson's disease. The application of only three odors performed well in discriminating Parkinson patients from controls, which can facilitate a wider application of this method as a point-of-care test...|$|E
40|$|International audienceNumerous {{clinical}} reports {{underscore the}} frequency of <b>olfactory</b> <b>impairments</b> in patients suffering from major depressive disorders (MDDs), yet the underlying physiopathological mechanisms remain poorly understood. We hypothesized that one key link between olfactory deficits and MDD lies in hypercortisolemia, a cardinal symptom of MDD. Corticosterone (CORT) is known to negatively correlate with hippocampal neurogenesis, yet its effects on olfactory neurogenesis and olfaction remain unknown. Here we used a rodent model of anxiety/depression-like states, {{which is based on}} chronic CORT administration and studied the effects of the antidepressant fluoxetine (FLX) on behavior, olfaction, and adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG), olfactory bulb (OB), and the olfactory epithelium (OE). Chronic CORT had no effect on cell proliferation in the OE or on olfactory sensory neurons projecting to the OB, but induced pronounced deficits in olfactory acuity, fine discrimination of odorants and olfactory memory. These alterations were accompanied by a significant {{decrease in the number of}} adult-born neurons in both the DG and OB. Remarkably, FLX not only reversed depression-like states as expected, but also improved olfactory acuity, memory, and restored impaired adult neurogenesis. However, fine olfactory discrimination was not restored. Morphological analysis of adult-born neurons in both the DG and the OB showed that dendritic complexity was not significantly affected by CORT, but was increased by FLX. These findings demonstrate an essential role for glucocorticoids in triggering <b>olfactory</b> <b>impairments</b> in MDD and highlight a novel therapeutic effect of FLX. Increasing clinical reports show that major depression is characterized by pronounced olfactory deficits, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. In this work, we used an endocrine model of depression to study whether hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis perturbation could be sufficient to provoke <b>olfactory</b> <b>impairments.</b> We found that chronic corticosterone not only induces marked deficits in olfactory acuity, fine discrimination and olfactory memory, but also significantly decreases bulbar and hippocampal neurogenesis. Importantly, the antidepressant fluoxetine restores both adult neurogenesis and depressive states, and improves most olfactory functions. Our data reveal that impairment of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis during depression can lead to olfactory deficits and that the neurogenic effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants can successfully restore certain olfactory functions...|$|R
40|$|Olfactory {{abilities}} are crucial {{in the development}} and maintenance of alcoholism, but while they have been widely explored in other psychiatric states, little is known concerning this sensorial modality among alcoholics. The present study explored the brain correlates of the olfaction deficit in alcoholism. Ten alcoholics and ten matched controls took part in psychophysical and electrophysiological olfactory testing. At behavioural level, we showed odor identification deficits in alcoholism, for orthonasal and retronasal testing. Electrophysiological data showed abnormalities (in latency and amplitude) for N 1 and P 2 olfactory components among alcoholics, which constitutes the first description of the cerebral correlates of <b>olfactory</b> <b>impairments</b> in alcoholism. This deficit appears associated with alterations in the brain structures responsible for the secondary, "cognitive" processing of odors. These results underline the need to take into account olfactory deficits in clinical practice and in studies exploring brain correlates of craving by means of alcohol odors...|$|R
40|$|Clinical {{olfactory}} {{tests are}} used to address hyposmia/anosmia levels in patients with different types of <b>olfactory</b> <b>impairments.</b> Typically, a given test is employed clinically and then replaced by a new one after {{a certain period of}} use which can range from days to several months.

In this paper we propose a protocol to employ low cost artificial noses for the quantitative characterization of olfactory tests used in clinical studies. In particular, we discuss a preliminary study on the Connecticut Chemosensorial Clinical Research Center Test kit which shows that some odorants, as sensed by an artificial nose, seem to degrade while others are potentiated as the test ages.

40|$|AbstractProgressive <b>olfactory</b> <b>impairment</b> {{is one of}} the {{earliest}} markers of neurodegeneration. However, the underlying mechanism for this dysfunction remains unclear. The present study investigated the possible role of microgliosis in olfactory deficits using a mouse model of Niemann–Pick disease type C 1 (NPC 1), which is an incurable neurodegenerative disorder with disrupted lipid trafficking. At 7 weeks of age, NPC 1 mutants showed a distinct <b>olfactory</b> <b>impairment</b> in an olfactory test compared with age-matched wild-type controls (WT). The marked loss of olfactory sensory neurons within the NPC 1 affected olfactory bulb (NPC 1 -OB) suggests that NPC 1 dysfunction impairs olfactory structure. Furthermore, the pool of neuroblasts in the OB was diminished in NPC 1 mice despite the intact proliferative capacity of neural stem/progenitor cells in the subventricular zone. Instead, pro-inflammatory proliferating microglia accumulated extensively in the NPC 1 -OB as the disease progressed. To evaluate the impact of abnormal microglial activation on olfaction in NPC 1 mice, a microglial inhibition study was performed using the anti-inflammatory agent Cyclosporin A (CsA). Importantly, long-term CsA treatment in NPC 1 mice reduced reactive microgliosis, restored the survival of newly generated neurons in the OB and improved overall performance on the olfactory test. Therefore, our study highlights the possible role of microglia in the regulation of neuronal turnover in the OB and provides insight into the possible therapeutic applications of microglial inhibition in the attenuation or reversal of <b>olfactory</b> <b>impairment...</b>|$|E
40|$|Olfactory {{function}} {{is a well-known}} early biomarker for neurodegeneration and neural functioning in the adult population, being supported {{by a number of}} brain structures that could be dysfunctioning in neurodegenerative processes. Evidence has suggested that atypical sensory and, particularly, olfactory processing is present in several neurodevelopmental conditions, including autism spectrum disorders (ASDs).

40|$|Olfactory {{dysfunction}} constitutes one of {{the earliest}} signs of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and has been shown in individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). Whether the severity of <b>olfactory</b> <b>impairments</b> in aMCI patients parallels those in AD has not been clearly established. In addition, given reports of asymmetries in neuropathological burden in early AD, functional asymmetries in olfactory performance may enhance early detection if olfactory function is assessed unirhinally. We compared AD, aMCI, and healthy participants on olfactory identification and memory assessed unirhinally. Olfactory identification was most proficient in the healthy participants and least proficient in AD, although this disparity did not depend on nostril side. Nevertheless, when only the worst nostril of each participant was included in the analysis, aMCI patients outperformed their AD counterparts. In contrast, when only the best nostril of each participant was included in the analysis—often regarded as an estimate of birhinal performance—this difference between aMCI and AD dissipated. Olfactory memory did not differ significantly across the groups, perhaps reflecting a floor effect. The findings support the hypothesis that unirhinal olfactory assessment may assist in differentiating between demented and nondemented individuals.

Results Part I indicated that the most effective paradigm for stimulus presentation was cued stimulus, with an interstimulus interval of 18 - 20 s at a stimulus duration of 1000 ms with each stimulus quality presented 60 times in blocks of 20 stimuli each.

Correlations with MR-derived indices of CSF volume showed a highly significant relationship between UPSIT scores and cortical sulcal volumes.

We followed a sample of 1529 participants, who were within a normal range of overall cognitive function at baseline, over a 10 -year period during which 159 were classified as having a dementia disorder. Dementia conversion was predicted from demographic variables, Mini-Mental State Examination score, and olfactory assessments. Self-reported <b>olfactory</b> <b>impairment</b> emerged as an independent predictor of dementia.

PROCEDURES: 10 healthy volunteers and 21 patients enrolled in the study (19 males and 12 females; 26 - 71 years old). The causes of olfactory dysfunction in the patients were head trauma (n =  7), upper respiratory tract infection (n =  7), and chronic rhinosinusitis (n =  7). (201) TlCl was administered unilaterally to the olfactory cleft, and SPECT-CT was conducted 24 h later. Separate MRI images were merged with the SPECT images.

40|$|In many systems, sleep plays a {{vital role}} in memory {{consolidation}} and synaptic homeostasis. These processes together help store information of biological significance and reset synaptic circuits to facilitate acquisition of information in the future. In this review, we describe recent evidence of sleep-dependent changes in olfactory system structure and function which contribute to odor memory and perception. During slow-wave sleep, the piriform cortex becomes hypo-responsive to odor stimulation and instead displays sharp-wave activity similar to that observed within the hippocampal formation. Furthermore, the functional connectivity between the piriform cortex and other cortical and limbic regions is enhanced during slow-wave sleep compared to waking. This combination of conditions may allow odor memory consolidation to occur during a state of reduced external interference and facilitate association of odor memories with stored hedonic and contextual cues. Evidence consistent with sleep-dependent odor replay within olfactory cortical circuits is presented. These data suggest that both the strength and precision of odor memories is sleep-dependent. The work further emphasizes the critical role of synaptic plasticity and memory in not only odor memory but also basic odor perception. The work also suggests a possible link between sleep disturbances that are frequently co-morbid {{with a wide range of}} pathologies including Alzheimer’s disease, schizophrenia and depression and the known <b>olfactory</b> <b>impairments</b> associated with those disorders...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSubventricular zone (SVZ) {{neurogenesis}} continuously provides new GABA-and dopamine (DA) -containing interneurons for the olfac-tory bulb (OB) in most adult mammals. DAergic interneurons {{are located}} in the glomerular layer (GL) where they participate in the processing of sensory inputs. To examine whether adult neurogenesis might contribute to regeneration after circuit injury in mice, we induce DAergic neuronal loss by injecting 6 -hydroxydopamine (6 -OHDA) in the dorsal GL or in the right substantia nigra pars compacta. We found that a 6 -OHDA treatment of the OB produces olfactory deficits and local inflammation and partially decreases the number of neurons expressing the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) near the injected site. Blockade of inflammation by minocycline treatment immediately after the 6 -OHDA administration rescued neither TH ϩ interneuron number nor the olfactory deficits, suggesting that the <b>olfactory</b> <b>impairments</b> are most likely linked to TH ϩ cell death and not to microglial activation. TH ϩ interneuron number was restored 1 month later. This rescue resulted at least in part from enhanced recruitment of immature neurons targeting the lesioned GL area. Seven days after 6 -OHDA lesion in the OB, we found that the integration of lentivirus-labeled adult-born neurons was biased: newly formed neurons were preferentially incorporated into glomerular circuits of the lesioned area. Behavioral rehabilitation occurs 2 months after lesion. This study establishes a new model into which loss of DAergic cells could be compensated by recruiting newly formed neurons.

Light can be used to stabilise the circadian rhythm, which may be disturbed in dementia. Music therapy, aromatherapy, massage and multisensory stimulation are recommended by NICE for the management of behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), although the mechanisms behind such interventions are poorly understood and evidence is limited.

40|$|Although the {{presence}} of an <b>olfactory</b> <b>impairment</b> in Parkinson's disease (PD) has been recognized for 25 years, its cause remains unclear. Here we suggest a contributing factor to this impairment, namely, that PD impairs active sniffing of odorants. We tested 10 men and 10 women with clinically typical PD, and 20 age- and gender-matched healthy controls, in four olfactory tasks: (i) the University of Pennsylvania smell identification test; (ii and iii) detection threshold tests for the odorants vanillin and propionic acid; and (iv) a two-alternative forced-choice detection paradigm during which sniff parameters (airflow peak rate, mean rate, volume, and duration) were recorded with a pneomatotachograph-coupled spirometer. An additional experiment tested the effect of intentionally increasing sniff vigor on olfactory performance in 20 additional patients. PD patients were significantly impaired in olfactory identification (P < 0. 0001) and detection (P < 0. 007). As predicted, PD patients were also significantly impaired at sniffing, demonstrating significantly reduced sniff airflow rate (P < 0. 01) and volume (P < 0. 002). Furthermore, a patient's ability to sniff predicted his or her performance on olfactory tasks, i. e., the more poorly patients sniffed, the worse their performance on olfaction tests (P < 0. 009). Finally, increasing sniff vigor improved olfactory performance in those patients whose baseline performance had been poorest (P < 0. 05). These findings implicate a sniffing impairment as a component of the <b>olfactory</b> <b>impairment</b> in PD and further depict sniffing as an important component of human olfaction...|$|E
40|$|Olfactory {{function}} is significantly and early impaired in neurodegenerative {{diseases such as}} Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. Epigenetic regulation and adult neurogenesis {{are some of the}} major cutting edge research directions in studying the mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative diseases. Leading scientists in these research areas were invited to participate in this symposium to introduce to the chemical senses community their novel insights into the mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative diseases.

There is evidence that impaired human cognitive abilities are reflected by loss of olfactory abilities. Declining olfactory perception may be a biomarker for impairment of cognitive function and of impending neurogenerative disorders. As olfactory perception may differ between culture and ethnic group, we sought to confirm this relationship with Japanese participants. In this study, we examined possible relationships between age and olfactory abilities in healthy Japanese subjects (control subjects) {{over a wide range}} of ages and compared this relationship with that observed in three neurodegenerative disorders; patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), Type 1 myotonic dystrophy (DM 1) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In control subjects, both threshold and recognition abilities decreased with age. Ability to detect odors was generally intact in most control subjects, however, we found that the abilities of individuals in the three different patient populations to recognize odors were impaired relative to control subjects. All three types of patients exhibited decreased or impaired odor-recognition compared with age-matched controls. Previous studies showed the causes of <b>olfactory</b> <b>impairments</b> in PD and AD patients were attributable to pathological changes and MRI signal abnormalities in limbic areas, including the amygdala (AMG), entorhinal cortex (ENT), hippocampus (HI), and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Another study reported that DM 1 patients have bilateral lesions in anterior temporal areas, including the subcortical white matter, AMG, ENT and insula. Our findings underscore the need to pay careful attention to significant decreases of odor identification abilities caused by diverse forms of abnormal brain function, especially in the AMG, ENT and HI.

40|$|Olfactory {{dysfunctions}} {{have been}} frequently observed in ageing, in various neurodegenerative conditions and in psy- chiatric disorders. Notably <b>olfactory</b> <b>impairments</b> that accompany or precede the {{early stage of}} Alzheimer’s disease {{may be seen as}} first clinical biomarkers of the pathology and predictors of the it’s progression. Methods: The present study evaluated odour recognition memory and odour identification in two groups of 12 mild Alzheimer’s disease patients (M age 64. 4 years, range 61 - 77), 12 moderate Alzheimer’s disease patients (M age 67. 2 years, range, 62 - 69), 12 Elderly (Elderly 1 group, M age 65. 3 years, range, 60 - 68) and 12 very Elderly (Elderly 2 group, age 75. 3, years, range, 70 - 83) with the aim to test whether in the Alzheimer’s disease individuals olfactory deficits do occur already at an early stage and increase in function of the disease severity and to examine the influence of ageing on the olfactory efficiency. We were also interested to test, beside the documented impairment in the identification of odours in neurodegenerative diseases and old people, {{the extent to which the}} less investigated odour memory was also impaired. Results: Data analyses showed that moderate Alzheimer’ disease patients performed significantly worse than Mild ones on both tasks and that a similar outcome was observed for the elderly (with the older group of Elderly performing worse than the younger). Conclusions: The present results highlight the presence in Alzheimer’s disease patients of early and progressive olfactory dysfunc- tions and the role of the two olfactory tasks as useful instruments to discriminate between patients characterized by different levels of severity; they also confirm the available data from the literature showing a decrease in olfactory performance in the elderly population beyond the age of 60 - 65 years...|$|R
40|$|Using a {{longitudinal}} study design, two strains of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) model mice, one expressing b-amyloid plaques and one expressing Tau protein-associated neurofibrillary tangles were assessed for olfactory and visuospatial learning and memory and their performance {{compared to that of}} age-matched controls. No significant difference between AD and control mice was found in the initial set of olfactory tasks performed at 6 months of age whereas both strains of AD mice performed significantly poorer than the controls in visuospatial learning at this age. Subsequent tests performed on the same individual animals at 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 15, and 18 months of age also failed to find systematic differences in olfactory performance between AD and control mice. In contrast, the AD mice performed consistently poorer than the controls in visuospatial re-learning tests performed at these ages. With most olfactory tasks, both AD and control mice displayed a marked decrease in performance between testing at 15 and 18 months of age. These results show that the two strains of AD model mice do not display an <b>olfactory</b> <b>impairment</b> in a time course consistent with human AD, but are impaired in visuospatial capabilities. The marked age-related changes observed with the olfactory tasks in both AD and control mice suggest that the observed lack of an AD-related <b>olfactory</b> <b>impairment</b> is not due to an insensitivity of the tests employed. Rather, they suggest that the olfactory system of the two AD mouse model strains may be surprisingly robust against ADtypica...|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Olfactory</b> <b>impairment</b> is {{an early}} manifestation of Parkinsons disease (PD). Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) and Magnetization Transfer (MT) are two imaging {{techniques}} that allow noninvasive detection of microstructural changes in the cerebral white matter. Objective: To assess white matter alterations associated with <b>olfactory</b> <b>impairment</b> in PD, using a binary imaging approach with DTI and MT. Methods: 22 PD patients and 13 healthy controls were examined with DTI, MT and an odor discrimination test. DTI data were first analyzed with tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) in order to detect differences in fractional anisotropy, mean, radial and axial diffusivity between PD patients and controls. Voxelwise randomized permutation was employed for the MT analysis, after spatial and intensity normalization. Additionally, ROI analysis was performed on both the DTI and MT data, focused on the white matter adjacent to olfactory brain regions. Results: Whole brain voxelwise analysis revealed decreased axial diffusivity in the left uncinate fasciculus and the white matter adjacent to the left olfactory sulcus of PD patients. ROI analysis demonstrated decreased axial diffusivity in the right orbitofrontal cortex, as well as decreased mean diffusivity and axial diffusivity in the white matter of the left entorhinal cortex of PD patients. There {{were no significant differences}} regarding fractional anisotropy, radial diffusivity or MT between patients and controls. Conclusions: ROI analysis of DTI could detect microstructural changes in the white matter adjacent to olfactory areas in PD patients, whereas MT imaging could not.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the relation between}} <b>olfactory</b> <b>impairment</b> (OI) and other impairment domains in Parkinson disease (PD) and the characteristics of OI in patients with certain genotypic characteristics. METHODS: In 295 nondemented patients with PD and 150 controls with a similar overall age and sex distribution, olfactory function was evaluated with the identification (ID) and discrimination (DIS) tests of the Sniffin' Sticks. In patients, demographic and clinical characteristics were evaluated, and genetic analyses were performed. RESULTS: Of all patients, 61 % had an impaired ID and 43 % had an impaired DIS. No significant correlations > 0. 4 were found between olfactory scores and other demographic or clinical variables. Age and sex accounted for the 22 % explained variance of the ID score regression model, whereas age, sex, and disease duration accounted for the 15 % explained variance of the DIS score regression model. Parkin and DJ- 1 mutation carriers (homozygous or heterozygous compound, n = 6) had normal ID scores. APOE epsilon 2 or APOE epsilon 4 carriers had no significantly different olfactory scores than noncarriers. The allele distribution of the alpha-synuclein (SNCA) -REP 1 polymorphism in groups with an impaired or normal ID or DIS was comparable. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Olfactory</b> <b>impairment</b> (OI) in Parkinson disease (PD) may be unrelated to other impairment domains of the disease, which may indicate that olfaction is an independent feature of PD. Parkin and DJ- 1 mutation carriers had normal identification scores {{but the number of}} mutation carriers is too small to draw conclusions. The APOE genotype (APOE epsilon 2 or APOE epsilon 4 alleles) and SNCA-REP 1 polymorphism do not seem to influence olfaction in PD...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. It is well {{established}} that people with schizophrenia have impaired olfactory perception. However, another olfactory abnormality that occurs in schizophreniaolfactory hallucinations (OHs) has received almost no attention. Methods. This preliminary study compared {{a small sample of}} olfactory (OH; n= 14) and auditory-verbal (AVH; n= 11) hallucinators with schizophrenia, with matched healthy controls (NC; n= 21), on tests of odour detection threshold, identification, and hedonics, and bespoke tests relating to possible causes of OHs. Results. Both OH and AVH participants were equally impaired on tests of odour identification, but neither had any impairment in detection. However, although the AVH group had hedonic impairments, these were not evident in the OH and NC groups. Examination of the possible causes of OHs revealed abnormalities in olfactory habituation. In addition, we observed a far greater rate of past episodes of brief unconsciousness in the OH group. Conclusions. The presence of habituation deficits and past episodes of brief unconsciousness, and absence of <b>olfactory</b> affective <b>impairment,</b> have not been identified before as correlates of OHs, suggesting these factors may be worthy of further investigation. 19 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Olfactory {{attention}} may {{be important}} in generating odor-induced tastes - an arguably universal form of synesthesia - by ensuring that the taste concurrent is captured by the nose and olfaction, not by the mouth and gustation (oral-capture). To examine the role of olfactory attention in generating odor-induced tastes and oral capture we tested a small sample (n= 4) of participants with likely <b>impairments</b> in <b>olfactory</b> attention - individuals with mediodorsal thalamic nucleus (MDNT) lesions. These participants were compared to two sets of controls on tests of olfactory attention, oral capture, odor and flavor perception, and control tasks. MDNT participants demonstrated impaired olfactory attention and enhanced oral capture. Greater oral capture was associated with greater <b>olfactory</b> attentional <b>impairment.</b> These findings imply that olfactory attention {{may be important}} in attributing odor-induced tastes to the olfactory modality. However, unlike for visual binding and for the neurodevelopmental synesthesias, where attention {{may be necessary to}} demonstrate both phenomena, olfactory attention deficits did not impair flavor binding or the experience of odor-induced tastes. 9 page(s...|$|R
40|$|The GAL 4 -based Gene-Switch {{system has}} been {{engineered}} to regulate transgene expression in Drosophila in both time and space. We constructed a Gene-Switch transgene in which Gene-Switch expression is restricted spatially by a defined mushroom body enhancer. This system allows Gene-Switch to be active only in the mushroom bodies and only on administration of the pharmacological Gene-Switch ligand RU 486. This line was used to drive {{the expression of a}} rutabaga cDNA in otherwise rutabaga mutant flies. Induction of the rutabaga cDNA in the mushroom bodies only during adulthood, or during adulthood along with the larval and pupal developmental stages, corrects the <b>olfactory</b> memory <b>impairment</b> found in rutabaga mutants. Induction of the cDNA only during the larval and pupal stages was inconsequential to performance in olfactory memory tasks. These data indicate that normal rutabaga function must be expressed in adulthood for normal memory and conclusively delimit the time and space expression requirements for correcting the rutabaga memory impairment. Such combined pharmacogenetic regulation of transgene expression now allows this time and space dissection to be made for other behavioral mutants...|$|R
