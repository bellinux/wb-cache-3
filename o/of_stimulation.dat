Stimulation has modest support for improving behaviour, mood, and, to a lesser extent, function.

5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of hypopituitarism is made on blood tests. Two types of blood tests {{are used to}} confirm {{the presence of a}} hormone deficiency: basal levels, where blood samples are taken–usually in the morning–without any form <b>of</b> <b>stimulation,</b> and dynamic tests, where blood tests are taken after the injection of a stimulating substance. Measurement of ACTH and growth hormone usually requires dynamic testing, whereas the other hormones (LH/FSH, prolactin, TSH) can typically be tested with basal levels. There is no adequate direct test for ADH levels, but ADH deficiency can be confirmed indirectly; oxytocin levels are not routinely measured.|$|E
5|$|There {{has long}} been debate about whether the qualities of mind, personality, and {{intelligence}} {{can be attributed to}} heredity or to upbringing—this is the nature and nurture controversy. Although many details remain to be settled, neuroscience research has clearly shown that both factors are important. Genes determine the general form of the brain, and genes determine how the brain reacts to experience. Experience, however, is required to refine the matrix of synaptic connections, which in its developed form contains far more information than the genome does. In some respects, all that matters is {{the presence or absence of}} experience during critical periods of development. In other respects, the quantity and quality of experience are important; for example, there is substantial evidence that animals raised in enriched environments have thicker cerebral cortices, indicating a higher density of synaptic connections, than animals whose levels <b>of</b> <b>stimulation</b> are restricted.|$|E

Financial <b>stimulation</b> <b>of</b> investment activity is carried out via the mechanism {{in the context of}} which these financial relations are settled. For defining the mechanism <b>of</b> financial <b>stimulation</b> <b>of</b> investment activity the authors consider the very concept of financial mechanism. The conclusion is drawn that all elements of the financial mechanism are the integrated unity, they are interdependent and interconnected, and the combination of types, forms, methods of the organization of the financial relations forms “a design of the financial mechanism”. The article specifies the maintenance of the mechanism <b>of</b> financial <b>stimulation</b> <b>of</b> investment activity, and reveals its essence. The structure of the mechanism <b>of</b> financial <b>stimulation</b> <b>of</b> investment activity is presented by the following elements: subjects <b>of</b> financial <b>stimulation</b> <b>of</b> investment activity, the purpose of attraction of investments by them, set of financial methods and tools, sources of means of achievement of goals, standard - legal and information support <b>of</b> financial <b>stimulation</b> <b>of</b> investment activity. It is proved that in the mechanism <b>of</b> financial <b>stimulation</b> <b>of</b> investment activity the leading role is played by the state by means of forms of direct and indirect participation in attraction of investments, each of which is realized by means of specific methods and the corresponding tools. The widespread instrument <b>of</b> financial <b>stimulation</b> <b>of</b> investment activity is the investments which are carried out by the state institutes of development participating in the organization of the process <b>of</b> financial <b>stimulation</b> <b>of</b> investment activity.

25|$|Nociceptors were {{discovered}} by Charles Scott Sherrington in 1906. In earlier centuries, scientists believed that animals were like mechanical devices that transformed {{the energy of}} sensory stimuli into motor responses. Sherrington used many different experiments to demonstrate that different types <b>of</b> <b>stimulation</b> to an afferent nerve fiber's receptive field led to different responses. Some intense stimuli trigger reflex withdrawal, certain autonomic responses, and pain. The specific receptors for these intense stimuli were called nociceptors.|$|E
25|$|Numerous {{experiments}} {{have demonstrated that}} electrical stimulation (ES) of the lumbosacral enlargement and dorsal root can induce locomotor EMG patterns and even hindlimb stepping in acute and chronic low-spinal animals and humans. Increased stimulation amplitude resulted in increased EMG amplitudes and an increased frequency of rhythmic activity. High frequencies <b>of</b> <b>stimulation</b> (>70Hz) produced tonic activity in the leg musculature, {{which suggests that the}} upper lumbar stimulation may activate neuronal structures that then recruit interneurons involved in CPG.|$|E
25|$|The PAG may be {{specifically}} {{involved in}} human maternal behavior.

The lateral orbitofrontal cortex is activated by pleasant visual, tactile, and olfactory stimuli. Its response depends on pleasantness rather than on intensity <b>of</b> <b>stimulation.</b> Here, its activity is likely to reflect one aspect of the pleasant emotions associated with motherly love.|$|E

Electric stimulation utilizing implants deliver specific voltages to a specific part of the brain for specific durations.

25|$|This {{represents}} one of the earliest theories on the subject of referred pain. It is {{based on the work of}} W.A. Sturge and J. Ross from 1888 and later TC Ruch in 1961. Convergent projection proposes that afferent nerve fibers from tissues converge onto the same spinal neuron, and explains why referred pain is believed to be segmented in much the same way as the spinal cord. Additionally, experimental evidence shows that when local pain (pain at the site <b>of</b> <b>stimulation)</b> is intensified the referred pain is intensified as well.|$|E
25|$|Fatigue is {{generally}} considered a more long-term condition than sleepiness (somnolence).

It manifests in mental or physical weariness and inability to complete tasks at normal performance. Both are often used interchangeably and even categorized under the description of 'being tired.'
