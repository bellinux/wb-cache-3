40|$|Intradiscal {{pressure}} (IDP) is {{an essential}} biomechanical parameter and {{has been the subject}} of numerous in vivo and in vitro investigations. Although currently available sensors differ in size and measurement principles, no data exist regarding inter-sensor reliability in measuring IDP. Moreover, although discs of various species vary significantly in size and mechanics, the possible effects of sensor insertion on the IDP have never been investigated. The present in vitro study aimed to address these issues. The synchronized signals of two differently sized pressure transducers (Ø 1. 33 and <b>Ø</b> <b>0.</b> 36 mm) <b>obtained</b> during the measurements in two species (bovine and caprine) and their influence on the measured pressure were compared. First, the discs were subjected to three loading periods, and the pressure was measured simultaneously to assess the inter-sensor reliability. In the second test, the effect of the sensor size was evaluated by alternatingly inserting one transducer into the disc while recording the resulting pressure change with the second transducer. Although both sensors yielded similar pressure values (ICC: consistency: 0. 964 - 0. 999; absolute agreement: 0. 845 - 0. 996) when used simultaneously, the sensor size was determined to influence the measured pressure during the insertion tests. The magnitude of the effect differed between species; it was insignificant in the bovine specimens but significant in the caprine specimens, with a pressure increase of 0. 31 - 0. 64 MPa (median: <b>0.</b> 43 MPa) <b>obtained</b> when the larger sensor was inserted.

The results of PBD revealed that the crucial ingredients related to the production of NW-G 01 were (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 , peptone and CaCO 3 . A prediction model has been built in the experiments of central composite design and response surface methodology, and its validation has been further verified. The optimal medium composition was determined (g/L) : corn starch 15, glucose 15, peptone 3. 80, (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 0. 06, NaCl 1. 5, CaCO 3 1. 30, MgSO 4 · 7 H 2 <b>O</b> <b>0.</b> 015, K 2 HPO 4 · 3 H 2 <b>O</b> <b>0.</b> 015, MnCl 2 · 4 H 2 <b>O</b> <b>0.</b> 015, FeSO 4 · 7 H 2 <b>O</b> <b>0.</b> 015, and ZnSO 4 · 7 H 2 <b>O</b> <b>0.</b> 015. Compared with NW-G 01 production (5. 707 mg/L) in non-optimized fermentation medium, the production of NW-G 01 (15. 564 mg/L) in optimized fermentation medium had a 2. 73 -fold increase...|$|R
40|$|A chromatic-index-critical graph G on n {{vertices}} is non-trivial {{if it has}} at most n 2 c edges. We {{prove that}} there is no chromatic-index-critical graph of order 12, and that there are precisely two non-trivial chromatic index critical graphs on 11 vertices. Together with known results this implies that there are precisely three non-trivial chromaticindex -critical graphs of order 12. 1 Introduction A famous theorem of Vizing [20] states that the chromatic index <b>Ø</b> <b>0</b> (G) of a simple graph G is Δ(G) or Δ(G) + 1, where Δ(G) denotes the maximum vertex degree in G. A graph G is class 1 if <b>Ø</b> <b>0</b> (G) = Δ(G) and it is class 2 otherwise. A class 2 graph G is (chromatic index) critical if <b>Ø</b> <b>0</b> (G Γ e) ! <b>Ø</b> <b>0</b> (G) for each edge e of G. If we want to stress the maximum vertex degree of a critical graph G we say G is Δ(G) -critical. Critical graphs of odd order are easy to construct while not much is known about critical graphs of even order. One reas [...] ...|$|R

Decays into ` <b>Ø</b> <b>0</b> 1, c <b>Ø</b> <b>0</b> 1 and b <b>Ø</b> <b>0</b> 1 have been considered for sleptons, stop and sbottom, respectively. In a total sample of about 20 pb Γ 1 the number of candidate events with acoplanar lepton or jet pairs was found to be in agreement with expectations from standard model processes. These results are interpreted in terms of exclusion regions in the (M f,M <b>Ø</b> <b>0</b> 1) planes. Paper submitted to the HEP' 97 Conference Jerusalem, August 19 - 26 1 Introduction During the 1996 data taking period the LEP accelerator was operating {{for the first time at}} centre-of-mass energies above the WW production threshold. This increase in energy allowed to extend the searches for scalar partners of leptons (sleptons) and quarks (squarks), which are predicted by supersymm [...] ...|$|R

The results suggest that all three glasses have structures based on chains of Q 2 phosphate groups. Clear structural differences are observed between the glasses containing Na 2 O and CaO. The P–O bonds to bridging and non-bridging oxygens are less well resolved in the neutron data from the samples containing CaO, suggesting {{a change in the}} nature of the bonding as the field strength of the cation increases Na+ → Ca 2 +.
