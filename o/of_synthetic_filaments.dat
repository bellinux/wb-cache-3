40|$|Adenylate deaminase (AMP deaminase; AMP aminohydrolase, EC 3. 5. 4. 6), a tetrameric enzyme {{found at}} {{particularly}} high concentrations in skeletal muscle, {{has previously been}} shown to bind strongly to the subfragment- 2 -portion of myosin in vitro and {{to the ends of}} the A band in vivo. It is shown here that when adenylate deaminase is dialyzed with skeletal myosin during formation <b>of</b> <b>synthetic</b> <b>filaments</b> at pH 7. 0 it decorates the filament at 14. 3 -nm intervals, presumably in the region of exposed backbone between crossbridge levels. Optical diffraction of the aggregates reveals both enhancement of reflections arising from underlying myosin organization and other reflections arising from adenylate deaminase arrangement on the filament surface. Adenylate deaminase can thus be used as a specific label in the study of myosin presence and organization...|$|E
40|$|X-ray {{results are}} {{presented}} concerning the structural state of myosin heads <b>of</b> <b>synthetic</b> <b>filaments</b> in threads. These were made from purified rabbit skeletal muscle myosin and studied by x-ray diffraction and electron microscopy by Cooke et al. (Cooke, P. H., E. M. Bartels, G. F. Elliott, and R. A. Hughes, 1987, Biophys. J., 51 : 947 - 957). X-ray patterns show a meridional peak at a spacing of 14. 4 nm. We concentrate here on the only other feature of the axial pattern: this is a central region of diffuse scatter, which we find {{to be similar to}} that obtained from myosin heads in solution (Mendelson, R. A., K. M. Kretzschmar, 1980, Biochemistry, 19 : 4103 - 4108). This means that the myosin heads have very large random displacements in all directions from their average positions, and that they are practically randomly oriented. The myosin heads do not contribute to the 14. 4 -nm peak, which must come entirely from the backbone. Comparison with x-ray data from the unstriated Taenia coli muscle of the guinea pig indicates that in this muscle at least 75 % of the diffuse scatter comes from disordered myosin heads. The results confirm that the diffuse scatter in x-ray patterns from specimens that contain myosin filaments can yield information about the structural behavior of the myosin heads...|$|E
40|$|Tropomyosin (Tm) spans seven actin {{monomers}} {{and contains}} seven quasi-repeating, loosely similar regions, 1 – 7. Deletion of regions 2 – 3 decreases the in vitro sliding speed <b>of</b> <b>synthetic</b> <b>filaments</b> of actin-Tm-Troponin (Tn), and weakens Tm binding to the actin-myosin subfragment 1 (S 1) complex (acto-S 1). The thin filament was selectively removed from bovine myocardium by gelsolin, and the actin filament was reconstituted, followed by further reconstitution with Tm and Tn. In this reconstitution, full-length Tm (control) was compared with Tm internal deletion mutant Δ 23 Tm, which lacks residues 47 – 123 (regions 2 – 3). The effects of phosphate, MgATP, MgADP and Ca 2 + were studied in Tm-reconstituted myocardium and Δ 23 Tm-reconstituted myocardium at pH 7. 00 and 25 °C. In Δ 23 Tm, both isometric tension and stiffness were about 40 % of the control. The Hill factor with Δ 23 Tm, deduced from the pCa-tension plot, was 1. 4 {{times that of}} the control, but the Ca 2 + sensitivity was the same. Sinusoidal analysis indicated that the cross-bridge number in force-generating states was not decreased with Δ 23 Tm. We conclude that the thin filament cooperativity is increased with Δ 23 Tm, presumably because of the increased density of the Ca 2 +-binding sites. We further conclude that tension per cross-bridge is 40 % of control and stiffness per cross-bridge is 40 % of control in Δ 23 Tm. These results are consistent with the idea that Tm modifies the actin-myosin interface so as to increase the stereospecific interaction between moieties of actin and myosin. In Δ 23 Tm, the interface may not have a perfect stereospecific match so that the tension- and stiffness-generating capacity is greatly diminished...|$|E

40|$|In {{the absence}} <b>of</b> C-protein, <b>synthetic</b> <b>filaments</b> {{prepared}} from column-purified myosin exhibit the following features: individual filament diameters are uniform {{over a long}} length, but a wide distribution of diameters is apparent over the population; approximately 25 % of the filaments have a frayed appearance and take up stain poorly, whereas the remaining 75 % are well-stained; optical diffraction of well-stained filaments reveals a 14. 3 -nm subunit period and a 43 -nm axial period (Koretz, 1978; Koretz, 1979). Addition of C-protein to myosin before filament formation affects all of these features in a manner related to C-protein concentration. At the physiological ratio of C-protein to myosin in the banded region of the natural thick <b>filament,</b> <b>synthetic</b> aggregates are uniform in diameter over the population and show less than 10 % frays.

Addition of C-protein after filament formation appears to coat the aggregates so that elements of backbone ultrastructure are obscured, and some evidence of axial period change is visible in diffraction patterns.

40|$|A {{mechanism}} for length regulation in the parallel-packed {{section of the}} thick filament is proposed. It is based on experiments done on synthetic, mini- and native filaments, and its primary purpose is to explain the physical basis of the kinetic {{mechanism for}} the assembly <b>of</b> <b>synthetic</b> thick <b>filaments</b> from myosin alone. Kinetically, length is regulated by a dissociation rate constant that increases exponentially as the filament grows bi-directionally from its center. Growth ceases {{at the point of}} equilibrium between invariant on and length-dependent off rates. The three subfilaments structure of the parallel-packed region of the thick filament is fundamental to the proposed scheme. The intra-subfilament bonding is strong and predominantly ionic in character, whereas the inter-subfilament bonding is relatively weak. These strong and weak interactions participate directly in the strictly sequential mechanism of assembly of dimer subunit observed in the kinetics. A third domain, independent of the sequential mechanism, consists of opposing negative charges on the subfilament surface, juxtaposed at or close to the thick filament axis. The weak and repulsive domains are additively coupled to each other through the rigidity in the subfilaments. Length regulation occurs through the repulsive component rising in intensity more rapidly with length than the initially stronger positive interactions. Growth ceases {{at the point where the}} repulsive interactions weaken the attractive interactions to the extent that equilibrium is established between head-to-tail dimer subunit and its binding sites at the tips of the arms of thick filament.

A crude desmin-containing fraction was prepared by modification of procedures used for isolation of smooth-muscle intermediate-filament protein [Small & Sobieszek (1977) J. Cell Sci. 23, 243 - 268]. The desmin was extracted in 1 M-acetic acid/ 20 mM-NaCl at 4 degrees C for 15 h from the residue remaining after actomyosin extraction from washed myofibrils. Successive chromatography on hydroxyapatite and DEAE-Sepharose CL- 6 B in 6 M-urea yielded desmin that was routinely more than 97 % 55 000 -dalton protein and that had no detectable actin contamination. Removal of urea by dialysis against 10 mM-Tris/acetate (pH 8. 5) / 1 mM dithioerythritol and subsequent clarification at 134 000 g (rav. 5. 9 cm) for 1 h results in a clear desmin solution.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the historical roots <b>of</b> <b>synthetic</b> biology, highlighting the multiple meanings and understandings <b>of</b> the term. <b>Synthetic</b> biology as it is used today refers to an especially wide range of endeavors, embodying an equally wide range of aims, and having correspondingly vari-ous relations to the activities generally included in the discipline of biology. To address the question <b>of</b> what <b>synthetic</b> biology {{has to do with}} biology, this article illustrates some {{of the ways in which}} the entanglement <b>of</b> <b>synthetic</b> biology as the epitome <b>of</b> technoscience and <b>synthetic</b> biology as an alternative, artificial biology plays out in three different examples <b>of</b> <b>synthetic</b> biology—one current and two historical...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well-known}} that focusing striates a sequent derivation into phases of like polarity where each phase {{can be seen}} as inferring a synthetic connective. The calculus <b>of</b> <b>synthetic</b> connectives can be given a uniform presentation by means of neutral proof patterns, with dual polarised interpretations. Permutations <b>of</b> <b>synthetic</b> inferences can be explained by local conditions on proof patterns. Particular focusing systems can be explained as strategic uses <b>of</b> <b>synthetic</b> inferences...|$|R
