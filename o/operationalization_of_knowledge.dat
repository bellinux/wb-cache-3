40|$|The {{research}} interests {{of information systems}} (IS) researchers often lead to a tension between theory development {{on the one hand}} and practical application, such as the implementation of computer applications or business processes, on the other. This tension is, for example, made manifest in the various action research approaches typically used in IS research. This paper presents an approach to IS research that aims to maintain a link between the abstract and the concrete in order to construct ‘tangible theory’. The approach is based on a perspective referred to as socio-instrumental pragmatism and on the concept <b>of</b> grounding <b>knowledge</b> in three different ways: internal grounding, external theoretical grounding, and empirical grounding. Specifically, the suggested approach puts forward the idea <b>of</b> <b>operationalization</b> <b>of</b> abstract <b>knowledge</b> into concrete forms that are more directly applicable in practice...|$|R
30|$|Modeling content {{knowledge}} in the commercial sector was based on case-situations and learning-fields (Rosendahl and Straka 2011), or based on subject discipline (Seeber 2008). By contrast, in the industrial-technical field, modeling {{content knowledge}} {{on the basis of}} different technical areas is common. These content areas are influenced by prioritization of the curriculum contents. Strong indications of these curriculum-based learning processes are mentioned by Gschwendtner (2011) and Schmidt et al. (2014). There are inconsistent references to modeling content knowledge based on cognitive psychology criteria (declarative and procedural). In the commercial sector, and in the general didactics of technology, declarative and procedural knowledge is empirically separable (Winther 2010; Walker 2013); however, it is not in the industrial-technical field (Geißel 2008; Gschwendtner 2008). This might be due to the <b>operationalization</b> <b>of</b> content <b>knowledge</b> which, in the professional context, always includes declarative knowledge components. The assessment of declarative and procedural knowledge using paper-pencil-tests probably promotes a common scaling of declarative and procedural knowledge.|$|R
30|$|For {{the design}} <b>of</b> PROKLAS, {{professional}} <b>knowledge</b> {{was classified as}} declarative knowledge and procedural knowledge. While the former included items requiring facts, definitions and information, the procedural knowledge was tested by items asking for {{a deeper understanding of}} handling procedures. Both categories <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> have been reported as having very closely associated dimensions (Nickolaus and Seeber 2013). This might be due to the <b>operationalization</b> <b>of</b> procedural <b>knowledge</b> which in the professional context always requires declarative knowledge components (Nickolaus et al. 2012). Novices in training still form first a declarative base when developing procedural knowledge (McPherson SL and Thomas 1989). Due to the smooth transition between declarative and procedural knowledge, we cannot clearly distinguish between both categories of cognition. To be able to do so, we would need to compare VET students’ scores in PROKLAS with observation of these VET students in action-oriented tests for laboratory tasks. In this case, each dimension of laboratory tasks would be needed to be observed and then compared to the scores obtained in PROKLAS. This is currently outside the scope of this project. To compare VET students’ score in PROKLAS we would also apply a simulation test with video vignettes (cf. Seeber 2014) or computer-assisted simulations (cf. Achtenhagen and Winther 2014), which has not been developed yet.|$|R
40|$|Although most authors on Information Literacy do {{not really}} differ in their {{definitions}} of the information literacy concept, phenomenographic research makes clear that {{in the context of}} education at least two different conceptions can be distinguished: an “Information Problem Solving” conception and a “Personal Knowledge Base” conception [1]. The conception of “Information Problem Solving” has been elaborated on in various models by many researchers but the <b>operationalization</b> <b>of</b> the “Personal <b>Knowledge</b> Base conception” has, until now, been ignored in LIS research. Based on educational literature a model for the content <b>of</b> a “Personal <b>Knowledge</b> Base” will be proposed. Two kinds <b>of</b> internalized <b>knowledge</b> are distinguished: the body <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> the discipline and metacognitive <b>knowledge.</b> Both <b>of</b> these elements display sub content. This conception of information literacy as a “Personal Knowledge Base” is consistent with the idea that “learning to learn” {{is one of the main}} goals of Higher Education.

40|$|Successful {{innovation}} depends to a {{high degree}} on an organization’s ability to develop an effective Research & Development (R&D) process and during the last decades many companies have adopted Stage-Gate® or similar methodologies. Although such methodologies are credited with significantly improving R&D results at many companies, there is still potential for improvement, if organizations can learn from projects. Each and every R&D project should not only result in a successful new product but also generate learning for the organization, because this has a high importance for the competitive advantage of an organization. Post-project reviews (PPRs) are recognized by both practitioners and academics as an appropriate mechanism to stimulate project-to-project learning in R&D project teams. However, PPRs are used by relatively few companies, {{and those that do}} utilize them often fail to do so adequately. Surprisingly, although PPRs are widely perceived to be a useful tool, empirical research on how they can best be used and how they support learning within a project team is very limited. This thesis addresses this gap in the extant knowledge and describes five in-depth exploratory case studies, which investigated how PPRs are conducted, how they are perceived by R&D managers and the project-to-project learning that can result from PPRs. Based on a complex research design which combines qualitative and quantitative data from documents, interviews and the observation of PPR meetings, the results show that current PPR practices vary much across different organizations. Furthermore, R&D managers perceive PPRs as important for learning in R&D project teams but difficult to manage effectively. An important result was also that tacit knowledge and experiences play an important role when analysing project-to-project learning. Although the <b>operationalization</b> <b>of</b> tacit <b>knowledge</b> is difficult, the detailed analysis of lessons learnt and metaphors used allowed to gather conclusions on the supporting role of PPRs for the creation and transfer of both explicit and tacit knowledge...|$|R
30|$|To {{determine}} {{exactly how}} prior economic knowledge differs among beginning students, a measurement instrument needs to include items that accurately assess general <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> economics at a basic level and items that assess more specific <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> economics at an in-depth level (Dochy et al. 1999; Hailikari 2009; Yousfi and Böhme 2012). In this study, {{for the first}} time, items from two measurement instruments—the German adaptation of the fourth version of the American test of economic literacy (TEL 4 -G, see Happ et al. 2016 a; for the original American version, see Walstad et al. 2013) and the German adaptation of the fourth version of the American test of understanding college economics (TUCE 4 -G, see Zlatkin-Troitschanskaia et al. 2016; for the original American version, see Walstad and Rebeck 2008)—are {{used to assess the}} <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> economics of beginning university students enrolled in business and economics programs at two universities in Germany. Combining items from these two instruments allows <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> the main content areas of economics (i.e., basics of economics, microeconomics, and macroeconomics; for a nationwide curricular analysis of the content areas, see Zlatkin-Troitschanskaia et al. 2016) and knowledge at various levels to be assessed separately. As a result, the effects of the three learning opportunities (vocational training and/or a course in economics as a major subject at secondary school and/or attendance of an upper secondary school specializing in economics) can be analyzed according to content area. First, the theoretical basis of this study is explained (“Theoretical basis and hypotheses” section). Second, the selection and setup of two test instruments used in the <b>operationalization</b> <b>of</b> economic <b>knowledge</b> and the sample are described (“Test instrument and sample” section). Third, through the calculation of t tests and multiple linear regression models, the impact of having completed vocational training and/or a course in economics as a major subject at secondary school and/or attendance of an upper secondary school specializing in economics on economic knowledge prior to beginning higher education studies in economics is assessed (“Results” section). Lastly, the findings and limitations of the study are discussed and conclusions for further research are provided (“Discussion” and “Conclusions” sections).|$|R

This study advances the <b>operationalization</b> <b>of</b> social capital by (1) employing an existing dataset – the Social Capital Benchmark Survey (SCBS) – to empirically probe the “dimensionality ” {{of social capital}} for American sub-national regions, and (2) explicating this dimensional structure by examining the relationship of multi-dimensional social capital with regional economic growth. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses reveal SCBS’s multi-dimensional structure, consistent with Putnam’s (2000) dimensions of “bridging ” and “bonding. ” Regression of regional growth on these dimensions supports the validity of these dimensions. With respect to indices of regional growth, bridging social capital yields positive relationships while bonding social capital produces negative relationships.
