5|$|Because of Copenhagen's {{northern}} latitude, {{the number}} <b>of</b> <b>daylight</b> hours varies considerably between summer and winter. On the summer solstice, {{the sun rises}} at 04:26 and sets at 21:58, providing 17 hours 32 minutes <b>of</b> <b>daylight.</b> On the winter solstice, it rises at 08:37 and sets at 15:39 with 7 hours and 1 minute <b>of</b> <b>daylight.</b> There is therefore a difference of 10 hours and 31 minutes in the length of days and nights between the summer and winter solstices.|$|E

5|$|The period <b>of</b> <b>Daylight</b> Saving Time {{before the}} longest day is {{shorter than the}} period after, in several {{countries}} including the United States and Europe.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In Portugal, {{daylighting}} {{solutions in}} Museums have been frequently put aside {{on behalf of}} all-artificial lighting solutions, simpler to apply. However, being <b>daylight</b> one <b>of</b> the key factors in environmental comfort for users in public spaces, such as in museums, the architect’s role is fundamental to select and implement effective and integrated daylighting systems. The knowledge <b>of</b> <b>daylighting</b> properties in winter and summer, specifically in the Lisbon area, is {{the starting point for}} the application <b>of</b> <b>daylighting</b> solutions that, on the one hand, illuminate the museum spaces effectively, without damaging museum objects, and on the other hand, avoid discomfort situations. This paper presents a summary of a field study carried out in a sample of 20 museums representative of museological spaces in the Lisbon area, focusing on evaluating the advantages <b>of</b> <b>daylighting</b> applications in Museums, in order to establish a set <b>of</b> <b>daylighting</b> design strategies for those spaces...|$|R

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{controversial}} measures Daniels successfully pushed through was the state adoption <b>of</b> <b>Daylight</b> Saving Time, which Daniels argued would save the state money on energy costs. Although the state is in the Eastern Time Zone, Indiana's counties had adopted their own time zone practices, and in practice the state effectively observed two different times, and {{the central part of the}} state maintained a single time—Eastern Standard—year round. Interests for both EST and CST time zones had prevented the official adoption <b>of</b> <b>daylight</b> saving since the 1930s, and had led to decades of debate. Daniels pressed for the entire state to switch to Central Time, but the General Assembly could not come to terms. Ultimately after a long debate, they adopted Eastern Daylight Saving Time in April 2005, the measure passing by one vote, putting all but northwestern and southwestern Indiana on the same time for the first time.|$|E

5|$|In 1992, after {{a three-year}} trial <b>of</b> <b>daylight</b> saving in Queensland, Australia, a {{referendum}} on daylight saving was held and defeated with a 54.5% 'no' vote– with regional and rural areas strongly opposed, while those in the metropolitan south-east were in favor. In 2005, the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association and the National Association of Convenience Stores successfully lobbied for the 2007 extension to U.S. DST. In December 2008, the Daylight Saving for South East Queensland (DS4SEQ) political party was officially registered in Queensland, advocating {{the implementation of a}} dual-time zone arrangement for daylight saving in South East Queensland {{while the rest of the}} state maintains standard time. DS4SEQ contested the March 2009 Queensland state election with 32 candidates and received one percent of the statewide primary vote, equating to around 2.5% across the 32 electorates contested. After a three-year trial, more than 55% of Western Australians voted against DST in 2009, with rural areas strongly opposed. On April 14, 2010, after being approached by the DS4SEQ political party, Queensland Independent member Peter Wellington, introduced the Daylight Saving for South East Queensland Referendum Bill 2010 into the Queensland parliament, calling for a referendum at the next state election on the introduction <b>of</b> <b>daylight</b> saving into South East Queensland under a dual-time zone arrangement.

40|$|Daylighting is a {{beneficial}} design strategy since it may provide energy savings {{and contribute to}} a more sustainable design. In recent studies, daylighting {{has also been shown}} to increase staff and student productivity and to decrease absenteeism. The consulting engineer is often faced with the dilemma of how to design a daylighted building. What tools are available to predict the amount <b>of</b> <b>daylighting?</b> What are the design limitations and parameters? How much time is required? How does the data compare to the ?real world?? The {{purpose of this paper is}} to answer these questions and provide useful information for the design <b>of</b> <b>daylighted</b> areas with the assistance of software-based simulation. A survey was made of the available software programs for the calibrated modeling of light scattered in enclosed spaces. These software packages used algorithms based on either total radiosity (flux transfer) computations or physically accurate ray tracing. A summary of this survey along with the selection criteria used in selecting a software program are presented. ?Radiance?, a reverse ray tracing method software package, was chosen for use in the simulations. An existing school was modeled with the Radiance software and predictions <b>of</b> <b>daylighting</b> contributions were compared with actual data taken at the site location. The use <b>of</b> <b>daylighting</b> also requires a highly specialized lighting system. This system incorporates the use of controllable ballasts and lighting sensors to maximize the daylighting contribution to the overall required illumination. Some design criteria for this system is also discussed...|$|R

5|$|Many {{bird species}} migrate to take {{advantage}} of global differences of seasonal temperatures, therefore optimising availability of food sources and breeding habitat. These migrations vary among the different groups. Many landbirds, shorebirds, and waterbirds undertake annual long distance migrations, usually triggered by the length <b>of</b> <b>daylight</b> as well as weather conditions. These birds are characterised by a breeding season spent in the temperate or polar regions and a non-breeding season in the tropical regions or opposite hemisphere. Before migration, birds substantially increase body fats and reserves and reduce the size of some of their organs.|$|E
