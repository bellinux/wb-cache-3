5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s the {{prevailing}} {{view was that}} the genes in a chromosome acted like discrete entities, indivisible by recombination and arranged like beads <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>string.</b> The experiments of Benzer using mutants defective in the rII region of bacteriophage T4 (1955-1959) showed that individual genes have a simple linear structure {{and are likely to}} be equivalent to a linear section of DNA.|$|E

Transverse mechanical waves (e.g., a wave <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>string)</b> have an amplitude expressed as a distance (e.g., meters), longitudinal mechanical waves (e.g., sound waves) use units of pressure (e.g., pascals), and electromagnetic waves (a form of transverse vacuum wave) express the amplitude in terms of its electric field (e.g., volts/meter).|$|E

25|$|A {{method of}} {{preserving}} numeric information in clay {{was invented by}} the Sumerians between 8000 and 3500BC. This was done with small clay tokens of various shapes that were strung like beads <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>string.</b> Beginning about 3500BC, clay tokens were gradually replaced by number signs impressed with a round stylus at different angles in clay tablets (originally containers for tokens) which were then baked. About 3100BC, written numbers were dissociated from the things being counted and became abstract numerals.|$|E

25|$|Moravian folk {{bands are}} mainly {{centered}} <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>string</b> section {{and a large}} cimbalom, which are often complemented by other instruments. Moravian traditional music influenced Czech classical composers, such as Antonín Dvořák, Bedřich Smetana and Leoš Janáček, {{who was at the}} forefront of the Moravian folklore movement. Towards the end of the 20th century, Moravian folk music had a noticeable influence on the Czech jazz scene, and folk songs have been adapted into rock bands' repretoires. Today, there are many festivals still held throughout Moravia with performances from traditional bands and dance ensembles.|$|E

25|$|Seals {{were used}} in the {{earliest}} civilizations and are of considerable importance in archaeology and art history. In ancient Mesopotamia carved or engraved cylinder seals in stone or other materials were used. These could be rolled along to create an impression on clay (which could be repeated indefinitely), and used as labels on consignments of trade goods, or for other purposes. They are normally hollow and it is presumed that they were worn <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>string</b> or chain round the neck. Many have only images, often very finely carved, with no writing, while others have both. From ancient Egypt seals in the form of signet-rings (see below), including some with the names of kings, have been found; these tend to show only names in hieroglyphics.|$|E
25|$|The ancient Israelites built {{terraces}} of leveled {{areas in}} the hill country for planting a variety of crops, including grains, vegetables and fruit trees. All the trees, {{with the exception of}} the olive, produced fruit that could be eaten fresh or be made into fresh juice while in season. Fruit was also processed for later use in a variety of ways: Fruit with high sugar content was fermented to make alcoholic beverages; grapes were most commonly used for this. Fruit was also boiled down into thick, sweet syrup, referred to in the Bible as dvash (honey). Grapes, figs, dates and apricots were also dried and preserved individually or put <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>string</b> or pressed into cakes. Since dried fruit are an efficient source of energy, they were prepared as provisions for journeys and long marches.|$|E
