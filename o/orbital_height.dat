50|$|The {{first attempt}} at {{rendezvous}} was made on June 3, 1965, when US astronaut Jim McDivitt tried to maneuver his Gemini 4 craft to meet its spent Titan II launch vehicle's upper stage. McDivitt was unable to {{get close enough to}} achieve station-keeping, due to depth-perception problems, and stage propellant venting which kept moving it around.However, the Gemini 4 attempts at rendezvous were unsuccessful largely because NASA engineers had yet to learn the orbital mechanics involved in the process. Simply pointing the active vehicle's nose at the target and thrusting was unsuccessful. If the target is ahead in the orbit and the tracking vehicle increases speed, its altitude also increases, actually moving it away from the target. The higher altitude then increases orbital period due to Kepler's third law, putting the tracker not only above, but also behind the target. The proper technique requires changing the tracking vehicle's orbit to allow the rendezvous target to either catch up or be caught up with, and then at the correct moment changing to the same orbit as the target with no relative motion between the vehicles (for example, putting the tracker into a lower orbit, which has a shorter orbital period allowing it to catch up, then executing a Hohmann transfer back to the original <b>orbital</b> <b>height).</b>|$|E

40|$|Substantial {{altimetry}} datasets {{collected by}} different satellites have only become available {{during the past}} five years, but the future will bring a variety of new altimetry missions, both parallel and consecutive in time. The characteristics of each produced dataset vary with the different <b>orbital</b> <b>heights</b> and inclinations of the spacecraft, {{as well as with the}} technical properties of the radar instrument. An integral analysis of datasets with different properties offers advantages both in terms of data quantity and data quality. This thesis is concerned with the development of the means for such integral analysis, in particular for dynamic solutions in which precise orbits for the satellites are computed simultaneously. The first half of the thesis discusses the theory and numerical implementation of dynamic multi-satellite altimetry analysis. The most important aspect of this analysis is the application of dual satellite altimetry crossover points as a bi-directional tracking data type in simultaneous orbit solutions. The central problem is that the spatial and temporal distributions of the crossovers are in conflict with the time-organised nature of traditional solution methods. Their application to the adjustment of the orbits of both satellites involved in a dual crossover therefore requires several fundamental changes of the classical least-squares prediction/correction methods. The second part of the thesis applies the developed numerical techniques to the problems of precise orbit computation and gravity field adjustment, using the altimetry datasets of ERS- 1 and TOPEX/Poseidon. Although the two datasets can be considered less compatible that those of planned future satellite missions, the obtained results adequately illustrate the merits of a simultaneous solution technique. In particular, the geographically correlated orbit error is partially observable from a dataset consisting of crossover differences between two sufficiently different altimetry datasets, while being unobservable from the analysis of altimetry data of both satellites individually. This error signal, which has a substantial gravity-induced component, can be employed advantageously in simultaneous solutions for the two satellites in which also the harmonic coefficients of the gravity field model are estimated...|$|R

40|$|In situ {{atmospheric}} measurements at low <b>orbital</b> <b>heights</b> {{are necessary}} to build accurate atmospheric models and in particular {{to contribute to the}} development of a global, real time, space weather forecasting service, following the high variability of the atmospheric environment and allowing accurate predictions of LEO object trajectories and maneuvers planning. Missions for real-time in situ atmospheric measurements have been recently proposed, based on nanosatellite swarms. The main limitation in these missions is the effect of atmospheric drag, which dissipates the orbital energy making the nanosatellite re-enter and burn quickly in the Earth atmosphere. Therefore, the operative orbit height must be sufficiently high to guarantee a meaningful orbital lifetime, justifying the launch and sophisticated instrumentation costs. Using a propulsion system, the useful satellite lifetime could be extended and at the same time the operative orbit height could be lowered, to explore more interesting zones. However, conventional propulsion systems, namely chemical and electric propulsion systems, are not compatible with the on board resources constraints imposed by nanosatellites, in terms of mass and power. Innovative propulsion techniques enabling atmospheric measurement missions at low altitudes should be investigated. Among these, laser propulsion offers great weight and power potential savings, obtained separating the propulsion system energy source from the satellite. The energy source for the propulsion system is a laser beam generated remotely, while only a collecting mirrors and ablative material are necessary on the target spacecraft. The mission proposed in this paper is based on the idea that the source of the propulsion energy necessary for the whole nanosatellite swarm can be concentrated in one or more large satellites orbiting at higher altitudes, where the atmospheric drag can be easily compensated. Energy is transferred to the low orbit target nanosatellites by a laser beam, that impinges on the nanosatellite's surfaces, vaporizes a cover slide of ablating material, giving net thrust to the target nanosatellite. The mission is designed taking into account long term orbital perturbations on the target nanosatellite swarm and on the laser source spacecraft. The laser sustained re-orbiting maneuver sequence is optimized, depending on the relative orbital geometry, showing that the laser propulsion system is an enabling technology for low altitude nanosatellite aeronomy missions.
