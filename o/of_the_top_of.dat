5|$|Other {{studies suggest}} that rivaling Carnotaurus did not deliver rapid head blows, but pushed slowly against each other with the upper sides of their skulls. Thus, the horns {{may have been a}} device for the {{distribution}} of compression forces without damage to the brain. This is supported by the flattened upper sides of the horns, the strongly fused bones <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the skull, and the inability of the skull to survive rapid head blows.|$|E
5|$|Benfica {{started the}} {{domestic}} season by winning their fourth Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira, beating Vitória de Setúbal one-nil. In the Primeira Liga, Benfica struggled initially, making their worst entry ever. Results improved following a European win against Lille, with Benfica climbing several places and defeating Porto in the Clássico. In late October, the team experienced {{a drop in}} form, going a month without a win. In December, Benfica's results improved in December, qualifying for the knockout stages of the UEFA Champions League {{for the first time}} in eleven years and winning nearly ten matches in a row, allowing them to get within three points <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the league.|$|E
5|$|Much of the Leslie's unique tone {{is due to}} {{the fact}} that the system is at least {{partially}} enclosed, whereby linear louvres along the sides and front of the unit can vent the sound from within the box after the sound has bounced around inside, mellowing it. The crossover is deliberately set to 800Hz to give the optimum balance between the horn and the drum, and is considered an integral part of the speaker. The tone is also affected by the wood used. Tone differences, due to cost cutting using particle board for speaker and rotor shelves instead of the previous plywood, are evident in the Leslie's sound. The thinner ply <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the cabinet adds a certain resonance as well. Like an acoustic instrument, a Leslie's tone is uniquely defined by its cabinet design and construction, the amplifier, crossover and speakers used, and the motors — not merely by the spinning of rotors.|$|E

5|$|The broad head is {{distinct}} from the neck, and the snout is blunt in profile with the rim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the head extending forwards slightly further than the mouth. Substantial cranial plates are present, although the parietal plates are often fragmented, especially towards the rear. A loreal scale is absent. Six to 9 supralabials and eight to 12 infralabials are seen. At midbody, there are 23–27 rows of dorsal scales. All dorsal scale rows have keels, although those on the lowermost scale rows are weak. In males/females, the ventral scales number 130-145/128-144 and the subcaudals 38-54/36-50. Many of the latter may be divided.|$|E
5|$|The {{liquid water}} density within a cumulus cloud {{has been found}} to change with height above the cloud base rather than being {{approximately}} constant throughout the cloud. At the cloud base, the concentration was 0grams of liquid water per kilogram of air. As altitude increased, the concentration rapidly increased to the maximum concentration near the middle of the cloud. The maximum concentration was found to be anything up to 1.25grams of water per kilogram of air. The concentration slowly dropped off as altitude increased to the height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the cloud, where it immediately dropped to zero again.|$|E
5|$|The scales {{along the}} lips of the snake are called labials. Those on the upper lip are called supralabials or upper labials, while those on the lower lip are called infralabials or lower labials. On top of the head, between the eyes, {{adjacent}} to the supraoculars is the frontal scale. The prefrontal scales are the scales connected to the frontal towards {{the tip of the}} snout which are in contact with the internasals. They may have a scale in between them. The back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the head has scales connected to the frontal scale called the parietal scales. At the sides {{of the back of the}} head between the parietals above and the supralabials below are scales called temporal scales.|$|E

5|$|There {{are five}} species similar in {{appearance}} to G.maritimus: G.arenophilus, G.decipiens, G.flavus, G.fulgens and G.pseudofulgens. G.arenophilus and particularly G.fulgens {{are the most}} similar. Though G.maritimus and G.arenophilus show similarities in their biogeography and ecology, the typically slightly smaller G.arenophilus differs from G.maritimus morphologically. While G.maritimus has a cap covered in fibrils with small scales, G.arenophilus can sometimes be completely smooth, and spore ornamentation differs, with G.maritimus typically displaying larger warts. Like G.maritimus, G.fulgens has been recorded growing on sand-dune heathland; further, the spores are similar in appearance to those of G.maritimus. However, G.fulgens requires soil rich in peat and must grow among moss. Moreover, {{there are a number}} of morphological differences; G.maritimus mushrooms are larger and thicker, there are never remains of the partial veil on G.fulgens stems, the shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the spores differs between the two species, and the cheilocystidia and caulocystidia are significantly larger on G.maritimus. G.fulgens var. luteicystis is even more distinct from G.maritimus than the nominate variety. Despite the similarities between the three species, the three have been shown to be in different clades within Gymnopilus, suggesting ecological convergence between G.arenophilus and G.maritimus, and morphological convergence between G.fulgens and G.maritimus.|$|E
5|$|Viewed {{from the}} top, the parietal {{increases}} in width at the back; {{the increase is}} small in K. langenbergensis, such that the bone is overall rectangular, but the difference is larger in K. guimarotae. The back of the bone bears a small notch in K. langenbergensis and a general concavity in K. guimarotae that slightly exposes the underlying supraoccipital. The postorbital bears two branches that join with a gentle curve, separated by an angle of 130° in K. langenbergensis. The supratemporal fenestra is roughly square in K. guimarotae but has a thinner back end in K. langenbergensis. In both species, the maximum distance between the supratemporal fenestrae is {{about a third of}} the total width <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the skull. The trapezoidal infratemporal fenestra is 1.5 times as long as it is wide in K. langenbergensis.|$|E
