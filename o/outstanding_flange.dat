40|$|Two {{fundamental}} problems of elastic stability {{are discussed in}} this report. In part one formulas are given for calculating the critical stress at which a thin, <b>outstanding</b> <b>flange</b> of a compression member will either wrinkle into several waves or form into a single half wave and twist the member about its longitudinal axis. A mathematical study of the problem, which together with experimental work has led to these formulas, is given in an appendix. Results of test substantiating the recommended formulas are also presented. In part two the lateral buckling of beams is discussed. The results {{of a number of}} mathematical studies of this phenomenon have been published prior to this writing, but very little experimentally determined information relating to the problem has been available heretofore. Experimental verification of the mathematical deductions is supplied...|$|E

It is written on a weight to strength basis; hence, the main interest is the prediction of the structural weight that is required to achieve a given strength or to carry a specified bending moment. Expressions are developed that relate the beams height to its flange width, and the beam???s web thickness to its flange thickness. A generalized optimum equation was found. The effect of adding a small lip to the <b>outstanding</b> <b>flanges</b> of the beam was investigated experimentally. It was then found analytically that although the efficiency of the beam increased as well as its load carrying capability, a heavier beam resulted. Since, for a given moment, the lipped beam would be heavier than the un-lipped one, and since the objective is minimum weight, the un-lipped beam would be the optimum one...|$|R
