2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20thcentury, René Le Fort mapped typical locations for facial fractures; these are now known as Le Fort I, II, and III fractures (right). Le Fort I fractures, also called Guérin or horizontal maxillary fractures, involve the maxilla, separating it from the palate. [...] Le Fort II fractures, also called pyramidal fractures of the maxilla, cross the nasal bones and the <b>orbital</b> <b>rim.</b> [...] Le Fort III fractures, also called craniofacial disjunction and transverse facial fractures, cross the front of the maxilla and involve the lacrimal bone, the lamina papyracea, and the orbital floor, and often involve the ethmoid bone, are the most serious. [...] Le Fort fractures, which account for 10–20% of facial fractures, are often associated with other serious injuries. [...] Le Fort made his classifications based on work with cadaver skulls, and the classification system has been criticized as imprecise and simplistic since most midface fractures involve a combination of Le Fort fractures. [...] Although most facial fractures do not follow the patterns described by Le Fort precisely, the system is still used to categorize injuries.|$|E
5000|$|Hertel exophthalmometer: {{measurement}} {{is taken}} from the lateral <b>orbital</b> <b>rim</b> to the corneal apex. If a patient presents with an orbital fracture or after lateral orbitotomy, the use of Hertel exophthalmometer may be complicated because the lateral <b>orbital</b> <b>rim</b> serves as a reference point for this instrument. Consideration {{should be given to}} the use of the Naugle exophthalmometer in these cases.|$|E
50|$|After a {{fracture}} {{of the floor}} of the orbit, the infraorbital nerve may become trapped, producing an area of anaesthesia under the <b>orbital</b> <b>rim.</b>|$|E
50|$|The orbital septum (Palpebral fascia) is a {{membranous}} {{sheet that}} acts as the anterior boundary of the orbit. It extends from the <b>orbital</b> <b>rims</b> to the eyelids. It forms the fibrous portion of the eyelids.|$|R
5000|$|Naugle {{exophthalmometer}} uses fixation points {{slightly above}} and below the superior and inferior <b>orbital</b> <b>rims</b> (cheek bones and forehead). Naugle exophthalmometer measures the difference in proptosis between the two eyes rather than absolute measure with the Hertel method.|$|R
50|$|Anatolikos {{species have}} a {{carapace}} that is wider than long and granular in texture. It is edged with several spines separated by fissures. Five of the spines coalesce {{to form a}} front that extends past the eyes, a character unique to the genus. The <b>orbital</b> <b>rims</b> are thickened; the genus Anisospinos has a similar feature, but can be distinguished by its sharp, curving spines.|$|R
50|$|In pure orbital blowout fractures, the <b>orbital</b> <b>rim</b> (the most {{anterior}} bony {{margin of}} the orbit) is preserved, while with impure fractures, the <b>orbital</b> <b>rim</b> is also injured. With the trapdoor variant, {{there is a high}} frequency of extra-ocular muscle entrapment, despite minimal signs of external trauma, a phenomenon referred to as a 'white-eyed' orbital blowout fracture. They can occur with other injuries such as transfacial Le Fort fractures or zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures. The most common causes are assault and motor vehicle accidents. In children, the trapdoor subtype are more common.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are several}} types of exophthalmometers, Hertel and Luedde measure the {{distance}} of the corneal apex from the level of the lateral <b>orbital</b> <b>rim</b> while Naugle measures the relative difference between each eye: ...|$|E
50|$|The {{depressor}} supercilii originates on {{the medial}} <b>orbital</b> <b>rim,</b> near the lacrimal bone, and inserts on the medial {{aspect of the}} bony orbit, inferior to the corrugator supercilii. In some specimens it exhibits two heads and in others, only one.|$|E
50|$|Tessier, {{who had his}} {{background}} in the craniofacial surgery, made the step to a subperiosteal dissection via a coronal incision. In 1979, Tessier demonstrated that the subperiosteal undermining of the superior and lateral <b>orbital</b> <b>rims</b> allowed the elevation of the soft tissue and eyebrows with better results than the classic face-lifting. The objective was to elevate the soft tissue over the underlying skeleton to re-establish the patient's youthful appearance.|$|R
5000|$|Blepharophimosis {{syndrome}} is an autosomal dominant characterized by blepharophimosis (horizontal shortening of the palpebral fissures), ptosis (upper eyelid drooping, usually with {{the characteristics of}} congenital ptosis), epicanthus inversus (skin folds by the nasal bridge, more prominent lower than upper lid), and telecanthus (widening of {{the distance between the}} medial orbital walls). This {{syndrome is}} caused by mutations in the FOXL2 gene, either with premature ovarian failure (BPES type I) or without (BPES type II). [...] It may also be associated with lop ears, ectropion, hypoplasia of superior <b>orbital</b> <b>rims,</b> and hypertelorism.|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 145 {{patients}} with orbital dermoid cysts examined at the Orbital Clinic, Institute of Ophthalmology, School of Medicine, University of Naples ''Federico II'' {{over a period}} of 16 years were reviewed. The orbital cysts were classified as exophytic and endophytic, according to their site of attachment in relation to the <b>orbital</b> <b>rims.</b> This classification can explain the different natural history of these lesions. The exophytic cysts growing externally are discovered in childhood, whereas the endophytic ones are discovered later in life when they produce bone damage, with or without invasion of the adjacent structures...|$|R

5000|$|Exophthalmometer is an {{instrument}} used {{for measuring the}} degree of forward displacement of the eye in exophthalmos. The device allows measurement of the forward distance of the lateral <b>orbital</b> <b>rim</b> {{to the front of}} the cornea.

5000|$|A {{zygomatic}} [...] "sandwich" [...] osteotomy is {{far less}} common. The procedure is often indicated during reconstructive surgery for birth defects or traumatic injury. During this procedure, the zygoma, or cheekbone, is separated by bone cuts near the <b>orbital</b> <b>rim</b> and maxilla. The bone is then moved outward and a solid material, such as hydroxylapatite, is wedged in place to hold the new position of the zygoma.|$|E
2500|$|Once the {{examination}} is complete, the skull is cleaned and any damaged or fragmented areas are repaired with wax. The mandible is then reattached, again with wax, {{according to the}} alignment of teeth, or, if no teeth are present, by averaging the vertical dimensions between the mandible and maxilla.

50|$|The {{advantages}} of this flap {{is that there}} is no need to skin graft the donor site and scars are placed at the natural skin folds. This flap is used for posterior and moderate-sized anterior cheek defects. Lower eyelid ectropion should be prevented, by minimizing tension and by overcorrection and suspension of the cheek flap to the lateral <b>orbital</b> <b>rim.</b> This anterior-based flap is supplied by the facial and submental arteries and advances upward from the cervical area and rotates forward.|$|E
50|$|Le Fort II {{fracture}} (pyramidal) {{may result}} from {{a blow to the}} lower or mid maxilla. The key component of these fractures beyond the pterygoid plate fractures is involvement of inferior <b>orbital</b> <b>rim.</b> When viewed from the front, the fracture is classically shaped like a pyramid. It extends from the nasal bridge at or below the nasofrontal suture through the superior medial wall of the maxilla, inferolaterally through the lacrimal bones which contain the tear ducts, and inferior orbital floor through or near the infraorbital foramen.|$|E

40|$|Objective and Importance: Fibrous {{dysplasia}} is {{a benign}} skeletal condition which can involve the craniofacial skeleton. Surgery is indicated for correction of deformity and neurovascular decompression. Traditional surgery involves harvesting remote bone or calvarial grafts, requiring prolonged, multisite procedures. Custom implants may {{eliminate the need}} for bone harvesting, but usually require staged procedures with interim bony defects. We report the use of preoperative cranial modeling and implant design, allowing for a single reconstructive procedure. Clinical Presentation: A 32 -year-old woman with McCune-Albright syndrome was referred to Neurosurgery and Ophthalmology for right facial pain, deformity, and eye pressure. Examination revealed a 6 -mm right eye proptosis and decreased sensation and severe pain in the right V 2 distribution. Imaging demonstrated extensive fibrous dysplasia, with right orbital mass effect and nerve compression. Intervention: A single procedure was planned to remove and replace the involved bone. High-resolution CT was used to create a scale model of the patient's cranium. The planned resection was performed on the model, allowing for preoperative custom implant design. We then performed single-stage resection and reconstruction. The right superior and lateral <b>orbital</b> <b>rims,</b> portions of the left superior and medial <b>orbital</b> <b>rims,</b> and the nasion were resected. The custom implant was contoured to fit and remaining small defects were filled with Fast Set Norian. No complications occurred. At follow-up, the patient reported pain and pressure relief, and examination showed resolution of proptosis, improved sensation, and excellent cosmesis. Conclusion: Preoperative cranial modeling and implant design allows for a shorter, one-step resection and reconstruction procedure without compromising structural or cosmetic outcome...|$|R
40|$|Reconstructive {{procedures}} were used on 14 {{patients who had}} undergone orbital exenteration and radiotherapy for malignant tumours. All patients were tumour free after a follow-up of between 5 and 18 years. Reconstruction {{was carried out in}} 3 stages. in the first operation the orbit was filled, in the second the <b>orbital</b> <b>rims</b> and eyelids were shaped, and in the third a cavity for a static eye prosthesis was created. Critical assessment of results showed that the first stage alone produced a marked improvement in appearance and occluded existing fistulae. the subsequent procedures improved aesthetic results further. Difficulties were encountered from retraction of the tissues and insufficient tissue mobility.

50|$|Diamond darters bear {{a strong}} {{resemblance}} to crystal darters, their relatives. Both fishes are translucent, and have olive-colored patterns on their bodies. Diamond darters differ {{in that they}} have a gape equal to or larger than the width of the base of their interpelvic fins, which are shaped like sickles. They also have blotches in front of the eyes that are separate from the <b>orbital</b> <b>rim.</b> The diamond darter has fewer dorsal spines and anal rays than the crystal darter. It also has fewer rows of scales on the cheek (2), and opercle (2).|$|E
5000|$|Blepharophimosis is a {{congenital}} condition {{characterized by}} a horizontally narrow palpebral fissure. It {{is also part of}} a syndrome Blepharophimosis, ptosis, and epicanthus inversus syndrome, also called Blepharophimosis syndrome, which is a condition where the patient has bilateral ptosis with reduced lid size, vertically and horizontally. The nasal bridge is flat and there is hypoplastic <b>orbital</b> <b>rim.</b> [...] Both the vertical and horizontal palpebral fissures (eyelid opening) are shortened; the eyes are also spaced more widely apart than usual, also known as telecanthus.Vignes (1889) probably first described this entity, a dysplasia of the eyelids.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{original}} description of Tambachia, Sumida et al. (1998) concluded that Anconastes {{was the closest}} relative of Tambachia.

50|$|The {{occipital}} {{was well}} preserved and almost completely intact. The temporals were damaged; the left temporal was more complete than the right temporal. The parietals were shattered; {{the majority of}} the right parietal was reconstructed, along with fragments of the left parietal. The frontal was mostly gone, a small piece of the right side above the brow ridge remained. The central region of the face includes much of the nasal aperture, part of the left nasal bone, part of the <b>orbital</b> <b>rims</b> with the lacrimal grooves, parts of the sphenoid, and much of the right orbital plate. Part of {{the right side of the}} face is preserved down to the infraorbital foramen, and on the left side there is a part that goes down to the palate, where the roots for the left canine, P3, P4, M1, and M2 are found.|$|R
30|$|In {{the left}} {{superior}} orbital wall fracture where the tissue adhesion was not severe, tissue dissection was completed without an osteotomy {{of the superior}} <b>orbital</b> wall <b>rim.</b> The titanium mesh was placed and fixed through conventional methods.

40|$|Endoscopic brow lift {{has become}} widely {{accepted}} as a procedure for restoring a youthful brow, as only three, hardly noticeable incisions of the scalp are needed for this subperiosteal dissection and final repositioning of the brow. It has become an acceptable technique, {{an alternative to the}} conventional technique or transcoronal browpexy. Endoscopic brow lift allows separation and repositioning of the periosteum of the <b>orbital</b> <b>rims</b> and zygomaxilla. In a 7 -year period beginning September 1999, 350 patients underwent endoscopic brow lift. In these patients, we used our fixation approach, which was accomplished with an absorbable suture subperiosteally. Satisfactory forehead rejuvenation was obtained in all patients with correct eyebrow movement. Long-term results over 7 years confirm the strength and durability of our fixation approach. We consider this approach to be a simple, fast, and reliable fixation technique that establishes precise, secure, and direct brow fixation that allows satisfactory and long-lasting cosmetic results...|$|R
50|$|The sensory nerves of the {{forehead}} {{connect to the}} ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve and to the cervical plexus, and lie within the subcutaneous fat. The motor nerves of {{the forehead}} connect to the facial nerve. The ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve, the supraorbital nerve, divides at the <b>orbital</b> <b>rim</b> into two parts in the forehead. One part, the superficial division, runs {{over the surface of}} the occipitofrontalis muscle. This provides sensation for the skin of the forehead, and for the front edge of the scalp. The other part, the deep division, runs into the occipitofrontalis muscle and provides frontoparietal sensation.|$|E
50|$|Two skulls are known, and {{the skull}} length for Cedarpelta is {{estimated}} to have been roughly 60 cm. One of the Cedarpelta skulls was found disarticulated, a first for an ankylosaur skull, allowing paleontologists {{a unique opportunity to}} examine the individual bones instead of being limited to an ossified unit. The skull is relatively elongated and does not show a strongly appending beak. Of the conical premaxillary teeth, the first is the largest. The maxilla bears eighteen teeth. The eye socket is surrounded by the lacrimal, a single supraorbital and a large postorbital, excluding the prefrontal and the jugal from the <b>orbital</b> <b>rim.</b> The postcranial skeleton was in 2001 not described in any detail.|$|E
50|$|Treatment is surgical, {{and usually}} {{is able to}} be {{performed}} once life-threatening injuries are stabilized, to allow the patient to survive the general anesthesia needed for invasive orthopedic restructuring. First a frontal bar is used, which refers to the thickened frontal bone above the frontonasal sutures and the superior <b>orbital</b> <b>rim.</b> The facial bones are suspended from the bar by open reduction and internal fixation with titanium plates and screws, and each fracture is fixed, first at its superior attachment to the bar, then at the inferior attachment to the displaced bone. For stability, the zygomaticofrontal suture is usually replaced first, and the palate and alveolar ridge are usually fixed last. Finally, after the horizontal and vertical maxillary buttresses are stabilized, the orbital fractures are fixed last.|$|E
50|$|Colha {{is located}} in north-central Belize, about 52 km. north of Belize City in a chert-rich area, Colha offers an in depth look at Maya warfare and {{collapsed}} polities during the Terminal Classic. Colha is associated with extensive lithic production ranging in time from the early Classic and into the Post Classic. Especially, huge chert quarry is located near Colha so that lots of chert lithics were produced. In addition, the chert artifacts made in Colha spread to other regions such as Pulltrouser Swamp. These artifacts were then refurbished and reused in each region. The site was captured and later abandoned during the Terminal Classic. The site's demise contains insights into the material motivations for Maya warfare and military strategy. Among the archaeological remains is the Colha Skull Pit, which contained the remains of 30 human skulls. The skull pit is particularly unusual because {{the faces of the}} individuals were flayed prior to decapitation. The skin was cut around the skull vault, around the <b>orbital</b> <b>rims</b> and external nasal aperture, inside the mandibular ramus, and along the lower edge of the mandible. Although this pattern is found around the world, it is unusual in Maya ritual.|$|R
40|$|Lax crepey skin {{is a major}} {{unsightly}} finding {{throughout the}} face and body that occurs from chronological aging and environmental photodamage. Surgical lifting procedures are unable to induce sufficient neocollagenesis and also associated with visible scars, risks and recovery time. In this preliminary report, non-invasive delivery of microfocused ultrasonic thermal coagulation points at two levels of the dermis outside the <b>orbital</b> <b>rims</b> was effective in reduction of crepey, wrinkled and sagging skin for about 1 ½ years in nineteen treated patients. Matched Orientation Mirror Imaging produced an average brow height elevation of 1 - 2 mm. Microfocused thermal coagulation points at multiple tissue levels also induced tissue tightening and reduction of crepey wrinkled skin in the décolletage, brachium, periumbilicus, inner thigh and knees. Investigator and Subject Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale graded responses that correlated to {{the severity of the}} degree of crepiness and laxity. Pain management during the procedure included the use of infiltration of local anesthesia. No permanent adverse events were observed. Further innovations in the current technology are needed for more effective and safer delivery of energy to improve the appearance of crepey and lax tissue in the head, neck and body...|$|R
