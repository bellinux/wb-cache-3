5|$|Dunga {{anonymously}} reveals to Kika {{that her}} husband is cheating on her, thinking that if he can destroy their marriage, then he and Wellington can become lovers. Kika finds Wellington and Dayse together, attacks them, and then leaves for good. Wellington goes to the Texas Hotel to seek solace. Dunga wants to take Wellington up to his room, but Wellington is {{put off by the}} funeral of the recently deceased owner of the hotel. Meanwhile, Isaac is thrown <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> after trying to forcibly grab Lígia. He is then seen driving his car and when he meets Kika, he takes her to his apartment and they have sex. As the film concludes, Lígia is shown again complaining about her routine. This is followed by a montage of everyday city life, ending with Kika deciding to dye her hair the same shade that made Isaac so attracted to Lígia.|$|E
5|$|Still {{carrying}} a grudge against Robbit, Aloha seeks Kabuki and convinces him {{to form an}} alliance {{so that they can}} destroy Robbit together. In exchange, Aloha will pay Kabuki a large amount of money, and Kabuki, also desiring revenge against Robbit, agrees. Aloha and Kabuki attack Little Muu together, prompting Robbit to take action again. Eventually, Robbit and Kabuki battle each other one last time, and Robbit manages to destroy Kabuki once and for all while Aloha flees for his life once again. At the end of the game, Aloha returns to Little Muu, but is disowned by all the Muu Muus, who now resent him for teaming with Kabuki (who had tried to destroy them all) and trying to destroy Robbit, who had saved their lives. They throw him <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> and tell him to never come back.|$|E

50|$|Flynt began {{publishing}} the Hustler Newsletter containing {{information about his}} various clubs. By 1974 the Hustler Newsletter had morphed into the full-fledged magazine, Hustler. A year into publishing Hustler the magazine was grossing more than $500,000 per issue. Later that same year with publishing profits far surpassing those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hustler Clubs, Flynt decided to get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bars</b> business and be a publisher full-time.|$|R
25|$|In {{a gloomy}} bar, Raoul contemplates his {{relationship}} with Christine. He is joined by Meg, who tells him she swims each day to wash away the stress of working. She tells Raoul that he must leave with Christine and Gustave and runs <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> ("Why Does She Love Me?"). Raoul {{says he is not}} afraid of the Phantom. Suddenly, the Phantom reveals himself to Raoul and they make a bet that if Christine sings, the Phantom wins and if she doesn't, Raoul wins. If Raoul wins the bet, the Phantom will pay his debts and Raoul can leave with Christine and Gustave. However, if The Phantom wins, Christine and Gustave will remain in America with him and Raoul must return to Paris alone. The Phantom also leads Raoul to question Gustave's paternity ("Devil Take the Hindmost"). Fleck, Squelch and Gangle appear to advertise Christine's appearance at Phantasma ("Invitation to the Concert"). That night, Meg performs a strip-tease about her choice of swimming costumes ("Bathing Beauty"). She successfully impresses the audience, but Madame Giry reveals to Meg that the Phantom did not watch the performance, saying it was for nothing ("Mother, Did You Watch?").|$|E
500|$|The {{police were}} to {{transport}} the bar's alcohol in patrol wagons. Twenty-eight cases of beer and nineteen bottles of hard liquor were seized, but the patrol wagons had not yet arrived, so patrons were required {{to wait in line}} for about 15minutes. Those who were not arrested were released from the front door, but they did not leave quickly as usual. Instead, they stopped outside and a crowd began to grow and watch. Within minutes, between 100 and 150people had congregated outside, some after they were released from inside the Stonewall, and some after noticing the police cars and the crowd. Although the police forcefully pushed or kicked some patrons <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar,</b> some customers released by the police performed for the crowd by posing and saluting the police in an exaggerated fashion. The crowd's applause encouraged them further: [...] "Wrists were limp, hair was primped, and reactions to the applause were classic." ...|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Stan {{changing}} {{from the police}} outfit she ended up with in the [...] "Mr. Saxobeat" [...] video into a red dress in a dressing room. Following this, she walks down a staircase into a saloon bar and sings to the bar's crowd. Afterwards, a man makes appearance {{at the bar and}} plays cards with Stan in front of all people. Subsequently, the police men who arrested Stan in [...] "Mr. Saxobeat" [...] enter the bar looking for her. They eventually see her and try to arrest her again. However, the man that played cards with the singer defends her, beginning to bar-fight with the police men; they win the fight, with all people lying on the floor. Upon next, the police men are sitting on the bar stool next to the bar man and are presented a tape. Meanwhile, it is shown in a flashback in sepia that, while the men were bar-fighting, Stan was grabbing the money from the cards and ran <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar.</b> The video ends with one of the police man punching the bar man. Scenes interspersed throughout the main plot present Stan singing in front of an old-fashioned wall, sporting a white worn blouse and hot pants. An editor from Los 40 Principales cited the video for [...] "Get Back (ASAP)" [...] as one of the singer's best clips ever. Hamard from Pure Charts wrote that the visual would have an impact on males and deemed Stan as [...] "sensual".|$|E

5000|$|Speaking of founder Pete Kuykendall and <b>the</b> {{influence}} <b>of</b> Bluegrass Unlimited, David Freeman, {{owner of}} Rebel Records and County Records, said: [...] "When the magazine started publishing, bluegrass {{was pretty much}} at a low point. The magazine spread the word and highlighted <b>the</b> artistic aspect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> music, which helped to bring it <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bars</b> where {{it was in the}} 1950s.

40|$|To {{determine}} <b>the</b> bond behavior <b>of</b> {{ribbed bars}} under repeated loads, 308 pullout specimens were tested. The specimens failed by pulling <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bars.</b> In <b>the</b> tests the following parameters were varied: maximum load and load amplitude, bar diameter, concrete quality, and bond Iength. Furthermore, as a comparison, tests under sustained load were carried out. A repeated load {{has a similar}} influence on the bond as on the deformation and failure behavior of unreinforced concrete, and it accelerates, in comparison with a sustained load, the nonelastic deformation (slip) ...|$|R
2500|$|Three white Minneapolis police {{officers}} were charged in the beating of an African American man in a suburb south of Minneapolis, in 2013. William C. Woodis, Christopher J. Bennett and Andrew R. Allen were off-duty and having drinks at a bar when a black man introduced himself to them. When Apple Valley, Minnesota police were called the officers claimed that Spann followed them <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar,</b> but security camera footage showed them following him. Spann's nephew, who was also hit by the officers, as well as another witness {{who did not know}} Spann or the officers, said that the officers were [...] "on attack." [...] Woodis and Bennett pled guilty to misdemeanor charges of disorderly conduct. Charges against Allen were dropped.|$|E
2500|$|Workman {{fired at}} Schultz twice. One bullet struck him {{slightly}} below his heart, and ricocheted through his abdomen before exiting {{the small of}} his back. Schultz collapsed onto the floor, and Workman joined Weiss in the back room of the restaurant. Both men then fired several times at Schultz's gang members: Otto Berman, Schultz's accountant; Abe Landau, Schultz's chief henchman; and Schultz's bodyguard, Bernard [...] "Lulu" [...] Rosencrantz. Berman collapsed immediately after being shot. Landau's carotid artery was severed by a bullet passing through his neck, while Rosencrantz was hit repeatedly at point blank range with 00 lead buckshot. Nevertheless, both men rose to their feet and returned fire, driving the assassins out of the restaurant. Weiss jumped into the getaway car and ordered the driver to abandon Workman. Landau chased Workman <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> and emptied his pistol at him, though he missed. Workman fled on foot, and Landau finally collapsed onto a nearby trash can.|$|E

60|$|It was a dark, low, sinister-looking place. Not {{a sign of}} life or {{movement}} was visible anywhere about it. Green stains streaked the once white facade <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chapel in all directions. Moss clustered thick in every crevice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heavy scowling wall that surrounded the convent. Long lank weeds grew <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fissures <b>of</b> roof and parapet, and, drooping far downward, waved wearily in and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>barred</b> dormitory windows. <b>The</b> very cross opposite the entrance-gate, with a shocking life-sized figure in wood nailed to it, was so beset at the base with crawling creatures, and looked so slimy, green, and rotten all the way up, that I absolutely shrank from it.|$|R

50|$|The Hustler Club is a {{chain of}} strip clubs. In 1968, Flynt opened the first Hustler Club which {{featured}} semi-clothed girls. One Hustler Club in Dayton quickly lead to a chain <b>of</b> clubs with <b>the</b> same name in Cincinnati, Columbus, Cleveland, Toledo, and Akron. By early 1970, he had eight clubs and 300 employees. In 1974 with profits from Hustler magazine far surpassing those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hustler Clubs, Flynt decided to get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bars</b> business and be a publisher full-time. For close to 30 years the Hustler Club name lay dormant. In the early 2000s (decade), LFP began to license the Hustler Club name for new clubs across the country. Currently there are Hustler Clubs in 6 U.S. states and 3 countries.|$|R
500|$|Principal filming began <b>the</b> {{last week}} <b>of</b> August 1942. [...] The entire picture was filmed on a sound stage, with no {{location}} shooting. Hepburn {{had already begun}} her extramarital affair with Spencer Tracy, and the production was notorious for {{the ways in which}} Hepburn doted on Tracy. Tracy drank heavily during the shoot, and Hepburn was his constant guardian, nurse, maid, and gofer during this time. She tried to keep him <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bars,</b> assisted him when he was drunk, reinforced his ego, and ran lines with him. However, Hepburn continued to be upset by the script, and dealt with this problem by isolating herself from friends and family in order to concentrate on her interpretation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> role.|$|R

60|$|March {{followed}} him to the bar parlor with some wonder, and his dim sense of repugnance was not dismissed by the first sight of the innkeeper, who was widely different from the genial innkeepers of romance, a bony man, very silent behind a black mustache, but with black, restless eyes. Taciturn as he was, the investigator succeeded at last in extracting a scrap of information from him, by dint of ordering beer and talking to him persistently and minutely on the subject of motor cars. He evidently regarded the innkeeper as in some singular way an authority on motor cars; as being deep in the secrets of the mechanism, management, and mismanagement of motor cars; holding the man all the time with a glittering eye like the Ancient Mariner. Out of all this rather mysterious conversation there did emerge at last a sort of admission that one particular motor car, of a given description, had stopped before the inn about an hour before, and that an elderly man had alighted, requiring some mechanical assistance. Asked if the visitor required any other assistance, the innkeeper said shortly that the old gentleman had filled his flask and taken a packet of sandwiches. And with these words the somewhat inhospitable host had walked hastily <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar,</b> and they heard him banging doors in the dark interior.|$|E
60|$|He got down-stairs next morning, to be sure, {{and had his}} meals as usual, {{though he}} ate little, and had more, I am afraid, than his usual supply of rum, for he helped himself <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar,</b> scowling and blowing through his nose, and no one dared to cross him. On {{the night before the}} funeral he was as drunk as ever; and it was shocking, in that house of mourning, to hear him singing away at his ugly old sea-song; but, weak as he was, we were all in fear of death for him, and the doctor was {{suddenly}} taken up with a case many miles away, and was never near the house after my father's death. I have said the captain was weak; and indeed he seemed rather to grow weaker than regain his strength. He clambered up- and down-stairs, and went from the parlour to the bar and back again, and sometimes put his nose out of doors to smell the sea, holding on to the walls as he went for support, and breathing hard and fast like a man on a steep mountain. He never particularly addressed me, and it is my belief he had as good as forgotten his confidences; but his temper was more flighty, and, allowing for his bodily weakness, more violent than ever. He had an alarming way now when he was drunk of drawing his cutlass and laying it bare before him on the table. But, with all that, he minded people less, and seemed shut up in his own thoughts and rather wandering. Once, for instance, to our extreme wonder, he piped up to a different air, a kind of country love-song, that he must have learned in his youth before he had begun to follow the sea.|$|E
6000|$|Another {{portrait}} which irresistibly {{attracted the}} eye was the half-length of Robert M'Queen, of Braxfield, Lord Justice-Clerk. If I know gusto in painting when I see it, this canvas was painted with rare enjoyment. The tart, rosy, humorous {{look of the}} man, his nose like a cudgel, his face resting squarely on the jowl, has been caught and perpetuated with {{something that looks like}} brotherly love. A peculiarly subtle expression haunts the lower part, sensual and incredulous, like that of a man tasting good Bordeaux with half a fancy it has been somewhat too long uncorked. From under the pendulous eye-lids of old age the eyes look out with a half-youthful half-frosty twinkle. Hands, with no pretence to distinction, are folded on the judge's stomach. So sympathetically is the character conceived by the portrait-painter, that it is hardly possible to avoid some movement of sympathy {{on the part of the}} spectator. And sympathy is a thing to be encouraged, apart from humane considerations, because it supplies us with the materials for wisdom. It is probably more instructive to entertain a sneaking kindness for any unpopular person, and among the rest, for Lord Braxfield, than to give way to perfect raptures of moral indignation against his abstract vices. He was the last judge on the Scots bench to employ the pure Scots idiom. His opinions, thus given in Doric, and conceived in a lively, rugged, conversational style, were full of point and authority. <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar,</b> or off the bench, he was a convivial man, a lover of wine, and one who [...] "shone perculiarly" [...] at tavern meetings. He has left behind him an unrivalled reputation for rough and cruel speech; and to this day his name smacks of the gallows. It was he who presided at the trials of Muir and Skirving in 1793 and 1794; and his appearance on these occasions was scarcely cut to the pattern of to-day. His summing up on Muir began thus--the reader must supply for himself [...] "the growling blacksmith's voice" [...] and the broad Scots accent: [...] "Now this is the question for consideration--Is the panel guilty of sedition, or is he not? Now, before this can be answered, two things must be attended to that require no proof: First, that the British constitution is the best that ever was since the creation of the world, and it is not possible to make it better." [...] It's a pretty fair start, is it not, for a political trial? A little later, he has occasion to refer to the relations of Muir with [...] "those wretches," [...] the French. [...] "I never liked the French all my days," [...] said his Lordship, [...] "but now I hate them." [...] And yet a little further on: [...] "A government in any country should be like a corporation; and in this country it is made up of the landed interest, which alone has a right to be represented. As for the rabble who have nothing but personal property, what hold has the nation of them? They may pack up their property on their backs, and leave the country in the twinkling of an eye." [...] After having made profession of sentiments so cynically anti-popular as these, when the trials were at an end, which was generally about midnight, Braxfield would walk home to his house in George Square with no better escort than an easy conscience. I think I see him getting his cloak about his shoulders, and, with perhaps a lantern in one hand, steering his way along the streets in the mirk January night. It might have been that very day that Skirving had defied him in these words: [...] "It is altogether unavailing for your lordship to menace me; for I have long learned to fear not the face of man"; and I can fancy, as Braxfield reflected on the number of what he called Grumbletonians in Edinburgh, and of how many of them must bear special malice against so upright and inflexible a judge, nay, and might at that very moment be lurking in the mouth of a dark close with hostile intent--I can fancy that he indulged in a sour smile, as he reflected that he also was not especially afraid of men's faces or men's fists, and had hitherto found no occasion to embody this insensibility in heroic words. For if he was an inhumane old gentleman (and I am afraid it is a fact that he was inhumane), he was also perfectly intrepid. You may look into the queer face of that portrait for as long as you will, but you will not see any hole or corner for timidity to enter in.|$|E

[...] In the mid-1990s, dancers at Billy's made $50 plus tips, which typically amounted to about $500 per night. After the change in policy to avoid the zoning laws, the bikini-clad dancers could expect to take home about $200. Patrons were quoted as saying, [...] "You can see this on the beach for free. This is no fun." [...] Billy's Topless closed for good in 2001, and the space was converted into a bagel shop.|$|R
