5|$|It {{is largely}} unknown how baleen whales produce sound {{because of the}} lack of a melon and vocal cords. In a 2007 study, it was {{discovered}} that the larynx had U-shaped folds which are thought to be similar to vocal cords. They are positioned parallel to air flow, as opposed to the perpendicular vocal cords of terrestrial mammals. These may control air flow and cause vibrations. The walls of the larynx are able to contract which may generate sound with support from the arytenoid cartilages. The muscles surrounding the larynx may expel air rapidly <b>or</b> <b>maintain</b> a constant volume while diving.|$|E
5|$|Early studies {{reported}} high success rates: {{in one study}} in 1925, 60% of patients became seizure-free, and another 35% of patients had a 50% reduction in seizure frequency. These studies generally examined a cohort of patients recently treated by the physician (what {{is known as a}} retrospective study) and selected patients who had successfully maintained the dietary restrictions. However, these studies are difficult to compare to modern trials. One reason is that these older trials suffered from selection bias, as they excluded patients who were unable to start <b>or</b> <b>maintain</b> the diet and thereby selected from patients who would generate better results. In an attempt to control for this bias, modern study design prefers a prospective cohort (the patients in the study are chosen before therapy begins) in which the results are presented for all patients regardless of whether they started or completed the treatment (known as intent-to-treat analysis).|$|E
5|$|PennDOT has {{recently}} begun the Route 1011-Pond Eddy Bridge Replacement Project. Route 1011 is the internal designation for Flagstone Road, {{one of the}} two side roads in Pennsylvania along with the bridge. The state has proposed a four-span bridge with three connecting bridge piers, with four side options: replacing the bridge upstream, buying out the 26 residences on the Pennsylvania side, rehabilitating the structure to handle weights of 16-18 tons <b>or</b> <b>maintain</b> the bridge in its current form. Depending on which project is chosen, the estimated start would be in 2013, when the structure reaches its 110th year in use. The entire project would cost $8.5-11 million. Opponents of demolishing the bridge hope that they can find a place to move the bridge, which would cost $500,000, and have the new owners maintain it.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{becoming}} a tropical storm, Fabian was disorganized and had restricted outflow. An eastward moving upper-level trough imparted a northeast motion {{as well as}} unfavorable wind shear. Despite the atmospheric conditions, Fabian intensified slightly to peak winds of 45mph (75km/h), although the strongest winds were located primarily east of the center. Late on October15, the storm moved over the Isle of Youth before crossing over western Cuba. By early on October16, the center was becoming difficult to locate on satellite imagery. The storm moved through the Florida Straits, passing just southeast of the Florida mainland and into the Bahamas. There was initial uncertainty whether Fabian would be absorbed by the approaching trough <b>or</b> <b>maintain</b> its separate identity. By late on October16, Fabian transitioned into an extratropical cyclone as it was absorbed into the trough.|$|E
