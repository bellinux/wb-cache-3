25|$|On {{the other}} hand, Among the {{religious}} and Orthodox groups in Israel, many individuals chose to part from the religious lifestyle and embrace a secular lifestyle (they {{are referred to as}} Yotz'im bish'ela).

The most prominent organizations whom assist Yotz'im bish'ela are the NGO organizations Hillel and Dror.|$|E
25|$|When, in 1578, {{the young}} king Sebastian with almost his whole army met death, and Portugal saw {{the end of}} her glory, at Alcazarquivir, the few nobles who {{remained}} were taken captive and sold to the Jews in Fez and Morocco.

Numerous newly immigrated Jews, whose descendants faithfully adhere to the use of their Spanish dialects, Ladino and Haketia to the present day and who surpass older Jewish Moroccans in education and intellectual achievement, subsequently become prominent in Moroccan history. With their skill in European commerce, arts, and handicrafts, hitherto largely unknown to the Moors, and with their wealth, Jews have contributed conspicuously to the rise and development of the Alaouite Dynasty since its beginning in 1666.|$|E

The walk from the bus station to the temple is less than one kilometre, under a roofed walkway. Direct buses are available from many places, including Mount Abu (45km away), Palanpur (65km away), Ahmedabad and Idar. The Bhadrapad fair is held in the centre of the Ambaji village just outside the temple premises. The village is visited by the largest number of sanghas (pilgrim groups) during the fair. Many <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>go</b> there on foot, which is particularly enriching as it happens immediately after the monsoon, when the landscape is rich with greenery, streams are full of sparkling water and the air is fresh. About 1.5million devotees are known to attend this fair each year from all over the world.
