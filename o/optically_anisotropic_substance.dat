40|$|Modulation {{techniques}} for measuring changes in optical birefringence, {{such as the}} rotating-polariser method (Wood and Glazer, 1980, J. Appl. Crystallogr. 13, 217), allow one to determine |sin delta|, delta = 2 piLDeltan/lambda, Deltan = double refraction, L = light path and lambda = wavelength. However, they generally suffer from not providing absolute values of the optical retardance or are limited to relatively low retardance values. In addition, knowledge of the absolute phase is required when establishing the correct values of optical orientation information. In this paper, it is shown how the phase delta, and thus optical retardance, can be extracted from combining measurements of |sin delta| at different wavelengths. The new approach works on each single point of a 2 -D picture without the need to correlate with neighbouring points. There is virtually no limit to the retardance, and the computational efforts are small compared with other methods (e. g. Ajovalasit et al. 1998, J. Strain Analysis 33, 75). When used with imaging techniques, such as the rotating polariser method of Glazer, Lewis and Kaminsky 1996 (Proc. R. Soc. London Series A 452, 2751) this process {{has the potential to}} identify automatically <b>optically</b> <b>anisotropic</b> <b>substances</b> under the microscope.

On the other hand, the electric filed with high frequency (10 MHz) induced much slower birefringence response compared to the frequency of the electric filed. In order to eliminate the influence of ionic impurity, birefringence, dielectric, and infrared measurements were carried out for NMF and some other amides applying alternative electric current of 10 MHz.

We present preliminary results of numerical calculations of the scattering by spherical droplets in some simple cases.

For uniform anisotropy the cross-section is strongly dependent on the angle between the incident light and the optical axis, and for larger droplets this dependence is non-monotonic.
