50|$|Two {{international}} treaties concerning human rights were {{established by the}} United Nations in 1966: the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights with its two <b>Optional</b> <b>Protocols</b> and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.

50|$|The International Bill of Human Rights was {{the name}} given to UN General Assembly Resolution 217 (III) and two {{international}} treaties established by the United Nations. It consists of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (adopted in 1948), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (1966) with its two <b>Optional</b> <b>Protocols</b> and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (1966). The two covenants entered into force in 1976, after {{a sufficient number of}} countries had ratified them.|$|R
5000|$|The Declaration {{consists}} of thirty articles which, although not legally binding, have been elaborated in subsequent international treaties, economic transfers, regional human rights instruments, national constitutions, and other laws. The International Bill of Human Rights {{consists of}} the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and its two <b>Optional</b> <b>Protocols.</b> In 1966, the General Assembly adopted the two detailed Covenants, which complete the International Bill of Human Rights.|$|R
25|$|The {{original}} DNS protocol {{had limited}} provisions for extension with new features. In 1999, Paul Vixie published in RFC 2671 an extension mechanism, called Extension mechanisms for DNS (EDNS) that introduced <b>optional</b> <b>protocol</b> elements without increasing overhead {{when not in}} use. This was accomplished through the OPT pseudo-resource record that only exists in wire transmissions of the protocol, but not in any zone files. Initial extensions were also suggested (EDNS0), such as increasing the DNS message size in UDP datagrams.|$|E

25|$|Pakistan acceded to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) on 29 February 1996.

Pakistan failed to submit its initial report that was due in 1997. Pakistan neither signed nor ratified the <b>Optional</b> <b>Protocol</b> of the Women's Convention, {{which has led to}} non-availability of avenues for filing grievances by individuals or groups against Pakistan under CEDAW.|$|E
