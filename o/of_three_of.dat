5|$|A {{notoriously}} violent man, Yamashita {{was known}} for his many street fights. In the most famous instance, he got involved in a brawl with no less than 17 laborers in Tokyo due to a dispute in a restaurant. Despite their vast numeric advantage, added to {{the fact that some of}} them wielded knives, Yamashita and a fellow judoka disposed of all the men, purposely breaking the arms <b>of</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> them in the process. Shortly after, Yoshiaki would get into another quarrel with another cadre of laborers, this time him against 15 of them, but it ended up the same way: Yamashita maimed his attackers with chokes and throws, and even killed some of them by breaking their necks. He was arrested, but was easily acquitted after proving the uneven nature of the brawls. However, he was still suspended by the Kodokan for excessive use of violence. When confronted by Kano himself, Yamashita protested and went to the extent of challenging his master to a fight, but Kano convinced to stop his violent ways by making him realize that some day he might be harmed the same way he liked to harm people.|$|E
5|$|During the English {{occupation}} of Scotland under the Commonwealth, fortresses {{in the style}} of the trace italienne were built. These were polygonal in plan with triangular bastions, as at Ayr, Inverness and Leith. Twenty smaller forts were built as far away as Orkney and Stornoway. Control of the Highlands was secured by strongpoints at Inverlocky and Inverness. These were built at a massive cost in money and manpower. The citadel at Inverness, begun in 1652 and using stone shipped from as far away as Aberdeen, had cost £50,0000 when it was still unfinished by 1655. Inverlochy had a garrison of 1,000 and from 1654 became the centre for a new administrative region of Lochaber, made up <b>of</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> the most remote and lawless shires.|$|E
5|$|Edward III's grandson, Richard II, {{made little}} use of Hadleigh, {{and the use}} of the castle was granted to Aubrey de Vere until his death in 1400. The castle was passed amongst a number of high-status owners during the 15th century, but saw little use by the crown. Edmund of Langley and his son Edward of Norwich, the Dukes of York, used the castle in the early years, before passing it on to Humphrey of Lancaster, the Duke of Gloucester. Richard, Duke of York, used the castle next, before it passed to Edmund Tudor in the middle of the century. The {{tradition}} of the castle forming part of the queen's property was then reinstated and it was granted to Elizabeth Woodville, the wife of Edward IV. Henry VIII made no known use of the castle himself, but it formed part of the dower <b>of</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> his wives - Catherine of Aragon, Anne of Cleves, and Catherine Parr - and the castle's parks were used as sources of timbers for his navy.|$|E

Smyth urged Truman to endorse international control of nuclear weapons, but Truman decided instead to authorize a hydrogen bomb program. In his autobiography, Smyth's Princeton colleague John Archibald Wheeler recalled that Smyth recruited him to the Ivy Mike hydrogen bomb project and expressed support for the project {{in response to the}} Soviet test.|$|E
5|$|For {{the role}} of Apu, Ray advertised in {{newspapers}} for boys of ages five to seven.

Ray eventually found Chunibala Devi, a retired stage actress living in one of Calcutta's red-light districts, as the ideal candidate. Several minor roles were played by the villagers of Boral, where Pather Panchali was filmed.|$|E
5|$|From late 1651, passes {{were needed}} {{to move from one}} area of the country to another. The {{ownership}} of firearms was restricted, necessitating a licence. In the Highlands the administration fell back on the ancient expedient of making clan chiefs responsible for the conduct of their followers. The security of the regime depended on an armed force of never less than 10,000 men. Citadels were built at Ayr, Perth and Leith and 20 smaller forts were built as far away as Orkney and Stornoway. Control of the Highlands was secured by strongpoints at Inverlocky and Inverness. These were built at a massive cost of money and manpower.
