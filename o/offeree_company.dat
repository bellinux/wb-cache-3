40|$|The Romanian Capital Market Law (Law no 297 / 2004) {{lays down}} rules {{regarding}} public offers (to buy or sell) of securities admitted to trading on a regulated market. Such offers are not {{unknown in the}} general framework of companies’ regulations, i. e. Company Law no 31 / 1990. Actually a {{public limited liability company}} (joint stock company) can use a public subscriptions (offering shares for sale) to raise the registered capital for incorporation of the company or to increase the company’s share capital already established. But all such operations are voluntary decisions. The founders or the shareholders of the company are those who decide to launch a public subscriptions. Capital Market Law comes with something new and at least peculiar at first sight: mandatory takeover bid, meaning a mandatory public offer made by an offeror to the holders of the securities of a company (offeree) to acquire all or some of those securities. Can someone be forced to buy securities on the regulated market? The Capital Market Law responds affirmatively, but only if such takeover bid follows or has as its objective the acquisition of control of the <b>offeree</b> <b>company</b> in accordance with national law. The takeover bid remains under supervision and authorization of the national authority of the Capital Market (FSA – Financial Supervisory Authority) ...|$|E
40|$|This DPhil thesis {{analyses}} the Takeover Bid Directive in {{the light}} of EU Law and examines the extent to which this Directive facilitates the exercise of the fundamental freedom of establishment and the free movement of capital in the internal market. Since the Directive is based on the EC Treaty chapter on freedom of establishment (Articles 43 and 44 (2) (g) EC Treaty), it should in principle contribute to cross frontier corporate mobility in the internal market through takeover bids; this was the aim of the Commission in its various proposals. Takeover bids and the EC Treaty provisions on freedom of establishment are closely related. The Directive forms part of the EU company law harmonization programme whose weaknesses and limits are also explored. However, the Takeover Bid Directive is an EU company law instrument with strong links to EU capital market law. The initial aims of the EU legislature were to establish an internal market for companies and to achieve market integration in the field of EU company law. However, the Takeover Bid Directive is a compromise and watered down version of a proposal which the Commission envisaged would lead to a more effective pan-European takeover regime than that which actually proved possible. The need for compromise {{was the result of the}} very different legal and policy approaches of the Member States in the field of takeover regulation. Some provisions of the Directive are obligatory for all Member States. These provisions include the mandatory bid rule, the squeeze-out right, and the sell-out right. All these obligatory provisions of the Directive are in their present form open to criticism. The two key provisions of the Directive have been made optional for Member States. These are the non-frustration rule, requiring the board to obtain the prior authorization of the general meeting of shareholders before taking any action which could result in the frustration of the bid; and the breakthrough rule, requiring that any restrictions on the transfer of securities or voting rights provided for in the articles of association of the <b>offeree</b> <b>company</b> or in contractual agreements between the <b>offeree</b> <b>company</b> and the holders of its securities or in contractual agreements between holders of the offeree company’s securities shall not apply vis-à-vis the offeror during the time allowed for acceptance of the bid. Nevertheless, Member States, which opt out, are obliged to allow individual companies to opt in. Moreover, a reciprocity rule was also adopted, which allows Member States to permit those companies, which apply these provisions, to opt out again if they are the target of a bidder, which does not itself apply the same takeover provisions. Additionally, the non-frustration and the breakthrough rule are not fully comprehensive and even when a company applies them, it might still be able to evade their application since some corporate and financial structures remain outside the Directive’s scope. Finally, this thesis discusses the extent to which obstacles to cross border takeovers addressed by the Directive, or indeed left intact by the Directive, are to be regarded as restrictions on the right of establishment stricto sensu, or simply as obstacles in practice to making a successful takeover bid. More specifically, it scrutinizes the horizontal direct effect of the EC fundamental freedoms and seeks to analyze the extent to which conduct of the board and articles in the corporate constitution might be said to constitute restrictions on the freedom of establishment and on the free movement of capital.

40|$|The earlier part of {{the thesis}} investigates {{the reasons for the}} {{considerable}} increase in take- overs within Britain during the 1950 s. The most important of these reasons was the section of the Companies Act 1948 which enabled take-over bidders to by-pass the directors of a company and appeal directly to its shareholders. This new opportunity coincided with circumstances which made shareholders more likely, than was previously the case, to accept offers for their shares. These circumstances are discussed together with other events, such as fiscal changes, which affected take-over activity. Once the possibilities provided by the new situation became realised, companies we re taken over for a large number of different reasons so one chapter is devoted to classifying these reasons, with examples of each. Because a noticeable feature of take- overs has been the often substantial discrepancy between the value of the offer and the stock exchange price prior to the bid, a chapter has been devoted to considering factors {{to be taken into account}} when evaluating an <b>offeree</b> <b>company.</b> Bidders have problems such as financing the take-overs, winning the acceptance of shareholders and coping wit h possible counter-bidders so one chapter mentions these difficulties and the techniques evolved for overcoming them. Directors not wishing their companies to be taken over have developed a variety of defensive measures, these have been classified and divided into two main groups, steps taken before a bid has been made for the company and ad hoc measures to stave off an actual offer. The final chapter deals with some of the results of 20 years of take-overs, together with conclusions which have been drawn. The author's contention is that the effect of post-war take- overs has been mainly beneficial though there are still some abuses which require remedying...|$|E
