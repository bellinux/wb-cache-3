25|$|Improved {{nutrition}} {{is another}} possible explanation. Today's average adult from an industrialized nation is taller than a comparable adult <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>century</b> <b>ago.</b> That increase of stature, likely {{the result of}} general improvements of nutrition and health, has been {{at a rate of}} more than a centimeter per decade. Available data suggest that these gains have been accompanied by analogous increases of head size, and by an increase in the average size of the brain. This argument had been thought to suffer the difficulty that groups who tend to be of smaller overall body size (e.g. women, or people of Asian ancestry) do not have lower average IQs. Richard Lynn, however, claims that while people of East Asian origin may often have smaller bodies, they tend to have larger brains and higher IQs than average whites.|$|E

Celine Dion said that the release of the song would not only benefit the Haitian people, but also serve as a remembrance of [...] "the passion [...] Jackson had for helping those in need". Lionel Richie and Quincy Jones echoed Dion's sentiments and further stated that if the singer were alive, he would have wanted to be just as involved as he had been a quarter <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>century</b> <b>ago.</b> According to Phillips, there was a [...] "handful" [...] of musicians who either declined or could not rearrange their schedules for the song's recording, including country singer Taylor Swift, {{who was going to be}} touring in Australia.|$|E

There are four improvised tracks inspired by John Coltrane's Giant Steps: [...] "Paseo Iluminado", [...] "Paseo en Media Luz", [...] "Paseo Azul", and [...] "Paseo Morado". [...] "Iluminado (Improv #1)", according to Roberto R. Calder of PopMatters, has [...] "stock phrasing, but {{a pause in}} concentration before the sublime quality of a one-minute lullaby worth waiting for"; [...] "Media Luz (Improv #2)" [...] "hints at jazz with concert-room sonorities and a striking ending"; [...] "Azul (Improv #3)" [...] "proceeds with more consistent direction than its two predecessors" [...] and becomes a hymn"; and [...] "Morado (Improv #4)" [...] "develops into long linear passages for each hand." [...] "Faro" [...] is a track with [...] "a simple ostinato bass, a transition section and a loud climax." [...] The opening track, [...] "Rezo", is an interlude inspired {{by the work of}} French composer Claude Debussy and American performer Duke Ellington, and is [...] "based on Afro-Cuban melodies sung during Santería rites." [...] "Silencio" [...] is a tribute to Cuban boleros. [...] "Prologo (Prologue to a Fantasy)" [...] features a [...] "congenial intellectual playfulness alternating between something like Spanish piano music <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>century</b> <b>ago,</b> and the dance-hall." [...] "Bésame Mucho" [...] was first included on the 1991 album The Blessing, Rubalcaba's first recording to be issued in the United States, and the version was named by Scott Yanow of Allmusic a [...] "highlight" [...] of the album, including accompaniment from Haden on bass guitar and drummer Jack DeJohnette. A reworked version is included on Solo, and is described as having an [...] "intensely meditative character and slow deliberation," [...] and [...] "a more complex higher level of communication" [...] than the original version. [...] "Here's That Rainy Day" [...] is a jazz ballad, recorded earlier for the album Inner Voyage, with an arrangement described as [...] "breathtaking" [...] by Ken Dryden of Allmusic. The first version of [...] "Quasar" [...] can be found on Paseo (2004); and the version included on Solo is described as [...] "seven minutes of drama," [...] by Calder of PopMatters, with [...] "a sprawling, improv-heavy composition that runs Rubalcaba up and down the keyboard." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1985, Burgess {{published}} Flame into Being: The Life and Work of D. H. Lawrence, {{and while}} discussing Lady Chatterley's Lover in his biography, Burgess compared that novel's notoriety with A Clockwork Orange: [...] "We all {{suffer from the}} popular desire to make the known notorious.

The film made it easy for readers of the book to misunderstand what it was about, and the misunderstanding will pursue me until I die. I should not have written the book because of this danger of misinterpretation, and the same may be said of Lawrence and Lady Chatterley's Lover."

2500|$|Hebrew persevered {{through the}} ages as the main {{language}} for written purposes by all Jewish communities {{around the world for}} a large range of uses—not only liturgy, but also poetry, philosophy, science and medicine, commerce, daily correspondence and contracts. There have been, of course, many deviations from this generalization such as Bar Kokhba's letters to his lieutenants, which were mostly in Aramaic, and Maimonides' writings, which were mostly in Arabic; but overall, Hebrew did not cease to be used for such purposes. This meant not only that well-educated Jews {{in all parts of the}} world could correspond in a mutually intelligible language, and that books and legal documents published or written in any part of the world could be read by Jews in all other parts, but that an educated Jew could travel and converse with Jews in distant places, just as priests and other educated Christians could converse in Latin. For example, Rabbi Avraham Danzig wrote the Chayei Adam in Hebrew, as opposed to Yiddish, as a guide to Halacha for the [...] "average 17-year-old" [...] (Ibid. Introduction 1). Similarly, the Chofetz Chaim, Rabbi Yisrael Meir Kagan's purpose in writing the Mishna Berurah was to [...] "produce a work that could be studied daily so that Jews might know the proper procedures to follow minute by minute". [...] The work was nevertheless written in Talmudic Hebrew and Aramaic, since, [...] "the ordinary Jew [...] <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>century</b> <b>ago,</b> was fluent enough in this idiom to be able to follow the Mishna Berurah without any trouble." ...|$|E
