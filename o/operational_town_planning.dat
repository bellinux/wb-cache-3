40|$|The {{relationships}} between the land management system and the <b>town</b> <b>planning</b> system {{play a crucial role}} in the process of land development, especially as Henan province is experiencing accelerated industrialization. In recent years, China has adjusted its land management system. The findings of the research show that the current land management system and <b>town</b> <b>planning</b> system of China are not compatible with each other when faced with the rapid industrialization of the core towns in Henan province. Furthermore, the incompatibilities between China’s current land management system and <b>town</b> <b>planning</b> system have impeded the growth of the industrial scale and raised the costs of industrialization. There are two main reasons which cause the incompatibilities between these two systems, namely the contrasting characteristics between the <b>town</b> <b>planning</b> system and land management system and the different objectives between the local governments and the central government of China. The incompatibilities between China’s <b>town</b> <b>planning</b> system and land management system are rooted in and shaped by the central-local relations...|$|R

40|$|W artykule w sposób praktyczny przedstawiono możliwości zastosowania narzędzi GIS podczas przeprowadzania analizy planu miasta pod kątem morfologicznym. Krok po kroku scharakteryzowano poszczególne etapy takiej analizy, wskazując na korzyści, jakie niesie za sobą wykorzystanie tychże narzędzi. Zwrócono również uwagę na mogące pojawić się trudności i pokazano sposoby minimalizowania ich wpływu na przebieg badań. Urban {{morphology}} is {{a scientific}} discipline which studies the external structure (i. e. shape and physiognomy of buildings) {{and the internal}} structure (i. e. layout) of the town, {{as well as the}} genesis and evolution of its various parts (their morphogenesis). The main research method in urban morphology is the <b>town</b> <b>plan</b> analysis. It is based on observation of changes in the urban space of the study area by comparing chronologically listed <b>town</b> <b>plans.</b> GIS tools may be applied in urban morphology at all stages of <b>town</b> <b>plan</b> analysis: from the selection of source materials (especially archival <b>town</b> <b>plans),</b> through a proper analysis of morphology and morphogenesis of the study area, to the presentation of the results of these analyses. The paper shows the possibilities of using these tools. It also identifies a number of advantages and benefits related with the introduction of GIS to urban morphology. Attention is also paid to difficulties which may arise at each stage of research. It seems that rectification of archival <b>town</b> <b>plans</b> is the most troublesome task. The older a plan is, the harder it is to register. Another disadvantage is the necessity of arduous digitization of all archival maps. Overcoming these difficulties opens the way to all advantages of GIS. The greatest advantage of applying GIS to the <b>town</b> <b>plan</b> analysis is the improvement of comparison of <b>town</b> <b>plans</b> from the same area but from different periods of time. Adding georeferences to archival maps, and converting them to one coordinate system, facilitates unification of the scale of all <b>town</b> <b>plans,</b> and allows overlapping of one <b>town</b> <b>plan</b> with another. In turn, the digitization of archival maps enables the introduction of uniform signs and uniform naming for thematic vector layers in all analysed periods of time, which facilitates tracing the evolution of the <b>town</b> <b>plan...</b>|$|R
