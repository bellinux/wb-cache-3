40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to confirm a {{hypothesis}} of the effect of media <b>on</b> the <b>public</b> administration. Within the theoretical part a concept of public administration and the concept of Czech Republic public administration together with its application in legal enactments are explained. In the second theoretical part further concepts are explained, including concepts of media, media fragmentation, the Czech Republic media system, public opinion and the interaction between politics and media. In the practical part of this paper there are results of a questionnaire enquiry focused on the impact of media <b>on</b> the <b>public</b> administration. The results confirmed the hypothesis about the impact of media <b>on</b> the <b>public</b> administration, also a hypothesis about the impact of some specific factors such as age, education, sex, or place of residence on the impact of media <b>on</b> the <b>public</b> administration and finally a hypothesis was confirmed that media generally have higher impact <b>on</b> the <b>public</b> opinion in case of the direct presidential election than in case of the municipal council election. Further in text the expenses used to draw attention in individual types of media and the extent of its impact <b>on</b> the <b>public</b> relations are compared. We therefore established the effectivity of the examined types of media...|$|R
