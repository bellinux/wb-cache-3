5|$|Relative of the Rowan family, Stephen Collins Foster, {{occasionally}} visited Federal Hill {{according to}} letters penned by Stephen's brother Morrison Foster. Stephen {{was inspired by}} the imagery witnessed at Federal Hill and by Harriet Beecher Stowe's anti-slavery novel Uncle Tom's Cabin to write his ballad My Old Kentucky Home. The mansion remained in the possession of Rowan's family until 1922, when his granddaughter, Madge (Rowan) Frost, sold it to the state of Kentucky to be preserved as a state shrine. Today, it is a part <b>of</b> <b>My</b> <b>Old</b> Kentucky Home State Park in Bardstown. In 1856, the Kentucky General Assembly created a new county from parts of Fleming and Morgan counties and named it Rowan County in Rowan's honor.|$|E
5|$|After {{his term}} in the Senate, Rowan {{returned}} to Kentucky, where he served as {{the first president of}} the Louisville Medical Institute and the Kentucky Historical Society. In 1840, he was appointed to a commission to prosecute land claims of U.S. citizens against the Republic of Mexico, but resigned his commission in 1842 because of failing health. He died July 13, 1843 and was buried on the grounds of Federal Hill, his estate in Bardstown. According to tradition, Stephen Collins Foster, a distant relative of Rowan's, was inspired to write the ballad My Old Kentucky Home after a visit to Federal Hill in 1852, but later historians have been unable to conclude whether or not Foster ever visited the mansion at all. The mansion is now owned by the state of Kentucky and forms the centerpiece <b>of</b> <b>My</b> <b>Old</b> Kentucky Home State Park.|$|E

My wife, after the absence of her terms for seven weeks, gave me hopes of her being with child, but on the last day of the year she hath them again.|$|E

500|$|... "Vida" [...] is a latin pop song {{written by}} Arjona, who {{produced}} it alongside longtime collaborators Dan Warner and Lee Levin, under their stagename Los Gringos. Doug Emery provided the piano, while Lee Levin performed the percussion and drums instruments and Briang Lang the bass. Roger Silvestre Ramírez and Wendy Pedersen provided additional background vocals on the song, while Andrés Saavedra and Isaías García {{served as the}} recording engineers. It is considered by Arjona as an autobiographical song, commenting that it [...] "contains a good dose of the life <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>old</b> mand", as a reference to his father, who died in 2011. In an interview, music video director Joaquín Cambre commented that [...] "'Vida' is a sweet song, exciting and bitter nonetheless."

500|$|Before the album's release, in December 2012, Cudi {{dedicated}} Indicud to {{the late}} Ben Breedlove and all his fans who died, continuing: [...] "My journey shall continue in your honor. Never forgotten." [...] The dedication was ultimately included in the album's liner notes. The album is upbeat and optimistic, very much unlike his previous studio album [...] (2010), which was considered darkly erratic. The positive vibe stems from Cudi's desire to always change and reinvent: [...] "I always try to push myself {{to the next level}} with everything I do. Since I've been in the business, critics have known that about me. When I started working on Indicud, I just wanted to bring more energy into my sound. Most <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>old</b> music was driven towards relaxed, chilled out smoke music. And that was my goal first coming in. Now it's like, 'What’s a side of me that people haven’t seen?' The only time people have seen me on up-tempos is on remixes or some shit. So I just wanted to take the energy to the next level. That ultimately inspired the subject matter. It was a chain reaction. With the up-tempos came more positive lyrics. It just brightened up the whole shit." ...|$|E

Later in April, Timbaland released a new single featuring T-Pain and Billy Blue titled [...] "Talk That". In June 2010, when questioned by RWD magazine about the UK music scene he made the bold {{claim to be the}} inspiration for the dub-step music scene. [...] "The UK scene... they’re always telling me that I started it. You have Dub-bass...". When questioned further about it he went on to say: [...] "It’s funny cos they went back to some <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>old</b> music that really created that sound and just, instead of going fast, they went slow with more bass." [...] In August 2010, a [...] "possible suicide attempt" [...] APB was put out for Timbaland after his home was burgled. When his family were unable to contact him, they called 911 and a manhunt began. Police eventually found his car and brought him back home, where paramedics examined him, before declaring he was not a threat to himself. When questioned, Timbaland said he only took a drive to think about the burglary, as he thought the possible thief could have been someone close whom he trusted.|$|E
500|$|While Staunton {{was busy}} with the Shakespeare edition, he {{received}} a courteous letter from the New Orleans Chess Club, inviting him to that city to play Paul Morphy, who had won the recent First American Chess Congress. Staunton replied, thanking the New Orleans Chess Club and Morphy [...] "for the honor implied in your selection of me as the opponent of such a champion" [...] and pointing {{out that he had}} not competed for several years and was working six days a week (on editing Shakespeare), and that he could not possibly travel across the Atlantic for a match. He also wrote in The Illustrated London News that he had [...] "been compelled, by laborious literary occupation, to abandon the practice of chess, beyond the indulgence of an occasional game...If Mr. Morphy—for whose skill we entertain the liveliest admiration—be desirous to win his spurs among the chess chivalry of Europe, he must take advantage of his purposed visit next year; he will then meet in this country, in France, in Germany and in Russia, many champions... ready to test and do honor to his prowess."In reply to your very courteous proposal for me to visit New Orleans for the purpose of encountering Mr. Paul Morphy at Chess, permit me to mention that for many years professional duties have compelled me to abandon the practice of the game almost entirely except in the most desultory manner, and at the present time these duties are so exacting that it is with difficulty I am enabled to snatch one day out of seven for exercise and relaxation.Under the circumstances you will at once perceive that a long and arduous chess contest, even in this Metropolis, would be an enterprise too formidable for me to embark in without ample opportunity for the recovery <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>old</b> strength in play, together with such arrangements as would prevent the sacrifice of my professional engagements {{for the sake of a}} match at chess, and that the idea of undertaking one in a foreign country, many thousand miles from here, is admissible only in a dream.With friendly greetings to my proposed antagonist, whose talent and enthusiasm no one can more highly estimate, and with compliments to you for the honour implied in your selection of me as the opponent of such a champion, I beg to subscribe myself, with every consideration.Yours obediently,H. Staunton"—from Evidently reprinted from [...] Chess historian H. J. R. Murray wrote that Staunton's letter and article should have been interpreted as a courteous refusal of the offer, but that Morphy interpreted them differently, and one of the main reasons for his visit to Europe in 1858 was the hope of playing a match with Staunton. Some other chess historians disagree with Murray's interpretation of Staunton's response. Staunton did offer to play Morphy by electric telegraph, a technology whose progress and uses for chess he reported enthusiastically. However this offer arrived after Morphy had left for Europe—which perhaps was fortunate, as the newly laid cable broke down after a month and was not replaced until 1866.|$|E

2500|$|On the {{original}} United States and Canada pressings of Electronic Sound, {{the order of}} the recordings was accidentally switched, although the titles were not. This mistake has caused many listeners to confuse the two pieces. When the album was issued on CD {{for the first time in}} December 1996, the correct running order was used. Harrison was highly dismissive of Electronic Sound and Life with the Lions at this time. Rather than include the planned 1000-word liner note essay in the CD booklet for his album, he supplied his own text, reading simply: [...] "It could be called avant-garde, but a more apt description would be (in the words <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>old</b> friend Alvin), Avant Garde Clue!" ...|$|E
