50|$|In {{core type}} {{friction}} spinning, the core, {{made of a}} filament or a bundle <b>of</b> <b>staple</b> <b>fibres,</b> is false twisted by the spinning drum. The sheath fibres are deposited on the false twisted core surface and are wrapped helically over the core with varying helix angles. It is believed that the false twist in the core gets removed once the yarn is emerged from the spinning drums, so that this yarn has a virtually twist-less core. However, {{it is quite possible}} for some amount of false twist to remain {{in the fact that the}} sheath entraps it during yarn formation in the spinning zone.|$|E
40|$|Objective This {{study has}} as {{objective}} {{to analyze the}} effect of joint immobilization of the soleus muscle of posterior members of rats on morphometric profile view, at periods of 21 and 45 days. Materials and methods Ten male Rattus novergicus albinus, Wistar variety, were used, separated into two groups (group I and II), of 5 animals each, with the first group submitted to immobilization for 21 days and the second for 45 days. The experiment control was acquired from the right contralateral member of each animal. The immobilization of the left posterior member was done by adapted orthesis. The morphometric analysis of soleus was by non-serial cross sections, 8 &# 956;m thick. Results From the obtained images, the muscle fibers areas were analyzed, including {{the form of the}} fibers, comparing with the control group. In both the periods of immobilization cross sections <b>of</b> <b>staple</b> <b>fibres</b> had reduction of the section area, front to the comparison to its respective member has controlled, with significant important (p < 0. 0001), especially it enters the experimental groups of 21 and 45 days.

40|$|The torque in single-spun yarns is an {{inherent}} {{property of the}} twisting and bending <b>of</b> <b>staple</b> <b>fibres</b> during the formation of yarn combined with the effect of applied tension on the yarn. The consequences of yarn torque are well known and are widely observed as yarn instability, e. g., yarn rotation under tension; local snarling and entanglement at low loads, and as distortion in fabric, i. e., edge-curl and skewing in knitted fabric. In this paper, a method for predicting the yarn torque based on the {{radial basis function networks}} is presented and evaluated. This method uses a 'universal approximator' based on neural network methodology to minimize noise during training of the network and to approximate the yarn torque {{as a function of the}} geometrical and physical parameters of yarns (twist, linear density) and the applied load. The current method is an integral radial basis function network-based approach suitable for textile engineering and gives very good prediction of yarn torque across a range of yarn structural parameters and test conditions...|$|E

The purpose of this study is to assess the environmental impact of man-made cellulose fibres. Life cycle assessment (LCA) was conducted for three types of fibres (i. e.

Sensitivity analyses were carried out to understand the influence of different allocation methods. In addition, three single score methods were introduced and applied. The LCA results show that four modern man-made cellulose fibre products, namely Tencel, Modal, Viscose (Austria) and Tencel (2012), have the lowest overall impact among all fibres studied. Viscose (Asia) has a higher overall impact than the other man-made cellulose fibres and is comparable to PET. Cotton is identified as the least preferred choice due to its high ecotoxicity impacts, eutrophication, water use and land use.

40|$|This study {{determined}} the maturation age of Platanus x acerifolia (Ait.) Willd., through anatomical characteristics of thewood {{by means of}} the segregation of the juvenile-mature wood. Three adult trees were elected, of appropriate trunk and with diameterlarger than at 40 cm (48, 41 and 46 cm) the 1. 30 m of height. Discs with 2 cm of thickness at 0. 1 m of height of the trunk were used. From each disc it was removed a central part of 2 cm of width, that was divided at the pith in samples A and B. Only one samplewas selected and the initial wood of each growth ring was separated for maceration (method of Jeffrey). Departing from the pith, thelength, diameter and the lumen <b>of</b> thirty <b>staple</b> <b>fibres</b> in each growth ring were measured. The thickness of the walls of fibers was takenas the half of the difference of the diameter of the fiber and the lumen. The segregation of the two types of wood was defined by the radialvariation (pith-bark) of the anatomical characteristics (length, diameter, width of the lumen and thickness of the wall of fibers),through two simple linear regressions. The results indicate that the fiber length is the best characteristic for defining the segregationage. The age of segregation of juvenile-mature wood was defined as 14 years-old. In turn, the anatomical parameters, diameter offibers, width of the lumen and thickness of the wall of fibers were found inadequate for estimating the age of segregation...|$|R

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{genotype}} and of frequency {{and timing of}} shearing, on mohair attributes and production of modern Angora goats was studied. Goats in the southern hemisphere grazed pastures between February 2004 and 2006. There were seven shearing treatments by three genetic strains with four or eight replicates of individual goats. Treatments were: three different 6 -month shearing intervals and two of 12 -month shearing intervals with different months of shearing, a 7 -month winter shearing interval and a 3 -month shearing interval. Genetic strain was based on sire line: 1 · 0 South African; 1 · 0 Texan; and Mixed 0 · 5 South African and 0 · 5 Texan. Annual greasy mohair production was 5 · 08 kg, and average clean fleece production was 4 · 37 kg. The Angora goats produced an annual clean fleece equivalent to 0 · 122 of their mean fleece-free live weight which was equal to 0 · 34 g/kg/day. Measurements were analysed over the period of spring 2004 shearing to spring 2005 shearing, excluding the June–December shearing treatment. Increased frequency of shearing increased fleece growth and affected 13 objective and subjective attributes of mohair that were evaluated including clean washing yield, fibre diameter and fibre diameter variation, incidence <b>of</b> medullated <b>fibres,</b> <b>staple</b> length, <b>fibre</b> curvature, crimp frequency, style, <b>staple</b> definition, <b>staple</b> <b>fibre</b> entanglement and <b>staple</b> tip shape. The direction of these effects were generally favourable and for most attributes {{the magnitude of the}} response was linear and commercially important. Each additional shearing resulted in an additional 149 g of clean mohair representing 0 · 034 of the annual clean mohair production. This increase was associated with a 0 · 6 cm increase in staple length and 0 · 32 μm increase in mean fibre diameter. In conclusion, Angora goats shorn less frequently grew less mohair that was more likely to be entangled in spring. Managers of Angora goats should take note of these findings. <br /...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} fibre volume {{fraction}} {{on the physical}} and tensile properties of aligned plant fibre composites (PFCs) produced via vacuum infusion has been investigated. There is no clear correlation between fibre volume fraction and porosity. However, low fibre content PFCs are prone to intra-yarn voids, while high fibre content PFCs are prone to inter-yarn voids. This is due to changing resin flow dynamics with increasing fibre content. The tensile behaviour of PFCs with increasing fibre content {{is similar to that}} of conventional fibre reinforced plastics (FRPs). Interestingly, the non-linear stress–strain response of plant fibres has been transferred to the composites. Fibre content and tensile properties are found to be linearly related, as per the rule of mixtures. A void content of up to 4 % is found to have minimal effect on the tensile properties of PFCs. The minimum and critical (vf,crit) fibre volume fractions for aligned flax and jute–polyester composites are found to be substantially higher than conventional aligned FRPs; vf,crit for jute–polyester and carbon–polyester is 8. 1 % and 2. 4 %, respectively. A simple model has also been developed to approximate the theoretical maximum obtainable fibre volume fraction of PFCs reinforced with <b>staple</b> <b>fibre</b> yarns. The absolute theoretical maximum fibre content is found to be 58. 9 %, which agrees with experimental values in literature. A high vf,crit (∼ 10 %) and low vf,max (∼ 45 %) implies that the range of useful fibre volume fractions for PFCs containing <b>staple</b> <b>fibre</b> twisted yarns is only 35 %...|$|R
