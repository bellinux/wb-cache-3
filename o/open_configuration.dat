40|$|The {{electronic}} transport {{properties and}} switching mechanism of single photochromic diarylethene derivatives sandwiched between two gold surfaces with closed and <b>open</b> <b>configurations</b> are investigated by a fully self-consistent nonequilibrium Green's function method combined with density functional theory. The calculated transmission spectra of two configurations are strikingly distinctive. The open form lacks any significant transmission peak within a wide energy window, while the closed structure has two significant transmission peaks on the {{both sides of}} the Fermi level. The electronic transport properties of the molecular junction with closed structure under a small bias voltage are mainly determined by the tail of the transmission peak contributed unusually by the perturbed lowest perturbed unoccupied molecular orbital. The calculated on-off ratio of currents between the closed and <b>open</b> <b>configurations</b> is about two orders of magnitude, which reproduces the essential features of the experimental measured results. Moreover, we find that the switching behavior within a wide bias voltage window is extremely robust to both substituting F or S for H or O and varying end anchoring atoms from S to Se and Te.

Unified perception of moving forms requires interactions between these streams, although whether the interactions occur early or late in cortical processing remains unresolved.

5000|$|Tedisamil acts {{to restore}} normal {{electrical}} rhythm {{in the heart}} by prolonging the inactivation phase of the muscle. Both atrial and ventricular repolarization is lengthened by tedisamil by blocking multiple potassium channels including the transient outward (Ito), the adenosine triphosphate-dependent (IK-ATP), and the delayed rectifier potassium currents (IKr and IKs). Tedisamil action is dose dependent as currents are blocked longer and more effectively at higher concentrations. Tedisamil activity is greatest on Ito and acts by binding to the channel in its <b>open</b> <b>configuration.</b> This produces a blocked state and delays its inactivation. To restore normal function, tedisamil must unbind from the channel {{so that it can}} inactivate and eventually reopen. Similar mechanisms have been observed on the IKr and IKs currents. In both Ito and delayed rectifier channels, the tedisamil binding site appears to be internal as both binding and unbinding occur more effectively when tedisamil is applied inside the cell. Tedisamil also appears to provide specific, single channel blocking of IK-ATP at high concentrations. [...] As the potassium channels are responsible for restoring the resting membrane potential during an action potential, lengthening their inactivation will stop the cycle of fibrillation by preventing muscle contraction until all ion channels are available to open. Regular use of tedisamil will prevent further fibrillation and restore normal electrical rhythm.Tedisamil’s antiarrythmic activity also appears to be supported by inhibiting sodium currents in cardiac muscle. However this is only observed at concentrations above 20μM, concentrations 20-fold higher than required for potassium channel blocks.|$|E
5000|$|A user {{interface}} allows to familiarize oneself {{with the basic}} functionality of DAvE in a significantly small amount of time. Once the user has learned the main steps of creating an embedded application with DAvE the application development can be performed very fast. By providing a graphical {{user interface}} and a wizard {{it is easy to}} memorize the steps, even when the user returns to the tool after a period of not using it. In general, in embedded application development it is easy to make mistakes by creating conflicting configurations, e.g., assigning one I/O pin to multiple modules or select not supported baud rate for communication or wrong operating frequency. When using DAvE these conflicts are being resolved by reducing the configuration choices automatically. In addition to that, in order to being able to use the source code generated by DAvE and to create a meaningful embedded application, it is crucial to understand the functionality of the generated C-functions and the targeted hardware. DAvE’s interactive user interface provides a fail-safe way to select desired features before beginning to program an application. Conﬁguration windows allow the designer to select and conﬁgure a specific product and then automatically generate code for that product, including its core, peripherals, memory, appropriate driver functions, and interrupts. As changes are made in conﬁguration options, all resulting changes in code are dynamically updated and displayed in all applicable <b>open</b> <b>conﬁguration</b> windows. In addition, the program automatically creates detailed documentation for each conﬁguration, with complete explanations of function calls, macros, parameters, and return values. It also features a built-in register viewer that displays all registers and enables the user to easily track changes up to bit configurations. To add user specific functionality to the automatically generated code DAvE offers designated user code areas (marked by //USER CODE BEGIN and //USER CODE END comment section), where application specific code can be entered using any editor. This ensures that these parts won’t be overwritten when applying further changes to the microcontroller configurations through DAvE later.|$|E
