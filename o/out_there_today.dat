At a press conference two days after his election, the 50-year-old Henderson told reporters, [...] "I believe today, and people say I’m crazy, but if you gave me as many at-bats that you would give the runners <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>today,</b> I would outsteal every last one of them... they can always ring my phone and I'll come on down and help their ballclub, that's how much I love the game." ...|$|E

Assembling materials molecule by molecule could solve energy problems, cure cancer and other diseases, strengthen our bodies, and produce self-assembling food, clothing, and buildings. Kurzweil admits that nanotechnology carries a big risk; a self-replicating substance, without the constraints of a living organism, might grow out of control and consume everything. However he points <b>out</b> that <b>today</b> <b>there</b> are already technologies which pose grave risks, for example nuclear power or weapons, and we have managed to keep them relatively safe, so he feels we can probably do the same with nanotechnology.|$|R

These things have angered the king and the people. Of course it is nothing, for our troops are only {{beginning}} to assemble; but it is considered insolent in the extreme, and the king's face is darkened against your countrymen. Four of the prisoners have been taken out this morning and publicly executed and, if the news of another defeat comes, I fear that it will be very dangerous, even for you." ...|$|R

The seminar {{is part of}} the course: “Tik- 110. 590 research seminar on digital media ” at Helsinki University of Technology. Benefits of pervasive computing in travel industry are discussed to justify the work. Business and leisure travelers are mostly studied individually because they have different user needs. Business solutions aim to cost efficiency and productivity while people at vacation mainly want to have fun. Different vehicles are part of traveling. Ubiquitous computing solutions in cars, airplanes and ships are studied briefly. Pervasive computing will emerge as integration of wide variety of technologies. Some of these technologies are more characteristic to travel solutions and are pointed <b>out.</b> <b>There</b> are services <b>today</b> that can be counted as first steps towards pervasive computing in the sector.

She performed on four dates in late June 2009 with the inclusion of Brian May in each night's encore. Of the concerts, Ellis commented, [...] "It's finally something that I can do as me, {{as opposed to being}} in a show as a character. It's lovely to be able to sing songs that I really want to sing or which I wouldn't normally get to sing." [...] The showcase paid tribute to some of Ellis' favourite British composers and lyricists including Take That, Duffy, Andrew Lloyd Webber and Paul McCartney. Of her [...] "eclectic set" [...] with [...] "velvety rich distinctive vocals," [...] a critic professed, [...] "Ellis is as sexy as any other female pop star <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>today</b> and she sings like a true diva," [...] and concluded, [...] "She may have left Oz for good but there is no place like home and for Kerry Ellis that home is most definitely the stage." ...|$|E

I began my {{study with the}} intention of writing a screenplay with strong female characters in leading roles without succumbing to stereotypes. I read feminist critiques of films and applied these concepts to my screenplay and the accompanying essay. In my essay I referred to successful films and television shows with females in comical or leading roles. I also contrasted three recently released films, Meet Dave, Rambo IV and Juno, with my screenplay and discussed the differences between the representation of women and men in each of these films. I then commented on what I was trying to achieve in my screenplay compared to what is <b>out</b> <b>there</b> in cinemas <b>today.</b> My final screenplay met my expectations because it shows that I can write a screenplay with interesting female characters who are not defined by stereotypes such as the caring mother, the dutiful wife or the attractive sexual siren. My female characters play active roles and have interesting lives and unique personalities...|$|R
50|$|The Cobalt silver rush {{started in}} 1903 when huge veins of silver were {{discovered}} by {{workers on the}} Temiskaming and Northern Ontario Railway (T&NO) near the Mile 103 post. By 1905 a full-scale silver rush was underway, {{and the town of}} Cobalt, Ontario sprang up to serve as its hub. By 1908 Cobalt produced 9% of the world's silver, and in 1911 produced 31,507,791 ounces of silver. However, the good ore ran out fairly rapidly, and most of the mines were closed by the 1930s. There were several small revivals over the years, notably in World War II and again in the 1950s, but both petered <b>out</b> and <b>today</b> <b>there</b> is no active mining in the area.

50|$|Biggin {{was once}} known as Newbiggin, when it had a monastic {{settlement}} of the Cistercian order, established by the monks of Garendon Abbey, Leicestershire. The monks established a sheep ranch at Biggin Grange, which still has one ancient outbuilding.

[...] Israel was {{represented}} by Ram, Erlich, Dudi Sela, and Harel Levy. [...] Russia's lineup consisted of Marat Safin (# 24 in the world; former world # 1), Igor Andreev (26), Igor Kunitsyn (35), and Mikhail Youzhny (44; former world # 8). [...] The stage was set by Safin, who prior to the tie told the press: [...] "With all due respect, Israel was lucky {{to get to the}} quarterfinals." [...] The Israeli team's response was to beat the Russian team in each of their first three matches, thereby winning the tie. [...] Levy, world # 210, beat Russia's top player, Andreev, world # 24, 6–4, 6–2, 4–6, 6–2 in the opening match. [...] Sela (# 33) followed by beating Russian Youzhny 3–6, 6–1, 6–0, 7–5. [...] Israeli captain Eyal Ran likened his players to two fighter jets on court, saying: [...] "I felt as if I had two F-16s <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>today,</b> they played amazingly well." [...] The 10,500 spectators were the largest crowd ever for a tennis match in Israel. [...] The next day Ram and Erlich beat Safin and Kunitsyn 6–3, 6–4, 6–7, 4–6, 6–4 in front of a boisterous crowd of over 10,000. [...] "I started to cry like a little boy", said Ram. [...] Even the Saudi Gazette described the doubles match as a [...] "thrilling" [...] win. [...] Captain Ran was carried shoulder-high around the Tel Aviv stadium, as the 10,000-strong crowd applauded. [...] With the tie clinched for Israel, the reverse singles rubbers were [...] "dead", and instead of best-of-five matches, best-of-three sets were played, with the outcomes of little to no importance. Israel wrapped up a 4–1 victory over Russia, as Levy defeated Kunitsyn 6–4, 4–6, 7–6, while Sela retired with a wrist injury while down 3–4 in the first set against Andreev. Ram said: [...] "We have all grown up together since the age of 14. The reason we are in the semis is because we are a united team." ...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{feasibility}} study into how Fresenius Kabi may rationalize their destruction process {{in regards to}} cost, recycling, and work environment. The two main objectives are to identify scrap flows and the possibility to improve or replace the equipment that is now carrying out the physical scrapping. The flow has been visualized by a flow chart of the material and communication. A chart of the problem established to visualize where improvements are necessary. Based on the problems proposals are presented {{on how to improve}} the flow thru the plant. During analyze of the physical scrapping equipment it was also necessary to take a deeper look at how they are carrying <b>out</b> <b>there</b> work <b>today,</b> how does the procedure look like, working environment and where are the weaknesses. On this basis, the problem where analyzed and suggestions for improvement were created.   As today`s equipment is not effective enough a simplified specification established in order to more easily be able to design new equipment. A number of different solutions have been developed and eventually the two best was compared to visualize who fits best. Fresenius Kabi strives to achieve a high environmental awareness therefore this report also looks in to how they handle their waste today and if this is possible to improve it, especially with regards to the possibility to recycling the waste in the best way. Lean and Supply chain management {{has been used as a}} theoretical foundation for this report. This report resulted in proposals of how to change scrapping equipments, working environment and the flow of communication to achieve a more efficiency flow of material trough the plant. ...|$|R
