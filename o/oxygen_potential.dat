During the oxidation of nickel and cobalt at 1373 K in Ar- 21 %O 2 gas, the <b>oxygen</b> chemical <b>potentials</b> at the surface of formed NiO scale and CoO scale were slightly smaller than that in the atmosphere, because the growths of these oxide scales were mainly rate-limited by the diffusion of the constituent ions in the scales. The difference of the <b>oxygen</b> chemical <b>potential</b> between at the surface of CoO scale and in the atmosphere was larger than that between at the surface of NiO scale and in the atmosphere under the same oxidation condition, since the oxygen consumption rate for the oxidation of cobalt was larger than that of nickel.

40|$|The {{high power}} densities and {{temperatures}} expected for next generation nuclear applications, including power generation and transmutation systems, will require {{new types of}} heat transport systems to be economic. Present interest in heavy liquid metal coolants, especially in lead and lead-bismuth eutectic, originates from such requirements as increased heat removal capacity and enhanced safety features. However, corrosion of structural metals represents a major limiting factor in developing advanced liquid Pb-alloy coolant technology. In fact, the development of advanced structural and cladding alloys that are resistant to corrosion {{over a wide range}} of <b>oxygen</b> <b>potentials</b> in this environment would represent the enabling technology for these systems. The goal of this research was to develop a class of Fe-Cr Si alloys that are resistant to corrosion in Pb and Pb alloys at temperatures of 6000 C or higher. As a necessary part of this development effort, an additional goal was to further develop the fundamental understandings of the mechanisms by which corrosion protection is achieved. A series of alloys based on the Fe-Cr-Si system were proposed as potential candidates for this application. These alloys were then produced and evaluated. The results of this evaluation verified the hypothesis that an Fe alloys with suitable levels of Cr (> 12 wt%) and Si (> 2. 5 wt%) will be protected by either a tenacious oxide film (over a wide range of <b>oxygen</b> <b>potentials</b> above the formation potential for Cr and Si oxides) or by a low solubility surface region (at low <b>oxygen</b> <b>potentials)</b> Experimental results obtained from model alloys after lead-bismuth eutectic exposure at 6000 C demonstrated the film formation process. (cont.) The hypothesis that Si addition would promote the formation of a diffusion barrier was confirmed by the actual reduction of oxide thickness over time. The Si effect was magnified by the addition of Cr to the system. Based on a kinetic data assessment on the experimental results of Fe-Si and Fe-Cr-Si alloys, the synergetic alloying effect of Cr and Si was revealed. An improved understanding on the kinetic process and its dependence on the alloying elements has been achieved. by Jeongyoun Lim. Thesis (Sc. D.)

40|$|Nickel orthosilicate (Ni 2 SiO 4) {{has been}} found to {{decompose}} into its component binary oxides in <b>oxygen</b> <b>potential</b> gradients at 1373 K. Nickel oxide was formed at the high <b>oxygen</b> <b>potential</b> boundary, while silica was detected at the low <b>oxygen</b> <b>potential</b> side. Significant porosity and fissures were observed near the Ni 2 SiO 4 /SiO 2 interface and the SiO 2 layer. The critical oxygen partial pressure ratio required for decomposition varied from 1. 63 to 2. 15 as the oxygen pressures were altered from 1. 01 ⊠ 105 to 2. 7 X 10 − 4 Pa, well above the dissociation pressure of Ni 2 SiO 4. Platinum markers placed at the boundaries of the Ni 2 SiO 4 sample indicated growth of NiO at the higher <b>oxygen</b> <b>potential</b> boundary, without any apparent transport of material to the low <b>oxygen</b> <b>potential</b> side. However, significant movement of the bulk Ni 2 SiO 4 crystal with respect to the marker was not observed. The decomposition of the silicate occurs due to the unequal rates of transport of Ni and Si.

A kinetic study {{was made of the}} formation of very thin anodic oxide films on niobium at constant current over the temperature range - 10 to 70 ©�C. Formation voltages were limited to the range below the <b>oxygen</b> evolution <b>potential</b> to eliminate possible interaction of an electronic component of the current with the measured formation field.

40|$|The {{structural}} {{evolution of}} the Pt 3 Ni(111) surface under oxidizing conditions was studied by ab initio atomistic thermodynamics. The thermodynamic phase diagram from Ni-rich to Pt-rich conditions with oxygen coverages up to one monolayer was constructed from their 560 possible surface structures. With {{an increase in the}} <b>oxygen</b> chemical <b>potential,</b> there were only two types of thermodynamically stable structures, which were a clean Pt-skin surface and a Ni-skin surface with chemisorbed oxygen, regardless of the underlying Pt-rich or Ni-rich conditions. Bimetallic surfaces with chemisorbed oxygen were only metastable. The detail analysis revealed that the structural evolution is determined by the factors of segregation cost, difference between oxygen-metal (Pt and Ni) bonding strength, and <b>oxygen</b> chemical <b>potential.</b> (C) 2013, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

40|$|The {{activity}} of Ti in solid Pt has been measured {{as a function}} of composition at 1573 K using a metal oxide-gas equilibration technique under controlled oxygen partial pressures. Thin foils of Pt were equilibrated with TiO_x at constant <b>oxygen</b> chemical <b>potentials.</b> <b>Oxygen</b> partial pressures were established using Ar-H_ 2 -H_ 2 O gas mixtures of controlled composition. A solid state cell, based on yttria doped thoria as the solid electrolyte, independently determined the chemical <b>potential</b> of <b>oxygen</b> in the gas phase. The concentration of Ti in solid Pt was determined using spectrophotometric methods. The activities of Ti were computed from the <b>oxygen</b> <b>potentials</b> established by the gas phase coupled with independent data on the thermodynamic properties of titanium oxides. The excess chemical potential of titanium in solid Pt at 1573 K in J mol- 1 can be represented as Δμ^E Ti= - 83 940 - 214 140 (1 -X_Ti) ^ 2 with an error of ± 2800 J mol^- 1. The activity coefficient of Ti at infinite dilution determined from this study and that of other elements of the first transition series in solid Pt obtained from previous work confirm the trend predicted by both Miedema's model and Engel-Brewer theory. The attractive interaction between the solute and the solvent (Pt) increases with decreasing atomic number of the solute. The self-interaction parameters of the first transition series elements in solid Pt indicate an increase in solute-solute repulsion with decrease in 3 d electron concentration of the solute. The standard Gibbs energy of formation of TiPt_ 3 is - 282. 57 ± 4 kJ mol^- 1 at 1573 K. The large negative values of the Gibbs energy of formation of phases in the system Pt-Ti indicate that Pt is not phase compatible with nitrides and carbides of Ti at high temperatures...|$|R
