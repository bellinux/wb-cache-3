5|$|Interactions between nanotubes, such as {{bundling}}, broaden <b>optical</b> lines. While bundling strongly affects photoluminescence, it {{has much}} weaker effect on <b>optical</b> absorption and Raman scattering. Consequently, sample {{preparation for the}} latter two techniques is relatively simple.|$|E
5|$|<b>Optical</b> {{transitions}} {{are rather}} sharp (~10meV) and strong. Consequently, {{it is relatively}} easy to selectively excite nanotubes having certain (n,m) indices, as well as to detect <b>optical</b> signals from individual nanotubes.|$|E

5|$|The oldest form of {{astronomy}}, <b>optical</b> or visible-light astronomy {{extends from}} approximately 400 to 700 nm. Positioning an <b>optical</b> telescope in space {{means that the}} telescope does not see any atmospheric effects (see astronomical seeing), providing higher resolution images. <b>Optical</b> telescopes are used to look at stars, galaxies, planetary nebulae and protoplanetary disks, amongst many other things.|$|E
5|$|Ultracold atom {{trapping}} in <b>optical</b> lattices is {{an experimental}} tool {{commonly used in}} condensed matter physics, and in atomic, molecular, and <b>optical</b> physics. The method involves using <b>optical</b> lasers to form an interference pattern, which acts as a lattice, in which ions or atoms can be placed at very low temperatures. Cold atoms in <b>optical</b> lattices are used as quantum simulators, that is, they act as controllable systems that can model behavior of more complicated systems, such as frustrated magnets. In particular, {{they are used to}} engineer one-, two- and three-dimensional lattices for a Hubbard model with pre-specified parameters, and to study phase transitions for antiferromagnetic and spin liquid ordering.|$|E
5|$|Visible light waves {{oscillate}} {{faster than}} microwaves, and therefore <b>optical</b> clocks {{can be more}} precise than caesium atomic clocks. The Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt is working on several such <b>optical</b> clocks. The model with one single ytterbium ion caught in an ion trap is highly accurate. The <b>optical</b> clock based on it is exact to 17 digits after the decimal point.|$|E

25|$|The main {{mechanism}} for sorting is {{the arrangement of}} the <b>optical</b> lattice points. As the cell flow through the <b>optical</b> lattice, there are forces due to the particles drag force that is competing directly with the <b>optical</b> gradient force (See Physics of <b>optical</b> tweezers) from the <b>optical</b> lattice point. By shifting {{the arrangement of the}} <b>optical</b> lattice point, there is a preferred <b>optical</b> path where the <b>optical</b> forces are dominant and biased. With the aid of the flow of the cells, there is a resultant force that is directed along that preferred <b>optical</b> path. Hence, there is a relationship of the flow rate with the <b>optical</b> gradient force. By adjusting the two forces, one will be able to obtain a good <b>optical</b> sorting efficiency.|$|E

25|$|An {{alternative}} to achromatic doublets {{is the use}} of diffractive <b>optical</b> elements. Diffractive <b>optical</b> elements are able to generate arbitrary complex wave fronts from a sample of <b>optical</b> material which is essentially flat. Diffractive <b>optical</b> elements have negative dispersion characteristics, complementary to the positive Abbe numbers of <b>optical</b> glasses and plastics. Specifically, in the visible part of the spectrum diffractives have a negative Abbe number of −3.5. Diffractive <b>optical</b> elements can be fabricated using diamond turning techniques.|$|E

25|$|Today, {{the pure}} science of optics is called <b>optical</b> science or <b>optical</b> physics to {{distinguish}} it from applied <b>optical</b> sciences, which {{are referred to as}} <b>optical</b> engineering. Prominent subfields of <b>optical</b> engineering include illumination engineering, photonics, and optoelectronics with practical applications like lens design, fabrication and testing of <b>optical</b> components, and image processing. Some of these fields overlap, with nebulous boundaries between the subjects terms that mean slightly different things {{in different parts of the}} world and in different areas of industry. A professional community of researchers in nonlinear optics has developed in the last several decades due to advances in laser technology.|$|E
25|$|Wu {{transformed}} the <b>optical</b> energy from low powered {{light emitting diodes}} (LED) into electrical energy via a photoconductive surface. The idea is to allow the LED to {{switch on and off}} the photoconductive material via its fine projection. As the <b>optical</b> pattern can be easily transformable through <b>optical</b> projection, this method allows a high flexibility of switching different <b>optical</b> landscapes.|$|E
25|$|In the {{optically}} actuated sorting process, {{the cells}} are flowed through into an <b>optical</b> landscape i.e. 2D or 3D <b>optical</b> lattices. Without any induced electrical charge, the cells would sort {{based on their}} intrinsic refractive index properties and can be re-configurability for dynamic sorting. An <b>optical</b> lattice can be created using diffractive optics and <b>optical</b> elements.|$|E

25|$|There are two {{distinct}} applications of this technique. One is the <b>optical</b> clock, where an <b>optical</b> frequency is overlapped {{with a single}} tooth of the comb on a photodiode, and a radio frequency is compared to the beat signal, the repetition rate, and the CEO-frequency. Applications for the frequency-comb technique include <b>optical</b> metrology, frequency-chain generation, <b>optical</b> atomic clocks, high-precision spectroscopy, and more precise GPS technology.|$|E

25|$|At high <b>optical</b> powers, {{scattering}} {{can also}} be caused by nonlinear <b>optical</b> processes in the fiber.|$|E
25|$|<b>Optical</b> {{coherence}} tomography (OCT) is {{an established}} {{medical imaging technique}} that uses light to capture micrometer-resolution, three-dimensional images from within <b>optical</b> scattering media (e.g., biological tissue). <b>Optical</b> coherence tomography is based on low-coherence interferometry, typically employing near-infrared light. The use of relatively long wavelength light allows it to penetrate into the scattering medium. Confocal microscopy, another <b>optical</b> technique, typically penetrates less deeply into the sample but with higher resolution.|$|E
25|$|<b>Optical</b> {{coherence}} tomography {{is one of}} a {{class of}} <b>optical</b> tomographic techniques. A relatively recent implementation of <b>optical</b> coherence tomography, frequency-domain <b>optical</b> coherence tomography, provides advantages in signal-to-noise ratio, permitting faster signal acquisition. Commercially available <b>optical</b> coherence tomography systems are employed in diverse applications, including art conservation and diagnostic medicine, notably in ophthalmology and optometry where {{it can be used to}} obtain detailed images from within the retina. Recently, it has also begun to be used in interventional cardiology to help diagnose coronary artery disease. It has also shown promise in dermatology to improve the diagnostic process.|$|E

25|$|Electron microscopes have {{electron}} <b>optical</b> lens {{systems that}} are analogous to the glass lenses of an <b>optical</b> light microscope.|$|E
25|$|The {{amplification}} {{window of}} an <b>optical</b> amplifier is {{the range of}} <b>optical</b> wavelengths for which the amplifier yields a usable gain. The amplification window {{is determined by the}} spectroscopic properties of the dopant ions, the glass structure of the <b>optical</b> fiber, and the wavelength and power of the pump laser.|$|E
25|$|The {{evanescent}} field {{can also be}} used to trap cold atoms and molecules near the surface of an <b>optical</b> waveguide or <b>optical</b> nanofiber.|$|E
25|$|Diffraction {{gratings}} {{are often}} used in monochromators, spectrometers, lasers, wavelength division multiplexing devices, <b>optical</b> pulse compressing devices, and many other <b>optical</b> instruments.|$|E
25|$|This {{standard}} {{provides guidance}} for the safe use, maintenance, service, and installation of <b>optical</b> communications systems utilizing laser diodes or {{light emitting diodes}} operating at wavelengths between 0.6µm and 1mm. <b>Optical</b> communication systems include end-to-end <b>optical</b> fiber based links, fixed terrestrial point-to-point free-space links, {{or a combination of}} both.|$|E
25|$|An {{intermediate}} <b>optical</b> terminal, or <b>optical</b> add-drop multiplexer. This is {{a remote}} amplification site that amplifies the multi-wavelength signal {{that may have}} traversed up to 140km or more before reaching the remote site. <b>Optical</b> diagnostics and telemetry are often extracted or inserted at such a site, to allow for localization of any fiber breaks or signal impairments. In more sophisticated systems (which are no longer point-to-point), several signals out of the multi-wavelength <b>optical</b> signal may be removed and dropped locally.|$|E
25|$|The Faraday {{effect has}} {{applications}} in measuring instruments. For instance, the Faraday effect {{has been used}} to measure <b>optical</b> rotatory power and for remote sensing of magnetic fields (such as fiber optic current sensors). The Faraday effect is used in spintronics research to study the polarization of electron spins in semiconductors. Faraday rotators can be used for amplitude modulation of light, and are the basis of <b>optical</b> isolators and <b>optical</b> circulators; such components are required in <b>optical</b> telecommunications and other laser applications.|$|E
25|$|Immunity to {{electromagnetic}} interference: Light transmission through <b>optical</b> fibers is {{unaffected by}} other electromagnetic radiation nearby. The <b>optical</b> fiber is electrically non-conductive, {{so it does}} not act as an antenna to pick up electromagnetic signals. Information traveling inside the <b>optical</b> fiber is immune to electromagnetic interference, even electromagnetic pulses generated by nuclear devices.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, a Bell Labs {{research}} team transmitted solitons error-free at 2.5 gigabits {{over more than}} 14,000 kilometres, using erbium <b>optical</b> fibre amplifiers (spliced-in segments of <b>optical</b> fibre containing the rare earth element erbium). Pump lasers, coupled to the <b>optical</b> amplifiers, activate the erbium, which energizes the light pulses.|$|E
25|$|<b>Optical</b> fibers are {{connected}} to terminal equipment by <b>optical</b> fiber connectors. These connectors are usually of a standard type such as FC, SC, ST, LC, MTRJ, MPO or SMA. <b>Optical</b> fibers may be connected to each other by connectors or by splicing, that is, joining two fibers {{together to form a}} continuous <b>optical</b> waveguide. The generally accepted splicing method is arc fusion splicing, which melts the fiber ends together with an electric arc. For quicker fastening jobs, a “mechanical splice” is used.|$|E

25|$|Most <b>optical</b> {{and laser}} mice {{do not require}} a pad. Whether to use a hard or soft mousepad with an <b>optical</b> mouse is largely a matter of {{personal}} preference. One exception occurs when the desk surface creates problems for the <b>optical</b> or laser tracking, for example, a transparent or reflective surface.|$|E
25|$|Inevitable {{manufacturing}} imperfections in <b>optical</b> fiber {{leads to}} birefringence, {{which is one}} cause of pulse broadening in fiber-optic communications. Such imperfections can be geometrical (lack of circular symmetry), due to stress applied to the <b>optical</b> fiber and/or due to bending of the fiber. Birefringence is intentionally introduced (for instance, by making the cross-section elliptical) {{in order to produce}} polarization-maintaining <b>optical</b> fibers.|$|E
