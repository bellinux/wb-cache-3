5|$|The former fort was {{captured}} by Murad Khan of Maqpon Dynasty, the ruler of Baltistan, in the Conquest of Khaplu in the 1590s by cutting <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> and other supplies to the fort. The troops of Murad besieged the fort for three months, resulting in the surrender of Rahim Khan, the 62nd Yabgo dynasty ruler of Khaplu. The fort again fell to invaders in the 1660s and 1674.|$|E
5|$|Ciudad Juárez, {{defended by}} 700 troops, was {{surrounded}} on three sides, {{with the only}} possible exit route for the besieged federales being the northern path into El Paso and the US. Despite {{the fact that the}} revolutionaries had cut <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> supplies into town and the garrison was low on ammunition, its commander, Gen. Juan N. Navarro, refused to surrender, convinced that the inexperience of the rebels in laying sieges would allow him to hold out.|$|E

Normal club racing has fleet starts for the following dinghy classes: Flying Fifteen (keelboat), Laser (dinghy), Solo (dinghy) and Topper (dinghy) {{as well as a}} handicap fleet run under the Portsmouth yardstick scheme. Five slipways enable easy launching. <b>Off</b> <b>the</b> <b>water,</b> the clubhouse facilities include large changing rooms, hot showers, hot food at the weekends, a bar and terrace overlooking the lake. The club caters for disabled people with facilities on both floors and a lift. Royal Yachting Association sailing courses are held at the club for members including race training, youth training, powerboat training, race officer training as well as more informal training run within each fleet.|$|E

5|$|The siege {{began in}} May 1648. The Ottomans spent three months {{investing}} the city, which included cutting <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> supply. Eventually, {{it would last}} until 1669, the second longest siege in history after the Siege of Ceuta (1694-1727) by the Moors under Moulay Ismail. The Ottoman besiegers were adversely affected by the bad supply situation caused by {{the activity of the}} Christian fleets in the Aegean, who intercepted Ottoman convoys carrying supplies and reinforcements to the island. In addition, the overall Ottoman war effort was severely hampered by increased domestic instability caused by Sultan Ibrahim's erratic policies and his summary execution of leading state officials. It ultimately led to his deposition in favor of his son Mehmed IV, ushering in a further period of confusion within the Ottoman government.|$|E
5|$|The {{track and}} field venue opened in 1973, with a {{capacity}} for 6,000 people. The following year Lillehammer IF moved from Sportsplassen i Lillehammer to Stampesletta, with the old venue being retired in 1975. In 1977, Stampesletta hosted the Norwegian Athletics Championships. It {{was the last time}} the championships were held on gravel, and this caused problems because excessive rain drowned the venue, and the fire department had to pump <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b> The club started planning fixed surface on the venue in 1980, and was granted a loan for NOK500,000. On 18 August 1981, the municipal council voted to grant NOK200,000 for the upgrade. The work was largely done with voluntary work, and the new surface was inaugurated on 28 August 1982 with the Norwegian Relay Athletics Championship.|$|E
5|$|While campaigning against Venetian forces, Skanderbeg {{managed to}} inflict a serious defeat on July 23, 1448, seriously {{weakening}} Venetian power in Albania. The siege of Svetigrad continued, however, and Marin Barleti {{writes that the}} Ottomans bribed a soldier to throw a dead dog into {{the well of the}} fortress, forcing the garrison to refuse to drink out of it. It is more likely, however, that the Ottomans had cut <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> supply and induced the garrison to surrender. Given the circumstance, Perlati promised a surrender if the garrison were allowed a safe passage through the Ottoman lines. Prince Mehmed suggested that the garrison should be promised safe passage and then massacred, but Murad rejected his son's proposal, in fear that the rebellion would only be intensified through such an act; he decided to instead return the garrisoning force to Skanderbeg. On July 31, 1448 the garrison of Svetigrad surrendered.|$|E

5|$|Diffusion {{of carbon}} dioxide and oxygen is {{approximately}} 10,000 times slower in water than in air. When soils are flooded, they quickly lose oxygen, becoming hypoxic (an environment with O2 concentration below 2mg/liter) and eventually completely anoxic where anaerobic bacteria thrive among the roots. Water also influences the intensity and spectral composition of light as it reflects <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> surface and submerged particles. Aquatic plants exhibit a wide variety of morphological and physiological adaptations that allow them to survive, compete, and diversify in these environments. For example, their roots and stems contain large air spaces (aerenchyma) that regulate the efficient transportation of gases (for example, CO2 and O2) used in respiration and photosynthesis. Salt water plants (halophytes) have additional specialized adaptations, such as the development of special organs for shedding salt and osmoregulating their internal salt (NaCl) concentrations, to live in estuarine, brackish, or oceanic environments. Anaerobic soil microorganisms in aquatic environments use nitrate, manganese ions, ferric ions, sulfate, carbon dioxide, and some organic compounds; other microorganisms are facultative anaerobes and use oxygen during respiration when the soil becomes drier. The activity of soil microorganisms and the chemistry of the water reduces the oxidation-reduction potentials of the water. Carbon dioxide, for example, is reduced to methane (CH4) by methanogenic bacteria. The physiology of fish is also specially adapted to compensate for environmental salt levels through osmoregulation. Their gills form electrochemical gradients that mediate salt excretion in salt water and uptake in fresh water.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} confront the Turgesh, Ashras {{assembled}} the forces of Khurasan, and led them to Amul on the Oxus River. A vanguard under Qatan, son of Qutayba ibn Muslim, was sent over the river and established a fortified camp, but {{with the arrival of}} the combined native Soghdian and Turgesh armies, the bulk of the Arab force was unable to cross for three months. During this period Qatan's force was beleaguered by the Turgesh, who at the same time crossed the Oxus in small raiding parties. Ashras gave command of his cavalry to Thabit Qutnah, who managed to rout the raiders and drive them to Amul. There the Arabs defeated the Turgesh, although a decisive victory eluded them as Turgesh reinforcements crossed the river and allowed the raiders to escape to safety back over the Oxus. At length Ashras got his forces across, linked up with Qatan ibn Qutayba, and began to advance on Bukhara. The Arabs beat off attacks to reach the trading town of , some five farsakhs—roughly —south of Bukhara itself and outside the oasis that surrounded the latter. After the Arab army encamped at Baykand, the Turgesh and Soghdians cut <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> supply from the oasis.|$|E
