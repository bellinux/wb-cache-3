5|$|During the 18th century Jacobite Risings, <b>Orkney</b> {{was largely}} Jacobite in its sympathies. At {{the end of}} the 1715 rebellion, a large number of Jacobites who had fled north from {{mainland}} Scotland sought refuge on <b>Orkney</b> and were helped on to safety in Sweden. In 1745, the Jacobite lairds on the islands ensured that <b>Orkney</b> remained pro-Jacobite in outlook, and was a safe place to land supplies from Spain to aid their cause. <b>Orkney</b> was the last place in the British Isles that held out for the Jacobites and was not retaken by the British Government until 24 May 1746, over a month after the defeat of the main Jacobite army at Culloden.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{prominent}} characters of the Orkneyinga saga is the Viking chieftain Sveinn Ásleifarson, who lived on the island of Gairsay, in <b>Orkney.</b> The saga relates how Sveinn's father, Óláfr Hrólfsson, was one of several chieftains who supported Páll Hákonsson, Earl of <b>Orkney,</b> in a victorious sea battle against a fleet led by Ölvir Rósta in support of Rögnvaldr Kolsson, who had been appointed the earl of half of <b>Orkney</b> by the King of Norway. Óláfr was later burned to death inside his own house by Ölvir, the grandson of Frakökk, an ambitious woman, portrayed as a villain in the saga. Frakökk attempted to win the Earldom of <b>Orkney</b> for her descendantsparticularly Ölvir.|$|E
5|$|<b>Orkney</b> has {{significant}} wind and marine energy resources, {{and renewable energy}} has recently come into prominence. Although <b>Orkney</b> {{is connected to the}} mainland, it generates over 100% of its net power from renewables. This comes mainly from wind turbines situated right across <b>Orkney.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} known garden {{buildings at}} Cliveden were both designed by Giacomo Leoni for Lord Orkney; the Blenheim Pavilion (c.1727) {{was built to}} commemorate <b>Orkney's</b> victory as a general at the Battle of Blenheim.|$|R

5|$|Prehistoric <b>Orkney</b> {{refers to}} a period in the human {{occupation}} of the <b>Orkney</b> archipelago of Scotland that was {{the latter part of}} these islands' prehistory. The period of prehistory prior to occupation by the genus Homo is part of the geology of Scotland. Although some written records refer to <b>Orkney</b> during the Roman invasions of Scotland, prehistory in northern Scotland does not end until the commencement of the Early Historic Period around AD 600.|$|E
5|$|After Harald {{returned}} to <b>Orkney</b> and Rognvald departed on his expedition, King Eystein Haraldsson, eldest brother of Ingi, undertook a raiding expedition from Norway against the Earldom of <b>Orkney.</b> During this operation he encountered Harald near Thurso and captured him. Harald was freed {{in return for}} a ransom in gold and by giving his oath to Eystein. Eystein then went on to raid the coasts of Scotland and England.|$|E
5|$|Both <b>Orkney</b> and Shetland saw a {{significant}} influx of Norwegian settlers {{during the late}} 8th and early 9th centuries. Vikings made the islands the headquarters of their pirate expeditions carried out against Norway and the coasts of mainland Scotland. In response, Norwegian king Harald Fairhair (Harald Hårfagre) annexed the Northern Isles, comprising <b>Orkney</b> and Shetland, in 875. (It is clear that this story, which appears in the Orkneyinga Saga, {{is based on the}} later voyages of Magnus Barelegs and some scholars believe it to be apocryphal.) Rognvald Eysteinsson received <b>Orkney</b> and Shetland from Harald as an earldom as reparation for the death of his son in battle in Scotland, and then passed the earldom on to his brother Sigurd the Mighty.|$|E

25|$|The <b>Orkneying</b> saga {{does not}} speak at all of Nór's descendants, but {{introduces}} instead a figure named Halfdan the Old {{as the son of}} Sveidi (Sveiði) the Sea-king, who is called Svadi (Svaði) in the Ættartolur. Sveidi/Svadi in both texts was son of Heiti, son of Gór who was Nór's brother.|$|R
5|$|By {{the end of}} the {{eleventh}} century the Norwegian crown had come to accept that Caithness was held by the Earls of <b>Orkney</b> as a fiefdom from the Kings of Scotland although its Norse character was retained throughout the thirteenth century. Raghnall mac Gofraidh was granted Caithness after assisting the Scots king in a conflict with Harald Maddadson, an earl of <b>Orkney</b> in the early thirteenth century.|$|E
5|$|For a {{brief period}} <b>Orkney</b> emerged from {{prehistory}} and into protohistory. The Greek explorer Pytheas visited Britain sometime between 322 and 285 BC and may have circumnavigated the mainland. In his On the Ocean he refers to the most northerly point as Orcas, conceivably a reference to <b>Orkney.</b>|$|E

25|$|Seventy-five {{per cent}} of <b>Orkney's</b> {{population}} {{live on the}} island, which is more densely populated than the other islands of the archipelago. The lengthy history of the island's occupation has provided numerous important archaeological sites and the sandstone bedrock provides a platform for fertile farmland. There is an abundance of wildlife, especially seabirds.|$|R
50|$|Sweyn {{was born}} in Caithness in the early twelfth century, to Olaf Hrolfsson and his wife Åsleik. According to the Orkneyinga Saga, he came to {{prominence}} when he murdered Earl Paul of <b>Orkney's</b> cup-bearer c. 1134 in a quarrel over a drinking game, and fled to Tiree to take refuge with Holdbodi Hundason.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the representation of mounds and standing stones in <b>Orkney's</b> folklore, and how this can inform us about potential Norse perceptions of sites and the landscape. The Orcadian folkloric record is examined under consideration of wider parallels, whilst case studies are considered individually as well as within their wider landscape setting...|$|R
5|$|However {{there are}} also two {{separate}} constituencies that elect one Member of the Scottish Parliament each for <b>Orkney</b> and Shetland by the first past the post system. <b>Orkney</b> and Shetland also have separate local Councils which are dominated by independents, that is they are not members of a political party.|$|E
5|$|In 1150, {{it looked}} like Caithness and the whole earldom of <b>Orkney</b> {{were going to come}} under {{permanent}} Scottish control. However, David's plans for the north soon began to encounter problems. In 1151, King Eystein II of Norway put a spanner in the works by sailing through the waterways of <b>Orkney</b> with a large fleet and catching the young Harald unaware in his residence at Thurso. Eystein forced Harald to pay fealty as a condition of his release. Later in the year David hastily responded by supporting the claims to the <b>Orkney</b> earldom of Harald's rival Erlend Haraldsson, granting him half of Caithness in opposition to Harald. King Eystein responded in turn by making a similar grant to this same Erlend, cancelling the effect of David's grant. David's weakness in <b>Orkney</b> was that the Norwegian kings were not prepared to stand back and let him reduce their power.|$|E
5|$|In the Northern Isles, James's cousin Patrick Stewart, Earl of <b>Orkney,</b> {{resisted}} the Statutes of Iona and was consequently imprisoned. His natural son Robert led an unsuccessful rebellion against James, and the Earl {{and his son}} were hanged.

Lin's struggle reminds Dafydd, and all of <b>Orkney's</b> slaves, of their humanity. Dafydd becomes determined to keep his hero, his sister, alive.|$|R
60|$|Although the French still strove gallantly, {{the battle}} was now {{virtually}} over. The centre was pierced, the right turned, and Boufflers prepared to cover the necessary retreat with his cavalry.

5|$|In {{the early}} Iron Age, from {{the seventh century}} BCE, {{cellular}} houses begin to be replaced on the northern isles by simple Atlantic roundhouses, substantial circular buildings with a drystone construction. Important examples are at Quanterness, Bu, Pierowall, and Tofts Ness on <b>Orkney,</b> and at Clickhimin on Shetland.
