For example, liberal newspapers such as Asahi Shimbun and Mainichi Shimbun often feature articles critical <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flag</b> of Japan, reflecting their readerships' political spectrum. To other Japanese, the flag represents the time where democracy was suppressed when Japan was an empire.|$|E

5|$|The {{flag of the}} Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic {{was adopted}} by decree on December 25, 1951. The flag was {{slightly}} modified in 1956 when construction details were added for the red star, and golden hammer and sickle. The final specifications <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flag</b> was set in Article 120 of the Constitution of the Byelorussian SSR and {{are very similar to}} the current Belarusian flag. The flag had a length-to-width ratio of one to two (1:2), just like the flag of the Soviet Union (and the other fourteen union republics). The main portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flag</b> was red (representing the Revolution), with the rest being green (representing the Belarusian forests). A pattern of white drawn on red decorated the hoist portion of the flag; this design is often used on Belarusian traditional costumes. In the upper corner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flag,</b> in the red portion, a gold hammer and sickle was added, with a red star outlined in gold above it. The hammer represented the worker, and the sickle the peasant; according to Soviet ideology, these two symbols crossed together symbolized co-operation between the two classes. The red star, a symbol commonly used by Communist parties, was said to stand either for the five social groups (workers, youth, peasants, military, and academics), the five known continents, or the five fingers of the worker's hand. The hammer, sickle and star were sometimes not displayed on the reverse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flag.</b> The purpose for this design was that the Byelorussian SSR, along with the Soviet Union and the Ukrainian SSR, were admitted to the United Nations in 1945 as founding members and needed distinct flags for each other. The designer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flag</b> was Milkahil Gusyev.|$|E
5|$|The {{national}} flag of Ecuador, {{which consists of}} horizontal bands of yellow (double width), blue and red, was first adopted by law in 1835 and later on 26 September 1860. The design of the current flag was finalized in 1900 {{with the addition of}} the coat of arms in the center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flag.</b> Before using the yellow, blue and red tricolor, Ecuador used white and blue flags that contained stars for each province of the country. The design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flag</b> is very similar to those of Colombia and Venezuela, which are also former constituent territories of Gran Colombia. All three are based on a proposal by Venezuelan General Francisco de Miranda, which was adopted by Venezuela in 1811 and later Gran Colombia with some modifications. There is a variant <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flag</b> that does not contain the coat of arms that is used by the merchant marine. This flag matches Colombia's in every aspect, but Colombia uses a different design when her merchant marine ships are at sail.|$|E

The British parliament discussed public use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flag,</b> and based on directives from England, the British Indian government threatened to withdraw funds from municipalities and local governments that did not prevent the display of the Swaraj flag. The Swaraj flag became the official flag of Congress at the 1931 meeting. However, by then, the flag had already become the symbol of the independence movement.|$|E
