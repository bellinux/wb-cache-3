5000|$|<b>Oxamyl</b> is a {{carbamate}} pesticide. [...] According to the WHO Food and Agriculture Organization, [...] "Oxamyl is a colourless crystalline solid with {{a melting}} point of 100-102 °C changing to a dimorphic form with a melting point of 108-110 °C. It {{has a slightly}} sulfurous odour. <b>Oxamyl</b> is non-corrosive. It has a specific gravity of 0.97 (25°/4°)." ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Oxamyl</b> is a {{chemical}} {{used as a}} pesticide that comes in two forms: granulated and liquid. The granulated form has been banned in the United States. It is commonly sold under the trade name Vydate.|$|E
50|$|Chemical {{control has}} shown {{some success in}} {{reducing}} S. bradys population. Four granular nematicides (aldicarb, <b>oxamyl,</b> carbofuran and miral) applied as post-plant sidedressing treatments effectively reduced the nematode population {{during the growing season}} and significantly increased yield without toxic accumulation in the harvested tubers.|$|E
5000|$|According to the United Nations Environment Programme, [...] "This {{product is}} {{efficient}} in controlling most nematode species {{in addition to}} a large number of sucking and chewing insects such as aphids and thrips." [...] <b>Oxamyl</b> is extremely toxic to humans whether ingested, inhaled, or contact with the skin. Its overuse can also lead to residue accumulation in food, though its chemical composition—once coming into contact with the soil—rapidly degrades. Signs of <b>Oxamyl</b> poisoning include: Malaise, muscle weakness, dizziness, sweating, Headache, salivation, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, Miosis with blurred vision, incoordination, muscle twitching and slurred speech—though symptoms can worsen with severe poisoning. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization, [...] "Contact with the skin, inhalation of dust or spray, or swallowing may be fatal." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{so-called}} {{carbamate insecticides}} feature the carbamate ester functional group. Included {{in this group}} are aldicarb (Temik), carbofuran (Furadan), carbaryl (Sevin), ethienocarb, fenobucarb, <b>oxamyl,</b> and methomyl. These insecticides kill insects by reversibly inactivating the enzyme acetylcholinesterase. The organophosphate pesticides also inhibit this enzyme, although irreversibly, and cause a more severe form of cholinergic poisoning.|$|E
50|$|Tobacco Rattle Virus can {{be managed}} {{through a variety of}} methods {{designed}} to make the environment unsuitable for transmission and viral propagation. Tubers or seeds of any susceptible plants should be purchased only from sellers certified as clean, and never planted in fields with a history of corky ringspot or Tobacco Rattle Virus-related disease. Many US states and several other countries run seed certification programs, for potatoes in particular. While its use requires a permit from many state or local governments, the nematicide 1,3-dichloropropene may be employed against fields overrun by stubby root nematodes, a common vector of the virus. Soil fumigants generally fail to penetrate the 40 inches necessary to ensure nematode eradication, and carmabates such as aldicarb and <b>oxamyl</b> are recommended as a last resort. Tobacco Rattle Virus is only found in nature in association with stubby root nematodes of genera Trichodorus and Paratrichodorus. Although otherwise considered harmless, they spread the infection during feedings. Nematodes may live and multiply within weeds in the field in between crop rotations, and it is advisable to employ non-host plants, such as alfalfa, to compete against weeds that may otherwise harbor the viral vector. In contrast, nightshade is a very problematic weed as it is an ideal host for the virus and the nematode. Growers can reduce symptom development by planting early and harvesting early. While the Russet Burbank cultivar proves to be highly susceptible to Tobacco Rattle Virus corky ringspot, Merrimack and several old European varieties exhibit resistance. Too much soil moisture can encourage nematode overpopulation, but tightly packed fine soil, clay, or sand can drastically inhibit the vector movement responsible for widespread and erratic field decimations. Once a plant is infected it cannot be treated and should be burned or disposed of as biohazard waste.|$|E
40|$|A high {{performance}} liquid chromatographic method employing two columns connected in series and separated~y·a. switching valve {{has been developed}} {{for the analysis of}} the insecticide/ nematicide <b>oxamyl</b> (methyl-N',N'-dimethyl-N-[(methylcarbamoyl) oxy]-l-thiooxarnimidate) and two of its metabolites. A variation of this method involving two reverse phase columns was employed to monitor the persistence and translocation of <b>oxamyl</b> in treated peach seedlings. It was possible to simultaneously analyse for <b>oxamyl</b> and its corresponding oxime (methyl-N',N'-dimethyl-N-hydroxy-l-thiooxamimidate}, a major metabolite of <b>oxamyl</b> in plants, without prior cleanup of the samples. The method allowed detection of 0. 058 pg <b>oxamyl</b> and 0. 035 p. g oxime. On treated peach leaves <b>oxamyl</b> was found to dissipate rapidly during the first two-week period, followed by a period of slow decomposition. Movement of <b>oxamyl</b> or its oxime did not occur in detectable quantities to untreated leaves or to the root or soil. A second variation of the method which employed a size exclusion column as·the first column and a reverse phase column as the second was used to monitor the degradation of <b>oxamyl</b> in treated, planted corn seeds and was suitable for simultaneous analysis of <b>oxamyl,</b> its oxime and dimethylcyanoformamide (DMCF), a metabolite of <b>oxamyl.</b> The method allowed detection of 0. 02 pg <b>oxamyl,</b> 0. 02 p. g oxime and 0. 005 pg DMCF. <b>Oxamyl</b> was found to persist for a period of 5 - 6 weeks, which is long enough to permit <b>oxamyl</b> seedtreatment to be considered as a potential means of protecting young corn plants from nematode attack. Decomposition was found to be more rapid in unsterilized soil than in sterililized soil.

Between 2002 and 2005, fields with a history of CRS were planted to potato and treated with various combinations of in-furrow (IF) and chemigated (water run, WR) <b>oxamyl</b> [Methyl N'N'-dimethyl-N-[(methyl carbamoyl) oxy]- 1 -thiooxamimidate] applications. Soil samples were collected to determine how Paratrichodorus allius populations responded to the various treatment regimes (2002 - 2004); potato tubers were evaluated for symptoms of CRS in 2004 - 2005. Applications of <b>oxamyl</b> to potato (1. 1 kg a. i. /ha) did not cause significant mortality of P. allius but did prevent the populations from increasing. <b>Oxamyl</b> applications that began at 55 days after planting (DAP) or later did not control CRS and were not different from the untreated control. However, application schedules that began early-season, either IF at planting, early WR (33 – 41 DAP), or both, significantly reduced CRS expression in cv. Yukon Gold. Therefore, <b>oxamyl</b> applications must be made early in the growing season to be effective in controlling CRS. Effects of <b>oxamyl</b> on CRS may be due to nematostatic action that suppresses feeding activity during early field season when most virus transmission probably occurs...|$|E
40|$|In {{the first}} 2 {{years of a}} 3 -year (1987 - 89) microplot study, aqueous {{solutions}} of <b>oxamyl</b> (32 mg/ml) were applied to cut potato (Solanum tuberosum cv. Russet Burbank) tubers, grown in fine sandy loam infested with Pratylenchus penetrans. The seed-piece treatment alone and the seed-piece treatment followed by three foliar sprays generally reduced (P = 0. 05) population densities of P. penetrans in the soil at midseason and in the soil and roots at harvest, compared to the control. In 1989, all seed pieces treated with <b>oxamyl</b> at 96 mg/ml or at 32, 64, and 96 mg/ml followed by a polymer sticker : water (1 : 4) dip failed to emerge. Only <b>oxamyl</b> at 64 mg/ml reduced (P = 0. 05) midseason soil population densities of P. penetrans. A pre-plant soil treatment with 1, 3 -D reduced (P = 0. 05) numbers of P. penetrans at planting each year and increased (P = 0. 05) tuber yields in 1988 and 1989 compared to the control. In 1989, tuber yields from the sticker treatment and the <b>oxamyl</b> seed-piece treatment at 64 mg/ml were lower (P = 0. 05) {{than those in the}} 1, 3 -D treatment and similar to those from the untreated control, possibly because of phytotoxicity. <b>Oxamyl</b> treatment of potato seed pieces to control P. penetrans does not appear practical for field production...|$|E
40|$|In 2012, theWashington {{raspberry}} (Rubus idaeus) industry {{received a}} special local needs (SLN) 24 (c) label to apply Vydate L (active ingredient <b>oxamyl)</b> to nonbearing raspberry {{for the management}} of Pratylenchus penetrans. This is a new use pattern of this nematicide for raspberry growers; therefore, research was conducted to identify the optimum spring application timing of <b>oxamyl</b> for the suppression of P. penetrans. Three on-farm trials in each of 2012 and 2013 were established in Washington in newly planted raspberry trials on a range of varieties. <b>Oxamyl</b> was applied twice in April (2013 only), May, and June, and these treatments were compared to each other as well as a nontreated control. Population densities of P. penetrans were determined in the fall and spring postoxamyl applications for at least 1. 5 years. Plant vigor was also evaluated in the trials. Combined results from 2012 and 2013 trials indicated that application timing in the spring was not critical. <b>Oxamyl</b> application reduced root P. penetrans population densities in all six trials. Reductions in P. penetrans population densities in roots of oxamyl-treated plants, regardless of application timing, ranged from 62 % to 99 % of densities in nontreated controls. Phytotoxicity to newly planted raspberry was never observed in any of the trials. A nonbearing application of <b>oxamyl</b> is an important addition to current control methods used to manage P. penetrans in raspberry in Washington...|$|E

Five foliar applications of 1. 12 kg a. i. /ha of <b>oxamyl</b> or carbofuran at 10 -day intervals beginning when 90 % of the plants had emerged suppressed increase in G. rostochiensis densities. Similar foliar applications of phenamiphos were ineffective in controlling G. rostochiensis. Soil applications (in the row at planting) of aldicarb, carbofuran, phenamiphos, ethoprop, and <b>oxamyl</b> at 5. 6 kg a. i. /ha reduced the numbers of white females that developed on potato roots, but only those treatments involving aldicarb and <b>oxamyl</b> suppressed G. rostochiensis population increase. Combined soil and foliar treatments did not provide any advantage over soil treatment alone, as soil applications of 5. 6 kg a. i. /ha alone were equal to, or better than, combined soil (3. 4 kg a. i. /ha) and foliar (2. 2 kg a. i. /ha) applications in controlling G. rostochiensis...|$|E
40|$|Synthetic nematicides such as <b>oxamyl</b> and {{carbofuran}} play significant {{roles in}} the management of plant-parasitic nematodes. However, their negative environmental impacts have it imperative to search for safer alternatives. As part of our contribution in the search for bio-nematicides, compounds from plant extract were screened for possible potent nematicidal agent. A new isochromane carboxylic acid glycoside, isolated from the leaves of Kigelia pinnata (Lam.) Benth (Bignoniaceae) was evaluated for its nematicidal activity. The structure of the proposed compound was characterized by various spectroscopic methods, which included UV, FTIR, 1 D-, and 2 D-NMR, FAB-MS, TOF-ESI-MS and TOF-ESI-MS/MS (TANDEM). The in vitro experiment conducted on the glycoside against Meloidogyne incognita juveniles and eggs indicated an induced mortality. Its activity can be compared favourably with <b>oxamyl,</b> when tested at 0. 1 mg/mL concentration. At four hours of observation, no significant difference (P <  0. 05) between <b>oxamyl</b> and the glycoside was observed. The present data sustains that natural glycoside is a promising <b>oxamyl</b> alternate for controlling nematode-induced plant root knots and may contribute to integrated pest management. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{northern}} root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne hapla) {{is a major}} pathogen {{of processing}} carrot in New York, significantly reducing marketable yield and profitability. Severely infected carrots are stubby, galled and forked and therefore unmarketable. In field microplot trials in 1996 and 1998, the incidence and severity of root-galling increased and the marketable yield of carrot decreased as the initial inoculum density of M. hapla was increased from 0 to 8 eggs/cm 3 soil, in mineral or organic soils. The application of <b>oxamyl</b> at planting was effective against M. hapla and its damage to carrots grown in mineral and organic soils. <b>Oxamyl</b> application reduced root-galling severity and increased marketable yield.
