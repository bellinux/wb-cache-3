500|$|Though {{they had}} been asked to put {{together}} a 90-minute TV special, Seinfeld and David wrote a TV pilot as they felt their [...] "show about nothing" [...] concept would fit better in a shorter format. The storyline, and the main characters, were inspired by real-life events and people. Though the NBC executives were unsure about the show, they, as Warren Littlefield would later state, [...] "all said, ah what the hell, let's try a pilot <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> and see what happens". The test audiences, however, reacted extremely negatively. Although NBC would still broadcast the episode to see how audiences and TV critics would react, the network had already decided not to pick up the show, {{as a result of the}} test-results.|$|E
500|$|David and Seinfeld re-wrote {{the script}} {{several times before}} {{submitting}} it to the network, dropping and adding various elements. Originally George, who was called Bennett in early drafts, was a comedian as well, and the first scene of the episode focussed on Jerry and George discussing their stand-up material. The character of Kramer, {{was not included in}} the first draft of the script, and in another draft he was called [...] "Hoffman". Another element that was added was Kessler's dog, since it was originally planned that Jerry's stand-up routines would match the events of each episode. Though the stand-up routine about dogs was eventually dropped, the scene in which Kessler enters with his dog remained in the episode. When David and Seinfeld eventually submitted the script, the network executives were unsure whether or not to produce the pilot, but as NBC executive Warren Littlefield would later state [...] "we all said, ah what the hell, let's try a pilot <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> and see what happens".|$|E
2500|$|Bernard Hammermeister, another {{longtime}} friend, said he {{was shown}} an ape suit in Heironimus' car. [...] No date was given by Long for Hammermeister's observation, but it apparently came well after the relatives' observation, as implied by the word [...] "still" [...] in the justification Heironimus gave Hammermeister for requesting his silence: [...] "There was still {{supposed to be a}} payola <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing,</b> and he didn't have it." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Mercieca, he {{had last}} seen Foley at a dinner meeting 18 years before, in a {{restaurant}} in Fort Worth. When asked whether he had {{anything to say to}} Foley, Mercieca said, [...] "Remember the good times we had together, you know, and how well we enjoyed each other's company." [...] He added, [...] "Don’t keep dwelling <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing,</b> you know?" [...] Mercieca could not be prosecuted for his activities with Foley because the relevant statutes of limitations had expired, and the Palm Beach County state attorney's office [...] "cannot conduct an investigation because Foley has declined to press charges." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Campbell's book Pathways to Bliss, Campbell {{recalls his}} {{reaction}} to the similarities he noted between Wilder's play and Joyce's novel:hen I went to see Thornton Wilder's The Skin of Our Teeth, which was the big Broadway hit at the time...all I heard was Finnegans Wake. [...] I phoned Robinson, and I said, [...] "Good God, here's Wilder making tons of money {{and a lot of}} fame <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing,</b> and it's simply Finnegans Wake." [...] Joyce had just died, and his family was destitute. So I said, [...] "I think we should write a letter to the New York Times." ...|$|E

2500|$|On November 21, 2008, Rudolph, who {{had been}} {{involved}} in the documentary, gave an exclusive interview to MTV. He explained how development of the project started and who he got involved with it: [...] "I was very involved in putting [...] together, so I saw the process, It was a very interesting process. We made a deal from the very beginning — everybody sort of shook hands with the understanding that there were going to be no boundaries <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing.</b> We were going to make an open and honest film and that we weren't going to leave the good stuff on the cutting room floor." [...] Rudolph explained that For the Record is part of the game plan for reintroducing Spears back to her fans as a pop star rather than a tabloid fixture.|$|E
2500|$|The {{genesis of}} [...] "In the Midnight Hour" [...] was a {{recording}} session on May 12, 1965, at which Wexler {{worked out a}} powerful rhythm track with studio musicians Steve Cropper and Al Jackson of the Stax Records house band, including bassist Donald [...] "Duck" [...] Dunn. (Stax keyboard player Booker T. Jones, who usually played with Dunn, Cropper and Jackson as Booker T. & the M.G.'s, did not play on the studio sessions with Pickett.) Wexler said to Cropper and Jackson, [...] "Why don't you pick up <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> here?" [...] He performed a dance step. Cropper explained {{in an interview that}} Wexler told them that [...] "this was the way the kids were dancing; they were putting the accent on two. Basically, we'd been one-beat-accenters with an afterbeat; it was like 'boom dah,' but here was a thing that went 'um-chaw,' just the reverse as far as the accent goes." ...|$|E

I {{had this}} Gretsch Country Gentleman and I started jamming <b>on</b> <b>this</b> little <b>thing</b> in D (sings riff); the riff {{just came out of}} that. Stone came up with his weird part. There are all these strange, disjointed parts that kind of turned into a song.
