Production started in 1980 {{with the use of}} components from both the BMP-1 and BMP-2. Fifty IRMs were produced from 1986. However, the suspension had a new hull, one extra road wheel and one additional hydraulic shock-absorber. It has four pressurized compartments, with the engine located at the rear. There are three hatches {{on the top of the}} hull and one emergency hatch in the bottom. The IRM is equipped with two retractable propellers in ring covers for swimming and steering and two cases with 16 9M39 solid engines (each has a thrust of 312 kg and weighs 6.3 kg), for getting out of mud. Special reconnaissance equipment consists of two R-147 radios; one PIR-451 periscope; TNPO-160, TNP-370 and TNV-25M periscopic observation devices; an AGI-1s horizon indicator; a DSP-30 portable periscopic rangefinder, a PAB-2M portable aiming circle, one TNA-3 gyroscopic navigational device, an EIR echo depth finder with automatic recorder and three sonar transducers, a RShM-2 river-type wide-span mine detector, RVM-2M and IMP-2 portable mine detectors, a PR-1 portable penetrometer used to analyze soil for crossability and an ice drill with ice stake. The vehicle has two arms for detecting metallic mines which are mounted on the front of the hull. They can be retracted when not in use. The mine detector arms can be hydraulically articulated to their <b>operating</b> <b>position</b> <b>in</b> under three minutes. The mine detector brings the vehicle to a full stop upon encountering an obstacle or detecting a metallic object. The PIR-451 periscope is mounted on the right hand side of the front of the vehicle, at the commander's station. It can be extended to 1.5 m and can move vertically up to 750 mm. The IRM also has an air revitalization system, automatic fire extinguishers, a water pump with a capacity of 1,000 l/min, an automatic NBC protection system and an engine thermal smoke generator. It weighs 17.2 tonnes and has a crew of six. It is 8.22 m long, 3.15 m wide and 2.40 m high. Ground clearance is 420 mm. It has a maximum road speed of 52 km/h and it can swim at up to 12 km/h. It is armed with a PKT machine gun fitted in a small turret for which it carries 1,000 rounds. In the west, the IRM was believed to be based on the 2S1 Gvozdika self-propelled howitzer until 1986 when its true origins became known.|$|E

40|$|Multi-pantograph {{operation}} is a convenient and {{efficient way to}} operate railway rolling stock, but the influence between the pantographs makes the system more sensitive and vulnerable than a single-pantograph system. When a train passes through special sections or in an emergency condition, {{it is necessary to}} lower one or all of the pantographs and then raise them up again. In these circumstances, the motion of the pantographs can introduce a sudden impact to the catenary that may change the pantograph configuration, then disrupting the dynamic stability. To address the dynamic performance during pantograph raising and lowering, a numerical study on multi-pantograph {{operation is}} carried out with help of a 3 D pantograph-catenary finite element (FE) model under the conditions: up to three pantographs, various pantograph raising/lowering orders and different operating positions in a span. The results show that the leading pantograph is little influenced by the raising and lowering movement of any pantograph behind it. However, any trailing pantograph is significantly affected by any operation taking place ahead of it. The dynamic performance of the system depends on the pantograph spacing distance and the operational speed, but is little affected by the <b>operating</b> <b>position</b> <b>in</b> a span. To study auxiliary-pantograph operation where the leading pantograph works as an auxiliary pantograph, this paper shows how an optimal setting of the leading pantograph benefits the trailing pantograph and suggests specifying the speed where the leading pantograph gets into or out of service to avoid disruption.

Low beams (called [...] "dipped beams" [...] or [...] "passing beams" [...] in some countries) have stricter control of upward light, and direct most of their light downward and either rightward (in right-traffic countries) or leftward (in left-traffic countries), to provide safe forward visibility without excessive glare or backdazzle.|$|R

40|$|Models {{proposed}} {{to account for}} reference frame effects in spatial cognition often account for performance in some tasks well, but fail to generalize to other tasks. Here, we demonstrate that a new process account of spatial working memory-the dynamic field theory (DFT) -can {{bridge the gap between}} perceptual and memory processes <b>in</b> <b>position</b> discrimination and spatial recall, highlighting that the processes underlying spatial recall also <b>operate</b> <b>in</b> <b>position</b> discrimination. <b>In</b> six experiments, we tested two novel predictions of the DFT: first, that discrimination is enhanced near symmetry axes, especially when the perceptual salience of the axis is increased: and second, that performance far from a reference axis depends on the direction in which the second stimulus is presented. The DFT also predicts the magnitude of this direction-dependent modulation. These effects arise from reference-related inhibition in the theory. We discuss how the processes captured by the DFT relate to existing psychophysical models and operate across a diverse array of spatial tasks. Copyright 2006 Psychonomic Society, Inc...|$|R
40|$|Background and Objectives: A major {{stumbling}} block {{to teaching and}} learning the finer skills of laparoscopy {{is related to the}} "optical illusions " the video camera plays on the surgeon's eyes. Until now, the belief was that lack of coordination was the result of depth perception deficiencies resulting from the two dimensional plane of the video monitor. In reality, this is a minor problem that is easily surmounted with practice. A closer analysis of how organ orientation at the operative site compares to the video camera's fields of focus reveals the real problem: the major optical difference between laparotomy and laparoscopy involves rotation of the images received by the brain. Conclusions: There are four major <b>operating</b> <b>positions</b> <b>in</b> laparoscopy: camera <b>position,</b> right camera position, left camera position and opposite camera <b>position.</b> The object <b>in</b> front of the camera has two components; the first, a reality image, which results from light reflected off the object as it exists in time and space. The second, a visual image, which represents the actual light entering our eyes. At right camera position the visual image is a 90 degree counterclockwise rotation of the reality image. At the left camera position the visual image is a 90 degree clockwise rotation of the reality image. At opposite camera position, a 180 degree rotation and complete reversal of the reality image occurs. It is only at camera position that the visual image is equal to the reality image, and we approach a scenario similar to that found in laparotomy. Every other position will be unlike what we were accustomed to in open surgery...|$|R

In this paper, we show how to generate a rotating magnetic field with any desired rotation axis, for magnetic device actuation, at any device <b>position</b> <b>in</b> space using a single rotating-magnet actuator. The methods presented can control untethered rotating magnetic devices, while the rotating actuator magnet fol-lows trajectories independent of the untethered devices themselves. We demonstrate our methods by actuating rotating magnetic de-vices in a lumen. Applications include minimally invasive medical tasks requiring an untethered magnetic device to operate in natu-ral lumen pathways of the body (e. g., the gastrointestinal system, the subarachnoid space of the nervous system, or vasculature).
