5|$|The defence {{argued that}} Sheila was the killer, {{and that she}} did {{know how to handle}} guns, because she had been raised on a farm and had {{attended}} shoots when she was younger. She had a very serious mental illness, had told a psychiatrist she felt capable of killing her children, and the loaded rifle and cartridges had been left <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>table</b> by Bamber. There had been a recent family argument about placing the children in foster care.|$|E
5|$|Bamber {{told the}} court that, during his visit on 6 August, hours before the murders, he had loaded the rifle, {{thinking}} he had heard rabbits outside, but hadn't used it. He had then left it <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>table,</b> with a full magazine {{and a box of}} ammunition, before leaving the house. When he left it in the kitchen, it did not have the silencer or telescopic sight attached, he said; they had been on the rifle in late July according to a nephew, but Bamber said his father must have removed them in the meantime. The prosecution disputed this, maintaining that the silencer was on the rifle when the family was murdered.|$|E
5|$|Bamber {{told the}} police that Sheila was {{familiar}} with guns {{and that they had}} gone target shooting together. He said he had been at the farmhouse himself a few hours earlier, and that he had loaded the rifle because he thought he had heard rabbits outside. He had left it <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>table</b> fully loaded, with a box of ammunition nearby. After the bodies were discovered, a Dr. Craig, was called to the house to certify the deaths, which he testified could have occurred {{at any time during the}} night. He said Bamber appeared to be in a state of shock; Bamber broke down, cried and seemed to vomit. The doctor said Bamber told him about the discussion the family had had about possibly having Sheila's sons placed in foster care.|$|E

60|$|Twenty {{feet from}} the bored Carters was tragedy. Gray-faced, dumb, Father stood by Mother's chair, {{stroking}} her dull hair as she laid her head <b>on</b> <b>the</b> crude <b>kitchen</b> <b>table</b> and sobbed.

25|$|William Stewart Halsted, M.D. (September 23, 1852 – September 7, 1922) was an American {{surgeon who}} {{emphasized}} strict aseptic technique during surgical procedures, {{was an early}} champion of newly discovered anesthetics, and introduced several new operations, including the radical mastectomy for breast cancer. Halsted returned to New York in 1880 {{and for the next}} six years led an extraordinarily vigorous and energetic life. He operated at multiple hospitals, including Roosevelt Hospital, the College of Physicians and Surgeons, Charity Hospital, Emigrant Hospital, Bellevue Hospital and Chambers Street Hospital. He was an extremely popular, inspiring and charismatic teacher. In 1882 he performed one of the first gallbladder operations in the United States (a cholecystotomy performed on his mother <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>table</b> at 2am). Halsted also performed one of the first blood transfusions in the United States. He had been called to see his sister after she had given birth. He found her moribund from blood loss, and in a bold move withdrew his own blood, transfused his blood into his sister, and then operated on her to save her life.|$|E
25|$|At 10:41, {{a second}} caller {{reported}} the incident, and {{was transferred to}} the State Police. At 10:55, Roberts was reaching the final stages of his plan. He had arranged the bound girls {{at the front of the}} classroom, near the chalkboard. Roberts made two cell phone calls, one to his wife and the next to police. He warned the 911 dispatcher that if state police were not off the property in two seconds, he would kill the children. The dispatcher attempted to delay him and put him in touch with the State Police, but Roberts ended the call. Two of the girls then began negotiating with Roberts. They pleaded for him to shoot them first. This allowed the girls a little extra time for possible rescue. At approximately 11:07a.m., Roberts followed through with his threats and the sound of rapid gunfire was heard. At 10:58, Mrs. Roberts called 911 after arriving home from a prayer study group meeting. She had discovered a suicide note left <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>table</b> and had received a brief and disturbing emotional phone call from her husband. The 911 dispatcher put her in touch with State Police.|$|E

5000|$|The couple {{lived as}} pioneers <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sparse Dakota prairie where, as Charles' {{obituary}} notes, [...] "even claim shanties were {{few and far}} between." [...] Charles became an American citizen by appearing at the US District Court in the second district of Dakota Territory before Judge AJ Edgerton on November 14, 1883, where Kostboth [...] "renounced allegiance to the Emperor of Germany sic." [...] While <b>on</b> <b>the</b> homestead, Charles was active in public matters and held township and school offices.

[...] His family endured a cold winter—the warmest place in their shack was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>table,</b> so they kept the baby there—and in the spring their crops were destroyed by hail. [...] As he was unsuccessful at farming, he supplemented his income using the stonemason's skills he had learned from his father: he laid foundations for the Canadian Pacific Railway, worked on the High Level Bridge in Edmonton, and dug Killam's town well. [...] He later worked in real estate and as a farm implement dealer, earning enough to buy a new and larger homestead in 1912.|$|E
500|$|Dotty {{arrives in}} Walford on Christmas Day with Nick, {{to see her}} estranged {{grandmother}} Dot (June Brown). Nick introduces Dot to Dotty and they quickly bond. Nick lies to Dot that he had promised to send money to Sandy {{on the condition that}} she named their daughter Dorothy after her grandmother, so that Dot will trust him and bond with his daughter; Dot does not know Dotty's real name. After spending the night, Dotty begs Dot to let them stay longer. Dot soon discovers that Nick is unemployed and he and Dotty have been living rough. Nick says he will either put Dotty into care or sell her to Dot. After serious consideration, she buys Dotty to get her away from Nick. Dotty learns that Dot has left all her money to Dotty in her will, and tells Nick. They plan to kill Dot to inherit the money, and trick her into thinking she is suffering from dementia. Eventually, Dotty is told by Nick to give Dot an overdose of her medication, but, Dotty has {{had a change of heart}} and gives the pills to Nick in his beer. When Nick learns of Dotty's double-crossing, he drags her to the café and holds everyone inside hostage. [...] Dotty escapes along with most of the others, but the café explodes, and in the commotion, Nick escapes. Dot suspects Dotty may be just as evil as Nick, so plants some tablets <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>table</b> whilst Dotty has her back turned. Dot leaves the room and spies on Dotty, who ignores the tablets.|$|E

Clive invites Daphne Lawrence (Elaine Smith) to move into his spare room when her engagement to Des Clarke (Paul Keane) falls apart. They are briefly joined there by Daphne's best friend, Zoe Davis (Ally Fowler) and then by Mike Young (Guy Pearce). As well as running his gorillagram business, Clive teamed up with Shane Ramsay (Peter O'Brien) to form a gardening business called Ramsay and Gibbons Gardening Service or RAGGS.

Clive performs a Tracheotomy <b>on</b> Lucy <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Robinson's <b>kitchen</b> <b>table</b> and saves her life. Clive tells his neighbours that he is a doctor, but he quit medicine when he made a mistake, which led to the death of his girlfriend, Linda.|$|R
5000|$|The {{boom in the}} {{underground}} press was made practical by the availability of cheap offset printing, which {{made it possible to}} print a few thousand copies of a small tabloid paper for a couple of hundred dollars, which a sympathetic printer might extend on credit. Paper was cheap, and many printing firms around the country had over-expanded during the 1950s and had excess capacity on their offset web presses, which could be negotiated for at bargain rates. [...] Most papers operated on a shoestring budget, pasting up camera-ready copy on layout sheets <b>on</b> <b>the</b> editor's <b>kitchen</b> <b>table,</b> with labor performed by unpaid, non-union volunteers. Typesetting costs, which at the time were wiping out many established big city papers, were avoided by typing up copy on a rented or borrowed IBM Selectric typewriter to be pasted up by hand. As one observer commented with only slight hyperbole, students were financing the publication of these papers out of their lunch money.|$|R

5|$|In November 2007, Vincent runs a {{blood test}} on himself after {{experiencing}} {{what appears to be}} symptoms of morning sickness and discovers he is pregnant. Eve inspects Vincent (who is dressed as Valerie) on November 22, 2007 and discovers his pregnancy and his true gender identity as intersex. Vincent torments Eve out of revenge for her failure to prevent his abduction when he was born and to prevent her from telling anyone that he was still alive and pregnant with Julian's child. After his psychopathic accomplice Viki Chatsworth severs Julian's penis, Vincent plies Eve with drugs and alcohol so she botches her attempt to surgically reattach Julian's penis; she reattaches it upside-down, and an erection might kill him. In May 2008, Eve and Julian assist Vincent with the birth of his son <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Russells' <b>kitchen</b> <b>table</b> after Eve explains everything about Vincent and Valerie to Julian. Eve plans to form a relationship again with Vincent (believing that motherhood has mellowed him), and convinces Julian not to turn him in to the police. During the rehearsal dinner for the joint weddings of Luis Lopez-Fitzgerald and Fancy Crane, Noah Bennett and Paloma Lopez-Fitzgerald, Miguel Lopez-Fitzgerald and Kay Bennett, and Edna Wallace and Norma Bates, Vincent and Viki kill all the guests with a poison mushroom sauce, but Tabitha gives up her powers and becomes a born again Christian in order to resurrect everyone. Vincent is last seen being arrested by Chief of Police Sam Bennett. Since T. C. Russell, Whitney, and Simone moved to New Orleans in 2007, Eve and Vincent are the only two members of the Russell family to appear in the series finale.|$|R
40|$|Using the {{conventions}} of the still life genre, this project examines the thesis that accidents are not necessarily ‘accidents’. Drawing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> parapraxes that Freud called ‘the psychopathology of everyday life’, the photographs record domestic objects broken by the author. ‘Bungled Memories’ challenges {{the assumption that the}} still life genre picture is purely ‘formal’ and the pictures draw attention to the social and cultural significance of the domestic field. Written captions alongside the photographs give clues to hidden (unconscious) meaning. The work also refers to fragments of paintings by Jean-Baptiste Greuze, the French painter championed in the late C 18 th by Enlightenment critic, Denis Diderot. The photographs were taken during the period 2000 - 2007. Each object was photographed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same <b>kitchen</b> <b>table</b> in still life compositions using local light. Research covered psychoanalytic theories of accidents and memory, and the history, theory and practice of the still life genre, drawing <b>on</b> collections at <b>the</b> Louvre, Musee D’Orsay (Paris), the National Gallery and Wallace Collections (London). The photographs were published in Portfolio magazine accompanied by an essay on them by psychoanalyst Parveen Adams (Issue 42, 2005). They were also published in a special issue of philosophy and critical theory journal Angelaki, (Routledge, Volume 7, no 1, 2002); exhibited in Hobusepea Gallery, Tallinn, Estonia (February 2004); and included in group exhibition Diderot co-curated by Bate at Danielle Arnaud Contemporary Art, London (January – February 2005). The series was exhibited and discussed at the conference ‘Psychoanalysis and the Arts and Humanities’ at the Institute of Germanic & Romance Studies (November 2006). A final set of all the photographs (now twelve) will be exhibited at Hooper’s Gallery, London, in early 2008 to coincide with the publication of the complete series in book form published with Danielle Arnaud...|$|R
5|$|After the show's {{transition}} from NBC to DirecTV, Eve's storylines emphasize her romance with Julian and difficult relationship with Vincent. Believed dead, Vincent reveals himself, his gender identity and his pregnancy to Eve after seducing Julian (his father) and threatens {{to kill her}} if she tells anyone. In late 2007, he begins tormenting Eve out of revenge for her failure to prevent his abduction when he was born. Julian checks Eve into rehab after she relapses, abusing drugs and alcohol to cope with Vincent's frequent appearances. Vincent arranges for Eve's release from rehab to help him prepare for the impending birth. Vincent's psychopathic accomplice, Viki Chatsworth, later repeatedly stabs Julian in the groin and severs his penis. Vincent plies Eve with drugs and alcohol so she botches her attempt to surgically reattach Julian's penis; she reattaches it upside-down, and an erection might kill him. In May 2008, Eve and Julian assist Vincent {{with the birth of}} his son <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Russells' <b>kitchen</b> <b>table,</b> when Eve explains everything about Vincent and Valerie to Julian. Eve plans to form a relationship again with Vincent (believing that motherhood has mellowed him), and convinces Julian not to turn him in to the police. During the rehearsal for the joint weddings of Luis Lopez-Fitzgerald and Fancy Crane, Noah Bennett and Paloma Lopez-Fitzgerald, Miguel Lopez-Fitzgerald and Kay Bennett, and Edna Wallace and Norma Bates, Eve assures Julian that they love each other emotionally and intellectually; Julian vows that the Crane family will take more responsibility for their actions now that Alistair is dead. At the rehearsal dinner, Eve and the other dinner guests eat Vincent and Viki's poisoned mushroom sauce. She dies, but is resurrected when witch Tabitha Lenox renounces magic and becomes a born-again Christian. In the series finale, Kay uses her magic to heal Julian's penis. Since T.

40|$|The first {{oral history}} we {{conducted}} {{for this project}} was with Bernard “Barney” Bricmont. On March 7, 2007, Ellen Farmer set up her recording equipment <b>on</b> <b>the</b> very same <b>kitchen</b> <b>table</b> where, in 1973, six organic farmers founded the California Certified Organic Farmers (CCOF). An earlier, one-year effort by Rodale to create a certification program for organic farmers had floundered, and Bricmont called farmers {{together to form a}} statewide organization. However, most of the farmers were too busy to take on this task and Bricmont decided to administer CCOF from his Santa Cruz home. He served as founding vice president the first two years, and then became president of the organization from 1975 to 1985. Many of our narrators acknowledged the critical contribution of Bricmont’s generous volunteer work in the founding of <b>the</b> organic movement <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Central Coast of California. Barney Bricmont was born in 1938 in San Jose, California, long before the valley turned from growing fruit to becoming a center for high technology. He learned to farm from his aunt, who owned an apple orchard in Saratoga and was “a Rodale Press, Prevention Magazine enthusiast. ” Forty years ago, Bricmont and his wife bought two acres of land in Live Oak, California (an unincorporated community in Santa Cruz County, adjacent to Santa Cruz). They grew plant starts in 3000 square feet of greenhouse space and organic salad greens for the actress Carol Channing. Bricmont has worked as an independent irrigation contractor since 1975. Bricmont helped start the very first (post WWI) farmers’ market in the Central Coast, at Live Oak Elementary School in 1975. His position <b>on</b> <b>the</b> school board of the Live Oak school district offered an advantage in securing the support for the farmers’ market, as well the first Life Lab school garden, a project that has blossomed into national prominence and is well documented elsewhere in this oral history series. He worked closely with California State Assemblymember Sam Farr <b>on</b> <b>the</b> California Organic Foods Act of 1979. Bricmont’s dedicated career as a community organizer spans organizations as diverse as the Santa Cruz Democratic Central Committee, the California School Boards Association, the Friends of the Library, and the Cultural Council of Santa Cruz County...|$|R
