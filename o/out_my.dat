5|$|Reaching the cascade, {{or rather}} cataract, the roaring {{of which had}} a long time {{announced}} its vicinity, my soul was hurried by the falls into a new train of reflections. The impetuous dashing of the rebounding torrent from the dark cavities which mocked the exploring eye, produced an equal activity in my mind: my thoughts darted from earth to heaven, and I asked myself why I was chained to life and its misery? Still the tumultuous emotions this sublime object excited, were pleasurable; and, viewing it, my soul rose, with renewed dignity, above its cares – grasping at immortality – it seemed as impossible to stop the current of my thoughts, as of the always varying, still the same, torrent before me – I stretched <b>out</b> <b>my</b> hand to eternity, bounding over the dark speck of life to come.|$|E

500|$|A club music {{song that}} lasts for three minutes, forty-one seconds, [...] "Up <b>Out</b> <b>My</b> Face" [...] appears as the ninth track on the album; track ten is a fifty-one second reprise called [...] "Up <b>Out</b> <b>My</b> Face (The Reprise)". Its {{instrumentation}} {{makes use of}} a [...] "thumping" [...] marching band coda, while its lyrics are about expressing [...] "anger at an incompatible lover". Brian Mansfield of USA Today highlights the lyrics [...] "If we were two Lego blocks, even the Harvard University graduating class of 2010 couldn't put us back together again" [...] {{as one of the}} album's [...] "many funny lines". Rolling Stone writer Jody Rosen wrote that the singer [...] "gets in touch with her funny bone" [...] on [...] "Up <b>Out</b> <b>My</b> Face". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine described the references to Lego, Harvard University and Humpty Dumpty as [...] "a whole new level of lyrical ridiculousness".|$|E
500|$|Bill Lamb of About.com placed [...] "Up <b>Out</b> <b>My</b> Face" [...] in {{his list}} of the album's top four tracks. Although J. Edward Keyes of Newsday {{described}} the track as [...] "exuberant", he was critical of its placement on the album: [...] "The production, courtesy of the reliable Tricky Stewart and The-Dream, feels boilerplate at best. At 17 songs, the record is far too long, {{and by the time}} the exuberant 'Up <b>Out</b> <b>My</b> Face' arrives, it feels like it was grafted on from a better record." [...] Ann Powers of Los Angeles Times thought that Carey lacked conviction in her approach to the song, writing that despite its aggressive tone, [...] "restraint stops serving her agenda".|$|E
500|$|Carey {{revealed}} that {{she intended to}} re-release Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel as a remix album in early 2010, titled Angels Advocate, consisting of remixes of the standard songs with new featured artists, including Mary J.

[...] "Angels Cry" [...] and [...] "Up <b>Out</b> <b>My</b> Face" [...] from Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel were released as remix singles with Ne-Yo featuring on the former and Nicki Minaj on the latter. The remix version of [...] "Up <b>Out</b> <b>My</b> Face" [...] featuring Minaj was released to rhythmic contemporary and urban contemporary radio in the United States on January 26, 2010.

500|$|... "Up <b>Out</b> <b>My</b> Face" [...] {{is a song}} by American {{singer and}} {{songwriter}} Mariah Carey from her twelfth studio album, Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel (2009). Written and produced by Carey, Tricky Stewart and The-Dream, it is a club music song which includes a marching band in its instrumentation. It received a mixed response from music critics, but its humorous lyrics attracted praise. Brian Mansfield of USA Today believed that the lyrics were directed at Eminem, whom Carey has a longstanding feud with, at one point singing [...] "I know you're not a rapper, so you better stop spittin' it." [...] Carey released [...] "Up <b>Out</b> <b>My</b> Face" [...] as a remix featuring Nicki Minaj in January 2010 for a proposed Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel remix album called Angels Advocate, which was ultimately shelved.|$|E

500|$|A {{writer for}} DJ Booth noted that Carey's {{confidence}} on the lead single [...] "Obsessed" [...] bordered on aggression, {{and that the}} residual energy from the track carried over to other songs on the album, including [...] "H.A.T.E.U." [...] and [...] "Up <b>Out</b> <b>My</b> Face", whereby she was [...] "ready for war". Kathy Iandoli of HipHopDX criticized Carey's vocals, writing: [...] "An attempted whistle-tone {{at the close of}} 'H.A.T.E.U.' doesn't necessarily indicate that Carey’s pipes are rusting, but perhaps she's succeeding more with less blustery vocals these days".|$|E
