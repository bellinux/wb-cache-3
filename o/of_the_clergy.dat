5|$|Bormann {{was one of}} {{the leading}} proponents of the ongoing {{persecution}} of the Christian churches. In February 1937 he decreed that members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>clergy</b> should not be admitted to the NSDAP. The following year he ruled that any members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>clergy</b> who were holding party offices should be dismissed, and that any party member who was considering entering the clergy had to give up his party membership. While Bormann's push to force the closure of theological departments at Reich universities was unsuccessful, he was able {{to reduce the amount of}} religious instruction provided in public schools to two hours per week and mandated the removal of crucifixes from classrooms. Speer notes in his memoirs that while drafting plans for Welthauptstadt Germania, the planned rebuilding of Berlin, he was told by Bormann that churches were not to be allocated any building sites.|$|E

5|$|Many Lollards {{were still}} about, {{especially}} in London and the Thames Valley, in Essex and Kent, Coventry, Bristol {{and even in}} the North, who would be receptive to the new ideas when they came, who looked for a reform in the lifestyle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>clergy.</b> They emphasised the preaching of the word over the sacrament of the altar, holding the latter to be but a memorial, but they were not party to the actions of the government. Other ideas, critical of the papal supremacy were held, not only by Lollards, but by those who wished to assert the supremacy of the secular state over the church but also by conciliarists such as Thomas More and, initially, Cranmer. Other Roman Catholic reformists, including John Colet, Dean of St Paul's, warned that heretics were not nearly so great a danger to the faith as the wicked and indolent lives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>clergy.</b>|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> goal <b>of</b> Espejo's {{first three}} works was <b>the</b> {{intellectual}} improvement <b>of</b> Quito.

Marco Porcio Catón exposed <b>the</b> ignorance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pseudointellectuals <b>of</b> Quito. La ciencia blancardina, in which Espejo claimed to be <b>the</b> author <b>of</b> <b>the</b> previous two works, condemned <b>the</b> results <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>clergy's</b> educational system: ignorance and affectation.

5|$|Today, {{the great}} {{majority}} of the cardinals are archbishops of the main metropolitan dioceses of the world and reside in their countries. Apart from the exclusive right of the election of the new pope, their dignity is purely honorific. However, originally the College of Cardinals was simply a college <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>clergy</b> of the City of Rome, constituted of the bishops of the seven dioceses (called suburbicarian sees) bordering the diocese of Rome (cardinal-bishops), priests of the parochial churches of Rome (cardinal-priests) and deacons heading the ecclesiastical regions of the city of Rome (cardinal-deacons). Unlike today, the cardinals had real jurisdiction over the dioceses, parochial churches (called tituli) or deaconries to which they were attached. The phenomenon of the external cardinalate in the late Middle Ages constituted the first exception to the rule, that cardinals – members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>clergy</b> of the diocese of Rome – cannot serve simultaneously in another, external church, which is now common practice.|$|E
5|$|A {{slackening}} {{of social}} customs occurred on all social levels; extramarital relationships and illegitimate children were common. Because poverty {{was on the}} rise—especially in the lower classes—many women were forced to find lodgings quickly, for example in convents, o. This explained the abundance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>clergy</b> in a small city like Quito; often men were ordained not because of a vocation but because it solved their economic problems and improved their community standing.|$|E
5|$|But reform {{brought with}} it new ways of {{thinking}} about the church and its personnel, derived not only from contemporary continental movements but also from the rich pastoral and canonical literature of the Carolingian renaissance. This disseminated ideas concerning the separation of the lay and religious spheres, the distinction between monks and clergy, and enhanced the authority of bishops as both pastoral and political leaders. Ultimately, these ideas were to strike at deeply entrenched features of the early medieval church, such as hereditary control of churches and the right <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>clergy</b> to marry.|$|E

There are valuable texts that reflect themes of teaching theology of that time and professor´s beliefs. The work is the first comprehensive modern overview of Jan Körner´s life and his publications for <b>the</b> magazine <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Catholic <b>clergy...</b>|$|R

5|$|However, Evans {{may have}} overly {{emphasised}} a political {{interpretation of the}} sermon for his own political gain; the see of Derry had just opened and Evans wished to have his friend William Nicolson take the position. Evans' political intrigue provoked Swift during an inspection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>clergy</b> of Meath at Trim. Swift, as vicar of Laracor spoke during a synod to defend himself, his sermons, and his politics, and instead of resolving the issue, only caused more dispute between the two.|$|E
5|$|In 1529 {{the king}} summoned Parliament {{to deal with}} annulment, thus {{bringing}} together those who wanted reform but who disagreed what form it should take; it {{became known as the}} Reformation Parliament. There were Common lawyers who resented the privileges <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>clergy</b> to summon laity to their courts; there were those who had been influenced by Lutheran evangelicalism and were hostile to the theology of Rome; Thomas Cromwell was both. Henry's Chancellor, Thomas More, successor to Wolsey, also wanted reform: he wanted new laws against heresy.|$|E

5|$|In {{anticipation}} of the upcoming twentieth anniversary of his reign on November 20, 303, Diocletian declared a general amnesty in a third edict. Any imprisoned clergyman could now be freed, {{so long as he}} agreed to make a sacrifice to the gods. Diocletian may have been searching for some good publicity with this legislation. He may also have sought to fracture the Christian community by publicizing the fact that its clergy had apostatized. The demand to sacrifice was unacceptable to many of the imprisoned, but wardens often managed to obtain at least nominal compliance. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>clergy</b> sacrificed willingly; others did so on pain of torture. Wardens were eager to be rid <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>clergy</b> in their midst. Eusebius, in his Martyrs of Palestine, records the case of a clergy who, after being brought to an altar, had his hands seized and made to complete a sacrificial offering. The clergyman was told that his act of sacrifice had been recognized and was summarily dismissed. Others were told they had sacrificed even when they had done nothing.|$|E

Alexander's election had been secured by promising that he would confirm the unconfirmed French bishops.
