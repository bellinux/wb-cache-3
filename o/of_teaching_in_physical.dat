Among the quality factors in Higher Education we can find: University guidance {{and analysis of the}} graduate´s incorporation into the labour world. In this article we present the research we did in conducted at the six classes of graduates <b>of</b> <b>Teaching</b> <b>in</b> <b>Physical</b> Education from the University of Seville (N = 292). From the data we obteined, we can observe that 95 % of the surveyed population does not ask for work or professional guidance during their degree and 63 % of the surveyed population find their first job connected with the world of sport and physical activity, while 37 % of this population has a work connected with other topics. Thus, we can conclude that most graduates <b>of</b> <b>Teaching</b> <b>in</b> <b>Physical</b> Education do not receive guidance for their incorporation into the labour world.

The study is based on information provided by a group of 73 students of the second course <b>of</b> <b>Teaching</b> <b>in</b> <b>Physical</b> Education Degree, from the University of Alicante, of the academic course 2009 / 10. The students answered openly the proposal to write two letters to two of their teachers at any stage of their academic career: one was addressed to that teacher who had had a profound impact on them, the other, to that person dedicated to teaching but had gone unnoticed in their lives. We have focused our attention only at the letters that they addressed to good teachers because it has been considered the magnitude of the study. Participants have thrown valuable information that has become the engine of this research, qualitative in nature, with which we have studied a number of categories with AQUAD 6 (Huber, 2006) programme. The results contribute to draft the profile of a teaching professional to educate citizens in the information society, based in five dimensions: personal qualities of teachers, teaching ability, quality of teacher interaction processes, types of training promoted by the teacher and teacher performance impact on students. These dimensions are basically the same in the scientific literature and in the syllabus of Teaching Degree.   Este artículo recoge los resultados de un estudio realizado para conocer cuál es el perfil del docente competente, mediante la identificación y descripción de las cualidades que los estudiantes de Magisterio atribuyen a los buenos profesores.

40|$|This is an Accepted Manuscript of {{an article}} {{published}} by Taylor & Francis in Physical Education and Sport Pedagogy on 30 May 2016, available online: [URL] The role that content knowledge, {{an important component of}} practical subject matter knowledge, plays for pre-service teachers (PSTs) in physical education teacher education (PETE) remains contested and unclear. Whilst some researchers emphasise the facilitative nature of such knowledge, others criticise that too much focus on content knowledge has a negative effect on the development of pupil-centred and critical pedagogies. Despite of its seeming importance, specific research into this aspect of the knowledge base remains scarce. Purpose: This research set out to examine the effects that varying levels of content knowledge had on the development of PSTs in PETE. In doing so, it aimed to create an enhanced understanding of how this knowledge base influences the learning and development of PSTs in PETE. Methods and procedures: Shulman’s [1987. ‘Knowledge and Teaching: Foundation of the new Reform’. Harvard Educational Review 57 (1) : 1 – 22] conceptualisation of the knowledge base for teaching was used to delineate the concept of content knowledge. Influenced by a constructivist approach to grounded theory, this study employed semi-structured interviews, lesson observations and post-lesson reflections as main instruments of data collection during three stages of a one-year PETE programme at a University in the UK. Using constant comparative analysis, data from 12 PSTs (6 female; 6 male) were analysed, following a 2 -stage analysis procedure as outlined by Charmaz [2006. Constructing Grounded Theory: A Practical Guide Through Qualitative Analysis. London: Sage]. Main outcomes and results: Content knowledge limitations were found to have numerous effects on PSTs. Lack of teaching confidence, as well as adverse impact on enacted teaching knowledge (pedagogical content knowledge) highlighted that at least ‘adequacy’ of content knowledge is needed, if PSTs are to use more advanced pedagogical strategies with confidence. Content knowledge was seen to be context specific and contextualised within the curriculum delivered in the respective schools, where PSTs were placed. In-depth content knowledge was perceived to be an asset {{that could be used to}} design and teach lessons that were responsive to pupil need. Conclusions: In line with Siedentop’s [[1989] 2002. ‘Content Knowledge for Physical Education’. Journal <b>of</b> <b>Teaching</b> <b>in</b> <b>Physical</b> Education 21 (4) : 368 – 377] critique of the academicisation of PETE, this study confirmed the facilitative role of content knowledge. Whilst such knowledge by itself does not guarantee good teaching, the debate about the wider role practical subject matter knowledge needs be re-visited. As universities and schools reposition and redefine their roles within a changing landscape of teacher education partnership models and the academic priorities and funding limitations at UK universities, the development of a range and depth of content knowledge represents an evolving challenge for all of those involved in PETE...|$|E

40|$|The effect <b>of</b> <b>teaching</b> method <b>in</b> <b>physical</b> {{education}} {{is an important}} issue and has been a concern of the expert teacher. Teachers are expected to create a model <b>of</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>in</b> their field; therefore, it is reasonable to question what is the effect <b>of</b> an alternative <b>teaching</b> method on student performance <b>in</b> <b>physical</b> education. This study explores whether teaching methods with advanced planning, behavior and belief in high enthusiasm, use of instructional strategies and evaluation, together termed a systematic <b>teaching</b> approach, used <b>in</b> a <b>physical</b> education activity would provide an effective environment for learning which supports student achievement in the psychomotor, cognitive, and affective domains. This study also investigated whether there was a difference in performance between students who were taught with a systematic teaching approach and students who were taught with the traditional teaching model. Information was collected using two performance skills, a written test, and one questionnaire. The 68 participants were randomly assigned into either an experimental group or a control group. Two teachers were assigned to either the experimental group or the control group. The teaching experiment took place at Tamsui Oxford University College in Taiwan and lasted eight weeks. ^ Research questions were analyzed using the t-test.

However, there’s certain visual deficiency existing in the accurate motion positioning and the kinematic analysis of the two-dimensional sport demonstration system. In order to help coaches and students clearly understand the subtle points of <b>physical</b> sports <b>in</b> an all-around way, this paper studied the sport demonstration system based on three-dimensional reconstruction. It analyzed the camera imaging principle and the three-dimensional reconstruction principle in theory, and has reached {{the conclusion that the}} key in the three-dimensional reconstruction of two-dimensional digital video lies in the segmentation of two-dimensional videos. The selective analyses of this paper are about the three-dimensional reconstruction of segmented images. Based on this reason, this paper proposed the calibration technique of application camera and the means of stereo matching, so as to achieve the precise matching of accurate space ray equation and corresponding pixels. In the final part, this paper took diving as the example and designed the sport demonstration system composed of analysis module, three-dimensional simulation, interface module and data management module on basis of three-dimensional reconstruction...|$|R

This paper focuses on new technologies in the context <b>of</b> learning and <b>teaching</b> <b>in</b> <b>Physical</b> Geography and reflects on the implications of our experiences for education in hydrology. We evaluate the experience of designing and trialling novel mobile technology-based field exercises and a virtual field tour for a Year 1 undergraduate Physical Geography module at a UK university. The new exercises are based on using and obtaining spatial data, operation of meteorological equipment (explained using an interactive DVD), and include introductions to global positioning systems (GPS) and geographical information systems (GIS). The technology and exercises were well received in a pilot study and subsequent rolling-out to the full student cohort (&sim; 150 students). A statistically significant improvement in marks was observed following the redesign. Although the students enjoyed using mobile technology, the increased interactivity and opportunity for peer learning were considered to be the primary benefits by students. This is reinforced further by student preference for the new interactive virtual field tour over the previous "show-and-tell" field exercise. Despite the new exercises having many advantages, exercise development was not trivial due to the high start-up costs, the need for provision of sufficient technical support and the relative difficulty of making year-to-year changes (to the virtual field tour in particular). Our experiences are highly relevant to the implementation of novel learning and <b>teaching</b> technologies <b>in</b> hydrology education...|$|R

The <b>teaching</b> <b>of</b> skills <b>in</b> <b>physical</b> {{assessment is}} therefore a large component of pre-registration nursing programmes. As the nursing curriculum becomes more crowded with what is deemed to be essential content, {{there is a need}} to rationalise what is taught in preparatory nursing programmes to ensure readiness for practice. The study outlined in this paper, as part of a larger project, explored the <b>teaching</b> <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> assessment skills <b>in</b> pre-registration nursing programmes across Australia. Fifty-three academics completed the 121 item online survey, indicating whether each skill was taught with practice, taught with no practice or not taught at all. The results suggest that only half the skills were being taught by more than 80 % of the academics and 23 skills (19 %) were taught by more than 90 %. Of the 121 skills commonly taught – 69 skills (57 %) were taught with student practice and 29 (24 %) were taught with no student practice. The results of this study raise questions about the <b>teaching</b> <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> assessment <b>in</b> pre-registration nursing programmes. The suggestion is not that skills that are used regularly or infrequently should be removed from the curriculum, rather, the authors propose that consideration be given to whether the <b>teaching</b> <b>of</b> skills that are never likely to be used is occurring at the expense of comprehensive mastery of core skills...|$|R

40|$|Background: In {{order to}} design {{appropriate}} environments for performance and learning of movement skills, physical educators need a sound theoretical {{model of the}} learner and of processes of learning. <b>In</b> <b>physical</b> education, this type of modelling informs the organisation of learning environments and effective and efficient use of practice time. An emerging theoretical framework in motor learning, relevant to physical education, advocates a constraints-led perspective for acquisition of movement skills and game play knowledge. This framework shows how physical educators could use task, performer and environmental constraints to channel acquisition of movement skills and decision-making behaviours in learners. From this viewpoint, learners generate specific movement solutions to satisfy the unique combination of constraints imposed on them, a process which can be harnessed during physical education lessons. Aims: In this paper {{the aim is to}} provide an overview of the motor learning approach emanating from the constraints-led perspective, and examine how it can substantiate a platform for a new pedagogical framework <b>in</b> <b>physical</b> education: nonlinear pedagogy. We aim to demonstrate that it is only through theoretically valid and objective empirical work of an applied nature that a conceptually sound nonlinear pedagogy model can continue to evolve and support research <b>in</b> <b>physical</b> education. We present some important implications for designing practices in games lessons, showing how a constraints-led perspective on motor learning could assist <b>physical</b> educators <b>in</b> understanding how to structure learning experiences for learners at different stages, with specific focus on understanding the design <b>of</b> games <b>teaching</b> programmes <b>in</b> <b>physical</b> education, using exemplars from Rugby Union and Cricket. Findings: Research evidence from recent studies examining movement models demonstrates that physical education teachers need a strong understanding of sport performance so that task constraints can be manipulated so that information-movement couplings are maintained in a learning environment that is representative of real performance situations. Physical educators should also understand that movement variability may not necessarily be detrimental to learning and could be an important phenomenon prior to the acquisition of a stable and functional movement pattern. We highlight how the nonlinear pedagogical approach is student-centred and empowers individuals to become active learners via a more hands-off approach to learning. Conclusions: A constraints-based perspective has the potential to provide physical educators with a framework for understanding how performer, task and environmental constraints shape each individual's physical education. Understanding the underlying neurobiological processes present in a constraints-led perspective to skill acquisition and game play can raise awareness of physical educators that teaching is a dynamic 'art' interwoven with the 'science' of motor learning theories. </p...|$|R
