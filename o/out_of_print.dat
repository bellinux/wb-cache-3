5|$|A typical Robinsonade– a {{genre of}} fiction {{inspired}} by Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe– {{and one of}} the most popular of its type, the book first went on sale in late 1857 and has never been <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>print.</b> Among the novel's major themes are the civilising effect of Christianity, 19th-century British imperialism in the South Pacific, and the importance of hierarchy and leadership. It was the inspiration for William Golding's dystopian novel Lord of the Flies (1954), which inverted the morality of The Coral Island; in Ballantyne's story the children encounter evil, but in Lord of the Flies evil is within them.|$|E

He was also a prolific author who wrote on both scientific and social issues; his account of his adventures and observations during his explorations in Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia, The Malay Archipelago, was both popular and highly regarded. Since its publication in 1869 it has never been <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>print.</b>|$|E

40|$|The Canadian {{research}} student {{working in}} the field of English history is necessarily hampered by the inaccessability of original documents. The following work has been constructed, therefore, from material culled <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>printed</b> sources like the Calendar of State Papers, Domestic; Acts of the Privy Council; Historical Manuscripts Commission; Journals of the House of Commons; and the Statutes of the Realm. These sources exhaust the material available to anyone treating this subject in Canada. This work represents an attempt to make the student of English history, sheriff conscious. For as yet, this official has not received the attention rightfully due him as an important dignitary in the county government of England. Moreover, in my opinion, taking an institution and then watching it undergo a slow change over a certain period of time, is the very stuff of history. [ [...] . ...|$|R
