ISCRE-24 {{will be held}} in Minneapolis, MN, on June 12-15, 2016. [...] These conferences bring together for three days distinguished international researchers in reaction engineering, prominent industrial practitioners, and new researchers and students of this multifaceted field. ISCRE symposia are a unique gathering place for reaction engineers where research gains are consolidated and new frontiers explored. The state of the art of various sub-disciplines of reaction engineering is reviewed in a timely manner, and new research initiatives are discussed.|$|E

50|$|Microreactors, {{and more}} generally, micro process engineering, {{are the subject}} of {{worldwide}} academic research. A prominent recurring conference is IMRET, the International Conference on Microreaction Technology. Microreactors and micro process engineering have also been featured in dedicated sessions of other conferences, such as the Annual Meeting of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE), or the International Symposia <b>on</b> <b>Chemical</b> <b>Reaction</b> Engineering (ISCRE). Research is now also conducted at various academic institutions around the world, e.g. at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge/MA, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Oregon State University in Corvallis/OR, at University of California, Berkeley in Berkeley/CA in the United States, at the EPFL in Lausanne, Switzerland, at Eindhoven University of Technology in Eindhoven, at Radboud University Nijmegen in Nijmegen, Netherlands and at the LIPHT http://www-lipht.u-strasbg.fr/Interface/index.php of Université de Strasbourg in Strasbourg and http://www.lgpc.fr/Objets|LGPC of the University of Lyon, CPE Lyon, France.|$|E
50|$|One {{example of}} an {{experimental}} storage system based <b>on</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>reaction</b> energy is the salt hydrate technology. The system uses the reaction energy created when salts are hydrated or dehydrated. It works by storing heat in a container containing 50% sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution. Heat (e.g. from using a solar collector) is stored by evaporating the water in an endothermic reaction. When water is added again, heat is released in an exothermic reaction at 50 °C (120 °F). Current systems operate at 60% efficiency. The system is especially advantageous for seasonal thermal energy storage, because the dried salt can be stored {{at room temperature for}} prolonged times, without energy loss. The containers with the dehydrated salt can even be transported to a different location. The system has a higher energy density than heat stored in water and the capacity of the system can be designed to store energy from a few months to years.|$|E

40|$|The redox (Reduction-Oxidation) {{flow battery}} {{is one of}} the most {{promising}} rechargeable batteries due to its ability to average loads and output of power sources. The transient characteristics are well known as the remarkable feature of the battery. Then it can also compensate for a sudden voltage drop. The dynamics are governed by the <b>chemical</b> <b>reactions,</b> fluid flow, and electrical circuit of its structure. This causes the difficulty of the analysis at transient state. This paper discusses the transient behavior of the redox flow battery based <b>on</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>reactions.</b> The concentration change of vanadium ions depends <b>on</b> the <b>chemical</b> <b>reactions</b> and the flow of electrolysis solution. The <b>chemical</b> <b>reaction</b> rate is restricted by the attached external electric circuit. In this paper, a model of the transient behavior is introduced. The validity of the derived model is examined based on experiments for a tested micro-redox flow battery system...|$|R
40|$|Ultrasound {{can be used}} in {{chemistry}} to increase both reaction rates and yields of products. Most effects of ultrasound <b>on</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>reactions</b> are due to cavitation: the formation and collapse of small bubbles in the solvent. In this review, we first outline the physical background of cavitation, and discuss its dependence on factors such as sound intensity and frequency, solvent and temperature. The impact of ultrasound <b>on</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>reactions</b> is considered for homogeneous reactions and for heterogeneous liquid-solid systems. The first area is mainly illustrated by a discussion of the effect of ultrasound on polymerization and depolymerization reactions, the second by selected examples in organic synthesis. The tendency of ultrasound to change reaction mechanisms in favour of homolytic (instead of heterolytic) pathways, is also briefly discussed. The specific preference for a particular pathway under sonochemical conditions, different from that under mechanical stirring has been termed ''sonochemical switching''. Ultrasonic equipment for lab-scale experiments are compared, and some practical ''tricks and traps'' are given...|$|R
50|$|Until {{the late}} 1960s, soil {{chemistry}} focused primarily <b>on</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>reactions</b> {{in the soil}} that contribute to pedogenesis or that affect plant growth. Since then, concerns have grown about environmental pollution, organic and inorganic soil contamination and potential ecological health and environmental health risks. Consequently, the emphasis in soil chemistry has shifted from pedology and agricultural soil science to an emphasis on environmental soil science.|$|R
30|$|Intracellular {{networks}} are nowadays commonly described by ODEs based <b>on</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>reaction</b> kinetics and regulatory interactions. This results in systems of coupled nonlinear equations, which show phenomena beyond the superposition principle. Here, Physics has made valuable {{contributions to the}} general field of nonlinear dynamics by developing approaches {{to the analysis of}} such systems, and by equipping mathematicians with physical examples of systems that show highly nonlinear behaviors [57].|$|E
40|$|We study a new {{variant of}} the {{dissipative}} particle dynamics (DPD) model that includes the possibility of dynamically forming and breaking strong bonds. The emergent reaction kinetics may then interact with self-assembly processes. We observe that self-assembled amphiphilic aggregations such as micelles have a catalytic effect <b>on</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>reaction</b> networks, changing both equilibrium concentrations and reaction frequencies. These simulation results are in accordance with experimental results on the so-called “concentration effect”...|$|E

Further ground tests on the formaldehyde clock reaction led to the rather surprising conclusions that surfaces can exert a nucleation effect and that long-range surface influences <b>on</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>reaction</b> rates are apparently operative...|$|E

50|$|Thermodynamic stability. Many <b>chemical</b> <b>{{reactions}}</b> {{that appear}} {{not to take}} place in fact happen very slowly. In addition, many reactions that appear to have happened can slowly reverse themselves. Since most 3D media are based <b>on</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>reactions,</b> there is therefore a risk that either the unwritten points will slowly become written or that the written points will slowly revert to being unwritten. This issue is particularly serious for the spiropyrans, but extensive research was conducted to find more stable chromophores for 3D memories.|$|R
