Impressed with Russell Mulcahy's work on Highlander, , The Shadow and Ricochet, Anderson signed Mulcahy on as director, stating, [...] "Russell pioneered a very distinct visual style, {{a lot of}} moving camera and crane work, lots of very fast cutting. He’s got a very cool eye and sees great ways to shoot. His work certainly had a big influence <b>on</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> a filmmaker and that’s why I was very excited {{to work with him}} on this movie." ...|$|E

Kesha told MTV that the video primarily involves men (described as [...] "douchey") hitting on Kesha, while she declines their advances. [...] "At one point," [...] Kesha says [...] "I get to be strapped to this harness and bouncing around everywhere, {{and it was really}} cool [...] The whole concept of the video was a bunch of douche-y guys macking <b>on</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> usual, and me making them eat their toupees or other various items". Melanie Bertoldi of Billboard said that the clip was [...] "thoroughly entertaining".|$|E
500|$|Although both of Vonnegut's {{parents were}} fluent German speakers, the ill feeling toward that country {{during and after}} World War I caused the Vonneguts to abandon that culture to show their American patriotism. Thus, they did not teach their {{youngest}} son German or introduce him to German literature and tradition, leaving him feeling [...] "ignorant and rootless." [...] Vonnegut later credited Ida Young, his family's African-American cook and housekeeper for the first 10 years of his life, for raising him and giving him values. [...] " [...] gave me decent moral instruction and was exceedingly nice to me. So she was as great an influence <b>on</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> anybody." [...] Vonnegut described Young as [...] "humane and wise", adding that [...] "the compassionate, forgiving aspects of [...] beliefs" [...] came from her.|$|E

500|$|Genesis {{have been}} cited as a {{principal}} influence on the neo-progressive rock subgenre {{that emerged in the}} 1980s, featuring bands including Marillion, and Pallas. Steve Hackett's work in Genesis influenced guitarists such as Brian May of Queen, Alex Lifeson of Rush, and Eddie Van Halen of Van Halen. Genesis were also an influence on post-punk artists such as Simple Minds and Will Sergeant, guitarist of Echo & the Bunnymen, as well as the electronic new wave band The Human League. Trey Anastasio of Phish said [...] "It's impossible to overstate what impact this band and musical philosophy had <b>on</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> a young musician. I'm forever in their debt." [...] Mostly Autumn [...] "fuse the music of Genesis and Pink Floyd" [...] in their sound. The alternative rock band Elbow acknowledge Genesis as an influence, such as on their breakthrough song [...] "Newborn".|$|E
500|$|His humor {{caused him}} trouble {{during his time}} in Washington. He was known to greet {{citizens}} walking by his office on the White House tour by saying to them, [...] "If you look <b>on</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> a wild animal, be kind enough to throw peanuts at me". This prompted Wilson to move Marshall's office to the Senate Office building, where {{he would not be}} disturbed by visitors. In response to a proposal to the board of the Smithsonian Institution to send a team to excavate for ruins in Guatemala, Marshall suggested that the team instead excavate around Washington. When asked why, he replied that, judging by the looks of the people walking on the street, {{they should be able to}} find buried cave-men no more than six feet down. The joke was not well received, and he was shut out of board meetings for nearly a year.|$|E
500|$|According to {{intersex}} {{activist and}} academic Morgan Holmes, Eugenides posits that a person's sexual attraction determines {{his or her}} gender. Cal's wish to become male because he desires females demonstrates a link between gender identity and sexuality. While Callie is not permitted to love the Obscure Object openly, Cal can freely love Julie. Holmes believed that the depiction of Callie [...] "denies the legitimate place of lesbian desire and rewrites it as male heterosexuality." [...] Book reviewer Georgia Warnke has a similar view. She wrote that by making these choices in the novel, Eugenides agrees {{with the belief that}} being attracted to females is [...] "masculine" [...] and thus it is [...] "more natural" [...] for a male to be attracted to a female than a female be attracted to a female. Daniel Mendelsohn of The New York Review of Books argued that Callie {{does not have to be}} a male in order to be drawn towards females; she could be gay. As an adult, Cal brags, [...] "Breasts have the same effect <b>on</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> on anyone with my testosterone level." [...] Mendelsohn noted that this assertion will astonish [...] "Eugenides's (presumably testosterone-rich) gay male readership". Scholar Rachel Carroll agreed, writing that teenage Callie's erotic interest in girls is [...] "retroactively explained and legitimized, by the discovery of his 'true biological nature'." [...] Cal's gender identity postdates rather than predates his sexual interests. Carroll posited that Cal's inability to form heterosexual relationships as an adult is founded not upon his being intersex, but on his rejection of the sexual ambiguities that form his sexual interests as a youth.|$|E

500|$|Peter Buck's {{style of}} playing guitar has {{been singled out}} {{by many as the}} most {{distinctive}} aspect of R.E.M.'s music. During the 1980s, Buck's [...] "economical, arpeggiated, poetic" [...] style reminded British music journalists of 1960s American folk rock band The Byrds. Buck has stated [...] " [...] Roger McGuinn was a big influence <b>on</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> a guitar player", but said it was Byrds-influenced bands, including Big Star and The Soft Boys, that inspired him more. Comparisons were also made with the guitar playing of Johnny Marr of alternative rock contemporaries The Smiths. While Buck professed being a fan of the group, he admitted he initially criticized the band simply because he was tired of fans asking him if he was influenced by Marr, whose band had in fact made their debut after R.E.M. Buck generally eschews guitar solos; he explained in 2002, [...] "I know that when guitarists rip into this hot solo, people go nuts, but I don't write songs that suit that, and I am not interested in that. I can do it if I have to, but I don't like it." [...] Mike Mills' melodic approach to bass playing is inspired by Paul McCartney of The Beatles and Chris Squire of Yes; Mills has said, [...] "I always played a melodic bass, like a piano bass in some ways [...] [...] [...] I never wanted to play the traditional locked into the kick drum, root note bass work." [...] Mills has more musical training than his bandmates, which he has said [...] "made it easier to turn abstract musical ideas into reality." ...|$|E

In 1996, Shakur released All Eyez on Me, and many of the tracks are considered by critics to be classics, including [...] "Ambitionz Az a Ridah", [...] "I Ain't Mad at Cha", [...] "California Love", [...] "Life Goes On" [...] and [...] "Picture Me Rollin".

Milton's response is to point out how such a definition cannot actually separate different kinds of governments: ...|$|E

2500|$|Murasaki {{suffered}} overwhelming loneliness, {{had her own}} {{concerns about}} aging, and was not happy living at court.

I am perversely stand-offish; if only I can avoid putting off those for whom I have genuine respect." [...] Keene speculates that as a writer who required solitude Murasaki's loneliness may have been [...] "the loneliness of the artist who craves companionship but also rejects it". He points out she had [...] "exceptional powers of discernment" [...] and probably alienated the other women, about 15 or 16 of whom she describes in her diary. Although she adds praise for each woman, her criticism is more memorable because she saw through and described their flaws.|$|E
2500|$|After Lind {{had been}} with García for a year, the {{composer}} Giacomo Meyerbeer, an early and faithful admirer of her talent, arranged an audition for her at the Opéra in Paris, but she was rejected. The biographer Francis Rogers concludes that Lind strongly resented the rebuff: when she became an international star, she always refused invitations to sing at the Paris Opéra. Lind returned to the Royal Swedish Opera, greatly improved as a singer by García's training. [...] She toured Denmark where, in 1843, Hans Christian Andersen met {{and fell in love}} with her. Although the two became good friends, she did not reciprocate his romantic feelings. She is believed to have inspired three of his fairy tales: [...] "Beneath the Pillar", [...] "The Angel" [...] and [...] "The Nightingale". He wrote, [...] "No book or personality whatever has exerted a more ennobling influence <b>on</b> <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> a poet, than Jenny Lind. For me she opened the sanctuary of art." [...] The biographer Carol Rosen believes that after Lind rejected Andersen as a suitor, he portrayed her as The Snow Queen with a heart of ice.|$|E

The second time they met was in Rome when Dev Anand was on his way back from the Venice Film Festival, he visited him on the set of Roman Holiday. [...] "I was returning from the Venice film fest. I stopped my car and joined the crowd watching the shoot, hoping that his eyes would fall <b>on</b> <b>me.</b> <b>As</b> expected, he nodded and I walked up to him. He remembered me and we exchanged pleasantries." [...] The third meeting was at London on the set of Moby Dick. However, Suraiya asked for an exclusive meeting with her idol at her house. Though Anand says jealousy was natural for anyone in love, he didn't mind that he was not invited. [...] "I didn't quite feel anything. It wasn't as if they were going to fall in love or make love. Even if they would have, it wouldn't have mattered. I was mature enough. Moreover, he wasn't my rival. I too was a big star by then," [...] says Anand.|$|E
