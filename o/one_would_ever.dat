5|$|Eldred did {{not have}} a troop board of review, a review by the adult troop leaders to ensure eligibility. Instead, Eldred had a {{thorough}} National Board of Review consisting of West, Baden-Powell, Ernest Thompson Seton, Daniel Carter Beard, Arthur R. Forbush, and Wilbert E. Longfellow, who wrote in the Handbook for Boys on life-saving and swimming. At the time there had still not been a council-level system for Eagle Scouts boards of review. Largely due to delays caused by Baden-Powell's visit, the National Court of Honor did not convene until March 29, 1912. A press announcement was released on or about April 10, 1912, leading to a century of confusion wherein it was believed Eldred's Board of Review had been held in April. West informed Eldred of his Eagle award in a letter dated August 21, 1912. Another reason for the delays was that the Boy Scouts of America felt no <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> earn the Eagle Scout award and at the time of Eldred's Board of Review, the Eagle Scout medal had not yet been designed. This letter also informed Eldred of the delay in the medal, caused {{by the fact that the}} design of the Eagle Scout medal had not been finalized. Eldred was presented Eagle Scout on Labor Day, September 2, 1912, becoming the first to earn Scouting's highest rank, just two years after the founding of the BSA itself.|$|E

25|$|The {{restaurant}} Savoy at the {{top floor}} of one of the buildings around the Esplanadi in central Helsinki is famous for its vorschmack. The restaurant used to be frequented by Mannerheim and Mannerheim’s table at the Savoy was always reserved and, out of respect, no <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> consider demanding to be seated there.

Deception is necessary for action—and for exquisite design—according to this argument. By systematic comparison of the Guggenheim Bilbao Museum and the Sydney Opera House, and by examples from dozens of other projects, the article demonstrates how seductive, yet precarious, the argument is...|$|R

John knew stuff we're not even ready to reveal, that won't come out for a couple of seasons. He was an awesome hunter, and by the time he showed up in 'Dead Man's Blood', he knew it all." ...|$|E

Dave Hughes, creator of the series Off the Air, who had discussed with the group about developing a series, took note of Resnick's sketch and helped the collective develop it into an infomercial. After airing the special, Wham City featured the skit for their comedy tour of New York City. Resnick informed Network Awesome that they will probably not produce any more fake infomercials, and that O'Brien {{is working with the}} network to create something that viewers will [...] "stumble on unintentionally." ...|$|E

[...] He stated in the liner notes for Piano Collections Final Fantasy VI that he intended the music to be emotionally moving, and entreated the listener {{not to think about the}} music, but to feel it. He also feels that the title track for Final Fantasy VI was the most challenging track he has ever made. As for Final Fantasy VI Grand Finale, on the other hand, Uematsu has said that he was [...] "not satisfied with this album at all", due to the deviation it took from his original visions for the music due to his lack of personal involvement in the arrangements. Although he did not feel that the album was a poor one, saying that if he said nothing no <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> know of his dissatisfaction, he felt that it was not what he would have created if he had [...] "defend the image of each piece".|$|E

500|$|After Underwood's Play On Tour {{wrapped in}} December 2010, {{she started to}} work on her fourth studio album, which was then untitled. Sony Music Nashville chairman/CEO Gary Overton said that the singer [...] "took nearly a year to compile and record the songs." [...] Songwriters Chris Tompkins and Josh Kear, who {{previously}} wrote [...] "Before He Cheats" [...] for Underwood's debut album, Some Hearts (2005), worked on [...] "Blown Away" [...] initially without a specific artist in mind. At first, they built the drums and the string parts that of the introduction and verses. Tompkins started playing his keyboard to find sound effects for the introduction, and ended up using one that was a thunderstorm. [...] "I think that's what kind of threw us into it. We just started writing it," [...] he said. The songwriters then {{came up with the}} first verse of the song: [...] "Dry lighting cracks across the skies / Those storm clouds gather in her eyes / Her daddy was a mean old mister / Momma was an angel in the ground / The weatherman called for a twister / She prayed blow it down." [...] Kear commented that it was not the duo's intent or goal to make it a dark, revenge-themed song. As they wrote the pre-chorus line [...] "not enough rain in Oklahoma", both knew that it was a Carrie Underwood song, as the singer is from that state. [...] "We knew if we stuck with that lyric [...] it was Carrie's song or maybe no <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> record it," [...] Kear commented. After the theme of the song had been established, the songwriters wanted to [...] "dig up as much drama as [...] could." [...] Lyrically, [...] "Blown Away" [...] {{tells the story of a}} daughter locking herself in a storm cellar while her alcoholic father is passed out on the couch in the path of a tornado. Underwood revealed that [...] "Blown Away" [...] was the song that defined the direction of the album, and recalled the first time she heard the demo: ...|$|E

Shortly after, Wilhelm's close friend Gustav Krupp von Bohlen wrote that the Emperor had told him: He [...] would declare war at once, if Russia mobilized. This time people would {{see that he was}} not [...] "falling out". The Emperor's {{repeated}} protestations that in this case no <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> again be able to reproach him with indecision were almost comic to hear In the same way, Berchtold suggested that Austrian leaders go on vacation [...] "to prevent any disquiet" [...] about what had been decided.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the second}} episode of series sixteen, Hammond {{suggested}} that no <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> {{want to own}} a Mexican car, since cars are supposed to reflect national characteristics and so a Mexican car would be [...] "lazy, feckless, flatulent, overweight, leaning against a fence, asleep, looking at a cactus with a blanket {{with a hole in}} the middle on as a coat." [...] Hammond finished with the remark [...] "I'm sorry, but can you imagine waking up and remembering you're Mexican?!"

2500|$|Minos {{justified}} his accession as {{king and}} prayed to Poseidon for a sign. Poseidon sent a giant white bull {{out of the}} sea. Minos was committed to sacrificing the bull to Poseidon, but then decided to substitute a different bull. In rage, Poseidon cursed Pasiphaë, Minos' wife, with zoophilia. Daedalus built her a wooden cow, which she hid inside. The bull mated with the wooden cow and Pasiphaë was impregnated by the bull, giving birth to a horrible monster, again named Asterius, the Minotaur, half man half bull. Daedalus then built a complicated [...] "chamber that with its tangled windings perplexed the outward way" [...] called the Labyrinth, and Minos put the Minotaur in it. To make sure no <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> know the secret of who the Minotaur was {{and how to get}} out of the Labyrinth (Daedalus knew both of these things), Minos imprisoned Daedalus and his son, Icarus, along with the monster. Daedalus and Icarus flew away on wings Daedalus invented, but Icarus' wings melted because he flew too close to the sun. Icarus fell in the sea and drowned.|$|E
