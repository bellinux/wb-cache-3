5|$|John Ralston Saul {{expressed}} the view in The Unconscious Civilization that in contemporary developed nations {{many people have}} acquiesced in turning over their {{sense of right and}} wrong, their critical conscience, to technical experts; willingly restricting their moral freedom of choice to limited consumer actions ruled by the ideology <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>free</b> <b>market,</b> while citizen participation in public affairs is limited to the isolated act of voting and private-interest lobbying turns even elected representatives against the public interest.|$|E
5|$|Of equal profile was Rutherford's government's {{management}} of the province's railways. Alberta's early years were optimistic ones, which manifested itself in a pronounced enthusiasm {{for the construction of}} new railway lines. Every town wanted to be a railway centre, and the government had great confidence in the ability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>free</b> <b>market</b> to provide low freight rates to the province's farmers provided sufficient charters were issued to competing companies. The legislature passed government-sponsored legislation setting out a framework for new railways in 1907, but interest from private firms in actually building the lines was limited. In the face of public demand and support by legislators of all parties for as rapid as possible an expansion of the province's lines, the government offered loan guarantees to several companies in exchange for commitments to build lines. Rutherford justified this in part by his conviction that railways needed to expand along with population, rather than having railway expansion follow population growth as would be the case without government intervention. The Conservatives argued that this strategy didn't go far enough, and called for direct government ownership.|$|E

Although he has been generally more daring in challenging party orthodoxy compared to his peers, analysts suggest that he is unlikely to directly challenge the party line.|$|E
25|$|Attempting {{to protect}} its colonial {{possessions}} and reverse its faltering role in colonial trade, the crown implemented liberalizing reforms, hastening the removal of trade restrictions and weakening colonial monopolies.

25|$|Aside {{from the}} rise of Marxism, E. Screpanti and S. Zamagni point to a {{different}} 'external' reason for marginalism's success, which is its successful response to the Long Depression and the resurgence of class conflict in all developed capitalist economies after the 1848-1870 period of social peace. Marginalism, Screpanti and Zamagni argue, offered a theory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>free</b> <b>market</b> as perfect, as performing optimal allocation of resources, while it allowed economists to blame any adverse effects of laissez-faire economics on the interference of workers' coalitions in the proper functioning of the market.|$|E
25|$|Like {{the other}} post-Communist regimes in Eastern Europe, Bulgaria found the {{transition}} to capitalism more painful than expected. The anti-Communist Union of Democratic Forces (UDF) took office and between 1992 and 1994 the Berov Government carried through the privatisation of land and industry through the issue of shares in government enterprises to all citizens, but these were accompanied by massive unemployment as uncompetitive industries failed and the backward state of Bulgaria's industry and infrastructure were revealed. The Socialists portrayed themselves as the defender of the poor against the excesses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>free</b> <b>market.</b>|$|E
25|$|Although he {{remained}} iconic to particular segments of society, particularly the elderly, Muldoon faded quickly {{as a force}} on the political scene. His biographer, Barry Gustafson, who described himself as not a Muldoon supporter, wrote that he still served as an active MP for his Tamaki electorate, dealing immediately with matters {{from all walks of}} life. He continued to write in international economic journals, arguing that the unemployment that had arisen as a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>free</b> <b>market</b> reforms was worse than the gains that were made, a view that came to be popular {{by the time of the}} Fifth Labour Government in 1999.|$|E

5000|$|He further {{wrote in}} Dissent in 1992 that [...] "capitalism {{has been as}} unmistakable a success as {{socialism}} has been a failure"http://www.reason.com/news/show/32874.html and complimented Milton Friedman, Friedrich Hayek, and Ludwig von Mises on their insistence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>free</b> <b>market's</b> superiority. He emphasized that [...] "democratic liberties have not yet appeared, except fleetingly, in any nation that has declared itself to be fundamentally anticapitalist." [...] However, Heilbroner's preferred capitalist model was the highly redistributionist welfare states of Scandinavia; he stated that his model society was [...] "a slightly idealized Sweden." ...|$|R

25|$|Finally, the {{question}} may be raised: Are corporations themselves mere grants of monopoly privilege? Some advocates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>free</b> <b>market</b> were persuaded {{to accept this}} view by Walter Lippmann's The Good Society. It should be clear from previous discussion, however, that corporations {{are not at all}} monopolistic privileges; they are free associations of individuals pooling their capital. On the purely free market, such individuals would simply announce to their creditors that their liability is limited to the capital specifically invested in the corporation, and that beyond this their personal funds are not liable for debts, as they would be under a partnership arrangement. It then rests with the sellers and lenders to this corporation {{to decide whether or not}} they will transact business with it. If they do, then they proceed at their own risk. Thus, the government does not grant corporations a privilege of limited liability; anything announced and freely contracted for in advance is a right of a free individual, not a special privilege. It is not necessary that governments grant charters to corporations.|$|E
500|$|Miliband also {{endorsed}} the Blue Labour {{trend in the}} Labour Party, founded by Maurice Glasman. Blue Labour talks about family and friendships {{at the heart of}} society, rather than just material wealth; it also offers a very strong critique <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>free</b> <b>market</b> as well as the big state. This was seen to have influenced his 2011 conference speech, signalling [...] "predatory and productive capitalism".|$|E

Ball-Young says that, {{in comparison to}} more precarious alternative work, the fashion industry {{is a good choice}} for workers. Powell argues sweatshops are [...] "part of the very process that raises living standards and leads to better working conditions over time". In contrast, the film shows a Texas organic cotton farmer, eco fashion activist Livia Firth and her sustainability-focused consulting firm, and people who manage fair trade clothing companies, such as animal-rights activist Stella McCartney, People Tree's Safia Minney, Redress's Christina Dean, and Patagonia's Vincent Stanley.|$|E

5000|$|David McNally {{argues that}} <b>the</b> logic <b>of</b> <b>the</b> market {{inherently}} produces inequitable outcomes {{and leads to}} unequal exchanges, arguing that Adam Smith's moral intent and moral philosophy espousing equal exchange was undermined by <b>the</b> practice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>free</b> <b>markets</b> he championed. <b>The</b> development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> market economy involved coercion, exploitation and violence that Adam Smith's moral philosophy could not countenance. McNally also criticizes market socialists for believing in <b>the</b> possibility <b>of</b> [...] "fair" [...] markets based on equal exchanges to be achieved by purging [...] "parasitical" [...] elements from the market economy, such as private ownership <b>of</b> <b>the</b> means <b>of</b> production. McNally argues that market socialism is an oxymoron when socialism is defined as an end to wage-based labor.|$|R
500|$|University of Texas {{economist}} James K. Galbraith has {{alleged that}} Stossel, in his September 1999 special Is America #1?, used an out-of-context clip of Galbraith {{to convey the}} notion that Galbraith advocated the adoption by Europe <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>free</b> <b>market</b> economics practiced by the United States, when in fact Galbraith actually advocated that Europe adopt some of the United States' social benefit transfer mechanisms such as Social Security, which is the economically opposite view. Stossel denied any misrepresentation of Galbraith's views and stated {{that it was not}} his intention to convey that Galbraith agreed with all of the special's ideas. However, he re-edited that portion of the program for its September 2000 repeat, in which Stossel paraphrased, [...] "Even economists who like Europe's policies, like James Galbraith, now acknowledge America's success." ...|$|E

500|$|During a July {{press conference}} in Spokane, Washington, while {{lobbying}} for ballot access, Paul promised that as president he would veto spending increases for both domestic programs and the military. He asked {{in reference to the}} portrayal of his party's plank, [...] "what's extreme about a balanced budget?" [...] Paul conceded that he would not win the election but explained that votes for his ticket would give a bigger voice to Libertarian issues in American politics, and that he would only be disappointed if he did not receive at least 5% of the vote in the state. A few weeks later, The New York Times discovered that many former members of the Pat Robertson campaign were helping Ron Paul's candidacy. They found that the campaign workers were disseminating literature in Michigan that criticized Bush, and stated that Paul would [...] "carry the standard" [...] <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>free</b> <b>market.</b> Paul commented in a San Diego Union interview that he [...] "identifwith Robertson" [...] although [...] "he's not a libertarian."
