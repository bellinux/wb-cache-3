5|$|Electric cars, {{as well as}} plug-in hybrids {{operating}} in all-electric mode, emit no harmful tailpipe pollutants from the onboard source of power, such as particulates (soot), volatile organic compounds, hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, ozone, lead, and various <b>oxides</b> <b>of</b> <b>nitrogen.</b> The clean air benefit is usually local because, depending on {{the source of the}} electricity used to recharge the batteries, air pollutant emissions are shifted to the location of the generation plants. In a similar manner, plug-in electric vehicles {{operating in}} all-electric mode do not emit greenhouse gases from the onboard source of power, but {{from the point of view}} of a well-to-wheel assessment, the extent of the benefit also depends on the fuel and technology used for electricity generation. This fact has been referred to as the long tailpipe of plug-in electric vehicles. From the perspective of a full life cycle analysis, the electricity used to recharge the batteries must be generated from renewable or clean sources such as wind, solar, hydroelectric, or nuclear power for PEVs to have almost none or zero well-to-wheel emissions. On the other hand, when PEVs are recharged from coal-fired plants, they usually produce slightly more greenhouse gas emissions than internal combustion engine vehicles and higher than hybrid electric vehicles. In the case of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles operating in hybrid mode with assistance of the internal combustion engine, tailpipe and greenhouse emissions are lower in comparison to conventional cars because of their higher fuel economy.|$|E

Because various plant species have different photosynthesis capacity. Thus, their ability to absorb carbondioxide from air also vary. In this studied, the research team measured leaf photosynthesis of more 150 plants in Bangkok.

40|$|The paper aims {{to assess}} the {{potential}} of decentralized bioenergy technologies in meeting rural energy needs and reducing carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions. Decentralized energy planning is carried out for the year 2005 and 2020. Decentralized energy planning model using goal programming technique is applied for different decentralized scales (village to a district) for obtaining the optimal mix of energy resources and technologies.

The decentralized energy planning model shows that biomass feedstock required at village to district level can even be obtained from biomass conserved by shifting to biogas for cooking.

Alcohol fumigation improved thermal efficiency slightly at moderate and heavy loads, but increased ignition delay at all operating conditions. Carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbon emission generally increased with alcohol fumigation and showed no dependence on alcohol type or quality. <b>Oxide</b> <b>of</b> <b>nitrogen</b> emission showed a strong dependence on alcohol quality; relative emission levels decreased with increasing water content of the fumigant.

Longannet used to burn up to 65,000 tonnes of treated and dried sewage sludge per year, which has a similar calorific value to low-quality brown coal. In 2005, a judge ruled the burning of sludge as illegal, but the SEPA continued to allow Scottish Power to burn the sludge illegally {{as part of an}} agreement which originally required Scottish Power to construct, and have in operation, a biomass plant in 2010.

25|$|Models and {{observations}} (see figure above, middle) show that greenhouse gas results in warming {{of the lower}} atmosphere at the surface (called the troposphere) but cooling of the upper atmosphere (called the stratosphere). Depletion {{of the ozone layer}} by chemical refrigerants has also resulted in a cooling effect in the stratosphere. If the sun was responsible for observed warming, warming of the troposphere at the surface and warming {{at the top of the}} stratosphere would be expected as increase solar activity would replenish ozone and <b>oxides</b> <b>of</b> <b>nitrogen.</b> The stratosphere has a reverse temperature gradient than the troposphere so as the temperature of the troposphere cools with altitude, the stratosphere rises with altitude. Hadley cells are the mechanism by which equatorial generated ozone in the tropics (highest area of UV irradiance in the stratosphere) is moved poleward. Global climate models suggest that climate change may widen the Hadley cells and push the jetstream northward thereby expanding the tropics region and resulting in warmer, dryer conditions in those areas overall.|$|E
25|$|Under wind, {{atmospheric}} pollutants {{move in a}} north and northeasterly direction, and in times of low winds or moderate winds, are more evenly distributed over the city. The most polluting industrial processes in the city are ammonium sulfate, cement, plaster and paper pulp. The emission of gases from motor vehicle traffic is more critical in the central district, {{where much of the}} business is. The main source of air pollution is from the vehicles at 34% and then industry with 18%. The pollutants emitted by vehicles are carbon monoxide (89.12%), sulfur dioxide (0.23%), hydrocarbons (6.46%), <b>oxides</b> <b>of</b> <b>nitrogen</b> (3.82%) and other particles (0. 37%). To help remedy this problem, several state enterprises and private sector have supported a project to convert liquid fuel vehicles to natural gas. Furthermore, the city has installed more than 12 service stations catering to natural gas vehicles. Barranquilla is the fourth biggest atmospheric polluter from industry. According to research conducted by the Institute of Hydrology, Meteorology and Environmental Studies of Colombia (IDEAM), monthly concentrations in Barranquilla of particulate matter smaller than 160 micrograms per cubic meter exceeds the highest international standard allowed of 70. The causes of this problem lie heavily on the poor quality of petrol and diesel used by vehicles of the city, with record levels of 5,000 ppm (parts per million sulfur) and 4,500 ppm respectively, when there are countries whose rates do not even exceed 50.|$|E
40|$|For this work, Hybrid PSO-GA and Artificial Bee Colony Optimization (ABC) {{algorithms}} {{are applied}} to the optimization of experimental diesel engine performance, to meet Environmental Protection Agency, off-road, diesel engine standards.

All trials were conducted at partial load on a four-cylinder, turbocharged, John Deere engine using neat-Biodiesel for PSO-GA and regular pump diesel for ABC. Key variables were altered throughout the experiments, including, fuel pressure, intake gas temperature, exhaust gas recirculation flow, fuel injection quantity for two injections, pilot injection timing and main injection timing. Both forms of optimization proved effective for optimizing engine operation. The PSO-GA hybrid was able to find a superior solution to that of ABC within fewer engine runs.

40|$|The Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) {{engine is}} the {{combination}} of both Spark Ignition (SI-Engine or Otto-Engine) and Compression Ignition (Diesel Engine). It uses homogeneous fuel-air mixtures as the SI-engine does and uses typically high compression ratio that allowed mixture to auto-ignite as the diesel engine does. The lean homogenous mixture in HCCI reduces particulate emissions and lean fuel-air mixture helps auto-ignite which is reducing the emission <b>of</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>of</b> <b>nitrogen</b> NOx about 90 - 98 %.

40|$|The {{problems}} {{of global warming}} and the unstable price of petroleum oils {{have led to a}} race to develop environmentally friendly biofuels, such as palm oil diesel or ethanol derived from corn and sugar cane. Biofuels are a potential replacement for fossil fuel, since they are renewable and environmentally friendly. This paper evaluates the combustion performance and emission characteristics of Refined, Bleached, and Deodorized Palm Oil (RBDPO) /diesel blends B 5, B 10, and B 15 by volume, using an industrial oil burner.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{different}} lines of research have revealed the important roles that nitric oxide (NO) plays in mammalian cell biology. Since 1977 it has been known that NO activates soluble guanylate cyclase, producing a rise in intracellular cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) [1]. This in turn could produce vascular smooth muscle cell relaxation, and accounted for the vasorelaxatory properties of a {{number of different}} compounds such as organic nitrates and sodium nitroprusside [2, 3]. The mechanism of action of other vasodilators which did not themselves generate NO remained obscure, but was shown to be dependent on an intact endothelium, leading to the concept of an endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) [4]. Further work by two groups led to the discovery that the chemical nature of EDRF was in fact NO, or a closely related <b>oxide</b> <b>of</b> <b>nitrogen</b> [5, 6]. Subsequently, NO was found to be of key importance in vasodilatation and macrophage killing of microorganisms and tumor cells, and that NO is important in mediating a diverse number of biological effects, including acting as a neurotransmitter in non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic nerves [7], inhibiting platelet [8], and acting as a negative inotrope and chronotrope [9]...|$|R
