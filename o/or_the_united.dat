5|$|For all its success, by the 1920s Argentina {{was not an}} industrialized {{country by}} the {{standards}} of Britain, Germany <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States. A major hindrance to full industrialisation was the lack of energy sources such as coal or hydropower. Experiments with oil, discovered in 1907, had poor results. Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales, the first state-owned oil company in Latin America, was founded in 1922 as a public company responsible for 51% of the oil production; the remaining 49% was in private hands.|$|E

5|$|For {{most of his}} career, Peart {{had never}} {{publicly}} identified with any political party or organization in Canada <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States.

In October 1993, shortly before that year's Canadian federal election, Peart appeared with then-Liberal Party leader Jean Chrétien in an interview broadcast in Canada on MuchMusic. In that interview, Peart stated he was an undecided voter who supported Quebec federalism.|$|E

5|$|The 1974 Davis Cup {{marked the}} first time that neither Australia <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States won the final since 1936, as South Africa and India were the finalists.

South Africa were awarded the Davis Cup on walkover. Sweden beat Czechoslovakia 3–2 the following year to become the first European nation since 1936 to win the Davis Cup. The Davis Cup underwent further reorganisation in 1981 when a 16 team World Group was introduced.

Tens of thousands of others emigrated to Canada <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States, finding opportunities there to own and farm their own land.|$|E
