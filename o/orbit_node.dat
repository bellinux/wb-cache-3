40|$|The Magellan {{spacecraft}} {{has been}} systematically mapping {{the surface of}} Venus since September 15, 1990, using side-looking synthetic aperture radar imaging and nadir-pointed altimetry. Venus rotates slowly under the nearly polar mapping orbit, completing a full revolution in 243 days, one 'mapping cycle'. The altimeter collects a 10 km swath of altitude measurements each orbit. The groundtrack advances 21 km each orbit due to the rotation of Venus, leaving an 11 km gap of unmeasured terrain. To obtain global surface coverage by the altimeter, these gaps are eliminated by interleaving the swaths collected during the second mapping cycle with those from the first mapping cycle. Interleaving was put into effect by a propulsive maneuver, executed {{at the end of}} the first mapping cycle, on May 17, 1991.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present Topology and Link Quality Assessment Protocol (TLQAP), {{which we have}} {{implemented}} as a wireless testbed management framework component, {{that is used to}} inspect link quality between wireless testbed nodes and appropriately map them to user experiment requirements. TLQAP is mainly an OSI layer 2 design for fixed location, non RF-isolated wireless testbed deployments, which assesses interconnection topology and link quality by estimating packet delivery ratio (PDR) and transmission delay at each node for all requested channel, rate and transmission power combinations. Moreover, TLQAP builds a measurement history log and creates a channel utilization profile, in the context of each testbed node, for all the nearby testbed-external devices that operate independently in the region and are not under the management framework control. The analysis of this information enables TLQAP to choose the channels that have the highest probability of being free during an experiment. TLQAP OSI layer 2 component has been implemented in the click modular router framework and the controller component has been integrated with OMF management framework for wireless testbeds.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{probabilistic}} {{model of the}} dust mass, flux and fluence which will be collected by the ROSETTA probe while orbiting around comet 46 P/Wirtanen. The dust environment of the target comet is simulated {{according to the most}} recent data available in the literature. Best fits of the DIDSY-GIOTTO data collected during the fly-by of comet 1 P/Halley have shown that the probabilistic properties of dust ejection from the inner coma are crucial (Fulle et al. 1995). Therefore, we pay particular attention to the dust ejection velocity, which is assumed to have a wide distribution around the most probable values, and the dust ejection distribution, which is assumed to have a strong anisotropy peaked towards the sun. To compute the impact velocity in the probe reference frame, the rigorous keplerian orbit of each grain is considered taking into account aberrations due to the probe orbital velocity. We analyse the dependence of the results on the probe orbit parameters, such as true anomaly, probe-nucleus distance, <b>orbit</b> <b>node</b> and inclination. Computations are performed for the six main directions of the probe reference frame and for different values of the acceptance angle. The only way to collect direct grains is to point towards the nucleus; the mass collected in this direction is almost independent of the acceptance angle and of the time evolution of dust loss rate. A strong dependence of the collected dust mass on node and inclination is evidenced. By assuming an acceptance angle of 40 Â°, the flux of reflected grains received in the two directions perpendicular to the probe orbit is higher than that in the nucleus direction, for 42 % of randomly oriented probe orbits. The value increases up to 56 % when the acceptance angle in the directions perpendicular to the probe orbit is increased up to 80 Â°. The dust ejection anisotropy produces a strong dependence of the fluxes on the probe anomaly. For reflected grains, the fluences show relevant depletions at the largest masses, due to dust orbital effects, and the collected masses strongly depend on the acceptance angle and on the time evolution of the dust loss rate. The total dust fluxes are evaluated by assuming a half sphere field of view (corresponding to an acceptance angle of 180 Â°) ...|$|E

40|$|QUIKVIS computes {{the times}} during an Earth orbit when {{geometric}} requirements are satisfied for observing celestial objects. The observed objects may be fixed (stars, etc.) or moving (sun, moon, planets). QUIKVIS {{is useful for}} preflight analysis by those needing information {{on the availability of}} celestial objects to be observed. Two types of analyses are performed by QUIKVIS. One is used when specific objects are known, the other when targets are unknown and potentially useful regions of the sky must be identified. The results are useful in selecting candidate targets, examining the effects of observation requirements, and doing gross assessments {{of the effects of the}} orbit's right ascension of the ascending node (RAAN). The results are not appropriate when high accuracy is needed (e. g. for scheduling actual mission operations). The observation duration is calculated as a function of date, <b>orbit</b> <b>node,</b> and geometric requirements. The orbit right ascension of the ascending node can be varied to account for the effects of an uncertain launch time of day. The orbit semimajor axis and inclination are constant throughout the run. A circular orbit is assumed, but a simple program modification will allow eccentric orbits. The geometric requirements that can be processed are: 1) minimum separation angle between the line of sight to the object and the earth's horizon; 2) minimum separation angle between the line of sight to the object and the spacecraft velocity vector; 3) maximum separation angle between the line of sight to the object and the zenith direction; and 4) presence of the spacecraft in the earth's shadow. The user must supply a date or date range, the spacecraft orbit and inclination, up to 700 observation targets, and any geometric requirements to be met. The primary output is the time per orbit that conditions are satisfied, with options for sky survey maps, time since a user-specified orbit event, and bar graphs illustrating overlapping requirements. The output is printed in visually convenient lineprinter form but is also available on data files for use by postprocessors such as external XY plotters. QUIKVIS is written in FORTRAN 77 for batch or interactive execution and has been implemented on a DEC VAX 11 / 780 operating under VMS with a central memory requirement of approximately 500 K of 8 bit bytes.

The geometry analyzed is a symmetrical one, including an equatorial orbit and two orbits with the same inclination and opposing ascending nodes. The main idea is that, by combining the accurate information on the satellite inertial position and velocity provided by the GPS receiver and the drag acceleration intensity provided by the DBI, due to the orbits' geometrical configuration, both atmospheric drag and wind can be resolved in a region close to the <b>orbit</b> <b>nodes.</b> Exploiting the Earth oblateness effect, a complete scan of the equatorial regions can be accomplished in the short mission lifetime typical of very low Earth orbit satellites, even in high solar activity peaks, when the expected nanospacecraft lifetime is about 40 days...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Emerging {{applications}} rely on wireless {{broadcast to}} disseminate time-critical information. For example, vehicular networks may exchange vehicle position and velocity information to enable safety applications. The number of nodes in one-hop communication range in such networks {{can be very}} large, leading to congestion and undesirable levels of packet collisions. Earlier work has examined such broadcasting protocols primarily from a MAC perspective and focused on selective aspects such as packet error rate. In this work, we propose a more comprehensive metric, the average system information age, which captures the requirement of such applications to maintain current state information from all other nearby nodes. We show that information age is minimized at an optimal operating point that lies between the extremes of maximum throughput and minimum delay. Also, via simulations we show that it cannot be achieved in 802. 11 networks through pure MAC techniques such as contention window adaptation. This motivates our design of an applicationlayer broadcast rate adaptation algorithm. It uses local decisions at nodes in the network to adapt their messaging rate to keep the system age to a minimum. Our simulations and experiments with 300 <b>ORBIT</b> <b>nodes</b> show that the algorithm effectively adapts the messaging rates and minimizes the system age. I...|$|R

40|$|Localized {{reductions}} in the magnetic field associated with plasma pressure in Mercury's magnetospheric cusp and nightside plasma sheet have been routinely observed by the Magnetometer on the MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry and Ranging (MESSENGER) spacecraft. We present a statistical analysis of near-equatorial magnetic depressions to derive the structure of Mercury's plasma sheet pressure. Because the plasma pressure in the magnetosphere correlates with solar wind density, the pressures were normalized to a Mercury heliocentric distance of 0. 39 AU. A model magnetic field was used to map observations obtained on the ascending and descending <b>orbit</b> <b>nodes</b> to the magnetic equator and revealed the presence of plasma in a toroidal section extending on the nightside from dusk to dawn. Mapping the data to invariant magnetic latitude shows that the pressure is symmetric about the magnetic equator. The average pressure normalized for heliocentric distance is 1. 45 nPa and exhibits a weak, 0. 05 nPa/h, dusk-to-dawn gradient with local time. The plasma sheet pressure can vary between successive orbits by an order of magnitude. Unlike the predictions of some global simulations of Mercury's magnetosphere, the plasma enhancements do not form a closed distribution around the planet. This difference may arise from the idealized solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field conditions used in the simulations, which maximize the size and stability of the magnetosphere, thus promoting the formation of drift paths that close around the planet. For typical plasma sheet energies, 5 keV, the first adiabatic invariant for protons fails to be conserved even within 500 km altitude at midnight, implying that stochastic processes {{must be considered in}} plasma sheet transport...|$|R

Nodal regression {{refers to}} the shift of the <b>orbit’s</b> line of <b>nodes</b> over time as Earth revolves around the Sun. Nodal regression is orbit feature utilized for circular orbits to be Sun synchronized. A sun-synchronized orbit lies in a plane that maintains a fixed angle {{with respect to the}} Earth-Sun direction. In the low Earth Sun synchronized circular orbits are suited the satellites that accomplish their photo imagery missions. Nodal regression depends on orbital altitude and orbital inclination angle. For the respective orbital altitudes the inclination window for the Sun synchronization to be attained is determined. The apsidal precession represents major axis shift, respectively the argument of perigee deviation.
