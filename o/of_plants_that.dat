5|$|In {{order to}} educate people about extinct forms of life, the Geological Survey of India {{installed}} lifesize fibreglass models of Rajasaurus and Titanosaurus at their Lucknow regional office. The installation is presented in an appropriate setting, with representations <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> <b>that</b> existed during the Mesozoic Era. Also displayed are limb bones, vertebra, eggs and coprolites of sauropod dinosaurs and fossil eggs of Rajasaurus collected from Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh.|$|E
5|$|The Cretaceous period saw the {{appearance}} of more plant defense mechanisms. The diversification of flowering plants (angiosperms) at that time {{is associated with the}} sudden burst of speciation in insects. This diversification of insects represented a major selective force in plant evolution, and led to selection <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> <b>that</b> had defensive adaptations. Early insect herbivores were mandibulate and bit or chewed vegetation; but the evolution of vascular plants lead to the co-evolution of other forms of herbivory, such as sap-sucking, leaf mining, gall forming and nectar-feeding.|$|E
5|$|Darwin {{held the}} {{opposite}} position; he maintained that Linnaeus's works should be translated as literally {{as possible and}} that the sexual references in the nomenclature should be retained. In 1783 and 1787, the Botanical Society of Lichfield, founded by Darwin {{and several of his}} friends specifically to translate Linnaeus's works, issued their own English translation, A System of Vegetables, that categorized over 1400 plants. Assisted by Samuel Johnson, they coined over fifty new botanical words; it is this work, along with the group's The Families <b>of</b> <b>Plants</b> <b>that</b> introduced the words stamen and pistil into the English language, for example. By 1796 their translation had prevailed and Withering was forced to adopt their vocabulary in later editions of his work.|$|E

5|$|Nomadic {{hunter-gatherer}} societies passed on, by oral tradition, {{what they}} knew (their empirical observations) about the different kinds <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> <b>that</b> they used for food, shelter, poisons, medicines, for ceremonies and rituals etc. The uses of plants by these pre-literate societies influenced the way the plants were named and classifiedtheir uses were embedded in folk-taxonomies, {{the way they were}} grouped according to use in everyday communication. The nomadic life-style was drastically changed when settled communities were established in about twelve centres around the world during the Neolithic Revolution which extended from about 10,000 to 2500 years ago depending on the region. With these communities came the development of the technology and skills needed for the domestication of plants and animals and the emergence of the written word provided evidence for the passing of systematic knowledge and culture {{from one generation to the}} next.|$|E
5|$|Rudimentary botanical science {{began with}} empirically-based plant lore passed from {{generation}} to generation in the oral traditions of paleolithic hunter-gatherers. The first written records of plants were made in the Neolithic Revolution about 10,000 years ago as writing was developed in the settled agricultural communities where plants and animals were first domesticated. The first writings that show human curiosity about plants themselves, rather than the uses that could be made of them, appears in the teachings of Aristotle's student Theophrastus at the Lyceum in ancient Athens in about 350 BC; this is considered the starting point for modern botany. In Europe, this early botanical science was soon overshadowed by a medieval preoccupation with the medicinal properties <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> <b>that</b> lasted more than 1000 years. During this time, the medicinal works of classical antiquity were reproduced in manuscripts and books called herbals. In China and the Arab world, the Greco-Roman work on medicinal plants was preserved and extended.|$|E
5|$|Stylidium {{species with}} glandular trichomes on their sepals, leaves, flower parts, or scapes have been {{suggested}} to be protocarnivorous (or paracarnivorous). The tip of the trichome produces a sticky mucilage—a mixture of sugar polymers and water—that is capable of attracting and suffocating small insects. The ability to trap insects may be a defensive mechanism against damage to flower parts. However, trichomes of S.fimbriatum {{have been shown to}} produce digestive enzymes, specifically proteases, like other carnivorous plants. Adding species of Stylidium to the list <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> <b>that</b> engage in carnivory would significantly increase the total number of known carnivorous plants.|$|E

5|$|Nectar-eating bats have {{acquired}} specialized adaptations. These bats possess long muzzles and long, extensible tongues covered in fine bristles that aid them in feeding on particular flowers and plants. The tube-lipped nectar bat (Anoura fistulata) has the longest tongue of any mammal relative to its body size. This is beneficial {{to them in}} terms of pollination and feeding. Their long, narrow tongues can reach deep into the long cup shape of some flowers. When the tongue retracts, it coils up inside the rib cage. However, because of these features, nectar-feeding bats cannot easily turn to other food sources in times of scarcity, making them more prone to extinction than any other type of bat. Nectar feeding also aids a variety of plants, since these bats serve as pollinators (as pollen can get attached to their fur while they are feeding). Around 500 species of flowering plant rely on bat pollination and thus tend to open their flowers at night. Rainforests are said to benefit the most from bat pollination, because of the large variety <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> <b>that</b> depend on it.|$|E

25|$|Some {{species of}} {{crawling}} plants can also sprout adventitious roots, {{but are not}} considered stoloniferous: a stolon is sprouted from an existing stem and can produce a full individual. Examples <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> <b>that</b> extend through stolons include some species from the genera Argentina (silverweed), Cynodon, Fragaria, and Pilosella (Hawkweeds), Zoysia japonica, Ranunculus repens.|$|E
25|$|In epigeal {{germination}} (or epigeous germination), the hypocotyl elongates {{and forms}} a hook, pulling rather than pushing the cotyledons and apical meristem through the soil. Once {{it reaches the}} surface, it straightens and pulls the cotyledons and shoot tip of the growing seedlings into the air. Beans, tamarind and papaya are examples <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> <b>that</b> germinate this way.|$|E
25|$|Betalains are a {{class of}} red and yellow indole-derived {{pigments}} found in plants of the Caryophyllales, where they replace anthocyanin pigments.

25|$|The EBK {{gathered}} berries {{for consumption}} and also prepared {{a number of}} wild plants, judging from the seed remains <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> <b>that</b> could not be consumed without preparation.
