5|$|In {{addition}} {{to breast cancer}} in men and women, mutations in BRCA2 also lead to {{an increased risk of}} ovarian, Fallopian tube, prostate, and pancreatic cancers, as well as malignant melanoma. In some studies, mutations in {{the central part of the}} gene have been associated with a higher risk <b>of</b> <b>ovarian</b> <b>cancer</b> and a lower risk of prostate cancer than mutations in other parts of the gene. Several other types of cancer have also been seen in certain families with BRCA2 mutations.|$|E
5|$|Surgical {{sterilization}} {{is available}} in the form of tubal ligation for women and vasectomy for men. There are no significant long-term side effects, and tubal ligation decreases the risk <b>of</b> <b>ovarian</b> <b>cancer.</b> Short term complications are twenty times less likely from a vasectomy than a tubal ligation. After a vasectomy, there may be swelling and pain of the scrotum which usually resolves in a week or two. With tubal ligation, complications occur in 1 to 2 percent of procedures with serious complications usually due to the anesthesia. Neither method offers protection from sexually transmitted infections.|$|E

25|$|The risk <b>of</b> <b>ovarian</b> <b>cancer</b> {{increases}} {{in women who}} have ovulated more over their lifetime. This includes those who have never had children, those who begin ovulation {{at a younger age}} or reach menopause at an older age. Other risk factors include hormone therapy after menopause, fertility medication, and obesity. Factors that decrease risk include hormonal birth control, tubal ligation, and breast feeding. About 10% of cases are related to inherited genetic risk; women with mutations in the genes BRCA1 or BRCA2 have about a 50% chance of developing the disease. The most common type <b>of</b> <b>ovarian</b> <b>cancer,</b> comprising more than 95% of cases, is ovarian carcinoma. There are five main subtypes of ovarian carcinoma, of which high-grade serous carcinoma is the most common. These tumors are believed to start in the cells covering the ovaries, though some may form at the Fallopian tubes. Less common types <b>of</b> <b>ovarian</b> <b>cancer</b> include germ cell tumors and sex cord stromal tumors. A diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>ovarian</b> <b>cancer</b> is confirmed through a biopsy of tissue, usually removed during surgery.|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the association between}} endometriosis, tubal ligation, hysterectomy and epithelial <b>ovarian</b> <b>cancer.</b> Relevant published literatures were searched in PubMed, ProQuest, Web of Science and Medline databases during 1995 – 2016. Heterogeneity was evaluated by I 2 statistic. Publication bias was tested by funnel plot and Egger’s test. Odds ratio and 95 % CI {{were used to assess}} the association strength. The statistical analyses in this study were accomplished by STATA software package. A total of 40, 609 cases <b>of</b> epithelial <b>ovarian</b> <b>cancer</b> and 368, 452 controls in 38 publications were included. The result suggested that endometriosis was associated with an increased risk <b>of</b> epithelial <b>ovarian</b> <b>cancer</b> (OR = 1. 42, 95 % CI = 1. 28 – 1. 57), tubal ligation was associated with a decreased risk <b>of</b> epithelial <b>ovarian</b> <b>cancer</b> (OR = 0. 70, 95 % CI = 0. 60 – 0. 81), while hysterectomy show no relationship with epithelial <b>ovarian</b> <b>cancer</b> (OR = 0. 97, 95 % CI = 0. 81 – 1. 14). A stratified analysis showed there were associations between endometriosis and the increased risk <b>of</b> epithelial <b>ovarian</b> <b>cancer</b> for studies conducted in USA and Europe. Meanwhile, there were associations between tubal ligation and the decreased risk <b>of</b> epithelial <b>ovarian</b> <b>cancer</b> for studies conducted in USA, Asia, Europe and Australia. The result indicated that endometriosis was a risk factor <b>of</b> epithelial <b>ovarian</b> <b>cancer</b> whereas tubal ligation was a protective risk factor <b>of</b> epithelial <b>ovarian</b> <b>cancer,</b> hysterectomy may have no relationship with epithelial <b>ovarian</b> <b>cancer...</b>|$|R

25|$|Suppression of ovulation, {{which would}} {{otherwise}} cause {{damage to the}} ovarian epithelium and, consequently, inflammation, is generally protective. This effect {{can be achieved by}} having children, taking combined oral contraceptives, and breast feeding, all of which are protective factors. A longer period of breastfeeding correlates with a larger decrease in the risk <b>of</b> <b>ovarian</b> <b>cancer.</b> Each birth decreases risk <b>of</b> <b>ovarian</b> <b>cancer</b> more, and this effect is seen with up to five births. Combined oral contraceptives reduce the risk <b>of</b> <b>ovarian</b> <b>cancer</b> by up to 50%, and the protective effect of combined oral contraceptives can last 25–30 years after they are discontinued. Regular use of aspirin or acetaminophen (paracetamol) may be associated with a lower risk of ovarian cancer; other NSAIDs do not seem to have a similar protective effect.|$|E
25|$|Research into {{mitigating}} {{side effects}} <b>of</b> <b>ovarian</b> <b>cancer</b> treatment is also ongoing.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the expression of}} matrix metalloproteinase- 9 (MMP- 9) and nuclear factor κappa-B (NF-κB) in different ovarian tissue and explore the relationship between their expression and clinicopathological features <b>of</b> epithelial <b>ovarian</b> <b>cancer.</b> Methods: The expression of NF-κB and MMP- 9 in 15 cases <b>of</b> normal <b>ovarian</b> tissue and 80 cases <b>of</b> epithelial <b>ovarian</b> <b>cancer</b> were detected by mmunohistochemistry PV method. Results: Expression of MMP- 9 and NF-κB in epithelial <b>ovarian</b> <b>cancer</b> {{was significantly higher than}} those in normal ovarian, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0. 05). The expression of MMP- 9 protein was not related to histology classification and differentiation degree, but it was significantly related with lymphatic metastasis and clinical stage (P < 0. 05). The expression of NF-κB protein was significantly associated with histology classification, lymphatic metastasis, clinical stage, and differentiation degree (P < 0. 05). In epithelial <b>ovarian</b> <b>cancer</b> tissue, the expression of MMP- 9 and NF-κB proteins showed a significant positive correlation (P < 0. 01). Conclusion: The expression MMP- 9 and NF-κB proteins are closely related to pathological features <b>of</b> epithelial <b>ovarian</b> <b>cancer</b> and there are important significance to the development, invasion and metastasis <b>of</b> epithelial <b>ovarian</b> <b>cancer.</b> So they might become useful prognostic indicator for diagnosis and prognosis <b>of</b> epithelial <b>ovarian</b> <b>cancer...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Ovarian</b> <b>cancer</b> {{represents}} one <b>of</b> the cancers {{with the worst}} prognostic in adult women. More {{than half of the}} patients who present with clinical signs such as abdominal bloating and a feeling of fullness already show advanced stages. The majority <b>of</b> <b>ovarian</b> <b>cancers</b> grow as cystic masses, and cancer cells easily spread into the pelvic cavity once the cysts rupture or leak. When the <b>ovarian</b> <b>cancer</b> cells disseminate into the peritoneal cavity, metastatic nests may grow in the cul-de-sac, and in more advanced stages, the peritoneal surfaces of the upper abdomen become the next largest soil for cancer progression. Ascites is also produced frequently in <b>ovarian</b> <b>cancers,</b> which facilitates distant metastasis. Clinicopathologic, epidemiologic and molecular studies on <b>ovarian</b> <b>cancers</b> have improved our understanding and therapeutic approaches, but still further efforts are required to reduce the risks in the patients who are predisposed to this lethal disease and the mortality of the patients in advanced stages. Among various molecules involved in ovarian carcinogenesis, special genes such as TP 53 , BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 have been well investigated. These genes are widely accepted as the predisposing factors that trigger malignant transformation of the epithelial cells of the ovary. In addition, adnexal inflammatory conditions such as chronic salpingitis and ovarian endometriosis have been great research interests in the context of carcinogenic background <b>of</b> <b>ovarian</b> <b>cancers.</b> In this review, I discuss the roles of stromal cells and inflammatory factors in the carcinogenesis and progression <b>of</b> <b>ovarian</b> <b>cancers...</b>|$|R
25|$|Early {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} <b>of</b> <b>ovarian</b> <b>cancer</b> may be absent or subtle. In most cases, symptoms exist for several months before being recognized and diagnosed. Symptoms can be misdiagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome. The early stages <b>of</b> <b>ovarian</b> <b>cancer</b> tend to be painless. Symptoms can vary based on the subtype. Low malignant potential (LMP) tumors, also known as borderline tumors, do not cause an increase in CA125 levels and are not identifiable with an ultrasound. The typical symptoms of an LMP tumor can include abdominal distension or pelvic pain. Particularly large masses tend to be benign or borderline.|$|E
