However, larvae in predatory species prey on the ants’ brood and consequently spend much of their life hiding in pockets of the brood nest.|$|E

40|$|In the {{traditional}} classroom, the class attendance is accepted {{to be an}} important learning factor for students. Compared to e-learning, the use <b>of</b> <b>interactions</b> {{is considered to be a}} major factor in instruction and learning via computer-mediated communication (CMC) environment (Pena-Shaff et al., 2001). Literature in the field of distance education has classified the use <b>of</b> <b>interactions</b> into five groups. However, studies based on such literature but conducted in different context are still needed. The purpose of this paper is to investigate common characteristics of the use <b>of</b> <b>interactions</b> (UI) from the case of e-learning in Thailand. An exploratory factor analysis is used to examine the common components of the use <b>of</b> <b>interactions</b> in this context. The result reveals that UI is composed of three main factors, namely, human-to-human interactions, human-to-non-human interactions, and access duration. This outcome unveils the perception of the use <b>of</b> <b>interactions,</b> which reflects the student’s actual use of e-learning. It also gives better understanding to the e-learning administrators and instructors about the pattern <b>of</b> <b>interactions</b> from the student perspective.

By forced division of labour Durkheim means a situation where power holders, driven by their desire for profit (greed), results in people doing the work they are unsuited for.

40|$|International audienceThe {{dominance}} score (number of wins {{divided by}} the total number <b>of</b> <b>interactions)</b> is the most widely used procedure in field studies to rank individuals. Its reliability depends on the number <b>of</b> <b>interactions</b> on which it is calculated. However, most authors use it without any estimate of the associated error. We describe the precision associated with a dominance score estimate {{as a function of the}} number <b>of</b> <b>interactions</b> on which it is based, and hence provide a tool to plan field protocols and effort. The precision error decreases according to a power function with increasing number <b>of</b> <b>interactions,</b> but with more precision for extreme scores for any given number <b>of</b> <b>interactions.</b> We discuss the fact that the minimum number <b>of</b> <b>interactions</b> should be based on the precision associated with the 50 % score, the least precise of all scores. We also emphasize the trade-off between recording effort and precision of the estimator, and give an example of our choice <b>of</b> 26 <b>interactions</b> for fieldwork on ducks and geese. When comparing individual ranks based on dominance scores with ranks given by the dominance matrix, we found a good correlation, with more mismatches around the middle of the hierarchy. This was consistent with the precision calculated with our model. We conclude that dominance score is a reliable tool, but conclusions must take into account the number <b>of</b> <b>interactions</b> on which the calculations are done. We also discuss the importance of initial assumptions and sources of bias in field studies...|$|R
