They were directing a path of technology into 'cold light.' One of these was a long tube instead of a globe. It had a stop cock in the center and a glass bulb at each end. Hammer explained how this one came about. He said one day in 1902 he visited Pierre Curie, the husband of Madam Curie. Professor Curie drew a diagram <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>blackboard</b> and suggested that Hammer make a lamp like that with sulfide of zinc inside. Curie explained to Hammer what radium gaseous could do in this configuration. It would stimulate luminescence that would produce light without a hot filament involved.|$|E

25|$|Schooling came to her, {{as it was}} apt {{to come to a}} girl of her period, {{intermittently}} and in variety. She spent a year in a small {{boarding school}} in Plattsburg; an interval at a school kept at the Shurtliff homestead in Middlebury; attendance at the Middlebury Female Semimary; a winter at a village Academy in Rutland, where she recited Latin with boys preparing to enter college as sophomores; and a term or two at “Old T. C. A.” It was at Middlebury, in a one-story school house on Pleasant Street ,that she began the study of Latin, the subject of all others most useful in her adult life, as she declared. There, too, under Father Merrill, she wrote <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>blackboard</b> the list of English kings from Julius Caesar to William the Fourth, without a blunder. The feat was recalled by President John M.

25|$|As a {{young man}} John Schofield was educated in the public schools, helped his family farm and build their home, and then {{surveyed}} land in northern Wisconsin before spending a year teaching school in Oneco, Illinois not far from Freeport. Then U.S. Rep. Thomas J. Turner secured John Schofield an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point. He sold land for travel expenses and reported on June 1, 1849. In his final year at the Academy, while a teaching assistant in the mathematics section, cadet Schofield was accused of allowing others in his classroom to make offensive jokes and drawings <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>blackboard.</b> He was dismissed from West Point, but after meeting with Illinois' U.S. Senator Stephen A. Douglas, appealed the decision to the Secretary of War, who referred the matter back to a Board of Inquiry at the Academy. A majority of the review board voted to rescind the expulsion, {{but one of the}} two officers who voted to sustain it, cavalry and artillery instructor Lt. George H. Thomas, later became a commander of Schofield during the Civil War. Although Schofield's eventual memoirs did not mention Thomas on the review board, his persistent criticism of Thomas's generalship after the war may reflect this incident. Schofield graduated in 1853, ranking seventh in his class, and was commissioned a brevet second lieutenant in the artillery.|$|E

500|$|Several {{references}} {{in the film}} to Allen's own life have invited speculation that it is autobiographical. Both Alvy and Allen were comedians. His birthday appears <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>blackboard</b> in a school scene; certain features of his childhood are found in Alvy Singer's; Allen went to New York University and so did Alvy. Diane Keaton's real surname is [...] "Hall" [...] and [...] "Annie" [...] was her nickname, and she and Allen were once romantically involved. However, Allen is quick to dispel these suggestions. [...] "The stuff that people insist is autobiographical is almost invariably not," [...] Allen said. [...] "It's so exaggerated that it's virtually meaningless to the people upon whom these little nuances are based. People got it into their heads that Annie Hall was autobiographical, and I couldn't convince them it wasn't". Contrary to various interviewers and commentators, he says, Alvy is not the character that is closest to himself; he identified more with the mother (Eve, played by Geraldine Page) in his next film, Interiors. Despite this, Keaton has stated {{that the relationship between}} Alvy and Annie was partly based on her relationship with the director.|$|E
500|$|Ross {{was born}} Arnold Ephraim Chaimovich on August 24, 1906, in Chicago to Ukrainian-Jewish immigrants. He {{was an only}} child. His mother {{supported}} the family as a physical therapist. Ross returned to Odessa, Ukraine with his mother in 1909 for assistance from her extended family, and stayed once World War I and the Russian Revolution broke out. The two events led to widespread famine and economic woe in the region. Ross learned Russian {{at the behest of}} his mother, and developed a love of the theater and language. Ross's mother encouraged him to read, which he did often, and subscribed to a private library since Odessa had no public library. He credited his favorite uncle, an X-ray diagnostician, with introducing him to mathematics. The uncle had hired Samuil Shatunovsky to tutor his talented son, and Ross asked to join in. As money meant little due to inflation, Shatunovsky was paid to tutor the two boys with a pound of French hard candy. During this time, Ross was not taught with textbooks or lectured on geometric proofs. His geometry teacher would ask the class to prove and justify ideas <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>blackboard</b> per trial and error. Many universities were closed due to the famine, but Odessa University reopened and let a small group of adolescents attend, including Ross.|$|E
500|$|In {{the last}} {{scene of the}} episode, Bart is seen writing [...] "I will not expose the ignorance of the faculty" [...] <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>blackboard</b> as a {{punishment}} for exposing the ignorance of the teachers by removing the Teachers' Editions. In his book The Small Screen: How Television Equips Us to Live in the Information Age, Brian L. Ott describes this scene {{as one of the}} [...] "key ways The Simpsons appeals to audience, which tends to be younger, by critiquing authority figures, and in particular educators." [...] Toby Daspit and John Weaver write in their book Popular Culture and Critical Pedagogy: Reading, Constructing, Connecting that the writers of The Simpsons are [...] "particularly interested" [...] in questions about authority and the abuses of powers in school. Another scene from the episode sees Ms. Hoover telling the students to stare at the blackboard for fifteen minutes until class is over. Daspit and Weaver write that it is [...] "the absolute power that teachers have over students' every action that allows for the image to be presented on The Simpsons. It would be comforting to tell ourselves that this is simply parody run amok, that the writers are stretching reality to make a point, but the discussants in the study [...] had memories of a reality very much like the one presented in this program." [...] One of the discussants said she believes everyone has experienced similar situations in their school years, and she thinks the thought that [...] "an educator could ever do something so useless and pointless with the children's time" [...] is [...] "frightening".|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we discuss}} {{the need for a}} hybrid {{reasoning}} approach to handing Semantic Web (SW) data and explain why we believe that <b>the</b> <b>Blackboard</b> Architecture is particularly suitable. We describe how we have utilised it for coordinating a combination of ontological inference, rules and constraint based reasoning within a SW context. After describing <b>the</b> metaphor <b>on</b> which <b>the</b> <b>Blackboard</b> Architecture is based we introduce its key components: <b>the</b> <b>blackboard</b> Panels containing <b>the</b> solution space facts and problem related goals and sub-goals; the differing behaviours of the associated Knowledge Sources and how they interact with the blackboard; and, finally, the Controller and how it manages and focuses the problem solving effort. To help clarify, we use our test-bed system, the AKTive Workgroup Builder and Blackboard (AWB+B) to explain some of the issues and problems encountered when implementing a SW Blackboard System in a problem oriented context. ...|$|R

500|$|In the 1974–75 season Shero led the Flyers to a 51–18–11 record. They won {{the newly}} formed Patrick Division, were first in the new Campbell Conference, and first overall in the NHL. In their opening series the Flyers swept the Toronto Maple Leafs, setting up a semi-final match-up against the New York Islanders. After taking a 3–0 series led, the Flyers lost three {{straight}} {{to set up a}} deciding seventh game. Before game seven, Shero wrote a quote by Dag Hammarskjöld – [...] "Only he deserves power who every day justifies it." [...] <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>blackboard.</b> Though Shero never admitted it, the quote was believed to be directed at centre Rick MacLeish who had underperformed in the series. MacLeish responded and in game seven he registered a hat-trick as the Flyers won the game 4–1. The win set up a Stanley Cup Finals match-up with Buffalo. Shero and the coaching staff again devised a game plan. This time it was to stop Buffalo's French Connection line. The first part of the plan was to keep Sabre's centre Gilbert Perreault out of the middle of the rink and to take away his passing options. The Flyers' centres were instructed to play close to Perreault and be physical against him, {{to the point where it}} bordered on a penalty. The second part involved wearing down the French connection. Shero made numerous line changes to keep fresh players out against the Sabre's trio. A perfect example of this part of the strategy was in game one. The French Connection took a 97-second shift and the Flyers made three line changes during that time. Shero's strategy worked, and the Flyers won their second consecutive Stanley Cup.|$|E

It implements concepts common to a range of previous blackboard architecture programs, such as HEARSAY-III and BB 1. Teraphim includes as its basic elements a partitioned blackboard, a simple blackboard-controlled scheduler, a set of general-purpose scheduling heuristics to control the scheduler, a generic knowledge source with the ability to ask the user questions about incomplete data, modifiable methods of reasoning about uncertain data, and a simple explanation facility that traces the origins of terms <b>on</b> <b>the</b> problem <b>blackboard.</b> Trials of <b>the</b> system indicate that {{it can be used to}} implement expert systems to solve either synthesis or analysis problems. <b>The</b> <b>blackboard</b> architecture of Teraphim lends itself to experimentation with the kinds of knowledge representation and control knowledge needed to solve problems.
