5|$|Although no {{supernova}} {{has been}} observed in the Milky Way since 1604, it appears that a supernova exploded in the constellation Cassiopeia about 300 years ago, around the year 1667 or 1680.

Astrophysical plasmas are also observed in Accretion disks around stars or compact objects like white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes in close binary star systems. Plasma is associated with ejection of material in astrophysical jets, which have been observed with accreting black holes or in active galaxies like M87's jet that possibly extends out to 5,000 light-years.|$|E

Located 420 ± 10 light-years distant, it is a blue-white Be star of spectral type B8V, the presence of hydrogen emission lines in its spectrum indicating it has a circumstellar disc. These stars may be an optical double or a true multiple star system, with a separation of at least 50,000 astronomical units and the stars taking 3.5 million years to orbit each other. HR 4691 is itself double, composed of an ageing yellow-orange giant whose spectral type has been calculated at K0 or G3, and an F-type main-sequence star.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Most {{stars are}} formed in a cluster or association, where the number density of stars can be high. This {{means that a}} large {{fraction}} of initially-single stars will undergo close encounters with other stars and/or exchange into binaries. We describe how such close encounters and exchange encounters can affect the properties of a planetary system around a single star. We define a singleton as a single star which has never suffered close encounters with other stars or spent time within a binary system. It may be that planetary systems similar to <b>our</b> own <b>solar</b> system can only survive around singletons. Close encounters or {{the presence of a}} stellar companion will perturb the planetary system, often leaving planets on tighter and more eccentric orbits. Thus planetary systems which initially resembled <b>our</b> own <b>solar</b> system may later more closely resemble some of the observed exoplanet systems...|$|R

40|$|This article relates two {{topics of}} central {{importance}} in modern astronomy - the discovery some {{fifteen years ago}} of the first planets around other stars (exoplanets), and the centuries-old problem of understanding the origin of <b>our</b> own <b>solar</b> system, with its planets, planetary satellites, asteroids, and comets. The surprising diversity of exoplanets, of which more than 500 have already been discovered, has required new models to explain their formation and evolution. In turn, these models explain, rather naturally, {{a number of important}} features of <b>our</b> own <b>solar</b> system, amongst them the masses and orbits of the terrestrial and gas giant planets, the presence and distribution of asteroids and comets, the origin and impact cratering of the Moon, and the existence of water on Earth.

40|$|All {{stars are}} formed {{in some form}} of cluster or association. These environments can have a much higher number density of stars than the field of the galaxy. Such crowded places are hostile environments: a large {{fraction}} of initially single stars will undergo close encounters with other stars or exchange into binaries. We describe how such close encounters and exchange encounters will affect the properties of a planetary system around a single star. We define singletons as single stars which have never suffered close encounters with other stars or spent time within a binary system. It may be that planetary systems similar to <b>our</b> own <b>solar</b> system can only survive around singletons.

40|$|International audienceBecause {{they are}} so weakly bound, the orbits of wide binary stars evolve greatly under the {{influence}} of the Galactic tide and impulses from passing field stars. Most systems eventually pass through phases of high eccentricity, and this can have catastrophic consequences for the planets orbiting within these binary systems. During these eccentric phases, close encounters between the two binary members occur, and any planets orbiting the stars can be strongly perturbed. We use numerical simulations to study the planetary dynamics within such wide binaries, and we find that dynamical instabilities are common. For planetary configurations like <b>our</b> own <b>solar</b> system, we find that a wide binary companion (a > 1000 AU) will trigger planetary ejections in 1 / 3 to 1 / 2 of all systems. Interestingly, these ejections and instabilities typically occur only after hundreds of Myrs or Gyrs of evolution, possibly generating events similar to the LHB instability that occurred in <b>our</b> own <b>solar</b> system...|$|R
