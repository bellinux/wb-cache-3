5|$|The {{government}} {{in exile in}} London, unrecognized {{since the end of}} World War II, ridiculed by the communists, to many Poles was of great symbolic importance. Under President Edward Raczyński it overcame years of internal squabbles, and, after the election of the Polish pope and at the time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>increasingly</b> assertive Polish opposition, improved its image and standing.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. was {{expanding}} westwards and, in Ohio, Hiram Joy {{began to}} exploit Crystal Lake, near Chicago, which was soon {{linked to the}} city by the Chicago, St Paul and Fond du Lac Railroad company. The ice was used to allow goods {{to be brought to}} market. Cincinnati and Chicago began to use ice to help the packing of pork in the summer, John L. Schooley developing the first refrigerated packing room. Fruit began to be stored in the central Illinois using refrigerators, for consumption in later seasons. By the 1860s, ice was being used to allow the brewing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>increasingly</b> popular lager beer all year round. Improved railroad links helped the growth in business across the region and to the east.|$|E

5|$|There is no team or {{individual}} salary cap in the Premier League.

The average salary stands at £1.1million as of the 2008–09 season. As of 2015, average salaries in the Premier League are higher than for any other football league in the world.|$|E
5|$|Currently, {{the beam}} intensities at superheavy element {{facilities}} result in about 1012 projectiles hitting the target per second; this cannot be increased without burning {{the target and}} the detector, and producing larger amounts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>increasingly</b> unstable actinides needed for the target is impractical. The team at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna is building a new superheavy element factory (SHE-factory) with improved detectors {{and the ability to}} work on a smaller scale, but even so continuing beyond element 120 and perhaps 121 would be a great challenge. Krzysztof Rykaczewski, a professor at Oak Ridge National Laboratory which collaborates with Dubna on superheavy elements, has nevertheless predicted that in one generation element 124 would be reached. Chemist, writer, and philosopher of science Eric Scerri has noted that the development of new technologies in the field has been driven by the quest for new elements, so that the inability to proceed beyond elements 120 and 121 with current technologies may not necessarily cause a very long pause in new discoveries.|$|E
5|$|Described as battle-hungry, Augvald {{carried out}} raids into foreign territory, gaining great wealth and honour as a result. After {{a series of}} {{successful}} naval battles, {{he went on to}} conquer the land of the Holmrygr ("island-Rugi") people, based on the islands off the western coast of Rogaland. He banished the former chieftains from the newly conquered land, and set up his new base at the most favourable location on Karmøy, the largest island in Rogaland. The site he chose was later named Avaldsnes, after Augvald. Based on archaeological findings, it is believed that the ambitions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>increasingly</b> powerful Norwegian chieftains of the time were influenced by the Merovingian Franks, and especially Dagobert and his empire. As a builder of dynasties, Augvald has also been compared to Clovis.|$|E

5|$|Henry FitzEmpress {{returned}} to England {{again at the}} start of 1153 with a small army, supported in the north and east of England by Ranulf of Chester and Hugh Bigod. Stephen's castle at Malmesbury was besieged by Henry's forces, and the King responded by marching west with an army to relieve it. Stephen unsuccessfully attempted to force Henry's smaller army to fight a decisive battle along the river Avon. In the face <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>increasingly</b> wintry weather, Stephen agreed to a temporary truce and {{returned to}} London, leaving Henry to travel north through the Midlands where the powerful Robert de Beaumont, Earl of Leicester, announced his support for the Angevin cause. Despite only modest military successes, Henry and his allies now controlled the south-west, the Midlands and much of the north of England.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the 1986 U.S. attack, the army was purged of perceived disloyal elements, and in 1988, Gaddafi announced the creation of a popular militia to replace the army and police. In 1987, Libya began production of mustard gas at a facility in Rabta, although publicly denying it was stockpiling chemical weapons, and unsuccessfully attempted to develop nuclear weapons. The period also saw a growth in domestic Islamist opposition, formulated into groups like the Muslim Brotherhood and the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group. A number of assassination attempts against Gaddafi were foiled, and in turn, 1989 saw the security forces raid mosques believed to be centres of counter-revolutionary preaching. In October 1993, elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>increasingly</b> marginalized army initiated a failed coup in Misrata, while in September 1995, Islamists launched an insurgency in Benghazi, and in July 1996 an anti-Gaddafist football riot broke out in Tripoli. The Revolutionary Committees experienced a resurgence to combat these Islamists.|$|E
5|$|The PZPR Secretariat {{decided that}} Khrushchev's speech should have wide {{circulation}} in Poland, a unique {{decision in the}} Eastern Bloc. Bierut's successors seized on Khrushchev's condemnation of Stalinist policy as a perfect opportunity to prove their reformist, democratic credentials and their willingness to break with the Stalinist legacy. In late March and early April, thousands of Party meetings were held all over Poland, with Politburo and Secretariat blessing. Tens of thousands took part in such meetings. The Secretariat's plan succeeded beyond what they expected. During this period, the political atmosphere in Poland shifted as questions were increasingly asked about taboo subjects like the Polish Communists' legitimacy, responsibility for Stalin's crimes, the arrest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>increasingly</b> popular Gomułka, and issues in Soviet–Polish relations, such as the continued Soviet military presence in Poland, the Ribbentrop–Molotov Pact, the Katyn massacre, and the Soviet failure to support the Warsaw Uprising. A new Party Congress was demanded, as was a greater role for the Sejm and a guarantee of personal liberties. Alarmed by the process, the Party Secretariat decided to withhold the speech from the general public.|$|E

5|$|The {{remnants}} of Manuel tracked northwest around a ridge situated over the southeastern United States, and late on September16, emerged over open waters. Despite only marginally favorable conditions, convection soon {{increased over the}} center. At 1800 UTC on September17 Manuel regenerated into a tropical depression after redeveloping a well-defined circulation. Furthermore, conditions favored additional strengthening as the system tracked slowly northwestward around a ridge, although the cyclone was expected to move onshore the Baja California Peninsula in a few days. Although the convection was initially ragged, Manuel re-intensified into a tropical storm on September18. Later that day, an eye developed in the center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>increasingly</b> organizing convection, and at 0000UTC on September19, Manuel became a hurricane. It thus became the first eastern North Pacific tropical cyclone since records began in 1949 to make landfall in mainland Mexico, and later redevelop into a hurricane. The storm shifted more to the north, resulting in land interaction earlier than anticipated. Around 1200UTC on September19, Manuel made landfall just west of Culiacán as a minimal hurricane. Moving over the high terrain of western Mexico, Manuel quickly weakened into a tropical storm. The circulation dissipated at 0000 UTC on September20, over the Sierra Madre Occidental mountain range.|$|E
5|$|To draw Stephen's forces {{away from}} Wallingford, Henry besieged Stephen's castle at Malmesbury, and the King responded by marching west with an army to relieve it. Henry {{successfully}} evaded Stephen's larger army along the River Avon, preventing Stephen from forcing a decisive battle. In the face <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>increasingly</b> wintry weather, {{the two men}} agreed to a temporary truce, leaving Henry to travel north through the Midlands, where the powerful Robert de Beaumont, Earl of Leicester, announced {{his support for the}} cause. Henry was then free to turn his forces south against the besiegers at Wallingford. Despite only modest military successes, he and his allies now controlled the south-west, the Midlands and much of the north of England. Meanwhile, Henry was attempting to act the part of a legitimate king, witnessing marriages and settlements and holding court in a regal fashion.|$|E
5|$|Demolitions began {{soon after}} the {{withdrawal}} of the Jacobite threat in 1746. The bastions of the Telfer Wall along Lauriston Place were demolished in 1762, as they were obstructing traffic. The Netherbow survived until 1764, when it too was removed as an obstruction. The West Port and the Potterow Port were removed in the 1780s. By now, the New Town was under construction, and although smuggling of goods through the city walls was still being punished, complaints about the zealousness of the guards were widely circulated. The Old College of the University of Edinburgh (constructed from 1789), and then the Royal Museum of Scotland (constructed from 1861), were built over sections of the wall around the Potterow Port. Forrest Road was laid out in the 1840s, resulting in the loss of another section of the Telfer Wall. During construction works around the Advocates' Library and Parliament House in 1832 and 1845, fragments of walling were uncovered, which were attributed to the King's Wall. Two sections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>increasingly</b> neglected town wall collapsed in the mid-1850s. In 1854, a large portion of wall (20 feet high and 3–4 feet thick), and the embankment against which it was built fell into Leith Wynd between the High Street and Calton Road. A week later the Dean of Guild ordered the removal of a 150 feet stretch of the wall from that location. In 1856, a lightning strike appears to have been the cause of the collapse of a 40 to 50 feet stretch of the wall enclosing Greyfriars Kirkyard.|$|E
