5|$|Foxes {{and human}} beings lived close {{together}} in ancient Japan; this companionship gave rise to legends about the creatures. Kitsune have become closely associated with Inari, a Shinto kami or spirit, and serve as its messengers. This role has reinforced the fox's supernatural significance. The more tails a kitsune has—they may {{have as many as}} nine—the older, wiser, and more powerful it is. Because <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>potential</b> power and influence, some people make offerings to them as to a deity.|$|E
5|$|Serpins {{are also}} {{expressed}} by viruses {{as a way}} to evade the host's immune defense. In particular, serpins expressed by pox viruses, including cow pox (vaccinia) and rabbit pox (myxoma), are of interest because <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>potential</b> use as novel therapeutics for immune and inflammatory disorders as well as transplant therapy. Serp1 suppresses the TLR-mediated innate immune response and allows indefinite cardiac allograft survival in rats. Crma and Serp2 are both cross-class inhibitors and target both serine (granzyme B; albeit weakly) and cysteine proteases (caspase1 and caspase8). In comparison to their mammalian counterparts, viral serpins contain significant deletions of elements of secondary structure. Specifically, crmA lacks the D-helix as well as significant portions of the A- and E-helices.|$|E
5|$|The nymphs are {{eaten by}} {{a wide range of}} predators and form an {{important}} part of the aquatic food chain. Fish are among the main predators, picking nymphs off the bottom or ingesting them in the water column, and feeding on emerging nymphs and adults on the water surface. Carnivorous stonefly, caddisfly, alderfly and dragonfly larvae feed on bottom-dwelling mayfly nymphs, as do aquatic beetles, leeches, crayfish and amphibians. Besides the direct mortality caused by these predators, the behaviour <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>potential</b> prey is also affected, with the nymphs' growth rate being slowed by the need to hide rather than feed. The nymphs are highly susceptible to pollution and can be useful in the biomonitoring of water bodies. Once they have emerged, large numbers are preyed on by birds, bats and by other insects.|$|E

5|$|Mini Metro was {{developed}} by Dinosaur Polo Club, a two-man independent video game development studio based in New Zealand. It is the first game from the studio, {{which was founded in}} 2013 by brothers Peter and Robert Curry. They had previously worked at video game developer Sidhe, but left in 2006 to pursue a career in developing indie games. Following a series of abandoned projects, Peter Curry recognised {{that he would have to}} restrict the scope of his projects in order to complete them, and with hopes of releasing a finished product, the brothers set a number of constraints while proposing ideas for a prototype game. Minimising the amount of production art was a necessary restriction, as they had little experience in creating art assets. Likewise, they did not want the game's concept to rely on audio content, due to lack of skills in producing music. They also did not want to hand-build each level in the game. Imposing these constraints meant that they could discard most <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>potential</b> game ideas immediately, and led to them concentrating on concepts that involved procedurally generated levels and abstract visual styles.|$|E

25|$|In essence, the {{government}} is promising to protect lenders against 80% <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>potential</b> loss, and legitimatizes the investment by first having the DOE review their applications.

Roughly speaking, we prove that components of the ground states concentrate at the unique global minimum points <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>potentials.</b> Moreover, we prove the existence of ground states when the interaction is attractive...|$|R

25|$|However, Haufniensis {{mentions}} that anxiety {{is a way}} for humanity to be saved as well. Anxiety informs us of our choices, our self-awareness and personal responsibility, and brings us from a state of un-self-conscious immediacy to self-conscious reflection. (Jean-Paul Sartre calls these terms pre-reflexive consciousness and reflexive consciousness.) An individual becomes truly aware <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>potential</b> through the experience of dread. So, anxiety may be a possibility for sin, but anxiety can also be a recognition or realization of one's true identity and freedoms.|$|E
25|$|Sex {{determination}} in coral goby Gobiodon erythrospilus {{does not}} occur until juvenile gobies meet potential mates. Confronting a potential mate can be difficult for Gobiodon erythrospilus juveniles, since most coral resources, crucial for attracting mates, are occupied by pre-existing paired gobies. Juveniles can only meet potential mates when {{one member of the}} pre-existing pairs dies. Juveniles’ sexes are determined according to the sexes <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>potential</b> mates. When a juvenile goby meets a female, it becomes a male, and vice versa. This type of sex determination is referred to as socially influenced sex determination.|$|E
