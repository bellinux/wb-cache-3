5|$|On Saturday 1 July 1871, {{an opening}} banquet was {{attended}} by the Prime Minister William Gladstone, {{who was also a}} shareholder. The following Monday, Mansion House opened and the District began running its own trains. From this date, the two companies operated a joint inner circle service between Mansion House and Moorgate Street via South Kensington and Edgware Road that ran every ten minutes. This was supplemented by a District service every ten minutes between Mansion House and West Brompton, and Hammersmith & City Railway and Great Western Railway (GWR) suburban services between Edgware Road and Moorgate Street. The permissions for the railway east of Mansion House were allowed to lapse. At the <b>other</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> the District part of South Kensington station opened on 10 July 1871 and Earl's Court station opened on the West Brompton extension on 30 October 1871.|$|E
5|$|She {{subsequently}} {{appeared in}} several more Telugu films while making in-roads in the Hindi and Tamil industries. In 2007, Saran starred in Sivaji, the highest-grossing Tamil film at that time. She also gained critical acclaim {{for her role}} in the 2007 Bollywood film Awarapan. In 2008, Saran played the lead role in her first English film, the American-Indian co-production The <b>Other</b> <b>End</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Line.</b> Her following projects included popular films such as Kanthaswamy (2009) in Tamil and Pokkiri Raja (2010) in Malayalam— roles that established her as one of the leading actresses in the South Indian film industries. In 2012, she was cast in the British–Canadian film Midnight's Children, under the direction of Deepa Mehta, based on Salman Rushdie's Booker Prize-winning novel of the same name, for which she received international critical acclaim. She achieved further commercial success by starring in films such as Pavitra (2013) and Chandra (2013). In 2014, Saran starred in the critically acclaimed Telugu film Manam, which brought her accolades for her performance.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Saran was paired {{opposite}} Rajinikanth in S. Shankar's Sivaji. It was {{the most}} expensive film in Indian cinema {{and went on to}} become the highest grossing Tamil film to that point. The same year, she made a comeback to Hindi cinema with Mohit Suri's Awarapan, where she played a Muslim woman. Following that, she made her American cinema debut with James Dodson's The <b>Other</b> <b>End</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Line</b> (2008), in which she played an Indian woman who works in a call centre. Her subsequent releases include the Tamil films Kanthaswamy (2009) and Kutty (2010), and Pokkiri Raja (2010), which marked her debut in Malayalam cinema. In 2012, she starred in Deepa Mehta's Midnight's Children, an English adaptation of Salman Rushdie's novel of the same name. The following years, she played a princess in Roopa Iyer's period fantasy drama Chandra; the film was shot simultaneously in Kannada and Tamil. In 2014, she played dual roles in the Telugu drama film Manam. Saran received critical acclaim for her performance and was nominated for the Best Supporting Actress – Telugu Award at the 62nd Filmfare Awards South. The following year, she appeared opposite Ajay Devgan in Drishyam, the Hindi remake of the Malayalam film of the same name, which became a box office success.|$|E

A Lieutenant Gonzales on the <b>other</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> claims there's no one in their records called O'Brien.

25|$|On June 30, 1924, {{at what is}} now the <b>other</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> {{a subway}} line {{initially}} known as the 14th Street–Eastern District Line, usually shortened to 14th Street–Eastern Line, was opened running beneath 14th Street in Manhattan, from Sixth Avenue under the East River and through Williamsburg to Montrose Avenue and Bushwick Avenues. In 1924, a temporary connection was built from the Long Island Rail Road's Bushwick Yard that ran via Montrose Avenue and then connected to the BMT Canarsie Line under Bushwick Avenue just near the Montrose Avenue station. This was done in order for the delivery of new BMT Standard subway cars for the then isolated Canarsie Line of the New York City Subway. The first of the cars were delivered by this ramp on June 18, 1924.|$|E

25|$|When the Rochester and Pittsburgh Railroad {{took over}} the {{facilities}} of the Rochester and State Line Railroad, it acquired {{little in the way}} of usable maintenance assets. To remedy this deficiency, the R bought land in the Lincoln Park section of Rochester and, in 1881, built a machine shop for repair work. In 1882, they erected a roundhouse, today at the corner of West Avenue and Buffalo Road. (The turntable has been preserved by the Rochester chapter of the National Railway Historical Society, while the building itself has been converted for use by a scrap company.) This facility, with its fourteen-stall enginehouse, was the central shop for the entire line. The <b>other</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> (at the time) was in Salamanca, where the company built a smaller facility, including a two-stall enginehouse, a turntable, and the Ramsey Transfer mechanism needed for interchange with the Erie. Additional facilities were installed at Perry and Gainesville in the 1880s, along with more at Ashford Junction and Clarion Junction.|$|E
25|$|During a June 2, 1875, {{experiment}} by Bell and {{his assistant}} Thomas Watson, a receiver reed {{failed to respond to}} the intermittent current supplied by an electric battery. Bell told Watson, who was at the <b>other</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> to pluck the reed, thinking it had stuck to the pole of the magnet. Mr. Watson complied, and to his astonishment Bell heard a reed at his end of the line vibrate and emit the same timbre of a plucked reed, although there were no interrupted on-off-on-off currents from a transmitter to make it vibrate. A few more experiments soon showed that his receiver reed had been set in vibration by the magneto-electric currents induced in the line by the motion of the distant receiver reed in the neighborhood of its magnet. The battery current was not causing the vibration but was needed only to supply the magnetic field in which the reeds vibrated. Moreover, when Bell heard the rich overtones of the plucked reed, {{it occurred to him that}} since the circuit was never broken, all the complex vibrations of speech might be converted into undulating (modulated) currents, which in turn would reproduce the complex timbre, amplitude, and frequencies of speech at a distance.|$|E

500|$|The network {{consists}} of two lines: the original LRT Line1 (LRT-1) or Green Line, and the more modern LRT Line2 (LRT-2), or Blue Line. [...] The LRT-1 is aligned in a general north–south direction along over 17.2kilometers (10.7mi) of fully elevated track. [...] From Monumento it runs south above {{the hustle and bustle}} of Rizal and Taft Avenues along grade-separated concrete viaducts allowing exclusive right-of-way before ending in Baclaran. [...] A four-station east–west extension along Epifanio de los Santos Avenue that will connect Monumento to the North Avenue station was opened in 2010, although the common station is not yet constructed. [...] Including the extension's two recently opened stations, Balintawak and Roosevelt, the LRT-1 has twenty stations. [...] The LRT-2 or Line 2 {{consists of}} eleven stations in a general east–west direction over 13.8 kilometers (8.57mi) of mostly elevated track, with one station lying underground. [...] Commencing in Recto, the line follows a corridor defined by Claro M.

500|$|Operation Uranus, {{postponed}} until 17 November, {{was again}} postponed {{for two days}} when Soviet General Georgy Zhukov was told the air units allotted to the operation were not ready; it was finally launched on 19 November. Shortly after 5 a.m. Lieutenant Gerhard Stöck, posted with the Romanian IV Army Corps on the Kletskaya sector called Sixth Army headquarters housed in Golubinsky, offering intelligence on a pending attack which would occur after 05:00 that morning; however, because his call had come in after five and false alarms were common during this time, the duty officer on the <b>other</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> was not keen on waking the Army Chief of Staff, General Arthur Schmidt. Although Soviet commanders suggested postponing the bombardment due to poor visibility due to thick fog, front headquarters decided to proceed. At 07:20 Moscow time (05:20 German time) Soviet artillery commanders received the codeword [...] "Siren", prompting an 80-minute artillery bombardment directed almost entirely against the non-German Axis units protecting the German flanks. Some 3,500 guns opened up against the Third Romanian Army and the northern shoulder of the German Sixth Army's flank. Although thick fog prevented the Soviet artillery from correcting their aim, their weeks of preparation and ranging allowed them to lay down accurate fire on enemy positions along the front. The effect was devastating, as communication lines were breached, ammunition dumps destroyed and forward observation points shattered. Many Romanian personnel who survived the bombardment began to flee to the rear. Soviet heavy artillery aimed at Romanian artillery positions and second-echelon formations also caught the retreating Romanian soldiers.|$|E

2500|$|Elisha Gray, of Highland Park, Illinois (near Chicago) also {{devised a}} tone {{telegraph}} {{of this kind}} {{about the same time}} as La Cour. In Gray's tone telegraph, several vibrating steel reeds tuned to different frequencies interrupted the current, which at the <b>other</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> passed through electromagnets and vibrated matching tuned steel reeds near the electromagnet poles. Gray's 'harmonic telegraph,' with vibrating reeds, was used by the Western Union Telegraph Company. Since more than one set of vibration frequencies – that is to say, more than one musical tone – can be sent over the same wire simultaneously, the harmonic telegraph can be utilized as a 'multiplex' or many-ply telegraph, conveying several messages through the same wire at the same time. Each message can either be read by an operator by the sound, or from different tones read by different operators, or a permanent record can be made by the marks drawn on a ribbon of traveling paper by a Morse recorder.

2500|$|The leading {{elements}} of the First Brigade spread out to match their opponents' configuration, and for two hours the combatants fired at each other through blinding clouds of smoke. The 10th Connecticut relieved the exhausted, but not badly bloodied, 25th Massachusetts, but they too could not advance. No progress was made until the Second Brigade arrived, and its commander, Brig. Gen. Jesse L. Reno, ordered {{them to try to}} penetrate the [...] "impenetrable" [...] swamp on the Union left. Brig. Gen. John G. Foster then ordered two of his reserve regiments to do the same on the right. About this time, Brig. Gen. John G. Parke came up with the Third Brigade, and it was immediately sent to assist. Although they were not coordinated, the two flanking movements emerged from the swamp at nearly the same time. Reno ordered his 21st Massachusetts, 51st New York, and 9th New Jersey to attack. As they were firing on the Confederates, the 23rd Massachusetts, from the First Brigade, appeared on the <b>other</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line.</b> The defensive line began to crack; noting this, Foster ordered his remaining forces to attack.

2500|$|The first {{proposal}} for a line resembling the present day Main North Line was made in 1861. [...] A {{proposal for}} a line linking Christchurch and Blenheim was put before the Marlborough Provincial Council in April 1861. Later that year, the national government passed the Picton Railway Act in October, approving a line from Picton to the Wairau River {{under the auspices of}} the Marlborough Provincial Council. [...] However, the political authorisation did not translate into actual construction and no work on building the line was undertaken in the 1860s. In the 1870s the Canterbury Provincial Railways began to extend their [...] broad gauge network north from Christchurch through Kaiapoi and Rangiora, reaching Amberley in 1876 and Waipara in 1880 - by this stage, the Canterbury network had been re-gauged to the national gauge of [...] narrow gauge and acquired by the central government. At the <b>other</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> progress had been made in Marlborough, with a line opened between Blenheim and Picton.
