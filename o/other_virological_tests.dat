40|$|BACKGROUND: Acute disseminated {{encephalomyelitis}} (ADEM) is an autoimmune {{demyelinating disease}} of {{the central nervous system}} that is frequently preceded by an acute viral infection. This is the first reported case of ADEM associated with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 46 -year-old woman underwent a surgical procedure and received multiple blood transfusions, at which time serologic testing for HCV was negative. Fifty days later, she suddenly developed seizures, alteration of consciousness, right hemiparesis, hemianopsia, and urinary retention. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed symmetric multifocal changes on T 2 -weighted images in the cerebral gray and white matter and in the cerebellar white matter with some lesion enhancement after gadolinium administration. Blood testing showed a recent HCV infection with high titer of IgM early antigens and a strongly positive reaction for HCV RNA. All <b>other</b> microbiological and <b>virological</b> <b>test</b> results were negative both in serum and in cerebrospinal fluid. Treatment with high-dose dexamethasone was followed by a dramatic improvement of the clinical and magnetic resonance picture. Within a few months the patient recovered completely and there were no relapses during 2 years of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Infection with HCV is associated with several autoimmune neurological manifestations. It is recommended the patients with ADEM be screened for HCV...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{common cold}} {{questionnaire}} (CCQ) {{is used to}} discriminate those with and without a viral infection. Its usefulness in people with acute asthma is unknown. Our aim was to asess {{the ability of the}} CCQ to detect viral infection and to monitor recovery during a viral induced asthma exacerbation and confirmed by <b>virological</b> <b>testing.</b> Methodology/Principal Findings: We studied subjects (≥ 7 yrs) admitted to hospital with acute asthma and diagnosed as positive (n= 63), or negative to viral infection (n= 27) according to molecular and <b>virological</b> <b>testing</b> from respiratory samples. CCQ asthma history and asthma control questionaire were completed and repeated 4 - 6 weeks later. Sensitivity specificity, and response to change of the CCQ were assessed by receiver operator curve (ROC) analysis and effect size calculation respectively. The CCQ did not discriminate between viral and non-viral infection for subjects with asthma (sensitivity = 76. 2 %; specificity = 29. 6 %). ROC analysis could not differentiate between positive or negative virus in subjects with asthma. The CCQ had a large responce to change following recovery (effect size = 1. 01). 39 % of subjects recovering from viral exacerbation remained positive to <b>virological</b> <b>testing</b> at follow-up despite improvement in clinical symptoms. The CCQ reflected clinical improvement in these subjects, thus providing additional information to complement <b>virological</b> <b>testing.</b> Conclusions/Significance: The CCQ is a useful instrument for monitorong response to viral infection in people with asthma. Reliable differentiation between viral and non-viral asthma exacerbations was not achieved with the CCQ and requires specific <b>virological</b> <b>testing.</b> When combined with <b>virological</b> <b>testing,</b> the CCQ should be a useful outcome measure for evaluating therapies in viral-induced asthma...|$|R

40|$|Four virological {{markers of}} {{hepatitis}} C virus (HCV) infection are used clinically for management {{of patients with}} hepatitis C, namely the HCV genotype, HCV RNA, HCV core antigen, and antibody to HCV (anti-HCV). The diagnosis of acute and chronic hepatitis C is based on both anti-HCV detection using enzyme immunoassays (EIA) and HCV RNA detection using a sensitive molecular biology-based technique. <b>Other</b> <b>virological</b> tools, including HCV genotype determination and HCV RNA quantification, are now used to tailor treatment to the individual patient and to determine its efficacy.

(HEPATOLOGY 2002; 36 : S 65 -S 73.) Virological diagnosis and monitoring of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are based on 2 categories of laboratory test, namely serologic assays detecting specific antibody to HCV (anti-HCV) (indirect tests) and assays that can detect, quantify, or characterize the components of HCV viral particles, such as HCV RNA and core antigen (direct tests).

40|$|Despite {{expansion}} {{of services for}} prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT), about 700 infants acquire HIV every day. Early initiation of antiretroviral therapy for HIV-infected infants reduces mortality but requires diagnosis by <b>virological</b> <b>testing,</b> which is complex, expensive, and inaccessible in many settings. Little cost-eff ectiveness evidence exists about diff erent strategies to deliver early infant diagnosis services. Cost-eff ectiveness will vary depending on entry points for testing, underlying prevalences of HIV, PMTCT coverage, treatment availability, programme attrition, and other factors. Appropriate policy responses are therefore context-specifi c. In most cases, early infant diagnosis should be concentrated at entry points where underlying infant HIV prevalence is highest (eg, malnutrition wards). This strategy contrasts with the tendency at present to test mainly within PMTCT programmes. If testing is undertaken in PMTCT programmes with high coverage, addition of a <b>virological</b> <b>test</b> at birth might have advantages, including greater predictive value, earlier diagnosis, and better infant follow-up.

40|$|Abstract Background The current low {{access to}} <b>virological</b> <b>testing</b> to confirm chronic viraemic HCV {{infection}} in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) is limiting the rollout of hepatitis C (HCV) care. Existing tests are complex, costly and require sophisticated laboratory infrastructure. Diagnostic manufacturers need guidance on the optimal characteristics a <b>virological</b> <b>test</b> {{needs to have}} to ensure {{the greatest impact on}} HCV diagnosis and treatment in LMIC. Our objective was to develop a target product profile (TPP) for diagnosis of HCV viraemia using a global stakeholder consensus-based approach. Methods Based on the standardised process established to develop consensus-based TPPs, we followed five key steps. (i) Identifying key potential global stakeholders for consultation and input into the TPP development process. (ii) Informal priority-setting exercise with key experts to identify the needs that should be the highest priority for the TPP development; (iii) Defining the key TPP domains (scope, performance and operational characteristics and price). (iv) Delphi-like process with larger group of key stakeholder to facilitate feedback on the key TPP criteria and consensus building based on pre-defined consensus criteria. (v) A final consensus-gathering meeting for discussions around disputed criteria. A complementary values and preferences survey helped to assess trade-offs between different key characteristics. Results The following key attributes for the TPP for a test to confirm HCV viraemic infection were identified: The scope defined is for both HCV detection as well as confirmation of cure. The timeline of development for tests envisioned in the TPP is 5  years. The test should be developed for use by health-care workers or laboratory technicians with limited training in countries with a medium to high prevalence of HCV (1. 5 – 3. 5 % and > 3. 5 %) and in high-risk populations in low prevalence settings (< 1. 5 %). A clinical sensitivity at a minimum of 90 % is considered sufficient (analytical sensitivity of the equivalent of 3000  IU/ml), particularly if the test increases access to testing through an affordable price, increase ease-of-use and feasibility on capillary blood. Polyvalency would be optimal (i. e. ability to test for HIV and others). The only characteristic that full agreement could not be achieved on was the price for a <b>virological</b> <b>test.</b> Discussants felt that to reach the optimal target price substantial trade-offs had to be made (e. g. in regards to sensitivity and integration).

40|$|Abstract Background Lichtheimia corymbifera (previously Absidia corymbifera) is a {{filamentous}} zygomycetes {{belonging to}} the order Mucorales and to the family Lichtheimiaceae. Members of genus Lichtheimia spp. are cosmopolitan and ubiquitous in nature. Lichtheimia corymbifera is a recognized agent of diseases in man and animals. In cattle it causes abortion and mastitis. Three cases of bovine abortion occurred in a herd located in the Po Valley. Serological examinations were performed on fetal and mother's blood. One of the aborted fetus was referred to our laboratory. The paper describes the isolation and characterization of Lichtheimia corymbifera from a bovine aborted fetus. Methods Serological examinations were performed on fetal and mother's blood. Lesions on fetal tissues and placenta leaded the diagnostic suspect towards a mycotic aetiology. Tissues were then put in culture, {{and at the same}} time an histological examination was performed, together with bacteriological and <b>virological</b> <b>tests.</b> The isolate from placenta and fetal tissues was identified and characterized by PCR and RFLP, using the ITS region as a target sequence and AclI restriction site within the amplicon to distinguish Lichtheimia corymbifera among the other fungi. Results Serological, bacteriological and <b>virological</b> <b>tests</b> gave aspecific results. Histological examination evidenced numerous PAS positive hyphae within the necrotic cotiledons and numerous fungal nonseptate hyphae to the GMS stain. Colonies with typical morphological features of fungi grew up on Sabouraud agar from fetal skin and placenta. On the developed colonies the microscopic examination has shown a large number of nonseptate hyphae and sporangia consistent with Mucorales. PCR and RFLP allowed the identification of the isolate as Lichtheimia corymbifera.

40|$|The PRRS {{syndrome}} {{after its}} first official recognition in 1987 in the US extended rapidly, being {{present in all}} countries practicing intensive swine farming, Romania being included. Researches were conducted in 5 swine farms in western Romania in order to detect the antibodies against PRRS virus swine sera in sows and young swine. The seroprevalence of the PRRS syndrome in the above-mentioned farms has been established by serum tests sampled from young swine- 3 months of age- and from pregnant and non-pregnant sows during 6 -month period. The detection of antibodies against PRRS virus was performed by an enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay kit. To confirm the PRRS syndrome there were conducted epidemiologic, clinical, anatomic-pathological and <b>virological</b> <b>tests.</b> The serological test established the seroprevalence of the PRRS syndrome by cross investigations performed at 6 -month intervals {{for each of the}} 5 swine farms included in the study. In young swine the average of seroprevalence for both sampling was high, 60. 27 % an...|$|R
