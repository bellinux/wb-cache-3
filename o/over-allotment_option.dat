40|$|ABSTRACT TWO ESSAYS ON INVESTOR SENTIMENT AND EQUITY OFFERINGS BY HSIN-HUI CHIU May 2, 2006 Committee Chair: Dr. Jason T. Greene Major Department: Finance Using monthly open-end {{mutual fund}} flows {{as a proxy}} for {{investor}} sentiment, I am able to examine the impact of sentiment on IPO volume and underpricing. I find that issuers’ filing decisions are significantly affected by the predicted future sentiment around the expected IPO dates. Furthermore, sentiment has an impact on the final offer price setting and <b>over-allotment</b> <b>options</b> exercised. While previous research documents IPO cycles with respect to other proxies for investor sentiment, I am able to examine IPO cycles and underpricing with respect to sentiment along with investor risk preferences. I hypothesize that a going public firm will try to issue its IPO when investor risk preferences are favorable to the firm’s own risk characteristics. Empirical results based on 5, 661 initial public offerings between 1986 and 2004 are consistent with my hypotheses that issuers not only time the market with sentiment in general, but also attempt to incorporate investor risk preferences into their going public decisions. Furthermore, underpricing is more severe when firms issue equity during months with large inflows into equity mutual funds. In my second essay, I find that SEO firms appear to time market efficiently because of the shorter filing periods compared to the average 2 - 3 months of the IPOs. Also, sentiment not only affects a SEO offer price setting but also affects the <b>over-allotment</b> <b>options</b> exercised. I examine two subgroups of the SEO samples: shelf registration and non-shelf SEOs. I find that shelf-registered SEOs incorporate investor sentiment into offering price to a greater degree compared to regular SEOs. Lastly I find that investor risk preference plays a role in firms’ decision to file prospectuses with the SEC. In other words, firms rationally decide the timing of filing based on the predicted investor preference and try to match firm characteristics with investor preference around the expected SEO date...|$|R
40|$|IPOs on the EuroNMs {{have shown}} very high underpricing. The {{majority}} of these IPOs possess specific characteristics such as lock-up agreements, venture-capital financing, ownership by the underwriter and <b>over-allotment</b> <b>options.</b> We study how these characteristics influence the underpricing of firms listed on the two largest EuroNM stock exchanges, the Neuer Markt of Germany and the Nouveau Marché of France. We find that the high underpricing in these two markets - contrary to the evidence on the US - is not driven by insiders' selling behaviour. However, the large underpricing {{is caused by the}} high degree of riskiness of the issuing firms and by the partial adjustment phenomenon of offer prices to compensate institutional investors for the truthful revelation of their demand for the shares. In contrast, venture-capital involvement does not affect underpricing. For France, lock-up agreements act as substitutes to underpricing, but not so for Germany. We also explore the reasons for the large difference in underpricing between the German and the French IPOs: German firms are more underpriced because they are more risky, have larger price revisions, have less stringent VC lock-up contracts and mostly go public during the hot issue period of 1999 - 2000 when the general level of underpricing in all IPO markets is substantially higher. ...|$|R

40|$|We use {{a sample}} of JASDAQ IPOs to {{study the effects of}} public {{information}} on offer price formation, initial returns, and long-run returns. Underwriters begin reporting anticipated offer prices of Japanese IPOs at an earlier point than in the US. The observable portion of the price formation process begins with an original price that is established before the roadshow, continues through establishment of the filing range, and concludes with the offer price. Neither price adjustment [...] from the original price to the midpoint of the range, or from the midpoint to the offer price [...] fully reflects public information from as long as four months before the IPO. As in the US, price adjustments are asymmetric. Prices adjust more fully in response to negative than to positive public information. It appears that adjustments are limited by an implicit agreement between the issuer and the underwriter that originates before marketing of the offer begins. The agreement reflects an expectation that the offer price will be based on the relative market values of public companies up to four months before the IPO. We find that one-year aftermarket returns are significantly lower when initial returns are high. Initial returns under-adjust relative to public information that is revealed before the IPO and the under-adjustment is substantially reversed in the aftermarket. The evidence connects the implicit contracting theory with the argument that offer prices are based partly on expected value at the time of early price discussions. As a result, it can explain episodes of substantial underpricing that are sustained over periods of several months. The paper also documents that <b>over-allotment</b> <b>options</b> affect price formation by enabling issuers to select significantly narrower filing ranges and t...|$|R

40|$|Prior Hong Kong-based {{studies have}} dealt {{predominantly}} with Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) configured in a single-tranche offer form (see McGuinness (1992); Cheng et al. (2004); Fung et al. (2004); Vong (2006) {{for the main}} board; and Vong and Zhao (2008) for the Growth Enterprise Market (GEM)). This study revisits the issue by examining a recent set of IPOs utlizing a dual-tranche offer form, in which a local retail offer {{is accompanied by a}} book-built placing. This mechanism utilizes a number of features ('claw-backs', adjustable offer prices and over-allotment options) which allow for important supply and demand adjustments during the offer period. The absence of such features within the single-tranche offer form, which prevailed right up {{to the end of the}} 1990 s, suggests radically different pricing characteristics across single- and dual-tranche regimes. Assessment is first made of ex-ante type variables, constructed using publicly available data prior to the close in retail applications. Average retail subscription rates on issues immediately prior to a given offering, the clustering of IPOs and the performance of the overall Hong Kong secondary market in the period surrounding the retail application window all serve as significant factors in explaining both IPO returns and excess subscription demand. Mainland PRC-incorporation (H-share issuers), advising sponsorship quality, an issuer's propensity to disclose a forecast of earnings and price-to-earnings levels also appear significant. In terms of ex-post variables, both IPO underpricing and subscription demand were positively related to <b>over-allotment</b> <b>option</b> exercise and the SD of post-listing returns. Significantly, there is no evidence to support the notion that the incidence and/or size of subsequent seasoned equity issues helps to promote IPO underpricing. This is investigated by examining equity capital-raising activities over a 36 -month post-listing period. Given the mixed evidence to date (across markets and studies) on this issue, the results documented in this study provide an additional important data point to suggest that seasoned equity issuance is of second-order importance in relation to IPO underpricing. Finally, a measurement form for excess demand was also developed to reflect the idiosyncratic nature of the dual-tranche allotment mechanism. Subscription numbers were evaluated in relation to retail tranche supply adjustments, arising from 'claw-backs' and employee share allotments. Consistent with Vong's (2006) earlier work on simple IPO subscription rates, after-market volatility appeared much more strongly tied to excess demand than to initial return levels. A number of analogues of excess demand, notably <b>over-allotment</b> <b>option</b> exercise and the proportion of shares allotted to retail applicants subscribing at the minimum order level, were significant in explaining initial returns. Finally, and consistent with Hanley (1993), higher initial return levels were apparent in issues priced towards the upper end of the offer price range. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this short}} paper, the general {{characteristics}} surrounding the voluntary release of prospectus earnings forecasts are examined for {{a sample of}} recently organised initial public offerings in Hong Kong. In terms of forecast accuracy, results, relative to earlier Hong Kong-based studies [Chan et al. (1996), Jaggi (1997), Cheng and Firth (2000) and Chen, Firth and Krishnan (2001) ], point to an even tighter distribution of forecast errors than {{was the case for}} IPOs in the early to mid 1990 s. A more sophisticated primary market- in which dual-tranche offerings, many with variable offer prices and over-allotment options, dominate- allied to improved corporate governance practice is the likely reason for this outcome. • Post-listing deviations from prospectus forecasts are also noted to be positively related to the percentage of equity retained in the newly listed firms by pre-listing stakeholders {{as well as to the}} utilisation of over-allotment options by issue underwriters. Finally, the importance of underpricing to the disclosure of IPO earnings forecasts- as signalled in the work of Jog and McConomy (2003) for Canadian IPOs- is partially reflected through the <b>over-allotment</b> <b>option</b> exercise decision variable. The latter is strongly and positively related to both the incidence of a prospectus earnings forecast and the magnitude of IPO underpricing. 1 This paper is for pure fact-finding and research purposes, and is not an attempt to comment on the developments of any markets/ companies or interpret the policies concerned.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this case study is to empirically {{investigate}} the phenomenon of initial public offerings (IPOs) by applying it to Tencent Holdings Limited (Tencent). Tencent is a Chinese internet and telecommunications value-added service provider that launched its IPO on 16 June 2004. Tencent is Chinaâ€™s largest internet firm and Asiaâ€™s most valuable brand, boasting a current market capitalization of HK$ 1. 224 trillion (US$ 157. 9 billion). The origins of Tencentâ€™s success story trace back to its IPO decision, an important topic {{in the field of}} finance. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the structure of Tencentâ€™s IPO, its listing decision and determining an intrinsic value of its IPO shares on its listing date. It was found that Tencentâ€™s IPO extensively relates to academic literature surrounding IPO under-pricing and valuing unlisted companies. The results reveal that Tencent left money on the table by underpricing its offer shares and exercised its <b>over-allotment</b> <b>option</b> as a form of price stabilization. It was further found that Tencentâ€™s underpricing was not influenced by competitor IPOs but rather by stringent IPO allotment policies and other signals of firm quality. It was also discovered that there might have been bias in the allocation of Tencentâ€™s shares. An investigation into Tencentâ€™s listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEx) revealed that while its competitors listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market, there was a clear correlation between Tencentâ€™s operations and corporate structure to the HKEx listing and regulatory requirements. The decisive factors included domiciling in the British Virgin Island and Cayman Islands, the cost of listing on the HKEx Main Board versus the NASDAQ National Market as well as the effects of US GAAP and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The study was concluded with the application of a relative valuation and discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation. The relative valuation estimated a price range of HK$ 14. 40 -HK$ 18. 72 for Tencentâ€™s IPO shares, while the DCF estimated the intrinsic value of the shares to be HK$ 18. 68. The analysis was comprehensive and in-depth and suggests that Tencentâ€™s IPO shares were five times undervalued and were offered to shareholders at a deep discount...|$|E
40|$|This study investigates a {{well-documented}} enigma in {{the finance}} literature, the aftermarket behavior of closed-end fund {{initial public offerings}} (IPOs). Many models with rational agents attribute the underpricing of industrial IPOs to information asymmetry between the IPO issues and the investing public. Since closed-end funds typically do not have pre-existing assets or proprietary rights, there is little information asymmetry about their asset valuation. Consequently, these models suggest that closed-end funds should exhibit less underpricing than industrial IPOs. However, information asymmetry theories cannot explain why closed-end funds are successfully brought to market overpriced. Specifically, closed-end funds are overpriced at issue relative to their net asset values (NAVs) due to substantial underwriting fees that average approximately 8 % of total issue size. The study investigates these anomalies and describes regulatory and institutional mechanisms {{that contribute to the}} pattern of aftermarket returns. The authors perform an intraday analysis of aftermarket trades and quotes in the first 100 days of trading. They find that underwriting arrangements, identified during discussions with underwriters, help to explain not only the their primary observations, but also several unusual patterns in the transactions data. The authors show {{that the vast majority of}} volume in the first four weeks of trading is seller-initiated. Since short selling is not possible during this time period, the selling imbalance confirms the presence of flippers. However, these imbalances do not immediately translate into price declines. As the number of issues that are stabilized declines over time, the proportion of issues trading at unencumbered, market-determined prices increases. The authors also provide evidence that underwriters manage the cost of stabilizing by creating a net short position in the number of shares issued during the pre-market. Selling imbalance in the first few trading days has predictive power for the timing of subsequent price decline: the faster the short position is covered through stabilizing purchases, the sooner the price drops. Funds that exercise the <b>over-allotment</b> <b>option</b> experience longer stabilization periods. The authors document that seller-initiated trades are both larger and more profitable than buyer-initiated trades in the after market period. Small investors who buy shares in the aftermarket engage in open market transactions that they believe are at unencumbered prices. The authors believe that their findings support a marketing hypothesis for closed-end fund IPOs. To protect their reputation and improve the likelihood of a successful offer, lead underwriters promise to stabilize prices in the aftermarket, essentially granting free put options with a strike price equal to the offer price. The stabilization bid provides the opportunity for some syndicate members to sell large blocks to flippers during the pre-issue period. The number and size of sell orders in the first few days of trading show that a sizable number of these traders exercise this options and flip their shares back to the syndicate. The size of the trades suggest that they are small, retail customers. The legality of this scenario appears to be within the guidelines of current securities regulation The authors speculate that flippers are wiling to participate because of other inducements they receive through their ongoing relationships with underwriters. On the cost side, underwriters may incur significant costs from flipping and protracted stabilization. However, the cost of stabilization may well be offset by the benefits of assuring a successful initial distribution. Small investors face substantial information processing costs and may be highly susceptible to "marketing" tactics. The authors believe their findings raise questions about the adequacy of current disclosure rules for IPOs, and the propriety of securities regulation that permit short term stabilization in closed-end fund IPO aftermarkets. They also suggest that similar patterns of selling pressure, price stabilization, and asymmetric behavior between large and small trades may be found in two other securities - master limited partnerships and real estate investment trusts. ...|$|E
