25|$|Pavlova is made {{by beating}} egg whites (and {{sometimes}} salt) to a very stiff consistency before folding in caster sugar, vinegar or another acid (e.g. cream <b>of</b> <b>tartar</b> or lemon juice), cornflour, and sometimes vanilla essence, and slow-baking the mixture, similar to meringue.|$|E
25|$|Many {{forms of}} baking powder contain sodium {{bicarbonate}} combined with calcium acid phosphate, sodium aluminium phosphate or cream <b>of</b> <b>tartar.</b> Baking soda is alkaline; the acid used in baking powder avoids a metallic taste when the chemical change during baking creates sodium carbonate.|$|E

25|$|Agents {{are added}} to {{suppress}} the tendency of toothpaste to dry into a powder. Included are various sugar alcohols, such as glycerol, sorbitol, or xylitol, or related derivatives, such as 1,2-propylene glycol and polyethyleneglycol. Strontium chloride or potassium nitrate is included in some toothpastes to reduce sensitivity. Sodium polyphosphate is added to minimize the formation <b>of</b> <b>tartar.</b>|$|E
25|$|Hydrolysis {{breaks the}} glycosidic bond {{converting}} sucrose into glucose and fructose. Hydrolysis is, however, so slow that solutions of sucrose can sit {{for years with}} negligible change. If the enzyme sucrase is added, however, the reaction will proceed rapidly. Hydrolysis can also be accelerated with acids, such as cream <b>of</b> <b>tartar</b> or lemon juice, both weak acids. Likewise, gastric acidity converts sucrose to glucose and fructose during digestion, the bond between them being an acetal bond {{which can be broken}} by an acid.|$|E
25|$|Teeth {{cleaning}} (also {{known as}} prophylaxis, literally a preventive {{treatment of a}} disease) is a procedure for the removal <b>of</b> <b>tartar</b> (mineralized plaque) that may develop even with careful brushing and flossing, especially {{in areas that are}} difficult to reach in routine toothbrushing. It is often done by a dental hygienist. Professional cleaning includes tooth scaling and tooth polishing and debridement if too much tartar has accumulated. This involves the use of various instruments or devices to loosen and remove deposits from the teeth.|$|E

25|$|In cooking, sodium bicarbonate, {{referred}} to as baking soda, is primarily used in baking as a leavening agent. It reacts with acidic components in batters, releasing carbon dioxide, which causes expansion of the batter and forms the characteristic texture and grain in pancakes, cakes, quick breads, soda bread, and other baked and fried foods. Acidic compounds that induce this reaction include phosphates, cream <b>of</b> <b>tartar,</b> lemon juice, yogurt, buttermilk, cocoa and vinegar. Baking soda may be used together with sourdough, which is acidic, making a lighter product with a less acid taste.|$|E
25|$|Barrel {{burnishing}} {{is a type}} of barreling {{where no}} cutting action is desired. The goal is to reduce minute irregularities and produce a clean, smooth surface. The parts are usually tumbled against themselves or with steel balls, shot, rounded-end pins, or ballcones to achieve this. It is also usually a wet process that uses water and a lubricant or cleaning agent, such as soap or cream <b>of</b> <b>tartar.</b> The barrel is not loaded more than half full and if media is used then a 2:1 ratio of media to parts is maintained to keep the parts from rubbing.|$|E
25|$|Schistosomiasis is endemic in Egypt, {{exacerbated}} by the country's dam and irrigation projects along the Nile. From the late 1950s through the early 1980s, infected villagers were treated with repeated injections <b>of</b> <b>tartar</b> emetic. Epidemiological evidence suggests that this campaign unintentionally contributed {{to the spread of}} hepatitis C via unclean needles. Egypt has the world's highest hepatitis C infection rate, and the infection rates in various regions of the country closely track the timing and intensity of the anti-schistosomiasis campaign. From ancient times to the early 20th century, schistosomiasis' symptom of blood in the urine was seen as a male version of menstruation in Egypt and was thus viewed as a rite of passage for boys.|$|E

25|$|A {{third way}} is electrodialysis: an {{electric}} current between two plates attracts the wine ions and eliminates them. However, this solution not only acts on tartaric acid but also other compounds especially potassium {{which is responsible}} for the formation of insoluble bitartrate and also modifies the organoleptic qualities. However, it does allow a definitive stabilization. Reports of high tartaric stability in white wines matured on lees has led to research in this area. A protein from the hydrolyzate of the yeast (mannoproteins) allows salts <b>of</b> <b>tartar</b> to keep their solubility. The addition of this compound industrially permits a good quality stabilization. This solution is the least expensive for energy and refrigeration equipment and does not alter the aromatic perception of wine. Nevertheless, tests conducted by the Cooperative Institute for Wine of Languedoc-Roussillon did not show conclusive effectiveness.|$|E

500|$|Remains {{of human}} teeth were {{analysed}} {{for evidence of}} arrested development and decay. Arrested development implies periods of nutritional shortage, which could indicate failed harvests. Decay implies either periods of food shortage, or a diet consisting of high proportions of carbohydrate or softer cooked meat, or both. Dental analyses {{showed no sign of}} periods of decay or arrested development, even where there was [...] "considerable wear", indicating a lifestyle that was not dependent on farming cereals. The 1887 bone report notes the [...] "good condition of the teeth". Whittle and Wysocki noted the [...] "slight" [...] presence <b>of</b> <b>tartar,</b> and that only one tooth had been lost before death, a mandibular incisor.|$|E
500|$|In {{the period}} {{following}} the Napoleonic wars, the new city of Odessa emerged as Russia's southern capital with a vibrant cosmopolitan society centred on {{a handful of}} Russian aristocrats and Polish ladies such as Zofia Potocka and Karolina Rzewuska. According to Filipp Vigel, the viceroy's court in Odessa looked like a [...] "small capital of an imperial fürst". While many Neoclassical buildings appeared in Odessa, the Crimea (or Taurica, as it was then better known) was still perceived as a wild, exotic hinterland. The mid-1820s saw the appearance of highly popular Romantic works celebrating its rugged beauty, such as Alexander Pushkin's poem The Fountain of Bakhchisaray and Adam Mickiewicz's Crimean Sonnets. Both poets were fascinated with Lord Byron's Oriental romances and pictured the Crimea as an exotic land <b>of</b> <b>Tartar</b> Muslim traditions which had flourished in the Khanate of Crimea until its demise in 1783.|$|E
