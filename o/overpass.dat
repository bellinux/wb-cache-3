5|$|Another {{commonly}} held misconception is that highway overpasses provide adequate shelter from tornadoes. This belief is partly inspired by widely circulated video captured during the 1991 tornado outbreak near Andover, Kansas, where a news crew {{and several other}} people take shelter under an <b>overpass</b> on the Kansas Turnpike and safely ride out a tornado as it passes by. However, a highway <b>overpass</b> is a dangerous place during a tornado, and the subjects of the video remained safe due to an unlikely combination of events: the storm in question was a weak tornado, the tornado did not directly strike the <b>overpass,</b> and the <b>overpass</b> itself was of a unique design. Due to the Venturi effect, tornadic winds are accelerated in the confined space of an <b>overpass.</b> Indeed, in the 1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak of May 3, 1999, three highway overpasses were directly struck by tornadoes, and {{at each of the}} three locations there was a fatality, along with many life-threatening injuries. By comparison, during the same tornado outbreak, more than 2000 homes were completely destroyed, with another 7000 damaged, and yet only a few dozen people died in their homes.|$|E
5|$|On August 16, 1987, Northwest Airlines Flight 255 crashed after {{attempting}} {{to take off}} from Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport, killing all but one passenger upon exploding at the I-94 <b>overpass</b> over Middlebelt Road; that <b>overpass</b> was not damaged in the crash. The freeway was closed until August 18, and a memorial was later installed near the interchange between I-94 and Middlebelt Road.|$|E

5|$|The SJTA {{revealed}} {{plans for}} a major road improvement project that would link the Atlantic City International Airport directly to the Atlantic City Expressway, with construction beginning as early as 2013. The plan includes new ramps with two overpasses over the expressway. The road would connect Amelia Earhart Boulevard with an <b>overpass</b> above Airport Circle. Plans also call for building a service road with another <b>overpass</b> that would provide access to Delilah Road. Another project involves the installation of an <b>overpass</b> {{at the end of}} Amelia Earhart Boulevard next to the entrance to the FAA tech center. The proposed roadway would intrude upon a small section of a mobile home park and land owned by Egg Harbor Township.|$|E

5|$|All the {{original}} World War II era <b>overpasses</b> dating {{back in the}} 1940s and 1950s built between Whitby and Oshawa will gradually be replaced with new <b>overpasses</b> as part of modern highway safety standards and to allow highway widening sometime in the future.|$|R
50|$|Bridges and <b>overpasses</b> can be {{especially}} dangerous. Black ice forms first on bridges and <b>overpasses</b> because air can circulate both {{above and below the}} surface of the elevated roadway when the ambient temperature drops, causing the bridge pavement temperature to fall more rapidly.|$|R

The construction is designed as a body in itself, separated from the main building by a path and connected to it by a covered <b>overpass,</b> a configuration that has come down to us intact. The contribution of Cairano, who at that point returned to the Loggia after at least five years of a stellar career elsewhere, is the portal to the ground floor of the annex and in some ornamentation on the <b>overpass.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{new type}} of {{engineering}} constructions that is mobile <b>overpasses</b> is developed. The offered mobile <b>overpasses</b> are applied for elimination the arisen traffic jams along city highways, when repairing city municipal networks, during emergency situations, etc. They allow to carry out continuous movement of motor transport through various obstacles: traffic jams, ditches and trenches formed because of underground repair work or emergency situations (earthquakes, floods, etc.). The issues of development theoretical bases of calculation and design of mobile <b>overpasses</b> are considered...|$|R

40|$|The Seoul Metropolitan Government (SMG) {{recently}} considered eliminating some useless <b>overpasses</b> {{that had}} once {{played a significant role}} in maintaining continuous traffic flow but soon lost their original, positive function and became an environmental burden. SMG is in the process of identifying such types of <b>overpasses</b> out of 22 installations. The aim of this study was to develop a definite criterion that can be used to identify <b>overpasses</b> to be eliminated. All of the 22 existing <b>overpasses</b> were investigated in terms of functionality, structural stability and conflicts with other sustainable policies of SMG. Functionality was interpreted based on the traffic efficiency, environmental amenity and traffic safety. The weights of these functionality sub-factors were derived from a pair-wise comparison technique used in analytic hierarchy process (AHP) methodology. The remaining two aspects were not subdivided but evaluated directly. Final judgments were made based on the three aspects with the assistance of well-known classification methodologies such as K-means and a support vector machine (SVM). As a result, five <b>overpasses</b> in Seoul were identified to be eliminable. ...|$|R
5|$|In 1989, an <b>overpass</b> {{being built}} at MD198 over the B–W Parkway {{just east of}} Laurel {{collapsed}} during rush hour, injuring fourteen motorists and construction workers. The incident was blamed on faulty scaffolding used to support the uncompleted span. On July 9, 2005, a sinkhole opened beneath the parkway at a construction site, leading to the complete closure of the northbound roadway. The sinkhole was filled with concrete {{to shore up the}} roadbed and prevent further collapse; the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers attempted to expedite repairs, but the route remained closed until the next day. On August 24, 2007, both directions of the parkway were closed when chunks of concrete fell from the <b>overpass</b> at MD193 (Greenbelt Road) onto the northbound lanes.|$|E

5|$|Until 2008, signs at exit43A in {{downtown}} Cumberland labeled the exit as {{providing access to}} WV28 Alt. Because of this, many truckers used this exit to get to WV28. This created problems on WV28 Alt. in Ridgeley, West Virginia, as trucks became stuck under a low railroad <b>overpass,</b> blocking traffic through Ridgeley. To reduce this problem, the Maryland State Highway Administration removed references to WV28 Alt. from guide signs for exit43A and placed warning signs in Cumberland and on I-68 approaching Cumberland advising truckers to instead use exit43B to MD51, which allows them to connect to WV28 via Virginia Avenue, bypassing the low <b>overpass</b> in Ridgeley.|$|E

5|$|Within the London area, traffic volumes are {{expected}} to increase considerably, leading to poor highway conditions. The province has put in place an extensive plan to widen and reconstruct the London corridor between 2006 and 2021. This included building a new interchange with Wonderland Road which opened in November 2015 to help improve access to Highway401 westbound from the city's southwest end and involved replacing the Westminster Drive <b>overpass</b> to allow the highway to be widened. The Westminster Drive <b>overpass</b> was demolished on July 5, 2014.|$|E

5|$|As {{with the}} rest of the Hudson Line, the Scarborough station became a Penn Central station once the New York Central and Pennsylvania Railroads merged in 1968. Penn Central's {{continuous}} financial despair throughout the 1970s forced them to turn over their commuter service to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The station and the railroad were turned over to Conrail in 1976, and eventually became part of the MTA's Metro-North Railroad in 1983. In 2007, the MTA overhauled the station, installing new systems such as platforms, canopies, shelters, enclosed staircases, lighting, and benches. The station's <b>overpass</b> was demolished and a replacement was built with elevators on either side. The new <b>overpass</b> was designed in a less modern style and now has glass-sided elevators. During the construction, Metro-North built a temporary wooden station to the station's south.|$|E
50|$|Railway <b>overpasses</b> {{are used}} to replace level {{crossings}} (at-grade crossings) as a safer alternative. Using <b>overpasses</b> allows for unobstructed rail traffic to flow without conflicting with vehicular and pedestrian traffic.

In place of the standard heavier aggregate, lighter blast furnace slag, at half the weight, was substituted.|$|E
