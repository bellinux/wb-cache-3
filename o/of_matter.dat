5|$|Each {{particle}} <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> has {{a corresponding}} antimatter particle {{with the opposite}} electrical charge. Thus, the positron is a positively charged antielectron and the antiproton is a negatively charged equivalent of a proton. When a matter and corresponding antimatter particle meet, they annihilate each other. Because of this, along with an imbalance between the number <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> and antimatter particles, the latter are rare in the universe. The first causes of this imbalance are not yet fully understood, although theories of baryogenesis may offer an explanation. As a result, no antimatter atoms have been discovered in nature. However, in 1996 the antimatter counterpart of the hydrogen atom (antihydrogen) was synthesized at the CERN laboratory in Geneva.|$|E

5|$|General {{relativity}} is {{the geometric}} theory of gravitation published by Albert Einstein in 1915 {{and the current}} description of gravitation in modern physics. It {{is the basis of}} current cosmological models of the Universe. General relativity generalizes special relativity and Newton's law of universal gravitation, providing a unified description of gravity as a geometric property of space and time, or spacetime. In particular, the curvature of spacetime {{is directly related to the}} energy and momentum of whatever matter and radiation are present. The relation is specified by the Einstein field equations, a system of partial differential equations. In general relativity, the distribution <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> and energy determines the geometry of spacetime, which in turn describes the acceleration <b>of</b> <b>matter.</b> Therefore, solutions of the Einstein field equations describe the evolution of the Universe. Combined with measurements of the amount, type, and distribution <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> in the Universe, the equations of general relativity describe the evolution of the Universe over time.|$|E

5|$|Outer {{space is}} the closest known {{approximation}} to a perfect vacuum. It has effectively no friction, allowing stars, planets and moons to move freely along their ideal orbits. However, even the deep vacuum of intergalactic space is not devoid <b>of</b> <b>matter,</b> as it contains a few hydrogen atoms per cubic meter. By comparison, the air humans breathe contains about 1025 molecules per cubic meter. The low density <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> in outer space means that electromagnetic radiation can travel great distances without being scattered: the mean free path of a photon in intergalactic space is about 1023km, or 10 billion light years. In spite of this, extinction, which is the absorption and scattering of photons by dust and gas, {{is an important factor}} in galactic and intergalactic astronomy.|$|E

Because the FLRW metric assumes a uniform distribution of mass and energy, it applies to our universe only on large scales—local concentrations <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> such as our galaxy are gravitationally bound and as such do not experience the large-scale expansion of space.|$|E

5|$|The {{proportions}} {{of all types}} <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> and energy have changed over {{the history of the}} Universe. Today, ordinary matter, which includes atoms, stars, galaxies, and life, accounts for only 4.9% of the contents of the Universe. The present overall density of this type <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> is very low, roughly 4.5 × 10−31 grams per cubic centimetre, corresponding to a density of the order of only one proton for every four cubic meters of volume. The nature of both dark energy and dark matter is unknown. Dark matter, a mysterious form <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> that has not yet been identified, accounts for 26.8% of the contents. Dark energy, which is the energy of empty space and is causing the expansion of the Universe to accelerate, accounts for the remaining 68.3% of the contents.|$|E
5|$|A {{hierarchical}} structure <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> began to form from minute {{variations in the}} mass density of space. Matter accumulated in the densest regions, forming clouds of gas and the earliest stars, the Population III stars. These massive stars triggered the reionization process and {{are believed to have}} created many of the heavy elements in the early Universe, which, through nuclear decay, create lighter elements, allowing the cycle of nucleosynthesis to continue longer.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} theoretical {{idea that}} {{plays a role}} in M-theory is supersymmetry. This is a mathematical relation that exists in certain physical theories between a class of particles called bosons and a class of particles called fermions. Roughly speaking, fermions are the constituents <b>of</b> <b>matter,</b> while bosons mediate interactions between particles. In theories with supersymmetry, each boson has a counterpart which is a fermion, and vice versa. When supersymmetry is imposed as a local symmetry, one automatically obtains a quantum mechanical theory that includes gravity. Such a theory is called a supergravity theory.|$|E

I proposed, first, that {{the degree to which}} elders engage in both informal interpersonal relationships and formal social affiliations are directly and positively related to psychological well-being; second, that these relationships are mediated through two elements of the sense <b>of</b> <b>mattering.</b> Contrary to expectations, it was found that states <b>of</b> <b>mattering</b> do not operate as mediating mechanisms linking social engagement and depression. Instead, the findings suggest that perceptions <b>of</b> <b>mattering</b> play roles independent of social engagement in promoting psychological well-being. Further conceptual and methodological development of the concept <b>of</b> <b>mattering</b> are needed to better understand the ways in which it is linked to social relationships and how these possible interlinked factors promote optimal health outcomes...|$|R
5|$|Arguably {{the first}} {{exposition}} of empirical materialism {{in the history}} of philosophy is in the Cārvāka school (also called Lokāyata). The Cārvāka school rejected the existence of anything but matter (which they defined as being made up of the four elements), including God and the soul. Therefore, they held that even consciousness was nothing but a construct made up of atoms. A section of the Cārvāka school believed in a material soul made up of air or breath, but since this also was a form <b>of</b> <b>matter,</b> it was not said to survive death.|$|E
5|$|As the {{universe}} cooled, the rest mass energy density <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> came to gravitationally dominate {{that of the}} photon radiation. After about 379,000 years, the electrons and nuclei combined into atoms (mostly hydrogen); hence the radiation decoupled from matter and continued through space largely unimpeded. This relic radiation {{is known as the}} cosmic microwave background radiation. The chemistry of life may have begun shortly after the Big Bang, 13.8 billion years ago, during a habitable epoch when {{the universe}} was only 10–17 million years old.|$|E
5|$|Astronomical {{observations}} of the cosmological expansion rate allow the total amount <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> in the universe to be estimated, although {{the nature of that}} matter remains mysterious in part. About 90% of all matter appears to be dark matter, which has mass (or, equivalently, gravitational influence), but does not interact electromagnetically and, hence, cannot be observed directly. There is no generally accepted description of this new kind <b>of</b> <b>matter,</b> within the framework of known particle physics or otherwise. Observational evidence from redshift surveys of distant supernovae and measurements of the cosmic background radiation also show that the evolution of our universe is significantly influenced by a cosmological constant resulting in an acceleration of cosmic expansion or, equivalently, by a form of energy with an unusual equation of state, known as dark energy, the nature of which remains unclear.|$|E
