25|$|A charged object brought {{close to}} an {{electrically}} neutral object causes a separation of charge within the neutral object. Charges of the same polarity are repelled and charges of the <b>opposite</b> <b>polarity</b> are attracted. As the force due to the interaction of electric charges falls off rapidly with increasing distance, {{the effect of the}} closer (<b>opposite</b> <b>polarity)</b> charges is greater and the two objects feel a force of attraction. The effect is most pronounced when the neutral object is an electrical conductor as the charges are more free to move around. Careful grounding of part of an object with a charge-induced charge separation can permanently add or remove electrons, leaving the object with a global, permanent charge. This process is integral to the workings of the Van de Graaff generator, a device commonly used to demonstrate the effects of static electricity.|$|E

25|$|Electrochemical {{capacitors}} (supercapacitors) {{consist of}} two electrodes separated by an ion-permeable membrane (separator), and an electrolyte ionically connecting both electrodes. When the electrodes are polarized by an applied voltage, ions in the electrolyte form electric double layers of <b>opposite</b> <b>polarity</b> to the electrode's polarity.

25|$|Switching {{regulators}} rapidly switch {{a series}} device on and off. The duty {{cycle of the}} switch sets how much charge is transferred to the load. This is controlled by a similar feedback mechanism as in a linear regulator. Because the series element is either fully conducting, or switched off, it dissipates almost no power; this is what gives the switching design its efficiency. Switching regulators are also able to generate output voltages which are higher than the input, or of <b>opposite</b> <b>polarity</b> — something not possible with a linear design.|$|E

25|$|A static {{electric}} charge can be created whenever two surfaces contact and separate, {{and at least one}} of the surfaces has a high resistance to electric current (and is therefore an electrical insulator). The effects of static electricity are familiar to most people because people can feel, hear, and even see the spark as the excess charge is neutralized when brought close to a large electrical conductor (for example, a path to ground), or a region with an excess charge of the <b>opposite</b> <b>polarity</b> (positive or negative). The familiar phenomenon of a static shock–more specifically, an electrostatic discharge–is caused by the neutralization of charge.|$|E
25|$|Many PLL {{frequency}} synthesizers {{can also}} generate frequency modulation (FM). The modulating signal {{is added to}} the output of the loop filter, directly varying the frequency of the VCO and the synthesizer output. The modulation will also appear at the phase comparator output, reduced in amplitude by any frequency division. Any spectral components in the modulating signal too low to be blocked by the loop filter end up back at the VCO input with <b>opposite</b> <b>polarity</b> to the modulating signal, thus canceling them out. (The loop effectively sees these components as VCO noise to be tracked out.) Modulation components above the loop filter cutoff frequency cannot return to the VCO input so they remain in the VCO output.|$|E
25|$|Applying {{a voltage}} to an {{electrochemical}} capacitor causes both electrodes in the capacitor to generate electrical double-layers. These double-layers consist of {{two layers of}} charges: one electronic layer is in the surface lattice structure of the electrode, and the other, with <b>opposite</b> <b>polarity,</b> emerges from dissolved and solvated ions in the electrolyte. The two layers are separated by a monolayer of solvent molecules, e. g. for water as solvent by water molecules, called inner Helmholtz plane (IHP). Solvent molecules adhere by physical adsorption {{on the surface of}} the electrode and separate the oppositely polarized ions from each other, and can be idealised as a molecular dielectric. In the process, there is no transfer of charge between electrode and electrolyte, so the forces that cause the adhesion are not chemical bonds but physical forces (e.g. electrostatic forces). The adsorbed molecules are polarized but, due to the lack of transfer of charge between electrolyte and electrode, suffered no chemical changes.|$|E

By comparing the results between cables treated by degassing under different conditions, the paper concludes that the “mirror image” charge distribution is mainly attributed to a bulk effect within the volume of the insulation, whilst electron transfer by tunneling through an electrode/insulator interface contributes to the generation of homo “mirror image” close to the electrodes...|$|R

The results show that (a) although, as previously shown [Breitmeyer, B. G. (1978 a).

40|$|With {{different}} {{images to}} each eye, one may experience fusion, suppression of one eye’s view, or diplopia. To understand better the underlying binocular processes, we studied perception of binocular edges {{as a function}} of binocular disparity. Single, Gaussian-blurred, horizontal edges (blur B = 8 min of arc) were shown to each eye at various vertical disparities (0 to 8 B), with the same or <b>opposite</b> contrast <b>polarity.</b> Observers could indicate the position and polarity of a single perceived edge, or report 2 edges. Diplopia increased with disparity, but when contrasts were unequal the lower-contrast edge was often not seen, particularly at disparities 3 to 5 B. We developed a simple descriptive model to interpret the behavioural responses as arising from (a) the probability of fusion (assumed to fall with increasing disparity), (b) the probability of suppression occurring when fusion fails, and (c) the role of positional noise and criterion in judgments of edge position. From this modelling, we conclude that fusion extends to disparities of about 2. 5 B for all observers, but is absent for <b>opposite</b> <b>polarities.</b> Probability of suppression also declined monotonically with increasing disparity, increased with contrast imbalance, and tended to be lower for <b>opposite</b> <b>polarities,</b> but was highly variable across observers...|$|R

This can be prevented when the overlap surfaces of the electrodes are reduced. This is achieved e.g. by an [...] "Open Mode Design" [...] (OMD).

2500|$|A key {{challenge}} for EUV is the counter-scaling {{behavior of the}} line tip-to-tip (T2T) distance [...] as half-pitch (hp) is scaled down. This is {{in part due to}} lower image contrast for the binary masks used in EUV lithography, which is not encountered with the use of phase shift masks in immersion lithography. The rounding of the corners of the line end leads to line end shortening, and this is worse for binary masks. The use of phase-shift masks in EUV lithography has been studied but encounters difficulties from phase control in thin layers as well as the bandwidth of the EUV light itself. More conventionally, optical proximity correction (OPC) is used to address the corner rounding and line-end shortening. In spite of this, {{it has been shown that}} the tip-to-tip resolution and the line tip printability are traded off against each other, being effectively CDs of <b>opposite</b> <b>polarity.</b> In addition, the effectiveness of optical corrections depends on other non-optical causes such as resist blur and diffusion effects, which may also include secondary electron blur (discussed in the section on photoresist exposure). Also, larger molecular weights and sizes appear to reduce corner rounding.|$|E
2500|$|Displays {{having a}} passive-matrix {{structure}} are employing super-twisted nematic STN (invented by Brown Boveri Research Center, Baden, Switzerland, in 1983; scientific details were published) or double-layer STN (DSTN) technology (the latter of which addresses a color-shifting {{problem with the}} former), and color-STN (CSTN) in which color is added by using an internal filter. STN LCDs have been optimized for passive-matrix addressing. They exhibit a sharper threshold of the contrast-vs-voltage characteristic than the original TN LCDs. This is important, because pixels are subjected to partial voltages even while not selected. Crosstalk between activated and non-activated pixels has to be handled properly by keeping the RMS voltage of non-activated pixels below the threshold voltage, while activated pixels are subjected to voltages above threshold (the voltages according to the [...] "Alt & Pleshko" [...] drive scheme) Driving such STN displays according to the Alt & Pleshko drive scheme require very high line addressing voltages. Welzen and de Vaan invented an alternative drive scheme (a non [...] "Alt & Pleshko" [...] drive scheme) requiring much lower voltages, such that the STN display could be driven using low voltage CMOS technologies. [...] STN LCDs have to be continuously refreshed by alternating pulsed voltages of one polarity during one frame and pulses of <b>opposite</b> <b>polarity</b> during the next frame. Individual pixels are addressed by the corresponding row and column circuits. This type of display is called passive-matrix addressed, because the pixel must retain its state between refreshes {{without the benefit of}} a steady electrical charge. As the number of pixels (and, correspondingly, columns and rows) increases, this type of display becomes less feasible. Slow response times and poor contrast are typical of passive-matrix addressed LCDs with too many pixels and driven according to the [...] "Alt & Pleshko" [...] drive scheme. Welzen and de Vaan also invented a non RMS drive scheme enabling to drive STN displays with video rates and enabling to show smooth moving video images on an STN display.

The ensuing system of equations for the amplitudes and frequencies is solved by means of computer-assisted algebra. Exact solutions for mutually-locked front pairs of <b>opposite</b> <b>polarities,</b> with one or several free parameters, are thus generated. The signs of the cubic gain/loss, linear amplification/attenuation, and velocity of the coupled-front complex can be adjusted in a variety of configurations.
