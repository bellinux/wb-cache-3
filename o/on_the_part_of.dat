40|$|Major {{progress}} has been made in breast cancer reconstruction surgery. The standard technique for totally implanted vascular access device (TIVAD) implantation generally requires an incision for port insertion <b>on</b> <b>the</b> anterior <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thorax that leaves a scar in the middle of the neckline in patients who have undergone mastectomy with complex breast reconstruction. The aim of this technical note is to report our revised surgical technique for TIVAD placement. In patients with breast cancer, we take a lateralized approach, performing an oblique incision <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lowest <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deltopectoral groove. This allows us to introduce the port and to place it <b>on</b> <b>the</b> anterolateral <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thorax, thus avoiding an unaesthetic scar <b>on</b> <b>the</b> anterior <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thorax. Our modified technique for TIVAD implantation is described. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
