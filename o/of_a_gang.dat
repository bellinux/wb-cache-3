5|$|The Johnson County War, {{with its}} overtones of class warfare {{coupled with the}} {{intervention}} ordered by the President of the United States to save the lives <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>gang</b> of hired killers and set them free, is not a flattering reflection on the American myth of the west. The Johnson County War {{has been one of}} the best-known range wars of the frontier. It has been a popular feature of the Western genre of fiction, which includes literature, films and television shows. The Banditti of the Plains, written in 1894 by witness Asa Shinn Mercer, is the earliest record of the Johnson County War. The book was suppressed for many years by the WSGA, who seized and destroyed all but a few of the first edition copies from the 1894 printing; they were rumored to have hijacked and destroyed the second printing as it was being shipped from a printer north of Denver, Colorado. The book was reprinted several times in the 20th century and most recently in 2015. Frances McElrath's novel 1902 The Rustler, took inspiration from the Johnson County War, and was sympathetic to the perspective of the small ranchers.|$|E

5|$|Abel Starkey was {{a native}} of Roxbury, Massachusetts. The story of Starkey's capture was {{published}} by George Hubbard in The New England Magazine. Starkey was part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>gang</b> of counterfeiters, including Stephen Burroughs, Samuel Corson and James Smith. Pursued by the authorities, Abel Starkey disappeared in the vicinity of a lightning splitter home that was owned by the Shephardson family. A thorough search of the house was conducted and the authorities found nothing. According to Hubbard, the house was the refuge of the counterfeiters for a number of years. After a time the public and authorities continued to track members of the gang to the location and investigations were performed only to turn up empty. Sheriff Johnson of Worcester tracked the counterfeiters to the house one day and set up a team of men outside and inside the house to uncover and arrest the counterfeiters. A careful search turned up nothing, so measurements of the house were taken to make sure no secret rooms or areas existed. With the inaccessible third attic all but ruled out, the discovery of its access through the chimney was by chance when an officer emptied out his trash into the fireplace. Contained in the trash was some snuff and a sneeze came from above, alerting the officers of hidden occupants in the chimney. After the fire had been extinguished and raked out, Sheriff Johnson attempted to climb up into the chimney. A brick was dropped from above and wounded him. The authorities capped the chimney and smoked the counterfeiters until they fell unconscious. Starkey was amongst the three arrested counterfeiters.|$|E
