Before 1998, {{it was expected that}} the rate <b>of</b> <b>increase</b> of the Hubble Constant would be decreasing as time went on due to the influence of gravitational interactions in the Universe, and thus there is an additional observable quantity in the Universe called the deceleration parameter which cosmologists expected to be directly related to the matter density of the Universe. In 1998, the deceleration parameter was measured by two different groups to be consistent with −1 but not zero, which implied that the present-day rate <b>of</b> <b>increase</b> of the Hubble Constant is increasing over time.|$|E

A traffic survey carried out for a week during June 2012 recorded traffic of 29,000 vehicles over the bridge in comparison to a projected 85,000.

The reason for the fall in traffic during 2012 is attributed to the peak monsoon effect during the survey period.|$|E
5|$|In 2011 {{there were}} {{estimated}} to be 2.37 million households in Scotland. Of these approximately 1.5 million (62.5 per cent) were owner-occupied homes, 319,000 (12.7 per cent) homes rented from local authorities, 305,000 (11.5 per cent) privately rented homes, and 277,000 (11.5 per cent) homes rented from housing associations. The total number had increased by around 173,000 (7.9 per cent) over the previous ten years, with the rate <b>of</b> <b>increase</b> having slowed substantially {{since the start of}} the economic downturn in 2007. The rate of growth in households was affected by falls in new housing supply (which includes new builds, refurbishments and conversions). This fell in each year from 2008–09 to 2010–11, from around 27,600 units in 2007–08 to 17,100 units in 2010–11. The number of households increased after 2010 in every local authority except Clackmannanshire, Inverclyde and West Dunbartonshire. The area with the greatest increase since 2001 in percentage terms was Aberdeenshire with an additional 13,800 households (15.2 per cent). Edinburgh City saw the largest absolute increase of 17,000 households (8.3 per cent). Overall 2.8 per cent of dwellings are vacant and 1.5 per cent are second homes, with the largest proportions in rural areas.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} anatomic {{patterns and}} clinical importance <b>of</b> <b>increased</b> radiopharmaceutical uptake in bones of horses used for show jumping, hunting, and eventing. DESIGN: Retrospective study. ANIMALS: 141 horses evaluated because of lameness. PROCEDURE: Medical records were reviewed, {{and information on}} results of physical examination, radiography, and scintigraphy were obtained. Scintigrams were evaluated to identify areas <b>of</b> <b>increased</b> radio-pharmaceutical uptake. RESULTS: 834 areas <b>of</b> <b>increased</b> radiopharmaceutical uptake were identified. Scintigraphy of the vertebral column was performed in 78 horses, and 50 had areas <b>of</b> <b>increased</b> radiopharmaceutical uptake involving the spinous processes. Scintigraphy of the proximal phalanx of the forelimb was performed in 88 horses. Similarly, scintigraphy of the proximal phalanx of the hind limb was performed in 99 horses, and scintigrams of 374 proximal phalanges were available for review. One hundred fifty-five scintigrams had areas <b>of</b> <b>increased</b> radiopharmaceutical uptake. Scintigraphy of the tarsal joint was performed in 99 horses, and scintigrams of 198 joints were available for review. Eighty-five had areas <b>of</b> <b>increased</b> radiopharmaceutical uptake. Overall, 214 of 834 areas <b>of</b> <b>increased</b> radiopharmaceutical uptake were definitively associated with lameness. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Results {{of this study suggest}} that jumping creates unique stresses on the bones of horses. The distinctive patterns <b>of</b> <b>increased</b> radiopharmaceutical uptake identified in this study suggest that horses used for jumping may have a predilection to develop orthopedic disease at specific sites distinct from those in racehorses.

5|$|Kepler's {{first major}} astronomical work, Mysterium Cosmographicum (The Cosmographic Mystery) , {{was the first}} {{published}} defense of the Copernican system. Kepler claimed to have had an epiphany on July 19, 1595, while teaching in Graz, demonstrating the periodic conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in the zodiac: he realized that regular polygons bound one inscribed and one circumscribed circle at definite ratios, which, he reasoned, might be the geometrical basis of the universe. After failing to find a unique arrangement of polygons that fit known astronomical observations (even with extra planets added to the system), Kepler began experimenting with 3-dimensional polyhedra. He found {{that each of the}} five Platonic solids could be inscribed and circumscribed by spherical orbs; nesting these solids, each encased in a sphere, within one another would produce six layers, corresponding to the six known planets—Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. By ordering the solids selectively—octahedron, icosahedron, dodecahedron, tetrahedron, cube—Kepler found that the spheres could be placed at intervals corresponding to the relative sizes of each planet's path, assuming the planets circle the Sun. Kepler also found a formula relating the size of each planet's orb to the length of its orbital period: from inner to outer planets, the ratio <b>of</b> <b>increase</b> in orbital period is twice the difference in orb radius. However, Kepler later rejected this formula, because it was not precise enough.|$|E
5|$|Some redshifts are {{an example}} of the Doppler effect, {{familiar}} in the change of apparent pitches of sirens and frequency of the sound waves emitted by speeding vehicles. A redshift occurs whenever a light source moves away from an observer. A special instance of this is the cosmological redshift, which is due to the expansion of the universe, and sufficiently distant light sources (generally more than a few million light years away) show redshift corresponding to the rate <b>of</b> <b>increase</b> in their distance from Earth. Finally, gravitational redshift is a relativistic effect observed in electromagnetic radiation moving out of gravitational fields. Conversely, a decrease in wavelength is called blueshift and is generally seen when a light-emitting object moves toward an observer or when electromagnetic radiation moves into a gravitational field. However, redshift is a more common term and sometimes blueshift is referred to as negative redshift.|$|E

As a result, younger, healthier members could expect to pay more over the course of their lifetimes than those men who joined when they were older. There was also a Sick Benefit Deposit for members who fell ill and could not work. Each sick Knight was entitled to draw up to $5 a week for 13 weeks (roughly equivalent to $125.75 in 2009 dollars). If he remained sick after that, the council to which he belonged determined the sum of money given to him.|$|E
