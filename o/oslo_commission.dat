This is in particular a problem in the coastal and estuarine areas, which receives large amounts of riverine nutrients. Studies have shown that changing the ratio of nitrogen and phosphorous could potentially lead to a shift in the phytoplankton communities, towards more frequent nuisance algal blooms. The OSPAR Commission, which followed the Paris and <b>Oslo</b> <b>Commissions,</b> drew a set of Ecological Quality Objectives (EcoQO’s) in order to assess the effectiveness of reducing the river nutrient loads by 50 %. All member countries must assess their coastal areas in accordance with the OSPAR Common Procedure and the EcoQO’s. The 3 -dimensional, coupled physical-chemical-biological model NORWECOM was used in order to assess the long-term effects of reducing riverine DIN and DIP by 50 % and 90 % on three environmental parameters (N:P, chl amax and Omin). The model results showed that there was a decreasing response gradient from near-shore to offshore, where the largest effect for all parameters was identified along the Dutch coast. The EcoQO’s of N:P ratio and the chl amax concentrations were achieved for most areas, whereas the Omin concentrations had no or very low response to the modelled nutrient reductions.

50|$|Just Gjessing (Oslo, 13 July 1926 - 29 October 2005) was a Norwegian geographer. Gjessing {{obtained}} a Ph.D. degree in 1960 with {{a study on}} Norway’s hydrology during deglaciation. One year later he was appointed full professor. In the late 1960s Gjessing became increasingly interested in nature conservation {{so that in the}} 1970s shifted the focus of his research into environmental impact assessments. This meant leaving behind his work on pure fluvial geomorphology that had previously brought him acclaim. Following this interest he joined in 1967 the <b>Oslo</b> University’s <b>Commission</b> for Watercourse Regulation. In 1971 he became chairman of the commission while also entering the Joint Commission for Hydroelectric Power Development and Nature Conservation, of which he was a member until 1981. He co-authored various notable books including Beste Store Norge Atlas (1983) and the five volume work Norge (1984-1986) and the journal Norsk Geografisk Tidsskrift from 1979 to 1987. In the 1980s the work of Gjessing turned increasingly international with many travels to West and North Africa where he studied environmental issues in arid and semi-arid landscapes.Gjessing’s personality and approach made him subject of strong and lasting criticism from so-called “rejectionist” even within his own department at the University of Oslo. Despite their opposition Gjessing managed to establish the course Resource Geography and Landscape Ecology in 1985, attending student demands that had emerged in the 1970s about the need of courses on natural resources and environmental management.|$|R

Since, with the exception of mercury, there are no currently applicable European standards for the concentration of these contaminants in shellfish, the levels were compared with the available standards and guidance values for human consumption, as compiled by the <b>Oslo</b> and Paris <b>Commission</b> (OSPAR) countries. As in previous years, the water quality from shellfish growing areas was good and conformed to the guidelines and requirements of the Directive.

40|$|Annual {{nitrogen}} and phosphorus budgets for the whole North Sea {{taking into account the}} most recent data available were established. The area considered has a total surface of approximately 700, 000 km 2 and corresponds to the definition by OSPARCOM (<b>Oslo</b> and Paris <b>Commission)</b> with the exclusion of the Skagerrak and Kattegat areas. Input and output fluxes were determined at the marine, atmospheric, sediment and continental boundaries, and riverine inputs based on river flows and nutrient concentrations at the river–estuary interface were corrected for possible estuarine retention. The results showed that the North Sea is an extremely complex system subjected to large inter-annual variability of marine water circulation and freshwater land run-off. Consequently, resulting total N (TN) and P (TP) fluxes are extremely variable from 1 year to another and this has an important influence on the budget of these elements. Total inputs to the North Sea are 8870 ± 4860 kT N year – 1 and 494 ± 279 kT P year – 1. Denitrification is responsible for the loss of 23 ± 7 % of the TN inputs while sediment burial is responsible for the retention of only of 2 ± 2 % of the TP input. For TN, due to the large variability on marine and estuarine fluxes, and to the uncertainty related to the denitrification rate, it was concluded that the North Sea could either be a source (1930 kT N year – 1) or a sink (1700 kT N year – 1) for the waters of the North Atlantic Ocean. For TP it was concluded that the North Sea is mostly a source (– 4 to 52 kT P year – 1) for the waters of the North Atlantic Ocean...|$|R

In this study, we describe {{spatial and temporal}} patterns of egg contamination around the North Sea and compared them to the EcoQOs. Concentrations of mercury, polychlorinated biphenyl (SPCB) congeners, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (SDDT) and derivatives, hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and hexachlorocyclohexane (SHCH) isomers were analysed in two tern species (Sterna hirundo and Sterna paradisaea) and Oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus) eggs collected between 2008 and 2010 {{in a total of}} 21 sites in seven countries surrounding the North Sea. Hg, SPCB and HCB were highest in the southern sites, while SDDT and SHCH concentrations were greatest in eggs from the western North Sea and the Elbe estuary. There were rarely any consistent decreases over time for any compounds. In the terns, Hg, HCB and SHCH increased at most sites, SPCB and SDDT in Sweden and Norway. In the Oystercatcher, HCB and SHCH increased at more than the half of the sites, SPCB, SDDT and Hg at several German sites. In the terns, Hg, SPCB and SDDT exceeded the EcoQO in all, HCB in most years and sites. At most sites, SHCH fulfilled the EcoQO in some study years. In the Oystercatcher, Hg, SPCB and SDDT exceeded the EcoQO in all or most years and sites. HCB and SHCH fulfilled the EcoQO in some or all years at most sites. The EcoQO was exceeded most frequently in estuaries. We conclude that EcoQOs are suitable for drawing contamination patterns of the coastal North Sea in an easily understandable manner, offering the opportunity to harmonize the EcoQOs with coordinated environmental monitoring programmes...|$|R

Fin-fish were also collected from five Irish fishing ports and analysed for total mercury content in compliance with the European Commission's Decision of 19 May 1993 on mercury in fisheries products. Selected samples of fin-fish were also analysed for trace metal and chlorinated hydrocarbon concentration. As there are no generally accepted European standards for the concentration of these contaminants in shellfish or fin-fish, the levels were compared with the available standards and guidance values compiled by the <b>Oslo</b> and Paris <b>Commission</b> (OSPAR) countries for human consumption.

40|$|Trichlorobenzenes (TCBs) were intensively used in {{the last}} decades as {{essential}} components of dielectric fluids, intermediates in chemical synthesis, solvents, coolants, lubricants, heat-transfer medium; insecticide, additive in polyester dyeing and components of termite-control preparations (1, 2). Due to their widespread occurrence in the various environmental compartments they have been classified by OSPARCOM (<b>Oslo</b> and Paris <b>Commissions)</b> (3) as chemicals for priority action and have been proposed by the Marine Chemistry Working Group (MCWG) as chemical parameters in the Water Framework Directive (4). Based on their octanol-water partitioning coefficients (log K ow = 4. 02 - 4. 49) (5) and bioconcentration factors in fish (ranging from 182 to 3200, depending on the lipid content) (6), these chemicals are expected to bioaccumulate in aquatic organisms. Against their potential significance in the marine environment there is relatively little information available concerning the actual concentration levels and distribution of trichlorobenzenes in marine organisms (7, 8). The aim of this work was to develop an analytical method appropriate for the determination of TCBs in marine biota. The analytical method consists of saponification of the fish tissue with methanolic potassium hydroxide, liquid-liquid extraction of the solution with pentane, clean up of the concentrated extract on alumina column {{and analysis of the}} extract with gas chromatograph equipped with electron capture detector (ECD). The method proved to be appropriate for the detection of concentration levels typical of the organic contaminants in biota (7) (~ 1 ng /g wet weight of tissue). The relative standard deviation of the analysis of 1, 3, 5 -, 1, 2, 4 - and 1, 2, 3 -trichlorobenzene was 8, 6 and 18 % (n= 4) respectively. Higher recoveries of the analytes were obtained with spiked fish samples than with standard solutions (88, 96 and 78 instead of 53, 50 and 32 % of 1, 3, 5 -, 1, 2, 4 - and 1, 2, 3 -trichlorobenzene respectively).

40|$|In the {{framework}} of the European Water Framework Directive (European Union, 2000), the definition of environmental quality of waters (i. e. surface water, groundwater) refers to the concept of ecological, physical, chemical and biological integrity of environmental resources. The measurement of ecological quality requires a reference area, which is a nonaltered habitat of high ecological status. Accordingly, the environmental quality should be assessed by hydro-geo-morphological (tides, currents, sediment fluxes, etc.), physico-chemical (e. g. oxygenation, light, salinity, temperature, nutrient concentrations), and biological integrity (e. g. community health, species richness, individual abundance and dominance) parameters, {{as well as by the}} concentration of priority pollutants in biotic and abiotic environmental media (i. e. water, sediment, particulate matter and organism tissues). Until recently, the estimation of water quality focussed mainly on nutrients and chemicals, assessing the environmental quality by using water quality criteria, and water quality standards. According to the US Clean Water Act (Public Law 92 - 500), a quality criterion is defined as a ‘numeric or narrative expression that specifies concentrations of water (or sediment, [particulate matter, organic tissues]) constituents (such as toxic chemicals or heavy metals) which, if not exceed, are expected to support an ecosystem suitable for protecting life’. Environmental quality criteria are generally derived by applying different approaches: (1) Effects or weight-of-evidence database from laboratory or field exposures to contaminated media, for example, screening level concentrations for sediment (effect range approach, Long and Morgan, 1990); threshold effect level (MacDonald et al., 1996); (2) Equilibrium partitioning approach (e. g. derivation of sediment quality criteria from water quality criteria, Jones et al., 1996); (3) Background levels, or some multiple of background levels, in the affected region (<b>Oslo</b> and Paris <b>Commissions,</b> 1993); (4) Bioaccumulation and biomagnification- based guidelines, based on bioconcentration factors (Van der Kooij et al., 1991); (5) Biotic indices based on the presence-absence of target taxa (Occhipinti and Ferni, 2003). Amore suitable and integrated approach to evaluate environmental quality and to obtain environmental quality criteria is the risk-based approach, which takes into account the site-specificity of ecosystem, different exposure and effect measurements, and provides monitoring and management decision options by the involvement of stakeholders (ANZECC and ARMCANZ, 2000). The risk-based approach, using the weight of evidence method, is consistent with the most recent concept of environmental quality, such as adopted by the European Water Framework Directive (EU, 2000). In this chapter a summary of issues concerning the environmental quality for the lagoon of Venice is presented...|$|R
40|$|Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The normal operation of the endocrine (hormonal) system can be disrupted {{by a number of}} man-made and naturally-occurring chemicals, thereby affecting those physiological processes that are under hormonal control. Such substances are called endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs). The endocrine disruption issue has alarmed the environmental authorities since the substances involved can hinder hormonal processes causing far-reaching effects on reproduction and development in current and future human and wildlife generations. Effects on some species of fish triggered worldwide concern and initiated a research scheme which is being undertaken by various organisations e. g. United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), United Kingdom Environment Agency (UKEA), <b>Oslo</b> and Paris <b>Commission</b> (OSPAR), Japan Environment Agency (JEA) and World Wildlife Fund (WWF) in order to assess the effects (present and potential), point of generation, levels of contamination and exposure limits. The findings showed that most of the oestrogens are produced by humans and animals and get discharged into river streams mainly through sewage effluents. Fish in particular {{have been found to be}} affected the most even when the oestrogenic levels in water are very low. The probability of future European legislation to eliminate hormonally active compounds from wastewaters suggests that new and alternative methods should be developed for their removal. In this work, the adsorption of 17 ß-oestradiol (E 2) and 17 a-ethinyl oestradiol (EE 2) onto several granular activated carbons and Hypersol-Macronet hypercrosslinked polymers was investigated by batch experiments after a low level detection system had been developed using Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS). Equilibrium experiments were carried out for all adsorbents to quantify the sorption capacity for E 2 and EE 2. For better assessment of the sorbents performance, their physical properties such as surface area, average pore diameter and micropore volume and chemical structure were characterised by N 2 adsorption experiments, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), FTIR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, sodium capacity determination, pH titration, proton binding curves and zeta potential measurements. Adsorption isotherm data were fitted to the Langmuir and Freundlich equations. Activated carbons were found to be preferable to Hypersol-Macronet hypercrosslinked polymers for adsorption purposes. The adsorption of oestrogens appears to be controlled by hydrophobic interactions. Kinetic experiments were performed with different size ranges of adsorbents at different concentrations and the results were analysed by a particle diffusion model. It was found that concentration did not seem to influence the kinetics of the oestrogen sorption whereas the particle size of the adsorbents influenced the adsorption rate of both molecules. The particle diffusion model seemed to fit the data collected for the adsorption rate of 17 B-oestradiool onto the adsorbents but gave a poor fit for most of the data collected for 17 a-ethinyl oestradiol...|$|R
40|$|The spatial {{distributions}} of most dissolved and particulate trace metals are, at least qualitatively, similar. Their concentrations decrease with {{distance from the}} coast and {{the mouth of the}} Scheldt estuary (particulates much stronger than dissolved species). The salinity gradient is similar (but opposite) to the trace metals and turbidity gradients. The five trace metals studied can be subdivided into two groups {{on the basis of their}} KD's (ratio of particulate metal concentration to dissolved metal concentration). Hg and Pb are strongly associated with particulate matter (KD from 0. 5 to 1. 5 offshore and from 7. 9 to 40 in the coastal area), while Cd, Cu and Zn are predominantly in the dissolved phase (KD from 0. 1 to 0. 2 offshore - up to 0. 5 for Zn - and from 1 to 1. 7 in the coastal area). Offshore fluxes of dissolved Cd, Cu, Hg, Pb and Zn are calculated based on diffusive and mixing processes. They can explain the concentration increases in the coastal flow tube (315 km 3. y- 1), but are insignificant beyond that flow tube. The ratios of the Scheldt output to the offshore flux vary from 38 to 85 %, depending on the kind of metal. The ratios of the Scheldt output to the metal flow parallel to the coast is smaller than 1 %. The steady-state concentration profiles of particulate metals versus salinity are fairly constant in the coastal-estuarine and marine water masses, but decrease very abruptly from the first to the second water mass. Assuming a conservative behaviour of the particulate metals, offshore fluxes and the resulting concentration increases in the coastal flow tube, were deduced. These calculated concentration increases agree fairly well with the observed values. The contribution of the Scheldt estuary to the flows parallel to the coast ranges from 1. 6 to 3. 3 %. Biological productivity in coastal waters is often very high owing to the high levels of nutrients supplied via coastal inputs or through upwelling. In Belgian coastal waters for example the daily primary production ranges from 10 to 280 mg N. m - 2 day - 1 corresponding to an annual primary production of about 25 g N. m - 2 y - 1 (Baeyens et al. 1983, Mommaerts et al. 1984, Baeyens et al. 1984). Shellfish and fish thus find there excellent spawning, nursing and feeding grounds. Coastal ecosystems are very sensitive to pollution, which can perturb severely the biological processes. Heavy metals are amongst the major potential pollutants because of their toxicity. Obtaining reliable, accurate trace metal data in, seawater is still a cumbersome operation. In order to evaluate our analyzing procedures, we participated at several intercalibration exercises: (1) the intercalibration exercises for the analysis of cadmium and mercury in sea water requested by the Joint Monitoring Group of the <b>Oslo</b> and Paris <b>Commissions</b> and conducted by ICES. The results have been reported by Thibaud (1981) for cadmium and 01 afsson (1981) for mercury; (2) the intercalibration exercise of trace metals in sediments conducted by the "Centre Oceanologique de Bretagne, CNEXO". The results have been reported by Joanny et al (1980); (3) for the analysis of mercury in botanical substrates (BCR reference materials), we compared several mineralization-digestion methods. Results have been reported by Dehairs et al. (1982). Participation at these intercalibration exercises offered us the possibility to demonstrate that the analyzing procedures in use in our laboratories for Cd, Cu, Hg, Pb and Zn produce reliable data, at least on samples similar to those that served for the intercalibration exercises. Another encouraging fact is that our trace metal data obtained in the English Channel (Baeyens et al., 1987), the Southern Bight of the North Sea (see Table 1), the northern North Sea (Baeyens et al., 1987) and the Mediterranean Sea (our data are given in the section “Sampling of heavy metals”, this paper; for example Mart et al., 1982 report data for the Western Mediterranean Sea) compare favourably with these obtained by other investigators in the same areas. Analytical techniques and methods are described in detail in Baeyens et al. (1987) ...|$|R
