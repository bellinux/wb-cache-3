40|$|Abstract — Equalization for {{channels}} with intersymbol inter-ference is studied. In particular, we {{show that}} <b>the</b> well-known technique <b>of</b> partial-response signaling is the analogon to lattice-reduction-aided equalization of MIMO channels. An algorithm for factorizing the channel transfer function, replacing the lattice reduction in MIMO channels, is derived. It is shown that the proposed schemes offer a good trade-off between complexity and performance. Especially, precoding the partial-response part is worthwhile; only limited channel-state information at the transmitter is required and channel coding can be applied immediately. I.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The JavarMlsystem (hereafter {{referred}} to simply as "Java") inherently supports <b>the</b> transmission <b>of</b> stateless computation in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> object classes.

This is accomplished by a mechanism known as pickling [Binel et al. 1987; Binell et al. 1994; Herlihy & Liskov 19821.

40|$|Abstract—The goal of {{this paper}} is to {{implement}} an efficient matrix inversion of symmetric positive-definite matrices on heterogeneous GPU-based systems. The matrix inversion pro-cedure can be split into three stages: computing the Cholesky factorization, inverting the Cholesky factor and calculating <b>the</b> product <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inverted Cholesky factor with its transpose to get the final inverted matrix. Using high performance data layout, which represents the matrix in the system memory with an optimized cache-aware format, <b>the</b> computation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three stages is decomposed into fine-grained computational tasks. The data flow programming model can then be represented as a directed acyclic graph, where nodes represent tasks and edges the dependencies between them. Standard implementations of matrix inversions as well as other numerical algorithms (e. g., linear and eigenvalue solvers), available in the state-of-the-art numerical libraries (e. g., LAPACK), rely on the expensive fork-join paradigm to achieve parallel performance and are characterized by artifactual synchronization points, which have to be removed to fully exploit the underlying hardware capabilities. Our tile algorithmic approach allows to remove those bottlenecks and to flawlessly execute the tasks, as soon as the data dependencies are satisfied. A hybrid runtime environ-ment system becomes paramount to dynamically schedule the numerical kernels on the available processing units, whether it is a hardware accelerator (i. e, GPU) or a homogeneous multicore (i. e., x 86), and this is transparently carried out from the user. Preliminary results are shown on a dual-socket quad-core Intel Xeon 2. 67 GHz workstation with two nVIDIA Fermi C 2070 GPU cards. Our implementation (448 Gflop/s) results in up to 5 and 6 -fold improvement compared to <b>the</b> <b>equivalen...</b>|$|R
