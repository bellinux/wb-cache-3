5|$|The {{conflict}} between <b>Old</b> <b>School</b> and New School factions {{merged with the}} slavery controversy. The New School's enthusiasm for moral reform and voluntary societies was evident in its increasing identification with the abolitionist movement. The <b>Old</b> <b>School,</b> however, {{was convinced that the}} General Assembly and the larger church should not legislate on moral issues that were not explicitly addressed in the Bible. This effectively drove the majority of Southern Presbyterians to support the <b>Old</b> <b>School</b> faction.|$|E
5|$|A {{majority}} of <b>Old</b> <b>School</b> {{leaders in the}} North were convinced of the orthodoxy of the New School. Some within the <b>Old</b> <b>School,</b> chiefly Princeton theologian Charles Hodge, claimed that there were still ministers within the New School who adhered to New Haven theology. Nevertheless, the Old and New School General Assemblies in the North and a {{majority of}} their presbyteries approved the reunion in 1869 of the PCUSA.|$|E

5|$|In 1929, Princeton Theological Seminary was reorganized to {{make the}} school's {{leadership}} and faculty more representative of the wider church rather than just <b>Old</b> <b>School</b> Presbyterianism. Two of the seminary's new board members were signatories to the Auburn Affirmation. In order to preserve Princeton's <b>Old</b> <b>School</b> legacy, Machen {{and several of his}} colleagues founded Westminster Theological Seminary.|$|E
5|$|Notwithstanding the General Assembly's {{attempt to}} promote peace and unity, two {{distinct}} factions, the <b>Old</b> <b>School</b> and the New School, developed through the 1820s over {{the issues of}} confessional subscription, revivalism, {{and the spread of}} New England theology. The New School faction advocated revivalism and New England theology, while the <b>Old</b> <b>School</b> was opposed to the extremes of revivalism and desired strict conformity to the Westminster Confession. The ideological center of <b>Old</b> <b>School</b> Presbyterianism was Princeton Theological Seminary, which under the leadership of Archibald Alexander and Charles Hodge became associated with a brand of Reformed scholasticism known as Princeton Theology.|$|E
5|$|The first {{definitive}} split over slavery {{occurred within}} the New School Presbyterian Church. In 1858, Southern synods and presbyteries {{belonging to the}} New School withdrew and established the pro-slavery United Synod of the Presbyterian Church. <b>Old</b> <b>School</b> Presbyterians followed in 1861 {{after the start of}} hostilities in the American Civil War.

5|$|When the General Assembly met in May 1838 at Philadelphia, the New School commissioners {{attempted}} to be seated but {{were forced to}} leave and convene their own General Assembly elsewhere in the city.

Both churches, however, {{claimed to be the}} Presbyterian Church in the USA. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided that the <b>Old</b> <b>School</b> body was the legal successor of the undivided PCUSA.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge {{was equally}} {{controversial}} in internal church politics. He rebuked the Synod of the Western Reserve for de-emphasizing and effectively abandoning {{the office of}} Ruling Elder. He also condemned the governance of Presbyterian missionaries by anyone other than the Presbyterian church. In 1834, he was the chief author of the Act and Testimony, a document summarizing the contentions between the Old and New Schools. The New School resented Breckinridge and those who signed the Act and Testimony, and even some in the <b>Old</b> <b>School</b> camp had hoped for a more moderate course. The differences between the Old and New Schools widened over the teachings of Albert Barnes, and the New School members were ejected from the Presbyterian Church in 1837. Because of his leadership in the Old School-New School controversy, Breckinridge was elected moderator of the <b>Old</b> <b>School</b> branch's General Assembly in 1841.|$|E

In total, three synods in New York and one synod in Ohio along with 28 presbyteries, 509 ministers, and 60 thousand church members (one-fifth of the PCUSA's membership) were excluded from the church.
