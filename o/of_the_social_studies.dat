25|$|In 2000, William Stark, an {{assistant}} principal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Studies</b> Department, was appointed acting principal. He {{was expected to}} move up to the principal's office, when Chancellor Harold O. Levy {{decided to try to}} find a Nobel laureate to become principal. However, when that effort failed, Stark was still not offered the job as principal. Stark said that if he wasn't officially offered the job by a certain date, he would take another position being offered to him elsewhere. When the deadline came and went, Stark accepted a job as principal of Manhasset High School. Many faculty and parents were upset that Stark was not appointed in a timely way and thus had left the school; Vincent Galasso agreed to an interim appointment for one term in 2001.|$|E
