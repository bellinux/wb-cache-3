5|$|Author Raven Grimassi {{has written}} {{extensively}} about Aradia in his popularization of Stregheria, presenting what he admits is his own personal rendering <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>story.</b> He differs from Leland in many ways, particularly in portraying her as a witch who lived and taught in 14th-century Italy, rather than a goddess.|$|E
5|$|Daphne du Maurier {{was pleased}} with the {{adaptation}} <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>story,</b> and wrote to Nicolas Roeg to congratulate him for capturing the essence of John and Laura's relationship.

5|$|Over the years, the Secords unsuccessfully {{petitioned the}} {{government}} {{for some kind of}} acknowledgement. In 1860, when Secord was 85, the Prince of Wales heard <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>story</b> while travelling in Canada. At Chippawa, near Niagara Falls, he learned of Laura Secord's plight as an aging widow and sent an award of £100. It was the only official recognition that she received during her lifetime.|$|E

5|$|After Boisselier {{announced}} that {{no evidence of}} the cloning would be provided, journalists became very skeptical <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>story.</b> While discussing Boisselier's management of Clonaid, Palmer notes {{that it is impossible}} to know why she stated that a clone was produced but then refused to provide evidence. She argues that her refusal to provide evidence may have been because she organized a hoax, did not wish to publicize the birth of an unhealthy child, or was taken advantage of by a scientist she had hired. American science journalist Steven S. Hall criticized the media for their coverage of Clonaid, believe that they were inarticulately represented as a credible group. He speculates that the coverage of Boisselier and other cloning adherents galvanized sentiment against cloning, leading to its banning in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|Ahalya's {{seduction}} by Indra and its repercussions {{form the}} central narrative <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>story</b> in all scriptural sources for her life. Although the Brahmanas (9th to 6th centuries BCE) are the earliest scriptures to hint at {{her relationship with}} Indra, the 5th- to 4th-century BCE Hindu epic Ramayana– whose hero is Rama– {{is the first to}} explicitly mention her extra-marital affair in detail. Medieval story-tellers often focus on Ahalya's deliverance by Rama, which is seen as proof of the saving grace of God. Her story has been retold numerous times in the scriptures and lives on in modern-age poetry and short stories, as well as in dance and drama. While ancient narratives are Rama-centric, contemporary ones focus on Ahalya, telling the story from her perspective. Other traditions deal with her children.|$|E

5|$|Joan Callamezzo (Mo Collins) arrives {{to report}} on the festival and is {{determined}} to find a negative story, although she does show excitement over Li'l Sebastian. She initially fails to find a scandal, but then overhears Leslie and Ben discussing the curse. It becomes the focus <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>story,</b> especially after Tom (Aziz Ansari) tells Leslie that Li'l Sebastian escaped his pen. Tom blames Jerry (Jim O'Heir), although it was entirely Tom's fault. The Pawnee media swarms the festival to cover the curse, endangering its opening the next day with the bad press, with one reporter likening Ben's past as a failed teen mayor with the curse. Now believing himself to be the curse, Ben leaves the festival. As Leslie reassures the reporters there is no curse, the power generator blows out, leaving the festival dark and stranding most of the parks department on a Ferris wheel. Using the blackout as an excuse, Ann takes Donna's advice to make out with Kiley (Joey Russo), her dumb but attractive patient.|$|E
5|$|Momolo {{returned}} to Bologna in late September 1858 after his two brothers-in-law wrote {{to him that}} if he stayed in Rome any longer the family might be ruined. He left Scazzocchio to represent the family's cause in Rome. Momolo shifted his priority to attempting to undermine Morisi's credibility, either by disproving aspects <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>story</b> or by showing her to be untrustworthy. He also resolved to confront Cesare Lepori, the grocer who Morisi said had both suggested the baptism and shown her how to perform it. Based on Morisi's story, Lepori had already been identified by many observers as being ultimately to blame for the affair. When Momolo visited his shop in early October, Lepori vehemently denied that he had ever spoken to Morisi about Edgardo or any baptism, and said that he was prepared to testify to this effect before any legal authority. He claimed that he did not himself know how to administer baptism, so had such a conversation occurred it could hardly have gone as Morisi described.|$|E

25|$|Canby's account {{has been}} the source of some debate. It is {{generally}} regarded as being neither proven nor disproven, and any evidence that may have once existed has been lost.

25|$|Modern {{adaptations of}} Arthurian legend vary greatly in their {{depiction}} of Guinevere, largely because certain aspects <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>story</b> must be fleshed {{out by the}} modern author. In spite of her iconic doomed romance with Lancelot, a number of modern reinterpretations portray her as being manipulated into her affair with Lancelot (usually by Morgan le Fay or Nimue), with Arthur being her rightful true love. Others present her love for Lancelot as stemming from a relationship that existed prior to her arranged marriage to Arthur.|$|E

25|$|On 29 March 2004 Rau {{arrived at}} the Hann River Roadhouse in North Queensland. She was hitchhiking and {{travelling}} alone. Since it was the wet season, {{and she did not}} have a consistent plan for travel, the locals were concerned for her safety. On 30 March, locals took her from the Roadhouse to the nearby town of Coen, on the Cape York Peninsula. She was taken to the Exchange Hotel in Coen, where locals called the Queensland Police. There Rau gave several versions <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>story,</b> identifying herself as Anna Brotmeyer and Anna Schmidt, and spoke both English and German. She said that she was a tourist from Munich, Germany, and that she was planning to continue north as far as Weipa. However, she could not provide any documentation and said there was no-one else in Australia who would know she was missing.|$|E
50|$|She became {{acquainted with}} the Brothers Grimm in 1813 and told them more than forty tales and variations.

Wilhelm Grimm wrote {{that it was an}} amazing {{coincidence}} that he and his brother had met this woman. The brothers were especially impressed that Dorothea could retell <b>her</b> <b>stories</b> again and again without changing a word.

Hospital staff were reluctant to give foster custody to Butler and were very skeptical <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>story,</b> strongly suspecting she had concocted it as part of a bid to take over as Genie's guardian and primary caretaker, but decided that placing Genie in an isolation ward at the hospital could potentially be highly damaging to her social and psychological development, so they agreed to temporarily quarantine her in Butler's home. Butler, who was childless, unmarried, and at the time living alone, subsequently petitioned for foster custody of Genie, and despite the hospital's objections authorities extended Genie's stay while they considered the matter.|$|E
500|$|Eva is {{the center}} of {{attention}} [...] but the lyric does not allow a transfer of meaning outside of the context <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>story.</b> Part of the song's popularity lies in the way it finds an image—the suitcase in the hall—to express the nomadic nature of modern civilization, the feeling of urban rootlessness that many people experience. The theme of constant moving strikes a resonant note.|$|E
