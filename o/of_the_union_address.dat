5|$|Freedom from Fear is {{the last}} of the {{well-known}} Four Freedoms oil paintings produced by the American artist Norman Rockwell. The series was based on the four goals known as the Four Freedoms, which were enunciated by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in his State <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> <b>Address</b> on January 6, 1941. This work was published in the March 13, 1943, issue of The Saturday Evening Post alongside an essay by a prominent thinker of the day, Stephen Vincent Benét. The painting is generally described as depicting American children being tucked into bed by their parents while the Blitz rages across the Atlantic in Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|In 1791, {{following}} {{a study by}} Alexander Hamilton, Congress passed a joint resolution calling {{for the establishment of}} a national mint. Later that year, in his third State <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> <b>address,</b> President George Washington urged Congress to provide for a mint, which was officially authorized by the Coinage Act of 1792. Despite the authorization, silver and gold coins were not struck until 1794. The Flowing Hair dollar, designed by Robert Scot, was initially produced in 1794, and again in 1795. In October 1795 the design was replaced by the Draped Bust dollar.|$|E
5|$|In his 2002 State <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> <b>Address,</b> Bush {{referred}} to an {{axis of evil}} including Iraq, Iran and North Korea. After the September 11 attacks on New York, Bush launched the War on Terror, in which the United States military and a small international coalition invaded Afghanistan. In 2003, Bush then launched the invasion of Iraq, searching for Weapons of Mass Destruction, which he described as {{being part of the}} War on Terrorism. Those invasions led to the toppling of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan and the removal of Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq.|$|E

5|$|In his State <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> <b>Address</b> on 23 January 2007, President Bush {{announced}} plans to deploy more than 20,000 additional soldiers and Marines to Iraq in {{what became known as}} the Surge. Four thousand were specifically earmarked for Anbar, which Bush acknowledged had become both an AQI haven and a center of resistance against AQI. Instead of deploying new units, the Marine Corps chose to extend the deployments of several units already in Anbar: 1st Battalion 6th Marines, 3rd Battalion 4th Marines, and the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU). The 15th MEU would later be replaced by the 13th MEU as the last surge unit.|$|E

5|$|Freedom from Fear is {{the last}} of a series of four oil {{paintings}} entitled Four Freedoms, painted by Norman Rockwell. The works were inspired by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in a State <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> <b>Address</b> delivered to the 77th United States Congress on January 6, 1941; the speech itself is often called the Four Freedoms. The Four Freedoms theme was eventually incorporated into the Atlantic Charter, and it became part of the charter of the United Nations. The series of paintings was printed in The Saturday Evening Post, accompanied by essays from noted writers, on four consecutive weeks in early 1943: Freedom of Speech (February 20), Freedom of Worship (February 27), Freedom from Want (March 6) and Freedom from Fear (March 13). Eventually, the series was widely distributed in poster form and became instrumental in the U.S. Government's Second War Bond Drive.|$|E

5|$|In 2011, The Washington Post {{linked with}} {{approval}} to Romm's {{review of the}} scientific literature on climate change. Time magazine explored Romm's critique of Matthew Nisbet and praised {{his analysis of the}} decline of media coverage regarding climate change. National Geographic quoted him about the part that the media has played in the dearth of information about climate reaching the public. The same year, Technology Review quoted Romm regarding the relationship between government-assisted deployment and rapid innovation in energy technologies, and the Toronto Star quoted him regarding President Obama's 2011 State <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> <b>address.</b> In 2012 in The New York Times, economist Paul Krugman cited Romm on the connection between drought and Climate change, and The Atlantic interviewed and cited him on the reluctance of the Democrats to discuss climate change. National Geographic quoted him about disappearing arctic ice and the effect of climate change on the polar bear, and Current TV's Bill Press interviewed Romm about record-breaking heat.|$|E
5|$|On January 27, 2010, {{the day of}} President Barack Obama's State <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> <b>address,</b> Ryan reintroduced a {{modified}} version of his Roadmap, H.R. 4529: Roadmap for America's Future Act of 2010. The modified plan would have provided across-the-board tax cuts by reducing income tax rates; eliminating income taxes on capital gains, dividends, and interest; and abolishing the estate tax and Alternative Minimum Tax. The plan would also have replaced the corporate income tax with a border-adjusted business consumption tax of 8.5%. The plan would have privatized a portion of Social Security and reduced benefits for those under 55, eliminated the tax exclusion for employer-sponsored health insurance, and privatized Medicare and Medicaid.|$|E

5|$|Paul was {{considered}} a potential candidate for the Republican nomination for the Presidency of the United States since at least January 2013. He delivered the Tea Party response to President Barack Obama's State <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> <b>address</b> on February 13, 2013, while Marco Rubio gave the official Republican response. This prompted some pundits to call that date {{the start of the}} 2016 Republican primaries. That year, he spoke at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington D.C., where he won the 2016 Presidential straw poll. Paul {{went on to win the}} straw poll for the next two years as well, leading to some considering Paul to be a front runner for the nomination, although CPAC attendees are typically considered younger and more libertarian-minded than average Republican voters.|$|E
5|$|The {{commission}} is thought by some foreign policy analysts {{to be the}} basis for President George W. Bush's axis of evil line in his 2002 State <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> <b>Address,</b> in which he accused Iraq, Iran, and North Korea of being state sponsors of terrorism and of pursuing weapons of mass destruction. The Rumsfeld Commission grouped the three countries together because they all were believed to be pursuing ballistic missile programs based on the Scud missile. In the pre-9/11 days of the Bush presidency, the administration had focused heavily on developing a national missile defense system to counter such threats. A month after the address, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, who appointed Rumsfeld as head of the commission, mentioned the importance of the commission's findings in relation to the US ability to predict the threat posed by the axis members.|$|E
5|$|Clinton joined friend Bruce Lindsey's Little Rock {{law firm}} of Wright, Lindsey and Jennings. In 1982, he was elected {{governor}} a second time and kept the office for ten years. Effective with the 1986 election, Arkansas had changed its gubernatorial term of office from two to four years. During his term, he helped transform Arkansas's economy and improved the state's educational system. For senior citizens, he removed the sales tax from medications and increased the home property-tax exemption. He became a leading figure among the New Democrats, a group of Democrats who advocated welfare reform, smaller government, and other policies not supported by liberals. Formally organized as the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC), the New Democrats argued that in light of President Ronald Reagan's landslide victory in 1984, the Democratic Party needed to adopt a more centrist political stance in order to succeed at the national level. Clinton delivered the Democratic response to Reagan's 1985 State <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> <b>Address</b> and served {{as chair of the}} National Governors Association from 1986 to 1987, bringing him to an audience beyond Arkansas.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{contributes}} to the reconstructions and analyses that all try {{to answer the question}} “How did President George W.

To argument that President Bush writes a ‘war on terror’ story, Bush’s post- 9 / 11 State <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> <b>addresses</b> are analysed and compared with South Park’s trilogy “Imaginationland” (aired in the US in October 2007), and with the film Team America: World Police (2004).
