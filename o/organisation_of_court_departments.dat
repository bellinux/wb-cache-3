Street signs additionally add {{the name of the}} cadastral area (katastrální území), which usually reflects the name of an old municipality before its assimilation into the city of Prague. Thus, a sign in Kbely will say [...] "Praha 9-Kbely," [...] not [...] "Praha 19." [...] Prague residents {{are much more likely to}} use the name of a cadastral area or a 1960 municipal district than the name of a post-1990 district in everyday communication.|$|R

40|$|This {{paper will}} present a {{research}} in progress which aims to study the <b>organisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>courts</b> and {{the changes in the}} work of magistrates. More precisely it describes the different ways in which judges and prosecutors face the question of quickness, efficiency and delays in the different fields of judicial activity. Justice is usually seen as an institution in which judges take time in order to decide on cases – and is frequently criticized for being slow and inefficient. However, we now witness a rapid change: the management of cases, as well as the pressures exerted by media and political actors have profoundly affected the operations <b>of</b> <b>courts.</b> In all matters, civil as well as criminal, the main concern is now to give quick answers to every situation submitted to the court. As the time given to the treatment of each case decreases, one can ask what is the impact on the way cases are dealt with and the effect on the work of judges. The study presented will compare this issue of time and judging using the data collected in five courts in two countries, Belgium and France. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|The ‘Graues Haus‘ (literally, the ‘grey house‘) {{was erected}} in the Alservorstadt {{right outside the}} city {{boundaries}} of Vienna between 1831 and 1839. Its original function was to house the Magistrates’ court for criminal matters, replacing the previous court house (known locally as the ‘Schranne’) that had been situated at Hoher Markt. With effect of 1 st July 1850 the municipal and manorial courts were abolished and the <b>organisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>courts</b> with which we are familiar today was introduced. At {{the same time the}} inquisitorial system was replaced with the adversarial one and public and oral court proceedings became the norm. The ‘Graues Haus’ now accommodated the criminal division of the Vienna Regional Court and the Vienna Prosecutor’s Office. In 1873 construction work began for the ‘Großer Schwurgerichtssaal’, a new court room specifically for jury trials. The court’s jail house was demolished between 1980 and 1996 and replaced with a new facility for the Josefstadt jail; the court itself was provided with modern court rooms. The focus on the achievements of the ‘Rechtsstaat’, a state based on the rule of law, and of modern criminal law is meant to underline the great value of a system <b>of</b> <b>courts</b> which is devoid of any political influence...|$|R
