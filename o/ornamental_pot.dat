The PGRs were applied three times as substrate drenches or foliar sprays at the concentration of 15 mg dm- 3 (flurprimidol) or 4250 mg dm- 3 (daminozide). Plant growth was restricted only by flurprimidol, particularly when it was applied as substrate drenches. Plant height was reduced by 48 % at anthesis and by 38 % at flower senescence, compared to the untreated control. Regardless of the application method, flurprimidol increased the leaf greenness index (SPAD) and bulb weight.

Development of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) enables {{the use of}} narrow band red and/or blue wavelengths as supplementary lighting in ornamental production. Yet, long periods under these wavelengths will affect leaf morphology and physiology. Leaf anatomy, stomatal traits, and stomatal conductance, leaf hydraulic conductance (Kleaf), and photosynthetic efficiency were investigated in three <b>ornamental</b> <b>pot</b> plants, namely Cordyline australis (monocot), Ficus benjamina (dicot, evergreen leaves), and Sinningia speciosa (dicot, deciduous leaves) after 8 weeks under LED light. Four light treatments were applied at 100 μmol m− 2 s− 1 and a photoperiod of 16 h using 100 % red (R), 100 % blue (B), 75 % red with 25 % blue (RB), and full spectrum white light (W), respectively. B and RB resulted in a greater maximum quantum yield (Fv/Fm) and quantum efficiency (ΦPSII) in all species compared to R and W and this correlated with a lower biomass under R. B increased the stomatal conductance compared with R. This increase was linked to an increasing stomatal index and/or stomatal density but the stomatal aperture area was unaffected by the applied light quality. Leaf hydraulic conductance (Kleaf) was not significantly affected by the applied light qualities. Blue light increased the leaf thickness of F. benjamina, and a relative higher increase in palisade parenchyma was observed. Also in S. speciosa, increase in palisade parenchyma was found under B and RB, though total leaf thickness was not affected. Palisade parenchyma tissue thickness was correlated to the leaf photosynthetic quantum efficiency (ΦPSII). In conclusion, the role of blue light addition in the spectrum is essential for the normal anatomical leaf development which also impacts the photosynthetic efficiency in the three studied species...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Miniature rose (Rosa hybrida) {{are well}} {{known as one of}} the world’s most popular {{ornamental}} plants cultivated worldwide as potted and/or bed plants. Nowadays, more than 100 million pots of miniature roses are propagated by stem cutting in the commercial greenhouses of European countries such as Denmark and Germany. Some treatments such as application of plant growth regulators and suitable rooting medium could be required for accelerating root formation in rose cuttings. Using plant growth regulators like natural or synthetic auxin is a pre-requirement for the initiation of adventitious root in some stem cuttings and it has been reported that the division of the first initiator cells of root depends on internal or synthetic auxin. Methods of application of these chemicals and suitable concentration could be related to several factors, importantly the plant varieties, type of cuttings and the time of cutting preparation. Various kinds of media such as soil, peat moss, perlite and vermiculite are used as bed substrate according to required ratio. Rooting media must provide appropriate moisture and air ventilation for cuttings establishment, which highly affect the cuttings root formation. Appropriate procedure for using wastes materials as culture bed, especially those materials that produced locally, is main aim of some studies to find an alternative medium in <b>ornamental</b> <b>pot</b> plant production. In this regards, evaluation of agricultural wastes to be used to culture bed and introducing suitable materials could be considered. Accordingly, the objective of the present study was to determine the effects of two types of plant growth regulators and bed combinations on rooting percentage of semi-hardwood cuttings in miniature rose. Materials and Methods: In order to evaluate the effects of different concentrations of indolebutyric acid (IBA) and naphtaleneacetic acid (NAA), and two media with different composition on root formation of miniature rose stem cutting, this research was carried out as a factorial on the basis of randomized complete design (RCD) with three replications. Plant growth regulators including IBA at concentrations of 0, 1000, 2000 and 3000 mgl- 1, concentrations of NAA at 0, 500, 1000, 1500 and 2000 mgl- 1 were applied together with two types of rooting media. Media including mixing volume of perlite, tea waste compost and sand in a ratio of 1 : 2 : 2, and perlite, peat and sand in a ratio of 1 : 2 : 2 were mixed and applied in this experiment. Using SAS software, data was analyzed based on a generalized linear model (GLM) analysis and tested by least significant difference (LSD) at (P-value< 0. 05). Results and Discussion: Results showed that the highest rooting percentage of cuttings was obtained with 2000 mgl- 1 of IBA, while no significant effect of NAA treatment and different rooting media on percentage of rooting was revealed. The two-fold and three-fold interaction of treatments on other measured traits such as primary and secondary root number and root diameter were significant. The two-fold interaction of NAA treatments and rooting media on the trait of primary root number were no significant. The highest root number and root diameter measured in medium containing perlite, tea waste compost and sand in a ratio of 1 : 2 : 2 for cutting received combined plant growth regulators. Conclusions: Compost, the final product of organic residues degradation, improves soil physical characteristics such as soil aggregate formation and stability, water penetration, porosity, compressing resistance and nutrients availability. As well, it improves soil biological characteristics and in result, integration of compost with soil can increase growth, yield and quality of crop. There are also some evidences that in contrast of peat, compost contains plant growth regulators improved plant growth and development. Totally, considering our obtained results, in order to accelerate rooting formation in miniature rose cuttings, treatment of cuttings with synthetic plant growth regulators in medium containing perlite: tea wastes compost: sand (2 : 2 : 1) under alternate mist system is recommended. Organic materials activate root area as well as improving fertility of soil. They also play a role in supplying and releasing absorbable nutrients, root establishment, enhancing field capacity, reducing evaporation from soil surface and reducing expenses. Therefore, we emphasize on appropriate using of these components in order to obtain better productivity...|$|E
40|$|Chemical {{plant growth}} {{regulators}} (PGRs) {{are used in}} the production of <b>ornamental</b> <b>potted</b> and bedding plants. Growth control is needed for maximizing production per unit area, reducing transportation costs and to obtain a desired visual quality. However, the use of PGRs is associated with toxicity risks to humans and the environment. In many countries the availability of PGRs is restricted as few substances are registered for use. A number of alternative methods have been suggested. The methods include genetic methods (breeding) and crop cultivation practices such as fertigation, temperature and light management. A lot of research into “alternative” growth regulation was performed during the 1980 - 1990 s, revealing several possible ways of using different climatic factors to optimize plant growth with respect to plant height. In recent years, the interest in climatic growth regulation has been resurrected, not least due to the coming phase-out of the plant growth regulator chlormequat chloride (CCC). Today, authorities in many countries are aiming towards reducing the use of agrochemicals. At the same time, there is a strong demand from consumers for products produced without chemicals. This article provides a broad overview of available methods for non-chemical growth control. It is concluded that a combination of plant breeding and management of temperature, fertigation and light management has the potential of replacing chemical growth regulators in the commercial production of ornamental pot- and bedding plants...|$|R

40|$|International audienceOne of {{the main}} {{criteria}} for the visual quality of an <b>ornamental</b> <b>potted</b> plant is its shape, which should be compact and branched. In the case of rose, like that of many other ornamental plants, {{it is essential to}} be able to control both growth and branching. The most common method used is the application of chemical growth regulators. However, their toxicity in relation to health and their impact on the environment cast doubts on their use. Mechanical stimulation is one of the alternative methods proposed to replace these chemical regulators. It was applied to young rose plants, Rosa hybrida 'Radrazz' Knock-Out (R), at two different frequencies: once a day, three times per week, for seven weeks (Exp. 1), and five times a day, four times per week, for five weeks (Exp. 2). It consisted of passing a horizontal bar over {{the upper part of the}} plants. Significant results were obtained in the two trials, with an increase in the number of branchings from the most proximal metamers (of 102 % and 97 % in Exps. 1 and 2, respectively) and a reduction of the length of metamers of order 1 axes (of 8 % and 9 % in Exps. 1 and 2, respectively), resulting in a significant reduction in axis length in Exp. 2. A reduction in the length of order 2 axes during growth was also observed in the two trials. These results lead the way to interesting potential horticultural applications for controlling plant growth, in particular, the elongation of branches, and for promoting basitone branching...|$|R

40|$|The shape and, therefore, the {{architecture}} of the plant are dependent on genetic and environmental factors such as water supply. The architecture determines the visual quality, a key criterion underlying the decision to purchase an <b>ornamental</b> <b>potted</b> plant. The aim {{of this study was to}} analyze genotypic responses of eight rose bush cultivars to alternation of water restriction and re-watering periods, with soil water potential of - 20 and - 10 kPa respectively. Responses were evaluated at the architectural level through 3 D digitalization using six architectural variables and at the physiological level by measuring stomatal conductance, water content, hormones [abscisic acid (ABA), auxin, cytokinins, jasmonic acid, and salicylic acid (SA) ], sugars (sucrose, fructose, and glucose), and proline. Highly significant genotype and watering effects were revealed for all the architectural variables measured, as well as genotype × watering interaction, with three distinct genotypic architectural responses to water restriction – weak, moderate and strong – represented by Hw 336, ‘Baipome’ and ‘The Fairy,’ respectively. The physiological analysis explained, at least in part, the more moderate architectural response of ‘Baipome’ compared to ‘The Fairy,’ but not that of Hw 336 which is an interspecific hybrid. Such physiological responses in ‘Baipome’ could be related to: the maintenance of the stimulation of budbreak and photosynthetic activity during water restriction periods due to a higher concentration in conjugated cytokinins (cCK) and to a lower concentration in SA; a better resumption of budbreak during the re-watering periods due to a lower concentration in ABA during this period. When associated with the six architectural descriptors, cCK, SA and ABA, which explained the genotypic differences in this study, could be used as selection criteria for breeding programs aimed at improving plant shape and tolerance to water restriction...|$|R

40|$|The {{ornamental}} {{value of}} Bromeliaceae not only {{depends on the}} inflorescence {{but more and more}} {{on the quality of the}} leafy part of these <b>ornamental</b> <b>potted</b> plants. In this respect breeding was focused on the creation of new shapes and colors for the inflorescence but less attention was paid to the leaves. However these days bromeliad cultivars with nice decorative leaves are produced and demanded by the markets. The plants of interest in this paper are from the genus Aechmea. These CAM (Crassulacean Acid Metabolism) plants do show a strong growth and contain plants with nice inflorescences. Aechmea faciata without spines is a novelty that has been introduced over the last decade. Crosses between different Aechmea species resulted in new hybrids very much wanted by growers and consumers. At a given point it became clear in the late 70 ’s that some of these Aechmea hybrids suffer from leaf damage problems. This damage could not been explained by classical causes like sunburn, Ca deficiencies or temperature shocks. It became clear that not only mature plants were suffering from this problem but also young plant material. Leaf damage was not only induced during the greenhouse period but also during and after transport of young or mature plants. Some hybrids were very sensitive, others were rather insensitive. It became clear that more research was needed to clear up the minds of breeders, growers, traders and consumers and to find the real cause of the problem. We will present results starting from breeding throughout production of young plants up to flowering plants indicating the cause of the leaf damage. The basic cause of the leaf damage is cell burst at the level of the chlorenchyma cells. By studying CAM, the water relations, the cell wall strength and composition we actually can give a reasonable explanation for the leaf damage observed. The importance of these findings will be projected into the scope of the supply chain of Aechmea plants. status: publishe...|$|R

To evaluate diverse cultivars of sunflower for their performance under field and greenhouse conditions. 2. To explore the potential of sunflower in the local florist industry. 3. To exhibit the diversity of sunflower characteristics to the public. In 2004, studies were conducted during the spring and summer in the field and during fall and winter in the greenhouse. Commercial seed catalogs were used to obtain diverse cultivars. In the field study seeds were sown according to the prescribed spacing and depth in a randomized complete block design. Severe soil crusting necessitated replanting. Plants were observed from emergence to maturity for horticultural traits such as days to first leaf emergence, height of the plant, days to bloom, number of heads, and branching characters. When observed performance was compared with the catalog description, similarities were found for flower color and head diameter; however, differences were found for plant height and days to bloom. Aesthetic characteristics were evaluated in the field and in the laboratory as cut flowers. Preliminary results indicated that ornamental sunflower cultivars performed well in Kentucky even in an unusually wet, cool growing season. Inconsistency between catalog descriptions and observed performance indicates the need for growers to test promising varieties on a small scale before making large investments. In the greenhouse study cultivars produced fewer branches and heads compared to their field performance. Some cultivars failed to produce flowers under greenhouse conditions. Sunflower heads were found to be attractive and pleasing {{to a wide range of}} individuals.

40|$|ABSTRACT The consumer's {{constant}} {{search for}} novelties {{in the area}} of ornamental plants has inspired the use of species that are normally used for other purposes, such as fruit-bearing plants, to be introduced into floriculture. The physalis, a fruit-bearing plant, with a beautiful accrescent fruiting calyx that envelops the berry, can be used for these purposes. However, this plant can reach 70 cm high, which makes it unviable to be used as an indoor plant. The objective of this research was to decrease the size of the physalis (Physalis angulata) for <b>ornamental</b> use, <b>pot</b> it and apply the plant growth regulator Paclobutrazol (PBZ). The PBZ growth regulator was applied only once, via foliar spray at the concentrations of 0, 30, 60, 90, 120 and 150 mg a. i L- 1, as well as via irrigation in the substrate at concentrations of 0, 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 mg a. i L- 1.
