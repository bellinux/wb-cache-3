The game was played <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>baseball</b> field in Bentonville not well suited for typical cricket, so the players adapted new rules. The city has a league with 18 teams and a host of fans, mostly derived from the thousands of Indian natives drawn to Bentonville by Walmart software and IT jobs. Mayor Bob McCaslin says the City currently has no plans to build a public cricket pitch.|$|E
500|$|In 1970, Mike Flanagan was {{suffering}} arm problems, and many scouts {{decided that he}} did not have a future baseball career, but he could hit well, so Benjamin suggested to the Astros that they could use him in that capacity and wait to see if his arm would recuperate. [...] The Astros drafted Flanagan, but he decided not to sign, and instead attended University of Massachusetts Amherst <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>baseball</b> scholarship. [...] During the 1990 season, the Astros were approached by the Boston Red Sox, who needed pitching and were interested in Larry Andersen. [...] Benjamin recommended that they ask for Red Sox minor leaguer Jeff Bagwell in return. [...] The Astros were hesitant initially due to Bagwell's low home run totals, but Benjamin convinced them by explaining that his numbers were deceiving due to the large ballpark that he played in.|$|E

In response to the authorization request letter sent by John Gruber, a Pittsburgh sportswriter hired by the ATC to seek Wagner's permission, Wagner wrote that he [...] "did not care to have his picture in a package of cigarettes." [...] He threatened to seek legal action against ATC if they went ahead and created his baseball card.|$|E
