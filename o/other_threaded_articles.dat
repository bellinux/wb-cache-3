5000|$|Tokens {{and mutual}} {{exclusion}} (mutex) mechanisms are locks.

40|$|Isolation is a {{fundamental}} ingredient in concurrent programs.

50|$|Reorderings {{can come}} into play in {{incorrectly}} synchronized multithreaded programs, where one thread is able to observe the effects of <b>other</b> <b>threads,</b> and {{may be able to}} detect that variable accesses become visible to <b>other</b> <b>threads</b> in a different order than executed or specified in the program.Most of the time, one thread doesn't care what the other is doing. But when it does, that's what synchronization is for.|$|R
5000|$|Filters and <b>other</b> <b>threaded</b> lens {{accessories}} can be {{used with}} an adapter tube available from Canon or third party suppliers.|$|R
5000|$|Atomic {{operations}} : Shared {{data are}} accessed by using atomic operations which cannot be interrupted by <b>other</b> <b>threads.</b> This usually requires using special machine language instructions, {{which might be}} available in a runtime library. Since the operations are atomic, the shared data are always kept in a valid state, no matter how <b>other</b> <b>threads</b> access it. Atomic operations {{form the basis of}} many thread locking mechanisms, and are used to implement mutual exclusion primitives.|$|R
50|$|The {{context switch}} {{measured}} from signaling point in ISR to <b>other</b> <b>thread</b> recovery takes 10us (for fosc=25 MHz) in the DioneOS system.|$|R
5000|$|Ligation {{by tying}} off the eyestalk tightly with {{surgical}} or <b>other</b> <b>thread.</b> This method {{also has the}} advantage of immediate wound closure.|$|R
50|$|In Java, {{to prevent}} thread {{interference}} and memory consistency errors, blocks of code are wrapped into synchronized (lock_object) sections. This forces any thread {{to acquire the}} said lock object before it can execute the block. The lock is automatically released when thread leaves the block or enter the waiting state within the block. Any variable updates, made by the thread in synchronized block, become visible to <b>other</b> <b>threads</b> whenever those <b>other</b> <b>threads</b> similarly acquires the lock.|$|R
50|$|<b>Other</b> <b>threads</b> {{that used}} the Whitworth 55° angle include Brass Threads, British Standard Conduit (BSCon), Model Engineers (ME), and British Standard Copper (BSCopper).|$|R
5000|$|Convoying: all <b>other</b> <b>threads</b> {{have to wait}} if {{a thread}} holding a lock is descheduled due to a time-slice {{interrupt}} or page fault.|$|R
5000|$|Hair {{tourniquet}} {{a condition}} where a hair or <b>other</b> <b>thread</b> becomes tied around a toe or finger tightly enough {{to cut off}} blood flow.|$|R
50|$|The memory model defines when {{multiple}} threads may {{access the}} same memory location, and specifies when updates by one thread become visible to <b>other</b> <b>threads.</b>|$|R
5000|$|An {{instruction}} may enable another <b>thread.</b> The <b>other</b> <b>thread</b> {{is pushed}} onto {{the bottom of}} the deque, but the processor continues execution of its current thread.|$|R
5000|$|Yet {{another problem}} with mutual {{exclusion}} approaches is that the assumption of complete atomicity made by some single-threaded code creates sporadic unacceptably long inter-Thread delays in a concurrent environment. In particular, Iterators and bulk operations like putAll (...) and others can take a length of time proportional to the Map size, delaying <b>other</b> <b>Threads</b> that expect predictably low latency for non-bulk operations. For example, a multi-threaded web server cannot allow some responses to be delayed by long-running iterations of <b>other</b> <b>threads</b> executing <b>other</b> requests that are searching for a particular value. Related to this {{is the fact that}} Threads that lock the Map do not actually have any requirement ever to relinquish the lock, and an infinite loop in the owner Thread may propagate permanent blocking to <b>other</b> <b>Threads.</b> Slow owner Threads can sometimes be Interrupted. Hash-based Maps also are subject to spontaneous delays during rehashing.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{approach}} is to turn the naive algorithm into a critical section, preventing <b>other</b> <b>threads</b> from disrupting it, using a lock. Once again fixing the non-atomic counter algorithm: ...|$|R
5000|$|Modern {{operating}} systems also provide system calls that allow process <b>threads</b> to create <b>other</b> <b>threads</b> {{and wait for}} them to terminate ("join" [...] them) in a similar fashion.|$|R
5000|$|... barrier: each thread {{waits until}} all of the <b>other</b> <b>threads</b> of a team have reached this point. A {{work-sharing}} construct has an implicit barrier synchronization at the end.|$|R
50|$|When {{writing a}} multi-threaded program, the {{programmer}} may write each thread as {{a sequence of}} instructions without specifying the timing of any instruction relative to instructions in <b>other</b> <b>threads.</b>|$|R
50|$|Super-linear speedups {{can also}} occur when {{performing}} backtracking in parallel: an exception in one thread can cause several <b>other</b> <b>threads</b> to backtrack early, {{before they reach}} the exception themselves.|$|R
5000|$|... copyprivate: {{used with}} single {{to support the}} copying of data values from private objects on one thread (the single thread) to the {{corresponding}} objects on <b>other</b> <b>threads</b> in the team.|$|R
5000|$|When {{multiple}} processes share a non-parallel proof resource (like a file {{to write}} in), their requests are executed sequentially. Therefore, each thread must {{wait until the}} <b>other</b> <b>thread</b> releases the resource.|$|R
5000|$|Thread crashes a process: {{an illegal}} {{operation}} {{performed by a}} thread crashes the entire process; therefore, one misbehaving thread can disrupt the processing of all the <b>other</b> <b>threads</b> in the application.|$|R
50|$|A {{program may}} execute code in several threads {{simultaneously}} in a shared address space where {{each of those}} threads has access to {{virtually all of the}} memory of every <b>other</b> <b>thread.</b> Thread safety is a property that allows code to run in multithreaded environments by re-establishing some of the correspondences between the actual flow of control and the text of the program, by means of synchronization.|$|R
5000|$|The {{solution}} is to use condition variables. Conceptually a condition variable is a queue of threads, associated with a monitor, on which a thread may wait for some condition to become true. Thus each condition variable [...] is associated with an assertion [...] While a thread is waiting on a condition variable, that thread is not considered to occupy the monitor, and so <b>other</b> <b>threads</b> may enter the monitor to change the monitor's state. In most types of monitors, these <b>other</b> <b>threads</b> may signal the condition variable [...] to indicate that assertion [...] is true in the current state.|$|R
