50|$|Not {{only have}} they found rock {{paintings}} at sites {{but they also}} have found lithic assemblages and pottery assemblages as well. The most challenging part of this kind of archaeology is dating the rock art, as radiocarbon is not possible. Other artifacts found on sites are often used to try to date the paintings uncovered. Another worry about archaeology for rock art is weathering can also occur, especially because the art is exposed to the weather almost always. Almost all rock art in Africa is put on <b>open-faces,</b> exposed completely to the elements. Because of weathering we have lose some information {{but a lot of the}} rock art still survives. Vandalism has also been reported at sites.|$|R

In the twelfth story is the office of Carteret & Carteret. The factory where they make the mill supplies and leather belting is in Brooklyn. Those commodities--to say nothing of Brooklyn--not being of interest to you, let us hold the incidents within the confines of a one-act, one-scene play, thereby lessening the toil of the reader and the expenditure of the publisher. So, if you have the courage to face four pages of type and Carteret & Carteret's office boy, Percival, you shall sit on a varnished chair in the inner office and peep at the little comedy of the Old Nigger Man, the Hunting-Case Watch, and the <b>Open-Faced</b> Question--mostly borrowed from the late Mr. Frank Stockton, as you will conclude.|$|R
