5|$|Another {{concern is}} the fact that {{sugarcane}} fields are traditionally burned just before harvest to avoid harm to the workers, by removing the sharp leaves and killing snakes and other harmful animals, and also to fertilize the fields with ash. Mechanization will reduce pollution from burning fields and has higher productivity than people, and due to mechanization the number <b>of</b> <b>temporary</b> workers in the sugarcane plantations has already declined. By the 2008 harvest season, around 47% of the cane was collected with harvesting machines.|$|E
5|$|In August 1886, Lieutenant General Philip Sheridan sent Company M, 1st U.S. Cavalry to the Park, {{where they}} {{established}} Camp Sheridan, named after General Sheridan, at Mammoth Hot Springs. Camp Sheridan consisted of an arrangement <b>of</b> <b>temporary</b> facilities {{at the base}} of Capitol Hill just east of the Mammoth Hot Springs travertine terraces. None of the facilities that comprised Camp Sheridan remain as they were all removed over the years.|$|E
40|$|In this study, we {{investigate}} (1) {{differences in the}} psychological contract <b>of</b> <b>temporaries</b> and permanents, and (2) {{the extent to which}} possible differences are explained by the preferences and prospects <b>of</b> <b>temporaries.</b> Three psychological contract types are distinguished. The relational psychological contract is highly socio-emotional in nature, while economic content is foremost in the transactional psychological contract. Employability considerations dominate the new psychological contract. Results (N= 624) show that the psychological contract of permanents is more relational and more transactional as compared to the psychological contract <b>of</b> <b>temporaries.</b> No such differences are found with respect to the new psychological contract. Preference for temporary employment or volition is negatively related to both relational and transactional psychological contracts, while it is unrelated to the new psychological contract. Employment prospects are positively related to the relational and the transactional psychological contract. They are unrelated to the new psychological contract.

5|$|On January 12, 2010, Haiti {{was struck}} by a magnitude-7.0 {{earthquake}}, the country's most severe earthquake in over 200 years. The epicenter of the quake was just outside the Haitian capital Port-au-Prince. Over 230,000 civilians have been confirmed dead by the Haitian government because of the disaster and around 300,000 have been injured. Approximately 1.2 million people are homeless and {{it has been reported that}} the lack <b>of</b> <b>temporary</b> shelter may lead to the outbreak of disease.|$|E
5|$|Relief efforts began almost immediately, and {{hospitals}} quickly became full. Rescue trains began arriving from across eastern Canada and the north-eastern United States, but were impeded by a blizzard. Construction <b>of</b> <b>temporary</b> shelters {{to house the}} many people left homeless began soon after the disaster. The initial judicial inquiry found Mont-Blanc to {{have been responsible for}} the disaster, but a later appeal determined that both vessels were to blame. There are several memorials to the victims of the explosion in the North End.|$|E
5|$|Services {{were held}} in a number <b>of</b> <b>temporary</b> locations. In 1915 and 1917 {{respectively}} the local chapters of the B'nai B'rith and the National Council of Jewish Women were formed. Together they purchased a church in 1921, and converted it {{for use as a}} Phoenix's first synagogue by the Phoenix Hebrew Center Association. The Association soon became defunct, and the building was taken over by the Congregation Beth Israel.|$|E

FRAC possesses works by Aurélie Nemours, Olivier Debré, Mario Merz and Panamarenko, among other artists.|$|E
5|$|The museum aims to {{illustrate}} the history, geology and community of Axbridge {{and the surrounding area}} (the area of the old Axbridge Rural District, which included many neighbouring villages such as Cheddar, Wedmore, Mark and Winscombe). There is a core of long-term and permanent exhibits, reviewed regularly for possible changes, updates, and revised displays and information, and there is a programme <b>of</b> <b>temporary</b> exhibitions to reflect many aspects of local life and heritage.|$|E
5|$|These {{analyses}} are conducted when traveling empty, loading and unloading, when partially and fully loaded, and under conditions <b>of</b> <b>temporary</b> overloading. Places {{subject to the}} largest stresses are studied carefully, such as hold-bottoms, hatch-covers, bulkheads between holds, and the bottoms of ballast tanks. Great Lakes bulkers also must be designed to withstand springing, or developing resonance with the waves, which can cause fatigue fractures.|$|E

5|$|A {{disastrous}} {{fire started}} {{on the seventh floor}} on the night of 16 March 1954 and spread downwards. The keepers had no time to raise the alarm and were driven out of the lighthouse onto the rocks but rescued the next day when the relief vessel arrived as part of its regular schedule. The heat of the fire caused damage to both the interior and the structure and a lightship and series <b>of</b> <b>temporary</b> lights were installed during reconstruction. Three new generators were placed in the lighthouse to provide an electric light source, the lantern being re-lit on 6 August 1959.|$|E
5|$|After enlisting and {{completing}} his basic training at Trentham he was posted to 22nd Reinforcements, 2nd Battalion, Auckland Regiment within the New Zealand Division. Gallaher left New Zealand aboard the Aparima in February 1917 and reached Britain on 2May. Gallaher {{was a member}} of the ship's Sports Committee and spent time organising and practising for a planned rugby match at the Cape of Good Hopeit is unknown if the match ever took place. After arriving in England he was promoted to the rank <b>of</b> <b>temporary</b> sergeant and dispatched to Sling Camp for further training. His rank was confirmed as sergeant on 6June 1917.|$|E
5|$|Air Commodore Arthur William Murphy, DFC, AFC, FRAeS (17November 1891– 21April 1963) was {{a senior}} {{engineer}} and aviator in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). He accompanied Captain Henry Wrigley on the first trans-Australia flight from Melbourne to Darwin in 1919, a feat that earned both men the Air Force Cross. Murphy later {{played a leading role}} in military aircraft maintenance and production. A veteran of World WarI, he served first as a mechanic and then as a pilot with the Australian Flying Corps. Based in the Middle East, he flew with No.1 Squadron and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. Murphy was the first airman on the RAAF's strength when it formed in 1921, and rose to the rank <b>of</b> <b>temporary</b> air commodore during World WarII, commanding No.1 Aircraft Depot and No.4 Maintenance Group. He was also the RAAF's first Inspector of Air Accidents. A fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society, Murphy retired from the military in 1946, and died in 1963 aged seventy-one.|$|E

5|$|Both {{ships were}} fitted with three {{temporary}} masts for their delivery voyages, although only Cerberus had her freeboard raised {{with the addition}} <b>of</b> <b>temporary</b> bulwarks. The ships spent {{the bulk of their}} service lives in reserve and rarely, if ever, left their home port. Magdala was sold in January 1903, but Cerberus was hulked in 1900 and transferred to the Royal Australian Navy when it was formed in 1911. She was renamed HMAS Platypus II in 1918 and sold in 1924. Stripped of all salvageable material, she was scuttled in 1926 as a breakwater, and her remains are still visible today.|$|E
5|$|Clifford {{had already}} {{achieved}} {{prominence in the}} north where, as an ally of {{the son of the}} earl of Northumberland, he took part in a feud against the Neville family, the Percy's natural rivals in Yorkshire. This consisted of a series of armed raids, assaults and skirmishes, and included an ambush on one of the younger Nevilles' wedding party in 1453. Historians have seen a direct connection between his involvement in the local feud in the north with the Nevilles, and his involvement in the national struggle against the duke of York, whom the Nevilles were closely allied with in the late 1450s. Although this was supposedly a period <b>of</b> <b>temporary</b> peace between the factions, Clifford and his allies appear to have made numerous attempts to ambush the Neville and Yorkist lords.|$|E
5|$|Collier {{applied to}} the Admiralty for the {{opportunity}} to clear his name, but this was not satisfied. Friends and relations had become increasingly concerned about his mental state as a result. His brother took the precaution of removing the razors from his home, but Collier appears to have smuggled one to his room, and used it to cut his own throat early in the morning on 24 March 1824. His servant who was sleeping in the same room immediately brought help, but nothing could be done and Collier died less than five minutes after inflicting the injury. The inquest later determined that 'The deceased destroyed himself, being in a state <b>of</b> <b>temporary</b> mental derangement.' The baronetcy became extinct upon his death.|$|E

5|$|Construction of Lerkendal {{started as}} a public works during the 1930s, as a measure to create jobs. It opened on 10 August 1947, and {{consisted}} of a main grass field, two gravel fields, two handball courts and two tennis courts. The main field had a spectator capacity for 37,000 on temporary stands, making it the second-largest stadium in the country. The long sides consisted <b>of</b> <b>temporary</b> wooden stands, with seating on the south stand and standing places on terraces on the north stand. The end sides of the stadium consisted of grass embankments at a 30 percent angle, allowing for standing space for spectators without having to build stands. Changing rooms were located in a nearby German-built barracks dating from the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|During {{the course}} of the evaluation, the Tri-partite pilots {{developed}} a typical sortie routine for the Kestrel of conducting short take-offs (STO) and returning to base on vertical landings. This manner of operation (STOVL) was judged to be the optimal practice. Operating from rough airstrips was also trialled at nearby RAF Bircham Newton, where the aircraft proved adept at traversing boggy ground and taking off from a variety <b>of</b> <b>temporary</b> ground coverings. During testing one aircraft was lost when a pilot tried to do a rolling take-off with the parking brake on; the evaluations were finalised in November 1965.|$|E
5|$|During {{the later}} {{stages of the}} Second World War, the bailey was {{levelled}} and used to hold a set <b>of</b> <b>temporary</b> Nissen huts that formed a hospital for United States Army personnel. In 1945, the site was leased by the Air Ministry for use as offices. The Ministry of Works took over the guardianship of the castle in 1951. The ministry {{put pressure on the}} Air Ministry to leave the site, which occurred in 1956; the bailey was then grassed over again. Archaeological excavations were carried out in the bailey between 1961 and 1982, uncovering many of the medieval buildings.|$|E
