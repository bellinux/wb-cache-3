5|$|Trying {{to extend}} these {{functions}} {{to the general}} case of noninteger powers of complex numbers that are not positive reals leads to difficulties. Either we define discontinuous functions or multivalued functions. Neither of these <b>options</b> <b>is</b> entirely satisfactory.|$|E
5|$|The National Rail Administration has {{developed}} a plan for possible expansion of the commuter rail. The main possibilities have been discussed: rebuilding the section from Sandnes to Egersund to double track, taking back into use the Ålgård Line, which branches off at Ganddal, and building a new branch from south of Gausel to Stavanger Airport, Sola. An alternative to several of the <b>options</b> <b>is</b> a light rail, {{which may or may}} not be built as a tram-train, which would use parts of the existing double track between Stavanger and Sandnes.|$|E
25|$|Saint Louis {{has both}} {{dormitory}} and apartment space on-campus. Up-to-date information on housing <b>options</b> <b>is</b> {{carried on the}} University's website.|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} spreads in which unequal number of <b>options</b> <b>are</b> {{simultaneously}} purchased and written. When more <b>options</b> <b>are</b> written than purchased, it is a ratio spread. When more <b>options</b> <b>are</b> purchased than written, it is a backspread.|$|R
50|$|An <b>option</b> <b>is</b> {{the right}} to convey a piece of property. The person {{granting}} the <b>option</b> <b>is</b> called the optionor (or more usually, the grantor) {{and the person who}} has the benefit of the <b>option</b> <b>is</b> called the optionee (or more usually, the beneficiary).|$|R
50|$|An <b>option</b> <b>is</b> {{said to have}} {{intrinsic}} value if the <b>option</b> <b>is</b> in-the-money. When out-of-the-money, its {{intrinsic value}} is zero.|$|R
25|$|The {{most common}} way to trade <b>options</b> <b>is</b> via {{standardized}} options contracts that are listed by various futures and options exchanges.|$|E
25|$|If none {{of these}} <b>options</b> <b>is</b> available, jen {{may be used as}} a placeholder: amas becomes jenas am’. The choice of where the tense suffix ends up is largely a stylistic choice.|$|E
25|$|A complex yet {{extensive}} {{range of}} visual customization <b>options</b> <b>is</b> available, including body kits, wheels, {{and a full}} range of colors & vinyls, including freehand drawing ability. The most obvious difference is that the graphics and racing physics in this version are completely different from the other versions, giving it a retro look and feel reminiscent of much older pre-GameCube or Mario Kart type games.|$|E
5000|$|If the [...] <b>option</b> <b>is</b> not {{specified}} and neither a [...] nor a [...] <b>option</b> <b>is</b> specified, it is implementation-defined {{which of the}} [...] and [...] <b>options</b> will <b>be</b> used as the default.|$|R
25|$|Another <b>option</b> <b>was</b> to realign the A2100 {{north of}} the junction, but this <b>option</b> <b>was</b> less {{favourable}} due to environmental concerns.|$|R
5000|$|Create {{symbolic}} links {{instead of}} hard links. If the -s <b>option</b> <b>is</b> specified, the -L and -P <b>options</b> <b>are</b> silently ignored.|$|R
25|$|A further, often ignored, risk in {{derivatives}} such as <b>options</b> <b>is</b> counterparty risk. In {{an option}} contract this {{risk is that}} the seller won't sell or buy the underlying asset as agreed. The risk can be minimized by using a financially strong intermediary able {{to make good on}} the trade, but in a major panic or crash the number of defaults can overwhelm even the strongest intermediaries.|$|E
25|$|One {{reason for}} {{the large number of}} <b>options</b> <b>is</b> that, as noted previously, {{rotations}} in three dimensions (and higher) do not commute. If we reverse a given sequence of rotations, we get a different outcome. This also implies that we cannot compose two rotations by adding their corresponding angles. Thus Euler angles are not vectors, despite a similarity in appearance as a triplet of numbers.|$|E
25|$|Spent {{sulfuric acid}} is {{regenerated}} by thermal decomposition outside the battery {{limits of the}} sulfuric acid alkylation unit. This may be accomplished on the refinery site in sulfuric acid regeneration equipment operated by the refinery or in a commercial sulfuric acid regeneration plant which serves several refiners. The choice between these two <b>options</b> <b>is</b> site specific and usually depends on capital versus operating cost considerations and {{the proximity of the}} refinery to an existing commercial regeneration plant.|$|E
50|$|The <b>options</b> <b>are</b> often {{considered}} a correlation trade since {{the value of}} the <b>option</b> <b>is</b> sensitive to the correlation between the various basket components.|$|R
30|$|A {{currency}} <b>option</b> <b>is</b> {{a contract}} that gives the holder {{the right to buy}} or sell a certain amount of foreign currency at a fixed exchange rate (exercise price) upon exercise of the <b>option.</b> American <b>options</b> <b>are</b> <b>options</b> that can <b>be</b> exercised at any time before they expire. European <b>options</b> can <b>be</b> exercised only during a specified period immediately before expiration.|$|R

25|$|Which {{option is}} best {{depends on the}} stage of the disease, the Gleason score, and the PSA level. Other {{important}} factors are age, general health, and a person's views about potential treatments and their possible side effects. Because most treatments can have significant side effects, such as erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence, treatment discussions often focus on balancing the goals of therapy with the risks of lifestyle alterations. A combination of the treatment <b>options</b> <b>is</b> often recommended for managing prostate cancer.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{excellent}} {{access to}} the GO Transit and York Region Transit systems, the two systems are not integrated. In 2011, only 6.9% of working Whitchurch–Stouffville residents used public transit {{to get to work}} (compare 14% for Ontario), and only 2.7% walked or cycled to work (compare 3.6% for Whitchurch–Stouffville in 2006, and 6.3% for Ontario in 2011). Excellent public transportation <b>options</b> <b>is</b> an increasingly urgent issue for Whitchurch–Stouffville as the town continues to grow with residents who commute daily to Toronto (see Economy below).|$|E
25|$|While {{physical}} {{limits to}} transistor scaling such as source-to-drain leakage, limited gate metals, and limited options for channel material have been reached, new avenues for continued scaling are open. The most promising {{of these approaches}} rely on using the spin state of electron spintronics, tunnel junctions, and advanced confinement of channel materials via nano-wire geometry. A comprehensive list of available device choices shows that {{a wide range of}} device <b>options</b> <b>is</b> open for continuing Moore's law into the next few decades. Spin-based logic and memory options are being developed actively in industrial labs, as well as academic labs.|$|E
50|$|<b>Options</b> {{contracts}} have <b>been</b> {{known for}} many centuries. However, both trading activity and academic interest increased when, as from 1973, <b>options</b> <b>were</b> issued with standardized terms and traded through a guaranteed clearing {{house at the}} Chicago Board Options Exchange. Today, many <b>options</b> <b>are</b> created in a standardized form and traded through clearing houses on regulated options exchanges, while other over-the-counter <b>options</b> <b>are</b> written as bilateral, customized contracts between a single buyer and seller, {{one or both of}} which may be a dealer or market-maker. <b>Options</b> <b>are</b> part of a larger class of financial instruments known as derivative products or simply derivatives.|$|R

25|$|Continuous row by row, or {{column by}} column: The {{numbering}} starts at top {{left with the}} northwesternmost sheet, then rises on the same row towards the right (east) to jump {{from there to the}} left (westernmost) sheet of the next lower (southern) row, etc. In some countries, this system is applied not row by row, but column by column. The disadvantage of both <b>options</b> <b>is</b> that in each case two of the four sheets adjacent to each sheet are not directly identifiable from the numbers. To address this problem, the neighbouring sheet numbers are usually printed on the map surround of each sheet. Example: Belgique (1:50,000).|$|E
25|$|Building a MANET {{is still}} {{untested}} under the OLPC's current configuration and hardware environment. Although one {{goal of the}} laptop {{is that all of}} its software be open source, the source code for this routing protocol is currently closed source. While there are open-source alternatives such as OLSR or B.A.T.M.A.N., none of these <b>options</b> <b>is</b> yet available running at the data-link layer (Layer 2) on the Wi-Fi subsystem's co-processor; this is critical to OLPC's power efficiency scheme. Whether Marvell Technology Group, the producer of the wireless chip set and owner of the current meshing protocol software, will make the firmware open source is still an unanswered question. As of 2011, it has not done so.|$|E
25|$|The Drupal core {{search is}} {{ineffective}} at searching content: There are contributed modules that will greatly improve the search functionality on a Drupal website, {{but they are}} not easily accessible due to a high learning curve and the difficulty users have in general of finding the right module. One of the faceted search <b>options</b> <b>is</b> Apache Solr Search Integration module, however, the module requires a dedicated server or virtual private server (VPS) to operate because Solr must run on a servlet container, e.g. Tomcat, Jetty or Resin. These requirements make it harder for a Drupal website to have a functional search feature. In response some companies have created Apache Solr SaaS products.|$|E

25|$|For many {{classes of}} options, {{traditional}} valuation techniques are intractable {{because of the}} complexity of the instrument. In these cases, a Monte Carlo approach may often be useful. Rather than attempt to solve the differential equations of motion that describe the option's value in relation to the underlying security's price, a Monte Carlo model uses simulation to generate random price paths of the underlying asset, each of which results in a payoff for the option. The average of these payoffs can be discounted to yield an expectation value for the option. Note though, that despite its flexibility, using simulation for American styled <b>options</b> <b>is</b> somewhat more complex than for lattice based models.|$|E
25|$|The MRHA, the Sedition Act, section 298A of the Penal Code and the ISA {{all share}} an {{underlying}} objective: to maintain public order. The greatest {{disparity between the}} MRHA and the other pieces of legislation {{lies in the fact}} that the former provides for a much more benign resolution of issues. One commentator has said that there seems to be no apparent purpose for having a wide array of outcomes to choose from when dealing with the same mischief – religious disharmony. On the other hand, it might be argued that given a highly sensitive topic like religion, which incites deep feelings, an arsenal of <b>options</b> <b>is</b> vital so that an outcome best suiting the scenario can be tailored. Nevertheless, the MRHA, despite having the least severe consequences, has not yet been invoked.|$|E
500|$|Due to the {{capacity}} of the Volt's battery pack it qualifies for the maximum [...] federal tax credit as specified in the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. The federal tax credit phases out over a one-year period after the manufacturer has sold at least 200,000 vehicles in the U.S. Several states also have additional incentives or rebates available for plug-in electric vehicles for qualifying buyers. The 2011 Volt price including all available regular production and premium <b>options</b> <b>is</b> , including destination charges and before tax credits or any subsidies.

50|$|A call <b>option</b> <b>is</b> {{trading at}} $1.50 with the {{underlying}} trading at $42.05. The implied volatility of the <b>option</b> <b>is</b> {{determined to be}} 18.0%. A short time later, the <b>option</b> <b>is</b> trading at $2.10 with the underlying at $43.34, yielding an implied volatility of 17.2%. Even though the option's price is higher at the second measurement, it is still considered cheaper based on volatility. The {{reason is that the}} underlying needed to hedge the call <b>option</b> can <b>be</b> sold for a higher price.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper will}} mainly {{focus on a}} path-dependent option—Asian options. The value of a path-dependent <b>option</b> <b>is</b> {{affected}} by how {{the price of the}} underlying asset was reached at the time of maturity.

40|$|This article {{proposes a}} new test to {{evaluate}} whether <b>options</b> <b>are</b> a redundant asset class. The methodology permits to test between two sets of competing option pricing models: the deterministic volatility models and the stochastic models. In the deterministic volatility framework, <b>options</b> <b>are</b> redundant assets and their payoff can be replicated by dynamic trading in the underlying and the risk-free assets. A stochastic model introduces an additional risk factor and in this setting <b>options</b> <b>are</b> {{needed in order to}} complete the market. The procedure relies on principal components methods. The Monte Carlo simulations reported in the article indicate that the new procedure provides simple and useful diagnostics for detection if <b>options</b> <b>are</b> redundant. We apply the method to S&P 500 index and options with different moneyness. The empirical results suggest that <b>options</b> <b>are</b> not redundant. ...|$|R
