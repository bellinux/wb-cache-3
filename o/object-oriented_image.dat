Two multi-spectral QuickBird images were acquired in 2004 and 2005 for {{a section of the}} Daly River in north Australia. These data were collected coincidently with vegetation and geomorphic field data. Indicators of riparian condition, including percentage canopy cover, organic litter, canopy continuity, bank stability, flood damage, riparian zone width and vegetation overhang, were then mapped. Field measurements and vegetation indices were empirically related using regression analysis to develop algorithms for mapping organic litter and canopy cover (R 2 = 0. 59 - 0. 78). Using a standard nearest-neighbour algorithm, <b>object-oriented</b> supervised <b>image</b> classification provided thematic information (overall accuracies 81 - 90 %) for mapping riparian zone width and vegetation overhang.
