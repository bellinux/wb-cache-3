5|$|Dusky woodswallows {{are known}} to spontaneously 'wag' or swivel their tales fervently, a trait which is common among many <b>other</b> <b>species</b> <b>of</b> woodswallow.|$|E
5|$|No <b>other</b> <b>species</b> <b>of</b> tree occurs {{closer to}} the coast at Cape Byron, making B.integrifolia the most easterly tree on the Australian mainland.|$|E
5|$|After later {{studies were}} {{conducted}} with {{a larger number of}} birds, the advisories were revised and another was added for cinnamon teal. Seven <b>other</b> <b>species</b> <b>of</b> duck were studied and found to have levels of mercury below EPA guidelines, thus being determined safe to eat.|$|E
50|$|In {{the past}} it was {{probably}} a very sought-after logged timber <b>species,</b> similar to <b>others</b> <b>species</b> <b>of</b> its family.|$|R
50|$|The {{species has}} a {{worldwide}} distribution. T. decipiens slime molds {{live on the}} deadwood of conifers and broadleaf trees year-round. The slime mould is associated with, among <b>others,</b> <b>species</b> <b>of</b> the genera Trichia, Arcyria and Cribraria as well as Lycogala epidendrum and Stemonitis typhina.|$|R
5|$|P. semilanceata, {{like all}} <b>others</b> <b>species</b> <b>of</b> the genus Psilocybe, is a {{saprobic}} fungus, meaning it obtains nutrients by breaking down organic matter. The mushroom is {{also associated with}} sedges in moist areas of fields, and it is thought {{to live on the}} decaying root remains.|$|R
5|$|Apart from A. sarcophagus, A. arctunguis and A. libratus, several <b>other</b> <b>species</b> <b>of</b> Albertosaurus {{have been}} named. All {{of these are}} today seen as younger {{synonyms}} of other species or as nomina dubia, and are not assigned to Albertosaurus.|$|E
5|$|As a whole, Oryzomyini {{includes}} over {{a hundred}} species in about thirty genera. Oryzomyini {{is one of several}} tribes within the subfamily Sigmodontinae of the family Cricetidae, which encompasses hundreds of <b>other</b> <b>species</b> <b>of</b> mainly small rodents, distributed chiefly in Eurasia and the Americas.|$|E
5|$|At {{least two}} subspecies, T. m. merula and T. m. nigropileus, will mimic <b>other</b> <b>species</b> <b>of</b> birds, cats, humans or alarms, {{but this is}} usually quiet and hard to detect.|$|E
50|$|The sucker is {{primarily}} a carnivore. Most of its diet consists of Chironomidae, although it will consume many <b>other</b> <b>of</b> <b>species</b> <b>of</b> insects when they are available. The sucker will also consume detritus.|$|R
50|$|Resident {{wildlife}} include grebe, heron, blackbird, beaver, muskrat, black tailed {{deer and}} <b>other</b> <b>species</b> typical <b>of</b> upland and wetland habitats.|$|R
40|$|Euritmia hamulisetosa gen. et sp. n. is {{characterized}} by many rows of sessile macrotubercles without terminal papillae; all anterior appendages are short and setae simple. Three <b>others</b> <b>species</b> <b>of</b> Sphaerodoridae collected from the Gibraltar Strait region are Ephesiella abyssorum, Sphaerodoridium claparedeii and Sphaerodoropsis minutum. Sphaerodoropsis capense (Day, 1963) is transferred to the new genus Euritmia. Peer reviewe...|$|R
5|$|Besides the horse, {{there are}} seven <b>other</b> <b>species</b> <b>of</b> genus Equus in the Equidae family. These are the ass or donkey, Equus asinus; the {{mountain}} zebra, Equus zebra; plains zebra, Equus quagga; Grévy's zebra, Equus grevyi; the kiang, Equus kiang; and the onager, Equus hemionus.|$|E
5|$|Black mambas are {{generally}} solitary, but not strictly so; {{as a rule}} they interact very little except in male rivalry during the mating season. However, black mambas are well known to share retreats occasionally, either with other mambas, or sometimes with <b>other</b> <b>species</b> <b>of</b> snakes.|$|E
5|$|In the Northern Territory, P. fimbriata has {{no special}} tactics against other jumping spiders {{and tries to}} treat {{them as if they}} were web spiders, and then either tries to jump on them or gives up. Hence this variant is poor at {{catching}} other jumping spiders. The Northern Territory variant of P. fimbriata is not as good as the Queensland one as catching web spiders, but better than the Sri Lanka variant and some <b>other</b> <b>species</b> <b>of</b> Portia. It is not enthusiastic about pursuing insects, but very good at catching those it pursues, as the performance table above shows While pursuits by the Queensland variant typically take 26minutes, those of the Northern Territory variant typically take 3 to 5minutes, like some <b>other</b> <b>species</b> <b>of</b> Portia.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the genera Cystoderma, Cystodermella and Ripartitella from Atlantic Rainforest, Southeast Brazil. They are {{represented}} by Cystoderma chocoanum, Cystodermella contusifolia, C. sipariana and Ripartitella brasiliensis. Cystoderma chocoanum is reported {{for the first time}} outside the type locality (Colombia) and its relationship with <b>others</b> <b>species</b> <b>of</b> Cystoderma, based on nLSU rDNA sequences, is discussed...|$|R

50|$|The bird {{life in the}} {{reservoir}} area is very notable, as 20,000 migratory birds <b>of</b> <b>species</b> <b>of</b> raptors, storks, pelicans and <b>others</b> <b>species</b> <b>of</b> birds have been sighted. The ferruginous duck (Aythya nyroca), pallid harrier (Circus macrourus), greater spotted eagle (Aquila clanga), eastern imperial eagle (Aquila heliaca) and sociable lapwing (Vanellus gregarius) {{are some of the}} birds which are of conservation concern, according to the 2008 IUCN Red List.|$|R
5|$|Like many <b>other</b> <b>species</b> <b>of</b> felid, servals are {{occasionally}} kept as pets, {{although their}} wild nature means that ownership of servals is regulated in most countries.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the diets of <b>other</b> <b>species</b> <b>of</b> porpoises. A {{dissection}} of three Burmeister's porpoises shows that they consume shrimp and euphausiids. A dissection of a beached Vaquita showed remains of squid and grunts. Nothing {{is known about}} the diet of the spectacled porpoise.|$|E
5|$|Phlorizin is a {{flavonoid}} that {{is found}} in apple trees, particularly in the leaves, and in only small amounts if at all in other plants, even <b>other</b> <b>species</b> <b>of</b> the Malus genus or related plants such as pear trees.|$|E
50|$|A revised {{taxonomy}} of Salamandridae places this species (together with all <b>other</b> Chinese <b>species</b> <b>of</b> Cynops) in genus Hypselotriton.|$|R

5|$|Banksia ilicifolia regenerates after bushfire by regrowing from epicormic shoots {{under its}} bark. Follicles open and release seeds after several years. It is weakly serotinous, like eight <b>other</b> Banksia <b>species,</b> all <b>of</b> {{which tend to}} occur in Western Australia's southwestern corner. The <b>other</b> two <b>species</b> <b>of</b> the {{subgenus}} Isostylis are killed by fire and regenerate by seed.|$|R
5|$|Public {{recreation}} {{activities include}} canoeing, birdwatching, and fishing. The creek {{is known for}} its trout population, which includes brook, brown and rainbow trout; it also contains many <b>other</b> <b>species</b> <b>of</b> fish. Northern hardwood trees and ruffed grouse live in the surrounding area.|$|E
5|$|The basic {{ingredient}} in maple syrup is the sap from the xylem of sugar maple or various <b>other</b> <b>species</b> <b>of</b> maple trees. It consists primarily of sucrose and water, with {{small amounts of}} the monosaccharides glucose and fructose from the invert sugar created in the boiling process.|$|E
5|$|The {{middle and}} upper reaches of Tangascootack Creek are nearly devoid of life due to acid mine drainage. However, the {{headwaters}} have some aquatic life, as they are further upstream. Brook trout and three <b>other</b> <b>species</b> <b>of</b> fish inhabit the creek. 13 species of benthic macroinvertebrate also inhabit it.|$|E
50|$|Like <b>other</b> <b>species</b> {{consisting}} <b>of</b> polar subunits, organolithium <b>species</b> aggregate.Formation <b>of</b> aggregates {{is influenced}} by electrostatic interactions, the coordination between lithium and surrounding solvent molecules or polar additives, and steric effects.|$|R

5|$|The only <b>other</b> <b>species</b> <b>of</b> Scyllarides {{to occur}} in the Eastern Atlantic is Scyllarides herklotsii, which differs from S.latus mostly in the {{ornamentation}} on the carapace; while in S.latus the tubercles (lumps projecting from the surface) are high and pronounced, they are lower and more rounded in S.herklotsii.|$|E
5|$|Unlike other Bungarus species, who are {{primarily}} snake-eaters, the many-banded krait usually feeds on fish, {{but it is}} also preys on <b>other</b> <b>species</b> <b>of</b> snakes, including members of its own species.
