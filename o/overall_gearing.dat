5000|$|... the American {{version was}} offered from 1990 to 1993 only. It was {{equipped}} the Intruders 45-degree crank pin offset as American Suzuki tests riders claimed the 75-degree crank offset made the engine feel dull and lifeless at US speeds.

The USA version has a secondary reduction of 1.133, where other markets have a 1.096 secondary reduction.|$|E
5000|$|Manual {{transmissions}} {{can include}} both synchronized and unsynchronized gearing. For example, reverse gear is usually unsynchronised, {{as the driver}} is only expected to engage it when the vehicle is at a standstill. Many older (up to 1970s) cars also lacked synchronisation on first gear (for various reasons—cost, typically [...] "shorter" [...] <b>overall</b> <b>gearing,</b> engines typically having more low-end torque, the extreme wear on a frequently used first gear synchroniser ...), meaning it also could only be used for moving away from a stop unless the driver became adept at double-declutching and had a particular need to regularly downshift into the lowest gear.|$|E

50|$|The most {{fundamental}} meaning {{is that of}} an <b>overall</b> <b>gear</b> ratio between engine and wheels, such that the car is over-geared, and cannot reach its potential top speed, i.e. the car could travel faster if it were in a lower gear, with the engine turning at higher RPM.|$|R

5000|$|The classic Swiss Army Bicycle, as {{used by the}} Swiss Bicycle Infantry. Officially called Ordonnanzfahrrad Modell 05, it was {{introduced}} in 1905 and in continuous use until replaced by the MO-93. It was built between 1905 and 1989 by Schwalbe, Cäsar, Cosmos and Condor. Swiss bicycle Infantry were phased out in 2001. The most recognisable feature of most Swiss Army Bicycles is the large carry case fitted into the frame. It is accessed from the right-hand side, whilst having a separate document and map compartment on the left-hand side. They were painted all-over basic black, usually semi-matt, although some later models were painted olive drab. Fittings and accessories were variously black, brown or olive drab in colour. The basic model saw many variations as it was adapted for use in many different fields of warfare. Some were stripped down of all non-essential fittings {{for use as a}} messenger transport. Fitted with a 57 cm one-size-fits-all frame for men between 1.55m and 1.95m tall, they had 650B (26" [...] x 1-1/2") wheels. They were typically fitted with a 20-tooth rear sprocket, and a 50-tooth chainring giving an <b>overall</b> <b>gearing</b> of 65 gear inches. Two-wheel trailers were used for carrying cargo or a stretcher.|$|E
40|$|Muscle {{structure}} {{changes with}} ageing {{in a manner}} that can alter its contractile mechanics, resulting in a reduction in strength and mobility. Fascicles within a muscle can shorten at slower velocities than the muscle belly, in a process known as belly gearing. Belly gearing allows the fascicles to produce a greater force when they contract. However, it may be compromised when we age. The gastrocnemii muscles in the calf were imaged in young adults and seniors using ultrasound. Their muscle structures were compared during standing and during ankle extensions. The <b>overall</b> <b>gearing</b> of a muscle-tendon-unit was largely determined by the belly gearing, but its variability was driven by changes in tendon stretch. The decrease in performance and power output in seniors may be associated with reduced gearing due to atrophy of the muscles...|$|E

50|$|An {{idler gear}} {{does not affect}} the gear ratio between the input and output shafts.

But, of course, the addition of each intermediate gear reverses the direction of rotation of the final gear.|$|R
50|$|The gear {{relies on}} the inter-meshing {{of a number of}} thin disks.

Results are compared with earlier predictions based on analytical, numerical and experimental methods. Load sharing among the mating gear teeth is discussed, and the <b>overall</b> <b>gear</b> mesh stiffness together with its cyclic variation along the path of contact is evaluated...|$|R
50|$|In North America the Hilux saw {{the use of}} four-wheel drive. It had a solid {{front axle}} and leaf suspension. The body saw a {{redesign}} that included single round headlights and a less complex body. This new 4WD setup featured a gear driven RF1A transfer case. This transfer case is unique in that its low-range reduction portion can be replicated, using what some refer to as a dual or triple transfer case. This results in a much lower <b>overall</b> <b>gear</b> ratio. It was the first Hilux available with an automatic transmission.|$|R
50|$|Alfine 700 is an {{internal}} epicyclic hub gear for bicycles, manufactured by Shimano since 2010. The 700 has 11 speeds, with intervals of approximately 29% {{for the first}} to second gear gap, and 13% - 14% for the other gears, resulting in an <b>overall</b> <b>gear</b> range of 409%. There is no direct drive 1:1 gear. It is operated by a single ratcheting trigger shifter with two-way release. When introduced it had a claimed weight of approximately 1600g without auxiliary components (bolts, actuator, cog, wire, shifter). Production models appeared to have a somewhat beefed up design. The internal mechanisms comprise three stepped planetary series in a sealed oil bath, for greater power transfer efficiency.|$|R
50|$|The Alfine 500 group, first {{introduced}} at Eurobike in 2006, included the epicyclic hub gear SG-S500. The internal mechanical {{design of the}} gear hub was based on that of the Shimano Nexus Inter 8, with two stepped planetary series, 5th gear being 1:1 direct drive, thus offering 8 speeds with percent intervals of 22,16,14,18,22,16,14, and an <b>overall</b> <b>gear</b> range of 307%, yet in a more attractive design than the Nexus, with better seals allowing slightly greater ruggedness, more attractive auxiliary components such as e.g. a ratcheting trigger shifter similar to the high-end Shimano derailleur shifters, and a hub shell with splines for mounting a disc brake rotor of the center lock standard. These mechanisms are grease-lubricated.|$|R
5000|$|The 599XX, {{based on}} 599 GTB, is a car {{designed}} for track use only {{and is not}} street legal. The rev limiter is raised to 9000 rpm, with the engine rated for [...] at 9000 rpm. Weight is reduced by reducing {{the weight of the}} engine unit components, the use of composite materials, and the use of carbon-fiber body parts and brake pads. A new gearbox shift strategy is introduced to cut <b>overall</b> <b>gear</b> change time to 60 ms. Aerodynamics were retuned to give more downforce (280 kg at 200 km/h, 630 kg at 300 km/h). The car also includes 29/67 R19 front and 31/71 R19 rear tyres with 19 × 11J wheel rims at the front and 19 × 12J at the rear.|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of bicycle chains, it is {{possible}} to modify the <b>overall</b> <b>gear</b> ratio of the chain drive by varying the diameter (and therefore, the tooth count) of the sprockets {{on each side of the}} chain. This is the basis of derailleur gears. A multi-speed bicycle, by providing two or three different-sized driving sprockets and up to 11 (as of 2014) different-sized driven sprockets, allows up to 33 different gear ratios. The resulting lower gear ratios make the bike easier to pedal up hills while the higher gear ratios make the bike more powerful to pedal on flats and downhills. In a similar way, manually changing the sprockets on a motorcycle can change the characteristics of acceleration and top speed by modifying the final drive gear ratio.|$|R

40|$|Space-compatible {{cryogenic}} valves are {{now required}} to operate between room and liquid helium temperatures. A remotely controllable cryogenic valve is described, {{which is made}} of bellows-type stainless steel and is operated by a miniature dc motor with integral gearset (485 : 1) at a nominal voltage of 28 Vdc. The power transmission provides a further reduction of 7. 2 : 1 to give an <b>overall</b> <b>gear</b> ratio of nearly 3500 : 1, assuring reliability of operation at low temperatures. Valve performance (leak rate) data are presented at LN 2, LHe, and SfHe temperatures at delivered torques of 18, 27, 31, and 35 N-m. At a closing torque of 31 N-m, a leak rate of 0. 028 scc/sec was achieved at 2 K, while at a torque of 18 N-m the leak rate at 300 K was less than 3 x 10 to the - 9 th scc/sec...|$|R

50|$|In {{this most}} common CVT system, {{there are two}} V-belt pulleys that are split {{perpendicular}} to their axes of rotation, with a V-belt running between them. The gear ratio is changed by moving the two sheaves of one pulley closer together and the two sheaves of the other pulley farther apart. The V-shaped {{cross section of the}} belt causes it to ride higher on one pulley and lower on the other. This changes the effective diameters of both pulleys, which changes the <b>overall</b> <b>gear</b> ratio. As the distance between the pulleys and the length of the belt does not change both pulleys must be adjusted (one bigger, the other smaller) simultaneously {{in order to maintain the}} proper amount of tension on the belt. Simple CVTs combining a centrifugal drive pulley with a spring loaded driven pulley often use belt tension to effect the conforming adjustments in the driven pulley. The V-belt needs to be very stiff in the pulley's axial direction in order to make only short radial movements while sliding in and out of the pulleys.|$|R
40|$|Landing gear is {{now well}} {{known to be a}} major source of {{aircraft}} noise. Several studies have also identified the importance of surface details in the noise generated by landing gears at high frequencies. However, the basic mechanisms of noise generation at lower frequencies are less well understood. In this study, we examine the effect of changes to the <b>overall</b> <b>gear</b> layout on the noise produced. 1 / 12 th scale models containing only the wheels, axles and main struts have been studied using two nested, 48 -microphone arrays in the closed-section Markham wind tunnel at Cambridge University. Local fairings have also been added to isolate and identify individual noise sources. Results indicate that shape and placement of the wheels can affect the overall noise level by at least 6 dB on simplified four wheel models. Changes in geometry were also found to substantially affect high frequency sources close to the main oleo, suggesting that noise sources from conventional, fully dressed gears might be equally susceptible to small changes in the overall design.

50|$|The tzero is a {{handmade}} electric {{sports car}} {{designed and built}} in very limited numbers by the U.S. company AC Propulsion. The tzero {{was based on the}} Piontek Sportech kit car, which consists of a fiberglass body built over a reinforced steel space frame with double wishbone independent suspension and rack and pinion steering. AC Propulsion added the AC-150 drivetrain, a single-speed electric system with an <b>overall</b> <b>gear</b> ratio of 9:1. Launched in January 1997, only three prototypes were built and plans for commercial production were dropped in mid-2003. The name comes from t0, the mathematical symbol for a starting point in time. Due to high production costs, AC Propulsion ceased to produce the tzero. Only three were built, one of which is owned by the company itself, one by Gruber Power Services, a company that specializes in Tesla Roadster repair, and one privately. The drivetrain, however, was used in many other vehicles. Because the car recharges its batteries when the throttle is released — slowing sharply as energy is recaptured — it can be driven hard using only the accelerator pedal. Also, if the car detects a turn with more than half a g-force (5 m/s²), it eases the rear-wheel regenerative braking to prevent slides.|$|R

At least in Australia, the Brazilian-made model was rebadged CTX200 and fitted with a [...] "cheater sprocket" [...] to get an <b>overall</b> lower <b>gear</b> ratio more suitable {{to the needs of}} agricultural operators and is not roadworthy (however their owners can apply for conditional registration which allows for a limited usage of public roads).|$|R
40|$|Farmers' {{practices}} {{in the management of}} agricultural landscapes influence biodiversity with implications for livelihoods, ecosystem service provision, and biodiversity conservation. In this study, we examined how smallholding farmers in an agriculture-forest mosaic landscape in southwestern Ethiopia manage trees and forests with regard to a few selected ecosystem services and disservices that they highlighted as "beneficial" or "problematic. " Qualitative and quantitative data were collected from six villages, located both near and far from forest, using participatory field mapping and semistructured interviews, tree species inventory, focus group discussions, and observation. The study showed that farmers' management practices, i. e., the planting of trees on field boundaries amid their removal from inside arable fields, preservation of trees in semimanaged forest coffee, maintenance of patches of shade coffee fields in the agricultural landscape, and establishment of woodlots with exotic trees result in a restructuring of the forest-agriculture mosaic. In addition, the strategies farmers employed to mitigate crop damage by wild mammals such as baboons and bush pigs, e. g., migration and allocation of migrants on lands along forests, have contributed to a reduction in forest and tree cover in the agricultural landscape. Because farmers' management practices were <b>overall</b> <b>geared</b> toward mitigating the negative impact of disservices and to augment positive services, we conclude {{that it is important to}} operationalize ecosystem processes as both services and disservices in studies related to agricultural landscapes...|$|R
