5|$|On 5 September 2007, Chris Taylor, {{mounted on}} a {{pantomime}} horse, confronted police officers, who were <b>on</b> <b>foot,</b> and {{asked them if they}} needed any reinforcements against APEC protesters. When his offer was refused, Taylor took the horse for a stroll anyway, and was met by amused onlookers and media personnel. He was later asked by police officers to remove his clothing for examination, since it resembled a police uniform; but no charges of impersonating police were laid. The reference was to the horse flu outbreak, which forced police officers to face APEC protesters <b>on</b> <b>foot.</b> This stunt aired on the 12 September 2007 episode.|$|E

5|$|Descriptions of the {{tactical}} role of chariots in Ancient Greece and Rome are rare. The Iliad, possibly referring to Mycenaen practices used c.1250 BC, describes {{the use of}} chariots for transporting warriors to and from battle, rather than for actual fighting.

5|$|Due to {{the extent}} of oppression, and destitution, many Zoroastrians ventured to the {{hazardous}} journey to India. Those who could not afford the voyage aboard the ships, risked their lives by crossing the hostile desert on donkeys or even <b>on</b> <b>foot.</b> In India, they were recognized for Sedreh and Kushti and were sheltered by their Parsi brethren. There, they formed the second major Indian Zoroastrian community known as the Iranis.|$|E
5|$|During the night, Warwick {{ordered his}} cannons to {{continually}} bombard the estimated {{position of the}} Yorkists' encampment. The Yorkists, however, had sneaked in close, and the Lancastrian artillery overshot their enemies. The Yorkist cannon, meanwhile, kept quiet to avoid betraying their location. As the armies settled down to rest, Montagu approached his brother and advised him of the troops' low morale. He suggested that, as the highest-ranking commanders, the brothers should fight <b>on</b> <b>foot</b> throughout the battle instead of riding on horse. The soldiers believed that mounted commanders tended to abandon them when the situation deteriorated. By staying <b>on</b> <b>foot,</b> the Nevilles would show that {{they were prepared to}} fight to the death with the men, inspiring the troops to stand and fight harder. Warwick agreed and the horses were tethered to the rear, near Wrotham Wood.|$|E

While {{he and his}} half-Pawnee son, Hawk, are hunting, the company's camp is {{attacked}} by an Arikara war party. Guided by Glass, the survivors travel <b>on</b> <b>foot</b> to Fort Kiowa, as traveling downriver will make them vulnerable. After docking, the crew stashes the pelts near the shore.|$|E
5|$|In 1944 and 1945, as the German {{situation}} deteriorated, {{provision of}} food to POW camps became more sporadic and starvation became a problem.

40|$|Purpose. To {{determine}} which characteristics are most associated with free-living {{physical activity in}} community-dwelling ambulatory people after stroke. Method. Factors (age, gender, side of stroke, time since stroke, BMI, and spouse), sensory-motor impairments (weakness, contracture, spasticity, coordination, proprioception, and balance), and non-sensory-motor impairments (cognition, language, perception, mood, and confidence) were collected on 42 people with chronic stroke. Free-living physical activity was measured using an activity monitor and reported as time <b>on</b> <b>feet</b> and activity counts. Results. Univariate analysis showed that balance and mood were correlated with time <b>on</b> <b>feet</b> (r = 0. 42, 0. 43, P < 0. 01) and also with activity counts (r = 0. 52, 0. 54, P < 0. 01). Stepwise multiple regression showed that mood and balance accounted for 25 % {{of the variance in}} time <b>on</b> <b>feet</b> and 40 % of the variance in activity counts. Conclusions. Mood and balance are associated with free-living physical activity in ambulatory people after stroke residing in the community...|$|R
