50|$|So that’s how NURBS {{started at}} Boeing. Boehm’s B-spline {{refinement}} paper from CAD ’80 was of primary importance. It enabled {{the staff to}} understand non-uniform splines and to appreciate the geometrical nature of the definition so as to use B-splines in solving engineering problems. The first use of the geometrical nature of B-splines was in the curve/curve intersection. The Bezier subdivision process was utilized, and a second use was our curve offset algorithm, {{which was based on}} a polygon offset process that was eventually communicated to and used by SDRC and explained by Tiller and Hanson in their <b>offset</b> <b>paper</b> of 1984. The staff also developed an internal NURBS class taught to about 75 Boeing engineers. The class covered Bezier curves, Bezier to B-spline and surfaces. The first public presentation of our NURBS work was at a Seattle CASA/SME seminar in March of 1982. The staff had progressed quite far by then. They could take a rather simple NURBS surface definition of an aircraft and slice it with a plane surface to generate an interesting outline of some of the wing, body and engines. The staff were allowed great freedom in pursuing our ideas and Boeing correctly promoted NURBS, but the task of developing that technology into a useable form was too much for Boeing, which abandoned the TIGER task late in ’84.|$|E

The force in the contact zone between the offset cylinder (ORB) and the printing cylinder (printing substrate) is decisive for making the prints. With the different structure of ORB the different deformation zone is created, which results in forming the different sizes of the screen elements. The printing substrate has also influence, {{and because of that}} 5 characteristic papers (fine art paper gloss, fine art paper mat, <b>offset</b> <b>paper,</b> calendered <b>offset</b> <b>paper</b> and recycled paper) have been analyzed.

Dot gain curve and chromatic diagram were drawn after dot gain values and chromatic coordinates (x, y) were calculated. The results showed that smaller dot gain value and greater color gamut occur on the art paper due to its higher smoothness, gloss and lower absorbability when the printing conditions were the same, so the printing dot reproduction quality {{on the surface of}} art paper is better. However because <b>offset</b> <b>paper</b> has lower smoothness and gloss, higher absorbability compared with art paper, therefore the dot reproduction quality on <b>offset</b> <b>paper</b> is not as good as art paper...|$|E

Eleven <b>offset</b> <b>paper</b> samples were printed by IGT printability tester, then the density and L*a*b values of printed samples were measured. The relationship between paper properties and optical density or color gamut of paper printed was studied. The results show that main density increases with the increased ink quantity before the main density reaches saturation, the saturation density becomes greater with increased ink absorbency. When the smoothness is larger, lower ink quantity is needed for reaching saturation density, and larger color gamut is obtained.

40|$|Abstract—Print mottle {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{detrimental}} factors to general print quality, and to get high quality print, the most important thing is to resolve print mottle problem. The evaluation method for print mottle is proposed by means of discrete wavelet analysis, in which the index of print mottle is built on the base of the coefficient of variance of the wavelet-filtered digital image. Then, in our research, we have compared the three methods: the visual assessment method, the traditional method, and the wavelet-based method. They were applied on <b>offset</b> <b>papers</b> to check their performance. The linear correlation coefficient obtained between the visual ranking of the samples and the results with the traditional method is 0. 6148. While, the correlations using the wavelet-based method with visual evaluation is much better. The print mottle evaluation results with ten wavelet base functions are much better at the third and the fifth decomposition levels. In all, the analytical results compared with visual perception shows that the wavelet-based method proposed is effective and practical in measuring printing mottle.

40|$|The {{accelerated}} ageing {{is a test}} method used to simulate the long term effects of heat, oxygen, sunlight, moist etc. over the short period of time. The influences of external parameters are mimicked within the environmental chambers by strictly defined, standard test conditions. Printed products are, as any other material, very susceptible to ageing. This is even more emphasized if they are exposed outdoor. In order to prevent mechanical and chemical damages, products are usually varnished or laminated. In this paper we investigated the influence of {{accelerated ageing}} of <b>offset</b> <b>papers</b> coated with different types of coating, with regard to distinctness of image. Since the distinctness of image describes the deviation of {{the spread of the}} light reflected at the specular angle, it is a better indicator of a product surface quality than specular gloss. As a samples for this study we used papers printed with conventional and hybrid inks and coated with aqueous and UV coatings. Distinctness of image was assessed for primary process colours before and after ageing, where ageing is performed in accordance to ISO 12040 - 1997 and ISO 4892 - 2 : 2006. From the obtained results it was concluded that the accelerated ageing leads to the increase of surface roughness of coated papers and hence to the decrease of distinctness of image. The same trend is found for each of the primary process colours...|$|R
