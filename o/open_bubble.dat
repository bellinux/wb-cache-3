40|$|This paper reports first {{observations}} of transition in recirculation pattern from an open-bubble type axisymmetric vortex breakdown to partially <b>open</b> <b>bubble</b> mode through an intermediate, critical regime of conical sheet formation in an unconfined, co-axial isothermal swirling flow. This time-mean transition is studied for two distinct flow modes which are characterized {{based on the}} modified Rossby number (Ro(m)), i. e., Ro(m) 1. Flow modes with Ro(m) 1 fail to undergo such sequential transition. This distinct behavior is explained based on the physical significance associated with Ro(m) and the swirl momentum factor (xi). In essence, xi represents the ratio of angular momentum distributed across the flow structure to that distributed from central axis {{to the edge of}} the vortex core. It is observed that xi increases by similar to 100 % in the critical swirl number band where conical breakdown occurs as compared to its magnitude in the S-G regime where <b>open</b> <b>bubble</b> state is seen. This results from the fact that flow modes with Ro(m) 1 are dominated by pressure deficit due to entrainment effect. This blocks the radial inward penetration of imparted angular momentum thus preventing the lateral spread of these flow modes. As such these structures fail to undergo cone mode of vortex breakdown which is substantiated by a mere 30 %- 40 % rise in xi in the critical swirl number range. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC...|$|E
40|$|Summary An {{analytical}} model, {{based on}} the Fokker-Planck equation, is constructed of the dye visualization expected near a three-dimensional stagnation point in a swirling fluid flow. The model is found to predict dye traces that oscillate in density and position in the meridional plane in which swirling flows are typically visualized. Predictions {{based on the}} model for the steady vortex breakdown bubble are compared with computational fluid dynamics predictions and experimental observations. It is shown that even for a perfectly axisymmetric flow and breakdown bubble, the combined effect of dye diffusion and the inevitable small errors in the dye injection position lead to the false perception of an <b>open</b> <b>bubble</b> structure with folds near the lower stagnation point. The asymmetries in the predicted flow structures can be remarkably similar to those observed in flow observations and computational predictions with geometric asymmetries of the rig. Thus, when interpreting dye visualization patterns in steady flow, even if axisymmetric flow can be achieved, it is important {{to take into account the}} relative diffusivity of the dye and the accuracy of its injection...|$|E
40|$|Upwardpropagation of a {{premixed}} flame in averticaltubefilled {{with a very}} leanmixture is simulated numerically using {{a single}} irreversible Arrhenius reaction model with infinitely high activation energy. In the absence of heat losses and preferential diffusion effects, a curved flame with stationary shape and velocity close to those of an <b>open</b> <b>bubble</b> ascending in the same tube is found for values of the fuel mass fraction above a certain minimum that increases with the radius of the tube, while the numerical computations cease to converge to a stationary solution below this minimum mass fraction. The vortical flow of the gas behind the flame and in its transport region is described for tubes of different radii. It is argued that this flow may become unstable when the fuel mass fraction is decreased, and that this instability, together with the flame stretch due to the strong curvature of the flame tip in narrow tubes, {{may be responsible for}} the minimum fuel mass fraction. Radiation losses and a Lewis number of the fuel slightly above unity decrease the final combustion temperature at the flame tip and increase the minimum fuel mass fraction, while a Lewis number slightly below unity has the opposite effect...|$|E

40|$|During {{transcription}} initiation, {{competition between}} the initiation and elongation processes is thought {{to lead to the}} production of abortive transcripts (2 – 8 nucleotides of RNA) by the RNA polymerases. Our results show that A- 16 C and T- 14 G promoter mutations would lead to earlier promoter escape events relative to A- 15 C/G and wild type promoters as previously reported. This indicates that even for the A- 15 C/G promoter, interactions between the polymerase and bases at positions − 16 and − 14 are still important. ^ The only physiological regulator of transcription known in the T 7 phage is the phage protein T 7 lysozyme. Several models have been proposed about its mechanism of action. By running transcription assays on crosslinked promoter-polymerase complexes in the presence and absence of lysozyme, in addition to partial tryptic digests on promoter complexes stalled at different translocation positions, we have shown that lysozyme largely inhibits the initiation complex to elongation complex transition by causing the increased dissociation of the already unstable initiation complex. ^ In transcription, double stranded DNA is locally melted (forming a 2 ̆ 2 bubble 2 ̆ 2), containing RNA annealed to the template strand. Thus, there is an energy cost to maintain the <b>open</b> <b>bubble,</b> but an energy gain from formation of the hybrid. We have independently varied the DNA-DNA and RNA-DNA duplex stabilities by employing 5 -brominated pyrimidines, which stabilize duplexes by 4. 3 ° per substitution. Our results show that increasing hybrid stability stabilizes the elongation complex more than increasing DNA-DNA stability (favoring collapse of the bubble) destabilizes the complex. ^ The recent solving of the crystal structures of T 7 RNA polymerase initiation complexes involved in de novo RNA synthesis, has revealed a novel NTP binding site (the D-site), distinct from previously known P- and N-sites. The apparent inflexibility of the D- and P-sites in the initiation complex has inspired the hypothesis that initiation of transcription with GTP is by a lock-and-key mechanism. By using a 5 -propynyl-dC base in place of dC at the + 1 and + 2 sites, which would still allow for initiation with GTP we observe a decrease in initiation efficiency. This indicates that initiation of transcription in the T 7 RNA polymerase system is by a lock-and-key mechanism. ...|$|E
40|$|During {{the past}} two decades we have seen an {{explosion}} in our understanding of RNA dependent gene regulation. We now know that RNA is involved in every major event in the life of cells, from the Okazaki fragments involved in DNA replication to programmed cell death. The work described here explores two situations in which RNA plays an important role; how 6 S RNA helps ensure bacterial survival and the role of RNA in helping the intracellular parasite, Leishmania, escape the immune system by taking refuge inside mammalian macrophages. 6 S RNA is a non-coding RNA that regulates bacterial transcription by sequestering the RNA polymerase holoenzyme (Eσ 70) in low nutrient conditions. In high nutrient environments, Eσ 70 is released by the synthesis of a short product RNA (pRNA) using the 6 S RNA as a template. A range of 6 S RNA release-defective mutants were selected and characterized from a highly diverse in vitro pool. There is complex crosstalk between regions of the 6 S RNA large <b>open</b> <b>bubble</b> that interact with Eσ 70 in a cooperative manner so as to ensure efficient pRNA-dependent release. When a group of 6 S RNA mutants was over-expressed in E. coli, they significantly delayed growth and decreased cell survival indicating that 6 S RNA release rate {{plays a key role in}} regulating normal transcriptional dynamics and ultimately cell division. Interestingly, cells resumed normal growth rates approximately 6 hours after mutant 6 S RNA overexpression. This growth pattern might be correlated with the accumulation of a protein factor that binds strongly to the 6 S and mutant 6 S RNA, and data suggest that 6 S RNA also might bind to an RNase. RNA may contribute directly to parasite pathogenesis in trypanosomatids. Leishmania spp. uses exosomes to weaken mammalian host cells. Exosomes are known to be involved in intercellular communication. We examined the use of exosomes and their RNA from two species of Leishmania and how that RNA reprograms host cells. Exosome RNA cargo is delivered to host cell cytoplasm during in vitro studies. Sequencing of exosomal RNA indicated that the majority of cargo sequences were derived from non-coding RNA, while Northern blotting confirmed the specific and selective enrichment of tRNA-derived small RNAs in exosomes. We also identified a number of novel transcripts, which appeared to be specifically enriched in exosomes compared to total cell RNA. To our knowledge this is the first report that exosomes are used by a pathogen to invade new host cells. These findings also open up a new avenue of research on non-canonical, small RNA pathways in trypanosomatid parasites, which may elucidate pathogenesis factors and identify novel therapeutic targets...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe σ factor σ 70 of E. coli RNA {{polymerase}} acts {{not only}} in initiation, but also {{at an early stage}} of elongation to induce a transcription pause, and simultaneously to allow the phage λ gene Q transcription antiterminator to act. We identify the signal in DNA that induces early pausing to be a version of the σ 70 − 10 promoter consensus, and we show that σ 70 is both necessary for pausing and present in the paused transcription complex. Regions 2 and 3 of σ 70 suffice to induce pausing. Since pausing is induced by the nontemplate DNA strand of the <b>open</b> transcription <b>bubble,</b> we conclude that RNA polymerase containing σ 70 carries out base-specific recognition of the nontemplate strand as single stranded DNA.

In this paper we report findings on {{the interaction between the}} TATA box binding protein (TBP) and DNA, using a novel optical technology, that point to a potential plausible physical mechanism, {{and at the same time}} tie together a number of otherwise disparate observations. TBP plays a central and ubiquitous role in initiating eukaryotic transcription, binding to promoters with and without the canonical 5 &#x 2019; TATA(A/T) A(A/T) (G/A) 3 &#x 2019; motif 1. It also tends to bind to double-stranded DNA promiscuously, and though affinity is lower, the number of binding opportunities is greater. TBP-DNA complexes have been characterized structurally 2, 3 and thermodynamically 4, 5, the standard model representing the TBP double-helix complex as the biologically significant entity. Here we show, using a label-free detection method termed Spectral Reflectance Imaging Biosensor 6 (SRIB) that TBP binds to single stranded (ss), as well as double stranded (ds), oligonucleotides with the TATA motif, and binds the single-stranded form preferentially. Moreover, TBP binds preferentially to single stranded pyrimidine-rich sequences over purine-rich sequences, which is similar to the Single-Stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB) binding pattern. These observations suggest a new model for eukaryotic transcription in which TBP destabilizes the double helix, thereby initiating the <b>open</b> complex <b>bubble</b> necessary for transcription. Furthermore, the role of TBP as a multifunctional protein is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Topology {{may play}} an {{important}} role in cosmology in several different ways. First, Einstein’s field equations tell us about the local geometry of the universe but not about its topology. Therefore, the universe may be multiply connected. Inflation predicts that the fluctuations that made clusters and groups of galaxies arose from random quantum fluctuations in the early universe. These should be Gaussian random phase. This can be tested by quantitatively measuring the topology of large-scale structure in the universe using the genus statistic. If the original fluctuations were Gaussian random phase then the structure we see today should have a spongelike topology. A number of studies by our group and others have shown that this is indeed the case. Future tests using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey should be possible. Microwave background fluctuations should also exhibit a characteristic symmetric pattern of hot and cold spots. The COBE data are consistent with this pattern and the MAP and PLANCK satellites should provide a definitive test. If the original inflationary state was metastable then it should decay by making an infinite number of <b>open</b> inflationary <b>bubble</b> universes. This model makes a specific prediction for the power spectrum of fluctuations in the microwave background which can be checked by the MAP and PLANCK satellites.

40|$|Bubble columns are {{frequently}} studied without considering internals (<b>open</b> tube <b>bubble</b> columns). However, in most industrial applications, internal devices are often added to control heat transfer, to foster bubble break-up or to limit liquid phase back mixing. These elements can have significant {{effects on the}} multiphase flow inside the bubble column reactor and the prediction of these effects is still hardly possible without experimentation. In this paper, we study experimentally a counter-current gas-liquid bubble column in the open tube and annular gap configurations. In the annular gap bubble column, two vertical internal tubes are considered. The column has an inner diameter of 0. 24 m, and the global and local hydrodynamic properties are studied using gas holdup measurements and a double-fiber optical probe. The gas holdup measurements are compared with the literature and used to investigate the flow regime transition. A double-fiber optical probe is used to acquire midpoint data and radial profiles of the local properties to study the flow properties and to further investigate the flow regime transition. The counter-current mode is found to increase the holdup, decrease the bubble velocity and cause regime transition at lower superficial gas velocity. The holdup curves in the annular gap and open tube configurations are similar in shape and values, suggesting {{that the presence of}} internals has a limited influence on the global hydrodynamic. In addition, it is found that the presence of the internals stabilizes the homogeneous regime in terms of transition gas velocity and holdup. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

Gas-liquid flow may be characterised {{in terms of the}} gas void fraction, α. This is an important variable in two-phase flow, used in predicting the occurrence of flow regimes, and the associated pressure drop, and mass and heat transfer. The gas void fraction transitions in a two-phase flow system from uniform bubble flow (homogeneous) to churn-turbulent bubble flow (heterogeneous) in an <b>open</b> tube <b>bubble</b> column (OTBC) and an annular gap bubble column (AGBC) have been investigated using a vertical column with an internal diameter of 0. 102 m, containing a range of concentric inner tubes which formed an annular gap; the inner tubes had diameter ratios from 0. 25 - 0. 69. Gas (air) superficial velocities in the range 0. 014 - 0. 200 m/s were studied. Tap water and aqueous solutions of ethanol and isopropanol, with concentrations in the range 8 - 300 ppm by mass, were used as the working liquids. Experimental results are presented to show that there are very significant differences in the mean gas void fractions measured in the OTBC and the AGBC, when operated at the same gas superficial velocity using a porous sparger. The mean gas void fraction decreases with increasing ratio of the inner to outer diameter of the annular gap column and the transition to heterogeneous flow occurs at lower gas superficial velocities and lower void fractions. Two reasons are proposed and validated by experimental investigations: (i) the presence of the inner tube causes large bubbles to form near the sparger, which destabilize the homogeneous bubbly flow and reduce the mean void fraction; this was confirmed by deliberately injecting large bubbles into a homogeneous dispersion of smaller bubbles. Moreover, (ii) the shape of the void fraction profiles changes with gap geometry, which affects the distribution parameter in the drift flux model. Radial profiles of the local void fraction were obtained using a two- and four-point conductivity probe, and were cross-sectionally averaged to give mean values that were within 12...|$|R
40|$|An {{understanding}} of the bubble properties, size distributions and shapes is of fundamental importance for comprehending flow dynamics and mass transfer phenomena in bubble column reactors. A large {{number of studies have}} focused on <b>open</b> tube <b>bubble</b> columns, and the knowledge concerning bubble columns with internals is still limited. This paper contributes to the existing discussion experimentally investigating a counter-current annular bubble column with 0. 24. m inner diameter and two internal pipes. The experimental investigation consists in holdup measurements and image analysis. The former is used for identifying the flow regime transition and studying the bubble column hydrodynamics, whereas the latter is used for investigating the bubble shapes and size distributions. The definition of the transition point is important because the size distribution and bubble shapes depend on the operating conditions and a change of the bubble properties is expected near the transition. The image analysis is applied at different superficial gas and liquid velocities, corresponding to a gas holdup between 2. 9 % and 9. 6 %. It is difficult to measure bubble size distribution accurately in large-diameter bubble columns owing to the overlapping of bubbles, even at low void fractions, and-in an annular gap bubble column-the fact that cap bubbles have also been reported in the homogeneous flow regime. The use of a bubble image analysis method to study the bubbly flows in a large-diameter annular gap bubble column is described. In the proposed method, each bubble is approximated and reconstructed using an ellipse. The proposed approach is used to quantify the bubble size distribution, as well as to study the bubble shape and orientation as function of the superficial gas and liquid velocities. The experimental data obtained are used to develop a correlation between non-dimensional parameters and aspect ratios. Also, the experimental data are compared with non-dimensional diagrams from the literature, revealing good agreement. Finally, the image analysis is used for supporting the flow regime transition prediction in the stability analysis method: the virtual mass formulation is obtained by using the aspect ratio correlation provided by the image analysis. The stability analysis-supported by the image analysis-was able to predict the transition point in very good agreement with experimental data and performed better than literature correlations. © 2015 Elsevier Inc...|$|R
40|$|Faddeev and Jackiw's {{method for}} {{constrained}} systems {{is used to}} derive a gauge invariant formulation of cosmological perturbations in the one bubble inflationary universe. For scalar perturbations in a flat universe, reduction of the action to the one with a single physical degree of freedom has been derived in the literature. A straightforward generalization {{of it to the}} case of an open universe is possible but it is not adequate for quantizing perturbations in the one bubble universe, {{because of the lack of}} Cauchy surfaces inside the bubble. Therefore we perform the reduction of the action outside the lightcone emanating from the center of the bubble or nucleation event, where the natural time constant hypersurfaces are no longer homogeneous and isotropic and as a result the conventional classification of perturbations in terms of scalar and tensor modes is not possible. Nevertheless, after reduction of the action we find three decoupled actions for three independent degrees of freedom, one of which corresponds to the scalar mode and the other two to the tensor modes. Implications for the one <b>bubble</b> <b>open</b> inflationary models are briefly discussed. As an application of our formalism, the spectrum of long wavelength gravity waves is simply obtained in terms of the real part of the reflection amplitude for a one dimensional scattering problem, where the potential barrier is given in terms of the bubble profile.

40|$|We present new HST NICMOS {{observations}} of NGC 4945, a starburst galaxy hosting a highly obscured active nucleus {{that is one}} of the brightest extragalactic sources at 100 keV. The HST data are complemented with ground based [FeII] line and mid [...] IR observations. A 100 pc-scale starburst ring is detected in Pa alpha, while H_ 2 traces the walls of a super <b>bubble</b> <b>opened</b> by supernova-driven winds. The conically shaped cavity is particularly prominent in Pa alpha equivalent width and in the Pa alpha/H_ 2 ratio. Continuum images are heavily affected by dust extinction and the nucleus of the galaxy is located in a highly reddened region with an elongated, disk-like morphology. No manifestation of the active nucleus is found, neither a strong point source nor dilution in CO stellar features, which are expected tracers of AGN activity. Even if no AGN traces are detected in the near-IR, with the currently available data it is still not possible to establish whether the bolometric luminosity of the object is powered by the AGN or by the starburst: we demonstrate that the two scenarios constitute equally viable alternatives. However, the absence of any signature other than in the hard X-rays implies that, in both scenarios, the AGN is non-standard: if it dominates, it must be obscured in all directions, conversely, if the starburst dominates, the AGN must lack UV photons with respect to X-rays. An important conclusion is that powerful AGNs can be hidden even at mid-infrared wavelengths and, therefore, the nature of luminous dusty galaxies cannot be always characterized by long-wavelength data alone but must be complemented with sensitive hard X-ray observations.

40|$|Swifts are aerodynamically {{sophisticated}} {{birds with}} a small arm and large hand wing that provides them with exquisite control over their glide performance. However, their hand wings have a seemingly unsophisticated surface roughness that is poised to disturb flow. This roughness of about 2 % chord length is formed by the valleys and ridges of overlapping primary feathers with thick protruding rachides, which make the wing stiffer. An earlier flow study of laminar–turbulent boundary layer transition over prepared swift wings suggests that swifts can attain laminar flow at low angle-of-attack. In contrast, aerodynamic design theory suggests that airfoils must be extremely smooth to attain such laminar flow. In hummingbirds, which have similarly rough wings, flow measurements on a 3 D printed model suggests that the flow separates {{at the leading edge}} and becomes turbulent well above the rachis bumps in a detached shear layer. The aerodynamic function of wing roughness in small birds is, therefore, not fully understood. Here we perform particle image velocimetry and force measurements to compare smooth versus rough 3 D-printed models of the swift hand wing. The high-resolution boundary layer measurements show that the flow over rough wings is indeed laminar at low angle-of-attack and Reynolds number, but becomes turbulent at higher values. In contrast, the boundary layer over the smooth wing forms <b>open</b> laminar separation <b>bubbles</b> that extend beyond the trailing edge. The boundary layer dynamics of the smooth surface varies nonlinear as a function of angle-of-attack and Reynolds number, whereas the rough surface boasts more consistent turbulent boundary layer dynamics. Comparison of the corresponding drag values, lift values, and glide ratios suggests, however, that glide performance is equivalent. The increased structural performance, boundary layer robustness, and equivalent aerodynamic performance of rough wings might have provided small (proto) birds with an evolutionary window to high glide performance...|$|R
50|$|In {{commercial}} aquaculture {{there are}} two main areas of farming: the onshore facility and the offshore sea cages. In the onshore facility {{there are a number of}} storage tanks that are key to the early development of Cod and many other cold water fish. These livestock storage include: the incubators (where eggs are fertilized and allowed to hatch), the larval tanks (slightly larger tanks where the larvae is grown), the circular tanks (last stage before fish leave the onshore facility, where metamorphosis occurs) and finally storage tanks where the fish can be temporarily stored as they are transported from truck, to boat, to sea site.2 Before the fish are taken to sea cage sites, some companies insert microchips into the fish to monitor population and patterns in the fish to improve the raising for future generations.8 The microchips are removed once fish are ready for market. After being transported to the ocean via private company or government ships, the fish are gently poured into a sea cage.1 There are many different types of sea cages depending on the location and style of aquaculture. Some common sea containers include: aqua pod (completely sealed <b>bubble),</b> <b>open</b> water (with the hope that the fish will naturally return), sea cages (simple netting tied to the ocean floor), and raceways (often in rivers or ponds).8 Some facilities (non-coastal regions) contain land based re circulation where all fish are in an indoor water circulated facility. The most common of these however is the sea cages, due to its inexpensive and ability to hold lots of fish. Finally with any of these sites a vacuum system must be present at the bottom of the water facility to absorb fish feces and to circulate the water.8 This prevents any chance of disease and improves water quality.|$|R
