As a result, the effects {{of oil and gas}} policies in different scenarios for different sectors of Iran's economy together with the counter-effects of energy consumption and oil revenue are examined. Three scenarios, which show the worst, base and ideal cases, are considered to find future trends of major variables such as seasonal gas consumption in power plants, seasonal injected gas in oil reservoirs, economic growth in the industrial sector, oil consumption in the transportation sector, industrial gas consumption and exported gas.

2500|$|In the 1970s Libya {{initiated}} a socialist style nationalization program {{under which the}} government either nationalized oil companies or became a participant in their concessions, production and transportation facilities. As part of this program, NOC signed production-sharing agreements with Occidental Petroleum, Sincat (Italy), and formed a joint drilling company with Saipem (an Eni subsidiary). This was accompanied by nationalization of ConocoPhillips's Umm Farud field in 1970, British Petroleum's Sarir field in 1971 and Amoco's Sahabir field in 1976. After commencement of the 1973 Arab-Israeli War, Saudi Arabia, Libya, and other Arab states proclaimed an embargo on oil exports to countries who supported Israel, primarily the United States. Additionally, the NOC had encountered legal actions by BP over claims of ownership. Although the 1973 oil crisis increased global demand, BP's legal position made some countries wary of importing from Libya. NOC compensated for this weakness by arranging barter deals with France and Argentina. On March 18, 1974, the Arab oil ministers ended the US-embargo, with Libya being the sole exception. During 1974, agreements reached with Exxon, Mobil, Elf Aquitaine and Agip provided production-sharing on an 85-15 basis onshore, 81-19 offshore. Eventually, all the foreign companies (excluding BP) agreed to partial nationalization, providing Libya with a substantial <b>oil</b> <b>surplus.</b> However, declining world oil prices resulted in NOC selling back its production shares. Other concessions that were nationalized that year included those belonging to BP, Amoseas (Beida field), Hunt, Arco, Esso and Shell's 17 percent share in the Oasis Oil Company.

40|$|In a basic, {{ram-type}} EDM system (figure 1 - 1 O), the {{ram head}} is driven {{up and down}} with extreme accuracy by a servodriven system. The servo system is controlled by a microprocessor connected to the power supply. The power supply is solid-state and is also microprocessor controlled. One lead from the power supply is connected to the workpiece, which is immersed in a tank of dielectric oil. The dielectric tank is connected to a dielectric pump, an oil reservoir, and a filter system. The pump provides pressure for flushing the work area and moving the oil while the filter system removes and traps debris in the oil. The <b>oil</b> reservoir stores <b>surplus</b> <b>oil</b> and provides a container for draining the oil between operations. The other lead from the power supply is connected to the electrode.

When the EDM machine is turned on, the servo microprocessor, sensing that the gap is too wide for cutting to take place, signals the servo mechanism to lower the ram head. When the first spark jumps the gap, downward travel of the ram head stops. With the gap setting held constant, the process gradually erodes the surface.

30|$|The {{results in}} Table  1 {{show that in}} the {{economic}} factor group, all of the examined variables satisfy the first criterion. But considering the second criterion, DJI, the most representative barometer of the American economy and worldwide mature stock market, is the most appropriate. In the fundamental market factor group, non-OECD oil demand, worldwide oil demand, OECD oil stocks and OPEC <b>surplus</b> <b>oil</b> production capacity have economic significance on the international Brent crude oil prices. OECD oil stocks is the most appropriate factor, because in some sense, the difference between oil supply and oil demand has reflected the change in oil stocks and these two types, which represent the fundamental variables, cannot be used simultaneously. Besides, compared to OPEC <b>surplus</b> <b>oil</b> production capacity, OECD oil stocks are more negatively related to the Brent oil prices. In the oil exploration technology group, we select the US rotary rig count, highly positively related to Brent oil prices. In the financial market factor group, US dollar index (USD), as an aggregative indicator of the weighted average value of six major currencies against US dollars, reflects the exchange rate of US dollars in the international foreign exchange market and measures the exchange rate of the US dollars against a basket of currencies. USD has a strong negative correlation coefficient on Brent oil prices. In oil exploration technology, we select the US rotary oil rig count as a proxy. In the speculation factor group, the net positions of Large traders, Managed money and Small traders have economic significance for Brent oil prices. TOI, however, has a more positive relationship on Brent oil prices. Important geopolitical and historical events (e.g., the Second Gulf War from August 1990 to April 1991 and the Iraq War in 2002) are also accounted for by using 0 – 1 dummy variables.|$|R
