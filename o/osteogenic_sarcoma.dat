40|$|We have {{characterized}} {{a strain}} of double transgenic mice with simian virus 40 large tumor antigen and prokaryotic lacZ {{under the control of}} the myelin basic protein promoter that develops spindle-cell <b>sarcomas</b> and <b>osteogenic</b> <b>sarcomas</b> at 5 - 7 months of age. Although poorly differentiated, the spindle-cell sarcomas were characterized as malignant Schwannomas based on their neural association, the presence of basal lamina, and expression of Schwann cell-specific genes. The <b>osteogenic</b> <b>sarcomas</b> were often multiple and appeared predominantly in the facial bones, less frequently in the ribs and vertebral column, and only rarely in the appendicular skeleton. Benign osteoblastic lesions were often observed adjacent to these sarcomas. Both the osteoblastic cells in the facial skeleton and Schwann cells are regarded as neural crest derivatives. The biological properties and anatomical location of these tumors suggest that they may share a common origin from the neural crest or its derivatives. R. P. Bolande [Hum. Pathol. (1974) 5, 409 - 429] introduced the term neurocristopathy as a unifying concept to describe such lesions arising from the neural crest or its derivatives. Cell lines established from both bone and Schwann cell tumors arising in these transgenic mice express simian virus 40 large tumor antigen mRNA as well as functional large tumor antigen. Such cell lines are potentially valuable in the search for markers that identify mammalian neural crest derivatives...|$|R

She {{had a history of}} untreated intraductal papilloma. Treatment was completed with a modified mastectomy after excluding extramammary metastases.

40|$|This {{study is}} based on 29 {{patients}} undergoing resection for pulmonary metastases from 1960 to 1981 in our clinics. Factors concerning their prognosis are discussed in this study. 1) Prognosis following surgery {{is associated with the}} origin of the primary disease, the sizes and numbers of pulmonary metastases, and the disease-free period. 2) Pulmonary metastases arising from original tumors with slow growth rate, such as thyroid cancer, breast cancer, and some of <b>osteogenic</b> <b>sarcomas,</b> are favorable candidates for surgical treatment. 3) Operative methods of choice are not essential in anticipating better results.

40|$|Both FBJ murine {{osteosarcoma}} virus (FBJ-MSV) and FBR-MSV induce {{transformation in}} tissue culture and <b>osteogenic</b> <b>sarcomas</b> in mice. In tissue culture, however, FBR-MSV induces larger foci with a shorter latency than those induced by FBJ-MSV. Transformation {{is dependent on}} expression of the fos oncogene in FBJ-MSV and of a gag-fos fusion protein in FBR-MSV. We have determined that the gag sequences can be deleted from FBR-MSV without affecting the high transforming activity of this virus in comparison to FBJ-MSV. The resultant virus, designated FBJ/R-MSV, has a protein coding region that is {{half the size of}} that of FBR-MSV and about one-third smaller than that of FBJ-MSV. Thus, FBJ/R-MSV will provide a useful tool for studying the transforming activity of the fos oncogene...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} to evaluate the usefulness of high-resolution grayscale and color Doppler ultra-sound to distinguish benign from malignant soft-tissue masses {{on the basis of}} ultrasonographic patterns. Methods: We enrolled 398 female and 420 male patients aged 1 – 104 years (mean, 49. 8 years). All presented with a palpable nodule or mass located superficially in the body. Each lesion was examined by grayscale and color Doppler ultrasonography to assess its echogenicity, margin, shape, composition, acoustic transmission, size and other patterns. Spectral Doppler was applied in lesions with positive color flow signals. The nature of all masses was confirmed by aspiration cytology, biopsy, surgical pathology or long-term clinical follow-up. Results: There were a total of 693 benign and 125 malignant masses. Five malignant and 14 benign histologies (including 6 types with inflammation-related, hematoma or pseudoaneurysm) occurred that had more than 10 subjects with each histology. Eight benign histopathologies included cysts, neoplasms, vascular and miscellaneous. Five malignant histologies included metastases, <b>osteogenic</b> <b>sarcomas,</b> lymphomas, malignant fibrous histiocytomas and liposarcomas. There were significant differences (p 0. 05) between the benign and malignant soft-tissue tumors in terms of echogenicity, composition and color Doppler features. Conclusion: Ultrasonography with color Doppler imaging is a good modality for characterizing most soft-tissue masses, and tumor size > 5 cm and having infiltrated margin highly suggests malignancy...|$|R
40|$|Summary Introduction: Spinal {{tumors are}} {{rare in the}} {{pediatric}} population, presenting many specific peculiarities when compared to adults. We have performed a broad narrative review to describe the most common spinal tumors in children, discussing their main characteristics and management options. Method: The authors have performed an extensive review of the peer-reviewed literature addressing the aforementioned objectives. Results: Multimodality radiological studies (plain films, 3 D computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging) are necessary for proper evaluation and differential diagnosis of spinal tumors in children. In selected cases nuclear medicine imaging is used to improve {{the chances of a}} more accurate diagnosis. As a general rule, a fine needle biopsy is recommended after radiological evaluation to confirm the tumor's histology. Primary bone tumors can be divided into benign bone tumors, mostly represented by vertebral hemangiomas, osteoid osteomas, osteoblastomas, aneurismal bone cysts, and eosinophilic granulomas, and malign or aggressive tumors, such as Ewing's or <b>osteogenic</b> <b>sarcomas.</b> Secondary bone tumors (spinal metastases) comprise different tumor histologies, and treatment is mainly based on tumor's radiosensitivity. The characteristics and treatment options of the main spinal tumors are discussed in details. Conclusion: Spinal tumors in children are rare lesions that demand a thorough understanding of their main characteristics for their proper management. Understanding the nuances of spinal tumors in children is of paramount importance for improving outcomes and chances of cure...|$|R
