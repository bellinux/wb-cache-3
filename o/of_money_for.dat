5000|$|Explicitly, IOLTA {{applies only}} to funds that are [...] "nominal in amount or held {{for a short period}} of time" [...] so larger amounts <b>of</b> <b>money</b> held <b>for</b> single clients are exempt from the IOLTA program.

5|$|In 1982, an {{animated}} television series called Lupin VIII was planned as a French-Japanese co-production, featuring {{the descendants of}} Lupin, Goemon, Jigen, and Zenigata, but was never completed. Created by DiC Animation, with Rintaro directing, and character designs by Shingo Araki; two scripts were written, and one episode was fully animated with a music and sound effects track, but the voice-overs were never recorded. It {{has been suggested that}} the project was stopped due to Leblanc's estate wanting a large amount <b>of</b> <b>money</b> <b>for</b> use of the Lupin name. The single episode was later included in the 2012 Lupin III Master File box set.|$|E
5|$|No. 1 Royal Crescent is a {{historic}} house museum, owned and maintained by the Bath Preservation Trust through its membership to illustrate how wealthy owners of the late 18th century might have furnished and occupied such a house. It was purchased in 1967 by Major Bernard Cayzer, {{a member of the}} family that made its fortune through the Clan shipping line. He donated it to the Trust with an amount <b>of</b> <b>money</b> <b>for</b> its restoration and furnishing. The restoration was led by Philip Jebb. The Bath Preservation Trust was working during 2012–13 to re-unite Number One with its original servants' wing at Number 1A Royal Crescent, which has been in use as a separate dwelling for many years. No. 1 serves as the Trust's headquarters. Number 15 and 16 are still used as a hotel.|$|E
5|$|Prompted by the 2002 Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, the CRNC officially {{left the}} control of the RNC by reconstituting as a 527 group, {{allowing}} it to operate independently and raise unlimited amount <b>of</b> <b>money</b> <b>for</b> issue-advocacy work. As a 527 group, the organization is prohibited from coordinating directly with a particular campaign and its recent focus has turned towards developing volunteers and other support activities rather than outright campaigning. The shift has allowed the CRNC to vastly expand its fundraising efforts. During its first two years, the CRNC raised $17.3 million, most going to pay fundraising costs and other administrative costs, while leaving more than $2 million to expand the field representative program and to improve pay for the full-time positions.|$|E

5|$|Sir George {{created a}} deer park that ranged far north of Radyr. Tenant farmers there were evicted, {{and the loss}} of rental income contributed to the decline in the family's fortunes. He had 24 children, eight of whom were illegitimate. Many were daughters, and Sir George needed large sums <b>of</b> <b>money</b> <b>for</b> their dowries. On his death Sir George's lands passed to his eldest son William, who also became a MP and {{invested}} in the Pentyrch ironworks. This was an astute move as feudalism was giving way to early industrialisation. William's descendants inherited a diminishing fortune. Captain George Mathew, the last of the family to live in Radyr, married Elizabeth Poyntz, and the couple left Radyr to live on her estates at Thurles in County Tipperary, Ireland in 1625.|$|E
5|$|The club {{achieved}} mid-table league {{positions for}} two seasons, {{but they were}} relegated in 1934 as a penalty for breaking amateur regulations. The club had paid their players a small sum <b>of</b> <b>money</b> <b>for</b> each game. Although against the rules, this was common at the time; Malmö FF were the only club to show it in their accounting records. In addition to relegation to Division2, the club suffered bans for the entire {{board of directors and}} twenty-six players. The version of events told by Malmö FF and local press suggests that local rival IFK Malmö reported the violation to the Swedish Football Association. This belief has contributed to the longstanding competitive tensions between the clubs.|$|E
5|$|The {{greatest}} {{offense to}} the Chinese was the supposed kidnapping of children by the Portuguese {{so they could}} eat them. In reality, Simão had earned the Portuguese a bad reputation for buying young Chinese slaves, presumably {{some of whom were}} kidnapped after Simão offered local Chinese huge sums <b>of</b> <b>money</b> <b>for</b> child slaves. In fact, some boys and girls from wealthy Chinese families were later found by Portuguese authorities at Diu in western India. However, there were no official reports of Simão's abuses, even though he stayed until September 1520; yet rumors of his behavior (which became associated with all Portuguese) no doubt reached as far as the court of Beijing, which would soon condemn the Portuguese for this and other reasons.|$|E
