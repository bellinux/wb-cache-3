40|$|A {{key process}} populating the oxygen {{exosphere}} at Mars is the dissociative recombination of ionospheric O 2 +, which produces fast oxygen atoms, {{some of which}} have speeds exceeding the escape speed and thus contribute to atmospheric loss. Theoretical studies of this escape process have been carried out and predictions made of the loss rate; however, directly measuring the <b>escaping</b> neutral <b>oxygen</b> is difficult but essential. This paper describes how energetic pickup ion measurements to be made near Mars by the SEP (Solar Energetic Particle) instrument on board the MAVEN (Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN) spacecraft can be used to constrain models of photochemical <b>oxygen</b> <b>escape.</b> In certain solar wind conditions, neutral oxygen atoms in the distant Martian exosphere that are ionized and picked up by the solar wind can reach energies high enough to be detected near Mars by SEP.

40|$|Charged {{particle}} sputtering is reexamined as {{a mechanism}} for escape of sulfur and oxygen from Io. Corotating ions and energetic ions are considered, using the best available determinations of ion fluxes and sputtering yields. It is unclear whether molecular SO 2 is the dominant escaping neutral from Io or whether atomic O and S are dominant, but the Voyager detection of SO 2 (+) in the cold torus implies the presence of molecular SO 2 there. Thin atmosphere models encounter serious difficulty in achieving adequate sulfur and <b>oxygen</b> <b>escape</b> rates, {{but they are not}} yet ruled out. Ionization and dissociation of SO 2 in a sputter corona can dominate direct escape. In thick atmosphere models the neutral escape rates can be much higher, but the <b>oxygen</b> <b>escape</b> rate tends to be too high relative to the sulfur escape rate unless diffusive separation in the atmosphere is limited, perhaps by rapid mixing...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{evolution}} {{of life is}} affected by variations of atmospheric oxygen level and geomagnetic field intensity. <b>Oxygen</b> can <b>escape</b> into interplanetary space as ions after gaining momentum from solar wind, but Earth's strong dipole field reduces the momentum transfer efficiency and the ion outflow rate, except for the time of geomagnetic polarity reversals when the field is significantly weakened in strength and becomes Mars-like in morphology. The newest databases available for the Phanerozoic era illustrate that the reversal rate increased and the atmospheric oxygen level decreased when the marine diversity showed a gradual pattern of mass extinctions lasting millions of years. We propose that accumulated <b>oxygen</b> <b>escape</b> during an interval of increased reversal rate could {{have led to the}} catastrophic drop of oxygen level, which is known to be a cause of mass extinction. We simulated the <b>oxygen</b> ion <b>escape</b> rate for the Triassic–Jurassic event, using a modified Martian ion escape model with an input of quiet solar wind inferred from Sun-like stars. The results show that geomagnetic reversal could enhance the <b>oxygen</b> <b>escape</b> rate by 3 – 4 orders only if the magnetic field was extremely weak, even without consideration of space weather effects. This suggests that our hypothesis could be a possible explanation of a correlation between geomagnetic reversals and mass extinction. Therefore, if this causal relation indeed exists, it should be a “many-to-one” scenario rather the previously considered “one-to-one”, and planetary magnetic field should be much more important than previously thought for planetary habitability...|$|R

40|$|Photochemical escape is an {{important}} process for <b>oxygen</b> <b>escape</b> from present Mars. In this work, a 1 -D Monte-Carlo Model is developed to calculate escape rates of energetic oxygen atoms produced from O 2 + dissociative recombination reactions (DR) under 1, 3, 10, and 20 times present solar XUV fluxes. We found that although the overall DR rates increase with solar XUV flux almost linearly, <b>oxygen</b> <b>escape</b> rate increases from 1 to 10 times present solar XUV conditions but decreases when increasing solar XUV flux further. Analysis shows that atomic species in the upper thermosphere of early Mars increases more rapidly than O 2 + when increasing XUV fluxes. While the latter {{is the source of}} energetic O atoms, the former increases the collision probability and thus decreases the escape probability of energetic O. Our results suggest that photochemical escape be a less important escape mechanism than previously thought for the loss of water and/or CO 2 from early Mars...|$|R

40|$|For a {{transcendental}} {{entire function}} f of finite {{order in the}} Eremenko-Lyubich class B, we give conditions under which the Lebesgue measure of the <b>escaping</b> <b>set</b> I(f) of f is zero.

We will construct an entire function in the Eremenko-Lyubich class to show that the condition given by Aspenberg and Bergweiler is essentially sharp. Furthermore, we adapt our idea of proof to the case of infinite order entire functions.
