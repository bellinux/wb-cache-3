50|$|Larger 5XB {{systems were}} built in the 1960s with more markers. To save money the markers were {{separated}} into two kinds: simple dial tone markers (DTM) just to connect the line to the OR, and completing markers (CM), many times more complex and expensive, to complete the call to or from a trunk. CM has, among other features, the ability to translate the first 3 digits of a phone number (or 6 when using a separate foreign area translator) to identify the correct <b>outgoing</b> <b>trunks</b> and handling.|$|R
2500|$|Idle <b>outgoing</b> <b>trunks</b> {{were picked}} by the {{traditional}} [...] "sleeve test" [...] method, as lines were, except that hunting was the usual practice for trunks rather than a special service feature. The selector moved upward to the proper trunk group, and then through twenty terminals, checking for one with an un-grounded sleeve lead, then selecting and grounding it. If all the trunks were busy, the selector sent back an All Circuits Busy tone (reorder tone). [...] There was no provision for alternate routing as in earlier manual systems and later more sophisticated mechanical ones.|$|R
50|$|Other test {{equipment}} includes a line insulation tester and an automatic trunk tester, for items whose numerosity and simplicity lent themselves to automatic testing. An automated AMA translator tester checked for miswiring that could bill one line to another. A nonautomated <b>outgoing</b> <b>trunk</b> test panel allows voltmeter checks on trunks to distant offices, freeing the MTF from this tedious job. Each <b>outgoing</b> <b>trunk</b> {{is represented by}} two jacks: one for test access for the voltmeter {{and one for the}} make-busy operation. MTF was able to override Make Busy when necessary.|$|E
50|$|Ferrods were {{mounted in}} pairs, usually with {{different}} control windings, so one could supervise a switchward {{side of a}} trunk and the other the distant office. Components inside the trunk pack, including diodes, determined for example, whether it performed reverse battery signaling as an incoming trunk, or detected reverse battery from a distant trunk; i.e. was an <b>outgoing</b> <b>trunk.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{switchboard}} {{is usually}} {{designed to accommodate}} the operator, who sits facing it. It has a high back panel, which consists of rows of female jacks, each jack designated and wired as a local extension of the switchboard (which serves an individual subscriber) or as an incoming or <b>outgoing</b> <b>trunk</b> line. The jack is also associated with a lamp.|$|E
5000|$|To {{a greater}} degree than in {{previous}} designs, test facilities are centralized into a master test frame. This complex piece of equipment is wired into all common control equipment, and can, for example, automatically exercise the abilities of digit receivers to operate at different speeds, voltages, and other parameters. MTF can select particular <b>outgoing</b> <b>trunks,</b> including testing {{the ability of the}} markers to select different lines to particular trunks. This test facility became more valuable as Centrex, direct distance dialing, and other innovations brought more complications to the tasks of translation and trunk selection. For lines, MTF can test translations and conduct voltmeter tests to detect impedance imbalances and other electrical conditions that can impair service.|$|R
50|$|A tandem {{version of}} the 1XB omitted the {{incoming}} section and Line Link Frames and replaced the junctor circuits with incoming trunks, leaving only the ability to connect those incoming <b>trunks</b> to <b>outgoing</b> <b>trunks.</b> In many cases the resulting Crossbar tandem switch (XBT) replaced a Panel Sender Tandem, because its multi-frequency senders were able to receive seven digits and some were modified to accept ten. Sometimes it replaced an Office Select Tandem as well, since its Revertive Pulse senders were able to accept Office Brush and Group parameters. In big cities, some XBT were strictly incoming Class 4 telephone switches, some outgoing, a few both-way, and some only for tandem traffic within the metropolitan area. Specialization was less marked in less dense areas. XBT served local telephone companies until the late 20th Century when they were replaced by 4ESS switches or other digital switches.|$|R
50|$|Thanks to {{this more}} complex <b>trunk</b> circuit, <b>outgoing</b> <b>trunks</b> are {{selected}} by a quicker and more versatile method than the sleeve test previously used. Each trunk circuit provides a ground on an FT lead to indicate idleness. The FT leads for trunks {{in a particular}} group are cross-connected to a FTC (frame test common) lead for its trunk link frame, {{to indicate that the}} TLF has one or more idle trunks in that group. The route relay in the completing marker connects sensor relays to all the trunk link frames, allowing the marker to choose a TLF that has an idle trunk and then connect to that trunk through the trunk link connector (TLC) to choose one of those idle trunks. This two step method, along with the mixing of incoming and outgoing traffic, distributed traffic more evenly, thus alleviating the link congestion problems that often arose with earlier methods that restricted a trunk group to one or two outgoing switch frames.|$|R
5000|$|In an idle circuit, {{the central}} office {{supplies}} -48V (nominally) on the ring conductor {{with respect to the}} tip side. A ground start PBX initiates an <b>outgoing</b> <b>trunk</b> seizure on an idle circuit by connecting of the ring lead to ground (maximum local resistance of 550 ohms). The central office senses this condition and grounds the tip lead. When the PBX senses this, it goes off-hook, then removes the ground on ring. The central office sends dial tone {{and the rest of the}} call proceeds normally.|$|E
50|$|This {{method is}} less {{efficient}} for coin phones, which need special signalling. In urban areas, they were served by older exchanges that had separate junctors for coin phones. Where the 5XB {{was the only}} exchange, a number of work-around methods were devised. Regular and coin phones shared the more complex and expensive coin trunks, or else separate routes were established, or coin trunks connected via tandem switches including the 5XB itself acting as its own tandem. In this last case, the call had to use two connections through the switching fabric: one to connect the line to the coin supervision trunk and another to connect that trunk to the <b>outgoing</b> <b>trunk.</b>|$|E
50|$|As in {{previous}} designs, supervision of incoming calls is handled by relay sets known as incoming trunk circuits. Unlike {{in previous}} designs, {{this work is}} also done in the trunk circuit for outgoing calls, {{so there are no}} junctor circuits. Since different outgoing trunks are connected to different places and are used for different calls, their relay sets can be specialized for a particular kind of signalling or call metering (see automatic message accounting) or other peculiarity. Thus a TSPS trunk can give complete control to an operator, while an E and M signaling trunk can do the kind of signaling required of a private long-distance line, while a local <b>outgoing</b> <b>trunk</b> can be simpler.|$|E
40|$|Consider a node in a {{communication}} network with n outgoing links grouped into k trunks of n 1 [...] nA links respectively. n lt [...] . +nA = n. Calls arrive in a Poisson stream of rate X. The state of the node is specified {{by the number of}} idle links in each trunk. A policy is a rule by which a call, finding the node in some state, is assigned to one of the available links in one of the available <b>outgoing</b> <b>trunks.</b> The links are assumed to have 1 exponential holding times with mean-. which are indepen-P dent, and are independent of the arrival process. Further. a call assigned to trunk a. 1 &x a is immediately lost with probability (l-e,) [...] -this feature models the nature of the links and the congestion downstream of the node along that route. A call is said to be blocked if all the outgoing links are busy when it arrives. It is known that the biocking probability is independent of the assignment policy. We give an explicit closed form formula for the blocking probability: lost with the probability (l-En). The various loss probabilities (1 -e,) model the cumulative effects of the topology of the network and the congestion of other links and nodes downstream of the node under consideration. This is the crucial new feature in the proposed model. Calls arrive at the node in a Poisson strem of rate X. Each arriving call is assigned to one of the <b>outgoing</b> <b>trunks</b> according to a policy U.

5000|$|With a clean FCG test, {{the call}} {{completion}} software told the [...] "A" [...] relay {{in the trunk}} circuit to operate, connecting its transmission and test hardware to the switching fabric and thus to the line. Then, for an <b>outgoing</b> call, the <b>trunk's</b> scan point would scan {{for the presence of}} an off hook line. If the short was not detected, the software would command the printing of a [...] "Supervsion Failure" [...] (SUPF) and try again with a different junctor. A similar supervision check was performed when an incoming call was answered. Any of these tests could alert for the presence of a bad crosspoint.|$|R
50|$|Reed relays {{are smaller}} and cheaper, thus {{better suited to}} data storage. They were used in {{conjunction}} with wire spring relays, for example to store digits for sending to other crossbar switching offices. In a multi-frequency sender (the part of a switch which sends routing information about <b>outgoing</b> calls over <b>trunk</b> lines), for example, wire spring relays direct the dialed digits one at a time from reed relay packs to frequency generators, under sequential control of logic implemented with wire spring relays. At the other end, similar relays steered the incoming digits from the tone decoder to a reed relay memory. In such uses two-out-of-five codes and similar schemes checked for errors at both ends.|$|R
50|$|Early {{crossbar}} exchanges {{were divided}} into an originating side and a terminating side, while the later and prominent Canadian and US SP1 switch and 5XB switch were not. When a user picked up the telephone handset, the resulting line loop operating the user's line relay caused the exchange to connect the user's telephone to an originating sender, which returned the user a dial tone. The sender then recorded the dialed digits and passed them to the originating marker, which selected an <b>outgoing</b> <b>trunk</b> and operated the various crossbar switch stages to connect the calling user to it. The originating marker then passed the trunk call completion requirements (type of pulsing, resistance of the trunk, etc.) and the called party's details to the sender and released. The sender then relayed this information to a terminating sender (which could be on either the same or a different exchange). This sender then used a terminating marker to connect the calling user, via the selected incoming trunk, to the called user, and caused the controlling relay set to pass intermittent ring voltage of about 90 V AC at 20 Hz to ring the called user's phone bell, and return ringing tone to the caller.|$|E
