5|$|In week six, the Bears and the winless New York Giants met <b>on</b> <b>Thursday</b> <b>night.</b> The Bears and Giants {{had split}} {{the last four}} {{meetings}} since 2004, with Chicago winning the first two in 2004 and 2006, but losing in 2007 and 2010; they had also won the last four games between the teams at Soldier Field. Among the keys to victory for Chicago was to force turnovers, as the Giants {{led the league in}} giveaways with 20, while the Bears were ranked second in forced turnovers with 14. Additionally, the Giants had the worst third-down offense, and averaged only 3.3 yards per carry. Chicago also had to attack Eli Manning, who had 12 interceptions entering the game, and was sacked 15 times, the fourth-most in the league; Manning also held a 658 passer rating, one of the lowest in the NFL. However, the Bears' pass defense allowed 278.8 yards per game, which is about 65 yards greater than the previous season's average. The Giants' offense was also returning from a strong game the previous week against the Philadelphia Eagles after scoring three touchdowns and 383 yards.|$|E
5|$|Early {{estimates}} put Nightmare on Elm Streets {{opening day}} gross at approximately $15 million, with a projected opening weekend of $35 million. Included in the $15 million is the $1.6 million the film made from midnight showings <b>on</b> <b>Thursday</b> <b>night</b> from 1,000 theaters. As a result, Nightmare on Elm Street broke {{the record for}} midnight openings for a horror film, which was previously held by the Friday the 13th remake in 2009 that grossed $1 million. Ultimately, the film finished its opening with $32,902,299, placing first for the weekend ahead of How to Train Your Dragon (6th week in release), Date Night, (4th week in release) The Back-up Plan (2nd week in release), and Furry Vengeance; the latter film was also in its opening weekend. A Nightmare on Elm Street dropped 72 percent in its second weekend, earning $9,119,389; dropping to second place for the weekend behind Iron Man 2. The film dropped an additional 54 percent in its third week, bringing in $1.5 million, though it remained in the Top 10 rankings for the weekend, placing sixth overall. The film remained in the top ten for the fourth weekend in a row, grossing approximately $2,285,000 and finishing eighth for the week. In its fifth weekend, the 2010 remake {{fell out of the}} box office top ten, finishing eleventh with an estimated $910,000.|$|E
5|$|Needing a win {{to clinch}} the 5th {{seed in the}} playoffs, Manning had {{one of his best}} career {{performances}} in Jacksonville <b>on</b> <b>Thursday</b> <b>Night</b> Football. He completed his first 17 passes of the game. In addition to completing his last 6 against Detroit, Manning's 23 straight completions fell one shy of the NFL record (Donovan McNabb– 24). The Colts trailed 14–0 {{in the first half and}} 24–14 to start the fourth quarter. Manning led his seventh fourth quarter win of the season and the Colts put the game away with a defensive touchdown for a 31–24 victory to clinch a seventh consecutive playoff berth. Manning completed 29-of-34 passes (85.7%) for 364 yards and three touchdowns. It increased his NFL record streak of seasons with 25 touchdown passes to 11. Manning and the Colts tied an NFL record by winning three games in a season in which they trailed by at least 14 points. For his efforts Manning won AFC Offensive Player of the Week for the third time in 2008. It was the 19th time he has won the award, passing Dan Marino for the most all-time since the award was originated in 1984. He also was selected as the FedEx Air Player of the Week. With the playoff seed secured, Manning only played the opening drive in a shutout against the division-leading Titans in Week 17. He completed all seven of his passes for 95 yards and a touchdown, extending his NFL record to nine seasons with 4,000 yards passing, and also extended the record to a sixth straight season he led the Colts to at least 12 wins. At the end of the 2008 season, Manning was named NFL MVP for the 3rd time, tying Brett Favre for the most MVP awards in NFL history.|$|E
