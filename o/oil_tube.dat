40|$|Abstract: The {{influence}} of Sn on mechanical properties and CO 2 corrosion resistance of <b>oil</b> <b>tube</b> was investigated by TEM, EBSD and electrochemical measurement. The {{results show that}} the addition of 0. 05 %Sn can improve the corrosion-resistance of tested steel, but decrease the elongation and impact energy. Sn affected the activity of tested steels, moved corrosion potential to negative potential and decreased corrosion current density. Consequently, the polarization resistance of electrode reaction increased and corrosion reaction was slowed down due to the effect of Sn. In addition, Sn increased the proportion of low boundary, which improved the corrosion resistance of steel, and accordingly decreased the proportion of large angle grain boundary, which contaminated the elongation and impact energy of steel. However, Sn had little influence on the microstructure, precipitates of steel. And thus the strength of steel did not change obviously...|$|E

30|$|In 2004, Lake and {{co-workers}} analyzed by GC–MS the binding media of nine of Pollock’s poured paintings dating from 1943 to 1950; they {{reported on the}} use of artists’ <b>oil</b> <b>tubes,</b> <b>oil</b> commercial paints, oleoresin enamels and oil-modified alkyd house paints [31].

Extensive use of alkyd house paints was proved in paintings by 1949 [31, 35, 36] from when it becomes the medium favoured by Pollock for the dripping technique. In 1950 Pollock described his painting method as: “New needs need new techniques. …Most of the paint I use is a liquid, flowing kind of paint. The brushes I use are used more as sticks rather than rushes …. the brush doesn’t touch the surface of the canvas, it’s just above” [37].|$|R
30|$|A {{comparison}} {{was made}} with a late 19 th century W&N <b>oil</b> paint <b>tube</b> labelled “Lemon Yellow” (dated {{according to the data}} on the label; more details in the “Experimental” section). The pigment in the tube is composed of barium chromate and the additive magnesium carbonate was also found, Fig.  6. Magnesium carbonate was only detected by μ-FTIR, not by XRD, which means it is most probably in its amorphous form. As seen in Fig.  6, the infrared (between 1000 and 750  cm− 1) and diffraction pattern of the pigment in the “Lemon Yellow” <b>oil</b> paint <b>tube</b> presents a very good match with the pigment reconstruction for W&N’s Lemon Yellow (LY 1 a, barium chromate). The presence of magnesium carbonate in the <b>oil</b> paint <b>tube</b> is very interesting. This material was not listed in any of the W&N production records for manufacturing Lemon Yellow pigments, nor was it found in any of their 19 th century production records for lead chromate pigments but it was detected in 19 th century W&N lead chromate <b>oil</b> paint <b>tubes</b> [25]. However magnesium carbonate does appear in some of W&N’s oil paint formulations under the term “spar” [25], as revealed by a search in the on-line W&N Archive Database under the book code GR (entitled ‘Oil Grinding at New Factory, various colours at different dates’) [31]. It is possible that magnesium carbonate may be a good marker for W&N’s oil paints. Investigation into the oil paint formulations of other contemporary colourmen will be necessary to confirm this hypothesis.|$|R

The strengthening mechanism of the steel was analyzed by SEM and TEM, and the CO 2 corrosion behavior of the steel was simulated by high-temperature and high-pressure autoclave. The result show: the size of original austenite grain, packet and block are about 10 - 15 µm, 2 µm and 200 nm, respectively, so {{the strength of the}} steel matched toughness well. The precipitate of (Nb,Ti) (C,N) whose size is about 60 nm can restrain coarsening of the original austenite grain through pitting austenite grain boundary; The precipitate of (Nb,Ti) C and nanometer sized precipitate of NbC can be an effective barrier for dislocation motion, so that has great contributions to improve the strength of the steel. The average and pitting corrosion rate increased first and then dropped down with the increasing of temperature.

40|$|Abstract: At present, {{the pump}} setting depth of machine wells in Tahe Oilfield is universally too deep as the {{reservoir}} is buried deep, viscosity of heavy oil is high, and the producing energy weakened. This {{will increase the}} input of sucker rod, <b>oil</b> <b>tube</b> material and lead to enlarge suspension point load of pumping unit mule head and energy consumption. According to the problems, {{on the basis of}} the regularity of distribution of wellbore pressure field, viscosity field, temperature field, this paper puts forward a new matching lifting technology: moving down the point of blending and picking up the pump setting depth. Moving down the point of blending can reduce the producing energy loss and enforce the crude oil’s fluidity in the wellbore,and picking up the pump depth can reduce the cost and energy consumption, Field test shows that after the new type matching lifting technology implement, test wells are normal in operation.

40|$|International audienceOil-swollen {{hexagonal}} mesophases {{resulting from}} the surfactant mediated self-assembly of a quaternarymixture of water, surfactant, co-surfactant, and oil, are versatile templates to synthesize anisotropicnanomaterials. Poly(diphenylbutadyine) (PDPB) polymer nanofibrous network structures were producedin the oil tubes of the mesophases by photo-induced radical polymerization using a chemical initiator orby gamma irradiation. The diameter of the nanofibers can be varied from 5 to 25 nm in a controlledfashion, and is directly determined by {{the diameter of the}} <b>oil</b> <b>tube</b> of the doped mesophases, proving thusa direct templating effect of the mesophase. The nanoIR technique allows chemical characterization andidentification of the polymer nanostructures simultaneously with morphological characterization.

The conductivity of the PDPB nanostructures obtained by gammairradiation was estimated to be 0. 1 S/cm, which is higher than the conductivity of PDPB nanostructurespreviously reported in the literature. The soft template approach allows size tunable synthesis of anisotropicpolymer structures with morphological homogeneity at the nanoscale with high conductivity, thus it appearsto be an attractive opportunity for electronic device applications...|$|E

Parameters considered in the theoretical method include operating load during drilling and completion and the temperature field, pressure field and the end effect of pressure during gas production. The finite element method for multistring analysis is developed to simulate random contact between casings. The relevant finite element analysis scheme is also presented according to the actual procedures of drilling, completion and gas production. Finally, field cases are presented and analyzed using the proposed methods. These are four offshore wells in the South China Sea. The calculated wellhead growths during gas production are compared with measured values. The {{results show that the}} wellhead subsides during drilling and completion and grows up during gas production. The theoretical and finite element solutions for wellhead growth are in good agreement with measured values and the deviations of calculation are within 10 %. The maximum von Mises stress on the uncemented intermediate casing occurs during the running of the <b>oil</b> <b>tube.</b> The maximum von Mises stress on the uncemented production casing, calculated with the theoretical method occurs at removing the blow-out-preventer (BOP) while that calculated with the finite element method occurs at gas production.
