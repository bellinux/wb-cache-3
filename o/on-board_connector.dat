40|$|The TOTEM Roman Pot Motherboard (RPMB) is the {{interface}} between the hybrids with silicon detectors and front end chips in the Roman Pots, and the outside world. The RPMB is glued in the vacuum flange which separates the vacuum chamber containing the detector hybrids, and forms the feed through between vacuum and atmosphere. The hybrids have a flexible part with <b>on-board</b> <b>connector</b> for connection to the motherboard. The motherboard is equipped with connectors to the detector hybrids from one side and front panel with connectors to the patch panel form the other side. The RPMB needs to provide power and control, clock and trigger information to the 10 hybrids. It acquires tracking and triggers data from the hybrids, performs data conversion from electrical to optical format and transfers the data {{to the next level}} of the system [1]. It also collects information like temperature, pressure and radiation dose inside the pot. This paper presents the TOTEM RPMB in detail...|$|E

40|$|The pad {{pitch of}} modern radio {{frequency}} integrated circuits {{is in the}} order of few tens of micrometers. Connecting a large number of high-speed I/Os to the outside world with good signal fidelity at low cost is an extremely challenging task. To cope with this requirement, we need reflection-free transmission lines from an on-chip pad to <b>on-board</b> SMA <b>connectors.</b> Such a transmission line is very hard to design due to the difference in on-chip and on-board feature size and the requirement for extremely large bandwidth. In this paper, we propose the use of narrow tracks close to chip and wide tracks away from the chip. This narrow-to-wide transition in width results in impedance discontinuity. A step change in substrate thickness is utilized to cancel the effect of the width discontinuity, thus achieving a reflection-free microstrip. To verify the concept, several microstrips were designed on multilayer FR 4 PCB without any additional manufacturing steps. The TDR measurements reveal that the impedance variation is less than 3 for a 50 microstrip and S 11 better than – 9 dB for the frequency range 1 GHz to 6 GHz when the width changes from 165 m to 940 m, and substrate thickness changes from 100 m to 500 m...|$|R
40|$|Syftet med detta examensarbete var att skapa ett serverprogram i en enkortsdator som arbetar i realtid för att kunna hjälpa människor att köra mer ekonomiskt och miljövänligt i deras vardag. Detta var ett av målen ställda av produktbeställaren Ziggy Creative Colony. Ett mer långsiktigt mål från beställaren är att datorn skall installeras i en bil och kopplas till bilens {{on-board}} diagnostic-II (OBD-II) -uttag. Datorn ska sedan, via OBD-II, kunna samla information som till exempel hastighet, acceleration och bränsleflöde från bilens {{engine control}} unit (ECU). Serverprogrammet ska bearbeta denna information som sedan kommuniceras och visualiseras till bilföraren via en native mobilapplikation. Serverprogrammet byggdes i en linuxbaserad dator: Raspberry Pi och döptes av oss till Car-Pi. Car-Pi designades enligt arkitekturmönstret Model-View-Controller (MVC) som gör det lätt att underhålla, vidare-utveckla och implementera programmet av produktägaren, Ziggy Creative Colony, i framtiden. I och med denna rapport levererar vi programmet Car-Pi tillsammans med ett arkitektdokument och en prototyp till en Android mobilapplikation för att kunna testa Car-Pi och se hur det fungerar i verkligheten. The purpose of this bachelor degree project {{was to create a}} server program in a single-board computer that will function in real time in order to help people drive more economically and eco-friendly. This was one of the goals set by the project owner, Ziggy Creative Colony. Another more long-term goal from Ziggy Creative Colony is that the computer should be installed in a car and connected to the car’s <b>on-board</b> diagnostics (OBD-II) <b>connector.</b> The computer should, via the OBD-II connection, be able to collect information such as speed, acceler-ation and fuel flow from the car’s {{engine control unit}} (ECU). The server program will then process this information that will later be communi-cated and visualized to the car driver via an Android mobile applica-tion. The server program was built in a linux-based computer: Raspberry Pi and named Car-Pi. Car-Pi was designed according to the well-known architectural pattern Model-View-Controller (MVC), which makes it easy to maintain, develop and implement the program by the project owner Ziggy Creative Colony in the future. With this report we are delivering the program Car-Pi together with an architectural document and an Android mobile application-prototype to show how Car-Pi functions in real life...|$|R
