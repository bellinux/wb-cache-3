60|$|If the {{grinding}} faces of an upper {{and of a}} lower molar of the same side are applied together, it will be seen that the apposed ridges are nowhere parallel, but that they frequently cross; and that thus, {{in the act of}} mastication, a hard surface in the one is constantly applied to a soft surface in the other, and vice versa. They thus constitute a <b>grinding</b> <b>apparatus</b> of great efficiency, and one which is repaired as fast as it wears, owing to the long-continued growth of the teeth.|$|R

This system utilizes {{the principle of the}} cone crusher for coarse crushing, and after the pulverized coal is dried in drying apparatus, it will let the pulverized coal enters into the fine grinding device from fixed screening device. The pulverized coal pulverized by fine <b>grinding</b> <b>apparatus,</b> classification by the classification device, and enters into the infrared light detecting device from transmission apparatus to detect its composition. This device’s transmission is based on control of PLC to achieve. At first, this paper describe the operating principle of PLC, then select the hardware and software components of transfer part, and simulate the control part at last. PLC’s Operating Principle The PLC’s operating process is essentially the process of an executing program. According to time-sharing operating principle, the CPU performs one operation in each cycle when PLC working. Due to the quickly speed of CPU’s arithmetic processing, the external results seems to be competed appear at the same time, when we see it from a macro point of view. This kind of time sharing operation can be known as scan of program by CPU. The PLC’s operating process have three phases: input processing, program execution and output processin...|$|R
40|$|The {{possibility}} of homogenisation of various materials with a <b>grinding</b> <b>apparatus</b> {{for the project}} "Environmental Specimen Bank" {{should be pointed out}} under consideration of the following conditions: - grinding of all materials which should be stored as homogenised subsamples in the Environmental Specimen Bankhomogenisation of the sample - the whole grinding process (homogenisation) should be carried out at temperatures T < - 140 °C so that the sample does nothave to be thawed after the sampling - clean up of the sample without contamination during the whole preparation process; no moisture and no foreign air shouldcome in contact with the sample; no shaft bearings (lubricants) should be anywhere in the grinding system. - samples of ≤ 5 kg should be prepared continuously in the grinding machine Samples exceeding 1 kg can be handled only in a discontinuous fashiön in commonly available milling systems in analyticallaboratories. During the further processing steps moisture from the air cannot always be excluded, which can lead to errors in the aliquotation of subsamples. Homogenisation of the samples processed in this manner is more difficult. To find out if larger milling systens are available, we contacted different industrial branches that use big grinding systems under approximately the Same conditions. We looked for manufacturers of milling machines and for milling industry and also forinstitutions, private as well as public which are dealing with similar problems. It turned out that the best partners may be found in the manufacturers of milling machines...|$|R

50|$|There {{are many}} styles of jig {{available}} commercially. Fundamentally, all jigs {{are similar in}} that they allow the user to clamp the blade or tool in some way. The jig then has some means of referencing the clamped blade to the <b>grinding</b> or honing <b>apparatus</b> so that the bevel angle is maintained. One of the more common approaches {{is to have the}} jig ride on a roller. These types of jigs are usually used with a sharpening stone or plate, such as a waterstone, oilstone or diamond abrasive surface. Other types of jigs are used to present the blade to the wheel of a grinder. There are generally two types of hand sharpening jigs, push jigs and side to side jigs. Push jigs run perpendicular to the length of the stone and a side to side jig runs with the blade parallel to the length of the stone.|$|R
40|$|First-stage phyllosoma larvae of {{the rock}} lobster Jasus edwardsii {{attached}} to and fed on larvae of the Tasmanian trumpeter fish, Latris lineata, when the two were placed together in an aerated, through-circulating, sea-water aquarium. Scanning electron micrographs of the mouthparts showed adaptations suitable for scraping and cutting soft substrata. Phyllosomas removed from the fish while feeding had pigment particles from the fish integument throughout their digestive tracts. The behaviour of these phyllosomas, swimming in a Petri dish, was recorded with a microscope and video system. The presence of the pigment particles {{made it possible to}} see the lumen of the gut diverticulae and parts of them undergoing regular contractions. Transmission electron micrographs of the gut showed that the parts of the gut that contracted in the video records have well developed muscle bands associated with them. The ultrastructure of the digestive tract is relatively uniform throughout and is lined by cells resembling the undifferentiated (E) cells of other scyllarid and palinurid larvae. Extensive folding of the wall, together with a brush border on the digestive cells, results in a large surface area for absorption. There is no <b>grinding</b> or filtering <b>apparatus</b> in the digestive tract. The behaviour of the phyllosoma, structure of the mouthparts, and ultrastructure of the digestive tract, suggest that the first-stage phyllosoma of J. edwardsii is adapted for removing soft tissue from gelatinous organisms and pumping it around the digestive tract...|$|R
40|$|This project {{involves}} the use of an innovative new invention � Particle Stabilized Emulsions (PSEs) of Carbon Dioxide-in-Water and Water-in-Carbon Dioxide for Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) and Permanent Sequestration of Carbon Dioxide. The EOR emulsion would be injected into a semi-depleted oil reservoir such as Dover 33 in Otsego County, Michigan. It is expected that the emulsion would dislocate the stranded heavy crude oil from the rock granule surfaces, reduce its viscosity, and increase its mobility. The advancing emulsion front should provide viscosity control which drives the reduced-viscosity oil toward the production wells. The make-up of the emulsion would be subsequently changed so it interacts with the surrounding rock minerals in order to enhance mineralization, thereby providing permanent sequestration of the injected CO{sub 2 }. In Phase 1 of the project, the following tasks were accomplished: 1. Perform laboratory scale (mL/min) refinements on existing procedures for producing liquid carbon dioxide-in-water (C/W) and water-in-liquid carbon dioxide (W/C) emulsion stabilized by hydrophilic and hydrophobic fine particles, respectively, using a Kenics-type static mixer. 2. Design and cost evaluate scaled up (gal/min) C/W and W/C emulsification systems to be deployed in Phase 2 at the Otsego County semi-depleted oil field. 3. Design the modifications necessary to the present CO{sub 2 } flooding system at Otsego County for emulsion injection. 4. Design monitoring and verification systems to be deployed in Phase 2 for measuring potential leakage of CO{sub 2 } after emulsion injection. 5. Design production protocol to assess enhanced oil recovery with emulsion injection compared to present recovery with neat CO{sub 2 } flooding. 6. Obtain Federal and State permits for emulsion injection. Initial research focused on creating particle stabilized emulsions with the smallest possible globule size so that the emulsion can penetrate even low-permeability crude oilcontaining formations or saline aquifers. The term �globule� refers to the water or liquid carbon dioxide droplets sheathed with ultrafine particles dispersed in the continuous external medium, liquid CO{sub 2 } or H{sub 2 }O, respectively. The key to obtaining very small globules is the shear force acting on the two intermixing fluids, and the use of ultrafine stabilizing particles or nanoparticles. We found that using Kenics-type static mixers with a shear rate in the range of 2700 to 9800 s{sup - 1 } and nanoparticles between 100 - 300 nm produced globule sizes in the 10 to 20 &# 956;m range. Particle stabilized emulsions with that kind of globule size should easily penetrate oil-bearing formations or saline aquifers where the pore and throat size can be on the order of 50 &# 956;m or larger. Subsequent research focused on creating particle stabilized emulsions that are deemed particularly suitable for Permanent Sequestration of Carbon Dioxide. Based on a survey of the literature an emulsion consisting of 70 % by volume of water, 30 % by volume of liquid or supercritical carbon dioxide, and 2 % by weight of finely pulverized limestone (CaCO{sub 3 }) was selected as the most promising agent for permanent sequestration of CO{sub 2 }. In order to assure penetration of the emulsion into tight formations of sandstone or other silicate rocks and carbonate or dolomite rock, it is necessary to use an emulsion consisting of the smallest possible globule size. In previous reports we described a high shear static mixer that can create such small globules. In addition to the high shear mixer, it is also necessary that the emulsion stabilizing particles be in the submicron size, preferably in the range of 0. 1 to 0. 2 &# 956;m (100 to 200 nm) size. We found a commercial source of such pulverized limestone particles, in addition we purchased under this DOE Project a particle <b>grinding</b> <b>apparatus</b> that can provide particles in the desired size range. Additional work focused on attempts to generate particle stabilized emulsions with a flow through, static mixer based apparatus under a variety of conditions that are suitable for permanent sequestration of carbon dioxide. A variety of mixtures of water, CO{sub 2 } and particles may also provide suitable emulsions capable of PS. In addition, it is necessary to test the robustness of PSE formation as composition changes to be certain that emulsions of appropriate size and stability form under conditions that might vary during actual large scale EOR and sequestration operations. The goal was {{to lay the groundwork for}} an apparatus and formulation that would produce homogenous microemulsions of CO{sub 2 }-in-water capable of readily mixing with the waters of deep saline aquifers and allow a safer and more permanent sequestration of carbon dioxide. In addition, as a beneficial use, we hoped to produce homogenous microemulsions of water-in-CO{sub 2 } capable of readily mixing with pure liquid or supercritical CO{sub 2 } for use in Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR). However, true homogeneous microemulsions have proven very difficult to produce and efforts have not yielded either a formulation or a mixing strategy that gives emulsions that do not settle out or that can be diluted with the continuous phase in varying proportions. Other mixtures of water, CO{sub 2 } and particles, that are not technically homogeneous microemulsions, may also provide suitable emulsions capable of PS and EOR. For example, a homogeneous emulsion that is not a microemulsion might also provide all of the necessary characteristics desired. These characteristics would include easy formation, stability over time, appropriate size and the potential for mineralization under conditions that would be encountered under actual large scale sequestration operations. This report also describes work with surrogate systems in order to test conditions...|$|R
