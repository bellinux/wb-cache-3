5|$|Narcosis {{is known}} to be {{additive}} to even minimal alcohol intoxication, and also to the effects of other drugs such as cannabis (which is more likely than alcohol to have effects that last into a day <b>of</b> <b>abstinence</b> from use). Other sedative and analgesic drugs, such as opiate narcotics and benzodiazepines, add to narcosis.|$|E
5|$|Alcohol {{detoxification}} or 'detox' for alcoholics is {{an abrupt}} stop of alcohol drinking {{coupled with the}} substitution of drugs, such as benzodiazepines, that have similar effects to prevent alcohol withdrawal. Individuals who are only at risk of mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms can be detoxified as outpatients. Individuals at risk of a severe withdrawal syndrome {{as well as those}} who have significant or acute comorbid conditions are generally treated as inpatients. Detoxification does not actually treat alcoholism, and it is necessary to follow up detoxification with an appropriate treatment program for alcohol dependence or abuse to reduce the risk of relapse. Some symptoms of alcohol withdrawal such as depressed mood and anxiety typically take weeks or months to abate while other symptoms persist longer due to persisting neuroadaptations. Alcoholism has serious adverse effects on brain function; on average it takes one year <b>of</b> <b>abstinence</b> to recover from the cognitive deficits incurred by chronic alcohol abuse.|$|E
5|$|Severe acute {{withdrawal}} {{symptoms such as}} delirium tremens and seizures rarely occur after 1-week post cessation of alcohol. The acute withdrawal phase {{can be defined as}} lasting between one and three weeks. In the period of 3–6 weeks following cessation increased anxiety, depression, as well as sleep disturbance, is common; fatigue and tension can persist for up to 5 weeks as part of the post-acute withdrawal syndrome; about a quarter of alcoholics experience anxiety and depression for up to 2 years. These post-acute {{withdrawal symptoms}} have also been demonstrated in animal models of alcohol dependence and withdrawal. A kindling effect also occurs in alcoholics whereby each subsequent withdrawal syndrome is more severe than the previous withdrawal episode; this is due to neuroadaptations which occur as a result of periods <b>of</b> <b>abstinence</b> followed by re-exposure to alcohol. Individuals who have had multiple withdrawal episodes are more likely to develop seizures and experience more severe anxiety during withdrawal from alcohol than alcohol-dependent individuals without a history of past alcohol withdrawal episodes. The kindling effect leads to persistent functional changes in brain neural circuits as well as to gene expression. Kindling also results in the intensification of psychological symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. There are decision tools and questionnaires which help guide physicians in evaluating alcohol withdrawal. For example, the CIWA-Ar objectifies alcohol withdrawal symptoms in order to guide therapy decisions which allows for an efficient interview {{while at the same time}} retaining clinical usefulness, validity, and reliability, ensuring proper care for withdrawal patients, who can be in danger of death.|$|E

25|$|Historically, {{there has}} been a swing from the sexually liberal end of the Industrial Revolution to the chaste values of the early Victorian period. This was then {{followed}} by a new puritanism from the late Victorian era to the mid-1900s. This important transformation often colors discussion of sexual behavior in the later 20th century. World War I began a return to sexual freedom and indulgence, but more often than not, the appearance of conforming to the earlier moral values <b>of</b> <b>abstinence</b> before marriage was retained. With the conclusion of World War II, the societal importance <b>of</b> <b>abstinence</b> declined. The advent of the first oral contraceptive pill and widely available antibiotics suppressed many consequences of wide and free sexual behavior, while social morals were also changing. By the 1970s, abandonment of premarital chastity was no longer taboo in the majority of western societies, and the reverse became true. Some cultural groups continued to place a value on the moral purity of an abstainer, but abstinence was caught up in a wider reevaluation of moral values.|$|E

40|$|IntroductionA 2012 {{systematic}} review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials on emergency department 2 ̆ 013 initiated tobacco control (ETC) showed only short-term efficacy. The {{aim of this}} study was to update data through May 2015. MethodsAfter registering the study protocol on the international prospective register of {{systematic review}}s (PROSPERO) in May 2015, we searched 7 databases and the gray literature. Our outcome of interest was the point prevalence <b>of</b> tobacco-use <b>abstinence</b> at 1 -month, 3 -month, 6 -month, or 12 -month follow-up. We calculated the relative risk (RR) <b>of</b> tobacco-use <b>abstinence</b> after ETC at each follow-up time separately for each study and then pooled Mantel 2 ̆ 013 Haenszel RRs by follow-up time. These results were pooled with results of the 7 studies included in the previous review. We calculated the effect of ETC on the combined point prevalence <b>of</b> tobacco-use <b>abstinence</b> across all follow-up times by using generalized linear mixed models. ResultsWe retrieved 4 additional studies, one published as an abstract, comprising 1, 392 participants overall.

40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} {{and safety of}} chlorpromazine with Verapamil in patients with Acute opioid Abstinence Syndrome. Methodology: Single blind comparative clinical trial was conducted at Department of Pharmacology, BMSI, JPMC, Karachi, over the period of one year. Forty opiate-dependent subjects were chosen at random who were in search <b>of</b> opioid <b>abstinence</b> treatment. All patients were grouped into two groups, group-I received chlorpromazine 150 mg/day and group-II received Verapamil 120 mg/day in divided doses. Every patient completed the management plan while admitted {{in the hospital for}} 10 days. Results: The chlorpromazine showed decreased efficacy and safety, whereas verapamil showed clinically pertinent decline in the subjective symptoms <b>of</b> acute opioid <b>abstinence</b> syndrome. Conclusion: The study showed Verapamil is superior to chlorpromazine in the treatment <b>of</b> opioid <b>abstinence</b> syndrome indicated by better reduction of withdrawal symptom scores, excessive opioid urinary excretion and lees side effects. The superiority of verapamil over chlorpromazine in controlling opioid abstinence syndrome may indicate that calcium is involved in the initiation and development <b>of</b> opioid <b>abstinence</b> syndrome...|$|R
25|$|Even {{though there}} does not exist strong {{evidence}} that any particular abstinence program is effective at delaying sex or reducing sexual behavior, one should not conclude that all abstinence programs are ineffective.

In sum, studies <b>of</b> <b>abstinence</b> programs have not produced sufficient evidence to justify their widespread dissemination.|$|E
25|$|Within the {{recently}} legitimized Christian {{community of the}} 4th century, a division could be more distinctly seen between the laity and an increasingly celibate male leadership. These men presented themselves as removed from the traditional Roman motivations {{of public and private}} life marked by pride, ambition and kinship solidarity, and differing from the married pagan leadership. Unlike later strictures on priestly celibacy, celibacy in Late Antique Christianity sometimes took the form <b>of</b> <b>abstinence</b> from sexual relations after marriage, and it came to be the expected norm for urban clergy. Celibate and detached, the upper clergy became an elite equal in prestige to urban notables, the potentes or dynatoi (Brown (1987) p.270).|$|E
25|$|Even such thinkers {{as opposed}} the ascetic view could not extricate {{themselves}} entirely from the meshes of Neoplatonic mysticism, which beheld {{in the flesh}} or in matter the source of evil. Thus Abraham ben Ḥiyya strongly refutes the Neoplatonic conception of evil as being identical with matter, and maintains against BaḦya that indulgence in fasting and other modes of penitence is not meritorious, since only he who is ruled by his lower desires may resort to asceticism as the means of curbing his passion and disciplining his soul, whereas the really good should confine himself to such modes <b>of</b> <b>abstinence</b> as are prescribed by the Law.|$|E

25|$|Clinical {{studies have}} {{consistently}} associated medical and recreational opioid use with hypogonadism and hormone imbalance in different sexes. The effect is dose-dependent. Most {{studies suggest that}} the majority (perhaps as much as 90%) of chronic opioid users suffer hormone imbalances. Opioids can also interfere with menstruation in women by limiting the production of luteinizing hormone (LH). Opioid-induced endocrinopathy likely causes the strong association of opioid use with osteoporosis and bone fracture. It also may increase pain and thereby interfere with the intended clinical effect of opioid treatment. Opioid-induced endocrinopathy is likely caused by their agonism of opioid receptors in the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland. One study found that the depressed testosterone levels of heroin addicts returned to normal within one month <b>of</b> <b>abstinence,</b> suggesting that the effect is not permanent. , the effect of low-dose or acute opiate use on the endocrine system is unclear.|$|E
25|$|Some {{research}} has found the average length <b>of</b> <b>abstinence</b> for bulimics in OA {{was significantly higher than}} the average length for binge eaters. Paradoxically, bulimics were also found to attend fewer meetings, and had less of a commitment to write their thoughts and feelings down daily. However, the frequency of relapse for bulimics and binge eaters was not significantly different. The differences may be explained by the predictable nature of the bulimic cycle. Other {{research has}} found binge eaters in OA had better success than bulimics. Most OA members who have reported negative experiences in the program are anorexic. This could be caused by OA's focus on problems of eating too much rather than too little. Some OA practices, such as refraining from eating certain kinds of foods, are antithetical in the case of anorexics. Though, most anorexics have a previous history of bulimia.|$|E
25|$|In the Clinic sample, 100 severe alcoholics {{treated at}} the clinic were {{followed}} for 8 years. The clinic’s methods were multi-modal: detoxification and hospital treatment followed by referral to AA.

Subjects who had a stable social environment or who frequently went to AA meetings had the highest rates <b>of</b> <b>abstinence.</b> Overall, however, treatment other than AA did not significantly improve the subjects’ outcome. In fact Vaillant reports the dismal fact that fully 95% of the Clinic sample had relapsed at some time during the 8-year study period.

There was one indicator, a financial one, of short-term success: clinical intervention had significantly reduced the cost of future health care for the alcoholics.|$|E
