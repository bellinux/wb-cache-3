In the proposed converter high step-up voltage is obtained by single power switching technique that operates low duty cycle with <b>isolated</b> <b>transformer</b> inductors and switched capacitors and power diodes.

40|$|Abstract: The superconducting {{fault current}} limiter (SFCL) can quickly limit the fault current {{shortly after the}} short circuit occurs and recover the superconducting state after the fault removes and {{plays a role in}} {{compensating}} the voltage sag of the sound feeder adjacent to the fault feeder as well as the fault current limiting operation of the fault feeder. Especially, the flux-lock type SFCL with an <b>isolated</b> <b>transformer,</b> which consists of two parallel connected coils on an iron core and the <b>isolated</b> <b>transformer</b> connected in series with one of two coils, has different voltage sag compensating and current limiting characteristics due to the winding direction and the inductance ratio of two coils. The current limiting and the voltage sag compensating characteristics of a SFCL using a transformer winding were analyzed. Through the analysis on the short-circuit tests results considering the winding direction of two coils, the SFCL designed with the additive polarity winding has shown the higher limited fault current than the SFCL designed with the subtractive polarity winding. It could be confirmed that the higher fault current limitation of the SFCL could be contributed to the higher load voltage sag compensation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{introduces}} {{a family of}} buck-type DC-DC converters with autotransformers, including forward, push-pull, half-bridge, and full-bridge topologies. Compared with an <b>isolated</b> <b>transformer,</b> the autotransformer has a simpler winding structure, and it only needs to transfer part of the input power, resulting in a smaller secondary winding current. Analysis shows that the autotransformer can also help to reduce the voltage stress and current ratings of power devices in the DC-DC converters. For some applications, a simple lossless passive clamp circuit can be implemented to solve the transformer leakage problems, and the gate drive is significantly improved with a simple self-adaptive dead-time-controlled bootstrap gate driver.
