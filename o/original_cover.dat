5|$|In 1997, Antestor {{recorded}} a promotional CD titled Kongsblod. The promo-CD caught {{the interest of}} British Cacophonous Records, {{one of the biggest}} labels with experience in the black metal style and helped established groups such as Cradle of Filth and Dimmu Borgir start their career. Cacophonous signed a record deal for 2 albums with Antestor. In 1998, Cacophonous released Kongsblod under a different name, The Return of the Black Death, and changed the <b>original</b> <b>cover</b> art of a famous Norwegian painting to artwork by Joe Petagno, a well-known American heavy metal cover art creator.|$|E
5|$|In {{the image}} {{selected}} by McCartney, the group {{walk across the}} street in single file from left to right, with Lennon leading, followed by Starr, McCartney, and Harrison. McCartney is barefoot and {{out of step with the}} other members. Apart from Harrison, the group are wearing suits designed by Tommy Nutter. To the left of the picture, parked next to the zebra crossing, is a white Volkswagen Beetle which belonged to one of the people living in the block of flats across from the recording studio. After the album was released, the number plate (LMW 281F) was stolen repeatedly from the car. In 1986, the car was sold at auction for £2,530 and in 2001 was on display in a museum in Germany. The man standing on the pavement to the right of the picture is Paul Cole (7 July 1911– 13 February 2008), an American tourist unaware he had been photographed until he saw the album cover months later. On the <b>original</b> <b>cover,</b> McCartney holds a cigarette; in 2003 several US poster companies airbrushed this cigarette out of the image, without permission from either Apple or McCartney.|$|E
5|$|The album's <b>original</b> <b>cover</b> art by Burton Silverman {{features}} a watercolour {{portrait of a}} long-haired, bearded man in shabby clothes. The idea for the cover came from a photograph Anderson's wife took of a homeless man on Thames Embankment, and Anderson later felt {{it would have been}} better to have used the photograph rather than commission the painting. Ian Anderson recalls posing for a photograph for the painting, though Silverman claims it was a self-portrait. The artwork was commissioned and purchased by Chrysalis Records head Terry Ellis. Artist Silverman claims the art was only licensed for use as an album cover, and not for merchandising; and approached the band seeking remuneration for its further use. Silverman and Anderson have different accounts of level of enmity involved in this. The original artwork for both the front and back covers are now privately owned by an unknown family, apparently having been stolen from a London hotel room.|$|E

5|$|The song's {{music video}} was filmed in various {{locations}} in Albuquerque and Portland. Among the areas filmed included the Rio Grande, junkyards, and near Mercer's home. The clip {{was directed by}} Lance Bangs, an associate of Spike Jonze. It features the band re-enacting the cover art of other bands' albums, including Zen Arcade and New Day Rising by Hüsker Dü, Let It Be by The Replacements, Moon Pix by Cat Power, Double Nickels on the Dime by The Minutemen, Squirrel Bait's first EP, Sonic Youth's Sister and Slint's Spiderland. Shooting in just two cities created logistical problems for album covers originally photographed {{in cities such as}} Los Angeles, Minneapolis, and Louisville. For the homage to Double Nickels on the Dime, the band had to track down the exact model of the car featured on the album cover (a Volkswagen Beetle), and Albuquerque happened to have a San Pedro Street, which is featured on a freeway sign on the <b>original</b> <b>cover.</b>|$|E
5|$|As a {{promotion}} for the film, Warner Bros. Entertainment released , {{a series of}} narrated animations of the original comic book. The first chapter was released for purchase {{in the summer of}} 2008 on digital video stores, such as iTunes Store and Amazon Video on Demand. DC Direct released action figures based on the film in January 2009. Director Zack Snyder also set up a YouTube contest petitioning Watchmen fans to create faux commercials of products made by the fictional Veidt Enterprises. The producers also released two short video pieces online, which were intended to be viral videos designed as fictional backstory pieces, with one being a 1970 newscast marking the 10th anniversary of the public appearance of Dr. Manhattan. The other was a short propaganda film promoting the Keene Act of 1977, which made it illegal to be a superhero without government support. An official viral marketing web site, The New Frontiersman, is named after the tabloid magazine featured in the graphic novel, and contains teasers styled as declassified documents. After the trailer to the film premiered in July 2008, DC Comics president Paul Levitz said that the company had had to print more than 900,000 copies of Watchmen trade collection to meet the additional demand for the book that the advertising campaign had generated, with the total annual print run expected to be over one million copies. DC Comics reissued Watchmen #1 for the <b>original</b> <b>cover</b> price of $1.50 on December 10, 2008; no other issues are to be reprinted.|$|E

25|$|The first {{performance}} of the band using the name the Residents was at the Boarding House in San Francisco in 1971. That same year another tape was completed called Baby Sex.

25|$|Roadrunner Records {{released}} a box set {{of all the}} band's albums (with the exception of Dead Again) for Back to Black Friday 2011, a spinoff of Record Store Day, on November 25, 2011. Each vinyl cover has no text and The Origin of the Feces uses its <b>original</b> <b>cover</b> art. The box set also contains various bumper stickers related to the band.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes the {{restoration}} of the cover is a matter of surgically strengthening the <b>original</b> <b>cover</b> by lifting the original materials and applying new materials for strength. This is perhaps a more common method for covers made with book-cloth although leather books can be approached this way as well. Materials such as Japanese tissues of various weights may be used. Colors may be matched using acrylic paints or simple colored pencils.|$|E
50|$|At {{some point}} during this time, the house was {{modified}} slightly. Some of the windows were expanded. Finials {{were removed from the}} tower and roof. The rear porch, <b>original</b> <b>covered</b> by a gabled roof supported by turned wooden columns, was extended and its roof removed.|$|R

25|$|Virgin Killer is {{the fourth}} studio album by German rock band Scorpions. It was {{released}} in 1976 and was the band's first album to attract attention outside Europe. The title is described as being a reference to time as the killer of innocence. The <b>original</b> <b>cover</b> featured a nude prepubescent girl, which stirred controversy in the UK, US and elsewhere. As a result, the album was re-issued with a different cover in some countries.|$|E
25|$|Valve {{was forced}} to alter its <b>{{original}}</b> <b>cover</b> art for the game by the ESRB; the original image depicted the series' hand with its little finger, ring finger and the thumb torn off, which would thus have the index finger and middle finger remaining. It was deemed too explicit, but to appease the ESRB, Valve changed the image so that the fingers were merely bent back instead, but the company {{was still able to}} include the torn-off thumb in all regions except for Japan and Germany, where it had to be censored.|$|E
25|$|Until early 2010, {{the album}} {{was going to be}} called 18 Good Reasons with the album cover stylised to recall the Motown era. But the chance {{discovery}} of a photograph of 13-year-old Collins playing drums in the Getty Images library caused a change in direction, resulting in the album being called Going Back. In an interview on Today in September 2010, Collins noted he actually had to pay for use of the picture of himself as the cover image. However, the 2016 reissue of the album will use an entirely new cover photograph featuring present-day Collins instead of recreating or reusing the <b>original</b> <b>cover.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{album cover}} is an {{illustration}} (in pencil) by artist Nick Price, {{who had also}} designed the cover for the programme for her 1979 tour. Bush {{was pleased with the}} results (it depicts a multitude of animals and monsters emerging from under her skirt). Of the concept, Bush said that it reflects the title, depicting good and bad things that emerge from you. The album was released on compact disc in Japan in 1987 with the cover art modified. A section of the <b>original</b> <b>cover</b> art was enlarged, creating two different booklet covers: the outer one modified; and underneath the original. The album's cover was voted 'Greatest Album Cover of 1980' by Record Mirror.|$|E
25|$|While Hitler was {{in power}} (1933–1945), Mein Kampf came to be {{available}} in three common editions. The first, the Volksausgabe or People's Edition, featured the <b>original</b> <b>cover</b> on the dust jacket and was navy blue underneath with a gold swastika eagle embossed on the cover. The Hochzeitsausgabe, or Wedding Edition, in a slipcase with the seal of the province embossed in gold onto a parchment-like cover was given free to marrying couples. In 1940, the Tornister-Ausgabe, or Knapsack Edition, was released. This edition was a compact, but unabridged, version in a red cover and was released by the post office, available {{to be sent to}} loved ones fighting at the front. These three editions combined both volumes into the same book.|$|E
25|$|In {{the longer}} term, FWS plans to create up to 30 acres (12 ha) of {{additional}} grassland {{by removing the}} runway pavement and restoring the <b>original</b> <b>cover.</b> An 8-foot (2 m) wide strip of concrete would be left {{for use as a}} public trail. While grasses are already beginning to grow through cracks in the runways, the agency would prefer not to wait as aircraft continue to make illegal landings at the refuge, disturbing the birds, despite markings on the runways themselves and on aviation charts of the area indicating that the facility is closed. It has not yet determined how this will be done in the most environmentally sensitive fashion. Similarly, it hopes to restore the original stream pattern through the property by removing the culverts and other reroutings made during construction of the airfield.|$|E
