50|$|Manufacturers such as BMW, Honda, Toyota and Mercedes-Benz have {{included}} fuel-economy gauges in some instrument clusters, showing fuel mileage in real time. The ammeter was the gauge {{of choice for}} monitoring {{the state of the}} charging system until the 1970s. Later it was replaced by the voltmeter. Today most family vehicles have warning lights instead of voltmeters or <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>gauges</b> in their dashboard instrument clusters, though sports cars often have proper gauges for performance purposes and driver appeasement.|$|R
50|$|Back {{in control}} of Auto-liter, Miniger quickly {{expanded}} into other automotive product lines, including electric starters, ignition systems, and batteries. Calling his company Electric Auto-lite, in 1927 Miniger gained a controlling interest in the National Lead Battery Company, Prest-O-Lite Battery Company, and Prest-O-Lite, Ltd. (located in Toronto, Canada). Battery manufacturing plants were established in seven U.S. states and in Canada. A foreign division was established and batteries manufactured in six overseas locations. Miniger bought out another headlamp company in 1934 and formed the Brown Lamp Division in Cincinnati, Ohio. The same year, he purchased outright the Starting and Lighting Division of the American Bosch Magneto Company. Late in 1934, Electric Auto-lite merged with Moto-Meter Gauge and Equipment Company and expanded into industrial gauges and thermometers, molded plastic parts, speedometers, <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>gauges,</b> gasoline gauges, heat indicators and ammeters.|$|R
50|$|Instruments {{varied from}} car to car in {{accordance}} with pilot specifications but also according to engine type used. In the IoM tourist Trophy the following were used: Jaeger rev counter, Sunbeam <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge,</b> fuel air pressure, twin magneto switches, twin glass oil restrictors.|$|E
5000|$|The first Model 77 was a rigid-framed telescopic-forked Dominator {{version of}} 500 cc {{produced}} from 1950, and supplied to the Australian market only. This used the all-iron Dominator 500 cc twin engine, with an <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> in the ES2 style but flat-bottomed petrol tank. About 240 were made, from 1950 to 1952.|$|E

There were new valve spring covers and an updated Zenith carburetor.|$|E
2500|$|The Bristol 138, the record-breaking {{machine is}} a low-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane designed to fly at extremely high altitudes for the era. Aviation publication Flight observed {{of the aircraft}} that: [...] "except for its size, reminds one very much of the little Bristol Brownie.... the machine is the largest single-seater aeroplane ever built". The pilot was seated in a relatively spacious cockpit, which was heated by air directed from the oil coolers set within the wings, which could be actively controlled. Instrumentation included fore-and-aft levels, <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>gauges,</b> airspeed indicator and fuel gauge, engine speed indicator and pyrometer. Purpose-built recording altimeters, developed by the RAE, were housed within the wings, while a separate altimeter was installed within the cockpit for the pilot.|$|R
5000|$|A {{number of}} {{exterior}} features set the Rally {{apart from other}} 128s. At the front there was a black radiator grille, carrying the round Fiat emblem typical of the marque's sports cars; split bumpers joined by a tubular steel bar; and halogen headlamps and bumper-mounted auxiliary lamps. At the rear dual round tail lamps replaced the square ones found on the regular two-door 128. [...] "Rally" [...] badging on the bonnet and booth lid and stripes along the side sills completed the look.The interior was upholstered in black leatherette, and the dashboard housed upgraded instrumentation: a tachometer was standard equipment, and water temperature and <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>gauges</b> took {{the place of the}} ashtray, relocated to the centre console. Front sports seats with headrests and a two-spoke sports steering wheel replaced the standard items.|$|R
50|$|For 1966, the Barracuda {{received}} new taillamps, new front sheet metal, and a {{new instrument}} panel. The latter had room for <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> and tachometer <b>gauges</b> on models so equipped. The 1966 front sheet metal which, except for the grille, was shared with the Valiant, and gave a more rectilinear contour to the fenders. Deluxe models featured fender-top turn signal indicators with a stylized fin motif. The bumpers were larger, and the grille featured a strong grid theme. A center console was optional for the first time.|$|R
50|$|The NE three-door Sports and five-door Superwagon added {{a limited}} slip differential, front bumper overriders, spare wheel cover, side pin striping, 16-inch chrome wheels, and {{optional}} two-tone paint over the base cars.

50|$|Some of {{the more}} {{interesting}} optional items available for the first generation Chieftain included a radio with seven vacuum tubes, tissue dispenser, under seat heaters, and a Remington Auto-Home shaver. In 1951, the horsepower on the 8-cylinder rose to 116. The Chieftain came with a gas gauge, ammeter, <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge,</b> and a temperature gauge which had marks for 160, 180, and 220 degrees Fahrenheit.|$|E
5000|$|The Gordon was a {{conventional}} two-bay fabric-covered metal biplane. It was powered by [...] variants of the Armstrong Siddeley Panther IIa engine. Armament was one fixed, forward-firing [...]303 in Vickers machine gun and a [...]303 in Lewis Gun {{in the rear}} cockpit, plus 500 lb of bombs. The aircraft was somewhat basic; instruments were airspeed indicator, altimeter, <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge,</b> tachometer, turn and bank indicator and compass.|$|E
50|$|For 2006, {{another major}} change was made as the {{instrument}} panel on all Panther-platform cars was redesigned; the optional digital instrument panel was discontinued, as {{was the use of}} an analog odometer. While the <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> and voltage <b>gauges</b> were removed, a notable addition was a tachometer; the Grand Marquis was one of the very last Ford vehicles sold without one. Similar to other Ford vehicles, the new instrument panel features a Driver Information Center (trip computer), consolidating many functions previously seen in the overhead console in between the speedometer and tachometer.|$|R
25|$|The 1965 Chevrolet Chevy II and Nova were {{updated with}} cleaner {{front-end}} styling {{courtesy of a}} fresh full-width grille with new integrated headlight bezels. Parking lights moved down to the deep-section bumper, and sedans gained a new roofline. Taillight and backup lights were restyled, as was the rear cove. The 1965 Chevy II came in entry-level 100 form or as the posher Nova 400, each in three body styles. The Nova Super Sport came as a Sport Coupe only, and its production dipped to just 9,100 cars. Super Sports had a new brushed-chrome console with floor-mounted four-speed manual transmission or Powerglide automatic, but a column-mounted three-speed manual remained standard. Bucket seats wore textured vinyl trim, and the dashboard held ammeter, <b>oil</b> <b>pressure,</b> and temperature <b>gauges.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The GT {{comes with}} a [...] 6.0 L (364 cu in) Generation IV V8, {{featuring}} a 6-speed 6L80 automatic and Active Fuel Management, capable of reaching 60 mph in 5.3 seconds, with quarter-mile times as low as 13.8 seconds. The G8 GT averages a fuel economy of 15/24 mpg (city/highway). A 6-speed manual was being considered as an option on the GT model, but Pontiac decided against offering it, stating that it would instead be offered as an option on the G8 GXP. One change in 2009 was the deletion of the center stack <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> and voltage <b>gauges.</b> Midway through the 2009 model year a few changes {{were made to the}} G8 GT, including an additional pair of catalytic converters which reduced engine output to , the addition of bluetooth and the removal of the rear cup holders that pulled out from under the rear seats (cupholders in the fold-down rear center armrest took their place).|$|R
