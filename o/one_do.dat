The following day, Italian dive bombers attacked MTBs of the 2nd Torpedo Division near Šibenik, with the Yugoslav boats shooting down one Italian aircraft and damaging another.|$|E

5|$|The Ganymedian surface albedo is very asymmetric; {{the leading}} {{hemisphere}} is {{brighter than the}} trailing one. This is similar to Europa, but the reverse for Callisto. The trailing hemisphere of Ganymede appears to be enriched in sulfur dioxide. The distribution of carbon dioxide does not demonstrate any hemispheric asymmetry, {{although it is not}} observed near the poles. Impact craters on Ganymede (except <b>one)</b> <b>do</b> not show any enrichment in carbon dioxide, which also distinguishes it from Callisto.

5|$|ZG 26's Bf 110s {{were flying}} near the formation, {{and tried to}} offer JG 3 support by intercepting Crossley's fighters but failed. Crossley led a head-on attack and downed <b>one</b> <b>Do</b> 17 while his {{squadron}} damaged several others. So close had the RAF fighters pressed home their attacks that the bombers had to move and jink to avoid their fire. It put the bomb-aimers off their aim. The Dorniers were already too close to their targets and the pilots could not realign before the formation was over and passed the aiming point. Having been thwarted from bombing their official targets they aimed for rail tracks {{to the north and}} east of the airfield. Some of the unit targeted RAF Croydon, three miles north-west of Biggin Hill. Others turned around without releasing their bombs. The crews that bombed the rail lines found they were a difficult target to hit at 15,000 feet. Some released their bombs at intervals in the hope of hitting their targets, however some bombs fell on residential property.|$|E
5|$|When Germany and Italy {{attacked}} Yugoslavia on 6 April 1941, {{the initial}} attacks {{came from the}} air. From early morning, Italian and German aircraft attacked the naval facilities at Split and the Bay of Kotor. In the afternoon, Italian dive bombers attacked the Bay of Kotor. Their attack damaged a Do J flying boat, {{but one of the}} Italian aircraft was shot down by anti-aircraft fire, while another two were damaged. Shortly after this more Italian bombers unsuccessfully attacked the Tivat Arsenal, suffering three aircraft damaged in the attack. On the same day, three KJRM Dornier Do 22s and Rogožarski SIM-XIV-Hs provided air cover while the Galeb-class minelayer Jastreb laid a minefield off Budva harbour. The following day, three Italian bombers became lost in cloud and emerged over the Bay of Kotor where two were damaged and one shot down by anti-aircraft fire. On 8 April, there were Italian attacks on the base of the 2nd and 3rd Torpedo Divisions in Šibenik, and three Do J flying boats were destroyed by Italian fighters at Jadrtovac. A number of Do 22s and SIM-XIV-Hs also flew reconnaissance missions on that day. The next day, Italian bombers struck a number of Yugoslav naval and seaplane bases along the coast, destroying and damaging several aircraft. <b>One</b> <b>Do</b> 22 pilot located an Italian convoy crossing the Adriatic and despite heavy anti-aircraft fire attacked it twice without result. Another three KJRM Do 22s raided Durazzo in Italian-controlled Albania, but were driven off.|$|E

500|$|According to writers R. M. Koster and Guillermo Sánchez, Spadafora {{returned}} to Panama {{on a bus}} from Costa Rica. After crossing the border, witnesses saw Spadafora removed from the bus by the PDF. His decapitated body was later found showing signs of brutal torture, wrapped in a United States Postal Service mail bag. Noriega was widely believed {{to be responsible for}} the murder, and according to Koster and Sánchez, the U.S. had intelligence implicating Noriega. On the day of Spadafora's arrest, the U.S. National Security Agency monitored a telephone conversation between Noriega and Luis Córdoba, the military commander in Chiriquí province where Spadafora was arrested. During the conversation Córdoba told Noriega, [...] "We have the rabid dog." [...] Noriega responded [...] "And what does <b>one</b> <b>do</b> with a dog that has rabies?" [...] Spadafora's murder badly damaged Noriega's image, both within and outside Panama, and was among the reasons for the U.S. beginning to view Noriega as a liability rather than an asset, despite his ongoing support for U.S. interventions elsewhere.|$|E

500|$|He went to Sydney in January 1863 to captain Victoria against New South Wales on the Domain. The match {{turned into}} a riot when the crowd invaded the field during a dispute over the Victorian umpire's impartiality. Wills, leading his men from the Domain, was struck in the face by a stone, and {{professionals}} George Marshall and William Greaves fled the city, reducing the Victorian side to nine men. Wills took 8 wickets and top scored in both innings (25* and 17*), but Victoria lost by 84 runs. The Melbourne media castigated Wills for allowing the game to continue and called him a traitor when evidence surfaced that he agreed to play for New South Wales in the weeks prior to the match. He denied all accusations and wrote in an angry letter to The Sydney Morning Herald: [...] "I for <b>one</b> <b>do</b> not think that Victoria will ever send an Eleven up here again." [...] Back in Victoria, he became engaged to Julie Anderson, a farmer's daughter from Skipton and friend of the Wills family. Her name {{does not appear in}} any of Wills' surviving letters; he rarely mentioned the women he courted, let alone his feelings for them. Wills stayed in Geelong {{for the start of the}} 1863 football season, breaking his promise of an early return to Cullin-la-ringo, much to the dismay of his mother and the holding's trustees.|$|E
500|$|The Beatles were {{performing}} at Liverpool's Cavern Club in November 1961 {{when they were}} introduced to Brian Epstein after a midday concert. Epstein was a homosexual, and according to biographer Philip Norman, one of Brian's reasons for wanting to manage the group {{was that he was}} physically attracted to Lennon. Almost as soon as Julian was born, Lennon went on holiday to Spain with Epstein, leading to speculation about their relationship. When he was later questioned about it, Lennon said, [...] "Well, it was almost a love affair, but not quite. It was never consummated. But it was a pretty intense relationship. It was my first experience with a homosexual that I was conscious was homosexual. We used to sit in a café in Torremolinos looking at all the boys and I'd say, 'Do you like that <b>one?</b> <b>Do</b> you like this one?' I was rather enjoying the experience, thinking like a writer all the time: I am experiencing this." [...] Soon after their return from Spain—at McCartney's twenty-first birthday party in June 1963—Lennon physically attacked Cavern Club Master of ceremonies Bob Wooler for saying [...] "How was your honeymoon, John?" [...] The MC, known for his wordplay and affectionate but cutting remarks, was making a joke, but ten months had passed since Lennon's marriage, and the deferred honeymoon was still two months in the future. To Lennon, who was drunk at the time, the matter was simple: [...] "He called me a queer so I battered his bloody ribs in".|$|E
