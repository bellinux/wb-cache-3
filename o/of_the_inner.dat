5|$|The inner {{mitochondrial}} membrane is compartmentalized into numerous cristae, which expand {{the surface area}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> {{mitochondrial membrane}}, enhancing its ability to produce ATP. For typical liver mitochondria, the area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> membrane is about five times {{as large as the}} outer membrane. This ratio is variable and mitochondria from cells that have a greater demand for ATP, such as muscle cells, contain even more cristae. These folds are studded with small round bodies known as F1 particles or oxysomes. These are not simple random folds but rather invaginations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> membrane, which can affect overall chemiosmotic function.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. According to <b>the</b> actual {{structure}} <b>of</b> {{steel wire}} wound reinforced rubber flexible pipe, using the finite element software ANSYS, 3 -D {{finite element model}} of flexible pipe is established. For <b>the</b> mechanical response <b>of</b> flexible pipe under internal pressure, the comparison on the result by numerical calculation, the static loading test and the result by analytic method shows that the 3 -D finite element model of flexible pipe is rational. Moreover, based on the finite element model <b>of</b> flexible pipe, <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> internal pressure, spanning length and reinforced steel wire diameter on <b>the</b> axial stress <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>innerest</b> steel layer and <b>the</b> Mises stress <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>innerest</b> rubber layer is analyzed...|$|R

5|$|Typically {{carried out}} by a {{traditional}} circumciser using a blade, FGM is conducted from days after birth to puberty and beyond. In half the countries for which national figures are available, most girls are cut {{before the age of}} five. Procedures differ according to the country or ethnic group. They include removal of the clitoral hood and clitoral glans; removal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> labia; and removal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> and outer labia and closure of the vulva. In this last procedure, known as infibulation, a small hole is left for the passage of urine and menstrual fluid; the vagina is opened for intercourse and opened further for childbirth.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} Sun, the {{gravitational}} influence of Jupiter has {{helped shape the}} Solar System. The orbits {{of most of the}} system's planets lie closer to Jupiter's orbital plane than the Sun's equatorial plane (Mercury is the only planet that is closer to the Sun's equator in orbital tilt), the Kirkwood gaps in the asteroid belt are mostly caused by Jupiter, and the planet may have been responsible for the Late Heavy Bombardment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> Solar System's history.|$|E
5|$|Amalthea is in a {{close orbit}} around Jupiter and is within {{the outer edge of}} the Amalthea Gossamer Ring, which is formed from dust ejected from its surface.

Irregularly shaped and reddish in color, it is thought to consist of porous water ice with unknown amounts of other materials. Its surface features include large craters and ridges.|$|E

This collision stripped more than half the mass from the smaller M32 and created the ring structures in Andromeda.|$|E
5|$|Comets {{are small}} Solar System bodies, {{typically}} {{only a few}} kilometres across, composed largely of volatile ices. They have highly eccentric orbits, generally a perihelion within the orbits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> planets and an aphelion far beyond Pluto. When a comet enters the inner Solar System, its proximity to the Sun causes its icy surface to sublimate and ionise, creating a coma: a long tail {{of gas and dust}} often visible to the naked eye.|$|E
