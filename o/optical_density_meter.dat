40|$|The {{process of}} cell seeding on {{biocompatible}} scaffolds {{has a major}} impact on the morphological evolution of an engineered tissue because it involves all the key factors of tissue formation: cells, matrix, and their mutual interactions. In order to characterize the efficiency of cell seeding techniques, mainly static parameters are used such as cell density, cell distribution, and cell viability. Here, we present an experimental model that incorporates an <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> <b>meter</b> providing real-time information on the cell seeding velocity, a relevant dynamic parameter of cell–matrix interaction. Our setup may be adapted to fit various cell seeding protocols. A modified fluorimetric cuvette is used as bioreactor culture flask. The optical density of the magnetically stirred cell suspension is recorded by a digital optoelectronic device. We performed calibration experiments in order to prove that, in our experimental conditions, optical density depends linearly on the number of cells in the unit volume of suspension. Control studies showed that, during the time course of a typical experiment (up to 10  h), the cells (murine 3 T 3 fibroblasts) neither aggregated nor adhered significantly to the walls of the cuvette. Hence, our setup yields the number of cells attached to the scaffold as a function of time. In order to analyze the experimental seeding curves, we built a kinetic model based on Langmuir’s adsorption theory, which was extended to include a preliminary step of integrin function recovery. We illustrate the proposed approach by two sets of experiments that involved trypsin–EDTA or only EDTA treatment (no trypsin) used to detach the cells from the culture flasks. The data indicate that in both cases cell–matrix adhesion has a sequential, two-step dynamics, but kinetic parameters and attachment site availability depend on the experimental protocol...|$|E

Methods: MP <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> (measured psychophysically using heterochromatic flicker photometry [HFP]), and serum concentrations of L and Z (quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography [HPLC]), were recorded every month for 24 consecutive months. Results: Mean MP <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> (SD) was 0. 361 (0. 086) and 0. 369 (0. 074) for right and left eyes, respectively. There was no statistically significant seasonal variation in MP <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> for the group (two-way ANOVA: p > 0. 05). Serum concentrations of L and Z demonstrated a statistically significant subject-season interaction effect (two-way ANOVA: p p < 0. 05).

The values of <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> of the specimens were expressed in millimeters aluminum equivalent (mm eq Al). The samples were X-rayed using two charge coupled devices (CCD) - RVG (Trophy) - Visualix (Gendex) and a phosphor plate system - Digora (Soredex).

40|$|This review {{compares the}} results of studies that have {{investigated}} the impact of lutein and zeaxanthin supplementation on macular pigment <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> (MPOD) with those that have investigated the reliability of techniques used to measure macular pigment <b>optical</b> <b>density.</b> The review will focus on studies that have used heterochromatic flicker photometry for measurement of macular pigment <b>optical</b> <b>density,</b> as {{this is the only}} technique that is currently available commercially to clinicians. We identified articles that reported on supplementation with lutein and/or zeaxanthin and/or meso-zeaxanthin on macular pigment <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> measurement techniques published in peer-reviewed journals, through a multi-staged, systematic approach. Twenty-four studies have investigated the repeatability of MPOD measurements using heterochromatic flicker photometry. Of these, 10 studies provided a coefficient of repeatability or data from which the coefficient could be calculated, with a range in values of 0. 06 to 0. 58. The lowest coefficient of repeatability assessed on naïve subjects alone was 0. 08. These values tell us that, at best, changes greater than 0. 08 can be considered clinically significant and at worst, only changes greater than 0. 58 can be considered clinically significant. Six studies assessed the effect of supplementation with up to 20 mg/day lutein on macular pigment <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> measured using heterochromatic flicker photometry and the mean increase in macular pigment <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> ranged from 0. 025 to 0. 09. It seems reasonable to conclude that the chance of eliciting an increase in macular pigment <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> during six months of daily supplementation with between 10 and 20 mg lutein that is of sufficient magnitude to be detected by using heterochromatic flicker photometry on an individual basis is small. Commercially available heterochromatic flicker photometers for macular pigment <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> assessment in the clinical environment appear to demonstrate particularly poor coefficient of repeatability values. Clinicians should exercise caution when considering the purchase of these instruments for potential monitoring of macular pigment <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> in response to supplementation in individual patients...|$|R
