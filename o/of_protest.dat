5|$|Chinese {{converts}} {{were also}} involved in the controversy through letters <b>of</b> <b>protest,</b> books, pamphlets, etc. The Controversy debate was most intense between a group of Christian literati and a Catholic Bishop (named Charles Maigrot de Crissey) in Fujian province, with the Chinese group of converts support the Jesuits and the bishop supported by less accommodating Iberian mendicants (Dominicans and Franciscans).|$|E
5|$|In the film, Koskov and Whitaker {{repeatedly}} use {{vehicles and}} drug packets {{marked with the}} Red Cross. This action angered a number of Red Cross Societies, which sent letters <b>of</b> <b>protest</b> regarding the film. In addition, the British Red Cross attempted to prosecute the filmmakers and distributors. However, no legal action was taken. As a result, a disclaimer was added {{at the start of}} the film and some DVD releases.|$|E

A model <b>of</b> <b>protesting</b> crowd was determined {{and then a}} CROCADILE model <b>of</b> <b>protesting</b> crowd was engineered and demonstrated. We validated the model by using two scenarios where protesters are varied with different personalities. The results indicated that CROCADILE served well as the platform for protesting crowd modeling simulationComment: 3 pages, ISCRAM-VN 201...|$|R

5|$|King and the SCLC {{put into}} {{practice}} many {{of the principles of}} the Christian Left and applied the tactics of nonviolent protest with great success by strategically choosing the method <b>of</b> <b>protest</b> and the places in which protests were carried out. There were often dramatic stand-offs with segregationist authorities, who sometimes turned violent.|$|E
5|$|Since it {{was dropped}} as the {{official}} emblem of Belarus, opposition {{groups such as the}} Belarusian People's Front have used the Pahonia as part of their own party symbols or used them as a form <b>of</b> <b>protest</b> against Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko.|$|E
5|$|Tensions between Uyghurs and Han have {{resulted}} in waves <b>of</b> <b>protest</b> in recent years. Xinjiang has been the location of several instances of violence and ethnic clashes, such as the Ghulja Incident of 1997, the 2008 Kashgar attack, widespread unrest preceding the Olympic Games in Beijing, as well as numerous minor attacks.|$|E
5000|$|The University of Nottingham {{claimed that}} [...] "no footage <b>of</b> <b>protests</b> was {{retained}} or passed to other authorities, including {{the police or}} government.

5|$|Uncle Tom's Cabin has exerted an {{influence}} equaled by few other novels in history. Upon publication, Uncle Tom's Cabin ignited a firestorm <b>of</b> <b>protest</b> from defenders of slavery (who created {{a number of}} books in response to the novel) while the book elicited praise from abolitionists. As a best-seller, the novel heavily influenced later protest literature.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{skipped the}} opening {{ceremony}} of the 2008 Summer Olympics, on 8 August 2008 in Beijing. He attended the closing ceremony instead, on 24 August 2008. Brown had been under intense pressure from human rights campaigners {{to send a message}} to China, concerning the 2008 Tibetan unrest. His decision not to attend {{the opening ceremony}} was not an act <b>of</b> <b>protest,</b> but rather was made several weeks in advance and not intended as a stand on principle.|$|E
5|$|Centre Point, {{just beyond}} {{the eastern end of}} Oxford Street next to Tottenham Court Road station, was {{designed}} by property developer Harry Hyams and opened in 1966. It failed to find a suitable tenant and sat empty for many years, eventually being occupied by squatters who used it as a centre <b>of</b> <b>protest</b> against the lack of suitable accommodation in Central London. In 2015, the building began to be converted into residential flats, with development expected to finish in 2017.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} <b>of</b> <b>protests</b> in China concern local grievances, such as {{the corruption}} of county- or township-level government or Communist Party officials, exploitation by employers, excessive taxation, and so on. Protests targeting specific, local grievances, and where citizens propose actionable remedies, {{are more likely to}} succeed than alternative forms <b>of</b> <b>protests.</b>|$|R
30|$|These {{findings}} support the literature that suggests that protests overall are more likely in democracies while violent repression <b>of</b> <b>protests</b> is more likely in nondemocratic states and transitioning democracies (Davenport 1999; Franklin 2009; Chenoweth 2013). These findings also concur with scholars who argue that the external context <b>of</b> a <b>protest</b> {{is more important than}} the internal characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>protest</b> organization(s) or their tactics in determining the outcome <b>of</b> the <b>protest</b> (Giugni 2004).|$|R

5|$|Despite being {{a popular}} protest flag, {{the leaders of}} the Umbrella Movement {{requested}} that participants of the movement not use the flag, as they intended to protest without intentionally provoking Chinese authorities or the Hong Kong Police Force. The flag has also been used outside of Hong Kong; in the United Kingdom, the blue ensign {{has been used as a}} symbol <b>of</b> <b>protest</b> to pressure the government of the United Kingdom to ensure the Sino-British Joint Declaration is fulfilled.|$|E
5|$|During the Pittston strike, the UMWA {{wanted to}} only use nonviolent means <b>of</b> <b>protest</b> against the company. Many union members practiced {{this method of}} civil disobedience and found {{creative}} ways for their message to be heard such as mass sit down strike and road blockades. However, many wildcat strikers ignored {{the request of the}} UMWA and used violence to express the anger that they felt toward the Pittston Coal Company. By the time the strike had ended, over 4,000people had been arrested for their actions.|$|E

5000|$|It {{is often}} {{argued that the}} rate <b>of</b> <b>protests</b> has been {{escalating}} since 2004, However Steven Friedman argues that the current wave <b>of</b> <b>protests</b> stretches back to the 1970s. The rate <b>of</b> <b>protests</b> [...] "rose dramatically in {{the first eight months}} of 2012" [...] and it was reported that there 540 protests in the province of Gauteng between 1 April and 10 May 2013. In February 2014 it was reported that there had been [...] "nearly 3,000 protest actions in the last 90 days - more than 30 a day- involving more than a million people".|$|R

5|$|Election Special is an American {{roots and}} blues rock album <b>of</b> <b>protest</b> songs with music {{characterized}} by upbeat melodies, simple instrumentation, and sparse arrangements. Cooder played {{all of the}} instruments, including bass, guitar, and mandolin, {{with the exception of}} drums by his son Joachim. A deeply political album, it expands on the socio-political musings and current event topics of Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Down with forthright, satirical lyrics and song-form vignettes. Cooder's songwriting exhibits liberal and populist sentiments and draws on older musical sources such as broadside ballads and country blues.|$|E
5|$|Facts were {{overwhelmed}} with sound, passion substituted for arithmetic, moral indignation pumped {{up to the}} bursting point. But Mr. Diefenbaker provided the liveliest show of the election... and many listeners undoubtedly failed to notice that he was saying even less than the Prime Minister, though saying it more shrilly and with evangelistic fervour... Mr. Diefenbaker has chosen instead to cast himself as the humble man in a mood <b>of</b> <b>protest,</b> the common Canadian outraged by Liberal prosperity, the little guy fighting for his rights.|$|E
5|$|Libby {{started the}} first Environmental Engineering program at UCLA in 1972. As {{a member of}} the California Air Resources Board, he worked to develop and improve California's air {{pollution}} standards. He established a research program to investigate heterogeneous catalysis with the idea of reducing emissions from motor vehicles through more complete fuel combustion. The election of Richard Nixon as president in 1968 generated speculation that Libby might be appointed as Presidential Science Advisor. There was a storm <b>of</b> <b>protest</b> from scientists who felt that Libby was too conservative, and the offer was not made.|$|E

5|$|On 26 June {{the agents}} {{returned}} {{to supervise the}} destruction of the promotional material, including 251 copies of Reich's books. The American Civil Liberties Union issued a press release criticizing the book burning, although coverage of the release was poor, and Reich ended up asking them not to help because he was annoyed that they had failed to criticize {{the destruction of the}} accumulators. In England A.S. Neill and the poet Herbert Read signed a letter <b>of</b> <b>protest,</b> but it was never published. On 23 July the remaining accumulators in New York were destroyed by S. A. Collins and Sons, who had built them.|$|E

Two quick wickets fell before Ponsford joined Woodfull in the middle, but having been struck by short balls several more times, Woodfull was bowled by Allen for 22, having batted {{for an hour and}} a half. When a doctor was publicly requested, to attend an injury to Voce, many in the crowd believed it was Woodfull who required assistance, leading to a renewal <b>of</b> <b>protest.</b> In later years, Woodfull's wife believed that his injury at Adelaide was partly responsible for his death aged 67 in 1965.|$|E
5|$|The Flag of Hong Kong between 1959 and 1997 was a Blue Ensign {{with the}} {{coat of arms}} of Hong Kong on a white disk. In Hong Kong, it is also nicknamed the Hong Kong flag (Chinese: 香港旗) or the Dragon and Lion flag (Chinese: 龍獅旗). In 1959, {{following}} {{a grant from the}} College of Arms and with the consent of Queen Elizabeth II, it was adopted as the flag of British Hong Kong. While the flag lost its official status following 1 July 1997 transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong, it resurfaced in the 2010s as a symbol <b>of</b> <b>protest</b> against Chinese intervention in Hong Kong.|$|E
5000|$|During the 2004/05 {{financial}} year about 6,000 protests were officially recorded, {{an unknown number}} <b>of</b> <b>protests</b> went unrecorded, and about 1,000 protests were illegally banned. This meant that at least 15 protests were taking place each day in South Africa at this time. However the number <b>of</b> <b>protests</b> has escalated dramatically since then and Business Day reports that [...] "2009 and 2010 together account for about two-thirds <b>of</b> all <b>protests</b> since 2004". There was a dramatic surge in protests shortly after Jacob Zuma first took office and the number <b>of</b> <b>protests</b> was ten times higher in 2009 than in 2004 and even higher in 2010. The number <b>of</b> <b>protests</b> reached an all-time high in 2010/2011 and then a further all time post-apartheid peak in July 2012 with more protests occurring in the Western Cape {{than in any other}} province and just under half <b>of</b> all <b>protests</b> occurring in shack settlements. In early 2013 it was reported that popular protest had reached its highest rate since the end of apartheid in 2012. In early 2013 it was argued that there have been as many as 3,000 protests in the last four years.|$|R
