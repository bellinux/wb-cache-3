50|$|John Dustin Archbold (July 26, 1848 in Leesburg, Ohio - December 6, 1916 in Tarrytown, New York) was an American {{capitalist}} {{and one of}} the United States' earliest oil refiners. His small {{oil company}} was bought out by John D Rockefeller's Standard Oil Company. Archbold rose rapidly at Standard <b>Oil,</b> <b>handling</b> many of the complex secret negotiations over the years. By 1882 he was Rockefeller's closest associate, and typically acted as the company's primary spokesman. Rockefeller after 1896 left business matters to Archbold while he pursued his philanthropy; as vice president Archbold effectively ran Standard Oil until his death in 1916. Inspired by Rockefeller's policies, Archbold's main goals were stabilization, efficiency, and minimizing waste in refining and distributing petroleum products. The company was broken up by the Supreme Court in 1911 into three dozen smaller operations, Archbold became president of the largest one, Standard Oil of New Jersey.|$|E

The same minister also introduce the Safe and Accountable Rail Act establishes minimum liability insurance levels for railway companies and creates a new compensation fund financed by shippers for use to cover damages from railway accidents. The Minister of Natural Resources's Energy Safety and Security Act and Pipeline Safety Act increases the no fault liability for companies involved in oil and gas pipelines and offshore oil facilities to $1-billion and unlimited liability if found at fault, as well as implements parts of the Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage.|$|E
40|$|The use {{of glass}} fiber {{reinforced}} Epoxy (GFRE) pipes for seawater and crude <b>oil</b> <b>handling</b> and transportation in Saudi Arabia is hindered {{by the lack}} of reliable engineering data on the durability of these pipes when exposed to harsh Arabian Gulf outdoor environment. This paper presents a study of the effects of natural outdoor weather and seawater on tensile and creep (stress rupture) behavior of GFRE materials. Exposure of seawater filled pipes to Saudi outdoor environment for periods ranging from 6 to 12 months has resulted in a drastic reduction of tensile and stress rupture strengths of the materials. Fractographic analysis of unexposed specimens showed a combination of mode I and mode II failure characterized by inclined hackles as well as large amount of fiber breakage. High temperature and moisture absorption decreased fiber-matrix interface strength and caused degradation at the fiber level resulting in lower strength and stiffness of the GFRE...|$|E

40|$|Owners or {{operators}} of certain <b>oil</b> <b>handling</b> facilities must prepare and {{submit to the}} US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or the US Coast Guard (USCG) a plan for responding to a possible worst case discharge of oil. Requirements for facility response plans (FRPs) {{have been part of}} EPA and USCG regulations since the early 1990 s. Based on the requirements of the 1995 Edible Oil Regulatory Reform Act (EORRA), EPA and the USCG worked together to publish amended regulations that differentiate among classes of oils. EPA’s FRP regulations require facilities to plan for up to three response scenarios: for small (2, 100 gallons or less), medium (2, 100 - 36, 000 gallons, or 10 % of the worst case discharge, whichever is less), and worst case discharges. As part of the June 2000 rulemaking, EPA gathered data about facilities and their response scenarios from FRPs submitted by facilities handling animal fats or vegetable oils. EPA used these data to characterize facilities according to the following criteria: the worst case discharge sizes; the planning methods for each response scenario; distribution geographically and by operating area; and industry classification. The results of this characterization may be used to improve preparedness efforts for FRP-regulated facilities and contribute to outreach initiatives by Federal and state agencies. ...|$|E
40|$|Smackover Field, {{discovered}} in 1922, {{is an excellent}} example of the methodology of heavy <b>oil</b> <b>handling</b> and loss in early 20 th century flush production fields. Emulsion problems and waste were severe; millions of barrels of heavy oil were stored in earthen pits for up to a decade, and millions of barrels of oil were lost to land and water. The largest quantity of crude oil waste was from the inadequate handling and treatment of water-in-oil emulsions. Crude oil loss was also associated with earthen storage both on leases and in large tank farms. Lease storage pits served numerous purposes and had the most complex fluid his-tory. Many were used for decades as saltwater disposal pits fol-lowing the flush oil period. Large earthen tank farms on the field edge stored millions of barrels of heavy oil in the 1920 s and 1930 s but were not used for saltwater storage. Today the farms exist within young forests where the ground is hardened by as-phaltic deposits associated with both earthen construction and seepage loss. Drainage areas also provide a record of the exten-sive waste oil history. Asphaltic layers are most prominent in creek areas that did not burn, but degraded oil exists to some ex-tent in almost all field drainage areas...|$|E
