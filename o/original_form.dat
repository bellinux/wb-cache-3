5|$|A third popular iteration-based method called MUSCLE (multiple {{sequence}} alignment by log-expectation) improves on progressive methods with a {{more accurate}} distance measure to assess the relatedness of two sequences. The distance measure is updated between iteration stages (although, in its <b>original</b> <b>form,</b> MUSCLE contained only 2-3 iterations depending on whether refinement was enabled).|$|E

5|$|A {{trend towards}} greater {{authenticity}} began after Hammond's orchestrations in the 1970s provided {{a basis for}} staging the work in its <b>original</b> <b>form.</b> This process was further aided by the discovery in the 1990s of Bizet's 1863 conducting score. In this, the orchestral parts were reduced to six staves, but notes and other markings in the manuscript provided additional clues to the original orchestration. These new finds {{became the basis for}} Brad Cohen's critical edition of the score, published by Edition Peters in 2002.|$|E

It is an Arabic music {{style that}} originates from Moorish Iberia or Al-Andalus, has been jealously preserved in its <b>original</b> <b>form</b> by Arab and Jewish musicians of the Maghreb over the centuries, and has left its mark on the cante flamenco, the flamenco singing style, perhaps better known in the West. The orchestra was awarded the Israel Prize in 2006.|$|E

5|$|M. l. lamberti is the {{nominate}} subspecies from coastal eastern Australia and the <b>original</b> <b>form</b> {{described by}} Vigors and Horsfield in 1827.

5|$|Modern {{cross-country}} skiing {{is similar to}} the <b>original</b> <b>form</b> of skiing, from which all skiing disciplines evolved, including alpine skiing, ski jumping and Telemark skiing. Skiers propel themselves either by striding forward (classic style) or side-to-side in a skating motion (skate skiing), aided by arms pushing on ski poles against the snow. It is practised in regions with snow-covered landscapes, including Northern Europe, Canada, Russia and regions in the United States.|$|E

5|$|The {{concept of}} {{coherence}} was only {{introduced into the}} metric system {{in the third quarter}} of the 19th century; in its <b>original</b> <b>form</b> the metric system was non-coherent—in particular the litre was 0.001m3 and the are (from which the hectare derives) was 100m2. However the units of mass and length were related to each other through the physical properties of water, the gram having been designed as being the mass of one cubic centimetre of water at its freezing point.|$|E
5|$|The {{legislation}} in its <b>original</b> <b>form</b> {{was sponsored by}} the Democratic Party, but after it ran into opposition, it was rescued by the conservative Republican Senator Barry Goldwater. Under Goldwater's sponsorship, a version of the legislation without the commitment provisions that were the target of intense opposition from a variety of far-right, anti-Communist and fringe religious groups was passed by the United States Senate. The controversy still plays a prominent role in the Church of Scientology's account of its campaign against psychiatry.|$|E
5|$|The most readily {{identified}} {{symbol of}} Texas Tech is the Double T. The logo, generally attributed to Texas Tech's first football coach, E. Y.

The new logo maintains the original premise, but incorporates three-dimensional beveling effects coupled with white trim.|$|E

5|$|After William's {{death the}} Historia was copied and {{circulated}} in the crusader states and was eventually brought to Europe. In the 13th century, James of Vitry {{had access to}} a copy while he was bishop of Acre, and it was used by Guy of Bazoches, Matthew Paris, and Roger of Wendover in their own chronicles. However, there are only ten known manuscripts that contain the Latin chronicle, all of which come from France and England, so William's work {{may not have been}} very widely read in its <b>original</b> <b>form.</b> In England, however, the Historia was expanded in Latin, with additional information from the Itinerarium Regis Ricardi, and the chronicle of Roger Hoveden; this version was written around 1220.|$|E
5|$|Building a {{complete}} deployment {{would have been}} extremely expensive, {{on the order of}} the total yearly budget of the Department of Defense. Robert McNamara, the Secretary of Defense, felt the cost could not be justified and worried it would lead to a further nuclear arms race. He directed the teams to consider deployments where a limited number of interceptors might still be militarily useful. Among these, the I-67 concept suggested building a lightweight defense against very limited attacks. When the People's Republic of China exploded their first H-bomb in 1967, I-67 was promoted as a defense against a Chinese attack, and this system became Sentinel in October. Nike-X development, in its <b>original</b> <b>form,</b> ended.|$|E
5|$|By the 1930s, Kraków had 120 officially {{registered}} synagogues {{and prayer}} houses that spanned across the old city. Much of Jewish intellectual life {{had moved to}} new centres like Podgórze. This in turn, led to the redevelopment and renovation of much of Kazimierz {{and the development of}} new districts in Kraków. Most historic buildings in central Kazimierz today are preserved in their <b>original</b> <b>form.</b> Some old buildings however, were not repaired after the devastation brought by the Second World War, and have remained empty. Most recent efforts at restoring the historic neighborhoods gained new impetus around 1993. Kazimierz is now a well-visited area, seeing a booming growth in Jewish-themed restaurants, bars, bookstores and souvenir shops.|$|E
