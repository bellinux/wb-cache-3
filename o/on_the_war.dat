5|$|As Reich Commissioner for the Consolidation of German Nationhood (RKFDV) {{with the}} {{incorporated}} VoMi Himmler was {{deeply involved in}} the Germanization program for the East, particularly Poland. As laid out in the General Plan for the East, the aim was to enslave, expel or exterminate the native population and to make Lebensraum ("living space") for Volksdeutsche (ethnic Germans). He continued his plans to colonise the east, even when many Germans were reluctant to relocate there, and despite negative effects <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> effort.|$|E

5|$|In {{the interim}} between the Import Duties Act and the Ottawa Conference, Chamberlain {{presented}} his first budget, in April 1932. The gold standard {{had been abandoned}} {{in the early days}} of the National Government; the Bank of England sought its restoration. Chamberlain, on advice from his officials, declined to restore the gold standard, realising that a devalued pound would improve the balance of trade. Otherwise, Chamberlain maintained the severe budget cuts that had been agreed to at the inception of the National Government: Chamberlain cut means-tested benefits and public sector wages, which proved to be an unpopular move. He also cut interest rates, which led to a house-building boom in the south of England and supported plans to clear slums. Interest <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> debt had been a major cost in each budget. Chamberlain was able to reduce the interest rate on most of Britain's war debt from 5% to 3.5%. Between 1932 and 1938, Chamberlain halved the percentage of the budget devoted to payment of interest <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> debt.|$|E

5|$|The Bush {{campaign}} advertised {{across the}} U.S. against Democratic candidates, including Bush's emerging opponent, Massachusetts Senator John Kerry. Kerry and other Democrats attacked Bush on the Iraq War, and {{accused him of}} failing {{to stimulate the economy}} and job growth. The Bush campaign portrayed Kerry as a staunch liberal who would raise taxes and increase the size of government. The Bush campaign continuously criticized Kerry's seemingly contradictory statements <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> in Iraq, and argued that Kerry lacked the decisiveness and vision necessary for success in the War on Terror.|$|E

5|$|The {{opposing}} armies met at {{the village}} of Albuera. Both sides suffered heavily in the ensuing struggle and the French finally withdrew on 18 May.

5|$|Æthelwold or Æthelwald (died 902 or 903) was {{the younger}} of two known sons of Æthelred I, King of Wessex from 865 to 871. Because Æthelwold ætheling {{and his brother}} were still infants when their father the king died while {{fighting}} a Danish Viking invasion, the throne passed to the king's younger brother (and Æthelwold's uncle) Alfred the Great, who carried <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> against the Vikings and won a crucial victory at the Battle of Edington in 878.|$|E
5|$|Beyond {{these initial}} prosecutions, the ecclesia {{attacked}} Pericles himself by {{asking him to}} justify his ostensible profligacy with, and maladministration of, public money. According to Plutarch, Pericles was so afraid of the oncoming trial {{that he did not}} let the Athenians yield to the Lacedaemonians. Beloch also believes that Pericles deliberately brought <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> to protect his political position at home. Thus, {{at the start of the}} Peloponnesian War, Athens found itself in the awkward position of entrusting its future to a leader whose pre-eminence had just been seriously shaken for the first time in over a decade.|$|E
5|$|Duhalde was {{appointed}} {{president in the}} aftermath of the September 11 attacks, when the foreign policy of the United States was strictly focused <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> on Terror. Initially, the Argentine society was divided on how to manage the bilateral relations with the US. One group wanted to keep the close relations of the previous decade, as Argentina might need foreign help to deal with the crisis. The other group preferred to maintain more distant relations. Duhalde sought to strike a balance between both options, and eventually leaned towards the second when the US refused to help Argentina.|$|E

5|$|During World War II, the Main Roads Department focused its {{activities}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> effort. Roads {{in rural areas}} deteriorated, especially after the Pearl Harbour attack brought the war to the Pacific, and only the most urgent maintenance works were authorised on roads for civilian purposes. Following the war, Main Roads returned to its usual operations, repairing and maintaining the road network. The rural road network expanded in the 1950s, with Main Roads both repairing the worst segments of its roads, through numerous small jobs, and assisting local governments to seal their roads. Such activity was spurred on by the closure of railway lines {{in addition to the}} establishment of new land settlements.|$|E
5|$|During this period, royalist forces made {{advances}} into New Granada, {{which they}} controlled from 1815 to 1819, and into Chile, which they controlled from 1814 to 1817. Except for royalist {{areas in the}} northeast and south, the provinces of New Granada had maintained independence from Spain since 1810, unlike neighboring Venezuela, where royalists and pro-independence forces had exchanged control of the region several times. To pacify Venezuela and to retake New Granada, Spain organized in 1815 the largest armed force it ever sent to the New World, consisting of 10,500 troops and nearly sixty ships. (See, Spanish reconquest of New Granada.) Although this force was crucial in retaking a solidly pro-independence region like New Granada, its soldiers were eventually spread out throughout Venezuela, New Granada, Quito, and Peru and were lost to tropical diseases, diluting their impact <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>war.</b> More importantly, the majority of the royalist forces were composed, not of soldiers sent from the peninsula, but of Spanish Americans.|$|E
