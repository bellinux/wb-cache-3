He also criticized the lack of extra content, but complimented the DVD's sound. Jacobson gave the release's image, sound and extras ratings of D+, A-, D, respectively. Aaron Beriele from DVD Talk website shared Jacobson's views, saying that it was [...] "a wonderful show from Madonna and I can <b>only</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> it was like to actually be there. As for the DVD, it offers outstanding audio quality, but only so-so image quality. Still, it's a terrific show and the DVD still certainly gets a recommendation." ...|$|E
500|$|Nick is {{described}} by the soap opera's official website as often thinking [...] "with his heart instead of his head". When the teenaged version of Nick debuted on the series in 1994, he was characterized as a [...] "frisky" [...] 16-year-old [...] "rich-kid", with Morrow being able to [...] "kick back and relax in typical teenager attire—jeans, tees, etc". Morrow said [...] "Nick's eager and fun-loving ... and that's fun to play". Nick also has an [...] "eye for the ladies". In 1999, Morrow told soap magazine Soap Opera Digest that Nick has a [...] "fiery personality", and [...] "if you attack him, he's going to fight back". Morrow has insisted {{that he is not}} concerned about viewer backlash towards Nick, having stated: [...] "My job is not to be palatable to the audience. I want to tell a convincing story. I have never been a man in love with two women. I can <b>only</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> that must be like." [...] The actor felt that if he needed to [...] "look like an ass and a bad guy" [...] to keep people interested in his portrayal, [...] "so be it". He told Tommy Garrett of Canyon News: [...] "I’d rather be playing an imperfect good guy than a boring one. There is a lot of me in Nick, there is not that big of a stretch for me on a daily basis". A controversial storyline occurred in 2011 when alongside his sisters Abby Newman (Marcy Rylan) and Victoria Abbott (Amelia Heinle), Nick sued his father. Morrow felt that Nick wants to teach Victor a lesson, hoping he will [...] "appreciate his children more". He also stated Nick wants to get respect, as he isn't [...] "this young and impressionable boy who looks at his father in this hero light anymore." [...] By the following year, Morrow opined that Nick is now [...] "more mature" [...] with his decision-making, and that [...] "He's got a very practical view of the world, and I like that he's kind of become a steady character on the show". He stated that although the part isn't as [...] "splashy or flashy" [...] as Adam Newman (Michael Muhney), Nick's onscreen brother, he [...] "really" [...] likes Nick because [...] "he's a good dude" [...] and a [...] "very supportive" [...] person.|$|E
2500|$|The {{government}} itself {{agreed that the}} private sector contributes about 90 per cent to the nation's Gross Domestic Product. With SMEs forming about 65 per cent of the private sector operations, one can <b>only</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> the effects of the new move by the bank will be on the economy." [...] Banks in the country, for along time, {{had been part of the}} problem of the real sector, saying they would rather get involved in round-tripping and short-term lending for commercial activities, than to lend to businesses with manufacturing operations. It is in this light that the new twist is commendable of emulation by other banks. First, through its current GMD, has shown an unusual disposition to the plight of small scale industrialists. I think he deserves all the kudos." ...|$|E

5000|$|Twin Forks is {{the first}} EP from American band Twin Forks, {{released}} on September 17, 2013, through Dine Alone Records. The EP received positive reviews [...] "For better or worse, it’s evident {{that this is just}} the beginning for Twin Forks, but if this is what they’re producing straight out of the gate we can <b>only</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>what’s</b> to come. We want and need more. Like, now." ...|$|R

2500|$|Cornell {{stated in}} a 1996 interview: [...] "I {{know what it}} feels like to be suicidal, and I {{know what it feels}} like to be hopeless. There is some point where I learnt enough about myself to know that I don't have the {{tolerance}} to create other hurdles as well." [...] In 1999, Cornell said about depression, [...] "No one really knows what run-of-the-mill depression is. You'll think somebody has run-of-the-mill depression, and then the next thing you know, they're hanging from a rope. It's hard to tell the difference. But I do feel that depression can be useful. Sometimes it's just chemical. It doesn't seem to come from anywhere. And whenever I've been in any kind of depression, I've over the years tried to not <b>only</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> it feels like to not be there, but try to remind myself that I could just wake up the next day and it could be gone because that happens, and not to worry about it. And at the same time, when I'm feeling great, I remember the depression and think about the differences in what I'm feeling and why I would feel that way, and not be reactionary one way or the other. You just have to realize that these are patterns of life and you just go through them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Theisen placed {{second at}} the Canadian Track and Field Championships {{and went on}} to finish {{eleventh}} in the heptathlon at the 2012 London Olympics. A score of 6376 points at the 2013 Hypo Meeting was enough to win the high-profile event ahead of Tatyana Chernova, and she formed a rare Canadian combined events double alongside the men's winner Damian Warner. The 2013 World Championships in Athletics was a wide open event in the heptathlon in that two of the world's best competitors in Chernova and Jessica Ennis-Hill both missed the competition as a result of injuries. Despite putting up a personal best 6,530 points, she had to settle for silver, just 56 points behind eventual World Champion Hanna Melnichenko. After Gotzis, this was the second major competition in a row where the Canadian men and women multi-eventers had a double medal meeting after Warner won bronze at the world championships; however, a double gold for the power couple of Eaton and Eaton-Theisen was narrowly missed. She commented on her achievement saying [...] "I'm at peace getting silver knowing I gave it 110 per cent. Ashton and I talked about both being on the podium here. I watched Ashton {{the last couple of years}} winning his medals and could <b>only</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> that actually felt like." [...] In her last outing that year, she was third at the Decastar meet in France.|$|E
2500|$|At times, various vice Rectors of the Josephinum (the apostolic {{delegate}} to the United States was the nominal rector) would feel under the gun {{to clamp down on}} the student's access to [...] "worldly literature." [...] One such episode occurred after a visit of Bishop Joseph Mark McShea of Allentown, PA that led to a new vice Rector, Ralph Thompson, and some strict new rules, among them a [...] "book policy" [...] that limited what students could read. [...] Beyond spiritual and classroom books, students had to have a permission slip signed by a professor for any book in their college rooms. [...] One college student went to see Fick and asked him to sign a slip for John Dos Passos' trilogy [...] "USA" [...] and with great sadness Fick told him that while he was greatly pleased that this student wanted to read such a great work of American literature in three volumes, he didn't want his signature on a permission slip for such an author given the repressive atmosphere then in place at the Josephinum. [...] Fick sadly told the student to wait until summer, buy the book and read it during the vacation period. [...] Former Fick students who appreciated Fick's love of literature can <b>only</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> it took out of him to thus deny a student who wanted to read a good book. [...] This experience in censorship and mild repression had a profound influence on some students who never forgot what a powerful institution can do to an individual's spirit and went on to fight various institutions throughout their lives remembering Fick's resignation to powers over which a young English teacher had little influence.|$|E
5000|$|In Adrift in Manhattan, Graham's {{character}} Rose becomes paralyzed {{when she}} hears {{the death of her}} two-year-old son. In preparing for her role, Graham not <b>only</b> <b>imagined</b> <b>what</b> it would be like for the character to experience the death of her toddler but was also actually depressed due to circumstances in her own personal life. Rasuk said that when he first looked at the screenplay for his character, Simon, {{he wanted to make sure}} that [...] "every scene and every moment was really real." [...] He also claimed he was affected by a man older than he who had experienced depression in his life, which helped him prepare for his role.|$|R
60|$|The third spring came, and our boy was born. We {{thought we}} had been happy before; now {{we knew that we}} had only dreamed a {{pleasant}} dream of happiness, and had awakened to this exquisite reality. We {{thought we had}} loved each other before; now, as I looked into my wife's pale face, blanched with its baptism of pain, and met the uplifted gaze of her blue eyes, aglow with the holy passion of motherhood, I knew we had <b>only</b> <b>imagined</b> <b>what</b> love might be. The imagination had been sweet, as the thought of the rose is sweet before the bud is open; but as the rose to the thought, so was love to the imagination of it.|$|R
5000|$|Zeba of Two Cents TV gave a good {{review to}} the episode {{saying that it}} got more {{sinister}} than the last. About the ending she states that the final exchange [...] "manages to take this episode from an [...] "eh" [...] to an [...] "OH SNAP."" [...] and she comments: [...] "Did you see that coming? I must say I was thoroughly delighted by this new development. We’ve seen vampire shows where the vampire world is either very much out there (a la True Blood), or very underground. I can <b>only</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>what’s</b> in store for this series if some sort of witch hunt goes down. A show is always more interesting when there’s more than one threat for the characters to deal with." ...|$|R

60|$|This was {{a dreadful}} commencement, but she bore it, and even was {{relieved}} by it. Indeed, no tale that Mr. Furnival could {{have to tell}} after such an exordium would be so bad as that which she had feared as the possible result of his visit. He might have come there {{to let her know}} that she was at once to be carried away--immediately to be taken to her trial--perhaps to be locked up in gaol. In her ignorance of the law she could <b>only</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> might or might not happen to her at any moment, and therefore the words which Sir Peregrine had spoken relieved her rather than added to her fears.|$|E

50|$|It can <b>only</b> be <b>imagined</b> <b>what</b> the {{two former}} volumes of Pace’s trilogy dealt with. However, if the third extant volume is {{anything}} {{to go by}} with, {{they must have been}} enormously interesting from a philosophical point of view. Not only as regards content but surely also as regards intensity, extensiveness and depth. Especially if they dealt with metaphysics and logic.|$|R
5000|$|A {{writer for}} the gay blog and news website AfterElton.com {{expressed}} his shock at the scene featuring Brendan hitting Ste and also called the story [...] "compelling". He said, [...] "I must say that even though I've been following this storyline since it began, and I knew what was coming, seeing Brendan hit Ste was quite shocking… and the storyline is just beginning. The show has said it's {{going to be a}} dark, long-running story arc so I can <b>only</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>what's</b> ahead. I admit that I find the storyline quite compelling, and I've been drawn into it. While some people have seen this as a romance, it's never played that way to me. Ste and Brendan's scenes do have an element of sexual allure since the actors have chemistry, but there's too much darkness and manipulation on the edges of every scene to make real romance even possible. He also gave credit to the show for its slow build up over a few months.|$|R
2500|$|Whether Nicola Pisano {{learned his}} {{appreciation}} of neo-classicism in Frederick II’s workshop {{or whether he}} picked up inspiration from the ruins of Roman sculpture that were strewn about Pisa during that time period one can <b>only</b> <b>imagine,</b> but <b>what</b> is known is that Nicola mastered the combination of Christian traditions such as the Narrative of Christ {{with the use of}} Roman and Late Antique style. With the similar pulpit in Pisa being finished in 1260 and this Siena pulpit being completed in 1268 {{it can be seen that}} Nicola embraced the Classic revival before any of those deemed “Renaissance Artists” ...|$|R

2500|$|Unlike some of {{the smaller}} {{adjustments}} though, the flying sequence required extensive preparation. Iñárritu spent three weeks with Halon Entertainment to previsualize the sequence. In New York, Lubezki then used the choreography of the previsualization to shoot background plates for the sequence, using a camera crane on a truck. When these were shot, Lubezki had mounted four GoPro cameras to the lens of the film camera to capture the light environment around him. Later, on a greenstage in Montreal, using a technique he had developed on Gravity, Lubezki lit Keaton with LED panels featuring high-dynamic-range images of the surrounding New York footage. The panels then realistically lit Keaton. Khanikian described the effect of the process, saying [...] "instead of using standard lighting on greenscreen [...] the proper red bounce from the red bricks and the same color of the sky reflected on Michael's head. It worked so well." [...] Rodeo FX then completed the final shots. The sequence was the last piece the editors inserted into the film. Mirrone commented that before the sequence was finished they [...] "had <b>only</b> <b>imagined</b> <b>what</b> it was going to feel like", but once it was completed [...] "it took the movie to this ecstatic level that absolutely blew me away." ...|$|R
50|$|The Danish Girl, as Ebershoff stated, {{does not}} try to tell a true story. He has not <b>only</b> <b>imagined</b> most of <b>what</b> he wrote about Elbe's inner life, but he has also {{fabricated}} {{all of the other}} characters in the book, most important among them Wegener's blue-blooded American-born wife, Greta Waud, who like Ebershoff comes from Pasadena, California. The real Gerda Wegener was Danish, but in the novel her name was changed to Greta to please the American audience.|$|R
5000|$|The film {{is based}} on the novel The Danish Girl by David Ebershoff. The novel, as Ebershoff has stated, does not try to tell a true story. He not <b>only</b> <b>imagined</b> most of <b>what</b> he wrote about Elbe's inner life, but also created all of the other {{characters}} in the book, such as Hans and Henrik, both characters present in the film. Despite many inaccuracies, the film was marketed as a [...] "true story" [...] and [...] "a true love story". Director Tom Hooper stated that the film is closer to the real story than Ebershoff's book.|$|R
5000|$|Allmusic {{awarded the}} album 4½ stars stating [...] "Burrell's initial {{plan was to}} release a volume in tribute to Ellington once a year, but this record {{and the one that}} preceded it were the only two albums in this {{proposed}} series that were ever made.

50|$|War Music has {{duration}} of roughly 25 minutes and is composed in two movements. The first movement reflects {{the violence of}} the war, while the second is cast as memorial for those lost. Thus, the second movement features less of the orchestral instruments and the addition of the choir. Ledger described the composition process in the score program notes, writing: I was humbled on many occasions on writing a piece that commemorates those who were confronted by such a terrifying experience - I could <b>only</b> begin to <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> it would have been like in reality. This produced the profound difficulty of trying to express the suffering and tragedy of war in purely musical terms. And added to this are the complexities of the myths and legends that surround the Gallipoli story. I therefore concentrated on the more broader aspects of war, hence the title. The text was written by the Australian musician Paul Kelly during an otherwise inactive year and takes the perspective of the soldiers at Gallipoli.|$|R

[...] However, The Hammer Vampire: British Cult Cinema by Bruce G Hallenbeck, says that [...] "there is much to recommend it.

The album features performances by Taylor with Archie Shepp, Buell Neidlinger, Denis Charles and Sunny Murray on alternate takes of material released on The World of Cecil Taylor (1960). The Allmusic review by Brian Olewnick states [...] "One can <b>only</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> {{the reaction of}} the average jazz fan was in 1960 when this session was recorded. This is a wonderful document from early in Taylor's career, when he was midway between modernist approaches to standard material and his own radical experiments that would come to full fruition a few years hence...
