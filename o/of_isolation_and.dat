5|$|Fishing {{and tourism}} {{now account for}} much of the area's economy. The rugged natural scenery, sense <b>of</b> <b>isolation,</b> <b>and</b> natural attractions such as Cathedral Caves makes the Catlins a popular {{destination}} for weekend trips by people from Dunedin and Invercargill, the two nearest cities. A large number of cribs (holiday cottages) occur at places such as Jack's Bay and Pounawea. Ecotourism is becoming increasingly important to the area's economy, with many of the visitors coming from overseas. Tourism added an estimated $2.4 million to the region's economy in 2003.|$|E
5|$|In 1853 Commodore Matthew Perry led the Perry Expedition, a {{squadron}} of four ships which sailed to Japan to establish normal relations with Japan. Perry's two technologically advanced steam-powered ships and calm, firm diplomacy convinced Japan to end three centuries <b>of</b> <b>isolation</b> <b>and</b> sign Treaty of Kanagawa with the U.S. in 1854. Nominally a treaty of friendship, the agreement soon {{paved the way for}} the opening of Japan and normal trade relations with the United States and Europe.|$|E
5|$|The postwar climate sees {{a period}} of {{austerity}} and mistrust towards the machines. Returning from {{the horrors of the}} war, Marke becomes the Consul of Berlin and instates a reign <b>of</b> <b>isolation</b> <b>and</b> deurbanization. Advanced weapons are destroyed, people are driven out into the countryside to cultivate the land, and the giant energy accumulators are destroyed. Columns made to look like bulls are erected in city squares and at crossroads, and roar twice a day like a dying animal to remind people of the catastrophe of the Ural War. Marduk succeeds Marke as the Consul and continues the period of brutal authoritarian rule.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{being set}} in space, the film uses motifs from {{shipwreck}} and wilderness survival stories about psychological change and resilience {{in the aftermath}} of a catastrophe. Cuarón uses the character, Stone, to illustrate clarity of mind, persistence, training, and improvisation in the face <b>of</b> <b>isolation</b> <b>and</b> the consequences of a relentless Murphy's law. The film incorporates spiritual or existential themes, in the facts of Stone's daughter's accidental and meaningless death, and in the necessity of summoning the will to survive in the face of overwhelming odds, without future certainties, and with the impossibility of rescue from personal dissolution without finding this willpower. Calamities occur but only the surviving astronauts see them.|$|E
5|$|In 1945 Döblin's 18-year-old son Stefan {{was called}} up for {{military}} service in the French army. That spring had brought the good news that Klaus was alive and in Switzerland after a period working for the French resistance, and the grim tidings that Wolfgang was dead, having committed suicide five years earlier. In October 1945 Alfred and Erna arrived in New York, sailing aboard the Argentine back to Europe. They first settled in Baden-Baden, where Döblin worked for the French military government as official representative {{for the office of}} public education; he was tasked with approving manuscripts for publication, and vehemently opposed the approval of any texts by authors who had sympathized with National Socialism, such as Ernst Jünger or Gottfried Benn. In postwar Germany's conservative cultural climate, Döblin was unable to draw on his earlier success as an author, yet continued his literary engagement with a series of publications and journals that aimed to rebuild Germany's intellectual and cultural life, reintroducing the literature banned by the Nazis and fostering the growth of younger writers. Despite these efforts, Döblin was disappointed by the apparent continuity between the Nazi years and the postwar climate. His growing pessimism was fueled by his sense <b>of</b> <b>isolation</b> <b>and</b> marginalization within the postwar German literary scene. In 1953 Alfred and Erna returned to Paris despite the invitation by Brecht and Johannes R. Becher to settle in East Berlin.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: In this paper, the {{concepts}} <b>of</b> social <b>isolation</b> <b>and</b> loneliness will be explored {{in relation to}} people with chronic musculoskeletal pain. Through this, biological, psychological and social factors will be examined to consider how we can identified people at risk <b>of</b> social <b>isolation</b> <b>and</b> loneliness who have chronic musculoskeletal pain and secondly how health professionals may intervene to reduce their effects. Design/methodology/approach: Conceptual paper. Findings: Social <b>isolation</b> <b>and</b> loneliness is evident in people with chronic musculoskeletal diseases. This may be bi-directional where both pain may lead to social <b>isolation</b> <b>and</b> loneliness, or social <b>isolation</b> <b>and</b> loneliness may exacerbate pain. Interventions to improve the symptoms of chronic musculoskeletal pain, and approaches around social participation and engagement should be adopted in combination to ameliorate this potentially disabling scenario. Originality/value: There remains limited evidence around the prevalence <b>and</b> management <b>of</b> social <b>isolation</b> <b>and</b> loneliness for people with chronic musculoskeletal pain. By raising awareness <b>of</b> social <b>isolation</b> <b>and</b> loneliness in this population, people with chronic musculoskeletal pain may be better supported to reduce the negative impact that social <b>isolation</b> <b>and</b> loneliness can have on their health and well-being...|$|R

25|$|The {{central part}} of the Coniston range can be likened to an {{inverted}} 'Y' with Brim Fell at the connecting point of the three arms. The main spine of the ridge runs north over Swirl How and Great Carrs and south west to Dow Crag and the lower hills beyond. The third arm is a truncated spur, running only half a mile to the summit of the Old Man before tumbling away south eastward to the valley floor. This ridge end position gives the fell a sense <b>of</b> <b>isolation</b> <b>and</b> increased stature, with steep faces on three sides.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} family {{guidelines}} and agreements, corporate policies exclusively refer to marriages among {{women and men}} and thereby disregard the situation and {{the special needs of}} non-traditional families. These non-traditional families often consist of couples or individuals with lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender (LGBT) backgrounds that are increasingly under pressure of the community, as their needs within corporations are often paid inadequate attention. Exclusive behavior such as creating environments that do not encourage LGBTs to disclose their sexual orientation, or even neglecting the fact that LGBT are allowed to adopt children, leads to a feeling <b>of</b> <b>isolation</b> <b>and</b> job stress that ultimately negatively effects the WLB of the affected individuals.|$|E

25|$|Stigma {{has been}} {{associated}} with HIV in Jamaica {{since the beginning of the}} epidemic, partly because of its association with male homosexuality. Jamaican men, in particular, are so concerned about being associated with homosexuality that they are hesitant to seek HIV treatment and prevention services. Poor men living with HIV are assumed to have participated in same-sex sexual acts, and poor men who participate in those acts are assumed to be HIV positive. Some people in Jamaica become suicidal when they first receive their HIV diagnosis, rooted in the fear <b>of</b> <b>isolation</b> <b>and</b> discrimination that will result from others finding out and not from the potential of death associated with it. HIV is a reportable disease, resulting in a visit by a contact investigator who asks for the names of sexual partners.|$|E

40|$|Purpose; This paper aims {{to discuss}} whether the level <b>of</b> social <b>isolation</b> <b>and</b> {{loneliness}} as assessed by care managers {{corresponds to the}} level <b>of</b> social <b>isolation</b> <b>and</b> loneliness as perceived by the older persons whose care needs are being assessed. Design/methodology/approach This mixed methods study followed up the assessment of 40 older people by 20 care managers {{with a focus on}} the accuracy of the care manager’s assessment on the level <b>of</b> social <b>isolation</b> experienced by the service user. In order for this to be achieved structured interviews were conducted with both the older person and the care manager assessing their needs, with a specific focus on the assessment <b>of</b> loneliness <b>and</b> social <b>isolation.</b> Following these initial interviews two focus groups were then undertaken with the care manager to discuss the findings and unpack the assessment process. Findings The key issues were that the true level <b>of</b> social <b>isolation</b> <b>and</b> loneliness was under assessed by the care manager completing the assessment. That the care manager’s assessment was predominantly focused on the physical well-being of the older person and heavily influenced by the assessment paperwork. Originality/value This provides lessons for professionals about the lack of effectiveness of their assessment <b>of</b> social <b>isolation</b> <b>and</b> loneliness in older people, and the potential impact this has on the older person’s quality of life...|$|R

25|$|Throughout 1942 {{and into}} early 1943, a complex series of {{overlapping}} crises placed enormous, widespread stress on Bengal's economy, particularly on its more vulnerable segments. Distressing {{military and political}} events and subsequent government and market responses created escalating price shocks that overlapped with supply shocks caused by natural disasters and plant disease later in the year. As Bengal's food needs rose from increased military presence and an influx of refugees from Burma, its ability to obtain rice and other foodgrains from outside the province was restricted by interprovincial trade barriers. The outlook of the typical Bengali, particularly in the countryside, deteriorated into a general belief in the inevitability of famine and devastating inflation, a lack {{of faith in the}} government's ability to overcome the crises, and a mood <b>of</b> <b>isolation</b> <b>and</b> panic. In nearly every sector of the population, the overriding concerns were the lack of food and personal safety, though a small number secured record profits amidst the havoc.|$|E

40|$|An {{innovative}} hybrid control {{building system}} <b>of</b> multiple <b>isolation</b> <b>and</b> connection is proposed and investigated using both time history and input energy responses for {{various types of}} ground motions together with transfer functions.

In order to enhance the seismic performance of those base-isolated buildings, a novel hybrid system <b>of</b> multiple <b>isolation</b> <b>and</b> building connection is proposed and compared with other structural systems such as an independent multiple isolation system, a hybrid system <b>of</b> base <b>isolation</b> <b>and</b> building connection. Furthermore, the robustness of seismic responses of the proposed hybrid system for various types of ground motion is discussed through the comparison of various structural systems including non-hybrid systems.
