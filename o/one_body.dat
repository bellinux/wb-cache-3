25|$|An out-of-body {{experience}} (OBE or sometimes OOBE) {{is an experience}} that typically involves a feeling of floating outside <b>one's</b> <b>body</b> and, in some cases, the feeling of perceiving <b>one's</b> physical <b>body</b> {{as if from a}} place outside <b>one's</b> <b>body</b> (autoscopy).|$|R

5|$|Newton's Third Law is {{a result}} of {{applying}} symmetry to situations where forces {{can be attributed to the}} presence of different objects.

Thus, while the reform epitomised by the Bill of Middlesex aided the King's Bench in the short term, it eventually led to its dissolution.|$|E

5|$|Another legend {{from the}} Linga Purana {{says that the}} {{embracing}} of love-struck Shiva and Mohini led to be their merging into <b>one</b> <b>body.</b> At this moment, Mohini became Vishnu again, resulting the composite deity Harihara, whose {{right side of the}} body is Shiva and left side is Vishnu in his male form. In the temple in Sankarnayinarkovil near Kalugumalai is one of the rarest exceptions to iconography of Harihara (Sankara-Narayana). The deity is depicted similar to the Ardhanari, the composite form of Shiva-Parvati, where right side of the body is the male Shiva and left side is female. This image's female side represents Mohini and it, as a whole, symbolizes the union of Shiva and Mohini. The influence of Shakta traditions on Shaiva ones may have {{led to the development of}} composite images like Harihara, where Vishnu is identified with Shiva's consort, or Mohini. Like the Kanda Puranam narrative, the Shaiva saint Appar identifies Vishnu as Parvati (Uma), the female counterpart of Shiva.|$|E
5|$|Both {{monitors}} were reclassified as coast-defense ironclads on 13 February 1892 and Rusalka sank in a {{storm on}} 7 September 1893 during a voyage between Reval (Tallinn) and Helsingfors (Helsinki) {{with the loss of}} her entire crew of 177 officers and enlisted men. Despite an extensive search, the only traces of her found were <b>one</b> <b>body</b> and some debris that washed ashore. Charodeika remained in service until 31 March 1907 when she was turned over to the Port of Kronstadt for disposal. The ship was stricken from the Navy List on 7 April and was finally scrapped in 1911–12.|$|E
5|$|In Clear Lake City, heavy {{rainfall}} collapsed {{a portion of}} a grocery store roof, killing two workers. The precipitation caused moderate flooding across eastern portions of Harris County; over 400homes and 40businesses were flooded. Flooding across the Greater Houston area briefly halted the METRORail and closed several state roads. One person drowned after driving into a retention pond. Several people required rescue assistance, and in Comal County a car accident caused three fatalities. The passage of the storm temporarily left about 20,000electrical customers without power, though most outages were quickly restored. In San Antonio, <b>one</b> <b>body</b> was recovered from a creek and another died after driving into a flooded road and was swept into a drainage ditch in which four others survived. In Sisterdale, two people were killed when they were swept away stalled over Sister Creek. In Taylor County, near Abilene, flooding killed one person and forced the evacuation of about 2,000people. Damage in Texas totaled over $45million (2007USD).|$|E

5|$|Nineteen {{bodies were}} burned beyond recognition, {{but none of}} them {{appeared}} to be women or children, according to Pakistani officials. An article in The Nation, cited a grave digger at the cemetery where the bodies were being buried, who claimed there was the possibility {{that there may have been}} more than <b>one</b> <b>body</b> in each coffin. The article also stated that the government was digging more graves than previously established. The Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, a coalition of hard-line religious parties, claimed that between 400 and 1,000 students had been killed, along with women and children. Spanish-language news channels Univision, Antena 3, and Telecinco claimed that the total number of deaths in the siege was greater than 286 and could be as high as 300.|$|E
5|$|The Act, finally {{passed as}} the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873, merged the Common Pleas, Exchequer, King's Bench and Court of Chancery into <b>one</b> <b>body,</b> the High Court of Justice, with the {{divisions}} between {{the courts to}} remain. The Court of Common Pleas thus ceased to exist, except as the Common Pleas Division of the High Court. The existence of the same courts under one unified head was a quirk of constitutional law, which prevented the compulsory demotion or retirement of Chief Justices. By sheer chance, both the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales and Chief Baron of the Exchequer died in 1880, allowing for {{the abolition of the}} Common Pleas Division and Exchequer Division by Order in Council on 16 December 1880, with their functions merged into the King's Bench Division, with the Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas becoming Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales.|$|E

5|$|The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) medical {{examiners}} identified {{most of the}} bodies within 10 weeks of the accident. Due to extreme impact forces only <b>one</b> <b>body</b> was identifiable by sight. For approximately 100 bodies, the examiners used DNA; the DNA analysis {{has been referred to}} as the largest DNA identification project in Canadian history. About 90 bodies were identified by Canadian {{medical examiners}} using dental records. For around 30 bodies, examiners used fingerprints and ante mortem (before death) X-rays. The large number of ante mortem dental X-rays meant that around 90 bodies had been identified by the end of October. The RCMP contacted relatives of victims to ask for medical histories and dental records. Blood samples from relatives were used in the DNA identification of victims.|$|E
5|$|The Watcher and {{his companions}} pursue Thaos {{to the city of}} Twin Elms, where they finally learn the truth behind Thaos' actions. The gods are {{synthetic}} beings created by ancient animancers to serve as a civilizing force for the world, which doesn't have any real gods. Thaos is the last survivor of their order, and has survived the centuries by transferring his soul from <b>one</b> <b>body</b> to the next. His eternal mission is to ensure that no one discovers the gods' secret, because then mortals would question their divine authority, and the world could then regress into sectarianism and barbarism. To this end, he works to discredit and suppress animancy wherever it flourishes, because modern animancers may eventually discover the truth through their science. He stole the souls of the Hollowborn to empower the goddess Woedica, who hates animancy and would see it destroyed. Though the other gods have an interest in protecting their secret, they do not want Woedica to dominate them, and so they help the Watcher reach Thaos.|$|E
5|$|When {{registration}} commenced on October 16, 1940, no {{structure was}} in place to handle thousands of anticipated conscientious objectors. Church representatives meeting with government officials learned that little thought had been put into the program, and the churches were advised to create a plan. Because the government wanted to deal with <b>one</b> <b>body,</b> not individual religious denominations, the National Council for Religious Conscientious Objectors was formed as a liaison between the churches and the federal government. The historic peace churches outlined a plan that included running and maintaining CPS camps under church control. However, President Roosevelt opposed any plan not involving military control over the draftees. To save their plan and retain civilian direction of the program, the churches offered to fund the camps. Aides convinced Roosevelt that putting the COs to work in out-of-the-way camps was preferable to repeating the difficulties of World War I. Selective Service and the peace churches agreed to a six-month trial of church supported and funded camps for conscientious objectors and thus Civilian Public Service was born.|$|E

40|$|We {{constantly}} feel, see {{and move}} our body, {{and have no}} doubt that it is our own. The brain possesses a distinction between the body and the objects in the outside world. This distinction may be based on a process that monitors whether sensations, events and objects should be attributed to <b>one's</b> <b>body</b> or not. We controlled whether an external object was represented as part of the body or not, by experimentally inducing a bodily illusion using correlated visual and tactile stimulation. We then studied the role of right temporo-parietal junction (rTPJ) in the processing of multisensory events {{that may or may not}} be attributed to <b>one's</b> <b>body.</b> Disruption of rTPJ using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) made the distinction between what may or may not be part of <b>one's</b> <b>body</b> on the basis of multisensory evidence more ambiguous, suggesting that the rTPJ is actively involved in maintaining a coherent sense of <b>one's</b> <b>body,</b> distinct from external, non-corporeal, objects...|$|R
