50|$|Besides its {{compelling}} literary content, Pahal is also {{famous for}} the booklets that it publishes (besides the issues) from time to time--often featuring the works of a prominent foreign author, long poems and debates on topics of socio-political significance. Past booklets have introduced readers in India, often for the first time, to the works <b>of</b> <b>such</b> stalwarts <b>of</b> <b>world</b> <b>literature</b> as Miroslav Holub, Afzal Ahmed Sayyed and Edward Said. A recent booklet focuses on poetry from the North-eastern states of India, {{often referred to as}} the Seven Sisters.|$|R

40|$|We often {{deal with}} dynamic worlds where actions are {{executed}} by agents and events may happen. Example <b>of</b> <b>such</b> <b>worlds</b> range from virtual <b>worlds</b> <b>such</b> as the <b>world</b> <b>of</b> a database to robots and humans in physical worlds. To understand the dynamics <b>of</b> <b>such</b> <b>worlds</b> {{as well as}} to be able to assert some control over <b>such</b> <b>worlds</b> one needs to reason about the actions and events and how they may change the world. In this invited talk we will present some of the important results in this field and present some future directions. In particular, we will discuss how theories and results from reasoning about actions and change can be combined with theories and results in dynamic epistemic logics to obtain a unified theory of multi-agent actions. Actions when executed often change the state of th...|$|R

A number <b>of</b> <b>such</b> <b>worlds</b> are known to exist, but the eccentricity of this planet is unusually high.

Their association with autoimmune thyroid diseases has been reported by few authors; however, a sequential development of the Evans syndrome in cases of Hashimoto′s thyroiditis is extremely rare.

40|$|Because of the {{conceptual}} difficulties it faces, quantum mechanics provides a salient {{example of how}} alternative metaphysical commitments may clarify our understanding of a physical theory and the explanations it provides. Here we will consider how postulating alternative quantum worlds {{in the context of}} Hugh Everett III's pure wave mechanics may serve to explain determinate measurement records and the standard quantum statistics. We will focus here on the properties <b>of</b> <b>such</b> <b>worlds,</b> then briefly consider other metaphysical options available for interpreting pure wave mechanics. These reflections will serve to illustrate both the nature and the limits of naturalized metaphysics...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{prospects}} for life on planets with subsurface oceans, and find that {{a wide range of}} planets can exist in diverse habitats with relatively thin ice envelopes. We quantify the energy sources available to these worlds, the rate of production of prebiotic compounds, and assess their potential for hosting biospheres. Life on these planets is likely to face challenges, which could be overcome through a combination of different mechanisms. We quantify the number <b>of</b> <b>such</b> <b>worlds,</b> and find that they may outnumber rocky planets in the habitable zone of stars by a few orders of magnitude.

40|$|The current {{paradigm}} for synthetic reality based interactive fiction features familiar kinds of worlds realistically presented. This approach is unsatisfying {{in that it}} excludes several interesting classes <b>of</b> <b>worlds,</b> <b>such</b> as <b>worlds</b> where the user experiences the subjective reality of a character with a substantially different personality. We wish to extend the current paradigm to include classes <b>of</b> <b>worlds</b> <b>such</b> as these. To achieve this, we survey cinema technique and develop a theory of narrative and roughly sketch a system architecture to support enriched interactive fiction based on analogy with film techniques. This work is significant because it brings us closer to our goal of making interactive fiction into a rich, high quality artistic medium...|$|R

40|$|As {{computers}} and computer networks become commonplace {{in the home}} and in our educational institutions, educators are searching for ways to make them effective tools for instruction. Virtual environments that support learning through exploration and experimentation hold the promise <b>of</b> being <b>such</b> a tool. In this paper, we introduce an intelligent computer agent whose purpose is to guide children in their discovery <b>of</b> <b>such</b> <b>worlds,</b> and by so doing, to increase both their enjoyment and the effectiveness of that discovery. Our guide is modeled on Merlyn, the befuddled seer and tutor to young King Arthur in T. H. White's The Once and Future King. Merlyn is an autonomous agent that also has an integrated personality and emotional model, since he is intended to be a companion rather than a reference. We describe a particular kind of virtual world, the MUD (or Multi-User Dimension), that Merlyn is designed to interact with. We explain how he makes decisions in <b>such</b> a <b>world,</b> and how these places [...] ...|$|R

In this work we present {{an analysis of the}} mobility and interactions among characters in World of Warcraft (WoW) and Second Life based on the contact opportunities extracted from actual user data in each of those domains. We analyze character contacts in terms of their spatial and temporal characteristics, as well as the social network derived from such contacts. Our results show that the contacts observed may be more influenced {{by the nature of the}} interactions and goals of the users in each situation than by the in-trinsic structure <b>of</b> <b>such</b> <b>worlds.</b> In particular, observations from a city in WoW are closer to those of Second Life than to other areas in WoW itself...|$|R
