When Della Guardia wins the election, he and Molto accuse Rusty of the murder and push to get evidence against him.

5|$|Gowariker {{had always}} aspired {{to make a}} romantic comedy and was {{inspired}} to adapt Rye's novel into a feature film after watching a play {{based on the same}} source material. Later, he bought the rights and co-wrote the screenplay with playwright Naushil Mehta. In the process, several plot changes were made for the cinematic adaptation, notably the similarity between the twelve girls, and the ending. Since Gowariker was against using prosthetics to create the twelve characters, Chopra worked <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>body</b> language and her voice to make them distinct. Principal photography was extensively done at sixty-seven locations across Mumbai, and partly in Baroda and Chicago. The soundtrack, consisting of thirteen songs, each representing an astrological sign and one compilation, was composed by Sohail Sen, with lyrics by Javed Akhtar.|$|E
5|$|Reproduction in giraffes is broadly polygamous: a few older males {{mate with}} the fertile females. Male giraffes assess female {{fertility}} by tasting the female's urine to detect oestrus, in a multi-step {{process known as}} the flehmen response. Males prefer young adult females over juveniles and older adults. Once an oestrous female is detected, the male will attempt to court her. When courting, dominant males will keep subordinate ones at bay. A courting male may lick a female's tail, rest his head and neck <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>body</b> or nudge her with his horns. During copulation, the male stands on his hind legs with his head held up and his front legs resting on the female's sides.|$|E
