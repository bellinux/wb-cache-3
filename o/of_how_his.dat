5|$|The 2007–08 season {{proved to}} be less successful. An error during {{international}} duty was an example <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>his</b> form had dipped, and he was replaced by Radek Černý {{for part of the}} season, initially after Robinson made an error against Reading in the FA Cup. Although he briefly returned to the team, he made another error in the League Cup final. Despite his error, Tottenham were able to beat Chelsea 2–1, with Robinson collecting the first major trophy of his career. He made 25 appearances in the league for Tottenham during this season, and made 175 appearances in total during his time at the club, 137 in the Premier League.|$|E
5|$|The Simpsons {{drive to}} the park for a picnic but {{discover}} {{that it has been}} overrun by mosquitoes. While heading home, the family finds an Indian casino. Bart is turned away because of his age but is able to sneak in by hiding in ventriloquist Arthur Crandall's dummy case. During Crandall's performance at the casino, Bart bursts out of the case and gets caught by casino guards. He is sent to the casino manager's office, where the Native American manager shows him a vision <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>his</b> future will turn out if he does not change his ways. Thirty years into the future, Bart is a 40-year-old beer-drinking slacker trying to launch his music career after dropping out of the DeVry Institute, and has resorted to mooching off his parents and their neighbor Ned Flanders. The only gig Bart can get is at a beach bar owned by Nelson Muntz, and even then, Bart is only paid in popcorn shrimp. Bart lives with Ralph Wiggum in a beach cottage by the shore, from which Bart finds out that he has been evicted after his disastrous concert at Nelson's bar. Meanwhile, 38-year-old Lisa is the first straight female President of the United States.|$|E

25|$|The {{dialogue}} {{begins with}} an unnamed friend of Socrates asking him how his pursuit of the young Alcibiades, just now reputed to be growing his first beard, was proceeding. Socrates explains that while he has just been {{in the company of}} Alcibiades, his mind is now on more interesting matters. He says that Protagoras, the wisest man alive (309c–d), is in town. Socrates relates the story <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>his</b> young friend, Hippocrates, son of Apollodorus, came knocking on his door before daybreak and roused him out of bed. Hippocrates was in a big hurry to be present when Protagoras held court, as he was expected to do, at the home of Callias.|$|E
25|$|E. T. Vere of Srinagar, Kashmir wrote <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>his</b> {{hospital}} received {{dozens of}} black bear victims annually. He wrote that, when attacking humans, black bears will rear {{up on their}} hind legs and knock victims over with their paws. They then make one or two bites on an arm or leg and finish with a snap to the head, this being the most dangerous part of the attack. There are no records of predation on humans by Asiatic black bears in Russia and no conflicts have been documented in Taiwan. However, in India, attacks on humans have been increasing yearly and have occurred largely in the northwestern and western Himalayan region. In the Chamba District of Himachal Pradesh, {{the number of black}} bear attacks on humans has gradually increased from 10 in 1988–89 to 21 in 1991–92.|$|E
25|$|In early 1946, Superboy {{moved to}} Adventure Comics, where he debuted in issue No. 103 (Apr 1946) {{as the lead}} feature for the {{anthology}} comic, and he remained the headlining feature for over 200 issues. Stories in Adventure Comics treat Superboy as essentially a junior version of Superman. To that end, he wears the Superman costume and his alter ego Clark Kent wears glasses as a disguise for his civilian identity. Superboy is the superhero of Clark's hometown of Smallville and grows up {{under the guidance of}} his foster parents, Ma and Pa Kent. Superboy's adventures in Adventure Comics include the story of how he was reunited with his pet superdog, Krypto; the story <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>his</b> friend, the teenage scientist Lex Luthor, becomes his most bitter foe; and how Superboy joins the 30th-century Legion of Super-Heroes.|$|E

25|$|Maximilian I shared rule {{with his}} father during the latter year of Frederick's reign, being elected King of the Romans in 1486. By {{acquiring}} the lands of the Tyrolean line of the Habsburgs in 1490 he finally reunited all the Austrian lands, divided since 1379. He also needed {{to deal with the}} Hungarian problem when Mathias I died in 1490. Maximilian reconquered the lost parts of Austria and established peace with Mathias's successor Vladislaus II at the Peace of Pressburg in 1491. However the dynastic pattern of division and unification would be one that kept repeating itself over time. With unsettled borders Maximilian found Innsbruck in the Tyrol a safer place for a capital, between his Burgundian and Austrian lands, although he was rarely in any place for very long, being acutely aware <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>his</b> father had been repeatedly besieged in Vienna.|$|E
25|$|In the Superman Adventures comic line {{based on}} the TV series of the same name, Luthor's backstory is {{identical}} {{to that of the}} Modern Age origin with slight changes. Luthor is shown originating in Suicide Slum, but at an early age already aware <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>his</b> brilliance outshone other children and his plans to have all Metropolis look up to him one day. Luthor's baldness is never explained, save for a brief depiction of him with blond hair in childhood, it is assumed the hair loss was natural. Luthor's parents die during his teenage years, however their deaths were indeed accidental and with no foul play by Lex. As in the usual story, Lex uses the insurance payouts to kick-start his future by paying for his tuition to MIT and eventually starting LexCorp. His hatred of Superman is explained as the citizens of Metropolis have had more admiration for the Man of Steel than for Lex.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, a five-part series, , on the Showtime Network, refuted {{many of the}} long-held {{misconceptions about}} the AFL. In it, Abner Haynes tells <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>his</b> father forbade him to accept being drafted by the NFL, after drunken scouts from that league had visited the Haynes home; the NFL Cowboys' Tex Schramm {{is quoted as saying}} that if his team had ever agreed to play the AFL's Dallas Texans, they would very likely have lost; George Blanda makes a case for more AFL players being {{inducted}} to the Pro Football Hall of Fame by pointing out that Hall of Famer Willie Brown was cut by the Houston Oilers because he couldn't cover Oilers flanker Charlie Hennigan in practice. Later, when Brown was with the Broncos, Hennigan needed nine catches in one game against the Broncos to break Lionel Taylor's Professional Football record of 100 catches in one season. Hennigan caught the nine passes and broke the record, even though he was covered by Brown, Blanda's point being that if Hennigan could do so well against a Hall of Fame DB, he deserves induction, as well.|$|E
