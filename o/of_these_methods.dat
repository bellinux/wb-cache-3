5|$|All known {{cnidaria}} can reproduce asexually {{by various}} means, {{in addition to}} regenerating after being fragmented. Hydrozoan polyps only bud, while the medusae of some hydrozoans can divide down the middle. Scyphozoan polyps can both bud and split down the middle. In addition to both <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>methods,</b> Anthozoa can split horizontally just above the base. Asexual reproduction makes the daughter cnidarian a clone of the adult.|$|E
5|$|Fine-mapping {{requires}} all variants in {{the associated}} region {{to have been}} genotyped or imputed (dense coverage), very stringent quality control resulting in high-quality genotypes, and large sample sizes sufficient in separating out highly correlated signals. There are several different methods to perform fine-mapping, and all methods produce a posterior probability that a variant in that locus is causal. Because the requirements are often difficult to satisfy, there are still limited examples <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>methods</b> being more generally applied.|$|E

5|$|Almost all of Josquin's motets {{use some}} kind of {{compositional}} constraint on the process; they are not freely composed. Some of them use a cantus firmus as a unifying device; some are canonic; some use a motto which repeats throughout; some use several <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>methods.</b> The motets that use canon can be roughly divided into two groups: those in which the canon is plainly designed to be heard and appreciated as such, and another group in which a canon is present, but almost impossible to hear, and seemingly written to be appreciated by the eye, and by connoisseurs.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, Bennetts {{teamed with}} state {{botanist}} Charles Gardner {{to study the}} toxic effect of native plants species on sheep. Gardner would collect the plants and supply them fresh to Bennetts who would then feed them to the sheep. They confirmed 24 species of plants as being poisonous, most which were from the native pea genera Gastrolobium and Oxylobium. Based on this and later research, Gardner and Bennetts published The Toxic Plants of Western Australia in 1956. During 1935, investigations into the effects of castrating male lambs with either mechanical pincers compared to using a knife, both <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>methods</b> have since been replaced with rubber elastrator rings. The experiment on 499 sheep concluded that {{no significant differences were}} observable in respect of mortality, maturity rates and meat quality.|$|E
5|$|Several {{methods are}} known for {{defining}} cellular automata rules that are reversible; these include the block cellular automaton method, in which each update partitions the cells into blocks and applies an invertible function separately to each block, and the second-order cellular automaton method, in which the update rule combines states from two previous steps of the automaton. When an automaton is not defined by one <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>methods,</b> but is instead given as a rule table, the problem of testing whether it is reversible is solvable for block cellular automata and for one-dimensional cellular automata, but is undecidable for other types of cellular automata.|$|E

5|$|Sheep {{producers}} {{have used a}} wide variety of measures to combat predation. Pre-modern shepherds used their own presence, livestock guardian dogs, and protective structures such as barns and fencing. Fencing (both regular and electric), penning sheep at night and lambing indoors all continue to be widely used. More modern shepherds used guns, traps, and poisons to kill predators, causing significant decreases in predator populations. In the wake of the environmental and conservation movements, the use <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>methods</b> now usually falls under the purview of specially designated government agencies in most developed countries.|$|E
5|$|The Turnpike Commission {{announced}} plans to consider eliminating manned toll booths in favor of all-electronic tolls. With this, tolls will be paid using either E-ZPass or credit cards. Drivers unable to pay by either <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>methods</b> will be billed in the mail using license plate recognition; an additional surcharge will be applied. In addition to E-ZPass, the turnpike commission offered other automated options to pay for tolls such as using a prepaid account that utilizes license plate recognition. McCormick Taylor and Wilbur Smith Associates have been hired to conduct a feasibility study on converting the road to all-electronic tolls.|$|E
5|$|The {{simplest}} molluscan {{reproductive system}} relies on external fertilization, {{but with more}} complex variations. All produce eggs, from which may emerge trochophore larvae, more complex veliger larvae, or miniature adults. Two gonads sit next to the coelom, a small cavity that surrounds the heart, into which they shed ova or sperm. The nephridia extract the gametes from the coelom and emit them into the mantle cavity. Molluscs that use such a system remain of one sex all their lives and rely on external fertilization. Some molluscs use internal fertilization and/or are hermaphrodites, functioning as both sexes; both <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>methods</b> require more complex reproductive systems.|$|E

5|$|Three main {{camouflage}} methods predominate in the oceans: transparency, reflection, and counterillumination. Transparency and reflectivity {{are most}} important in the top 100 metres of the ocean; counterillumination is the main method from 100 metres down to 1000 metres; while camouflage becomes less important in the dark waters below 1000 metres. Most animals of the open sea use at least one <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>methods</b> to camouflage themselves. Camouflage in relatively shallow waters is more like terrestrial camouflage, where additional methods are used by animals in many different groups. These methods of camouflage are described in turn below.|$|E
