Scully flashes back to when as a child, she hid her pet rabbit from her brother in a lunchbox, only for it to suffocate and die.

40|$|Much {{information}} {{can be obtained from}} knowing what tasks the user does <b>on</b> his or <b>her</b> <b>cell</b> <b>phone.</b> This paper describes GuiDE, an automated user-activity recognition system on the mobile phone. GuiDE's unique approach to activity recognition exploits GUI screenshots taken as the individual interacts with their <b>cell</b> <b>phone.</b> These screenshots are aggregated into a graph to help probabilistically determine whether or not a set of screenshots can be considered a user-level activity. A frequency count of different sets of screenshots is also kept to act as a sanity check against the probabilistic result. GuiDE is just a partial step towards a much more powerful tool that can correlate GUI information with other services to provide a better understanding of user activity. by Emily Z. Yan. Thesis (M.

Elliptic Curve Cryptography suites well for resources constraint devices like mobile phones and PDA, because of its less computation time, short key’s length, fast digital signature, flexibility and less resource consumptio...|$|R
