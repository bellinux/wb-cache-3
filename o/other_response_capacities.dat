This research identifies components of <b>response</b> <b>capacity</b> to floods and municipal action, and potential mechanisms to increase <b>response</b> <b>capacity</b> in the City of Vancouver and District of Maple Ridge using interviews (n= 7), Q methodology (n= 12), and a literature review. Findings show that legislation, institutional behaviour and collective action, technological pathways and resource management are fundamental to an institution or organization’s <b>response</b> <b>capacity.</b> Municipal action is influenced by competing priorities as determined through legal responsibility and liability, collective agreements, public behaviour, risk, vulnerability and uncertainty, {{and the politics of}} municipal governance. It is viewed by participants that resource efficiency, collaborative, co-management and adaptive co-management techniques could lead to greater <b>response</b> <b>capacity.</b> The findings presented provide a proposed conceptual framework to <b>response</b> <b>capacity</b> to floods and municipal action...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Primary care medical staffs’ knowledge, {{attitude}} and behavior about health emergency and the <b>response</b> <b>capacity</b> {{are directly related}} to the control and prevention of public health emergencies. Therefore, it is of great significance for improving primary care to gain in-depth knowledge about knowledge, {{attitude and}} behavior and the <b>response</b> <b>capacity</b> of primary care medical staffs. The main objective {{of this study is to}} explore knowledge, attitude and behavior, and the <b>response</b> <b>capacity</b> of primary care medical staffs of Guangdong Province, China. Methods Stratified clustered sample method was used in the anonymous questionnaire investigation about knowledge, attitude and behavior, and the <b>response</b> <b>capacity</b> of 3410 primary care medical staffs in 15 cities of Guangdong Province, China from July, 2010 to October 2010. The emergency <b>response</b> <b>capacity</b> was evaluated by 33 questions. The highest score of the <b>response</b> <b>capacity</b> was 100 points (full score), score of 70 was a standard. Results 62. 4 % primary care medical staffs believed that public health emergencies would happen. Influenza (3. 86 [*]±[*] 0. 88), food poisoning (3. 35 [*]±[*] 0. 75), and environmental pollution events (3. 23 [*]±[*] 0. 80) (the total score was 5) were considered most likely to occur. Among the 7 public health emergency skills, the highest self-assessment score is “public health emergency prevention skills” (2. 90 [*]±[*] 0. 68), the lowest is “public health emergency risk management (the total score was 5) ” (1. 81 [*]±[*] 0. 40). Attitude evaluation showed 66. 1 % of the medical staffs believed that the community awareness of risk management were ordinary. Evaluation of <b>response</b> <b>capacity</b> of health emergency showed that the score of primary care medical staffs was 67. 23 [*]±[*] 10. 61, and the <b>response</b> <b>capacity</b> of senior physicians, public health physicians and physicians with relatively long-term practice were significantly better (P Conclusions The knowledge, attitude and behavior about public health emergencies and the <b>response</b> <b>capacity</b> of primary care medical staffs of Guangdong Province (China) were poor. Health administrative departments should strengthen the training of health emergency knowledge and skills of the primary care medical staffs to enhance their health emergency response capabilities. </p...|$|R

40|$|Guinea-pigs were {{sensitized}} to ovalbumin (OA) by immunization regimens {{chosen to}} cause antigen-induced bronchial anaphylactic responses mediated mainly either by IgE-like antibodies or by IgG 1 -like antibodies. Treatment of the IgE-producing animals {{for three weeks}} with the histamine H 2 -receptor antagonist cimetidine (1 mg kg- 1 i. p. once a day) or with the H 2 -agonist dimaprit (0. 1, 1. 0, or 10 mg kg- 1 i. p. once a day) led to a significantly reduced bronchial <b>response</b> <b>capacity</b> {{compared with that of}} the saline-treated controls challenged intravenously with antigen one week after the end of treatment. The changes were biphasic and not strictly dose-dependent. In contrast, acute treatment of immunized animals with a single dose of cimetidine (10 or 30 mg kg- 1 i. v.) or dimaprit (1 or 10 mg kg- 1 i. v.) 2 min before challenge with OA did not significantly affect the bronchial anaphylactic response. However, long-term treatment with cimetidine (10 mg kg- 1) or the dimaprit analogue, S-[4 -(N, N-dimethylamino) -butyl] isothiourea (SKF Compound 91488) (1 mg kg- 1), which is reported not to activate H 2 -receptors, had no effect on the <b>response</b> <b>capacity.</b> Treatment with cimetidine (1 mg kg- 1) or dimaprit (1 mg kg- 1) did not influence the <b>response</b> <b>capacity</b> to antigen challenge in IgG 1 - type animals. Dimaprit (1 mg kg- 1) did not affect the responsiveness to intravenous provocation with histamine in 'IgE-type' animals. Antigen-induced release of histamine from chopped lung tissue in vitro was not significantly affected in 'IgE-type' animals treated with cimetidine (1 mg kg- 1) or dimaprit (1 mg kg- 1). Treatment of immunized animals with cimetidine or dimaprit one week before and one week after a booster injection of antigen also led to reduced <b>response</b> <b>capacity</b> compared with that of saline-treated controls. However, the serum levels of IgE-like homocytotropic antibodies of these animals were not reduced; on the contrary, those of IgG 1 -antibody were increased in dimaprit-treated animals.

Despite the increased focus on humanitarian supply chains, there is not a general method for measuring the supply chain <b>response</b> <b>capacity.</b> We propose a model for humanitarian <b>response</b> <b>capacity</b> based on the stock levels and supplier capacity of an organization. We evaluate the model using inventory stock level data from the United Nations Humanitarian Response Depots (UN HRD) and a combination of inventory stock level and supplier contracted replenishment time data from the New York City Office of Emergency Management (NYC OEM). Model results in response to four simulated disaster events graphically show the approximate number of people that can be served as well as the oscillations in <b>capacity</b> during the <b>response</b> and replenishment phases. Given the span from global (UN HRD) to municipal (NYC OEM) contexts, this <b>response</b> <b>capacity</b> model provides a framework for developing a more general index that can aid organizations in making important investment decisions in order to save lives with more efficient disaster response. by Ariahna N.

From 10 : 00 to 11 : 00, all the controllable TCLs are turned on to respond to the positive load power fluctuation. Considering the power output of the TCLs in Fig.  16, there are no TCLs in the “ON” state from 12 : 00 to 17 : 00, which further verifies that the <b>response</b> <b>capacity</b> is limited during this period. From 14 : 00 to 18 : 00, the TCLs are not controlled to turn on, because the <b>response</b> <b>capacity</b> from the EVs is sufficient and the TCLs do not need to respond to the power fluctuations.|$|R

Similarly, within each cell population, the small, heavy cells were least reactive.
