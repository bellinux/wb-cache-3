5000|$|Although the <b>On-Guard</b> <b>position</b> is a {{formidable}} overall stance, {{it is by no}} means the only one. He acknowledged there were times when other positions should be used. Lee felt the dynamic property of JKD was what enabled its practitioners to adapt to the constant changes and fluctuations of live combat. He believed these decisions should be made within the context of [...] "real combat" [...] and/or [...] "all out sparring" [...] and that it was only in this environment that a practitioner could actually deem a technique worthy of adoption.Lee believed that real combat was alive and dynamic. Circumstances in a fight change from millisecond to millisecond. Thus, pre-arranged patterns and techniques are not adequate in dealing with such a changing situation. As an antidote to this line of thought, Lee once wrote an epitaph which read: 'In memory of a once fluid man, crammed and distorted by the classical mess.' The [...] "classical mess" [...] in this instance was what Lee thought of the [...] "not too alive way of the classical kung fu styles".|$|E
40|$|The title "Te Tohu-a-Tuu (The Sign of Tuu) " is {{the name}} of a taiaha <b>on-guard</b> <b>position</b> that invokes Tuu, the Maori god of war. It has been chosen to reflect the subject of Maori warfare in the pre-European period. Maori warfare during this period was very much {{influenced}} by the cosmological and environmental beliefs of the Maori. These beliefs were mainly articulated through the oral histories of the Maori. Accounts of pre-European Maori warfare has mainly been written by early European historians who were greatly influenced by the prevailing social customs and intellectual thinking of the time. No linkage was made between the Maori protocols and processes of warfare with the cosmological and environmental beliefs practiced by the Maori. As a result the current understanding of Maori warfare has largely stemmed from written accounts by non-Maori. This thesis explores Maori warfare through the institution of Tuumatauenga, the ugly faced Maori god of war. It will show the processes and the protocols that the Maori warrior used to prepare the mind and body for war and battle in the pre-European period. This preparation often started in the womb and progressed from early childhood through to initiation, as a youth, into the schools of war. From here the student graduated on to the battle-field as a toa taua or warrior. Through personal prowess and skill at arms, the toa taua gained Ika-a-Whiro or war leadership status. The institution of Tuumatauenga is then linked with other Maori gods to show that Maori warfare and warrior arts were greatly influenced by cosmological and environmental beliefs...|$|E

5000|$|After the salutes are completed, {{the referee}} will call [...] "En garde!" [...] The fencers {{put on their}} masks and adopt the fencing stance with the front foot behind the en-garde line and, in foil, with the blade in the sixte line.

Finally the referee will call [...] "Play!" [...] or [...] "Fence!", and the bout will start. Judging is often done in French, in which case the referee will say [...] "En garde! Prêts? Allez!" [...] or, if both fencers are female, [...] "En garde! Prêtes? Allez!" [...] (In some circles, beginning the bout with the order [...] "fence" [...] is deemed incorrect, but in others the use of [...] "play" [...] is discouraged due to the phonetic similarity with the French [...] "prêts". The use of [...] "fence" [...] is contrary to the rules in certain countries.) ...|$|R
