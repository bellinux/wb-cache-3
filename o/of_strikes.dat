5|$|Discussions {{were held}} {{during the second}} wave <b>of</b> <b>strikes,</b> when Brendan Barber {{announced}} {{on the afternoon of}} Friday 30 October that proposals had been put to both Royal Mail and the CWU for them to consider over the weekend. Talks resumed on the Monday, however this news was overshadowed by the announcement that a further two days <b>of</b> <b>strikes</b> would be held on Friday 6 November and Monday 9 November. It was also announced that these would be all out strikes with everybody walking out at the same time rather than the rolling strike action that had been adopted previously, thus leading to a complete stoppage throughout the course of the action. These were later called off in order for further talks to take place.|$|E
5|$|The Parisian bid {{suffered}} two setbacks {{during the}} inspection: a number <b>of</b> <b>strikes</b> and demonstrations {{coincided with the}} visit, and a report was released stating that Guy Drut, IOC member {{and one of the}} key members of Paris's bid team, faced charges over alleged political party financial corruption.|$|E
5|$|Ballot papers {{proposing a}} {{national}} strike were {{sent out to}} union members on 17 September. On 8 October {{it was announced that}} postal workers had voted three to one in favour of taking strike action over job security and working conditions. The first round <b>of</b> <b>strikes</b> were later scheduled for Thursday 22 October and Friday 23 October. These would consist of two 24-hour stoppages, with mail centre staff and drivers striking on 22 October and delivery and collection staff doing likewise the following day.|$|E

5000|$|Late in the 19th century, anarchist {{labor unions}} {{began to use}} the tactic <b>of</b> general <b>strike.</b> This often {{resulted}} in violence by both sides and some <b>of</b> the <b>strikes</b> even resulted in the deaths <b>of</b> <b>striking</b> workers, their replacements and security staff.|$|R
40|$|Some {{theories}} <b>of</b> <b>strike</b> activity {{suggest that}} the settlement probability <b>of</b> a <b>strike</b> depends {{on the number of}} workers involved in the strike. Additionally, much recent empirical research on strikes has been constrained by data availability to look only at strikes in large bargaining units. It is natural to ask, therefore, whether strike size systematically influences strike duration, and whether this question poses problems of interpretation for studies confined to samples <b>of</b> large <b>strikes.</b> This paper uses Canadian strike data to examine these questions. We find that size is an important determinant <b>of</b> <b>strike</b> duration and also that studies <b>of</b> <b>strike</b> duration based only on large strikes can yield results that are not representative of the influences for all strikes. ...|$|R
5|$|Bridgwater {{became the}} first town in Britain to {{petition}} the government to ban slavery, in 1785. In 1896, the trade unionists of Bridgwater's brick and tile industry were involved a number <b>of</b> <b>strikes.</b> The Salisbury government sent troops to the town to clear the barricades by force after {{the reading of the}} Riot Act.|$|E
5|$|During the {{subsequent}} exchange <b>of</b> <b>strikes,</b> Silva landed a direct right hook on Jackson's face, stunning Jackson and sending him backpedaling towards the ropes. Silva closed {{the distance and}} secured a Muay Thai clinch. From here, Silva landed approximately 5 knee strikes to Jackson's head, causing him {{to fall into the}} ropes, unconscious and with blood pouring out of his face. Silva was declared the winner by Knockout at 3:26 of the 2nd round to remain the Pride Middleweight Champion.|$|E
5|$|Operation Mascot was an {{unsuccessful}} British carrier air raid conducted against the German battleship Tirpitz at her anchorage in Kaafjord, Norway, on 17 July 1944. The attack {{was one of}} a series <b>of</b> <b>strikes</b> against the battleship launched from aircraft carriers between April and August 1944, and was initiated after Allied intelligence determined that the damage inflicted during the Operation Tungsten raid on 3 April had been repaired.|$|E

5|$|The Allied forces around Okinawa {{braced for}} an assault. Admiral Raymond Spruance ordered six battleships already engaged in shore {{bombardment}} in the sector {{to prepare for}} surface action against Yamato. These orders were countermanded in favor <b>of</b> <b>strikes</b> from Admiral Marc Mitscher's aircraft carriers, but as a contingency the battleships together with seven cruisers and 21 destroyers were sent to interdict the Japanese force before it could reach the vulnerable transports and landing craft.|$|E
5|$|The {{second round}} {{began with the}} two fighters exchanging a flurry <b>of</b> <b>strikes.</b> Silva then {{attempted}} a takedown {{with a combination of}} a body lock and a trip, but Jackson reversed it into a takedown of his own. The action stayed in Silva's guard very briefly, until the two scrambled back to their feet.|$|E
5|$|After months <b>of</b> <b>strikes</b> and {{political}} deliberations, {{at the conclusion}} of the 10th plenary session of the Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR, the Polish communist party), the government agreed to enter into Round Table Negotiations that lasted from February to April 1989. Wałęsa was an informal leader of the non-governmental side in the negotiations. During the talks, he traveled throughout Poland giving speeches in support of the negotiations. At the end of the talks, the government signed an agreement to re-establish the Solidarity Trade Union and to organize semi-free elections to the Polish parliament; in accordance with the Round Table Agreement, only members of the Communist Party and its allies could stand for 65 percent of the seats in the lower house, the Sejm.|$|E

5|$|As group runners-up, Juventus {{had to face}} a group winner – Germans Borussia Dortmund of Group D – in {{the last}} 16. They won 2–1 {{at home in the}} first leg on 24 February 2015, with all the goals in the first half – visitor Marco Reus {{equalised}} either side <b>of</b> <b>strikes</b> from Tevez and Álvaro Morata. The same forwards were on target in the second leg at the Westfalenstadion on 18 March – Tevez scored twice, including in the third minute – as Juventus won 3–0, and 5–1 on aggregate.|$|E
5|$|By 1980, the {{authorities}} {{had no choice}} but to make another attempt to raise consumer prices to realistic levels, but they knew that doing so would likely spark another worker rebellion. Western bankers providing loans to the Polish government at a meeting at the Bank Handlowy in Warsaw on 1 July 1980 made it clear that low prices of consumer goods could no longer be subsidized by the state. The government gave in and on 1 July announced a system of gradual but continuous price rises, particularly for meat. A wave <b>of</b> <b>strikes</b> and factory occupations began at once, with the biggest ones taking place in Lublin in July 1980.|$|E
5|$|Central to the 2009 dispute was the {{agreement}} that ended the 2007 round <b>of</b> <b>strikes.</b> The 2007 Pay and Modernisation Agreement saw the parties involved agree to a four-phase plan, which would be implemented with dialogue between both sides at each stage of the process. However, the Communication Workers Union said that although Royal Mail had carried out three of the phases in this way, it had refused to discuss the final phase, which concerned the government's plans for modernisation, and how these would affect the job security of Royal Mail employees.|$|E

40|$|The {{history of}} the Austrian "Ständestaat", whose {{character}} is still debated, is {{closely linked to the}} phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>strike.</b> Although the analysis <b>of</b> <b>strike</b> activities has the potential to contribute to the discussion about this political system's functioning, scholars did not pay much attention to the topic yet. This article gives an overview on the institutional pattern of industrial relations in Austro-Fascism, tries to reconstruct the tendencies <b>of</b> <b>striking</b> in Austria between 1934 and 1938 and analyses the case study <b>of</b> the 1936 <b>strikes</b> in the Viennese car industry comparing them to the same year's Opel strike in Nazi Germany. On balance, the example <b>of</b> <b>striking</b> shows that Austro-Fascism was a rather chaotic system, which never managed to implement even the cornerstones of its own ideology. Neither did the system of forced arbitration ever work, nor was it in concrete conflicts foreseeable whether the government would react with mediation or try to suppress workers' protest...|$|R

5|$|Conscription was {{introduced}} in Canada during {{the final years of}} the war, which was accompanied by labour shortages, pressures for social change, and the rapid unionisation of the remaining workforce. While concerns about the Central Powers declined, fears grew in government at the end of 1918 that the new Bolshevik government in Russia might be covertly orchestrating a campaign <b>of</b> <b>strikes</b> across Canada. In response the Prime Minister, Robert Borden, created a Public Safety Branch led by the politician Charles Cahan. Cahan envisaged transforming this organisation into a much larger secret service, similar to the Bureau of Investigation in the United States, but he soon fell out with Borden and ultimately resigned.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} {{setbacks}} of the Russian army at {{the hand of}} Nazi Germany, Novikov and the Leningrad air forces {{took part in a}} number <b>of</b> <b>strikes</b> against the advancing German armies, including the first Soviet air operation of the war, from June 25 – 30, 1941, which cost the Germans 130 aircraft. During this time, Novikov was noted for his skill in command and for his innovation, particularly the then unknown use of radio to coordinate bomber flights. In July 1941, Novikov expanded his command from Leningrad to include air forces of the Northern Front, Northwestern Front and the Baltic Fleet, and as the Germans approached Leningrad, Novikov and his forces flew 16,567 sorties.|$|E
5|$|Half of Harris's {{credited}} kills {{were achieved}} in October, coinciding with Japanese planners' final attempt at provoking a decisive {{battle with the}} American fleet. On October 1, 1944, while still anchored at Ulithi, Intrepid was made Admiral Bogan's flagship. The carrier disembarked from harbor on October 7 {{to head for the}} waters southeast of Okinawa. It was scheduled to be part <b>of</b> <b>strikes</b> on Okinawa, the Ryukyus and Luzon leading up to a planned invasion of Leyte. These strikes began on October 10, targeting Okinawan airfields including Naha, Yontan and Ie Shima, as well as nearby shipping. Anti-aircraft fire ranged from meager to intense with flak worsening throughout the day. But, regardless of strike time, or target, there was virtually no aerial opposition encountered.|$|E

5|$|Having been {{promoted}} to temporary wing commander on 1August 1943, Rawlinson handed over command of No.79 Squadron on 7November and was appointed wing leader of No.73 Wing, headquartered at Kiriwina. The wing leader was responsible for tactical command of the formation in the air. Minimal offensive air activity by the Japanese meant that No.79 Squadron's Spitfires saw relatively little action; the wing's Kittyhawks, with their ground-attack capability, were heavily engaged. On 15December, {{the day of the}} Allied landings at Arawe, No.76 Squadron Kittyhawks patrolled above the beaches while the Spitfires remained at Kiriwina in case <b>of</b> <b>strikes</b> by Japanese raiders, though none came.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} years of the NFL, {{contractual}} negotiations took place between individual players and management; team owners were reluctant to engage in collective bargaining. A series <b>of</b> <b>strikes</b> and lockouts have occurred throughout the union's existence largely due to monetary and benefit disputes between the players and the owners. League rules that punished players for playing in rival football leagues resulted in litigation; the success of such lawsuits impelled the NFL to negotiate some work rules and minimum payments with the NFLPA. However, the organization was not recognized by the NFL as the official bargaining agent for the players until 1968, when a CBA was signed. The most recent CBA negotiations took place in 2011.|$|E
5|$|On 13 October {{the weather}} was more {{uncooperative}} than on the previous day. Even though a wider array of targets {{was assigned to the}} task groups, from the Pescadores to northern Luzon and Formosa, far fewer enemies were encountered in the air. Results of the day's strike operations were hard to ascertain due to the overcast. Pilots' reports from these two days <b>of</b> <b>strikes</b> helped uncover a larger network of air bases on Formosa than previously anticipated. This knowledge, combined with radio intercepts and the dusk strikes fended off the previous evening, led Commander Task Force 38 Mitscher to cancel any strikes scheduled to take off after 14:00 hours. Instead, the task groups prepared to defend against another night assault.|$|E
