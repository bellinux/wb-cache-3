More importantly, Johnson provided encouragement at crucial moments during the writing of her seminal political treatises A Vindication <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rights</b> of Men (1790) and A Vindication <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rights</b> of Woman (1792).|$|E
5|$|In 1790, {{at the age}} of thirty-one, Wollstonecraft made a {{dramatic}} entrance onto the public stage with A Vindication <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rights</b> of Men, a work that helped propel the British pamphlet war over the French revolution. Two years later she published what has become her most famous work, A Vindication <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rights</b> of Woman. Anxious to see the revolution firsthand, she moved to France for about two years, but returned in 1795 after revolutionary violence increased and the lover she met there, American adventurer Gilbert Imlay, abandoned her and their illegitimate daughter, Fanny Imlay. Shortly after her return to Britain, Wollstonecraft attempted suicide in May; Imlay, however, managed to save her.|$|E
5|$|In {{her later}} works, such as A Vindication <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rights</b> of Men (1790) and A Vindication <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rights</b> of Woman (1792), Wollstonecraft {{repeatedly}} {{returns to the}} topics addressed in Thoughts, particularly the virtue {{of hard work and}} the imperative for women to learn useful skills. Wollstonecraft suggests that the social and political life of the nation would greatly improve if women were to acquire valuable skills instead of being mere social ornaments.|$|E

40|$|Purpose. Thorough {{understanding}} of biliary anatomy is required when performing surgical interventions in the hepatobiliary system. This study describes <b>the</b> anatomical variations <b>of</b> <b>right</b> bile ducts {{in terms of}} branching and drainage patterns, and determines their frequency. Methods. We studied 73 samples of cadaveric material, focusing on <b>the</b> relationship <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> anterior and posterior segmental branches, the way they form <b>the</b> <b>right</b> hepatic duct, and <b>the</b> main variations <b>of</b> their drainage pattern. Results. <b>The</b> anatomy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> hepatic duct was typical in 65. 75 % of samples. Ectopic drainage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> anterior duct into the common hepatic duct was found in 15. 07 % and triple confluence in 9. 59 %. Ectopic drainage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> posterior duct into the common hepatic duct was discovered in 2. 74 % and ectopic drainage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> posterior duct into the left hepatic duct in 4. 11 %. Ectopic drainage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> anterior duct into the left hepatic ductal system and ectopic drainage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> posterior duct into the cystic duct was found in 1. 37 %. Conclusion. <b>The</b> branching pattern <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> hepatic duct was atypical in 34. 25 % of cases. Thus, knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anatomical variations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> extrahepatic bile ducts is important in many surgical cases...|$|R

5|$|Original Stories is {{primarily}} about leaving the imperfections of childhood behind {{and becoming a}} rational and charitable adult; it does not romanticise childhood as an innocent and ideal state of being.

5|$|Original Stories {{was first}} {{published}} anonymously in 1788, {{the same year as}} Wollstonecraft's first novel , and cost two shillings. When the second edition came out in 1791, Wollstonecraft’s name was printed on the title page; after the publication in 1790 of her Vindication <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rights</b> of Men, she had become well known and her name would have boosted sales. Joseph Johnson, the publisher of Original Stories and all of Wollstonecraft's other works, commissioned William Blake to design six illustrations for the second edition, which cost two shillings and six pence. It is not entirely clear how long the book remained continuously in print. According to Gary Kelly, a prominent Wollstonecraft scholar, the last edition of Original Stories was published in 1820, but without Wollstonecraft’s name on the title page; by that time she had become a reviled figure in Britain because her husband, William Godwin, had revealed her unorthodox lifestyle in his Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rights</b> of Woman (1798). According to Alan Richardson and the editors of the Masterworks of Children's Literature series, Original Stories was published until 1835. It was also printed in Dublin in 1791 and 1799 and translated into German in 1795.|$|E
