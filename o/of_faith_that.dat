40|$|Abstract: We {{argue that}} the use of {{publicly}} funded medical facil-ities for patients who are waiting for a miracle amounts to discrim-ination against atheists, agnostics and advocates, <b>of</b> <b>faiths</b> <b>that</b> do not accept miracle claims. The only exception is when this use can be justified by considerations that demonstrate that waiting makes it more likely that a miracle will occur and will aid the patient’s recovery. Such justification can be grounded on considerations <b>of</b> <b>faith</b> or <b>of</b> reason. We consider both possibilities and suggest con-ditions of acceptability for both. In arguing this way, we steer a middle path between discrimination against atheists, agnostics, and advocates <b>of</b> <b>faiths</b> <b>that</b> do not accept miracle claims – miraclism – and a failure to respect religious belief.

25|$|Rather than {{argue for}} the {{necessity}} of a god, some theists base their belief upon grounds independent of, or prior to, reason, making Occam's razor irrelevant. This was the stance of Søren Kierkegaard, who viewed belief in God as a leap <b>of</b> <b>faith</b> <b>that</b> sometimes directly opposed reason. This is also the doctrine of Gordon Clark's presuppositional apologetics, with the exception that Clark never thought the leap of faith was contrary to reason (see also Fideism).|$|E
25|$|Liberal {{branches}} of Judaism make some additional {{changes to the}} opening benedictions. the phrase umeivi go'eil ("and brings a redeemer") is changed in Reform Judaism to umeivi ge'ulah ("who brings redemption"), replacing the personal messiah with a Messianic Age.

25|$|In his writings, one of al-Kindi's central {{concerns}} was {{to demonstrate}} the compatibility between philosophy and natural theology on the one hand, and revealed or speculative theology on the other (though in fact he rejected speculative theology). Despite this, he did make clear that he believed revelation was a superior source of knowledge to reason because it guaranteed matters <b>of</b> <b>faith</b> <b>that</b> reason could not uncover. And while his philosophical approach was not always original, and was even considered clumsy by later thinkers (mainly {{because he was the}} first philosopher writing in the Arabic language), he successfully incorporated Aristotelian and (especially) neo-Platonist thought into an Islamic philosophical framework. This was an important factor in the introduction and popularization of Greek philosophy in the Muslim intellectual world.|$|E
25|$|Belief {{in natural}} law and transcendent moral order lay the {{foundation}} for traditionalist conservative thought. Reason and divine revelation inform natural law and the universal truths of faith. It is through these universal truths <b>of</b> <b>faith</b> <b>that</b> man orders himself and the world around him. Mankind organized society {{on the basis of these}} universal truths of faith. The traditionalist holds axiomatic the belief that religion precedes civilization (see T. S. Eliot's essays Christianity and Culture). Most traditionalist conservatives embrace High Church Christianity (e.g. T. S. Eliot, an Anglo-Catholic; Russell Kirk, a Roman Catholic; and Rod Dreher, an Eastern Orthodox Christian). However, not all traditionalists are High Church Christians. Other traditionalists whose faith traditions are notable include Caleb Stegall, who is an evangelical Protestant. Many conservative mainline Protestants are also traditionalist conservatives, including some of the writers for Touchstone Magazine. Many traditionalists are Jewish, such as the late Will Herberg, Irving Louis Horowitz, Mordecai Roshwald and Paul Gottfried.|$|E

500|$|... "World of Stone" [...] {{is a song}} by English rock {{musician}} George Harrison, {{released in}} 1975 on Extra Texture (Read All About It), his final album for Apple Records. It was also issued as the B-side of the album's lead single, [...] "You". Harrison wrote the song in 1973 but recorded it two years later, following the unfavourable critical reception afforded his 1974 North American tour with Ravi Shankar and the Dark Horse album. Due to its context on release, commentators view [...] "World of Stone" [...] as a plea from Harrison for tolerance from these detractors. According {{to some of his}} biographers, the lyrics reflect Harrison's doubts regarding his devotion to a spiritual path – an apparent crisis <b>of</b> <b>faith</b> <b>that</b> followed his often-unwelcome spiritual pronouncements during the tour, and which permeated his work throughout 1975.|$|E
500|$|Spielberg {{devised the}} three trials that guard the Grail.

For the second trial, in which Indiana spells [...] "Iehova" [...] on stable stepping stones, {{it was intended to}} have a tarantula crawl up Indiana after he mistakenly steps on [...] "J". This was filmed and deemed unsatisfactory, so ILM filmed a stuntman hanging through a hole that appears in the floor, 30 feet above a cavern. As this was dark, it did not matter that the matte painting and models were rushed late in production. The third trial, the leap <b>of</b> <b>faith</b> <b>that</b> Indiana makes over an apparently impassable ravine after discovering a bridge hidden by forced perspective, was created with a model bridge and painted backgrounds.

As a result, Royal Lao armed forces, Hmong, and Thai mercenaries went on the offensive, as did PAVN and the Pathet Lao, all of whom wished to become [...] "well postured for the peace negotiations." [...] Although there was no provision for a Laotian cease-fire written into the Paris Peace Accord that was signed on 27 January 1973, it had been verbally agreed between the U.S. and North Vietnamese representatives that one would be instituted within 15 days of the signing of the agreement. The fates of Laos and Cambodia were disposed of in Article 20 of the agreement, in which the North Vietnamese and the U.S. promised to respect the neutrality of both nations and to end their military intervention. Unfortunately, there was no means by which to enforce the agreement. That the North Vietnamese would uphold it, after violating two previous neutrality accords, [...] "took optimism bordering on an act <b>of</b> <b>faith</b> <b>that</b> they would now abandon the ambitions and struggles of thirty years because of a clumsily drafted afterthought in a document they had no intention of honoring anyway." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics.

Stack praised the performances by Colfer and O'Malley, as did USA Today Robert Bianco, who deemed the episode a [...] "smart, moving, musical exploration of the power and limits of faith and religion in a democratic society". Bianco commented positively on the way Colfer's singing was used to [...] "dig beneath the archness and anger in Kurt's behavior", calling it [...] "a textbook example of what music can add to drama." [...] Mark Perigard of the Boston Herald went further in his praise, deeming [...] "Grilled Cheesus" [...] "the perfect blend of music, characterization and plot - and easily the most provocative scripted hour in prime-time of the new season." [...] Perigard appreciated the fact there were no easy answers presented, with no characters undergoing religious conversions {{during the course of the}} episode. Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal felt that [...] "Grilled Cheesus" [...] succeeded in balancing opposing viewpoints, resulting in [...] "a nuanced, atypical episode of Glee that was both conflictingly emotional and confidently serious about the topic of religion", and Semigran similarly commended the episode's balance, writing that Falchuk [...] "covered both sides of controversial debate with grace, humor, and most importantly, respect." [...] In an article discussing Glee increasingly inconsistent tone, characterizations, and weird moments in the second season, film and television critic Matt Zoller Seitz cited [...] "Grilled Cheesus" [...] as an exception: [...] "an episode built around an earnest, Afterschool Special-style contemplation <b>of</b> <b>faith</b> <b>that</b> improbably turned out to be one of the series' boldest, silliest, maybe finest hours".|$|E
500|$|In the 1980s, President Ronald Reagan {{proposed}} {{creating a}} 600-ship navy {{as part of}} the overall defense department build-up to counter the threat of the armed forces of the Soviet Union; both the Soviet Army and Navy had grown {{in the aftermath of the}} unification of Vietnam in 1975 and the loss <b>of</b> <b>faith</b> <b>that</b> Americans had in their armed services. As part of this, all four Iowa-class battleships were modernized and reactivated. However, when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the 600-ship navy was seen as too costly to maintain, and so the navy made plans to return to its traditional 313-ship fleet. This led to the deactivation of many ships in the navy's fleet, including the four reactivated battleships; all were removed from service between 1990 and 1992. Originally, the navy had struck all four ships and made plans to donate them, however Congress intervened in this plan with the passing of the National Defense Authorization Act of 1996. Section 1011 required the United States Navy to reinstate to the Naval Vessel Register two of the Iowa-class battleships that had been struck by the navy in 1995; these ships were to be maintained in the United States Navy Reserve Fleets. The Navy was to ensure that both of the reinstated battleships were in good condition and could be reactivated for use in the Marine Corps' amphibious operations. Both battleships were to be maintained with the reserve fleet until such a time as the navy could certify that it had within its fleet the operational capacity to meet or exceed the gunfire support that both battleships could provide. To comply with this requirement, the navy selected the battleships [...] and [...] for reinstatement to the Naval Vessel Register.|$|E
