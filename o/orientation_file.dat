The {{aim of this study}} is to develop educational modules for UAS data processing in rapid 3 D mapping. The designed modules for this study are focused on UAV data processing from available freeware or trial software for education purpose. The key modules include orientation modelling, 3 D point clouds generation, image georeferencing and visualization. The orientation modelling modules adopts VisualSFM to determine the projection matrix for each image station. Besides, the approximate ground control points are measured from OpenStreetMap for absolute orientation. The second module uses SURE and the <b>orientation</b> <b>files</b> from previous module for 3 D point clouds generation. Then, the ground point selection and digital terrain model generation can be archived by LAStools. The third module stitches individual rectified images into a mosaic image using Microsoft ICE (Image Composite Editor). The last module visualizes and measures the generated dense point clouds in CloudCompare. These comprehensive UAS processing modules allow the students to gain the skills to process and deliver UAS photogrammetric products in rapid 3 D mapping. Moreover, they can also apply the photogrammetric products for analysis in practice...|$|R

Since the peaks represent the dominating structure, which is this case is {{the width of the}} ridges, an experiment was conducted to see that linkage more explicitly. A sequence of same dimension fingerprint images was created by increasing zoom values and center cropping the resultant image. For each of these images, an identical linear diffusion scheme with precomputed <b>orientation</b> <b>filed</b> was run to locate the desired peak in their respective entropy-change graphs. A plot in Fig. 17 is shown connecting logarithmic scale at which the process stopped and the average width of the ridges in the respective zoomed images. The graph in fig shows the dots, obtained from this experiment, and were fitted with a linear curve having 95 % confidence interval. The logarithmic scale, at which the diffusion process stopped, in turn, can provide the number of iterations knowing the step size involved in the diffusion process. Thus, given dimension of the input fingerprint and an estimate of the average ridge width, a reasonable guess at the computation complexity of the proposed stopping rule can be reached.|$|R

The different physiological characteristics are Fingerprint, DNA, Face, hand, retina, ear features, and odor, where as behavioral characteristics or features are typing rhythm, gait, gesture, and voice with the basic premise that all are unique and all human beings are identified by these intrinsic traits. In the physiological traits, Fingerprint is most commonly utilized the biometric feature in diverse fields for identification and verification purpose. Fingerprint features can be separated into three noteworthy classifications {{in view of the}} granularity at which they are removed as level 1, level 2, and level 3 features. Level 1 feature contains macro details, which are easily extractable and include <b>orientation</b> <b>filed,</b> ridge frequency filed and pattern configuration. Only these global features or Level 1 features are not sufficient to uniquely identify or recognize, but if these features are used along with level 2 or level 3 features, that can make the fingerprint recognition system more robust and secure. Level 1 features are used for image enhancement and orientation purpose. In this paper, we made a survey of existing literature on Level 1 features and try to analyze other researcher's contribution to this field...|$|R

Part quality in the rapid prototyping process {{is a function of}} build parameters such as hatch cure depth, layer thickness, <b>orientation,</b> hatch <b>file,</b> hatch spacing and part characteristics. Thus an attempt was made to identify study and optimize the process parameters governing the system which are related to part characteristics using Taguchi experimental design techniques-quality. The part characteristics can be divided into part physical characteristics and mechanical characteristics. The physical characteristics are surface finish, dimensional accuracy, distortion, layer thickness, hatch cure, and hatch file whereas, mechanical characteristics are flexural strength, ultimate tensile strength and impact strength. Thus, the paper proposes to characterize the influence of the physical build parameters over the part quality. An orthogonal array of experiment was developed which has the least number of experimental runs with desired process parameter settings and also by analysis tools such as ANOVA (Analysis of Variance). Establishment of experimentally verified correlations between the physical part characteristics and mechanical part characteristics to obtain an optimal process parameter level for betterment of part quality is obtained. The process model obtained by the empirical relation can be used to determine the strength of the prototype for the given set of parameters that shows the dependency of strength, which are essential for designers and RP machine users...|$|R
40|$|Plants are sessile {{organisms in}} need to {{acclimate}} {{to the changes}} in the surrounding environment by changing their metabolism and growth behavior. Responses to external stimuli such as gravity, light, or touch can result in tightly coordinated growth responses, regulating the final shape and size of an organ. The coordination of organ growth has to occur on several levels. Plant cells are surrounded by a rigid cell wall, which governs final cell shape and cell size. These walls allow for expansion by deposition and loosening of cell wall material; and simultaneously for directionality through alignment of the load-bearing cellulose fibrils. At the same time, these cell walls generate a connecting matrix that links adjacent cells and requires for these cells to grow in units, so called symplastic growth. ^ In plants with helical aligned cell files along axial organs, this connection through the cell wall is thought to cause cells to rotate in-phase around the organ axis, with a decrease of cell file length and angle towards organ axis from the outer cell layers inwards. At the same time, if cell anisotropy is not altered, the organ diameter increases dependent on the angle described by the cell files. ^ In addition to these biomechanical constraints imposed on cells within one organ, cell directionality also affects organ growth behavior. If elongating cells are oriented helically around an axial organ, their growth axis is not aligned with the organs growth axis. The cell growth vector can be divided into its components parallel and perpendicular to the organ growth axis, the first one drives organ growth, the second a rotation of the organ tip, both in an angle dependent manner. Organ growth is decreased, most likely due to the parallel vector component being shorter than the cell growth vector. ^ Cell directionality is regulated by several cellular factors. Cortical microtubules are positioned along the plasma membrane of the cell. In elongating cells they are organized in parallel arrays, approximately perpendicular to the growth axis of the cell, forming 2 ̆ 2 hoop-like 2 ̆ 2 structures around the cell. They are thought to guide cellulose producing enzyme complexes into and within the plasma membrane, resulting in cellulose fibrils being aligned in a similar manner. Cellulose fibril alignment in turn guides turgor pressure driven expansion, and thus directionality of cell expansion. In this work, the mutant twd 1, defective in a FKBP-like immunophilin that displays a helical cell <b>file</b> <b>orientation,</b> was used to elucidate relationships between cell-cell and cell-organ growth, as well as to investigate cortical microtubules and cell wall components in regard to the altered cell <b>file</b> <b>orientation.</b> ...|$|R

I then evaluated the stress change pattern for an effective {{coefficient of friction}} μ ranging from 0.2 to 0.7 and a depth from 1 to 20  km. The estimated ΔCFF is shown in Additional file 6 : Fig. S 6 a. To further evaluate sensitivity to horizontal position errors of the hypocenter, I shifted the epicenter to four directions (northward, southward, westward, and eastward) and calculated ΔCFF for each case in the same manner. The standard deviation of the hypocenter is 260  m in latitude and 310  m in longitude, respectively, and thus, I here shifted to 0.5  km, equivalent to 2 σ, in each <b>orientation</b> (Additional <b>file</b> 6 : Fig S 6 b–e). Warm and cold colors represent positive and negative signs, signifying facilitated or suppressed fault slip, respectively. In and around {{the depth of the}} hypocenter (12  km), the ΔCFF values tend to be positive with higher μ and negative with lower μ. Although I cannot definitively conclude that the main shock was triggered by the static stress change, it seems possible that the foreshocks promoted the main shock. On the other hand, the ΔCFF values have positive signs deeper than 17  km for any μ, suggesting that fault slips are robustly promoted at depth near the lower edge of the so-called seismogenic zone. Also in other cases, it can be identified that a fault slip tends to be promoted in the deep rather than the shallow (Additional file 6 : Fig. S 6 b–e) although there are slight differences at some points. Of course, care must be taken with these estimates because the source and the receiver faults are near to one another and thus the estimate is sensitive to the position and the given slip mechanism. To clarify this, further study on the rupture for the main shock is vital for developing our understanding of this issue in the future.|$|R
