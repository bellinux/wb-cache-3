5000|$|A {{critical}} component of operating affordable housing is managing a project’s financing. [...] Developers create an operating model to determine a property’s financial viability through projected future cash flows.

[...] Positive <b>operating</b> <b>income</b> is necessary to cover the mortgage payments on the property and if income {{is not enough to}} cover debt than the bank can foreclose on the property. [...] Lenders measure the ability of a project’s <b>operating</b> <b>income</b> to make mortgage payments by using a debt-service-coverage ratio, which is a calculation of annual <b>operating</b> <b>income</b> divided by annual mortgage payments; the higher the ratio the lower the risk of project foreclosure.|$|R
