5|$|Gillibrand had {{numerous}} potential challengers in the September 14, 2010, Democratic primary election. Some were obvious {{at the time}} of her appointment. Most notably, Long Island Congresswoman Carolyn McCarthy was unhappy with Gillibrand's stance <b>on</b> <b>gun</b> <b>control,</b> but McCarthy ultimately decided not to run. Harold Ford, Jr., a former Congressman from Tennessee, considered a run but ultimately decided against it in March 2009. Congressman Steve Israel was also a potential contender but was talked out of it by President Obama.|$|E

5|$|Tierney first ran for Congress in 1994 against one-term Republican {{incumbent}} Peter G. Torkildsen, {{having won}} a competitive Democratic primary with {{a plurality of}} 33.8 percent. He ran on a platform promoting a stronger federal focus on drug abuse, federal aid to promote after-school programs, consideration of means testing for Social Security, and single-payer health care. A primary issue in the campaign was crime: Tierney criticized Torkildsen for his vote against a 1994 crime bill, and advocated stronger gun control, while Torkildsen criticized Tierney's positions <b>on</b> <b>gun</b> <b>control</b> and drug legalization. Tierney was defeated {{in the general election}} by 4%. Tierney successfully ran for Congress in 1996, defeating Torkildsen by a narrow margin and increasing his margin in a 1998 rematch. Over the next five elections, Tierney won with over 68% of the vote. In 2010, he faced a stronger challenge from Republican candidate Bill Hudak, after his wife Patrice was convicted of felony tax fraud; he won with 57% of the vote.|$|E

25|$|In the Democratic primary, several {{high-profile}} Democrats {{considered a}} run, including incumbent U. S. Congressmen Les AuCoin and Jim Weaver and Portland mayor Neil Goldschmidt, but ultimately {{opted not to}} challenge the incumbent Packwood. In October 1979, Ted Kulongoski, a labor lawyer and state senator from Junction City, became the first major candidate to declare his candidacy, claiming that Packwood was beholden to large corporate special interests. Kulongoski had the field to himself until March, when former two-term U. S. Congressman Charles O. Porter joined the race. Porter, a Eugene attorney, was a supporter of Edward Kennedy's bid for President and planned to campaign on a strong anti-war platform. Porter and Kulongski agreed on most major issues, clashing only <b>on</b> <b>gun</b> <b>control</b> and nationalization of energy resources, both of which Porter favored and Kulongoski opposed. Though the race {{was expected to be}} close, Kulongoski defeated Porter handily by a 5–2 margin.|$|E

Yet a high level of gun ownership alone does not make the U.

40|$|This book {{examines}} {{lawsuits against}} the gun industry {{within the context}} of two larger controversies {{at the top of the}} nation 2 ̆ 7 s domestic political agenda: <b>gun</b> <b>control</b> and tort reform. Throughout, discussion of the litigation is framed by two questions. The first, central to the debate over <b>gun</b> <b>control,</b> is whether regulating the firearms industry can reduce gun violence. The second, underlying the disagreement about tort reform, is what role, if any, courts should play in the creation of public policies such as <b>gun</b> <b>control.</b> The chapters that follow offer a variety of perspectives <b>on</b> <b>gun</b> violence, <b>gun</b> <b>control,</b> the <b>gun</b> industry, gun litigation, and the use of gun litigation as a regulatory tool. The book does not seek to resolve the tensions between these different perspectives, but rather to deepen appreciation of them and the ways in which they sometimes complement and sometimes clash with each other. Thus, while the book seeks to advance discussion about the litigation by providing insight into the diversity of views driving it, it does not pretend to offer a solution...|$|R
