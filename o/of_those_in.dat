5|$|Educational {{attainment}} varied greatly {{depending on}} occupational field with 68% <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> {{the professional and}} professional support fields having a bachelor's degree or higher, compared to only 31.6% of those employed in sales and 11.6% <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> the service sector. Considering {{the fact that the}} average American does not have a bachelor's degree, he or she is most likely employed in the service, sales, and office support fields with many working in the professional support and business fields as well. All together the American economy and labor force have changed greatly since the middle of the 20th. century with most workers today being employed in office and service occupations.|$|E

5|$|After the Belgian defeat, around 225,000 Belgian {{soldiers}} (around 30 {{percent of}} the total force mobilised in 1940) who had been made prisoners of war in 1940 were sent to prisoner of war camps in Germany. The majority <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> captivity (145,000) were Flemish, and 80,000 were Walloons. Most had been reservists, rather than professional soldiers, before the outbreak of war and their detention created a large labour shortage in civilian occupations.|$|E

5|$|Despite the orders, a {{relatively}} small number of people evacuated for the hurricane. According to a telephone survey conducted by the United States Department of Commerce, the highest participation rate was for residents in the Northern Neck in areas potentially affected by the storm surge from a Category2 hurricane, of which 41% in the survey stated they left their houses for a safer location. In Surry, only 9% <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> a Category2 hurricane storm surge zone left. 30% who participated in the survey along the Eastern Shore left. The primary reasons for the choice whether to evacuate or not were due to the track of Isabel, its strength, or influence from the media. Most participants in the survey stated they did not hear any sort of evacuation notice from public officials in their location, however. Of those who evacuated, about 64% left for the house of a friend or a relative, with about 24% evacuating to a hotel or a motel. Most <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> Hampton and Norfolk left for elsewhere in the state, while the majority <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> the Northern Neck evacuated to destinations in their own neighborhood or community. The evacuation destinations on the Eastern Shore of Virginia were varied, with 23% leaving for Maryland and 46% staying in their own neighborhood or community. The length of the evacuation process varied between a few hours to two days, with the worst evacuation problems being closed or flooded roads. The Virginia Army National Guard and State Police troopers assisted in the evacuations. In all, more than 160,000 residents in southeastern Virginia were told to evacuate, including 11,000 in vulnerable locations along the Chesapeake Bay and all residents in mobile home parks in Chesapeake and Newport News. A total of about 16,325people evacuated to 67 shelters. Some of the reported problems were shortages of supplies, unanticipated medical issues, overcrowding, and lack of security.|$|E

Eastwood introduces voices reminiscent <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> a horror film score during the child murder flashbacks. The score was orchestrated and conducted by Lennie Niehaus.

5|$|Genetic drift (also {{known as}} allelic drift or the Sewall Wright effect after {{biologist}} Sewall Wright) {{is the change}} in the frequency of an existing gene variant (allele) in a population due to random sampling of organisms. The alleles in the offspring are a sample <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> the parents, and chance has a role in determining whether a given individual survives and reproduces. A population's allele frequency is the fraction of the copies of one gene that share a particular form. Genetic drift may cause gene variants to disappear completely and thereby reduce genetic variation.|$|E

5|$|Many <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> {{the protest}} {{movements}} were young {{children at the}} time of the invasion and had been educated under the Indonesian system.

Seeking help from Portugal for self-determination, they considered Indonesia an occupying force. Abroad, Fretilin's members—most notably former journalist José Ramos-Horta (later to be Prime Minister and President)—pushed their cause in diplomatic forums.|$|E

5|$|The medieval era Jain logicians Akalanka and Vidyananda, {{who were}} likely contemporaries of Adi Shankara, {{acknowledged}} many issues with anekantavada in their texts. For example, Akalanka in his Pramanasamgraha acknowledges seven problems when anekantavada {{is applied to}} develop a comprehensive and consistent philosophy: dubiety, contradiction, lack of conformity of bases (vaiyadhi karanya), joint fault, infinite regress, intermixture and absence. Vidyananda acknowledged six <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> the Akalanka list, adding the problem of vyatikara (cross breeding in ideas) and apratipatti (incomprehensibility). Prabhācandra, who probably lived in the 11th-century, and several other later Jain scholars accepted many of these identified issues in anekantavada application.|$|E
