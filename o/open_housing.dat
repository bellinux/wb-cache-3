25|$|In 1967, Johnson {{nominated}} {{civil rights}} attorney Thurgood Marshall {{to be the first}} African American Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. To head the new Department of Housing and Urban Development, Johnson appointed Robert C. Weaver—the first African-American cabinet secretary in any U.S. presidential administration. In 1968 Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1968, which provided for equal housing opportunities regardless of race, creed, or national origin. The impetus for the law's passage came from the 1966 Chicago <b>Open</b> <b>Housing</b> Movement, the April 4, 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King,Jr., and the civil unrest across the country following King's death. On April 5, Johnson {{wrote a letter to the}} United States House of Representatives urging passage of the Fair Housing Act. With newly urgent attention from legislative director Joseph Califano and Democratic Speaker of the House John McCormack, the bill (which was previously stalled) passed the House by a wide margin on April 10.|$|E

He was the author of the [...] "Mathias Amendment" [...] to the unsuccessful 1966 civil rights bill on <b>open</b> <b>housing.</b> Concerning environmental issues, Mathias sponsored legislation to make the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal a national park, and supported other conservation initiatives along the Potomac River. He also served on the Judiciary Committee and the Committee on the District of Columbia. As a member of the D.C.

500|$|Nunn {{doubled the}} {{accommodations}} {{in the state}} park system. Barren River Lake State Resort Park was completed during his tenure, and three other parks were planned and funded during his administration. He also greatly improved the state mental health system. Under his leadership, a statewide network of 22 mental health centers was completed, and all four state psychiatric hospitals were accredited for the first time. Nunn called the revamping of the state mental health system his proudest accomplishment as governor. There was not total agreement between Nunn and the legislature, however. The governor vetoed one-quarter of the bills passed in the 1968 legislative session and 14 percent of those passed in the 1970 session. An <b>open</b> <b>housing</b> bill became law without Nunn's signature, and he also refused to sign the 1970 state budget {{as a form of}} protest. (Unsigned bills become law after ten days under the Kentucky Constitution, in contrast to the pocket veto provision in the federal constitution.) ...|$|E
500|$|Initially a {{front runner}} for the Republican {{nomination}} for President of the United States in the 1968 election, he proved an ineffective campaigner and fell behind Richard Nixon in polls. After a mid-1967 remark that his earlier {{support for the}} Vietnam War had been due to a [...] "brainwashing" [...] by U.S. military and diplomatic officials in Vietnam, his campaign faltered even more and he withdrew from the contest in early 1968. After Nixon's election as president, he appointed Romney as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. [...] Romney's ambitious plans for housing production increases for the poor, and for <b>open</b> <b>housing</b> to desegregate suburbs, were modestly successful but often thwarted by Nixon. [...] Romney left the administration {{at the start of}} Nixon's second term in 1973. [...] Returning to private life, he advocated volunteerism and public service, and headed the National Center for Voluntary Action and its successor organizations from 1973 through 1991.

500|$|When the <b>open</b> <b>housing</b> {{proposal}} became public, local {{reaction was}} often hostile. [...] Such {{was the reaction}} of many residents in Warren, Michigan, a predominately white blue-collar suburb of Detroit. While it had no formal discriminatory laws, most blacks were excluded by zoning practices, refusals to sell to them, and intimidatory actions of white property owners, {{many of whom were}} ethnic Polish and Catholic and had moved to the suburb as part of white flight. By this time, Detroit was 40–50 percent black. [...] HUD made Warren a prime target for Open Communities enforcement and threatened to halt all federal assistance to the town unless it took a series of actions to end racial discrimination there; town officials said progress was being made and that their citizens resented forced integration. [...] Romney rejected this response, partly because when he was governor, Warren residents had thrown rocks and garbage and yelled obscenities for days at a biracial couple who moved into town. [...] Now the secretary said, [...] "The youth of this nation, the minorities of this nation, the discriminated of this nation are not going to wait for 'nature to take its course.' What is really at issue here is responsibility– moral responsibility." ...|$|E

2500|$|Two {{developments}} {{revived the}} bill. [...] The Kerner Commission {{report on the}} 1967 ghetto riots strongly recommended [...] "a comprehensive and enforceable federal <b>open</b> <b>housing</b> law", and was cited regularly by congress members arguing for the legislation. The final breakthrough came with the April 4, 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King,Jr., and the civil unrest across the country following King's death. On April 5, Johnson {{wrote a letter to}} the United States House of Representatives urging passage of the Fair Housing Act. The Rules Committee, [...] "jolted by the repeated civil disturbances virtually outside its door," [...] finally ended its hearings on April 8. With newly urgent attention from legislative director Joseph Califano and Democratic Speaker of the House John McCormack, the bill (which was previously stalled) passed the House by a wide margin on April 10.|$|E
2500|$|Five {{days after}} the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was signed into law, the Watts Riots {{occurred}} in Hawkins' district. It {{was the first of}} many race riots in the 1960s. Hawkins urged his colleagues in Congress to increase antipoverty funds, but did not condone the violence. Due to his light skin and heightened racial tensions, Hawkins had to be careful when he visited his district shortly after the riots. The riots stalled the Great Society, particularly over the fair housing; blacks who benefited from Great Society laws were blamed as being harmful to the [...] "law and order" [...] of America, particularly if they were allowed to live next to whites. Fair housing was still an unpopular issue in America: Democratic Senate nominee Pierre Salinger lost to Republican George Murphy in California over the issue, marking the only Republican pickup amid Lyndon Johnson's crushing presidential victory over anti-civil rights Barry Goldwater in 1964. <b>Open</b> <b>housing</b> reform seemed next on the Great Society list after the Voting Rights Act was signed, but the Watts Riot put it on hold. It was not passed until after the 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.|$|E
2500|$|Poles in Chicago {{were against}} the <b>open</b> <b>housing</b> efforts of Martin Luther King, Jr., who {{encouraged}} black integration into Polish urban communities; his policies and resulting integration efforts led to violent riots between Poles and Blacks in 1966 and 1967, particularly in Detroit. In 1968, a local {{president of the}} Chicago Polish Homeowner's Association raised a flag from half-mast to full-mast {{on the day of}} MLK's death, nearly sparking a riot. Polish homeowners in Hamtramck were given a legal blow in 1971 when a Michigan federal court ruled against their urban renewal efforts which had effectively decreased the community's black population. The experience created a rift between Polish Americans and political liberalism; Poles were labeled as racist by white liberals who had already fled to the suburbs and did not have any connection to the violence and urban warfare facing Polish American communities. Poles were similarly disgusted by the affirmative action programs institutionalized in their workplaces and schools, and were unfairly blamed for historical slavery and the economic and political disenfranchisement of blacks in America. Race relations between whites and blacks had been poor in many cities, but through the progress of the Civil Rights movement, anti-Black discrimination became highly unacceptable but anti-Polish discrimination did not have the same legal safeguards. Highly offensive jokes commonly replaced the word [...] "black" [...] or [...] "nigger" [...] with [...] "Polack".
