40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} problem <b>of</b> <b>protesting</b> crowd simulation. It {{considers}} CROCADILE, an agent based distillation system, for this purpose. A model <b>of</b> <b>protesting</b> crowd was determined {{and then a}} CROCADILE model <b>of</b> <b>protesting</b> crowd was engineered and demonstrated. We validated the model by using two scenarios where protesters are varied with different personalities. The results indicated that CROCADILE served well as the platform for protesting crowd modeling simulationComment: 3 pages, ISCRAM-VN 201...|$|R

5|$|A number <b>of</b> <b>protests</b> {{were held}} against the law, both locally and internationally. Activists {{demonstrated}} outside New York City's Lincoln Center {{at the opening}} night of the Metropolitan Opera on 23 September 2013, which was set to feature Tchaikovsky's opera Eugene Onegin.

5|$|In mid-May, Operation Trio was {{followed}} by the joint Italian-Chetnik offensive against Partisan detachments within the Italian zone of occupation in eastern Herzegovina and Montenegro, with similar effects: the Partisans lost almost all of the liberated territory in these areas. This offensive is also considered part of the Third Enemy Offensive in Yugoslav historiography. After Operation Trio, NDH forces remained south of the demarcation line between the German and Italian zones of occupation, in spite <b>of</b> <b>protests</b> from the Italians.|$|E
5|$|Suppressed {{during the}} era of {{communist}} Poland, {{after the fall of}} communism in Poland, Dmowski's legacy has begun to be more widely recognized. A bridge in Wrocław was named after him in 1992. In November 2006 statue of Roman Dmowski was unveiled in Warsaw; it had led to a series <b>of</b> <b>protests</b> from organizations which see Dmowski as fascist and opponent of tolerance; due to similar protests plans to raise statues or memorials elsewhere have commonly been delayed.|$|E

40|$|Political protest {{plays an}} {{ambiguous}} {{role in the}} repertoire of political action. This essay examines cross-national levels <b>of</b> <b>protest.</b> With data from the new 1999 - 2002 wave of the World Values Survey, we test theories <b>of</b> <b>protest</b> derived from relative deprivation theory, political opportunity structures and political culture. The WVS enables us to test these theories on a near global scale with data from nearly 70 national surveys, comparing how the nature <b>of</b> <b>protest</b> potentially varies cross-nationally. We find that the primary sources <b>of</b> <b>protest</b> reflect the existing of resources and political opportunities to engage in protest activity. People protest {{not because they are}} frustrated and excluded from politics, but because the can protest and they expect governments to respond to their actions...|$|R

5|$|The {{situation}} {{changed when}} Sadat, {{in the face}} <b>of</b> <b>protests</b> from his senior commanders, ordered an offensive to seize the strategic Sinai mountain passes, hoping to relieve Israeli pressure on the Syrians. The resulting offensive was ill-planned and ill-executed, culminating in heavy Egyptian losses without achieving any of its objectives. This gave the Israelis the initiative to launch a counteroffensive.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, {{increasing}} anti-British sentiment {{spread throughout}} the Arab World and led to riots in Bahrain. The riots focused on the Jewish community. In 1948, following rising hostilities and looting, most members of Bahrain's Jewish community abandoned their properties and evacuated to Bombay, later settling in Israel (Pardes Hanna-Karkur) and the United Kingdom. , 37 Jews remained in the country. In the 1950s, the National Union Committee, formed by reformists following sectarian clashes, demanded an elected popular assembly, removal of Belgrave and carried out a number <b>of</b> <b>protests</b> and general strikes. In 1965 a month-long uprising broke out after hundreds of workers at the Bahrain Petroleum Company were laid off.|$|E
5|$|After the December {{completion}} of the 2010 presidential election, Lukashenko was elected to a fourth straight term with nearly 80% {{of the vote in}} elections. The runner-up opposition leader Andrei Sannikov received less than 3% of the vote; independent observers criticized the election as fraudulent. When opposition protesters took to the streets in Minsk, many people, including most rival presidential candidates, were beaten and arrested by the state militia. Many of the candidates, including Sannikov, were sentenced to prison or house arrest for terms which are mainly and typically over four years. Six months later amid an unprecedented economic crisis, activists utilized social networking to initiate a fresh round <b>of</b> <b>protests</b> characterized by wordless hand-clapping.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to explain the}} rates <b>of</b> European <b>protest</b> in three core countries of the EEC/EU � the Belgium, France, and Germany � over a sixteen-year period from 1980 to 1995 based on their institutional differences {{as suggested by the}} literature on political opportunity structures. First, the findings support the notion of a Europeanization <b>of</b> <b>protest</b> that is spurred by the changing constellation of national vs. supranational powers in the wake of European integration. The Europeanization <b>of</b> <b>protest</b> occurs, displaying systematic cross-national differences. These differences are, as the results suggest, related to the differential between the constraints of the actors' domestic environments and the common-to-all evolving opportunities on the level of European politics. Secondly, the findings suggest that the rates <b>of</b> <b>protest</b> in cross-national perspective are not simply random. The macro-political structure plays a (statistically) significant, logically consistent, and visible role in the explanatory bundle leading to occurrence or absence <b>of</b> <b>protest</b> actions. protest; political opportunity structure; participation; Belgium; France; Germany; political science...|$|R
5|$|Buddhist discontent erupted {{following}} a ban in early May on flying the Buddhist flag in Huế on Vesak, {{the birthday of}} Gautama Buddha. Just days before, Catholics had been encouraged to fly the Vatican flag at a celebration for Archbishop Ngô Đình Thục of Huế, Diệm's elder brother. A large crowd of Buddhists protested the ban, defying the government by flying Buddhist flags on the Buddhist holy day of Vesak and marching on the government broadcasting station. Government forces fired into the crowd of protesters, killing nine people. Diệm's refusal to take responsibility — he blamed the Viet Cong for the deaths — led to further Buddhist protests and calls for religious equality. As Diem remained unwilling to comply with Buddhist demands, the frequency <b>of</b> <b>protests</b> increased.|$|E
5|$|Developed in the 2000s at an {{investment}} of US$2 million after IDF commitments for 1,200 units, some AIL jobs {{were believed to be}} in jeopardy following a mid-2005 announcement that the IDF would purchase 100 US sold Land Rover Defender-based MDT David. The announcement provoked threats <b>of</b> <b>protests</b> from AIL's management and labourers, who had recently faced the blow of local Humvee assembly ceasing due to budget considerations. The MDT David was chosen over the armoured version of the Storm because the heavy Storm was said to suffer from handling and reliability problems, safety hazards and limited mission operability. However the IDF said that the purchase of the David was to fill a temporary gap in production until the Storm II's testing was completed, and has since begun filling its commitment.|$|E
5|$|I'm Going to Tell You a Secret is a 2005 American {{documentary}} film that follows singer-songwriter Madonna on her 2004 Re-Invention World Tour. Directed by Jonas Åkerlund, the film premiered on MTV on October 21, 2005, {{and was released}} on DVD on June 20, 2006, by Warner Bros. Records. The documentary was originally called The Re-Invented Process, referencing the tour and the Steven Klein exhibition titled X-STaTIC Pro=CeSS. It starts with imagery from the exhibition and Madonna auditioning dancers for the tour, continues with her entourage travelling through different cities and performing, the singer's introspection on her life, her marriage, her religion, and her children, and ends with Madonna's visit to Israel in the midst <b>of</b> <b>protests.</b>|$|E
40|$|Using a {{multilevel}} dataset of seventy-five European street demonstrations (2009 - 13), we {{assess how}} demonstrators evaluate {{the interactions between}} the police and other demonstrators. In doing so, we study demonstrators' perceptions <b>of</b> the <b>protest</b> atmosphere. Understanding these atmosphere assessments is relevant, as demonstrators and other protest actors (e. g., police and the media) widely refer to the atmosphere (i. e., mood or climate) <b>of</b> <b>protest</b> events. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, scholars have not yet studied this aspect <b>of</b> <b>protest</b> participation. We start our study with a conceptualization and operationalization <b>of</b> <b>protest</b> atmosphere. Subsequently, we assess how demonstrators perceive atmosphere. Our analyses reveal that four types <b>of</b> <b>protest</b> atmospheres can be distinguished: harmonious, volatile, tense, and chaotic. We describe examples of these atmospheres and study why they are perceived. We find that the perception of atmosphere by demonstrators is influenced by individual characteristics (e. g., age) and demonstration characteristics (e. g., police repression) ...|$|R

5|$|In 1906, the Transvaal {{government}} promulgated a new Act compelling {{registration of}} the colony's Indian and Chinese populations. At a mass protest meeting held in Johannesburg on 11 September that year, Gandhi adopted his still evolving methodology of Satyagraha (devotion to the truth), or nonviolent protest, {{for the first}} time. The idea of nonviolence was ultimately bolstered when Gandhi {{was inspired by a}} letter written to Tarak Nath Das by the Russian pacifist Leo Tolstoy on 14 December 1908, which introduced Gandhi to the ancient Indian moral literature of the Tirukkural. He urged Indians to defy the new law and to suffer the punishments for doing so. Gandhi's ideas <b>of</b> <b>protests,</b> persuasion skills and public relations had emerged. He took these back to India in 1915.|$|E
5|$|In 1926, WWV {{was nearly}} shut down. Its signal could only cover {{the eastern half}} of the United States, and other {{stations}} located in Minneapolis and at Stanford University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology were slowly making WWV redundant. The station's impending shutdown was announced in 1926, but it was saved by a flood <b>of</b> <b>protests</b> from citizens who relied on the service. Later, in 1931, WWV underwent an upgrade. Its transmitter, now directly controlled by a quartz oscillator, was moved to College Park, Maryland. Broadcasts began on 5MHz. A year later, the station was moved again, to Department of Agriculture land in Beltsville, Maryland. Broadcasts were added on 10 and 15MHz, power was increased, and time signals, an A440 tone, and ionosphere reports were all added to the broadcast in June 1937.|$|E
5|$|Later that year, Europe {{experienced}} a series <b>of</b> <b>protests,</b> rebellions and often violent upheavals that {{became known as}} the Revolutions of 1848. In France, a revolution led to the overthrow of the monarchy and the establishment of the French Second Republic. Marx was supportive of such activity and having recently received a substantial inheritance from his father (withheld by his uncle Lionel Philips since his father's death in 1838) of either 6,000 or 5,000 francs he allegedly used a third of it to arm Belgian workers who were planning revolutionary action. Although the veracity of these allegations is disputed, the Belgian Ministry of Justice accused Marx of it, subsequently arresting him and he was forced to flee back to France, where with a new republican government in power he believed that he would be safe.|$|E
