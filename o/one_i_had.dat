5|$|This <b>one</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{the most}} amount of input. I oversaw everything—the {{building}} of the sets, everyone's costumes, I had meetings with make-up and hair and the cinematographer, everybody. Casting, finding the right cat—just every aspect. Kind of like making a little movie. We basically sat down and just threw out all every idea we could possibly conceive of {{and of all the}} things we wanted. All the imagery we wanted—and I had a few set ideas, for instance the cat and the idea of Metropolis. I definitely wanted to have that influence, that look on all the men—the workers, diligently, methodically working away.|$|E

Well, the cinematographer, in a sense, was right because I did not follow the conventions of film making that he had become accustomed to.|$|E

His height was reported variously as , , and [...] Heikkinen was described by the Detroit News as a “pigmy” compared to Michigan’s last great guard, Albert Benbrook, who was [...] and more than [...] He was also described as “the stock atom,” and the “pint-sized” lineman. But Heikkinen viewed his size as an asset: “My size had been a help rather than a hindrance. It is easier for a small man {{to pull out of}} the line and run interference than a big <b>one.</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> no trouble out-charging big men; it was the small men who gave me all the trouble.” ...|$|E

500|$|I {{always loved}} going to Ogmore and Southerndown. I thought the cliffs there {{looked like a}} {{building}} anyway. A building capable of withstanding the roughest weather for hundreds of years. The older they get, the better they look. I wondered {{if it would be}} possible to make a building which had the same qualities as these magnificent cliffs. To do that I needed a lot of stone. Normal stone for buildings has to be specially cut into blocks; it takes a long time to make and costs a fortune. But in north Wales the historic slate industry has left behind whole mountains of waste stone that no-one wants. This was stone cut from the mountainside for nearly two hundred years but which wasn't good enough to make roof slates. Over 90% was thrown away. But it was ideal for making walls like the <b>one</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> in mind... —architect Jonathan Adams ...|$|E

500|$|Celine Dion {{performed}} the song {{as part of}} her A New Day... concert at Caesars Palace. The song appeared on her 2002 studio album, A New Day Has Come, and on her 2004 live album, A New Day... Live in Las Vegas. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic said that the decision to include [...] "Nature Boy" [...] in A New Day Has Come was inspired by the song's appearance in Baz Luhrmann's musical, Moulin Rouge! (2001). With Billboard, Dion expressed her feelings while recording the track: [...] "This is the <b>one</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> the most kick out of in the studio. I could hear the pedal of the piano and the touch of the keys while I was singing. We were following each other, this is the real thing. This was such my pleasure." [...] Initially strings and other instrumentation were added in post-production, but were later removed to maintain the simplicity of Cole's version.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{previous}} {{guest actor}} Leonard Nimoy's recent retirement, the writers still had plot lines concerning his character William Bell. Some {{months prior to}} the airing of [...] "Stowaway", Nimoy and others had noted that Bell's character would return to Fringe. Anna Torv, who portrays Olivia, was not aware that her character would be channeling Bell until just prior to filming of the episode, and stated of the role, [...] "This is not <b>one</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been asking for!" [...] To prepare, Torv sought advice from her fellow star John Noble, as both as a friend and because Noble's character, Walter, had spent the most time with Bell. She took further advice from the show's dialect coach and reviewed footage of Nimoy's previous work, though eventually she decided to jump right into the role. Noble later commented [...] "I think the solutions she came up with – taking the essence of the man, playing with the eyebrows, simulating the voice — were really smart. We {{had a lot of fun}} doing it." ...|$|E
500|$|In a 2005, {{interview}} with About.com, Burton {{spoke about the}} differences between directing [...] Corpse Bride and The Nightmare Before Christmas, saying: [...] "The difference on that was that <b>one</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> designed completely. It was a very completed package in my mind. I felt like it was there. I felt more comfortable with it. With this, it was a bit more organic. It was based on an old folk tale. We kept kind of changing it but, you know, I had a great co-director with Mike Johnson. I feel like we complemented each other quite well. It was just a different movie, a different process." [...] He also spoke about casting Johnny Depp as Victor, saying: [...] "It was weird because we were doing both at the same time. He was Willy Wonka by day and Victor by night so {{it might have been a}} little schizophrenic for him. But he’s great. It's the first animated movie he's done and he's always into a challenge. We just treat it like fun and a creative process. Again, that’s the joy of working with him. He's kind of up for anything. He just always adds something to it. The amazing thing is all the actors never worked [...] They were never in a room together, so they were all doing their voices, except for Albert [...] and Joanna [...] did a few scenes together, everybody else was separate. They were all kind of working in a vacuum, which was interesting. That’s the thing that I felt ended up so beautifully, that their performances really meshed together. So he was very canny, as they all were, about trying to find the right tone and making it work while not being in the same room with each other." ...|$|E

2500|$|Much of Gerda Mayer's poetry {{draws on}} the trauma of her {{uprooting}} and loss of family in 1939, but her creativity was apparent many years before that. In fact her first poem was composed {{when she was just}} four years old and was recorded by her father in a Babys Tagebuch (German equivalent of [...] "Baby Diary"), a journal he had kept from her birth until her departure from Prague that year. At school in England her reading was soon on a par with that of her classmates but the poetry took much longer to catch up, as she recalled in 2009: [...] "My first English poem, written at the age of twelve was no better than <b>one</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> composed (in my pre-literacy days) at the age of four ... and a poem I wrote at the age of sixteen was on a level with <b>one</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> written at the age of eleven, just before leaving home." ...|$|E

Opeth ordered the orchid seen on the cover from the Netherlands. The first pressing was released without the [...] "Opeth" [...] logo on the front cover. The photographs on the back were taken in Sörskogen.

2500|$|On {{the morning}} of the 20th of last month, in the choir, after I had celebrated Mass I yielded to a {{drowsiness}} similar to a sweet sleep. [...] I saw before me a mysterious person similar to the <b>one</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> seen on the evening of 5 August. The only difference was that his hands and feet and side were dripping blood. This sight terrified me and what I felt at that moment is indescribable. I thought I should have died if the Lord had not intervened and strengthened my heart which was about to burst out of my chest. The vision disappeared and I became aware that my hands, feet and side were dripping blood. Imagine the agony I experienced and continue to experience almost every day. The heart wound bleeds continually, especially from Thursday evening until Saturday. Dear Father, I am dying of pain because of the wounds and the resulting embarrassment I feel deep in my soul. I am afraid I shall bleed to death if the Lord does not hear my heartfelt supplication to relieve me of this condition. Will Jesus, who is so good, grant me this grace? Will he at least free me from the embarrassment caused by these outward signs? I will raise my voice and will not stop imploring him until in his mercy he takes away, not the wound or the pain, which is impossible since I wish to be inebriated with pain, but these outward signs which cause me such embarrassment and unbearable humiliation....the pain was so intense that I began to feel as if I were dying on the cross.|$|E
