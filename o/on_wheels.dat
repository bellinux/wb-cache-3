(2) Analyze the variety of spark plug to the torque and engine power on Yamaha Mio Soul motorcycle 2010. Based on the research can be concluded that: (1) The using of Ignition Booster could increase torque and engine power <b>on</b> <b>wheel</b> axis. Its because of the using of Ignition Booster could repair ignition system, So the torque and engine power <b>on</b> <b>wheel</b> axis increase. (2) The using of variety spark plug could increase torque and engine power <b>on</b> <b>wheel</b> axis. Its because of better electrode design on spark plug could increase fire fragment quality, so the torque and engine power <b>on</b> <b>wheel</b> axis increase. (3) The using of Ignition Booster and variety of spark plug could increase torque and engine power <b>on</b> <b>wheel</b> axis. Its because of the using of Ignition Booster could repair combustion system and better electrode design on spark plug could increase fire fragment quality, so the torque and engine power <b>on</b> <b>wheel</b> axis increase. (4) Maximum torque obtained with use ignition booster and Iridium Spark plug, which is 4. 95 ft. lbs at 6000 rpm.

5|$|Many of Tom Swift's fictional inventions {{describe}} actual {{technological developments}} or predate technologies now considered commonplace. Tom Swift Among the Diamond Makers (1911) {{was based on}} Charles Parsons's attempts to synthesize diamonds using electric current. Tom Swift and His Photo Telephone was published in 1912. Sending photographs by telephone was not fully developed until 1925. Tom Swift and His Wizard Camera (1912) features a portable movie camera, not invented until 1923. Tom Swift and His Electric Locomotive (1922) was published {{two years before the}} Central Railroad of New Jersey began using the first diesel electric locomotive. The house <b>on</b> <b>wheels</b> that Tom invents for 1929's Tom Swift and His House <b>on</b> <b>Wheels</b> pre-dated the first house trailer by a year.Tom Swift and His Diving Seacopter (1952) features a flying submarine similar to one planned by the United States Department of Defense four years later in 1956,.

Additionally, with a terminal illness often comes more complicated financial stressors; the social worker can be instrumental in connecting the patient and family with community resources including services such as Meals <b>on</b> <b>Wheels.</b> Lastly, if a patient is unable to be cared for at home, the social worker will work to find a safer place for the patient to receive hospice care.|$|E
5|$|The 1999 Bridge Creek–Moore tornado (locally {{referred}} to as the May 3 tornado) was a very powerful F5 tornado in which the highest wind speeds ever measured globally, , were recorded by a Doppler <b>on</b> <b>Wheels</b> (DOW) radar. The tornado devastated southern portions of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, along with surrounding suburbs and towns during the early evening of May 3, 1999. Throughout its 85-minute existence, the tornado covered , destroying thousands of homes, killing 36 people (plus an additional five indirectly), and leaving US$1 billion in damage, ranking it as the fifth-costliest on record, not accounting for inflation.|$|E

5|$|Modern winter service {{vehicles}} will usually {{also have a}} satellite navigation system connected to a weather forecast feed, allowing the driver to choose the best areas to treat and to avoid areas in which rain is likely, which can wash away the grit used—the most advanced can even adapt to changing conditions, ensuring optimal gritter and plow settings. Most run <b>on</b> <b>wheels,</b> often with snow chains or studded tires, but some are mounted on caterpillar tracks, with the tracks themselves adapted to throw the snow towards {{the side of the}} road. Off-road winter {{service vehicles}} mounted on caterpillar tracks are known as snowcats. Snowcats are commonly fitted with snowplows or snow groomers, and are used by ski resorts to smooth and maintain pistes and snowmobile runs, although they can also be used as a replacement for chairlifts.|$|E

5|$|Pistorius {{is always}} slow in {{starting}} a race because the flexible blades {{do not provide}} thrust out of the blocks. Pistorius must begin from an awkward position, swing his leg to the outside and pop straight up from the blocks to begin running, when the preferred method is to push off with horizontal force. For the first 30 meters of a race, he keeps {{his head down and}} takes short, quick strides. As he establishes a rhythm, he can raise his head and increase his speed. While some runners jog up and down, losing energy, Pistorius directs energy forward, looking somewhat like he is rolling <b>on</b> <b>wheels.</b> He also compensates for the adjustments ankles make on the turns, breaking the curves into short, straight lines. According to his coach Ampie Louw, Pistorius may {{be able to use the}} inward lean to generate force and come out of a turn going faster.|$|E
5|$|Research programs, {{including}} field {{projects such}} as the VORTEX projects (Verification of the Origins of Rotation in Tornadoes Experiment), deployment of TOTO (the TOtable Tornado Observatory), Doppler <b>On</b> <b>Wheels</b> (DOW), {{and dozens of other}} programs, hope to solve many questions that still plague meteorologists. Universities, government agencies such as the National Severe Storms Laboratory, private-sector meteorologists, and the National Center for Atmospheric Research are some of the organizations very active in research; with various sources of funding, both private and public, a chief entity being the National Science Foundation. The pace of research is partly constrained by the number of observations that can be taken; gaps in information about the wind, pressure, and moisture content throughout the local atmosphere; and the computing power available for simulation.|$|E
5|$|All {{types of}} cooking {{involved}} the direct use of fire. Kitchen stoves {{did not appear}} until the 18th century, and cooks had {{to know how to}} cook directly over an open fire. Ovens were used, but they were expensive to construct and only existed in fairly large households and bakeries. It was common for a community to have shared ownership of an oven to ensure that the bread baking essential to everyone was made communal rather than private. There were also portable ovens designed to be filled with food and then buried in hot coals, and even larger ones <b>on</b> <b>wheels</b> that were used to sell pies in the streets of medieval towns. But for most people, almost all cooking was done in simple stewpots, since this was the most efficient use of firewood and did not waste precious cooking juices, making potages and stews the most common dishes. Overall, most evidence suggests that medieval dishes had a fairly high fat content, or at least when fat could be afforded. This was considered less of a problem in a time of back-breaking toil, famine, and a greater acceptance—even desirability—of plumpness; only the poor or sick, and devout ascetics, were thin.|$|E
