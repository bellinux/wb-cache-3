5|$|Integer sorting {{algorithms}} including pigeonhole sort, counting sort, and radix sort {{are widely}} used and practical. Other integer sorting algorithms with smaller worst-case time bounds are not believed to be practical for computer architectures with 64 or fewer bits per word. Many such algorithms are known, with performance depending {{on a combination of}} the number of items to be sorted, number <b>of</b> <b>bits</b> per key, and number <b>of</b> <b>bits</b> per word of the computer performing the sorting algorithm.|$|E
5|$|The rough idea {{of these}} inapproximability results is {{to form a}} graph that {{represents}} a probabilistically checkable proof system for an NP-complete problem such as the Boolean satisfiability problem. In a probabilistically checkable proof system, a proof is represented as a sequence <b>of</b> <b>bits.</b> An instance of the satisfiability problem should have a valid proof {{if and only if}} it is satisfiable. The proof is checked by an algorithm that, after a polynomial-time computation on the input to the satisfiability problem, chooses to examine a small number of randomly chosen positions of the proof string. Depending on what values are found at that sample <b>of</b> <b>bits,</b> the checker will either accept or reject the proof, without looking at the rest of the bits. False negatives are not allowed: a valid proof must always be accepted. However, an invalid proof may sometimes mistakenly be accepted. For every invalid proof, the probability that the checker will accept it must be low.|$|E
5|$|When clocked, {{the phase}} {{accumulator}} (PA) creates a modulo-2N sawtooth waveform {{which is then}} converted by the phase-to-amplitude converter (PAC) to a sampled sinusoid, where N is the number <b>of</b> <b>bits</b> carried in the phase accumulator. N sets the NCO frequency resolution and is normally {{much larger than the}} number <b>of</b> <b>bits</b> defining the memory space of the PAC look-up table. If the PAC capacity is 2M, the PA output word must be truncated to M bits as shown in Figure 1. However, the truncated bits can be used for interpolation. The truncation of the phase output word does not affect the frequency accuracy but produces a time-varying periodic phase error which is a primary source of spurious products. Another spurious product generation mechanism is finite word length effects of the PAC output (amplitude) word.|$|E

5|$|Another {{method of}} {{constructing}} hash functions with both high quality and practical speed is tabulation hashing. In this method, the hash value for a key {{is computed by}} using each byte of the key as an index into a table of random numbers (with a different table for each byte position). The numbers from those table cells are then combined by a bitwise exclusive or operation. Hash functions constructed this way are only 3-independent. Nevertheless, linear probing using these hash functions takes constant expected time per operation. Both tabulation hashing and standard methods for generating 5-independent hash functions are limited to keys that have a fixed number <b>of</b> <b>bits.</b> To handle strings or other types of variable-length keys, {{it is possible to}} compose a simpler universal hashing technique that maps the keys to intermediate values and a higher quality (5-independent or tabulation) hash function that maps the intermediate values to hash table indices.|$|E
5|$|Jones {{was already}} a {{prominent}} citizen in Saltfleet Township. He had been a militia captain there since 1794. He also became a local magistrate. In 1801, {{he and his wife}} joined the Methodist Episcopal church in the area. Jones retired from the militia in 1811, but remained in Saltfleet Township until 1817, when he moved with his family to Brantford to live with the Mohawk community and his wife's extended family. During the War of 1812, his farm had suffered £250 in damages. On May 27, 1815 arsonists set fire to his barn, which Jones believed was an effort to force him to cease his investigation into a local murder of three Indians. These financial losses, coupled with prejudice from his white neighbours towards Jones due to his Indian wife and children and their knowledge he had previously been married to two Indian women simultaneously led to the move. Jones made one last survey in 1825, resurveying the line of Dundas street between Ancaster Township and West Flamborough Township. In Brantford he supported his family both by farming, and by selling <b>of</b> <b>bits</b> of land he had accumulated in his youth. After several years in Brantford, he moved to his estate Cold Springs on Dundas Street east of Paris, Ontario, where he farmed until his death.|$|E

50|$|Another use <b>of</b> <b>bit</b> {{stuffing}} is for {{run length}} limited coding: {{to limit the}} number <b>of</b> consecutive <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> the same value in the data to be transmitted.

This viewpoint will make it easier to talk about subalgebras of the power set algebra 2N, which this viewpoint makes the Boolean algebra of all sequences <b>of</b> <b>bits.</b> It also fits well with the columns of a truth table: when a column is read from top to bottom it constitutes a sequence <b>of</b> <b>bits,</b> {{but at the same time}} it can be viewed as the set of those valuations (assignments to variables in the left half of the table) at which the function represented by that column evaluates to 1.|$|E

40|$|Bit 1 (Bcl- 2 {{inhibitor}} of transcription) is a mitochondrial {{protein that}} induces caspase-independent apoptosis upon its release into the cytoplasm. Bit 1 is primarily associated with anoikis (cell death induced by detachment from the extracellular matrix), because the apoptotic function <b>of</b> <b>Bit</b> 1 is inhibited by integrin-mediated cell attachment {{but not by}} many other antiapoptotic treatments. Here, we show that protein kinase D (PKD) regulates Bit 1 apoptotic function. Overexpression of constitutively active PKD or PKD activation by treatment with phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate results in phosphorylation of two serine residues (Ser 5 and Ser 87) in a form <b>of</b> <b>Bit</b> 1 that is confined to the cytoplasm and concomitantly increases the apoptotic activity <b>of</b> cytoplasmic <b>Bit</b> 1. Conversely, suppressing PKD activity with pharmacological inhibitors or small interfering RNA approaches attenuates apoptosis induced by cytoplasmic Bit 1. Furthermore, PKD regulates induction of cell death by wild-type Bit 1 following loss of cell attachment to the extracellular matrix. Activation <b>of</b> PKD enhances <b>Bit</b> 1 function in anoikis, whereas inhibiting PKD function with pharmacological inhibitors or small interfering RNA compromises the ability <b>of</b> <b>Bit</b> 1 to induce anoikis. The induction <b>of</b> <b>Bit</b> 1 -mediated apoptosis by PKD is in part attributable to the release <b>of</b> <b>Bit</b> 1 from mitochondria to the cytoplasm {{as a consequence of}} phosphorylation of Ser 5 in the mitochondrial localization sequence <b>of</b> <b>Bit</b> 1. Consistent with the regulatory role of PKD in the anoikis function <b>of</b> <b>Bit</b> 1, we found that cell attachment to fibronectin inhibits PKD activity. These studies identify the PKD serine/threonine kinase as one of the signaling molecules through which integrin-mediated cell attachment controls Bit 1 activity and anoikis...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBIT is a transmembrane {{glycoprotein}} {{with three}} immunoglobulin-like domains in its extracellular region and tyrosine phosphorylation sites in its cytosolic region. We have previously shown that BIT was tyrosine phosphorylated in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus {{in response to}} light exposure during the dark period, and suggested that it {{was involved in the}} light entrainment of the circadian clock. To further investigate the function <b>of</b> <b>BIT</b> in the nervous system, we examined the effect of photic stimulation on its tyrosine phosphorylation in the rat retina. It was found that the tyrosine phosphorylation level <b>of</b> <b>BIT</b> in the retina was higher in the light period than in the dark period. In addition, a light stimulation during the dark period resulted in a rapid phosphorylation <b>of</b> <b>BIT</b> and a subsequent association <b>of</b> <b>BIT</b> with SHP- 2. The phosphorylation state was quickly reverted when the light was turned off. The light-dependent phosphorylation <b>of</b> <b>BIT</b> was also observed in isolated cultured retinas, and this was blocked by a specific Src-family inhibitor, PP- 2. Immunohistochemical study showed that BIT was highly enriched in the inner and outer plexiform layers in the retina, where the immunoreactivity to anti-SHP- 2 antibody was also detected. These results suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation <b>of</b> <b>BIT</b> is involved in neuronal transmission in the retina...|$|R
