50|$|Early cars {{such as the}} Ford Model T had a <b>hand</b> <b>lever</b> {{to control}} the {{throttle}}. Later cars used both a foot pedal and a <b>hand</b> <b>lever</b> to set the minimum throttle. This was an early form of cruise control. The 1918 Stutz Bearcat had a central throttle pedal with the clutch and brake {{to the right and}} left. Modern cruise control was invented in 1948.|$|R
5000|$|Entire {{operation}} of the shovel is controlled by two <b>hand</b> <b>levers</b> {{and a pair of}} foot pedals.|$|R
50|$|This {{accident}} {{happened because}} the points were not fully interlocked, and were merely {{a kind of}} power-assisted <b>hand</b> <b>lever,</b> with automatic normalisation.|$|R
50|$|For the 1921 Indianapolis 500 small {{rear wheels}} brakes only were fitted. Subsequently, Isotta Fraschini-type front wheel brakes {{actuated}} by <b>hand</b> <b>lever,</b> rear brakes actuated by right pedal.|$|R
50|$|When {{this type}} of valve is tripped, the flow is quickly stopped and an {{indicator}} disc tells the operator that the electrical circuit has been opened by a failure somewhere in the system. When the system failure has been corrected so that the circuit is again closed, the valve can be opened {{by the action of}} the <b>hand</b> <b>lever.</b> If, however, the system failure has not been satisfactorily corrected, the circuit will remain open and moving the <b>hand</b> <b>lever</b> will not open the valve, because the valve stem remains disengaged from the handle.|$|R
50|$|The brakes are all two piston design. Both front brakes are {{activated}} {{by the right}} <b>hand</b> <b>lever.</b> The rear brake is {{activated by}} the foot pedal on the right.|$|R
25|$|Tires were 9.00x20 with dual rear tires. Brakes {{were full}} air with drum brakes on all wheels. Trailer air {{connections}} applied trailer-brakes with the truck brakes and a <b>hand</b> <b>lever</b> could apply the trailer brakes alone.|$|R
5000|$|The front brakes are two-piston design, {{while the}} single rear caliper houses four pistons. Both front brakes are {{activated}} {{by the right}} <b>hand</b> <b>lever.</b> The rear brake is activated by the foot pedal on the right.|$|R
50|$|The Topper had 5 inch {{internal}} expanding {{drum brakes}} on both wheels. The front brake {{was controlled by}} a <b>hand</b> <b>lever</b> on the left handlebar with a parking brake lock; the rear brake was controlled by a pedal.|$|R
50|$|The {{simplest}} form of gab {{valve gear}} or 'gab clutch' {{was a simple}} notch in the valve rod, where it hooked over the valve spindle. A <b>hand</b> <b>lever</b> allowed this notch to be lifted, thus disengaging the valve drive and promptly stopping the engine.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of Columbia mopeds were powered with a 47cc Sachs 505/1A, though some were {{powered by a}} Solo motor. Even though the Sachs 505/1A motor is designed for rear coaster-brakes, Columbia chose to use a Magura <b>hand</b> <b>lever</b> and cable for the rear brake.|$|R
5000|$|... "The engine a {{sets the}} face plate b, {{which serves as}} the flywheel, into motion and the {{rotation}} is transferred to the discus wheel c. Through this the shaft dd with the sprocket turns. Thus the chain e drives the rear axle. The speed is adjusted by shifting the discus wheel c on the shaft dd {{by means of the}} <b>hand</b> <b>lever</b> fastened {{to the left of the}} upper end of the steering column and the articulated lever f. The bearings of the shaft dd with the discus wheel c can be shifted forwards and backwards carriage-like by the <b>hand</b> <b>lever</b> g to the right of the driver's seat. By means of this <b>hand</b> <b>lever</b> the discus wheel c is engaged with the face plate b and the engine, or idling, pressed backwards against the brake arm f to brake the car. So this lever serves both to brake and to engage the clutch. Independently of the aforementioned brake there are two band brakes r1 and r2 on both rear wheels. The beehive radiator n cools the cylinders by means of the belt-driven pump l. The chassis is made of iron-reinforced wood. The front axle is straight, the rear axle is full-length and has no differential." ...|$|R
50|$|Though {{the term}} {{can refer to}} any small {{printing}} press or machine intended for such work, it most commonly refers to a class of small, vertical platen presses.Depending on the time-period when the machine was made, they may be operated by treadle, line shaft, electricity, or by <b>hand</b> <b>lever.</b>|$|R
50|$|Transmission brakes use drum brakes, {{rather than}} disc brakes, {{as they are}} {{intended}} as a static parking brake, rather than a high performance dynamic brake. Drum brakes allow simpler adjustment with cable-actuated <b>hand</b> <b>lever</b> mechanisms. The brake is mounted to the rear output shaft of the transfer box.|$|R
50|$|Bennett's team at RM custom-milled the Tomahawk {{components}} from {{blocks of}} aluminum. Under the seat are two alloy pieces that began as 750 lb billets that are machined down to 25 lb each, and polished to a mirror finish. Details like <b>hand</b> <b>levers</b> and the twistgrip use needle and ball bearings.|$|R
5000|$|The T engine had one carburetor, a side-draft, single-venturi unit. Its choke and {{throttle}} valves {{were controlled}} manually; {{the latter was}} with a <b>hand</b> <b>lever</b> rather than a foot pedal. The carburetor had no accelerator pump. Various vendors supplied Ford with carburetors for the T engine, including Holley, Zenith, and Kingston.|$|R
50|$|A pedal {{operates}} {{shoes in}} enclosed drums {{at the rear}} and a centrally set <b>hand</b> <b>lever</b> applies a locomotive type of transmission brake which is anchored to the gear box. Hand adjusters are provided. Compensation is given by rubber washers. The rear-wheel brakes can also be taken up by hand on the primary rod.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, {{there is}} some {{passenger}} or freight traffic on only two short sections. On the western section between Hollenbek and Ratzeburg, Erlebnisbahn Ratzeburg has operated a seasonal operation with rides on a <b>hand</b> <b>lever</b> trolley (draisine) since 1998. In addition the track is maintained to promote its re-commissioning for the operation of Regionalbahn services.|$|R

50|$|The chassis had rigid {{front and}} rear axles and leaf springs all round. Early cars only had brakes on the rear wheels {{operated}} by a <b>hand</b> <b>lever,</b> with a pedal-operated transmission brake acting on the propeller shaft. The footbrake system moved to drums on the rear axle in 1913. Four-wheel servo-assisted brakes became optional in 1923.|$|R
50|$|The worm and sector {{steering}} box was {{fixed to the}} engine and received lubrication from it. All four wheels had internally expanding brakes. The <b>hand</b> <b>lever</b> operated only the back pair. Unconventional in action it was simplified for the following Motor Show. The front brakes used the Perrot system. The car's springs were all half-elliptical, flat-set and gaitered.|$|R
5000|$|The DCBS {{system is}} {{designated}} [...] "Dual" [...] as both <b>hand</b> <b>lever</b> and foot pedal each control both {{front and rear}} brakes; (more commonly the foot pedal operates only the rear brake). Honda first introduced this (BCBS) braking system on the 1992 Honda CBR1000F. This {{was based on the}} Unified Braking System that was introduced on the 1983 GL1100.|$|R

The 377 has a single Bosch Flywheel Magneto Generator 12 volt ignition system and {{is equipped with a}} 36 mm Bing double float carburetor, with either a <b>hand</b> <b>lever</b> or cable choke.|$|R
50|$|Many {{semaphore}} signals were formerly used, which were {{controlled by a}} <b>hand</b> <b>lever.</b> Few semaphores remain in Japan. On 28 July 2005, the last {{semaphore signals}} on the JR lines at RikuchÅ«-Yagi Station were replaced by colored lights. A few stations are still equipped with semaphore signals on the Tsugaru Railway Line, the Fukushima Rinkai Railway Main Line and the Niigata-Higashi industrial line.|$|R
40|$|Before {{undertaking}} {{a detailed}} description of an automatic-control mechanism, I will state briefly the fundamental conditions for such devices. These are: 1) it must be sensitive at one or more reference values; 2) it must stop the angular motions of the airplane not produced by the pilot; and 3) it must be possible to switch it off and on by a simple <b>hand</b> <b>lever...</b>|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: In the Ford Model T the left-side <b>hand</b> <b>lever</b> {{sets the}} rear wheel parking brakes and puts the {{transmission}} in neutral. The lever to the right controls the throttle. The lever on {{the left of the}} steering column is for ignition timing. The left foot pedal changes the two forward gears while the centre pedal controls reverse. The right pedal is the brake.|$|R
5000|$|Under the {{designation}} 10 HP Type A {{the car had}} a water-cooled 1327 cc four-cylinder engine and an output of [...] Its maximum speed was 65 km/h (40 mph). The chassis had inverted quarter elliptic springs at the front and double quarter elliptics at the rear. Braking was on the rear wheels only controlled by a <b>hand</b> <b>lever</b> with a foot pedal operated transmission brake.|$|R

50|$|Rope locks are cam-actuated devices {{through which}} a {{counterweight}} system operating line passes. The adjustable cam, or dog, inside the rope lock constricts and releases the operating line as the flyman lowers and raises a <b>hand</b> <b>lever.</b> Rope locks are mounted in series to the locking rail. A single rope lock can typically secure a static unbalanced load to 50 lb. Rope locks {{are not intended}} to slow a running line.|$|R
50|$|The four-wheel brakes are {{operated}} hydraulically. They {{are designed}} on the Lockheed system. There {{is also a}} <b>hand</b> <b>lever</b> fitted with a sensibly shaped trigger to control the back brakes. The springs front and back are half-elliptical with oilite bearings and double-action hydraulic shock absorbers. The rear suspension like the frame passes below the axle. Steering is by worm and nut in a box held by a bracket to the frame.|$|R
