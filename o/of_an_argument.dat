5|$|Chrysippus was a {{prolific}} writer. He {{is said to}} rarely have gone without writing 500 lines a day and he composed more than 705 works. His desire to be comprehensive meant {{that he would take}} both sides <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>argument</b> and his opponents accused him of filling his books with the quotations of others. He was considered diffuse and obscure in his utterances and careless in his style, but his abilities were highly regarded, and he came {{to be seen as a}} preeminent authority for the school.|$|E
5|$|Best {{passed the}} eleven plus exam at Blackmoor Park primary school in West Derby, and was {{studying}} at the Liverpool Collegiate Grammar School in Shaw Street {{when he decided}} he wanted to be in a music group. Mona bought him a drum kit from Blackler's music store and Best formed his own band, the Black Jacks. Chas Newby and Bill Barlow joined the group, as did Ken Brown, but only after he had left the Quarrymen. The Black Jacks later became the resident group at the Casbah, after the Quarrymen cancelled their residency because <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>argument</b> about money.|$|E

40|$|An {{argument}} is epistemically self-defeating when either the truth <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>argument’s</b> conclusion or belief in <b>an</b> <b>argument’s</b> conclusion defeats one’s justification to believe {{at least one}} of that argument’s premises. Some extant defenses of the evidentiary value of intuition have in-voked considerations of epistemic self-defeat in their defense. I argue that there is one kind <b>of</b> <b>argument</b> against intuition, <b>an</b> unreliability <b>argument,</b> which, even if epistemically self-defeating, can still imply that we are not justified in thinking intuition has evidentiary value. 1 Intuition and Epistemic Self-Defeat Let us say <b>an</b> <b>argument</b> is epistemically self-defeating when either the truth <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>argument’s</b> conclusion or belief in <b>an</b> <b>argument’s</b> conclusion defeats one’s justification to believe {{at least one of}} that argument’s premises. 1 Accordingly, unless one has some other source of justification for the conclusion <b>of</b> such <b>an</b> <b>argument</b> one lacks justification to believe that conclusion.

5|$|Mido {{was thrown}} out of the Egypt team during the 2006 African Cup of Nations as a {{consequence}} <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>argument</b> with coach Hassan Shehata in the semi-final game against Senegal, which started after Mido reacted badly to being substituted. His replacement Amr Zaki came on to score a header with his first touch, putting Egypt into the final. A day later, Mido reconciled with Shehata, but was given a six-month suspension from playing with Egypt. Mido was eventually recalled by the side following his suspension, ready for the 2008 African Cup of Nations qualification which Egypt won. Mido was included in the Egypt squad to play South Africa in London in November 2006, despite suffering from a knee injury at the time. However, he was left out of the Egypt squad to play Mauritania in an African Nations Cup qualifier in March 2007.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} argued that {{regardless}} of the economic, scientific and technical aspects, the difficulty of achieving concerted political action on global warming requires other approaches. Those arguing political expediency say the difficulty of achieving meaningful emissions cuts and the effective failure of the Kyoto Protocol demonstrate the practical difficulties of achieving carbon dioxide emissions reduction by the agreement of the international community. However, others point to support for climate engineering proposals among think tanks with a history of global warming skepticism and opposition to emissions reductions as evidence that the prospect of climate engineering is itself already politicized and being promoted as part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>argument</b> against the need for (and viability of) emissions reductions; that, rather than climate engineering being a solution to the difficulties of emissions reductions, the prospect of climate engineering is being used as part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>argument</b> to stall emissions reductions in the first place.|$|E

25|$|Logic is {{generally}} considered formal when it analyzes and represents the form of any valid argument type. The form <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>argument</b> is displayed by representing its sentences in the formal grammar and symbolism of a logical language to make its content usable in formal inference. Simply put, formalising simply means translating English sentences into the language of logic.|$|E

25|$|Some {{hold the}} view that {{informal}} logic is not a branch or subdiscipline of logic, or even {{the view that}} there cannot be {{such a thing as}} informal logic. Massey criticizes informal logic {{on the grounds that it}} has no theory underpinning it. Informal logic, he says, requires detailed classification schemes to organize it, which in other disciplines is provided by the underlying theory. He maintains that there is no method of establishing the invalidity <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>argument</b> aside from the formal method, and that the study of fallacies may be of more interest to other disciplines, like psychology, than to philosophy and logic.|$|E
25|$|The {{stabbing}} {{took place}} as the result <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>argument</b> over some opera tickets that a customer, John Finch, {{the son of the}} Countess of Winchelsea and brother to Lord Finch, had given to Sally's sister instead of Sally. During the argument in the Three Tuns Tavern in Chandos Street, Covent Garden, Finch and Salisbury both became angry and Salisbury snatched up the knife she had been given with her meal and stabbed Finch in the chest. She was apparently immediately remorseful and called for a surgeon to attend Finch. Finch was gravely ill for some time, but forgave Salisbury on the spot. When he later recovered, he wished to visit her in prison to reiterate his forgiveness.|$|E
25|$|Coxon {{was born}} in Huddersfield, Yorkshire. World War II delayed Coxon's {{first-class}} debut for Yorkshire to 1945, when he was 29. Coxon was an aggressive fast-medium bowler who played for England once – against Australia in 1948 at Lord's. There were rumours <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>argument</b> with Denis Compton, and his prickly nature was later attested to by Brian Close. Coxon retired after the 1950 season, allegedly in umbrage at his non-selection for the forthcoming Ashes tour, and moved to play Minor counties cricket with Durham. He played 29 times for that county between 1951 and 1954, taking 127 wickets and scoring 1,047 runs with two centuries. His highest score was 102 not out against Yorkshire Second XI at Scarborough in 1952. Also in 1952, he achieved his best bowling figures for Durham; nine for 28 and six for 58 against Staffordshire.|$|E

25|$|Italian {{scientist}} Giovanni Battista Riccioli and {{his assistant}} Francesco Maria Grimaldi described the effect in connection with artillery in the 1651 Almagestum Novum, writing that rotation of the Earth should cause a cannonball fired to the north to deflect to the east. In 1674 Claude François Milliet Dechales described in his Cursus seu Mundus Mathematicus how {{the rotation of the}} earth should cause a deflection in the trajectories of both falling bodies and projectiles aimed toward one of the planet's poles. Riccioli, Grimaldi, and Dechales all described the effect as part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>argument</b> against the heliocentric system of Copernicus. In other words, they argued that the Earth's rotation should create the effect, and so failure to detect the effect was evidence for an immobile Earth. The Coriolis acceleration equation was derived by Euler in 1749 and the effect was described in the tidal equations of Pierre-Simon Laplace in 1778.|$|E
25|$|Investigators {{discovered}} {{that one of the}} last people to see Paula alive was a man who lived along Harbour Road. He was in the midst <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>argument</b> with his girlfriend when she walked by. The man stormed off in a jealous rage shortly thereafter and depending on different statements he made, he went to his shack and spent the evening by himself, or he drove his truck up the travel portion of the trail (where Paula was heading). He lied to police on several occasions and was a person of interest in 1946 and again in 1952 when the case was revisited. Reportedly, he told at least two people that he knew within a hundred feet where Paula was buried but later claimed it was just idle talk. When no evidence was found that a crime had actually been committed, no body was ever discovered, and no forensic clues were identified, this avenue of the investigation ended.|$|E
25|$|The Germans {{attacked}} at {{dawn and}} it was all over by 14:00. As the Germans searched the forest the SAS men tried to break out. A party of 34 were moving down a forest track when they were ambushed and captured. The leader of the party, Lieutenant Tomos Stephens, was beaten to death by a German officer using a rifle butt; seven captured Maquisards were executed in the woods. The SAS men and the US pilot should have been treated as prisoners of war. However, their fate was determined by the issue of the Commando Order by Adolf Hitler which called for the execution of commandos. The decision of who was going to execute them was the cause <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>argument</b> between the German Army and the SS. It was decided that the army would carry out the execution. On 7 July, the surviving prisoners of war, 30 SAS men and Second Lieutenant Bundy, were taken into the woods near to St Sauvant, forced to dig their own graves then executed by a German firing squad at dawn under the command of SS Major Josef Kieffer. Their bodies were then buried in a mass grave. Three Special Air Service men who had been wounded and hospitalized were killed by the administration of lethal injections. The men executed in the woods were re-interred in the village cemetery of Rom, Deux-Sèvres. The bodies of the three men executed in the hospital have never been found, but they are commemorated by a plaque among their comrades' headstones in Rom.|$|E
