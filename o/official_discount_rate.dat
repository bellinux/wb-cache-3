50|$|The {{accelerating}} {{growth in}} terms of Japanese asset prices is closely associated with a significant drop in short-term interest rates, notably between 1986 and 1987.

Nonetheless, Black Monday in the US triggered a delay for the BOJ to switch to a monetary tightening policy. The BOJ officially increased the discount rate on March 31, 1989.|$|E
50|$|The strong {{appreciation}} of the yen, however, eroded the Japanese economy since the economy was led by exports and capital investment for export purpose. In fact, in order to overcome the “endaka” recession and stimulate the local economy, an aggressive fiscal policy was adopted, mainly through expansion of public investment. Simultaneously, the BOJ declared that curbing the yen’s appreciation was a “national priority”. To prevent the yen from appreciating further, monetary policy makers pursued aggressive monetary easing and slashed the <b>official</b> <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> to as low as 2.5% by February 1987.|$|E

40|$|Interest {{rate policy}} {{is one of}} the oldest and at the same time most {{controversial}} tools with which central bank affects the economy. In fact, it comes down to the central bank initiated changes in the levels of the so-called <b>official</b> interest <b>rates</b> (<b>discount</b> <b>rate,</b> rediscount rate, lombard rate, and others) or influencing the market interest rates through open market operations. A frequent paradox which appears in the historical approach to interest rates is questioning of the causative role of interest rate changes introduced by central banks with reference to dynamics of the so-called real sphere as well as frequent use of this stabilization instrument. In the last few decades, several turnabouts occurred in economic policies (especially, monetary policies) of the industrialized countries. Each time, a new interpretation of interest rate policy was responsible for that [Bednarczyk, 1990, Hubbard, 2002]. One of the trends which appeared in the discussion was an attempt to return to classical roots of the interest rate theory. The concept of the natural rate of interest became the focus of attention. This paper refers to this concept and is an attempt to present the author’s own interpretation of it. The final part of the paper presents a study case of the natural interest rate policy of the National Bank of Poland (NBP) in the years 1999 - 2003. It shows that finding an optimum rate of interest in the transforming economy can be even more difficult than it appears from purely theoretical discussions...|$|R

40|$|In {{reviewing}} {{what happened}} in the 1980 s in Japan and how the bursting of the bubble created problems in the early 1990 s, the following conclusions are obtained. (1) In order to limit damage to the economy from a bubble and its bursting, it is important to build a resilient financial system through strict supervision policy, so that asset-price fluctuations would not weaken financial institutions. Supervision policy would include regulatory measures limiting lending concentration and exposure to real-estate-related sectors. (2) Monetary policy should pay attention to asset-price movements. But it may be difficult and inappropriate to raise the interest rate sharply when inflation is low (below one per cent like in Japan), even though asset prices are increasing at 30 - 40 per cent. (3) The <b>official</b> <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> could have been raised in the summer of 1988 in Japan, when the Federal Reserve and Bundesbank raised interest rates. This would have slowed down the rise of stock and land prices, but the bubble was already large by then.

40|$|Purpose – Venture capitalists {{typically}} use <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> in {{the range}} of 30 - 70 percent. During the startup stage of venture-capital financing, <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> between 50 and 70 percent are common. The <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> decreases from the first through fourth stage: from 60 to 30 percent. These rates of return are high compared to historical returns on common stocks or small stocks (12. 1 and 17. 8 percent, respectively). Such high <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> cannot also be explained in the context of any existing asset pricing theory; that is, any reasonable risk-adjusted <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> are not consistent with <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> in the order of 30 - 60 percent. The paper provides a rational economic explanation why venture capitalists (VC) use such high <b>discount</b> <b>rates.</b> The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach – Let the <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> of a venture project be 15 percent; this <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> depends on the systematic risk of the cash flows from the project given that the project is successful. Using the procedure, a VC who estimates the probability of eventual success of the project between 60 and 40 percent will impose a <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> between 42 and 74 percent. These <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> are quite similar to the <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> charged by VC in their startup and first stages. Findings – The high rates of return charged by VC reflect the fact that not all their projects succeed in that they have no net cash-inflows. Adjusting for the probability of success of the project provides estimates of <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> comparable. Originality/value – The paper argues that reported rates of return of common stock are relevant for projects that have succeeded in that they have net cash-inflows...|$|R

40|$|Background: In {{cost-effectiveness}} analysis, <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> {{are used}} in calculating the value of future costs and benefits. However, standard <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> may not accurately describe the decision-making of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). These patients often choose the long-term risks of immunosuppressive therapy over the short-term risks of colectomy, demonstrating very high <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> for future health. In this study we aimed to measure the <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> in UC patients and identify variables associated with the <b>discount</b> <b>rate.</b> Methods: We surveyed patients with UC and patients who were postcolectomy for UC to measure their valuations of UC and colectomy health states. We used Standard Gamble (SG) and Time-Trade-Off (TTO) methods to assess current and future health state valuations and calculated the <b>discount</b> <b>rate.</b> Results: Participants included 150 subjects with UC and 150 subjects who were postcolectomy for UC. Adjusted <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> varied widely (0 %– 100 %), with an overall median rate of 55. 0 % (interquartile range [IQR] 20. 6 – 100), which {{was significantly higher than}} the standard rate of 5 %.
