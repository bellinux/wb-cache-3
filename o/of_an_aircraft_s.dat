40|$|Advances in {{computational}} power {{have produced}} great strides {{in the later}} design and production portions <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>aircraft</b> <b>s</b> life cycle, and these advances have included the internal layout component of the design and manufacturing process. However, conceptual and preliminary design tools for internal layout remain primarily based on historical regressions and estimations a situation that becomes untenable when considering revolutionary designs or component technologies. Bringing internal layout information forward in the design process can encourage {{the same level of}} benefits enjoyed by other disciplines as advances in aerodynamics, structures and other fields propagate forward in the design of complex systems. Accurate prediction of the volume required to contain all <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>aircraft</b> <b>s</b> internal components results in a more accurate prediction of aircraft specifications, mission effectiveness, and costs, helping determine if an aircraft is the best choice for continued development. This is not a computationally simple problem, however, and great care must be taken to ensure the efficiency of any proposed solution. Any solution must also address the uncertainty inherent in describing internal components early in the design process. Implementing a methodology that applies notions of an intelligent search for a solution, as well as deals robustly with component sizing, produces a high chance of success. Development of a robust, rapid method for assessing the volumetric characteristics of an aircraft {{in the context of the}} conceptual and preliminary design processes can offer many of the benefits of a complete internal layout without the immense assignment of resources typical in the detail phase of the design process. A simplified methodology for volumetrically sizing an aircraft is presented here as well as an assessment of the state-of-the-art techniques for volumetric considerations used in current aircraft design literature. A prototype tool using a combination of original code and publicly available libraries is developed and explored. A sample aircraft design is undertaken with the prototype tool to demonstrate the effectiveness of the methodology. Ph. D.

40|$|This paper explores {{application}} of adaptive control architecture to a light, high-aspect ratio, flexible aircraft configuration that exhibits strong rigid body/flexible mode coupling. Specifically, an L(sub 1) adaptive output feedback controller is developed for a semi-span {{wind tunnel model}} capable of motion. The wind tunnel mount allows the semi-span model to translate vertically and pitch at the wing root, resulting in better simulation <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>aircraft</b> <b>s</b> rigid body motion. The control objective is to design a pitch control with altitude hold while suppressing body freedom flutter. The controller is an output feedback nominal controller (LQG) augmented by an L(sub 1) adaptive loop. A modification to the L(sub 1) output feedback is proposed {{to make it more}} suitable for flexible structures. The new control law relaxes the required bounds on the unmatched uncertainty and allows dependence on the state as well as time, i. e. a more general unmatched nonlinearity. The paper presents controller development and simulated performance responses. Simulation is conducted by using full state flexible wing models derived from test data at 10 different dynamic pressure conditions. An L(sub 1) adaptive output feedback controller is designed for a single test point and is then applied to all the test cases. The simulation results show that the L(sub 1) augmented controller can stabilize and meet the performance requirements for all 10 test conditions ranging from 30 psf to 130 psf dynamic pressure...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} a flight crew to deliver their {{aircraft}} to its arrival runway on time {{is important to the}} overall efficiency of the National Airspace System (NAS). Over the past several years, the NAS has been stressed almost to its limits resulting in problems such as airport congestion, flight delay, and flight cancellation to reach levels that have never been seen before in the NAS. It is predicted that this situation will worsen by the year 2025, due to an anticipated increase in air traffic operations to one-and-a-half to three times its current level. Improved arrival efficiency, in terms of both capacity and environmental impact, {{is an important part of}} improving NAS operations. One way to improve the arrival performance of an aircraft is to enable the flight crew to precisely deliver their aircraft to a specified point at either a specified time or specified interval relative to another aircraft. This gives the flight crew more control to make the necessary adjustments to their aircraft s performance with less tactical control from the controller; it may also decrease the controller s workload. Two approaches to precise time navigation have been proposed: Time-Based Arrivals (e. g., required times of arrival) and Self-Spacing. Time-Based Arrivals make use <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>aircraft</b> <b>s</b> Flight Management System (FMS) to deliver the aircraft to the runway threshold at a given time. Self-Spacing enables the flight crew to achieve an ATC assigned spacing goals at the runway threshold relative to another aircraft. The Joint Planning and Development Office (JPDO), a multi-agency initiative established to plan and coordinate the development of the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen), has asked for data for both of these concepts to facilitate future research and development. This paper provides a first look at the delivery performance of these two concepts under various initial and environmental conditions in an air traffic simulation environment...|$|E
40|$|Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) {{computational}} {{fluid dynamics}} (CFD) analysis was conducted to study the low-speed stall aerodynamics <b>of</b> <b>a</b> GIII <b>aircraft</b> <b>s</b> swept wing modified with a laminar-flow wing glove. The stall aerodynamics of the gloved wing were analyzed and compared with the unmodified wing for the flight speed of 120 knots and altitude of 2300 ft {{above mean sea level}} (MSL). The Star-CCM+ polyhedral unstructured CFD code was first validated for wing stall predictions using the wing-body geometry from the First AIAA CFD High-Lift Prediction Workshop. It was found that the Star-CCM+ CFD code can produce results that are within the scattering of other CFD codes considered at the workshop. In particular, the Star-CCM+ CFD code was able to predict wing stall for the AIAA wing-body geometry to within 1 degree of angle of attack as compared to benchmark wind-tunnel test data. Current results show that the addition of the laminar-flow wing glove causes the gloved wing to stall much earlier than the unmodified wing. Furthermore, the gloved wing has a different stall characteristic than the clean wing, with no sharp lift drop-off at stall for the gloved wing...|$|R

5000|$|The weight <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>aircraft</b> is one <b>of</b> {{the basic}} factors that determines {{the length of}} the landing roll <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>aircraft.</b> An {{increase}} in weight increases the stall speed <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>aircraft.</b> Stall is <b>a</b> reduction in the lift coefficient generated by a wing as angle of attack increases. Therefore, the minimum approach speed is much higher in case of heavier aircraft.
