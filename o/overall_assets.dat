25|$|Corporate insolvencies {{happen because}} {{companies}} become excessively indebted. Under UK law, {{a company is}} a separate legal person {{from the people who}} have invested money and labour into it, and it mediates a series of interest groups. Invariably the shareholders, directors and employees' liability is limited to the amount of their investment, so against commercial creditors they can lose no more than the money they paid for shares, or their jobs. Insolvencies become intrinsically possible whenever a relationship of credit and debt is created, as frequently happens through contracts or other obligations. In the section of an economy where competitive markets operate, wherever excesses are possible, insolvencies are likely to happen. The meaning of insolvency is simply an inability to repay debts, although the law isolates two main further meanings. First, for a court to order a company be wound up (and its assets sold off) or for an administrator to be appointed (to try to turn the business around), or for avoiding various transactions, the cash flow test is usually applied: a company must be unable to pay its debts as they fall due. Second, for the purpose of suing directors to compensate creditors, or for directors to be disqualified, a company must be shown to have fewer <b>overall</b> <b>assets</b> than liabilities on its balance sheet. If debts cannot be paid back to everybody in full, creditors necessarily stand in competition with one another for a share of the remaining assets. For this reason, a statutory system of priorities fixes the order among different kinds of creditor for payment.|$|E
500|$|With declining margins in the {{industry}} and left without Citgo's reserves, Mesa and its investor partners kept hunting for a takeover target, only to discover while fighting Gulf for Citgo how increasingly top-heavy its portfolio and declining reserves were undervaluing its <b>overall</b> <b>assets.</b> [...] They subtly but quickly acquired 4.9 percent of Gulf Oil's stock by early fall 1983, just shy of having to declare themselves and their intent at 5 percent to the SEC. [...] In the ten days allowed to prepare the SEC filing, Mesa and its investor partners accelerated buying to 11 percent of the company's stock, larger than the founding Mellon family's share, by October 1983. Gulf responded to Mesa's interest by calling a shareholders' meeting for late November 1983 and subsequently engaged in a proxy war on changing the corporation's by-laws to minimize arbitrage. Pickens made loud criticisms of the existing Gulf management and offered an alternative business plan intended to release shareholder value through a royalty trust that management argued would [...] "slim down" [...] Gulf's market share. Pickens had acquired {{the reputation of being}} a corporate raider whose skill lay in making profits out of bidding for companies but without actually acquiring them. During the early 1980s alone, he made failed bids for Cities Service, General American Oil, Gulf, Phillips Petroleum and Unocal. The process of making such bids would promote a frenzy of asset divestiture and debt reduction in the target companies. This is a standard defensive tactic calculated to boost the current share price, although possibly at the expense of long-term strategic advantage. The target shares would rise sharply in price, at which point Pickens would dispose of his interest at a substantial profit.|$|E

Neither were happy with the arrangement and in 1785 Peter III sold his share of the forges (and the ore fields) to Robert Coleman, who thus became Peter Jr.'s partner. Peter Jr. became even more concerned for his business situation, especially for the supply of pig iron from his brother's Cornwall Furnace, and decided to build his own furnace at Mount Hope. He went deeply into debt and the pressures of the situation led him to commit suicide at Hopewell in 1786.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{the adoption of}} advanced manufacturing technology (AMT). The general proposition is that the adoption of AMT reflects an interactive learning process, which is described by the extant use of AMT, firm-specific AMT knowledge accumulation, and the transfer of AMT ideas among networks of firms, suppliers, industry associations and government. This general proposition was specified as a structural equation model of Adoption of AMT. Data {{were based on the}} experiences of 224 Australian manufacturing companies that have invested and succeeded in using AMT. The results suggest that the adoption of AMT is primarily a function of a firm&# 039;s assets for AMT, which comprise the resources, capabilities, and competences for developing and using AMT. The relationship between the adoption of AMT and assets for AMT was reciprocal, which implied a process of dynamic accumulation of both technology and human assets - a view consonant with the competence perspective of the firm. <b>Overall,</b> <b>assets</b> for AMT represent the AMT knowledge base of firms, and were shown to have a crucial role in determining the adoption of AMT...|$|E
40|$|Common {{standards}} in asset management identify both tangible and intangible assets; they also declare that both {{are critical to}} the long term success of the organisation. Although, there has been substantial work in the definition and management of tangible assets there has been less, accomplished, with intangible assets. The objective {{of this research is}} therefore, to develop a management model explaining how the intangible asset capacity to ‘learn’ and ‘unlearn’ or reframe is a critical and essential element in the process of <b>overall</b> organisational <b>asset</b> management. As a result, by applying a systematic and structured learning and unlearning process, organisations will ultimately, be able to realise a better utilisation of both their physical and non-physical assets. Therefore, if management understands and embraces learning and unlearning, and then encourages honest and reflective appreciation of the need to reframe or forget prior recipes of success, organisations will be able to realise more effective change outcomes and innovation. Consequentially for organisations, this research will be able to demonstrate how to achieve an enhanced <b>overall</b> <b>asset</b> utilisation and, most importantly, provide a focus on the means of valuing intangible assets...|$|R
40|$|An {{integrated}} corrosion {{management program}} {{should be part of}} the <b>overall</b> <b>asset</b> management and preservation program and should not be treated as/in a separate system. Integrity of assets is a characteristic of sound and safe performance for which it was designed. Other subsets of the overall integrity management program include, e. g. mechanical damage and operating stress. This keynote outlines steps for developing an effective integrated corrosion management program with the aim to minimise costs and to extend life whilst reducing the risk for failure. Cost implications of inadequate corrosion control include both direct and indirect costs, which are correlated. For example, inadequate coatingmaintenance (direct cost) will lead to increased maintenance and repair costs later(indirect costs), which often outweigh the initial costs of simply maintaining the adequate condition of the coatings. The implementation of an integrated corrosion management program, that result in the reduction/elimination of corrosion related damage/deterioration of assets, will notonly assist in compliance with regulatory requirements but also has a direct effect on the <b>assets</b> <b>overall</b> economic performance...|$|R
