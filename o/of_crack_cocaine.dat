5000|$|<b>Crack</b> <b>cocaine,</b> {{also known}} simply as crack, is a free base form of cocaine that can be smoked. It offers a short but intense high to smokers.

25|$|By 1978, {{there were}} 45 Crips gangs, called sets, {{operating}} in Los Angeles. They were {{heavily involved in}} the production of PCP, marijuana and amphetamines. On March 11, 1979, Stanley Tookie Williams, a member of Westside Crips, was arrested for four murders and then on August 8, 1979, Raymond Washington was gunned down. Washington had been against Crip infighting and after his death several Crip sets started fighting against each other. The Crips leadership was dismantled prompting a deadly gang war between the Rollin' 60 Neighborhood Crips and Eight Tray Gangster Crips which began causing nearby Crip sets to choose sides and align themselves with either the Gangster Crips or Neighborhood Crips waging an all out war in South Central and other cities. The East Coast Crips and the Hoover Crips directly severed their alliance after Washington's death. By 1980 the Crips were in turmoil, warring with the Bloods and against each other. The growth and power of the gang really took off in the early 1980s when crack cocaine hit the streets. In the early 1980s Crips sets began distributing crack cocaine in Los Angeles. The huge profits from distribution <b>of</b> <b>crack</b> <b>cocaine</b> induced many Crips to establish new markets in other cities and states. As a result, Crip membership grew steadily and by late 1980s {{it was one of the}} largest street gangs in the country. In 1999, there were at least 600 Crips sets with more than 30,000 members transporting drugs in the United States.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, the Federal City Council turned its {{attention}} to crime rather than development. By this time, Washington, D.C., was suffering from an epidemic <b>of</b> <b>crack</b> <b>cocaine</b> use. The drug made an appearance in the United States in 1981, {{and by the end}} of 1986 was deeply entrenched in the District of Columbia. The following year, one study estimated that there were 24,000 drug dealers in the city (38.6 per 1,000 residents), with at least 14,000 of them dealing on a regular basis (at least one day per week). By one estimate, cocaine and crack cocaine use doubled in the city between 1986 and 1987. A private study estimated that one in six African American men in the city were arrested for selling illegal drugs before the age of 21, and by 1990 a shocking one in four African American men in the city had sold drugs before the age of 30. By 1990, the District of Columbia had the nation's highest rate of drug addiction (32.9 per 1,000 residents). The crack cocaine epidemic drove the city's murder rate in 1988 to 372, and 80 percent of the city's murders were drug-related. With drug-related crime outstripping by far economic development as the city's largest problem, in 1986 the Federal City Council joined with the Community Foundation, the Greater Washington Board of Trade, and the Greater Washington Research Center to form the Washington Fund for the Prevention of Substance Abuse. By October 1988, the Federal City Council also sponsored the creation of the Corporation Against Drug Abuse (CADA), an employer-funded entity to encourage the adoption of stricter drug testing and drug abuse policies in the workplace and to work against drug abuse generally in the community.|$|E

40|$|The final, {{definitive}} {{version of}} this article has been published in the Journal, Journal of Psychopharmacology, 22 (1), 2008, on SAGE Journals Online: [URL] - Copyright British Association for Psychopharmacology" DOI: 10. 1177 / 0269881107079170 A recent trend of escalating use of cocaine/crack cocaine was observed in the UK. The number of mentions on death certificates; last year use of cocaine; treatment demand, number of drug offenders, seizures, prices and average purity levels were the indicators used for this descriptive and correlational study. Figures (1990 - 2004) were taken from official UK sources. A total of 1022 cocaine/crack cocaine death mentions (i. e. deaths from any cause where the presence <b>of</b> cocaine/ <b>crack</b> <b>cocaine</b> was also detected) were identified, with cocaine/ <b>crack</b> <b>cocaine</b> being the sole drug mentioned in 36 % of cases. The number <b>of</b> cocaine/ <b>crack</b> <b>cocaine</b> death mentions showed a year-on-year increase and correlated positively with the following cocaine (powder) figures: last year use (p < 0. 001); number of offenders (p < 0. 001) and number of seizures (p < 0. 001), but correlated negatively with price (p < 0. 001). Furthermore, the number <b>of</b> cocaine/ <b>crack</b> <b>cocaine</b> death mentions correlated positively with the number <b>of</b> <b>crack</b> offenders (p < 0. 001) and seizures (p < 0. 001), but correlated negatively with both crack purity (p < 0. 001) and price (p < 0. 05). With conditions of increasing drug availability having been met in the UK, decrease in cocaine prices were associated with higher consumption levels and this, in turn, contributed to the increase in number of cocaine-related fatalities. There are limitations with the information collected, since no distinction is usually made on medical death certificates between <b>cocaine</b> and <b>crack</b> <b>cocaine.</b> The present study being an ecological one, it proved difficult to address the role of confounding variables that may well explain some of the associations observed...|$|R

500|$|In 1983, Rangel became {{chair of}} the Select Committee on Narcotics, which {{solidified}} his position as a leading strategist on this perennially important issue to him. [...] Rangel kept the committee going, {{in the face of}} the usual pressure to disband special committees. [...] He battled against proposed cutbacks in the federal anti-drug budget, and advocated increased grants to states and cities for better shelters for the homeless. [...] Rangel's amendments providing increased funding for state and local law enforcement were included in the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986. [...] He traveled to countries in Central and South America and elsewhere to inspect the sources of drugs and the law enforcement efforts against them; Ebony magazine termed Rangel [...] "a front-line general in the war against drugs." [...] Rangel said [...] "We need outrage!", making reference to the slow reaction by both government and religious leaders to the epidemics <b>of</b> <b>crack</b> <b>cocaine,</b> heroin, PCP, and other drugs that hit American streets during the 1980s. [...] He believed that legalizing drugs would represent [...] "moral and political suicide". [...] Nor did he refrain from criticizing those most affected by drugs, saying that Hispanic and black teenagers had no sense of self-preservation, and that drug dealers were so stupid that they had to eat in fast-food places because they could not read a menu. [...] By 1988, Rangel was saying that President Ronald Reagan had not done enough in the war on drugs, but that First Lady Nancy Reagan's [...] "Just Say No" [...] campaign had been quite valuable. [...] The narcotics committee itself was termed possibly the most important select committee of its time. [...] The Washington Post said Rangel was [...] "in a powerful position to shape policy on an issue at the top of the nation's agenda." [...] He would remain as {{chair of the}} committee through 1993, when it was abolished along with other House select committees.|$|E
500|$|Rainie's {{relationship}} with Phil Mitchell (McFadden) was first explored during her stint in 2010. Rainie and Phil {{were to be}} involved in a storyline involving the taking <b>of</b> <b>crack</b> <b>cocaine.</b> Discussing her return in 2010, she said she was pleased to be working closely with McFadden as they had not worked together. Franks explained that after being thrown out of the house by Tanya's ex-husband Max, and moving in with Phil that, [...] "it gets quite dark and dirty, really. Phil and Rainie are two people who meet at a point in their lives where they both see something equivalent in each other. He offers her something that she wants, and that is a place to be, while she has something that he wants, and that's drugs—so it's a match at that time." [...] Franks was given advice from the charity DrugScope on how to act the part and also undertook some of her own research, and she said she believed the scenes to be very realistic. She wanted the drugs storyline to help people, saying, [...] "If {{there are people who have}} a drugs problem, or an addiction problem of any kind really, they might watch something like this and it could trigger something in their mind that is relevant to them, or someone that they know. Hopefully it could make people think twice about carrying on with that, and perhaps look into getting some help. The organisation that we worked with, DrugScope, gives a lot of help and advice for people with drug addictions. I think it can be hugely helpful when a show as popular as EastEnders does something like this." [...] She also stated that if EastEnders [...] "has saved one life by putting this story out it's been worth it. The whole point of soaps is to reflect a certain amount of everyday life.

500|$|Dwyane Wade {{was born}} on the South Side of Chicago, Illinois, to JoLinda and Dwyane Wade Sr, whose name's unusual {{spelling}} was decided by his own mother. In 1977, JoLinda, {{at the age of}} 18, already had two children. Wade has described his upbringing in Chicago as being very difficult. Wade stated that [...] " [...] mom was on drugs and [...] family was in the gang environment, so it was a rough childhood." [...] At a very young age, Wade already witnessed police raids and found dead bodies several times in a nearby garbage can. When he was only 4 months old, his parents separated – and would later divorce. Jolinda was given custody of the two children, and she moved to her mother's house with them. The family struggled financially, and it was around that time when Jolinda started dealing drugs. His mom was addicted to several substances including cigarettes, alcohol, heroin, and cocaine. JoLinda would get high with friends at her home, even in the presence of her children. In an interview with ESPN, Wade said [...] "I've seen the needles laying around the house. I've seen my mother shoot up before. I've seen a lot of things my mother didn't even know I'd seen as a kid." [...] At the age of 6, he recalls police – with guns drawn – raiding his home as they searched for his mother. When Wade turned 8 years old, his older sister, Tragil, tricked him – by telling him they were going to the movies – into living with his father, a former Army sergeant, and stepmother in a nearby neighborhood. Wade would still occasionally visit his mom. A year later, his father moved the family to Robbins, Illinois. After moving to Robbins, Wade didn't see his mother for two years. During this time, JoLinda was able to access a free supply of drugs by volunteering to be a tester – i.e., someone who tests street drugs for impurities before the dealers try to sell them. JoLinda was hospitalized and nearly died after she mistakenly injected herself with LSD. In 1994, JoLinda was arrested for possession <b>of</b> <b>crack</b> <b>cocaine</b> with intent to sell and locked up in Cook County Jail. Wade, at the age of 10, reunited with his mom by talking with her at Cook County Jail through a glass panel over a telephone. JoLinda served 23 months in prison for her crimes, but while serving her second sentence in 1997, she failed to report to prison while on work release.|$|E
