The study used a quantitative research methodology; the model was tested using data collected via an online questionnaire and hypothesized relationships were tested using a statistical technique known as structural equation modelling.

40|$|This article {{assesses the}} extent to which {{security}} regimes are the products of authorization in the thought of Thomas Hobbes and Carl Schmitt. The Hobbesian security regime offers a contingent construction <b>of</b> <b>security</b> in terms <b>of</b> processes of authorization and brings into view questions about the epistemic construction <b>of</b> <b>security</b> within security discourse today. The Schmittian concept <b>of</b> <b>security</b> involves the naturalization <b>of</b> <b>security</b> through the state, meaning that security is understood as condition rather than regime. Rather than look to Carl Schmitt’s concept <b>of</b> <b>security</b> as the paradigm <b>of</b> international <b>security</b> today, there are clear benefits in returning to the contractual account <b>of</b> <b>security</b> evident in the Hobbesian emphasis on authorization. Security is not the primary value of political community, but the means by which political communities realize their internal goods.

Although State had developed extensive plans to make a competitive award before DynCorp's existing contract expired, State determined that because of an ever-changing scope of work, it needed to prepare a completely new solicitation incorporating a different statement of work and various program changes. As a result, State could not award a new competitive contract before DynCorp's contract expired. The documentation shows {{that because of the}} contractor's magnitude, DynCorp's past experience on the job made it the only qualified contractor able to provide the services without interruption. As required, State publicized each of its decisions to use noncompetitive procedures for the interim contract extensions to allow potential offerors to challenge the decisions, but no firms expressed interest in competing for the awards. In awarding the current contract to DynCorp, State complied with the requirements for making a competitive award and also took discretionary steps to promote increased competition, such as holding a pre-proposal conference with potential <b>offerors.</b> <b>Of</b> the two proposals it received, State determined that DynCorp's was technically superior and cost less, thus representing the best value to the government. ...|$|R

In 2005, ACU was reported to be operating out of office space in the Tivoli Building, a Victorian building in downtown Cheyenne, Wyoming.

ACU reported in 2005 that 300 students were enrolled worldwide. The school is alleged to have marketed an MBA program in Vietnam that did not deliver the promised value to the students it enrolled. After Wyoming enacted a law requiring higher education institutions in the state to be accredited or in the process of obtaining accreditation by July 1, 2006, several unaccredited schools closed down or left the state.
