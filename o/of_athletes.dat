The researcher uses the descriptive method, using sample study, on some of colleges, institutes and departments <b>of</b> <b>athlete</b> studies teachers’ in the West Bank. The sample consists of 55 male and female teachers and they were intentionally chosen. The questionnaire was used as a means of collecting data, it consists of; the educational role <b>of</b> <b>athlete</b> media that deals with five dimensions (the athlete media dimension towards the individuals in Palestinian society, the athlete media dimension towards the healthy behavior, towards health and personality, towards health and nutrition and towards health and fitness).

The results show that the role of media in raising the level <b>of</b> <b>athlete</b> health education, from the perception <b>of</b> colleges <b>of</b> <b>athlete</b> studies’ teachers was moderate. The study recommended to consider the topic <b>of</b> <b>athlete</b> media as one of colleges topics in Palestine, due to its basic role in raising the level of health education to athletes and society. the increase of media role in covering topics related health skills of Palestinian individuals, has great importance in increasing the level of health education...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: to scientifically {{substantiate}} {{the method}} of contactless determination <b>of</b> <b>athlete</b> hand’s movements in Olympic exercises with pistol.

Results: we tested innovative method of contactless measuring <b>of</b> <b>athlete’s</b> hand’s micro movements in finalizing phase of shooting cycle. We found uncontrolled deviations from optimal pistol pointing position in vertical, horizontal and sagittal planes. Quickness <b>of</b> <b>athlete</b> hand’s movements in shooting process was determined. Conclusions: we scientifically substantiated {{the method of}} contactless determination <b>of</b> <b>athlete</b> hand’s movements at a distance in Olympic exercises with pistol.

40|$|Perfectionism {{has been}} {{identified}} as an antecedent <b>of</b> <b>athlete</b> burnout. However, to date, researchers examining the relationship between perfectionism and athlete burnout have measured perfectionism at a trait level. The work of Flett and colleagues (Flett, Hewitt, Blankstein, & Gray, 1998) suggests that perfectionism can also be assessed in terms of individual differences in the frequency with which they experience perfectionistic cognitions. The aims of this study were to: (1) examine the relationship between the frequency of perfectionistic cognitions and symptoms <b>of</b> <b>athlete</b> burnout; and (2) determine whether the frequency of perfectionistic cognitions account for additional unique variance in symptoms <b>of</b> <b>athlete</b> burnout above the variance accounted for by self-oriented and socially prescribed dimensions of perfectionism. Two-hundred and two male rugby players (mean age 18. 8 years, s¼ 2. 9, range 16 – 24) were recruited from youth teams of professional and semi-professional rugby union clubs in the UK. Participants completed measures of trait perfectionism, frequency of perfectionistic cognitions, and symptoms <b>of</b> <b>athlete</b> burnout. The frequency of perfectionistic cognitions was positively related to all symptoms <b>of</b> <b>athlete</b> burnout and explained 3 – 4 % unique variance in symptoms <b>of</b> <b>athlete</b> burnout after controlling for self-oriented and socially prescribed dimensions of perfectionism. Findings suggest that the frequency with which perfectionistic cognitions are experienced may also be an antecedent <b>of</b> <b>athlete</b> burnout. Perfectionistic cognitions should, therefore, be considered in both future models of the relationship between perfectionism and athlete burnout, as well as interventions aimed at reducing perfectionism fuelled burnout...|$|R
