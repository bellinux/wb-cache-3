40|$|This study investigates {{a recent}} {{phenomenon}} {{in the market for}} technology: <b>online</b> <b>marketplaces</b> for technological inventions, which support the listing, search, and exchange of technological inventions by sellers and buyers. Focusing on three salient theoretical factors that affect markets for technology – search costs, ambiguity about the underlying knowledge and its applications, and expropriation concerns – our research systematically explores which industries are served by <b>online</b> <b>marketplaces.</b> We exploit the fact that the magnitude of these factors varies across industries and identify key features of <b>online</b> <b>marketplaces</b> that may address these factors. Our proprietary dataset covers 12 <b>online</b> <b>marketplaces</b> for technology and spans over 140 industries. The results indicate that <b>online</b> <b>marketplaces</b> are more likely to serve an industry with (a) a higher cost of searching for technologies in that industry, (b) greater ambiguity about the underlying technology’s potential applications across industries, and (c) greater ability to protect inventions from expropriation...|$|R

50|$|<b>Online</b> <b>marketplaces</b> {{are one of}} the {{two major}} types of online {{websites}} students can use to sell used textbooks. <b>Online</b> <b>marketplaces</b> may have an online auction format or may allow the student to list their books for a fixed price.

Unlike campus buyback and online book, students are unlikely to sell all their books to one buyer using <b>online</b> <b>marketplaces,</b> and will likely have to send out multiple books individually.|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>Online</b> <b>marketplaces</b> {{constitute}} one of {{the most}} successful business innovations of the Web 2. 0. Nonetheless so far no branding theory has been connected to the topic of two-sided <b>online</b> <b>marketplaces.</b> This might be due to the high complexity and reciprocity of their value creation which however needs to be in order to apply any marketing and branding strategies.   Purpose:       Therefore, the purpose is to understand and clarify the value creation processes of two-sided <b>online</b> <b>marketplaces</b> and develop branding theory based on the findings thereof.   Method:        Within this thesis we conducted qualitative research.   The study is built on semi-structured interviews with 15 respondents that have used various two-sided <b>online</b> <b>marketplaces</b> either as sellers and buyers.   Conclusion: In order to understand the various variables of two-sided <b>online</b> <b>marketplaces</b> business model, we have identified, conceptualized and extended an integrative model to manage and brand their value. With the knowledge resulting from our literature review we built a model illustrating all pillars which influence value creation and thus brand perception and extended this model with the results of our own research. We have identified that while user behavior and preferences generally remain heterogeneous, commonalities such as social influences and convenience stick out most often for both user sides. Both pillars have barely been covered by research, which solely focused on network effects, price allocation and trust...|$|R

2500|$|Matteo Pasquinelli reckons {{the basis}} for the belief that PageRank has a social {{component}} lies in the idea of attention economy. With attention economy, value is placed on products that receive a greater amount of human attention and the results {{at the top of the}} PageRank garner a larger amount of focus then those on subsequent pages. The outcomes with the higher PageRank will therefore enter the human consciousness to a larger extent. These ideas can influence decision-making and the actions of the viewer have a direct relation to the PageRank. They possess a higher potential to attract a user’s attention as their location increases the attention economy attached to the site. With this location they can receive more traffic and their <b>online</b> <b>marketplace</b> will have more purchases. The PageRank of these sites allow them to be trusted and they are able to parlay this trust into increased business.|$|E
2500|$|Critics {{say that}} Tor {{is not as}} secure as it claims, {{pointing}} to U.S. law enforcement's investigations and shutdowns of Tor-using sites such as web-hosting company Freedom Hosting and <b>online</b> <b>marketplace</b> Silk Road. In October 2013, after analyzing documents leaked by Edward Snowden, The Guardian reported that the NSA had repeatedly tried to crack Tor and had failed to break its core security, although it had had some success attacking the computers of individual Tor users. The Guardian also published a 2012 NSA classified slide deck, entitled [...] "Tor Stinks", which said: [...] "We {{will never be able}} to de-anonymize all Tor users all the time", but [...] "with manual analysis we can de-anonymize a very small fraction of Tor users". When Tor users are arrested, it is typically due to human error, not to the core technology being hacked or cracked. On 7 November 2014, for example, a joint operation by the FBI, ICE Homeland Security investigations and European Law enforcement agencies led to 17 arrests and the seizure of 27 sites containing 400 pages. A late 2014 report by Der Spiegel using a new cache of Snowden leaks revealed, however, that [...] the NSA deemed Tor on its own as a [...] "major threat" [...] to its mission, and when used in conjunction with other privacy tools such as OTR, Cspace, ZRTP, RedPhone, Tails, and TrueCrypt was ranked as [...] "catastrophic," [...] leading to a [...] "near-total loss/lack of insight to target communications, presence..." ...|$|E
