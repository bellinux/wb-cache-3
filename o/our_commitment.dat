25|$|I {{turned to}} Walter and said, “This movie is {{somewhat}} weirder than we thought.”... We just didn’t anticipate what {{the combination of}} elements was going to be. We had a very conscious design concept of the movie, but I think we didn’t fully grasp how strong it would be, {{in terms of the}} combination of elements. In a way, I think Streets of Fire was about expanding The Warriors concept to a bigger stage. But when expanding it to a bigger scale, it changed. The movie’s bigness of size—compositionally—changed the meaning of things and made it more of a fairy tale... The Warriors, it was bewoven with a unique sense of realism. The fact that they made a deal with real gangs to be extras in the film. There was a true Godardian dialectic going on between artifice and reality. It’s a very real-world film, in some respects, but it’s very artificial at the same time... We did that again, but we put the emphasis on the artifice. And we didn’t fully…I want to say we had too much integrity. We went further with that, perhaps, than we should have. I don’t know. I can’t put everything together about what didn’t work, but the most damaging thing is that we didn’t have the right actor for Tom Cody. Maybe if we’d had Tom Cruise, we might have had a success. But <b>our</b> <b>commitment</b> to be stylized was thorough and conscious and maybe too extreme for the mainstream audience.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this article, we {{articulate}} {{a framework for}} making <b>our</b> <b>commitments</b> to racial justice actionable, a framework that moves from narrating confessional accounts to articulating <b>our</b> <b>commitments</b> and then acting on them through both self-work and work-with-others, a dialectic possibility we identify and explore. We model a method for moving beyond originary confessional narratives and engage in dialogue with "the willingness to be disturbed, " (Wheatley, 2002) believing that disturbances are productive places from which we can more clearly {{articulate a}}nd act from <b>our</b> <b>commitments.</b> Drawing on <b>our</b> own experiences, we engage the political, systemic, and enduring nature of racism as we together chart an educational frame that counters the macro-logics of oppression enacted daily through micro-inequities. As we advocate for additional and ongoing considerations {{of the work of}} anti-racism in educational settings, we invite others to embrace, along with us, both the willingness to be disturbed and the attention to making commitments actionable.
