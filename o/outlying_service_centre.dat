40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} run-time management of a <b>service</b> <b>centre</b> energy efficiency by using a context aware self-adapting algorithm. The algorithm considers the <b>service</b> <b>centre</b> current context situation and predefined Green/Key Performance Indicators (GPI/KPI) to adapt and optimize the <b>service</b> <b>centre</b> energy consumption to the incoming workload. The <b>service</b> <b>centre</b> energy performance context situation is obtained by collecting <b>service</b> <b>centre</b> current context data related to the business applications scheduled to run on <b>service</b> <b>centre</b> resources, <b>service</b> <b>centre</b> IT computing resources and the <b>service</b> <b>centre</b> facilities. A reinforcement learning approach is used to decide the best sequence of actions to be executed to bring the <b>service</b> <b>centre</b> resources {{as close as possible}} to a GPI and KPI compliant state while minimizing the energy consumption...|$|R
