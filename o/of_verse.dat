25|$|The Rigveda is {{the largest}} of the four Vedas, and many <b>of</b> its <b>verses</b> appear in the other Vedas. Almost all <b>of</b> the 1,875 <b>verses</b> found in Samaveda are taken from {{different}} parts of the Rigveda, either once or as repetition, and rewritten in a chant song form. The Books 8 and 9 of the Rigveda are by far the largest source <b>of</b> <b>verses</b> for Sama Veda. The Book 10 contributes the largest number <b>of</b> the 1,350 <b>verses</b> <b>of</b> Rigveda found in Atharvaveda, or about one fifth <b>of</b> the 5,987 <b>verses</b> in the Atharvaveda text.

5|$|The form of {{this ancient}} Greek poetry is an elegiac couplet, {{commonly}} used for epitaphs. Some English renderings are given in the table below. It is also an example of Laconian brevity, a spartan style <b>of</b> <b>verse</b> that allows for varying interpretations {{of the meaning of}} the poem. Ioannis Ziogas points out that the usual English translations are far from the only interpretation possible, and indicate much about the romantic tendencies of the translators.|$|E
5|$|They {{made all}} these {{different}} bits up, not thinking in terms <b>of</b> <b>verse,</b> chorus, bridge or {{what was going to}} go where, just coming up with all these sections of chanting, rapping and singing, which we recorded all higgledy-piggledy. And then we just sewed it together. It was rather like the way we'd been working on the dance remixes we'd been doing before. Kind of a cut-and-paste method.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{relevant}} words are of slightly uncertain meaning, it seems fairly clear that Völundr {{is described as}} one of the elves in Völundarkviða. As his most prominent deed in the poem is to rape Böðvildr, the poem associates elves with being a sexual threat to maidens. The same idea is present in two post-classical Eddaic poems, which are also influenced by chivalric romance or Breton lais, Kötludraumur and Gullkársljóð. The idea also occurs in later traditions in Scandinavia and beyond, so may be an early attestation of a prominent tradition. Elves also appear in a couple <b>of</b> <b>verse</b> spells, including the Bergen rune-charm from among the Bryggen inscriptions.|$|E

5|$|He {{was born}} in Sandymount, Ireland and educated there and in London. He spent {{childhood}} holidays in County Sligo and studied poetry {{from an early age}} when he became fascinated by Irish legends and the occult. These topics feature in the first phase of his work, which lasted roughly until the turn of the 20th century. His earliest volume <b>of</b> <b>verse</b> was published in 1889, and its slow-paced and lyrical poems display Yeats's debts to Edmund Spenser, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and the poets of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. From 1900, his poetry grew more physical and realistic. He largely renounced the transcendental beliefs of his youth, though he remained preoccupied with physical and spiritual masks, as well as with cyclical theories of life. In 1923, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.|$|E
5|$|The First World War {{brought an}} end to Hornung's fictional output. His son, Oscar, was killed at the Second Battle of Ypres in July 1915. Hornung joined the YMCA, {{initially}} in England, then in France, where he helped run a canteen and library. He published two collections of poetry during the war, and then, afterwards, one further volume <b>of</b> <b>verse</b> and an account of his time spent in France, Notes of a Camp-Follower on the Western Front. Hornung's fragile constitution was further weakened by the stress of his war work. To aid his recuperation, {{he and his wife}} visited the south of France in 1921. He fell ill from influenza on the journey, and died on 22 March 1921, aged 54.|$|E

Sigurd asks for her name, and the woman gives Sigurd a horn of mead to help him retain her words in his memory. The woman recites a heathen prayer in two stanzas. A prose narrative explains that the woman is named Sigrdrífa and {{that she is a}} valkyrie.|$|E
50|$|A common myth {{persists}} {{that the}} number <b>of</b> <b>verses</b> in the Quran is 6,666. In fact, the total number <b>of</b> <b>verses</b> in all chapters is 6,236, although this varies depending on how (or if) the Bismillah appearing {{at the start of}} each chapter is counted.|$|R

5|$|In architecture, {{the huge}} profits of the spice trade financed a sumptuous {{composite}} {{style in the}} first decades of the 16th century, the Manueline, incorporating maritime elements. The primary painters were Nuno Gonçalves, Gregório Lopes and Vasco Fernandes. In music, Pedro de Escobar and Duarte Lobo produced four songbooks, including the Cancioneiro de Elvas. In literature, Sá de Miranda introduced Italian forms <b>of</b> <b>verse.</b> Bernardim Ribeiro developed pastoral romance, plays by Gil Vicente fused it with popular culture, reporting the changing times, and Luís de Camões inscribed the Portuguese feats overseas in the epic poem Os Lusíadas. Travel literature especially flourished: João de Barros, Castanheda, António Galvão, Gaspar Correia, Duarte Barbosa, and Fernão Mendes Pinto, among others, described new lands and were translated and spread with the new printing press. After joining the Portuguese exploration of Brazil in 1500, Amerigo Vespucci coined the term New World, in his letters to Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici.|$|E
5|$|Well-known poets of the Edwardian {{era of the}} 1890s, such as Alfred Austin, Stephen Phillips, and William Watson, {{had been}} working {{very much in the}} shadow of Tennyson, {{producing}} weak imitations of the poetry of the Victorian era. They continued to work in this vein into {{the early years of the}} 20th century. As the new century opened, Austin was still the serving British Poet Laureate, a post he held up to 1913. In the century's first decade, poetry still had a large audience; volumes <b>of</b> <b>verse</b> published in that time included Thomas Hardy's The Dynasts, Christina Rossetti's posthumous Poetical Works, Ernest Dowson's Poems, George Meredith's Last Poems, Robert Service's Ballads of a Cheechako and John Masefield's Ballads and Poems. Future Nobel Prize winner William Butler Yeats was devoting much of his energy to the Abbey Theatre and writing for the stage, producing relatively little lyric poetry during this period. In 1907, the Nobel Prize for Literature was awarded to Rudyard Kipling.|$|E
5|$|By 1870, Morris {{had become}} a public figure in Britain, {{resulting}} in repeated press requests for photographs, which he despised. That year, he also reluctantly agreed to sit for a portrait by establishment painter George Frederic Watts. Morris was keenly interested in Icelandic literature, having befriended the Icelandic theologian Eiríkr Magnússon. Together they produced prose translations of the Eddas and Sagas for publication in English. Morris also developed {{a keen interest in}} creating handwritten illuminated manuscripts, producing 18 such books between 1870 and 1875, the first of which was A Book <b>of</b> <b>Verse,</b> completed as a birthday present for Georgina Burne-Jones. 12 of these 18 were handwritten copies of Nordic tales such as Halfdan the Black, Frithiof the Bold, and The Dwellers of Eyr. Morris deemed calligraphy to be an art form, and taught himself both Roman and italic script, as well as learning how to produce gilded letters. In November 1872 he published Love is Enough, a poetic drama based on a story in the Medieval Welsh text, the Mabinogion. Illustrated with Burne-Jones woodcuts, it was not a popular success. By 1871, he had begun work on a novel set in the present, The Novel on Blue Paper, which was about a love triangle; it would remain unfinished and Morris later asserted that it was not well written.|$|E
50|$|During this movement, {{language}} use went from Galician-Portuguese to Castilian. Octosyllable, twelve syllables, and <b>verse</b> <b>of</b> arte mayor were becoming the footing <b>of</b> <b>verses.</b> Main themes derive from Provençal poetry. This form of poetry was generally compilations <b>of</b> <b>verses</b> formed into books, {{also known as}} cancioneros. Main works include Cancionero de Baena, Cancionero de Estuniga, and Cancionero General. Other important works from this era include parts of Dance of Death, Dialogue Between Love and an Old Man, <b>verses</b> <b>of</b> Mingo Revulgo, and <b>verses</b> <b>of</b> the Baker Woman.|$|R

5|$|In the 1930s, Cowell's student Lou Harrison {{utilized}} keyboard clusters {{in several}} {{works such as}} his Prelude for Grandpiano (1937). At least {{as far back as}} 1942, John Cage, who also studied under Cowell, began writing piano pieces with cluster chords; In the Name of the Holocaust, from December of that year, includes chromatic, diatonic, and pentatonic clusters. Olivier Messiaen's Vingt regards sur l'enfant Jésus (1944), often described as the most important solo piano piece {{of the first half of}} the twentieth century, employs clusters throughout. They would feature in numerous subsequent piano works, by a range of composers. Karlheinz Stockhausen's Klavierstück X (1961) makes bold, rhetorical use of chromatic clusters, scaled in seven degrees of width, from three to thirty-six semitones, as well as ascending and descending cluster arpeggios and cluster glissandi. Written two decades later, his Klavierstück XIII employs many of the same techniques, along with clusters that call for the pianist to sit down on the keyboard. George Crumb's Apparitions, Elegiac Songs, and Vocalises for Soprano and Amplified Piano (1979), a setting <b>of</b> <b>verse</b> by Walt Whitman, is filled with clusters, including an enormous one that introduces three of its sections. The piano part of the second movement of Joseph Schwantner's song cycle Magabunda (1983) has perhaps the single largest chord ever written for an individual instrument: all 88 notes on the keyboard.|$|E
