Oliver was not slow to try adrenal {{extracts}} in patients, orally again and rather indiscriminately, from Addison's disease, hypotension (″loss of vasomotor tone″), Diabetes mellitus and Diabetes insipidus to Graves' disease (″exophthalmic goitre″). It seems he adhered to contemporary ideas of <b>organotherapy,</b> believing that powerful substances existed in tissues {{and ought to}} be discovered for medicinal use. In fact he immediately went on to extract the pituitary gland and, again with Schäfer, discovered vasopressin. In 1903 adrenaline, meanwhile purified, was first used in asthma. The use was based, not on the bronchodilator effect, which was discovered later, but on the vasoconstrictor effect, which was hoped to alleviate the “turgidity of the bronchial mucosa” – presumably vascular congestion and edema. Also as of 1903, adrenaline was added to local anesthetic solutions. The surgeon Heinrich Braun in Leipzig showed that it prolonged the anesthesia at the injection site and simultaneously reduced ″systemic″ effects elsewhere in the body.|$|E
50|$|Henry Robert Harrower, MD (1883-1934) was a {{controversial}} early figure in endocrinology, {{and the author}} of several books and many papers on the subject. He was the impetus for the foundation of the Association for the Study of Internal Secretions, now called The Endocrine Society, and edited the first two editions of their journal Endocrinology. He was known for his advocacy of <b>organotherapy,</b> which involved consuming various glands and at times other parts of the body. He experienced financial success for this practice. Endocrinologists disdained these practices, believing that only the thyroid gland could have a meaningful effect when consumed orally. Harrower's <b>organotherapy</b> was the subject of repeated criticism. As he was the main proponent of the movement, it faded after his death.|$|E
50|$|<b>Organotherapy</b> is a {{technique}} that makes use of extracts derived from animal or human tissues to treat medical conditions. The practice of treating an organ with the same one derived from another creature, known as similia similibus, was familiar to the Ancient Greeks and Romans; consuming brain tissue was considered a potential treatment for those of low intellect for instance.|$|E

When he was 20 years old he {{traveled}} to Battle Creek, Michigan to enroll in the American Medical Missionary College after studying for three years in Scandinavia to become a masseuse. At the Seventh-day Adventist college he learned, and was receptive to, the alternative therapy teachings of John Harvey Kellogg. He graduated and spent several years in France and Italy, traveling {{back and forth between}} Europe and the United States. It was during this time he became interested in advocating <b>organotherapy.</b> In 1912, he published his book, Practical Hormone Therapy, which dealt with organotherapeutic practices. He eventually settled in an exclusive suburb in Glendale, California and established The Harrower Laboratory and Clinic.|$|E

40|$|IN 1889 Brown-Sequard, 1 then 72 years old, {{injected}} a testicular extract into {{himself and}} felt a return of his youthful sense of well-being. Little substance remains from this early experiment in human <b>organotherapy</b> al-though historians speak of an impetus given thereby to endocrine research. Such extracts of the testis are inactive in simple objective tests, and the sub-jective and probably imaginative character of Brown-Sequard's response never inspired much confidence in his interpretation of testicular function. Nevertheless the very prominence of this experiment {{in the history of}} endo-crinology has served to keep alive Brown-Sequard's guiding thought that the testis might exert some invigorating influence upon human somatic tissue. The physician aware of the manifestations of precocious puberty has often reflected on the meaning of the frequent association between advancement of somatic growth and sexual maturation. It has occurred to him that the androgens themselves might share in the construction of non-genital tissue although until recently he has lacked the experimental means to press th...|$|E

40|$|MANY HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS often {{dismiss the}} concept of {{alternative}} medicine without {{a full understanding of}} its practices and the scope of its use by the public. As the pub-lic's interest in alternative medicine increases and more in-formation is made available to them through various me-dia, there is a greater need for healthcare providers to be informed of the scope and limitations of alternative medi-cine. The objective of this commentary is to discuss the growing pattern of alternative medicine use in the general public and research initiatives that are being undertaken in this field. We also address some of the concerns and re-sponsibilities that face us as healthcare providers. The term alternative medicine describes a number of very diverse therapeutic options. Well-known alternative therapies, some of which have become mainstream, in-clude acupuncture, chiropractic therapy, homeopathy, hyp-nosis, relaxation techniques, herbal remedies, and nutri-tional therapy. ' Less-familiar therapies include color therapy, music therapy, biofeedback, <b>organotherapy,</b> and therapeu-tic touch. Unfortunately, as a single term, "alternative" clouds distinctions among various treatments, some ac-cepted as beneficial and others as relatively useless. ' Regardless of the therapy to which the term alternative medicine is referring, it often carries a negative connota-tion among healthcare providers. In conventional medical literature, alternative medicine has often been considered unorthodox medicine, quackery, unconventional medicine, or unproved medicine. It has typically been portrayed as...|$|E
40|$|The {{emergence}} of new medical science in the mid- 19 th century was usually greeted with derision by “practical men ” who saw their academic colleagues as elitist intellec-tuals whose work bore little or {{no relation to the}} rough-and-tumble aspects of patient care. This schism, which was nowhere greater than in the field of endocrinology, wid-ened in 1891 when a myxedematous patient was dramat-ically restored to health after the administration of a thyroid extract. On the one hand, academicians—who saw this result as a triumphal example of the transference of laboratory studies to the bedside—were encouraged to pursue further studies in endocrine pathophysiology and pharmacology. On the other hand, medical practitioners began to believe that crude extracts from glands or other organs, when prescribed as orally administered mixtures, were effective for the treatment of most human ailments. The organotherapeutic forces were ably championed by Henry R. Harrower, MD, a manufacturer as well as a dispenser of organotherapeutic products. For some years, the claims of the organotherapists remained unchal-lenged. Finally, in 1921, Harvey Cushing, pioneer neurosur-geon and endocrinologist, launched a crushing assault on the purveyors of pluriglandular therapy. These attacks con-tinued over ensuing years, and <b>organotherapy</b> fell into disre-pute. Nevertheless, the assertions of “practical men ” have not subsided; rather, we are now confronted by insistent claims for a bewildering array of herbal remedies, over-the-counter hormonal products, and alternative therapies.

40|$|Total Thyroidectomy (TT) is a gold {{standard}} for benign bilateral pathologies and malignant pathologies of the thyroid. TT has numerous advantages over less radical approaches, such as {{the resolution of the}} thyroid pathology, avoidance of recurrences, and improved response to life-long substitutive <b>organotherapy.</b> TT has a negligible rate of recurrence. Near Total Thyroidectomy (NTT) is associated with a low rate of recurrence. Subtotal Thyroidectomy (ST), in which a portion of the thyroid gland is deliberately left in the thyroid lodge, has a considerably higher rate of recurrence. The incidence of complications with TT is similar to that with other techniques of thyroid exeresis. However, despite the radical intent of surgeons, a real TT is not always carried out. The complete removal of all the thyroid tissue employing TT is not the norm and micro/macroscopic remnants almost always remain. The literature on these tissue remnants is often based on techniques that are not very accurate in terms of determining the diameters of the tissue remaining. In our study, conducted by colour echo-doppler of the thyroid lodge in 102 patients who had undergone TT for benign thyroid pathologies, we demonstrated significant thyroid tissue remnants after TT in 34 cases of 102 (33, 3 %). Therefore, {{out of a total of}} 102 so-called "total thyroidectomies", only 68 (66, 7 %) were really total, whereas 12 patients (11, 76 %) had near total thyroidectomy, leaving tissue remnants or = 1 cm...|$|E
40|$|The {{biological}} {{effects of}} the testes and testosterone are known since antiquity. Aristotle knew the effects of castration and his hypothesis on fertilization {{is one of the}} first scientific encounters in reproductive biology. Over centuries, castration has been performed as punishment and to produce obedient slaves, but also to preserve the soprano voices of prepubertal boys. The Chinese imperial (and other oriental) courts employed castrates as overseers in harems who often obtained high-ranking political positions. The era of testis transplantation and <b>organotherapy</b> was initiated by John Hunter in London who transplanted testes into capons in 1786. The intention of his experiments was to prove the 'vital principle' as the basis for modern transplantation medicine, but Hunter did not consider endocrine aspects. Arnold Adolph Berthold postulated internal secretion from his testicular transplantation experiments in 1849 in Göttingen and is thus considered the father of endocrinology. Following his observations, testicular preparations were used for therapy, popularized by self-experiments by Charles-Edouard Brown-Séquard in Paris (1889), which can at best have placebo effects. In the 1920 s Sergio Voronoff transplanted testes from animals to men, but their effectiveness was disproved. Today testicular transplantation is being refined by stem cell research and germ cell transplantation. Modern androgen therapy started in 1935 when Enrest Lacquer isolated testosterone from bull testes in Amsterdam. In the same year testosterone was chemically synthesized independently by Adolf Butenandt in Göttingen and Leopold Ruzicka in Basel. Since testosterone was ineffective orally it was either compressed into subcutaneous pellets or was used orally as 17 α-methyl testosterone, now obsolete because of liver toxicity. The early phases of testosterone treatment coincide with the first description of the most prominent syndromes of hypogonadism by Klinefelter, by Kallmann, DelCastillo and Pasqualini. In the 1950 s longer-acting injectable testosterone enanthate became the preferred therapeutic modality. In the 1950 s and 1960 s, research concentrated on the chemical modification of androgens in order to emphasize their anabolic effects. Although anabolic steroids have largely disappeared from clinical medicine, they continue to live an illegal life for doping in athletics. In the 1970 s the orally effective testosterone undecanoate was added to the spectrum of preparations. Recent transdermal gels and long-acting injectable preparations provide options for physiological testosterone substitution therapy...|$|E
40|$|S INCE {{the early}} days of medicine, when each organ had its real or fancied attri-butes, the idea of {{restoring}} function to a deranged part by the administration of tissue from a normal organ has seemed attractive. However little the effort then availed, the principle has in recent years given <b>organotherapy</b> many important agents such as insulin and liver extract. With the development of the science of immunology it seemed only natural that, instead of using organs per se, attempts be made to produce an antiserum to each. Certainly if such a preparation had any effect, either stimulant or depressant, there would be opened up a new field of almost unlimited possibilities. The problem was defined by Metchnikoff,’ 1 who called such antisera ‘ ‘cytotoxic” in the belief that their effect on the cells of the body was a toxic one. He injected splenic tissue into animals in an attempt to make an antispleen serum, but soon abandoned this work, primarily because of the difliculties in determining what, if any, titer of antiserum he was working with. Funck,’#{ 176 } Flexner,’ 8 and Bunting’#{ 176 } used other tissues, such as lymph nodes and bone marrow, as antigens with indiffer-ent results. More recently, in 1936, Chew, Stephens, and Lawrence’ 3 reported that an antileukocytic serum produced in some guinea pigs an almost complete {{reduction in the number of}} neutrophil leukocytes in the peripheral blood. Earlier work by Ledingham and Bedson, 24 Bedson, ’ Lindstrom, 26 Okita, 35 and Matsuno 29 had given essentially similar results. Although this effect was striking, a satisfactory technic for titrating the antisera was still not available. The present study was stimulated by the recently reported Russian work in which a new technic for the titration of “cytotoxic ” serum was used. Marchuk,’ 7 ’ 28 Bogomolets and his colleagues have named this serum “anti-reticular cytotoxic serum. ” The claims made for its therapeutic application are many. 29 ’ 11, 12, 1 - 1, 17, 20, 22, 23, 25, 3033. ‘ ‘#{ 149 } Although they are yet to be confirmed, and the mode of action elucidated, the standardization of a method of preparation of antisera and for their titration offers renewed hope that fundamental problems of hematology and allied fields can be attacked with this new tool...|$|E
