5|$|Internal realism was {{the view}} that, {{although}} {{the world may}} be causally independent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>mind,</b> {{the structure of the}} world—its division into kinds, individuals and categories—is a function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>mind,</b> and hence the world is not ontologically independent. The general idea is influenced by Kant's idea of the dependence of our knowledge of the world on the categories of thought.|$|E
5|$|Consciously or unconsciously, most theists see in {{gods and}} devils, heaven and hell, reward and punishment, a whip to lash the people into obedience, meekness and contentment.... The {{philosophy}} of Atheism expresses the expansion and growth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>mind.</b> The philosophy of theism, {{if we can}} call it a philosophy, is static and fixed.|$|E
5|$|Anarchism, then, really {{stands for}} the liberation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>mind</b> from the {{dominion}} of religion; the liberation {{of the human body}} from the dominion of property; liberation from the shackles and restraint of government. Anarchism stands for a social order based on the free grouping of individuals for the purpose of producing real social wealth; an order that will guarantee to every human being free access to the earth and full enjoyment of the necessities of life, according to individual desires, tastes, and inclinations.|$|E
50|$|WMCF (p. 81) {{likewise}} {{criticizes the}} emphasis mathematicians place on <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> closure. Lakoff and Núñez argue that <b>the</b> expectation <b>of</b> closure is an artifact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>mind's</b> {{ability to relate}} fundamentally different concepts via metaphor.|$|R
50|$|It is {{difficult}} to avoid the impression that a miracle confronts us here, quite comparable in its striking nature to the miracle that <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>mind</b> can string a thousand arguments together without getting itself into contradictions, or to <b>the</b> two miracles <b>of</b> laws of nature and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>mind's</b> capacity to divine them.|$|R

5|$|In his {{documentary}} The Pervert's Guide to Cinema, Slavoj Žižek {{remarks that}} Norman Bates' mansion has three floors, paralleling the three levels <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>mind</b> that are postulated by Freudian psychoanalysis: {{the top floor}} would be the superego, where Bates' mother lives; the ground floor is then Bates' ego, where he functions as an apparently normal human being; and finally, the basement would be Bates' id. Žižek interprets Bates' moving his mother's corpse from top floor to basement as a symbol for the deep connection that psychoanalysis posits between superego and id.|$|E
5|$|Priestley {{wrote his}} most {{important}} philosophical works during his years with Lord Shelburne. In a series of major metaphysical texts published between 1774 and 1780—An Examination of Dr. Reid's Inquiry into the Human Mind (1774), Hartley's Theory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Human</b> <b>Mind</b> on the Principle of the Association of Ideas (1775), Disquisitions relating to Matter and Spirit (1777), The Doctrine of Philosophical Necessity Illustrated (1777), and Letters to a Philosophical Unbeliever (1780)—he argues for a philosophy that incorporates four concepts: determinism, materialism, causation, and necessitarianism. By studying the natural world, he argued, people would learn how to become more compassionate, happy, and prosperous.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of his}} {{endeavour}} {{to expose}} the public to more foreign-language works, Johnson facilitated the translation of educational texts, serious fiction, and philosophy (he was less interested in translating popular novels). In particular, he promoted the translation {{of the works of}} persecuted French Girondins, such as Condorcet's Outlines of an Historical View of the Progress <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Human</b> <b>Mind</b> (1795) and Madame Roland's An Appeal to Impartial Posterity (1795), which he had released in English within weeks of its debut in France. His publication of a translation of Constanin Volney's deistic Les Ruines, ou méditations sur les révolutions des empires (1791) quickly became a bestseller. Johnson also had some of the most prominent French children's literature translated, such as the works of Madame de Genlis.|$|E

Breton's return to France after the War, began a new phase of Surrealist activity in Paris, and his critiques of rationalism and dualism found a new audience.

5|$|In modern times, the {{two main}} schools that have {{developed}} in response or opposition to this Hegelian tradition are phenomenology and existentialism. Phenomenology, founded by Edmund Husserl, focuses on the contents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>mind</b> (see noema) and how processes shape our experiences. Existentialism, a school of thought founded upon the work of Søren Kierkegaard, focuses on Human predicament and how people {{deal with the situation}} of being alive. Existential-phenomenology represents a major branch of continental philosophy (they are not contradictory), rooted in the work of Husserl but expressed in its fullest forms in the work of Martin Heidegger, Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir and Maurice Merleau-Ponty. See Heidegger's Being and Time, Merleau-Ponty's Phenomenology of Perception, Sartre's Being and Nothingness, and Simone de Beauvoir's The Second Sex.|$|E
5|$|Heathens {{commonly}} adopt a cosmology {{based on}} that found in Norse mythology. As part of this framework, humanity's world—known as Midgard—is regarded as just one of nine realms, {{all of which are}} part of a cosmological world tree called Yggdrasil. Different types of being are believed to inhabit these different realms; for instance, humans live on Midgard, while dwarves live on another realm, elves on another, giants on another, and the divinities on two further realms. Most practitioners believe that this is a poetic or symbolic description of the cosmos, with the different levels representing higher realms beyond the material plane of existence. The world tree is also interpreted by some in the community as an icon for ecological and social engagement. Some Heathens, such as the psychologist Brian Bates, have adopted an approach to this cosmology rooted in analytical psychology, thereby interpreting the nine worlds and their inhabitants as maps <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>mind.</b>|$|E
5|$|Many {{critics have}} {{challenged}} the second premise of this argument, {{by offering a}} biological and sociological account {{of the development of}} human morality which suggests that it is neither objective nor absolute. This account, supported by biologist E. O. Wilson and philosopher Michael Ruse, proposes that the human experience of morality is a by-product of natural selection, a theory philosopher Mark D. Linville calls evolutionary naturalism. According to the theory, the human experience of moral obligations was the result of evolutionary pressures, which attached a sense of morality to human psychology because it was useful for moral development; this entails that moral values do not exist independently <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>mind.</b> Morality might be better understood as an evolutionary imperative in order to propagate genes and ultimately reproduce. No human society today advocates immorality, such as theft or murder, because it would undoubtedly lead to the end of that particular society and any chance for future survival of offspring. Scottish empiricist David Hume made a similar argument, that belief in objective moral truths is unwarranted and to discuss them is meaningless.|$|E

50|$|Marketing {{consists}} <b>of</b> intriguing <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>mind</b> {{to think}} in a direction where {{it would not have}} done so previously - or not without outside input. Human curiosity, self gain or mental adjustment is what drives marketing development itself.|$|R

5|$|Some {{proponents of}} Saussure's view of {{language}} have advocated a formal approach which studies language structure by identifying its basic elements {{and then by}} presenting a formal account of the rules according to which the elements combine in order to form words and sentences. The main proponent of such a theory is Noam Chomsky, the originator of the generative theory of grammar, who has defined language as the construction of sentences that can be generated using transformational grammars. Chomsky considers these rules to be an innate feature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>mind</b> and to constitute the rudiments of what language is. By way of contrast, such transformational grammars are also commonly used to provide formal definitions of language are commonly used in formal logic, in formal theories of grammar, and in applied computational linguistics. In the philosophy of language, the view of linguistic meaning as residing in the logical relations between propositions and reality was developed by philosophers such as Alfred Tarski, Bertrand Russell, and other formal logicians.|$|E
5|$|Therefore, {{the debate}} that {{immediately}} followed the publication of On the Origin of Species centered on {{the similarities and differences}} between humans and modern apes. Carolus Linnaeus had been criticised in the 18th century for grouping humans and apes together as primates in his ground breaking classification system. Richard Owen vigorously defended the classification suggested by Georges Cuvier and Johann Friedrich Blumenbach that placed humans in a separate order from any of the other mammals, which by the early 19th century had become the orthodox view. On the other hand, Thomas Henry Huxley sought to demonstrate a close anatomical relationship between humans and apes. In one famous incident, which became known as the Great Hippocampus Question, Huxley showed that Owen was mistaken in claiming that the brains of gorillas lacked a structure present in human brains. Huxley summarized his argument in his highly influential 1863 book Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature. Another viewpoint was advocated by Lyell and Alfred Russel Wallace. They agreed that humans shared a common ancestor with apes, but questioned whether any purely materialistic mechanism could account for all the differences between humans and apes, especially some aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>mind.</b>|$|E

25|$|Mathematical realism, like realism in general, {{holds that}} {{mathematical}} entities exist independently <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>mind.</b> Thus humans do not invent mathematics, but rather discover it, {{and any other}} intelligent beings in the universe would presumably do the same.

40|$|The {{extended}} mind thesis {{proposes that}} humans are ca-pable of advanced cognition, not mainly through radi-cal structural changes in the brain, but through their ability to delegate cognitive tasks to the external world. It views material culture as an important causal factor in human cognitive evolution. Here, we explore this hy-pothesis through an analysis of Upper Palaeolithic forms of material culture which have been interpreted as ar-tificial memory systems. We argue that material calen-drical systems complement evolved internal time repre-sentations, because they enable humans to project past events into the future more accurately than is possible with episodic memory alone, which greatly improves for-aging strategies. Thus, the earliest calendars {{can be seen as}} a material extension <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>mind’s</b> evolved cognitive abilities...|$|R
5000|$|How the Mind Works is a 1997 book by Canadian-American {{cognitive}} scientist Steven Pinker.

Drawing heavily on <b>the</b> paradigm <b>of</b> evolutionary psychology articulated by John Tooby and Leda Cosmides, Pinker covers subjects {{as diverse as}} vision, emotion, feminism, and, in the final chapter, [...] "the meaning of life". He argues for both a computational theory of mind and a neo-Darwinist / adaptationist approach to evolution, all of which he sees as <b>the</b> central components <b>of</b> evolutionary psychology. He criticizes difference feminism in his book because he believes scientific {{research has shown that}} women and men differ little or not at all in their moral reasoning.
