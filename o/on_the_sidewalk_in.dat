25|$|Bates also {{sponsored}} and {{campaigned for}} {{the passage of}} Measure S in 2012, a sit-and-lie ordinance which would have made sitting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>in</b> certain commercial districts illegal and subject to citation and/or arrest depending on number of repeated violations. Bates and Measure S supporters unsuccessfully argued that threatening legal sanction would encourage persistently homeless individuals to access social services.|$|E
25|$|On May 14, 2008 Markham-Cousins {{sent letters}} to {{students}} and family members explaining {{the reasons for the}} Fresh Start. She cited graduation rates and college preparation as two reasons why the program had to go forward. The same day, students staged a walk-out in protest of the program. Student drew with chalk <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>in</b> front of the school in support of the teachers.|$|E
50|$|Some laws {{prohibit}} bicycle {{riding in}} commercial areas, such as <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks</b> <b>in</b> front of stores. In other places a sign erected {{by a government}} must be followed, such as with no-riding zones in a college campus.|$|R
50|$|There {{are also}} several pedestrian-only trails that travel between various parks and roadways. Hiking along these trails, {{as well as}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks</b> <b>in</b> Signal Hill is very popular. Some {{sections}} can be found that are between a 15% and 25% grade.|$|R

25|$|Half of Flint's {{fourteen}} tallest {{buildings were}} built during the 1920s. The 19-story Genesee Towers, formerly the city's tallest building, {{was completed in}} 1968. The building became unused in later years and fell into severe disrepair: a cautionary sign warning of falling debris was put <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>in</b> front of it. An investment company purchased the building for $1, and it was demolished (by implosion) on December 22, 2013.|$|E
25|$|The narrow axis of {{the plan}} faces {{the street to the}} east, and the main {{entrance}} lies midway along the long side of the plan. The use of hip roofs includes a very large cantilevered hip roof over the living room terrace. The pitch of the main hip roof is shallow enough to give the passer-by <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>in</b> front of the house the impression that it is a flat roof.|$|E
25|$|On March 6, 1978, {{during a}} legal battle related to {{obscenity}} in Gwinnett County, Georgia, Flynt and his local lawyer, Gene Reeves Jr., were returning to the courthouse when they were shot <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>in</b> front of 136 South Perry Street in Lawrenceville by a sniper standing near an alley across the street. The shooting left Flynt partially paralyzed with permanent spinal cord damage, {{and in need of}} a wheelchair. Flynt's injuries caused him constant, excruciating pain and he was addicted to painkillers until multiple surgeries deadened the affected nerves. He also suffered a stroke caused by one of several overdoses of his analgesic medications. He recovered but has had pronunciation difficulties since.|$|E
50|$|The {{pedestrian}} scramble {{may be used}} {{where large}} numbers of pedestrians are expected, and they will also have enough space to gather <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks</b> <b>in</b> larger numbers. Under certain circumstances, pedestrian scrambles could reduce safety, as the average waiting times for pedestrians and car drivers are increased, thus creating more likelihood of people disobeying the signals.|$|R

Blocks of this type are in- stalled at nearly every parking lot entrance, making for a great many installations. Warning blocks are also in- stalled before some crosswalks in the Jalan Thamrin area. No blocks are installed outside this area, however. Blocks are yellow in color.|$|R

500|$|In July 1937, the Williams and McNeil {{families}} {{opened a}} boarding house on South Perry Street in downtown Montgomery. It {{was at this}} time that Williams decided to change his name informally from Hiram to Hank, a name he said was better suited to his desired career in country music. During the same year he participated in a talent show at the Empire Theater. He won the first prize of $15, singing his first original song [...] "WPA Blues". Williams wrote the lyrics and used the tune of Riley Puckett's [...] "Dissatisfied." [...] He never learned to read music and, {{for the rest of his}} career, based his compositions in storytelling. After school and on weekends Williams sang and played his Silvertone guitar <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>in</b> front of the WSFA radio studios. His recent win at the Empire Theater and the street performances caught the attention of WSFA producers who occasionally invited him to perform on air. So many listeners contacted the radio station asking for more of [...] "the singing kid" [...] that the producers hired him to host his own 15-minute show twice a week for a weekly salary of US$15 (equivalent to US$0 in [...] ).|$|E
2500|$|From {{even its}} early days, {{students}} were {{no stranger to}} protest. [...] In May 1913, in retaliation for what students claimed were [...] "harsh methods", an effigy of the principal, J.E. Witmer, was hung from the telegraph wires {{in front of the}} school. [...] After the principal removed the effigy in the early evening, another was hung from the flagpole on top of the school. [...] When signs were found painted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>in</b> front of the school the next day, the local marshal took every male in the senior class into custody, ordering them to remove the signs under threat of arrest. [...] The next year, 110 students walked out on strike when the principal refused to grant a holiday for Columbus Day.|$|E

25|$|The {{divide between}} rich and poor can be seen in areas such as Atenas Street. Here, next to the Palacio de Covian, the site of the Secretary of the Government, there is a {{building}} damaged by the 1985 earthquake in which nine families live illegally. These families do not pay rent and the owner wants to evict them. These families earn money by selling crafts <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> colonia or by washing clothes. There are families that live <b>on</b> <b>the</b> streets here who survive on 20 pesos a day.|$|R
2500|$|It took an {{interval}} of eleven years, but ultimately Krugman's work on New Trade Theory (NTT) converged {{to what is}} usually called the [...] "new economic geography" [...] (NEG), which Krugman began to develop in a seminal 1991 paper, [...] "Increasing Returns and Economic Geography", published in the Journal of Political Economy. In Krugman's own words, the passage from NTT to NEG was [...] "obvious in retrospect; but it certainly {{took me a while}} to see it. ... The only good news was that nobody else picked up that $100 bill lying <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>in</b> the interim." [...] This would become Krugman's most-cited academic paper: by early 2009, it had 857 citations, more than double his second-ranked paper. Krugman called the paper [...] "the love of my life in academic work." ...|$|E

25|$|The Aladdin was {{scheduled}} to reopen on August 17, 2000, at 6:00p.m., with fireworks at 10:00p.m. The opening was delayed while the Clark County building inspector completed its fire safety testing. Another delay was caused by last-minute repairs to the casino surveillance system. This left thousands of Aladdin visitors leaving in disappointment, as well as opening night hotel guests wondering where they'd spend the night. Many high-rollers waited out <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks</b> <b>in</b> front of <b>the</b> Aladdin for hours. Most were unable to even get to their luggage, since the hotel had been locked down for testing. Aladdin employees tried to arrange alternate accommodations for the guests with Paris and Bellagio.|$|R

60|$|He was {{too excited}} to notice {{carefully}} {{where he was}} running, and the next instant he, followed by Glutts, brought up against a stand <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>in</b> front of a small shop. This stand was filled with various articles of bric-a-brac, and it went down with a crash, carrying dozens of small articles with it.|$|E
60|$|Then {{came the}} good-bys--the real ones. Uncle Tom, always the friend of young people, was {{surrounded}} by a group of bridesmaids in the hall. She clung to him. And Peter, who had the carriage ready. What would her wedding have been without Peter? As they drove towards the station, his was the image that remained persistently in her mind, bareheaded <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>in</b> the light of the carriage lamps. The image of struggle.|$|E

As a serf looking after paper-knives and other properties, he had been--for him--almost slim.
