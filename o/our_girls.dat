500|$|After {{the repeal}} of Don't Ask Don't Tell on September 20, 2011, Obama {{included}} openly gay service members in her national military families initiative. On May 9, 2012, Barack and Michelle Obama came out publicly in favor of same-sex marriage. Prior to this, Michelle Obama had never stated her position on same-sex marriage publicly. Senior White House officials said that Michelle Obama and Senior Adviser Valerie Jarrett had been the two most consistent advocates for same-sex marriage in Barack Obama's life. Michelle {{went on to say}} that [...] "This is an important issue for millions of Americans, and for Barack and me, it really comes down to the values of fairness and equality we want to pass down to <b>our</b> <b>girls.</b> These are basic values that kids learn at a very young age and that we encourage them to apply in all areas of their lives. And in a country where we teach our children that everyone is equal under the law, discriminating against same-sex couples just isn't right. It's as simple as that." [...] At the 2012 DNC Michelle said, [...] "Barack knows the American Dream because he's lived it... and he wants everyone in this country to have that same opportunity, no matter who we are, or where we're from, or what we look like, or who we love." ...|$|E
500|$|Partnerships in Mathematics and Science (PIMS) {{began in}} Eva Evans's {{administration}} in 1994, {{and was a}} part of the SPIRIT program during the Linda White administration. Eva Evans mentioned the need for a math and science program, [...] "As a college sorority, we've always advanced an educational agenda. We always had high GPA requirements. [...] And more than ever, we're pushing the importance of math and science for <b>our</b> <b>girls.</b> [...] We need more black women in those fields." [...] The program's purpose is to increase the successes of youth in mathematics and science, as well as technology. Campaigns to highlight the program's importance were sponsored by the National Science Foundation and historically black colleges from across the country. Several chapters provided two-week math and science summer camps on college and day school campuses, which consisted of hands-on-learning through laboratory interactions, field trips to important sites, youth camps, and speeches from influential experts in specific areas of studies. For example, a PIMS program at Park Street Elementary School in Marietta, Georgia, consisted of third through fifth grade girls and provided educational field trips in order to stimulate involvement in math and science. Also, a national P.I.M.S. Olympiad, deriving from knowledge of math and science, in conjunction with the PIMS Community Parade was held at the 58th Boulé in Dallas, Texas.|$|E

2500|$|The final rites, {{in case of}} {{untimely}} death of a child, is usually not cremation but a burial.

2500|$|Aversion to sex was {{not part}} of the kibbutz ideology; to this end, {{teenagers}} were not segregated at night in children's societies, yet many visitors to kibbutzim were astonished at how conservative the communities tended to be. In Children of the Dream, Bruno Bettelheim quoted a kibbutz friend, [...] "at a time when the American girls preen themselves, and try to show off as much as possible sexually, <b>our</b> <b>girls</b> cover themselves up and refuse to wear clothing that might show their breasts or in any other fashion be revealing." ...|$|E

An eyewitness testified, [...] "It was a very common thing for them to rape <b>our</b> <b>girls</b> in our presence. Very often they violated eight or ten year old girls, {{and as a consequence}} many would be unable to walk, and were shot."
