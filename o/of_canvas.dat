5|$|He uses {{overlapping}} forms {{rather than}} a single form or distinct adjacent forms, which seems {{to create a more}} dynamic feel to the shallow space. However, since Lichtenstein does not uses shading or contrast, the monochromatic strokes with just bold black outlines are void of certain elements of depth. Big Painting No. 6 and Yellow and Green Brushstrokes go one step further in terms <b>of</b> <b>canvas</b> size and dynamic activity that was presented earlier in Little Big Painting.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Manchester Art Gallery staff {{determined}} that if conservation work were not undertaken, the painting {{would soon be}} beyond repair. The Esmée Fairbairn Foundation and AXA Art Insurance provided funding for the restoration. A replacement canvas to which the painting had been attached in the 1930s was removed. Following this, a mixture of isinglass adhesive and chalk was used to restore {{the surface of the}} painting, and the paint added during the earlier attempted restoration was removed. A new double layer <b>of</b> <b>canvas</b> was added {{to the back of the}} painting, and the three layers were glued together.|$|E

This consisted of twenty foot high clothes line-type poles that were 100 feet apart and further protected by wind-break fences <b>of</b> <b>canvas.</b> Between the poles were strung wires for laying the wet varnished fabric onto for drying. After drying the fabric was then rewound onto rollers and varnished {{over and over again}} several more times to each side and thoroughly dried each time. Each application of new varnish added a thin layer.|$|E

5|$|Archaeological finds {{from the}} Carpathian Basin provide {{evidence}} of the crafts practiced by the Magyars. 10th-century warriors' graves yielding sabres, arrow-heads, spear-heads, stirrups, and snaffle bits made of iron show that blacksmiths had a pre-eminent role in the militarized Magyar society. Engraved or gilded sabres and sabretache platesoften decorated with precious stonesand golden or silver pectoral disks evidence {{the high levels of}} skills of Magyar gold- and silversmiths. Cemeteries in the Carpathian Basin also yielded scraps <b>of</b> <b>canvas</b> made of flax or hemp. The positioning of metal buttons in the graves shows the Magyars wore clothes that either opened down the front or were fastened at the neck. Ear-rings were the only accessories worn above the belt by Magyar warriors; jewelry on their upper bodies would have hindered them from firing arrows. In contrast, Magyar women wore head jewelry decorated with leaf-like pendants, ear-rings, decorated pectoral disks, and rings with gemstones.|$|E
5|$|After Cage {{finished}} {{teaching at}} the New School {{in the summer of}} 1960, Ono was determined to rent a place to present her works along with the work of other avant-garde artists in the city. She eventually found a cheap loft in downtown Manhattan at 112 Chambers Street that she used as a studio and living space. Supporting herself through secretarial work and lessons in the traditional Japanese arts at the Japan Society, Ono allowed composer La Monte Young to organize concerts in the loft. Both began organizing a series of events there from December 1960 through June 1961, with people such as Marcel Duchamp and Peggy Guggenheim attending, and both Ono and Young claimed to have been the primary curator of these events, with Ono claiming to have been eventually pushed into a subsidiary role by Young. The Chambers Street series hosted some of Ono's earliest conceptual artwork, including Painting to Be Stepped On, which was a scrap <b>of</b> <b>canvas</b> on the floor that became a completed artwork upon the accrual of footprints. With that work, Ono suggested that a work of art no longer needed to be mounted on a wall and inaccessible. She showed this work and other instructional work again at Macunias's AG Gallery in July 1961.|$|E

5000|$|The {{early hours}} <b>of</b> the <b>canvas</b> were {{characterized}} by random pixel placement and chaotic attempts at image creation. Among the first distinct sections <b>of</b> the <b>canvas</b> to emerge were a corner of entirely blue pixels (named [...] "Blue Corner") and a homage to Pokemon. As the canvas developed, some established subreddit communities, such as those for video games, sports teams and individual countries, coordinated user efforts to claim and decorate particular sections. Other sections <b>of</b> the <b>canvas</b> were developed by specially created communities and coordination efforts, such as a reproduction of the Mona Lisa and The Starry Night.|$|R

25|$|Unlike Picasso and Braque, {{the work}} of Gleizes always {{involved}} the synthetic treatment of broad subjects, each section <b>of</b> <b>canvas</b> receiving equal attention.

The intensely self-critical Lee Krasner also frequently destroyed her own paintings by cutting them into pieces, only to create new works of art by reassembling the pieces into collages.|$|E

25|$|When I {{first started}} doing the stain paintings, I left large areas <b>of</b> <b>canvas</b> unpainted, I think, because the canvas itself acted as forcefully and as {{positively}} as paint or line or color. In other words, the very ground {{was part of}} the medium, so that instead of thinking of it as background or negative space or an empty spot, that area did not need paint because it had paint next to it. The thing was to decide where to leave it and where to fill it and where to say this doesn't need another line or another pail of colors. It's saying it in space.|$|E
25|$|The first SCG {{scoreboard}} {{was built}} in the two weeks leading up to the 1895–1896 inter-colonial match between New South Wales and Victoria. Although it was Sheridan's idea, the design was Ned Gregory's who believed that English scoreboards were inadequate. Requiring two men to operate it, the new scoreboard was hailed as one of the wonders of the cricket world. Boards with players' names on them were placed in different slits alongside scrolls <b>of</b> <b>canvas</b> with numbers painted on them which were rolled up and down to show the changing score. Under the scoreboard was a refreshment stall which sold, among other things, oysters.|$|E
25|$|Both {{repetitions of}} the 4th version {{are no longer}} in their {{original}} state. In the Amsterdam version a strip of wood was added at the top—probably by van Gogh himself. The Tokyo version, however, was enlarged on all sides with strips <b>of</b> <b>canvas,</b> which were added at a later time—presumably by the first owner, Émile Schuffenecker. The series is perhaps van Gogh's best known and most widely reproduced. In the 2000s debate arose regarding the authenticity of one of the paintings, and {{it has been suggested that}} this version may have been the work of Émile Schuffenecker or of Paul Gauguin. Most experts, however, conclude that the work is genuine.|$|E

25|$|The {{widespread}} {{adoption of}} steampowered {{vessels in the}} world's merchant marine services {{in the late nineteenth}} and early twentieth centuries radically altered the economics of seafaring. Without acres <b>of</b> <b>canvas</b> to be furled and unfurled, the demand for unskilled labor (and, by extension, crimping) greatly diminished. The sinking of the RMS Titanic, followed by onset of World War I (which made the high seas a much more dangerous place due to the threat of submarine attack) provided the final impetus to stamp out the practice. In 1915, Andrew Furuseth and Senator Robert M. La Follette Sr. pushed through the Seamen's Act of 1915 that made crimping a federal crime, and finally put an end to it.|$|E
25|$|Technically 7,62 ItKk/31 VKT is a Maxim {{machine gun}} {{that has been}} {{modified}} for {{a higher rate of}} fire with an accelerator and the use of 250-round disintegrating metallic belts (instead <b>of</b> <b>canvas</b> belts).

The weapon is also air-cooled instead of water-cooled, and has a barrel jacket closely resembling the one in Lahti-Saloranta M/26 light machine gun. At barrel ends are conical flash suppressors. In the twin anti-aircraft machine gun configuration two guns are connected side by side with belt boxes {{on both sides of the}} pair and square boxes under both guns for empty shells and belt links. Both guns have cocking handles on the right side and recoil springs on the left; the left hand gun has a modified feed system to allow the belt run from left.|$|E
