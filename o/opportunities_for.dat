40|$|This {{research}} used a trait-based impression formation task {{to explore}} the effect of instructional set and <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> thought on inconsistency discounting. It was predicted that attitude polarization would be attenuated, regardless of <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> thought, when discounting incongruent information was difficult. When discounting incongruent information was easy, attitude polarization was expected to increase as <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> thought increased. The relationship between discounting and <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> thought {{was expected to be}} accentuated when individuals are low in tolerance for ambiguity.

40|$|A trait-based {{impression}} formation {{task was}} used to investigate whether inconsistency discounting {{is one of the}} cognitive processes that produce self-generated attitude polarization. Three predictions were made. First, attitude polarization would increase as <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> thought increased. Second, inconsistency discounting would also increase as <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> thought increased. Third, the relationship between discounting and <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> thought would differ with individual differences in need for closure, need for structure, and intolerance of ambiguity. The results did not support the predictions. In contrast with the findings of previous self-generated attitude change investigations, differential <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> thought did not affect attitude change.

5|$|In the 2002 Nunavut Tourism {{publication}} The Time is Right: A Vision and Strategy for Tourism Development in Nunavut, {{a number}} of issues facing Nunavut tourism operators were highlighted. One major issue for the Nunavut tourism industry is the territory's remote nature. This imposes high travel costs on visitors to Nunavut, and drives tourism numbers down. In addition, Nunavut's position north of the Arctic Circle reduces the opportunity for spring activities, and results in a highly seasonally based tourism market. This limits <b>opportunities</b> <b>for</b> year-round employment in the territory. Many tourism organisations and operators faced difficulty attracting high-quality staff members to their ranks, and experienced high levels of turnover. There are limited links between tourism operators, inhibiting <b>opportunities</b> <b>for</b> inter-sector growth.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to measure the effects of task difficulty and reward opportunity on motivation. The participants, 20 undergraduate students, were {{randomly assigned to one of}} four experimental conditions: reward opportunity-hard proofreading task, reward opportunity-easy proofreading task, no reward opportunity-hard proofreading task, or no reward opportunity-easy proofreading task. It was hypothesized that the participants offered an <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> reward would perform better than those not offered an <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> reward by indicating and correcting more spelling and grammatical errors. Also, it was hypothesized that participants offered an <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> reward would return the completed proofreading task quicker than participants not offered an <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> reward. Two, 2 x 2 ANOVAs were carried out with the results showing no main effects of task difficulty or <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> reward on number of errors corrected or time of return (in days), indicating no change in motivation. As the original hypothesis was not supported, issues with the study and areas for further research were discussed...|$|R

5|$|The {{issue of}} male over-representation {{in terms of}} total number of sports and athletes is structural.

The importance of being part of the Summer Olympics is illustrated by softball, and the benefits the sport derived from its inclusion.

40|$|Recent {{debate has}} {{highlighted}} {{the importance of}} estimating both the strength of sexual selection on phenotypic traits, and the <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> sexual selection. We describe seasonal fluctuations in mating dynamics of Leptinotarsa undecimlineata (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae). We compared several estimates of the <b>opportunity</b> <b>for,</b> and the strength of, sexual selection and male precopulatory competition over the reproductive season. First, using a null model, we suggest that the ratio between observed values of the <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> sexual selections and their expected value under random mating results in unbiased estimates of the actual nonrandom mating behavior of the population. Second, we found that estimates for the whole reproductive season often misrepresent the actual value {{at any given time}} period. Third, mating differentials on male size and mobility, frequency of male fighting and three estimates of the <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> sexual selection provide contrasting but complementary information. More intense sexual selection associated to male mobility, but not to male size, was observed in periods with high <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> sexual selection and high frequency of male fights. Fourth, based on parameters of spatial and temporal aggregation of female receptivity, we describe the mating system of L. undecimlineata as a scramble mating polygyny in which the <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> sexual selection varies widely throughout the season, but the strength of sexual selection on male size remains fairly weak, while male mobility inversely covaries with mating success. We suggest that different estimates <b>for</b> the <b>opportunity</b> <b>for,</b> and intensity of, sexual selection should be applied in order t...|$|R
