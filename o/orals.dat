We propose a conceptual model which postulates that socioeconomic status, <b>oral</b> health behavior and <b>oral</b> health status each influence <b>oral</b> quality of life. Using data from the New Zealand National <b>Oral</b> Health Survey, we describe and analyze <b>oral</b> health status and <b>oral</b> quality of life among children aged 12 - 13 and adults aged 35 - 44 and 65 - 74. The study demonstrates the impact of <b>oral</b> health problems on the <b>oral</b> {{quality of life of}} children, middle-aged adults and older adults in New Zealand. The majority have experienced at least one dental symptom in the past year. Some of them perceive poor <b>oral</b> health and also dislike the way their teeth/dentures look. Various aspects of their social and physical functioning are adversely affected by <b>oral</b> health problems. The results of multiple regression analyses of <b>oral</b> quality of life demonstrate that perceived general health is a consistent predictor of quality of life. Furthermore, the adults' <b>oral</b> quality of life is positively related to asymptomatic dental visits and negatively related to symptomatic dental visits. Children's <b>oral</b> quality of life is positively related to more frequent brushing and flossing. <b>Oral</b> health status is closely associated with <b>oral</b> quality of life for both adults and children.

40|$|Introduction: Ignorance {{regarding}} <b>oral</b> {{diseases and}} <b>oral</b> health {{can be a}} major cause for a high prevalence of <b>oral</b> diseases. Parents′ attitudes have a significant positive influence on the children′s <b>oral</b> hygiene and <b>oral</b> health. Objectives: To assess the mothers′ <b>oral</b> hygiene knowledge and practice {{and its impact on}} <b>oral</b> hygiene status of their 12 -year-old children. Materials and Methods: A total of 900 children, 12 years old and their mothers were selected by random sampling from 10 administrative wards of Mathura city. The general information and data regarding mothers′ <b>oral</b> hygiene knowledge and practice were obtained by personal interview using a pretested questionnaire. Clinical examination of the subjects was done using <b>oral</b> hygiene index-simplified (OHI-S) for both children and mothers. The data obtained were analyzed using SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences), version 11. 5 for windows. One-way ANOVA and independent t-test were used to find out the impact of mothers′ <b>oral</b> hygiene knowledge and practice on <b>oral</b> hygiene status of their 12 -year-old children. Results: Mothers′ <b>oral</b> hygiene knowledge was found to {{have a significant impact on}} <b>oral</b> hygiene status of their 12 -year-old children. There was a significant difference in mean OHI-S score of children with mothers who had poor <b>oral</b> hygiene knowledge (1. 1650), fair <b>oral</b> hygiene knowledge (0. 8947) and good <b>oral</b> hygiene knowledge (0. 6431). Mothers′ <b>oral</b> hygiene practices also had a significant impact on the <b>oral</b> hygiene status of their 12 -year-old children.

40|$|<b>Oral</b> sex is {{commonly}} practiced by sexually active male-female and same-gender couples of various ages, including adolescents. The various type of <b>oral</b> sex practices are fellatio, cunnilingus and analingus. <b>Oral</b> sex is infrequently examined {{in research on}} adolescents; <b>oral</b> sex can transmit <b>oral,</b> respiratory, and genital pathogens. <b>Oral</b> health has {{a direct impact on}} the transmission of infection; a cut in your mouth, bleeding gums, lip sores or broken skin increases chances of infection. Although <b>oral</b> sex is considered a low risk activity, it is important to use protection and safer sex precautions. There are various methods of preventing infection during <b>oral</b> sex such as physical barriers, health and medical issues, ethical issues and <b>oral</b> hygiene and dental issues.

The study is an integral part of creating a comprehensive <b>oral</b> care policy and guide for purchasing hospital-wide <b>oral</b> care products.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Oral</b> {{cancer is}} as {{prevalent}} as cervical and testicular {{cancer in the}} United Kingdom. Nursing staff provide the <b>oral</b> {{health care for the}} patient population in hospital. Admission to hospital provides a 'window of opportunity' for <b>oral</b> cancer 'screening' via an <b>oral</b> health check during nursing clerking. This study aimed to investigate whether nursing staff are aware of risk factors for <b>oral</b> cancer, its clinical signs, and could therefore provide a 'screening' service for <b>oral</b> cancer. Method Through the use of a questionnaire we assessed 121 nursing staff on <b>oral</b> health check behaviour and attitudes; their knowledge of risk factors for <b>oral</b> cancer; their understanding of common clinical signs of <b>oral</b> cancer; and their undergraduate and postgraduate training in <b>oral</b> health and <b>oral</b> cancer. Results Over 80 % thought <b>oral</b> health checks were important although only 49 % performed this task regularly; approximately 70 % identified smoking as a risk factor but less than 30 % identified alcohol. Awareness of the clinical signs of <b>oral</b> cancer was low with 21 % identifying white patches, 15 % identifying ulceration and only 2 % identifying red patches despite their malignant potential. Nurses within 3 years of qualification were significantly better at recognising risk factors for <b>oral</b> cancer than their colleagues, identifying a need for continuing postgraduate education on <b>oral</b> health and <b>oral</b> cancer. Sixty-one percent of nursing staff received <b>oral</b> healthcare as an undergraduate with 34 percent receiving postgraduate training. Conclusion An <b>oral</b> health check upon admission to hospital provides an opportunity for nurses to 'screen' for <b>oral</b> diseases including <b>oral</b> cancer and allows nurses a greater role in total patient care. Nurses' awareness of <b>oral</b> cancer risk factors and clinical signs was, however, poor. This study highlights a need for improved education of nurses on <b>oral</b> cancer to make the <b>oral</b> health check on admission viable for <b>oral</b> cancer screening. </p...|$|R

40|$|Objectives. Even though {{objective}} data {{indicating the}} absence of <b>oral</b> malodor are presented to patients, they may be skeptical about the results, possibly due {{to the presence of}} some discomfort in the <b>oral</b> cavity. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate whether there is an association among self-perceptions of <b>oral</b> malodor, <b>oral</b> complaints, and the actual <b>oral</b> malodor test result. Materials and Methods. Questions concerning self-perceptions of <b>oral</b> malodor and subjective intraoral symptoms were extracted from a questionnaire on <b>oral</b> malodor completed by 363 subjects who visited the clinic for <b>oral</b> malodor of Tokyo Dental College Chiba Hospital and gave consent to this study. In addition, the association of self-perception of <b>oral</b> malodor with values obtained after organoleptic and OralChroma measurement was analyzed. Results. No correlation between 195 subjects (54 %) who were judged “with <b>oral</b> malodor” (organoleptic score of ≥ 1) and 294 subjects (81. 6 %) who had a self-perceptions of <b>oral</b> malodor was observed. Self-perception of <b>oral</b> malodor was significantly correlated with tongue coating p= 0. 002 and a strange intraoral taste p= 0. 016. Conclusions.

40|$|Aim: <b>Oral</b> {{lichen planus}} and <b>oral</b> lichenoid {{reaction}} are familiar keratotic lesions {{found on the}} <b>oral</b> mucosa.

The {{aim of this study}} was to identify as well as examine the frequency of colloid bodies in <b>oral</b> lichen planus and <b>oral</b> lichenoid reaction by histochemical means. Method: The material for the study included 12 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks (7 <b>oral</b> lichen planus and 5 <b>oral</b> lichenoid reaction), retrieved from the Department of <b>Oral</b> Pathology and Microbiology, MCODS, Manipal. Sections stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) with diastase to identify, locate and examine the frequency of colloid bodies in <b>oral</b> lichen planus and <b>oral</b> lichenoid reaction. Results: It was observed that the colloid bodies in case of <b>oral</b> lichen planus were present in either epithelium or connective tissue but usually close to the epithelium-connective tissue junction. While in <b>oral</b> lichenoid reaction colloid bodies were mostly seen in lower spinous layer of epithelium. Conclusion: Colloid bodies can be used as one of the criteria to differentiate <b>oral</b> lichen planus from <b>oral</b> lichenoid reaction.
