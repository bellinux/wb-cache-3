25|$|Dilution {{of indoor}} {{pollutants}} with outdoor air is effective {{to the extent}} that outdoor air is free of harmful pollutants. Ozone in outdoor air occurs indoors at reduced concentrations because ozone is highly reactive with many chemicals found indoors. The products of the reactions between ozone and many common indoor pollutants include organic compounds that may be more odorous, irritating, or toxic than those from which they are formed. These products of <b>ozone</b> <b>chemistry</b> include formaldehyde, higher molecular weight aldehydes, acidic aerosols, and fine and ultrafine particles, among others. The higher the outdoor ventilation rate, the higher the indoor ozone concentration and the more likely the reactions will occur, but even at low levels, the reactions will take place. This suggests that ozone should be removed from ventilation air, especially in areas where outdoor ozone levels are frequently high. Recent research has shown that mortality and morbidity increase in the general population during periods of higher outdoor ozone and that the threshold for this effect is around 20 parts per billion (ppb).|$|E

50|$|Nitrogen dioxide (NO2), {{nitrogen}} trioxide (NO3), and {{chlorine dioxide}} (OClO) play crucial roles in stratospheric chemistry and the catalytic cycles that destroy stratospheric ozone. SAGE III NO2 measurements {{are important because}} the processes {{that occur in the}} Antarctic winter and spring and give rise to the ozone hole effectively convert NO2 to nitric acid (HNO3). Thus NO2 is an important diagnostic of ozone hole chemistry. Since it is measured during both solar and lunar occultation events, SAGE III observations of NO2 will improve our understanding of the strong diurnal (daily) cycles in stratospheric processes. In addition, SAGE III will make virtually unique measurements of nitrogen trioxide (NO3). Although it is short-lived in the presence of sunlight, NO3 plays {{an active role in the}} chemistry of other reactive nitrogen species such as NO2 and di-nitrogen pentoxide (N2O5) and, thus, indirectly in <b>ozone</b> <b>chemistry.</b> Since few other measurements of NO3 are available, SAGE III measurements, which are made during lunar occultation (nighttime) events, will provide crucial validation for our current understanding of reactive nitrogen chemistry.|$|E

40|$|Reactive {{nitrogen}} (NOy) {{plays an}} important role in stratospheric <b>ozone</b> <b>chemistry.</b> Its constitutents NO and NO 2 both catalyze ozone detruction and limit other catalytic ozone depletion cycles as they transform the involved radicals into reservoir species, e. g. chlorine nitrate and nitric acid. While the partitioning within the NOy family may change rapidly, its chemical lifetime is long compared to the time scale of atmospheric transport processes. This also holds for nitrous oxide (N 2 O), whose photochemical destruciton in the middle stratosphere in the tropics is the principle source of NOy. Therefore, a compact anticorrelation is anticipated and frequently found for the two tracers. However, deviations from this corelation can occur due to processes that redistribute the abundance of reactive nitrogen within the stratosphere, e. g. by particle formation, sedimentation and reevaporation. As such processes alter the balance between ozone destructing radicals, they can have substantial in fluence on stratospheric <b>ozone</b> <b>chemistry...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{potential}} for reactions among indoor pollutants to generate reactive and highly irritating products {{is a reason}} to maintain adequate ventilation rates and clean ventilation filters. Terpenoid (from recirculated air, a scenario common in the tropics) captured by ventilation filters can react relatively quickly with ozone which may lead to downstream air supply that contain oxidized terpenoid {{and this may be}} perceived to be less acceptable than outdoor air. The chemical composition (water solubility and chemical reactivity) of these particles strongly governs their toxicity. The composition determines either how the respiratory tract reacts or how the body responds. There are few studies examining the impact of ventilation rate and ventilation filters on indoor chemistry. Studies documenting the effect of filters, ventilation and recirculation rate on <b>ozone</b> initiated <b>chemistry</b> in buildings utilizing recirculation of conditioned air are lacking.
