40|$|Loose sand, when sheared under {{undrained}} conditions, {{tends to}} collapse rapidly {{with a very}} low residual strength. The consequences of this flow type response can be disastrous in geotechnical applications. Natural sands encountered in situ usually contain some amount <b>of</b> <b>fines</b> and the effect <b>of</b> <b>fines</b> on the undrained behavior of sand is of great concern. Several experimental {{studies have shown that}} the addition <b>of</b> <b>fines</b> increases the resistance of sand to collapse, whereas several others show the contrary. The lack of convergence and consistency results in difficulty in quantifying the effect <b>of</b> <b>fines.</b> This paper reports new data and interpretations from an experimental program aimed at a fundamental understanding of the undrained behavior of sands with additions <b>of</b> <b>fines.</b> Results are discussed with particular attention on the role <b>of</b> <b>fines</b> in modifying the position of critical state line and the potential for collapse...|$|R
40|$|ASMGE v. 2 entitled: Proceedings of the 5 th International Young Geotechnical Engineers' ConferenceWhen clean sand {{is mixed}} with some amount <b>of</b> <b>fines,</b> its shear {{behavior}} can be altered significantly. Current views on the effect <b>of</b> <b>fines</b> are very diverse: several experimental studies showed that the addition <b>of</b> <b>fines</b> can reduce the collapsibility of sand under undrained conditions, whereas several others obtained an opposite conclusion. The diverse or even contradictory views in the literature indicate that the influence <b>of</b> <b>fines</b> remains an area of great difficulty. In this paper, the shear behavior of sand with the addition <b>of</b> <b>fines</b> is studied by using the 3 D discrete element method (DEM), with the aim to investigate the role <b>of</b> <b>fines</b> at the grain scale so as to develop a deeper understanding. Particular effort is made to examine {{the applicability of the}} equivalent inter-granular void ratio which has been increasingly used to describe the packing state in characterizing the shear behavior of silty sands...|$|R

40|$|An ideal backmixed reactor model (CSTR) and a {{fluidized}} bed bubbling reactor model (FBBR) were developed for silane pyrolysis. Silane decomposition {{is assumed to}} occur via two pathways: homogeneous decomposition and heterogeneous chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Both models account for homogeneous and heterogeneous silane decomposition, homogeneous nucleation, coagulation and growth by diffusion <b>of</b> <b>fines,</b> scavenging <b>of</b> <b>fines</b> by large particles, elutriation <b>of</b> <b>fines</b> and CVD growth of large seed particles. At present the models do not account for attrition. The preliminary comparison of the model predictions with experimental results shows reasonable agreement. The CSTR model with no adjustable parameter yields a lower bound on fines formed and upper estimate on production rates. The FBBR model overpredicts the formation <b>of</b> <b>fines</b> but could be matched to experimental data by adjusting the unkown jet emulsion exchange efficients.

40|$|Minor {{offences}} {{are often}} punished with a fine. Up to 2007 the number <b>of</b> <b>fines</b> in the Netherlands was increasing but 2008 saw a decline. At {{the same time}} fines were raised significantly. The {{question is whether the}} raise in fines caused the decline in the number <b>of</b> <b>fines.</b> To answer this question a database containing administrative fines for speeding on the motorway over the period 2007 – 2010 is analyzed. Two categories are compared: speeding offences detected by average speed measuring systems (ASMS) and speeding offences detected by police officers. For each category the elasticity <b>of</b> <b>fines</b> is estimated. It turns out that the elasticity <b>of</b> <b>fines</b> detected by an ASMS is small but differs significantly from both 0 and − 1. If fines are raised by 1 %, the offence rate, that is, proportion <b>of</b> <b>fines</b> detected by an ASMS, will decline by 0. 14 %. For fines handed out by police officers we see no such effect: the estimated elasticity of the number <b>of</b> <b>fines</b> is positive and does not significantly differ from zero. The conclusion is that motorists make moderate adjustments in their behavior when fines are raised but only if the risk of being caught is high...|$|R

40|$|Glass melting is {{significantly}} influenced by two processes: {{the dissolution of}} particles and the <b>fining</b> <b>of</b> glass. Because these processes are time- and energy-consuming in industry, fining agents are used. Although much literature has been reported about the use <b>of</b> <b>fining</b> agents, no extensive overview of such literature has yet been published. In this paper, we provide such a review, targeting articles that describe the influence <b>of</b> <b>fining</b> agents on (i) the dissolution of particles, (ii) the bubble nucleation and removal, (iii) colour of glass at reduced melting conditions, and (iv) the foaming of glass. We cover the history <b>of</b> <b>fining</b> agent usage from the earliest {{research in the field}} to the most recent cutting-edge discoveries. The advantages and disadvantages of all the traditional fining agents are described, with attention paid to the most widely used agent, sodium sulphate. In addition, sodium sulphate is considered as a surface-active compound and colouring substance. Furthermore, we include the influence of redox conditions on the process <b>of</b> <b>fining.</b> We believe that our review provides an ideal introduction to the use <b>of</b> <b>fining</b> agents, both for researchers and industry professionals...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine if increasing dietary lysine would improve body weight gain and feed efficiency (FE) of male broilers from 14 to 30 d when fed diets containing high proportion <b>of</b> feed <b>fines.</b> A 2 x 5 factorial treatment arrangement was achieved by feeding diets containing two concentrations of total lysine (1. 00 and 1. 15 % of the diet) with five levels <b>of</b> feed <b>fines</b> (20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 % of the diet). Feed fines represented a blend <b>of</b> <b>fines</b> created and scalped during manufacturing, and intact pellets ground with a hammermill. Subsequently, proportions <b>of</b> pellets and <b>fines</b> were blended to obtain desired levels <b>of</b> feed <b>fines.</b> Eight grower cages of 5 male broiler chicks were fed each dietary treatment from 14 to 30 d. Body weight gain was depressed for birds fed 1. 00 % lysine when the diet contained in excess <b>of</b> 20 % <b>fines.</b> Birds fed 1. 15 % lysine diets containing 20 % fines did not significantly differ in weight gain from birds fed the same lysine concentration regardless <b>of</b> <b>fines</b> level. At fines levels greater than 20 %, feeding 1. 15 % lysine resulted in a significant improvement (P= 0. 0324) in FE at each level <b>of</b> <b>fines.</b> Birds fed 1. 00 % lysine at the lowest level <b>of</b> <b>fines</b> displayed a significantly greater average feed intake (P= 0. 05) than any other treatment. Lack of a feed intake response at increasing levels <b>of</b> <b>fines</b> suggests that birds received a growth benefit independent of feed intake. Results demonstrated that increasing dietary lysine concentrations may compensate for inferior performance obtained with diets of poor pellet quality...|$|R
