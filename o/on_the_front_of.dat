5|$|In the United States {{green was}} {{connected}} with the dollar bill. Since 1861, the reverse side of the dollar bill has been green.

Also, since the banknotes were thin, the green on the back did not show through and muddle the pictures <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the banknote. Green continues to be used because the public now associates it with a strong and stable currency.|$|E
