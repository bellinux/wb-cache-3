40|$|My {{research}} {{project will be}} searching the possible segregation happens to Chinese students in campus. I will mainly focus <b>on</b> <b>How???s</b> Chinese students interracial friendship status, ???What cause the segregation and prevent friendship between Chinese students and other races students???? As I experienced as a new comer to UIUC and living in campus for a few months, I notice there is segregation taking place in U of I. It {{might not be so}} obvious, but I believe I see segregation everyday when I pay attention to my surrounding. To support my hypothesis of segregation existent, I choose to do observation in different dining halls other than only the dining hall in Peabody, where I live in. I also search and annotated the researches and articles in IDEAL and library database that will support my claim or correct my wrong perspectives or stereotypes on ???segregation??? I experience in campus. After these procedures, I will conduct a survey to a few Chinese Students on campus to compare with the data I collected through observation and annotated bibliography. Then I can know if segregation exists on campus and also explain why it happens. Furthermore, if the data and the survey agree with each other, the reliability of the answer to my research question will increase. Then, we can suggest ways that the university can do to reduce the segregation and promote a diversity environment...|$|E
