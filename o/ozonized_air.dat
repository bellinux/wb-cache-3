40|$|There is {{very little}} {{agreement}} among the numerous papers which have been published {{on the content of}} oxides of nitrogen in <b>ozonized</b> <b>air.</b> The divergence in results might be attributed to either the method of analysis or the performance of the individual ozone generator. There are many methods for the determination of nitric acid and the oxides of nitrogen but the common method for analysis of ozone involves the re-action between potassium iodide and a measured volume of ozonized oxygen. The iodine liberated by the ozone is determined by the standard thiosulfate method. The method of analysis has been criticized on the basis that oxides of nitrogen which are present in <b>ozonized</b> <b>air</b> also liberate iodine. However, it has been established that nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide do not exist as such in the presence of ozone but are oxidized to nitric anhydride (1, 2). Furthermore, it has been established by many investigators (3, 4, 5, 6) that pure, dilute nitric acid is not an oxidizin...|$|E
40|$|The {{early stages}} of thermal {{oxidation}} of the basal plane of highly oriented graphite (HOPG) have been investigated in <b>ozonized</b> <b>air.</b> Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) was employed to determine the surface topography on the nanometer scale. At temperatures within the range 300 - 500 °C and at O 3 concentrations below 1 ppm, the abstraction of carbon atoms from the basal plane, that is, formation of pointlike defects, occurs. These defects upon further oxidation are enlarged to monolayer deep pits with diameters in the range 1 - 100 nm. Pit formation does not proceed continuously during oxidation and is strongly inhibited when a critical pit density is reached. The pits are not generated {{very close to the}} pit edges with the consequence of a quite uniform not purely statistical coverage of the HOPG surface with the pits. Oxidation time, temperature, and O 3 concentration can be used to control the pit density and their distribution across the surface, the pit diameter, and the diameter distribution with unprecedented reproducibility. Well-defined nanostructured HOPG surfaces with a pit density in the range 10 - 25. 000 μm- 2 can be obtained...|$|E

40|$|Ozone (O 3) gas {{discovered}} {{in the mid-nineteenth century}} is a molecule consisting of three atoms of oxygen in a dynamically unstable structure due to the presence of mesomeric states. Although O 3 has dangerous effects, yet researchers believe it has many therapeutic effects. Ozone therapy has been utilized and heavily studied for more than a century. Its effects are proven, consistent, safe and with minimal and preventable side effects. Medical O 3 is used to disinfect and treat disease. Mechanism of actions is by inactivation of bacteria, viruses, fungi, yeast and protozoa, stimulation of oxygen metabolism, activation of the immune system. Medication forms in a gaseous state are somewhat unusual, and {{it is for this reason}} that special application techniques have had to be developed for the safe use of O 3. In local applications as in the treatment of external wounds, its application in the form of a transcutaneous O 3 gas bath has established itself as being the most practical and useful method, for example at low (sub-atmospheric) pressure in a closed system guaranteeing no escape of O 3 into the surrounding <b>air.</b> <b>Ozonized</b> water, whose use is particularly known in dental medicine, is optimally applied as a spray or compress. Diseases treated are infected wounds, circulatory disorders, geriatric conditions, macular degeneration, viral diseases, rheumatism/arthritis, cancer, SARS and AIDS...|$|R
40|$|Background: Ozone {{is a major}} {{secondary}} air pollutant often reaching high concentrations in urban areas under strong daylight, high temperature and stagnant high-pressure systems. Ozone in the troposphere is a pollutant that is harmful to the plant. Principal Findings: By exposing cells to a strong pulse of <b>ozonized</b> <b>air,</b> an acute cell death was observed in suspension cells of Arabidopsis thaliana used as a model. We demonstrated that O 3 treatment induced the activation of a plasma membrane anion channel that is an early prerequisite of O 3 -induced cell death in A. thaliana. Our data further suggest interplay of anion channel activation with well known plant responses to O 3, Ca 2 + influx and NADPH-oxidase generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mediating the oxidative cell death. This interplay might be fuelled by several mechanisms {{in addition to the}} direct ROS generation by O 3; namely, H 2 O 2 generation by salicylic and abscisic acids. Anion channel activation was also shown to promote the accumulation of transcripts encoding vacuolar processing enzymes, a family of proteases previously reported to contribute to the disruption of vacuole integrity observed during programmed cell death. Significance: Collectively, our data indicate that anion efflux is an early key component of morphological and biochemical events leading to O 3 -induced programmed cell death. Because ion channels and more specifically anion channels assume a crucial position in cells, an understanding about the underlying role(s) for ion channels in the signalling pathway leading t...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{describe}} an experiment to remove NO{sub x} from air-like gas flows by optimizing its oxidation to nitric acid. Their {{aim is to}} demonstrate an efficient de-NO{sub x} process that can replace the catalytic converter of today`s automobiles and recover greater engine performance. NO is oxidized to HNO{sub 3 } by injecting O{sub 3 } from an auxiliary air discharge unit, and the acid is scrubbed by a granular NaOH filter, the final product being NaNO{sub 3 }. In theory this scheme requires less engine power than the enthalpy loss through the catalytic converter, and permits engine operation with oxygen-rich fuel mixtures at high compression ratios for peak thermodynamic efficiency. Experiments utilize a glass tube flow reactor with a 20 liter/minute flow mixed from the separate injections of compressed <b>ozonized</b> <b>air</b> and an admixture of 200 ppm of NO in nitrogen from a small pressurized bottle, for net proportions of 89 % N{sub 2 }, 11 % O{sub 2 }, 120 ppm NO. Ozone concentration is selected by adjusting {{the frequency of the}} repetitive-pulsed coaxial-barrier air discharge cell. For O{sub 3 }:NO ratios greater than unity a chain of reactions successively produce NO{sub 2 }, NO{sub 3 }, and N{sub 2 }O{sub 5 } which then combines with ambient H{sub 2 }O to form HNO{sub 3 }. The overall efficiency is dominated by the electrical efficiency of the ozonizer, at present about 30 eV/O{sub 3 } within the discharge...|$|E
40|$|Ozone (O 3) -induced {{cell death}} in two suspension-cultured cell lines of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) derived from Bel-W 3 (hyper-sensitive to O 3) and Bel-B (highly {{tolerant}} to O 3) varieties were studied. By exposing the newly prepared cell {{lines to the}} pulse of <b>ozonized</b> <b>air,</b> we could reproduce the conditions demonstrating the difference in O 3 sensitivity as observed in their original plants, depending on the exposure time. Since O 3 -induced acute cell death was observed in the dark, the requirement for photochemical reactions could be eliminated. Addition of several ROS scavengers and chelators inhibited the cell death induced by O 3, indicating that singlet oxygen (1 O 2), hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2), hydroxyl radical and redox-active metals such as Fe 2 + play central roles in O 3 -induced acute damages to the cells. As expected, we observed the generation of 1 O 2 and H 2 O 2 in the O 3 -treated cells using chemiluminescent probes. On the other hand, an NADPH oxidase inhibitor, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and some SOD mimics showed no inhibitory effect. Thiols added as antioxidants unexpectedly behaved as prooxidants drastically enhancing the O 3 -induced cell death. It is noteworthy that some ROS scavengers effectively rescued the cells from dying even treated after the pulse of O 3 exposure, confirming the post-ozone progress of ROS-dependent cell death mechanism. Since {{one of the key}} differences between Bel-B and Bel-W 3 was suggested to be the capacity for ROS detoxification by catalase, the endogenous catalase activities were compared in vivo in two cell lines. As expected, catalase activity in Bel-B cells was ca. 7 -fold greater than that in Bel-W 3 cells. Interestingly, Ca 2 + chelators added prior to (not after) the pulse of O 3 effectively inhibited the induction of cell death. In addition, increases in cytosolic Ca 2 + concentration sensitive to Ca 2 + chelators, ion channel blockers, and ROS scavengers were observed in the transgenic Bel-W 3 cells expressing aequorin, suggesting the action of Ca 2 + as a secondary messenger initiating the oxidative cell death. The O 3 -induced calcium response in Bel-W 3 cells was much greater than Bel-B cells. Based on the results, possible pathways for O 3 -dependent generation of the lethal level of ROS and corresponding signaling mechanism for induction of cell death were discussed...|$|E
40|$|En el presente trabajo estudia el tratamiento físico químico basado en filtración y ozonización, de las aguas servidas de la ciudad de Alausí, al Sur de la Provincia de Chimborazo. Previamente se midió el caudal de dicha corriente residual, que proyectado al año 2020 promedió 16 L/s y, se caracterizó la misma, en cuanto a la medición de nueve parámetros indicadores de la contaminación, que fueron los sólidos mientras no se tratan las aguas servidas, la concentración de este parámetro de las aguas del río aumenta en 67 %, pero una vez tratadas con el sistema bajo estudio, este porcentaje será sólo 10 %. La Revisión Ambiental Inicial rindió solamente un 17 % del total de puntos a obtener y la Evaluación de Impacto Ambiental indica un mejoramiento estimado del 136 % de la calidad {{ambiental}}, lo que implica una relación estimada beneficio ambiental /costo de 0, 0026 unidades de porcentaje por cada USD invertido. This work {{deals on}} the physical chemical treatment, based on filtration and ozonization of Alausi city sewage, at the Chimborazo province South. Previously, the sewage flux was measured and pro jected to 2020 year near 16 L/s and the sewage was characterized on base of nine contamination parameters, such as solids (totals, suspended and dissolved), Biochemical Oxygen Demand of 5 days and 20 °C, Chemical Oxygen Demand, Nitrogen (total and organic) and Coliforms (totals and fecals). According to the obtained data from the sampling design system and from the laboratories of the Etapa enterprise of Cuenca city, the Alausi sewage {{can be considered as}} middle strength. It was developed two series of exp eriments, batch about the sewage and continuous on the <b>ozonized</b> <b>air</b> current, with 2 and 3 minutes of detention times in a 16 liters effective volume reactor. The different parameters about removing efficiencies were appreciable highs; this is, for 3 minute s of detention time, such efficiencies were between 83 y 94 %, with the exception of total nitrogen (20 %) and organic nitrogen (70 %), because of the nitrate formation. For 2 minutes of detention time, the efficiencies averaged above 97 %, also with the exception of total nitrogen (71 %). As the BOD 5 balance, while sewage be not treated, the concentration of this parameter for the water river increase in a 67 %, but once treated, this value will be reduced down to 10 %. The Initial Environmental Revisio n yielded 17 % only from the totality of points possible to be obtained and the Environmental Impact Evaluation showed an environmental quality about 136 % better; this implies an estimated environmental benefit /cost relationship about 0, 0026 percent unit s by each USD invested...|$|E
