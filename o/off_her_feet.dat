After removing the bodies from their shallow graves, Geyer noticed that Nellie's feet had been removed. After discovering that Nellie had club foot, he theorized that Holmes had cut <b>off</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> to prevent a distinctive identification of the body. He then followed Holmes to Indianapolis, where Holmes had rented a cottage. Holmes {{was reported to have}} visited a local pharmacy to purchase the drugs which he used to kill Howard Pitezel, and a repair shop to sharpen the knives he used to chop up the body before he burned it.

One morning he notices that Connie is fixing herself up to go into the city, with brand new shoes and lingerie draped over a chair, and he tells Connie he will wait for her so they can go into the city together. She urges him to go without her, that she won't be ready for quite a while, so he tries to get her to agree to meet him for lunch, but she says she has a salon appointment and won't be able to meet him.

500|$|Writer Glen Morgan {{said of the}} episode, [...] "Duchovny {{challenged}} us to do a [...] "Beyond the Sea" [...] for him.

500|$|The {{miscarriage}} leaves Steffy devastated and {{she decides}} to leave town, ending her marriage to Liam. Wood noted that [...] "Steffy was so set on she really messed this up" [...] and noticed that Liam still had feelings for Hope. Speaking of the miscarriage {{and the end of}} Liam and Steffy's marriage, Wood explained: [...] "She is obviously trying a reason to get out of it. In her heart and soul, she wants to be with him. She felt he was her soulmate, but with everything that has happened, she feels it was her fault and she can't change that. She should never have gotten on that motorcycle and he told her not to. There have been so many things that happened that it opens her eyes to the possibility that maybe he should be with Hope." [...] Upon Steffy's brief return to the show in 2015, she realizes that she still loves Liam, despite believing that these feelings were gone. Wood explained [...] "They lost a child together, so they’ll always have that emotional connection." [...] Despite liking the fact that Steffy [...] "speaks up" [...] and [...] "fights for love", Wood said that she wanted [...] "to see someone come in and sweep her <b>off</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> and take that pain away", not wanting her to fight for [...] "a man that flip flops". However, Liam is involved with Steffy's cousin Ivy Forrester (Ashleigh Brewer) and Steffy does not win him back.

He demanded that she change her name back to Ritschel (having borne {{the name of her}} mother and stepfather, Friedländer, at her own request, for many years) while converting from Ritschel's nominal Catholicism to Protestantism.

2500|$|Although her {{difficulties}} with the English language persisted, {{as time went}} on, the once rigidly formal Portuguese Infanta mellowed and began to enjoy {{some of the more}} innocent pleasures of the court. She loved to play cards and shocked devout Protestants by playing on Sundays. She enjoyed dancing and took great delight in organising masques. She had a great love for the countryside and picnics; fishing and archery were also favourite pastimes. In a far cry from her convent-days the newly liberated Catherine displayed a fondness for the recent trend of court ladies wearing men's clothing, which we are told, [...] "showed off her pretty, neat legs and ankles"; and she was even reported to have considered leading the way in wearing shorter dresses, which would show <b>off</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet.</b> In 1670, on a trip to Audley End with her ladies-in-waiting, the once chronically shy Catherine attended a country fair disguised as a village maiden, but was soon discovered and, due to the large crowds, forced to make a hasty retreat. And when in 1664 her favourite painter, Jacob Huysmans, a Flemish Catholic, painted her as St Catherine, it promptly set a trend among court ladies.|$|E
2500|$|The Moon by Night (1963, [...] ) rejoins Vicky when, {{at the age}} of fourteen, {{she begins}} to attract the {{attention}} of teenage boys, and her life is disrupted yet again as Maggy moves away and the family prepares to move into a New York City apartment. Having grown up outside the fictional village of Thornhill, Connecticut, Vicky is unhappy and uncomfortable with the move to the big city. [...] As her parents soften the blow by taking the family on a ten-week cross-country camping trip, Vicky meets Zachary Gray, a handsome, charming, mercurial boy who sweeps her <b>off</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet.</b> He follows her around the country, leaving notes and on occasion going sightseeing with the Austins. Later in the trip, Zachary has a rival with Andy Ford, who is more stable and dependable than Zach - and therefore less exciting. Vicky also struggles with her own identity issues as she begins to see herself as an individual, not just a member of the family. She is concerned about her developing looks and is even more concerned about her developing personality. Although some of her concerns are eased by Uncle Douglass in California, Vicky remains doubtful of her true identity and maturity throughout the novel.|$|E
2500|$|Between the Bourne films, she {{appeared}} in Mona Lisa Smile (2003) as Joan, a student at Wellesley College in 1953, whose art professor (Julia Roberts) encourages her {{to pursue a career}} in law rather than become a wife and mother. Critic Stephen Holden referred to her as one of cinema's [...] "brightest young stars", but the film met with generally unfavorable reviews. Stiles played a Wisconsin college student who is swept <b>off</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> by a Danish prince, played by Luke Mably in The Prince and Me (2004), directed by Martha Coolidge. Stiles told an interviewer that she was very similar to her character Paige Morgan. Critic Scott Foundas said while she was, as always, [...] "irrepressibly engaging", the film was a [...] "strange career choice for Stiles". This echoed criticism in reviews of A Guy Thing (2003), a romantic comedy with Jason Lee and Selma Blair. Critic Dennis Harvey wrote that Stiles was [...] "wasted" [...] and Stephen Holden called her [...] "a serious actress from whom comedy does not seem to flow naturally". In 2005, Stiles was cast opposite her Hamlet co-star Liev Schreiber in The Omen, a remake of the 1976 horror film. The film was released on June 6, 2006. She returned to the Bourne series with a much larger role in The Bourne Ultimatum in 2007, which is her highest-grossing film to date.|$|E

When a difficult pregnancy required <b>her</b> to be <b>off</b> of <b>her</b> <b>feet,</b> Carr turned to romance novels to distract herself. She soon decided to write her own novels.|$|R
5000|$|Karen {{has been}} {{described}} by Grace Adler as [...] "a spoiled, shrill, gold-digging socialite who would sooner chew <b>off</b> <b>her</b> own <b>foot</b> than do an honest day's work." [...] She is also a promiscuous borderline alcoholic/drug addict with an often tenuous grip on reality and very few morals. She is good friends with Will Truman’s equally narcissistic best friend Jack McFarland. After Mullally spoke her lines in her normal speaking voice in the pilot, she increased her delivery in pitch in subsequent episodes until her distinct nasal voice became one of the character's trademarks.|$|R

2500|$|The New York critics' {{reviews of}} the {{original}} production were mixed to positive. A 1993 New York Times review commented that the musical [...] "has grown in stature over the years, primarily because of its superb score.... combined a lyrical simplicity with a lush romanticism, beautifully captured in numbers like 'I Loved You Once in Silence' and 'If Ever I Would Leave You.' These ballads sung by Guenevere and Lancelot {{are among the most}} memorable in the Lerner-Loewe catalogue. King Arthur supplies the wit, with songs like 'I Wonder What the King Is Doing Tonight.'" [...] A 2003 review noted, [...] "this musically rich, legend-based classic evokes enough swashbuckling spectacle to keep one smiling. And for lovers of dime-store romance, Camelot has it all – a beautiful English princess swept <b>off</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> by a shy, but passionate bachelor king; an ardent French knight, torn between devotion to his liege and an uncontrollable hunger, reciprocated, to be sure, for the king's tempestuous wife.... Camelot features a score rich in English country-tune charm by Mr. Lerner. [...] Its lyrics, by Mr. Loewe , never fail to dazzle with their virtuosity and wit." [...] However, [...] "Jay Lerner's murky book... has helped sink many a revival of the musical.... It's a good story, but Lerner's book is talky and dense, filled with pontificating soliloquies that would have been more powerfully contained in song. Moreover, while the entire show rushes towards a bloody climax... when it finally arrives, it is merely sketched upon in one song, [...] "Guinevere." ...The score, though, is pure magic" ...|$|E

When they heard that the ladies had left Chatillon, she and her father, and, indeed, all the {{inhabitants}} of Echanbroignes, felt that {{they could no longer}} be safe in the village; and they had started off to follow the royalist army on foot through the country. From place to place they had heard tidings, sometimes of one party, and sometimes of another. The old man had borne the fatigue and dangers of the journey well; for, though now old, he had been a hard-working man all his life, and was tough and seasoned in his old age; but poor Annot had suffered dreadfully. The clothes she had brought with her were nearly falling <b>off</b> <b>her</b> back; <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> were all but bare, and were cut and blistered with walking. Grief and despair had taken the colour and roundness from her cheek, and she had lacked time on her mournful journey to comb the pretty locks of which she was generally so proud.|$|R
50|$|In the {{meantime}} he has befriended the young American-born Caitlin, who dreams {{of becoming a}} dancer. She {{is in fact the}} daughter of one of the children betrayed by his grandfather, all of whom had survived Auschwitz. She also stands for liberal attitudes and as an outsider too is not tainted by the small-town narrow mindedness from which Lucas has to suffer. Just as he is preparing to commit himself to Caitlin and what she stands for, she is involved in a crash and Lucas is only able to rescue her from the burning car by sawing <b>off</b> <b>her</b> trapped <b>foot.</b> At first he is treated as a hero, but Benoit, fearing denunciation by Lucas, uses his position as a journalist to question his actions.|$|R

A little hand-mirror, framed in carved ivory inlaid with coral, and a fan, lay on a tiny spindle-legged table close in front of her, together with a buff-coloured cup of chocolate.
