40|$|Abstract. This paper {{defines the}} notion of hybrid atomicityfor nested trans-action systems, and {{presents}} and verifies an algorithm providing this prop-erty. Hybrid atomicity is a modular property; it allows the correctness of a system to be deduced {{from the fact that}} each object is implemented to have the property.

In recent years much research as focused on ex-tending concurrency control methods to take the semantics of the data into account, thus permitting more concurrency by allowing transactions executing commuting operations to run concurrently (e. g., see [9, 14, 17, 16, 15]).

40|$|Human Dignity: Beyond Suspicion?On the Meaning of Human Dignity for Contemporary EthicsDavid G. KirchhofferSUMMARYThe {{widespread}} use of human dignity in human rights documen ts andnational constitutions has a downside, namely, the rise of #dignitytalk#: one finds human dignity being used by opposing sides of anethical debate to justify contradictory moral behaviours, as if anappeal t o human dignity makes an argument unassailable. E. g., peoplebase argume nts both for and against stem-cell research, or both for andagainst aid in dying, on human dignity. More surprisingly, while humandignity, as the supposed basis of human rights, is meant to protectpeople from viol ence, some people appeal to human dignity to justifytheir violence. The problem may stem from apparent disagreement regarding t he meaningof human dignity and its basis. On one hand there are argumen ts thatclaim that (1) human dignity is a moral good that all human pers onsalready inherently and inviolably have. These arguments can be furth erdivided into two groups: (1 a) the ontological group situates human dignity in the ontological status of human persons as, for example, {{made in the image}} of God or as members of the human species; (1 b) the capacity group situates human dignity in the potential inherent in one or more typically human capacities, e. g. rationality, autonomy, and the capacities to act and to love, among others. On the other hand, there are arguments that claim that (2) human dignity is something that human persons acquire based on their moral behaviour. Here too, there are two groups: (2 a) the psychological group situates human dignity in some subjective sense of self-worth as a person leading a meaningful life; (2 b) the social group argues that a person acquires dignity {{to the extent that he}} or shelives a morally good life in a given social context. Furthermore, the critics are suspicious of the link between humandignity and religious faith. First, the belief in human dignity i soften grounded in religious beliefs, which is supposedly untenable insecular society. Second, appeals to human dignity are ostensibly covertattempts to foist allegedly #conservative#, religious moral agendas on secular society. There are three possible responses to the above critique: (1) discardthe concept of human dignity; (2) ignore the crit ique and continue tobase the concept in one of the bases highlighted in Chapter 1; (3) develop a renewed understanding of the concept that takes the challengesposed by the critique seriously. Option (1) is methodol ogicallyunacceptable, and option (2) fails to resolve the problems. Whi chleaves option (3). Option (1) is based on unacceptable metho dological assumptions: (a) ethics is understood only as a legalistic tec hne that provides simplerules for the adjudication of moral dilemmas; (b) a hermeneutic ofsuspicion that deconstructs moral language is emphas ised at the expenseof a hermeneutic of generosity that takes meaning se riously; (c) thereis an unjustifiable epistemological reductionism that seeks to groundhuman dignity in a single feature of the human person a nd to apply itto a single feature of the moral event. Option (2) does not overcome the problem of #dignity talk#. It likewisesuffers from reductionist views of ethics, the human person, and themoral event. This only aggravates the related prob lems of moralism andrelativism. Moralism occurs when a group holds that only they are rightand good and all others are wrong and bad. Moralism gives rise torelativism to the extent that other groups can only chall enge themoralism of the first group by being equally moralistic, claimi ng thatthey are the ones who are really right and good. This is a form ofrelativism precisely because, for the respective groups, there is apparently no Archimedean point that can be used to adjudicate betweentheir opposing moral claims. The only solution is either to overpowerthe ot her group, or to tolerate it. Option (3) proposes alternative methodological assumptions that overcomethe major problems with options (1) and (2) : (a) ethics is understoodto be a hermeneutical enterprise that seeks to u nderstand and makesense of the meanings inherent in moral behaviour; (b) the human personis understood as a multidimensional, meaning-seeking and -givinghistorical, corporeal subject who is always intrinsically re lated toall that is, and who seeks to realise a meaningful sense of sel f-worthin and through her moral interactions with these relationships; (c) themoral event is understood as a multidimensional, time-bound occu rrencethat consists of, among other things, intentions, acts, andcircumstances, all of which have a bearing upon the moral quality of theevent. Thus, unlike the #either#or# paradigm of the other two options,thethird option begins from a #both#and# paradigm that resistsepistemologic al and ontological reductionism in favour of a view ofreality that valu es the complexity and multidimensionality of theGestalt. This, combined with the emphasis on the historicity of boththe human person and the m oral event, helps to overcome the challengesof moralism and relativism. Moralism is overcome because one is madeaware of the ever-present poss ibility that one may be wrong. Relativismis overcome because, despite t his possibility, and indeed bearing it inmind, we continue to seek the fullness of the Truth in conversation withothers. The Truth cannot be reduced to particular interpretations, orindeed to the conversation. It is always transcendent, calling usforward. Two theological concepts are used to give expression to thisreality, the Already and the Not Yet, a nd the Eschatological Proviso. The former underlines the fact that altho ugh we can already haveglimpses of the Truth, we have not yet realised the fullness of theTruth in lived reality. The latter underlines the fact that no humanendeavour, due to its historical character, can ever fu lly realise theTruth. We always remain, in that sense, tragic beings. The findings ofthe legitimate application of a hermeneutic of suspicion are re-readusing a hermeneutic of generosity, that is, a hermeneutic that seeks toreconstruct a meaningful understan ding of the concept of human dignitybased on the more holistic assumpti ons and a #both#and# paradigm. The result is the Component Dimensions of Human Dignity model (table 1) which serves as a descriptive lens through whic h we can interpret themeanings that particular individuals in particula r circumstancesascribe to human dignity, as well as how these affect th eir moralchoices. Moreover, the same model serves a normative function in that itcan critique these particular understandings, for example, wh ere theyare reductionist, grounding dignity in an inadequate anthropology. Table 1. The Component Dimensions of the Human Dignity ModelComponent DimensionComplementary DualityNot Yet ExistentialHave (Potential) Self-WorthBehaviouralMoral GoodMorally GoodSocialOthers# DignityMy DignityAccording to this model, at an existential level, all human personsAlready have dignity because they are human persons, i. e., because theyall have a range of inherent capacities that consti tute a potential tolive a meaningful, reflective, and morally good life. The most notable,though not the only, capacities that can be associat ed with humandignity include the abilities to reason, and to freely act in one#ssociety in a responsible way. Each person, however, in their h istoricalsituatedness, will seek to answer the irresistible drive to re alisethis potential by acquiring dignity in a unique manner. The dignity that human beings seek to acquire i s a consequence of, andtherefore the fulfilment of, their potential. Their capacities mean thatthey can become aware of their inherent worth. To become aware of one#sinherent worth means that one now has a sense o f self-worth, i. e., aconscious appreciation of one#s own dignity in rel ation to the world inwhich one lives. A person will seek to enhance thi s sense of self-worththrough his or her behaviour in society, since lif e without a sense ofself-worth is meaningless and the person will despa ir. The person pursues this sense of self-worth thr ough engaging in whatshe believes to be morally good behaviour. Since a society usuallyhonours those who behave in what that society holds to be a morally goodway, such behaviour is likely to enhance the person#s sense ofself-worth. This provides the first sense in which human dignit y is amoral good: the enhancement of a person#s sense of self-worth is amongthe legitimate, though not necessarily always conscious, ends to w hichhis or her #morally good# behaviour is directed. In other words, thefulfilment of his or her own dignity is an end in itself. However, human dignity is also a moral good in the sense that, by virtueof their inherent worth, all human beings are legitimate ends of moralbehaviour. This inherent worth means that all p eople already havedignity by virtue of their potential, regardless of w hether thispotential has been developed in any way (Others# Dignity). Nevertheless, all of these others likewise aspire to achieving a sense of self-worth. Thus on a social level, and human beings are inherentlysocial beings, I can never truly fulfil my dignity until all others havebe en able to fulfil their dignity. Thus dignity is a moral good, sinceI c an only truly acquire the moral good of my dignity by working forthe moral good of others# dignity. And we clearly live in a world inwhich thi s is not yet the case. The multidimensional understanding of human dig nity represented by themodel serves both a descriptive and a normative function in ethics. At a descriptive level the model can help us to understand why a personengages in a particular course of moral behavio ur. Here one can askthree questions. (1) What is this person#s operativ e understanding ofthe concept of human dignity? (2) What are the social influences,mores, and circumstances that may have contributed to this understandingof human dignity? (3) How does this person#s operative und erstanding ofhuman dignity affect and provide subjective justification for the moralchoices he or she makes, and the behavioural strategies he or sheundertakes?At a normative level, the model can help us to critique theunderstanding of human dignity, the social circumstances th at bring itabout, and the behaviour that it inspires. Again, we can ask threequestions: Is this person#s (or indeed one#s own) operative understanding of the concept of human dignity a proper understanding, especially insofar as it constitutes a moral good and therefore an intended end of the person#s moral behaviour? Are the social influences, mores, and circumstances that may have contributed to this understanding of human dignity, and are the person#s interpretations of these mores, etc., legitimate and correct, or should they be called into question? And are the moral choices and behavioural strategies that this person#s particular understanding of human dignity inspires morally right or wrong?To illustrate the descriptive and normative use of the multidimensionalunderstanding of human dignity, two cases are c onsidered: a violent manwho justifies his violent attacks on others as a defence of his dignity,and a terminally ill woman who chooses to end her own life withbarbiturates claiming that in this way she will be abl e to die withdignity. This summary will only address the former. The man is shown to equate dignity with a sense of self-worth that isdependent on the respect he perceives others show him. To be respectedmeans to be feared. This conception of dignity is shown to be a productof a particular experience of relationships in whi ch disrespect isviolently punished, and hence it is the strong and viol ent who are seento be respected. The result is a moral strategy that se eks to replacefeelings of shame with feelings of pride by violently opp ressing anddiminishing those who are deemed to be a threat to the man#s sense ofdignity, i. e. self-worth. This descriptive analysis helps us t <b>o</b> <b>avoid</b> amoralistic condemnation of the man as simply evil, and instead torecognise him as a human being like us struggling with his existenti alsituatedness and seeking to give meaning to his life. Nevertheless, his behaviour is morally bad. The normative aspect of themultidimensional understanding of human dignity shows that the man hasa distorted understanding of human dignity. His perspective isegotistical and only has to do with the respect he receiv es fromothers. Moreover, it requires the diminishment of others# dignit y. Therefore it is in contravention of the Social Component Dimension which holds that dignity can only be acquired by working for the moral good of everyone#s dignity. One acquires dignity through morally good behaviour; the dignity that all human beings already have is a moral good; therefore behaviour that undermines this dignity cannot be morally good and hence cannot confer true dignity on the actor. Moreover, the social circumstances and institutions that contribute to this man#s understanding of human dignity are also called into question, particularly, for example, the notion of retributive justice. Finally, the multidimensional understanding of human dignity developedhere forms a bridge between secular and religiou s understandings of theconcept, but also helps to critique them. For ex ample, the traditionalJudeo-Christian teaching that human beings have d ignity because theyare created in the image of God remains valid insofa r as the associatedtheological anthropology is likewise multidimensiona l, such as thatrevealed in a close reading of Gaudium et spes. Human be ings arealready created with a set of capacities, including reason, fre echoice, and the capacity to behave in a morally responsible way in society. But they are also called to live out that dignity by responding to God#s call to love God, neighbour and self, i. e. to realise their dignity by living in a morally good way. Thus, an adequate religious understanding of human dignity must take human freedom and the human existential desire to live a meaningful life into account. ANNEXED THESES 1. The post World War II tendency to ground human rights declarations and national constitutions on the concept of human dignity has led to a rise of #dignity talk#, that is, in an attempt to ground competing rightsclaims, parties on both sides of a moral debate appeal to the some conception of human dignity to justify their claim. The result is that the value of concept of human dignity has been diminished in recent public ethical and legal discourse, since it is often reduced simply to a polemical weapon. 2. Both contemporary usage of the concept of human dignity in public discourse, and a number of recent criticisms of this usage, suffer from a common problem, namely, a tendency to reduce human dignity to a legalistic, one-dimensional, normative criterion. This tendency is the result ofa legalistic rather than a hermeneutical understanding of ethics, and aone-dimensional rather than a multidimensional understanding of the human person to which the concept of human dignity refers. 3. The dignity of the human person is a valuable, multidimensional concept for contemporary ethical discourse, because, properly understood (asdescribed by the Component Dimensions of Human Dignity model), it can serve both as a descriptive category and a normative criterion. The concept, thus, provides the basis for a framework that can help to both understand and evaluate human moral behaviour. 4. Human dignity is best understood both as something all human beings already have and as something that all human beings aspire to realise inthe form of a sense of self-worth that results from behaving in a way that is believed to be morally justifiable and/or laudable. This tension means that human dignity is always Already and Not Yet, such that it constitutes an eschatological formal norm which directs human moral behaviour, but which, at the same time, will be filled in differently (and imperfectly) in different concrete historical circumstances. 5. Human dignity is a twofold moral good. First, as something that all human beings already have#grounded in a variety of capacities and/or beliefs#, it is a moral good as the condition of possibility for human moral behaviour and flourishing. Second, as something that all human beings aspire to realise in the form of a sense of self-worth, it is a moral good as the end of human moral behaviour. Human dignity, thus understood, continues to be of value as a normative criterion because it calls into question the moral quality of inappropriate understandings of inherent worth (e. g. one-dimensional reductions of the moral good of human dignityto inherent life or freedom), and self-worth (e. g. those which are selfish to the extent that acquiring them requires one to undermine the inherent worth of others). One only truly acquires dignity to the extent that one also works for the good of others# dignity. 6. A proper multidimensional understanding of human dignity, as illustrated by the Component Dimensions of Dignity Model#and based on a hermeneutical understanding of ethics, and multidimensional understandings of the human person and the moral event#, contributes to overcoming the moralism and relativism associated with the rise of #dignity talk#, while atthe same time making space for moral relativity in a historical world. It does because it constitutes a formal norm, the full realisation of which always transcends, and at the same time critiques, concrete materialnorms and behaviour. 7. The research shows that neither religion, nor moral language need berejected in order to engage in rational and peaceful ethical discussion. While moralism, be it secular or religious, should rightly be rejected, both religious and moral language, when properly underpinned by multidimensional, #both#and# views of reality, can contribute to mutual understanding and foster a humble desire to contribute to human flourishingthat is inclusive rather than exclusive. status: publishe...|$|E

30|$|In {{mammalian}} cells, {{there is}} a balance of ROS production and scavenging (Aon et al. 2010). A small increase in ROS levels only activates signaling pathways to initiate biological processes, but high levels of ROS also result in damage to DNA, protein, or lipids (Schieber and Chandel 2014). In this study, treatment of the MES cells cultured under 1 G with 30  μmol/L H 2 O 2 did not significantly alter the intracellular ROS production. Consistently, {{we did not observe}} increased apoptosis in these cells. It seems that cultured under 1 G, MES cells could effectively scavenge the increased ROS induced by 30  μmol/L H 2 <b>O</b> 2, <b>avoiding</b> the damage of the oxidative stress to the cells. Although 5 or 30  μmol/L H 2 O 2 did not enhance intracellular ROS levels, it was able to cause slightly but also significantly higher levels of DNA damage than that under 1 G (Fig.  2 B). It seems that H 2 O 2 as low as 5  μmol/L could induce increased DNA damage before it was scavenged by the cells.|$|R
