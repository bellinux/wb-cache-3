In the present, Oliver and Roy Harper locate {{the home of}} Digger Harkness, the boomerang-wielding murderer, where they find A.R.G.U.S. operatives looking for him as well. Caitlin Snow and Cisco Ramon arrive in Starling City to help Felicity Smoak investigate Sara Lance's death. Digger attempts to kill Lyla Michaels, Roy, and Oliver, but Barry arrives and stops him. Later, Lyla reveals Digger was part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Suicide</b> Squad. When Oliver uses extreme interrogation methods against a Russian mob member in order to locate Digger, Barry questions how emotionally stable Oliver is. Digger locates Oliver's hideout and wounds Lyla before escaping. In order to leave town, Digger plants five bombs around the city. While Oliver captures Digger, Barry uses both of their teams to defuse the bombs simultaneously. Digger is incarcerated on the island with Slade Wilson.

5|$|The largest {{stand at}} Turf Moor is the James Hargreaves Stand, which was opened in 1996 {{as part of}} a ground {{redevelopment}} project which saw two new stands built to replace the Longside and the Bee Hole End at a total cost of £5.3 million. When built it was named the North Stand, although it has its current name thanks to a six-figure sponsorship deal. The stand can accommodate 8,512 (+192 Corporate seats) spectators and was opened on 23 April 1996, replacing the Longside terrace. It runs parallel to the length of the pitch. The television gantry is located in the James Hargreaves Stand along with the media area, which is situated {{at the rear of the}} upper tier. The stand is the traditional seating area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Suicide</b> Squad, who had previously stood in the Longside until the terrace was demolished in 1995.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} whether <b>the</b> risk <b>of</b> increased <b>suicide</b> occurrence after reports on suicide is associated with <b>the</b> social characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reported <b>suicides</b> and whether this varies with similarity between <b>the</b> reported <b>suicides</b> and <b>suicides</b> in <b>the</b> population. We collected reports on all 179 individual <b>suicides</b> named in <b>the</b> 13 largest Austrian nationwide newspapers from 1996 to 2006. Information on social status and sociodemographic characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reported <b>suicides,</b> on certainty <b>of</b> labelling <b>the</b> death as a <b>suicide,</b> and on <b>the</b> <b>suicide</b> methods applied were extracted from the articles. We conducted logistic regression analyses, with <b>the</b> increase <b>of</b> post-report <b>suicides</b> within 28 days after the reports as dependent variable. In model 1, <b>the</b> increase <b>of</b> <b>suicides</b> that matched <b>the</b> reported individual <b>suicide</b> with regard to age group, sex and suicide method was used as outcome variable. In model 2, <b>the</b> increase <b>of</b> <b>suicides</b> that were different from <b>the</b> reported <b>suicide</b> with regard to these characteristics was the outcome. In model 3, <b>the</b> post-report increase <b>of</b> total <b>suicides</b> was <b>the</b> dependent variable. Celebrity status <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reported <b>suicide,</b> age <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reported <b>suicide</b> between 30 and 64 years, and definitive labelling as a suicide were {{associated with an increased}} risk of a post-report increase of similar suicides; criminality (i. e. the individual was reported as suspected or convicted <b>of</b> crime) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reported <b>suicide</b> was associated with a lower risk of a post-report increase. In dissimilar <b>suicides,</b> none <b>of</b> <b>the</b> variables was associated with a post-report increase of <b>suicides.</b> Celebrity status <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reported <b>suicide</b> was <b>the</b> only predictor <b>of</b> a post-report increase <b>of</b> total <b>suicides.</b> <b>The</b> findings support the hypothesis that social variables <b>of</b> reported <b>suicides</b> impact <b>the</b> risk <b>of</b> post-report copycat behaviour. Evidence of copycat effects seemed to be strongest in suicides that were similar to the respective model with regard to age group, sex, and suicide method.

40|$|Background: There is {{widespread}} concern regarding <b>the</b> possible influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Internet on suicidal behaviour. <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> {{this study was}} to estimate the prevalence and characteristics of Internet-related suicide in England. Methods: Cross sectional study based on detailed review <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inquest reports <b>of</b> <b>suicides</b> occurring in <b>the</b> areas served by 12 Coroners in England. Evidence of Internet use in relation to <b>the</b> <b>suicide</b> was sought for each death. Results: Altogether inquest reports for 593 suicides (all methods) in 2005 and 166 suicides using specific methods in 2006 - 7 were assessed. There was evidence of a direct Internet contribution in nine (1. 5 % 95 %CI 0. 7 to 2. 9 %) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 593 <b>suicides</b> in 2005. In seven (77. 8 %) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cases the individuals had used the Internet to research <b>the</b> methods <b>of</b> <b>suicide</b> they used. Five (55. 6 %) individuals had used 'unusual' high-lethality methods, whereas such methods were only used in 1. 7 % of all suicides (p < 0. 001). There was evidence of Internet involvement in 2. 4 % (0. 7 % to 6. 1 %) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suicides</b> in 2006 - 2007. None <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Internet-related <b>suicides</b> appeared to occur as part of a <b>suicide</b> pact. Limitations: <b>The</b> contribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Internet to <b>suicide</b> rates may be under-estimated in this analysis as Coroners are unlikely to comprehensively pursue <b>the</b> possibility <b>of</b> Internet involvement in all the deaths they investigate. Conclusions: Easy access to information about suicide methods and pro-suicide web sites on the Internet appears to contribute to a small but significant proportion of suicides. A key impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Internet appears to be in relation to information concerning suicide methods. © 2012 Elsevier B. V...|$|R

50|$|According to Anton J. L. van Hooff, hanging was <b>the</b> {{most common}} <b>suicide</b> method in {{primitive}} and pre-industrial societies. A 2008 review of 56 countries based on World Health Organization mortality data found that hanging {{was the most}} common method in most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> countries, accounting for 53 percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> male <b>suicides</b> and 39 percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> female <b>suicides.</b> In England and Wales, hanging is the most commonly used method, and is particularly prevalent in <b>the</b> group <b>of</b> males aged 15-44, comprising almost half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suicides</b> in <b>the</b> group. It is the second most common method among women, behind poisoning. In 1981 hanging accounted for 23.5 percent of male suicides, and by 2001 the figure had risen to 44.2 percent. <b>The</b> proportion <b>of</b> hangings as suicides in 2005 among women aged 15-34 was 47.2 percent, having risen from 5.7 percent in 1968. In the United States it is the second most common method, behind firearms, and {{is by far the most}} common method for those in psychiatric wards and hospitals. Hanging accounts for a greater percentage of suicides among younger Americans than among older ones. Differences exist among ethnic groups; research suggests that hanging is the most common method among Chinese and Japanese Americans.
