5|$|The calls made by caecilians and {{salamanders}} {{are limited}} to occasional soft squeaks, grunts or hisses and have not been much studied. A clicking sound sometimes produced by caecilians may be a means <b>of</b> <b>orientation,</b> as in bats, or a form of communication. Most salamanders are considered voiceless, but the California giant salamander (Dicamptodon ensatus) has vocal cords and can produce a rattling or barking sound. Some species of salamander emit a quiet squeak or yelp if attacked.|$|E
5|$|The site of S.iniae {{infection}} and its clinical presentation vary from species to species. In tilapia, S.iniae causes meningoencephalitis, with symptoms including lethargy, dorsal rigidity, and erratic swimming behavior; death follows {{in a matter}} of days. In rainbow trout, it is typically associated with septicemia and central nervous system damage. Symptoms are consistent with septicemia, and include lethargy and loss <b>of</b> <b>orientation</b> (as in tilapia), exophthalmia, corneal opacity, and external and internal bleeding.|$|E

5|$|Vision is {{the main}} sense <b>of</b> <b>orientation</b> in humans, and the primary {{function}} of camouflage is to deceive the human eye. Camouflage works through concealment (whether by countershading, preventing casting shadows, or disruption of outlines), mimicry, or possibly by dazzle. In modern warfare, some forms of camouflage, for example face paints, also offer concealment from infrared sensors, while CADPAT textiles in addition help to provide concealment from radar.|$|E
5|$|As an {{adaptation}} for navigating its complex reef environment, the epaulette shark moves by seemingly walking, bending its body from side-to-side and pushing {{off of the}} substrate with its paddle-shaped pectoral and pelvic fins. Its gait {{is similar to that}} of salamanders, an example of convergent evolution. The shark is capable of swimming, but often prefers to walk along the sandy or coral bottom even when the water is deep enough to allow it to swim freely. The cartilaginous supports of the epaulette shark's paired fins are reduced and separated when compared to other sharks, allowing them to be rotated for use as limbs. This mode of locomotion even enables the shark to crawl out of the water to access isolated tidal pools. The gait of the epaulette shark is convergently similar to those of tetrapods such as salamanders, suggesting that the movements needed for walking on land may predate, and facilitated the evolution of, the first terrestrial vertebrates. Epaulette sharks are largely nocturnal and are most active in low water. They often hide inside or below coral heads, though it is enough for the head to be covered even if the rest of the body is exposed. Sometimes they perch in the open on sandy flats or atop reefs facing into the current, a form <b>of</b> <b>orientation</b> known as rheotaxis that may improve respiration or predator awareness.|$|E
5|$|Many {{performances}} {{deal with}} behaviors {{that occur in}} daily life. However, {{in accordance with the}} overriding principle of beauty, such behaviors are stylized to be presented on stage. Peking opera does not aim to accurately represent reality. Experts of the art form contrast the principles of Peking opera with the principle of Mo, mimes or imitation, that is found in western dramas. Peking opera should be suggestive, not imitative. The literal aspects of scenes are removed or stylized to better represent intangible emotions and characters. The most common stylization method in Peking opera is roundness. Every motion and pose is carefully manipulated to avoid sharp angles and straight lines. A character looking upon an object above them will sweep their eyes in a circular motion from low to high before landing on the object. Similarly, a character will sweep their hand in an arc from left to right in order to indicate an object on the right. This avoidance of sharp angles extends to three-dimensional movement as well; reversals <b>of</b> <b>orientation</b> often {{take the form of a}} smooth, S-shaped curve. All of these general principles of aesthetics are present within other performance elements as well.|$|E
40|$|We explore {{models of}} hard-rod fluids with {{a finite number}} <b>of</b> allowed <b>orientations,</b> and {{construct}} their bulk phase diagrams within Onsager's second virial theory. For a one-component fluid, we show that the discretization <b>of</b> the <b>orientations</b> leads {{to the existence of}} an artificial (almost) perfectly aligned nematic phase, which coexists with the (physical) nematic phase if the number <b>of</b> <b>orientations</b> is sufficiently large, or with the isotropic phase if the number <b>of</b> <b>orientations</b> is small. Its appearance correlates with the accuracy of sampling the nematic orientation distribution within its typical opening angle. For a binary mixture this artificial phase also exists, and a much larger number <b>of</b> <b>orientations</b> is required to shift it to such high densities that it does not interfere with the physical part of the phase diagram.

40|$|The <b>orientation</b> <b>of</b> {{cells in}} the natural honey bee combs {{attached}} to the horizontal and sloped surfaces was investigated. 263 samples of newly constructed natural combs were obtained.
