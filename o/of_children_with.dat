5|$|A 2000 UK {{systematic}} review (York) found that water fluoridation {{was associated with}} a decreased proportion <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> cavities of 15% and with a decrease in decayed, missing, and filled primary teeth (average decreases was 2.25teeth). The review found that the evidence was of moderate quality: few studies attempted to reduce observer bias, control for confounding factors, report variance measures, or use appropriate analysis. Although no major differences between natural and artificial fluoridation were apparent, the evidence was inadequate for a conclusion about any differences.|$|E
5|$|Appendicitis {{may present}} with vomiting, {{abdominal}} pain, {{and a small}} amount of diarrhea in up to 33% of cases. This is in contrast to the large amount of diarrhea that is typical of gastroenteritis. Infections of the lungs or urinary tract in children may also cause vomiting or diarrhea. Classical diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) presents with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, but without diarrhea. One study found that 17% <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> DKA were initially diagnosed as having gastroenteritis.|$|E

5|$|Malaria {{has several}} serious complications.

Although rare in young children with severe malaria, acute respiratory distress syndrome occurs in 5–25% of adults and up to 29% of pregnant women. Coinfection of HIV with malaria increases mortality. Renal failure is a feature of blackwater fever, where hemoglobin from lysed red blood cells leaks into the urine.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Harmful {{nature of}} {{epilepsy}} {{can affect the}} patient and their parent. Stigma, arising from it, affects the patient and their family. To relieve it understanding {{the experiences of the}} parent are useful. This study was aimed at understanding the experiences <b>of</b> parent <b>of</b> <b>child</b> <b>with</b> epilepsy in Iran. Methods: In this interpretative phenomenological study, 10 parents who took care <b>of</b> their <b>child</b> <b>with</b> epilepsy were participated. Data were collected through in-depth semi-structured interviews. After transcription, data were analyzed using Van Manen’s method. Results: Family stigma emerged as a main theme in data analysis with three subthemes including becoming verbally abusive, a dull and heavy shadowed look, and associates interference. Conclusion: Family stigma is a major challenge for parents <b>of</b> <b>child</b> <b>with</b> epilepsy need to special attention by health system.

5|$|Maternal age {{affects the}} chances of having a {{pregnancy}} with Down syndrome. At age 20, the chance is one in 1441; at age 30, it is one in 959; at age 40, it is one in 84; and at age 50 it is one in 44. Although the probability increases with maternal age, 70% <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> Down syndrome are born to women 35 {{years of age and}} younger, because younger people have more children. The father's older age is also a risk factor in women older than 35, but not in women younger than 35, and may partly explain the increase in risk as women age.|$|E
5|$|Parents <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> Asperger {{syndrome}} can typically trace {{differences in}} their children's development to as early as 30 months of age.

The United States Preventive Services Task Force in 2016 found it was unclear if screening was beneficial or harmful among children in whom there are no concerns.|$|E
5|$|Rates of DKA {{vary around}} the world. In the United Kingdom, about 4% {{of people with}} type 1 {{diabetes}} develop DKA each year, while in Malaysia the condition affects about 25% a year.

40|$|Background: Coping in {{parents with}} a higher stress level has been a {{neglected}} research topic so far. Method. Multivariate analyses of variance are computed to compare stress and coping between three groups of parents (N = 150) of a 6 - to 14 -year-old <b>child</b> (43 couples <b>of</b> a normally developed <b>child,</b> 53 parents <b>of</b> a <b>child</b> <b>with</b> Down syndrome and 54 parents <b>of</b> a <b>child</b> <b>with</b> externalizing behavior problems). Results: Parents <b>of</b> a <b>child</b> <b>with</b> Down syndrome reported more family related stress and stress with regard to social isolation, but reported also the highest scores of dyadic coping. Parents <b>of</b> a <b>child</b> <b>with</b> externalizing behavior problems perceived more parenting stress, psychological distress {{and a lack of}} dyadic coping.

5|$|The {{cognitive}} ability <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> AS often {{allows them to}} articulate social norms in a laboratory context, where {{they may be able}} to show a theoretical understanding of other people's emotions; however, they typically have difficulty acting on this knowledge in fluid, real-life situations.

Childhood desire for companionship can become numbed through a history of failed social encounters.|$|E
