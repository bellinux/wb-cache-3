50|$|Service on Amtrak's new Downeaster {{line between}} Boston and Portland was delayed when {{negotiations}} between Guilford {{and the national}} passenger carrier slowed due to the former's issues with equipment weight and speed limits. In December 1998, a speed limit of 79 mph was agreed upon between both parties, with the Surface Transportation Board (STB) approving it in 1999. Guilford then refused to assist Amtrak with any track improvements, forcing the STB to deal with Guilford on Amtrak's behalf. Track upgrades were eventually made in 2000, but the proposed 2001 start-up was further delayed when Guilford refused to allow Amtrak speeds in excess of 59 mph (despite STB approval of 79 mph), as well as prohibiting Amtrak from <b>operating</b> <b>test</b> trains.
