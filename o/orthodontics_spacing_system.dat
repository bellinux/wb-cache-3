50|$|A <b>space</b> <b>system</b> is a hardcode or softcode {{system for}} a game server which simulates a {{three-dimensional}} <b>space.</b> A <b>space</b> <b>system</b> such as HSpace (for Hemlock Space) is used on a PennMUSH game server, which simulates three-dimensional space in a text environment. Such a system provides for the navigation of vessels, and sometimes ship-to-ship combat. HSpace isn't the only <b>space</b> <b>system</b> available for PennMUSH, and there are almost certainly <b>space</b> <b>systems</b> available for other servers. <b>Space</b> <b>systems</b> don't generally only contain ships, either. Planets, stars, and stations, for example, may {{be present in the}} simulation. Another <b>space</b> <b>system,</b> ASpace, even employs a system for nebulae and borders, though the borders are spherical and not actually marked. Different <b>space</b> <b>systems</b> are generally suited for different themes. HSpace, for example, may be more suited for a Star Wars MUSH, (though SW1 uses a softcoded system, called DarrienSpace) while ASpace is generally used on Star Trek MUSHes because it will handle warp speeds.|$|R

It {{is based on a}} new systems engineering approach namely "Enhanced Total View Framework (ETVF) ", which seeks the concurrent development of the product and organizations involved.

The proposed method for <b>space</b> <b>system</b> mission analysis is called "Total Mission Analysis for <b>Space</b> <b>System</b> (TMASS) ". It takes into account all <b>space</b> <b>system</b> life cycle, from the time the <b>space</b> <b>system</b> is qualified for use or operation to the time it is decommissioned or disposed of.
