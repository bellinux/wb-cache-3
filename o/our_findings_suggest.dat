5000|$|Many {{voters in}} Palm Beach County who {{intended}} {{to vote for}} Gore actually marked their ballots for Pat Buchanan or spoiled their ballots because they found the ballot's layout to be confusing. The ballot displayed the list of presidential running-mate pairs alternately across two adjacent pages, with a column of punch spaces down the middle. Bush's name appeared {{at the top of}} the ballot, sparing most Bush voters from error. About 19,000 ballots were spoiled because of overvotes (two votes in the same race), compared to 3000 in 1996. According to a 2001 study in the American Political Science Review, the voting errors caused by the butterfly ballot cost Gore the election: [...] "Had PBC used a ballot format in the presidential race that did not lead to systematic biased voting errors, <b>our</b> <b>findings</b> <b>suggest</b> that, other things equal, Al Gore would have won a majority of the officially certified votes in Florida." ...|$|E
