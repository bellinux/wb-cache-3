500|$|The Charlottesville and Albemarle Railway (C) {{was a short}} {{electric}} street railroad {{operating within}} the city of Charlottesville, Virginia, United States, during the early 20th century. [...] The line was preceded by several streetcar lines operating both horse-drawn and electric powered cars dating back to 1887. [...] After facing financial difficulties, the predecessor lines were reorganized into the C in 1903. [...] The C's electric streetcars operated off of an <b>overhead</b> <b>line</b> <b>system</b> that was powered by the railroad's own power plant. [...] The C also offered electric power generated by its plant {{to the city of}} Charlottesville.

40|$|To {{meet the}} {{required}} operation speed for protection of meshed voltage source converter (VSC) high voltage direct current (HVDC) grids, traveling wave-based algorithms {{operating in the}} sub-millisecond time-frame must be used. The domain in which these algorithms operate, i. e., modal or phase, determines their performance in fault discrimination, fault type classification and faulted pole selection. In the recent literature, high-speed algorithms have been proposed for various VSC HVDC grid configurations and transmission line types; yet the choice of domain has received insufficient attention. This paper offers recommendations for the choice of domain for protection algorithm design of HVDC <b>overhead</b> <b>line</b> or cable <b>systems</b> in symmetric monopolar and bipolar configurations. The theoretical analysis of this paper, {{which is based on}} fundamental wave propagation theory, indicates that the most computationally efficient domain for protection algorithms for cable and <b>overhead</b> <b>line</b> <b>systems</b> are the phase and modal, respectively. Furthermore, the paper provides comprehensive guidelines to construct detection functions for both configurations and discusses the errors introduced by approximations. Finally, study results from a bipolar <b>overhead</b> <b>line</b> test <b>system</b> demonstrate the advantages of modal over phase domain for fast fault discrimination and classification and illustrate practical problems associated with non-ideal detection functions. status: submitte...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. As the {{requirements}} for <b>overhead</b> contact <b>line</b> <b>systems</b> increase due to higher train speeds, the need of safety equipment for these systems increases as well. Developing a component for {{the case of a}} contact wire cut to prevent further damage from the <b>overhead</b> contact <b>line</b> <b>system</b> requires an extensive knowledge about the system behaviour. Therefore, a comprehensive multi body system model (MBS) is developed in Matlab SimMechanics environment. In order to validate the datas generated from the simulations, a contact wire test stand has been constructed where cutting experiments can be run by releasing a pretensioned wire. Consequently, the force distribution during the contact wire cut is analyzed and these values are compared with the simulation results. For the comparisons, much attention is given to the period after the contact wire cut...|$|R

5000|$|After {{nationalisation}} in 1948 the GEML formed {{part of the}} Eastern Region of British Railways. The British Railways 1955 Modernisation Plan {{called for}} <b>overhead</b> <b>line</b> <b>systems</b> in Great Britain to be standardised at 25 kV AC. However, due to low clearances under bridges the route was electrified at 6.25 kV AC. The section between Liverpool Street and [...] was completed in November 1960. Extensive testing showed that smaller electrical clearances could be tolerated for the 25 kV system than originally thought necessary. As a result, it was now possible to increase the voltage without having to either raise bridges or lower the tracks along the route to obtain larger clearances. The route between Liverpool Street and Southend Victoria was converted to 25 kV AC between 1976 and 1980. Electrification was extended to Colchester in the late 1950s and finally to [...] by 1986.|$|R

50|$|When {{the line}} first opened a small steam engine was {{purchased}} by the hospital board but {{it proved to be}} underpowered and was prone to slipping on the severe gradient up from the main line.
