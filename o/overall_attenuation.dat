Method: Five probands were exposed to diagnostic vibrations of the TVS method (transfer vibration through the spine) before performing eight hours monotonous sedentary work and after it. The examined feature was the ability of the axial system to dampen vibrations spread throughout the spine. Dampening reactions of individual segments were compared to each other before and after the performance of work. Results: The TVS method applied at work has proven its adequacy in the provision of information on resonance frequencies and on the <b>overall</b> <b>attenuation</b> of the spine with sufficient accuracy so that the impact to the axial system after completing the work performance was clearly identifiable.

30|$|One of the {{important}} aspects associated with the attenuation performance of coastal forest against tsunami is the hydraulic resistance of the vegetation, which determines the <b>overall</b> tsunami <b>attenuation</b> (transmission, reflection and dissipation) by coastal forests. Efforts to derive the hydraulic resistance in terms of drag, inertia or Manning roughness coefficients have been made mostly via series of laboratory experiments (Harada and Imamura, 2000). To provide reliable values of the hydraulic resistance from laboratory tests, the complex tree structure has to be simplified first through a parameterization process, {{based on the assumption}} that the hydraulic resistance of the prototype tree and the parameterized tree model is identical. However, the methodologies used to parameterize the vegetations were often not physically-based and contradictory to each other (Husrin and Oumeraci, 2009). To date, there is no general consensus for a proper selection of the hydraulic resistance for typical coastal forest vegetation.|$|R

University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2002 In {{this study}} I {{examined}} {{the feasibility of}} using standard targets to measure sound attenuation in water due to suspended sediment.

Average target strength values for a 1. 5 inch tungsten carbide sphere differed by as much as 11. 4 dB with spreads of the upper and lower 90 % values as high as 18 dB. This high variability was likely due to a combination of factors that include multipath signal returns (exacerbated by relatively high transducer side lobes) and inaccuracies in the off-axis correction calculation.

40|$|Several recent {{theoretical}} {{studies have}} documented the sensitivities of the amplitude and waveform of a {{ground penetrating radar}} (GPR) reflection to the contrast in electromagnetic properties across the reflecting contact. Here we show that, in a setting with repetitive layering, {{it is possible to}} place constraints on conductivity and variations in permittivity within layers and across layer boundaries. The data set consists of 50 MHz, 100 MHz and 200 MHz profiles that image subparallel dipping bedding planes in a gravelly deltaic forest facies on a Lake Bonneville delta, Utah, USA. Strongly reflecting horizons with 1 – 2 m spacings bound packages with finer internal layering. From finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations of radarwave propagation through such strata, constraints are placed on the variations in permittivity across larger-scale and finer-scale layering. Modelling the relative amplitudes of reflections demonstrates that the finer-scale permittivity contrasts are ∼ 0. 4 – 0. 8 times that of the 1 – 2 m layering. Amplitude v. offset (AVO) analysis yields an upper bound of ∼ 3. 5 for the contrast in permittivity at the larger-scale layer boundaries. <b>Overall</b> signal <b>attenuation</b> requires the average conductivity to be in the range of 0. 7 – 0. 8 mS/m...|$|R
40|$|An {{efficient}} {{technique of}} designing spatial matrix filter for array signal preprocessing based on convex programming was proposed. Five methods were considered for designing the filter. In design method 1, we minimized the passband fidelity {{subject to the}} controlled <b>overall</b> stopband <b>attenuation</b> level.

In design method 3, the optimal matrix filter which has the general mean square error was considered.

In design method 5, the optimization objective function was {{the sum of the}} left stopband and the right stopband attenuation levels with the weighting factors 1 and γ, respectively, and the passband fidelity was the constraints. The optimal solution of the optimizations above was derived by the Lagrange multiplier theory. The relations between the optimal solutions were analyzed.

In this paper, an <b>overall</b> fog <b>attenuation</b> behavior of the optical wireless links installed at Milan (Italy) and Graz (Austria) under moderate continental fog conditions, and Nice (France) under dense maritime fog environments is compared and evaluated {{based on the measured}} fog attenuations data. The attenuation data evaluated here of Graz and Milan consists of five and two winter months respectively, while for Nice it consists of eight summer days. It is shown that like any other meteorological effects, optical signal attenuations in different fog environments depends very much on the season, geographical location and on the time of the day. Based on the analysed data results for moderate fog environments, we infer that attenuations are particularly high during months of December, January and February, whereas, for dense maritime fog environments it depends additionally to some other meteorological parameters besides the geographical location and the time of the day.

50|$|When {{optical fibers}} {{are exposed to}} {{ionizing}} radiation such as energetic electrons, protons, neutrons, X-rays, Ƴ-radiation, etc., they undergo 'damage'. The term 'damage' primarily refers to the additional loss of the propagating optical signal leading to decreased power at the output end {{which could lead to}} premature failure of the component and or system. In the professional literature, the effect is often named Radiation Induced Attenuation (RIA). The loss of power or 'darkening' occurs because the chemical bonds forming the optical fiber core are disrupted by the impinging high energy resulting in the appearance of new electronic transition states giving rise to additional absorption in the wavelength regions of interest. Once radiation source is removed, the fiber returns to its original state to some extent (a process called recovery). The extent of damage is governed by the balance between defect generation (excess attenuation) on one hand and defect annihilation (recovery) on the other hand. If the dose rate is low, an equilibrium state (between attenuation and recovery) is reached with some degree of darkening. On the contrary if the dose rate is high, the utility of fiber depends on the <b>overall</b> induced <b>attenuation</b> and the recovery time. Understanding these radiation induced effects is important particularly for space based applications where optical fibers are being considered for use in increasing number of applications.|$|R

MATERIAL AND METHODS: 173 patients with known or suspected aortic aneurysms or stenosis/occlusion of the abdominal aorta or its major branches were enrolled. The iso-osmolar contrast medium iodixanol (320 mg Iota/ml) was used, and data were acquired using four-, eight-, or 16 -active-detector-row scanners. Reference diagnoses were provided by surgical findings, interventional findings, or DSA. Diagnostic accuracy was estimated with reference to surgery or interventional arteriography or DSA. Image quality was assessed as excellent, good, sufficient, or insufficient, and correlations were made with attenuation values in the aortic lumen. Tolerability of iodixanol was monitored during the injection for discomfort and other adverse events, and for 72 hours after contrast injection. RESULTS: In 132 of 136 evaluable cases, MDCTA diagnosis matched the reference diagnosis, yielding an agreement rate of 97. 1 % (95 % CI 92. 6 - 99. 2 %). The quality of most MDCTA scans (147 / 173) was rated as excellent. <b>Overall</b> mean <b>attenuation</b> was 305. 7 HU.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a general sub-structuring approach {{to predict the}} acoustic performance of ducted ventilation systems. The modeling principle {{is to determine the}} subsystem characteristics by calculating the transfer functions at their coupling interfaces, and the assembly is enabled by using a patch-based interface matching technique. For a particular example of a bended ventilation duct connecting an inlet and an outlet acoustic domain, a numerical model is developed to predict its sound attenuation performance. The prediction accuracy is thoroughly validated against finite element models. Through numerical examples, the rigid-walled duct is shown to provide relatively weak transmission loss (TL) across the frequency range of interest, and exhibit only the reactive behavior for sound reflection. By integrating sound absorbing treatment such as micro-perforated absorbers into the system, the TL can be significantly improved, and the system is seen to exhibit hybrid mechanisms for sound attenuation. The dissipative effect dominates at frequencies where the absorber is designed to be effective, and the reactive effect provides compensations at the absorption valleys attributed to the resonant behavior of the absorber. This ultimately maintains the system TL at a relatively high level across the entire frequency of interest. The TL of the system can be tuned or optimized in a very efficient way using the proposed approach due to its modular nature. It is shown that a balance of the hybrid mechanism is important to achieve an <b>overall</b> broadband <b>attenuation</b> performance in the design frequency range.
