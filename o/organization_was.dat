40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to study the impact of run queue {{organization}} on the performance of synchronization methods in multiprocessor systems.

We use two canonical workload types that require task synchronization: lock accessing and barrier synchronization workloads. The results presented here show that, when fine grain synchronization is required, the distributed <b>organization</b> <b>is</b> better. However, for large granularity tasks, the performance of the distributed <b>organization</b> <b>is</b> unacceptable and the hierarchical <b>organization</b> should <b>be</b> used.
