50|$|One {{other reason}} for a company to buy back its own stock is to reward <b>holders</b> of stock <b>options.</b> Call <b>option</b> <b>holders</b> are hurt by {{dividend}} payments, since, typically, they are not eligible to receive them. A share buyback program may increase the value of remaining shares (if the buyback is executed when shares are under-priced); if so, call <b>option</b> <b>holders</b> benefit. A dividend payment short term always decreases the value of shares after the payment, so, for stocks with regularly scheduled dividends, on the day shares go ex-dividend, call <b>option</b> <b>holders</b> always lose whereas put <b>option</b> <b>holders</b> benefit. This {{does not apply to}} unscheduled (special) dividends since the strike prices of options are typically adjusted to reflect the amount of the special dividend. Finally, if the sellers into a corporate buyback are actually the call <b>option</b> <b>holders</b> themselves, they may directly benefit from temporary unrealistically favorable pricing.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proves that}} the optimal {{exercise}} time for the <b>holder</b> of an American <b>option</b> depends upon the physical drift of the underlying asset and {{the utility of the}} <b>option</b> <b>holder.</b> We illustrate our results by applying them to several families of utility functions, namely the CARA, the HARA, and the expected return. While the <b>option</b> <b>holder</b> maximises his utility, the issuer gains from the difference between the price maximising exercise boundary and the exercise boundary performed by the <b>option</b> <b>holder.</b> We provide the numerical results which describe the effect of the physical drift and the risk aversion on the issuer's expected profit. 1 1 Introduction The American option is an option contract that allows the <b>option</b> <b>holder</b> to exercise before the maturity if he is better off doing so. Because of the flexibility of choosing the exercise time, the price of the option is calculated as the value of the option in the worst case for the issuer among all feasible exercise strategies that th [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Once awarded {{exclusively}} to upper management, stock options are now granted increasingly to rank-and-file employees and {{are becoming a}} greater component of employee compensation. The expanding use of stock options is undoubtedly {{due in part to}} the large increase in equity prices over the last twenty years. Further fueling the demand was the Internet start-up boom of the late 1990 s, the spectacular financial success of many technology and computer companies, notably Microsoft and Oracle, and the well- publicized lucre acquired by their employees. The collapse of the initial public offerings market for Internet start-up companies at the dawn of the twenty-first century, accompanied by the rapid decline in the stock prices of many companies in technology-related sectors, served to apprise employees that option returns are risky. Microsoft 2 ̆ 7 s recent announcement that it plans to replace its option program with a restricted stock program will undoubtedly cause many companies to reevaluate their use of compensatory options. Nevertheless, it appears that options will continue to be an important part of employee compensation. This Article examines the international tax issues raised by global stock option plans. It first examines the financial reasons for and unique issues raised by granting employees stock options and the U. S. accounting treatment of stock option plans. It then reviews the U. S. and tax treaty rules applicable to holders and issuers of non-qualified stock options and examines the conflicts that arise when a compensatory <b>option</b> <b>holder</b> or <b>option</b> income is subject to the tax jurisdiction of more than one country. Finally, it considers unilateral, bilateral, and multilateral policy options of tax administrators in the face of the global stock option plans. This Article argues that the United States should consider unilaterally amending its foreign tax credit regime to prevent the double taxation of <b>option</b> <b>holders,</b> incorporate <b>option</b> provisions in its income tax treaties, and support the general multilateral approach set forth in the OECD Report...|$|R

Jarrow and Turnbull [6] propose a risk neutral evaluating mechanism of derivative securities exposed to default risk. Klein [7] provides an analytical solution of the European vulnerable option’s price, taking into account the interrelationship between the option writer’s asset and the underlying asset. They also assume that the option writers have other liabilities, and when the counterparty defaults, some of the nominal claims will be paid.|$|R

40|$|How costly is the repriceable {{employee}} {{stock option}} This paper develops an intensity-based model, which reflects the special features of repriceable {{employee stock option}}s (ESOs), to assess their shareholder cost and explore their early exercise pattern. Several numerical analyses are used to examine how single or multiple resetting affects the value of ESOs. Three characteristics of repriceable options are found. First, their value does not monotonically increase {{with the amount of}} reduction of exercise price. Second, multiple resetting increases option value more than does single resetting. Lastly, <b>option</b> <b>holders</b> of repriceable ESOs postpone their exercise before repricing.
