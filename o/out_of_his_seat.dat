5|$|Revenue from tariffs {{was then}} {{a major source of}} income for the federal government. There was no federal income tax, and tariff debates were passionate; the 1888 presidential {{election}} had them as a major issue. Many Democrats supported a tariff for revenue only—that is, the purpose of tariffs should be to finance government, not to encourage American manufacturers. McKinley disagreed with that and sponsored the McKinley Tariff of 1890. This act, passed by the Republican-dominated Congress, raised rates on imports to protect American industry. McKinley's tariff proved unpopular among many people who had to pay the increased prices, and was seen as a reason not only for his defeat for re-election to Congress in 1890, but also for the Republicans losing control of both House and Senate in that year's midterm elections. Nevertheless, McKinley's defeat did not, in the end, damage his political prospects, as the Democrats were blamed for gerrymandering him <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>seat.</b>|$|E
500|$|On {{his return}} Brudenell took {{his seat in}} the House of Commons, {{naturally}} on the ruling, Tory, side of the House. His contribution to government was minimal: he served with parliamentarians, such as Canning, Peel and Castlereagh, of great commitment and intellect and he could offer nothing to compete. On one issue, however, he made a stand. In 1829 his party introduced a bill allowing limited Catholic emancipation but his patron, cousin Charles, instructed him to oppose it. In three crucial votes Brudenell abstained, because of his admiration for Wellington, the bill's sponsor, and in consequence he was thrown <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>seat.</b> His return to parliament in 1830 cost him dearly. After his earlier disobedience he could not expect to be handed a pocket borough so, instead, he had to buy his own. He was elected member for Fowey, Cornwall, {{at a cost of}} at least £5,000 (...)

500|$|Even {{with the}} {{armistice}} in November 1918, the war-related trials continued. The Socialist Party of America, like the IWW, had opposed the war, and {{had also been}} raided by federal authorities. Seven Socialist Party leaders, including Victor Berger, who was elected to Congress in November 1918, were indicted for alleged anti-war activities. The defendants were charged under the Espionage Act of 1917, which made it illegal [...] "to utter, print, write, or publish any disloyal, profane, scurrilous or abusive language" [...] about the armed forces, the flag, the Constitution, or democracy. The defendants, who were mostly of German birth or descent, moved {{for a change of}} venue away from Landis's courtroom, alleging that Landis had stated on November 1, 1918, that [...] "f anybody has said anything about the Germans that is worse than I have said, I would like to hear it so I could use it myself." [...] Landis, however, examined the transcript of the trial in which the statement was supposedly made, failed to find it, declared the affidavit in support of the motion [...] "perjurious", and denied the motion. While the jury was being selected, Berger was indicted on additional espionage charges for supposedly violating the law during an earlier, unsuccessful political campaign. At the conclusion of the case, Landis took an hour to dramatically charge the jury, emphasizing the secretive nature of conspiracies and pointing at the jury box as he noted, [...] "the country was then at war". At one point, Landis leapt <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>seat,</b> twirled his chair around, then sat on its arm. Later in his charge, he lay prone upon the bench. The jury took less than a day to convict Congressman-elect Berger and his four remaining codefendants. Landis sentenced each defendant to twenty years in federal prison. Landis denied the defendants bail pending appeal; but they quickly obtained it from an appellate court judge. [...] The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals declined to rule on the case itself, sending it on to the Supreme Court, which on January 31, 1921, overturned the convictions and sentences by a 6–3 vote, holding that Landis should have stepped aside once he was satisfied that the affidavit was legally sufficient, leaving it for another judge to decide whether it was actually true. Landis refused to comment on the Supreme Court's decision, which ordered a new trial. In 1922, charges against the defendants were dropped by the government.|$|E

Jamie Wallace, in the second car, said that passengers there initially tried to {{come to the aid of}} those in the front car, but [...] "we could not get the head car doors open for some reason, it was jammed." [...] After failed efforts to break the door open, [...] " [...] number of us started smelling fumes from the car, the fuel, and we said, 'You know what, we need to get out.'" ...|$|E

50|$|Thomas Ballantyne Martin (13 November 1901 - 28 January 1995) was a British politician, {{stockbroker}} and journalist. After {{an early}} {{career as a}} private secretary he was unexpectedly elected as a Conservative Member of Parliament in Blaydon, a traditionally extremely secure Labour constituency. After standing up in Parliament for the local mining industry he opted <b>out</b> <b>of</b> defending <b>his</b> <b>seat,</b> and could not find election elsewhere; he then became a political journalist. After wartime service in intelligence, he supported Winston Churchill's attempt to bring European unity and then became a stockbroker. A very clubbable man, he attracted interest in the 1990s as a rare survivor of the pre-Second World War Parliament.|$|R

2500|$|Upon {{hearing this}} {{declaration}} of intent, Fu Huacheng, a passenger and {{the minister of}} education for Lop County, recalled running <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>seat</b> and shouting in Uyghur to his fellow passengers: [...] "Come on! Let's stand up and fight them." [...] Up to six mostly Uyghur plainclothes police responded to Fu's call; microbloggers confirmed witnessing plainclothes policemen removing homemade explosives from the suspects. A group of passengers, led by a local doctor, escorted the elderly and children away from the violence. Some passengers successfully activated the mid-air anti-hijacking contingency plan, which involves pushing a trolley {{in front of the}} cockpit door. A passenger interviewed by the Associated Press confirmed that passengers used their belts to restrain the attackers; witnesses to the hijacking posted bloody pictures of the arrests on Sina Weibo.|$|E
2500|$|The 20/20 Experience was {{produced}} in a span of 20 days. Recording sessions for The 20/20 Experience began in the [...] "late part of May, first week in June" [...] and concluded in July 2012. [...] The album was recorded at EastWest Studios in Los Angeles, Jungle City Studios in New York City and Larrabee Studios in North Hollywood. Of Timbaland's participation, Wright said: [...] "(Their) relationship is like a brotherhood; they're just so comfortable with each other– not only as musical friends but as personal friends... {{that you can get}} things done {{in a short period of}} time. Had (the Affleck movie) not happened, we might have actually set up and put the album out sooner." [...] After recording was finished, Timberlake and Wright, with M2M Construction, begin [...] "formulating plans for how to release the music". Justin Timberlake, and most of the band used JH Audio in-ear monitoring systems. With regards to the album's lead single [...] "Suit & Tie", Timberlake shared with 97.1 AMP Radio/Los Angeles how the classic, [...] "Get out your seat, Hov" [...] lyric was born inside the studio with JAY-Z: [...] "I had finished the verses and I was going in to record them and he was sitting in the room working, freestyling to himself. And then he came up with a line he really liked and he jumped <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>seat</b> and he said, 'Uh oh! Get out of that seat, Hov.' And I just thought it was so funny. It made me laugh. I was standing right beside him when he did it and so I just put it on the record, more or less as a joke to him." [...] Timberlake added that the song harkens back to the glory years of the Rat Pack. [...] "Not to compare ourselves to those guys, but just the fun that they had," [...] he said. [...] "I was picturing like, being at the Sands in Vegas and saying, 'Oh, JAY-Z's in the house tonight. Uh, let's have him come up and do a number. Why don't you go ahead and get out of your seat, Hov?' That's more or less where it came from." ...|$|E

60|$|There {{is no need}} to go {{over the}} twenty-times-told tale of an election. I rescued the borough of Tippleton from the hands of Lord Tiptoff and his son, Lord George. I had a savage sort of satisfaction, too, in forcing my wife (who had been at one time {{exceedingly}} smitten by her kinsman, as I have already related) to take part against him, and to wear and distribute my colours when the day of election came. And when we spoke at one another, I told the crowd that I had beaten Lord George in love, that I had beaten him in war, and that I would now beat him in Parliament; and so I did, as the event proved: for, to the inexpressible anger of the old Marquess, Barry Lyndon, Esquire, was returned member of Parliament for Tippleton, in place of John Rigby, Esquire, deceased; and I threatened him at the next election to turn him <b>out</b> <b>of</b> BOTH <b>his</b> <b>seats,</b> and went to attend my duties in Parliament.|$|R

Several months later, in New York, in conversation with Mrs. Luna, of whom he was destined to see a good deal, he alluded by chance to this repast, to the way her sister had placed him at table, and to the remark with which she had pointed <b>out</b> the advantage <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>seat.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Because driver's hatch {{was moved}} from the glacis plate and {{positioned}} so that he exited the vehicle perpendicularly instead <b>of</b> crawling <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the hatch, <b>his</b> <b>seat</b> received an elevating mechanism.

While in combat the driver lowered <b>his</b> <b>seat</b> back into the tank and {{had to rely on}} the vision slot protected by [...] (three-layer glass). While in this position the pedals of the main clutch, the fuel supply, and incline brake were positioned much higher and the levers of the steering clutch and gear shifting became inconvenient to operate. Early examples had transmission problems. While the driver was switching gears, two gears could engage simultaneously, which caused a broken gear pinion. This and other gearbox related problems were solved in a 1961 T-44M modernization with the introduction of a gearbox from the T-54 main battle tank.|$|R

He gently tried to move her; but it was not possible. Nan knew how to meet the ridicule of half a dozen old lovers.

40|$|Effective dosages for enzyme {{replacement}} therapy (ERT) in Pompe disease {{are much higher}} than for other lysosomal storage disorders, which {{has been attributed to}} low cation-independent mannose- 6 -phosphate receptor (CI-MPR) in skeletal muscle. We have previously demonstrated the benefit of increased CI-MPR-mediated uptake of recombinant human acid-α-glucosidase during ERT in mice with Pompe disease following addition of albuterol therapy. Currently we have completed a pilot study of albuterol in patients with late-onset Pompe disease already on ERT for > 2 yr, who were not improving further. The 6 -min walk test (6 MWT) distance increased in all 7 subjects at wk 6 (30 ± 13 m; P= 0. 002), wk 12 (34 ± 14 m; P= 0. 004), and wk 24 (42 ± 37 m; P= 0. 02), in comparison with baseline. Grip strength was improved significantly for both hands at wk 12. Furthermore, individual subjects reported benefits; e. g., a female patient could stand up from sitting on the floor much more easily (time for supine to standing position decreased from 30 to 11 s), and a male patient could readily swing <b>his</b> legs <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> van <b>seat</b> (hip abduction increased from 1 to 2 + on manual muscle testing). Finally, analysis of the quadriceps biopsies suggested increased CI-MPR at wk 12 (P= 0. 08), compared with baseline. With the exception of 1 patient who succumbed to respiratory complications of Pompe disease in the first week, only mild adverse events have been reported, including tremor, transient difficulty falling asleep, and mild urinary retention (requiring early morning voiding). Therefore, this pilot study revealed initial safety and efficacy in an open label study of adjunctive albuterol therapy in patients with late-onset Pompe disease who had been stable on ERT with no improvements noted over the previous several years...|$|R
50|$|In 1581 Howison was {{a member}} of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. There he objected, along with others, to the King’s {{appointment}} as the new Archbishop of Glasgow of The Minister of Stirling Robert Montgomery. He objected on principal, claiming Bishops were against the Word of God but he claimed that Mr Montgomery was an unfit person to lead Christians. The King nonetheless ordered the Church to accept him as Archbishop. On 8 June 1582 Montgomery entered into Glasgow Cathedral to claim his see. By this time Howison was Moderator of the Presbytery of Glasgow which was at that time meeting in the Cathedral. Howison demonstrated his opposition to the entry of the new archbishop by climbing into the pulpit and beginning to preach before the archbishop arrived. The archbishop arrived to claim the pulpit, accompanied by the Lord Provost of Glasgow Sir Mathew Stewart of Minto - one of Howison’s own Cambuslang Parishioners - and other leading citizens. There was a stand-off. Sir Mathew ordered Howison <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the pulpit and in response Howison called upon Minto in the name of God to do nothing to disturb the peace. Some rough handling ensued and Howison was dragged - apparently by the beard - from the pulpit and had some <b>of</b> <b>his</b> teeth knocked <b>out.</b> He was then taken to the Trongate - the town gaol. Some armed students tried to rescue him, but they were bloodily put down. The Church responded by excommunicating Archbishop Montgomery. Howison was released from prison after three days. The General Assembly, meeting later that month also tried to excommunicate the Lord Provost <b>of</b> Glasgow and <b>his</b> supporters. These did not bother to appear to their answer charges and the King called the case to his own Council, meeting at Perth on 6 July. The Assembly sent a letter to the King complaining of many things including “the violent drawing of Mr John Howison <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> judgement <b>seat</b> where he was placed as Moderator <b>of</b> the Presbytery, <b>his</b> cruel and outrageous handling and carrying to prison like a thief by the bailies of Glasgow…” After some manoeuvring Sir Mathew submitted to the Assembly. The Assembly then demanded that those who had perpetrated the “unaccustomed violence against Mr Howison” should be “sua punischt that nane hereafter be bald to attempt the lyke” (sic). However, the King had meanwhile been abducted by rebel nobles in the so-called Ruthven Raid. He subsequently escaped, but the escapade meant that no notice was taken of the Church’s complaints.|$|R
