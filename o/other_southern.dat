5|$|The {{preservation}} of oral history may {{be achieved through}} musical performance in Madagascar. Among the Betsileo, for instance, oral histories are retold through a form of musical performance called the rija, which {{in its current form}} may represent a combination of the original, single-verse rija and an epic poem called the isa. The Betsileo rija is performed by two men who each play a jejy while singing very loudly with a strained pitch in the soprano range. The structure of the song is complex and, unlike other Malagasy musical styles, parallel thirds are not predominant in the harmony. <b>Other</b> <b>Southern</b> ethnic groups also perform simplified variations of the rija featuring for example a solo musician who strums rather than fiddles his accompanying instrument and sings at a lower, more natural pitch. While the Betsileo rija can address diverse themes, those performed by <b>other</b> <b>southern</b> groups are almost always praise songs recalling a favorably memorable event.|$|E
5|$|A North–South divide {{remains in}} {{education}} at all levels. There {{is a significant}} attainment gap between Northern and Southern schools, even after controlling for the economic difference across the country, and pupils in the three Northern regions {{are less likely than}} the national average to achieve five higher-tier GCSEs. Northern students are under-represented at Oxbridge, where three times as many places go to Southerners as to Northerners, and <b>other</b> <b>Southern</b> universities while Southerners are under-represented at leading Northern universities such as Sheffield, Manchester and Leeds.|$|E

5|$|In 1911, Coolbrith {{accepted}} {{the presidency of}} the Pacific Coast Woman's Press Association, and a park was dedicated to her, at 1715 Taylor Street, one block from her pre-earthquake home. Coolbrith was named honorary member of the California Writers Club around 1913, a group that quickly expanded to include Lummis and <b>other</b> <b>Southern</b> Californians. In 1913, Ella Sterling Mighels founded the California Literature Society which met informally once a month at Coolbrith's Russian Hill home, newspaper columnist and literary critic George Hamlin Fitch presiding. Mighels, who has been called California's literary historian, credited her breadth of knowledge to Coolbrith and the society meetings.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, it {{was also}} {{recorded}} from the cave of Ankilitelo in southwestern Madagascar. Remains of a large Macrotarsomys had previously been reported from <b>other</b> <b>southern</b> Madagascar sites, and {{at least some of}} these may be M.petteri. A karstic deposit near Lake Tsimanampetsotsa (dated to the Late Pliocene or Early Pleistocene on unclear grounds) contained three species of Macrotarsomys, including a very large one that may well be M.petteri. Remains identified as greater big-footed mouse have been reported from a cave at Ankazoabo in southern Madagascar; these may also be Petter's big-footed mouse.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, {{the lake}} began being {{filled with water}} {{provided}} by the Inland Feeder after nearly two years without a source. The water replenished much of what was lost after drought conditions required the MWD {{to tap into the}} lake. Water from the Colorado River Aqueduct is not being used due to the threat of the Quagga mussel, an invasive species that has already contaminated <b>other</b> <b>Southern</b> California lakes served by the aqueduct.|$|E

5|$|In March 1949, British Railways {{ordered a}} final 20 from Brighton works despite a {{pressing}} need for smaller tank locomotives. This imbalance was rectified by building forty-one {{examples of the}} LMS Fairburn 2-6-4T for the Southern Region. Also at this time Brighton works staff were embroiled in the difficulties associated with Bulleid's experimental and problematic Leader class. As a result, Brighton sought assistance from the <b>other</b> <b>Southern</b> Region works to complete this final order. Ashford works cut the frames and constructed the tenders, and Eastleigh works constructed six of the final batch of locomotives.|$|E
5|$|In the end, Kennedy {{managed to}} amend the renewal of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 to include {{provisions}} for a national survey on nutrition. Stennis was so embarrassed by the hearings that he proposed a $10 million emergency fund be established for food and medical services. Despite resistance from <b>other</b> <b>Southern</b> legislators {{and a lack of}} support from President Johnson, Stennis' bill passed. The Senate also voted unanimously to create a Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs. The Poverty Subcommittee held further field hearings across the country as part of its work.|$|E
5|$|Isotope {{analysis}} of the remains revealed that while the bones had δ13C values that were typical of those found at many <b>other</b> <b>southern</b> British Neolithic sites, they had significantly higher values of δ15N, which grew over time. Although this data is difficult to interpret, the investigative team believed that it probably reflected that these individuals had had a terrestrial diet high in animal protein that over time was increasingly supplemented with freshwater river or estuarine foods. In {{the case of the}} older individuals whose remains were interned in the tomb, the tooth enamel was worn away and the dentine had become exposed on the chewing area of the crowns.|$|E

5|$|Many Southerners {{believed}} his warnings and read every political news {{story from the}} North as {{further evidence of the}} planned destruction of the white southern way of life. The climax came a decade after Calhoun's death with the election of Republican Abraham Lincoln in 1860, which led to the secession of South Carolina, followed by six <b>other</b> <b>Southern</b> states. They formed the new Confederate States, which, in accordance with Calhoun's theory, did not have any organized political parties.|$|E
5|$|Nathan Bedford Forrest (1821–77) and Alexander P. Stewart (1821–1908) {{trained at}} Fort Wright. Other future {{leaders in the}} Army of Tennessee and Forrest's cavalry {{received}} training at Fort Wright. The fort was Tennessee's first military training camp. Fort Wright was the forwardmost defensive position on the Mississippi River until July 1861, it was abandoned by the Confederate infantry by 1862 but sporadically occupied by <b>other</b> <b>southern</b> forces during the Civil War. In 2008, only a powder magazine is left of Fort Wright.|$|E

5|$|The creek's use as {{a tribal}} {{boundary}} is disputed. As <b>other</b> <b>southern</b> California Native Americans have done, a tribe typically claimed {{both sides of a}} stream or river—and used drainage divides as boundaries instead. However, the presence of Aliso Canyon, a steep and difficult-to-traverse gorge, suggests the opposite. Kroeber (1907) was the first to support this theory, and many other archaeologists have followed as well. The Juaneño disagree, arguing that their boundary stretches north to the northern drainage divide of the Aliso Creek watershed, which supports the practice of claiming both sides of a stream.|$|E
5|$|The latter mode {{actually}} is reserved specifically for solo agung contest.

Tidto is prefect for such contest since the agung is often the focus of attention, the focal point during the ensemble during this mode. Players normally perform two or more versions playing the three types of techniques discussed above.|$|E
5|$|The {{most widely}} {{accepted}} theory {{about the origin of}} cricket is that it first developed in early medieval times to the south and south-east of London in the geographical areas of the North Downs, the South Downs and the Weald. The counties of Kent, Sussex and Surrey were therefore the earliest centres of excellence and it was from here that the game reached London, where its lasting popularity was ensured, and <b>other</b> <b>southern</b> counties like Berkshire, Essex, Hampshire and Middlesex. As early as c.1611, a cricket match was recorded at Chevening in Kent between teams representing the Downs and the Weald.|$|E

5|$|Argentina, {{like many}} other countries, entered into a {{recession}} following the beginning of World War I as international flows of goods, capital and labour declined. Foreign investment in Argentina came to a complete standstill from which it never fully recovered: Great Britain had become heavily indebted to the United States {{during the war and}} would never again export capital at a comparable scale. And after the opening of the Panama canal in 1914, Argentina and the <b>other</b> <b>Southern</b> cone economies declined, as investors turned their attention to Asia and the Caribbean. The United States, which came out of the war a political and financial superpower, especially perceived Argentina (and to a lesser extent Brazil) as a potential rival on world markets. Neither the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange nor the private domestic banks developed rapidly enough to fully replace British capital.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of a}} {{study on}} adaptation, 57 rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) were {{introduced}} to the island of Desecheo and <b>other</b> <b>southern</b> off-shore islands and cays in 1967. Prior to the introduction, Desecheo was the largest nesting colony of the brown booby, but mainly as a result of egg predation by the introduced macaques, no bird species presently nests in the island. Efforts to trap and remove the species have been unsuccessful and it has expanded its range to southwestern Puerto Rico. Other primates also have established populations in Puerto Rico. As a result of vandalism, 107 squirrel monkeys escaped from a research station at Sabana Seca in the late 1970s. The latest estimate for this population is 35 individuals.|$|E
5|$|Before {{contact with}} Christian missionaries during both the Dutch and Qing periods, Taiwanese aborigines held {{a variety of}} beliefs in spirits, gods, sacred symbols and myths that helped their {{societies}} find meaning and order. Although {{there is no evidence}} of a unified belief system shared among the various indigenous groups, there is evidence that several groups held supernatural beliefs in certain birds and bird behavior. The Siraya were reported by Dutch sources to incorporate bird imagery into their material culture. Other reports describe animal skulls and the use of human heads in societal beliefs. The Paiwan and <b>other</b> <b>southern</b> groups worship the Formosan hundred pacer snake and use the diamond patterns on its back in many designs. In many Plains Aborigines societies, the power to communicate with the supernatural world was exclusively held by women called Inibs. During the period of Dutch colonization, the Inibs were removed from the villages to eliminate their influence and pave the way for Dutch missionary work...|$|E
