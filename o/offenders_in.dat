5|$|Black's {{contact in}} the Seattle Police Department, Bob Bletcher (Bill Smitrovich), insists that Black should not get {{involved}} in the case as he is too close to the victims. However, Black insists he can be of assistance, and reviews security footage of a stranger investigating Tom's luggage after their flight. Bletcher reports that a stolen car has been found abandoned, with Helen's blood inside. Fellow Millennium Group member Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) helps Black identify the kidnapper from a set pictures of sex <b>offenders</b> <b>in</b> the Seattle area—Black recognizes Richard Green (Dylan Haggerty) as the man from the airport footage.|$|E

5|$|After the fight, the purses {{for both}} fighters were {{withheld}} until {{video of the}} fight could be reviewed. Don King argued that Mayweather should have been disqualified because his uncle {{was the first person}} to enter the ring. At an April 13 hearing, the Nevada State Athletic Commission fined Roger Mayweather $200,000 and revoked his boxing license for one year. At a hearing on May 8, the Commission disciplined the other <b>offenders</b> <b>in</b> the melee. It fined Yoel Judah $100,000 and revoked his license for one year, fined Mayweather cornerman Leonard Ellerbe $50,000 and suspended his license for four months, and fined Zab Judah $350,000 and revoked his license for one year.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge {{pressed to}} reform the state's {{criminal}} code, {{which was based on}} the English system and imposed the death penalty for over 200 different crimes. Inspired by Thomas Jefferson's failed attempt to reform Virginia's code, he first asked the Lexington Democratic Society to study ways to make punishments more proportional to crimes in November 1793. By 1796, he was drafting a new code based on the principles that criminals should be rehabilitated, victims should be compensated for their injury, the public should be reimbursed for the cost of prosecuting the criminal, and the punishment's severity should serve as a deterrent for would-be <b>offenders.</b> <b>In</b> January 1798, he introduced his proposed code in the General Assembly. A month later, the Assembly reformed the code, abolishing the death penalty for every crime except first-degree murder.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days of the inquiry, the Portuguese police searched through images seized from {{paedophile}} investigations, and Madeleine's parents were shown photographs of sex <b>offenders</b> <b>in</b> case they recognized them from Praia de Luz. Several British paedophiles were of interest. In May 2009 investigators working for the McCanns tried to question one, Raymond Hewlett; he had allegedly told someone he knew what happened to Madeleine, but he retracted and died of cancer in Germany in December that year. Scotland Yard made inquiries about two paedophiles who have been in jail in Scotland since 2010 for murder. The men were running a window-cleaning service in the Canary Islands when Madeleine went missing.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{taking office}} in January 1999, he {{immediately}} replaced two top officials, and {{one-third of the}} remaining staff were replaced or left voluntarily. Press reports criticized the move as overly political and aggressive, particularly as it affected ongoing trials. In his first year, he founded the Norfolk Anti-Crime Council, a 35-member forum for judicial officers, police, and other local parties to discuss and co-ordinate anti-crime strategies. He established a pilot program for a drug court under Quincy District Court, which would provide an alternative sentencing pathway for nonviolent drug <b>offenders,</b> <b>in</b> {{an effort to reduce}} court backlogs and lower recidivism rates. He also expanded his office's juvenile crime unit. In late 2000 he laid the groundwork for the Norfolk Country Children's Advocacy Center, based on similar programs in Middlesex and Suffolk counties, and it was fully established the following year. Keating's office also began an anti-bullying program in spring 2001. In 2002, his office was the first in Massachusetts to win a murder conviction in a case that lacked a victim's body.|$|E

Furthermore, {{while the number}} of sentenced violent <b>offenders</b> <b>in</b> state prison increased from 2000 through 2008, the expected length of stays for these offenders declined slightly during this period.|$|E
