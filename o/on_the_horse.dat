5|$|Rarely, Banai {{also appears}} in Khandoba's chief legend where he slays the demons Mani and Malla. Mhalsa and Banai (or Ganga) futilely help Khandoba {{in the battle}} to collect the blood of Mani, every drop of which was {{creating}} a new demon. Finally, the dog of Khandoba swallows all the blood. Rarely, Banai is described as seated behind Khandoba <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> and fighting with a sword or spear, a role generally assigned to Mhalsa.|$|E

On the night of 18/19 September, the 4th and 5th Cavalry Divisions moved forward behind the infantry, while the Australian Mounted Division moved up to Sarona. Here the three divisions concentrated, with their supplies carried in massed horse-drawn transport and on long camel trains, clogging the roads. The divisions carried one iron ration and two days' special emergency rations per man, and 21 pounds (9.5kg) of grain per horse, all carried <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>horse,</b> with an additional day's grain per horse carried on the first line transport limbered wagons.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> {{decorated}} <b>horses</b> {{were originally}} those for Shinto priests (kannushi), twelve in number,　and in the Hosokawa clan period, only upper-class samurai families presented <b>horses.</b> <b>The</b> {{distance from the}} shrine to the otabisho (destination of　the parade) was short, and kannushi did not ride <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>horses.</b> Therefore, <b>the</b> decorations <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> became gradually gala and greater. <b>The</b> decorations <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> were originally from the symbols of sexual organs.

5|$|From the 1950s onwards, {{stories about}} Brown were often {{included}} in local {{histories of the}} southeast of South Australia. Examples include Elma Smith's History of Kingston published in 1950, and Kingston Flashback written by local historian Verne McLaren and published in 1970. In Smith's version, the original crime was not discussed, and the focus was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> ride to Adelaide, and McLaren's account split the legend into two, one about a poisoning by Brown, and another in which Brown and an accomplice cornered Aboriginal people in the Papineau caves, smoked them out and shot them. The second of McLaren's stories ended with Brown's famous ride to Adelaide {{to report to the}} police. Another account was included in Barry Durman's A History of the Baker's Range Settlement, published in 1978. Durman reproduced a newspaper article about the investigation into Brown's involvement in the murders, passed over the manner by which the murders were carried out and stated that the case was not proven, and then told of a wonderful feat of horsemanship by Brown.|$|E
5|$|Oral stories {{continue}} {{the process of}} Sanskritization of Khandoba— his elevation from a folk deity to Shiva, a deity of the classical Hindu pantheon— that was initiated by the texts. Khandoba's wives Mhalsa and Banai are also identified with Shiva's classical Hindu wives Parvati and Ganga. Hegadi Pradhan, the minister and brother-in-law of Khandoba and brother of Lingavat Vani Mhalsa, the faithful dog that helps Khandoba kill the demons, the horse given by Mani and the demon brothers are considered avatars of Vishnu, Krishna, Nandi and the demons Madhu-Kaitabha respectively. Other myth variants narrate that Khandoba defeats a single demon named Manimalla, who offers his white horse, sometimes called Mani, to the god. Other legends depict Mhalsa (or Parvati) and Banai or Banu (or Ganga) as futilely helping Khandoba in the battle to collect the blood of Mani, every drop of which was creating a new demon. Finally, the dog of Khandoba swallows all the blood. Sometimes, Mhalsa, or rarely Banai, is described as seated behind Khandoba <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> and fighting with a sword or spear.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} the initial silver rush, a town site was platted {{and the town}} was built. The first permanent business building established in Silver Reef was a store {{at the intersection of}} the roads from the Buckeye, White, and East reefs. By 1878, the town's business district consisted of a hotel, boarding houses, nine stores, six saloons, five restaurants, a bank, two dance halls, a newspaper called The Silver Echo (which later became the Silver Reef Miner), and eight dry goods stores. Two cemeteries, one Catholic and one Protestant, were located south of Silver Reef's business district. Most of the businesses in Silver Reef were situated along a mile-long Main Street. The mining district consisted of 37 mines and five stamp mills: the Christy, Stormont, Leeds, Buckeye and Barbee & Walker mills. Although it was surrounded by settlements with large Mormon populations, the town never had a Mormon meeting house. A Catholic church was the only church located within the town. After the First Transcontinental Railroad was completed in 1869, many of the Chinese workers who had been hired to build it were out of work. Some returned to China, but others remained in Utah. A group of 250 of these workers set up a Chinatown in a level area just south of Silver Reef. Silver Reef's Chinatown had a Chinese mayor and several businesses. By 1879, Silver Reef's population had reached 2,000, and the town also had a horse race track, a brewery, and a brass band. Shooting matches among members of the Silver Reef Rifle Club and sometimes residents of nearby towns took place <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> race track.|$|E
50|$|A chambon {{prevents}} <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> from raising {{its head}} beyond a fixed point. Raising the head causes {{the length of}} the chambon along the cheekpieces to shorten and thus puts reciprocal pressure <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>horse's</b> mouth and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>horse's</b> poll. Horses generally dislike pressure behind the poll and learn to release the pressure by lowering their head, and when in motion, this encourages <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> to relax its back and bring its hindquarters further under its body, thus encouraging collection.The chambon has the opposite function to an overcheck or bearing rein, which is used to raise <b>the</b> <b>horse's</b> head.|$|R

5|$|The {{game was}} envisioned {{to improve the}} core {{mechanics}} of Red Dead Revolver (2004), to which Redemption is a spiritual successor, by scaling {{it up to the}} standard of other Rockstar games. The fundamental goal for the game was to maintain the shooting mechanic and expand on other game features; like Revolver, the game's weapons were inspired by real weaponry. Carson explained that the team attempted to achieve realism with every feature of the game, including the horses, lassos, animal ecosystem, and the open world. To assure that the horse movements were as realistic as possible, the team motion captured a stunt horse, recording all movement. This created various problems; a gesture used by the stunt rider to communicate with the production team while <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> was also the same command that made the horse rear. Furthermore, creating the horse's skeletal and muscular systems also presented a problem, and took several years to overcome. In the early stages of development, Rockstar decided which elements from Red Dead Revolver could be carried over; beyond the Dead Eye feature and the Western setting, very few other features remained. While Revolver represented many myths and iconic images of the American frontier, in Redemption the team tried to represent the reality of the time period. The tone of Redemption was aimed to be a combination of the primitive Wild West and early 20th century America; with the latter, America was developing into a modern and contemporary society, which the team tried to portray. In addition, while they felt that Revolver was constrained by its level-based structure, the team saw potential in creating a game similar to that of Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto series, in terms of quality, scope and detail.|$|E

25|$|Other {{forms of}} {{equipment}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> included long-necked spurs which enabled the rider {{to control the}} horse with extended legs, a saddle with a high back to provide leverage during the charge or when hit, as well as stirrups for the necessary leverage to deliver blows with the lance (Tkačenko).|$|E

25|$|To {{shorten the}} horse's stride, the rider sits taller and lengthens the spine. He or she also {{performs}} multiple half-halts in rhythm with the horse's strides, using the restraining aids {{to ask the}} horse to engage the hindquarters, yet keeping the leg to the horse's sides to keep impulsion. The rider should not hold the aids or hang onto the horse's mouth when shortening. If the rider does not keep sufficient leg <b>on,</b> <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> will simply fall onto the forehand or break into the trot or walk.|$|E
25|$|Cleaning is an {{important}} part of caring for tack. Tack that is not cleaned will start to build up sweat and dirt, which will cause uncomfortable rubbing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>horse.</b> Sweat and dirt also tend to cause cracking in leather, which may result in breaking. This not only decreases the value of the saddle, but can be very dangerous if critical equipment, such as a stirrup leather, breaks mid-ride. Proper care and conditioning of the saddle will not only increase its useful life, but will also help to retain its value.|$|E

25|$|Jumping {{is a very}} strenuous {{activity}} that places high physical demands <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>horse.</b> The primary stresses affect the suspensory apparatuses of the hind legs during take-off and the forelegs during landing, though the galloping and turning associated with jumping also place torque on the joints. Most injuries, chronic or acute, begin with strain; as structures in the horse's body absorb the shock of take-off and landing, they acquire small amounts of damage. Over time, this damage leads to inflammation of the tendons (tendinitis) and ligaments (desmitis). The most common injuries in the forelimb occur to the interosseous ligaments and the superficial digital flexor tendons and less commonly, the accessory ligament of the deep digital flexor tendon. Strain on the superficial digital flexors is greater when jumping higher fences, so horses {{may no longer be}} suitable for competitive jumping after damaging that apparatus.|$|E
