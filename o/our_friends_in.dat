5|$|The first {{director}} approached to helm the production by Michael Wearing was Danny Boyle. Boyle was keen to direct all nine episodes, but Pattinson believed that one director {{taking charge of}} the entire serial would be too punishing a schedule for whomever was chosen. Boyle had recently completed work on the feature film Shallow Grave and {{wanted to see how}} that film was received before committing to <b>Our</b> <b>Friends</b> <b>in</b> the North. When Shallow Grave proved to be a critical success, Boyle was able to enter pre-production on Trainspotting. He withdrew from <b>Our</b> <b>Friends</b> <b>in</b> the North. Sir Peter Hall was also briefly considered, but he too had other production commitments.|$|E
5|$|The {{first episode}} of <b>Our</b> <b>Friends</b> <b>in</b> the North gained 5.1 million viewers on its {{original}} transmission, {{and the first}} six episodes each gained between 4.5 and 5.5 million viewers. In terms of viewing figures, the series became BBC Two's most successful weekly drama for five years.|$|E
6000|$|... "Have we {{the right}} to allow {{ourselves}} the luxury, of private feelings in a matter which concerns the national expansion. We must not give way to sentiment. <b>Our</b> <b>friend</b> <b>in</b> {{the body of the}} hall spoke--he will forgive me for saying so--like a poet, rather than a serious reformer. I am afraid that if we let ourselves drop into poetry, the birth rate of this country will very soon drop into poetry too. And that I think it is impossible for us to contemplate with folded hands. The resolution I was about to propose when <b>our</b> <b>friend</b> <b>in</b> the body of the hall----" ...|$|R

50|$|In 2009 they {{released}} two Extended plays: Me Vs Hero EP in January and This One's for <b>Our</b> <b>Friend</b> <b>In</b> December. The band toured with several bands that year, completing a co-headline tour with Paige in March, festival appearances at Slam Dunk and Sonisphere.|$|R
5|$|The {{scale of}} <b>Our</b> <b>Friends</b> <b>in</b> the North {{required}} BBC Two controller Michael Jackson to devote {{a budget of}} £8 million to the production, which was half of his channel's drama serials budget for the entire year. Producer Charles Pattinson attempted to gain co-production funding from overseas broadcasters, but none was interested. Pattinson believed {{it was because the}} story was so much about Britain and had limited appeal to other countries. BBC Worldwide, the corporation's commercial arm which sells its programmes overseas, offered only £20,000 of funding towards the production. The speaking cast of <b>Our</b> <b>Friends</b> <b>in</b> the North numbered 160; more than 3,000 extras were used, and filming took place across 40 weeks, from November 1994 until September 1995.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{budgetary}} constraints, {{the production}} {{was not able}} to shoot the remounted scenes of episode one in the north-east, and they instead had to be filmed in and around Watford. Beach-set scenes were shot at Folkestone rather than Whitley Bay, which was obvious to locals on screen due to the presence of pebbles on the beach, which are not present at Whitley. This led to some critics mockingly referring to the production as <b>Our</b> <b>Friends</b> <b>in</b> the South.|$|E
5|$|<b>Our</b> <b>Friends</b> <b>in</b> the North was {{broadcast}} in nine episodes on BBC Two at 9pm on Monday nights, from 15 January to 11 March 1996. The episode lengths varied, with 1966 being the shortest at 63 minutes, 48 seconds and 1987 the longest at 74 minutes, 40 seconds. The total running {{time of the}} serial is 623 minutes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Mrs. MacHugh, a {{policeman}} in mufti down at Nuncombe! I wonder what <b>our</b> <b>friend</b> <b>in</b> the Close here will think about it! I have always said, you know, {{that if she}} wanted to keep things straight at Nuncombe, she should have opened her purse-strings." ...|$|R
6000|$|And at {{that word}} of fear I rose and invited my {{companion}} to return toward the town.

5|$|<b>Our</b> <b>Friends</b> <b>in</b> the North was {{originally}} {{written by the}} playwright Peter Flannery for the theatre, {{while he was a}} writer in residence for the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC). The idea came to Flannery while he was watching the rehearsals for the company's production of Henry IV, Part 1 and Part 2 at Stratford-upon-Avon in 1980; the scale of the plays inspired him to come up with his own historical epic. The original three-hour long theatre version of <b>Our</b> <b>Friends</b> <b>in</b> the North, directed by John Caird and featuring Jim Broadbent and Roger Allam among the cast, was produced by the RSC in 1982. It initially ran for a week at The Other Place in Stratford before touring to the city in which it was set, Newcastle upon Tyne, and then playing at The Pit, a studio theatre in the Barbican Centre in London. In its original form, the story went up only to the 1979 general election and the coming to power of the new Conservative government under Margaret Thatcher. The play also contained a significant number of scenes set in Rhodesia, chronicling UDI, the oil embargo and the emergence of armed resistance to white supremacy. This plot strand was dropped from the televised version, although the title <b>Our</b> <b>Friends</b> <b>in</b> the North, a reference to how staff at BP in South Africa referred to the Rhodesian government of Ian Smith, remained.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of a}} {{drive to}} reduce media {{centralisation}} in London, the BBC and ITV have moved much of their program production to MediaCityUK in Salford. Of the four national evening soap operas, three are set and filmed in Northern England (Coronation Street in Manchester, Emmerdale in the Yorkshire Dales and Hollyoaks in Chester) and these {{are important to the}} local TV industry – the commitment to Emmerdale saved ITV Yorkshire's Leeds Studios from closure. The region also has a reputation for drama serials and has produced some the most successful and acclaimed series of recent decades, including Boys from the Blackstuff, <b>Our</b> <b>Friends</b> <b>in</b> the North, Clocking Off, Shameless and Last Tango in Halifax.|$|E
5|$|Daniel Craig was a late auditionee for {{the role}} of Geordie. At the audition, he {{performed}} the Geordie accent very poorly, however, he won the part and it came to be regarded as his breakthrough role. Mark Strong worked on the Geordie accent by studying episodes of the 1980s comedy series Auf Wiedersehen, Pet, which featured lead characters from Newcastle. Strong later claimed that Christopher Eccleston took a dislike to him, and outside of their scenes together, the pair did not speak for the entire period that <b>Our</b> <b>Friends</b> <b>in</b> the North was filming.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{know what}} <b>our</b> <b>friend</b> said <b>in</b> that Russian {{manuscript}} I lent you," [...] he reminded her: [...] "'The primitive laws {{are for the}} primitive world.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "`Manuela!' he said, in a low, tremulous voice, `if Mariquita {{is alive}} I see her now. I see <b>our</b> <b>friend</b> Pedro <b>in</b> every line of her pretty face.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you suppose}} that I {{want to win}} money of you?" [...] he once said to <b>our</b> <b>friend,</b> <b>in</b> answer to a little {{proposition}} that was made to him at Newmarket. [...] "I don't suppose you do," [...] George had answered. [...] "Then you may be sure that I don't want to lose any," [...] the Earl had replied. And so the matter was ended, and George made no more propositions of the kind.|$|R
5|$|It was Daniel Craig's {{performance}} in <b>Our</b> <b>Friends</b> <b>in</b> the North that first {{brought him to}} the attention of producer Barbara Broccoli, who later cast him in the role of secret agent James Bond in the long-running film series. Christopher Eccleston also later went on to achieve notoriety in a cult screen role when he appeared as the Ninth Doctor in the BBC science-fiction series Doctor Who in 2005. Since then various media articles have noted the coincidence of the future James Bond and Doctor Who leads having co-starred in the same production earlier in their careers.|$|E
5|$|<b>Our</b> <b>Friends</b> <b>in</b> the North {{helped to}} {{establish}} the careers of its four lead actors, Daniel Craig, Christopher Eccleston, Gina McKee and Mark Strong. Daniel Craig's part in particular {{has been referred to}} as his breakthrough role. It was also a controversial production, as its stories were partly based on real people and events. Several years passed before it was adapted from a play, performed by the Royal Shakespeare Company, to a television drama, {{due in part to the}} BBC's fear of litigation.|$|E
5|$|<b>Our</b> <b>Friends</b> <b>in</b> the North is a British {{television}} drama serial {{produced by}} the BBC. It was originally broadcast in nine episodes on BBC Two in early 1996. Written by Peter Flannery, it {{tells the story of}} four friends from the city of Newcastle upon Tyne in North East England over a period of 31 years, from 1964 to 1995. The story makes reference to certain political and social events which occurred during the era portrayed, some specific to Newcastle and others which affected Britain as a whole. These events include general elections, police and local government corruption, the UK miners' strike (1984–1985) and the Great Storm of 1987.|$|E

5|$|Producer Michael Wearing {{had worked}} on Play for Today {{for which he had}} {{produced}} Alan Bleasdale's The Black Stuff (1978) and which he and Bleasdale subsequently spun off into the highly acclaimed Boys from the Blackstuff (1982). He also produced the conspiracy thriller Bird of Prey (1982). Following Edge of Darkness he continued to be one of British television's most high profile and successful producers, appointed Head of Serials at the BBC between 1989 and 1998 where he was responsible for such programmes as Pride and Prejudice (1995), <b>Our</b> <b>Friends</b> <b>in</b> the North (1996) and Dennis Potter's final two plays Karaoke (1996) and Cold Lazarus (1996).|$|E
5|$|This is not {{the world}} of Ally McBeal. It is not about finding love remedially. This is {{a world in which}} too many of us are asking what use is love if you find it too late. Yet somehow, {{probably}} because the moral judgments are lightly made, superannuated singletons such as myself can look on and see an advertisement for, rather than a warning against, that famously honourable estate—just as we do when we gaze at the more benign marriages of <b>our</b> <b>friends.</b> <b>In</b> Vanity Fair, Thackeray deliberately wrote a novel without a hero. We respond to Cold Feet because it, on the contrary, does not despise its characters.|$|E
25|$|Its {{charting}} {{coincided with}} its usage {{at the end}} of the final episode of the BBC television drama <b>Our</b> <b>Friends</b> <b>in</b> the North, which, upon production, used the track without knowledge it was going to be released as a single.|$|E

60|$|He {{proposed}} a theater, and we accordingly {{made our way}} toward the Strand. <b>Our</b> <b>friend,</b> <b>in</b> {{closing the door behind}} him, said he could not tell us what a relief it was to get away from those children. He said he loved children very much indeed, but that {{it was a mistake to}} have too much of anything, however much you liked it, and that he had come to the conclusion that twenty-two hours a day of them was enough for any one.|$|R
