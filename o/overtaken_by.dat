5|$|Andretti {{found little}} success after 1978 in Formula One– {{he failed to}} win another grand prix.

The acceleration and the simultaneous thinning of services between Emmerich and Wesel {{reduced the number}} of sets of vehicles that was required for the circulation from nine to seven.|$|R
50|$|The race {{course is}} 10 km, {{corresponding}} to 100 laps. Flying speeds are around 200 km/h, {{which means that}} the pilots have to turn one lap in 1.8 seconds.

50|$|In racing, short {{shifting}} is {{a technique}} intended to avoid losing valuable acceleration time changing gears later. Although this means {{not being able to}} accelerate using the engine's peak power at the moment of the gear change, total acceleration over time may be greater as no acceleration can happen during the gear change. This can aid <b>overtaking</b> <b>by</b> ensuring that the car is in the right gear in anticipation of a manoeuvre.|$|R

5000|$|The {{technical}} aerodynamics {{regulations were}} modified to improve competition, especially for cars traveling in another car's aeroflow wake {{in order to}} <b>overtake.</b> <b>By</b> changing the size and placement of both front and rear wings, as well as requiring higher noses, the new rules attempted to reduce downforce by roughly one-quarter, but teams developed other chassis innovations to reclaim much of that [...] "lost" [...] downforce, which made following another car even harder than the previous season.|$|R
