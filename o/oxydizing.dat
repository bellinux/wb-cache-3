Hans Przibram also extracted a tyrosinase from the ink-sac of Sepia, and, causing it to act upon a watery solution of tyrosin, obtained a black pigment.

C., Marignac C, Bartier, D., Carrillo-Ros??a, J., Morales-Ruano, S., Boulvais, P. (2015). From deep to shallow fluid reservoirs: {{evolution}} of fluid sources during exhumation of the Sierra Almagrera, Betics, Spain. Geofluids, doi: 10. 1111 /gfl. 12139. Palaeo-fluids trapped in quartz and siderite-barite veins hosted by graphitic schists recorded the fluid and metal transfers during the Neogene exhumation of the Sierra Almagrera Metamorphic Core Complex. First quartz veins registered the ductile then brittle-ductile extensional shearing. The reservoir {{at that time}} was wetted by high-salinity fluids with a low density volatile phase resulting from the dissolved Triassic evaporites. Low salinity fluids occurred during the exhumation within the brittle domain as revealed by transgranular fluid inclusion planes affecting previous veins. This suggests an opening of the system and the penetration of surficial fluids from uplifted ranges during Serravalian to early Tortonian times. Transcurrent tectonics generated marine basins since late Tortonian. At depth quartz veins discordant to the foliation were associated to hematite indicating <b>oxydizing</b> conditions. A stop of the low-saline record is revealed by high-salinity Fe-rich fluids issued from the underlying metamorphic reservoir. The Messinian ongoing activity of the sinistral Trans-Alboran tectono-volcanic trend {{led to the formation of}} ore deposits. Reducing conditions and Fe-rich fluid led to the formation of siderite and pyrite. The subsequent formation of galena and barite under <b>oxydizing</b> conditions has been related to a probable increase of temperature.

40|$|During the International Indian Ocean Expedition (1964 / 65) {{sediment}} cores {{were taken}} on six profiles off the western {{coast of the}} Indian Subcontinent. These profiles run approximately perpendicular to the coast, from the deep-sea over the continental slope to the continental shelf. Additional samples and cores were taken in a dense pattern {{in front of the}} delta of the Indus River. This pattern of sampling covered not only marine sediments, but also river and beach sediments in Pakistan. The marine samples were obtained with piston, gravity and box corers and by a Van Veen grab sampler. The longest piston core is about 5 meters long. 1. Distribution of the elements on the sediment surface The area of maximal carbonate values (aprox. 80 - 100 % CaCO 3) essentially coincides with the continental shelf. The highest Sr values were observed largely within this area, but only {{in the vicinity of the}} Gulf of Cambay. Mainly the aragonitic coprolites are responsible for those high Sr contents. The Mg contents of the carbonates are comparatively low; surprisingly enough the highest Mg concentrations were also measured in the coprolites. The maximum contents of organic matter (Core) were found along the upper part of the continental slope. They coincide with the highest porosity and water content of the sediments. Frequently the decomposition of organic matter by oxydation is responsible for the measured Corg contents. On the other side the quantity of originally deposited organic material is less important in most cases. The enrichment of the "bauxitophile" elements Fe, Ti, Cr and V in the carbonate- and quartz-free portions of the sediments is essentially due to the influence of coarse terrigenous detritus. For the elements Mn, Ni and Cu (in per cent of the carbonateand quartz-free sediment) a strong enrichment was observed in the deep-sea realm. The strong increase in Mn toward the deep-sea is explained by authigenesis of Mn-Fe-concretions. Mn-nodules form only under <b>oxydizing</b> conditions which obviously are possible only at very low rates of deposition. The Mg, B and, probably also Mn contents in the clay minerals increase with increasing distance from the continent. This can be explained by the higher adsorption of those elements from sea water because of increasing duration of the clay mineral transport. The comparison of median contents of some elements in our deep-sea samples with deep-sea sediments described by TUREKIAN & WEDEPOHL (1961) shows that clear differences in concentration exist only in the case of "bauxitophile" elements Cr and Be. The Cr and Be contents show a clear increase in the Indian Ocean deep-sea samples compared to those described by TUREKIAn & WEDEPOHL (1961) which can obviously be attributed to the enrichment in the lateritic and bauxitic parent rocks. The different behaviour of the elements Fe, Ti and Mn during decomposition of the source rocks, transport to the sea and during <b>oxydizing</b> and reducing conditions in the marine environment can be illustrated by Ti 02 /Fe and MnO/Fe ratios. The different compositions of the sediments off the Indus Delta and those of the remaining part of the area investigated are characterized by a different distribution of the elements Mn and Ti. 2. Chemical inhomogenities in the sediments Most longer cores show 3 intervals defined by chemical and sedimentological differences. The top-most interval is coarse-grained, the intermedial interval is fine grained and the lower one again somewhat coarser. At the same time it is possible to observe differences from interval to interval in the organogenic and detrital constituents. During the formation of the middle interval different conditions of sedimentation from those active during the previous and subsequent periods have obviously prevailed. Looking more closely at the organogenic constituents it is remarkable that during the formation of the finer interval conditions of a more intensive oxydation have prevailed that was the case before and after: Core decreases, whereas P shows a relative increase. This may be explained by slower sedimentation rate or by a vertical migration of the oxygen rich zone of the sea-water. The modifications of the elements from minerals in detrital portion of the sediments support an explanation ascribing this fact to modifications of the conditions of denudation and transportation which can come about through a climatic change or through tectonic causes. The paleontological investigations have shown (ZOBEL, in press) that in some of the cores the middle stratum of fine sedimentation represents optimal conditions for organic life. This fact suggests also <b>oxydizing</b> conditions during the sedimentation of this interval. In addition to the depositional stratification an oxydation zone characterized by Mn-enrichment can be recognized. The thickness of the oxidation zone decreases towards the coast and thins out along the middle part of the continental slope. At those places, where the oxydation zone is extremely thin, enrichment of Mn has its maximum. This phenomenon can probably be attributed to the migration of Mn taking place in its dissociated form within the sediment under reducing conditions. On the other side this Mn-migration in the sediment does not take place in the deep-sea, where <b>oxydizing</b> conditions prevail. 3. Interstitial waters in the sediments Already at very small core depths, the interstitial waters have undergone a distinct modification compared with the overlying sea water. This distinct modification applies both to total salinity and to the individual ions. As to the beginning of diagenesis the following conclusions can be drawn: a) A strong K-increase occurs already at an early stage. It may be attributable to a diffusion barrier or to an exchange of Mg-ions on the clays. Part of this increase may also originate from the decomposition of K-containing silicates (mica and feldspars). A K-decrease owing to the formation of illite (WEAVER 1967), however, occurs only at much greater sediment depth. b) Because of an organic protective coating, the dissolution of carbonate is delayed in recent organogenic carbonates. At the same time some Ca is probably being adsorbed on clay minerals. Consequently the Ca-content of the interstitial water drops below the Ca-content of the sea water. c) Already at an early stage the Mg adsorption on the clays is completed. The adsorbed Mg is later available for diagenetic mineral formations and transformations...|$|E

Initial and final UV-Vis spectra showed a clear disappearance of the maximum absorption peak, but shows limit since it cannot allow by-products identification.

For this purpose, we performed a simulation of a convective cluster composed of many individual deep convective cells that occurred near Bauru (Brazil). The simulation is performed using the 3 -D mesoscale model RAMS coupled on-line with a chemistry model. The comparisons with meteorological measurements show that the model produces meteorological fields generally consistent with the observations. The present paper (part I) {{is devoted to the}} analysis of the ozone precursors (CO, NO x and non-methane volatile organic compounds) and HO x in the UTLS. The simulation results show that the distribution of CO with altitude is closely related to the upward convective motions and consecutive outflow {{at the top of the}} convective cells leading to a bulge of CO between 7 km altitude and the tropopause (around 17 km altitude). The model results for CO are consistent with satellite-borne measurements at 700 hPa. The simulation also indicates enhanced amounts of NO x up to 2 ppbv in the 7 – 17 km altitude layer mainly produced by the lightning associated with the intense convective activity. For insoluble non-methane volatile organic compounds, the convective activity tends to significantly increase their amount in the 7 – 17 km layer by dynamical effects. During daytime in the presence of lightning NO x, this bulge is largely reduced in the upper part of the layer for reactive species (e. g. isoprene, ethene) because of their reactions with OH that is increased on average during daytime. Lightning NO x also impacts on the <b>oxydizing</b> capacity of the upper troposphere by reducing on average HO x, HO 2, H 2 O 2 and organic hydroperoxides. During the simulation time, the impact of convection on the air composition of the lower stratosphere is negligible for all ozone precursors although several of the simulated convective cells nearly reach the tropopause. There is no significant transport from the upper troposphere to the lower stratosphere, the isentropic barrier not being crossed by convection.

40|$|International audienceThe late Carboniferous (330 - 300 Ma) Variscan {{evolution}} of the Armorican Massif (France) {{is characterized by the}} complex interaction of various processes, all linked to each other, namely deformation, magmatism, circulation of various types of fluids and related alteration and ore formation. In the Armorican Massif, the major structural feature is the lithospheric dextral South Armorican Shear Zone (SASZ). The SASZ is divided into two branches along which synkinematic peraluminous leucogranites were emplaced. The Lizio and the Questembert granites were emplaced at 315 _ 5 Ma and 315 _ 4 Ma (U-Pb on zircon) along the northern and southern branches, respectively. Supracrustal leucogranites such as the Questembert granite have been pervasively altered by fluids. The nature of the alteration and the fluids involved changed through time from a high temperature alteration by magmatic fluids expelled from the crystallizing magma to a late hydrothermal alteration triggered by a mix between metamorphic and meteoric fluids as observed in the French Massif Central 40 Ar/ 39 Ar dating of muscovite grains from the Questembert granite yielded plateau dates ranging from 319 Ma down to 303 Ma, interpreted as a 15 Ma time span of pervasive hydrothermal circulations. Highly strained mylonitic rocks sampled all along the SASZ recorded the same history, which demonstrates the regional extent of this pervasive alteration. In one sampled site, meteoric water infiltration, evidenced by an extremely low whole rock _ 18 O has been dated at 299 _ 3 Ma (U-Pb on zircon and monazite). This pervasive circulation of various fluids within the crust was very likely {{one of the most prominent}} ore-forming processes in the region. Indeed, deformation and associated pervasive alteration along the SASZ were responsible for element mobility, including metals. Pervasive circulation of mixed fluids with an <b>oxydizing</b> meteoric component may have leached Uranium from the supracrustal leucogranites. This is the case for example for most of the U-bearing quartz veins in the Pontivy granite as well as for the polymetallic mineralisations in the Saint-Aubin-des-Châteaux quarry. Tectonic considerations provide some temporal constraints. Such orientations are compatible with a roughly N-S shortening direction, which corresponds to a well characterized late Carboniferous direction. Finally, this orientation around N 160 ° is also found for a set of giant quartz veins interpreted as giant tension gashes, was formed by the precipitation of silica during the upward motion of fluids, which contained a significant proportion of surface-derived meteoric water. Therefore, during the orogenic collapse in the Armorican Massif around 300 Ma, it appears probable that a meteoric water convective cycle was established. The heat advection caused by the lower crust exhumation likely provided the driving force required to sustain this cycle. The mylonitized SASZ acted as a drain for the descending meteoric fluids while giant barren quartz veins are the witnesses of their upward motions. As most of the ore bodies were emplaced in structural traps orientated in the same direction than the giant quartz veins, we suggest that most of them are formed contemporaneously following similar processes...|$|E
60|$|In {{the middle}} of the quay a Roman {{sentinel}} stands on guard, pilum in hand, looking out to the lighthouse with strained attention, his left hand shading his eyes. The pilum is a stout wooden shaft 41 feet long, with an iron spit about three feet long fixed in it. The sentinel is so absorbed that he does not notice the approach from {{the north end of the}} quay of four Egyptian market porters carrying rolls of carpet, preceded by Ftatateeta and Apollodorus the Sicilian. Apollodorus is a dashing young man of about 24, handsome and debonair, dressed with deliberate astheticism in the most delicate purples and dove greys, with ornaments of bronze, <b>oxydized</b> silver, and stones of jade and agate. His sword, designed as carefully as a medieval cross, has a blued blade showing through an openwork scabbard of purple leather and filagree. The porters, conducted by Ftatateeta, pass along the quay behind the sentinel to the steps of the palace, where they put down their bales and squat on the ground. Apollodorus does not pass along with them: he halts, amused by the preoccupation of the sentinel.|$|R
40|$|Advanced {{oxidation}} {{processes are}} efficient {{for the removal}} of recalcitrant compounds, like azo-dyes. However, the intermediates produced during their degradation can be more toxic than the parent compounds. Improving the knowledge concerning the degradation pathways may be therefore helpful to optimize the process. In this aim, HPTLC and Direct Analysis in Real Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (DART-TOF-MS) were considered and applied to analyze the sono-oxidation of an azo dye, methyl red sodium salt (MRSS) as a model compound. Initial and final UV–vis spectra showed a clear disappearance of the maximum absorption peak, but shows limit since it cannot allow by-products’ identification. MRSS degradation was confirmed by HPTLC, which also confirmed that MRSS degradation was mainly due to oxidation, while in the considered experimental conditions the sonication effect appeared negligible. The analysis by DART-TOF-MS of the MRSS is characterized by a peak at m/z  =  279. 137. Three major peaks were observed after the MRSS oxidation: m/z =  139. 002, m/z =  223. 073 and m/z =  279. 137. Relative abundance of m/z =  139. 002, which was much higher after oxidation, tends to prove that a large proportion of initial <b>oxydized</b> MRSS was fragmented. The MRSS m/z =  270. 078. The coupling of HPTLC and DART-TOF-MS may be subsequently considered to identify the oxidation reaction products...|$|R
50|$|Hexazinone is a broad-spectrum {{residual}} {{and contact}} herbicide, rapidly {{absorbed by the}} leaves and roots. It is tolerated by conifers, and therefore {{it is a very}} effective herbicide for the control for annual and perennial broadleaf weeds, some grasses, and some woody species. Hexazinone works as rain or snowmelt makes it possible for the herbicide to move downward into the soil. There the hexazinone is absorbed from the soil by the roots. It moves through the conductive tissues to the leaves, where it blocks the photosynthesis of the plant within the chloroplasts. Hexazinone binds to a protein of the photosystem II complex, which blocks the electron transport. The result are multiple following reactions. First triplet-state chlorophyll reacts with oxygen to form singlet oxygen. Both chlorophyll and singlet oxygen then remove hydrogen ions from the unsaturated lipids present in de cells and the organelle membranes, forming lipid radicals. These radicals will <b>oxydize</b> other lipids and proteins, eventually resulting in loss of the membrane integrity of the cells and organelles. This will result in a loss of chlorophyll, leakage of cellular contents, cell death, and eventually death of the plant. Woody plants first show yellowing of the leaves before they start to defoliate, eventually they will die. Sometimes plants are able to refoliate and defoliate again during the growing season.|$|R
40|$|The late Carboniferous (330 - 300 Ma) Variscan {{evolution}} of the Armorican Massif (France) {{is characterized by the}} complex interaction of various processes, all linked to each other, namely deformation, magmatism, circulation of various types of fluids and related alteration and ore formation. In the Armorican Massif, the major structural feature is the lithospheric dextral South Armorican Shear Zone (SASZ), which separates two distinct domains: the low-grade metamorphic Central Armorican Domain (CAD) to the North and the high-grade South Armorican Domain (SAD) to the South. The SASZ is divided into two branches along which synkinematic peraluminous leucogranites were emplaced. Leucogranites emplacements occurred simultaneously along these two branches. Indeed, the Lizio and the Questembert granites were emplaced at 315 5 Ma and 315 4 Ma (U-Pb on zircon) along the northern and southern branches, respectively. Supracrustal leucogranites such as the Questembert granite have been pervasively altered by fluids. The nature of the alteration and the fluids involved changed through time from a high temperature alteration by magmatic fluids expelled from the crystallizing magma to a late hydrothermal alteration triggered by a mix between metamorphic and meteoric fluids as observed in the French Massif Central. 40 Ar/ 39 Ar dating of muscovite grains from the Questembert granite yielded plateau dates ranging from 319 Ma down to 303 Ma, interpreted as a 15 Ma time span of pervasive hydrothermal circulations. Highly strained mylonitic rocks sampled all along the SASZ recorded the same history, which demonstrates the regional extent of this pervasive alteration. In one sampled site, meteoric water infiltration, evidenced by an extremely low whole rock δ 18 O of 1. 7 h has been dated at 299 3 Ma (U-Pb on zircon and monazite). This pervasive circulation of various fluids within the crust was very likely {{one of the most prominent}} ore-forming processes in the region. Indeed, deformation and associated pervasive alteration along the SASZ were responsible for element mobility, including metals. Pervasive circulation of mixed fluids with an <b>oxydizing</b> meteoric component may have leached Uranium from the supracrustal leucogranites. Indeed, within the Questembert granite, the highly U-depleted samples recorded a meteoric water influx (low δ 18 O feldspar values). Along the SASZ, mineralised bodies are often hosted within N 140 - 170. trantensional brittle structures. This is the case for example for most of the U-bearing quartz veins in the Pontivy granite as well as for the polymetallic mineralisations in the Saint- Aubin-des-Châteaux quarry. To date, there are no precise geochronological data available to constrain the age of these ore formations. However, tectonic considerations provide some temporal constraints. Such orientations are compatible with a roughly N-S shortening direction, which corresponds to a well characterized late Carboniferous direction. Finally, this orientation around N 160. is also found for a set of giant quartz veins outcropping in the SAD. This set of veins, interpreted as giant tension gashes, was formed by the precipitation of silica during the upward motion of fluids, which contained a significant proportion of surface-derived meteoric water. Therefore, during the orogenic collapse in the Armorican Massif around 300 Ma, it appears probable that a meteoric water convective cycle was established.

40|$|The Skager Rack {{coast of}} Norway is {{characterized}} by narrow coastal banks, a well developed system of skerries and small fjords. Intensive fishing is carried on, mackerel, herring, cod and some other Gadidoid fish, etc., being of special importance. Fishing statistics from years back reveal the occurrence of great fluctuations in the herring fisheries. Mackerel fishing has increased while {{the output of the}} cod fisheries is undoubtedly declining. There {{is no doubt that the}} fluctuation in the herring fisheries is, in a high degree, caused by the variation in hydrographic conditions. The increase in the mackerel fisheries on the other hand is obviously a result of the high standard of development of motor craft and fishing gear while the decline in output of the cod fisheries is attributed to fishing on too intensive a scale, as fishing experiments tend to show. It is commonly assumed that there may be great variations in the result of the spawning of the different species. In order to comprehend the fluctuation in the output of the fisheries it is therefore of importance to study the conditions under which fish eggs and larvae develope in the different years. Investigations having a bearing on this point have previously been undertaken on this coast by KNUT DAHL in 1904 and 1905 (6) and by me in 1917 (8) and 1924 (3). DAHL found great quantities of fish eggs and larvae in the fjords and advanced the suggestion of possible great interchanges between the fjords and the open sea of fish eggs and larvae by means of currents. My investigations in 1917 showed that the content of oxygen in the fjord at the intermediate and deep water layers was much lower than out at sea. It was not reasonable therefore to assume that great interchanges of water masses took place as a matter of course, and the collection of fish eggs and larvae demonstrated some difference between skerries and open sea both as regards species and comparative numbers. In the skerries there was a fauna of eggs and larvae differing from that of the fjord and the sea just a few miles outside. The investigations in 1924 demonstrated the effect of a cold period in the middle of the spawning season of the spring spawners. The eggs disappeared from the waters. The influence of the cold water, however, was more restricted to the open sea. In the fjords there were reservoirs of water of a sufficiently high temperature. When the ice melted here a good quantity of eggs was found to be present, and when the temperature of the sea outside the coast and in the skerries increased fish eggs and larvae were again found, but only in small numbers. A tentative suggestion was made to the effect that a cold period in the middle of the spawning process was detrimental to the eggs spawned and the larvae hatched and it was assumed that the best spawning and hatching results would be obtained if the temperature of the sea during the early winter prevented spawning. When the temperature subsequently rose conditions would be good for hatching and development of the larvae. In all years since 1917 regular hydrographic observations have been made, both near the coast and in the fjords. Outside the coast both salinity and temperature in the surface and intermediate layers vary greatly according to the meteorological conditions obtaining during the year. Easterly winds in winter and spring bring comparatively fresh and cold water near the coast. Spawning will not, therefore, take place and the spawners will seek warmer water layers. Westerly winds bring higher temperatures and salinities in their train, conditions well-suited for the spawning, hatching and development of the brood. The last mentioned process, however, is entirely dependent on the food available. Directly and indirectly the larvae feed on the phytoplancton and as the latter is very dependent on the light it is of great importance that hatching of the larvae should not take place until reproduction of the phytoplancton has commenced. In the fjords the investigations have shown that the variations in the hydrography of the deeper layers are insignificant. Except in special circumstances, between which there may be intervals of many years, no renewal of the waters takes place here. For this reason the quantity of oxygen dissolved in the bottom layers will be consumed by the life processes of animals and plants and by the <b>oxydizing</b> of organic matter. Thus for a time the bottom layers may be unfit for animal life. The intermediate layers of the fjords are also very stationary and the quantity of oxygen here may vary in quite a different manner to that of the water outside. Here, however, the quantities are never so low as to render the waters unsuitable for animal life. The material dealt with in this paper was collected in 1934, 1935, 1936 and 1937 - from the waters outside the coast, the skerries and the fjords near Arendal, Kristiansand and Kragerø. The results arrived at in 1917 and 1924 are referred to. The figs. illustrating the occurrences of the different species show that the eggs and larvae of cod are found most abundantly in the fjord, the skerries and close outside the coast. The highest numbers of larvae caught in the Topdals fjord (11. - 12. May 1934) and Kragerø Fjord (14. - 16. May 1934) occurred, however, as already mentioned, some weeks after millions of cod fry had been liberated in these fjords. Haddock larvae are most numerous some miles further from the coast. Sprat larvae occur both in the fjords and in the open sea. Spawning appears to commence about one month earlier in the fjords than outside the coast. Herring larvae are most abundant in the skerries. Mackerel larvae occur almost exclusively outside the coast. Few hauls have been made in the fjords, however, during the mackerel spawning period. The results already attained in 1917 (DANNEVIG 8), namely, that each area of water, fjords, skerries and open sea, has its own special communities of fish eggs and larvae, are confirmed by the present investigations. Cod and herring are coastal forms both as to spawning and larvae. Haddock larvae are most prominent further out. This, undoubtedly, accords with the more oceanic character of the haddock as compared with the more littoral cod on this coast. The sprat and mackerel are pelagic forms. The former spawns both in the fjords and the open sea. A study of the detailed tables brings to light other differences between the fjord and the skerries. A number of species only occur in the open sea or in the skerries. In the most isolated waters investigated, namely, those of the Kils Fjord, only a few species are present. The special hydrographic conditions in the fjords will only permit a restricted number of species to live and propagate in the fjord. Such a distribution cannot take place if the waters in question interchange to a great extent and when a few species do occur in nearly all areas investigated they must be regarded as representatives of species with a wide spawning area...|$|E

It presents two types of carbon-vanadium bonding. One cycle is bonded to the metal by eight carbon atoms, the other one by four carbon atoms only. EPR and ENDOR measurements have shown that this complex exhibits a strong fluxionality in frozen solution down to 30 °K. Moreover, cyclic voltametry experiments reveals two oxydation waves. This fact is suprising since the number of electrons in the external shell of such <b>oxydized</b> complexes move away from 18. A study of the geometries and the electronic structures of these complexes has been undertaken using a local density functional technique. These results have been checked by comparison with data obtained from X-ray diffraction and ENDOR spectra: the optimized geometries {{are very close to}} what is found in the solid state and the existence of two types of V-carbon bonds is confirmed. Moreover the spin densities calculated for hydrogen atoms by LDF fairly coincide with ENDOR data.

The data {{presented}} in this paper show the differences between these lagoons and others around the world. The freshwater from the nver and ncefields flows into the lagoons from Apnl to December. This is the cause of the low salinity values and the relatively high water lavels observed during this penod of the year in contrast to the values from January to Apnl. The intensity of these fluctuations depends on the flow rates. The lagoons are in an advanced process of eutrophication. The hydrological cycle patially controls the seasonal changes of phosphorus and nitrogen and two relative maxima are observed in al 1 the lagoons. Those of phosphorus occured in March and Oc-tober and those of nitrogen (dissolved inorganic <b>oxydized</b> nitrogen) in winter and spnng.

40|$|Bacteria of {{the genus}} Brucella have the unusual {{capability}} to catabolize erythritol and this property {{has been associated with}} their virulence mainly {{because of the presence of}} erythritol in bovine foetal tissues and because the attenuated S 19 vaccine strain is the only Brucella strain unable to <b>oxydize</b> erythritol. In this work we have analyzed the transcriptional changes produced in Brucella by erythritol by means of two high throughput approaches: RNA hybridization against a microarray containing most of Brucella ORF's constructed from the Brucella ORFeome and next generation sequencing of Brucella mRNA in an Illumina GAIIx platform. The results obtained showed the overexpression of a group of genes, many of them in a single cluster around the ery operon, able to co-ordinately mediate the transport and degradation of erythritol into three carbon atoms intermediates that will be then converted into fructose- 6 P (F 6 P) by gluconeogenesis. Other induced genes participating in the nonoxidative branch of the pentose phosphate shunt and the TCA may collaborate with the ery genes to conform an efficient degradation of sugars by this route. On the other hand, several routes of amino acid and nucleotide biosynthesis are up-regulated whilst amino acid transport and catabolism genes are down-regulated. These results corroborate previous descriptions indicating that in the presence of erythritol, this sugar was used preferentially over other compounds and provides a neat explanation of the the reported stimulation of growth induced by erythritol...|$|R
