50|$|The National Bingo Game {{has been}} in {{operation}} for over 25 years and has an unblemished <b>operating</b> <b>record</b> under both The Gaming Board of Great Britain and currently The Gambling Commission. There have been some controversial incidents with winners in the past, but these {{have tended to be}} few and far between. Of these incidents the majority of cases have been related to disagreements between players, where informal agreements between players to each share their winnings with the other/s, have not been honoured. That said there are also cases where some bingo customers share their major winnings with fellow bingo players, even when they are not present in the club. However, as these are independent agreements made between players the National Bingo Game Association, as operator of the game, has no official role in resolving such disputes.|$|E
50|$|Through the 1970s, breeder {{designs were}} being widely experimented on, {{especially}} in the USA, France and the USSR. However, this coincided with a crash in uranium prices. The expected increased demand led mining companies to build up new supply channels, which came online just as the rate of reactor construction stalled in the mid-1970s. The resulting oversupply caused fuel prices to decline from about US$40 per pound in 1980 to less than $20 by 1984. Breeders produced fuel that was much more expensive, {{on the order of}} $100 to $160, and the few units that had reached commercial operation proved to be economically disastrous. Interest in breeder reactors were further muted by Jimmy Carter's April 1977 decision to defer construction of breeders in the US due to proliferation concerns, and the terrible <b>operating</b> <b>record</b> of France's Superph√©nix reactor.|$|E

40|$|The European Monetary Union {{has been}} in {{operation}} since 1 January 1999. The paper offers an interim assessment of {{the operations of the}} European Central Bank (ECB) during this period. It describes how the ECB defined its monetary strategy and carried out its policy. The evaluation offered in the paper is largely positive, the principal objects of criticism being found to stem from the constitution which defines the position and principal objective of the ECB. This constitution embodies an extreme version of Central Bank independence and creates a "democratic deficit" in consequence. Albeit the <b>operating</b> <b>record</b> is not without some blemishes, for example in regard to the ECB"s communication policy. So far, the ECB has benefitted from a favourable macroeconomic conjuncture. This has changed and a more testing time may now be in store...|$|E
40|$|The {{information}} contained in, and/or referenced in, this Annual Hanford Site Environmental Permitting Status Report addresses Permit Condition II. W (Other Permits and/or Approvals) of the Dangerous Waste Portion of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Permit for the Treatment, Storage, and Disposal of Dangerous Waste, {{issued by the}} Washington State Department of Ecology (WA 7890008967). Condition II. W specifies that the Permittees are responsible for obtaining all other applicable federal, state, and local permits authorizing the development and operation of the Hanford Facility. This status report also addresses Permit Condition I. E. 22, as interpreted in Section 12. 1. 25 of the Hanford Facility Dangerous Waste Permit Application, General Information Portion (DOE/RL- 91 - 28, Rev. 4), that states this report will be prepared annually {{and a copy of}} this report will be placed in the Facility <b>Operating</b> <b>Record,</b> General Information file by October 1 of each year...|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} {{describes the}} planned activities and performance standards for closing the Plutonium Finishing Plant (PFP) Treatment and Storage Unit. The PFP Treatment and Storage Unit is {{located within the}} 234 - 52 Building in the 200 West Area of the Hanford Facility. Although this document is prepared based upon Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 265, Subpart G requirements, closure of the unit will comply with Washington Administrative Code (WAC) 173 - 303 - 610 regulations pursuant to Section 5. 3 of the Hanford Federal Facility Agreement and Consent Order (Tri-Party Agreement) Action Plan (Ecology et al. 1996). Because the PFP Treatment and Storage Unit manages transuranic mixed (TRUM) waste, there are many controls placed on management of the waste. Based on the many controls placed on management of TRUM waste, releases of TRUM waste are not anticipated {{to occur in the}} PFP Treatment and Storage Unit. Because the intention is to clean close the PFP Treatment and Storage Unit, postclosure activities are not applicable to this closure plan. To clean close the unit, it will be demonstrated that dangerous waste has not been left onsite at levels above the closure performance standard for removal and decontamination. If it is determined that clean closure is not possible or is environmentally impractical, the closure plan will be modified to address required postclosure activities. The PFP Treatment and Storage Unit will be operated to immobilize and/or repackage plutonium-bearing waste in a glovebox process. The waste to be processed is in a solid physical state (chunks and coarse powder) and will be sealed {{into and out of the}} glovebox in closed containers. The containers of immobilized waste will be stored in the glovebox and in additional permitted storage locations at PFP. The waste will be managed to minimize the potential for spills outside the glovebox, and to preclude spills from reaching soil. Containment surfaces will be maintained to ensure integrity. In the unlikely event that a waste spill does occur outside the glovebox, operating methods and administrative controls will require that waste spills be cleaned up promptly and completely, and a notation will be made in the <b>operating</b> <b>record.</b> Because dangerous waste does not include source, special nuclear, and by-product material components of mixed waste, radionuclides are not within the scope of this documentation. The information on radionuclides is provided only for general knowledge...|$|E
