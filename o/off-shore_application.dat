40|$|An extreme loading {{study has}} been {{conducted}} comprising a general wind climate analysis {{as well as a}} wind turbine reliability study. In the wind climate analysis, the distribution of the (horizontal) turbulence standard deviation, conditioned on the mean wind speed, has been approximated by fitting a three parameter Weibull distribution to the measured on-shore and off-shore data for wind speed variations. Specific recommendations on off-shore design turbulence intensities are lacking in the present IEC-code. Based on the present analysis of the off-shore wind climate on two shallow water sites, a design turbulence intensity for <b>off-shore</b> <b>application</b> is proposed which, in the IEC code framework, is applicable for extreme as well as for fatigue load determination. In order to establish a rational method to analyse wind turbine components with respect to failure in ultimate loading, and in addition to establish partial safety factors for design of such components against this failure mode, structural reliability methods must be applied. This type of analysis accounts for the variability of the external (wind) loading (a...|$|E

Space- and weight challenges are given priority, {{and the size of the}} capture installations will be of importance when selecting capture technology rather than process efficiency alone. In this work, CO 2 capture from an FPSO turbine exhaust gas using a supersonic separator is investigated. To assess the operational performance of the capture process, a Laval nozzle (converging- diverging geometry) model is implemented and successfully integrated in a steady-state process flow sheet simulator. The model includes equilibrium thermodynamics describing freeze-out of dry ice from a gas mixture containing CO 2. To determine under which conditions this process is thermodynamically and fluid dynamically feasible, different boundary conditions are explored. By integrating the supersonic separator unit in a flow sheet model, the interaction between the capture and the rest of the process is studied. The results indicate that supersonic expansion is a viable strategy for capturing CO 2 from off-shore gas turbines...|$|E

However, {{the capability of}} most existing acid gas treatment systems is limited to treat natural gas with CO 2 content of 30 to 40 mol%. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to present preliminary study on the potential of an <b>off-shore</b> <b>application</b> of an adsorption system using aminated resin to capture CO 2 at the natural gas reserves. This system is intended to reduce the CO 2 content down to the capability of existing acid gas treatment. The flowsheet simulation based approach implemented in PETRONAS ’ iCON and HYSYS process simulators is used to study the effect of temperature, pressure, adsorbent concentration and flow rate on the CO 2 removal performance using the proposed system. For the assumed CO 2 content of 70 mol % in the natural gas from reserves, the developed iCON and HYSYS models predict reduction to 11. 8 mol % and 14 mol % of CO 2 in the treated gas stream, respectively. The preliminary economic study indicates positive economic potential.

In distillation, the high efficiency and low pressure drop of structured packing results in better product purities and/or recoveries. For heat sensitive materials, where the bottom temperature is critical, a decrease in operating pressure reduces thermal degradation.

40|$|The worlds {{energy demand}} is increasing, {{and at the}} same time the amount of easily {{accessible}} oil is reduced. Associated gas for most <b>off-shore</b> <b>applications</b> are flared or injected in the reservoir due to transportation challenges. A gas-to-liquid (GTL) process for offshore applications could be a solution to make valuable products of the associated and remote natural gas resources. GTL is a process that converts carbon based feedstock to more valuable liquid products. One of the main technologies used are the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. A new process design for a GTL process for <b>off-shore</b> <b>applications</b> are proposed. The syngas is produced with an autothermal reformer (ATR) with enriched air as oxidant. The process design is a once-through, to prevent accumulation of nitrogen. Once-through means that no unconverted syngas is recycled in the process. In order to maximize the conversion and production of higher hydrocarbon the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis are staged. Three multitubular fixed bed stages are used with product separation and hydrogen added between each step. Two Fischer-Tropsch reactors in parallel are used for the two first reactor stages. The hydrogen is produced by steam methane reforming in a heat exchanged reformer, where heat needed for reaction is provided from the hot outlet stream from the ATR. The tail gas in the process is used for power production in a gas turbine. The hot effluent gas from the gas turbine is used for pre-heating of the natural gas. The process design is modelled and optimized with the use of Aspen HYSYS V 8. 6, with some use of Aspen Custom Modeler and MATLAB programming. The kinetic model used for the Fischer-Trospch reactors are proposed by Todic et al., with a product distribution model proposed by Hillestad. There are several parameters in the process that could be optimized. Optimizing in this master thesis are focused on obtaining the maximum production of C 5 +, which means hydrocarbons with five carbon atoms or more. The optimal distribution of the natural gas in the process was found to be 90 % to the autothermal reformer and 10 % to the heat exchanged reformer. With a natural gas feed amount of 120 MMSCF or 6, 000 kmole/h the total production in the process are found to be 53. 9 tonne/h or approximately 10, 000 bbl/day.

This process is projected to have lower capital and operating costs than the competing technologies, amine/aqueous iron liquid redox and amine/Claus/tail gas treating, and have a smaller plant footprint, making it well suited to both on-shore and <b>off-shore</b> <b>applications.</b> CrystaSulf{reg_sign} (service mark of CrystaTech, Inc.) is a new nonaqueous sulfur recovery process that removes hydrogen sulfide (H{sub 2 }S) from gas streams and converts it into elemental sulfur.

40|$|Hydraulic capsule {{pipelines}} (HCPs) are {{the third}} generation pipelines transporting hollow containers, known as capsules. These capsules are filled with material/cargo to be transported. The shape of these capsules has {{a significant effect on}} the hydrodynamic flow characteristics within HCPs. As the variations in the pressure distribution within HCPs are directly linked to and the flow characteristics within pipelines, it is essential to critically evaluate the effect of capsule shape on the pressure drop across the pipeline. Published literature is severely limited in terms of establishing the effects of the shape of the capsules on the flow characteristics within pipelines. Hence, the present study focuses on using a well-validated Computational Fluid Dynamics tool to numerically simulate the flow of capsules of various shapes quantified in form of a novel shape factor in hydraulic capsule pipelines. Both on-shore and <b>off-shore</b> <b>applications</b> of such pipelines have been investigated in the present study, along-with pipe fittings, such as bends.

This glassy polymeric membrane was synthesized by the polymerization reaction of 9, 10 -dimethyl- 2, 6 (7) diaminotriptycene with dimethoxymethane. In this research, the polymer was selected due to its high surface area and highly interconnected microporous structure. Sorption isotherms of nitrogen (N 2), oxygen (O¬ 2), methane (CH 4), carbon dioxide (CO 2), ethane (C 2 H 6), propane (C 3 H 8), and n-butane (n-C 4 H 10) were measured at 35 °C over a range of pressures using a Hiden Intelligent Gravimetric Analyzer, IGA. The more condensable gases (C 2 H 6, CO 2, C 3 H 8, and n-C 4 H 10) showed high solubility due to their high affinity to the polymer matrix. The permeation coefficients were determined for various gases at 35 °C and pressure difference of 5 bar via the constant-pressure/variable-volume method. The PIM-Trip-TB- 2 film exhibited high performance for several high-impact applications, such as O 2 /N 2, H 2 /N 2 and H 2 /CH 4.

Extensive research is being carried out on improving efficiency of existing modes of cargo transport, as well as to develop alternative means of transporting goods. One such alternative method can be through the use of energy contained within fluid flowing in pipelines in order to transfer goods from one place to another. Although the concept of using fluid pipelines for transportation purposes has been in practice for more than a millennium now, but the detailed knowledge of the flow behaviour in such pipelines is still a subject of active research. This {{is due to the fact}} that most of the studies conducted on transporting goods in pipelines are based on experimental measurements of global flow parameters, and only a rough approximation of the local flow behaviour within these pipelines has been reported. With the emergence of sophisticated analytical tools and the use of high performance computing facilities being installed throughout the globe, it is now possible to simulate the flow conditions within these pipelines and get better understanding of the underlying flow phenomena. The present study focuses on the use of advanced modelling tools to simulate the flow within Hydraulic Capsule Pipelines (HCPs) in order to quantify the flow behaviour within such pipelines. Hydraulic Capsule Pipeline is the term which refers to the transport of goods in hollow containers, typically of spherical or cylindrical shapes, termed as capsules, being carried along the pipeline by water. A novel modelling technique has been employed to carry out the investigations under various geometric and flow conditions within HCPs. Both qualitative and quantitative flow diagnostics has been carried out on the flow of both spherical and cylindrical shaped capsules in a horizontal HCP for on-shore applications. A train of capsules consisting of a single to multiple capsules per unit length of the pipeline has been modelled for practical flow velocities within HCPs. It has been observed that the flow behaviour within HCP depends on a number of fluid and geometric parameters. The pressure drop in such pipelines cannot be predicted from established methods. Development of a predictive tool for such applications is one of the aims that is been achieved in this study. Furthermore, investigations have been conducted on vertical pipelines as well, which are very important for <b>off-shore</b> <b>applications</b> of HCPs. The energy requirements for vertical HCPs are significantly higher than horizontal HCPs. It has been shown that a minimum average flow velocity is required to transport a capsule in a vertical HCP, depending upon the geometric and physical properties of the capsules. The concentric propagation, along the centreline of pipe, of heavy density capsules in vertical HCPs marks a significant variation from horizontal HCPs transporting heavy density capsules. Bends are an integral part of pipeline networks. In order to design any pipeline, it is essential to consider the effects of the bends on the overall energy requirements within the pipelines. In order to accurately design both horizontal and vertical HCPs, analysis of the flow behaviour and energy requirements, of varying geometric configurations, has been carried out. A novel modelling technique has been incorporated in order to accurately predict the velocity, trajectory and orientation of the capsules in pipe bends. Optimisation of HCPs plays a crucial rule towards worldwide commercial acceptability of such pipelines. Based on Least-Cost Principle, an optimisation methodology has been developed for single stage HCPs for both on-shore and <b>off-shore</b> <b>applications.</b> The input to the optimisation model is the solid throughput required from the system, and the outputs are the optimal diameter of the HCPs and the pumping requirements for the capsule transporting system.

The advanced computational skills being incorporated in this study has made it possible to map and analyse the flow structure within HCPs.

40|$|Threaded pipe {{connections}} used in on-shore and <b>off-shore</b> <b>applications</b> are often subjected to cyclic loads. They generally have a conical shape which {{enables them to}} be preloaded {{as a result of}} make-up torque. This ensures that a sealed and secure connection between the different pipes is maintained. The combination of the preload and the additional external loads, together with the thread geometry results in a complex multi-axial stress distribution over the connection. The highest concentration of axial tensile stresses typically appears at the last engaged thread of the male part of the connection. Consequently, this region will be highly susceptible for fatigue crack initiation. The stress distribution over the connection depends on the connection’s geometry, interface and material properties, but the exact influence of those parameters on the fatigue life of the connections is not well documented. In the present study, the influence of geometry changes of the female part of an API Line Pipe connection on the fatigue life of the total connection is investigated. This is done by performing a parametric finite element study, using 2 D axisymmetric models. The preload is modelled by giving an initial overlap to the male and female part of the connection, corresponding to the number of make-up turns specified by the API 5 B standard. This results in a compressive hoop stress in the male part of the connection. Afterwards an additional axial tensile load is applied. The final aim of this numerical study is to reduce the acting axial tensile stress concentrations as much as possible. To validate the finite element results, four-point bending fatigue tests were carried out on threaded pipe samples with a nominal size of 1 ” (load controlled, R = 0. 1). Cracks emanated from the last engaged thread of the male part of the connection, as could be expected from the models. Through thickness cracks were detected by pressurizing the tube-samples. When a crack grows through the wall thickness of a pipe, pressure drops and the test is stopped. The number of elapsed load cycles defines the fatigue life of the connection. This way an S-N curve was obtained for the standard API Line Pipe connection and compared to the results of connections with changed geometries...|$|R
40|$|In {{off-shore}} {{oil and gas}} platform efficiency, {{the reliability}} and fuel flexibility are the major concerns when selecting the gas turbine to support the electrical and mechanical demand on the platform. In order to fulfill these requirements, turbine inlet temperature and pressure ratio are not increased up to the optimal values and one or more redundant gas turbines may be employed. With increasing incentives for reducing the CO 2 emissions off-shore, improving the thermal efficiency has become a focus area. Due to the peculiar low turbine outlet temperature and due to space and weight constraints, a steam bottoming cycle is not a convenient solution. On the contrary, organic Rankine cycles (ORCs) present the benefits of high simplicity and compactness. Furthermore, the working fluid can be selected considering the temperature profile at which the heat is supplied; hence the heat transfer process and the thermal efficiency of the cycle can be maximized. This paper is aimed at finding the most optimal ORC tailored for <b>off-shore</b> <b>applications</b> using an optimization procedure based on the genetic algorithm. Numerous working fluids are screened through, considering mainly thermal efficiency, but also other characteristics of the fluids, e. g. stability, environmental and human health impacts, and safety issues. Both supercritical and subcritical ORCs {{are included in the}} analysis. The optimization procedure is first applied to a conservative ORC where the maximum pressure is limited to 20 bar. Subsequently the optimal working fluid is identified by removing the restriction on the maximum pressure. Different limits on hazards and global warming potential (GWP) are also set. The study is focused on the SGT- 500 gas turbine installed on the Draugen platform in the Norwegian Sea. The simulations suggest that, when a high hazard is accepted, cyclohexane is the best solution. With a turbine inlet pressure limit of 20 bar, the combined gas turbine-ORC system presents an efficiency of 43. 7 %, corresponding to an improvement of 11. 9 %-points with respect to the gas turbine efficiency. With no upper pressure boundary, cyclohexane at 55. 5 bar is the preferable working fluid with a combined thermal efficiency of 44. 3 %.

40|$|High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) {{transmission}} has to date mostly {{been used}} for point-to-point projects, {{with only a few}} select projects being designed from the outset to incorporate multiple terminals. Any future HVDC network is therefore likely to evolve out of this pool of HVDC connections. As technology improves, the voltage rating, at the point of commission, of the these connections increases. Interconnection therefore requires the DC equivalent of the transformer, to bridge the voltage levels and create a multi-terminal network. This thesis investigates new potential DC/DC converter topologies, which may be used for a range of HVDC applications. Simple interconnections of new and legacy HVDC links is unlikely to require a large voltage-step, but will be required to transfer a large amount of power. As the HVDC network develops it may become feasible for wind-farms and load-centres to directly connect to the DC network, rather than requiring new and dedicated links. Such a connection is called an HVDC tap and is typically rated at {{only a small fraction of}} the link's peak capacity (around 10 %). Such taps would connect a distribution voltage level to the HVDC network. DC/DC converters suitable for large-step ratios (> 5 : 1) may find their application here. In this work DC/DC converters for both small and large step-ratios are investigated. Two approaches are taken to design such converters: first, an approach utilising existing converter topologies is investigated. As each project comes with a huge price-tag, their reliability is paramount. Naturally, technology that has already proven itself in the field can be modified more readily and quickly for deployment. Using two modular multilevel converters in a front-to-front arrangement has been found to work efficiently for large power transfers and low step-ratios. Such a system can be operated at higher than 50 Hz frequencies to reduce the volume of a number of passive components, making the set-up suitable for compact <b>off-shore</b> <b>applications.</b> This does however incur a significant penalty in losses reducing the overall converter efficiency. In the second approach DC/DC converter designs are presented, that are more experimental and would require significantly more development work before deployment. Such designs do not look to adapt existing converter topologies but rather are designed from scratch, purely for DC/DC applications. An evolution of the front-to-front arrangement is investigated in further detail. This circuit utilises medium frequency (> 50 Hz) square current and voltage waveforms. The DC/DC step-ratio is achieved through a combination of the stacks of cells and a transformer. This split approach allows for high-step ratios to be achieved at similar system efficiencies as for the front-to-front arrangement. The topology has been found to be much more suitable for higher than 50 Hz operation from a losses perspective, allowing for a compact and efficient design. Open Acces...|$|R

Conventional ways for gas separation are expensive, and, hence, {{it is very important}} to reduce the cost and lower the energy consumption. Membrane technology is a relatively new separation process for natural gas purification with large growth potential, specifically for <b>off-shore</b> <b>applications.</b> The economics of any membrane separation process depend primarily on the intrinsic gas permeation properties of the membrane materials. All current commercial membranes for natural gas separation are made from polymers, which have several drawbacks, including low permeability, moderate selectivity, and poor stability in acid gas and hydrocarbon environments. The recent development of polymeric materials called “polymers of intrinsic microporosity” (PIMs) provide a new class of high-performance membrane materials that are anticipated to be used in natural gas separation processes including, but not limited to, acid gas removal and separation of hydrocarbons from methane. PIM- 7 is an excellent example of a material from the PIMs series for gas separation. It was selected for this work since it has not been extensively tested for its gas permeation properties to date. Specifically, sorption and mixed-gas permeation data were not available for PIM- 7 prior to this work. Sorption isotherms of N 2, O 2, CH 4, CO 2, C 2 H 6, C 3 H 8 and n-C 4 H 10 were determined over a range of pressures at 35 oC for PIM- 7 using a custom-designed dual-volume pressure decay system. Condensable hydrocarbon gases, such as C 3 H 8 and n-C 4 H 10, show significantly higher solubility than the other less condensable gas of the test series due to their high affinity to the polymer matrix. Dual-mode sorption model parameters were determined from the sorption isotherms. Henry’s law solubility, Langmuir capacity constant and the affinity constant increased with gas condensability. Permeability coefficients of He, H 2, N 2, O 2, CH 4, CO 2, C 2 H 6, C 3 H 8 and n-C 4 H 10 were measured at 35 oC and 2 atm feed pressure using a home-made constant-volume/variable pressure pure-gas permeation system. Hydrocarbon-induced plasticization of PIM- 7 was confirmed by measuring the permeability coefficients of C 3 H 8 and n-C 4 H 10 as function of pressure at 35 oC. Diffusion coefficients were calculated from the permeability and solubility data at 2 atm for all penetrants tested and as function of pressure for C 3 H 8 and n-C 4 H 10; the values for C 3 and C 4 increased significantly with pressure because of plasticization. Physical aging was studied by measuring the permeability coefficients of a number of gases in fresh and aged films. Mixed-gas permeation tests were performed for a feed mixture of 2 vol% n-butane and 98 vol% methane. Based on BET surface area measurements using N 2 as a probe molecule, PIM- 7 is a microporous polymer (S = 690 m 2 /g) and it was expected to exhibit selectivity for n-butane over methane, as previously observed for other microporous polymers, such as PIM- 1 and PTMSP. Surprisingly, PIM- 7 is more permeable to methane than n-butane and exhibits a mixed-gas methane/n-butane selectivity of up to 2. 3. This result indicates that the micropore size in PIM- 7 is smaller than that in other PIMs materials. Consequently, PIM- 7 is not a suitable candidate membrane material for separation of higher hydrocarbons from methane...|$|R

However, with the intensification of <b>off-shore</b> construction activity, <b>applications</b> of this method have also been extended to evaluate the elastic properties of seabed sediments. These sediments are often undercompated and characterized by very low Vs and high Vp/Vs ratios. The importance of Vp/Vs ratios is usually underrated in AVA inversion which is often applied with few misgivings in case of high Vp/Vs ratios. In this work, we derive the elastic properties of the seabed interface by applying AVA inversion to a 2 D well-site survey acquisition. The limited water depth, the maximum offset of the seismic acquisition and the high frequency content of the data make it possible to consider two different ranges of incidence angles: 0 - 30 and 0 - 60 degrees. The limits of AVA inversion in case of high Vp/Vs ratios are discussed together with the benefits introduced by wide angle reflections in constraining the inversion. In particular, these reflections are essential to decrease both the cross-talk between the inverted parameters and the uncertainties in the Vp and density estimations, but they do not guarantee a reliable Vs estimation...|$|R
40|$|Conventional wind {{turbines}} are built with a mechanical transmission system, and all components are therefore situated {{on top of}} the wind turbine. By replacing the mechanical drive shaft and gear with a hydraulic transmission line, most of these components can be relocated {{at the bottom of the}} wind turbine. Especially for off-shore floating {{wind turbines}}, this is important, as this will make the floating structure more easy to control. For <b>off-shore</b> <b>applications,</b> the reliability of the wind turbines is also essential. The turbines are towed several kilometres from land, and maintenance takes both time and is dangerous. A wind turbine with a hydraulic transmission line will give a much more reliable system, as no mechanical gear is included in the design. The hydraulic transmission line enables the turbine and generator to be operated at different velocities. This creates the possibility of using a synchronous generator at constant speed together with a turbine operated at changing speed. By varying the displacement of the motor, the volumetric flow can be adjusted so that the turbine spins with an optimal rate. The advantage of using a synchronous generator in preference to an asynchronous one, is the removal of heavy and expensive frequency conversion equipment. The synchronous generator can deliver its power directly to the power grid, because its frequency never changes. At the same time, the turbine is rotated at an optimal rate, maximizing the effectiveness of the wind turbine. This thesis is concerned with the modeling, analysis and control design for a wind turbine with a hydraulic transmission line. The transmission line is divided into a high pressure and low pressure side, where the dynamics of the high pressure side are interesting. The high pressure transmission line is built up of a hydraulic motor converting mechanical power into fluid power. Then, the fluid is carried through a transmission line system with an accumulator alongside it, before the fluid power is reconverted into mechanical power by a hydraulic motor. The hydraulic pump and motor will be supplied by H&# 228;gglunds Drives, but they do not yet exist because of their large sizes. However, scaled parameters from existing pumps and motors are used instead for modeling and simulation purposes. The transmission line is modeled as a chain of helmholtz-resonators linked together. By dividing the transmission line into an admittance model and a hybrid model, two state space representations are found. This split is made because of the accumulator model situated half way down the transmission line. The accumulator is modeled by the movement of the accumulator piston, and the pressure of the compressed gas, which results in a non-linear model with three states. The dynamic parts of the system are analysed, that is the transmission line and the accumulator. Transfer functions for the two transmission line models are found, and the natural frequencies of the model are determined. A transfer function is also found for the accumulator, by first linearizing the accumulator model, and then finding the stationary state values. The accumulator is shown to include very fast dynamics, giving us a maximum step size when running simulations. The helmholtz-resonator models reveals that there exists a pressure wave in the transmission line, which is reflected at the transmission line ends. It also reveals, that when several resonators are linked together, unnatural higher frequencies develop, which act like noise during simulations. A control design is carried out for the wind turbine with a mechanical transmission line, to gain insight in the controller functionality. The controller is used as pitch compensation when wind speeds are above rated. A similar approach is taken when designing a controller for the wind turbine with a hydraulic transmission line. A pitch controller featuring both feed forward and feedback terms is developed, so that the pressure in the transmission line is kept at a certain maximum. Additionally, a wind speed estimator is developed, as wind speed measurements at the nacelle often are very contaminated with noise from the rotating propeller blades. Simulations are made of the accumulator, the transmission line, and the hydraulic pump and motor separately, before running simulations with the whole system connected together. Different motor configurations are tested with the hydraulic transmission line removed. This is because of the small step size imposed by the accumulator model. The different motor configurations include a single large displacement unit, a single high speed unit with small displacement, several small displacement units, and a single large variable displacement unit. Power delivered from the turbine is compared to the power delivered to the generator, and pressure is compared to the set point given to the pitch controller. The results are satisfactory, showing that there will be considerable losses from the hydraulic pump and motor. A turbine power output of 5 MW will yield a generator power input of approximately 4. 3 MW. However, because the transmission line pressure currently is 80 % of what it can handle (300 bar), the turbine power output could be increased. The total power fed to the generator would then be i order of 5 to 6 MW. The advantages by using a hydraulic transmission line, like lower maintenance and longer lifetime expectancy, seem to make up for the increased losses in the transmission line. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{wind power}} {{generation}} is rapidly becoming competitive with {{conventional fossil fuel}} sources and already today is at par with new coal or gas fired power stations. The wind turbine design objectives have changed {{over the past decade}} from being convention-driven to being optimized driven within the operating regime and market environment. The wind turbines are growing in size, designs are progressing from fixedspeed, stall-controlled having drive trains with gearboxes, to become pitch controlled, variable speed and with or without gearboxes. The advancement in power electronics devices further supports the trend toward variable speed turbines. Today, the wind turbines in the market have a variety of innovative concepts, with proven technology for both generators and power electronics interface. However, the increasing penetration of large wind farms into electrical power systems also poses different kind of challenges due to their intermittent nature. This inspires the designers to develop both custom generators and power electronics devices with sophisticated modern control system strategies. Recently, variable-speed permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) based wind energy conversion systems (WECS) are becoming more attractive in comparison to fixed-speed WECS. In the variable-speed generation system, the wind turbine can be operated at maximum power operating points over a wide speed range by adjusting the shaft speed optimally. Moreover, the use of Permanent Magnet reduces size, and weight of overall WECS, as there is no need of field winding and its excitation system. The absence of rotor winding also reduces heat dissipation in the rotor and hence improves the overall efficiency. This kind of configuration also find special favor for <b>off-shore</b> wind <b>application,</b> where the geared doubly fed induction generator requires regular maintenance due to tearing-wearing in brushes and gear box. To perform maximum power point tracking at different wind speeds, the variable speed operation of PMSG is required. For the variable speed operation of PMSG, generally vector control is preferred as it allows the independent torque and field control just like a simple DC motor control. The vector control of PMSG essentially requires the rotor position and speed information. For this purpose, usually shaft mounted speed and position sensors are used, resulting into additional cost and complexity of the system. In order to eliminate the sensors and their associated problems, a novel adaptive networkbased fuzzy-inference system (ANFIS) architecture is proposed for rotor position and speed estimation over wide range of speed operation. The ANFIS architecture has well known advantages of modeling a highly non-linear system, as it combines the capability of fuzzy reasoning in handling the uncertainties and capability of artificial neural network (ANN) in learning from processes. Thus, the ANFIS is used to develop an adaptive model of variable speed PMSG under highly uncertain operating conditions, which also automatically compensates any variation in parameters such as inductance, resistance etc. An error gradient based dynamic back propagation method has been used for the on-line tuning of ANFIS architecture. In the proposed work a PMSG based WECS is modeled for both isolated and grid connected system. In the isolated WECS operation, a wind-battery hybrid system is presented. The battery energy storage system (BESS) in the isolated system is used to absorb the wind power fluctuations and varying load demand. In grid connected system, the fault ride through capability of WECS is demonstrated under grid voltage sag/swell conditions. Another objective is to develop an advance controller for grid side inverter. Since the inverter works under highly fluctuating operating conditions, {{it is not possible to}} set the optimal value of gains for the conventional proportional-integral (PI) regulator. This may lead to false operation of inverter. To alleviate this problem an adaptive neurofuzzy controller is developed, which has well known advantages in modeling and control of a highly non-linear system. The main objective is to achieve smooth operation of grid side inverter, where the conventional PI controller may fail due to the rapid change in the dynamics of the overall system. The combined capability of neuro-fuzzy controller in handling the uncertainties and learning from the processes is proved to be advantageous while controlling the inverter under fluctuating operating conditions. Moreover, in the proposed work, the grid side inverter rating is also optimally utilized by incorporating the power quality improvement features. Normally, the grid interfacing inverter has very low utilization factor 20 - 30...|$|R
