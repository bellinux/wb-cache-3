40|$|Abstract: Complexity {{and large}} size of {{contemporary}} control, communication, and computer systems impose strong challenges to methods of their mathematical modelling, design, and testing. Classical approaches to their formal specification by exploiting theory of systems <b>on</b> <b>groups</b> of real numbers R and complex numbers C, {{often do not}} fulfill requirements of practice. For that reason, theory of systems <b>on</b> <b>groups</b> different from R and C has been developed. Differential operators and spectral (Fourier) analysis <b>on</b> <b>groups</b> play the same important role in such systems {{as in the case}} of systems modelled by signals defined on R and C. This paper first briefly reviews some aspects of research in system theory <b>on</b> <b>groups</b> and then presents an extension of the notion of Gibbs differentiation to matrixvalued functions <b>on</b> finite non-Abelian <b>groups...</b>|$|R

Topics covered include: topological and left topological groups, ultrafilter semigroups, local homomorphisms and automorphisms, subgroups and ideal structure of ßG, almost maximal spaces and projectives of finite semigroups, resolvability of groups. This is a self-contained book aimed at graduate students and researchers working in t...|$|R
