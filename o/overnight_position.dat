25|$|In {{northern}} Iraq {{in early}} March, a small reconnaissance team from M Squadron of the British Special Boat Service mounted on Honda ATVs inserted into Iraq from Jordan, its first {{mission was to}} conduct reconnaissance of an Iraqi air base at al-Sahara. The team was compromised by an anti-special forces Fedayeen unit and barely escaped thanks to a U.S. F-15E that flew air cover for the team and the bravery of an RAF Chinook that extracted the team under the Fedayeen's 'noses'. A second larger SBS operation was launched by M Squadron in full strength in a mix of land rovers and ATVs into northern Iraq from H-2 airbase, the objective was to locate, make contact and take the surrender of the Iraqi 5th Army Corps somewhere past Tikrit and to survey and mark viable temporary landing zones for follow-on forces. However the Squadron was compromised by a goat herder; the SBS drove for several days whilst unknown to them anti-special forces Fedayeen units followed them. At an <b>overnight</b> <b>position</b> near Mosul, the Fedayeen ambushed the Squadron with DShK heavy machine guns and RPGs, the SBS returned fire and began taking fire from a T-72, the Squadron scattered and escaped the well-constructed trap. A number of Land Rovers became bogged down in a nearby wadi, so they mined the vehicles and abandoned them - though several did not detonate and were captured and exhibited on Iraqi television. The SBS was now in three distinct groups: one with several operational Land Rovers was being pursued by the Iraqi hunter force, a second mainly equipped with ATVs was hunkered down and trying to arrange extraction, the third with just 2 operators on an ATV raced for the Syrian border. The first group tried to call in coalition strike aircraft but the aircraft couldn't identify friendly forces because the SBS were not equipped with infra-red strobes - although their vehicles did have Blue Force Tracker units, they eventually made it to an emergency rendezvous point and were extracted by a RAF Chinook. The second group was also extracted by an RAF Chinook and the third group made it to Syria and was held there until their release was negotiated, there were no SBS casualties.|$|E

40|$|The views {{expressed}} in this paper {{are those of the}} author. No responsibility for them should be attributed to the Bank of Canada. iii Dealers in foreign exchange (FX) markets provide intraday liquidity to market participants by standing ready to buy and sell currencies at their posted bid and o¤er quotes. They are also key participants in the provision of overnight, or interday, liquidity. To hold an unde-sired position, dealers demand compensation in terms of higher exchange rate returns either directly or indirectly via the private information learned from order ow. As intermediaries in the decentralized FX market, they are able to learn about the order ow of various market participants which can be informative about future movements in the exchange rate. Dealers in nancial institutions trade in multiple price-correlated markets, and look for opportuni-ties to speculate, or reduce any undesired risky positions, across markets. I illustrate an interdependent relationship between the <b>overnight</b> <b>positions</b> of non- 8 ̆ 5 nancial customers and dealers across markets. While dealers provide liquidity to foreign 8 ̆ 5 nancial customers, they are resistant to providing liquidity when central banks intervene.

40|$|Time-varying {{correlation}} {{of the stock}} market returns across countries in the context of international investments has been well researched in the literature in last few years. It has also been recognized that there is “volatility effect in correlation”, as the stock return correlations tend to rise on high-volatility days. Recent research has however, highlighted the pitfalls of using sample correlation for comparison, particularly when the conditional volatility across samples is not same. It has been shown that the sample {{correlation of}} two independent random variables is expected to rise when the conditional volatility of the variables is high and vice-versa, even if the unconditional correlation between them is constant. Empirically, it has been long well known that the overnight (closed-market) stock returns are less volatile than the open-market returns. Making use of this regularity, we test whether the stock returns correlation are higher during trading or non-trading hours. Using five years’ daily returns of 30 constituent stocks of Sensitive Index (Sensex) of The Stock Exchange, Mumbai, we find that almost all the pair-wise closed market stock return correlations are higher than the open market correlations despite lower volatility of the closed market returns. These results are further reinforced after using the univariate and bivariate conditional volatility models. Higher closed market stock return correlations are consistent with the possibility that information, which arrives during non-trading, is more on common factors. Arrival of information on common factors would imply higher stock return correlations during non-trading hours. This has implication for managing risks associated with any stock portfolio, as the diversification benefits might be over-estimated for <b>overnight</b> <b>positions</b> and under-estimated during trading hours if daily close-to-close returns are used to estimate variance-covariance matrix. ...|$|R
