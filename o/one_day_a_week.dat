5|$|In 1907, the women's {{auxiliary}} was founded; until then, though seating was mixed, {{women had}} little {{say in the}} running of the synagogue. That year the congregation had 110 member families and annual revenues of $9,259.55 (today $). The congregational school, which held classes <b>one</b> <b>day</b> <b>a</b> <b>week,</b> had 15 teachers and 200 students.|$|E
5|$|Richard Fetherston had {{established}} a Baby Health Center in Prahran in 1920 that provided post-natal care. His experience soon showed that his workload would be greatly reduced if ante natal care were provided, with mothers being monitored throughout their pregnancies. He asked Mary if she {{would be willing to}} establish such a clinic, which would be open <b>one</b> <b>day</b> <b>a</b> <b>week.</b>|$|E
5|$|In May 1976, the company's {{long-established}} route between Guildford and Peaslake {{was extended}} to Cranleigh via Ewhurst, and a once-daily schoolday service to and from The Haven, the first bus route to serve the community, was introduced. A number of service changes saw Tillingbourne vehicles operating to Croydon and Chichester <b>one</b> <b>day</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> each by 1977, although both were withdrawn after three years. The service to Colgate was withdrawn and replaced by a local half-hourly route in Horsham in 1979. In September 1980, the company moved depots again to a larger site in Cranleigh.|$|E

5|$|As a hermit, Withers {{lives in}} solitude. He does not own {{a car or}} television; he gets his news from {{the people around him}} and gets around on a bicycle that he found, broken, {{on the side of the}} road. Though he has an open-door policy for people that come to visit him, he himself visits family only twice a year. He does have a computer, which he uses to keep in touch with other hermits via email. To earn his food and {{clothing}} allowance, which amounts to less than $5,500 per year, Withers makes pottery to sell and works <b>one</b> <b>day</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> for a scientific-instrument company. At the end of each year, he donates any funds that remain to charity.|$|E
5|$|While some {{ships and}} units such as No 49 Squadron {{returned}} to the UK, most personnel had to remain on Christmas Island. The Minister of Supply gave assurances that no personnel would have {{to remain on the}} island {{for more than a year}} unless absolutely necessary, in which case home leave would be given. To maintain morale, units were given periodic briefings on the importance of their work. Junior officers took a keen interest in the welfare of the men and their families at home, since they were not permitted to bring them to the island. An efficient mail system was maintained to allow them to keep in contact. The quality of Army rations was better than at any other British base. The men were given <b>one</b> <b>day</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> off work, and sports such as soccer, cricket, tennis, volleyball sailing, fishing and water skiing were organised. Leave was provided that could be taken in Fiji, Hawaii or the Gilbert Islands. To relieve the monotony, some Army personnel ashore exchanged places with some Navy personnel afloat. A Christmas Island Broadcasting Service was established with nightly radio programs.|$|E

25|$|In 1918, under Kornfeld's leadership, the congregational school held classes <b>one</b> <b>day</b> <b>a</b> <b>week,</b> and had six {{teachers}} and ten students.

25|$|In March 2010, {{a number}} of the routes around Hatfield and Welwyn Garden City, that only ran {{a couple of times a}} day or on <b>one</b> <b>day</b> <b>a</b> <b>week,</b> were lost to Sullivan Buses.

The 694 service, introduced in September 2009 as a park and ride service between College Lane and Stanborough Lakes in WGC, was axed completely.|$|E
25|$|Another {{alternative}} {{considered by}} the commission, and promoted by Assemblyman Richard Brodsky, was to restrict access into the congestion zone <b>one</b> <b>day</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> based on the last digits of the license plates.

25|$|LCBL field {{managers}} {{are among the}} youngest in any summer college baseball league.

However, youth or inexperience is not a viable excuse for not commanding the dugout. The interview process is thorough and each must take their leadership duties very seriously. Upon being hired, managers select their assistant coach and set aside at least <b>one</b> <b>day</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> for practice time.|$|E
25|$|Through {{an adult}} class at a Methodist church {{he learned of}} the Casa de Todos clinic in Tijuana, Mexico, in about 1960. He {{reflected}} on the experience in a 1967 article. There {{he was able to}} save the lives of two children during a period he volunteered <b>one</b> <b>day</b> <b>a</b> <b>week.</b> But he found he needed to do something more substantial than just be one doctor in one place of need. He initiated Project Concern to organize the work and it was incorporated in 1961. He first focused on Casa de Todos.|$|E
25|$|Until recently, {{there was}} a daily ferry (an ex-fishing boat) {{connecting}} Brava and Fogo. Since January 2011, Brava can be reached from Praia (and Fogo) almost exclusively via the passenger/cargo ferry, the Kriola. The Kriola {{is the first of}} 's fleet of inter-island catamarans and connects the Sotavento islands of Santiago, Fogo, and Brava. The Kriola typically leaves Furna, its home port, at 7:30 AM on days of operation and returns between 9:30 and 11 PM, depending on the day. The route is typically BRAVA-FOGO-SANTIAGO-FOGO-BRAVA; at least <b>one</b> <b>day</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> it makes a BRAVA-FOGO-BRAVA run. Travel time between Brava and Fogo is approximately 0:40 and approximately 3:30 between Fogo and Santiago (Praia).|$|E

25|$|Paramus, {{along with}} the rest of Bergen County, has strict blue laws {{preventing}} stores selling non-food items from opening on Sundays. Although it started as a religious observance, it is kept on the books due to a desire of the residents of Paramus to have <b>one</b> <b>day</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> when traffic is tolerable in the town. This law was called into question when a BJ's Wholesale Club opened at the Routes 4/17 junction. BJ's was allowed to open on Sundays, but is only allowed to sell food and basic necessities. The store has been structured to restrict access to items that cannot be purchased on Sunday. Paramus has its own blue laws that are significantly more restrictive than those in effect in other communities in Bergen County. It is one of the last places in the United States to have such an extensive blue law.|$|E
25|$|Several {{companies}} {{targeted by}} SHAC in the UK obtained injunctions. These include HLS itself, Chiron UK, Phytopharm, Daiichi UK, Asahi Glass, Eisai, Yamanouchi Pharma, Sankyo Pharma, and BOC. The injunctions compelled SHAC to print the injunction on their website, so that SHAC's action targets were juxtaposed with a legal notification {{that there was}} a 50-yard exclusion zone around the homes of employees and places of business. Protest outside HLS itself was allowed to occur <b>one</b> <b>day</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> with a police presence. HLS tried but failed in June 2004 to obtain a permanent injunction against SHAC. SHAC's argument against the enforceability of such injunctions was that, despite having hundreds of supporters, a website, mailing address, telephone information hotline, mailing list, and bank account, it does not exist as a corporate or charitable body, and therefore cannot prevent its supporters from taking action against HLS.|$|E
25|$|Dijkstra joined Burroughs Corporation, {{a company}} known {{at that time}} for the {{production}} of computers based on an innovative hardware architecture, as its Research Fellow in August 1973. His duties consisted of visiting some of the company's research centers a few times a year and carrying on his own research, which he did in the smallest Burroughs research facility, namely, his study {{on the second floor of}} his house in Nuenen. In fact, Dijkstra was the only research fellow of Burroughs Corporation and worked for it from home, occasionally travelling to its branches in the United States. As a result, he reduced his appointment at the university to <b>one</b> <b>day</b> <b>a</b> <b>week.</b> That day, Tuesday, soon became known as the day of the famous 'Tuesday Afternoon Club', a seminar during which he discussed with his colleagues scientific articles, looking at all aspects – notation, organisation, presentation, language, content, etc. Shortly after he moved in 1984 to the University of Texas at Austin (USA), a new 'branch' of the Tuesday Afternoon Club emerged in Austin.|$|E
