5|$|Black Moshannon Creek {{is in the}} West Branch Susquehanna River {{drainage}} basin, whose earliest recorded inhabitants {{were the}} Iroquoian-speaking Susquehannocks. They were a matriarchial society that lived in large long houses in stockaded villages. Decimated by disease and warfare with the Five Nations of the Iroquois, by 1675 they had died out, moved away, or been assimilated into <b>other</b> <b>tribes.</b>|$|E
5|$|Displaced Native Americans {{from the}} Californian coast {{moved to the}} Sierra Nevada during the early-to-mid-19th century, {{bringing}} with them their knowledge of Spanish food, technology, and clothing. Joining forces with the <b>other</b> <b>tribes</b> in the area, they raided land grant ranchos on the coast and drove herds of horses to the Sierra, where horse meat became a major new food source.|$|E
5|$|In the {{intervening}} time, through contact with <b>other</b> <b>tribes</b> that had more European contact, the Yavapai began to adopt certain European practices. They raised some livestock and planted crops, also adopting some modern tools and weaponry. In a syncretic way, they adopted elements of Christianity. An estimated 25% {{of the population}} {{died as a result}} of smallpox in the 17th and 18th centuries, smaller losses than for some tribes, but substantial enough to disrupt their societies. With the use of guns and other weapons, they began to change methods of warfare, diplomacy, and trade. They used livestock raiding, either from <b>other</b> <b>tribes</b> such as the Maricopa, or from Spanish settlements to their south, to supplement their economy. They often acquired human captives in raids, whom they traded as slaves to Spaniards in exchange for European goods.|$|E

5|$|The park {{is in the}} Susquehanna River {{drainage}} basin, {{the earliest}} recorded inhabitants of which were the Iroquoian-speaking Susquehannocks. They were a matriarchal society that lived in stockaded villages of large longhouses, but their numbers were greatly reduced by disease and warfare with the Five Nations of the Iroquois, and by 1675they had died out, moved away, or been assimilated into <b>other</b> <b>tribes.</b>|$|E
5|$|As for the Harii, {{quite apart}} from their strength, which exceeds that of the <b>other</b> <b>tribes</b> I have just listed, they pander to their innate savagery by skill and timing: with black shields and painted bodies, they choose dark nights to fight, and by means of terror and shadow of a ghostly army they cause panic, since no enemy can bear a sight so {{unexpected}} and hellish; in every battle the eyes {{are the first to}} be conquered.|$|E

Their numbers were greatly reduced by disease and warfare with the Five Nations of the Iroquois, and by 1675they had died out, moved away, or been assimilated into <b>other</b> <b>tribes.</b> After this, the lands of the Susquehanna valley were under the nominal control of the Iroquois, who encouraged displaced tribes from the east to settle there, including the Shawnee and Lenape (or Delaware).|$|E
5|$|In West Africa, {{the sons}} and daughters of Yoruba kings were {{traditionally}} given in marriage to their fellow royals as a matter of dynastic policy. Sometimes these marriages would involve members of <b>other</b> <b>tribes.</b> Erinwinde of Benin, for example, was taken as a wife by the Oba Oranyan of Oyo during his time as governor of Benin. Their son Eweka went on to give birth to the dynasty that rules the Kingdom of Benin today.|$|E

5|$|Modern-day Manitoba was {{inhabited}} by the First Nations people {{shortly after the}} last ice age glaciers retreated in the southwest about 10,000 years ago; the first exposed land was the Turtle Mountain area. The Ojibwe, Cree, Dene, Sioux, Mandan, and Assiniboine peoples founded settlements, and <b>other</b> <b>tribes</b> entered the area to trade. In Northern Manitoba, quartz was mined to make arrowheads. The first farming in Manitoba was along the Red River, where corn and other seed crops were planted before contact with Europeans.|$|E
5|$|Next Nuaym went to Abu Sufyan, the Confederate leader, warning {{him that}} the Qurayza had {{defected}} to Muhammad. He stated that the tribe intended to ask the Confederacy for hostages, ostensibly in return for cooperation, but really to hand over to Muhammad. Thus the Confederacy should not give a single man as hostage. Nuaym repeated the same message to <b>other</b> <b>tribes</b> in the Confederacy.|$|E
5|$|<b>Other</b> <b>tribes</b> {{included}} the Banu Murra, with 400 men led by Hars ibn Auf Murri, and the Banu Shuja, with 700 men led by Sufyan ibn Abd Shams.

5|$|Sarcoscypha coccinea {{was used}} as a {{medicinal}} fungus by the Oneida Indians, and possibly by <b>other</b> <b>tribes</b> of the Iroquois Six Nations. The fungus, after being dried and ground up into a powder, was applied as a styptic, particularly to the navels of newborn children that were not healing properly after the umbilical cord had been severed. Pulverized fruit bodies were also kept under bandages made of soft-tanned deerskin. In Scarborough, England, the fruit bodies used to be arranged with moss and leaves and sold as a table decoration.|$|E
5|$|The {{case has}} been cited in {{numerous}} law reviews. Some of these were critical of the majority approach, stating that it went beyond the plain {{meaning of the text}} to open up the federal government to liability where none existed. Other reviews merely analyzed the decision and how it affected government-tribe trust cases. Alex Tallchief Skibine opined that the case was almost unique, and he did not foresee that it would be significant for <b>other</b> <b>tribes.</b>|$|E
50|$|Immunity Challenge: The two tribes {{start from}} {{opposite}} sides of an obstacle course that stretches over land and sea. Every castaway is attached to their tribe by their harness and equipped with a sandbag holding 10% of their body weight. Traversing the obstacle course the tribes try and catch the <b>other</b> <b>tribe.</b> At two quit stops along the looping obstacle course, the castaways can quit the challenge, by giving their sandbag to someone else and then unclipping their harness from the tribe. Tribe who catches the <b>other</b> <b>tribe,</b> wins Immunity.|$|R
50|$|The 20 contestants were {{assigned}} tribes {{at the start}} of the game and, based only on appearances, were instructed to elect a leader who would make critical decisions at challenges for the first half of the game. The leader of the tribe that won the reward challenge would also choose a member of their tribe to observe the <b>other</b> <b>tribe</b> for a day, receiving a clue to the hidden immunity idol at the <b>other</b> <b>tribe's</b> camp. Mick was chosen as Foa Foa's leader, and Russell S. as Galu's.|$|R
5000|$|There {{were two}} tribes in Brazil: a {{peaceful}} tribe, and a warlike one. The warlike tribe would repeatedly attack the peaceful tribe, {{who had no}} way of defending themselves. One day, during an attack, a young boy named [...] "Maculelê" [...] picked up a pair of sticks and fought off the <b>other</b> <b>tribe.</b> The <b>other</b> <b>tribe</b> never attacked again. The boy didn't manage to fight them off completely, but did die trying. His home tribe then made a mock combat dance using sticks and named the dance [...] "Maculelê" [...] in his honor and memory.|$|R

5|$|Yahweh gave materialistic {{explanations}} of the Garden of Eden, a large laboratory {{that was based on}} an artificially constructed continent; Noah's Ark, a spaceship that preserved DNA that was used to resurrect animals through cloning; the Tower of Babel, a rocket that was supposed to reach the creators' planet; and the Great Flood, the byproduct of a nuclear missile explosion that the Elohim sent. After tidal wave floods following the explosions receded, Elohim scattered the Israelites and had them speak the language of <b>other</b> <b>tribes.</b>|$|E
5|$|After this, {{the lands}} of the West Branch Susquehanna River valley were under the nominal control of the Iroquois. They lived in long houses, {{primarily}} {{in what is now}} New York, and had a strong confederacy which gave them power beyond their numbers. The Iroquois and <b>other</b> <b>tribes</b> used the Pine Creek Path through the gorge, traveling between a path on the Genesee River in modern New York in the north, and the Great Shamokin Path along the West Branch Susquehanna River in the south. The Seneca tribe of the Iroquois believed that the Pine Creek Gorge was sacred land and never established a permanent settlement there, though they did use the path through the gorge and had seasonal hunting camps along it.|$|E
