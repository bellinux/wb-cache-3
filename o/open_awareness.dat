40|$|<b>Open</b> <b>awareness</b> and {{communication}} in {{death and dying}} have become important aspects in caring {{for people who are}} terminally ill. This change began in the 1960 s and has been driven by social and ideological factors, especially in highly individualistic societies such as the US and the UK. While this is the preferred interaction within palliative care, <b>open</b> <b>awareness</b> {{and communication}} about death and dying can be resisted in some societies where families seek to protect their relative from the truth of a terminal illness. This article considers some attitudes to <b>open</b> <b>awareness</b> and communication in Ireland from recent research and a popular radio talk programme.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{primarily}} based upon unstructiared interviews with nurses {{about their experiences}} of and attitudes towards nursing the dying. The main focus of the thesis is upon nursing the long term dying within a general hospital {{as seen from the}} nurse's viewpoint. The research is based upon the work of Glaser and Strauss which identified patterns of communication between health care workers and dying patients as being crucial to the experiences of the dying, and is broadly supportive of their findings. Many of the nurses interviewed expressed a preference for nursing dying patients who were aware of their dying. However, despite this preference for 'openness' most nurses reported difficulty in achieving this situation. Nursing the dying in an <b>open</b> <b>awareness</b> context was associated with enotional involvonent with the dying, and with satisfaction from such nursing care. It is argued that <b>open</b> <b>awareness</b> and good nursing care of the terminally ill is more likely to occur under a system of individualized patient care which is coupled with team support of individual nurses. The other features which affect the likelihood of <b>open</b> <b>awareness</b> developing are patient characteristics, doctors' views about disclosure, and individual characteristics of nurses...|$|E
40|$|Analysis of {{a subset}} of data from a survey of 3696 relatives, friends and others who knew a sample of people dying in 1990 who lived in 20 areas of the United Kingdom (the Regional Study of Care for the Dying) is reported. Using the {{typology}} of awareness contexts developed by Glaser and Strauss [(1965) Awareness of Dying, Aldine, Chicago], the prevalence of different awareness contexts is described and compared with an earlier survey done in 1969. <b>Open</b> <b>awareness</b> of dying, where both the dying person and the respondent knew that the person was dying, is the most prevalent awareness context. This is particularly so in cancer and represents a change since 1969 when closed awareness (where the respondent knows, but the dying person does not) was more common. The characteristics of those dying in open and closed awareness contexts are then compared, suggesting that having cancer, not being mentally confused, having a respondent who knew {{for some time that}} the person was dying, and being of higher social class are independently predictive of full <b>open</b> <b>awareness,</b> a condition marked both by knowledge of dying, and a value commitment towards openness. Compared with people in closed awareness, people dying in full awareness are more able to plan their dying careers, so that they and their respondents are more satisfied with the degree of choice over the place of death, {{they are less likely to}} die alone, and are more likely to die in their own homes. Additionally, these individuals are more likely to have spoken of their wishes for euthanasia, another indicator of their desire to control the manner and timing of death. If dying from cancer, people in full <b>open</b> <b>awareness</b> are more likely to have received hospice care. It is suggested that underlying these patterns, and in contrast with some other cultures where awareness of dying is seen as less desirable, people dying in Anglophone countries are particularly concerned to maintain control over projects of self-identity. Their approach to death is a reflection of this individualism. death terminal care awareness hospice euthanasia...|$|E

40|$|Background: UK {{palliative care}} policy and {{philosophy}} endorse <b>open</b> <b>awareness,</b> where all parties {{acknowledge that the}} patient's death is approaching. Perceived benefits of making patients aware of their prognosis include being able to plan a variety of activities, so arguably death occurs more in keeping with their wishes. Aim: To explore if and how information about a transition to palliative care was communicated to patients discharged from hospital who fulfilled standardised criteria for palliative care need. Literature review: Despite evidence of a link between encouraging people to talk about dying and an improved dying experience, persistent barriers exist to entering a context of <b>open</b> <b>awareness.</b> Method: Semi-structured {{interviews were conducted with}} 15 patients and three family carers, 3 - 6 months after discharge from hospital. A thematic analysis was undertaken. Results: Despite indications that participants might be nearing the end of their lives, most were unaware of their prognosis and showed little insight into what they could expect from the trajectory of their disease. Discussion: Patients can be reluctant to gain knowledge that requires them to face the imminence of death. This can create tensions for nurses about how they relate to and communicate with patients facing incurable illnesses. Conclusion: To ensure timely access to palliative care, new and innovative ways of delivering palliative care are needed, which do not rely on the ideologically based assumption that awareness can and should be encouraged in all cases...|$|E

40|$|Within our {{contemporary}} ‘cultures of seduction’, {{the anxiety of}} temptation assumes an endemic yet trivialised presence. For both Augustine and Kierkegaard, however, ‘temptation’ performs a decisive role in the de/construction of the self’s relation to God, to others, and to itself. Temptation helps to <b>open</b> <b>awareness</b> of an estranged inner space of despair and self-alienation; while also giving rise to a consciousness of the longing for healing by Divine Grace. Reading through the “intersections” between Augustine’s Confessions and Kierkegaard’s development of the dialectical relationship between “temptation” (Fristelse) and “spiritual trial” (Anfægtelse), this essay proposes a constructive theological account {{of the role of}} tentatio in the narrative of ‘the confessing self’. In doing so I explore how the language of seduction is commensurate with the erotic longing of the restless self: how the self comes to itself through the confession of its seduction by “lower” and “higher” forms of desire before God. Through Augustine and Kierkegaard, I suggest a theology of ‘temptation’ and ‘spiritual trial’ which offers a critical alternative to the banality of temptation evident in {{our contemporary}} cultures of seduction...|$|E
40|$|Extract] Have {{you ever}} {{experienced}} a stone or rock in your sneaker/runner? Has it left you feeling uncomfortable? Maybe even angry or annoyed for making you stop? Or, might you have ignored it, lucky {{enough not to}} have a blister later? Change of metaphor now - consider the stone/rock as a social or cultural issue, particular to physical and health educators that could (should) have impact on pedagogy. Such issues might include ethnicity, culture, gender, class, sexuality and (dis) ability that interlace with the discourses of social justice and inclusion. Ellen Singleton and Aniko Varpalotai as editors of this text have coordinated fifteen chapters to present provocative and sometimes disquieting insight into such issues that face individuals, schools and communities. In their words (2006, p. ix), "each chapter represents the many 'stones' that trouble us in our day-to-day teaching and interaction with students". what is assumed in this is that teachers do recognise the "stones", although we know several either don't see them and operate via routined practices, or choose to ignore. However, this text aims to develop a more <b>open</b> <b>awareness</b> of these critical pedagogical issues for student teachers...|$|E
40|$|Facilitating a ‘good’ {{death is}} a central goal for hospices and palliative care organisations. The key {{features}} of such a death include an acceptance of death, an <b>open</b> <b>awareness</b> of and communication about death, the settling of practical and interpersonal business, the reduction of suffering and pain, and the enhancement of autonomy, choice and control. Yet deaths are inherently neither good nor bad; they require cultural labour to be ‘made over’ as good. Drawing on media accounts of the controversial death of UK reality television star Jade Goody, and building on existing analyses of her death, we examine how cultural discourses actively work to construct deaths as good or bad and to position the dying and those witnessing their death as morally accountable. By constructing Goody as bravely breaking social taboos by openly acknowledging death, by contextualising her dying as occurring {{at the end of}} a life well lived and by emphasising biographical continuity and agency, newspaper accounts serve to position themselves as educative rather than exploitative, and readers as information-seekers rather than ghoulishly voyeuristic. We argue that popular culture offers moral instruction in dying well which resonates with the messages from palliative care...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} how {{doctors and patients}} diagnosed with advanced incurable cancer experienced the disclosure of bad news. The intention was to gain contrasting perspectives of the processes involved in oncology consultations. Sixteen doctors and 16 patients from a cancer centre in the UK participated in the study. A series of consultations were observed and audio recorded, and the perspectives of doctors, patients and relatives were investigated through semi-structured interviews. Participants were invited to describe how they experienced and felt about the disclosure of information {{over a period of}} time following a specific consultation. Analysis was based on a constant comparative method. This research suggests that patients control what they do or do not do with information to meet their own needs and objectives, but doctors do not necessarily appreciate this. Doctors do not always prepare patients for what is happening to them in an active <b>open</b> <b>awareness</b> context, and this can be stressful for some patients. The results indicate that communication is not just about one person making decisions. They also indicate that in many cases more success could be gained from finding out how patients prefer to manage and control the exchange of bad news, at different points, through their care pathway...|$|E
40|$|Since the 1960 s {{communication}} and awareness about dying in modern western societies have been topics for debate, with {{a considerable amount}} of literature on the need for open {{communication and}} the strategies which can be used by health professionals to improve their communication with patients facing a terminal prognosis. Despite the difficulties of comparing studies using different methodologies and the additional problems of ascertaining patients' knowledge and awareness about their impending deaths, the trend is clear. In advanced industrial societies there is increasing evidence that doctors have shifted from a policy of ‘withholding’ to a policy of ‘revealing’ to the patient his or her terminal prognosis. This change in medical practice is further supported by other data which show an increase in the percentage of those patients who were aware they were dying from chronic diseases, especially cancer. However, despite the perceived trend towards open disclosure of the patient's terminal illness, recent studies have suggested that in their daily encounters with dying patients health workers employ ‘conditional’ rather than ‘full open disclosure’. Such moderating strategies in discussing the patient's prognosis may be employed despite <b>open</b> <b>awareness</b> of a patient's prognosis. This paper examines this apparent paradox by analysing the complex tensions and conflicts of such communication through a discussion of existing literature on modes of communication and patient awareness...|$|E
40|$|The {{inspiration}} {{for this project}} was profoundly influenced by a publication written by P. Michell and his expert collaborators (1998). It masterfully introduces the foundations to the burgeoning field of Trust. It covers all aspects associated with trust, identifying twenty-two variables through {{the investigation of the}} relevant literature. Here the researchers examined the correlation between trust and the variables by conducting a questionnaire to a group of managers and other significant employees. The participants included six prestigious UK companies: · Banks - Barclays and TSB · Department stores - Marks and Spencer and Littlewoods · Manufacturers of domestic appliances - Hoover and Philips The enthusiastic responses revealed that most of the twenty-two variables confirmed the correlation to trust. The consequence of the rapid growth of e-commerce has led to an escalation in online retailers. However, this has <b>opened</b> <b>awareness</b> to specific issues of privacy and security amongst internet shoppers whose reluctance and reticence seemingly affects trust towards online retailers. In my proposed scheme, we used Michell et al research on trust as our model system, which was dedicated towards exploring the extent of consumer trust online between two countries, namely the United Kingdom (UK) and Malaysia. The author designed and formulated a questionnaire based around the twenty-two variables that comprises trust. The questionnaire was setup online, and responses were solicited and compiled via email invitations to e-commerce groups and forums in both the UK and Malaysia. The respondents were frequent users of the internet facilities and their experience revealed quantitative facts and figures having high explanatory powers in both countries by the high adjusted R 2 after regressions of the variables in the four dimensions. The structure and framework was designed to extricate current attitudes of the internet users towards trust in online retailers between the two countries. Despite time limitations to carry out the project to its full potential, the outcome is encouragingly revealing in terms of comparative trust equations between the countries namely United Kingdom and Malaysia. The author concludes that trust in terms of attitudes and ethnicity needs to be explored further in the growing and changing acceptance of the diminishing use of currency and the projected use of e-financing which is the new proxy to the flexible plastic card...|$|R
