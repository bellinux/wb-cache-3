5|$|The {{period between}} Stillman's Run and the Battle <b>of</b> <b>Apple</b> River Fort {{was filled with}} war-related {{activity}} and events. A series of attacks at Buffalo Grove, the Plum River settlement, Fort Blue Mounds and the war's most famous incident, the Indian Creek massacre, all took place between mid-May and late June 1832. The week preceding the Battle <b>of</b> <b>Apple</b> River Fort was an important turning point for the militia: between June 16‚Äì18 two key battles, one at Waddams Grove and the other at Horseshoe Bend, {{played a key role}} in changing public perception about the militia after its defeat at Stillman's Run.|$|E
5000|$|For example, suppose 100% <b>of</b> <b>apples</b> are {{observed}} to be red in summer.

5|$|Although {{considered}} disgusting in Western culture, cockroaches are {{eaten in}} many places around the world.

5|$|One form <b>of</b> <b>apple</b> allergy, {{often found}} in {{northern}} Europe, is called birch-apple syndrome, and is found in people who are also allergic to birch pollen. Allergic reactions are triggered by a protein in apples {{that is similar to}} birch pollen, and people affected by this protein can also develop allergies to other fruits, nuts, and vegetables. Reactions, which entail oral allergy syndrome (OAS), generally involve itching and inflammation of the mouth and throat, but in rare cases can also include life-threatening anaphylaxis. This reaction only occurs when raw fruit is consumed‚Äîthe allergen is neutralized in the cooking process. The variety <b>of</b> <b>apple,</b> maturity and storage conditions can change the amount of allergen present in individual fruits. Long storage times can increase the amount of proteins that cause birch-apple syndrome.|$|E
