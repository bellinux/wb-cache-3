5|$|An example {{he gives}} of the {{difficulty}} of obtaining missing data from drug companies is that of <b>oseltamivir</b> (Tamiflu), manufactured by Roche to reduce the complications of bird flu. Governments spent billions of pounds stockpiling this, based in large part on a meta-analysis that was funded by the industry. Bad Pharma charts the efforts of independent researchers, particularly Tom Jefferson of the Cochrane Collaboration Respiratory Group, to gain access to information about the drug.|$|E
5|$|Frequent {{hand washing}} {{reduces the risk}} of viral spread. Wearing a {{surgical}} mask is also useful. Yearly vaccinations against influenza are recommended by the World Health Organization for those at high risk. The vaccine is usually effective against three or four types of influenza. It is usually well tolerated. A vaccine made for one year may not be useful in the following year, since the virus evolves rapidly. Antiviral drugs such as the neuraminidase inhibitor <b>oseltamivir,</b> among others, have been used to treat influenza. Their benefits in those who are otherwise healthy {{do not appear to be}} greater than their risks. No benefit has been found in those with other health problems.|$|E
25|$|New Zealand {{has had a}} {{well-developed}} Influenza Pandemic {{action plan}} since 2006. Following this plan New Zealand immediately upgraded its influenza pandemic alert status to code yellow. The national stockpile of 1.4million doses of <b>oseltamivir</b> was released to regional health authorities. The initial response as specified in the Pandemic Action Plan is a policy of border control and cluster control via voluntary quarantine and treatment of contacts with <b>oseltamivir.</b>|$|E
25|$|There {{also is the}} {{potential}} of viruses to evolve drug resistance. Some H5N1-infected persons treated with <b>oseltamivir</b> have developed resistant strains of that virus.|$|E
25|$|Patients who are {{vaccinated against}} {{streptococcus}} pneumoniae, health professionals, nursing-home residents and pregnant {{women should be}} vaccinated annually against influenza. During an outbreak, drugs such as amantadine, rimantadine, zanamivir and <b>oseltamivir</b> have been demonstrated to prevent influenza.|$|E
25|$|A study {{published}} in 2009 in Nature Biotechnology emphasized {{the urgent need for}} augmentation of <b>oseltamivir</b> (Tamiflu®) stockpiles with additional antiviral drugs including zanamivir (Relenza®). This finding was based on a performance evaluation of these drugs supposing the 2009 H1N1 'Swine Flu' neuraminidase (NA) were to acquire the Tamiflu-resistance (His274Tyr) mutation which is currently widespread in seasonal H1N1 strains.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two groups}} of {{antiviral}} drugs available for the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza neuraminidase inhibitors such as <b>Oseltamivir</b> (trade name Tamiflu) and Zanamivir (trade name Relenza) as well as adamantanes such as amantadine and rimantadine. Due to {{the high rate of}} side effects and risk of antiviral resistance, use of adamantanes to fight influenza is limited.|$|E
25|$|The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) inclusively {{recommends}} {{those six}} months and older to get a yearly vaccination to protect from influenza A viruses (H1N1) and (H3N2) and up to two influenza B viruses (depending on the vaccination). Comprehensive protection starts by ensuring vaccinations are current and complete. The three FDA-approved neuraminidase antiviral flu drugs available in the United States, recommended by the CDC, include: <b>oseltamivir</b> (Tamiflu®), zanamivir (Relenza®), and peramivir (Rapivab®).|$|E
25|$|The {{final stage}} in {{the life cycle of}} a virus is the release of {{completed}} viruses from the host cell, and this step has also been targeted by antiviral drug developers. Two drugs named zanamivir (Relenza) and <b>oseltamivir</b> (Tamiflu) that have been recently introduced to treat influenza prevent the release of viral particles by blocking a molecule named neuraminidase that is found on the surface of flu viruses, and also seems to be constant across a wide range of flu strains.|$|E
25|$|Antiviral {{treatment}} {{also creates}} selective pressure for {{the evolution of}} drug resistance in virus populations, and can thereby affect patterns of genetic diversity. Commonly, there is a fitness trade-off between faster replication of susceptible strains in the absence of antiviral treatment and faster replication of resistant strains in the presence of antivirals. Thus, ascertaining the level of antiviral pressure necessary to shift evolutionary outcomes is of public health importance. Phylodynamic approaches have been used to examine the spread of <b>Oseltamivir</b> resistance in influenza A/H1N1.|$|E
25|$|However, {{when the}} antigenicities of the seed strains and wild viruses do not match, {{vaccines}} fail {{to protect the}} vaccinees. In addition, {{even when they do}} match, escape mutants are often generated. Drugs available for the treatment of influenza include Amantadine and Rimantadine, which inhibit the uncoating of virions by interfering with M2, and <b>Oseltamivir</b> (marketed under the brand name Tamiflu), Zanamivir, and Peramivir, which inhibit the release of virions from infected cells by interfering with NA. However, escape mutants are often generated for the former drug and less frequently for the latter drug.|$|E
25|$|On 25 April 2009 ten {{students}} from Rangitoto College, a secondary school in North Shore City, Auckland, exhibited influenza symptoms on {{returning from a}} three-week language trip to Mexico. All 22 students and three accompanying teachers from the trip and those {{in close contact with}} them were placed in voluntary home isolation and treated with <b>oseltamivir.</b> The ten students tested positive for an influenza A virus, with three of them later testing positive for swine flu. The symptoms were reportedly mild and all affected individuals have since recovered.|$|E
25|$|There is no highly {{effective}} treatment for H5N1 flu, but <b>oseltamivir</b> (commercially marketed by Roche as Tamiflu), can sometimes inhibit the influenza virus from spreading inside the user's body. This drug {{has become a}} focus for some governments and organizations trying {{to prepare for a}} possible H5N1 pandemic. On April 20, 2006, Roche AG announced that a stockpile of three million treatment courses of Tamiflu are waiting at the disposal of the World Health Organization to be used in case of a flu pandemic; separately Roche donated two million courses to the WHO for use in developing nations that may be affected by such a pandemic but lack the ability to purchase large quantities of the drug.|$|E
25|$|From January 1997 until being {{sworn in}} as the 21st Secretary of Defense in January 2001, Rumsfeld served as Chairman of Gilead Sciences, Inc. Gilead Sciences is the {{developer}} of Tamiflu (<b>Oseltamivir),</b> which {{is used in the}} treatment of bird flu. As a result, Rumsfeld's holdings in the company grew significantly when avian flu became a subject of popular anxiety during his later term as Secretary of Defense. Following standard practice, Rumsfeld recused himself from any decisions involving Gilead, and he directed the Pentagon's General Counsel to issue instructions outlining what he could and could not be involved in if there were an avian flu pandemic and the Pentagon had to respond.|$|E
25|$|If {{a person}} becomes sick with swine flu, {{antiviral}} drugs {{can make the}} illness milder and make the patient feel better faster. They may also prevent serious flu complications. For treatment, antiviral drugs work best if started soon after getting sick (within two days of symptoms). Beside antivirals, supportive care {{at home or in}} a hospital focuses on controlling fevers, relieving pain and maintaining fluid balance, as well as identifying and treating any secondary infections or other medical problems. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the use of <b>oseltamivir</b> (Tamiflu) or zanamivir (Relenza) for the treatment and/or prevention of infection with swine influenza viruses; however, the majority of people infected with the virus make a full recovery without requiring medical attention or antiviral drugs. The virus isolated in the 2009 outbreak have been found resistant to amantadine and rimantadine.|$|E
2500|$|The {{genetic makeup}} of viruses is {{constantly}} changing and therefore may alter the virus {{resistant to the}} treatments currently available. Viruses can become resistant through spontaneous or intermittent mechanisms {{throughout the course of}} an antiviral treatment. Immunocompromised patients, more often than immunocompetent patients, hospitalized with pneumonia are at the highest risk of developing <b>oseltamivir</b> resistance during treatment. Subsequent to exposure to someone else with the flu, those who received <b>oseltamivir</b> for [...] "post-exposure prophylaxis" [...] are also at higher risk of resistance.|$|E

Its commercial production starts from the biomolecule shikimic acid harvested from Chinese star anise [...] with a limited worldwide supply. Due to its limited supply, searches for alternative synthetic routes preferably not requiring shikimic acid are underway and to date several such routes have been published. Control of stereochemistry is important: the molecule has three stereocenters and the sought-after isomer is only 1 of 8 stereoisomers.|$|E

2500|$|There {{have been}} anecdotal reports of <b>oseltamivir</b> (Tamiflu) {{reducing}} disease severity and hospitalization time in canine parvovirus infection. The drug may limit {{the ability of}} the virus to invade the crypt cells of the small intestine and decrease gastrointestinal bacteria colonization and toxin production. [...] However, due to the viral DNA replication pattern of parvovirus and the mechanism of action of <b>oseltamivir,</b> this medication has not shown to improve survival rates or shorten hospitalization stay. [...] Lastly, recombinant feline interferon omega (rFeIFN-ω), produced in silkworm larvae using a baculovirus vector, has been demonstrated by multiple studies to be an effective treatment.

2500|$|... 24 November: The H1N1 {{virus is}} the main {{circulating}} flu virus in France. The circulation of the virus accelerates: 22 persons had died in one week, from a total of 68 {{since the beginning of}} the pandemic. A first case of a mutation of the virus which is resistant to <b>oseltamivir</b> (Tamiflu) has been reported.|$|E
2500|$|Many nations, {{as well as}} the World Health Organization, {{are working}} to {{stockpile}} anti-viral drugs in preparation for a possible pandemic. <b>Oseltamivir</b> is the most commonly sought drug, since it is available in pill form.

In the final step the BOC group is removed with phosphoric acid and the <b>oseltamivir</b> phosphate 15 is formed.|$|E
2500|$|Animal and lab {{studies suggest}} that Relenza (zanamivir), {{which is in the}} same class of drugs as Tamiflu, may also be {{effective}} against H5N1. In a study performed on mice in 2000, [...] "zanamivir was shown to be efficacious in treating avian influenza viruses H9N2, H6N1, and H5N1 transmissible to mammals". In addition, mice studies suggest the combination of zanamivir, celecoxib and mesalazine looks promising producing a 50% survival rate compared to no survival in the placebo arm. While no one knows if zanamivir will be useful or not on a yet to exist pandemic strain of H5N1, it might be useful to stockpile zanamivir as well as <b>oseltamivir</b> {{in the event of an}} H5N1 influenza pandemic. Neither <b>oseltamivir</b> nor zanamivir can currently be manufactured in quantities that would be meaningful once efficient human transmission starts. In September, 2006, a WHO scientist announced that studies had confirmed cases of H5N1 strains resistant to Tamiflu and Amantadine. Tamiflu-resistant strains have also appeared in the EU, which remain sensitive to Relenza.|$|E
2500|$|On 3 May, Minister Palacio {{confirmed}} {{the first case}} in Colombia, in a 42-year-old, who had recently traveled to Mexico.

On the same day, Palacio stated there were 108 suspect cases in the country. On 27 April, the Government declared a [...] "national disaster" [...] state which allowed health authorities {{to have a special}} budget.

2500|$|Hirst {{noticed that}} {{hemagglutination}} tended to wear off over time, and in 1942, {{he discovered that}} influenza virus has an intrinsic enzymatic activity that can release the virus from its attachment to red blood cells. This was a ground-breaking discovery, as previously a key distinction between viruses and bacteria had been that viruses were believed to lack enzymes. Hirst demonstrated that red blood cells once de-agglutinated could not be re-agglutinated, and correctly deduced that the enzyme destroys a receptor for the virus on the red blood cells. This enzyme, then {{referred to as the}} [...] "receptor-destroying enzyme" [...] was later shown to be the influenza neuraminidase, another viral envelope glycoprotein, which acts as a sialidase. Like hemagglutinin, neuraminidase is essential for the influenza life cycle, being required for the progeny virus to leave the host cell. Neuraminidase is the target of the neuraminidase inhibitor class of antiviral drugs, which include <b>oseltamivir</b> (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza).|$|E

On addition of sodium ethoxide in ethanol three reactions take place simultaneously: cleavage of the amide to form new an ethyl ester group, displacement of the mesyl group by newly formed BOC protected amine to an aziridine group and an elimination reaction forming the alkene group in 13 with liberation of HBr. In the final two steps the aziridine ring is opened by 3-pentanol 14 and boron trifluoride to aminoether 15 with the BOC group replaced by an acyl group and on removal of the other amine protecting group (Pd/C, Ph3P, and 1,3-dimethylbarbituric acid in ethanol) and addition of phosphoric acid <b>oseltamivir</b> 16 is obtained.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2012 PLOS Medicine {{published}} an article by three researchers {{who were involved in}} ongoing updates of a Cochrane Collaboration review of neuraminidase inhibitors for treating influenza, describing their experience of trying to gain access to clinical study reports for the antiviral Tamiflu (<b>oseltamivir)</b> from the drug's manufacturer Roche. The article outlined the need for access to all clinical trial data held by pharmaceutical companies and regulators, and detailed reasons given by Roche for not sharing data on Tamiflu. In a commissioned perspective article published in the same issue of PLOS Medicine, regulators from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and other national regulatory bodies outlined a shift in their stance on access to clinical trial data but also highlighted challenges that would need to be overcome. The regulators noted, [...] "e consider it neither desirable nor realistic {{to maintain the status quo}} of limited availability of regulatory trials data" [...] and concluded, [...] "e welcome debate on these issues, and remain confident that satisfactory solutions can be found to make complete trial data available in a way that will be in the best interest of public health". The article marked a move towards the proactive disclosure of clinical trial data and led to the EMA holding a workshop to establish how this could be done. At the workshop Guido Rasi, the EMA’s Executive Director, announced [...] "oday represents the first step in delivering our vision. We are not here to decide if we will publish clinical-trial data, only how. We need to do this in order to rebuild trust and confidence in the whole system". PLOS Medicines chief editor, Virginia Barbour, was an invited speaker at the workshop representing the media.|$|E

50|$|<b>Oseltamivir</b> can {{be found}} under tradenames such as Agucort®, Antiflu, Fluvir, Fluhalt, GPO-A-Flu™, Omiflu, Rimivat, Virobin, <b>Oseltamivir</b> and Tamiflu®. <b>Oseltamivir</b> is used for {{patients}} 1 year and older.

In the prevention of influenza, <b>oseltamivir</b> is given as one dose, once a day for at least 10 days after contacting with an infected person and up to six months (during influenza epidemic). The most common side effects of <b>Oseltamivir</b> are headache and nausea (in adults) and vomiting, cough and nasal congestion (in children).|$|E
50|$|Common adverse drug {{reactions}} (ADRs) {{associated with}} <b>oseltamivir</b> therapy (occurring in over 1 percent of people) include nausea and vomiting. In adults, <b>oseltamivir</b> increased {{the risk of}} nausea for which the number needed to harm was 28 and for vomiting was 22. So, for every 22 adult people on <b>oseltamivir</b> one experienced vomiting. In the treatment of children, <b>oseltamivir</b> also induced vomiting. The number needed to harm was 19. So, for every 19 children on <b>oseltamivir</b> one experienced vomiting. In prevention there were more headaches, kidney, and psychiatric events. Oseltamivir's effect on the heart is unclear: it may reduce cardiac symptoms, but may also induce serious heart rhythm problems.|$|E
