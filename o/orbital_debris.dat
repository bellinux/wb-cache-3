25|$|The {{island is}} the {{location}} of RAF Ascension Island, which is a Royal Air Force station, a European Space Agency rocket tracking station, an Anglo-American signals intelligence facility and the BBC World Service Atlantic Relay Station. The island was used extensively as a staging point by the British military during the Falklands War. Ascension Island hosts one of four ground antennas (others are on Kwajalein Island, Diego Garcia, and Cape Canaveral) that assist {{in the operation of}} the Global Positioning System (GPS) navigational system. NASA operates a Meter Class Autonomous Telescope (MCAT) on Ascension Island for tracking <b>orbital</b> <b>debris,</b> which is potentially hazardous to operating spacecraft and astronauts, at a facility called the John Africano NASA/AFRL <b>Orbital</b> <b>Debris</b> Observatory.|$|E
25|$|During Flight Day 3, flight {{controllers}} began monitoring {{reports from}} the Department of Defense's U.S. Strategic Command that an <b>orbital</b> <b>debris</b> piece of the Russian satellite COSMOS 375 may come near the station and shuttle complex about noon the next day. The team updated tracking information following the docking and determined that no course correction maneuver was necessary.|$|E
25|$|They {{represent}} {{more than}} half of the tracked debris orbit the Earth with a mean altitude above , so they would likely remain in orbit for decades or centuries. Based on 2009 and 2013 calculations of solar flux, the NASA <b>Orbital</b> <b>Debris</b> Program Office estimated that around 30% of the larger-than- debris would still be in orbit in 2035.|$|E

2500|$|Anti-satellite missile tests, {{especially}} ones involving kinetic kill vehicles {{as in this}} case, {{contribute to}} the formation of <b>orbital</b> space <b>debris</b> which can remain in orbit for many years and could interfere with future space activity (Kessler Syndrome). [...] This event was the largest recorded creation of space debris in history with more than 2,000 pieces of trackable size (golf ball size and larger) officially cataloged in the immediate aftermath, and an estimated 150,000 debris particles. , a total of 3,438 pieces of debris had been detected, with 571 decayed and 2,867 still in orbit nine years after the incident.|$|R
25|$|The {{destruction}} of USA 193 created 174 pieces of <b>orbital</b> <b>debris</b> that were cataloged by the U.S. military. While {{most of this}} debris re-entered the Earth's atmosphere within a few months, a few pieces lasted quite a bit longer {{due to the fact}} that they were thrown into much higher orbits. The final piece of USA 193 debris did not re-enter until 28 October 2009.|$|E
25|$|The OBSS was grappled by the shuttle's {{robotic arm}} {{and used to}} inspect Endeavour’s thermal {{protection}} system for damage from <b>orbital</b> <b>debris.</b> The imagery will be analyzed to clear the shuttle for reentry. Meanwhile, the foam loss on the external tank was initially attributed to substrate contamination ahead of {{the application of the}} foam. Later during the processing of STS-128, voids in the foam was highlighted as a trigger for the shedding. The air trapped in the voids could have expanded due to the high temperatures generated during ascent thus breaking the foam.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{the claim}} contradicts what {{journalist}} Leslie Kean was told in 2003 by Nicholas L. Johnson, NASA's chief scientist for <b>orbital</b> <b>debris.</b> As {{part of the}} new Sci Fi investigation, Kean had Johnson recheck orbital paths of all known satellites and other records from the period in 1965. Johnson told Kean that orbital mechanics made it absolutely impossible for any part of the Kosmos 96 Venus probe to have accounted for either the fireball or any object at Kecksburg. Johnson also stated there were no other known man-made satellites or other objects that re-entered the atmosphere on that day.|$|E
50|$|From {{the early}} Space Shuttle missions, NASA used NORAD {{to monitor the}} Shuttle's <b>orbital</b> path for <b>debris.</b> In the 1980s, this used much of its capacity. The first collision-avoidance {{maneuver}} occurred during STS-48 in September 1991, a seven-second thruster burn to avoid debris from Kosmos 955. Similar maneuvers followed on missions 53, 72 and 82.|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} hypervelocity impacts of micrometeoroids and small-scale <b>orbital</b> space <b>debris</b> (M/OD) on space structures by comparing numerical simulation results obtained using the AUTODYN- 2 D hydrocode {{with the results of}} experiments using a two- stage light gas gun. The response of an aluminum honeycomb structure to 6 km/s high-velocity impacts is shown and discussed. AUTODYN- 2 D, which is used for impact analysis of complex physical systems including fluid and solid materials, was used to simulate impacts at 2 – 15 km/s. Material models used in the simulation to allow investigation of phenomena over a wide range of impact velocities, including shock-induced vaporization, are also presented and discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{optimization}} of spacecraft {{protective structures}} design to defeat hypervelocity impacts of meteoroids and space debris is presented. A space debris environment model is incorporated into an overall optimization methodology employing engineering models developed to predict protective structures design requirements for hypervelocity impact loads. Several nonlinear optimization techniques {{are used to}} generate design parametrics based on environment, mission, and configuration variables for the Space Station Core Module Configuration. Results indicate that careful consideration of the spacecraft structural configuration and materials can partially offset the design consequences of dramatic increases in the <b>orbital</b> space <b>debris</b> environment. Furthermore, the use of nonlinear optimization techniques coupled with hypervelocity impact engineering models can provide significant design tradeoff insight {{through the use of}} parametric analyses...|$|R
25|$|Flight day 9 saw the {{relocation}} of Pressurized Mating Adapter 3 (PMA3) from the Harmony node, where it was temporarily located, to its permanent home {{on the end of}} Tranquility. The PMA will provide protection from micro-meteoroids and <b>orbital</b> <b>debris.</b> PMA3 was moved by Bob Behnken and Nick Patrick, with help from Jeff Williams and Soichi Noguchi to release the PMA3. During the PMA3 relocation, Kay Hire and Terry Virts continued work on outfitting the Cupola. The joint Expedition 22/STS-130 crews enjoyed a meal together and had some off-duty time in the 2nd half of their day. Before the scheduled bedtime the entire crew conducted another EVA procedures review for the third and final EVA of the mission.|$|E
25|$|On April 9, 2015, the Öberg Astrochemistry Group {{published}} a paper stating they detected the first complex carbon molecule in a protoplanetary disk, this molecule being methyl cyanide. Methyl cyanide (CH3CN) {{is thought to}} be important for the origins of life because it contains carbon-nitrogen bonds, which make up amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. Up until this discovery, it was unclear if these molecules could exist in abundance in young disks because of their turbulent and chaotic nature. Using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), Öberg’s group was able to survey the <b>orbital</b> <b>debris</b> of the newly formed star MWC 480, to discover enough methyl cyanide to fill all of Earth’s oceans and the presence of other simpler molecules such as hydrogen cyanide. This discovery is significant because it shows that the backbone of life, complex carbon bonds, are not exclusive to our universe. In an interview, Öberg stated that comet records suggest the presence of complex organic molecules in other protoplanetary disks as well.|$|E
25|$|On flight day 9, Rick Mastracchio and Clay Anderson {{completed}} {{the third and}} final spacewalk of the STS-131 mission. Their tasks included hooking up the ammonia and nitrogen lines to the new Ammonia Tank Assembly (ATA), installing the old ATA in the shuttle's payload bay, retrieving some Micro-Meteoroid <b>Orbital</b> <b>Debris</b> (MMOD) shields, bolting a grapple bar (which had been removed from the old ATA) onto the new ATA, and preparation of some cables on the Z1 truss and tools to be used during STS-132. During the installation of the old ATA in Discoverys payload bay, the spacewalkers had some problems securing a bolt on the ATA to the LMC. The spacewalk took 6 hours and 24 minutes, bringing the total EVA time to 20 hours and 19 minutes. While the EVA was going on, commander Alan Poindexter and mission specialist Naoko Yamazaki continued transferring items from the MPLM to the ISS. Transfer is more than seventy-five percent complete.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} a radar transmission scheme with long phase coded pulses and non-uniform inter-pulse periods (IPPs) {{that gives a}} full range coverage while maintaining high radar duty cycle. In this scheme, the range ambiguity is mitigated {{using a combination of}} phase coding and non-uniform inter-pulse periods. To demonstrate the concept, we show initial results from a recent 21 -hour EISCAT UHF measurement conducted soon after the Iridium-Kosmos collision. We also discuss the possibility of us-ing the tri-static EISCAT UHF system for measuring the <b>orbital</b> elements of <b>debris.</b> Key words: Radar, Aperiodic transmission sequence. 1...|$|R
40|$|An <b>orbital</b> {{environment}} <b>debris</b> {{evolutionary model}} for low Earth orbit {{has been developed}} at Kyushu University. A fast orbit propagator is essentially needed in such an evolutionary model {{because the number of}} space debris larger than 1 cm in low earth orbit is very large and it takes much time to compute long-term orbital changes of space debris. The effects of orbital perturbations are investigated for hundreds of years, and the rate of change in orbital elements were invented by earlier publications. New expressions of the rate of change in orbital elements are presented to account for gravitational forces of the Sun and Moon. This paper analyzes the long-term effects of orbital perturbations based on the new analytic models of third body forces and conventional analytical models of atmospheric drag, solar radiation pressure, and zonal harmonics. Some results are shown that can predict the changes of the orbit. The models shown in this paper will be useful for long-term calculation of the satellite orbits...|$|R
25|$|Space debris is tracked {{remotely}} {{from the}} ground, and the station crew can be notified. This {{allows for a}} Debris Avoidance Manoeuvre (DAM) to be conducted, which uses thrusters on the Russian Orbital Segment to alter the station's orbital altitude, avoiding the debris. DAMs are not uncommon, taking place if computational models show the debris will approach within a certain threat distance. Eight DAMs had been performed prior to March 2009, the first seven between October 1999 and May 2003. Usually, the orbit is raised by one or two kilometres {{by means of an}} increase in orbital velocity of the order of 1m/s. Unusually, there was a lowering of 1.7km on 27 August 2008, the first such lowering for 8 years. There were two DAMs in 2009, on 22 March and 17 July. If a threat from <b>orbital</b> <b>debris</b> is identified too late for a DAM to be safely conducted, the station crew close all the hatches aboard the station and retreat into their Soyuz spacecraft, so that {{they would be able to}} evacuate in the event the station was seriously damaged by the debris. This partial station evacuation has occurred on 13 March 2009, 28 June 2011, 24 March 2012 and 16 June 2015.|$|E

40|$|Future {{spacecraft}} design will {{be affected}} by collisions with man-made debris orbiting the earth. Most of this <b>orbital</b> space <b>debris</b> comes from spent rocket stages. It is projected that the source of future debris will be the result of fragmentation of large objects through hypervelocity collisions. Orbiting spacecraft will have to be protected from hypervelocity debris in orbit. The options are to armor the spacecraft, resulting in increased mass, or actively removing the debris from orbit. An active space debris sweeper is described which will utilize momentum transfer to the debris through laser-induced ablation to alter its orbital parameters to reduce orbital lifetime with eventual entry into the earth's atmosphere where it will burn. The paper describes the concept, estimates the amount of velocity change (Delta V) that can be imparted to an object through laser-induced ablation, and investigates the use of a neutral particle beam for the momentum transfer. The space sweeper concept could also be extended to provide a collision avoidance system for the space station and satellites, or could be used for collision protection during interplanetary travel...|$|R

40|$|All {{orbiting}} spacecraft {{are susceptible}} to impacts by meteoroids and pieces of <b>orbital</b> space <b>debris.</b> These impacts occur at extremely high speeds and can damage flight-critical systems, which can in turn lead to catastrophic failure of the spacecraft. The design of a spacecraft for a long-duration mission into the meteoroid and space debris environment must include adequate protection against perforation of pressurized components by such impacts. This paper {{presents the results of}} an investigation into the perforation resistance of dual-wall structural systems fabricated with monolithic bumper plates and with corrugated bumper plates of equal weight. A comparative analysis of the impact damage in dual-wall systems with corrugated bumper specimens and that in dual-wall specimens with monolithic bumpers of similar weight is performed to determine {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} employing corrugated bumpers in structural wall systems for long-duration spacecraft. The analysis indicates that a significant increase in perforation protection can be achieved if a monolithic bumper is replaced by a corrugated bumper of equal weight. The parameters of the corrugations in the corrugated bumper plates are optimized in a manner that minimizes the potential for the creation of ricochet debris in the event of an oblique hypervelocity impact. Several design examples using the optimization scheme are presented and discussed...|$|R
