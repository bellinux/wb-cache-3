The Public Association for Assistance to Free Economy, a transparency and economic rights campaign group, had described the evictions as a [...] "violation of human rights", and as having [...] "no legal authority". However, in a statement to the BBC, Eurovision said that <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> <b>visit</b> to Baku they had observed [...] "that the construction of the concert hall [...] media reports refer to was already well under way on a clean construction site and thus there are no demolitions needed".

The site appeared to lack fire-fighting equipment or alarms, and could be easily accessed. Plants have taken root in the stone-and-brick plinth, and have begun to damage the medieval blocks upon which the barn stands." [...] English Heritage issued a statement saying: [...] "The absentee owner of the barn has declined to engage with English Heritage (and the local authority) for some years despite our offers of help, support, advice and grants. It {{should be noted that}} the Heathrow expansion area would surround the site of the barn on three sides but would not, according to plans we have seen, propose its demolition or removal. However, this still leaves question marks over the barn’s future and in particular, the issues of viability and setting." ...|$|E

I answered immediately: "Invest in basic research and recruit the best minds. " This curiosity-driven approach seems increasingly oldfashioned and underappreciated in our modern age of science. Some believe that more can be achieved through tightly managed research — as if we can predict the future. I believe this is an unfortunate misconception that affects and infects research funding. I hear repeatedly, particularly in developing countries: "Applied research is what we need. " There is nothing wrong with a nation having mission-oriented research and development to solve specific problems or to dedicate to an outreach programme, such as space exploration or alternative energy. During my visits as a US science envoy, I have emphasized that without solid investment in science education and a fundamental science base, nations will not acquire the ground-breaking knowledge required to make discoveries and innovations that will shape their future...|$|R

40|$|<b>On</b> <b>a</b> {{series of}} <b>recent</b> <b>visits</b> to Yangon, I have {{looked into the}} use of sign {{language}} in the Mary Chapman School for the Deaf, and among certain members of the Deaf community in Yangon more widely. The classroom teachers in the school are all hearing, and the language of instruction is Burmese, either in written form or in spoken form with some signed support. Sign language is not formally part of the curriculum. The fingerspelling alphabet poster displayed {{on the wall in}} each classroom is one adapted from ASL fingerspelling. In this system, the ASL sign used for a Burmese letter is the one which matches the sound, e. g. ASL ‘L’ for Burmese lá, ASL ‘W’ for Burmese wá, with some additions and adaptations. For example ASL ‘N’ is used for Burmese ná-ngeh; the orientation of the hand is changed to make the sign for ná-jì. It is not clear how systematically this ASL-derived system is taught in the school, or how widely it is known amongst the pupils. An indigenous system which preceded this one was in use in the school in the 1970 s and 1980 s and is still known and used by Deaf signers in Yangon who were in the school at that time. It is based on the graphic forms of the Burmese script. This presentation demonstrates the older system, including examples of whole-word spellings, from film made in Yangon in June 2010...|$|R

60|$|Sometimes one {{can pick}} them out; thus, on {{the borders of}} a marsh where redshanks bred, I have heard the call of that bird {{distinctly}} given by the thrush. And again, where the ring-ouzel is common, the thrush will get its brief song exactly. When thrushes taken from the nest are reared in towns, where they never hear the thrush or any other bird sing, they are often exceedingly vocal, and utter a medley of sounds which are sometimes distressing to the ear. I have heard many caged thrushes of this kind in London, but the most remarkable instance I have met with was at the little seaside town of Seaford. Here, in the main shopping street, a caged thrush lived for years in a butcher's shop, and poured out its song continuously, the most distressing throstle performance I ever heard, composed of a medley of loud, shrill and harsh sounds--imitations of screams and shouts, boy whistlers, saw filing, knives sharpened on steels, and numerous other unclassifiable noises; but all, more or less, painful. The whole street {{was filled with the}} noise, and the owner used to boast that his caged thrush was the most persistent as well as the loudest singer that had ever been heard. He had no nerves, and was proud of it! <b>On</b> <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> <b>visit</b> to Seaford I failed to hear the bird when walking about the town, and after two or three days went into the shop to enquire about it. They told me it was dead--that it had been dead over a year; also that many visitors to Seaford had missed its song and had called at the shop to ask about the bird. The strangest thing about its end, they said, was its suddenness. The bird was singing its loudest one morning, and had been at it for some time, filling the whole place with its noise, when suddenly, in the middle of its song, it dropped down dead from its perch.|$|E

40|$|Riverdale First United Methodist Church, a {{multicultural}} congregation {{in the southern}} crescent of metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia, is a congregation composed of twenty-three ethnic groups that has limited fellowship between those same groups. <b>On</b> <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> home <b>visit,</b> one long-standing African American member complained to the researcher 2 ̆ 2 we have twenty-three different ethnic groups at church, and yet I do not know these people! 2 ̆ 2 This calls for advancing an ethic of recognition. The first step toward creating an environment for recognition will be accomplished by critically analyzing the spiritual formation practices of the various ethnic groups of Riverdale First United Methodist Church (RFUMC). Listening is a key ingredient, at every stage, this being a narrative process. The intention is to discern who are the stakeholders of this community; why they choose RFUMC; what is holding them to the church; and where spiritual formation occurs {{in each of the}} ethnic groups. The project provides an ethnographic critique of this United Methodist congregation in order then to design a 2 ̆ 2 Narrative Model of Spiritual Formation for Riverdale First United Methodist Church, A Multicultural Congregation 2 ̆ 2. This will be a new model of spiritual formation for this church, one that fosters multiculturalism. The goal of this new model is for the church to take ownership of this ever-increasing multiculturalism; and to identify its strengths and weaknesses in order to enhance relations. A mixed method research approach ending with action research was utilized in the research methodology. Using a framework of critical ethnography, 1 this researcher completed the following: compiled the primary record through the collection of monological data; did preliminary reconstructive analysis; undertook dialogical data collection; and explored the congregation 2 ̆ 7 s system relations. Thus a narrative model of spiritual formation for {{a multicultural}} congregation was developed using a critical analysis of the ethnographic findings. The project consists of at least two months of field notes from participant observations, focus group discussions, demographic data from the city and surrounding communities, informal individual ethnographic interviews, and finally the formation of a workshop that taught the congregation a narrative model of spiritual formation in a multicultural congregation. The data was collected at various locales: the church, homes, and restaurants. At the heart of bettering relations lies the creation of an atmosphere of recognition. Listening to the narratives of different ethnic groups and utilizing them within the worship service accomplished recognition. This project drew upon the scholarship of Charles Taylor, Robert Kegan, and Ann Wimberly, which not only recognizes the politics of recognition but also describes the evolving ego or self in society, and thus the church. The enhancement of an atmosphere of recognition, involves being authentic and respecting the other while not assimilating into the other 2 ̆ 7 s culture. Demographic and census data indicate that Riverdale, Clayton County, Georgia and the nation is becoming more diverse. As we become more diverse, nurture and education are vital components in maintaining vitality with such a diversity of cultures and ethnic groups. This has implications beyond the local church to community and governmental organizations, as well as for how we relate to those who are culturally and ethnically different. The model that came out of this study [...] 2 ̆ 2 A Narrative of Spiritual Formation in a Multicultural Congregation 2 ̆ 2 [...] attends to identity in a multicultural setting. This attention to identity fosters better relations among diverse groups. Besides helping this particular church, this model of spiritual formation can also assist other congregations to worship together and do ministry together, as opposed to having different ethnic groups worship and do ministry in separate settings on one and the same church campus. This model and research process is about nurturing equal recognition and authenticity for all...|$|R
