For the record, a stacked Venn contains {{a series of}} sets A1...Ak where each set An is a strict subset of An+1 (and by recursion, of all Am where m > n). However, as the onion is often used as a metaphor, it doesn't necessarily make sense to interpret the contents of an <b>onion</b> <b>diagram</b> literally or mathematically.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Onion</b> <b>Diagram</b> {{is able to}} show {{layers of}} a {{complete}} system in a few circles. Each of the circles is able to represent a component that is dependent upon the component {{on the inside of}} it shown by the circle inside of it. The main concept of the diagram is shown by the center circle of the diagram. This chart is used {{due to the fact that}} it has a clear visual representation that is easy to read, and it has a strong visual impact.|$|E
40|$|As {{one of the}} key ‘stable factors’, culture {{within an}} {{organization}} is playing a critical role in the organization’s everyday operations. Although the culture literature has at times focused on the culture of an organization as shared basic assumptions (Schein, 1985), or as metaphors within organizations (Morgan, 1986, 1997), it is not sufficient to attempt to understand and measure them. This paper explores organizational culture in general, some definitions and implications of organizational culture are reviewed from different perspectives, and Cliffe’s cultural themes are addressed with the use of Scholes ’ cultural web and Hofstede’s <b>onion</b> <b>diagram</b> model of organizational culture...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the experiences of women, as regards their opportunities for advancing to executive positions within the Curaçao community and its organisations. The term ´glass ceiling´ has a central place in this. To begin, the research backgrounds will be stated, after which the goals will be summarized. Next, the research question and the sub-questions are formulated, and will make clear that opportunities and barriers are central concepts. These concepts will be defined and related to the central question. The labour supply (or lifestyle availability) model is used to describe and arrange the main concepts in the data. Using notions from this model, the connections between the aspects, sub-aspects and criteria of the central question will be displayed. When combined with the individual variables in background, these show {{the workings of the}} glass ceiling in the Curaçao job market. Following this, the <b>onion</b> <b>diagram</b> shall show in a simple fashion the interweaving of the separate aspects and sub-aspects that maintain the glass ceiling on Curaçao. After that a methodological justification for the research will be given. The research territory will be explored, the central question will be discussed and the analysis model presented. Lastly, the reading guide shows how this book is organised and which subjects and themes are discussed in its chapters...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{highlight}} the energy saving potentials of a batch retort sterilization process operated by steam and to develop concepts for improving its energy efficiency. By using the methodical approach of the <b>Onion</b> <b>Diagram</b> and the recovery of low grade heat sources, four comprehensive improved energy efficiency concepts have been developed. Two concepts increase the initial product temperature resulting in lower transient steam consumption rates and a decreased energy demand. The other two options transform the waste heat and the energy for product cooling into heat streams for supplying nearby heat sinks or other processes in the plant. Results show that the total energy demand can be reduced by more than 23 % and 42 % of the energy injected into the system can be recovered. The scope of the study focused on a single, independent retort to ensure the transferability of the concepts. This study also shows, using a practical example, the importance of a comprehensive process understanding and analysis prior to application of Pinch Analysis, which is needed to ensure that the correct waste heat stream temperatures are defined, necessary processing constraints are appreciated, and all possible heat sinks in the process are considered...|$|E
40|$|This study s {{focal point}} is {{centered}} around the cultural practice of the custom of wife replacement/inheritance known as seyantlo in Setswana. This research {{was inspired by the}} fact that this practice is still in use in some areas in South Africa, and some regions of Southern Africa even during this era of democracy and human rights. In South Africa, the custom of wife inheritance is still prevalent in many cultures such as the Zulu, Pedi, Venda, Tswana, and other ethnic groups. This study aimed at researching the reasons behind the practice of seyantlo, and procedures followed to perform this ritual, as endorsed by the Batswana culture. In researching the two basic aspects mentioned, this study analyses two Setswana literature pieces, O nkutlwe a short story, and Maikotlhao a drama book. These two books investigate this practice of the custom of seyantlo. It is vital to report to the readers of this research study on the success of this study in its findings, that the aim of the Batswana people to put the custom of seyantlo in use was for procreation and protection of the deceased husband s assets. The methodology employed to analyse the two books mentioned is explained hereunder: In the first instance, the levels of cultural theory according to Hofstede (1991) are applied. The basic aim is to identify the levels at which a child gets exposure to, acquires and identifies himself with his own culture. Factors such as the environment in which he is living; different people he interacts with in his neighborhood; at school; at church and other social settings are being followed up in the two books. The results obtained confirm that a child learns culture at different levels such as through inheritance; imitation; influence; inspiration; self-driven motivation; etc. In the second instance, the semiotic approach according to Stables (2007) has been applied to investigate different types of signs that signify aspects of culture in the plot and narrative by the authors in the two books. As a semiotic approach is based on the study of signs, it is a relevant approach to identify cultural signs contained in the two books. The <b>onion</b> <b>diagram</b> according to Hofstede (1991) on cultural signs, the levels at which a person learns culture according to Hofstede (1991), and the semiotic approach by Stables (2007) complement each other very well in terms of identifying the aspects of Batswana culture as mentioned above. The research also embarked on a comparative study of the two books, with the aim of determining similarities and differences regarding the use of cultural aspects such as myths; cultural values; rituals; cultural heroes, cultural signs and symbols evident in Batswana culture. With regard to the findings of the research, it is evident that the two authors highlighted similar procedures followed by the Batswana people in practicing the custom of seyantlo after the death of a husband. Also, similar cultural symbols are evident in the two books, such as the way of mourning, the dress code for mourning, the specific mourning period, ilobolo and its cultural role, funeral procedures, and many other signs and symbols. In conclusion, this research study strongly agitates for a review of some cultural practices such as the custom of seyantlo in respect of human rights. It is the standing point of this research that some aspects of Batswana culture are no longer relevant in this technological era. The research strongly believes that the practice of seyantlo custom is practically contravening the Bill of Rights as enshrined in the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, and should either be revisited/amended or abolished.
