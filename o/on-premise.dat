50|$|With <b>on-premises</b> software, the {{customer}} manages and purchases the application. <b>On-premises</b> software has some advantages and disadvantages. The disadvantage of <b>on-premises</b> is the higher {{cost of the}} software, along with maintenance. Customization is also needed for some who use additional processes outside of the normal {{out of the box}} solution. Time is also a factor. Many <b>on-premises</b> software implementations take longer - along with numerous testing and training sessions. The overall advantage of <b>on-premises</b> software relates to overall return on investment. Using the application for three to five years becomes more cost-effective. Another advantage may depend on the amount of data. With on-demand, certain volume restrictions hold, but with <b>on-premises,</b> data restrictions are based on the storage size of local hardware.|$|R
