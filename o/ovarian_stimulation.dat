25|$|Decreased inhibin {{feedback}} after hysterectomy is {{hypothesized to}} contribute to increased <b>ovarian</b> <b>stimulation</b> and earlier menopause. Hastened ovarian aging has been observed after endometrial ablation. While {{it is difficult to}} prove that these surgeries are causative, it has been hypothesized that the endometrium may be producing endocrine factors contributing to the endocrine feedback and regulation of the <b>ovarian</b> <b>stimulation.</b> Elimination of this factors contributes to faster depletion of the ovarian reserve. Reduced blood supply to the ovaries that may occur as a consequence of hysterectomy and uterine artery embolisation has been hypothesized {{to contribute to}} this effect.|$|E
25|$|There may an {{association}} of developing ovarian cancer and <b>ovarian</b> <b>stimulation</b> during infertility treatments. Endometriosis {{has been linked to}} ovarian cancers.

30|$|Whether a link existed, in this case, between {{infertility}} and the malignancy is {{an intriguing}} albeit difficult question. Infertility {{does not seem}} to represent a strong risk factor for endometrial cancer, although some conditions such as chronic anovulation in PCOS patients imply unopposed estrogenic effect on the endometrium, hence a risk for abnormal proliferation [15]. Our patient had ovulatory cycles but had undergone various <b>ovarian</b> <b>stimulations</b> with gonadotrophins as well as hormonal replacement treatments for frozen embryo transfer. Her endometrial cancer was of endometrioid type, which is closely related to estrogens. Some studies have previously shown an increased risk for endometrial cancer in women receiving gonadotrophins and clomiphene for fertility treatment although a real causal relationship is far from demonstrated [16].|$|R
40|$|Objective. To {{report the}} arrest of euploid embryos with high mtDNA content. Design. A report of 2 cases. Setting. Private {{fertility}} clinic. Patients. 2 patients, 45 and 40 years old undergoing IVF treatment. Interventions. Mature oocytes were collected and vitrified from two <b>ovarian</b> <b>stimulations.</b> Postthaw, survived mature oocytes underwent fertilization by intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number were done using next generation sequencing (NGS). The only normal embryo among the all-biopsied embryos had the highest “Mitoscore” value and was the only arrested embryo in both cases. Therefore, the embryo transfer was cancelled. Main Outcome Measures. Postthaw survival and fertilization rate, embryo euploidy, mtDNA copy number, and embryo development. Results. In both patients, after PGS only 1 embryo was euploid. Both embryos had the highest mtDNA copy number from all tested embryos and both embryos were arrested on further development. Conclusions. These cases clearly demonstrate the lack of correlation between mtDNA value (Mitoscore) and chromosomal status of embryo...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} first {{successful}} live birth after the transfer of embryos obtained by fertilization of vitrified oocytes. A couple with primary infertility due to teratozoospermy and chronic an ovulation decided to undergo assisted reproductive technology after 4 failed cycles of super ovulation and intrauterine insemination. The woman underwent a standard luteal phase agonist protocol, with controlled <b>ovarian</b> hyper <b>stimulation</b> with daily 150 IU recombinant gonadotropin and 75 IU urinary gonadotropin for 12 days. Due to the high risk of <b>ovarian</b> hyper <b>stimulation</b> syndrome the couple was advised to delay embryo transfer. Eighteen mature oocytes were recovered, eight were vitrified and 10 fertilized and cryopreserved as pro-nuclei. Two months later, four vitrified oocytes were thawed, and three morphologically-normal embryos were transferred to an estrogen-progesterone-primed uterus, obtaining triple clinical pregnancy. The pregnancy was uneventful until 32 weeks of amenorrhea, when pre-term delivery started. After inducing lung maturity, a cesarean section was performed and three healthy fetuses were delivered. Nowadays, the babies are {{two and a half}} years old, and have had a normal psycho-motor development...|$|R
25|$|Usage of {{assisted}} reproductive technology including <b>ovarian</b> <b>stimulation</b> and {{in vitro}} fertilization {{have been associated with}} an increased overall risk of childhood cancer in the offspring, which may be caused by the same original disease or condition that caused the infertility or subfertility in the mother or father.|$|E
25|$|A risk of <b>ovarian</b> <b>stimulation</b> is the {{development}} of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, particularly if hCG is used for inducing final oocyte maturation. This results in swollen, painful ovaries. It occurs in 30% of patients. Mild cases can be treated with over the counter medications and cases can be resolved in the absence of pregnancy. In moderate cases, ovaries swell and fluid accumulated in the abdominal cavities and may have symptoms of heartburn, gas, nausea or loss of appetite. In severe cases patients have sudden excess abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and will result in hospitalisation.|$|E
25|$|Progesterone {{elevation}} (PE) {{on the day}} of induction {{of final}} maturation is associated with lower pregnancy rates in IVF cycles in women undergoing <b>ovarian</b> <b>stimulation</b> using GnRH analogues and gonadotrophins. At this time, compared to a progesterone level below 0.8ng/ml, a level between 0.8 and 1.1ng/ml confers an odds ratio of pregnancy of approximately 0.8, and a level between 1.2 and 3.0ng/ml confers an odds ratio of pregnancy of between 0.6 and 0.7. On the other hand, progesterone elevation does not seem to confer a decreased chance of pregnancy in frozen–thawed cycles and cycles with egg donation.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{examined}} the efficacy of a group intervention, the Integrative Body-Mind-Spirit (I-BMS) intervention, which aims at improving the psychosocial and spiritual well-being of Chinese women undergoing their first IVF treatment cycle. DESIGN: The I-BMS intervention facilitates the search of meaning {{of life in the}} context of family and childbearing, as well as the letting go of high IVF expectations. A randomized controlled study of 339 women undergoing first IVF treatment cycle in a local Hong Kong hospital was conducted (intervention: n= 172; no-intervention control: n= 167). METHODS: Assessments of anxiety, perceived importance of childbearing, and spiritual well-being were made at randomization (T(0)), on the day starting <b>ovarian</b> <b>stimulations</b> (T(1)), and on the day undertaking embryo transfer (T(2)). RESULTS: Comparing T(0) and T(2), interaction analyses showed women who had received the intervention reported lower levels of physical distress, anxiety, and disorientation. They reported being more tranquil and satisfied with their marriage, and saw childbearing as less important compared to women in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that I-BMS intervention was successful at improving the psychosocial and spiritual well-being of women undergoing their first IVF treatment cycle. This study highlights the importance of providing integrative fertility treatment that incorporates psychosocial and spiritual dimensions. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Background PGD {{has been}} {{described}} in previous cross-sectional and retrospective studies as a stressful experience. No prospective studies of the psychological impact of PGD are currently available. Methods Using a prospective study design, validated measures exploring anxiety and depression {{were used to assess}} women using PGD prior to treatment, following embryo transfer, following the pregnancy test result and at 24 weeks of pregnancy. Maternal-fetal attachment was also assessed during pregnancy. Results The prospective design revealed the cyclical pathway through PGD for many women, often comprising repeated cycles of <b>ovarian</b> <b>stimulations</b> and IVF and frozen embryo transfers. As predicted, there were significant fluctuations in womens anxiety scores, with increases observed following embryo transfer and pregnancy testing. Womens anxiety scores returned to baseline levels during pregnancy as assessed at 24 weeks gestation. Depression scores did not significa ntly fluctuate during PGD. Maternal-fetal attachment scores in this sample did not differ from the normative Australian data. Conclusions For some women, the PGD pathway is convoluted and requires multiple IVF cycles and embryo transfers to achieve pregnancy. A subset of women experience significant emotional burden during PGD treatment, and it is these women who require closer attention and support. In this sample, emotional adjustment in pregnancy following PGD appears to be sound. 9 page(s...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to compare the developmental capacity of sheep oocytes obtained by OPU after two different <b>ovarian</b> <b>stimulations,</b> and cryotolerance to vitrification procedures of in vitro derived embryos after in vitro maturation, fertilisation and culture of these oocytes. Sheep were divided into three groups: (A) no treatment (control); (B) constant doses of FSH (FSH-c); (C) decreasing doses of FSH (FSH-d). Ovine groups FSH-c and FSH-d were synchronised by the insertion of intravaginal sponges left in situ for 7 days; FSH (total dose: 96 IU) was administered in four doses given every 12 h starting on Day 5. Twelve hours after the last FSH administration oocytes were collected by OPU technique. The control group showed a significantly lower number (P 5 mm was significantly higher (P < 0. 01) in FSH-d group, showing that this protocol stimulates the growth of a different follicle population compared to FSH-c group. The control group showed a higher number of < 2 mm follicles (P < 0. 01). We did not find any difference in oocyte quality between the three groups and therefore the percentage of discarded oocytes was similar. No significant differences were found between control, FSH-c and FSH-d groups in terms of maturation (90. 9, 85. 7 and 87. 7...|$|R
25|$|In younger women, {{during a}} normal menstrual cycle the ovaries produce estradiol, {{testosterone}} and progesterone in a cyclical pattern {{under the control}} of FSH and luteinising hormone (LH) which are both produced by the pituitary gland. During perimenopause (approaching menopause), estradiol levels and patterns of production remain relatively unchanged or may increase compared to young women, but the cycles become frequently shorter or irregular. The often observed increase in estrogen is presumed to be in response to elevated FSH levels that, in turn, is hypothesized to be caused by decreased feedback by inhibin. Similarly, decreased inhibin feedback after hysterectomy is hypothesized to contribute to increased <b>ovarian</b> <b>stimulation</b> and earlier menopause.|$|E
25|$|Currently, all PGD embryos are {{obtained}} by assisted reproductive technology, although {{the use of}} natural cycles and in vivo fertilization followed by uterine lavage was attempted {{in the past and}} is now largely abandoned. In order to obtain a large group of oocytes, the patients undergo controlled <b>ovarian</b> <b>stimulation</b> (COH). COH is carried out either in an agonist protocol, using gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues for pituitary desensitisation, combined with human menopausal gonadotrophins (hMG) or recombinant follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), or an antagonist protocol using recombinant FSH combined with a GnRH antagonist according to clinical assessment of the patient’s profile (age, body mass index (BMI), endocrine parameters). hCG is administered when at least three follicles of more than 17mm mean diameter are seen at transvaginal ultrasound scan. Transvaginal ultrasound-guided oocyte retrieval is scheduled 36 hours after hCG administration. Luteal phase supplementation consists of daily intravaginal administration of 600µg of natural micronized progesterone.|$|E
25|$|Mild IVF is {{a method}} where a small dose of ovarian {{stimulating}} drugs are used for a short duration during a woman’s natural cycle aimed at producing 2–7 eggs and creating healthy embryos. This method {{appears to be an}} advance in the field to reduce complications and side-effects for women and it is aimed at quality, and not quantity of eggs and embryos. One study comparing a mild treatment (mild <b>ovarian</b> <b>stimulation</b> with GnRH antagonist co-treatment combined with single embryo transfer) to a standard treatment (stimulation with a GnRH agonist long-protocol and transfer of two embryos) came to the result that the proportions of cumulative pregnancies that resulted in term live birth after 1 year were 43.4% with mild treatment and 44.7% with standard treatment.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Since 2001, French law has {{permitted}} {{the use of}} assisted reproductive technology in human immu-nodeficiency virus (HIV) - 1 infected women under strict conditions. This report describes a preliminary series of sero-positive women who underwent assisted reproduction treatment at our facility. To minimize contamination of culture media, equipment, and therefore of male gametes and embryos, we chose to perform ICSI in all cases. The outcome of ICSI was compared with the outcome in an age-matched group of non-HIV- 1 -infected women. Since several previous reports have indicated that HIV infection {{may be associated with}} a decrease in spontaneous fertility, our goal was also to assess the fertility status of the HIV- 1 -infected women entering our ICSI programme. METHODS: The French law governing the use of assisted reproduction protocols in HIV- 1 -infected women was strictly applied. The inclusion criteria were absence of ongoing disease, CD 4 (+) count> 200 cells/mm 3, and stable HIV- 1 RNA level. Since mean age at the time of ICSI was higher in HIV- 1 -infected women than in the overall group of non-HIV-infected women, we compared outcome data in HIV- 1 -infected women (group I) to a group of non-HIV- 1 -infected women matched with regard to age and follicle retrieval period (group II) {{as well as to the}} overall group of women who underwent ICSI at our institution (group III).

25|$|The {{process of}} somatic cell nuclear {{transplant}} involves two different cells. The first being a female gamete, {{known as the}} ovum (egg/oocyte). In human SCNT (Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer) experiments, these eggs are obtained through consenting donors, utilizing <b>ovarian</b> <b>stimulation.</b> The second being a somatic cell, referring to {{the cells of the}} human body. Skin cells, fat cells, and liver cells are only a few examples. The nucleus of the donor egg cell is removed and discarded, leaving it 'deprogrammed.' What is left is a somatic cell and an unnucleated egg cell. These are then fused by inserting the somatic cell into the 'empty' ovum. After being inserted into the egg, the somatic cell nucleus is reprogrammed by its host egg cell. The ovum, now containing the somatic cell's nucleus, is stimulated with a shock and will begin to divide. The egg is now viable and capable of producing an adult organism containing all the necessary genetic information from just one parent. Development will ensue normally and after many mitotic divisions, this single cell forms a blastocyst (an early stage embryo with about 100 cells) with an identical genome to the original organism (i.e. a clone). Stem cells can then be obtained by the destruction of this clone embryo for use in therapeutic cloning {{or in the case of}} reproductive cloning the clone embryo is implanted into a host mother for further development and brought to term.|$|E

Therefore, we need to have better evaluation of the adnexa when pain is out of proportion of what is expected in a woman with IUP.
