5|$|American actor Stuart Milligan {{was cast}} as President Nixon, {{which he said}} he found exciting, having played <b>other</b> <b>presidents</b> in the past, {{including}} Dwight D. Eisenhower. Prosthetic pieces were applied on Milligan's cheeks, nose, and ears to make him resemble Nixon as much as possible. He also practiced how Nixon would speak, but initially found it difficult since he had to wear fake teeth. Milligan previously appeared in the animated Tenth Doctor special Dreamland {{as the voice of}} Colonel Stark. Chuk Iwuji, who played Carl, previously appeared in the Seventh Doctor audio drama A Thousand Tiny Wings, where he played Joshua Sembeke.|$|E

In polling conducted January 9–11, 2009, his final job approval rating by Gallup was 34percent, which placed him on par with Jimmy Carter and Harry S. Truman, the <b>other</b> <b>presidents</b> whose final Gallup ratings measured in the low 30s (Richard Nixon's final Gallup approval rating was even lower, at 24percent). According to a CBS News/New York Times poll conducted January 11–15, 2009, Bush's final approval rating in office was 22percent, the lowest in American history.|$|E

5|$|The Clinton Presidential Center was {{dedicated}} on November 18, 2004. Although it was raining, {{the ceremony was}} attended by approximately 30,000 people (including notable figures such as Willie Mays, Robin Williams, and Barbra Streisand) and included a 20-minute speech made by Clinton, who had recently undergone bypass surgery. It also included performances by Bono, the African Drum Ballet and the Philander Smith Collegiate Choir, {{as well as an}} invocation given by Floyd Flake and video tribute from Nelson Mandela. Four U.S. presidents (Clinton, Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush, and George W. Bush were present; former president Gerald R. Ford could not attend due to health concerns) were on the same stage together. All three <b>other</b> <b>presidents</b> spoke at the event as well. Overall, the ceremony lasted two hours and featured six speakers.|$|E
5|$|With the war underway, Hancock {{made his}} way to the Continental Congress in Philadelphia with the other Massachusetts delegates. On May 24, 1775, he was {{unanimously}} elected President of the Continental Congress, succeeding Peyton Randolph after Henry Middleton declined the nomination. Hancock was a good choice for president for several reasons. He was experienced, having often presided over legislative bodies and town meetings in Massachusetts. His wealth and social standing inspired the confidence of moderate delegates, while his association with Boston radicals made him acceptable to other radicals. His position was somewhat ambiguous, because the role of the president was not fully defined, and it was not clear if Randolph had resigned or was on a leave of absence. Like <b>other</b> <b>presidents</b> of Congress, Hancock's authority was mostly limited to that of a presiding officer. He also had to handle a great deal of official correspondence, and he found it necessary to hire clerks at his own expense to help with the paperwork.|$|E

25|$|Trump {{became the}} first person since Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952 to be elected {{president}} without having been elected to any other previous office, and the only individual to be elected president without any prior political or military experience. Among <b>other</b> <b>presidents</b> with limited military or political experience, William Howard Taft never {{served in the military}} and had been elected to political office only once, as an Ohio state judge, although he later held a number of appointed federal government positions, including in the Cabinet of Theodore Roosevelt. Herbert Hoover did not serve in the military and never held elected office, but he led two federal government agencies during and after World War I and served in the Cabinets of two <b>other</b> <b>presidents,</b> Warren G. Harding and Calvin Coolidge. However, Trump is unique in not having any state or federal government experience: military, appointed, or elected.|$|E

Heavyweight boxing champions James J. Corbett and Max Baer and department store magnate F.W. Woolworth were among the celebrities of the day who vacationed in Ocean Grove.|$|E
25|$|President Uribe's {{concrete}} actions tend to {{show him}} as a staunch enemy of narcotics trafficking, as his administration {{has been responsible for}} arresting and extraditing more drug traffickers to the United States and to other countries than all <b>other</b> <b>presidents</b> to date. He has been publicly recognized as a supporter of the US war on drugs by continually implementing the anti-drug strategy of Plan Colombia.|$|E
25|$|Lincoln's {{assassination}} {{had taken}} place roughly sixteen years before in the closing stages of the Civil War. On the other hand, Garfield's term was marked (for the most part) by peacetime, and a general complacency with respect to presidential security had developed by this time. Garfield, like many <b>other</b> <b>presidents,</b> often preferred to interact directly with the public and although some form of security was almost certainly in place, a comprehensive security detail had not been seriously considered by either Congress or the president up to that point. Remarkably, {{it would not be}} until the assassination of William McKinley some twenty years later that Congress would finally task the United States Secret Service (founded to prevent counterfeiting) with the responsibility of ensuring the president's personal safety.|$|E

25|$|President: All {{members of}} a stake presidency, {{district}} presidency, temple presidency, and mission presidency are properly referred to with the title of president. In a branch, the branch president {{is referred to as}} president, but his counselors are not. Together, the three men constitute the branch presidency. Among the general authorities, only members of the church's First Presidency and the President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles use this title. In individual congregations, an elders quorum president may be addressed as president. A teachers or deacons quorum president may be addressed with this title also. <b>Other</b> <b>presidents</b> of auxiliaries within the church unit, such as the Sunday School president and Relief Society president, are usually not addressed by title.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, Stone {{completed}} a feature-length documentary, South of the Border about {{the rise of}} progressive, leftist governments in Latin America, featuring seven presidents: Hugo Chávez of Venezuela, Bolivia's Evo Morales, Ecuador's Rafael Correa, Cuba's Raúl Castro, the Kirchners of Argentina, Brazil's Lula da Silva, and Paraguay's Fernando Lugo (all of whom hold negative views of US manipulations in South America). Stone hoped the film would {{get the rest of}} the Western world to rethink socialist policies in South America, particularly as it was being applied by Venezuela's Hugo Chávez. Chávez joined Stone for the premiere of the documentary at the Venice International Film Festival in September 2009. Stone defended his decision not to interview Chávez's opponents, stating that oppositional statements and TV clips were scattered through the documentary and that the documentary was an attempt to right a balance of heavily negative coverage. He praised Chávez as a leader of a movement for social transformation in Latin America (the Bolivarian Revolution), along with the six <b>other</b> <b>Presidents</b> in the film. The documentary was also released in several cities in the United States and Europe in the mid-2010.|$|E
25|$|George Washington {{remains the}} central figure found on U.S. postage. The first {{president}} appears {{on the face of}} U.S. postage more than any other president. The engraved images of Washington found on the early issues set the precedent that all U.S. postage issues would follow in the following decades. Indeed, in virtually every U.S. definitive stamp series offered between 1851 and 1932, Washington appeared on the normal letter-rate value (the only exception being the short-lived 1869 pictorial issue); <b>other</b> <b>presidents,</b> statesmen and famous Americans were confined to the less commonly used denominations. Since the first U.S. postage stamp was issued by the U.S. Post Office, there have been more examples of George Washington appearing on U.S. postage than all other American presidents combined, including Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, Abraham Lincoln and even the frequently honored Benjamin Franklin (who was not president). Examples of all the various Washington stamps are too numerous to include in this section, as many of the issues are very similar with only differences in color and denomination, such as the Washington-Franklin issues. Featured below are the issues that are unique in their designs and the most definitive.|$|E

25|$|Walter Reuther and <b>other</b> <b>presidents</b> of the UAW {{had been}} active {{in a number of}} social issues, and Bieber {{continued}} that tradition. In 1983, {{he was a member of}} a controversial effort to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. Bieber joined the National Labor Committee, a group which opposed U.S. support for the Contras in Nicaragua. The group successfully overcame vocal opposition from staunch anti-communists on the AFL-CIO executive council to win approval of a resolution that put the labor federation in favor of a negotiated settlement and criticized the Reagan administration of seeking only a military solution. In January 1986, he won AFL-CIO approval of a boycott of U.S. companies doing business in South Africa under apartheid. Later that year, he traveled to South Africa, where he met with several cabinet ministers and angrily demanded that the government release anti-apartheid labor leaders who had been jailed but never charged with any crimes. He also successfully put pressure on GM to pay these workers until they had been convicted. In 1990, shortly after his release from prison, Nelson Mandela traveled to the United States and thanked Bieber for his support; Bieber gave him a guided tour of the Ford River Rouge Complex.|$|E
