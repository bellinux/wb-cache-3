We present our experience with <b>ozone</b> <b>therapy</b> {{in the management}} of such refractory rectal bleeding. Methods. Patients (n= 12) previously irradiated for prostate cancer with persistent or severe rectal bleeding without response to conventional treatment were enrolled to receive <b>ozone</b> <b>therapy</b> via rectal insufflations and/or topical application of ozonized-oil. Ten (83 %) patients had Grade 3 or Grade 4 toxicity. Median follow-up after <b>ozone</b> <b>therapy</b> was 104 months (range: 52 – 119). Results. Following <b>ozone</b> <b>therapy,</b> the median grade of toxicity improved from 3 to 1 (p< 0. 001) and the number of endoscopy treatments from 37 to 4 (p= 0. 032).

40|$|Tumor hypoxia is {{an adverse}} factor for {{chemotherapy}} and radiotherapy. <b>Ozone</b> <b>therapy</b> is a non-conventional form of medicine {{that has been}} used successfully in the treatment of ischemic disorders. This prospective study was designed to assess the effect of <b>ozone</b> <b>therapy</b> on tumor oxygenation. Eighteen subjects were recruited for the study.

Tumor oxygenation levels were measured using polarographic needle probes before and after the first and the third <b>ozone</b> <b>therapy</b> session. Overall, no statistically significant change was observed in the tumor oxygenation in the 18 patients. However, a significant decrease was observed in hypoxic values ≤ 10 and ≤ 5 [*]mmHg of pO 2. When individually assessed, a significant and inverse non-linear correlation was observed between increase in oxygenation and the initial tumor pO 2 values at each measuring time-point, thus indicating that the more poorly-oxygenated tumors benefited most (rho = − 0. 725; P = 0. 001).

For this purpose, 24 rats were divided into four groups including sham-operated, torsion/detorsion, torsion/detorsion plus intraperitoneal ozone (O-IP), and torsion/detorsion plus intratesticular ozone (O-IT). The O-IP ozone group received a 4 mg kg− 1 intraperitoneal injection of ozone, and the O-IT group received the same injection epididymally. At 4 h after detorsion, the rats were sacrificed and orchiectomy materials were assessed histopathologically. Spermatogenesis in the seminiferous tubules and damage to the Sertoli cells were histopathologically evaluated in the testes using the Johnsen scoring system. i-NOS and e-NOS activities in the testis tissue were also evaluated. Torsion-detorsion caused a decreased Johnsen score and increased apoptosis of spermatogonial and Sertoli cells. Ozone injection prevented increases in Johnsen score and i-NOS level. e-NOS level of the O-IP group was significantly {{lower than that of}} the O-IP group, and i-NOS level of the O-IT group was significantly lower than that of the O-IP group.

Materials and Methods: Sprague–Dawley rats were fed with 0. 75 % adenine-containing diet to induce CKD and chronic tubulointerstitial injury. <b>Ozone</b> <b>therapy</b> was administered by rectal insufflation. After 4 weeks, serum and kidney samples were collected and analyzed. Renal function and systemic electrolyte level were detected. Pathological changes in kidney were assessed by hematoxylin–eosin staining and Masson trichrome staining. Nrf 2 activation was detected by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analyses. The levels of SOD, CAT, GSH, PCO, and MDA were detected in the kidney. Immunohistochemistry, Western blot, and real-time PCR analyses were performed to evaluate the activation of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) P 65 pathway and inflammation infiltration in the tubulointerstitium of the rats.

By 1993, Young had financially supported Higgins who sought alternative <b>ozone</b> <b>therapy.</b> Young {{was arrested in}} the Philippines under charges of involvement in running an illegal AIDS clinic after accompanying Higgins there. Young was tested for AIDS and threatened with deportation. Subsequently all charges were dropped, but Young's public image was damaged by media coverage of rumours regarding his sexuality. ABC Television produced an episode on Australian Story in February 2000 in which he discussed the events and their effect on his life and career. A year after seeking the <b>ozone</b> <b>therapy,</b> Higgins died with Young still supporting him.|$|R
