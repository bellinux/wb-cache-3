5|$|Angel {{returns to}} his hotel and finds Epiphany on his doorstep. He invites her into his room, where they have {{aggressive}} sexual intercourse, during which Angel has visions of blood dripping from the ceiling and splashing around the room. He later confronts Krusemark in a gumbo hut, where the latter reveals that he and Margaret {{were the ones who}} helped Favorite leave the hospital. He also explains that Favorite was actually a powerful magician who sold his soul to Satan in exchange for stardom, but then sought to renege on the bargain. In 1943, Favorite kidnapped a young soldier and performed a Satanic ritual <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy,</b> murdering him and eating his still-beating heart in order to assume his identity and hide from the Devil. Favorite was supposed to drop out and resurface as the soldier he murdered, but was unexpectedly drafted into the war, injured, then sent home with amnesia. Hoping to jar his memory, the Krusemarks took Favorite from the hospital and released him into Times Square, never to be seen again. Angel has a panic attack and runs into the bathroom. He returns to find Krusemark drowned in a cauldron of boiling gumbo.|$|E
5|$|It {{begins with}} a shot of Wade's face and the guitar introduction. He then sings {{the first line of}} lyrics, which is {{followed}} by a transition to a boy lying on a bed shirtless. As the video switches between Wade and the boy, it zooms on the bed frame (which has the same face from the album cover) and opens into another area. The boy is then seen walking around the new area looking around until he goes up nearby stairs. While going up the stairs, the video switches between shots of the boy going up the stairs and Wade singing the lyrics. Once up the stairs, the boy looks around and then walks into a bright light that he sees nearby. He walks through the bright archway into a dark room as the video switches to Lifehouse playing the song. After this, it switches to the boy as he looks up and the camera zooms out to reveal that he is in a giant maze. He then walks back where he came from to find that he is in a house with Lifehouse playing on the television. He then jumps off a window sill and appears tiny as he walks up to a book that is bigger than him. It then transitions to Lifehouse playing the song as the boy gets up on a chair which slowly transcends into his original bed. The video then zooms out <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> lying on his bed and then switches to the band. It ends with the boy walking into darkness and Wade's face looking on the floor.|$|E

25|$|On August 9, 1991, just a {{month after}} being {{released}} from Bridgewater State Hospital, Bar-Jonah observed a seven-year-old boy sitting alone in a car outside of a post office in Oxford, Massachusetts. Bar-Jonah, who weighed 275 lbs {{at the time of}} the incident, entered the vehicle and sat <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy,</b> thrusting his mass atop the boy's fragile chest. Some witnesses, along with the boy's mother, observed the event and ran to the boy's rescue, causing Bar-Jonah to flee. An officer recognized Bar-Jonah's description from over 15 years earlier, and he was later arrested for the attack. At first, Bar-Jonah claimed that he entered the car to get out of the rain, but later admitted that he intended to kill the boy. For the attack, Bar-Jonah was sentenced to probation in Montana.|$|E

500|$|For several years, {{a medium}} in Block 12, Toa Payoh Lorong 7, had been {{performing}} noisy rituals {{in the middle}} of the night. [...] The residents complained several times to the authorities, but the rituals would always resume after a short time. [...] On the afternoon of 24January 1981, nine-year-old Agnes Ng Siew Heok (...) disappeared after attending religious classes at her church in Toa Payoh. [...] Hours later, her naked body was found stuffed in a bag outside a lift in Block 11, less than a kilometre (five-eighths of a mile) from the church. [...] The girl had been smothered to death; the investigation revealed injuries to her genitals and semen in her rectum. [...] Although the police launched an intensive investigation, questioning more than 250people around the crime scene, they failed to obtain any leads. [...] On 7February ten-year-old Ghazali bin Marzuki was found dead under a tree between Blocks 10 and 11, naked. [...] He had been missing since the previous day, after being seen boarding a taxi with an unknown woman. [...] Forensic pathologists on the scene deemed the cause of death as drowning, and found <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> suffocation marks similar to those on Ng. [...] There were no signs of sexual assault, but burns were on the boy's back and a puncture on his arm. Traces of a sedative were later detected in his blood.|$|E

2500|$|Apollonius {{may have}} {{introduced}} Marcus to Stoic philosophy, but Quintus Junius Rusticus {{would have the}} strongest influence <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy.</b> He was the man Fronto recognized as having [...] "wooed Marcus away" [...] from oratory. He was twenty years older than Marcus, older than Fronto. As the grandson of Arulenus Rusticus, one of the martyrs to the tyranny of Domitian (r. 81â€“96), he was heir to the tradition of [...] "Stoic opposition" [...] to the [...] "bad emperors" [...] of the first century; the true successor of Seneca (as opposed to Fronto, the false one). Marcus' tribute {{to him in the}} Meditations points to a move away from the oratorical training of Fronto. He thanks Rusticus for teaching him [...] "not to be led astray into enthusiasm for rhetoric, for writing on speculative themes, for discoursing on moralizing texts...To avoid oratory, poetry, and 'fine writing'".|$|E
