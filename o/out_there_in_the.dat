25|$|Uncertain {{of where}} the club would find {{adequate}} offensive production from second base, the Cardinals advised Carpenter to work <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> off-season prior to 2013. Considering that he had played mainly third base and had totaled just 18 total innings at second since the Cardinals drafted him – all during the 2012 season after his major league call-up – it was a bold move. After his tryout in spring training, he made the team as the starting second baseman.|$|E
25|$|It is {{that single}} word “usual” that brings you up short {{and lets the}} poem fan out. It points {{not just to the}} {{regularity}} of Robinson’s own days and years but to the engulfing possibility of a thousand Robinsons <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> subway and on the streets, all ticking their lives away like his soundless watch. The poem, entitled “Aspects of Robinson,” is the portrait of the postwar man of affairs: neither laborer nor magnate, but holding steady—and, at first blush, looking purposeful—within the middle rank. He is everything that Weldon Kees dreaded, as well as everything that he suspected he ought to be.|$|E

Robin Raftis, the white {{editor of the}} Cedar Key Beacon, tried to place the events in an open forum by printing Moore's story. She had been collecting anecdotes for many years, and said, [...] "Things happened <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> woods. There's no doubt about that. How bad? We don't know...

500|$|Pagans {{sometimes}} {{visit the}} site {{alone or in}} pairs, there to meditate, pray, or perform rituals, and some have reported experiencing visions there. A modern Druidic group known as Roharn's Grove hold regular rites at the site, particularly during the eight festivals {{that make up the}} Pagan Wheel of the Year. The Coldrums have also witnessed Pagan rites of passage; circa 2000, a handfasting—or Wiccan marriage ceremony—was held there. One member of the Odinic Rite, a Heathen organisation, gave their [...] "oath of profession" [...] to the group at the Coldrum Stones because they felt a particularly positive energy exists there. Politically motivated rituals have also been held at the site. In the late 1990s, the South London branch of the Paganlink organisation held a ritual at the Coldrum Stones in an unsuccessful attempt to prevent the construction of the Channel Tunnel Rail Link through the Medway Valley landscape. Another politically motivated Pagan rite was carried <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 2010s by The Warrior's Call, a group seeking to prevent fracking in the United Kingdom by invoking [...] "the traditional spirits of Albion" [...] against it.|$|E
500|$|Recording of {{the song}} started in September 1990 at Bearsville Studio A in Woodstock, New York. The song was {{arranged}} {{in the studio with}} mandolin, electric bass, and drums. Bassist Mike Mills came up with a bassline inspired by the work of Fleetwood Mac bassist John McVie; by his own admission he could not come up with one for the song that was not derivative. Buck said the arrangement {{of the song}} [...] "had a hollow feel to it. There's absolutely no midrange on it, just low end and high end, because Mike usually stayed pretty low on the bass." [...] The band decided to have touring guitarist Peter Holsapple play acoustic guitar on the recording. Buck reflected, [...] "It was really cool: Peter and I would be in our little booth, sweating away, and Bill and Mike would be <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> other room going at it. It just had a really magical feel." [...] Singer Michael Stipe's vocal was recorded in a single take. Orchestral strings, arranged by Mark Bingham, were added to the song by members of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra at Soundscape Studios in Atlanta, Georgia in October 1990.|$|E
500|$|The first season, which premiered on September 24, 2013, aired episodes that {{directly}} relate to {{events in the}} films [...] and Captain America: The Winter Soldier. The revelation in Captain America: The Winter Soldier that S.H.I.E.L.D. had been infiltrated by Hydra had {{a huge impact on}} the series. Regarding the synergy the show had with addressing events from the film, Loeb said, [...] "It's an extremely unique experience that doesn't exist anywhere else <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> entertainment business." [...] The second season, which premiered on September 23, 2014, introduces Inhumans to the MCU, ahead of their own television series. Additionally, a recurring plot point in the first two seasons involved the body of a member of the Kree race, who {{play a significant role in}} Guardians of the Galaxy. The third season, which premiered on September 29, 2015, introduces the concept of the Secret Warriors, with new Inhuman characters inspired by the comic of the same name, as well as Life Model Decoys. The fourth season, which premiered on September 20, 2016, sees Robbie Reyes / Ghost Rider introduced to the MCU, and ties to the second season of Agent Carter and Doctor Strange. The fifth season is scheduled to premiere on December 1, 2017.|$|E

50|$|Although {{within six}} months of the robbery ten of the robbers had been locked up {{awaiting}} trial and three others were wanted criminals on the run, very little of the money had actually been recovered. This has caused speculation that {{there is a great deal}} of robbery loot still <b>out</b> <b>there.</b> <b>In</b> fact, <b>the</b> money was soon seized and spent by predatory gangsters and greedy associates, relatives and lawyers. So the proceeds of the greatest cash robbery in British history were quickly used up, with few of the robbers receiving any real long-term benefit.|$|R

He chronicled his life in an autobiography called “Tepito Arte Acá” named after the art and social organization he founded.|$|R
500|$|Ultimately, {{the season}} {{featured}} several tie-in episodes with Marvel Cinematic Universe films: the episode [...] "The Well" [...] takes place directly {{after the events}} of the episode [...] "T.A.H.I.T.I." [...] introduces the alien race the Kree to the MCU (confirmed as such in the second season), members of which {{play a significant role in}} Guardians of the Galaxy; and the episodes [...] "End of the Beginning" [...] and [...] "Turn, Turn, Turn" [...] revolve around the events of Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Due to Captain America: The Winter Soldier revealing that Hydra had infiltrated S.H.I.E.L.D. with sleeper agents, the season sees a retooling for the final six episodes. Regarding the synergy the show has with addressing events from the films, Loeb said [...] "It's an extremely unique experience that doesn't exist anywhere else <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> entertainment business". The characters face the Hydra issue head on, while experiencing trust issues within themselves. Jed Whedon added that the Hydra element, which the show could not mention until after the release of The Winter Soldier in order to avoid spoiling the film, also attempts to address the lack of characters from the comics, a complaint fans had throughout the season, while also tying established threats such as the Clairvoyant, Project Centipede, and Deathlok, back into Hydra.|$|E
500|$|The Powerpuff Girls series {{debut on}} November 18, 1998, {{was the highest}} rated premiere in Cartoon Network's history at the time. During its run, the series {{consistently}} scored the highest rating for an original series each week for the network across {{a wide range of}} demographics—from young children to adults. In October 2000, Cartoon Network credited the series for its Friday night prime time ratings win among cable networks. By the end of 2000, merchandising based on the series encompassed a whole variety of products, including T-shirts, toys, video games, lunchboxes, and dishware. Concerning the show's success, Craig McCracken has stated, [...] "I thought it would get on Cartoon Network and college kids would watch it and there would be a few random T-shirts <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rave scene or in record shops. But I had no idea that it would take off to this extent." [...] Following the series' fourth season, the closing of Hanna-Barbera Productions and the death of its executive William Hanna in 2001, McCracken left it to focus on his new animated series, Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends, leaving Chris Savino to take his place and the production of The Powerpuff Girls was moved to Cartoon Network Studios. The show's last original run episode was on March 25, 2005; in all, six seasons were made. Cartoon Network had offered to give McCracken and Savino a seventh season of the series, but they believed the series had run its course.|$|E
500|$|The main {{ideas for}} The Altar and the Door were {{inspired}} roughly eighteen {{months before the}} album's release. Lead vocalist Mark Hall and his co-youth pastor were encouraged by one of their students to look at MySpace. According to Hall, “It wasn’t any major surprise, but we did {{see a lot of}} kids who had two worlds going on. MySpace can be Spring Break for the brain, this place you can go and not think anyone’s ever going to find out. Kids would be listed as Christians and then show their porn star name or what kind of kisser they are. They were just presenting so many contradictions on one page. The temptation was to just get upset and think that’s terrible. But MySpace isn’t really a big problem– it’s just revealing what the problem is". He noted that this situation isn't unique to teenagers and that while at church [...] "we [...] want to serve [...] " [...] but when [...] "we get <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world... it’s just different. We want to be accepted; we want friends. The compromises start coming in small little increments until you’re just kind of out there. Church becomes more of a guilt activator than a place to go to be with the Lord. It’s a nasty place to live, and we all live there". Hall says that [...] "When we’re at the altar, everything’s clear, and it all makes perfect sense, and we know how to live. We know what’s right and what’s wrong. The struggle is getting this life at the altar out the door... That’s the problem; we’re finding ourselves somewhere in the middle". Hall elaborated in a separate interview that [...] "Somewhere between the altar and the door, it all leaks out and I'm out here wondering what to do, rationalising things instead of living the life that's in me. So the struggle that we have as believers is trying to get those truths (that are) in our heads and highlighted in our Bibles out to our hands and feet. The songs are all the things that happen in the middle of that". Although Hall says that he [...] "always think lyrics first", he felt that [...] "Once we [...] got into the recording I knew we were in for something different, a more progressive approach to the music. These songs sounded different in my head; they've been a big challenge for us as a band. And the music definitely sets the tone for the whole project".|$|E
