5|$|Earp's {{good friend}} William Hart {{produced}} {{and wrote the}} seven-reel epic Wild Bill Hickok released by Paramount in 1923. It was the first movie to depict Wyatt Earp and the only movie that included his character before he died in 1929. Hart played Wild Bill Hickok and Bert Lindley played Earp. The role of Earp's character in the movie was very small. He appears {{at the back of}} a crowd scene when Hickok meets some gentlemen on the city street. Bert Lindley is not listed on some descriptions of the movie and this portrayal of Earp is often <b>overlooked.</b> Alan Barra, author of Inventing Wyatt Earp: His Life and Many Legends, <b>overlooked</b> this movie in his biography. Earp served as a technical adviser on the film.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} the Warren Hill would have <b>overlooked</b> a large river valley that was to become the English Channel. Once the sea had {{inundated}} the surrounding valley, Mesolithic hunter gatherers exploited the site.

5|$|But they <b>overlooked</b> that {{inexpensive}} aspirin {{had become}} available in India {{and other places}} after October 1918, when the Bayer patent expired. In responding, Starko pointed to anecdotal evidence of aspirin use in India and argued that even if aspirin over-prescription had not contributed to the high Indian mortality rate, it could still have been a factor for other high rates in areas where other exacerbating factors present in India played less of a role.|$|E

5|$|By 1947–48, Brown had recovered, so Harvey had {{to compete}} with him as well as Morris and Barnes for selection. In the first match of the season against the touring Indians, Harvey made 4 and 35. The {{following}} week, he made 89 in the first innings against South Australia but managed only three in the second innings as the Victorians collapsed to be all out for 182 and lost by nine wickets. Harvey was <b>overlooked</b> for the Australian XI for the Test trial against India the following week. Instead, {{he played in the}} match against Queensland, scoring only 13 and 3. He was subsequently <b>overlooked</b> for the Test selection. During this time, he played alongside Neil in all but the Queensland match, when his younger brother was playing in the Australian XI. However, neither batted together.|$|E

5|$|Carrick {{had been}} {{regularly}} <b>overlooked</b> by various England managers {{when it came}} to the central roles, with Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard generally being preferred. He started nine games under Sven-Göran Eriksson and his successor Steve McClaren. His last appearance under McClaren was in a 2–1 defeat at home to Germany in August 2007. Newly appointed manager Fabio Capello left Carrick out of his first England squad on 2 February 2008.

In November 2008, he returned to the squad for a friendly against Germany in Berlin. Starting alongside Gareth Barry in central midfield in England's 2–1 victory, he was named as Man of the Match by the BBC.|$|E

These were {{fortified}} with removable road blocks, barbed wire entanglements, and land mines. These passive defences were <b>overlooked</b> by trench works, gun and mortar emplacements, and pillboxes. In places entire villages were fortified using barriers of scaffolding, sandbagged positions and loopholes in existing buildings.|$|E
