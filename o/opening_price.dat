40|$|This study investigates {{emotions}} in Dutch newspaper articles {{and their effects}} on, and responses to, <b>opening</b> <b>prices</b> of 21 stocks listed on the Amsterdam Exchange index for twelve years (2002 – 2013). With regard to the financial context, we employed a selection of the Dutch Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count dictionary to automatically content analyze emotional tone in news articles (N = 128, 507). Neither positive nor negative {{emotions in}} news articles show consistent effects on the <b>opening</b> <b>prices</b> of stocks the following day. Granger causality tests suggest, however, that newspapers rather reflect movements {{on the stock market}} the following days by using more negative emotional words after an increase in the change of the <b>opening</b> <b>prices...</b>|$|R

40|$|Based on {{the theory}} of {{international}} stock market co-movements, this study shows that a profitable trading strategy can be developed. The U. S. market return is considered as overnight information by ordinary investors in the Asian and the European stock markets, and <b>opening</b> <b>prices</b> in local markets reflect the U. S. overnight return. However, smart traders would either judge the impact of overnight information more correctly, or predict unreleased information. Thus, the difference between expected <b>opening</b> <b>prices</b> based on the U. S. return and actual <b>opening</b> <b>prices</b> is counted as smart traders’ prediction power, which is either a buy or a sell signal. Using index futures price data from 12 countries from 2000 to 2011, cumulative returns on the trading strategy are calculated with taking into account transaction costs. The empirical {{results show that the}} proposed trading strategy generates higher riskadjusted returns than that of the benchmarks in 12 sample countries. The trading performances for the Asian markets surpass those for the European markets because the U. S. return is the only overnight information for the Asian markets whereas the Asian markets returns are additional information to the European investors...|$|R

50|$|Candlesticks {{are usually}} {{composed}} of the body (black or white), and an upper and a lower shadow (wick): the area between the open and the close is called the real body, price excursions {{above and below the}} real body are called shadows.

If the security closed higher than it opened, the body is white or unfilled, with the <b>opening</b> <b>price</b> {{at the bottom of the}} body and the closing price at the top. If the security closed lower than it opened, the body is black, with the <b>opening</b> <b>price</b> at the top and the closing price at the bottom.
