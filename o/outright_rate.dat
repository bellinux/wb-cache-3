Subsequently, some housekeeping genes such as the highly conserved 16 S rRNA and 23 S rRNA genes have been used. In {{spite of the fact}} that the <b>outright</b> <b>rate</b> of progress in the 16 S rRNA gene evolution is not known, it marks evolutionary distance and similarity of organisms (Thorne et al. 1998). Others have found the utilisation of 23 S rRNA groupings supportive in recognising similarity among Streptococcus spp. (Rantakokko-Jalava et al. 2000). Although few scientists agree on sole use of 16 S rRNA gene sequences (Roth et al. 1998), others view the combination of 16 S and 23 S rRNA gene grouping as a great tool for phylogenetic analysis (Song et al. 2004).|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The paper {{argues that}} Emerging Market economies (EMs) face {{financial}} vulnerabilities that weaken {{the effectiveness of}} a domestic Lender of Last Resort (LOLR). As a result, monetary policy is inextricably linked to the state of the credit market. In particular, the central bank should be ready to operate as LOLR during Sudden Stop (of capital inflows) by releasing international reserves in an effective manner. These conditions also impact on optimal monetary policy in normal but high-volatility periods. The paper further argues that during those periods interest rate rules may engender excessive volatility of exchange rates and, thus, that it may be advisable to temporarily supplement those rules by foreign exchange market intervention or <b>outright</b> exchange <b>rate</b> pegging. At a fundamental level, the analysis suggests that the state-of-the-art literature summarized by Woodford (2003) or even more heterodox approaches exemplified by Stiglitz and Greenwald (2003) are likely fall short of providing a satisfactory guide for monetary policy in EMs...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The Imo State Supervised Agricultural Credit Loans Board (ISACLB) has <b>outright</b> default <b>rates</b> of {{more than}} 50 percent. Thus, {{the purpose of this}} study is to {{identify}} the major characteristics of the Board's beneficiaries who completely failed to honour their repayment commitment as opposed to those who partially repaid. Design/methodology/approach – Data on 36 potential causes of delinquency were collected through questionnaires distributed to 182 defaulters across ISACLB's three regional zones from 1987 to 1997; ISACLB's only completed loan cycle. Descriptive statistics were obtained using the odds ratio technique. Thereafter, a binary logistic regression estimated the marginal effect on the outright default probabilities of each factor. Findings – ISACLB's large overdue problem was strongly linked to four key factors: age of borrowers, frequency of visits by loan officers-cum-extension agents, amount of savings deposits with informal clubs and total annual savings. Research limitations/implications – The primary drawback is the small size of the sample study, as well as the failure to correctly classify the partial defaulters in terms of the stage in the loan cycle at which they actually ceased to repay. Practical implications – In general, initiatives to attract young entrepreneurs, as well as to incorporate a FINCA-type savings scheme into the design of ISACLB's future lending programme should help to resolve its overdue dilemma. Social implications – Older traditional farmers are the principal defaulters. A targeted monitoring, training and information provision appears to be required. Originality/value – There are very few econometric studies dealing specifically with the characteristics of outright and partial microcredit defaulters...|$|R
40|$|We derive {{the exact}} drift {{velocity}} of plasma in the pulsar polar cap, {{in contrast to}} the order-of-magnitude expressions presented by Ruderman & Sutherland (1975) and generally used throughout the literature. We emphasize that the drift velocity depends not on the absolute value, as is generally used, but on the variation of the accelerating potential across the polar cap. If we assume that drifting subpulses in pulsars are indeed due to this plasma drift, several observed subpulse-drift phenomena that are incompatible with the Ruderman & Sutherland family of models can now be explained: we show that variations of drift <b>rate,</b> <b>outright</b> drift reversals, and the connection between drift rates and mode changes have natural explanations within the frame of the "standard" pulsar model, when derived exactly. We apply this model for drifting subpulses to the case of PSR B 0826 - 34, an aligned pulsar with two separate subpulse-drift regions emitted at two different colatitudes. Careful measurement of the changing and reversing drift rate in each band independently sets limits on the variation of the accelerating potential drop. The derived variation is small, ~ 10 ^{- 3 } times the vacuum potential drop voltage. We discuss the implications of this result for pulsar modeling. Comment: version published in Ap...|$|R
