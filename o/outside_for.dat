5|$|The Cheshire police {{response}} to the bank's report began with assessing the situation and setting up a vehicle perimeter, without revealing their presence. The police remained <b>outside</b> <b>for</b> {{more than half an}} hour, taking these preliminary measures, while the assailants were raping and murdering the women inside the house. The police dawdled at the scene, and made no effort to make the assailants aware of their presence.|$|E
5|$|Access and {{movement}} within the protected areas is restricted. In the lake area in particular, no motorized boats are permitted. Flying over the lakes is also discouraged except for scientific reasons. Vehicular traffic is {{banned in the}} reserved areas. Taking samples from the lake is to be kept to the minimum even for scientific studies and also the equipment brought from <b>outside</b> <b>for</b> sampling, {{and it must be}} thoroughly washed to avoid any type of contamination from outside. There are many more rules and regulations that are set by the authorities, which have to be strictly adhered to.|$|E
5|$|After {{learning}} {{that they have}} lost Prestige Direct, Jim, Dwight and Harry retreat <b>outside</b> <b>for</b> a coffee break. They end up having a conversation over {{what they would do}} with their lives, if they were not working for Dunder Mifflin. Jim jokingly says that he would be a beet growing competitor during the national contests while Harry would retire after selling one big item such as an airplane. Before he leaves, Harry says that Robert will be the ruin of the company and says they will not be working for Dunder Mifflin in six months, leaving a look of concern on Dwight and Jim's faces.|$|E

5|$|At {{the other}} extreme, {{in the more}} {{developed}} parts of the world, animals are often intensively managed; dairy cows may be kept in zero-grazing conditions with all their forage brought to them; beef cattle may be kept in high density feedlots; pigs may be housed in climate-controlled buildings and never go outdoors; poultry may be reared in barns and kept in cages as laying birds under lighting-controlled conditions. In between these two extremes are semi-intensive, often family run farms where livestock graze <b>outside</b> <b>for</b> much of the year, silage or hay is made to cover the times of year when the grass stops growing, and fertiliser, feed and other inputs are bought onto the farm from outside.|$|E
5|$|The Hotel New Otani Tokyo {{served as}} the <b>outside</b> <b>for</b> Osato Chemicals and the hotel's gardens were used for scenes of the ninja training. Bōnotsu in Kagoshima {{served as the}} fishing village, the Kobe harbour {{was used for the}} dock fight and Mount Shinmoe-dake in Kyūshū was used for the exteriors of SPECTRE's headquarters.

5|$|Approximately {{two weeks}} after {{violence}} broke out in Benghazi, Owumi {{received a call from}} his teammate Moustapha Niang, who said that Elturki would attempt to help the two players escape the country. Elturki had arranged for a car to take them to an Egyptian refugee camp in Sallum, following Al-Nasr coach Sherif Azmy. Owumi passed through several rebel checkpoints and arrived at the Egyptian border in 12 hours. Both Owumi and Niang, due to their appearance, were suspected of being foreign mercenaries fighting for Gaddafi and were subject to harsher treatment. Without proper immigration papers, Owumi was held in Sallum for three days. He was arrested and then imprisoned in solitary confinement for two hours. When he was removed, he had to sleep <b>outside</b> <b>for</b> three days. Owumi and Niang finally escaped the camp {{in the middle of the}} night. They bribed the driver of a bus, which only allowed Egyptian citizens, to help them leave. At around this time, Owumi received a call from Azmy, who wanted to meet him in his home in Alexandria. As a result, he convinced the driver, who was headed to Cairo, to lead them to another bus to Alexandria.|$|E
5|$|Devotees {{visit the}} temple {{to attend the}} daily pujas and make their offerings. Booths are erected <b>outside</b> <b>for</b> the sale of food, drink, brassware, pottery, cloth and holy images. On the {{penultimate}} day of the festival there is a procession, when {{the image of the}} goddess is placed upon a huge wooden chariot and pulled around the temple by devotees. On {{the final day of the}} festival, two large chariots are drawn by the devotees to the Deduru oya, a local river for the thirtham ("holy bath") ceremony when the images are dipped into the river. At the same time thousands of devotees also jump into the river. After the holy bath, the procession goes back to the temple along a route through Chilaw, accompanied by traditional Nadeswaram and Thavil musicians. The procession then passes the Ayyanayake and Kali temples prior to entering the main temple.|$|E
5|$|Gordon led on the lap-38 restart, {{followed}} by Truex and Burton. One lap later, Burton, with assistance from Johnson, passed Gordon for the lead. Kenseth claimed first position on lap 40 after {{driving on the}} outside lane. Vickers followed Johnson on the inside line to reclaim the lead on the following lap, before Sadler passed Vickers around the <b>outside</b> <b>for</b> the lead on the 44th lap. On lap 45, Mears led after passing Sadler, and debris was located on the backstretch, triggering a second caution. All drivers, including Mears, elected to make pit stops. Sadler reclaimed first position and led the field back up to speed at the lap-49 restart, ahead of Mears and Kyle Busch. Hamlin and Kyle Busch led the cars driving on the outside lane, with Busch claiming the lead on lap 51, pulling away {{from the rest of}} the field. Kurt Busch, with help from Vickers, got ahead of Kyle Busch to move into first place.|$|E

5|$|Magnussen made {{a second}} pit {{stop at the}} end of lap 16 for a {{steering-wheel}} change. On lap 17 Ricciardo went to the outside of Massa on the S-curves and moved inside, passing Massa to move into sixth. Rosberg was informed by team radio that more rain was expected within eight minutes. Vettel overtook Bottas around the <b>outside</b> <b>for</b> fourth place on the next lap. Bottas fell to fifth on the 19th lap, when Ricciardo passed him around the outside on the S-curves. Vettel began to reduce the time deficit to third-place Button, and Ricciardo was driving at a speed similar to his teammate. Bottas was caught by his Williams teammate Massa, who pulled away from Hülkenberg (who went off the track at the second turn). Both Red Bull drivers were the fastest by lap 21, but were 13 seconds behind Button and a further five seconds behind Rosberg (who, despite running off the track at 130R corner, had a shrinking one-second advantage over Hamilton). A dry line began to emerge by this time as some drivers drove through standing water to keep their tyre temperatures down.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Scully {{visit the}} murderer's house, where Mulder sees a {{repairman}} {{working on the}} cable line. They find hundreds of video tapes of the news. Scully believes all the violence the man watched on TV may have {{led him to the}} murders, something Mulder does not believe. That night Scully watches the tapes, seeing if there are any clues to why the man committed murder. She steps <b>outside</b> <b>for</b> a break and sees Mulder in a car talking to the Cigarette Smoking Man. In the morning Scully suspiciously asks Mulder if he moved the car in the night. When Mulder tells her he only went out for a paper earlier, she believes he is lying. The next day a similar murder occurs when a woman thinks she sees her husband in a hammock with another woman; in reality she has killed her neighbor who was in a hammock with his dog. Mulder sees the same cable repairman near the house, who escapes from him. Climbing up on the telephone pole Mulder finds a device inside the cable box.|$|E
5|$|Passenger traffic {{started on}} 10 October 1825, after the {{required}} licence was purchased, using the Experiment coach hauled by a horse. The coach was initially timetabled {{to travel from}} Stockton to Darlington in two hours, with a fare of 1s, and made a return journey {{four days a week}} and a one-way journey on Tuesdays and Saturdays. In April 1826 the operation of the coach was contracted for £200 a year; by then the timetabled journey time had been reduced to hours and passengers were allowed to travel on the <b>outside</b> <b>for</b> 9d. A more comfortable coach, Express, started the same month and charged 1s 6d for travel inside. Innkeepers began running coaches, two to Shildon from July, and the Union, which served the Yarm branch from 16 October. There were no stations: in Darlington the coaches picked up passengers near the north road crossing, whereas in Stockton they picked up at different places on the quay. Between 30,000 and 40,000 passengers were carried between July 1826 and June 1827.|$|E

5|$|Some drivers {{elected to}} make pit stops under caution. Fittipaldi had his {{engine control unit}} and spark box changed on lap 17 after he {{reported}} a problem with his car. Bräck remained the leader at the lap-21 restart and {{pulled away from the}} rest of the field. Andretti began to reduce the gap between Bräck and himself between laps 31 and 33. Tagliani reduced his pace between the second and third turns on lap 42, and was ordered by his engineer to enter the pit lane. His crew removed his car's left sidepod and retired on the next lap with a battery problem. A second caution was necessitated on the 46th lap when debris was located in turn two. The leaders made their pit stops because of the mandatory pit stop window. Fittipaldi's car problem re-emerged on the 44th lap despite having his vehicle's coils and springs changed; he drove to the pit lane to retire because his team's mechanics could not rectify the issue. Franchitti stalled his car because of a clutch issue. Bräck maintained the first position at the lap-52 restart, followed by Takagi. Nine laps later, Takagi attempted to pass Bräck around the <b>outside</b> <b>for</b> the first position but was unable to complete the manoeuvre because of the presence of slower cars.|$|E
5|$|The second {{version of}} the legend depicts Vithoba {{appearing}} before Pundalik as the five-year-old Bala Krishna (infant Krishna). This version is found in manuscripts of both Puranas, Prahlada Maharaj, and the poet-saints, notably Tukaram. The remaining {{version of the}} Pundalik legend appears in Sridhara and as a variant in the Padma Purana. Pundalik, a Brahmin {{madly in love with}} his wife, neglected his aged parents as a result. Later, on meeting sage Kukkuta, Pundalik underwent a transformation and devoted his life to the service of his aged parents. Meanwhile, Radha, the milkmaid-lover of Krishna, came to Dwarka, the kingdom of Krishna, and sat on his lap. Radha did not honour Rukmini, the chief queen of Krishna, nor did Krishna hold Radha accountable for the offence. Offended, Rukmini left Krishna and went to the forest of Dandivana near Pandharpur. Saddened by Rukmini's departure, Krishna searched for his queen and finally found her resting in Dandivana, near Pundalik's house. After some coaxing, Rukmini was pacified. Then Krishna visited Pundalik and found him serving his parents. Pundalik threw a brick <b>outside</b> <b>for</b> Krishna to rest on. Krishna stood on the brick and waited for Pundalik. After completing his services, Pundalik asked that his Lord, in Vithoba form, remain on the brick with Rukmini, in Rakhumai form, and bless His devotees forever.|$|E
5|$|Webber passed Rast for sixth place, while Poulsen retired {{because of}} {{accident}} damage {{while attempting to}} return to the pit lane. Dumas held a 24-second advantage over Lotterer with di Grassi in third, while Evans moved back into the LMP2 lead. Both Toyota cars were battling for fourth position with Webber close behind. Webber overtook Davidson for fifth at the Radillion corner exit moving ahead of Sarrazin on the Kemmel straight one lap later. Di Grassi slowed with technical problems and limped into his garage for an engine control unit and front-left nose change. Toyota's No. 1 car was pushed into its garage with mechanical problems; it rejoined the circuit for a few laps until a throttle problem emerged, causing the car to run at a reduced pace. Lotterer retook the lead after the No. 18 Porsche driver switch took longer than expected. Rast passed Conway around the <b>outside</b> <b>for</b> fourth at the Bus Stop chicane. Vilander challenged Lietz for second in LMGTE Pro until Vilander was issued a track limit abuse penalty. Lotterer and Lieb battled each other for first place. Lotterer drove defensively after passing slower traffic going into Les Combes corner to keep the position. Lieb ran wide off the track at the Stavelot corner exit while lapping a slower car.|$|E
