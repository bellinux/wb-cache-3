5|$|By February 1944, {{the reactor}} was {{irradiating}} {{a ton of}} uranium every three days. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>five</b> months, {{the efficiency of the}} separation process was improved, with the percentage of plutonium recovered increasing from 40 to 90 percent. Modifications over time raised the reactor's power to 4,000kW in July 1944. Unfortunately, the effect of the neutron poison xenon-135, one of many fission products produced from the uranium fuel, was not detected during the early operation of the X-10 Graphite Reactor. Xenon-135 subsequently caused problems with the startup of the Hanford B reactor that nearly halted the plutonium project.|$|E
