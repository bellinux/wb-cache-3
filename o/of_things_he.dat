500|$|... "Dear Future Husband" [...] is a pop, doo-wop and R song {{which runs}} for a {{duration}} of three minutes and four seconds. It opens {{with the sound}} of a stylus on a damaged vinyl before transcending into an old-fashioned ukulele melody. Musically, the track contains [...] "slick" [...] production and a rock-inspired drum beat, a [...] "zippy" [...] piano melody and [...] "ebullient" [...] brass instrumentation. In an interview with Popjustice's Peter Robinson, Trainor said: [...] "It's my lil' list <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> should probably be aware of if he wants to marry me. You need to take me on a date, bring me flowers every anniversary. Tell me I'm beautiful sometimes, if you wanna get that [...] "special loving".|$|E

500|$|After closing {{addresses}} from Kenealy and Hawkins, Cockburn began summing-up on 29 January 1874. His {{speech was}} prefaced by a severe denunciation of Kenealy's conduct, [...] "the longest, severest and best merited rebuke ever administered from the Bench {{to a member}} of the bar" [...] according to the trial's chronicler John Morse. The tone of the summing-up was partisan, frequently drawing the jury's attention to the Claimant's [...] "gross and astonishing ignorance" [...] <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> would certainly know if he were Roger Tichborne. Cockburn rejected the Claimant's version of the sealed package contents and all imputations against Katherine Doughty's honour. Of Cockburn's peroration, Morse remarked that [...] "never was a more resolute determination manifested [...] to control the result". While much of the press applauded Cockburn's forthrightness, [...] his summing-up was also criticised as [...] "a Niagara of condemnation" [...] rather than an impartial review.|$|E
500|$|The {{ceremony}} {{opened with}} a musical number which parodied the song [...] "Dancing Queen" [...] from Mamma Mia! The Movie. Awards were presented by John Wilson, the ceremony's founder. Awardees received a gold spray-painted raspberry worth $4.97. The Love Guru received three awards: Worst Picture, Worst Actor and Worst Screenplay. Worst Picture was the last award given out at the ceremony. John Wilson {{did not agree with}} the voters' determination on The Love Guru, and after viewing the film again in preparation for the ceremony, said to the Associated Press: [...] "A couple <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> did got me to laugh, and these days, two laughs in a comedy is a high ratio." [...] "The main thing wrong with it is no one said to Myers that it wasn't funny. He managed to offend the entire Indian population and his investors," [...] said Wilson in a statement in The Guardian. Wilson shredded a copy of The Love Guru at the awards ceremony.|$|E
500|$|Early episodes based much {{of their}} comedy on Stewie's [...] "super villain" [...] antics, such as his {{constant}} plans for total world domination, his evil experiments, plans and inventions to get rid <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> dislikes, and his constant attempts at matricide. As the series progressed, the writers and MacFarlane agreed that his personality and the jokes were starting to feel dated, so they began writing him with a different personality. Family Guy often includes self-referential humor. The most common form is jokes about Fox Broadcasting, and occasions where the characters break the fourth wall by addressing the audience. For example, in [...] "North by North Quahog", the first episode that aired after the show's revival, included Peter telling the family {{that they had been}} cancelled because Fox had to make room in their schedule for shows like Dark Angel, Titus, Undeclared, Action, That '80s Show, Wonderfalls, Fastlane, Andy Richter Controls the Universe, Skin, Girls Club, Cracking Up, The Pitts, Firefly, Get Real, Freakylinks, Wanda at Large, Costello, The Lone Gunmen, A Minute with Stan Hooper, Normal, Ohio, Pasadena, Harsh Realm, Keen Eddie, The $treet, The American Embassy, Cedric the Entertainer Presents, The Tick, Luis, and Greg the Bunny. Lois asks whether there is any hope, to which Peter replies that if all these shows are canceled they might have a chance; the shows were indeed canceled during Family Guys hiatus.|$|E

500|$|The {{search for}} a new guitarist and drummer began with {{advertisements}} placed in copies of Melody Maker. The invitation was spotted by drummer Phil Collins, formerly of Flaming Youth who already knew Stratton-Smith. He recalled, [...] "My only knowledge of Genesis was through seeing the ads for their gigs. It seemed like they were constantly working. ... I thought 'At least I'm going to be working if I get the gig'." [...] Roger Taylor, subsequently of Queen, turned down an invitation to audition. Collins went to the audition at Gabriel's parents' house in Chobham, Surrey with his Flaming Youth band mate, guitarist Ronnie Caryl. As they arrived early, Collins took a swim in the pool and heard what the other drummers were playing. [...] "They put on 'Trespass', and my initial impression of a very soft and round music, not edgy, with vocal harmonies and I came away thinking Crosby, Stills and Nash". Gabriel and Rutherford noticed the confident way Collins approached and sat at his drum kit and knew he would be the right replacement. Banks said, [...] "It was a combination <b>of</b> <b>things.</b> <b>He</b> could make it swing a little bit ... he could also tell good jokes and make us laugh ... And he could sing, which was an advantage because Mike and I were not very good at back-up vocals". In August 1970, Collins became the new drummer for Genesis. Caryl's audition was unsuccessful; Rutherford thought he was not the player the group were looking for.|$|E
500|$|The short {{focused on}} a boy named Pen and a dog named Jake as they learn from the Rainicorn that the Ice King has kidnapped Princess Bubblegum, {{in the hope of}} marrying her. Declaring that it's [...] "Adventure Time", Pen and Jake set off to the Ice King's {{mountain}} lair. Pen and the Ice King fight while Jake remains outside flirting with Lady Rainicorn, ignoring the battle. Just when Pen seems to be gaining the upper hand, the Ice King uses his [...] "frozen lightning bolts" [...] to freeze Pen in a block of ice. For unexplained reasons, this transports Pen's mind back in time, and to Mars, where he has a short motivational conversation with Abraham Lincoln. After being told to believe in himself, Pen's mind is returned to the present, where he breaks out of the ice, {{just in time to see}} the Ice King fly away with Princess Bubblegum. Chasing after him using Jake's extendable legs, Pen rescues the princess from the Ice King's grasp. Jake pushes the magical crown off the Ice King's head, thereby removing the King's source of power. The Ice King then plummets off screen, yelling a long list of complex threats <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> will do when he returns. The story closes with Princess Bubblegum giving Pen a kiss; he enjoys it, but is also greatly embarrassed by the act. He attempts to leave, but Jake claims that they have nowhere else to go and that there are no adventures that need them. However, some nearby ninjas are stealing an old man's diamonds, and they both run off in pursuit.|$|E

2500|$|Bad ending: Torque is in a semi-unconscious {{state on}} the shore of Carnate, with Killjoy (John Armstrong) berating him, telling him he thought he was cured, and warning if he thinks he has seen the worst <b>of</b> <b>things,</b> <b>he</b> is mistaken. With that, mercenaries arrive and place Torque on a helicopter, with one of them saying, [...] "we have secured the prime target." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, {{his book}} NO was {{published}} by Heartworm Press. This was widely regarded as a book defining Rice's personal philosophy. Rice defined the book as merely a [...] "laundry list" [...] <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> didn't believe in.

2500|$|On {{his return}} to Egypt, Qutb {{published}} [...] "The America that I Have Seen", where he became explicitly critical <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> had observed in the United States, eventually encapsulating the West more generally: its materialism, individual freedoms, economic system, racism, brutal boxing matches, [...] "poor" [...] haircuts, superficiality in conversations and friendships, restrictions on divorce, enthusiasm for sports, lack of artistic feeling, [...] "animal-like" [...] mixing of the sexes (which [...] "went on even in churches"), and {{strong support for the}} new Israeli state.

2500|$|B.Rozental, {{analyzing}} Merezhkovsky's {{political and}} religious philosophy, thus summed up the writer's position: [...] "The Law amounts to violence... The difference between legitimate power that holds violence 'in reserve' and violence itself is but a matter of degree: sinful are both. Autocracy and murder {{are nothing more than}} the two extreme forms of exhibiting [...] power." [...] Interpreting the Biblical version of the human history as a sequence of revolutionary events, Merezhkovsky saw religion and revolution as inseparable. It is just that for a social revolution to succeed, spiritual revolution should always come one step ahead of it. In Russia the lack of the latter brought about the former's fiasco, with Antichrist taking hold <b>of</b> <b>things,</b> <b>he</b> argued.|$|E
2500|$|Koinonoēmosunē {{is found}} only {{in the work of}} the emperor Marcus Aurelius (Meditations I.16), also known as a Stoic. (He uses the word on its own in a list <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> learned from his adopted father.) Shaftesbury and others felt it {{represented}} the Stoic Greek original, which gave the special Roman meaning of sensus communis, especially when used to refer to someone's public spirit. Shaftesbury explained the change of meaning as being due to the specific way that Stoics understood perception and intellect, saying that one should [...] "consider withal how small the distinction was in that Philosophy, between the [...] , and the vulgar [...] how generally Passion was by those Philosophers brought under the Head of Opinion".|$|E

2500|$|In Gaul, {{he studied}} the Celts. He left vivid {{descriptions}} <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> saw with his own eyes while among them: men who were paid to allow their throats to be slit for public amusement and the nailing of skulls as trophies to the doorways. But {{he noted that the}} Celts honored the Druids, whom Posidonius saw as philosophers, and concluded that, even among the barbaric, [...] "pride and passion give way to wisdom, and Ares stands in awe of the Muses." [...] He wrote a geographic treatise on the lands of the Celts which has since been lost, but which is referred to extensively (both directly and otherwise) in the works of Diodorus of Sicily, Strabo, Caesar and Tacitus' Germania.|$|E
2500|$|Armand contrasted his IA {{with social}} anarchist currents, rejecting {{revolution}}. He argued that waiting for revolution meant delaying {{the enjoyment of}} liberty until the masses gained awareness and will. Instead he advocated living under one's own conditions in the present time, revolting against social conditioning in daily life and living with those with an affinity to oneself in accord to the values and desire they share. He says the individualist is a [...] "presentist" [...] and [...] "he could not, without bad reasoning and illogic, think of sacrificing his being, or his having, to the coming of a state <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> will not immediately enjoy". [...] He applies this rule to friendship, love, sexual encounters and economic transactions. He adheres to an ethics of reciprocity and advocated propagandizing one's values to enable association with others to improve the chances of self-realization.|$|E

He preaches democracy one day but gives {{a vote to}} reactionary mullahs the next." [...] Khan has also been accused by some opponents and critics of hypocrisy and opportunism, including {{what has been called}} his life's [...] "playboy to puritan U-turn." [...] Political commentator Najam Sethi, stated that, [...] "A lot of the Imran Khan story is about backtracking on a lot <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> said earlier, which is why this doesn't inspire people." [...] Author Fatima Bhutto has criticised Khan for [...] "incredible coziness not with the military but with dictatorship" [...] {{as well as some of}} his political decisions.|$|E
