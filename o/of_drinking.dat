Robert Stubbs had captained a slave ship several decades earlier and he temporarily commanded Zong during Collingwood's incapacitation, but he was not a registered member of the vessel's crew. According to historian James Walvin, the breakdown of the command structure on the ship might explain the subsequent navigational errors and the absence of checks on supplies <b>of</b> <b>drinking</b> water.|$|E

40|$|Despite a {{long history}} of {{prevention}} efforts and federal laws prohibiting the consumption of alcohol for those below the age of 21 years, underage drinking continues at both a high prevalence rate and high incidence rate. The purpose of this research study is to explain underage <b>drinking</b> <b>of</b> alcohol conditioned by perception <b>of</b> peer <b>drinking.</b> An acquisition model is conjectured and then a relationship within the model is explained with a national sample of students. From a developmental perspective, drinking alcohol is acquired in a reasonably ordered fashion that reflects the influences over time of the culture, family, and peers. The study measures perceptions <b>of</b> alcohol <b>drinking</b> during early adolescence when alcohol use begins the maintenance phase of the behavior. The correlation between drinking alcohol and perception <b>of</b> classmate <b>drinking</b> can be described via social learning theory. Simultaneously the moderating effects of grade level, gender, and race/ethnicity are used to explain differences between groups. Multilevel logistic regression was used to analyze the relations. The researcher found support for an association between adolescent <b>drinking</b> and perceptions <b>of</b> classmate <b>drinking.</b> Gender and grade level moderated the relation. African-Americans consistently demonstrated less drinking and less perception <b>of</b> classmate <b>drinking</b> than either whites or other students not white nor African-American. The importance of {{a better understanding of the}} process <b>of</b> acquiring <b>drinking</b> behaviors is discussed in relation to future research models with longitudinal data. ...|$|R

5|$|A complex {{mixture of}} genetic and {{environmental}} factors influences {{the risk of the}} development of alcoholism. Genes that influence the metabolism of alcohol also influence the risk of alcoholism, and may be indicated by a family history of alcoholism. One paper has found that alcohol use at an early age may influence the expression of genes which increase the risk of alcohol dependence. Individuals who have a genetic disposition to alcoholism {{are also more likely to}} begin drinking at an earlier age than average. Also, a younger age of onset <b>of</b> <b>drinking</b> is associated with an increased risk of the development of alcoholism, and about 40 percent of alcoholics will drink excessively by their late adolescence. It is not entirely clear whether this association is causal, and some researchers have been known to disagree with this view.|$|E
