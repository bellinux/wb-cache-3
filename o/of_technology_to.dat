5|$|Plain milk was not {{consumed}} by adults except the poor or sick, being {{reserved for the}} very young or elderly, and then usually as buttermilk or whey. Fresh milk was overall less common than other dairy products {{because of the lack}} <b>of</b> <b>technology</b> <b>to</b> keep it from spoiling. Tea and coffee, both made from plants found in the Old World, were popular in East Asia and the Muslim world during the Middle Ages. However, neither of these non-alcoholic social drinks were consumed in Europe before the late 16th and early 17th century.|$|E
5|$|The flag {{inspired}} Jeff Thompson, {{assistant professor}} and program director of Visual Art and Technology at the Stevens Institute <b>of</b> <b>Technology,</b> <b>to</b> create a sound file of the AACS encryption key as a melody.

5|$|Command & Conquer {{is set in}} an {{alternate}} timeline, after a meteorite crashed near the river Tiber in Italy in 1995. The meteorite brings with it an extremely toxic alien substance called Tiberium, which becomes extremely valuable because {{of its ability to}} absorb and crystallize precious metals from the surrounding soil. An ancient, cultic secret society called the Brotherhood of Nod claims to have foreseen the potentials of this new substance, investing in the development <b>of</b> <b>technology</b> <b>to</b> harvest and refine Tiberium crystals ahead of the scientific community. Nod soon controls nearly half of the supply and uses these assets to sustain a rapidly growing army of followers worldwide. The group is led by a self-proclaimed messianic figure known only as Kane.|$|E

5|$|In the Halo universe, {{humans had}} {{advanced}} to a comparable level <b>of</b> <b>technology</b> <b>to</b> the Forerunners but, after losing {{a war with}} them, all human technology was destroyed and their intelligence reduced, leaving them in a subsistence economy with measures to prevent redevelopment of electronics. Humans {{are aware of the}} other, space-faring races, but their interactions are limited to visits from Forerunners as {{they do not have the}} technology to make contact themselves, they live in wooden buildings and have only primitive steam engines. The San'Shyuum (or Prophets as they are referred to in the Halo games) were also defeated by the Forerunners but their technology was not destroyed; they were instead confined to their home solar system and forbidden to manufacture weapons.|$|E
5|$|Leto {{played his}} first video {{game at the}} age of five, playing Super Mario Bros. In his early teens he played and won local video game competitions. At the age of 17, he broke the world record for points scored in the video game Crazy Taxi, and when Twin Galaxies, which records video game records, wanted more proof, he {{recorded}} a video of beating his own record. He then spent the next year focused on breaking video game records and eventually broke 742 of them. He had the highest number of records ever achieved until Tom Duncan surpassed him. Originally Zyos was interested in going to DigiPen Institute <b>of</b> <b>Technology</b> <b>to</b> learn how to create video games, but found it intense and that it was not his passion. Having dropped out of college, he later left his job at an ice cream shop at age 19 and began pursuing a career in professional gaming. In late 2002 Leto competed at AGP1, his first video game tournament, and though his team placed fifth, he ranked second individually out of three hundred players.|$|E
5|$|Milk was an {{important}} source of animal protein for those who could not afford meat. It would mostly come from cows, but milk from goats and sheep was also common. Plain fresh milk was not consumed by adults except the poor or sick, and was usually reserved for the very young or elderly. Poor adults would sometimes drink buttermilk or whey or milk that was soured or watered down. Fresh milk was overall less common than other dairy products because of the lack <b>of</b> <b>technology</b> <b>to</b> keep it from spoiling. On occasion it was used in upper-class kitchens in stews, but it was difficult to keep fresh in bulk and almond milk was generally used in its stead.|$|E

5|$|Robinson {{was born}} in 1923 in Crescent City, Florida, an {{outskirt}} of Jacksonville, to Glen Parmelee and Laura Mae (Lewis) Robinson. His family moved to Valdosta, Georgia, in 1937. After attending high school at Marion Military Institute in Alabama, Robinson opened a small machine shop in Valdosta. He sold industrial products and metal tools to local industry. In 1942, with the encouragement of his father, Robinson enrolled {{as a student at}} the Georgia Institute <b>of</b> <b>Technology</b> <b>to</b> study chemical engineering. However, his education was interrupted by his enlistment into the Naval Signal Corps and service in the Pacific Theatre of World War II where he installed telephones on recaptured American possessions during the war.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the Georgia Institute of Technology {{can be traced back}} to Reconstruction-era plans to develop the {{industrial}} base of the Southern United States. Founded on October 13, 1885 in Atlanta as the Georgia School of Technology, the university opened in 1888 after the construction of Tech Tower and a shop building and only offered one degree in mechanical engineering. By 1901, degrees in electrical, civil, textile, and chemical engineering were also offered. In 1948, the name was changed to the Georgia Institute <b>of</b> <b>Technology</b> <b>to</b> reflect its evolution from an engineering school to a full technical institute and research university.|$|E
5|$|With {{the tender}} relaunched in 2007 as the F-X2 competition, the Brazilian Defence Ministry looked to {{purchase}} at least 36 aircraft– {{with a potential}} for 84 additional aircraft– to replace the country's A-1Ms, F-5BRs, and Mirage IIIs. Among the participants were the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-16BR, JAS Gripen NG, Dassault Rafale, Eurofighter Typhoon and the modernized Su-35. Although the Brazilian government eliminated the Su-35 in 2008, Rosoboronexport subsequently offered to sell the country 120 aircraft with full technology transfer, as well as participation in the PAK FA programme. In December 2013, the Gripen NG light fighter was selected because of its low cost and the transfer <b>of</b> <b>technology</b> <b>to</b> the Brazilian industry.|$|E
