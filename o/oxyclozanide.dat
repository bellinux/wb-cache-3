50|$|Amphistomiasis is {{considered}} a neglected tropical disease, with no prescription drug for treatment and control. Therefore, management of infestation is based mainly on control of the snail population, which transmit the infective larvae of the flukes. However, there are now drugs shown to be effective including resorantel, <b>oxyclozanide,</b> clorsulon, ivermectin, niclosamide, bithional and levamisole. An in vitro demonstration shows that plumbagin exhibits high efficacy on adult flukes. Since the juvenile flukes are the causative individuals of the disease, effective treatment means control of the immature fluke population. Prophylaxis is therefore based on disruption of the environment (such as proper drainage) where the carrier snails inhabit, or more drastic action of using molluscicides to eradicate the entire population. For treatment of the infection, drugs effective against the immature flukes are recommended for drenching. For this reason <b>oxyclozanide</b> is advocated as the drug of choice. It effectively kills the flukes {{within a few hours}} and it effective against the flukes resistant to other drugs. The commercially prescribed dosage is 5 mg/kg body weight or 18.7 mg/kg body weight in two divided dose within 72 hours. Niclosamide is also extensively used in mass drenching of sheep. Successfully treated sheep regain appetite within a week, diarrhoea stops in about three days, and physiological indicators (such as plasma protein and albumin levels) return to normal in a month.|$|E
50|$|Symptoms {{are usually}} {{visible on the}} {{behaviour}} of the host. Infected sheep and cattle become severely anorexic or digest food inefficiently and become unthrifty. Continuous diarrhoea is an obvious indication of heavy infection in the digestive system, thus a primary diagnosis. The fluid faeces are examined to identify immature flukes. Paramphistomiasis is considered a neglected tropical disease, with no prescription drug for treatment and control. Thus management of infection is based mainly on to reduce the host snail population. There are some treatment strategies demonstrated. A common regime is to drench with hexachloroethane-bentonite-water suspension, which is highly effective against adult parasites. Treatments with reported success (efficacies >90%) are resorantel, <b>oxyclozanide,</b> clorsulon, ivermectin and the combination of bithional and levamisole. Most important commercial anthelmintics are shown to be practically useles, including albendazole, praziquantel, nitroxynil, triclabendazole, profenophos and netobimin; while niclosamide has high efficacy (99%) against immature fluke but not adult fluke, and 2-tertiary-butyl benzthiazole compound (CGA 72630), hexachlorophene and resorantel are highly effective against both adult and immature flukes.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Pharm.)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2004. Different {{formulations}} of dosage forms of niclosamide, levamisole HCI or levamisole HCI and <b>oxyclozanide</b> {{have been used}} on the local market {{for a very long}} time. Unfortunately, the spectrum of each of the drugs alone has a very narrow therapeutic index. Together, however, they have a broad spectrum of action and it is a solution to most of the helminths infestations today. Because of the increasing cost to produce livestock, it is important to formulate a product that is not only pharmacologically effective but also cost effective. A combination dosage form plays a big role in decreasing the cost of live stock production in that only one product is bought instead of more. A solution, suspension and tablet were formulated and tested. Niclosamide is very slightly soluble in water and is difficult to solubilise. A solution with niclosamide 3 %, <b>oxyclozanide</b> 3. 4 %, and levamisole HCI 2, 5 % was formulated. This was done because of the assumption that niclosamide is better absorbed in a solution and that the effective concentration needed is much lower. A suspension and a dispersible tablet with niclosamide 20 %, <b>oxyclozanide</b> 3. 4 %, and levamisole HCI 2, 5 % was formulated where the tablet is specially formulated to accommodate the smaller live stock farmers. All the above dosage forms were tested under accelerated stability conditions. Physical and chemical tests have been conducted on the dosage forms before and after storage at accelerated stability conditions. An assay was done on each of the three dosage forms where a HPLC method was developed and validated as there is no method in the literature that describe the simultaneous analyses of levamisole HCI, niclosamide and <b>oxyclozanide</b> in a dosage form.

Terpenoids contribute the highest fraction on quantitative study and acetone extract performed well for qualitative analysis. The in vitro incubation study and Relative Motility (RM) Value suggest that this tree fern extract had reliable source of anti-trematodal property but lesser potent than standard drug <b>oxyclozanide.</b> The anti-trematodal activity of M. fraxinea Sm. concluded further with morphology, ultrastructual and histopathological studies, evinced significant changes in teguments and suckers.

40|$|Anthelmintic {{drugs are}} widely used in {{veterinary}} medicine for protecting or treating animals mainly against gastrointestinal nematodes and trematodes. In general, they cause no human health risk if veterinary drugs are properly administered and the recommended doses are correctly adhered to. However, {{there may be a}} concern that if withdrawal periods are not adhered to or if products are administered to animals in unapproved applications (e. g. administration to lactating species) those levels may exceed MRLs in foods. In addiction, whenever chemicals are used, especially with long term low dose exposure, toxicological, teratological and carcinogenetic effects must be considered. Only a limited number of products are licensed for treatment of animals during the lactating period and have a MRL listed under European Commission Regulation 37 / 2010. The widespread availability of cheaper generic veterinary medicinal products and the development of drug resistance to the limited number of licensed products have increased the potential for off-label applications. SUMMARIES The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the persistence of <b>oxyclozanide</b> and levamisole residues in bovine milk after treatment with a combination product and their subsequent fate during cheese production. Animals were milked twice daily up to 16 days post treatment. Soft (3 d ripening), hard (35 d ripening) and whey cheeses were produced from the milk samples collected from first two milkings. Milk and cheese samples were subsequently analysed by UPLC-MS/MS. Highest levels of levamisole (< 600 µg/kg- 1) and <b>oxyclozanide</b> (< 25 µg/kg- 1) were determinate at first and third milking respectively. Levamisole residues were found to concentrate in all cheese types. There was a three fold concentration effect for levamisole in mature cheese. <b>Oxyclozanide</b> residues were found to occur at lower levels in soft and hard cheese than milk with a 10 -fold concentration in whey cheese compared to milk. Residues were found at higher levels in cheeses compared to the milk. The results of this study demonstrate that levamisole and <b>oxyclozanide</b> residues are rapidly excreted in dairy cows and milk is compliant after few days, but survive the fermentation process to persist in cheese. Nitroxynil is a halogenated phenol used to control fascioliasis in cattle and sheep. No. 35 pregnant dairy cows were treated in this study with a nitroxynil 340 mg/ml solution for injection at the recommended dose of 10 mg/nitroxynil per kg body weight at the start of the dry period, and from 53 to 74 days before the expected calving. Calving occurred between 43 days and 79 days after treatment. Subsequently, the concentrations of nitroxynil in the milk were monitored for up to 120 days after calving. Nitroxynil was detected by UHPLC-MS/MS (ultra high performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry). The present study quantified the residue concentrations of nitroxynil in the milk of cows which were treated by subcutaneous administration at the recommended dose of 10 mg nitroxynil per kg body weight at the beginning of the dry period.

In particular, copromicroscopic and slaughterhouse investigations reveal a marked drop of the prevalence of F. hepatica, an infestion “stability” for D. dendriticum, and an emerging role for paramfistomosis in cattle and sheep. A questionnaire compiled by practicioners on the control of D. dendriticum in sheep farms showed a scarce use of copromicroscopic diagnosis and the use not always rational dose and mode of administration of drugs. For this reason, experimental field trials were carried out to monitor the effectiveness of different treatment protocols implemented in the island which have indicated a probable resistance of D. dendriticum to albenzazole in sheep, on which this molecule seems to act at a double dosage than generally recommended for this fluke, while seems to be still effective against D. dendriticum in cattle. Optimal levels of efficacy were detected for <b>Oxyclozanide</b> + levamisole against sheep paramfistomosis only at doses 1. 5 times higher than that reported for other trematodosi (F. hepatica) ...|$|E

Seventy five naturally infected buffaloes were selected and divided into five equal groups i. e. A, B. C. D and E with 15 animals in each group. Each animal of group A was given Nilzan (1 ml/ 2 kg body weight), group B was given Fasifree (1 ml/ 4 kg) body weight), group C was given Irchasol (1 ml/ 2 kg body weight) group D was given Nilverm (1 ml/ 2 kg body weight), while group E was kept as untreated control. The efficacy of these anthelmintics was evaluated by counting eggs per grm (EPG) of faeces pre medication (on day zero) {{and then on}} day 7, 14 and 21 post medication. The mean efficacy of Nilzan, Fasifree and Irchasol was 97. 29 98. 5 and 85. 56 % respectively while Nilverm {{did not have any}} effect on Paramphistomiasis in buffaloes...|$|E
40|$|The {{halogenated}} salicylanilides are a {{large group}} of compounds developed mainly for their antiparasitic activity in animals. Several halogenated salicylanilides with potent antiparasitic activity have been synthesised of which only closantel, niclosamide, <b>oxyclozanide,</b> rafoxanide and resorantel are commercially available. Closantel and rafoxanide, which represent the most important drugs in the group, are used extensively for the control of Haemonchus spp. and Fasciola spp. infestations in sheep and cattle and Oestrus ovis in sheep {{in many parts of the}} world. Niclosamide is used extensively for its anticestodal activity in a wide range of animals. Antiparasitic activity of the halogenated salicylanilides has also been demonstrated against a large number of other internal parasites, in particular haematophagous helminths, and external parasites including ticks and mites, in a variety of animal species. Several cases of toxicity and mortality have been reported for closantel and rafoxanide in sheep and goats. Their unique pharmacokinetic behaviour appears to play an important role in the efficacy and safety of these compounds. The chemical and physical characteristics, mode of action, pharmacokinetics, antiparasitic activity and toxicity of the halogenated salicylanilides in animals are reviewed...|$|E

Total phenol, total terpenoids, total tannin and total flavonoids were quantitatively estimated. Total phenolic content was estimated by Folin- Ciocalteau method. Total flavonoid content {{was determined by the}} aluminium chloride colorimetric method. In-vitro incubation study of Marattia fraxinea Sm. extracts against Gastrothylax crumenifer were performed using 25  ml of Hedon-Fleig (H-F) salt solution containing various concentrations (1, 2, 3, 4 and 5  mg/ml) respectively as test extracts, positive control <b>Oxyclozanide</b> @ 1 % (250  mg/ 25  ml) and negative control H-F salt solution, distributed to 7 -Petri plates in an incubator with 5 % CO 2 at 37  °C. Twenty five amphistomes were incubated and the motility of control and test group was observed under dissection microscope at a regular time interval of (0, 10, 15, 30 and 60) min respectively. The motility response of the parasites was categorized with specific score 3, 2, 1, 0 respectively. Relative Motility (RM) value and Lethal Concentration 50 (LC 50) were determined by probit regression analysis. Ultrastructure and histopathological changes on morphology of G.crumenifer were interpreted. The bioactive compounds were analysed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) instrument.|$|E
40|$|S 100 A 4 and S 100 A 9 {{proteins}} {{have been}} described as playing roles in the control of tumor growth and metastasis. We show here that a chemical probe, <b>oxyclozanide</b> (OX), selected for inhibiting the interaction between S 100 A 9 and the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) interacts with both S 100 A 9 and S 100 A 4. Furthermore, we show that S 100 A 9 and S 100 A 4 interact with RAGE and TLR 4; interactions that can be inhibited by OX. Hence, S 100 A 4 and S 100 A 9 display similar functional elements despite their primary sequence diversity. This was further confirmed by showing that S 100 A 4 and S 100 A 9 dimerize both in vitro and in vivo. All of these interactions required levels of Zn(++) that are found in the extracellular space but not intracellularly. Interestingly, S 100 A 4 and S 100 A 9 are expressed by distinct CD 11 b(+) subpopulations both in healthy animals and in animals with either inflammatory disease or tumor burden. The functions of S 100 A 9 and S 100 A 4 described in this paper, including heterodimerization, may therefore reflect S 100 A 9 and S 100 A 4 that are released into the extra-cellular milieu...|$|E
40|$|A {{possible}} {{link between}} the level of glutathione S-transferase (GST, E. C. 2. 5. 1. 18) activity {{and the development of}} salicylanilide resistance in Fasciola hepatica was investigated. Various isolates of F. hepatica with varying susceptibilities to salicylanilides were isolated and maintained in the laboratory. Individual flukes of these isolates were surveyed for their level of GST activity and a correlation between the level of GST activity and drug efficacy was found. In contrast to most other studies, a decrease in GST activity was associated with an increase in drug resistance. Evidence was collected to show that this may be a selective process since flukes which had survived exposure to rafoxanide and closantel in vivo (in sheep) had lower activity levels of GST than flukes from untreated sheep. Treatment with other flukicides (<b>oxyclozanide,</b> luxabendazole and triclabendazole) did not have this effect. Furthermore, in vivo treatment with closantel induced selection of particular isoenzymes in different isolates of F. hepatica having different degrees of susceptibility to closantel. However, no single isoenzyme or isoenzyme profile was associated with resistance and, in total, up to 8 different isoenzymes could be present in a single isolate. Thus, GST has some potential as a marker enzyme for salicylanilide resistance in F. hepatica. However, the precise role of GST in resistance is unclear and the extensive inter- and intra-isolate variation in activity levels and isoenzyme characteristics of this enzyme indicate the need for considerably more study before application in field situations...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAnthelmintic {{drugs are}} widely used for {{treatment}} of parasitic worms in livestock but {{little is known about}} the stability of their residues in food under conventional cooking conditions. As part of the European Commission-funded research project ProSafeBeef, cattle were medicated with commercially available anthelmintic preparations, comprising 11 active ingredients (corresponding to 21 marker residues). Incurred meat and liver were cooked by roasting (40 min at 190 °C) or shallow frying (muscle 8 - 12 min, liver 14 - 19 min) in a domestic kitchen. Raw and cooked tissues and expressed juices were analysed using a novel multi-residue dispersive solid phase extraction method (QuECheRS) coupled with Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry. After correction for sample weight changes during cooking, no major losses were observed for residues of <b>oxyclozanide,</b> clorsulon, closantel, ivermectin, albendazole, mebendazole or fenbendazole. However, significant losses were observed for nitroxynil (78 % in fried muscle, 96 % in roast muscle), levamisole (11 % in fried muscle, 42 % in fried liver), rafoxanide (17 % in fried muscle, 18 % in roast muscle) and triclabendazole (23 % in fried liver, 47 % in roast muscle). Migration of residues from muscle into expressed cooking juices varied between drugs, constituting 0 % to 17 % (levamisole) of total residues remaining after cooking. With the exception of nitroxynil, residues of anthelmintic drugs were generally resistant to degradation during roasting and shallow frying. Conventional cooking cannot, therefore, be considered a safeguard against ingestion of residues of anthelmintic veterinary drugs in beef...|$|E
30|$|The major {{target organ}} that was highly {{affected}} is the tegument and suckers that damages were observed by LM and SEM. The extract effects were less severe than <b>Oxyclozanide</b> at high concentration (5  mg/ml) The sequences of tegumental surface changes were similar for all doses of extract compared to OXY, {{that consisted of}} swelling, fibrous network formation between major and minor folds, blebbing and subsequent rupture, which lead to erosion and desquamation of the tegument, and finally the exposure and disruption of basal lamina. The tegument is an important structure of parasite because it provides covering and protection of the parasite’s body, and supports internal organs. It also controls the secretion, synthesis, perception of sensory stimuli and osmoregulation. It was demonstrated that tegument is a major target of extract, which was probably absorbed by the tegument. The initial tegument swelling {{was believed to be}} part of the general response of the fluke to a stress situation, representing an attempt by the fluke to replace damaged surface membrane [67], caused by osmotic imbalance, due to the disruption of ion pumps present on the apical plasma membrane [68]. This was followed by swelling, blebbing, disruption, erosion and lesion. Once the surface layer is totally destroyed, the drug could penetrate deeper into the muscular layer and caused motility reduction and cessation that lead to death. Regional difference of responses to the M. fraxinea Sm. extract were also observed, with the ventral being more severely affected than the dorsal surface, and the anterior and middle third regions as well as the lateral margins of the flukes were generally more suffered than the posterior region. The early changes were found at the oral sucker and the genital pore, which exhibited the swollen appearance and scattered blebs along their rims. The acetabulum also was distorted. Surface changes observed in the present study resembles that demonstrated on F. gigantica treated with aqueous extract of Artocarpus lakoocha [11], and on P. Microbothrium treated with artemether [69].|$|E
30|$|The {{results of}} the {{phytochemical}} screening and quantitative estimation of the chemical constituents of plant sample have indicated high content of terpenoids, total tannin, total phenol and flavonoids. Terpenes are widespread in nature, mainly in plants as resent constituents of essential oils. Saponin as a group include compounds that are glycosylated steroids, triterpenoids and steroids alkaloids. Many saponin {{are known to be}} antimicrobial to inhibit mould, and protect plant from insect attacks. Saponins may be considered as a part of plants defence systems found in plants named phytoanticipins or phytoprotectants [43]. These structurally diverse compounds have also been observed to kill protozoans and helminths, to be antioxidants and also acts as antifungal and antiviral [44, 45]. Xanthorrhizol is a bisabolane type sesquiterpenoid compound posses variety of antimicrobial, antioxidant, anthelmintic activity [46]. Essential oils are formed by aromatic odor as secondary metabolites, composed of terpenes or terpenoids. The cytotoxic activity of essential oils is mostly due to the presence of phenols, aldehydes and alcohols [47] and are effective against a large variety of organisms including bacteria, fungi, viruses, protozoa as well as metazoan parasites [48]. Flavonoids are potent secondary metabolites having high anthelmintic activity and the toxicity of most isolated flavonoids in animal cells is very low [49], several ubiquitous flavonoids genistein, kaemferol, rutin, quercetin etc., showed deleterious effects on selected species of parasitic helminths. Flavonoid kaempferol exerted a strong adulticidal activity on Schistosoma mansoni [50]. The anthelmintic activity of flavonoids, genistein, isoflavones found in the root extracts of Flamingia vestita [51] mediated its action on cellular/molecular targets in mammals. In flatworms they act on tegumental enzymes causing paralysis and death [52]. The approved anthelmintics for trematodes are <b>Oxyclozanide,</b> Praziquatel and Triclabendazole, however the rapid spread of triclabendazole resistance is an important motivation for drug discovery of novel trematodicidal drugs [53]. Dryopteris filix-mas (Dryopteridaceae), contains vermicidal phloroglucinols, such as aspidin, deaspidin and filixic acid are active against intestinal cestodes, paralyze the worm’s tegument [54]. Pelletierine an anthelmintic alkaloids from Punica granatum (Lythraceae) and arecoline from Areca catechu (Arecaceae) target acetylcholine receptors [20].|$|E
40|$|S 100 A 9 {{is a small}} (13 kD) cytosolic calcium-binding protein. The {{protein is}} mainly {{expressed}} in neutrophils and monocytes in human but can also be expressed in other cell types under inflammatory conditions. S 100 A 9 is normally co-expressed with S 100 A 8 and forms S 100 A 8 /S 100 A 9 heterodimers. Previous publications had suggested that S 100 A 9 could be expressed without S 100 A 8 in certain conditions. Various functions for cytosolic S 100 A 8 /S 100 A 9 heterodimers have been described. The heterodimer can promote NADPH oxidase activation, is involved in reactions mediated by the iNOS enzyme and assists in tubulin polymerization. Extracellular S 100 A 9 can bind to TLR 4 and RAGE. Upon binding TLR 4, S 100 A 9 functions as a DAMP molecule inducing a pro-inflammatory cellular response. This thesis mainly focuses on the pro-inflammatory function of hS 100 A 9. In paper I, the main questions we asked were: in what condition hS 100 A 9 could exist in cells without hS 100 A 8 ? We found that the half-life of hS 100 A 9 protein was short and degraded fast in cells, but can be stabilized by co-expressing with hS 100 A 8 or by proteasome inhibitor. We also found that inflammatory stimuli could also stabilized hS 100 A 9 protein and promoted the formation of proteolytically-resistant homodimer. This paper suggests that during inflammatory condition, hS 100 A 9 protein {{might be able to}} exist as homodimer without hS 100 A 8 and that it therefore may function as DAMP molecule after it has been released out of the cell. In paper II, we showed that a chemical probe <b>oxyclozanide</b> could inhibit S 100 A 9, S 100 A 4 and S 100 A 4 /S 100 A 9 binding to TLR 4 and RAGE and inhibiting tumor progression in a mouse model. We also showed that hS 100 A 4 and hS 100 A 9 can form heterodimers. Further, we showed that S 100 A 4 and S 100 A 9 are differentially expressed in mouse myeloid cell populations. In paper III, we wanted to identify co-receptor(s) involved in S 100 A 9 -mediated stimulation of TLR 4. We show that CD 14 is an essential co-receptor of this stimulation. Our data also suggest that some other co-receptor(s) might exist that help in S 100 A 9 binding to cell membrane. However CD 14 was crucial both for S 100 A 9 signaling and internalization. In summary, in this thesis we discuss the relation between S 100 A 9 and inflammation. We show that during inflammation, the pro-inflammatory cytokine could stabilize the unstable hS 100 A 9 by promoting it forming proteolytically-resistant homodimer. After S 100 A 9 released out of the cell, they could function as DAMP molecule activating TLR 4 in a CD 14 dependent way. By blocking the interaction between the S 100 s with their receptors using OX, we propose a compound with clinical potential for treating inflammation and cancer...|$|E
