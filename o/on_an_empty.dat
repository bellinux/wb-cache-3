40|$|Forty-two {{patients}} {{affected by}} osteoarthritis {{have been treated}} with two parallel schemes, in double blind, according to parallel groups, to have a correct evaluation of the efficacy and safety of Amtolmetin Guacyl administration on at full stomach or <b>empty</b> stomach. <b>As</b> parameters of efficacy the spontaneus pain and the pain caused by movements, the function and joint pain have been considered, while gastric tolerance has been evaluated by means of daily records made by patients and the general tolerance through an annotation of adverse events, vital signs as well as parameters of laboratory. The drug worked for both groups, {{but it has been}} particulary efficent in those who have assumed the drug <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>empty</b> stomach. The general tolerance has been good and some adverse side effects, concerning the gastric tolerance, have disappeared by reducing the dosage of the drug.

5|$|Wine was {{considered}} the basic drink, consumed at all meals and occasions by all classes and was quite inexpensive.

An accurate accusation of being an alcoholic was {{an effective way to}} discredit political rivals. Prominent Roman alcoholics included Marcus Antonius, and Cicero's own son Marcus (Cicero Minor). Even Cato the Younger was known to be a heavy drinker.|$|E
5|$|After {{scouting}} Vancouver for a {{place to}} film scenes that involved the Swan house, {{the decision was made to}} recreate the house <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>empty</b> lot with a tree line and approaching road. The production team was able to rearrange the exterior of the house to match that in the first movie. When faced with creating the interior, the team measured the house in Portland, and built various pieces of the house on the lot and on a stage in Vancouver. The second film also attempted to clarify the location of Bella's room, which, as seen in the first film, seemed to be located in the front of the house, when in reality it was on the right-hand side. Complications arose when the Portland house was repainted after Twilights release, which took away the aging the house had come to depict in the film. When recreating the house, the production team referenced the first film on high-definition Blu-ray Disc.|$|E
