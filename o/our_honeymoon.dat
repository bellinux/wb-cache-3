60|$|Try, dear, to {{remember}} those pleasant {{days when you}} were staying with us, in <b>our</b> <b>honeymoon</b> time, at Paris.|$|E
6000|$|... 'We're on <b>our</b> <b>honeymoon.</b> Charlie {{wanted to}} come to New York. I didn't want to, but he was set on it. He's been here before.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Why, no, sweetheart,' laughed Kenneth. 'The {{captain of}} The Fair Lady will take his bride with him. We'll spend <b>our</b> <b>honeymoon</b> {{on the high}} seas, Ursula, and the cold Canadian winter under {{southern}} palms.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Maiden, if I may counsel, drain [...] Each drop of this enchanted season, For even <b>our</b> <b>honeymoons</b> must wane, [...] Convicted {{of green}} cheese by Reason.|$|R
6000|$|... "We went to Switzerland. Didn't we agree--it was <b>our</b> second <b>honeymoon.</b> It isn't {{a honeymoon}} we need. No, we'll {{have to go}} further than that." ...|$|R
60|$|I had all my {{reward for}} all that I had given up. I forgot Mr. Playmore; I forgot Gleninch. <b>Our</b> new <b>honeymoon</b> dates, in my remembrance, from that day.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't know. Sister {{wants to}} come soon, but I'd rather have <b>our</b> <b>honeymoon</b> somewhere else,--Niagara, Newfoundland, West Point, or the Rocky Mountains," [...] said Thorny, {{mentioning}} {{a few of the}} places he most desired to see.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not now," [...] she refused. [...] "We must {{remember}} that Reginald is learning table manners; if we act too badly through <b>our</b> <b>honeymoon,</b> he may notice shortcomings when we get home. Besides, he's coming--the waiter's coming. Be dignified." ...|$|E
60|$|The doctor {{then went}} into a {{detailed}} statement. The boat was stranded {{on the shore of}} the Scoldsbury river not far below Ginx's. We knew where Ginx's was, because we had spent a very happy day there, during <b>our</b> <b>honeymoon.</b>|$|E
60|$|And then, with a {{blast of}} the whistle and the lighted cars clashing as they lurched {{up out of the}} prairie, the Atlantic express rolled in and bore us east to enjoy <b>our</b> belated <b>honeymoon.</b>|$|R
6000|$|So great her absentmindedness she droops as in a swoon, And a {{movement}} of aversion mars her recent spousal grace, And in silence we two sit here in <b>our</b> waning <b>honeymoon</b> [...] At this idle watering-place [...] .|$|R
60|$|His {{brightening}} eyes {{told me that}} {{he really}} meant what he said. We sealed our compact with a kiss. Pardon me for mentioning these trifles--I am still writing (if you will kindly remember it) of <b>our</b> new <b>honeymoon.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{got some}} bad news, Honora," [...] he said. [...] "That is, bad {{from the point}} of view of <b>our</b> <b>honeymoon.</b> Sid Dallam is swamped with business, and wants me in New York. I'm afraid we've got to cut it short." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well, marry me; we {{will spend}} <b>our</b> <b>honeymoon</b> there; perhaps {{then you will}} be willing to spend one more year here with me, and then--well--Never cross the range till you get to it is a maxim of the trail." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{shall be}} married very soon, take a wedding trip to {{any part of}} the world you like, and <b>our</b> <b>honeymoon</b> will last for ever, Mrs. Sterling, Jr.," [...] said David, soaring away into the future with sublime {{disregard}} of obstacles.|$|E
6000|$|... "It isn't {{exactly one}} of my privileges," [...] he declared, [...] "to fix upon the spot where we shall take <b>our</b> belated <b>honeymoon,</b> but I haven't been in Belgrade for years, and I know you'd like to see your people." ...|$|R
60|$|How it is I know not; {{but there}} is no place like a bed for {{confidential}} disclosures between friends. Man and wife, they say, there open the very bottom of their souls to each other; and some old couples often lie and chat over old times till nearly morning. Thus, then, in <b>our</b> hearts' <b>honeymoon,</b> lay I and Queequeg-- a cosy, loving pair.|$|R
60|$|But all {{our hopes}} of a happy snug Clematis Lodge were dashed to the ground on our return from <b>our</b> little <b>honeymoon</b> excursion; when Mrs. Hoggarty {{informed}} us that she was sick of the country, and was determined to go to London with her dear nephew and niece, and keep house for them, and introduce them to her friends in the metropolis.|$|R
6000|$|... "We will {{go abroad}} or to Scotland for <b>our</b> <b>honeymoon,</b> till the storm blows over," [...] said Sir John, well {{knowing that this}} hasty {{marriage}} would surprise or offend all his relations, and feeling as glad as Jean to escape the first excitement.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, 'that's a {{pleasure}} all the greater for being deferred,'" [...] quoted Anne. [...] "I'm so glad {{we decided to}} spend <b>our</b> <b>honeymoon</b> here. Our memories of it will always belong here, in our house of dreams, instead of being scattered about in strange places." ...|$|E
60|$|Neighbours in London! The Ramboats did {{not know}} the names of the people on either side of them. As I waited for Marion before we started off upon <b>our</b> <b>honeymoon</b> flight, Mr. Ramboat, I remember, came and stood beside me and stared out of the window.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes for me. If the boy {{includes}} us {{old folks}} in his festivity, {{it will be}} as good as a week's port wine. You doubt, my sweet Enid. Has not <b>our</b> long <b>honeymoon</b> at Vale Leston helped us all this time?' Her name was Mary, but having once declared her to be a woman made of the same stuff as Enid, he had made it his pet title for her.|$|R
6000|$|... "No. At first I {{used to play}} a {{good deal}} for him, knowing that he was fond of music, and fancying--poor fool that I was! [here Marian spoke so bitterly that Nelly turned and looked hard at her] that {{it was part of a}} married woman's duty in a house to supply music after dinner. At that time he was working hard at his business; and he spent so much time in the city that he had to give up playing himself. Besides, we were flying all about England opening those branch offices, and what not. He always took me with him; and I really enjoyed it, and took quite an {{interest}} in the Company. When we were in London, although I was so much alone in the daytime, I was happy in anticipating <b>our</b> deferred <b>honeymoon.</b> Then the time for that paradise came. Ned said that the Company was able to walk by itself at last, and that he was going to have a long holiday after his dry-nursing of it. We went first to Paris, where we heard all the classical concerts that were given while we were there. I found that he never tired of listening to orchestral music; and yet he never ceased grumbling at it. He thought nothing of the great artists in Paris. Then we went for a tour through Brittany; and there, in spite of his classical tastes, he used to listen to the peasants' songs and write them down. He seemed to like folk songs of all kinds, Irish, Scotch, Russian, German, Italian, no matter where from. So one evening, at a lodging where there was a piano, I played for him that old arrangement of Irish melodies--you know--'Irish Diamonds,' it is called." ...|$|R

Please sign below, and give address and date. iii In this thesis we examine the use of the computer algebra system Maple for control system theory. Maple is an excellent system for the manipulation of expres-sions used by control system engineers, but so far it is not widely used by the public for this purpose. Many of the algorithms in Maple were implemented because their application in control theory is known, but this functionality has not been compiled in a meaningful way for engineers. Over the past two years we have investigated what functionality control system engineers need and have attempted to fill in the gaps in Maple’s functionality to make it more useful to engineers. iv Acknowledgements I would like to thank my supervisor, Dr. George Labahn, for his assistance and guidance in preparing this thesis. I also extend thanks to the readers, Dr. Justin Wan and Dr. Keith Geddes, whom I met in the classrooms of this university. A special debt of gratitude is owed to Venus, who accompanied me on <b>our</b> extended <b>honeymoon</b> in Waterloo this summer. Thank you for your patience during this project. I would like to thank Shannon Puddister for his input regarding the user inter-face from an engineering perspective. Thanks also to the Symbolic Computation Group, Waterloo Maple and ORCCA, for financial and academic support...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{had better}} not wait till then, Jane," [...] said Mr. Rochester, when I read her letter to him; [...] "if she does, {{she will be}} too late, for <b>our</b> <b>honeymoon</b> will shine our life long: its beams will only fade over your grave or mine." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{was full}} of the ideal of hard {{restrained}} living and relentless activity, and throughout a beautiful November at Venice, where chiefly we spent <b>our</b> <b>honeymoon,</b> we turned {{over and over again}} and discussed in every aspect our conception of a life tremendously focussed upon the ideal of social service.|$|E
6000|$|... "To {{tell you}} the truth, I feel it. You see, years ago, when we started out for <b>our</b> <b>honeymoon,</b> there was a crisis after the first week {{and we had to}} rush back to England. We seem to have {{forgotten}} to ever finish that honeymoon of ours. We are doing it now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Was {{there not}} a custom," [...] she said, still gazing {{down into the}} wet, glistening street, [...] "among one of the ancient peoples, I forget which, ordaining that when a man and woman, loving one another, or {{thinking}} that they loved, had been joined together, they should go down upon their wedding night to the temple? And into the dark recesses of the temple, through many winding passages, the priest led them until {{they came to the}} great chamber where dwelt the voice of their god. There the priest left them, clanging-to the massive door behind him, and there, alone in silence, they made their sacrifice; and in the night the Voice spoke to them, showing them their future life--whether they had chosen well; whether their love would live or die. And in the morning the priest returned and led them back into the day; and they dwelt among their fellows. But no one was permitted to question them, nor they to answer should any do so. Well, do you know, <b>our</b> nineteenth-century <b>honeymoon</b> at Brighton, Switzerland, or Ramsgate, as the choice or necessity may be, always seems to me merely another form of that night spent alone in the temple before the altar of that forgotten god. Our young men and women marry, and we kiss them and congratulate them; and, standing on the doorstep, throw rice and old slippers, and shout good wishes after them; and he waves his gloved hand to us, and she flutters her little handkerchief from the carriage window; and we watch their smiling faces and hear their laughter until the corner hides them from our view. Then we go about our own business, and a short time passes by; and one day we meet them again, and their faces have grown older and graver; and I always wonder what the Voice has told them during that little while that they have been absent from our sight. But of course it would not do to ask them. Nor would they answer truly if we did." ...|$|R
40|$|Transcription begins] 6 December 1944 Somewheres [sic] in Germany My darling Bubs, Today I {{was a most}} happy {{youth and}} no doubt you know the reason why. I {{received}} 2 air mail letters from you dated the 21 [st] and 27 [th] of November and {{a letter from the}} Rosens dated 25 Oct. which they addressed to the 227 th F. A. Bn. Imagine darling, your letter of the 27 [th] reached me in 8 days. It’s wonderful! Also I was thrilled to hear that you received my letters dated the 15 [th] and 16 [th] of Nov. By now, you should be receiving a steady stream of them. One of these days you should be receiving all the back letters. Your letters have been coming in quite regularly and I have no complaints. I’m still “sweating out” the cablegrams which you sent me as well as the packages. To date I received packages from the Ruebens [sic], The Workingmen’s Circle, Bnai Brith [sic], and the lighter from Mort, as well as the camera—that’s all so far. By the way, your articles have been coming in and you can continue to send them. Don’t worry about the bonds, darling, they’ll catch up with us although {{it is a good idea}} to “wake” them up on the subject. At least, it shows them you are interested. Sweets, I notice you’ve got a change of stationery again—I like this new paper, too. When you mentioned donating blood at the expense of being “punctured full of holes,” it brought to mind the time we went up to the doctor to take our pre-marital health examinations. I remember all the jabbing that doctor had to do in order to get a teeny-weeny bit of blood for the test. Remember? Gee, those were heart-palpitating days when we were going to be married without really 2 ̆ 6 truly knowing whether our marriage would be a success. By the way, dear, in the event my other letters have been delayed, let me remind you that the last 2 ½ years have been the happiest moments of my life and I expect to be on hand to plant kisses on your lips when you become a grandma so you’ll just have to get accustomed to being with me for a long long time. Sweetheart, you remember, don’t you, that my cable address is AMMODY, that is the only address you use, no APO, etc. Doc received a cablegram here in as little as 6 days, not bad, eh? (Birthday Greeting) That lecture by Dr. Edman must have been excellent. Golly, if only nations wake up to the fact that only through international relations and understanding can peace be maintained. Eadie, honey, it may be a good thing that I came over here when I did since it may cut down the time of service I may have to spend in Europe. Doc Luddecke 2 ̆ 6 myself are planning to learn the Russian language, if we can get the necessary texts, etc. It will be fun trying anyway. I’ve been pretty lucky with the “piss pot” and have had to empty it but 2 times in the past 9 tries—of course I may run into a string of bad luck. Enclosed you will find a clipping from Stars and Stripes with a clever caption, but with sinister implications. “Nazi Diaper Sniper aged 11 is captured. ” Does this bring to mind any of the problems presented in “Tomorrow the World?” I sent you some items of German propoganda [sic], etc., which you should like to keep in our library. Did you get them yet? Honey girl, I love you deleriously [sic] and am “sweating out” the day when we shall launch <b>our</b> second <b>honeymoon.</b> Goodnight dearest Vic [Transcription ends...|$|R
6000|$|... "How {{would you}} like to spend <b>our</b> <b>honeymoon?</b> In a yacht in the Mediterranean? I think that would do. There is nothing like {{solitude}} in a wretched little boat to promote mutual understanding. If your devotion could stand the strain of a dishevelled and seasick spouse, our matrimonial future has no terrors for your loving Mary." ...|$|E
60|$|In truth {{no blood}} {{relations}} {{could have been}} more sympathetic, more generous, more considerate than the Ehrichs. They rejoiced in us. Skilled and happy hosts, they did their utmost to make <b>our</b> <b>honeymoon</b> an unforgettable experience. Each hour of our stay was arranged with kindness. We drove, we ate, we listened to music, with a grateful wonder at our good fortune.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps I haven't {{the right}} to complain," [...] she acknowledged. [...] "I have gone my own way always. But if one is {{permitted}} {{to look for a}} moment into the past, can you tell me a single hour when work was not the prominent thought in your brain, the idol before which you worshipped? Why, even <b>our</b> <b>honeymoon</b> was spent canvassing!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well, then, I'll {{leave the}} room {{the next time he}} comes. That will be {{perfectly}} simple; and it will be perfectly simple to do as most other people would--not concern myself with the play in any way from this out. I dare say you would prefer that, too, though I didn't quite expect it to come to that before <b>our</b> <b>honeymoon</b> was out." ...|$|E
60|$|KATHERINE. Do you {{remember}} that day on <b>our</b> <b>honeymoon,</b> going up Ben Lawers? You were lying on your face in the heather; {{you said it was}} like kissing a loved woman. There was a lark singing--you said that was the voice of one's worship. The hills were very blue; that's why we had blue here, because it was the best dress of our country. You do love her.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{life were}} to stop short just now {{it would still}} have been richly worth while, {{just for the sake}} of these past four weeks, wouldn't it?" [...] said Anne. [...] "I don't suppose we will ever have four such perfect weeks again--but we've HAD them. Everything--wind, weather, folks, house of dreams--has conspired to make <b>our</b> <b>honeymoon</b> delightful. There hasn't even been a rainy day since we came here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{wanted to}} {{surprise}} you. We {{thought we were}} coming directly home, at first, but the dear old gentleman, {{as soon as we}} were married, found he couldn't be ready under a month, at least, and sent us off to spend <b>our</b> <b>honeymoon</b> wherever we liked. Amy had once called Valrosa a regular honeymoon home, so we went there, and were as happy as people are but once in their lives. My faith! Wasn't it love among the roses!" ...|$|E
