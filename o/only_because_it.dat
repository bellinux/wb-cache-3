5|$|The Circles of Sustainability {{assessment}} of Delhi gives a marginally more favourable {{impression of the}} ecological sustainability of the city <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> {{is based on a}} more comprehensive series of measures than only air pollution. Part of the reason that the city remains assessed at basic sustainability is because of the low resource-use and carbon emissions of its poorer neighbourhoods.|$|E
5|$|A {{large amount}} of lakes and rivers {{are found in the}} Eurasian Economic Union. Major lakes include Ladoga and Onega, two of the largest lakes in Europe. The largest and most {{prominent}} of the union's bodies of fresh water is Lake Baikal, the world's deepest, purest, oldest and most capacious fresh water lake. The Baikal lake alone contains over one-fifth of the world's fresh surface water. Russia is second only to Brazil in volume of the total renewable water resources. Of the union's numerous rivers, the Volga is the most famous, not <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> is the longest in Europe, but also because of its major role in history. In Siberia the Ob, Yenisey, Lena and Amur are among the longest rivers in the world.|$|E
5|$|HIAG {{embraced the}} Suchdienst activities, not <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> was {{concerned}} for {{the fate of}} some 40,000 members of the Waffen-SS who were missing in action, but because this outwardly humanitarian and non-political activity could help improve its perception by the West German government and the society at large. Such public relations activities ("image polishing", according to Large) were important to HIAG as it faced on-going scrutiny, and even calls for {{a ban on the}} organisation. The Suchdiensttreffen events (literally: tracing service meetings) later evolved into annual Kameradschaftstreffen ("veterans' reunions"), which were large-scale conventions, often accompanied by rallies.|$|E

5|$|In {{analyzing}} {{the creation of}} the Polish Legions, many historians have argued that Napoleon used the Poles as a source of recruits and had little desire to invest in the re-creation of the Polish state. Among the most notable of Napoleon's contemporary Polish detractors was Kościuszko, who refused to join the Legions, arguing that Napoleon would not restore Poland in any durable form. In this regard, Kościuszko also stated that the Duchy of Warsaw was created in 1807 <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> was expedient, rather than because Napoleon supported Polish sovereignty. Nevertheless, the memory of Napoleon's Polish Legions is strong in Poland, and Napoleon himself is often regarded as a hero and liberator there. About the Polish Legion, Napoleon himself is reputed to have said that 800 Poles would equal 8,000 enemy soldiers.|$|E
5|$|On 7 April The Guardian {{published}} the American banker's video, and {{later that evening}} handed it to an IPCC investigator and a City of London police officer who arrived at the newspaper's offices. The officers asked that the video {{be removed from the}} website, arguing that it jeopardized their inquiry and was not helpful to the family. Nick Hardwick, chair of the IPCC, said the IPCC had asked The Guardian to remove the video <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> would have been better had witnesses not seen it before being questioned.|$|E
5|$|The {{arrival of}} more modern {{submarines}} to blockade the Dardanelles made the B-class boats redundant {{and they were}} mostly withdrawn to Malta in 1915. They were transferred to Venice after Italy entered the war, where B10 became the first submarine to be sunk by air attack in 1916. The B-class submarines were transferred back to Malta in late 1916 as {{they were no longer}} deemed suitable for combat. In mid-1917 they were converted to surface patrol boats and sent to patrol the Otranto Barrage. They proved to be unreliable and were soon sent back to Malta where they were finally paid off. Only B3 was still in commission when the war ended and that was <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> was being used for experimental work and serving as a target to train anti-submarine forces. All surviving boats were sold for scrap in 1919–21.|$|E

5|$|The {{equatorial}} ring {{goes around}} {{the belly of the}} armillary sphere 91 and 5/19 (degrees) away from the pole. The circle of the ecliptic also goes round the belly of the instrument at an angle of 24 (degrees) with the equator. Thus at the summer solstice the ecliptic is 67 (degrees) and a fraction away from the pole, while at the winter solstice it is 115 (degrees) and a fraction away. Hence (the points) where the ecliptic and the equator intersect should give the north polar distances of the spring and autumn equinoxes. But now (it has been recorded that) the spring equinox is 90 and 1/4 (degrees) away from the pole, and the autumn equinox is 92 and 1/4 (degrees) away. The former figure is adopted <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> agrees with the (results obtained by the) method of measuring solstitial sun shadows as embodied in the Xia (dynasty) calendar.|$|E

50|$|Blue Bowls is {{the surf}} spot on Vaadhoo. It is a {{favorite}} stop for boat charters in the Maldives, not <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>it’s</b> a long and smooth righthander, but also because anchoring there means an opportunity to meet the local population and spend time in the local village—one of the great advantages to having amazing waves in a truly unique location.|$|R
50|$|The style I {{developed}} for The Cold Six Thousand is a direct, shorter-rather-than-longer sentence style that's declarative and ugly and right there, punching {{you in the}} nards. It was appropriate for that book, and that book <b>only,</b> <b>because</b> <b>it's</b> the 1960s. It's largely the story of reactionaries in America during that time, largely a novel of racism and thus the racial invective, and the overall bluntness and ugliness of the language.|$|R
50|$|Trolleys {{arriving}} at this station travel between 69th Street Terminal in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania and Sharon Hill, Pennsylvania. The station has a shed with a roof {{where people can}} go inside when it is raining. Baltimore Pike is a major stop, not <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>it's</b> a commercial strip with a SEPTA bus connection, but because the street itself is also a former state highway that connects U.S. 1 and U.S. 13.|$|R
25|$|Amazonian {{colonization}} {{was dominated}} by cattle raising, not <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> was possible to grow grass in the poor soil, but also because ranching required little labor, generated decent profits, and awarded social status in the community. However, the results of farming have led to extensive deforestation and have caused extensive environmental damage.|$|E
25|$|Tens of {{millions}} of people live in the floodplain of the Yangtze valley, an area that naturally floods every summer and is habitable <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> is protected by river dikes. The floods large enough to overflow the dikes have caused great distress to those who live and farm there.|$|E

District XXII is still on the same route in southwest Buda, and finally District XXIII is again in southernmost Pest, irregular <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> was part of District XX until 1994.|$|E

Prathap (Mohan) and his friend Sri (Charle) are petty thieves. One day, Vidya (Divya) {{falls in love with}} Prathap. Vidya's brother Subash (Kitty) cherished her. When he knows about her love affair, he doesn't hesitate to kill her <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>it's</b> against the terrorist group's rules.|$|R
25|$|In short, {{oxy-fuel}} {{equipment is}} quite versatile, not <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> is preferred for some sorts of iron or steel welding {{but also because}} it lends itself to brazing, braze-welding, metal heating (for annealing or tempering, bending or forming), rust or scale removal, the loosening of corroded nuts and bolts, and is a ubiquitous means of cutting ferrous metals.|$|E
25|$|The synagogue {{complex is}} unusual not <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> escaped {{destruction}} by the Nazi occupiers of Poland, {{and because the}} entire suite of Jewish communal buildings is intact, but also because, unlike many other former synagogues in Poland that were destroyed, left to decay, or turned to other uses in the Communist era, it was meticulously restored.|$|E
25|$|The Detroit Bank and Trust Tower is a steel-frame 28-story tower {{designed}} in 1963 by Harley, Ellington, Cowan, and Stirton for Detroit Bank and Trust (now Comerica Bank). The pre-cast concrete forms filled with glass give the building a grid-like appearance. This building does {{not contribute to}} the district, but <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> is less than 50years old.|$|E

BONZIE feels a lot better to go under, not <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>it's</b> a pseudonym, but also <b>because</b> <b>it</b> doesn't subscribe to a language.

He mentioned that he was looking forward to next year with anticipation, and not <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> would be the 30th anniversary of his first album release.|$|E
25|$|Unbeaten Scotland became {{outright}} British champions for {{the first}} time in four years. Following a draw in Cardiff and victory at home to Northern Ireland, Scotland travelled to Wembley needing to beat England, who had won both their matches, to take the title. This was secured with a 3–2 win which has become legendary in Scottish football, not <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> was England's first defeat since becoming world champions the previous year, but due to Scotland's assured performance and the skillful arrogance of Jim Baxter, who at various times juggled the ball by himself.|$|E
