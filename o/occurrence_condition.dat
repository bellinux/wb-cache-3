Arcs on solar array can short-circuit the satellite circuit, decrease the satellite power, and then cause the satellite permanent failure.

We measured the arc plasma temperature and identified the materials emitted using spectrometer at arbitrary time during arc occurring. We investigated the difference of secondary arcs <b>occurrence</b> <b>condition</b> during secondary arcs.

In case of primary arc (PA) dimension changes, the probability of secondary arc and TSA occurrence became high. And plasma temperature was not affected by PA dimension, however the metallic vapor emission of silver was greatly affected. Thus, secondary arc occurrence greatly depends on metallic vapor emission from cathode.

It is very important to clarify the <b>occurrence</b> <b>condition</b> and possibility of the base-triggered vapor explosion from the viewpoints of the prediction and the prevention of the vapor explosion. In order to evaluate the occurrence conditions and to clarify the micro-mechanism of the base-triggered vapor explosion, the experimental apparatus to observe the base-triggered vapor explosion from the bottom of the floor to above is designed and constructed. The experiments using U-Alloy 95 as a simulant material are conducted. Consequently, the microscopic behavior at the interface between the molten material and water can be observed in detail with this experimental apparatus. The interfacial behavior of the molten material is quantitatively evaluated by the PIV analysis and the digital auto-colrrelation method with the experimental results. The blowout velocity of the molten material at vapor explosion is evaluated from the visual data obtained on the experiment.

Besides the well-known rupture styles of subshear (or sub-Rayleigh) and supershear, we defined a new kind of rupture style in this study, termed the ‘self-arresting rupture’, for which the rupture process can be autonomously arrested by itself without any outside interference (e. g. a high strength barrier).

The rupture phase diagram clearly illustrates the <b>occurrence</b> <b>conditions</b> of three kinds of rupture styles and the transitions between them.

The numerical simulations show that the initial impact velocity, equivalent elasticity modulus, contact curvature radius of the sphere, and equivalent mass have great influence on the contact–impact time of the sub-impact, and an applicable range of the theoretical expression of contact–impact time of the sub-impact was determined.

With the OPAL opacity {{we find that the}} optically thick wind occurs for >~ 0. 6 Mo WDs and that the occurrence of winds depends not only on the WD mass but also on the ignition mass. When the ignition mass is larger than a critical value, winds are suppressed by a density-inversion layer. Such a static solution can be realized in WDs of mass ~ 0. 6 - 0. 7 Mo. We propose that sequences consisting only of static solutions correspond to slow evolutions in symbiotic novae like PU Vul because PU Vul shows no indication of strong winds in a long-lasted flat peak followed by a very slow decline in its light curve.

A simplified formula for determining the critical heat release rate for flashover is also suggested. The wall construction material has little influence on flashover occurrence. For the boundary of flashover in fuel-controlled fires, as the temperature factor becomes larger, the fuel surface area which causes the flashover occurrence becomes smaller. For ventilation controlled fires, critical fuel surface area per unit internal surface area of room corresponds with temperature factor. As the flashover time is smaller, the critical heat release rate for flashover is increased.

30|$|Researchers {{around the}} world have {{developed}} a lot of studies and proposed a variety of hypotheses on the dynamic disaster mechanism of coal-rock mass according to tests and theoretical analysis, such as energy theory (Cook 1965), stiffness theory (Petukhov and Linko 1979), strength theory (Li 1985), rockburst tendency theory (Kidybiński 1981), three-criteria theory, system deformation instability theory (Zhang 1987), etc. These hypotheses indicate the <b>occurrence</b> <b>condition</b> and mechanism of rockburst from different aspects. However, each theory has its own characteristics and limitations. Especially in recent years, serious rockburst also happened in some coal seams without rockburst tendency or with low original stresses and shallow-burying. For example, the rockburst in Kuangou Coal Mine in China in October 8, 2010 (at mining depth of 317  m) resulted in many casualties. In addition, experimental study (Singh 1988) also signified that the mechanical parameters of coal/rock was greatly influenced by the loading rate. During dynamic load tests, soft coal showed a great strength improvement and a similar dynamic failure mode with hard coal. Analysis (Gu et al. 2012) on causes for the rockburst in field implied that most of the rockbursts were related to the dynamic disturbances induced by mining or blasting.|$|E
40|$|Debris flow has {{the larger}} {{destructive}} force and brings about the more catastrophic disaster dueto its distinctive accumulation of large boulders to the flow front. The observed facts about sizesegregation were explained {{with the data}} on debris flows at Mt. Yakedake, Japan.

40|$|I {{will explain}} why most novae show a sharp optical {{peak in the}} light curve, whereas {{a small number of}} novae, such as PU Vul, shows a long-lasted flat optical maximum. Re-examination of <b>occurrence</b> <b>condition</b> of {{optically}} thick winds clarifies that hydrostatic evolutions, in which optically thick winds are suppressed, are realized during nova outbursts on low mass white dwarfs (WDs) (less than about 0. 7 Mo). In such a case, a nova outburst evolves very slowly, because of no strong mass-ejection, and stays at low temperature stage a long time, which results in a long-lasted flat optical peak. This explains outburst nature of symbiotic nova PU Vul, that shows flat optical maximum lasted as long as eight years with no spectral indication of wind mass-loss. On the other hand, in ordinary nova outbursts, strong optically thick winds inevitably occur that carry out most of the envelope matter very quickly. Thus the light curve decays immediately after the optical peak, which results in a sharp peak of optical light curve.
