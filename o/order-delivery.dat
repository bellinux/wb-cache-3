40|$|The {{volatility}} {{displayed by}} floating exchange rates has revived {{interest in the}} relationship between exchange rates and traded goods prices. This paper aims to provide a theory of exchange rates and traded goods prices in the short-run. In particular, it examines how various factors can cause exchange rate pass-through to be incomplete in the short-run but not in the long-run. These include: (i) menu costs, (ii) the costs of changing supply, (iii) the dynamics of demand response to price changes, (iv) <b>order-delivery</b> lags, (v) forward exchange cover, and (vi) the currency denomination of trade contracts. From a policy perspective, the presence of these factors could account for the often prolonged adjustment of trade balances to exchange rate changes, and the failure of exchange rate volatility to perceptibly affect the volume of international trade flows. ...|$|E
40|$|For auto makers, it is {{important}} to be able to establish global supply chain management systems. In particular, rethinking of logistics and lead-time improvements are essential. Toyota Automobiles places stress on overseas global development, but in practice, there are large differences of awareness among countries. This study aims to discuss the company's approach to logistics focusing on lead-time. A global distribution management system, so called COSMOS, developed from 2002 on, using a network of new computer systems to locate vehicles from their exit from the assembly line to their arrival at dealers worldwide now ensures excellent traceability. Further, the paper also discusses two case studies concerning effective logistics improvement (Kaizen) factors for lead-time reduction. international logistics; innovation; Asian vehicle; IMV; kaizen; hub and spoke distribution; global <b>order-delivery</b> system; global supply chain management; lead time reduction; global distribution management; vehicle location; continuous improvement; traceability; Toyota; supply chain performance...|$|E
40|$|In a multi-item {{inventory}} system, {{such as an}} assemble-to-order manufacturing {{system or}} an online-retailing system, a customer order typically consists of several different items in different amounts. The average order-based backorders are {{the average number of}} customer orders that are not yet completely filled. While this is an important measure of customer satisfaction, it has not been widely studied in the operations management literature. This is largely because its evaluation involves the joint distribution of inventory levels of different items and other intricate relations, which is computationally dreadful. Taking a novel approach, this paper develops a tractable way of evaluating this measure exactly. We also develop easy-to-compute bounds, which require the evaluation of item-based backorders only. Numerical experiments indicate that the average of the lower and upper bounds is very effective. The exact results show surprisingly simple structures, which shed light on how system parameters affect the performance. Using these results, we study several examples to gain managerial insights. Questions addressed include: What are the implications of item-based inventory planning decisions on the order-based performance? What is the impact of introducing common components on inventory and service trade-offs? Would <b>order-delivery</b> performance be improved if we restrict the number of choices in product configurations?Multi-Item Systems, Backorders, Demand Correlation, Performance Evaluation, Approximation, Assemble-to-Order, Component Commonality, Product Structure...|$|E
40|$|Widespread {{increase}} in product variety and the simultaneous emphasis on shorter <b>order-delivery</b> times, and lower costs, is forcing manufacturing firms to consider alternatives to both make-to-stock and make-to-order modes of production. One such alternative is delayed product differentiation. It is a hybrid strategy that reconciles {{the needs of}} high variety and quick response. A common product platform is built to stock and then differentiated into different products once demand is known. In this paper, we examine {{the costs and benefits}} of delayed differentiation in environments where capacity is finite, and order lead-times are stochastic and load-dependent. We show that the advantage of delayed differentiation is affected by factors such as capacity utilization, product variety, and order delay requirement. In particular, the desirability of delayed differentiation is found to be sensitive to the utilization of the production system; its benefits diminishing with increasing utilization. In situations where order-delay requirements are tight, we show that delaying differentiation can be more expensive than producing in a make-to-stock fashion. However, when utilization is in the mid-range, the benefits of delayed differentiation can be significant. As intuition suggests, the benefits of delayed differentiation are also significant when product variety is high. In fact, the marginal benefit from delayed differentiation is, by and large, increasing in the number of products. If the point of differentiation can be affected, we find that, where feasible, differentiating early by postponing more work content until demand is realized is desirable, leading ultimately to a make-to-order system. If the cheaper early differentiation is not possible due to tight delivery requirements, we show that we should assign proportionally more capacity to the make-to-order stage...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} how the Design Structure Matrix (DSM) tool {{could be used}} in managing an enterprise’s information systems portfolio. The goal is related to a larger concept called Enterprise Architecture (EA), which seeks to better link together the business and the information systems in use. However, EA frameworks and previous literary works are often quite abstract in nature, offering guidelines on what data to collect but not {{what to do with the}} data. Thus, a practical method of analysis was needed. The research was carried out as a single case study. At the case company, the primary goal for EA development was to increase the system’s flexibility to change. The focus was on applications linked to the company’s <b>order-delivery</b> process. The company wanted to allow each site freedom in choosing information systems for each phase of the process, but simultaneously ensure interoperability between sites. What was desired from this thesis was a way of generating development proposals for this type of architecture development, which could then be further refined. Based on the case company’s vision and a literature review, two distinct avenues were identified for developing the architecture. The communications could be organized so that information flows from module to module, or by defining a bus to move data between modules. The practical part of this thesis examines ways of generating these suggestions and visualizing them using the DSM. In addition, automatic clustering of the DSM was examined; this was seen as a way of generating clustering schemes alternative to those based on the process phases. The main theoretical contribution of the study is a method for analysing data collected as part of EA work, created through combining theory on both information systems and the DSM. As a practical contribution, a concrete tool was developed during the study to facilitate the creation and analysis of the architectural suggestions...|$|E
40|$|A main {{challenge}} for supply chains concerns {{how to handle}} the demand planning and inventory management in the <b>order-delivery</b> process. Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) is a concept that has been applied in order to meet this challenge. In VMI, the responsibility of the replenishment decision is transferred to the supplier and the buying firm shares the required inventory and demand data. The main benefits highlighted in previous research are improved service levels, reduced inventory levels and reduced administration for the customer. However, studies have shown that by applying VMI, all benefits will not by itself be realised. The study object of this report is a manufacturer that operates several VMI setups. The manufacturer has experienced mixed effects from the application. Many studies have been performed on the subject of VMI but there are not many guidelines of the prerequisites for successful VMI application. Therefore, the aim {{of this study is to}} develop a supporting framework for deciding the suitability of VMI as a replenishment method at a manufacturing company. In order to fulfil the aim, a VMI suitability framework was constructed based on theoretical findings. The applicability of the framework was further evaluated and improved through a case study at the manufacturer and one of its VMI suppliers. The empirical data consists of qualitative data, mainly collected through semi-structured interviews. Recommendations regarding VMI application in general at the case company were formulated together with guidelines of how to apply the VMI suitability framework at the case company. Firstly, it was found that there are two types of VMI available, which have different effects and also put different requirements on the actors. Secondly, it was found that the type of VMI is dependent on the configuration of VMI at the supplier’s site. Thirdly, the risk in a VMI arrangement consists of performance risk and relational risk. It was found that the suitability of VMI depends on the risk that the parties are willing to take and the type of VMI that is considered...|$|E
40|$|Several {{companies}} in the Finnish manufacturing industry produce partly configurable products that include one-of-a-kind components. One-of-a-kind components cause challenges within companies, as opposed to fully configurable products, which include only standard and configurable components. Identifying and managing these challenges is hard, as the subject of product structure affecting the product’s life-cycle such as <b>order-delivery</b> process is complex and requires a holistic approach. This research aims to provide a description of differences of characteristics and behaviour between partly configurable product structures and fully configurable product structures, in a chosen scope of product life-cycle phases. This is done by developing a conceptual framework, Product Life-cycle Disposition Model (PLDM), which is an explanatory model to describe dispositions and how to manage {{them in order to}} achieve a company’s targets. The research applies Design Research methodology in the research process. The initial version of the model is constructed based on the literature review, theory basis and state of the art around Design Science and Systems Engineering. The explanatory model is demonstrated and further developed in a case study with a company from the Finnish manufacturing industry. In the case study, the current company’s partly configurable product and its captured relevant dispositions are compared to a scenario of fully configurable product. From the overall analysis of the dispositions results and recommendations are drawn. The case study indicates that the PLDM framework resembles the real world situation in business and the challenge the manufacturing industry currently faces in Finland. Partly configurable product structures are {{a good example of the}} effect the product structure has to the overall product life-cycle. The results of the case study examining the company's product indicated that the order-specific product structures caused invalidity of the information in three chosen phases of the product's life-cycle. The results also represented recommendations for actions to solve the problems following the PLDM framework. The recommended actions were directed to changing the product’s life-cycle’s characteristics. This research concludes the PLDM is comprehensive in relation to the chosen theories and state of the art in Design Science and Systems Engineering. It contributes to the Design Science by providing a cyclic model to develop the product’s characteristics and product’s life-cycle system towards its requirements and targets, derived from product’s life-cycle. The novelty of the PLDM is that it uses a Flow model to depict the information, work, material and control flows in the life-cycle process. The PLDM provides a conceptual framework for the manufacturing industry to develop their integrated product and process systems. The PLDM is seen as part of a broader research area, which aims to introduce a supportive tool for consultation purposes...|$|E
