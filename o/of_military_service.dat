5|$|As the 11th New York Regiment had {{experienced}} first hand, the First Battle of Bull Run in July 1861 {{had taken a}} heavy toll on Union forces, including those from New York City. As the war dragged on, a military manpower shortage occurred in the Union and Congress passed the first conscription act in United States history on March 3, 1863, authorizing the President to draft male citizens {{between the ages of}} 18 and 35 for a three-year term <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>service.</b>|$|E

Men of eighteen to forty years of age were to be conscripted for two years.

5|$|While {{technically}} minded shortwave listening hobbyists dwindled {{during the}} war years {{due in part to the}} demands <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>service,</b> casual listeners seeking war news from foreign broadcasters increased.
