25|$|A Schrader valve {{consists}} of a hollow cylindrical metal tube, typically brass, with the exterior end threaded. The interior end takes {{a variety of forms}} depending on its application. In the center of the exterior end is a metal pin pointing along the axis of the tube; the pin's end is flush with the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> <b>body.</b> Generally, all Schrader valves are used on tires. They have threads and bodies of a single standard size at the exterior end, so caps and tools generally are universal for the valves on all automobile and bicycle pneumatic tires. Also, pressure valves can be used on Schrader valves in place of caps in order to measure the pressure of pneumatic tires. In 1891, George Schrader, the son of German-American immigrant August Schrader, invented the Schrader valve. A patent was issued on April 11, 1893.|$|E

High-precision, safe and efficient gate valve is a challenge for pipeline transportation.

50|$|The {{multitude}} of parts, {{along with the}} complex design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> <b>body,</b> originally made hydraulic automatic transmissions much more complicated (and expensive) to build and repair than manual transmissions.

Mass manufacturing and decades of improvement have reduced this cost gap.|$|E
50|$|A bonnet {{acts as a}} {{cover on}} the valve body. It is {{commonly}} semi-permanently screwed into the valve body or bolted onto it. During manufacture of the valve, the internal parts are put into the body and then the bonnet is attached to hold everything together inside. To access internal parts of a valve, a user would take off the bonnet, usually for maintenance. Many valves do not have bonnets; for example, plug valves usually do not have bonnets. Many ball valves do not have bonnets since the valve body is put together in a different style, such as being screwed together at the middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> <b>body.</b>|$|E
50|$|The air {{pressure}} in an inflated tire holds the inner valve body shut. A small screw and captive nut {{on the top}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> <b>body</b> permits the valve to be screwed shut and ensure that it remains tightly closed. The nut must be unscrewed to permit airflow in either direction. This must be done before attaching a pump. The screw remains captive on the valve body even when unscrewed fully; it is tightened again after the tire is inflated and the pump removed. The valve cap protects the valve body, keeps dirt and mud out of the mechanism, and also prevents the valve from damaging the tube when it is rolled for storage, but {{is not necessary to}} prevent pressure loss.|$|E

40|$|It is {{advantageous}} for gas-fed pulsed electric thrusters {{to employ}} pulsed valves so propellant is only flowing to the device during operation. <b>The</b> propellant utilization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thruster will be maximized {{when all the}} gas injected into the thruster is acted upon by the fields produced by the electrical pulse. Gas that is injected too early will diffuse away from the thruster before the electrical pulse can act to accelerate the propellant. Gas that is injected too late will miss being accelerated by the already-completed electrical pulse. As a consequence, <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> must open quickly and close equally quickly, only remaining open for a short duration. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> must have {{only a small amount}} <b>of</b> volume between <b>the</b> sealing body and the thruster so the front and back ends <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pulse are as coincident as possible with <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> cycling, with very little latent propellant remaining in the feed lines after <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> is closed. For a real mission of interest, a pulsed thruster can be expected to pulse at least 10 (exp 10) - 10 (exp 11) times, setting the range for <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> times a valve must open and close. <b>The</b> <b>valves</b> described in this paper have been fabricated and tested for operation in an inductive pulsed plasma thruster (IPPT) for in-space propulsion. In general, an IPPT is an electrodeless space propulsion device where a capacitor is charged to an initial voltage and then discharged, producing a high-current pulse through a coil. The field produced by this pulse ionizes propellant, inductively driving current in a plasma located near <b>the</b> face <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coil. Once the plasma is formed, it can be accelerated and expelled at a high exhaust velocity by the electromagnetic Lorentz body force arising from <b>the</b> interaction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> induced plasma current and the magnetic field produced by the current in <b>the</b> coil. <b>The</b> <b>valve</b> characteristics needed for the IPPT application require a fast-acting valve capable of a minimum of 10 (exp 10) valve actuation cycles. Since even 10 (exp 9) cycles is well above anything demonstrated, this lower value was selected as the design point for the present work. <b>The</b> <b>valve</b> seal must remain leak-tight throughout operation, and the body must maintain a low internal leakage at relatively high operating temperatures. <b>The</b> full set <b>of</b> design requirements used for this program are summarized in Table 1. In this work, we describe two pulsed gas valves that have been fabricated to have long lifetime and demonstrate the characteristics listed above. The first is a miniaturized, conventional electromagnet-based <b>valve</b> while <b>the</b> second is a piezoelectric-based <b>valve</b> design. <b>The</b> conventional <b>valve,</b> shown in Fig. 1, is opened by use of a solenoid electromagnetic actuator. When current is applied to the solenoid coil, magnetic forces pull the plunger away from <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> seat, allowing fluid to flow through <b>the</b> <b>valve.</b> Removal <b>of</b> electrical current permits the spring and fluid pressure to seat the plunger, halting <b>the</b> flow <b>of</b> fluid. <b>The</b> <b>valve</b> <b>body</b> is fabricated from 304 L corrosion resistant steel (CRES) and while the parts that form the magnetic circuit are fabricated from 430 CRES. This material does not have optimum magnetic properties, but its corrosion resistance permits incorporation into a design without requiring an additional plating process. A viton O-ring compound (Parker V 0884 - 75), selected for its mechanical strength at elevated temperatures, was used for <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> seat seal. <b>The</b> design was based solely on <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> analytical sizing calculations, as opposed to a more rigorous finite element analysis. While this valve is small and relatively lightweight, it does not represent a design that is optimized for mass and/or a given volume envelope. <b>The</b> piezoelectric <b>valve</b> is a "puller" valve design. Applying a voltage to the piezo crystal causes it to elongate and pull a pintle off the seat, opening <b>the</b> <b>valve.</b> <b>The</b> <b>valve</b> seal consists <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pintle with an external, spherically-formed tip fabricated from Inconel 625 and the seat fabricated from Inconel 718 and possessing a spherical surface that permits the pintle to align with <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> <b>body</b> centerline after each cycle, maintaining the circumferential metal-on-metal seal. The contact stress on <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> pintle is expected in the worst case to be 96. 5 MPa (14 ksi), which is well below the work hardening value of 413. 7 MPa (60 ksi) for Inconel 615. Results presented in this work will compare <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> each <b>valve,</b> both {{to each other and to}} <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> design requirements given in Table 1. In general, both <b>valves</b> meet all <b>the</b> performance envelope requirements, but <b>the</b> piezoelectric <b>valve</b> consumes considerably less power and has a faster response time over <b>the</b> conventional solenoid-driven <b>valves...</b>|$|R
