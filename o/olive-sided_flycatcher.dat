5|$|Many {{species of}} birds have been spotted in the Little Butte Creek region. Twenty-two species are known to breed in the {{chaparral}} region, including several species of wrens, blackbirds, and sparrows. The mixed coniferous forest is home to white-headed woodpeckers, pygmy nuthatches, green-tailed towhees, northern pygmy-owls, Vaux's swifts, winter wrens, and MacGillivray's warblers. The American coot has also been spotted in several places along the creek. Williamson's sapsuckers, black-backed woodpeckers, gray jays, and hermit warblers frequent the higher elevations.

40|$|Studies of {{song and}} its {{function}} in suboscine passerines are rare. We examined {{spatial and temporal}} variation in song structure in a wild population of <b>Olive-sided</b> <b>Flycatchers</b> (Contopus cooperi) and tested among hypotheses explaining this variation. Repeatable variation in song type was observed both within and among individuals. More than 10 % of territorial males expressed atypical song types, i. e., permutations of sequential missing and repeated elements of the typical adult song. Atypical songs were predominantly expressed by unpaired males independent of habitat type. A small fraction of males sang atypical song {{through the middle of}} the breeding season, but all males sang only stereotypical adult song {{by the end of the}} season. These results suggest the expression of atypical songs reflect protracted vocal development rather than evolution of new song types, geographic variation in song structure, or an extensive song repertoire in <b>Olive-sided</b> <b>Flycatchers...</b>|$|R

40|$|Ecological traps are {{attractive}} population sinks created when anthropogenic habitat alteration inadvertently creates a mismatch between {{the attractiveness of}} a habitat based upon its settlement cues, and its current value for survival or reproduction. Traps represent a new threat to the conservation of native species, yet {{little attention has been}} given to developing practical approaches to eliminating them. In the northern Rocky Mountains of Montana, <b>Olive-sided</b> <b>Flycatchers</b> (Contopus cooperi) prefer to settle in patches of selectively harvested forest versus burned forest despite the lower reproductive success and higher nest predation risk associated with the former habitat. I investigated characteristics of preferred perch sites for this species and how these preferences varied between habitats and sexes. I then built on previous research to develop a range of management prescriptions for reducing the attractiveness of selectively harvested forest, thereby disarming the ecological trap. Female flycatchers preferred to forage from shorter perch trees than males, and females' perches were shorter than other available perch trees. Both sexes preferred standing dead perch trees (snags) and these preferences were most obvious in harvested forest where snags are rarer. Because previous research shows that snag density is linked to habitat preference and spruce/fir trees are preferred nest substrate, my results suggest these two habitat components are focal habitat selection cues. I suggest alternative and complementary strategies for eliminating the ecological trap for <b>Olive-sided</b> <b>Flycatchers</b> including: (1) reduced retention and creation of snags, (2) avoiding selective harvest in spruce, fir, and larch stands, (3) avoiding retention of these tree species, and (4) selecting only even-aged canopy height trees for retention so as to reduce perch availability for female flycatchers. Because these strategies also have potential to negatively impact habitat suitability for other forest species or even create new ecological traps, we urge caution in the application of our management recommendations...|$|R

30|$|While {{there are}} {{winners and losers}} in the {{immediate}} aftermath of any disturbance event, the net effect of mixed-severity fire is that it provides a mosaic of habitat for a broad suite of species. For instance, songbirds have high levels of species richness and abundance in post-fire vegetation at mid elevations (Fontaine et al. 2009, Tingley et al. 2016). Black-backed woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus [Swainson, 1832]), mountain bluebirds (Sialia currucoides [Bechstein, 1798]), tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor [Vieillot, 1808]), and numerous shrub-nesting birds preferentially use recently burned forests in the Sierra Nevada and other regions, presumably due to increased shrub cover and presence of snags (Fontaine et al. 2009, DellaSala et al. 2014, Hutto et al. 2015, Tingley et al. 2016). California spotted owls (Strix occidentalis occidentalis [Xantus de Vesey, 1860]) and <b>olive-sided</b> <b>flycatchers</b> (Contopus cooperi [Nuttall, 1831]) forage in severely burned patches where prey are abundant, and nest in unburned to moderately burned portions of the same fire mosaic (Bond et al. 2009, 2016; Hutto et al. 2015; Comfort et al. 2016). Bats make use of high snag densities (Buchalski et al. 2013) and fire-recruiting plants are associated with severely burned patches (Donato et al. 2009). Even mature-forest carnivores such as the Pacific fisher (Pekania pennanti [Erxleben, 1777]) actively forage in severely burned patches (Hanson 2015).|$|R
