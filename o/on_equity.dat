25|$|The {{dominant}} {{performance measures}} change over time. A compilation of surveys examining the stated financial goals of companies over the century found the following: companies strove to maximize {{market share in}} the late 1960s; earnings per share in the mid-1970s; return <b>on</b> <b>equity</b> in the early 1980s; and cash flow and share prices in present day. Other surveys found that organizations' preferences for evaluating performance related to capital expenditures have shifted dramatically over time. For instance, in 1959, 13% of firms focused on internal rates of return while 86% of firms did so in 1988. In addition, the percentage of firms utilizing accounting measures decreased from 50% in 1959 to 12% in 1988. One potential reason that dominating performance measures change over time is that as organizations replace old measures when they discover their limitations.|$|E

25|$|The {{adoption}} of cooperatives in Gujarat is widely attributed {{to much of}} the success in the agricultural sector, particularly sugar and dairy cooperatives. Cooperative farming has been a component of India's strategy for agricultural development since 1951. Whilst the success of these was mixed throughout the country, their positive impact on the states of Maharashtra and Gujarat have been the most significant. In 1995 alone, the two states had more registered co-operatives than any other region in the country. Out of these, the agricultural cooperatives have received much attention. Many have focused on subsidies and credit to farmers and rather than collective gathering, they have focused on facilitating collective processing and marketing of produce. However, whilst they have led to increased productivity, their effect <b>on</b> <b>equity</b> in the region has been questioned, because membership in agricultural co-operatives has tended to favour landowners whilst limiting the entry of landless agricultural labourers. An example of co-operative success in Gujarat can be illustrated through dairy co-operatives, with the particular example of Amul (Anand Milk Union Limited).|$|E
25|$|Individuals and {{organizations}} have designed numerous ways to measure performance {{and continue to}} do so at an increasing rate. Evidence for this observation can be found by tracking changes in performance measures over time. In the 19th century, companies measured their performance via industry-specific output and cost measures, such as newspaper circulation. By the 1920s, companies also began utilizing accounting-based returns measures, such as return on investment. And the 1960s and 1970s saw the emergence of purely financial measures of performance relating information on dividends and return <b>on</b> <b>equity.</b> This dependence on performance measures has not diminished in recent years – on the contrary, the number of metrics that exist is growing at an even more accelerated rate. Today, in addition to financial measures, organizations examine nonfinancial metrics regarding leadership, information, planning, human resource utilization, and customer satisfaction. This proliferation in performance measurements has led to corresponding growth in the performance measurement industry – there has been a notable {{increase in the number of}} personnel {{and organizations}} devoted to examining performance-related metrics, such as certified public accountants and financial analysts.|$|E
25|$|School of Education (Concurrent Education, English) In September 2003, Laurentian began {{offering}} an English bachelor of education. This concurrent B.Ed. is a four or five-year program taken {{along with an}} undergraduate degree. The primary goal of the English-language bachelor of education program is to foster {{the development of a}} new generation of reflective educators who employ holistic teaching approaches. The curriculum features an emphasis <b>on</b> <b>equity</b> and diversity as well as the infusion of aboriginal issues and content. At the moment, the program is offered in just two of the three areas of potential concentration: the primary/junior and junior/intermediate divisions. A new school of education building - based on sustainable environmental principles and located across from L'École des sciences at the east end of the campus – was completed in the summer of 2008. The program requires a 75% average over one's first four years (weighted 12.5/12.5/37.5/37.5) in order to progress to the final (or Pro Year). The 75% minimum average required for entry in the final year means a nearly 80% entering grade in reality, so the annual Pro Year class (ranging from about 65 to 95 students) constitutes a rather elite cohort compared to most other Ontario concurrent programs. Many graduates have gone on to employment with both the local Sudbury boards, with other school boards across Ontario, while many others have acquired employment in Alberta, B.C., and Saskatchewan, with a significant number working overseas (particularly in Britain).|$|E
