Diệm was taken in a seven-car motorcade to St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City, where Bishop Joseph Flannelly delayed the mass to await the South Vietnamese president. After leading Diệm {{to a point of}} honor in the cathedral's sanctuary, Bishop Flannelly said [...] "We are delighted and we are proud to have... His Excellency Ngô Đình Diệm.

500|$|One black {{motorist}} {{observed in}} the early 1940s that while black travelers felt free in the mornings, by the early afternoon a [...] "small cloud" [...] had appeared. By the late afternoon, [...] "it casts a shadow of apprehension on <b>our</b> <b>hearts</b> <b>and</b> sours us a little. 'Where,' it asks us, 'will you stay tonight?'". They often had to spend hours in the evening trying to find somewhere to stay, sometimes resorting to sleeping in haylofts or in their own cars if they could not find anywhere. One alternative, if it was available, was to arrange in advance to sleep at the homes of black friends in towns or cities along their route. However, this meant detours and an abandonment of the spontaneity that for many was a key attraction of motoring.|$|E
500|$|As war clouds cast {{an ominous}} shadow over Europe {{in the late}} 1930s amidst the rise of fascism, West, Goodman, and other BSA leaders {{considered}} how Scouting might better train youth in democratic principles of government. Referring to the Nazi Kristallnacht rampage against Jews in 1938, Goodman wrote shortly afterwards: [...] "...the program of persecution has stirred up <b>our</b> <b>hearts</b> <b>and</b> minds as nothing else that has happened before has done. It has furnished the impetus of a wave of resentment against the evil; but more than that, for a surge of satisfaction and thanksgiving concerning our own happier state under a democracy." [...] During World War II, various BSA programs were developed under his leadership {{in support of the}} nation's war effort, such as the collection of scrap aluminum, tires, and waste paper for recycling into war material, distribution of war bond and air raid posters, assisting Civil Defense officials, and planting of fruit and vegetable [...] "victory gardens".|$|E

Leto described the film as [...] "a really special, DIY project." [...] He explained, [...] "We all shared a part of our lives that we've never shared on-screen before, a very intimate and personal part of our lives.

It's just one of those records. It feels really good, and when you listen to it, it makes you feel good inside. It's as simple as that.

This leads to the end of the first part wherein a video introduction called [...] "The Brain" [...] starts with Gaga appearing again as Candy Warhol and brushing her hair. After the video ends, Gaga appears on the stage in a black and white leotard with high-pointed [...] "puff" [...] shoulders and lightning shaped symbols, while riding on a similarly colored vespa.

500|$|Final Fantasy VI {{is often}} {{regarded}} as one of the best titles in the series and one of the best role-playing video games ever created. In 2005, IGN placed Final Fantasy VI 56th on their list of the 100 greatest games, as the second highest ranked Final Fantasy title on the list after Final Fantasy IV. In 2006, Nintendo Power ranked it as the 13th top 200 game on any Nintendo platform, suggesting that it might be the best Final Fantasy ever. That same year, readers of the Japanese magazine Famitsu voted it as the 25th best game of all time. In 2008, Final Fantasy VI took the #1 spot on G4 TV's [...] "Top Must Own RPGs" [...] list. That same year, ScrewAttack named Final Fantasy VI the third best SNES game, beaten only by [...] and Super Metroid. In 2009, Final Fantasy VI was inducted into the IGN Videogame Hall of Fame, becoming the second Final Fantasy game to do so (the only other Final Fantasy to do so was the original Final Fantasy). In 2012, also IGN put Final Fantasy VI as number one on their list of the top role-playing video games, stating: [...] "There are too many moments in Final Fantasy VI worthy of celebration to name them all. Biggs and Wedge leading Terra through the snow. The poisoning of Doma. Sandy boots. The destruction of the world. A tragic opera. Ultros! We hold these close to <b>our</b> <b>hearts,</b> <b>and</b> that's not even including Espers and the most poignant character themes in the series to date. So cheers, Final Fantasy VI. May your name follow us as we all tumble towards the future of art, entertainment, narrative, and everything that keeps us gaming." [...] In an updated version of the [...] "Top 100" [...] list in 2007, IGN ranked Final Fantasy VI as the ninth top game of all time, above all other Final Fantasy games in the series. They continued to cite the game's character development, and especially noted Kefka as [...] "one of the most memorable bad guys in RPG history." [...] In 2009, Game Informer put the SNES version of Final Fantasy III eighth on their list of the top games of all time, opining that it [...] "perfected the 2D role-playing game." [...] It fell from its seventh-place ranking the staff gave it in 2001. In 2012, the staff of GamesRadar ranked it as the ninth best SNES game, stating that [...] "for it to remain so effective and so moving for so long after its 1994 release means it is a true work of art, and demands to sit high atop any list, regardless of platform (we did already name it the 14th best game of all time)." [...] In 2017, the staff of IGN ranked it as the second best RPG game of all time, stating that [...] "This willingness to explore heavy themes and unthinkable outcomes — made all the more poignant when set against dramatic set pieces and a soaring score — is one of the biggest reasons why Squaresoft’s 1994 magnum opus is so very special." ...|$|E

Instead of conveying linguistic content and pointing to something outside itself, scat music—like instrumental music—is self-referential and [...] "d what it mean".
