Fermentation of the non-colored {{grape pulp}} {{produces}} <b>white</b> <b>wine.</b> The grapes from <b>which</b> <b>white</b> <b>wine</b> is produced are typically green or yellow. Some varieties are well-known, {{such as the}} Chardonnay, Sauvignon, and Riesling. Other <b>white</b> <b>wines</b> are blended from multiple varieties; Tokay, Sherry, and Sauternes are examples of these. Dark-skinned grapes {{may be used to}} produce <b>white</b> <b>wine</b> if the wine-maker is careful not to let the skin stain the wort during the separation of the pulp-juice. Pinot noir, for example, is commonly used to produce champagne.|$|R
