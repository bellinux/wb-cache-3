Business accounts (which cost £99 annually ex VAT) provide employees access to every vehicle in the Streetcar fleet, with the option to add drivers to the account for a <b>one-off</b> <b>charge</b> of £10 each. The service has been used as an example of a practical and green alternative to grey fleets or reimbursed private mileage.|$|E

5000|$|Early in {{her time}} in office, Kraft has focused on tax evasion, which is a policy that is not {{exclusively}} the reserve {{of the federal government}} and thus allowed to her to both exercise her power in her state {{as well as in the}} Bundesrat, the upper house of the federal parliament, where the states are presented and the opposition had a majority at the time. In 2013, Kraft led the Bundesrat opposition to a tax agreement with Switzerland, eventually blocking it as too easy on tax dodgers. [...] Under the proposed law, Germans with untaxed wealth in Switzerland would have been able to legitimize their holdings and retain their anonymity in exchange for paying a <b>one-off</b> penalty <b>charge</b> and submitting to a future withholding tax.|$|R

But on 19 July 2007, it unveiled plans to begin HDTV broadcasts ahead of schedule. Included on the first slate of HDTV programming are 90 Premier League football matches. Subscribers will be required upgrade to a new set-top box with a <b>one-off</b> <b>charge</b> of HK$530, pay an additional HK$38/month for set-top box rental, and an additional HK$68/month {{over and above the}} existing charge for the [...] "Mega Sports Pack". The new service will require a Netvigator broadband connection of at least 11Mbit/s.They also plan 4 a Korean Television channel.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Operating {{safety of}} {{adjacent}} pre-constructed pipeline must be insured when the crude oil and refined oil pipeline is under construction. Applying finite element method, the peak velocities of observed points located at test segment and operating segment of West to East Gas Transmission Pipeline were calculated, and {{the ratio of}} the two peak velocities in different relative positions was also obtained. Taking advantage of quantitative relationship between the detonation charge and vibration velocity of particle on the pipeline, the ratio of detonation charge is derived from the peak velocity ratio, thereby the blasting scheme of West to East Gas Transmission Pipeline with different thickness is ascertained. This method is not only economical and convenient, but also has no damage to the pipeline, which also works for other blast schemes of different conditions. Summary The west crude oil pipeline parallels to West to East Gas Transmission Pipeline for a long distance, and the gap between the two pipes is less than 50 meter in some areas, where the blasting operation is inevitable during the construction. Thus damage to the West to East Gas transmission Pipeline might be caused by nearby-blast induced shock wave, medium-distance-blast induced vibration and spall splash, and far blast induced vibration. Therefore, a reasonable <b>one-off</b> <b>charge</b> blast scheme is necessary to set up so as to make sure the operation safety of West to East Gas Transmission Pipeline during the process of blast operation. 2. Parameters determined by tests In the domestic and abroad, we generally take a particle’s vibration velocity or acceleration caused by blast operation as the structures ’ failure criterion.

5000|$|Results were mixed, and the Peel Group {{began looking}} for an outside {{investor}} for Peel Airports. In June 2010 {{it was announced that}} Vantage Airport Group (formerly Vancouver Airport Services) had bought a 65% shareholding in Peel Airports, while the Peel Group retained the remaining 35%. The new management team at Peel Airports quickly began disposing of assets, selling them back to the Peel Group. First to go was Durham Tees Valley Airport in February 2012. Sale of the loss-making DTVA resulted in a <b>one-off</b> impairment <b>charge</b> of £8.8m, causing Peel Airports' losses to rise from £3.2m to £11.4m. The same year, Doncaster Sheffield Airport made an operating loss of £3.4m (down from £3.7m the previous year), and in December 2012 it was announced that this airport had also been sold back to the Peel Group.|$|R

40|$|This article aims {{to assess}} the {{economic}} {{issues related to the}} accounting treatment of goodwill, and more specifically the likely repercussions of the transition to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) on the consolidated accounts of listed companies with effect from 1 January 2005. Based on observations derived from a representative database of French groups, the article demonstrates a marked increase in the amount of goodwill and similar intangible assets in the balance sheets of large groups, and especially of CAC 40 groups, for whom the ratio of such assets to equity reached 82 % in 2002. The difficulties experienced in some sectors, especially telecoms and media, led some groups to record substantial write-downs of goodwill and similar intangibles, leading to huge accounting losses being reported in 2001 and 2002. The gearing of these groups, which had risen as a result of external growth strategies partly based on debt financing, then increased further due to the contraction in equity caused by these losses. Hence the observation of a deterioration in balance sheet structure in 2002, extending into 2003. In the light of these observations, can accounting standards yield information that accurately reflects deterioration in a company’s financial structure as early as possible? In view of the rapid developments in recent years described in this article, {{the question of whether or}} not to amortise goodwill is no longer a relevant issue. Nevertheless, in a broader perspective, the virtual disappearance of goodwill amortisation that is likely to result from the adoption of IFRS could, in an economic downturn, induce greater volatility in financial statements, at the level of both earnings and equity. This is because downward adjustments of valuations are likely to take the form of <b>one-off</b> <b>charges</b> rather than being spread over time. Notwithstanding this potential additional volatility, the approach recommended by IFRS 3 on business combinations nonetheless gives financial statement users important information about changes in the wealth of a group during an economic downturn, and indicates any loss of that wealth due to over-priced acquisitions. Recognition of goodwill as a separate asset thus has the effect of highlighting the potential fragility of corporate wealth which is based partly on goodwill. Furthermore, it contributes to the general drive towards greater international comparability of accounting standards. However, impairment tests cannot always rely on market prices. There is no guarantee that there will be a deep and liquid market in assets comparable with those that generated the goodwill, and the more specific the asset and the longer the period since acquisition, the more this will apply. It therefore becomes necessary to devise hypotheses, which provide some latitude in the choice of valuations. Moreover, the extent of impairment losses may in itself send out a strong signal, leading to a reappraisal of expectations and share prices. This could trigger a downward spiral, which could only be contained in an efficient market. In the final analysis, the impact of the reform of the accounting treatment of business combinations, and of goodwill arising on such combinations, will largely hinge on how the preparers of financial statements apply IFRS 3, and on the scrutiny brought to bear on the accuracy and meaning of the figures by auditors and analysts. Users will no doubt be able to place more reliance on financial statement preparation and analysis in sectors where only a few large groups have goodwill in their balance sheets, making comparisons between groups easier. Information will be harder to assess where valuations of goodwill and intangibles relate to highly specific or relatively new activities. ...|$|R
