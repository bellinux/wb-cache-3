He had been brought up in an anti-apartheid atmosphere; although his parents were not activists, they were opposed to racial discrimination and this was to have a profound influence on his later career. Like many other South African Jews, he chose to become conspicuously active in public life in an effort to oppose or alleviate the worst aspects of apartheid. While he was chairman of {{the university}}'s Students' Representative Council, he campaigned against the exclusion <b>of</b> <b>black</b> <b>students.</b> He also attracted attention from the state security police by having contact with anti-apartheid groups within South Africa, including the African National Congress, which was a banned organisation at the time. On one occasion he secretly tape-recorded a spy sent by the police to infiltrate the anti-apartheid student movement at the university. The recording was later used as evidence in the firing of the national police commissioner.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, {{a lawsuit}} {{challenging}} this segregation {{led to a}} 1983 settlement agreement in which St. Louis County school districts agreed to accept black students from the city on a voluntary basis. State funds were used to transport students to provide an integrated education. The agreement also called for white students from the county to voluntarily attend city magnet schools, {{in an effort to}} desegregate the City's remaining schools. Despite opposition from state and local political leaders, the plan significantly desegregated St. Louis schools; in 1980, 82 percent <b>of</b> <b>black</b> <b>students</b> in the city attended all-black schools, while in 1995, only 41 percent did so. During the late 1990s, the St. Louis voluntary transfer program was the largest such program in the United States, with more than 14,000 enrolled students.|$|E
5|$|Under {{a renewed}} {{agreement}} in 1999, {{all but one}} of the St. Louis County districts agreed to continue their participation, albeit with an opt-out clause that allowed districts to reduce the number of incoming transfer students starting in 2002. In addition, districts have been permitted to reduce available seats in the program. Since 1999, districts have reduced availability by five percent annually. A five-year extension of the voluntary transfer program was approved in 2007, and another five-year extension was approved in 2012, allowing new enrollments to take place through the 20182019 school year in participating districts. Critics of the transfer program note that most of the desegregation under the plan is via transfer <b>of</b> <b>black</b> <b>students</b> to the county rather than transfer of white students to the city. Another criticism has been that the program weakens city schools by removing talented students to county schools. Despite these issues, the program will continue until all transfer students reach graduation; with the last group of transfer students allowed to enroll in 20182019, the program will end after the 20302031 school year.|$|E

I found four relationships:^ 1.

Participants identified strong sense of self and sense of connection as two core dimensions of success for all of their students, but identified knowing the “rules of the private school game” and having a strong support network early on as important success factors for <b>Black</b> <b>students.</b> ^ 3. It is possible to develop valid and reliable measures of teacher perceptions of racial climate and <b>Black</b> <b>student</b> coping. ^ 4.

25|$|American {{public school}} systems, {{especially}} in large metropolitan areas, {{to a large}} extent are still de facto segregated. Whether due to Brown, or due to Congressional action, or due to societal change, the percentage <b>of</b> <b>black</b> <b>students</b> attending majority-black school districts decreased somewhat until the early 1980s, at which point that percentage began to increase. By the late 1990s, the percentage <b>of</b> <b>black</b> <b>students</b> in mostly minority school districts had returned to about what it was in the late 1960s. In Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1 (2007), the Court held that, if a school system became racially imbalanced due to social factors other than governmental racism, then the state is not as free to integrate schools as if the state had been at fault for the racial imbalance. This is especially evident in the charter school system where parents of students can pick which schools their children attend based on the amenities provided by that school and the needs of the child. It seems that race is a factor in the choice of charter school.|$|E

25|$|Segregation in {{education}} has major social repercussions. The prejudice that many young African-Americans experience causes them undue stress {{which has been}} proven to undermine cognitive development. Eric Hanushek and his co-authors have considered racial concentrations in schools, and they find large and important effects. Black students appear to be systematically and physically hurt by larger concentrations <b>of</b> <b>black</b> <b>students</b> in their school. These effects extend neither to white nor to Hispanic students in the school, implying that they are related to peer interactions and not to school quality. Moreover, {{it appears that the}} effect of black concentrations in schools is largest for high achieving black students.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{desegregation}} {{under the}} plan is via transfer <b>of</b> <b>black</b> <b>students</b> to the county {{rather than in the}} suburbs-to-city component of the plan: although the plan called for 2,500 white students to enroll in city magnet schools, by the late 1980s, only 600 had done so, and in 2010, only 167 suburban students were enrolled in city schools. In contrast, roughly 6,000 city students are transferred to suburban schools as of 2010 (down from a peak of more than 14,000 in 1999–2000). Other failures included the portion of the plan that was {{to improve the quality of}} St. Louis city schools via capital improvement programs; despite considerable funding, the curriculum, course offerings, libraries, and art and music programs in city schools remained weaker than county schools. Among the criticisms of the desegregation program also has been that it weakens city schools by removing talented students to county schools. Despite these issues, the program will continue until all transfer students reach graduation; with the last group of transfer students allowed to enroll in 2013–2014, the program will end after the 2025–2026 school year.|$|E
25|$|In 1971, {{a lawsuit}} filed against the St. Louis Board of Education by a black parent alleged that the city's schools were segregated, and {{although}} local U.S. District Court JudgeJames Hargrove Meredith ruled against the parent, the decision was overturned in the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals. Judge Gerald Heaney noted that efforts to desegregate schools in St. Louis City might require an interdistrict solution that would involve county schools, and the 8th Circuit returned the case to Meredith for reconsideration. During this period, the NAACP had joined the case by filing suit against suburban school districts alleging their participation in a segregating system prior to 1954, due to their busing of black suburban students into the city based on state segregation laws. Following Meredith's death in 1981, a plan was developed under court order by Edward T. Foote II that attempted to rectify the segregation situation {{in the city and}} county districts by having suburban districts voluntarily accept black students from the city. Because the state of Missouri was responsible for the state law that encouraged the initial busing <b>of</b> <b>black</b> <b>students</b> into the city from the county, the state would be required to pay all transportation costs and any cost that the suburban districts incurred in educating the students.|$|E
40|$|American {{colleges and}} {{universities}} have traditionally lumped all <b>of</b> their <b>black</b> <b>students</b> into a unified “Black/African/African American 2 ̆ 2 category. However, there is growing evidence that American higher education is witnessing a historic change in the racial and ethnic ancestry <b>of</b> <b>Blacks</b> who are the beneficiaries of affirmative action. Recent studies have pointed out that disproportionately large percentages <b>of</b> <b>Blacks</b> benefiting from affirmative action are foreign-born Black immigrants, their sons and/or daughters, and multiracials. In addition, the number and percentage <b>of</b> <b>blacks</b> approaching college age from these groups will increase substantially in the next five to ten years. In light of this historic change in the racial and ethnic make-up <b>of</b> <b>Blacks</b> admitted to selective higher education programs, this comment seeks urges admissions programs of selective higher education programs to start collecting relevant data about the racial and ethnic ancestry <b>of</b> its <b>Black</b> <b>students.</b> Now is an appropriate time to urge educational officials of selective higher education programs to begin to document the racial and ethnic ancestry <b>of</b> their <b>Black</b> <b>students.</b> The Department <b>of</b> Education (DOE) has issued new guidelines for the reporting of data on race and ethnicity (the Guidance) that all educational institutions must follow, which go into effect for the fall of 2010. The purpose of the Guidance is to “obtain more accurate information about the increasing number of students who identify with more than one race. ” The Guidance will require education institutions to classify self-identified Black Hispanics and self-identified Black Multiracials as either Hispanic/Latino or “Two or More Races,” respectively, not as Black/African American. While educational institutions must use the categories required by the Guidance in their reporting to the DOE, they may collect additional information regarding sub-categories for their own purposes within these categories. Since complying with the reporting requirements of the Guidance will require all educational institutions, including selective higher education programs, to gather information about the racial make up <b>of</b> its <b>Black</b> <b>students,</b> this comment urges them also to gather information about the ethnic make-up <b>of</b> its <b>Black</b> <b>students.</b> Gathering such information is vital {{in order to determine the}} exact racial and ethnic ancestry <b>of</b> its <b>Black</b> <b>students.</b> Such a process could reveal that Black Immigrants, Black Hispanics and Black Multiracials constitute a much larger percentage <b>of</b> their <b>Black</b> <b>students</b> than these educational officials realize. This information may reveal a need for a given selective higher education program to consider additional changes to its admissions process in order to increase the number and percentage <b>of</b> <b>blacks</b> whose predominate ancestry is traceable to the historical oppression <b>of</b> <b>blacks</b> in the United States...|$|R
