40|$|The {{classification}} and {{the distribution}} <b>of</b> <b>building</b> systems and the relation between climate, vegetation and distribution are reported in former reports. This is {{a report of the}} theory of the way <b>of</b> existence <b>of</b> <b>building</b> systems. We can recognise the species <b>of</b> <b>building</b> system as same as the biological world, when we survey the styles <b>of</b> <b>building</b> systems. The species <b>of</b> <b>building</b> systems exist as a community as a botanical community. So, some phenomenons of the way <b>of</b> existence <b>of</b> <b>building</b> systems are explained by the assistance of biological and ecological theory. The family tree of the species <b>of</b> <b>building</b> systems and even a kind of evolution in the historical change of the species are recognised. Then a new classification system <b>of</b> <b>building</b> systems unifying material, system, form is formed according to the theory, and 6 fundamental styles <b>of</b> <b>building</b> systems are abstructed. And at final stage, the 3 law of the distribution <b>of</b> <b>building</b> systems are explaned. 1. density- there are some high density communities called city. 2. similarity <b>of</b> nabours- nabour <b>building</b> systems have some similarity. 3, continuation and symmetry of distribution- styles <b>of</b> <b>building</b> systems change continuously and symmetrically...|$|R
