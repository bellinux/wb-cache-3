5|$|The National Gallery {{opened to}} the public on 10 May 1824, housed in Angerstein's former townhouse at No. 100 Pall Mall. Angerstein's {{paintings}} were joined in 1826 by those from Beaumont's collection, and in 1831 by the Reverend William Holwell Carr's bequest of 35 paintings. Initially the Keeper of Paintings, William Seguier, bore the burden <b>of</b> <b>managing</b> <b>the</b> Gallery, but in July 1824 some of this responsibility fell to the newly formed board of trustees.|$|E
5|$|When Deacon Adams died in 1748, Adams {{was given}} the {{responsibility}} <b>of</b> <b>managing</b> <b>the</b> family's affairs. In October 1749, he married Elizabeth Checkley, his pastor's daughter. Elizabeth gave birth to six children {{over the next seven}} years, but only two lived to adulthood: Samuel (born 1751) and Hannah (born 1756). In July 1757, Elizabeth died soon after giving birth to a stillborn son. Adams remarried in 1764 to Elizabeth Wells, but had no other children.|$|E
5|$|After the election, {{many analysts}} {{concluded}} {{that it was the}} unity of the opposition parties against Congress, missing in the 1962 elections, that made the difference. The victory is attributed to the electoral alliance between DMK and Rajaji. Even though Congress had done an effective job <b>of</b> <b>managing</b> <b>the</b> state of Madras, the effective grass roots campaigning by the DMK and the political acumen of Annadurai, defeated the Congress and its leader M. Bhaktavatsalam. The popularity of the United Front was so large {{that they were able to}} win an absolute majority in ten out of the 14 districts in the state, while Congress could not accomplish that in a single district. This was largely due to the fact that the United Front was able to capitalize on its growing support in large towns and cities, combined with the decline in Congress support in its traditional Schedule Caste constituencies.|$|E

5|$|Benzodiazepines have a {{reputation}} with patients and doctors for causing a severe and traumatic withdrawal; however, this is in large {{part due to the}} withdrawal process being poorly managed. Over-rapid withdrawal from benzodiazepines increases the severity of the withdrawal syndrome and increases the failure rate. A slow and gradual withdrawal customised to the individual and, if indicated, psychological support is the most effective way <b>of</b> <b>managing</b> <b>the</b> withdrawal. Opinion as to the time needed to complete withdrawal ranges from four weeks to several years. A goal of less than six months has been suggested, but due to factors such as dosage and type of benzodiazepine, reasons for prescription, lifestyle, personality, environmental stresses, and amount of available support, a year or more may be needed to withdraw.|$|E
5|$|Free {{from any}} {{constitutional}} duties {{during the time}} between sessions, Chandler had begun laying the groundwork to succeed Laffoon as governor almost {{from the beginning of}} his term as lieutenant governor. Laffoon, however, had {{made it clear that he}} favored Thomas Rhea to be his successor. Rhea secured the services of rising political boss Earle C. Clements as his campaign manager. Hailing from Morganfield, only a short distance from Chandler's hometown of Corydon, Clements later said that if Chandler had asked him first, he might have managed Chandler's campaign instead of Rhea's. Instead, by virtue <b>of</b> <b>managing</b> <b>the</b> opposing campaign, Clements became the leader of a Democratic faction that opposed Chandler for the next three decades.|$|E
5|$|The 1215 charter {{had several}} clauses {{relating}} to the royal forests; clauses 47 and 48 promised to deforest the lands added to the forests under John and investigate the use of royal rights in this area, but notably {{did not address the}} forestation of the previous kings, while clause 53 promised some form of redress for those affected by the recent changes, and clause 44 promised some relief from the operation of the forest courts. Neither Magna Carta nor the subsequent Charter of the Forest proved entirely satisfactory as a way <b>of</b> <b>managing</b> <b>the</b> political tensions arising in the operation of the royal forests.|$|E

5|$|The UN plan {{required}} that all exiled Namibians {{be given the}} opportunity to return to their country in time to participate in the electoral process. This was implemented by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), supported by a number of other UN agencies and programmes. In Namibia, the Council of Churches in Namibia (CCN) was UNHCR's implementing partner. Most returning Namibians returned from Angola; many came from Zambia, and a small number came from 46 other countries after the proclamation of a general amnesty. The logistics <b>of</b> <b>managing</b> <b>the</b> returnees was largely delegated to the Australian contingent.|$|E
5|$|The demands <b>of</b> <b>managing</b> <b>the</b> ranch consume all of Chetwin's time, leaving Wilton to feel {{neglected}} and unloved. One day, a traveler is injured near the ranch, whom she recognizes as Pelham. Pelham courts her, {{taking advantage of}} her loneliness. Although she admits she does not love him, he convinces her to abandon her family and run away with him. As she is preparing to depart, she is confronted by Starlight, an Indian woman {{who works as a}} servant on the ranch, who reminds Wilton of the needs of her child. She spurns Pelham and returns to her family. Eventually, Chetwin forgives her and devotes more of his time to her. Pelham may have been killed by Starlight, although his ultimate fate is left unclear.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} {{repatriation}} {{did not end}} there, though. Upon their return to Australia the effort shifted towards placing the returned soldiers into employment, or education {{and taking care of}} those that were too badly injured to work. In order to meet these needs the Commonwealth established the Repatriation Department, tasked with managing the placement of returned soldiers into employment, training, education, housing. Eventually this also included the colossal task <b>of</b> <b>managing</b> <b>the</b> provision of war pensions, managing repatriation hospitals and convalescent homes and administering the Soldier Settlement Scheme. The total cost of these provisions was considerable, and in June 1935 it was estimated to have cost approximately Â£238,000,000 which was more than the total amount spent on defence during the war.|$|E

5|$|Under the {{guidance}} of General Hermann Balck, the cities of Zhytomyr and Korosten were retaken in mid-November, but after receiving reinforcements Vatutin resumed the offensive on 24 December 1943, and the Red Army continued its successful advance. Manstein's repeated requests to Hitler for more reinforcements were turned down. On 4 January 1944 Manstein met with Hitler {{to tell him that}} the Dnieper line was untenable and that he needed to retreat in order to save his forces. Hitler refused, and Manstein again requested changes in {{the highest levels of the}} military leadership, but was turned down, as Hitler believed that he alone was capable <b>of</b> <b>managing</b> <b>the</b> wider strategy.|$|E
5|$|In {{the charter}} of the Presidential Council, each of the three leaders would sit on a Presidential Council which would be tasked with {{approving}} all major policy decisions of the country. At the same time, each would get two years as the President of the country able to implement many of the ongoing tasks <b>of</b> <b>managing</b> <b>the</b> military and civil service in the country. The various ministerial positions would be divided between the three leaders; however, the Ministry of the Interior and the Minister of the Army would be appointed by the sitting president. It was decided that Maga would be the first President from 1970 until 1972, followed by AhomadÃ©gbÃ© until 1974, and then Apithy until 1976. One peaceful transition occurred with Hubert Maga giving power to Justin AhomadÃ©gbÃ©-TomÃªtin on 7 May 1972. However, stalled politics ensued with Maga and Apithy working to undermine AhomadÃ©gbÃ©'s ability to govern and the Presidential Council was ended on 26 October 1972 when a military coup led by Mathieu KÃ©rÃ©kou assumed power and ruled the country until 1991.|$|E
5|$|When the Admiral {{died after}} 46 years <b>of</b> <b>managing</b> <b>the</b> estate it was mortgaged for Â£250,000, despite {{the sale of}} a number of the lands {{originally}} included in it. The house fell into disrepair under the ownership of George Arthur, the sixth and final laird, who had inherited his father's lifestyle. The entire estate was put on the market in September 1909 but remained unsold until after the First World War; the house and what remained of the estate were finally purchased by a speculator, Edgar Fairweather, from London in 1926. Fairweather bought several other Scottish estates, including those nearby at Auchmeddan and Strichen; he habitually reduced the estates into smaller holdings that he then sold on or rented out. The house was sold to an Aberdeen building company and was demolished sometime between 1927 and 1930. After demolition, the mansion's veranda was installed at the front of Kinloch Farmhouse in St Fergus. Other remains from the mansion have been discovered at the farmhouse, including a crest above the conservatory door and tiles inscribed with the Ferguson of Pitfour family crest. The stone from the mansion was transported to Aberdeen and used in the construction of council houses.|$|E
