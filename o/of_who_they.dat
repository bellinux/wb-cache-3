25|$|Understanding {{consumer}} {{personality and}} how people view others is important. People were shown ads talking of {{the harmful effects of}} binge drinking. People who valued close friends as a sense <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>they</b> are were less likely to want to binge drink after seeing an ad featuring them and a close friend. People who were loners or who did not see close friends important to their sense <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>they</b> were reacted better to ads featuring an individual. A similar pattern was shown for ads showing a person driving at dangerous speeds. This suggests ads showing potential harm to citizens from binge drinking or dangerous driving are less effective than ads highlighting a person’s close friends.|$|E

25|$|The Igbo have {{traditionally}} believed in reincarnation, ilo-uwa. People {{are believed to}} reincarnate into families that {{they were part of}} while alive. People can usually reincarnate seven times, giving seven opportunities to enter the spirit world successfully as an ancestor. The person's cycle number on earth is unknown to them. Unlike in Hinduism, humans can only reincarnate as humans. Families hire fortune tellers to reveal the ancestral identity of the child in their former life, the baby is sometimes named after this relative. The personality of the ancestor is not identical to the child's but rather the concept establishes a vital relationship with the child and characteristics of the ancestor. Before a relative dies, it is said that the soon to be deceased relative sometimes give clues <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>they</b> will reincarnate as in the family. Once a child is born, he or she is believed to give signs <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>they</b> have reincarnated from. This can be through behaviour, physical traits and statements by the child. A diviner can help in detecting who the child has reincarnated from. It is considered an insult if a male is said to have reincarnated as a female. An ancestor may reincarnate as multiple people in which case share a mortal bond; upon the death of one person, it is believed that the others may die a sudden death if they see the corpse.|$|E

25|$|Reception to Wenjack {{was later}} {{overshadowed by the}} controversies around Boyden's {{genealogy}} and tribal affiliations.

Egyptian temples are typical in that the most largest and most lavish decoration was placed on the parts that could be seen by the general public, rather than the areas seen only by the priests. Many areas of royal palaces, castles and the houses of the social elite were often generally accessible, and large parts of the art collections of such people could often be seen, either by anybody, or by those able to pay a small price, or those wearing the correct clothes, regardless <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>they</b> were, as at the Palace of Versailles, where the appropriate extra accessories (silver shoe buckles and a sword) could be hired from shops outside.|$|E
