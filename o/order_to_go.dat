5|$|Erected as a {{permanent}} memorial to the men of Oldham {{who were killed in}} the First World War, Oldham's war memorial consists of a granite base surmounted by a bronze sculpture depicting five soldiers making their way along the trenches in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> into battle. The main standing figure, having climbed out of the trenches, is shown calling on his comrades to advance, and is the same figure used at the Royal Fusiliers War Memorial in London and the 41st Division memorial at Flers in France. The base serves to house books containing the roll of honour of the 1st, 10th and 24th Battalions, Manchester Regiment. The pedestal has two bronze doors at either side.|$|E
5|$|In February 1942, A, B and C Troops were {{dispatched}} to the Outer Hebrides {{under the command of}} Captain Lord Lovat for extra training. Returning to Troon in March, they were immediately sent to Dartmouth, Devon where they embarked on HMS Prins Albert. Once on board they were informed about Operation Bludgeon and started mission training. The objective of this raid was a large building that was a short distance inland from the Dutch coast, and that was used by senior German officers. For the duration of the operation BTroop were issued with flamethrowers to set the building on fire. After several days training, the commandos moved around the coast and anchored in the Thames waiting for the <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>go.</b> The operation was eventually cancelled, due to the increased German E-Boat activity {{in the area of the}} landing.|$|E
5|$|Underwood {{announces that}} he will not run for reelection, and advocates for America Works, which he intends to pay for by {{stripping}} entitlement programs. He fails to get the bill through Congress and uses that as a reason to renege on his promise to not run in 2016. Solicitor General Heather Dunbar (Elizabeth Marvel) announces that she will seek the presidential nomination, and actually gives Underwood a battle. Underwood convinces Sharp to get married so she can announce her candidacy, for the sole reason of sapping women’s votes from Dunbar, at which point she will withdraw and accept the nomination for VP. After the presidential debate, in which Underwood publicly humiliates Sharp in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> after Dunbar, Sharp retaliates by backing Dunbar's campaign. Ultimately, however, Underwood wins the Iowa caucuses.|$|E

5|$|North of {{the first}} exit with St. Paul Street, Ridge Road resurfaces as East Ridge Road, which {{parallels}} the expressway to the north. NY104 continues through Rochester and Irondequoit, connecting to North Clinton Avenue, Seneca Avenue, Hudson Avenue, Carter Street, Portland Avenue, North Goodman Street and Culver Road by way of interchanges. Between the Goodman Street and Culver Road exits, NY104 passes the former Medley Centre. East of Culver, NY104 encounters NY590 and connects to NY590 southbound by way of an interchange. East Ridge Road runs {{through the middle of}} this interchange, although there are no connections between Ridge and NY104. There is also no access from NY104 eastbound to NY590 northbound; eastbound traffic must take Culver Road in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> north toward Sea Breeze. Just east of the NY590 interchange, NY104 becomes the Irondequoit–Wayne County Expressway and crosses the Irondequoit Bay by way of the Irondequoit Bay Bridge. An access road between NY104 just west of the bridge and NY590 at Titus Avenue was once planned. Although entrance and exit ramps were built for the connection along NY104, the rest of the link was never built, leaving no access from NY104 westbound to NY590 northbound and from NY590 southbound to NY104 eastbound.|$|E
5|$|Outside {{the video}} games, Kyo has made {{appearances}} which met disapproval by critics. Lucas M. Thomas from IGN lamented {{the fact that}} Kyo has a few appearances in the volume from the manhua The King of Fighters 2003 in comparison to Ash Crimson, who is the greater focus of the series. Den of Geek found ridiculous the comic SVC Chaos as when Kyo is killed by Akuma and Takuma Sakazaki in the first chapter, Iori in turn kills himself in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to the afterlife and kill Kyo there which in turn causes M. Bison to also kill himself to search Iori. Additionally, John Funk from The Escapist found Kyo's actor in the series' live-action confusing since they changed his nationality from Japanese to North American when first announced seeing {{as one of the}} weakest points from the upcoming movie. Beyond Hollywood was also confused by Kyo's portrayal in the film due to flashbacks of his childhood featuring him as Japanese whereas his adult self is American.|$|E

The unit was previously fitted in Atlasjet's other MD-83 aircraft (registered TC-AKN) but it had been switched a week prior to the accident.

25|$|Some {{economists have}} criticized the {{efficiency}} of democracy, citing {{the premise of the}} irrational voter, or a voter who makes decisions without all of the facts or necessary information {{in order to make a}} truly informed decision. Another argument is that democracy slows down processes because of the amount of input and participation needed in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> forward with a decision. A common example often quoted to substantiate this point is the high economic development achieved by China (a non-democratic country) as compared to India (a democratic country). According to economists, the lack of democratic participation in countries like China allows for unfettered economic growth.|$|E

The US segment of the US$1.1 billion line, would be built by Northern Pass Transmission LLC, a partnership between Northeast Utilities (75%) and NSTAR (25%). In <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> ahead, the project must receive regulatory approval in Quebec and the United States. The proposed transmission line could be in operation in 2015.
