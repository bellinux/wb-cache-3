5|$|The ZX81 {{could be}} bought by mail order {{in kit form}} or pre-assembled. In {{what was then a}} major innovation, it was the first cheap mass-market home {{computer}} that could be bought from high street stores, led by W. H. Smith and soon many other retailers. The ZX81 marked the first time that computing in Britain became an activity for the general public, rather than the preserve of businesspeople and electronics hobbyists. It inspired the creation of a huge community of enthusiasts, some of whom founded their <b>own</b> <b>businesses</b> producing software and hardware for the ZX81. Many went on {{to play a major role}} in the British computer industry in later years. The ZX81's commercial success made Sinclair Research one of Britain's leading computer manufacturers and earned a fortune and an eventual knighthood for the company's founder, Sir Clive Sinclair.|$|E

5|$|In November 1938, a young Jewish man {{requested}} {{an interview}} with the German ambassador in Paris and met with a legation secretary, whom he shot and killed to protest his family's treatment in Germany. This incident provided the pretext for a pogrom the NSDAP incited against the Jews on 9 November 1938. Members of the SA damaged or destroyed synagogues and Jewish property throughout Germany. At least 91 German Jews were killed during this pogrom, later called Kristallnacht, the Night of Broken Glass. Further restrictions were imposed on Jews in the coming months– they were forbidden to <b>own</b> <b>businesses</b> or work in retail shops, drive cars, go to the cinema, visit the library or own weapons and Jewish pupils were removed from schools. The Jewish community was fined one billion marks to pay for the damage caused by Kristallnacht and told that any money received via insurance claims would be confiscated. By 1939, around 250,000 of Germany's 437,000 Jews emigrated to the United States, Argentina, Great Britain, Palestine and other countries. Many chose to stay in continental Europe. Emigrants to Palestine were allowed to transfer property there {{under the terms of the}} Haavara Agreement, but those moving to other countries had to leave virtually all their property behind and it was seized by the government.|$|E

25|$|The {{independent}} {{spirit that}} governed Cox's {{life and career}} was a characteristic shared by many early blues stars, including Bessie Smith, Ma Rainey, Sippie Wallace, and Victoria Spivey.

The Law of Personal Status is applied to all Tunisians regardless of their religion. The Code of Personal Status {{remains one of the most}} progressive civil codes in North Africa and the Muslim world.|$|E
