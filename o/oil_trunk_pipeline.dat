40|$|The present article studies a {{procedure}} of calculating {{the strength of}} pipeline support constructions of the above-ground <b>oil</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>pipeline</b> system «Zapolyar'e — oil pumping station «Pur-pe». The calculations of the supports stress-strain state are performed {{with the use of}} computer complex Ansys v 13, which applies the finite element method. The article provides a short description of the construction of fixed, linear-sliding and free-sliding supports of the oil pipeline of above-ground routing, developed for the installation in complex climatic and geologic conditions of the far north. According to the operation specification for design — the support constructions have to maintain the resistance power and bearing capacity {{under the influence of the}} pipeline stress without sagging and considering the possible sagging of the neighboring support. The support constructions represent space structures with a complex geometry. Together with the complex geometry, contacting elements are present in the construction of the supports. There is also an interaction of the pile foundation and the nonhomogeneous foundation. The enumerated peculiarities of the construction and operating conditions of the supports considerably complicate the strength calculations by engineering methods. The method of numerical modeling (finite element method) used in the article for the analysis of the supports’ operation under the stress is widely applied at the present time for calculations of space structures with a complex geometry. For the first time, while performing the supports’ strength calculations, the article considers the mutual deformation of the support, foundation grill and pile foundation in the ground, thus making it possible to consider real operation of the construction altogether. The main development stages of the calculation model “support — pile foundation — ground” in ANSYS, calculation and testing of the static strength of the support constructions are discussed in the article. The authors provide the calculation examples of the supports' stress-strain state for unfavorable combination of loads with maximum bending moment for a fixed support and maximum vertical force and maximum longitudinal-lateral displacement of the top part for a free-sliding support. The use of modern approaches to the operation modeling of the support constructions allows avoiding the excessive conservatism in estimating the stress-strain state of the supports and allows developing the construction optimal for metal intensity, while meeting the requirements for allowable stresses according to the actual normative documents...|$|E
40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] commercial transportation of crude oil and petroleum products by pipeline is receiving increased attention in South Africa. Transnet Pipeline Transport has recently obtained permission from the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (Nersa) to construct and operate a new petroleum products pipeline of 60 cm diameter from Durban to Gauteng. At an operating speed of 10 km/h the proposed 60 cm Transnet pipeline {{would be able to}} deliver 3, 54 million litres of petroleum product per hour. This is equivalent to 89 deliveries per hour using road tank vehicles with an average carrying capacity of 40 000 litres of fuel per vehicle. This pipeline throughput is also equivalent to two trains departing per hour, each consisting of 42 petroleum tank wagons with an average carrying capacity of 42 500 litres of fuel per wagon. Considering that such road trucks and rail wagons return empty to the upstream refineries in Durban, it is clear that there is no tenable long-term alternative to pipeline transport: • pipeline transport is substantially cheaper than road and rail transport; • pipeline transport is much safer than rail and especially road transport; and • pipeline transport frees up alternative road and rail transport capacity. Pipeline transport is a non-containerised bulk mode of transport for the carriage of suitable liquids (for example, petroleum commodities, which include crude oil, refined fuel products and liquid petro-chemicals), gas, slurrified coal and certain water-suspended ores and minerals. In South Africa, petroleum products account for the majority of commercial pipeline traffic, followed by crude oil and natural gas. There are three basic types of petroleum pipeline transport systems: 1. Gathering pipeline systems 2. Crude <b>oil</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>pipeline</b> systems 3. Refined products pipeline systems Collectively, these systems provide a continuous link between extraction, processing, distribution, and wholesalers’ depots in areas of consumption. The following activities are involved in the flow of goods between place of origin and place of consumption or application: (1) Demand forecasting, (2) Facility site selection, (3) Procurement, (4) Materials handling, (5) Packaging, (6) Warehouse management, (7) Inventory management, (8) Order processing, (9) Logistics communications, (10) Transport, (11) Reverse logistics. Because cost is incurred without adding value each time goods are handled (activity 4) at a terminal or storage facility, a primary logistics objective is to eliminate handling wherever possible. With the carriage of crude oil and petroleum products by pipeline this objective is fully met. Commodity intake, haulage, and discharge are combined in one process, usually a remotecontrolled operation. Pipeline transport is a non-containerised bulk mode of transport thereby obviating the need for packaging (activity 5) and returning empty containers. Pipelines provide a direct and long-term link between these origins and destinations. If necessary a continuous service can be provided with no need for a return trip or a reverse pumping process (activity 11). The elimination of handling, packaging and reverse logistics activities contribute substantially to the high measure of economies of scale that pipeline transport enjoys. The article provides a description of each of the eleven logistics activities in the context of pipeline transport. Effective logistics service is a prerequisite to help ensure that customers receive the required products at the desired quality and quantity, where and when needed. The most pertinent determinants of logistics service performance are (1) suitability, (2) accessibility, (3) goods security, (4) transit time, (5) reliability and (6) flexibility.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Long term {{service of}} <b>oil</b> and gas <b>trunk</b> <b>pipelines</b> in {{corrosion}} and hydrogenated environments {{can cause a}} degradation of the mechanical properties and correspondingly a decrease its lifetime. Effect of service about 30 years on the impact strength and hydrogen cracking of <b>oil</b> and gas <b>trunk</b> <b>pipeline</b> low alloyed steels is considered. In {{the case of the}} “bottom ” section of the oil pipe being in service, it has been not possible to evaluate the impact strength, due to the deflection into cracking parallel to the pipe wall. This is a symptom of so called hydrogen induced stratification, well known degradation phenomenon of industrial pipe lines transporting the crude oil containing the higher amount of the hydrogen sulfide and the sulfide-reduction bacteria. The different susceptibility to hydrogen cracking and impact strength for the upper and bottom of parts of exploited pipe has been explained as a result of hydrogen charging and hydrogen degradation of steel during the service. The results discussed in the paper show that inspection of the surfaces of installations to find corrosion or mechanical damage alone may not be sufficient for proper evaluating risk of failure. Since material can loss its initial mechanical properties, a thorough investigation of the properties of the metal being in service under the hydrogenation conditions for the long time is suggested...|$|R

40|$|The article {{deals with}} the {{questions}} of designing the foundations for the Oil Pumping Station- 2 site of "Kuyumba - Tayshet" <b>trunk</b> <b>oil</b> <b>pipeline.</b> The problems of choice and grounds for technical solutions are considered basing {{on the results of}} complex thermotechnical calculations. The construction territory of OPS- 2 site of "Kuyumba - Tayshet" <b>trunk</b> <b>oil</b> <b>pipeline</b> is characterized by complex engineering and geocryological conditions: 1) presence of permafrost soil on 80 % of the site area; 2) absence of sufficiently widespread rocky soils under designed buildings and constructions; 3) transition of loamy grounds into yield during thawing. The buildings and facilities are designed on the basis of pile foundation type with high rigid foundation grill. The piles’ diameter is 325 mm and 426 mm, the total length of piles is 9 - 12 m. The full designed vertical loading, transferred to the pile, is ranging from 10. 6 to 50. 4 tf. According to the results of the calculations, in order to provide the necessary bearing capacity of piles, securing the perception of transmitted designed loadings, the equivalent temperature of the soil along the side surface of piles (e) should not be higher than - 0, 5 °C. Taking into account that the soil temperatures on the projected site mainly range from - 0. 1 to - 0. 3 °C, in order to lower their temperatures to the calculated values ventilated underground areas are arranged under the buildings and facilities and seasonally active cooling devices (soil thermal stabilizers) are installed. Assembly technique and construction of ventilated underground areas with application of soil thermal stabilizers were developed earlier while designing the pipeline system "Zapolyarye - Oil Pumping Station Purpe". For confirmation of the accepted decisions forecasting thermotechnical calculations were performed {{with the use of a}} special computer program TermoStab 67 - 87, which allows simulating the changes of temperature regimes of the permafrost in the process of construction and operation of the facility. As a result of thermo-technical calculations, in case of operation of ventilated underground areas only, in the foundation of the facilities at the OPS- 2 site (without the application of thermal stabilizers) a reduction in temperature of frozen soils is predicted, however, the required design temperatures, necessary for providing the bearing capacity of piles (- 0, 5 °C on their side surfaces and below), in one cold season cannot be achieved. For the areas of the distribution of the confluent type of the permafrost the necessary temperatures are achieved only by the 5 th year of operation, and for the areas of distribution of non-confluent type of permafrost such temperatures are not achieved even by the 10 th year of operation. A joint operation of the ventilated underground areas and soil thermal stabilization systems is conductive to the reduction of soil temperature of the buildings and facilities’ foundations up to the required values, which secure the load-bearing capacity of piles for one cold season...|$|R
