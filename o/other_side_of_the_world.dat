5|$|The {{importance}} of observing cosmological factors is also {{seen on the}} <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> The Forbidden City in Beijing is laid out to follow cosmic order though rather than observing four directions. The Chinese system was composed of five directions: North, South, East, West and Centre. The Forbidden City occupied the centre of ancient Beijing. One approaches the Emperor from the south, thus placing {{him in front of}} the circumpolar stars. This creates the situation of the heavens revolving around the person of the Emperor. The Chinese cosmology is now better known through its export as feng shui.|$|E
5|$|The {{revolution}} {{destroyed a}} colonial administration ruled from the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> and dismantled {{with it the}} raja, {{seen by many as}} obsolete and powerless. Also, it relaxed the rigid racial and social categorisations of colonial Indonesia. Tremendous energies and aspirations were created amongst Indonesians; a new creative surge was seen in writing and art, as was a great demand for education and modernisation. It did not, however, significantly improve the economic or political fortune of the population’s poverty-stricken peasant majority; only a few Indonesians were able to gain a larger role in commerce, and hopes for democracy were dashed within a decade.|$|E

25|$|Before {{the end of}} the 16th century, the Portuguese {{merchant}} fleets {{had reached}} China (where they founded the commercial colony of Macau), as well as the island archipelagos of present-day Indonesia and Japan. They established the ports of call of the Eastern trade route and made commercial agreements with the chiefs and kings in Angola and Mozambique. A large colonial empire was consolidated by Afonso de Albuquerque, his armed forces securing those ports on the Indian Ocean in locations convenient for ships outbound from Lisbon against competition from the Turks and Arabs. Local territories were generally not seized, excepting the ports that carried on a profitable trade with the natives. Meanwhile, on the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> Pedro Álvares Cabral had arrived at Brazil in 1500.|$|E
25|$|In his Divina commedia ("Divine comedy"; set in {{the year}} 1300), Dante Alighieri {{employed}} the concept of taking Virgil as his guide through Inferno (and then, in the second canticle, up the mountain of Purgatorio). Virgil himself is not condemned to Hell proper in Dante's poem but is rather, as a virtuous pagan, confined to Limbo just {{at the edge of}} Hell. The geography of Hell is very elaborately laid out in this work, with nine concentric rings leading deeper into the Earth and deeper into the various punishments of Hell, until, {{at the center of the}} world, Dante finds Satan himself trapped in the frozen lake of Cocytus. A small tunnel leads past Satan and out to the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> at the base of the Mount of Purgatory.|$|E
25|$|Although James II had {{permitted}} the Huguenots {{to settle in}} England, he had enjoyed an amicable relationship with his co-religionist Louis XIV, realising {{the importance of the}} friendship for his own Catholicising measures at home against the suspicions of his Protestant majority. But the Huguenot presence gave an immense boost to anti-French discourse, and they joined forces with elements in England already highly suspicious of James. However, conflicts between French and English commercial interests in North America had caused severe friction between the two governments: the French had grown antagonistic towards the Hudson's Bay Company and the New England colonies, while the English looked upon French pretensions in New France as encroaching upon their own possessions. This rivalry had spread to the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> where English and French East India companies had already embarked upon hostilities.|$|E

25|$|The {{multiplex}} {{consists of}} 10 cinema rooms with between 68 and 404 seats, spread over two levels {{with a total}} of 1580 seats opened in November 2013.

25|$|The Internet allows {{computer}} users to remotely access other computers and information stores easily from any access point. Access may be with computer security, i.e. authentication and encryption technologies, {{depending on the}} requirements. This is encouraging new ways of working from home, collaboration and information sharing in many industries. An accountant sitting at home can audit the books of a company based in another country, on a server situated in a third country that is remotely maintained by IT specialists in a fourth. These accounts could have been created by home-working bookkeepers, in other remote locations, based on information emailed to them from offices all over the world. Some of these things were possible before {{the widespread use of}} the Internet, but the cost of private leased lines would have made many of them infeasible in practice. An office worker away from their desk, perhaps on the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> on a business trip or a holiday, can access their emails, access their data using cloud computing, or open a remote desktop session into their office PC using a secure virtual private network (VPN) connection on the Internet. This can give the worker complete access to all of their normal files and data, including email and other applications, while away from the office. It has been referred to among system administrators as the Virtual Private Nightmare, because it extends the secure perimeter of a corporate network into remote locations and its employees' homes.|$|E
500|$|While {{attending}} {{university in}} 1996, Edwards made a short monster movie set in suburbia.

500|$|The two-colored bolete is {{distributed}} from southeastern Canada and the Great Lakes Region, primarily {{east of the}} Rocky Mountains, {{as far south as}} the Florida peninsula, and out to the [...] Midwest as far as Wisconsin. It is commonly found in deciduous woodland and usually grows under or close to broad-leaved trees, especially oak. It can be found in isolation and in groups or clusters, primarily during June through October. The two-colored bolete is also found in China and Nepal, where {{it is one of the}} most used mushrooms of over 200 species of edible mushrooms used in Nepal. This unusual distribution of the two-colored bolete and other mushrooms is known as the Grayan disjunction; the phenomenon is characterized by a species living in one continent or island and then also on the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> with no specimens of the species living in between the specific habitats. The Grayan disjunction is not uncommon among fungi.|$|E
500|$|This {{was first}} {{illustrated}} in the skirmishes between British and German navies around South America in 1914. While two German cruisers menaced British shipping, the Admiralty insisted that no battlecruisers could be spared from the main fleet {{and sent to the}} <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> to deal with them. Instead the British dispatched a pre-dreadnought of 1896 vintage, [...] Intended to stiffen the British cruisers in the area, in fact her slow speed meant that she was left behind at the disastrous Battle of Coronel. Canopus redeemed herself at the Battle of the Falkland Islands, but only when grounded to act as a harbour-defence vessel; she fired at extreme range (13,500 yards) on the German cruiser SMS Gneisenau, and while the only hit was from an inert practice shell which had been left loaded from the previous night (the 'live' shells of the salvo broke up on contact with water; one inert shell ricocheted into one of Gneisenaus funnels), this certainly deterred Gneisenau from a potentially damaging raid on a British squadron which was still taking on coal. The subsequent battle was decided by the two s which had been dispatched after Coronel. This appears to have been the only meaningful engagement of an enemy ship by a British pre-dreadnought.|$|E
500|$|The band {{returned}} to the studio, this time at Vanguard Studios in New York City, between July and September 1967. When [...] "Superbird", a tune mocking President Lyndon Johnson, was not banned from radio promotion, the band was given the go-ahead to record [...] "The Fish Cheer", which saw the group {{moving away from the}} original folk composition toward electric instrumentals more synthesized toward psychedelia. The song became the title track of the band's second album, I-Feel-Like-I'm-Fixin'-to-Die, released in November 1967. The album was not as successful as its predecessor, but still charted at number 67. The composition represented growing anti-war sentiment expressed by those opposing the Vietnam War, and is often {{considered one of the most}} recognized and celebrated protest songs of the era. [...] "The Fish Cheer" [...] was also pivotal in communicating the attitude against the war, but was set apart from other anti-war songs for its use of sarcastic humor and satire on the controversial conflict. Writer Lee Andresen reflects on the song's meaning, saying, [...] "the happy beat and insouciance of the vocalist are in odd juxtaposition to the lyrics that reinforce the sad fact that the American public was being forced into realizing that Vietnam was no longer a remote place on the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> and the damage it was doing to the country could no longer be considered collateral, involving someone else." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{idea that}} {{independence}} {{was not the}} initial concern {{is evidenced by the}} fact that few areas declared independence in the years after 1810. The congresses of Venezuela and New Granada did so in 1811 and also Paraguay in same year (14 and 15 of May 1811). Some historians explain the reluctance to declare independence as a [...] "mask of Ferdinand VII": that is, that patriot leaders felt that they needed to claim loyalty to the deposed monarch in order to prepare the masses for the radical change that full independence eventually would entail. Nevertheless, even areas such as Río de la Plata and Chile, which more or less maintained de facto independence from the peninsular authorities, did not declare independence until quite a few years later, in 1816 and 1818, respectively. Overall, despite achieving formal or de facto independence, many regions of Spanish America were marked by nearly continuous civil wars, which lasted well into the 1820s. In Mexico, where the junta movement had been stopped in its early stages by a coalition of Peninsular merchants and government officials, efforts to establish a government independent of the Regency or the French took the form of rebellion, under the leadership of Miguel Hidalgo. Hidalgo was captured and executed in 1811, but a resistance movement continued, which declared independence from Spain in 1813. In Central America, attempts at establishing juntas were also put down, but resulted in significantly less violence. The Caribbean islands, like the Philippines on the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> were relatively peaceful. Any plots to set up juntas were denounced to the authorities early enough to stop them before they gained widespread support.|$|E
500|$|The lead {{visual effects}} company was Weta Digital in Wellington, New Zealand, {{at one point}} {{employing}} 900 people {{to work on the}} film. Because of the huge amount of data which needed to be stored, cataloged and available for everybody involved, even on the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> a new cloud computing and Digital Asset Management (DAM) system named Gaia was created by Microsoft especially for Avatar, which allowed the crews to keep track of and coordinate all stages in the digital processing. To render Avatar, Weta used a [...] server farm making use of 4,000 Hewlett-Packard servers with 35,000 processor cores with 104 terabytes of RAM and three petabytes of network area storage running Ubuntu Linux, Grid Engine cluster manager, and 2 of the animation software and managers, Pixar's RenderMan and Pixar's Alfred queue management system. The render farm occupies the 193rd to 197th spots in the TOP500 list of the world's most powerful supercomputers. A new texturing and paint software system, called Mari, was developed by The Foundry in cooperation with Weta. Creating the Na'vi characters and the virtual world of Pandora required over a petabyte of digital storage, and each minute of the final footage for Avatar occupies 17.28 gigabytes of storage. Often, it would take each frame of the movie several hours to render. To help finish preparing the special effects sequences on time, a number of other companies were brought on board, including Industrial Light & Magic, which worked alongside Weta Digital to create the battle sequences. ILM was responsible for the visual effects for many of the film's specialized vehicles and devised a new way to make CGI explosions. Joe Letteri was the film's visual effects general supervisor.|$|E
