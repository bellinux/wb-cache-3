The initiative, however, did not gain ground when the RSK refused to negotiate.|$|E

40|$|The <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> powers {{doctrine}} is well-known {{at the federal}} government level but this doctrine has had little impact at the state government level in Australia, especially Queensland. The problem is that Australian democracy is based on responsible government and the Westminster parliamentary system and {{is not based on}} the <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> powers. First, the paper provides a brief survey of the main writers on the doctrine <b>of</b> the <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> powers. Second, the paper looks at the case study of Queensland where the executive infringes on the functions of the legislature and the judiciary. Third, the paper looks at a new contribution to the SOP doctrine with a legislative or constitutional recognition <b>of</b> the <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> powers and also a Bill of Rights. Although there is no formal or constitutional <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> powers at the state level, there is an implied <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> powers in practice at the state level in Australia. The Queensland Constitution does not outline the <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> powers particularly the <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> the judicial power.

5|$|Hill {{also argued}} that if the Electoral Act {{actually}} appeared to confer jurisdiction on the court, it was nevertheless invalid, as the determination of disputes about election results is a non-judicial function.
