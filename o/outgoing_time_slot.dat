50|$|The Digital Local Exchange (DLE) {{connects to}} the {{concentrator}} and routes calls to different DLEs or DMSUs depending on the destination of the call. The heart of the DLE is the Digital Switching Subsystem (DSS) which consists of Time Switches and a Space Switch. Incoming traffic on the 30 channel PCM highways from the Concentrator Units is connected to Time Switches. The purpose of these is to take any incoming individual Time Slot and connect it to an <b>outgoing</b> <b>Time</b> <b>Slot</b> and so perform a switching and routing function. To allow access to a large range of outgoing routes, individual Time Switches are connected to each other by a Space Switch. The Time Slot inter-connections are held in Switch Maps which are updated by Software running on the Processor Utility Subsystem (PUS).|$|E
40|$|As {{we saw in}} class, a {{simplified}} formulation for computing the saturation throughput of a 2 x 2 input queued switch (single queue per input, i. e. without VOQ's) is the following. The head-ofline cells of the two input queues may have the following destination combinations: (i) " 00 ", meaning that they are both destined to output 0; or (ii) " 01 ", meaning the first is destined to output 0 {{and the other is}} destined to output 1; or (iii) " 10 "; or (iv) " 11 ". If we assume that the switch is saturated, the queues are always non-empty. If we assume that arrivals are i. i. d. (independent identically distributed) with uniformly distributed destinations, then the probability of each of the above combinations is 0. 25, and it is independent of the combination in the previous <b>time</b> <b>slot</b> and of the service decision made in the previous <b>time</b> <b>slot.</b> Combinations 01 and 10 yield 2 <b>outgoing</b> cells per <b>time</b> <b>slot</b> for the two outputs (average throughput 1. 0 per output), while combinations 00 and 11 yield only 1 <b>outgoing</b> cell per <b>time</b> <b>slot</b> for both outputs (average throughput 0. 5 per output). Hence, the average (saturation) throughput per output over a long time window will be: 0. 25 * 0. 5 + 0. 25 * 1. 0 + 0. 25 * 1. 0 + 0. 25 * 0. 5 = 0. 75. Using the same technique, calculate the saturation throughput of a 3 x 3 input queued switch (single queue per input). The head-of-line cells of the three input queues may form 2...|$|R

30|$|The OP- 1 in Section 3.3 is {{difficult}} to solve since it involves an optimization over T <b>time</b> <b>slots,</b> M subcarriers, K users, and with MAC-layer QoS requirements. The CBS {{should be able to}} allocate the subcarriers and power to K SUs at the beginning of T <b>time</b> <b>slots</b> based on the solution of OP- 1, therefore, in OP- 1, the knowledge of future channel gains (i.e., the channel gain at future <b>time</b> <b>slots)</b> is required. However, it is impossible for the CBS to obtain future channel information, so, we need to simplify the QoS requirements over T <b>time</b> <b>slots</b> to one <b>time</b> <b>slot.</b> In the following section, we formulate problem OP- 2, which is a power minimization problem to find the minimum transmit power that can guarantee the QoS requirements for SUs during τ <b>time</b> <b>slots</b> (τ < T), so as to transform the MAC-layer QoS constraints over T <b>time</b> <b>slots</b> to less <b>time</b> <b>slots.</b>|$|R

3000|$|Note that in GPRS networks, the uplink and {{downlink}} <b>time</b> <b>slot</b> {{numbers are}} separated by three <b>time</b> <b>slots,</b> as shown in Figure 13.
