50|$|Moreover, Nelson and Winter {{expected}} the recent focus on endogenous change in routines when they contended that routine operation is aligned with routinely arising laxity, slippage, rule-breaking, defiance and sabotage. However, ambiguities still arise concerning the intentionality <b>of</b> <b>routines</b> {{and the level}} to their stability and change, where some scholars addressed the behavioural regularities <b>of</b> <b>routines</b> and their habitual nature, specifically bringing forward that they are mindlessly conducted until they are disturbed by an external change.

Many dentists include application of topical fluoride solutions as part <b>of</b> <b>routine</b> cleanings.|$|E

40|$|The notion <b>of</b> <b>routines</b> as {{mechanisms}} for achieving stability {{and change in}} organisations is well established in the organisational theory literature (Becker, 2004). However {{the relationship between the}} dynamics of selection, adaptation and retention and the increase or decrease in the varieties <b>of</b> <b>routines</b> which are the result of these processes, is not as well established theoretically or empirically. This paper investigates the processes associated with the evolution <b>of</b> an inter-organisational <b>routine</b> over time. The paper contributes to theory by advancing a conceptual clarification between the dynamics <b>of</b> organisational <b>routines</b> which produce variation, and the varieties <b>of</b> <b>routines</b> which are generated as a result of such processes; and an explanation for the relationship between selection, adaptation and retention dynamics and the creation of variety.

40|$|Today, {{debugging}} failed {{software upgrades}} {{is a long}} and tedious activity, as developers may have to consider large sections of code to locate the bug. We argue that failed upgrade debugging can be simplified by exploiting the characteristics of upgrade problems to prioritize the set <b>of</b> <b>routines</b> to consider. In particular, previous work has shown that differences between the computing environment in the developer's and users' sites cause most upgrade problems. Based on this observation, we design and implement Sahara, a system that identifies the aspects of the environment that are most likely the culprits of the misbehavior, finds the subset <b>of</b> <b>routines</b> that relate to those aspects, and selects an even smaller subset <b>of</b> <b>routines</b> to debug first. We evaluate Sahara for three real upgrade problems with the OpenSSH suite, one synthetic problem with the SQLite database, and one synthetic problem with the uServer Web server.

He worked on the pram dinghy Nancy Endurance; made a small chest of drawers for Shackleton; {{specimen}} shelves for the biologist, Robert Clark; instrument cases for Leonard Hussey, the meteorologist; and put up wind screens to protect the helmsman. He constructed a false deck, extending from the poop-deck to the chart-room to cover the extra coal that the ship had taken on board. He also acted as the ship's barber. As the ship pushed into the pack ice in the Weddell Sea it became increasingly difficult to navigate. McNish constructed a six-foot wooden semaphore on the bridge to enable the navigating officer to give the helmsman directions, and built a small stage over the stern to allow the propeller to be watched {{in order to keep}} it clear of the heavy ice.|$|E

40|$|This paper elaborates on {{the results}} of a multiple-case study of two {{distinct}} organisations: one in the private and the other in the public sector. We aimed to examine how new HRM policies were enacted in organisations where conventional HRM hiring routines were modified during the enactment process. Questions, how ostensive aspects <b>of</b> <b>routines</b> constrain and/or enable members in this process, and how ostensive aspects <b>of</b> <b>routines</b> are modified and evolve into new routines, guided our research. Results show that in the public organisation ostensive aspects indeed hamper the development of the new HRM routine, but organisational members are keen {{to make use of the}} constrictive aspects <b>of</b> <b>routines</b> to create a better fitting policy. In the private organisation we observed the opposite. Namely, that the lack of ostensive aspects <b>of</b> <b>routines</b> while implementing the new HRM routine, leads to a power play in which roles are defined, responsibilities shifted, and finally lead to novel ostensive aspects that inspire the new routine to work. Our findings indicate that members actively change ostensive aspects <b>of</b> <b>routines</b> by taking initiative, claiming power segments, and behaving proactively to enact the policy, but in different ways depending on how the existing routine was performed in both organisations in the past...|$|R

40|$|Organizational {{routines}} and capabilities have become key constructs in {{fields such as}} organization studies, strategic management, international business, and technology management, as well as certain parts of economics. We discuss the historical origins of the notion <b>of</b> <b>routines</b> and highlight some of the theoretical drift associated with the notion <b>of</b> <b>routines</b> over time. In particular, we note how recent routines-based work has unnecessarily moved the focus (1) from the individual to the collective level, (2) from intentional behavior to unintentional behavior, and (3) from the observable to the non-observable dimension. In parallel we also explicate the underlying theoretical problems of the concept <b>of</b> organizational <b>routines</b> (and associated constructs, such as capabilities); problems such as the lack of conceptual clarity on the origins <b>of</b> <b>routines,</b> and the more general need for microfoundations. We argue that the underlying, individual-level micro-components and interactional dynamics deserve more attention in extant work—calling in effect for a course-correction in work on organizational {{routines and}} capabilities. We highlight how an emphasis on (1) the origins <b>of</b> <b>routines,</b> (2) intentionality and exceptions, and (3) aggregation and emergence, provide opportunities to course-correct future research on organizational routines and capabilities...|$|R
