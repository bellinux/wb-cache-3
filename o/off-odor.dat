40|$|Ionizing {{radiation}} improves {{food safety}} and extends shelf life by inactivating food-borne pathogens and spoilage microorganisms. However, irradiation may induce {{the development of an}} <b>off-odor,</b> particularly at high doses. The <b>off-odor</b> has been called “irradiation odor”. Substantial evidence suggests that volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) {{play an important role in}} the development of the <b>off-odor.</b> These compounds include hydrogen sulfide, methanethiol, methyl sulfide, dimethyl disulfide and dimethyl trisulfide among others. The formation of <b>off-odor</b> and VSCs due to irradiation in meat, and fruit juices is presented. It is known that irradiation exerts its effect through radiolysis of water in foods where water is a dominant component. Irradiation of water produces three primary free radicals: hydroxyl, hydrogen atoms, and hydrated electrons. Use of specific scavengers in a model system revealed that hydroxyl radicals are involved in the formation of VSCs. Possible mechanisms for formation of VSC are also discussed. Also discussed are possible remedies for formation of VSCs and <b>off-odor,</b> such as use of antioxidants and double packaging...|$|E

The research used a completely randomized design with 3 x 3 factorial models, with 3 replicates. The factors were different levels of beluntas (0 %, 1 %, and 2 %) in the ration, and feeding duration of each ration (3, 5, and 7 weeks).

Nonirradiated oil emulsions prepared with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) produced many volatile compounds, but the amounts of volatiles generally decreased after irradiation. Although volatile profiles of fatty acid emulsions were changed by irradiation, the odor characteristics and intensity between irradiated and nonirradiated fatty acid emulsions were not different. Thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) values indicated that irradiation accelerated lipid oxidation during subsequent storage, but the volatiles produced by lipid oxidation were not the major contributors of <b>off-odor</b> in irradiated samples...|$|E

Consumers preferred the color of irradiated raw and cooked meat to nonirradiated meat because the pink color of irradiated meat looked fresher than nonirradiated ones. Packaging method was more important than antioxidant treatment in reducing irradiation <b>off-odor</b> because S-compounds produced by irradiation easily volatilized under aerobic packaging conditions.

40|$|Irradiation {{of ground}} beef under aerobic {{conditions}} oxidized myoglobin and drastically reduced color a*-values. Under vacuum or non-oxygen conditions, however, irradiation did not influence the redness of ground beef. Also, the red color of ground beef was maintained {{even after the}} irradiated beef was exposed to aerobic conditions. Vacuum-packaged irradiated ground beef had lower metmyoglobin content and lower oxidation-reduction potential than the aerobically packaged ones. Irradiating ground beef under vacuum-packaging conditions was also advantageous in preventing lipid oxidation and aldehydes production. Vacuum-packaged irradiated beef, however, produced high levels of sulfur volatiles during irradiation and maintained their levels during storage, {{which resulted in the}} production of characteristic irradiation <b>off-odor.</b> Double-packaging (V 3 /A 3 : vacuum-packaging during irradiation and the first 3 days of storage and then aerobic-packaging for the remaining 3 days) was an effective alternative in maintaining original beef color (red), and minimizing lipid oxidation and irradiation <b>off-odor.</b> The levels of <b>off-odor</b> volatiles in double-packaged irradiated ground beef were comparable to that of aerobically packaged ones, and the degree of lipid oxidation and color changes were close to those of vacuum-packaged ones. Ascorbic acid at 200 ppm level was not effective in preventing color changes and lipid oxidation in irradiated ground beef under aerobic conditions, but was helpful in minimizing quality changes in doublepackaged irradiated ground beef. This suggested that preventing oxygen contact from meat during irradiation and early storage period (V 3 /A 3 double-packaging) and doublepackaging+ascorbic acid combination are excellent strategies to prevent <b>off-odor</b> production and color changes in irradiated ground beef.

40|$|Graduation date: 2006 Sensory {{properties}} of four important volatile sulfur compounds, dimethyl disulfide (DMDS), diethyl disulfide (DEDS), methanethiol (MeSH) and ethanethiol (EtSH), were determined in base Oregon Pinot noir wine {{in order to}} understand their impacts on wine aroma. Detection thresholds of these four compounds in base wine were determined first. All four compounds were found to have very low detection thresholds (in ppb) in base wine. Group thresholds of DMDS ranged from 11. 18 to 23. 57 ppb, those of DEDS ranged from 1. 45 to 2. 16 ppb, those of MeSH ranged from 1. 72 to 1. 82 ppb and those of EtSH ranged from 0. 19 to 0. 23 ppb. Subjects' abilities to detect these compounds in Pinot noir wine were very different. Aroma characteristics of the four compounds as well as their interactions in base wine were profiled via descriptive analysis. Aroma of DMDS in base wine was mainly described as old cabbage and rotten cabbage. DEDS aroma in wine was perceived as skunky, sweaty, and tire-like. Aroma of MeSH in wine was associated with stale vegetables, animal, rubbery, and slop. EtSH aroma in base wine was mainly described as durian, garlic, stale eggs, and natural gas. Odor suppression was observed when two or four sulfur compounds were mixed together in base wine. Perceiving <b>off-odors</b> in base wine was driven by MeSH and EtSH when both MeSH and DMDS or both EtSH and DEDS were present. EtSH affected wine aromas more when both MeSH and EtSH were present in base wine; however, MeSH governed wine <b>off-odors</b> more than EtSH under the influence of subthreshold levels of two disulfides. Mercaptans can significantly affect aroma quality of Oregon Pinot noir wine at very low concentrations (in ppb level); they have a stronger effect than disulfides. Regarding the impacts ofbase wine aromas caused by the four sulfur compounds, base wine lost its fruity and floral character and increased overall intensity, overall stinky, nose burn and sulfur-related odors while concentrations of the four volatile sulfur compounds in base wine increased. Aroma changes of fruity, floral and nose burn can be used by winemakers to diagnose the early presence of volatile sulfur compounds in Oregon Pinot noir wine during winemaking and wine storage...|$|R
