But being bused to Everett {{turned out to be one}} of the best things that ever {{happened}} to me. It got me <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> little world and taught me how to understand white people, how to communicate and deal with them.|$|E
500|$|The {{film has}} grown in popularity. Murray Burnett called it [...] "true yesterday, true today, true tomorrow". By 1955, the film had brought in $6.8 million, making it the third most {{successful}} of Warners' wartime movies (behind Shine On, Harvest Moon and This Is the Army). On April 21, 1957, the Brattle Theater of Cambridge, Massachusetts, showed the film {{as part of a}} season of old movies. It was so popular that it began a tradition of screening Casablanca during the week of final exams at Harvard University, which continues to the present day. Other colleges have adopted the tradition. Todd Gitlin, a professor of sociology who had attended one of these screenings, has said that the experience was [...] "the acting <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> personal rite of passage". The tradition helped the movie remain popular while other films famous in the 1940s have faded from popular memory. By 1977, Casablanca was the most frequently broadcast film on American television.|$|E

[...] It's going to be as if you're walking into New York circa 1974: There's an art installation in the lobby, a DJ spinning your favorite records in the main room, and then the most haunting performance that you've ever seen on the stage. [...] I'm on the phone every minute of every day, talking to people, being creative, planning this Ball, and my tour manager is constantly saying, 'Come on, we have to go, we've got to go right now,' [...] But to me, the Ball is so important.

2500|$|Moreover, [...] "Fear and Loathing", as a phrase, {{has been}} used by many writers, the first (possibly) being Friedrich Nietzsche in The Antichrist. In a Rolling Stone {{magazine}} interview, Thompson said: [...] "It came <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> sense of fear, and [...] a perfect description of that situation to me, however, I have been accused of stealing it from Nietzsche or Kafka or something.

Under that banner, Hanson again contested one of Queensland's {{seats in}} the Senate in the 2007 federal election, when she received over 4 percent of total votes. The party name invokes that of the historic United Australia Party. Speaking on her return to politics, she stated: [...] "I have had all the major political parties attack me, been kicked <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> party {{and ended up in}} prison, but I don't give up."

A verbal exchange had taken place after three lifesavers approached a group of four young Lebanese men on Cronulla Beach with both groups accusing the other of staring at them. One of the Lebanese men reportedly responded to the accusations, [...] "I'm allowed to; now fuck off and leave our beach", to which a lifesaver responded, [...] "I come down here <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> spare time to save you dumb cunts from drowning; now piss off, you scum".|$|E
2500|$|After the Second war of Schleswig between Denmark and Prussia {{ended in}} 1864, Swedish volunteers {{coming back from}} Denmark {{wanted to go to}} America and {{continue}} fighting there in the American Civil War. Thomas solved this problem without asking his government for directions. He arranged with the captains of the Hamburg steamers to take these soldiers across the ocean at half price, and together with some friends he [...] "made up a little purse" [...] with which they could be sent to Hamburg. [...] "I am well aware," [...] he reported to the U.S. Department of State, [...] "that as consul I can {{have nothing to do with}} enlisting soldiers, but no international law can prevent me from paying a soldier's passage from here to Hamburg <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> pocket." [...] In the course of the following winter Thomas induced more Swedish soldiers to go to America.|$|E
2500|$|Hughes {{was accused}} of being a Communist by many on the {{political}} right, but he always denied it. When asked why he never joined the Communist Party, he wrote, [...] "it was based on strict discipline and the acceptance of directives that I, as a writer, did not wish to accept." [...] In 1953, he was called before the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations led by Senator Joseph McCarthy. He stated, [...] "I never read the theoretical books of socialism or communism or the Democratic or Republican parties for that matter, and so my interest in whatever may be considered political has been non-theoretical, non-sectarian, and largely emotional and born <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> need to find some way of thinking about this whole problem of myself." [...] Following his testimony, Hughes distanced himself from Communism. He was rebuked by some on the Radical Left who had previously supported him. He moved away from overtly political poems and towards more lyric subjects. When selecting his poetry for his Selected Poems (1959) he excluded all his radical socialist verse from the 1930s.|$|E

I begin by reflecting on what we might learn from studies of biological evolution about the importance of narrative and qualitative observation in analysis of the factors behind and consequences of firm differences. Then, I turn to commentary and criticism of what I think has been the dominant point of view (certain authors clearly are exceptions) orienting the studies of firm differences and industrial dynamics using the available longitudinal industry-firm data sets.

I think it may be based on the archetype of the puer, or Eternal Boy. I hooked up the puer with Narcissus and I got a pool of water. And inside the pool of water is the exact opposite of the fine sensitive boy. The dark side of the fine puer who wants to be pulled down to the darkest place and have his asshole ravished by the hairy beast.
