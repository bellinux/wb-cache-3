5|$|A single {{disassembled}} de Havilland DH.60 Moth floatplane was {{stored in}} the aircraft hold between the forward superstructure and the mainmast. Its components would be moved from the hold by the aircraft crane to the after deck where it could be assembled. Then the aircraft would be swayed <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> where it could be launched.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of her career, over thirty {{aircraft}} were either lost or heavily damaged while operating from Melbourne. The majority of the aircraft ditched or crashed <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>side,</b> but some losses were due to catapult or arrestor cable failures. After Melbourne was decommissioned, the Fleet Air Arm ceased fixed-wing combat aircraft operation in 1984, with the final Tracker flight saluting the decommissioned carrier.|$|E
5|$|Ten {{minutes after}} the first impact, the engines still turning astern, the ship struck again beneath the engine room, tearing open her bottom. She {{instantly}} broke in two just aft of the mainmast. The funnel went <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> and the forepart of the ship sank at once. The stern section, now crowded with men, floated {{for a few minutes}} before sinking.|$|E
5000|$|A1 {{is formed}} by the apices of the {{isosceles}} triangles with apex angle 2π/3 erected <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> of <b>the</b> triangle A0. The vertices of A1 are the centers of equilateral triangles erected <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> of triangle A0. Thus the specialisation of the PDN theorem to a triangle can be formulated as follows: ...|$|R
50|$|If {{equilateral}} triangles are erected <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> of any triangle, {{then the}} triangle {{formed by the}} centers of the three equilateral triangles is equilateral.|$|R

5|$|Exact {{details of}} her death {{eventually}} came to light; she boarded a packed boat with 70 other people {{in an attempt to}} cross the Mediterranean Sea and reach Italy. The boat soon ran out of petrol and was adrift off the coast of Libya. When an Italian Navy vessel arrived to offer assistance, it threw ropes <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> to the refugees. In the chaos that ensued as people attempting to grab the ropes, Omar was knocked into the sea, where witnesses saw her treading water for a while, but eventually drowned.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} period, {{different}} helms {{began to be}} used for different ranks: sovereigns' and knights' helms faced forwards (affronté), whereas those of peers and gentlemen faced to the right (dexter). In the medieval period crests would always have faced {{the same way as the}} helm, but as a result of these rules, the directions of the crest and the helm might be at variance: a knight whose crest was a lion statant, would have the lion depicted as looking <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of the helm, rather than towards the viewer. Torses also suffered artistically, being treated not as silken circlets, but as horizontal bars.|$|E
5|$|Losing {{power and}} speed, Roma {{began to fall}} out of the battle group. Around 16:02, another Fritz X slammed into the {{starboard}} side of Romas deck, between frames 123 and 136. It most likely detonated in the forward engine room, sparking flames, and causing heavy flooding in the magazines of main battery turret number two and the fore port side secondary battery turret, and putting even more pressure upon the previously stressed hull girder. Seconds after the initial blast, the number two 15-inch turret was blown <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> by a massive explosion, this time from the detonation of that turret's magazines.|$|E
60|$|Even {{above the}} noise of the storm, a loud cry was heard, and the crash of {{breaking}} timber as, with the shock, the main and mizzen masts, weakened by the loss of <b>the</b> foremast, went <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides.</b> <b>The</b> next great wave drove the vessel forward two or three fathoms.|$|R
50|$|The {{centers of}} regular n-gons {{constructed}} <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> of an n-gon P form a regular n-gon if {{and only if}} P is an afﬁne image of a regular n-gon.|$|R
50|$|On 17 November 2011, Samsung {{released}} {{a new version}} of the Galaxy Tab called Galaxy Tab 10.1N. The new device now has the metal frame extending <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> and repositioned speakers.|$|R
5|$|Milhouse rolls <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of the treehouse, but Bart catches him precariously by his sleeve. When a gale of wind {{takes hold}} of the comic so that it flies towards the treehouse's {{entrance}}, Bart is forced to decide between it and Milhouse. After mulling over his options, Bart chooses Milhouse and pulls him up into the treehouse. The comic flies out the entrance and is shredded by Santa's Little Helper on the ground, hit by lightning, and completely destroyed. The next morning, the three boys reflect on how their inability to share led {{to the destruction of}} the comic, although Bart, has forgotten the experience.|$|E
5|$|On 21 September, Nightstalkers flying MH-60 and Little Birds {{took off}} from the frigate USS Jarrett to track an Iranian ship, Iran Ajr. The Nightstalkers {{observed}} Iran Ajr turn off her lights and begin laying mines. After receiving permission to attack, the helicopters fired guns and rockets, stopping the ship. As Iran Ajrs crew began to push mines <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>side,</b> the helicopters resumed firing until the crew abandoned ship. Special Boat Teams provided security while a SEAL team boarded the vessel at first light and discovered nine mines on the vessel's deck, {{as well as a}} logbook revealing areas where previous mines had been laid. The logbook implicated Iran in mining international waters.|$|E
5|$|The Mersea Week is {{a week-long}} August festival of boat racing {{organised}} by the West Mersea Yacht Club and Dabchicks Sailing Club, established in 1973. During the week, starting on Monday, there are races for many boat {{classes in the}} Blackwater Estuary, from Optimist dinghies to large yachts. The most celebrated event is the Round-the-Island race, where dinghies attempt to sail round the island in either direction, helped over the Strood by volunteers. On Saturday, there is a regatta at West Mersea, followed by a selection of water sports and a firework display at dusk. One of the popular events on Saturday is walking a greasy pole rigged <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of the hosting Thames sailing barge.|$|E
50|$|Angiofibromas are small, reddish {{brown or}} even flesh-colored, smooth, shiny, 0.1- to 0.3 cm papules present <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> of <b>the</b> nose and the medial {{portions}} of the cheeks. They contain fibrous tissue.|$|R

50|$|A central {{consonant}} is a consonant {{sound that}} is produced when air flows across {{the center of}} <b>the</b> mouth <b>over</b> <b>the</b> tongue. The class contrasts with lateral consonants, in which air flows <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> of <b>the</b> tongue rather than down its center.|$|R
5|$|A {{key feature}} of the F-16's cockpit is the {{exceptional}} field of view. The single-piece, bird-proof polycarbonate bubble canopy provides 360° all-round visibility, with a 40° look-down angle <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of the aircraft, and 15° down over the nose (compared to the common 12–13° of preceding aircraft); the pilot's seat is elevated for this purpose. Furthermore, the F-16's canopy lacks the forward bow frame found on many fighters, which is an obstruction to a pilot's forward vision. The F-16's ACES II zero/zero ejection seat is reclined at an unusual tilt-back angle of 30°; most fighters have a tilted seat at 13–15°. The tilted seat can accommodate taller pilots and increases G-force tolerance; however it {{has been associated with}} reports of neck ache, possibly caused by incorrect head-rest usage. Subsequent U.S. fighters have adopted more modest tilt-back angles of 20°. Due to the seat angle and the canopy's thickness, the ejection seat lacks canopy-breakers for emergency egress; instead the entire canopy is jettisoned prior to the seat's rocket firing.|$|E
5|$|After seeing {{success with}} the mouse using lizard DNA, Ratha demands Connors begin human trials immediately. Connors refuses to rush the drug-testing {{procedure}} and put innocent people at risk. Ratha fires Connors and decides to test Connors' serum at a Veterans Administration hospital {{under the guise of}} a flu shot. In an act of desperation, Connors tries the formula on himself. After passing out, he awakens to find his missing arm has regenerated. Discovering that Ratha {{is on his way to}} the VA hospital, Connors, whose skin is turning green and scaly, goes to intercept him. By the time he gets to the Williamsburg Bridge, Connors has become a violent hybrid of lizard and man, tossing cars, including Ratha's, <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>side.</b> Peter, now calling himself Spider-Man, snatches each falling car with his web-lines.|$|E
5|$|Afterwards, {{the ship}} {{returned}} to the UK to ferry 801 Squadron to Gibraltar and delivered the unit on 7 June. Together with Eagle, Argus was tasked to provide air cover over Force H as it covered a convoy attempting to get desperately needed supplies through to Malta later in June (Operation Harpoon). The carrier embarked two Fulmars from 807 Squadron, nine Swordfish from 813 Squadron and four more Swordfish from 824 Squadron to protect the convoy from submarines while Eagle loaded 20 Fulmars and Sea Hurricanes from three different squadrons. One Swordfish crashed while landing on 13 June and the wreckage was pushed <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>side.</b> Both Fulmars from 807 Squadron were shot down on 14 June by Italian bombers, but they likely shot down one Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 and one CANT Z.1007 bomber. Eagle transferred her Fulmars to Argus {{over the course of}} the battle and two more were lost later in the day. The ship was attacked multiple times by bombs and torpedoes during the battle without effect.|$|E
5000|$|...Well deck" [...] means {{a weather}} deck fitted with solid bulwarks that impede the {{drainage}} of water <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> or an exposed recess {{in the weather}} deck extending 1/2 {{or more of the}} length of <b>the</b> vessel <b>over</b> <b>the</b> weather deck".|$|R
5000|$|Some flying bridges have [...] "bridge wings", open areas which thrust {{outward from}} <b>the</b> flying bridge <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> of <b>the</b> vessel by {{approximately}} 10 to 15 ft to allow an officer to see <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of his ship while docking or working with smaller vessels.|$|R
50|$|P. pygmaea have dark spots, {{which forms}} 4 cross-bands, <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> of its body. The bases of the fins are heavily pigmented, {{except for the}} ventral fins. It has 22 to 25 scales in {{longitudinal}} series.|$|R
5|$|At 06:00, {{a breeze}} pushed Boadicea forward {{and she began}} to close with her former consort, Rowley {{watching}} as all three of Africaines masts gave way and collapsed <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> one by one. By 08:00, Africaine was a dismasted hull and Corbet was dead {{in the bowels of the}} ship, although the exact manner of his death was to cause lasting controversy. By 10:00, Boadicea had been joined by Otter and Staunch and bore down on the French ships and their prize, so that by 15:30 Bouvet was persuaded to abandon Africaine and tow the damaged Iphigénie back to Port Napoleon. By 17:00, Boadicea pulled alongside Africaine and the French prize crew surrendered. Rowley later reported that a number of British sailors leaped into the sea at his approach and swam to Boadicea, requesting that they be allowed to pursue the French ships in the hope of capturing one.|$|E
5|$|Furious was {{assigned}} to the Atlantic Fleet after commissioning in 1925 although she spent much of the next several years conducting trials for practically every aircraft in the Fleet Air Arm (FAA) inventory. These included landing and flying-off tests of Fairey IIID and Fairey Flycatcher floatplanes, with and without wheels, to compare various designs of wooden and metal floats. The lower flight deck was greased to allow them to take off with a minimum of difficulty. A Flycatcher fitted with wooden skids was also tested and behaved perfectly satisfactorily. The arresting gear was barely used during these trials and it was removed shortly afterwards. Deck-edge palisades were installed in 1927 to keep aircraft from blowing <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> in rough weather. The first carrier night-landing was made by a Blackburn Dart on 6 May 1926 aboard Furious. In the 1920s, the ship commonly carried one flight of fighters (Fairey Flycatcher), two of spotters (Blackburn Blackburn or Avro Bison), one spotter reconnaissance (Fairey IIID) and two flights of torpedo bombers (Blackburn Dart), each usually of six aircraft.|$|E

5|$|His pale, heavy-boned face {{showed signs}} of sleeplessness. His strong body was bulging <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> of <b>the</b> seat; his legs were spread wide <b>over</b> <b>the</b> pale, rose-colored velvet carpet. There was a little cup of black coffee, absurdly delicate, beside his gnarled work-warped hand.|$|R

5|$|In 1648, the {{relatively}} brief Second English Civil War broke out, and Rupert informed the French King {{that he would}} be returning to King Charles' service. The Parliamentary navy mutinied in favour of the King and sailed for Holland, providing the Royalists with a major fleet {{for the first time since}} the start of the civil conflict; Rupert joined the fleet under the command of the Duke of York, who assumed the rank of Lord High Admiral. Rupert argued that the fleet should be used to rescue the King, then being held prisoner on the Isle of Wight, while others advised sailing in support of the fighting in the north. The fleet itself rapidly lost discipline, with many vessels' crews focussing on seizing local ships and cargoes. This underlined a major problem for the Royalists—the cost of maintaining the new fleet was well beyond their means. Discipline continued to deteriorate, and Rupert had to intervene personally several times, including defusing one group of mutinous sailors by suddenly dangling the ringleader <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of his vessel and threatening to drop him into the sea. Most of the fleet finally switched sides once more, returning to England in late 1648.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} morning of 29 November 1877, heavy rain caused the dam of the Rhodgeidio mill near Llanerchymedd to breach, and the surge of water washed away the wooden Caemawr bridge over the Afon Alaw. The first train {{of the day was}} driven by William Taylor, with fireman John Saunders and railway {{inspector}} John Davies also on the footplate. The train also included two coal trucks, a passenger coach, and a guard's van, with Edward Hughes serving as the guard. The whole train went <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of the bridge into the river. Edward Hughes dragged himself out, and was taken to the nearest farm. John Davies was scalded to death, and Taylor and Saunders were found injured, and could not be freed until mid-day. John Saunders later died from his injuries.|$|E
5|$|Joan Young, who was {{the only}} {{first-hand}} witness, is challenged in both articles. She came forward in 2004, claiming {{that she had seen}} someone push something <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of a boat on Coniston Water. This testimony is challenged, because so much time has passed and the fact that her husband saw nothing. However, he claims to have been reading his paper at the time. Also, {{it has been said that}} Young was too far away to identify the person in the boat, and that it couldn't have been Carol Park's body that was being dumped, as the Youngs were positioned so that the location Carol's body was found would have been visibly blocked by an island. The article even points out that Young described a boat that appeared to be a cruiser yacht. Despite the fact that Gordon did own a large yacht in 1997, in 1976 he owned only a 505 racing dinghy, which he sold later that year.|$|E
