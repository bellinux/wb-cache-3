5|$|Ten Dollar Bill (also {{referred}} to as The Dollar Bill) is a 1956 proto-pop art lithographic drawing by Roy Lichtenstein. Considered to be a combination <b>of</b> <b>Americana</b> art and cubism, the work is {{referred to}} as the beginning to Lichtenstein's work on pop art. Twenty-five editions of the lithograph were made by Lichtenstein, which were exhibited at several galleries. The piece is based on the design for the ten-dollar bill and has influenced several of Lichtenstein's later works. The picture has received generally favorable reception from critics, and is considered to be one of the best artistic portrayals of currency.|$|E

In particular, the early work of Norman Rockwell for the Saturday Evening Post bears a strong superficial resemblance to that of Leyendecker. While today it is generally accepted that Norman Rockwell established the best-known visual images <b>of</b> <b>Americana,</b> {{in many cases they}} are derivative of Leyendecker's work, or reinterpretations of visual themes established by Rockwell's idol.|$|E

Results {{of the present}} study showed that the aqueous methanolic extract of aerial parts <b>of</b> P. <b>americana</b> produced a statistically significant increase in pain threshold after 30 min, in comparison with the control, at adose of 190 mg kg- 1 (P 0. 05). The anti-nociceptive activity <b>of</b> P. <b>americana</b> increased until the 60 th min (P < 0. 05 compared to morphine).

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to investigate the antioxidant activities <b>of</b> Persea <b>americana</b> and Cnidosculous aconitifolius. The in-vitro antioxidant activity of the methanol extracts of the leaves <b>of</b> Persea <b>americana</b> and Cnidosculous aconitifolius was evaluated using various experimental methods such as 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH), nitric oxide and reducing power radical- scavenging activity assay. Phytochemical screening {{as well as the}} amounts of total phenol and flavonoids were also determined. The present study revealed that both the methanol extracts of the leaves <b>of</b> Persea <b>americana</b> and Cnidosculous aconitifolius possess significant antioxidant activities. However, Persea americana was found to have higher radical scavenging activity than Cnidosculous aconitifolius but the phenol content of Cnidosculous aconitifolius was higher than that <b>of</b> Persea <b>americana</b> whereas Persea americana was observed to possess more flavonoids than Cnidosculous aconitifolius...|$|R

It was included in the Library of Congress' National Recording Registry in 2009.|$|E
25|$|That same year, Atkins {{moved to}} the {{neighborhood}} of Bensonhurst in Brooklyn, New York. Influenced by the artists signed to independent label Rainbow Quartz, she strayed from the louder rock music she’d played in North Carolina and moved toward the songcraft style of Wilco and Roy Orbison. She returned to Charlotte and played with several bands, most notably a group called Virginia Reel. At this time, she started writing what she termed “a mix <b>of</b> <b>Americana,</b> 60s, and indie rock.” She also recorded her EP Bleeding Diamonds.|$|E
25|$|As a {{facet of}} culture {{throughout}} most of the 20th century, Scouting has been portrayed in numerous films and artwork. It is especially prevalent in the United States, where Scouting is tied closely to the ideal <b>of</b> <b>Americana.</b> The works of painters Norman Rockwell and Joseph Csatari and the 1966 film Follow Me, Boys! are prime examples of this idealized American ethos. One of the earliest depictions of Scouting in the entertainment media is a 1908 British silent film Scouts to the Rescue, shown in nickelodeons. Produced by Williamson Kinematograph, it depicted Boy Scouts tracking a gang of kidnappers through the woods to rescue an abducted baby.|$|E

25|$|Gershwin's all-black opera {{was also}} unpopular with some celebrated black artists. Harry Belafonte {{declined}} to play Porgy {{in the late}} 1950s film version, so the role went to Sidney Poitier. Betty Allen, president of The Harlem School of the Arts, admittedly loathed the piece, and Grace Bumbry, who excelled in the 1985 Metropolitan Opera production as Bess, made the often cited statement: I thought it beneath me, I felt I had worked far too hard, that we had come far too far to have to retrogress to 1935. My {{way of dealing with}} it was to see that it was really a piece <b>of</b> <b>Americana,</b> of American history, whether we liked it or not. Whether I sing it or not, it was still going to be there.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{received}} poorly {{and failed to}} chart or improve Powderfinger's platform despite the respectable success of its predecessor, Transfusion. Critics complained about its poor imitation <b>of</b> <b>Americana</b> and grunge, {{as well as its}} overuse of complex riffs. In a 2004 interview, Powderfinger lead singer Bernard Fanning said, in reference to the album, [...] "God knows what we were on then." [...] Three singles were released from the album, all of which failed to chart.|$|E
500|$|The {{game had}} a lengthy {{development}} period that spanned five years. Its making involved {{a number of}} Japanese luminaries, including writer Shigesato Itoi, musician/songwriter Keiichi Suzuki, sound designer Hirokazu Tanaka, and future Nintendo president Satoru Iwata. Themed around an idiosyncratic portrayal <b>of</b> <b>Americana</b> and Western culture, it subverted popular role-playing game traditions by featuring a real world setting while parodying numerous staples of the genre. Itoi, who directed the game, wanted it to reach non-gamers with its intentionally goofy tone. Upon release, it was heavily marketed with a promotional campaign that sardonically proclaimed [...] "this game stinks".|$|E

500|$|As the Varner–Hogg {{restoration}} {{wound to}} a halt, Hogg refocused her attention on her Houston home, Bayou Bend, which housed {{some of her}} personal collection of antiques and artwork. The New York Times described her [...] "superb Early American furniture" [...] collection in 1953, {{and she had a}} large collection <b>of</b> <b>Americana</b> and colonial Mexican decorative arts, some of which are still in the house. In the late 1950s she said: [...] "I had been collecting American furniture. I collected, and collected, and collected, until I had so much of it I didn't {{know what to do with}} it. I decided to give it to a museum." [...] She collaborated with the original architect John Staub on structural changes that would prepare the home to be a museum. She denuded the home of personal items and items that did not meet her concept; the only piece of non-American furniture in the home was her English dining table, which had too many memories for her to remove it.|$|E
500|$|Following its {{premature}} release on the Web, the music video for [...] "You and I" [...] met with positive reviews.

[...] Jillian Mapes of Billboard wrote the video has: [...] "torture contraptions, mermaid sex, a wedding, bondage in a barn, an ice cream truck, and to top it all off, 'Children of the Corn' and religious overtones thrown in for good measure," [...] and thought [...] the video setting was the strangest representation of Nebraska. Leah Collins of Dose felt the video was a [...] "great opportunity for the singer to finally find out what it's like to make out with herself." [...] Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly noted of the scene in which Gaga plays a piano in a cornfield beside her male alter ego: [...] "She's just Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta, playing a piano {{in the middle of}} a corn field—with a little making out on the side, of course." [...] Gil Kaufman of MTV News believed that Gaga was not joking when she talked about the video being about the [...] "torture" [...] of being away from the one you love. [...] "And, man, based on the bruising final product, she wasn't kidding," [...] Kaufman concluded.|$|E
