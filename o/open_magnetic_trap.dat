40|$|In {{the next}} future the {{development}} of ECR (Electron Cyclotron Resonance) ion sources with higher performances superconducting magnets will open new fields of investigation. Following the Geller’s scaling laws [1] and the High B mode concept [2], the ECRIS evolution during these years has been stable and it led {{to an increase in}} terms of high charge states current of about one order of magnitude per decade. The main goal of the most performing sources, actually in commissioning or in construction phase, is to get milliamperes currents of highly charged heavy ions. These performances require the use of high confinement magnetic fields, together with a proper power rate and higher frequencies microwaves. It involves several technological problems, included those related to the large power requirements and to the consequent high heating of the plasma source chamber [3]. In order to have a better insight about the phenomena involving ECR heating in the superconducting source of INFN-LNS in Catania the “Classical Model of Ion Confinement and Losses ” [4, 5], based on the balance equations and on the charged particle confinement in the <b>open</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>trap</b> has been applied with some improvements and modifications.

40|$|Research in {{the field}} of cold polar {{molecules}} is progressing rapidly. An array of interesting topics is being developed including precision measurement and fundamental tests, quantum phase transitions, and ultracold chemistry. In particular, dipolar molecules in well-defined quantum states enable exquisite control of their interactions via applied electric fields. The long-range, anisotropic interaction between dipolar molecules leads to new collision dynamics {{that could be used for}} novel collective effects, quantum state engineering, and information processing. The focus of this Thesis is the production of cold samples of neutral OH molecules via Stark deceleration and magnetic trapping for novel collision experiments. This novelty results from our combination of cold external beams and trapped target molecules which facilitates observation of dipolar effects as well as low temperature collision resonances. The large permanent electric dipole moment of OH allows us to precisely tune the lab-frame velocity of the molecular packets from ∼ 500 m/s to rest. We have magnetically trapped OH packets at the terminus of our Stark decelerator at a temperature of 70 mK and density of 106 cm− 3. With improved understanding of Stark deceleration, we optimize the decelerator efficiency and its coupling to the magnetic trap. Our latest trap design uses permanent ring magnets to create a three-dimensional magnetic quadrupole field. Use of magnetically trapped OH molecules for collision experiments with external beams allow us the unique opportunity of observing both elastic and inelastic collisions. In addition, the trap confinement yields sensitivity to differential elastic cross sections at low collision energies. This <b>open</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>trap</b> has allowed measurement of collision cross sections between trapped OH and external supersonic beams of He and D 2, the latter of which is of astrophysical interest due to the role of H 2 -OH collisions in pumping interstellar OH megamasers. The combination of trapped OH molecules and temperature tuned beams of He and D 2 has facilitated measurement of the lowest-energy D 2 -OH collision cross sections yet reported. More recently, we report the first observation of electric-field dependent cross sections between two different species of cold polar molecules - OH and ND 3 - thereby demonstrating control over molecular scattering in the cold regime. By combining for the first time the production techniques of Stark deceleration and buffer gas cooling, we increase the molecular interaction time by∼ 105 over traditional crossed-beam experiments to gain enhanced sensitivity at the characteristic densities of cold molecule production...|$|E

40|$|We present {{studies on}} the {{modifications}} in temperature, number density and phase-space density when a laser cooled atom cloud from the optical molasses is trapped in a quadrupole <b>magnetic</b> <b>trap.</b> Theoretically it is shown that for a given temperature {{and size of the}} cloud from the molasses, the phase-space density in the <b>magnetic</b> <b>trap</b> first increases with magnetic field gradient and then decreases with it, after attaining a maximum value at an optimum value of magnetic field gradient. The experimentally measured variation in phase-space density in the <b>magnetic</b> <b>trap</b> with the <b>magnetic</b> field gradient has shown the similar trend. However, the experimentally measured values of number density and phase-space density are much lower than their theoretically predicted values.

40|$|Quantum effects at {{motion of}} ultracold {{neutrons}} in a <b>magnetic</b> <b>trap</b> are actively studied now. In particular, ”magnetic tube” traps [1] {{are used for}} investigation of such effects. According to [1], the periodic set of <b>magnetic</b> <b>traps</b> can be developed. Traps {{in the form of}} ”magnetic tube ” are used for focusing of atomic beams and described in details in [2] {{on the basis of the}} classic motion equations for a particle, possessing the magnetic moment, in a magnetic field. But quantum effects, which appear at neutron motion in the <b>magnetic</b> <b>trap,</b> can not be described by classic motion equations. The typical radius of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>trap,</b> which is being designed, is ρ ∼ 10 − 4 cm [1]. Thus, due to large wavelength (λ ∼ 10 − 5 ÷ 10 − 6 cm), motion of the ultracold neutron in the <b>magnetic</b> <b>trap</b> in the direction, transversal to the axis of the magnetic tube, appears quantized. 1 Quantum effects were studied for neutron motion in a gravitational trap [3]. Neutron motion in such a trap is one-dimensional. But in contrast to [3], transversal motion of neutrons in the ”magnetic tube ” trap with respect to it axes is two-dimensional. As noted below, neutron motion in such a trap is determined by spinindependent effective potential energy, which is proportional to the magnetic field strength square. Thus, let us consider motion of the ultracold neutrons in the tubeshaped <b>magnetic</b> <b>trap.</b> The Schrödinger equation, which describes the ultracold neutron in such a trap, is as follows...|$|R
