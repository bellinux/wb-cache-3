Focusing on the {{phenomenon}} that many {{office buildings and}} student apartments in northern China with vertical single tube series heating systems are of high energy consumption and waste lots of thermal energy because of lacking heating regulation, this paper proposed a system of <b>on-off</b> <b>regulation</b> to optimize the regulation, where on-off values are installed in each vertical riser, indoor temperature controllers are installed {{in the room with}} lower temperature, and the on-off values control circulating water automatically according to the difference between the real temperature and the set temperature and finally the indoor temperatures are controlled. The temperature control effect and energy saving effect of this system were discussed in both simulation and measurement. The conclusion shows that: 1) the proposed system can optimize heating regulation and reduce the loss cause of heating non-uniformity. 2) the on-off control on the flow of single vertical tube makes temperature of all rooms stringed in the riser meet the requirements. 3) the indoor temperature differences in the same riser are controlled in 2 °C. 4) in practical, user’s on-time is only 50 % of total time through <b>on-off</b> <b>regulation,</b> the effect of energy saving is significant...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the new control method {{developed}} for the pressure sewer systems. This method eliminates the disadvantages of currently common used <b>on-off</b> <b>regulation.</b> The major disadvantage is a transition of inconstancies of the effluent production into the sewage system. The propose method is primarily {{based on the principle}} of an allocation of the drawing off into the given time slots. This control method is further improved by the extended modules provide higher level of the optimization (learning mode and emergent drawing off). Proposed method is able to decrease of the standard deviation of pumping even by 80 %. Comment: 6 page...|$|E
40|$|The precise {{manipulation}} of growth factor signaling {{is central to}} the progress of tissue engineering. Methods for direct time-resolved activation of signaling pathways through controlled receptor dimerization have been reported; however, these suffer from the risks associated with gene transfer. Here we present an alternative gene transfer-free approach {{in the form of a}} protein switch featuring pharmacologically controlled <b>ON-OFF</b> <b>regulation</b> of growth factor activity. The reversible operation of the switch enables stimulation of target processes within a defined period of time. The protein switch provides a means for both studying and manipulating signaling processes, and is thus believed to be a valuable tool for basic research as well as tissue engineering and biomedical applications...|$|E
3000|$|The {{information}} {{gained by}} deep sequencing of small RNA populations revealed dynamic alterations in {{the expression of}} an important number of rice miRNAs in response to infection by the rice blast fungus M. oryzae or treatment with elicitors prepared from this fungus (Campo et al. 2013; Li et al. 2013; Baldrich et al. 2015). Because miRNAs provide the quantitative regulation of target gene expression, rather than <b>on-off</b> <b>regulations,</b> the observed dynamic responses on miRNA accumulation during pathogen infection would provide the fine-tuning of gene expression in physiological processes contributing to disease resistance. Deep sequencing of the sRNA transcriptomes also allowed the confident identification of previously unknown miRNAs whose expression is regulated by treatment with M. oryzae elicitors in rice (Campo et al. 2013; Baldrich et al. 2015). Combined sRNA and degradome analysis revealed the existence of regulatory networks enriched in elicitor-responsive rice miRNAs supported by the identification of their corresponding target genes, such as those associated with hormone signalling and crosstalk between defence-related hormones (ET, SA, JA, auxin) and polyamine biosynthesis. An important number of miRNAs that are regulated by M. oryzae elicitors {{are known to be}} involved in small RNA pathways, including miRNA and heterochromatic pathways. Among them are miR 162 and miR 168 (targeting DCL 1 and AGO 1 transcripts, respectively), this observation pointing to a pathogen-regulation of the miRNA machinery itself (Baldrich et al. 2015). Moreover, silencing of dcl 1 has been shown to {{have a positive impact on}} resistance to M. oryzae infection through the activation of basal defence mechanisms (Zhang et al. 2015). In Arabidopsis, however, a phenotype of susceptibility to infection by P. syringae is observed in dcl 1 mutants (Navarro et al. 2008). Thus, differences in the outcome of the interaction in loss-of-function mutants of dcl 1 might be dependent on the host (rice, Arabidopsis) and/or the type of pathogen (fungi, bacteria) [...].|$|R
40|$|In D. melanogaster {{the binary}} switch gene Sex-lethal (Sxl) plays {{a pivotal role}} in somatic sex {{determination}} [...] when the Sxl gene is on the female pathway is followed, while the male pathway is followed when the gene is off. In the present study we have asked whether the Sxl gene is present in other species of the genus Drosophila and whether it is subject to a similar sex-specific <b>on-off</b> <b>regulation.</b> Sxl proteins were found in all of the drosophilids examined, and they display a sex-specific pattern of expression. Furthermore, characterization of the Sxl gene in the distant drosophilan relative, D. virilis, reveals that the structure and sequence organization of the gene has been well conserved and that, like melanogaster, alternative RNA processing is responsible for its sex-specific expression. Hence, this posttranscriptional on-off regulatory mechanism probably existed before the separation of the drosophilan and sophophoran subgenera and it seems likely that Sxl functions as a sex determination switch gene in most species in the Drosophila genus. Although alternative splicing appears to be responsible for the <b>on-off</b> <b>regulation</b> of the Sxl gene in D. virilis, this species is unusual in that Sxl proteins are present not only in females but also in males. The D. virilis female and male proteins appear to be identical over most of the length except for the amino-terminal approx. 25 aa which are encoded by the differentially spliced exons. In transcriptionally active polytene chromosomes, the male and female proteins bind to the same cytogenetic loci, including the sites corresponding to the D. virilis Sxl and tra genes. Hence, though the male proteins are able to interact with appropriate target pre-mRNAs, they are apparently incapable of altering the splicing pattern of these pre-mRNAs...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{presents}} {{a solution for}} automatic control of a paint spray booth with integrated dryer. The conditions in the booth must be as constant as possible to assure better quality of surface coating applied on a particular object, while also lowering the consumption of energy sources and improving the working environment. The thesis includes descriptions of physical elements used for control and regulation, the software solution, which includes algorithms for the regulation of the temperature, overpressure in the booth and airflow, {{as well as the}} user interface. Also included is the description of on-off and PID closed-loop control systems, which were implemented and compared. The control program is written in C# and runs on a PC. A touch screen display is used as the user input output device.

40|$|Objective(s) Physiological {{changes in}} the body may be {{utilized}} as potential triggers for controlled drug delivery. Based on these mechanisms, stimulus–responsive drug delivery has been developed. Materials and MethodsIn this study, a kind of poly (N-isopropylacrylamide-acrylamide) membrane was prepared by radical copolymerization. Changes in swelling ratios and diameters of the membrane were investigated in terms of temperature. <b>On-off</b> <b>regulation</b> of drug permeation through the membrane was then studied at temperatures below and above the phase transition temperature of the membrane. Two drugs, vitamin B 12 and acetaminophen were chosen as models {{of high and low}} molecular weights here, respectively. ResultsIt was indicated that at temperatures below the phase transition temperature of the membrane, copolymer was in a swollen state. Above the phase transition temperature, water was partially expelled from the functional groups of the copolymer. Permeation of high molecular weight drug models such as vitamin B 12 was shown to be much more distinct at temperatures below the phase transition temperature when the copolymer was in a swollen state. At higher temperatures when the copolymer was shrunken, drug permeation through the membrane was substantially decreased. However for acetaminophen, such a big change in drug permeation around the phase transition temperature of the membrane was not observed. ConclusionAccording to the pore mechanism of drug transport through hydrogels, permeability of solutes decreased with increasing molecular size. As a result, the relative permeability, around the phase transition temperature of the copolymer, was higher for solutes of high molecular weight...|$|E
40|$|Stepwise {{acquisition}} of oncogene mutations and deletion/inactivation of tumor suppressor genes characterize {{the development of}} colorectal cancer (CRC). These genetic events interact with discrete morphologic transitions from hyperplastic mucosa to adenomatous areas, followed by in situ malignant transformation and finally invasive carcinoma. The goal {{of this study was}} to identify tissue markers of the adenoma-carcinoma morphogenetic transitions in CRC. We analyzed the patterns of expression of growth regulatory and stem cell markers across these distinct morphologic transition zones in 735 primary CRC tumors. In 202 cases with preserved adenoma-adenocarcinoma transition, we identified, in 37. 1 % of cases, a zone of adenomatous epithelium, located immediately adjacent to the invasive component, that showed rapidly alternating intraglandular stretches of PTEN+ and PTEN- epithelium. This zone exactly overlapped with similar alternating expression of Ki- 67 and inversely with the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) growth regulator SMAD 4. These zones also show parallel alternating levels and/or subcellular localization of multiple cancer stem/progenitor cell (CSC) markers, including β-catenin/CTNNB 1, ALDH 1, and CD 44. PTEN was always re-expressed in the invasive tumor in these cases, unlike those with complete loss of PTEN expression. Genomic microarray analysis of CRC with prominent CSC-like expansions demonstrated a high frequency of PTEN genomic deletion/haploinsufficiency in tumors with CSC-like transition zones (62. 5 %) but not in tumors with downregulated but non-alternating PTEN expression (14. 3 %). There were no significant differences in the levels of KRAS mutation or CTNNB 1 mutation in CSC-like tumors as compared to unselected CRC cases. In conclusion, we have identified a distinctive CSC-like pre-invasive transition zone in PTEN-haploinsufficient CRC that shows convergent <b>on-off</b> <b>regulation</b> of the PTEN/AKT, TGF-β/SMAD and Wnt/β-catenin pathways. This bottleneck-like zone is usually followed by the emergence of invasive tumors with intact PTEN expression but dysregulated TP 53 and uniformly high proliferation rates...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of stimuli-sensitive hydrogels in the fabrication of smart devices {{has become increasingly}} popular with many research groups and industries. In addition {{to their ability to}} experience large reversible transitions in their swelling behaviour due to small physiological or environmental changes, they are also often highly biocompatible, versatile and possess a high storage capacity for the immobilisation of biomolecules. Several transduction methods are currently employed for monitoring the swelling response of these materials, frequently these are based on optical and mechanical methods. Electrochemical transduction has not been investigated as thoroughly but would offer significant benefits in terms of direct coupling with microelectronics, reliability and the possibility of mass production of low-cost disposable electrode devices amenable to miniaturisation. This work demonstrates that electrochemical impedance spectroscopy can be used to track hydrogel swelling in response to target analytes. Highly sensitive detection was achieved based on resistance changes of a pH-sensitive hydrogel in response to glucose. As it demonstrated good potential as a sensing platform, the applicability of this system for detecting other analytes which can elicit a pH change and are challenging in terms of limit of detection requirements was subsequently investigated. The hydrogel was modified to detect β-D-glucuronidase, a marker compound for E. coli. Intelligent materials are also highly desirable for controlled drug delivery applications. In comparison with traditional routes of drug administration (i. e. oral and injection methods), on-demand drug delivery offers safer, more effective medical treatment by enabling site-specific administration with <b>on-off</b> <b>regulation</b> in real time. Consequently, the synthesis and characterisation of a novel electroactive hydrogel composite and its potential application in electro-stimulated drug delivery were explored. Finally, numerous strategies were investigated to improve the swelling rate to overcome the slow response time associated with the hydrogel system. A new fabrication route for superporous hydrogels was investigated and shown {{for the first time to}} be a viable synthesis method for hydrogel systems which may be limited by pH or templating restrictions. A dramatic reduction in response time, from hours to seconds, was demonstrated. If coupled with impedimetric transduction, rapid, highly sensitive analyte detection could be achieved which would offer significant benefits and advance the {{application of}} hydrogels in smart devices...|$|E
