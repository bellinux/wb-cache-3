40|$|Abstract. It {{can provide}} the basis on {{drafting}} the regional general aviation development policy for government departments and civil aviation regulatory agencies by analyzing the regional general aviation development level scientifically. The regional development level <b>of</b> general <b>aviation</b> in 2009 is chosen as the research object. According to the seven regional administration <b>of</b> Civil <b>Aviation</b> Administration <b>of</b> China (North China, Northeast, East China, Central and southern, Southwest, Northwest, Xinjiang), the region <b>of</b> general <b>aviation</b> is divided into seven parts. The evaluation system of operational scale and operational efficiency <b>of</b> regional general <b>aviation</b> is established. The weights of the seven indicators in the evaluation system are determined by Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and the development level of seven region <b>of</b> general <b>aviation</b> is evaluated by Fuzzy Comprehensive Evaluation Method. Finally, the development levels of seven region <b>of</b> general <b>aviation</b> are settled by the values of Fuzzy Comprehensive Evaluation. The relative good and weak regions <b>of</b> general <b>aviation</b> development are identified...|$|R
