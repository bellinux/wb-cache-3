5|$|The {{four main}} {{characters}} of Children of Mana are Ferrik, Tamber, Poppen, and Wanderer. They all {{live together in}} the Mana Village, near the Mana Tree. Ferrik is a fifteen-year-old boy {{who is said to}} be brave, bright and cheerful. He lost his parents and sister in the great disaster. After his life was saved by a knight, he has been honing his skills with the sword. Tamber is a sixteen-year-old girl, with a sense of truth and justice, and an air of maturity about her. She lost her parents and little brother due to the great disaster. Tamber's weapon <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> the bow. Poppen is a nine-year-old boy, who is stubborn and fearless. He lost his mother at birth and his father in the great disaster. Poppen's weapon <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> the flail. Wanderer is a traveling merchant, a tradition kept throughout the series. He {{is a member of the}} Niccolo tribe of rabbit/cat people who lost his family due to the king of Lorimar during the great disaster. Wanderer's weapon <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> the hammer.|$|E
5|$|The {{modality}} <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> {{computed tomography}} (CT scan) without contrast, of the brain. This {{has a high}} sensitivity and will correctly identify over 95 percent of cases—especially {{on the first day}} after the onset of bleeding. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be more sensitive than CT after several days. Within six hours of the onset of symptoms CT picks up 98.7% of cases.|$|E
5|$|Two hot {{beverages}} that Palestinians consume is coffee—served in {{the morning}} and throughout the day—and tea which is often sipped in the evening. Tea is usually flavored with na'ana (mint) or maramiyyeh (sage). The coffee <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> usually Turkish or Arabic coffee. Arabic coffee is similar to Turkish coffee, but the former is spiced with cardamom and is usually unsweetened.|$|E

5|$|The main {{antagonist}} of {{the game}} is Liquid Snake, leader of a now-terrorist splinter cell of the organization FOXHOUND, and genetic counterpart to Solid Snake. An elite special forces unit, FOXHOUND contains experts specializing in unique tasks. Members are Revolver Ocelot, a Western-style gunslinger and expert interrogator whose weapon <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> the Colt Single Action Army; Sniper Wolf, a preternatural sniper; Vulcan Raven, a hulking Alaskan shaman armed with an M61 Vulcan torn from a downed F-16; Psycho Mantis, a psychic profiler and psychokinesis expert; and Decoy Octopus, a master of disguise.|$|E
25|$|Don's main weapon <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> a Glock 19.|$|E
25|$|Although {{originally}} controversial, the axiom <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> {{now used}} without reservation by most mathematicians, {{and it is}} included in the standard form of axiomatic set theory, Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice (ZFC). One motivation for this use is that a number of generally accepted mathematical results, such as Tychonoff's theorem, require the axiom of choice for their proofs. Contemporary set theorists also study axioms that are not compatible with the axiom of choice, such as the axiom of determinacy. The axiom <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> avoided in some varieties of constructive mathematics, although there are varieties of constructive mathematics in which the axiom <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> embraced.|$|E

25|$|Clan Mackenzie's weapon <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> the longbow, but in hand-to-hand {{fighting}} {{they use the}} gladius and buckler.|$|E
25|$|Weapons <b>of</b> <b>Choice</b> <b>is</b> {{the first}} {{novel of the}} Axis of Time {{alternative}} history trilogy, written by Australian author John Birmingham.|$|E
25|$|The current {{treatment}} <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> the {{intravenous administration}} of dantrolene, {{the only known}} antidote, discontinuation of triggering agents, and supportive therapy directed at correcting hyperthermia, acidosis, and organ dysfunction. Treatment must be instituted rapidly on clinical suspicion of the onset of malignant hyperthermia.|$|E

25|$|If the axiom <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> {{assumed to}} be true, it can be proved that not all subsets of Euclidean space are Lebesgue measurable; {{examples}} of such sets include the Vitali set, and the non-measurable sets postulated by the Hausdorff paradox and the Banach–Tarski paradox.|$|E
25|$|A {{form of the}} axiom <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> {{required}} to prove that every topological space has a Stone–Čech compactification. Even for quite simple spaces X, an accessible concrete description of βX often remains elusive. In particular, proofs that βX\X is nonempty do not give an explicit description of any particular point in βX\X.|$|E
25|$|Reid Bahnson: Alaska Department of Transportation & Public Facilities {{avalanche}} technician. He leads a {{crew that}} triggers avalanches so natural ones {{are less likely}} to impact truckers and freight on the Dalton. His weapon <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> a Korean War-era recoilless rifle that shoots 8-lb TNT mortars into avalanche chutes.|$|E

25|$|Assuming ZF is consistent, Kurt Gödel {{showed that}} the {{negation}} of the axiom <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> not a theorem of ZF by constructing an inner model (the constructible universe) which satisfies ZFC and thus showing that ZFC is consistent. Assuming ZF is consistent, Paul Cohen employed the technique of forcing, developed for this purpose, {{to show that the}} axiom of choice itself is not a theorem of ZF by constructing a much more complex model which satisfies ZF¬C (ZF with the negation of AC added as axiom) and thus showing that ZF¬C is consistent. Together these results establish that the axiom <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> logically independent of ZF. The assumption that ZF is consistent is harmless because adding another axiom to an already inconsistent system cannot make the situation worse. Because of independence, the decision whether to use the axiom of choice (or its negation) in a proof cannot be made by appeal to other axioms of set theory. The decision must be made on other grounds.|$|E
25|$|It is {{well known}} that the axiom <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> {{equivalent}} to the ability to well-order every set. Being able to well-order the proper class V (as we have done here with L) is equivalent to the axiom of global choice, which is more powerful than the ordinary axiom of choice because it also covers proper classes of non-empty sets.|$|E
25|$|Identified by {{methenamine}} silver stain of lung tissue, type I pneumocytes, {{and type}} II pneumocytes over-replicate and damage alveolar epithelium, causing death by asphyxiation. Fluid leaks into alveoli, producing an exudate seen as honeycomb/cotton candy appearance on hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides. Drug <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, pentamidine, or dapsone. In HIV patients, most cases {{occur when the}} CD4 count is below 200 cells per microliter.|$|E

25|$|Formally, {{the order}} among {{cardinal}} numbers {{is defined as}} follows: |X| ≤ |Y| means that there exists an injective function from X to Y. The Cantor–Bernstein–Schroeder theorem states that if |X| ≤ |Y| and |Y| ≤ |X| then |X| = |Y|. The axiom <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> equivalent to the statement that given two sets X and Y, either |X| ≤ |Y| or |Y| ≤ |X|.|$|E
25|$|Fraenkel (1922) {{proved that}} the axiom of choice cannot be proved from the axioms of Zermelo's set theory with urelements. Later work by Paul Cohen (1966) showed that the {{addition}} of urelements is not needed, and the axiom <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> unprovable in ZF. Cohen's proof developed the method of forcing, which is now an important tool for establishing independence results in set theory.|$|E
25|$|Usually the {{semiconductor}} <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> silicon, but some chip manufacturers, most notably IBM and Intel, recently started using a chemical compound of silicon and germanium (SiGe) in MOSFET channels. Unfortunately, many semiconductors with better electrical properties than silicon, such as gallium arsenide, do not form good semiconductor-to-insulator interfaces, {{and thus are}} not suitable for MOSFETs. Research continues on creating insulators with acceptable electrical characteristics on other semiconductor materials.|$|E
