40|$|A south Adriatic shelf {{offshore}} the prevalently carbonate Apulian {{coast is}} characterized by a peculiar rough topography interpreted as relic karst formed at time of lowered sea level. The study area covers a surface of ca. 220 km 2 in a depth range of 50 - 105 m. The most relevant and diagnostic feature is represented by circular depressions a few tens to 150 m in diameter and 0. 50 to 20 m deep thought to be dolinas at various stages of evolution. The major dolina (<b>Oyster</b> <b>pit)</b> has its top at ca. 50 m water depth and is 20 m deep. Its crater is partly filled by episodic mass failure from the dolina's flanks remobilizing Pleistocene pebbly-shelly sediments. Bedrock samples from the study area document that Plio-Pleistocene calcarenites (tentatively correlated with Calcarenite di Gravina Fm.) are a prime candidate of carbonate rocks involved in karstification, although the presence of other units (Peschici and/or Maiolica Fms) is not discarded. The area containing this subaerial karst landscape was submerged ca. 12500 years ago {{as a result of the}} postglacial transgression over the continental shelf...|$|E

50|$|The {{fishing village}} {{is well known}} for its aquaculture. Tourists visit the <b>oyster</b> <b>pits,</b> harbors and museum of the town and fishing industry, as well as the annual celebration of the mussel harvest (Mosseldag) in August. The village {{furthermore}} plays host to the Dutch Institute for Ecology (NIOO).|$|R
50|$|Starting {{approximately}} in 1870, {{the village}} began large-scale cultivation of oysters, partly {{in response to}} high French demand. For this purpose, parcels within the Eastern Scheldt were leased out by the government for farming, while pits outside the dikes employing roof tiles were constructed for cultivation of <b>oyster</b> larvae. These <b>pits</b> were eventually abandoned in the 20th century, replaced by pits built within the dikes close to the harbour, where roof tiles {{have given way to}} modern racks. The pits also serve to flush oysters harvested from the estuaries, and are surrounded by old, characteristic warehouses.|$|R
50|$|Relatively flat shell fields, {{of about}} 6.5 ha in area, {{are in the}} {{interior}} of the shell works, separated from the shell ring by mangroves, with a series of mounds partly surrounding the shell fields. The shell fields have some very low ridges and shallow depressions and ponds. Schwadron suggests that the depressions may have been <b>oyster</b> roasting <b>pits</b> or the sites of structures. The shell fields consist primarily of small oyster shells with some conch and whelk shells, and many artifacts, including ceramics and shell tools. The base level of the shell fields consists of a mixture of broken and unbroken oyster shell, with no artifacts and very little soil. On top of the base is a very thin layer of crushed oyster shell, interpreted as an old ground surface. Possible post holes, now filled with soil, extend from this layer into the base layer. Above the old ground surface is a midden layer, consisting of oyster shells with about 20% soil mixed in, and ceramics and shell tools. The modern surface is a sandy loam. The ceramics are classified as late Glades I period, from 500 to 750. Two shell samples yielded calibrated radiocarbon dates of 400-580 and 450-620. This time period corresponds to that in which the shell fields at Fakahatchee Key were constructed.|$|R
