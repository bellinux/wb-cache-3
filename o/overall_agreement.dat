The disposition of bones in the quarry is approximately as expected if the animal were lying on its left side in an opisthotonic pose, but nearly all bones show some disorientation and disarticulation: the cervical vertebrae are arranged along a curved line, and extending along this tight curve (approximately) sit two of the dorsal vertebrae followed by the sacrum and caudal vertebrae. The sacrum and first three caudal vertebrae were found in articulation and in line with the remaining articulated caudal vertebrae; others are present after a gap of about [...] Twenty-seven caudal vertebrae are shown on the quarry map, but 30 were found in the collection, and pre-restoration photos indicate that 32 were originally present. Many of the chevrons were found articulated with their respective caudal vertebrae. The left and right scapulae were recovered on {{the left and right}} sides of the body, respectively. The left radius was found about midway between the pectoral girdle elements. Left and right femora, pubes, and ilia were located close to one another and all of these were found near the sacrum. The sacrum is depicted with its left side facing upwards on the quarry map, but this might have been an error because {{the left side of the}} sacrum is damaged and the left ilium is missing. The elements of the left and right crura were found in close association. Dorsal rib fragments were scattered across the quarry area. In sum, some degree of dispositioning occurred to HBV-20001 before or during burial, resulting in loss and disarticulation of some elements, but the disposition, <b>overall</b> <b>agreement</b> in size, and lack of duplication of bones suggests the presence of a single sauropod individual at this locality.|$|E

These {{results show that the}} AO classification for distal radius fractures requiring operative treatment does not have an adequate reproducibility. Classification of distal radius fractures with both pre- and post-reduction radiographs might lead to a higher inter-observer agreement although the agreement is still not sufficient. A simplified classification system may improve agreement among clinicians.|$|R

30|$|The AC 1 {{statistic}} (Gwet 2001), or first-order agreement coefficient, corrects the <b>overall</b> percentage <b>agreement</b> for chance agreement.

Therefore, the AC 1 statistic is the relative number of instances upon which tools {{are expected to}} agree from a set where instances classified by chance in identical categories were already removed. The AC 1 statistic is calculated as (p − e(γ))/(1  − e(γ)), where p is the <b>overall</b> percentage <b>agreement</b> and e(γ) is the chance agreement probability (Gwet 2001).
