50|$|A {{significant}} portion of the English vocabulary comes from Romance and Latinate sources. Estimates of native words (derived from Old English) range from 20% - 33%, with the rest made up of <b>outside</b> <b>borrowings.</b> A portion of these borrowings come directly from Latin, or through one of the Romance languages, particularly Anglo-Norman and French, but some also from Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish; or from other languages (such as Gothic, Frankish or Greek) into Latin and then into English. The influence of Latin in English, therefore, is primarily lexical in nature, being confined mainly to words derived from Latin roots.|$|E
40|$|A 20 % {{stratified}} sample of {{books of the}} Indian Space Research Organisation's (ISRO) Satellite Centre (ISAC) Library were examined to record over 14, 000 <b>outside</b> <b>borrowings.</b> The use of these books is analysed with frequency tables to pinpoint unused, least used and highly used books. Studies are made also of the relative use of books in different subject groups, longitudinal use over time, subject use of unused and highly used books and distribution of use over age and year of acquisition of the books. The paper concludes by discussing the extent of use of books at the ISAC Library and providing findings concerning collection development and weeding processes...|$|E
5000|$|It is {{possible}} that Iberian had the semivowels [...] (in words such as aiun or iunstir) and [...] (only in loanwords such as diuiś from Gaulish). The fact that [...] is lacking in native words casts doubt on whether semivowels really existed in Iberian <b>outside</b> of foreign <b>borrowings</b> and diphthongs.|$|R
25|$|Mixe–Zoque {{specialist}} Søren Wichmann first critiqued {{this theory}} {{on the basis}} that most of the Mixe–Zoquean loans seemed to originate from the Zoquean branch of the family only. This implied the loanword transmission occurred in the period after the two branches of the language family split, placing the time of the <b>borrowings</b> <b>outside</b> of the Olmec period. However new evidence has pushed back the proposed date for the split of Mixean and Zoquean languages to a period within the Olmec era. Based on this dating, the architectural and archaeological patterns and the particulars of the vocabulary loaned to other Mesoamerican languages from Mixe–Zoquean, Wichmann now suggests that the Olmecs of San Lorenzo spoke proto-Mixe and the Olmecs of La Venta spoke proto-Zoque.|$|R
