5|$|As a {{technology}} showcase, Valve considered Lost Coast {{to have very}} demanding system requirements. The game runs <b>on</b> <b>computers</b> with specifications lower than what is recommended, albeit without some key features such as high dynamic range. If a non-high-dynamic-range-capable card is used, the developer commentary is changed slightly to reflect this. For example, Valve president Gabe Newell would describe the effects that are seen in a different manner.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Apple co-founder Steve Jobs led Apple's SuperMicro division, {{which was}} {{responsible}} {{for the development of the}} Macintosh and Lisa personal computers. The Macintosh had been successful on university campuses partly because of the Apple University Consortium, which allowed students and institutions to buy the computers at a discount. The consortium had earned more than $50million <b>on</b> <b>computers</b> by February 1984.|$|E

5|$|Approximately 50 {{people work}} {{together}} in animating and producing an episode of SpongeBob SquarePants. Throughout its run, production of the series has been handled domestically at Nickelodeon Animation Studio in Burbank, California, while the finished animation has been created overseas at Rough Draft Studios in South Korea. Storyboarding for each episode {{is done by the}} crew in California. The storyboards are then used as templates by the crew in Korea, who animate by hand, color cels <b>on</b> <b>computers,</b> and paint backgrounds. Episodes are finished in California, where they are edited and have music added. Every season, character designs are updated or modified to solve technical issues in the animation.|$|E
5|$|For Vorticons, Carmack {{had created}} {{adaptive}} tile refresh {{to produce a}} scrolling effect <b>on</b> <b>computers</b> not powerful enough to redraw the entire screen when the player moved. For Keen Dreams, he wanted to scroll the background at a different rate than the foreground, but again computers of the time were not powerful enough to do so smoothly. To implement parallax scrolling without having to manage all of the elements moving past each other, {{he came up with}} a plan to instead save combinations of overlapping foreground and background elements in memory and display the appropriate combination for where Keen was on the screen, so that the game only needed to pick the correct image rather than recalculate what that image would be.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, J. Alan Robinson had {{discovered}} a simple method to implement deduction <b>on</b> <b>computers,</b> the resolution and unification algorithm. However, straightforward implementations, like those attempted by McCarthy and his students in the late 60s, were especially intractable: the programs required astronomical numbers of steps to prove simple theorems. A more fruitful approach to logic {{was developed in the}} 1970s by Robert Kowalski at the University of Edinburgh, and soon this led to the collaboration with French researchers Alain Colmerauer and Philippe Roussel who created the successful logic programming language Prolog.|$|E
2500|$|The {{conclusion}} {{resulted in}} evaluations done <b>on</b> <b>computer</b> #1 after testing <b>on</b> <b>computer</b> #1 yielded much more positive responses about the session. Evaluations completed <b>on</b> the other <b>computer</b> after testing <b>on</b> <b>computer</b> #1 resulted {{in much more}} varied and more negative responses about the session. For the control, the pen-and-paper questionnaire, the evaluations had similar results to that of evaluations done <b>on</b> <b>computer</b> #2. Respondents felt more comfortable being honest when a different computer or paper asked about the sessions completed <b>on</b> <b>computer</b> #1. It is as if participants were talking behind the computer 1’s back- not being honest to it, but then expressing more honesty to a third party evaluator. Reeves and Nass found that participants had automatic social reactions during the test.|$|R

5|$|In 2003, Krug led the {{challenge}} to {{the constitutionality of the}} Children's Internet Protection Act. Her efforts led to a partial victory for the Act's opponents; the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that the law was constitutional, but that internet filtering software <b>on</b> <b>computers</b> in public libraries could be turned off if so requested by an adult guardian. She said that filters used to censor Internet pornography from children were not perfect and risked blocking educational information about social matters, sexuality, and healthcare. She emphasized the need to educate children about morality instead of using online filters to block information from them. In 2006, she was elected Vice-President of the Phi Beta Kappa Society.|$|E

5|$|The X-Mansion {{serves as}} a hub that the team returns to after each mission. While at the mansion, one player {{controls}} Alison Crestmere as she explores, and learns about herself and the other X-Men. Here players can also view loading screen art, cinematics, and comic book covers acquired during gameplay. Biographies of the X-Men and their enemies can be accessed <b>on</b> <b>computers</b> located in the mansion. Players can participate in an X-Men trivia game, which rewards experience points for correct answers. Additionally, players can access the Danger Room's computer to play challenge missions unlocked during gameplay.|$|E

5|$|In September 2014, {{a wave of}} {{ransomware}} Trojans surfaced {{that first}} targeted users in Australia, under the names CryptoWall and CryptoLocker (which is, as with CryptoLocker 2.0, unrelated to the original CryptoLocker). The Trojans spread via fraudulent e-mails claiming to be failed parcel delivery notices from Australia Post; to evade detection by automatic e-mail scanners that follow all links on a page to scan for malware, this variant was designed to require users to visit a web page and enter a CAPTCHA code before the payload is actually downloaded, preventing such automated processes {{from being able to}} scan the payload. Symantec determined that these new variants, which it identified as CryptoLocker.F, were again, unrelated to the original CryptoLocker due to differences in their operation. A notable victim of the Trojans was the Australian Broadcasting Corporation; live programming on its television news channel ABC News 24 was disrupted for half an hour and shifted to Melbourne studios due to a CryptoWall infection <b>on</b> <b>computers</b> at its Sydney studio.|$|E

Hall, meanwhile, had received feedback from parents who did not like that the enemies in Vorticons left behind corpses instead of disappearing like in other games; he did not want the violence to have no effects, and so in Dreams replaced the raygun with pellets that temporarily stunned enemies. He was not satisfied with this change, and while considering ways to remove Keen's parents during the introduction for Galaxy, came up with a stun gun which would leave behind permanently stunned enemies, which appeared in all three episodes made in 1991. Additionally, music, which was missing in prior Keen games, was added to Aliens, composed by Bobby Prince.|$|E
