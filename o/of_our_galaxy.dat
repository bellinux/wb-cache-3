A good analogy is trying to observe a marching band {{as a member of the}} band. Observing other galaxies is much easier because humans are outside those galaxies.

5|$|The {{cluster is}} slowly {{moving in the}} {{direction}} of the feet of what is currently the constellation of Orion. Like most open clusters, the Pleiades will not stay gravitationally bound forever. Some component stars will be ejected after close encounters with other stars; others will be stripped by tidal gravitational fields.

5|$|Gamma-ray bursts {{are very}} bright as {{observed}} from Earth despite their typically immense distances. An average long GRB has a bolometric flux comparable to a bright star <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>galaxy</b> despite {{a distance of}} billions of light years (compared to a few tens of light years for most visible stars). Most of this energy is released in gamma rays, although some GRBs have extremely luminous optical counterparts as well. GRB 080319B, for example, was accompanied by an optical counterpart that peaked at a visible magnitude of 5.8, {{comparable to that of}} the dimmest naked-eye stars despite the burst's distance of 7.5 billion light years. This combination of brightness and distance implies an extremely energetic source. Assuming the gamma-ray explosion to be spherical, the energy output of GRB 080319B would be within a factor of two of the rest-mass energy of the Sun (the energy which would be released were the Sun to be converted entirely into radiation).|$|E

25|$|A geocentric {{frame is}} useful for many {{everyday}} activities and most laboratory experiments, but is a less appropriate choice for solar-system mechanics and space travel. While a heliocentric frame is most useful in those cases, galactic and extra-galactic astronomy is easier if the sun is treated as neither stationary nor {{the center of the}} universe, but rotating around the center <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>galaxy,</b> and in turn our galaxy is also not at rest in the cosmic background.|$|E
25|$|Indirect {{detection}} experiments {{search for}} {{the products of the}} self-annihilation or decay of dark matter particles in outer space. For example, in regions of high dark matter density (e.g. the centre <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>galaxy)</b> two dark matter particles could annihilate to produce gamma rays or Standard Model particle-antiparticle pairs. Alternatively if the dark matter particle is unstable, it could decay into standard model (or other) particles. These processes could be detected indirectly through an excess of gamma rays, antiprotons or positrons emanating from high density regions in our galaxy or others. A major difficulty inherent in such searches is that there are various astrophysical sources which can mimic the signal expected from dark matter, and so multiple signals will likely be required for a conclusive discovery.|$|E
40|$|Abridged) We {{present an}} {{analysis}} of the stellar populations of the gas-stripped outer disks of ten Virgo Cluster spiral galaxies, utilizing SparsePak integral field spectroscopy on the WIYN 3. 5 m telescope and GALEX UV photometry. The <b>galaxies</b> in <b>our</b> sample show evidence for being gas-stripped spiral galaxies, with star formation within a truncation radius, and a passive population beyond the truncation radius. We find that all of the galaxies with spatially truncated star formation have outer disk stellar populations consistent with star formation ending within the last 500 Myr. The synthesis of optical spectroscopy and GALEX observations demonstrate that star formation was relatively constant until the quenching time, after which the galaxies passively evolved. Large starbursts at the time of quenching are excluded for all galaxies. For approximately half <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>galaxies,</b> timescales derived from our observations are consistent with galaxies being stripped in or near the cluster core, where simple ram-pressure estimates can explain the stripping. However, the other half <b>of</b> <b>our</b> sample <b>galaxies</b> were clearly stripped outside the cluster core. Such galaxies provide evidence that the intra-cluster medium is not static and smooth. For three <b>of</b> <b>our</b> sample <b>galaxies,</b> <b>our</b> stripping timescales agree with those from the gas stripping simulations, suggesting that star formation is quenched near the time of peak pressure. While the stripping of star-forming gas in the outer disk creates a passive population in <b>our</b> <b>galaxies,</b> there is still normal star formation in the center <b>of</b> <b>our</b> sample <b>galaxies.</b> It may be that Virgo is not massive enough to completely strip these spiral galaxies and, in a more dynamically active cluster or a cluster with a higher density ICM, such a process would lead to passive spirals and/or S 0 s.

25|$|Glycolaldehyde, {{the first}} example of an {{interstellar}} sugar molecule, was detected in the star-forming region near the centre <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>galaxy.</b> It was discovered in 2000 by Jes Jørgensen and Jan M. Hollis. In 2012, Jørgensen's team reported the detection of glycolaldehyde in a distant star system. The molecule was found around the protostellar binary IRAS 16293-2422 400 light years from Earth. Glycolaldehyde is needed to form RNA, which is similar in function to DNA. These findings suggest that complex organic molecules may form in stellar systems prior {{to the formation of}} planets, eventually arriving on young planets early in their formation. Because sugars are associated with both metabolism and the genetic code, two of the most basic aspects of life, it is thought the discovery of extraterrestrial sugar increases the likelihood that life may exist elsewhere in our galaxy.|$|E

40|$|We have {{analyzed}} long-slit {{spectra of}} 12 dwarf irregular galaxies from the Arecibo Dual Beam Survey (ADBS). These galaxies represent a heterogeneous sample of objects detected by ADBS, but on average are relatively gas-rich, low-surface-brightness, and low-mass, thus represent {{a region of}} the galaxian population that is not commonly included in optical surveys. The metallicity-luminosity relationship for these galaxies is analyzed; the galaxies discussed in this paper appear to be under-abundant at a given luminosity when compared to a sample from the literature. We attempt to identify a "second parameter" responsible for the intrinsic scatter and apparent under-abundance <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>galaxies.</b> We do not find a definitive second parameter but note the possible indication that infall or mixing of pristine gas may be responsible. We derive oxygen abundances for multiple HII regions in many <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>galaxies</b> but do not find any strong indications of metallicity variation within the galaxies except in one case where we see variation between an isolated HII region and the rest <b>of</b> the <b>galaxy.</b> <b>Our</b> data set includes the galaxy with the largest known HI-to-optical size ratio, ADBS 113845 + 2008. <b>Our</b> abundance analysis <b>of</b> this galaxy reveals that it is strongly over-enriched compared to galaxies of similar luminosity, indicating {{it is not a}} young object and confirming the result from Cannon et. al (2009) that this galaxy appears to be intrinsically rare in the local universe.

40|$|We {{present a}} sample of 48 metal-poor galaxies at z < 0. 14 {{selected}} from 92, 510 galaxies in the LAMOST survey. These galaxies are identified for their detection of the auroral emission line λ 4363 above 3 σ level, which allows a direct measurement of the electron temperature and the oxygen abundance. The emission line fluxes are corrected for internal dust extinction using Balmer decrement method. With electron temperature derived from λλ 4959, 5007 /λ 4363 and electron density from λ 6731 /λ 6717, we obtain the oxygen abundances in our sample which range from = 7. 63 (0. 09) to 8. 46 (0. 6).

500|$|Some people {{interpreted}} the galactic alignment apocalyptically, claiming that its occurrence would somehow create a combined gravitational effect between the Sun and the supermassive black {{hole at the}} center <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>galaxy</b> (known as Sagittarius A*), creating havoc on Earth.
