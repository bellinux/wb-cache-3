40|$|Use of cod liver oil, {{which is}} rich in {{vitamins}} A and D, is traditionally recommended during {{the fall and winter}} months as a protective measure against vitamin D deficiency in several countries. It is not known whether child-hood cod liver <b>oil</b> <b>intake</b> is related to variations in bone mineral density (BMD) or fractures in adult life. In 2001, a total of 3, 052 Norway women aged 50 – 70 years had forearm BMD measured in a substudy of the population-based Nord-Trøndelag Health Study.

40|$|Objective—The {{beneficial}} effect of dietary fish oil, rich in omega- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), on cardiovascular disease is multifactorial and may partly {{rely on their}} anticoagulant action. We studied how fish <b>oil</b> <b>intake</b> influenced thrombin generation in plasma and which factors were involved herein. Methods and Results—Twenty-five healthy males with borderline overweight received 3. 0 g omega- 3 PUFAs daily for 4 weeks. Fish <b>oil</b> <b>intake</b> reduced plasma triglycerides and lowered platelet integrin activation, as well as plasma levels of fibrinogen and factor V, but {{had no effect on}} vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors. Before fish <b>oil</b> <b>intake,</b> thrombin generation (reflecting the coagulant potential) considerably varied between plasmas from individual subjects, which were partly explained by variation in prothrombin, antithrombin, fibrinogen, and factor V levels. Fish <b>oil</b> <b>intake</b> reduced thrombin generation in the presence and absence of platelets. This reduction correlated with the fish oil effect on fibrinogen and factor V levels. Interestingly, the lowering effect of fish oil on thrombin generation and fibrinogen clustered around subjects with high fibrinogen carrying a structural fibrinogen -chain polymorphism. Conclusions—Dietary omega- 3 PUFAs provoke a hypocoagulant, vitamin K-independent effect in humans, the degree of which may depend on fibrinogen level.

This {{study investigated the}} relationships between erythrocyte membrane LCn 3 PUFA status, depression and angina symptoms in patients with heart disease. Methods: We recruited 91 patients (65 males and 26 females, mean age 59. 2 ± 10. 3 years) with heart disease and depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, CES-D ≥ 16) and low fish/fish <b>oil</b> <b>intakes.</b> The Omega- 3 Index (EPA+DHA) of erythrocyte membranes (as a percentage of total fatty acids) was assessed by gas chromatography. Depression status was measured by both self-report and clinician-report scales; CES-D and the Hamilton depression scale (HAM-D). Angina symptoms were measured using the Seattle Angina Questionnaire and the Canadian Cardiovascular Society Classification for Angina Pectoris. Results: The mean Omega- 3 Index was 4. 8 ± 1. 0 % (±SD). Depression scores measured by CES-D and HAM-D were 29. 2 ± 8. 8 (moderate to severe) and 11. 0 ± 5. 7 (mild) (arbitrary units) respectively reflecting a different perception of depressive symptoms between patients and clinicians.

40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} shown that high olive <b>oil</b> <b>intake</b> reduces blood {{pressure}} (BP). These positive effects of olive oil have frequently been ascribed to its minor components, such as α-tocopherol, polyphenols, and other phenolic compounds that are not present in other oils. However, in this study we demonstrate that the hypotensive effect of olive oil is caused by its high oleic acid (OA) content (≈ 70 – 80 %). We propose that olive <b>oil</b> <b>intake</b> increases OA levels in membranes, which regulates membrane lipid structure (HII phase propensity) {{in such a way as}} to control G protein-mediated signaling, causing a reduction in BP. This effect is in part caused by its regulatory action on G protein-associated cascades that regulate adenylyl cyclase and phospholipase C. In turn, the OA analogues, elaidic and stearic acids, had no hypotensive activity, indicating that the molecular mechanisms that link membrane lipid structure and BP regulation are very specific. Similarly, soybean oil (with low OA content) did not reduce BP. This study demonstrates that olive oil induces its hypotensive effects through the action of OA...|$|E

40|$|Background: Butter {{is known}} to have a cholesterol-raising effect and, therefore, has often been {{included}} as a negative control in di-etary studies, whereas the effect of moderate butter intake has not been elucidated to our knowledge. Objective: We compared the effects of moderate butter intake, moderate olive <b>oil</b> <b>intake,</b> or a habitual diet on blood lipids, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), glucose, and insulin. Design: The study was a controlled, double-blinded, randomized 2 3 5 -wk crossover dietary intervention study with a 14 -d run-in period during which subjects consumed their habitual diets. The study included 47 healthy men and women (mean 6 SD total cho-lesterol: 5. 22 6 0. 90 mmol/L) who substituted a part of their ha-bitual diets with 4. 5 % of energy from butter or refined olive oil. Results: Study subjects were 70 % women with a mean age and body mass index (in kg/m 2) of 40. 4 y and 23. 5, respectively. Butter intake increased total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol more than did olive <b>oil</b> <b>intake</b> (P, 0. 05) and the run-in period (P, 0. 005 and P, 0. 05, respectively) and increased HDL cholesterol compared with the run-in period (P, 0. 05). No difference in effects was observed for triacylglycerol, hsCRP, insulin, and glucose concen-trations. The intake of saturated fatty acids was significantly higher in the butter period compared with olive oil and the run-in period (P, 0. 0001). Conclusions:Moderate intake of butter resulted in increases in total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol compared with the effects of olive <b>oil</b> <b>intake</b> and a habitual diet (run-in period). Furthermore, mod-erate butter intake was also followed by an increase in HDL cholesterol compared with the habitual diet.

40|$|Abstract This {{paper is}} exploratory. It seeks {{to link the}} two {{dominant}} food systems of Chinawith impacts on human health, {{as measured by the}} increasing but differential incidence of non-communicable chronic diseases. China is passing through the Nutrition Transition where traditional diets are being replaced by high fat and meat diets, high calorie snacks and meals with high protein and <b>oil</b> <b>intakes.</b> The argument is constructed on the basis that in general urban citizens increasingly consume processed foods manufactured by the industrial food system. Rural people on the other hand remain consuming their traditional diets. Process foods derive from industrial agriculture while local food is derived in a self provisioning way from small mixed farms growing grains and vegetables and keeping farmyard livestock; the so-called, ‘one family; two systems’ way of peasant farming. The statistics from the China Yearbook, the North Carolina Nutrition study, 1993 to 2009 and the China Sanitation survey provide preliminary evidence to support this supposition at the macro scale. An associative link can be made that shows that food from the small mixed farm village environments is generally healthier than the fast food, processed diets of urban dwellers. This simplistic conclusion must be tempered by the effects of other life style behaviors that can also affect the health status of Chinese citizens, whether rural or urban. However, overall, there is evidence that suggests that as Chinese society becomes wealthier and more urbanized, the health status of citizens as measured by food related chronic diseases, becomes poorer. In terms of the incidence of chronic diseases, rural citizens are less at risk than urban citizens and this in large part is influenced by their food intake patterns which in turn reflect the two systems of food production (local and industrial) that prevail inChina. The paper concludes with some reflections on what this paradox means for food system research in emerging economies such asChina.

Here, a metabolomic approach, using a combination of 1 H-Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy, and gas and liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry, was employed to elucidate the metabolic changes in blood plasma following weight loss and fish oil supplementation. The intervention study was conducted over 24  weeks, with 93 female subjects randomised to one of three groups.

40|$|BackgroundAlthough Mediterranean diet {{has grown}} {{worldwide}} {{due to its}} link with lower cardiovascular disease rate and greater longevity, the effect of olive oil, which is the principal component of Mediterranean diet, on plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 (PAI- 1) concentrations in aged rats is not clear. This study was performed on 28 aged male Wistar albino rats allocated into two groups (14 rats each) : Olive oil-treated group and the control group. ResultsUsing Real Time-PCR, the expression of PAI- 1 mRNA in the retroperitoneal adipose tissues was decreased significantly in the olive oil treated group versus the control group (P< 0. 01). In parallel, the plasma concentrations of PAI- 1 were also reduced significantly in the olive oil treated group versus the control group (P< 0. 01). Olive oil produced significant decrease in mean serum cholesterol and triglycerides in aged rats in the treated group versus the control group (P< 0. 05, P< 0. 01, respectively). No significant difference was seen in mean serum LDL-cholesterol or HDL-cholesterol levels between both groups. As regards the BMI, no change was observed after olive <b>oil</b> <b>intake.</b> ConclusionOur results indicate that olive <b>oil</b> <b>intake</b> may reduce the cardiovascular risk in old age via decreasing PAI- 1 at level of gene expression...|$|E

Phytosterols lower total and LDL bloodcholesterol by {{preventing}} cholesterol absorption from the intestine, so they have been known as bloodcholesterol-lowering agents for over the last half century.
