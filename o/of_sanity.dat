5|$|By {{the end of}} 1948, the BBC Third Programme {{began to}} {{broadcast}} the comedy series Third Division, which starred, among others, Harry Secombe, Michael Bentine and Sellers. One evening, Sellers and Bentine visited the Hackney Empire, where Secombe was performing, and Bentine introduced Sellers to Spike Milligan. The four would meet up at Grafton's public house near Victoria, owned by Jimmy Grafton, {{who was also a}} BBC script writer. The four comedians dubbed him KOGVOS (Keeper of Goons and Voice <b>of</b> <b>Sanity)</b> Grafton later edited some of the first Goon Shows.|$|E
5|$|Gojira {{was formed}} in 1996 by Joe and Mario Duplantier, Christian Andreu, and Alexandre Cornillon in their {{hometown}} of Ondres. Gojira's music combines elements of death metal, groove metal, thrash metal, and progressive metal. The band started touring and recording under the name Godzilla and released their demos Victim, Possessed, Saturate, and Wisdom Comes in 1996, 1997, 1999, and 2000, respectively. After touring, supporting Cannibal Corpse, Edge <b>of</b> <b>Sanity,</b> Impaled Nazarene, and Immortal in September 1999, legal problems forced Godzilla to change their name. They changed their name to Gojira, the rōmaji spelling of the fictional monster Godzilla. Their debut album Terra Incognita was released under the new name in 2001.|$|E
5|$|He also {{missed the}} {{opportunity}} to lead the original Sinister Six because he felt that joining the group would mean admitting he needed the help of others to rid himself of Spider-Man. Although he later formed the 'Sinister Twelve' when Spider-Man sent him to prison, he expressed anger at Mac Gargan for acquiring the Venom symbiote rather than using the new Scorpion suit provided for him simply because Gargan was not doing what he wanted, despite Venom being {{more powerful than the}} Scorpion. When he participated in the mystical ritual known as the Gathering of Five, he appeared convinced that he would automatically receive the gift of power from the ritual– which would bestow upon the participants power, immortality, knowledge, madness and death, respectively– only to receive the gift of madness instead, subsequently requiring an elaborate cocktail of drugs to restore himself to a semblance <b>of</b> <b>sanity.</b> During his time in charge of H.A.M.M.E.R. he was provoked into attacking Asgard by his Goblin side because his ego couldn't allow himself to consider the possibility that the Asgardians wouldn't threaten his power. Later events revealed that Loki at least slightly influenced Osborn's decision to further Loki's own goals. During his attempted takeover of Earth's superhuman security defenses, he was shown reflecting that humans are all barbarians who require the strong like him to control them, dismissing the Avengers as no better than him despite the obvious distinction between Osborn's demands for power and the straightforward respect that the general public have for the Avengers.|$|E

5|$|It {{happened}} {{on my last}} day in Hanoi. I was exhausted and an emotional wreck after the 2-week visit... The translator {{told me that the}} soldiers wanted to sing me a song. He translated as they sung. It was a song about the day 'Uncle Ho' declared their country's independence in Hanoi's Ba Dinh Square. I heard these words: 'All men are created equal; they are given certain rights; among these are life, Liberty and Happiness.' These are the words Ho pronounced at the historic ceremony. I began to cry and clap. 'These young men should not be our enemy. They celebrate the same words Americans do.' The soldiers asked me to sing for them in return... I memorized a song called 'Day Ma Di', written by anti-war South Vietnamese students. I knew I was slaughtering it, but everyone seemed delighted that I was making the attempt. I finished. Everyone was laughing and clapping, including me... Here is my best, honest recollection of what happened: someone (I don't remember who) led me towards the gun, and I sat down, still laughing, still applauding. It all {{had nothing to do with}} where I was sitting. I hardly even thought about where I was sitting. The cameras flashed... It is possible that it was a set up, that the Vietnamese had it all planned. I will never know. But if they did I can't blame them. The buck stops here. If I was used, I allowed it to happen... a two-minute lapse <b>of</b> <b>sanity</b> that will haunt me forever... But the photo exists, delivering its message regardless of what I was doing or feeling. I carry this heavy in my heart. I have apologized numerous times for any pain I may have caused servicemen and their families because of this photograph. It was never my intention to cause harm.|$|E

A sequel, Crimson II, was released in 2003 and picks up directly where the first album left off. Both albums were remixed and slightly edited to fit together on one CD for release on the 2006 compilation When All Is Said; these new mixes/edits were split into sections and released digitally to online retailers and streaming services.|$|R
25|$|However, Robert D. Hare, a {{psychologist}} working in criminology, developed an influential Psychopathy Checklist {{based on the}} psychopath construct developed by Cleckley. Later two items {{were removed from the}} checklist in order to more clearly represent the structure of a two-factor analysis. Grandiosity, impulsivity and juvenile delinquency were not in Cleckley's criteria but were put into Hare's, who left out Cleckley's core criteria of no significant irrational thinking or anxiety. Hare has written that The Mask <b>of</b> <b>Sanity</b> has such detailed and complex descriptions and speculations that it can support a variety of different interpretations. He suggests it is necessary to interpret it with supporting evidence, though notes that it has virtually no empirical data to enable this.|$|E
25|$|Cleckley {{describes}} the psychopathic person as outwardly a perfect mimic of a normally functioning person, able to mask or disguise the fundamental lack of internal personality structure, an internal chaos {{that results in}} repeatedly purposeful destructive behavior, often more self-destructive than destructive to others. Despite the seemingly sincere, intelligent, even charming external presentation, internally the psychopathic person {{does not have the}} ability to experience genuine emotions. Cleckley questions whether this mask <b>of</b> <b>sanity</b> is voluntarily assumed to intentionally hide the lack of internal structure, but concludes it hides a serious, but yet imprecisely unidentified, semantic neuropsychiatric defect. Six editions of the book were produced in total, the final shortly after his death. An expanded fifth edition of the book had been published in 1976 and was re-released by his heirs in 1988 for non-profit educational use.|$|E
25|$|Technical death metal: Technical death {{metal and}} {{progressive}} death metal are related terms that refer to bands distinguished by {{the complexity of}} their music. Common traits are dynamic song structures, uncommon time signatures, atypical rhythms and unusual harmonies and melodies. Bands described as technical death metal or progressive death metal usually fuse common death metal aesthetics with elements of progressive rock, jazz or classical music. While the term technical death metal is sometimes used to describe bands that focus on speed and extremity as well as complexity, the line between progressive and technical death metal is thin. Tech death and prog death, for short, are terms commonly applied to such bands as Nile, Edge <b>of</b> <b>Sanity,</b> and Opeth. Necrophagist and Spawn of Possession are known for a classical music-influenced death metal style. Death metal pioneers Death also refined their style in a more progressive direction in their final years. Some albums for this subgenre are Hallucinations (1990) by the German band Atrocity and Death's Human (1991). This style has significantly influenced many bands, creating a stream that in Europe was carried out at first by bands such as Gory Blister and Electrocution. The Polish band Decapitated gained recognition as one of Europe's primary modern technical death metal acts.|$|E

Phipps also described the funeral scene as a highlight of the episode, finding that he grew to appreciate its mix of tragic and comic more over repeated viewings. Writing for Allrovi, Andrea LeVasseur rated the episode four stars out of five.|$|E
500|$|Commentators have {{generally}} accepted the trial jury's verdict that the Claimant was Arthur Orton. However, McWilliam cites the monumental study by Douglas Woodruff (1957), {{in which the}} author posits that the Claimant could just possibly have been Roger Tichborne. Woodruff's principal argument is the sheer improbability that anyone could conceive such an imposture from scratch, at such a distance, and then implement it: [...] "t was carrying effrontery beyond the bounds <b>of</b> <b>sanity</b> if Arthur Orton embarked with a wife and retinue and crossed the world, knowing that {{they would all be}} destitute if he did not succeed in convincing a woman he had never met and knew nothing about first-hand, that he was her son".|$|E
50|$|A sanity test or sanity {{check is}} a basic test to quickly {{evaluate}} whether a claim or {{the result of a}} calculation can possibly be true. It is a simple check to see if the produced material is rational (that the material's creator was thinking rationally, applying <b>sanity).</b> The point <b>of</b> a <b>sanity</b> test is to rule out certain classes of obviously false results, not to catch every possible error. A rule-of-thumb may be checked to perform the test. The advantage <b>of</b> a <b>sanity</b> test, over performing a complete or rigorous test, is speed.|$|R

500|$|Critics {{disagreed}} on how [...] "Tom & Gerri" [...] {{compared to}} previous episodes of Inside No. 9. Writing in The Guardian, Mark Jones said that [...] "Tom & Gerri" [...] was the [...] "highlight {{of the series}} so far, with Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton on top form". Pat Stacey, of the Evening Herald, agreed, though considered the previous episodes weak. By contrast, an anonymous reviewer in the Liverpool Echo thought [...] "Sardines" [...] was stronger, but said [...] "Tom & Gerri" [...] was [...] "definitely the creepiest" [...] of the first three, and Chater also disagreed with Jones and Stacey; while he praised the episode as [...] "a sinister tale about the fragile nature <b>of</b> <b>sanity</b> performed by actors who are frighteningly good", he {{felt that it was}} not as strong as earlier installments. Like Chater, Dessau stressed the quality of the acting, praising the performances of both Shearsmith and Pemberton, especially the latter.|$|E
500|$|In 1998, in {{the midst}} of {{setbacks}} during the Nine Lives Tour, the band released the single [...] "I Don't Want to Miss a Thing", the love theme, written by Diane Warren for the 1998 film Armageddon, starring Steven Tyler's daughter Liv. The song became Aerosmith's first and only number 1 single when it debuted at the top position on the Billboard Hot 100 and stayed on top of the charts for four weeks. The song was nominated for an Academy Award in 1999. The song helped open Aerosmith up to a new generation and remains a slow-dance staple. 1998 also saw the release of the double-live album, A Little South <b>of</b> <b>Sanity,</b> which was assembled from performances on the Get a Grip and Nine Lives tours. The album went platinum shortly after its release. The band continued with their seemingly neverending world tours promoting Nine Lives and the [...] "I Don't Want to Miss a Thing" [...] single well into 1999.|$|E
