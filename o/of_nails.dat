Before he became owner of the ironworks, the farmers around Godegård had refined the wrought iron from the factory into large quantities <b>of</b> <b>nails</b> using small trip hammers.

Second, he forbade the farmers and tenant farmers to sell nails to the merchants at Askersund, at that time a center for nail trade. In this way Grill assumed control over all nail trade himself.|$|E
40|$|Single shear {{tests were}} {{conducted}} on nailed timber joints with varying main member thickness, side member thickness and nail length projecting from the main member, and their effects on various shear performances <b>of</b> <b>nailed</b> joints were investigated. Initial stiffness and yield load <b>of</b> <b>nailed</b> joints were almost constant when the ratio of main member thickness to nail diameter (lm/d) was 7 - 14 and 10 - 14, respectively. Maximum load and energy capacity increased as main member thickness was greater and {{showed the highest values}} when lm/d was 13 - 17 and 13 - 15. respectively. Maximum load <b>of</b> <b>nailed</b> joints with lm/d of 9 was 36 % lower than that <b>of</b> <b>nailed</b> joints with lm/d of 13 - 17. Energy capacity <b>of</b> <b>nailed</b> joints with lm/d of 9 was 58 % lower than that <b>of</b> <b>nailed</b> joints with lm/d of 13 - 15. Regardless <b>of</b> <b>nail</b> length projecting from the main member (lnp), initial stiffness <b>of</b> <b>nailed</b> joints with lnp was close to that <b>of</b> <b>nailed</b> joints without lnp. When the ratio of the sum of lm and lnp to nail diameter ratio (lr/d) was 10 - 11, maximum load and energy capacity <b>of</b> <b>nailed</b> joints with lnp were close to those <b>of</b> <b>nailed</b> joints without lnp. When lr/d was 12 - 15, maximum load and energy capacity <b>of</b> <b>nailed</b> joints with lnp were lower than those <b>of</b> <b>nailed</b> joints without lnp. When nailed joints have a member thickness according to the standard for structural design of timber structures edited by Architectural Institute of Japan, initial stiffness and yield load are little affected by member thickness but maximum load and energy capacity are greatly affected by member thickness. 主材と側材の厚さや主材からの釘の突き出し長さが 1 面せん断釘接合部のせん断性能に及ぼす影響を調べた。剛性係数は主材中の釘長さと釘径の比（lm/d）が 7 ～ 14 のとき概ね一定の値を示し、その後lm/dが大きくなるにつれ減少する傾向を示した。降伏荷重はlm/dが大きくなるにつれ増加し、lm/dが 10 ～ 14 のときに一定、その後lm/dが大きくなるにつれ減少する傾向を示した。最大荷重と吸収エネルギーはlm/dが大きくなるにつれ増加し、lm/dが 13 ～ 17 のとき最大荷重が、lm/dが 13 ～ 15 のとき吸収エネルギーが最も大きな値を示した。主材からの釘の突き出し長さにかかわらず剛性係数は概ね一定の値を示した。釘の突き出し長さが長い接合部の最大荷重と吸収エネルギーは突き出していない接合部より低い値となった。日本建築学会の木質構造設計規準・同解説に準じ、主材中の釘長さが釘径の 9 倍以上、側材厚が釘径の 6 倍以上であるとき、釘接合部の剛性係数と降伏荷重には大きな変化は見られないが、最大荷重と吸収エネルギーは部材の厚さによって大きな差が生じた...|$|R

Pike returned from the injury and had the Bearcats leading at halftime, but he left the game at the half when numbness in his non-throwing hand prevented him from being able to take the snap. In the two weeks that followed the loss to the Huskies, Cincinnati recovered to beat two top-25 opponents: No. 23 South Florida and No. 20 West Virginia.

Encouraged by the proximity of outcrops of coal, iron was brought from Derbyshire, Yorkshire and Spain. A variety <b>of</b> <b>nails</b> were made, lath nails, slate nails, thatching nails and sparrowbills. The nail smithies manufactured ploughs and scythes; their products were taken by pack horse to be sold in Manchester, Denbigh, Clitheroe and Kendal. The nail industry developed into the manufacture of nuts and bolts. Thomas Blakemore {{was the first in}} 1843 and by 1853 there were eight makers of nuts and bolts including James Prestwich and Robert Parker. Some manufacturers of nuts and bolts made spindles and flyers for spinning machinery. Collier Brook Bolt Works on Bag Lane dating from 1856 survives and is a Grade II listed building.|$|E

30|$|Nail-head pull-through, lateral nail resistance, {{and single}} shear nailed joint tests were {{conducted}} on medium density fiberboard (MDF) with different density profiles, and {{the relations between the}} results of these tests and the density profiles of MDF were investigated. The maximum load of nail-head pull-through and the maximum load <b>of</b> <b>nailed</b> joints were little affected by the density profile. However, the ultimate strength <b>of</b> lateral <b>nail</b> resistance, the stiffness, and the yield strength <b>of</b> <b>nailed</b> joints were affected by the density profile of MDF and showed high values when the surface layer of the MDF had high density. It is known that bending performance is also influenced by density profile. Therefore, the stiffness and the yield strength <b>of</b> <b>nailed</b> joints were compared with the bending performance of MDF. The stiffness <b>of</b> <b>nailed</b> joints was positively correlated with the modulus of elasticity (MOE); in the case <b>of</b> CN 65 <b>nails,</b> the initial stiffness of joints changed little in response to changes in MOE.

40|$|Nail biting is {{a common}} oral habit, which is usually {{considered}} as developmental and harmless. In severe cases, from a health perspective, nail biting may lead to health problems such as skin infections or minor tissue damage, dental issues, bacterial infection, and alveolar destruction.

In terms of causes and treatment measures for nail biting, there has been an extreme lack of research evidence, especially in the medical literature. In an attempt to cast more light on this under-investigated issue <b>of</b> <b>nail</b> biting, the present study was conducted with a special focus on its possible causes, associated health problems and treatment methods from the perspective <b>of</b> <b>nail</b> biters, parents <b>of</b> <b>nail</b> biting children and health professionals.

Objective: To study overall pattern <b>of</b> <b>nail</b> involvement in psoriatic patients along with making a comparison between the patterns <b>of</b> <b>nail</b> changes on finger and toenails and to analyze the association <b>of</b> <b>nail</b> changes with arthropathy and Koebner&#x 00 E 2;&#x 20 AC;s phenomenon. Subjects and settings: One hundred consecutive cases of psoriasis of all age and both sexes were selected for studying the nail changes, in whom diagnosis of psoriasis was made on clinical parameters. KOH preparation was also performed in all cases where onychomycosis was considered a possibility. Results: Thirty six Percent of patients <b>of</b> psoriasis had <b>nail</b> change and fingernails (32 &#x 0025;) were more commonly affected than toe nails (24 &#x 0025;). Pitting {{was found to be}} the most common manifestation in fingernails (65. 63 &#x 0025;) with significant difference between fingernails and toenails (p< 0. 001). The frequency <b>of</b> <b>nail</b> changes in psoriasis with joint pain was 73. 33 &#x 0025; whereas 29. 41 &#x 0025; in those without joint pain. Chi-square test with Yates correction for the association <b>of</b> <b>nail</b> changes with joint pain gave p value < 0. 005 and for the association <b>of</b> <b>nail</b> changes with koebner&#x 00 E 2;&#x 20 AC;s phenomenon p value < 0. 05.

Earlier, the ink mark was applied on the cuticle but with effect from February 01, 2006 the ink is applied on the voter′s left index fingernail from the distal end proximally until the cuticle using an applicator. This idea of the ink mark applied during elections {{was used as a}} simple tool to measure the rate <b>of</b> <b>nail</b> growth in a busy outpatient department of a Tertiary Hospital in South India. Aims: To assess the feasibility of using the ink mark during elections as a method of obtaining data <b>of</b> <b>nail</b> growth across the spectrum of the entire country.
