5|$|The player {{controls}} Neku {{by performing}} touchscreen actions {{based on the}} currently equipped pins. These actions may include slashing across an enemy, tapping the screen rapidly to fire bullets, holding down on an enemy to inflict damage or shouting into the microphone to cause a full screen attack. <b>Other</b> <b>pins</b> need to be touched to activate them, such as for health restoration. Each pin has {{a limited number of}} uses before it must recharge for a certain time. <b>Other</b> <b>pins</b> may only be used a fixed number of times during a series of battles, and do not recharge until the battle sequence is over. Neku can only be equipped with a maximum of two pins at the game's start; this can eventually be upgraded to a maximum of six.|$|E

25|$|The female XLR {{connectors}} {{are designed}} to first connect pin 1 (the earth pin), before the <b>other</b> <b>pins</b> make contact, when a male XLR connector is inserted. With the ground connection established before the signal lines are connected, the insertion (and removal) of XLR connectors in live equipment is possible without picking up external signals (as usually happens with, for example, RCA connectors).|$|E

25|$|While one cannot always {{identify}} the position/job of a soldier, two optional factors help make this identification: an aiguillette {{attached to the}} left shoulder strap and shirt pocket, and a pin indicating the soldier's work type (usually given by a professional course). <b>Other</b> <b>pins</b> may indicate the corps or additional courses taken. Finally, an optional battle pin indicates a war that a soldier has fought in.|$|E
25|$|There is {{an optimal}} bowling ball {{speed at which}} the player maximizes the chance to knock down all ten bowling pins. Optimal ball speed, which {{is defined as the}} time it takes for the ball to travel from one foot past the foul line to the head pin, is 2.3 seconds (this number can shift to 2.2 or 2.4 {{depending}} on the dryness or slickness of the lane). A ball that is rolled too fast will not give the pins enough time to “mix” with <b>other</b> <b>pins,</b> or in other words, to knock each other down in a domino effect motion. Conversely, a ball rolled too slowly will deflect too much and {{will not be able to}} knock down all the pins.|$|E
25|$|The front pin {{is known}} as the 'King' and is painted with a white, one and a half inch wide {{vertical}} stripe. The two pins to either side are known as the 'Quarter pins' and are marked with either a triangle or the numbers 1 and 2, in order to identify them. Traditionally the 'King' is the heaviest pin, with the 'Quarters' being heavier {{than the rest of the}} pins but not heavier than the 'King'. Directly behind the 'King' is the middle pin which {{is known as}} the 'Birdie', as the <b>other</b> <b>pins</b> form a 'cage' around it. The back pin sits directly behind the 'Birdie', the 'Back quarters' directly behind the 'Quarter' pins, and the 'Wingers' on the outside of the diamond. The 'Birdie', 'Back Quarters', 'Back Pin' and 'Wingers' are non-specific pins and are not marked so any of the six unmarked pins can be placed on any of the six plates.|$|E

5000|$|This split is {{basically}} the Baby split with the opposite corner pin. The player should ignore that [...] "opposite" [...] pin and play the Baby split between the pins. With luck, the front pin {{will be able to}} slide over to get the <b>other</b> <b>pin.</b>|$|R
50|$|The cliffhanger was {{originally}} going {{to consist of}} Apollo, Tyrol, Cally, and <b>others</b> <b>pinned</b> down by Cylons in a temple on Kobol. The idea was abandoned due to budget constraints. Also, Roslin was going to still be barricaded in her office at the time Adama is shot.|$|R
25|$|In Worcester {{skittles}} all pins {{are live}} until they {{land in the}} pit behind the diamond, or leave the alley on an open side. They can rebound off a side wall back into the diamond taking down <b>other</b> <b>pin(s).</b> In some alleys, such as the Saracens Head in Worcester, the Diamond is flanked by two side walls making {{the possibility of a}} spare, achieved by bouncing pins off the wall more of a possibility. It is more than common to hear the cries of 'let it roll' go out in the alleys of the city to stop an over enthusiastic 'sticker up' (a young lad or girl employed to put the pins back up after they have been knocked down) removing a pin from the alley before it has finished knocking down the others. However, if a ball hits the cush, or wall or passes through the diamond and bounces back out of the pit before felling pins the frame must be reset.|$|E
2500|$|BS1363 sockets {{must have}} {{shutters}} on the [...] and neutral contacts {{to prevent the}} insertion of a foreign object into the socket. Many sockets use the original method of shutters opened by the earth pin (or plastic ISOD), longer than the <b>other</b> <b>pins</b> and hence opening the shutters before the <b>other</b> <b>pins</b> engage, alone. [...] Alternatively, shutters may be opened by simultaneous insertion of [...] and neutral pins. [...] Some later designs require all three pins to be inserted simultaneously. [...] The use of automatic shutters for protection dates back to at least 1927. [...] Other countries, for example the USA, are gradually requiring their sockets to be protected by shutters also.|$|E
2500|$|Duck:In front first {{skittles}} {{the dreaded}} duck {{comes into play}} more often than in all-in skittles. This is where the front pin remains standing after one's 'up' despite any <b>other</b> <b>pins</b> being felled. This 'up' is recorded as a 'duck' or zero score towards one's total and is usually marked with a cross or an asterisk. Finishing a game with only ducks recorded is considered a big faux-pas! ...|$|E

50|$|The ECU {{interfaces}} {{with the}} rest of the system via a 40-pin connector. When observing the connector on the ECU box itself, with the thumb latch on the left, the numbering for the connector's pins starts at 1 in the lower left-hand corner. The pin numbering continues to the right, then in an S-shape through the two <b>other</b> <b>pin</b> rows.|$|R
2500|$|A {{few simple}} devices permit {{knitting}} without needles for toy or hobby purposes. [...] The simplest {{of these is}} spool knitting, followed by knitting boards or knitting looms, which consist of two rows of pins mounted in two parallel rows approximately [...] apart. Yarn is wound around the pins; various patterns of winding produce different textured knitting. A needle or special tool is then used to transfer the loops of yarn from around the pins, either off the pins or to <b>other</b> <b>pins,</b> to produce the knitting. Knitting boards can produce complex designs. Other semi-mechanical knitting devices are available.|$|E
2500|$|The {{objective}} in spinning is to depend more on pin deflection (pins hitting <b>other</b> <b>pins)</b> than [...] "carry" [...] (the ball knocking down the pins.) For a right-handed bowler, the ball proceeds down the lane, usually using a left-to-right line, and strikes {{the right side}} of the 1-pin. At this point, the ball will proceed to move down the front row of pins in the direction opposite its spin - the 1-3-6-10 pins. This type of a hit is referred to as [...] "riding the rail" [...] among spinners. A properly thrown spinner will hit the pocket in a way as if the ball was spinning away from the 1-pin. Conventional bowlers who watch this type of spin will actually think the bowler threw a backup ball. As the ball moves down the row, it creates a domino effect. The 1-pin hits the 2-4-7, the 3-pin hits the 5-8 the 6-pin hits the 9, and the ball eventually hits the 10-pin alone. Even when the ball hits Brooklyn, the reversal of direction allows even more ball and pin deflection (known as [...] "mixing"), allowing a higher chance of messenger strikes.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Miss Ellen, [...] "you are not useless, for you two shall sit {{together}} {{in my new}} cushion, a warning to me, {{as well as to}} the <b>other</b> <b>pins,</b> to choose the right way in time, and wear out with doing our duty, rather than rust out as so many do. Thank you, Granny, for your little lecture. I will not forget it, but go at once and find that poor girl, and help her all I can. Rest here, you good old soul, and teach these little things to follow your example." ...|$|E
50|$|Pin {{insulators}} are one {{of three}} types of overhead insulators, the others being Strain insulators and Suspension insulators. Unlike the <b>others,</b> <b>pin</b> insulators are directly connected to the physical support compared to being suspended from the wire. Pin insulators are shaped to allow the secure attachment of the conducting wire and avoid it coming adrift. The wire is usually attached to the insulator by being wrapped around it or in other circumstances, fixed into grooves on the insulator itself.|$|R

"Then {{you might}} move {{the north end}} of the card until the shadow is brought exactly into the middle of the card, and then put the <b>other</b> <b>pin</b> in, and fix it in that place. Then if you make a mark along where the shadow comes, that mark will be a north and south line, and you can mark the place where the shadow of the pin's head crosses that line, when it crosses it every day at noon." ...|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{overview}} of the temperature, field and angular dependence of the irreversible magnetization of non-magnetic borocarbides (Y;Lu) Ni 2 B 2 C. We show that nonlocal electrodynamics influences pinning via the unusual behavior of the shear modulus in non-hexagonal lattices. On top of that, we observe that the pinning force density Fp exhibits a rich anisotropic behavior that sharply contrasts with its small mass anisotropy. When H⊥c, Fp is much larger and has a quite different H dependence, indicating that <b>other</b> <b>pinning</b> mechanisms are present...|$|R

2500|$|To {{avoid the}} safety issues, Karl Albert, then {{director}} at the Krefeld Tramway, developed the Albert coupler during 1921, a key and slot [...] coupler with two pins. Cars to be coupled were pushed together, both couplings moving to the same side. One pin was inserted, then the cars were pulled to straighten the coupling and the <b>other</b> <b>pin</b> inserted. This operation required less exact shunting. Due to the single piece design, only minimal slack was possible. The system became quite popular with tram systems and narrow gauge lines.|$|R
50|$|Charlieplexing {{can also}} be used to {{multiplex}} digital input signals into a microcontroller. The same diode circuits are used, except a switch is placed in series with each diode. To read whether a switch is open or closed, the microcontroller configures one pin as an input with an internal pull-up resistor. The <b>other</b> <b>pin</b> is configured as an output and set to the low logic level. If the input pin reads low, then the switch is closed, and if the input pin reads high, then the switch is open.|$|R

50|$|The PBI is {{implemented}} as a rectangular 50-pin edge connector {{on the back}} of XL machines. The pins include all 16 address lines (A0 through A15) and 8 data lines (D0 through D7). <b>Other</b> <b>pins</b> include various electrical supplies, clock signals, interrupts, memory strobes, and even an analog audio input.|$|E
50|$|Early {{microcontrollers}} {{often have}} some pins {{that can only}} act as an input, <b>other</b> <b>pins</b> that can only act as a push-pull output, and a few pins that can only act as an open collector input/output.

50|$|The player, using spin, {{launches}} {{the ball}} onto either {{the left or}} right long incline and to achieve a valid throw, has to knock over at least the small pin and one large pin.

5000|$|Like {{most other}} Turnera, this species is heterostylous, with two morphs. The [...] "pin" [...] morph has long styles in its flowers, while the [...] "thrum" [...] morph has short styles. Both morphs {{produce the same}} amount of pollen. One study {{reported}} that during pollination, pin flowers receive more pollen from thrum flowers than from <b>other</b> <b>pin</b> flowers. The genes that cause this dimorphism in style size are the subject of current research. So far, it has been established that short styles contain proteins, polygalacturonases, that are absent in long styles.|$|R
