5|$|George Went Hensley (May 2, 1881 – July 25, 1955) was an American Pentecostal {{minister}} {{best known}} for popularizing the practice of snake handling.

5|$|Based on the {{theories}} of his predecessors, Zhang Heng systematically developed the celestial sphere theory. An armillary constructed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hypotheses bears a remarkable similarity to Ptolemy's earth-centered theory. However, Zhang Heng did not definitely propose a theoretical model like Ptolemy's earth-centered one. It is astonishing that the celestial model Zhang Heng constructed was almost a physical model of Ptolemy's earth-centered theory. Only a single step separates the celestial globe from the earth-centered theory, but Chinese astronomers never took that step.|$|E

5|$|Born in London {{and raised}} largely in Brighton, Grinsell {{developed}} an early interest in archaeology through visits to Brighton Museum. Later {{working as a}} bank clerk in London, he embarked on archaeological research in an amateur capacity, visiting prehistoric barrows during his weekends and holidays in order to record their shape, dimensions, and location. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> research, he published a range of academic articles and {{books on the subject}} of barrows during the 1930s, gaining recognition as Britain's foremost expert on the subject.

While some of Druitt's biographers claim his practice did not flourish, others suppose that it provided him with a relatively substantial income <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> costly lease of chambers and the value of his estate at death. He is listed in the Law List of 1886 as active in the Western Circuit and Winchester Sessions, and for 1887 in the Western Circuit and Hampshire, Portsmouth and Southampton Assizes.|$|E

5|$|Epic {{poetry is}} a genre of poetry, {{and a major}} form of {{narrative}} literature. This genre is often defined as lengthy poems concerning events of a heroic or important nature {{to the culture of}} the time. It recounts, in a continuous narrative, the life and works of a heroic or mythological person or group of persons. Examples of epic poems are Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, Virgil's Aeneid, the Nibelungenlied, Luís de Camões' Os Lusíadas, the Cantar de Mio Cid, the Epic of Gilgamesh, the Mahabharata, Valmiki's Ramayana, Ferdowsi's Shahnama, Nizami (or Nezami)'s Khamse (Five Books), and the Epic of King Gesar. While the composition of epic poetry, and of long poems generally, became less common in the west after the early 20th century, some notable epics have continued to be written. Derek Walcott won a Nobel prize to a great extent <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> epic, Omeros.|$|E
5|$|Ernst {{had been}} a canon at Cologne since 1570. He {{had the support of}} the {{neighboring}} Duke of Jülich and several allies within the Cathedral Chapter. Although supported by both the papacy and his influential father, a 1571 effort to secure for him the office of coadjutor of the electorate of Cologne had failed once Salentin had agreed to abide by the Trentine proceedings; as the coadjutor bishop, Ernst would have been well-positioned to present himself as Salentin's logical successor. Since then, however, he had advanced in other sees, becoming bishop of Liège, Freising and Hildesheim, important strongholds of Counter-Reformation Catholicism. He was a career cleric, not necessarily qualified to be an archbishop <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> theological erudition, but by his family connections. His membership in several chapters extended the family influence, and his status as a prebendary gave him a portion of revenues from several cathedrals. He had been educated by Jesuits and the papacy considered collaboration with his family as a means to limit the spread of Lutheranism and Calvinism in the northern provinces.|$|E

5|$|Fermi had {{the idea}} to resort to {{replacing}} the polonium-beryllium neutron source with a radon-beryllium one, which he created by filling a glass bulb with beryllium powder, evacuating the air, and then adding 50 mCi of radon gas, supplied by Giulio Cesare Trabacchi. This created a much stronger neutron source, the effectiveness of which declined with the 3.8-day half-life of radon. He knew that this source would also emit gamma rays, but, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> theory, he believed that this would not affect {{the results of the}} experiment. He started by bombarding platinum, an element with a high atomic number that was readily available, without success. He turned to aluminium, which emitted an alpha particle and produced sodium, which then decayed into magnesium by beta particle emission. He tried lead, without success, and then fluorine in the form of calcium fluoride, which emitted an alpha particle and produced nitrogen, decaying into oxygen by beta particle emission. In all, he induced radioactivity in 22 different elements. Fermi rapidly reported the discovery of neutron-induced radioactivity in the Italian journal La Ricerca Scientifica on 25 March 1934.|$|E
5|$|For George III, Pitt's {{appointment}} {{was a great}} victory. It proved {{that he was able}} to appoint Prime Ministers <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own interpretation of the public mood without having to follow the choice of the current majority in the House of Commons. Throughout Pitt's ministry, George supported many of Pitt's political aims and created new peers at an unprecedented rate to increase the number of Pitt's supporters in the House of Lords. During and after Pitt's ministry, George III was extremely popular in Britain. The British people admired him for his piety, and for remaining faithful to his wife. He was fond of his children, and was devastated at the death of two of his sons in infancy in 1782 and 1783 respectively. Nevertheless, he set his children a strict regimen. They were expected to attend rigorous lessons from seven in the morning, and to lead lives of religious observance and virtue. When his children strayed from George's own principles of righteousness, as his sons did as young adults, he was dismayed and disappointed.|$|E
5|$|His {{expedition}} completed after a {{total of}} 17 months, Beebe and Blair crossed the Pacific to San Francisco, then crossed the United States {{to return to their}} home in New York. Their expedition had obtained live or stuffed specimens of nearly all the pheasants he had sought, and also produced extensive notes about their behavior. Some of these pheasants, such as Sclater's impeyan or Himalayan monal, had never before been seen in the wild by Americans or Europeans. Beebe's observations of sexual dimorphism in pheasants during this expedition led him to become the first biologist to correctly understand the mechanism by which this aspect of sexual selection operates. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> observations he also proposed a new evolutionary model of pheasant ancestry, involving a period of rapid diversification followed by more typical and gradual changes. Although this evolutionary model is now taken for granted, in William Beebe's time it was a novel idea.|$|E

Hugh also worked to improve the educational level of this clergy, even refusing to allow some candidates to benefices to be installed because of their lack of education. The bishop also worked to improve the conditions of the poorer clergy in his diocese, attempting to ensure that all the clergy in his diocese had enough to live on. Previously, it was thought that Hugh had sent out a set of articles of inquiry to his diocesan clergy, but these articles are now shown to have been produced by Hugh's successor, Robert Grosseteste.|$|E
5|$|In 1964 Driberg {{published}} a critical study of Moral Re-armament, which brought him attacks from the movement <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> homosexuality and communist past. Although he made money from this book, throughout the 1960s he was beset by financial problems. When Reynolds News, which had {{evolved into the}} Sunday Citizen, finally folded in 1967, he became fully dependent on his parliamentary salary and casual journalism. He had long considered selling Bradwell Lodge, preferably to the National Trust on a basis {{that would allow him}} to continue living there. However, the Trust required the property to be mortgage-free and endowed with a substantial fund to cover future repairs, neither of which terms could be arranged. In the event the house remained unsold until 1971. As the 1970 election approached, Driberg wished to retire from parliament, and asked Wilson to appoint him as ambassador to the Vatican. Wilson refused, citing Driberg's age—at 65 he was beyond the retirement age for senior diplomats. Against his will, but with few other sources of income available to him, Driberg fought the June 1970 General Election. He was returned for Barking with a comfortable though reduced majority; nationally, Wilson's government was defeated by Edward Heath's Conservatives.|$|E
5|$|Supporters among Ravalomanana's {{high-level}} Tiko staff {{established a}} group to promote his campaign, which he named Tiako Iarivo ("I Love Antananarivo"). The candidate spent over 700 million Malagasy francs on the campaign, drawn from the proceeds of his business and private donations. His campaign staff widely distributed promotional posters featuring the candidate's face, name and slogan, and handed out free Tiko yogurts and boxes of milk to the public. Ravalomanana's campaign posters often featured the Tiko logo and images of the candidate riding a bicycle laden with milk canisters to play on his image as a simple and poor farmer who, through intelligence, determination and responsible management, succeeded in developing a thriving business and would apply these same skills to develop the capital city. The Ravalomanana campaign received support <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> evident success as a manager, his leadership in the Christian community and his non-alignment with Ratsiraka's AREMA party, {{as well as his}} relative youthfulness and physical attractiveness to female voters.

40|$|Abstract Aesthetics {{paradox is}} one of the ways of defamiliarization and {{creating}} language aesthetics and is not related to concepts, but it contains vocables which contradict somehow (Vahidian, 1376 : 284). In aesthetic paradox, the poets can convey themselves in a simple way, for example, instead of "Atash dar Atash Zadan", "Nabood Kardan Atash", "Azad bodan Asiir" "Azad bodan Asheg”, “Tagreebe jodaiee”, “fararesidan jodaiee" and "jameh Parishan" instead of "gorohe parishan". They often conveyed this through paradox to stimulate the readers. By this the reader tries to get the fact beyond this. The reader tries to enjoy from discovering this fact and store that in his mind. The paradox can be divided into two parts structurely 1 -     Exional e. g: Bikhabar Ra Saheebe Khabar Danestan", "Bishee Rar Dar Kamii Danestan" 2 -     Syntactical e. g. : "Rahee BiRahii", "Zabane Bizabanie”   1. Paradox through exion: Sometimes paradox in the concept of one verse or one half verse {{is in the form of}} exions. Such images, in comparison to syntactic paradox has more artistic value. Most aesthetics paradoxes in Persian Literature are exional. Exional paradox is divided into seven kinds. 1. 1.            <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> Metaphor 1. 2.            <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> simile / Analogy 1. 3.            <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> kenning 1. 4.            <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> allegory 1. 5.            <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> two- sided images 1. 6.            <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> ambiguity 1. 7.            <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> Rhetoric These rhetorical and figurative language practices are inherently beautiful but when they are conveyed through paradox, their effects are increased several times.   1. 1. <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> Metaphor In this type of contradiction, view of aesthetics mosta’ar is chosen to be in contradiction with a word in poetry and by eliminating moshabah-on-beh, contradiction is clear: (Given example – Hafeez 1835 : 192) 1. 2. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> simile: In this type of contradictory view such vehicle is chosen to be in contradiction with the word poetry and with the removal of this vehicle, contradiction is clear. (Given example- Khaganie, 1367 : 699).   2. Paradox in the form of syntactic In this rhetorical art two sides of one coin of a combination violate each other in terms of the concept (Shaffiee- 1370 : 37 for example aabe khoshk, atashe abdar, …. In these combinations, there are paradox and contradiction in term of concepts. Although such contradictions are fault in the Logic, they are excellent in Persian Literature. This type of application is frequent. Synthetic paradoxes are also seven kinds. 2. 1. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> Metaphor 2. 2. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> simile / Analogy 2. 3. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> kenning 2. 4. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> allegory 2. 5. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> two- sided images 2. 6. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> ambiguity 2. 7. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> Rhetoric   2. 1. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> Allegory Here it is allowed to put the synonymous instead of a word. This synonym is in contradiction with that word in one concept, but in central meaning has consistency. For e. g. jogdea Homayon (Saee 1375, first vol. 258)   2. 2. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> two- sided images In this exponential contradictory of aesthetic, these vehicles are chosen in the way that they create paradox in poetry and by eliminating them, this contradiction is clear (Given example, Khaganii, 1367 : 368) ...|$|R
