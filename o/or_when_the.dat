Originally these reminders were specific to the device Cortana was installed on, but since Windows 10 Microsoft synchronises reminders across devices.|$|E
5|$|Gastrointestinal upset {{can cause}} severe discomfort; {{it is most}} common when {{metformin}} is first administered, <b>or</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> dose is increased. The discomfort can often be avoided by beginning at a low dose (1.0 to 1.7grams per day) and increasing the dose gradually but even with low doses 5% of people {{may be unable to}} tolerate metformin. Use of slow- or extended-release preparations may improve tolerability.|$|E

50|$|A {{quantitative}} study seeks to learn where, <b>or</b> <b>when,</b> so <b>the</b> writer’s research must {{be directed at}} determining <b>the</b> where, <b>or</b> <b>when</b> of <b>the</b> research topic. Therefore, when crafting a research question for a {{quantitative study}}, the writer will need to ask a where, <b>or</b> <b>when</b> question about <b>the</b> topic. For example: Where should the company market its new product? Unlike a qualitative study, a quantitative study is mathematical analysis of the research topic, so the writer’s research will consist of numbers and statistics.|$|R

5|$|Thus, a {{political}} wire-puller such as Grigori Rasputin enjoys power best when playing off another person's hereditary power, <b>or</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> organisation benefits largely from {{an air of}} mystery.

5|$|Bynesian decay usually starts when {{specimens}} {{are stored}} or displayed for considerable {{periods of time}} in an enclosed space. The storage method itself usually causes this problem, when containers, cabinets or display cases are entirely or partially made of wood, plywood or other wood products such as Masonite, <b>or</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> specimens are surrounded by, or in contact with, various other kinds of materials that are cellulose-based and can turn water vapor acidic.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Wily's Revenge reuses and mixes stage components, enemies, and robot masters {{from the}} first two NES games in the Mega Man series. The initial four stages and bosses (Cut Man, Ice Man, Fire Man, and Elec Man) come from the {{original}} Mega Man. A password system allows the player {{to return to the}} game after any or all of these first four stages are cleared <b>or</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> player suffers a game over. Once the player completes these stages and travels through Wily's fortress, four more robot masters must be fought in order to progress. These bosses (Quick Man, Bubble Man, Flash Man, and Heat Man) are taken from Mega Man 2 for NES. Although they do not have their own stages, the player earns the special weapons of these bosses. Once all four are defeated, the player faces a new robot master created for the game, Enker.|$|E

5|$|Hero. A {{version of}} the team deathmatch where a hero is {{randomly}} selected on both sides for one minute, or until the hero dies. The hero gets a health boost, damage boost, and every weapon in the game (which the hero can keep if he survives the one minute). The key difference between Hero and TDM is that in TDM all enemy kills are counted to the team total whereas in Hero, only when killing the Hero <b>or</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Hero kills an enemy are they counted towards the total.|$|E
5|$|However, Thio Li-ann {{believes}} that it is undesirable that {{the law does not}} impose a timeframe for the calling of by-elections. If a by-election is not called promptly upon a parliamentary seat falling vacant, the electors in the GRC in question will be represented to a lesser extent. This is particularly pertinent where more than one MP vacates his or her seat <b>or</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> seat vacated is that of a minority candidate. Should the latter situation arise, the rationale behind the GRC scheme – to guarantee minority representation in Parliament – would be defeated.|$|E
5|$|Mad Max is a post-apocalyptic action-adventure game {{emphasizing}} vehicular combat, {{in which}} the player is the eponymous Mad Max (Bren Foster). According to its publisher, up to 60 percent of the game focuses on driving. Some weapons and tools, including flamethrowers and turbo boosts, are mounted directly onto the Magnum Opus, while others, such as a grappling hook and sniper rifle, are {{used in conjunction with}} the vehicle by Chumbucket, Max's assistant, or Max himself. Max's Magnum Opus, with its V8 engine and powerful ramming ability, can destroy enemies' vehicles and weaponry. When simultaneously driving and aiming, the game changes to slow motion to allow the player to toggle between targets. Although Mad Max primarily uses a third-person perspective, the player can switch to first-person view when fighting enemies while driving the Magnum Opus. Chumbucket repairs the car when instructed to do so <b>or</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> player exits.|$|E

5|$|Pokémon Red and Blue {{take place}} in the region of Kanto. This is one {{distinct}} region shown in later games, with different geographical habitats for the 151 existing Pokémon species, along with human-populated towns and cities, and Routes connecting locations with one another. Some areas are only accessible once the player learns a special ability or gains a special item. Areas in which the player can catch Pokémon range from caves to the sea, where the kinds of Pokémon available to catch varies. For example, Tentacool can only be caught either through fishing <b>or</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> player is in a body of water, while Zubat can only be caught in a cave.|$|E
5|$|Red-tailed black {{cockatoos}} are diurnal, raucous and noisy, and {{are often}} seen flying high overhead in small flocks, sometimes mixed with other cockatoos. Flocks of up to 500birds are generally only seen in the north <b>or</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> birds are concentrated at some food source. Otherwise, they are generally rather shy of humans. In northern and central Australia, birds may feed on the ground, while the two southern subspecies, graptogyne and naso, are almost exclusively arboreal. They tend to fly rather slowly with intermittent deep flapping wingbeats, markedly different from the shallow wingbeats of the similar glossy black cockatoo. They also often fly at considerable height.|$|E
5|$|Rumination {{syndrome}} is diagnosed {{based on a}} complete history of the individual. Costly and invasive studies such as gastroduodenal manometry and esophageal Ph testing are unnecessary and will often aid in misdiagnosis. Based on typical observed features, several criteria have been suggested for diagnosing rumination syndrome. The primary symptom, the regurgitation of recently ingested food, must be consistent, occurring for at least sixweeks of the past twelve months. The regurgitation must begin within 30minutes of {{the completion of a}} meal. Patients may either chew the regurgitated matter or expel it. The symptoms must stop within 90minutes, <b>or</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> regurgitated matter becomes acidic. The symptoms must not be the result of a mechanical obstruction, and should not respond to the standard treatment for gastroesophageal reflux disease.|$|E

5|$|Since {{dance is}} already an art form, “weapon dance as art” may seem redundant; yet, “art” is used here {{to mean the}} re-creation, say, of a folk weapon dance in a more {{professional}} staged venue, such as a ballet, or when an Australian, Native American, or African troupe of professional musicians and dancers present a reenactment on stage of a weapon dance, <b>or</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> use of weapons is introduced in stylized dance enactments of fighting. For example, recent ballets such as the New York City Ballet’s version of Romeo and Juliet (to the music of Sergei Prokofiev) employ highly choreographed sword-fight/dance sequences.|$|E
5|$|Termites {{going through}} {{incomplete}} metamorphosis {{on the path}} to becoming alates form a subcaste in certain species of termite, functioning as potential supplementary reproductives. These supplementary reproductives only mature into primary reproductives upon the death of a king or queen, <b>or</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> primary reproductives are separated from the colony. Supplementaries have the ability to replace a dead primary reproductive, and there may also be more than a single supplementary within a colony. Some queens have the ability to switch from sexual reproduction to asexual reproduction. Studies show that while termite queens mate with the king to produce colony workers, the queens reproduce their replacements (neotenic queens) parthenogenetically.|$|E
5|$|The Sun's {{color is}} white, with a CIE color-space index near (0.3, 0.3), {{when viewed from}} space <b>or</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Sun is high in the sky. When {{measuring}} all the photons emitted, the Sun is actually emitting more photons in the green portion of the spectrum than any other. When the Sun is low in the sky, atmospheric scattering renders the Sun yellow, red, orange, or magenta. Despite its typical whiteness, most people mentally picture the Sun as yellow; {{the reasons for this}} are the subject of debate.|$|E

5|$|The {{central nervous}} system {{consists}} of a brain and paired ventral nerve cords that connect to the brain and run {{along the length of}} the body. The brain is a ring of four ganglia, masses of nerve cells, positioned round the rhynchocoel near its front end – while the brains of most protostome invertebrates encircle the foregut. Most nemertean species have just one pair of nerve cords, many species have additional paired cords, and some species also have a dorsal cord. In some species the cords lie within the skin, but in most they are deeper, inside the muscle layers. The {{central nervous system}} is often red or pink because it contains hemoglobin. This stores oxygen for peak activity <b>or</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> animal experiences anoxia, for example while burrowing in oxygen-free sediments.|$|E
5|$|The film {{continues}} to be appreciated for its experimental nature, its camera angles and montage elements being treated in an unusual manner, while the fiction elements of the screenplay hint of magic realism. In this sense, {{it is important to}} mention that the days in the film are separated by Andrei's erotic dreams. In his dreams, the differences between him and Marilena are partially removed, either by lowering the rooftop on which the boy stands to ground level or by debarking the girl from a breast-shaped UFO that scares the neighbors away. Another fictional element is Marilena's capacity of provoking short circuits, in moments in which she is very emotionally active (e.g., when Andrei touches her in the bar's restroom, <b>or</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> whole neighborhood is cut from electricity when she cries near the high voltage electrical box).|$|E

When raising a flag to be flown at half-mast, it should first be raised {{to the top of}} the pole and then lowered to a point where the distance between the top of the flag and the top of the pole is one third of the length of the pole. When lowering the flag from half-mast, it should first be raised to the peak of the pole before it is lowered.|$|E
