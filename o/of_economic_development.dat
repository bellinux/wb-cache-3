5|$|After {{graduating from}} the University of Kentucky in 1959, Patton became wealthy {{operating}} coal mines for 20years.

5|$|Another reason exports {{cannot be}} {{promoted}} is because in all likelihood, an underdeveloped country {{may only be}} skilled enough to promote the export of primary goods, say agricultural goods. However, since such commodities face inelastic demand, {{the extent to which}} they will sell in the market is limited. Although when population is at a rise, additional demand for exports may be created, Nurkse implicitly assumed that developed countries are operating at the replacement rate of population growth. For Nurkse, then, exports as a means <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>development</b> are completely ruled out.|$|E

40|$|Summary. This paper {{addresses}} the theory–policy interface <b>of</b> local <b>economic</b> <b>development.</b> It traces the transmission chain through which academic knowledge on competitive city-regions is developed, formalised and institutionalised in local <b>economic</b> <b>development</b> theory and practice. The major thrust {{of this paper}} critically examines the increasingly influential role of academic consultants in shaping local <b>economic</b> <b>development</b> policy. In particular, it {{addresses the}} extent to which these experts directly influence policy formulation in case studies of Cardiff and Liverpool. Another dimension is the use of experts by local authorities, the reasons for selecting certain names and not others, and {{the extent to which}} their work helps to frame the context <b>of</b> local <b>economic</b> <b>development</b> policy. The paper ends by offering some comments on the relationship between the theory and practice <b>of</b> local <b>economic</b> <b>development,</b> and the similarity <b>of</b> local <b>economic</b> <b>development</b> policy approaches in Cardiff and Liverpool...|$|R
5|$|In July 2009, Democratic {{governor}} Bill Ritter named Marostica, a Republican, to {{the post}} of {{executive director of the}} Colorado Office <b>of</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Development</b> and International Trade, replacing Don Elliman, who Ritter had tapped as Colorado's chief operating officer. Marostica resigned his House seat to take the position, and handed control of his development company to his partner and son in order to avoid conflicts of interest, Marostica named opening Asian markets to Colorado exports as a priority for his time in the new position, in addition to encouraging new venture capital investment and retaining existing major employers despite the late-2000s recession. Marostica was replaced in the House by small business owner Brian DelGrosso, and on the legislature's Joint Budget Committee by the more conservative Rep. Kent Lambert.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, {{the sector}} was in crisis, {{characterized}} by low investment, poor cost recovery and poor service quality {{in most of}} the country. As a result, the government decided to break up INSFOPAL {{at the end of the}} 1980s and to devolve the responsibility for service provision back to the municipalities after four decades, except for some cases like the Valle de Cauca department, where the regional companies continued providing the services. Furthermore, the institutional responsibility for the sector was transferred from the Ministry of Health to the Ministry <b>of</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Development.</b> This change was not only an administrative change, but it introduced a different focus and perspective to the sector.|$|E
5|$|Nunavut Tourism did not, as of 2002, produce {{detailed}} {{statistics about}} tourism numbers, trends and characteristics. However, by 2010, this {{appeared to have}} changed, with Nunavut Tourism providing media outlets with general figures on trends in tourism in Nunavut. Tourism brings approximately CAD $30 million to Nunavut's economy each year according to Nunavut Tourism, with one in five of its tourists arriving on cruise ships. Between June and October 2008, 33,378 people visited Nunavut by air and sea, according to the territory's Department <b>of</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Development</b> and Transportation. This is an almost 16 percent increase {{on the number of}} people who visited Nunavut by air and sea during the same period in 2006, which was 28,802 people. The average age of people arriving in Nunavut was 46 during the period in 2008 that the Department <b>of</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Development</b> and Transportation conducted its survey, and the majority of visitors were in the territory for business purposes. 96 percent of all business travellers entering the territory were domestic travellers (Canadian residents). However, among the leisure traveller sub-group, the proportion of domestic travellers declines - Canadians make up only 72 percent of the leisure traveller arrival numbers, with travellers from the United States (20 percent) and other countries (8 percent) making up the difference. September and July account for 46 percent of arrivals, making them the busiest arrival months.|$|E
