6000|$|MRS. BARLOW. Only one <b>other</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> ask. If he must fight--and fight he must--let him alone: don't you try {{to shield}} him or save him. DON'T INTERFERE--do you hear? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Verbatim, sir. In reply Mr. Mortimer desired me to {{tell you}} that, if you did not like it, you could do the <b>other</b> <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> quote the exact words, sir." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{there is}} one <b>other</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> {{want to say to}} you, Johnny. A man should never allow himself to be cast down by anything,--not outwardly, to the eyes of other men." ...|$|E

60|$|One <b>other</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> felt it needful {{to touch}} upon {{before he left}} me. I knew that I should not be worthier of the love I could not take if I {{reserved}} it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hubert, {{it is hard}} {{to spare}} you--hard to send you to such danger. But for one <b>other</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>I</b> am glad you are going.... They must take Sebastian alive; they must NOT kill him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{there is}} just one <b>other</b> <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> wish you would correct a slight {{tendency}} I have noticed lately in Mr. Asher {{to be just a}} trifle--well, not precisely risky, but perhaps a shade broad in his humor." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> saw <b>other</b> <b>things</b> {{that day}} at X. The Tank is only a {{beginning}} in a new phase of warfare. Of these <b>other</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> may only write in the most general terms.|$|R
6000|$|... "This is all I can say at present, {{with the}} {{exception}} of one <b>other</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> heard, which I blush to mention. But your word is law, and you have ordered me to have no concealments from you.|$|E
6000|$|MISS HOWARD. Eighteen, I believe. (Seeing his grin--with feigned pique.) I suppose you'll {{be asking}} if she's pretty next! Oh, you men are all alike, sick or well. Her name is Carmody, that's the only <b>other</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> know. So there! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And there's {{just one}} <b>other</b> <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> don't {{know much about}} {{morality}} and that, but there is this: It's always worth while before you do anything to consider whether it's going to hurt another person more than is absolutely necessary." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That--and <b>other</b> <b>things.</b> <b>I</b> don't {{know how}} the machine was nobbled, but {{it could not be}} done cheap. Would you mind telling me your dreams again?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Blankets!" [...] {{she said}} to herself. [...] "I am afraid they will hardly notice them {{when they see the}} <b>other</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> shall take back there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is very little," [...] she repeated. [...] "I {{could have}} got you more. Still there are some <b>other</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> have in view for you." ...|$|R
60|$|Paul Ruttledge. You {{are afraid}} {{because you have}} been shut up so long. I am not afraid because I have lived upon the roads, where one is ready for {{anything}} that may happen. One has to learn that, like any <b>other</b> <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> will stay.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, {{the only}} <b>other</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> {{can think of}} is to take him into the woods and leave him there. It's a pity we can't let Lady Wetherby know where he is; she seems rather keen on him. But I suppose the main point is to get rid of him.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{we shall}} be friends, Norman of Torn, for albeit I have few enemies, no man has too many friends, and I like your face and your manner, though there be much to wish for in your manners. Sit down and eat with me, and I will talk to your heart's content, for be there one <b>other</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> more love than eating, it is talking." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And in <b>other</b> <b>things,</b> <b>I</b> think," [...] he {{said with}} meaning, {{in a voice that}} seemed {{familiar}} to me. [...] "Well, can I see the Prince Seti?" ...|$|R
60|$|It {{does seem}} my neglect in writing you is unpardonable. I {{used to be}} a pretty fair correspondent, but in that as in <b>other</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> have changed.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{she began}} making {{jewellery}}, Hastings-McFall found {{within a few}} years that she needed to extend beyond this:'I found it jewellery brought up <b>other</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> wanted to explore. I was really interested in jewellery, researching and exploring, but that led to <b>other</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> couldn't do with jewellery. I wanted to make objects without the whole conversation about body adornment. Today there are definitely elements of jewellery and jewellery-making in my work. I don't deny it or repress it. I've always been inclined to making objects about ideas.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Give me facts," [...] said Joe stubbornly, [...] "an' you may 'ave my principles. As to the <b>other</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>I</b> don't {{know what}} it is, but you may 'ave it, too. And 'ere's another thing, sir: haven't you never noticed that when a public man blows off and says something, it does 'im in? No matter what 'appens afterwards, he's got to stick to it or look a fool." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I don't know," [...] {{observed}} a neighbor. [...] "The match-box looks bad; but I guess if I'd been burning a place up I shouldn't have forgotten it. Still, {{it might be}} fatal unless he could disown it. As to the <b>other</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>I</b> don't count much on what he said. A real fire-bug would have kept his mouth shut and helped all he was worth instead of saying anything." ...|$|E
60|$|One <b>other</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> noticed, {{which was}} an {{agreeable}} disappointment to me. I {{had been told that}} there was no social intercourse between the established church and dissenters. In this party, however, were people of many different denominations. Our host belongs to the established church; his brother, with whom we are visiting, is a Baptist, and their father was a Friend; and there appeared to be the utmost social cordiality. Whether I shall find this uniformly the case will appear in time.|$|E
5000|$|Hill later said, [...] "Some say Hollywood {{movies that}} are made about boxing are just metaphors for <b>other</b> <b>things,</b> <b>I</b> think I've made one that's {{actually}} about boxing and not a metaphor." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I forgot. I have {{news for}} you, lady. I {{have found out}} who murdered that Jewish thief whose end, amongst <b>other</b> <b>things,</b> <b>I</b> was sent to investigate. It was your friend Caleb." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will get}} you a new and larger tent," [...] {{answered}} the doctor, [...] "and a few <b>other</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> {{think you ought to}} have." [...] Can you go to Rallings to-morrow?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of Italian democracies {{and young}} Italy's sorrows, of {{extraneous}} Austrian Emperors in Milan, or poor old chimerical Popes in Bologna, I know nothing, {{and desire to}} know nothing; but this <b>other</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> do know, and can here declare publicly to be a fact, which fact {{all of us that}} have occasion to comment on Mr. Mazzini and his affairs may do well to take along with us, as a thing leading towards new clearness, and not towards new additional darkness, regarding him and them.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Only that Hacker of Paul's Yard is {{the best}} for vests,' he answered. 'It is {{a small piece of}} {{knowledge}}, yet like most other knowledge it hath been bought and paid for. One <b>other</b> <b>thing!</b> <b>I</b> have a trinket or two left which might serve as a gift for the pretty Puritan maid, should our friend lead her to the altar. Od's my life, but she will make him read some queer books! How now, Colonel, why are we stuck out on the moor like a row of herons among the sedges?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In any <b>other</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> would. But {{is it fair}} to ask a man who is racked by love of you {{to place}} another in your arms, and that at the risk of his own life? Ah, mademoiselle, I am but a man, and I am subject to human weaknesses. If you will consent, this Lesperon shall go free, but you must see him no more; and I will carry my {{consideration}} so far as to give you six months in which to overcome your sorrow, ere I present myself to you again to urge my suit." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And so have I," [...] cried Locker, [...] "but I {{never had}} any luck in fishing and--some <b>other</b> <b>things.</b> <b>I</b> am vilely unlucky. I expect that's because I don't know how to fish." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I {{will have}} no assurances," [...] she {{interrupted}} smilingly. [...] "I am going to talk of <b>other</b> <b>things.</b> <b>I</b> am {{going to ask you}} a ridiculous question. Are you fond of music?--seriously!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Is it not {{wonderful}} how I {{remember the}} voices {{better than anything}} else? I think they must go deeper into us than <b>other</b> <b>things.</b> <b>I</b> have often fancied heaven might be made of voices." ...|$|R
