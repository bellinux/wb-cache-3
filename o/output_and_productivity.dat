This paper attempts to analyze the impact of human capital attainment among workers for the Malay owned manufacturing and services enterprises on <b>output</b> <b>and</b> labor <b>productivity.</b> The analysis is based on 574 Malay firms surveyed in 2001 / 2002, which covers 264 manufacturing enterprises and 310 services enterprises in Peninsular Malaysia.

The <b>output</b> <b>and</b> labor <b>productivity</b> of the firms are regressed against the human capital variables like education and training together with physical capital stock.

High-yield varieties were promoted together with subsidised fertiliser, pesticides, and credit through the [...] "mass guidance" [...] or Bimas rice intensification program. This extension program also offered technical assistance to farmers unfamiliar with the new cultivation techniques. The new technology was not without its own problems, however. Several major infestations of the brown planthopper, whose natural predators were eliminated by the heavy use of subsidised pesticides, led to a new strategy in 1988 to apply the techniques of integrated pest management, relying {{on a variety of}} methods aside from pesticide to control insects and rodents.

5000|$|Agricultural History {{handles the}} {{economic}} and technological dimensions, while Rural history handles the social dimension. Burchardt (2007) evaluates the state of modern English rural history and identifies an [...] "orthodox" [...] school, focused on the economic history of agriculture. This historiography has made impressive progress in quantifying and explaining the <b>output</b> <b>and</b> <b>productivity</b> achievements of English farming since the [...] "agricultural revolution." [...] The celebratory style of the orthodox school was challenged by a dissident tradition emphasizing the social costs of agricultural progress, notably enclosure, which forced poor tenant farmers off the land. Recently, a new school, associated with the journal Rural History, has broken away from this narrative of agricultural change, elaborating a wider social history. The work of Alun Howkins has been pivotal in the recent historiography, in relation to these three traditions. Howkins, like his precursors, is constrained by an increasingly anachronistic equation of the countryside with agriculture. Geographers and sociologists have developed a concept of a [...] "post-productivist" [...] countryside, dominated by consumption and representation that {{may have something to}} offer historians, in conjunction with the well-established historiography of the [...] "rural idyll." [...] Most rural history has focused on the American South—overwhelmingly rural until the 1950s—but there is a [...] "new rural history" [...] of the North as well. Instead of becoming agrarian capitalists, farmers held onto preindustrial capitalist values emphasizing family and community. Rural areas maintained population stability; kinship ties determined rural immigrant settlement and community structures; and the defeminization of farm work encouraged the rural version of the [...] "women's sphere." [...] These findings strongly contrast with those in the old frontier history as well as those found in the new urban history.|$|E

After these reforms, however, it has taken a number of years before <b>output</b> <b>and</b> <b>productivity</b> have begun to grow. The thesis of this paper is that the process of starting new enterprises is turbulent and time-consuming and as a result, it takes time before the benefits of reform show up in increases in measured <b>output</b> <b>and</b> <b>productivity.</b> To establish a neoclassical benchmark for reforming economies, we ask what the path of transition looks like in a reforming economy for which the process governing the growth of new enterprises looks like it does in the U. S., a well-functioning market economy. We find that it takes 5 - 7 years until measured <b>output</b> <b>and</b> <b>productivity</b> begin to grow rapidly following reform.

Using a standard VAR, we empirically {{show that a}} temperature shock has a sizable, negative and statistically significant impact on TFP, <b>output,</b> <b>and</b> labor <b>productivity.</b> We rationalize these findings within a production economy featuring long-run temperature risk. In the model, macro-aggregates drop {{in response to a}} temperature shock, consistent with the novel evidence in the data. Such adverse effects are long-lasting. Over a 50 -year horizon, a one-standard deviation temperature shock lowers both cumulative <b>output</b> <b>and</b> labor <b>productivity</b> growth by 1. 4 percentage points. Based on the model, we also show that temperature risk is associated with non-negligible welfare costs which amount to 18. 4 % of the agent's lifetime utility and grow exponentially with the size of the impact of temperature on TFP. Finally, we show that faster adaptation to temperature shocks results in lower welfare costs.

The richer information set {{made possible by the}} sectorial data enables this study to utilize the methodologically sound "group-mean" Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares (FMOLS) procedure developed by Pedroni to generate consistent estimates of the relevant panel variables in the cointegrated production (labor productivity) function. The results suggest that, in the long run, changes in the stocks of public and private capital and the economically active population (EAP) {{have a positive}} and economically significant effect on <b>output</b> (<b>and</b> labor <b>productivity)</b> in all sectors. By contrast, changes in the stocks of foreign capital have a mixed effect, with a negative and statistically significant effect on <b>output</b> (<b>and</b> labor <b>productivity)</b> in the services sector; a positive and economically significant impact on output (labor productivity) in the industrial sector, and a positive but insignificant effect on output (labor productivity) in the primary sector. The period is also broken down into two sub-periods: 1960 - 81 (state-led industrialization) and 1982 - 2001 ("neoliberal" model). The estimate for the public capital variable clearly shows that it had a positive and relatively important economic effect during the earlier state-led period, while the private capital variable remains positive and significant in both periods. The foreign capital variable has a positive and highly significant effect during the ISI period, but, turns unexpectedly negative and economically significant in the neoliberal period. ...|$|R

The relatively large contribution of ICT capital to <b>output</b> growth <b>and</b> labor <b>productivity</b> is due to an extraordinary acceleration in real ICT investments, which were growing between 1995 and 2000 at an average rate of more than 20 % a year for almost all countries in the study. Large investments in ICT seem to have been induced by (i) falling prices of ICT products and services, which encouraged companies to substitute ICT for non-ICT capital and (ii) an opportunity for higher-than-normal returns on ICT investments due to a large pent-up demand for ICT infrastructure, a legacy of decapitalization and technological gap existing before 1989. economic growth, post-communist countries, information technology, growth accounting...|$|R
