In particular, it is found that being female and non-white increase the chances <b>of</b> <b>having</b> <b>an</b> NVQ, and there is a negative relationship between previous formal qualifications and the likelihood <b>of</b> <b>having</b> <b>an</b> NVQ. ...|$|R

5|$|In Germany, {{sugar levels}} {{at time of}} harvest are an {{important}} consideration in the wine's production with prädikat levels measuring {{the sweetness of the}} wine. Equally important to winegrowers is the balance of acidity between the green tasting malic acid and the more citrus tasting tartaric acid. In cool years, some growers will wait until November to harvest in hopes <b>of</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> higher level of ripeness and subsequent tartaric acid.|$|E

In 1966, the number of babies born in Japan dropped by over 25% as parents tried to avoid the stigma <b>of</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> daughter born in the hinoeuma year.|$|E

5|$|A {{friend of}} Eberhardt's {{gave her a}} letter of {{introduction}} to playwright Eugène Brieux, who opposed French rule in North Africa and supported Arab emancipation. He sent her a several-hundred-franc advance and tried to have her stories published, but could not find anyone willing to publish pro-Arab writing. Eberhardt, unfazed, continued writing; her morale lifted when Ehnni was transferred to a spahi regiment near Marseille in late August to complete his final months of service. He did not require permission from his military superiors to marry in France, and he and Eberhardt were married in October 1901. Shortly before they were married, Eberhardt and Augustin received the news that Trophimowsky's estate had finally been sold, though due to the mounting legal costs {{there was no money}} left for them to inherit. With this news, Eberhardt abandoned any hope <b>of</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> financially secure future. In February 1902 Ehnni was discharged, and the couple returned to Bône to live with his family.|$|E

5|$|Although it {{wound up}} being {{faithful}} to the comics, many designs were made for Spider-Man's costumes: one concept costume designer James Acheson became fond of the idea <b>of</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> red emblem over a black costume.

To create Spider-Man's costume, Maguire was fitted for the skintight suit, being covered with layers of substance to create the suit's shape. It was designed as a single piece, except for the mask. The webbing, which accented the costume, was cut by computer. The mask eye lenses were designed to have a mirror look.|$|E

5|$|Because {{different}} embeddings {{may lead}} to different dual graphs, testing whether one graph is a dual of another (without already knowing their embeddings) is a nontrivial algorithmic problem. For biconnected graphs, it can be solved in polynomial time by using the SPQR trees of the graphs to construct a canonical form for the equivalence relation <b>of</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> shared mutual dual. For instance, the two red graphs in the illustration are equivalent according to this relation. However, for planar graphs that are not biconnected, this relation is not an equivalence relation {{and the problem of}} testing mutual duality is NP-complete.|$|E
