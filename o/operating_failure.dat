40|$|Abstract. System {{maintenance}} {{is necessary to}} prolong the operational life of a system. There are four types of maintenance policies which are corrective, preventive, scheduled and predictive (conditioning based maintenance). However, this paper focuses on preventive maintenance and corrective maintenance policies. In general, the goal of preventive {{maintenance is}} to retain the system at its good operating conditions before the occurrence of any failure while corrective maintenance is done {{as a result of}} the system’s <b>operating</b> <b>failure.</b> This paper investigates the effects of maintenance activities for Engine Indication and Flight Instruments subsystems of the avionics system of a general aircraft.

40|$|AbstractThe risk {{of fatigue}} damage {{concerns}} structural components, structural knots and even whole structures subjected to random loading. This can initiate {{the accumulation of}} fatigue damage in critical points of the structure, growth and spreading of fatigue cracks and, eventually, fatigue fracture. Final failure of structural components may have fatal consequences. Calculation results regarding the accumulation of fatigue damage in supporting structures are commonly highly useful when investigating the causes of an <b>operating</b> <b>failure</b> or in further efforts to adjust principal parameters due to device adjustment (for instance {{in order to increase}} lifting capacity of cranes) or when estimating residual life of a device after some failure or an overhaul. This paper offers a few examples of how the process of fatigue life prediction can practically be applied. Fatigue life is determined by means of ESA (Experimental Stress Analysis) and CAE (Computer Aided Experiment). Nowadays, for the purposes of fatigue life evaluation CAE systems enable the combination and the interaction of various methods altogether: ESA, FEM (Finite Element Method) and MSS (Mechanisms System Simulation) ...|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} on-orbit {{performance}} {{results of the}} Pointing Calibration and Reference Sensor (PCRS) for the Spitzer Space Telescope. A cryogenic optical (center wavelength 0. 55 mu) imager, the PCRS serves as the Observatory's fine guidance sensor by providing an alignment reference between the telescope boresight and the external spacecraft attitude determination system. The PCRS makes precision measurements of the positions of known guide stars; these are used to calibrate measurements from Spitzer's star tracker and gyroscopes to obtain the actual pointing of the Spitzer telescope. The PCRS calibrates out thermomoechanical drifts between the 300 K spacecraft bus and the 5. 5 K telescope. By using only 16 pixels, the PCRS provides high precision centroiding with extremely low (` 64 mu W) power dissipation, resulting in minimal impact to Spritzer's helium lifetime. We have demonstrated that the PCRS meets its centroiding accuracy requirement of 0. 14 arcsec 1 -sigma radial, which represents about 1 / 100 pixel centroiding. The Spitzer Space Telescope was launched in 25 August, 2003 and completed its In-Orbit Checkout phase two months later; the PCRS has been <b>operating</b> <b>failure</b> free ever since...|$|E
40|$|Resistance-welded {{thermoplastic}} and adhesive-bonded thermosetting composite lap joints {{were compared}} {{in terms of}} mechanical properties and fracture aspects in pristine and after impact at 10 J and/or hygrothermally ageing conditions. Ultimate strength under quasi-static four-point bend loading (4 PB) of virgin joints was higher than simply impacted ones, followed by simply aged test coupons, and finally by impacted and subsequently aged test pieces. Environmental ageing showed the same detrimental side effect, in relative extent terms, in both types of joint. Deleterious effects on 4 PB stiffness of epoxy thermosseting composite joint was clearly visible and of the same intensity in both simply impacted and simply aged conditions, although impacting and subsequent ageing of test pieces curiously caused a much lower deterioration of this property. Thermoplastic PPS joints also displayed a somewhat unusual performance in this regard, as their stiffness in response to simply impacted and simply aged conditions was substantially higher than the pristine joint, although, as expected, the impacted and subsequently aged test coupons exhibited the lowest stiffness among all the tested conditions.

In this research the failure of Nimonic 80 A insert bolts, which connect the air duct rings to the combustion chamber ceiling, in a 159 MW unit is investigated. The bolts operating at about 650 ºC, failed prematurely after a service life of 36000 h. A broken fragment of the bolts dropped into the combustion chamber and entered the turbine section from a small design opening, severely damaging several of the turbine blades. Several insert bolts were retrieved from the accident site and used in this study. The investigation mainly included visual examinations, nondestructive testing, hardness testing, optical emission spectroscopy, metallography, and SEM fractography. The fracture location of the bolts was {{at the root of}} the first or second thread. Fractographic examinations identified intergranular creep rupture by wedge-shaped cracking as the <b>operating</b> <b>failure</b> mechanism. The macroscopically brittle fracture behavior of the insert bolts is discussed based on the formation of semi-continuous grain boundary carbide networks which resist grain boundary sliding, leading to stress build up and eventual loss of creep rupture ductility...|$|E

To achieve a fast and low cost diagnostic, we propose a new tool based on wavelet leaders in which the PEMFC diagnosis is made by the observation of the one and only stack voltage. The steps of our strategy are the following ones:- The PEMFC stack is operated under a variety of conditions (nominal or severe) using a characterization test bench developed in lab. The severe operating conditions refer either to single fault types or to different combinations of faults. The recorded stack voltages are analyzed using a Wavelet Leader based Multifractal Analysis (WLMA) in order to identify their singularity spectra as fault signatures. This novel method based on leader discrete wavelet coefficients for the estimation of the singularity spectrum is a well-suited technique for nonstationary and non-linear signals. A feature selection method is used to select the most relevant singularity features and to remove the redundant ones. - The selected singularity features are classified using SVM (Support Vector Machine) and KNN (KNearest Neighbors) techniques according to the considered operating situations (faults and combinations of faults). Our results show that the proposed PEMFC diagnosis tool allows identifying simple <b>operating</b> <b>failure</b> cases and even more complicated situations that contain several failure types...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This paper {{presents}} the results of the research on the influence of non-metallic inclusions on strength properties of 35 B 2 +Cr steel screws. Design/methodology/approach: The investigations were carried out on screws after softening. The investigated steels with different fraction of non-metallic inclusions were delivered by three different suppliers. Findings: It was proved, that in spite of the level of fraction of non-metallic inclusions compatible with the corresponding standards, they directly or indirectly influence the strength properties of 35 B 2 +Cr steel screws. This influence depends on the character of the inclusions. Research limitations/implications: The investigations were carried out only on screws made of only one steel grade. Practical implications: Influence of non-metallic inclusions on properties of 35 B 2 +Cr steel, within analysed range of their content, is not significant enough to be a critical factor in relation to <b>operating</b> <b>failures</b> of the screws made of this steel.

40|$|Many {{diseases}} of the spine require surgical treatments that are currently performed based {{on the experience of}} the surgeon.

The template has two cylindrical guides that follow a correct trajectory previously calculated by means of an automatic algorithm generated {{on the basis of a}} vertebra CAD model for a specific patient. The surgeon sets the template (drilling guides) on the patient’s vertebra and safely applies the screws. Three surgical interventions for spinal stabilization have been performed using the template.

5000|$|By early 1926, Pedersen had {{designed}} and built a prototype rifle. He had researched Army tactics and operational concepts, and had engineered the tooling for parts manufacture {{as an integral part}} of engineering the gun parts themselves. Such an application of sound research and development made a very strong impression on Army personnel when the rifle was presented for inspection and testing. The rifle was a solid, well-finished weapon, 44 inches (112 cm) long, weighing slightly over 8 pounds (3.6 kg). It utilized a disposable ten-round en bloc clip, a system favored at the time. Pedersen's rifle utilized a sophisticated up-breaking toggle-joint system like the Parabellum P.08 but improved by utilizing delayed blowback. This system was simple and free of both the fragility and severe kick of recoil operation, and the weight and complexity of gas operation (as in the Browning Automatic Rifle). To ease extraction, cartridge cases were coated in mineral wax. This left a thin film that was “hard, and durable, and was not sticky,”. [...] The waxed cases solved the issue of difficult extraction, but hindered acceptance of the Pedersen rifle because officials feared that the wax would attract dirt and cause <b>operating</b> <b>failures.</b>|$|R
