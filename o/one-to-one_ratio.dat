5|$|Sega AM2's {{first attempt}} in the genre was the 1993 arcade game Burning Rival, but gained renown {{with the release}} of Virtua Fighter for the same {{platform}} the same year. It was the first fighting game with 3D polygon graphics and a viewpoint that zoomed and rotated with the action. Despite the graphics, players were confined to back and forth motion as seen in other fighting games. With only three buttons, it was easier to learn than Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat, having six and five buttons respectively. By the time the game was released for the Sega Saturn in Japan, the game and system were selling at almost a <b>one-to-one</b> <b>ratio.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sega {{released}} the Saturn in Japan on November 22, 1994, {{at a price}} of JP¥44,800. Virtua Fighter, a faithful port of the popular arcade game, sold at a nearly <b>one-to-one</b> <b>ratio</b> with the Saturn console at launch and was crucial to the system's early success in Japan.s 3D characters have a presence that 2D sprites just can't match. The characters really do seem 'alive', whether they're throwing a punch, unleashing a special move or reeling from a blow... The Saturn version of Virtua Fighter is an exceptional game in many respects. It's arguably the first true 'next generation' console game, fusing the best aspects of combat gameplay with groundbreaking animation and gorgeous sound (CD music and clear samples). In the arcades, Virtua Fighter made people stop and look. On the Saturn, it will make many people stop, look at their bank balance and then fork out for Sega's new machine.

Sega had wanted the launch to include both Clockwork Knight and Panzer Dragoon, but the latter was not ready in time. Fueled by the popularity of Virtua Fighter, Sega's initial shipment of 200,000 Saturn units sold out on the first day. Sega waited until the December 3 launch of the PlayStation to ship more units; when both were sold side-by-side, the Saturn {{proved to be the}} more popular system. Meanwhile, Sega {{released the}} 32X on November 21, 1994 in North America, December 3, 1994 in Japan, and January 1995 in PAL territories, and was sold at {{less than half of the}} Saturn's launch price. After the holiday season, however, interest in the 32X rapidly declined. 500,000 Saturn units were sold in Japan by the end of 1994 (compared to 300,000 PlayStation units), and sales exceeded 1 million within the following six months. There were conflicting reports that the PlayStation enjoyed a higher sell-through rate, and the system gradually began to overtake the Saturn in sales during 1995. Sony attracted many third-party developers to the PlayStation with a liberal $10 licensing fee, excellent development tools, and the introduction of a 7- to 10-day order system that allowed publishers to meet demand more efficiently than the 10- to 12-week lead times for cartridges that had previously been standard in the Japanese video game industry.|$|E
25|$|In operation, the {{bloomery}} is preheated {{by burning}} charcoal, and once hot, iron ore and additional charcoal are introduced through the top, in a roughly <b>one-to-one</b> <b>ratio.</b> Inside the furnace, carbon monoxide from the incomplete combustion of the charcoal reduces the iron oxides in the ore to metallic iron, without melting the ore; {{this allows the}} bloomery to operate at lower temperatures than the melting temperature of the ore. Since the desired product of a bloomery is easily forgeable, nearly pure iron, with a low carbon content, the temperature and ratio of charcoal to iron ore must be carefully controlled to keep the iron from absorbing the carbon and becoming unforgeable. Limestone could also {{be added to the}} bloomery, about 10% of the ore weight, which would act as flux and help carry away impurities.|$|E

Despite selling out, some store locations for Electronics Boutique and KB Toys reported little or no units of the flight simulator being shipped to retailers. About 90,000 copies of Pilotwings 64 were sold in its first few days on sale in the country, putting the game at number four on the NPD Group sales charts for that September. Pilotwings 64 saw a release in European nations on March 1, 1997, when it was one of three launch games along with Super Mario 64 and [...] In the United Kingdom, it was listed by Esquire magazine as the [...] "cheapest game in Nintendo's frighteningly-priced opening range of titles".

5000|$|The Shimano {{compatible}} {{family of}} derailleurs is stated {{as having a}} shift ratio of two-to-one (2:1), and since SRAM makes two families of components, the term has been widely adopted to distinguish it from SRAM's own <b>one-to-one</b> (1:1) <b>ratio</b> family of derailleurs. Notice that these family names do not give the exact shift ratios: the 2:1 shift ratio is in fact about 1.7 (Or 1.9 on the Dura Ace series up to 7400) rather than 2, and the native SRAM shift ratio is about 1.1. The family names of these standards are reversed by some in actuation ratio notation as opposed {{to that of the}} more common shift ratio.

40|$|The {{effect of}} bipolar tetraether lipids, {{extracted}} from the thermophilic archaebacterium Sulfolobus acidocaldarius, on the branched-chain amino acid transport system of the mesophilic bacterium Lactococcus lactis was investigated.

Freeze-fracture electron microscopy demonstrates that the bipolar lipids in the hybrid membranes adopted a monomolecular organization at high S. acidocaldarius lipid content. Leucine transport activity (i. e., DELTA(mu(H+)) -driven and counterflow uptake) increased with the content of S. acidocaldarius lipids and was optimal at a <b>one-to-one</b> (w/w) <b>ratio</b> of PC to S. acidocaldarius lipids.

40|$|Three {{species of}} {{double-stranded}} RNA (replicative forms) have been isolated from cells infected with Sindbis virus after treating the extracts with pancreatic ribonuclease. Their molecular weights have been {{estimated to be}} 8. 8 x 10 ^ 6, 6. 6 x 10 ^ 6 and 2. 9 x 10 ^ 6 daltons (RFI, RFII and RFIII, respectively). RFII and RFIII were found to exist in a <b>one-to-one</b> molar <b>ratio</b> throughout the infection cycle, although the total amounts of these replicative forms varied. The molar ratio of RF 1 {{to the other two}} replicative forms was different at various times after infection. However, {{in the middle of the}} virus life-cycle, from two to six hours post-infection, this ratio was constant at 0. 4 to 1. Sedimentation analysis of pulse-labeled RNA from Sindbis-infected cells indicated that all replicative intermediates had molecular weights greater than or equal to 8. 8 x 10 ^ 6 daltons. Since all three replicative forms were liberated from the peak of replicative intermediates by treatment with ribonuclease, this suggested that RFII and RFIII were joined together before digestion. The constant <b>one-to-one</b> molar <b>ratio</b> of RFII and RFIII supported this hypothesis. Kinetic experiments demonstrated that while RFI and RFIII were labeled equally rapidly, RFII was labeled some 20 to 50 times more slowly. Hybridization competition experiments showed that the minus strand of RFIII is complementary to 26 s RNA, a species of single-stranded RNA found in infected cells, and that the minus strand of RFII is complementary to the remainder of the 49 s viral genome. We postulate, therefore, that a precursor-product relation exists between RFI and 49 s RNA, between RFIII and 26 s RNA and between RFII and a third species of Sindbis-specific RNA, which we have not yet detected. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that two classes of replicative intermediates exist in Sindbis-infected cells. One serves as the template for the synthesis of 49 s RNA, and the second manufactures two smaller segments of viral-specific RNA...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} systematically the feasibility of modifying the behavior of autistic children in a classroom environment. In the first experiment, eight autistic children were taught certain basic classroom behaviors (including attending to the teacher upon command, imitation, and an elementary speaking and recognition vocabulary) that were assumed to be necessary for subsequent learning to take place in the classroom. Based on research documenting the effectiveness of <b>one-to-one</b> (teacher-child <b>ratio)</b> procedures for modifying such behaviors, these behaviors were taught in one-to-one sessions. It was, however, found that behaviors taught in a one-to-one setting were not performed consistently in a classroom-sized group, or even in a group as small as two children with one teacher. Further, the children evidenced no acquisition of new behaviors in a classroom environment over a four-week period. Therefore, Experiment II introduced a treatment procedure based upon “fading in” the classroom stimulus situation from the one-to-one stimulus situation. Such treatment was highly effective in producing both a transfer in stimulus control and the acquisition of new behaviors in a kindergarten/first-grade classroom environment...|$|R
