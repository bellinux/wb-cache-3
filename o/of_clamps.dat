5|$|It {{was common}} {{practice}} for ore freighters, even in foul weather, to embark with not all cargo clamps locked {{in place on}} the hatch covers. Maritime author Wolff reported that depending on weather conditions, all the clamps were eventually set within one to two days. Captain Paquette of Wilfred Sykes was dismissive of suggestions that unlocked hatch clamps caused Fitzgerald to founder. He said that he commonly sailed in fine weather using the minimum number <b>of</b> <b>clamps</b> necessary to secure the hatch covers.|$|E
5|$|Amanita onusta may be {{confused}} with A.cinereoconia because of the similar gray powdery veil remnants on the cap surface. A.cinereoconia is distinguished from A.onusta by the absence <b>of</b> <b>clamps,</b> its powdery-wooly to powdery-warty cap, {{as well as the}} absence of warts or scales {{at the base of the}} stipe. A.cinereoconia also smells distinctly of chloride of lime. Another similar species is A.costaricensis, found only in Costa Rica. A.atkinsoniana, another North American species, has shorter warts that are spaced further apart than those of A.onusta, and the warts on the basal bulb are arranged in parallel rows.|$|E
5|$|Armillaria calvescens {{is rather}} similar in appearance, {{and can only}} be {{reliably}} distinguished from A.gallica by observing microscopic characteristics. A.calvescens has a more northern distribution, and in North America, is rarely found south of the Great Lakes. A.mellea has a thinner stem than A.gallica, but can be more definitively distinguished by the absence <b>of</b> <b>clamps</b> {{at the base of}} the basidia. Similarly, A.cepistipes and A.gallica are virtually identical in appearance (especially older fruit bodies), and are identified by differences in geographical distribution, host range, and microscopic characteristics. Molecular methods have been developed to discriminate between the two species by comparing DNA sequences in the gene coding translation elongation factor 1-alpha.|$|E

500|$|The North British batch {{was built}} to the Southern's new {{composite}} loading gauge and differed from previous batches in having an Ashford-style cab based upon that used on the Nclass. Unlike the Drummond cab retained by Nos.448457 and E741E755, the Ashford cab was of an all-steel construction and had a roof that was flush with the cab sides, allowing it to be used on gauge-restricted routes in {{the east of the}} network. It was inspired by the standard cab developed in 1904 by R. M.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{influence}} <b>of</b> small <b>clamping</b> eccentricity on the measurement {{and evaluation of}} involute profile, analyzes the cause <b>of</b> <b>clamping</b> eccentric error, establishes a clamping eccentric error compensation model, and introduces a computing method <b>of</b> <b>clamping</b> eccentric parameters. Experimental testing of the computing method <b>of</b> <b>clamping</b> eccentric parameters proves that the computing method <b>of</b> <b>clamping</b> eccentric parameters is correct and feasible when the clamping eccentric value is within {{three quarters of the}} measurement range of the probe. The results <b>of</b> the <b>clamping</b> eccentricity error compensation experiment show that the clamping eccentric error compensation model can compensate measurement results to the results attained under operating conditions, and achieve precision measurement of involute profiles. The highest allowed clamping eccentric value can be extended to three quarters of the measurement range of the probe by the clamping eccentricity error compensation model proposed in this paper, thereby saving time otherwise spent adjusting for clamping eccentricity...|$|R

50|$|A case of vestigial organs was {{described}} in polyopisthocotylean Monogeneans (parasitic flatworms). These parasites usually have a posterior attachment organ with several clamps, which are sclerotised organs attaching the worm to the gill of the host fish. These clamps are extremely important {{for the survival of}} the parasite. In the family Protomicrocotylidae, species have either normal clamps, simplified clamps, or no clamps at all (in the genus Lethacotyle). After a comparative study of the relative surface <b>of</b> <b>clamps</b> in more than 100 Monogeneans, this has been interpreted as an evolutionary sequence leading to the loss <b>of</b> <b>clamps.</b> Coincidentally, other attachment structures (lateral flaps, transverse striations) have evolved in protomicrocotylids. Therefore, clamps in protomicrocotylids were considered vestigial organs.|$|E

50|$|Two types <b>of</b> <b>clamps</b> {{are quite}} {{commonly}} used.
