50|$|Dalmatians, like humans, {{can suffer}} from hyperuricemia. Dalmatians' livers have trouble {{breaking}} down uric acid, which can {{build up in}} the blood serum (hyperuricemia) causing gout. Uric acid can also be excreted in high concentration into the urine, causing kidney stones and bladder stones. These conditions {{are most likely to}} occur in middle-aged males. Males over 10 are prone to kidney stones and should have their calcium intake reduced or be given preventive medication. To reduce the risk of gout and stones, owners should carefully limit the intake of purines by avoiding giving their dogs food containing organ meats, animal byproducts, or other high-purine ingredients. Hyperuricemia in Dalmatians responds to treatment with <b>orgotein,</b> the veterinary formulation of the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>orgotein,</b> the drug version of bovine Cu-Zn {{superoxide}} dismutase, on PG production by phagocytosing leukocytes has been investigated. <b>Orgotein</b> inhibited PG formation in a dose/dependent manner. Arachidonic acid {{was able to}} reverse this inhibitory effect. In the light of these results {{it is suggested that}} anti-inflammatory properties of <b>orgotein</b> may depend, at least in part, on the inhibition of phospholipase activation...|$|E
40|$|Five {{patients}} with oligoarticular rheumatoid arthritis {{were treated with}} intra-articular injections of methotrexate and <b>orgotein</b> in the knee joints. The employed dose of the antimetabolite was very low and <b>orgotein</b> was simultaneously administered to prevent local tissues from cytolysis-related damage. Clinical results were fairly good and {{support the hypothesis that}} methotrexate may be used intra-articularly as an immunosuppressor rather than at the heavily toxic doses required for a cytostatic effect...|$|E
40|$|The medical {{literature}} was reviewed from 1968 – 2002 using Medline {{and the key}} words "intra-articular" and "osteoarthritis" to determine the various intra-articular therapies used {{in the treatment of}} osteoarthritis. Corticosteroids and hyaluronic acid are the most frequently used intra-articular therapies in osteoarthritis. Other intra-articular substances such as <b>orgotein,</b> radiation synovectomy, dextrose prolotherapy, silicone, saline lavage, saline injection without lavage, analgesic agents, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, glucosamine, somatostatin, sodium pentosan polysulfate, chloroquine, mucopolysaccharide polysulfuric acid ester, lactic acid solution, and thiotepa cytostatica have been investigated as potentially therapeutic in the treatment of arthritic joints. Despite the lack of strong, convincing, and reproducible evidence that any of the intra-articular therapies significantly alters the progression of osteoarthritis, corticosteroids and hyaluronic acid are widely used in patients who have failed other therapeutic modalities for lack of efficacy or toxicity. As a practical approach for a knee with effusion, steroid injections should be considered while the presence of symptomatic "dry" knees may favour the hyaluronic acid approach. The virtual absence of serious side effects, coupled with the perceived benefits, make these approaches attractive...|$|E

To investigate {{the effects of}} exogenous antioxidant copper zinc superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn SOD) on oxidative stress in the experimental model of diabetes mellitus (DM). Methods. Twenty eight male Wistar rats divided in four groups were used: control (CO), controls treated with SOD (CO + SOD), diabetics (DM), and diabetics treated with SOD (DM + SOD). SOD (<b>orgotein,</b> 13 mg/Kg body weight was administered. DM was induced by a single streptozotocin injection (i. p., 70 mg/kg), and 60 days later, we evaluated liver oxidative stress. Results. Liver lipoperoxidation was increased in the DM group and significantly decreased in the DM + SOD group. Nitrite and nitrate measures were reduced in the DM and increased in the DM + SOD group, while iNOS expression in the DM group was 32 % greater than in the CO and 53 % greater in the DM + SOD group than in the DM group (P <. 01). P 65 expression was 37 % higher in the DM (P <. 05), {{and there was no}} significant difference between the DM and DM +SODgroups. Conclusion. SOD treatment reduced liver oxidative stress in diabetic animals, even though it did not change NFκB...|$|E
