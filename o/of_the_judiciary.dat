5|$|Prior to Chief Justice Marshall's tenure, the Supreme Court {{had heard}} only two {{criminal}} casesboth by prerogative writ. First, in United States v. Hamilton (1795), the Court granted bail to a capital defendant charged with treasonas it was authorized {{to do by}} § 33 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Judiciary</b> Act of 1789 and § 4 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Judiciary</b> Act of 1793on an original writ of habeas corpus. The greater portion of the decision was dedicated to the Court's refusal to order the case tried by a special circuit court, as was provided for by § 3 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Judiciary</b> Act of 1793. Second, in United States v. Lawrence (1795), the Court declined to issue a writ of mandamus to compel a district judge to order the arrest of a deserter of the French navy, as the French government argued to be required by the consular convention between the United States and France.|$|E

Further, because the D.C. circuit court was not constituted within the framework <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Judiciary</b> Act of 1802, appeals to the Supreme Court by way of certificates of division could not issue.

40|$|Part 4 : Infrastructure and TechnologyInternational audienceThis article {{presents}} an analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> Information Technology (IT) investments in <b>the</b> efficiency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Brazilian <b>Judiciary</b> System.

5|$|Despite {{his early}} {{resolution}} {{not to allow}} politics to impede upon his legal career, Maxwell's resolute support of the Union during the American Civil War, and of the statehood movement for West Virginia, refocused his priorities. Maxwell's political affiliation had been Republican, and he became {{actively involved in the}} formation of the state of West Virginia in 1863. Just weeks prior to the state's creation on June 20 of that year, he began his political career when he was elected to represent the Third Senatorial District in the inaugural session of the West Virginia Senate in June 1863. During his tenure in the senate, which lasted until 1866, Maxwell served as the chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Judiciary</b> Committee. In his position as the chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Judiciary</b> Committee, he played a prominent role in the passage of the state's earliest legislation.|$|E
