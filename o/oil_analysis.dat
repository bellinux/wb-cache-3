50|$|<b>Oil</b> <b>analysis</b> (OA) is the {{laboratory}} {{analysis of a}} lubricant's properties, suspended contaminants, and wear debris. OA is performed during routine predictive maintenance to provide meaningful and accurate information on lubricant and machine condition. By tracking <b>oil</b> <b>analysis</b> sample results {{over the life of}} a particular machine, trends can be established which can help eliminate costly repairs. The study of wear in machinery is called tribology. Tribologists often perform or interpret <b>oil</b> <b>analysis</b> data.|$|E

50|$|By 1955 OA had matured to {{the point}} that the United States Bureau of Naval Weapons began a major {{research}} program to adopt wear metal analysis for use in aircraft component failure prediction. These studies formed the basis for a Joint <b>Oil</b> <b>Analysis</b> Program (JOAP) involving all branches of the U.S. Armed Forces. The JOAP results proved conclusively that increases in component wear could be confirmed by detecting corresponding increases in the wear metal content of the lubricating oil. In 1958 Pacific Intermountain Express (P.I.E.) was the first trucking company to set up an in-house used <b>oil</b> <b>analysis</b> laboratory to control vehicle maintenance costs which was managed by Bob Herguth. In 1960 the first independent commercial <b>oil</b> <b>analysis</b> laboratory was started by Edward Forgeron in Oakland, CA.|$|E

50|$|Infrared {{monitoring}} and analysis has the widest range of application (from high- to low-speed equipment), {{and it can be}} effective for spotting both mechanical and electrical failures; some consider it to currently be the most cost-effective technology. <b>Oil</b> <b>analysis</b> is a long-term program that, where relevant, can eventually be more predictive {{than any of the other}} technologies. It can take years for a plant's oil program to reach this level of sophistication and effectiveness. Analytical techniques performed on oil samples can be classified in two categories: used <b>oil</b> <b>analysis</b> and wear particle analysis. Used <b>oil</b> <b>analysis</b> determines the condition of the lubricant itself, determines the quality of the lubricant, and checks its suitability for continued use. Wear particle analysis determines the mechanical condition of machine components that are lubricated. Through wear particle analysis, you can identify the composition of the solid material present and evaluate particle type, size, concentration, distribution, and morphology.|$|E

50|$|ICP-AES is {{used for}} motor <b>oil</b> <b>analysis.</b> Analyzing used motor oil reveals {{a great deal about}} how the engine is operating.

In addition, ICP-AES can determine what amount of certain oil additives remain and therefore indicate how much service life the oil has remaining. <b>Oil</b> <b>analysis</b> is often used by fleet manager or automotive enthusiasts who have an interest in finding out as much about their engine's operation as possible. ICP-AES is also used during the production of motor oils (and other lubricating oils) for quality control and compliance with production and industry specifications.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper will}} present {{the results of an}} oil flow {{investigation}} on an airbreathing missile model. This oil flow study examined the flow around the model, which can be configured with both axisymmetric and two-dimensional inlets. Flow visualization analyses were conducted for both types of geometries by examining the surface flow patterns made visible by the oil flows for Mach numbers of 2. 5 and 3. 95. The analysis has shown the extent of flow spillage around the inlet which has helped explain the force and moment data collected during previous testing of the model. The oil flow data has also been used to develop guidelines for modeling the location of the crossflow separation line along inlet fairings. Finally, the <b>oil</b> flow <b>analysis</b> has been used to identify unique features of the boattail flow. These boattail flow characteristics have been correlated with previous <b>oil</b> flow <b>analysis</b> of noncircular body models.

30|$|Vibration sensing is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used online monitoring technique because of its rugged cost-effective, but the sensing quantity is an indirect indicator of gearbox condition due to the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the sensing measurement.
