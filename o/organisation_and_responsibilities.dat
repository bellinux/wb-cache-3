50|$|Francis took radical {{steps to}} modernise and rationalise the <b>organisation</b> <b>and</b> <b>responsibilities</b> {{of the museum}} and other organisations {{for which it was}} {{nominally}} responsible. He was largely responsible for the contents of the British Museum Act of 1963, which gave the Natural History Museum complete independence from the British Museum for the first time, authorised the museum to dispose of duplicate items, and allowed it to store and even display items away from the main building at Bloomsbury. This permitted, for example, the transformation of the museum's department of ethnography into the free-standing Museum of Mankind. It was regretted by some at the time that Francis {{had not been able to}} take the even bolder step of splitting the library from the rest of the museum, but he later developed plans for a new library building, which after his retirement came to fruition as the British Library.|$|E

Independence and the 1999 transfer have also had a direct impact upon the Bank’s role in public life. Well over a decade since independence, monetary policy remains more politicized in France than in most Eurosystem member states, thus bucking the trend of a politicisation. In terms of the Bank’s core operations, however, political hostility has created only marginal difficulties...|$|E

It argues that although the women 2 ̆ 7 s Meetings were regarded as inferior to those of the men, they evolved alongside each other and operated in tandem, each with their own areas of responsibility.

40|$|Aim. The study {{aimed at}} {{describing}} contributing factors for the progression or regression of pressure ulcers {{in the care}} trajectory as they were understood by nurses working in hospitals or community care. Background. The development of pressure ulcers {{is considered to be}} connected with early prevention and awareness among nurses and some studies have indicated that the care trajectory may be a weak point. Design. The study was carried out with a qualitative design. Method. Fifteen nurses from two Swedish hospitals and 15 nurses from community care were interviewed during 2005. Qualitative content analysis was used to make an understanding of patterns possible. Findings. Three main categories arose, showing that pressure ulcers were considered to be affected in the care trajectory by factors related to the individual patient, to the healthcare personnel and to the healthcare structure. Hospital and community care nurses mostly had corresponding perceptions of these factors. Conclusion. The study both confirmed previous findings and added new knowledge about factors that may affect pressure ulcer in the trajectory of care. The informants' views of nurses' <b>responsibilities</b> <b>and</b> their attitudes towards the care of pressure ulcers could, along with their views on the organisation of care, increase the understanding of the occurrence of pressure ulcers. The need for development and clarification of the <b>organisation</b> <b>and</b> <b>responsibility</b> of pressure ulcer care in the care trajectory was stressed. Relevance to clinical practice.

40|$|It {{should be}} noted that a {{validation}} of the results generated several limitations to the research and the framework, leading to recommendations for further research. It was shown that due to multiple realities in the intersections of an innovation system, the results of the framework can not always be generalised and needs to have input from central actors of all institutions. Also, the way a component or relation contributes to anticipation, reflexivity and responsiveness should be revised, because the framework fails to capture gradations in such contribution. Next to that, the oversimplification of the characterisation of actors might prevent a good evaluation of the system. Furthermore, {{there appears to be a}} tension between effectiveness of the activities of <b>organisations</b> <b>and</b> <b>responsibility,</b> due to the large amount of resources that are needed. This means that to become responsible might take more time and effort, making the activities less efficient in reaching the objectives. This would make the framework more usable for the exploration phase, opposed to the other two phases, because in this phase the goal is generally to have a broad perspective, while in the construction and implementation phases a certain focus is required and intervention of many stakeholders might trouble the process. Also, the conditions of the framework should be further examined and enhanced, possibly with a role for CLEAN as the central actor. Lastly, in line with global issues, the framework could be extended with the Quintuple Helix with the environment as additional institution, so that innovation systems might also be in line with ecological constraints. Also, among some other operational limitations, the research failed to question all institutions, creating a potential bias in the results. More research is needed to validate the framework and the results, both within and outside of India. Still, a first exploratory step has been taken towards a framework for assessing and guiding towards responsible innovation systems. Sustainable Energy Technolog...|$|R

Design/methodology/approach - This paper analyses the sustainability approach of a sample of 52 Spanish listed firms. This process is based on the study of different indexes generated in order to evaluate the company’s commitment through its stakeholders, the social and financial performance of these <b>organisations,</b> <b>and</b> the relationship between them. Previous results showed a positive and not significant relationship between these variables and a positive financial performance. This paper replicates a former research by introducing a fuzzy- logic- based methodology in order to generate the aforementioned indexes.

40|$|In 2007, Australian voters {{elected a}} Labor Government and {{installed}} Kevin Rudd as Prime Minister. Rudd became Australia’s most popular leader, however, by mid- 2010 {{he had been}} abandoned by voters and cut down by his party. His successor, Julia Gillard, suffered a swifter reversal of fortune. Following a surge in support, Gillard raced to the polls only to emerge with a minority Government. Commentators see {{the rise and fall}} of Rudd as the creation and destruction of a political brand, and the switch to Gillard as a failed attempt at rebranding to stave off electoral defeat. Since Rudd’s election, commentators and practitioners increasingly have spoken of politicians and parties as brands. So, too, have researchers who offer valuable studies to support their arguments. There are, however, no tools for conceptualising the practice of political branding. To fill this gap and build understanding of the practice, I offer a conceptualisation of the brand oriented party and a model of political branding in Australia. The conceptualisation builds on the idea of political brand orientation (O’Cass and Voola 2011) and the market-oriented party model (Lees-Marshment 2001). The brand oriented party consciously chooses branding as a long-term strategy to create and sustain voter attachment and support. This conceptualisation takes account of a party’s ideology, <b>organisation</b> <b>and</b> normative <b>responsibilities.</b> The model builds on the conceptualisation above, as well as a strategic commercial branding process (Keller 2008) and an argument that branding is the new version of the permanent political campaign (Scammell 2007). The model takes account of the Australian electoral system, as it intersects with the dual tasks of governing and electioneering in the permanent campaign. Together, these new tools may assist in more rigorous analysis of political branding in Australia and similar systems...|$|R

This proposed use {{is in response to}} observed deficiencies of analysis considered to exist in those studies and strategies produced so far. These are mostly concerned with the financial and real resource aspects of plan making with special reference to the public sector provision of new infrastructure. Introduction presents a brief background of the present regional planning <b>organisation</b> <b>and</b> their <b>responsibility</b> for producing studies and strategies. Chapter 1 Looks at the Regional Role in the control and allocation of Public Expenditure with special reference to the framework of advice from central government as to how regional bodies should take into account the resource implications of regional studies and strategies. Chapter 2 Introduces some theoretical aspects on what constitutes a preferred strategy and examines the general form and content of studies and strategies so far produced in the context of these theoretical considerations and the advice from central government referred to in the previous chapter. Chapter 3 discusses a role for linear programming in strategy making and sets out the basic premises for its use. Previous uses of LP in planning are referred to with special reference to the problem of suitable objective functions. Chapter 4 describes the constructions of an LP matrix and, in some detail, how the estimates of the matrix coefficients were derived.

40|$|Research {{investigating}} {{the position of}} women in management has, largely, been confined within national boundaries. Over the last fifteen years, empirical studies of women in international management have been undertaken, predominantly in North America. In this research field, many questions remain unanswered or have been only partially addressed. The particular focus {{of this study is}} on the senior female international managerial career move in Europe — a relatively unexplored area. Fifty senior female expatriate managers were interviewed, representing a wide range of industry and service sectors. The study, for the first time, assesses an exclusively senior sample of female managers who have made at least one international career move. This study of senior females in international management makes a theoretical contribution, not only to the analysis of gender and international human resource management, but also to wider debates within the contemporary women in management and career theory literatures. The aims of the study were to develop an understanding of the senior female international career move in a European context in order to more fully understand both the covert and overt barriers that may limit women’s international career opportunities. The results of the study show that the senior international career move has largely been developed along a linear male model of career progression, a development which, taken together with gender disparity both in <b>organisations</b> <b>and</b> family <b>responsibilities,</b> frequently prevents women employees from reaching senior managerial positions. The study proposes a model of the senior female international managerial career move, thereby contributing primarily to the international human resource management literature.
