During his time on the board the bank tightened its regulations on loan repayments, a move that improved the stability of its capital. Gore used the bank {{for most of his}} personal deposits, but also drew on lines <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> as much as several thousand dollars. The bank shares he held paid relatively high dividends until 1791, when the bank received serious competition from the First Bank of the United States.|$|E

40|$|A Teacher 2 ̆ 7 s Certificate Law {{exists in}} Japan. This law was {{effective}} since 1949 and minor revision {{has been made}} a number of time. However, a major revision of this law was made in 1988 and was effective for school year 1990. The purposes of this study are following: 1) To clarify the status of curricula for the pre-service training of lower secondary science teachers in national colleges of education before and after revision of the Teacher 2 ̆ 7 s Certificate Law; 2) To Compere and to clarify the differences of new curricula from old ones; and 3) To find out the trends and probrems of curricula for the pre-service training of science teachers. The main results were as follows; 1) There is a variety of professional education curricula for lower secondary science teachers in national colleges of education. 2) In 1990, the average number <b>of</b> <b>credits</b> <b>for</b> Science Subjects (2 ̆ 7 Kyoka-senmon-kamoku 2 ̆ 7) was not different as compared with the case of 1988. However, the legal number <b>of</b> <b>credits</b> <b>for</b> Laboratories as a part of Science Subjects was changed from 4 to 8 after revision of the Teacher 2 ̆ 7 s Certificate Law. And actual number <b>of</b> <b>credits</b> <b>for</b> these subjects increased according to the law. The doubling of the number <b>of</b> <b>credits</b> <b>for</b> Laboratories meets with the approval of over 600 f the institutions. However, there is no backing of collateral increase of faculty members and budget, therefore a heavy burden must necessarily be imposed on science faculty members. 3) The number <b>of</b> <b>credits</b> <b>for</b> Professional Teaching Subjects (2 ̆ 7 Kyoshoku-senmon-kamoku 2 ̆ 7) increased after revision of the Teacher 2 ̆ 7 s Certificate Law. However, the number <b>of</b> <b>credits</b> <b>for</b> Methodology <b>of</b> Science Teaching (2 ̆ 7 Rika-Kyoikuho 2 ̆ 7), which is an integrative subject in pre-service training courses for science teachers, decreased. Though other science education subjects are offered in most of the institutions, yet students will have no time to study these subjects, because of Laboratories and Professional Teaching Subjects with the exception of Methodology of Science Teaching. ...|$|R

Upon his arrival in St. Louis, Leyba invited George Rogers Clark, an American colonel who was leading the Illinois campaign and had recently captured the town of Kaskaskia, to a two-day banquet and reception in his honor.

Prices fell and production slowed. Unemployment rose from 300,787 in 1929 to 1,018,953 in 1933. Trying to handle the crisis, the Fascist government nationalized the holdings of large banks which had accrued significant industrial securities. The government also issued new securities to provide a source <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> the banks and began enlisting the help of various cartels (consorzi) that had been created by Italian business leaders since 1922.

25|$|According to Polybius (bold {{emphasis}} added) Just at this time, Gaius Atilius, {{the other}} Consul, had reached Pisa from Sardinia with his legions {{and was on}} his way to Rome, marching in the opposite direction to the enemy. When the Celts were near Telamon in Etruria, their advanced foragers encountered the advance guard of Gaius and were made prisoners. On being examined by the Consul they narrated all that had recently occurred and told him of the presence of the two armies, stating that the Gauls were quite near and Lucius behind them. The news surprised him but at the same time made him very hopeful, as he thought he had caught the Gauls on the march between the two armies. He ordered his Tribunes to put the legions in fighting order and to advance thus at marching pace in so far as the nature of the ground allowed the attack in line. He himself had happily noticed a hill situated above the road by which the Celts must pass, and taking his cavalry with him, advanced at full speed, being anxious to occupy the crest of the hill before their arrival and be the first to begin the battle, feeling certain that thus he would get the largest share <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> the result.|$|E
25|$|On October 7, 2008, the Federal Reserve further {{expanded}} the collateral it will loan against to include commercial paper {{using the new}} Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF). The action made the Fed a crucial source <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> non-financial businesses in addition to commercial banks and investment firms. Fed officials said they'll buy {{as much of the}} debt as necessary to get the market functioning again. They refused to say how much that might be, but they noted that around $1.3 trillion worth of commercial paper would qualify. There was $1.61 trillion in outstanding commercial paper, seasonally adjusted, on the market as of October 1, 2008, {{according to the most recent}} data from the Fed. That was down from $1.70 trillion in the previous week. Since the summer of 2007, the market has shrunk from more than $2.2 trillion. This program lent out a total $738 billion before it was closed. Forty-five out of 81 of the companies participating in this program were foreign firms. Research shows that Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) recipients were twice as likely to participate in the program than other commercial paper issuers who did not take advantage of the TARP bailout. The Fed incurred no losses from the CPFF.|$|E
