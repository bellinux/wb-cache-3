40|$|This feature article {{introduces}} a deterministic approach for the rapid, single-step, direct synthesis of metal oxide nanowires. This approach {{is based on}} the exposure of thin metal samples to reactive <b>oxygen</b> <b>plasmas</b> and does not require any intervening processing or external substrate heating. The critical roles of the reactive <b>oxygen</b> <b>plasmas,</b> surface processes, and plasma-surface interactions that enable this growth are critically examined by using a deterministic viewpoint. The essentials of the experimental procedures and reactor design are presented and related to the key process requirements. The nucleation and growth kinetics is discussed for typical solid-liquid-solid and vapor-solid-solid mechanisms related to the synthesis of the oxide nanowires of metals with low (Ga, Cd) and high (Fe) melting points, respectively. Numerical simulations are focused on the possibility to predict the nanowire nucleation points through the interaction of the plasma radicals and ions with the nanoscale morphological features on the surface, as well as to control the localized 'hot spots' that in turn determine the nanowire size and shape. This generic approach can be applied to virtually any oxide nanoscale system and further confirms the applicability of the plasma nanoscience approaches for deterministic nanoscale synthesis and processing...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Moisture {{management}} {{is the ability}} of a fabric to transport moisture away from the skin to the garment’s outer surface in multi-dimensions and it is one of key performance criteria in today’s textiles for garments for various end uses. This property has a significant effect on the human perception of moisture sensations as well as the growth of microorganisms. Plasma treatment on textiles is a novel dry processing technique used to enhance comfort, functional and aesthetic properties of regenerated cellulosic fabrics {{and at the same time}} reduce the pollution load on the environment. In this study air, argon and <b>oxygen</b> gas <b>plasma</b> treated pure regenerated bamboo fabric in single jersey construction were tested for their moisture management capacity using “SDL-ATLAS moisture management tester”. Dynamic liquid transport properties of textiles such as wetting time, maximum absorption rate, maximum wetted radius and spreading speed were measured. The result revealed that the type of plasma treatment and the duration of air, argon and <b>oxygen</b> gas <b>plasma</b> treatment have significant effect on all the parameters of the moisture management capacity. In case of all the plasma treated samples the wetting time and the absorption rate (%/sec) increased, both for the top and bottom surface with the highest duration of 8. 2 seconds and highest absorption rate of 64. 99 (%/sec) respectively, in case of 10 minutes argon plasma treated sample. The spreading speed (mm/sec) decreased in case of all the plasma treated samples. Slow spreading of 2. 1 (mm/sec) was recorded in case of 5 minutes air plasma treated sample as compared to 3. 21 (mm/sec) in case of the untreated sample. In case of argon and <b>oxygen</b> gas <b>plasma</b> the value of accumulative one way transport index and overall moisture management capacity increased, with the highest value of 265 and 2. 04 recorded in case of 10 minutes <b>oxygen</b> gas <b>plasma</b> treate...|$|R

Initially, the team used a silicon wafer as a substrate but found that the tape’s adhesive power increased by almost 1,000 times if they used a soft bonding substrate such as Scotch tape - This is because the flexible substrate yields a much higher ratio of the number of setae in contact with the surface over the total number of setae.|$|E
50|$|Typically, {{monatomic}} <b>oxygen</b> <b>plasma</b> {{is created}} by exposing oxygen gas at a low pressure (O2) to high power radio waves, which ionise it. This process is done under vacuum {{in order to create}} a plasma. As the plasma is formed, many free radicals are created which could damage the wafer. Newer, smaller circuitry is increasingly susceptible to these particles. Originally, plasma was generated in the process chamber, but as the need to get rid of free radicals has increased, many machines now use a downstream plasma configuration, where plasma is formed remotely and the desired particles are channeled to the wafer. This allows electrically charged particles time to recombine before they reach the wafer surface, and prevents damage to the wafer surface.|$|E

X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy depth profile analysis showed that MgO layers had similar thicknesses and mixing layers as previous aluminum implantation. A much thinner and shallower layer was deposited on Mylar with metallic Mg together with the oxide, probably due to a lower bias voltage caused by variable plasma response to the applied voltage.
