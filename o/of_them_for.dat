Soon after, Lenin's associates burned all the 500-ruble notes remaining in their possession.|$|E

5|$|Ole Miss {{scored the}} only {{points of the}} third quarter on a 12-yard Randall Mackey {{touchdown}} run that capped a 70-yard drive that saw the Rebels convert a pair of fourth downs. The final margin of 33–14 was provided by a pair of Shelley field goals from 26 and 24 yards in the fourth quarter. In the game, McCarron eclipsed Brody Croyle's team record of 190 consecutive pass attempts without throwing an interception.
