5|$|Ballast Point got {{its name}} from the {{practice}} of ships discarding their ballast there on arriving in San Diego Bay and taking <b>on</b> <b>ballast</b> as they left for the open ocean. Fort Guijarros was constructed at Ballast Point in 1797. Ballast Point and La Playa are now on the grounds of Naval Base Point Loma.|$|E
25|$|Traditional sailboats are monohulls, but {{multi-hull}} catamarans and trimarans {{are gaining}} popularity. Monohull boats generally rely <b>on</b> <b>ballast</b> for stability and usually are displacement hulls. This stabilizing ballast can, in {{boats designed for}} racing, {{be as much as}} 50% of the weight of the boat, but is generally around 30%. It creates two problems; one, it gives the monohull tremendous inertia, making it less maneuverable and reducing its acceleration. Secondly, unless it has been built with buoyant foam or air tanks, if a monohull fills with water, it will sink.|$|E
25|$|Chief Seattle's {{daughter}} Princess Angeline {{continued to}} live on the central waterfront until {{the end of her life}} (she died in 1896). It is not known exactly where her beach shack stood, but photos indicate that it was somewhere just north of the present-day Pike Hill Climb. Also into the 1890s, the Duwamish camped <b>on</b> <b>Ballast</b> Island at the foot of Washington Street in the present-day Pioneer Square neighborhood. The mound had been created from ballast and other material dumped by ships. In the late 1890s, Ballast Island was planked over as part a continuation of Railroad Avenue south of Yesler Way. Later, it was dredged and became part of the harbor.|$|E

500|$|In {{three days}} of fine weather, Gothenburg {{travelled}} [...] from Palmerston (Darwin) to Somerset on Cape York. The weather began to worsen so the ship stopped to take <b>on</b> <b>ballast</b> at Somerset. While she was anchored, conditions deteriorated {{to a point where}} both anchor chains parted. After the loss of the anchors, Gothenburg was forced to prematurely steam out [...] because of strong currents; at that point, she brought up for the night.|$|E
2500|$|In the 2000s, the Port Authority started {{planning}} {{on a project}} to allow larger container ships to use the Kill Van Kull. [...] The expansion of the Panama Canal, which allows the passage of larger ships coming from Asia to reach the East Coast, also made the bridge too low for these larger ships to pass under it {{on the way to}} and from Newark Bay. [...] Its clearance of between [...] above the Kill Van Kull depending on the tide meant that some contemporary ships, which could reach [...] above the waterline, had to fold down antenna masts, take <b>on</b> <b>ballast,</b> or wait for low tide to pass through.|$|E

Another thing that makes this system special {{is the use of}} [...] "firm track" [...] (i.e. with rails fastened to a solid trackbed, rather than to sleepers <b>on</b> <b>ballast)</b> in almost all tunnels, although not at Langwasser Mitte (U1) and the adjoining tunnel up to just before Gemeinschaftshaus. Also, ballast is still found, but only on the inbound track, at the entrance to Schoppershof station (U2).|$|E

2500|$|Provisioned and {{manned by}} July, the vessel was {{returned}} to the English Channel to assist in safe convoy for a fleet of West Indiamen, and then in company with Tartar to hunt privateers. She had her first and only victory within weeks of leaving port, capturing the French vessel La Marquise de Chateaunois on 17 July. [...] Despite this victory Tartars Prize was experiencing considerable difficulty with her long, sleek design, which increased her speed but made her unwieldy and liable to roll in heavy weather. In August Baillie was forced to make port in Spanish Corunna {{so that he could}} restow the cargo and take <b>on</b> <b>ballast</b> to stabilise the ship. He returned Tartars Prize to sea in September, where she promptly sprang a leak and started taking on 18 inches of water each hour. Forced back into port for repairs, Baillie wrote to Admiralty requesting stronger decking and timbers so that the hull would not keep opening up at the seams.|$|E
2500|$|On 25 May 1871, Constellation was recommissioned for midshipmen {{training}} cruises; {{this was}} a duty she performed for the next 22 years. In 1871–1872, she was rearmed with eight [...] Dahlgren guns, plus one 100-pound Parrott rifle and one [...] Dahlgren gun, which would also allow her {{to be used as}} a gunnery training ship. From March to July 1878, Constellation was used to transfer exhibits to France for the Exposition Universelle in Paris. On 10 November 1879, she was sent to Gibraltar with a cargo of stores and a replacement crew for the Mediterranean Squadron flagship. After returning to New York, she was modified to carry a large cargo of food and other supplies to Ireland for the relief effort for the 1879 Irish famine. To accommodate as much food as possible, some of the ship's guns were removed, along with some of her ballast. She was able to carry more than 2,500 barrels of flour and potatoes. She left the United States in March 1880 and arrived in Queenstown (now Cobh), Ireland on 20 April, where she sent the food ashore, took <b>on</b> <b>ballast,</b> and returned to the United States, arriving in June.|$|E

In 1962 the United States Navy built a submarine base <b>on</b> <b>Ballast</b> Point as home port for the Pacific Fleet's nuclear attack submarines.

50|$|Although the Rosstown Railway {{has become}} infamous as an abject failure, the tracks were used {{from time to}} time. Construction and ballast trains were often {{on the line in}} the late 1880s and early 1890s, hauled by Victorian Railways {{locomotives}} that had been hired by Ross. The largest of these was a Y-class locomotive that was used <b>on</b> <b>ballasting</b> runs. Tenders had been let for the construction of rolling stock to be used by Ross, but nothing ever came of those.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} a new method is {{presented}} for {{the estimation of}} actions on sleepers and the pressures that develop under the seating surface of the sleeper and are transmitted <b>on</b> the <b>ballast.</b> Results from the tests performed <b>on</b> the <b>ballast</b> used in the Greek network are also presented. The tests were conducted in laboratories in France, Austria, and Greece, and resulted in the modification of the Greek technical specifications. Moreover, {{the need for a}} new method for the calculation of the actions on the railway superstructure is analyzed in terms of track maintenance and passenger's comfort. Finally, the influence of the limestone <b>ballast</b> <b>on</b> the track response as derived from the tests and theoretical analysis and the need for new higher demands in the specifications are also discussed. © 2009 Taylor & Francis Group, London...|$|R

The type of fastening used, rigid or resilient, {{plays a major role in}} the magnitude of the stress at the seating surface of the tie <b>on</b> the <b>ballast.</b> Track maintenance and renewal are planned accordingly, always taking into consideration local conditions, on the basis of a combination of control data from measuring systems, visual observation, and economic data.
