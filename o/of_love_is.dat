5|$|Another {{difference}} in Troilus' characterisation from the Filostrato {{is that he}} is no longer misogynistic in the beginning. Instead of mocking lovers because of their putting trust in women, he mocks them because of how love affects them. Troilus' vision <b>of</b> <b>love</b> <b>is</b> stark: total commitment offers total fulfilment; any form of failure means total rejection. He is unable to comprehend the subtleties and complexities that underlie Criseyde's vacillations and Pandarus' manoeuvrings.|$|E
5|$|The Dawn of Love, {{also known}} as Venus Now Wakes, and Wakens Love, is an oil {{painting}} on canvas by English artist William Etty, first exhibited in 1828 and currently in the Russell-Cotes Art Gallery & Museum in Bournemouth. Loosely based on a passage from John Milton's 1634 masque Comus, it shows a nude Venus leaning across to wake the sleeping Love by stroking his wings. While Etty often included nude figures in his work he rarely depicted physical intimacy, and owing to this The Dawn <b>of</b> <b>Love</b> <b>is</b> one of his more unusual paintings. The open sensuality of the work was intended to present {{a challenge to the}} viewer mirroring the plot of Comus, in which the heroine is tempted by desire but remains rational and detached.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of process theology has challenged the Irenaean tradition by teaching that God's power is limited {{and that he}} cannot be responsible for evil. Twentieth century philosopher Alvin Plantinga supported {{the idea that this}} world is the best possible world, arguing that the good in the world (including God's infinite goodness) outweighs the evil and proposing that the ultimate good of God's sacrifice when Jesus was crucified necessitated the existence of evil. His free will defence was not a theodicy because he was trying to show the logical compatibility of evil and the existence of God, rather than the probability of God. D. Z. Phillips and Fyodor Dostoyevsky challenged the instrumental use of suffering, suggesting that love cannot be expressed through suffering. However, Dostoyevsky also states that the beauty <b>of</b> <b>love</b> <b>is</b> evident, in that love can continue to grow, withstand and overcome even the most evil acts. Michael Tooley argued that the magnitude of suffering is excessive and that, in some cases, cannot lead to moral development. French theologian Henri Blocher criticised Hick's universalism, arguing that such a view negates free will, which was similarly important to the theodicy.|$|E

50|$|In society, there <b>are</b> {{four types}} <b>of</b> <b>love</b> that <b>are</b> visible: agape, phileo, storge, eros. Agape {{is a type}} <b>of</b> {{unconditional}} <b>love</b> which <b>is</b> less common in society but more apparent between individuals and their god. Phileo <b>is</b> a <b>love</b> used to describe friendship between individuals. This <b>love</b> <b>is</b> commonly seen between friends in public, especially as displays of warm gestures. Storge <b>is</b> another type <b>of</b> <b>love</b> that <b>is</b> expressed through parenting. Eros <b>is</b> a romantic <b>love</b> which <b>was</b> a type <b>of</b> <b>love</b> forbidden in early society and is still forbidden in some societies today. These different types <b>of</b> <b>love</b> <b>are</b> expressed differently based on culture.|$|R

25|$|In 1981, Mordecai Marcus {{argued for}} a new meaning of Eros (Love) and Thanatos (Death) in this play. In his view, Shakespeare {{suggests}} that love requires the risk of death.

He also viewed the play as suggesting that the healing force <b>of</b> <b>love</b> <b>is</b> connected to the acceptance of death, and vice versa.|$|E
