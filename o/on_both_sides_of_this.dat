25|$|The Zagros Mountains have {{a totally}} {{sedimentary}} origin and are made primarily of limestone. In the Elevated Zagros or the Higher Zagros, the Paleozoic rocks {{could be found}} mainly in the upper and higher sections of the peaks of the Zagros Mountains along the Zagros main fault. <b>On</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> fault, there are Mesozoic rocks, a combination of Triassic and Jurassic rocks that are surrounded by Cretaceous rocks on both sides. The Folded Zagros (the mountains south of the Elevated Zagros and almost parallel to the main Zagros fault) is formed mainly of Tertiary rocks, with the Paleogene rocks south of the Cretaceous rocks and then the Neogene rocks south of the Paleogene rocks.|$|E
25|$|The frieze is 113 meters long, {{which makes}} it the longest {{surviving}} frieze of Greek Antiquity after the Parthenon frieze. On the western side it is interrupted by the ca. 20 meter wide stairway, which cuts into the foundation on that side and leads to a superstructure with columns. <b>On</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> stairway there are projections constructed and decorated {{in a manner similar}} to the rest of the encircling frieze. The three-wing superstructure is relatively narrow compared with the base. The pillars surrounding the superstructure have platforms with profiles and Ionic capitals. There are many statues on the roof: a quadriga of horses, lion griffins, centaurs and deities, as well as uncompleted gargoyles. The upper hall gives a spacious impression thanks to the widely spaced columns. An additional columned hall was also planned for the inner courtyard where the fire altar itself was located, but not implemented. A frieze was installed there at eye level depicting the life of the mythical founder of the city, Telephus. Although no remains of paint have been found, it can be assumed that the entire structure was brightly painted in antiquity.|$|E
500|$|In the 1967 British Home Championship, Baxter {{produced}} a dominating but controversial performance for Scotland, tantalising England, {{who had won}} the World Cup in 1966, by playing [...] "keepie uppie" [...] (ball juggling) while waiting for teammates to get into good positions. Some commentators accepted that humiliating the opposition was a valid objective, while others regarded it as childish and thought Scotland should have won a more convincing victory than the actual 3–2 scoreline. Teammate Denis Law expressed opinions <b>on</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> debate, saying that Baxter was [...] "the best player on the park" [...] and {{the main reason for}} the Scots' victory, but complaining that Baxter's lack of urgency had prevented Scotland from thoroughly avenging the 9–3 defeat in April 1961. Alex Ferguson said Baxter's performance [...] "could have been set to music". In this game Baxter also conspired with Billy Bremner against Alan Ball, sending Bremner a [...] "50-50" [...] pass, which allowed Bremner to [...] "hit Ball like a train" [...] when Ball contested possession. As Scotland were the first team to beat England after the 1966 FIFA World Cup, the Tartan Army proclaimed themselves [...] "unofficial world champions".|$|E

500|$|The Times-Picayune writer Benjamin Morrison {{praised the}} [...] "unexpectedly understated" [...] {{performance}} of Williams and praised the episode {{for not being}} simple or formulaic. He suggested viewers who were crime victims themselves would be particularly moved by the script. Hal Boedeker, television critic with The Miami Herald, called the episode an [...] "uncompromising hour" [...] and [...] "the highest order for network TV". He said Williams [...] "astonishes in every scene", and praised the script for not racing over topics as many television shows do, but rather taking [...] "full measure {{of the weight of}} grief". Elaine Liner, television critic with the Corpus Christi Caller-Times, described Williams' performance as [...] "heartbreaking", but particularly praised the writers for [...] "taking the show to a higher level" [...] by making the perpetrator sympathetic and three-dimensional, not only the victim. Liner said, [...] "Fontana succeeds in fleshing out the characters <b>on</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> tragedy." [...] Bob Langford of The News & Observer called the episode [...] "brilliant" [...] and praised it for focusing not on the crime but on the effects of it, as well as the realistic portrayals regarding race, such as concerns the crime would keep away white tourists. Langford said it was occasionally preachy, but said [...] "Sometimes, a good sermon is what we need. Amazing that one this powerful can come from a TV show." ...|$|E

[...] In Rowling's post-donation blog post in mid-June 2014, she explained that she is [...] "friendly" [...] with members of both campaigns and stated a belief that [...] "there are intelligent, thoughtful people <b>on</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> question".|$|E

2500|$|Before the 1953 New Jersey {{state highway}} renumbering, NJ 15 was {{designated}} as State Highway Route 6A, beginning in 1927. In the renumbering, NJ 15 was assigned. Originally Route 15 was a 2 lane road {{all the way}} down to Picatinny Arsenal. The road originally went through downtown Sparta and today that road is known as Route 181. In the mid-1960s, Route 15 was to expand and become 4 lanes several miles into Jefferson Township. But businesses were <b>on</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> road making a widening difficult. So the additional 2 lanes were built behind the businesses on the left side of the road heading south. In 1974, a bypass freeway was built around the Sparta Business district and into Jefferson Township. The freeway began several miles into Sparta and would extend to the area where 15 was divided into 4 lanes back in the 1960s.|$|E
2500|$|The bow {{section of}} the Hasholme logboat has a most {{original}} design. It is made of two parts, lower and upper bow timbers, which together formed a front enclosure to the log. The lower bow piece is [...] long and [...] thick. <b>On</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> timber there are symmetrical rebates which match similar rebates on the main hull as well as series of cleats with transverse holes through which {{the second and third}} transverse timbers passed. Those transverse timbers, three in total, not only fasten the lower bow timber to both sides of the hull, but also strengthened and linked the bow section. Forward of the groove for the foremost timber, there were three large vertical holes. The upper bow piece is also around 60cm long and has a rather complex shape. The bottom {{section of the}} upper bow timber has a transverse lip to envelope {{the leading edge of the}} lower bow timber, and a series of longitudinal grooves on both sides to fit over the forward ends of the washstrakes of the upper part of the hull. This upper timber was fastened to the lower timber by three vertical tree-nails through corresponding holes in the lower bow. Those tree-nails were approximately [...] long and 0.6cm (¼in) thick.|$|E

[...] <b>On</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> mandapa, there are two footpaths in a curved fashion taking you to the inner area directly. [...] If you walk directly through the mandapa, you pass through Swagata Nilaya - welcome abode and [...] reach another structure(Atma Purna Nivas) used for meditations and prayer meetings. [...] Then comes the residences for inamates like Dasavatara cottages, Star shaped Buildings, pyramidal buildings, Om Building, Yin Yang and the 24 hermitages.

60|$|Shortly {{afterwards}} {{one of the}} crossed {{plants in}} Pot 1 died; another became much diseased and stunted; and the third never grew to its full height. They {{seemed to have been}} all injured, probably by some larva gnawing their roots. Therefore all the plants <b>on</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> pot were rejected in the subsequent measurements. When the plants were fully grown they were again measured to the tips of the highest leaves, and the eleven crossed plants now averaged 68.1, and the eleven self-fertilised plants 62.34 inches in height; or as 100 to 91. In all four pots a crossed plant flowered before any one of the self-fertilised; but three of the plants did not flower at all. Those that flowered were also measured to the summits of the male flowers: the ten crossed plants averaged 66.51, and the nine self-fertilised plants 61.59 inches in height; or as 100 to 93.|$|E
60|$|The {{journey from}} Guasco to Copiapo, {{owing to the}} utterly desert nature of the country, was {{necessarily}} so hurried, that I do not consider my notes worth giving. In the valley of Copiapo some of the sections are very interesting. From the sea {{to the town of}} Copiapo, a distance estimated at thirty miles, the mountains are composed of greenstone, granite, andesite, and blackish porphyry, together with some dusky-green feldspathic rocks, which I believe to be altered clay-slate: these mountains are crossed by many brown-coloured dikes, running north and south. Above the town, the main valley runs in a south-east and even more southerly course towards the Cordillera, where it is divided into three great ravines, by the northern one of which, called Jolquera, I penetrated for a short distance. The section, Section 1/3 in Plate 1, gives an eye-sketch of the structure and composition of the mountains <b>on</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> valley: a straight east and west line from the town to the Cordillera is perhaps not more than thirty miles, but along the valley the distance is much greater. Wherever the valley trended very southerly, I have endeavoured to contract the section into its true proportion. This valley, I may add, rises much more gently than any other valley which I saw in Chile.|$|E
