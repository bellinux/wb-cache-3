5|$|In early 1858, a group <b>of</b> <b>peasants</b> from Keserwan lodged {{a formal}} {{complaint}} against the Khazens to Khurshid Pasha, the Ottoman governor of Beirut. Later, in March 1858, the Khazens held a summit {{for the people}} of Keserwan to garner support for their nomination of a new qaimaqam. Instead, the peasants participating in the summit voiced their dissent against the Khazens and in October, several villages in Keserwan entered into an alliance against the Khazen sheikhs.

5|$|In {{some parts}} of Iron Age Scotland, quite unlike almost all of {{recorded}} history {{right up to the}} present day, there {{does not seem to have}} been an hierarchical elite. Studies have shown that these stone roundhouses, with massively thick walls must have contained virtually the entire population of islands such as Barra and North Uist. Iron Age settlement patterns in Scotland are not homogenous, but in these places there is no sign of a privileged class living in large castles or forts, or of an elite priestly caste or <b>of</b> <b>peasants</b> with no access to the kind of accommodation enjoyed by the middle classes.|$|E
5|$|Refused legal {{representation}} or bail, Lenin denied all {{charges against him}} but remained imprisoned for a year before sentencing. He spent this time theorising and writing. In this work {{he noted that the}} rise of industrial capitalism in Russia had caused large numbers <b>of</b> <b>peasants</b> to move to the cities, where they formed a proletariat. From his Marxist perspective, Lenin argued that this Russian proletariat would develop class consciousness, which would in turn lead them to violently overthrow Tsarism, the aristocracy, and the bourgeoisie and to establish a proletariat state that would move toward socialism.|$|E
5|$|The 1834 revolt and the {{immediate}} aftermath reduced the male population of Palestine by about one-fifth. This decrease is attributed to the large numbers <b>of</b> <b>peasants</b> who were either deported to Egypt to work in manufacturing, drafted into Egypt's military, or abandoned their villages and farms to join the Bedouin nomadic populations. Around 10,000 peasants were deported to Egypt and the general population was disarmed. The conscription orders were extended beyond the Muslim population to the local Christians. Taxes were also extended from landed property to include livestock as well. As Ibrahim consolidated his hold over Palestine and disarmed the population, banditry by local tribesmen and civil strife was largely eliminated.|$|E

5|$|The Finnish Civil War (27 January – 15 May 1918) {{concerned}} {{leadership and}} control of Finland during {{the transition from a}} Grand Duchy of the Russian Empire to an independent state. The conflict formed a part of the national, political, and social turmoil caused by World War I (Eastern Front) in Europe. The war was fought between the Reds, led by the Social Democratic Party and the Whites, conducted by the non-socialist, conservative-led senate. The paramilitary Red Guards, composed of industrial and agrarian workers, controlled the cities and industrial centers of southern Finland. The paramilitary White Guards, composed <b>of</b> <b>peasants</b> and middle-class and upper-class factions, controlled rural central and northern Finland.|$|E
5|$|The Middle Ages saw further {{improvements}} in agriculture. Monasteries spread throughout Europe and became important centers {{for the collection}} of knowledge related to agriculture and forestry. The manorial system allowed large landowners to control their land and its laborers, in the form <b>of</b> <b>peasants</b> or serfs. During the medieval period, the Arab world was critical in the exchange of crops and technology between the European, Asia and African continents. Besides transporting numerous crops, they introduced the concept of summer irrigation to Europe and developed {{the beginnings of the}} plantation system of sugarcane growing through the use of slaves for intensive cultivation.|$|E

Thơ contradicted Nhu's earlier reports {{on the success of}} the program, claiming that only 20% of the 8,600 existing strategic hamlets were under Saigon's control, with the rest having been taken over by the communists. Those hamlets that were deemed to be tenable were consolidated, while the remainder were dismantled and their inhabitants returned to their ancestral land.|$|E

Among many honors, he held an honorary degree at the University of Oxford. He was a prolific writer, and touched on numerous subjects during his long academic career. He wrote several biographies; his works on Johan Sverdrup and Henrik Ibsen spanned several volumes each. He became known for syntheses on Norwegian history, and emphasised the roles <b>of</b> <b>peasants</b> and wage labourers as historical agents who found their place in an expanding notion of the Norwegian nation. He was also interested in the United States and its history, and was a pioneer in Norway in this respect.|$|E
5|$|Crispi was {{replaced}} {{as prime minister}} by Antonio Di Rudinì in February 1891, who was succeeded by Giovanni Giolitti in May 1892. On January 20, 1893, when peasants of Caltavuturo occupied communal land that they claimed was theirs, local authorities killed 13 and wounded 21 in the Caltavuturo massacre. Disturbances continued throughout the year. The Fasci started out as urban movements, animated by artisans, which evolved into a more popular and combative mass movement with the adherence of sulphur miners, and in a later stage with the involvement <b>of</b> <b>peasants</b> and sharecroppers. In the autumn of 1893, labour conflicts in the cities and the mines came together with the protests and claims of the farmers. The movement reached its greatest breadth in the manifestations against taxes, involving the lowest tiers {{of the city and}} the countryside, becoming difficult, if not impossible, to control by its leaders.|$|E
5|$|During {{the night}} from December 5 to December 6, Petras Vileišis printed 36,000 {{copies of the}} {{resolution}} for distribution. After the assembly, notorious for its loud, lengthy and intense debates, the delegates returned to their communities and started {{to carry out its}} resolutions. The old Russian administrations were replaced in 125 out of the 280 volosts (82 in Kaunas, 33 in Suvalkai, and 10 in Vilnius Governorates). These communities elected their own representatives, organized their own schools where classes were taught in the Lithuanian language, and stopped paying taxes. While the first Russian responses were disorganized and confused, the authorities soon marshaled their armed forces and returned the situation back to normal. The process was relatively peaceful; {{there were only a few}} clashes between armed groups <b>of</b> <b>peasants</b> and Tsarist military forces. Unlike in neighboring Latvia or Estonia, peasants did not rise against their landlords. A number of the most prominent activists of this movement were arrested and sent to Siberia.|$|E

5|$|Support for the Provisional Government {{began to}} be tested when the issue of land reform and corvées was again brought to the forefront. Aside from the {{important}} conservative forces, opponents of the measure were to be found inside the leadership body itself, and included the moderates Heliade Rădulescu and Ioan Odobescu. Revolutionaries who favored passing land into the property <b>of</b> <b>peasants</b> were divided over the amount {{that was to be}} ceded, as well as over the issue of compensation to be paid to boyars. A compromise was reached through postponing, with a decision taken to submit all proposals to the vote of the Assembly, which was yet to be convened, instead of drafting a decree. Nevertheless, a Proclamation to estate-holders was issued (June 28, 1848), indicating that the reform was to be eventually enforced in exchange for unspecified sums, and calling on peasants to fulfill their corvées until autumn of the same year.|$|E
5|$|The 8 March Revolution {{has often}} been viewed as a mere {{military}} coup, but it had many of the ingredients of national revolts from below. The revolution was led by an anti-oligarchical alliance of a radicalised lower middle class, strategic members of the officer corps, marginalised minorities and a significant number <b>of</b> <b>peasants</b> who were mobilised for agrarian conflict. In an international context, the revolution took place because the state boundaries established by France were artificial and the hostility within the newly established Syria {{to the creation of}} Israel. The traditional elite that took power in Syria when the country gained independence had come to power during the French Mandate of Syria and Lebanon. The external imposition of arbitrary state boundaries on Syria with no corresponding popular acceptance led to discontent. The national struggle was shaped by ideologies such as Arab nationalism, pan-Islamism and Greater Syrianism. The plebeian character of the struggle, and the radical ideologies, spawned radical solutions to the agrarian problem.|$|E
5|$|The Mongol-led Yuan dynasty (1271–1368) ruled {{before the}} {{establishment}} of the Ming dynasty. Explanations for the demise of the Yuan include institutionalized ethnic discrimination against Han Chinese that stirred resentment and rebellion, overtaxation of areas hard-hit by inflation, and massive flooding of the Yellow River {{as a result of the}} abandonment of irrigation projects. Consequently, agriculture and the economy were in shambles, and rebellion broke out among the hundreds of thousands <b>of</b> <b>peasants</b> called upon to work on repairing the dykes of the Yellow River. A number of Han Chinese groups revolted, including the Red Turbans in 1351. The Red Turbans were affiliated with the White Lotus, a Buddhist secret society. Zhu Yuanzhang was a penniless peasant and Buddhist monk who joined the Red Turbans in 1352; he soon gained a reputation after marrying the foster daughter of a rebel commander. In 1356, Zhu's rebel force captured the city of Nanjing, which he would later establish as the capital of the Ming dynasty.|$|E
