40|$|Background: CD 4,CD 8 T cells, T-helper 1 (Th 1) and T-helper 2 (Th 2) have an {{important}} role in host defence in pulmonary tuberculosis. Aim of the work: Evaluate the role of some T-lymphocyte subsets in treatment failure of tuberculous patients. Subjects and methods: This study was carried out on 52 persons divided into 4 groups: group I control, group II active TB patients, group III Responders to treatment and group IV (non-responders). Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and peripheral blood samples from patients and controls were examined for the frequency of CD 4, CD 8, Th 1 and Th 2 cells using flow cytometry.

5|$|Copernicium is {{calculated}} to have several properties {{that differ from}} its lighter homologues in group 12, zinc, cadmium and mercury; due to relativistic effects, it may even give up its 6d electrons instead of its 7s ones. Copernicium has also been calculated to possibly show the oxidation state +4, while mercury shows it in only one compound of disputed existence and zinc and cadmium do not show it at all, although more recent calculations cast doubt on this possibility. It has also been predicted {{to be more difficult}} to oxidize copernicium from its neutral state than the <b>other</b> <b>group</b> 12 elements.|$|E
5|$|Darmstadtium is {{the eighth}} {{member of the}} 6d series of {{transition}} metals.

Calculations on its ionization potentials and atomic and ionic radii are similar to that of its lighter homologue platinum, thus implying that darmstadtium's basic properties will resemble those of the <b>other</b> <b>group</b> 10 elements, nickel, palladium, and platinum.|$|E
