They end up having a conversation over {{what they would do}} with their lives, if they were not working for Dunder Mifflin. Jim jokingly says that he would be a beet growing competitor during the national contests while Harry would retire after selling one big item such as an airplane. Before he leaves, Harry says that Robert will be the ruin of the company and says they will not be working for Dunder Mifflin in six months, leaving a look of concern on Dwight and Jim's faces.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Scully {{visit the}} murderer's house, where Mulder sees a {{repairman}} {{working on the}} cable line. They find hundreds of video tapes of the news. Scully believes all the violence the man watched on TV may have {{led him to the}} murders, something Mulder does not believe. That night Scully watches the tapes, seeing if there are any clues to why the man committed murder. She steps <b>outside</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> break and sees Mulder in a car talking to the Cigarette Smoking Man. In the morning Scully suspiciously asks Mulder if he moved the car in the night. When Mulder tells her he only went out for a paper earlier, she believes he is lying. The next day a similar murder occurs when a woman thinks she sees her husband in a hammock with another woman; in reality she has killed her neighbor who was in a hammock with his dog. Mulder sees the same cable repairman near the house, who escapes from him. Climbing up on the telephone pole Mulder finds a device inside the cable box.|$|E
25|$|An {{investigator}} later {{testified that}} 146 spent shell casings were recovered inside the building.

A medic who treated Hasan said his pockets were full of pistol magazines. When the shooting ended, he was still carrying 177 rounds of unfired ammunition in his pockets, contained in both 20- and 30-round magazines. The incident, which lasted about 10 minutes, resulted in 13 killed12 soldiers and one civilian; 11 died at the scene, and two died later in a hospital; and 30 people wounded.|$|E

The warriors apologized to the commander for taking the fort, saying that [...] "they were obliged to do it by the other Nations." [...] In contrast with other forts, the Natives did not kill the British captives at Ouiatenon.|$|E
500|$|The first Indian KFC was a two-storey outlet on {{the fashionable}} Brigade Road in Bangalore in June 1995. According to {{journalist}} Michael White, {{the company could}} not have chosen a [...] "more difficult venue for its maiden entrée into the country". Bangalore housed {{the headquarters of the}} Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha, one of the most influential, vocal and anti-foreign investment farmers' associations in the country. The first outlet suffered protests from left wing, anti-globalisation and environmental campaigners, as well as local farmers, who objected to the chain bypassing local producers. Many Indians were concerned about the onslaught of consumerism, the loss of national self-sufficiency, and the disruption of indigenous traditions. The protests came to a head in August 1995, when the Bangalore outlet was repeatedly ransacked. The KFC outlet in Bangalore demanded, and received, a police van permanently parked <b>outside</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> year. The outlet was closed on September 13, 1995 by local authorities, who claimed the company used illegally high amounts of monosodium glutamate (MSG) in its food. The outlet re-opened a few hours later as the result of an appeal by KFC to the Karnataka High Court. The company stated the recipe was no different than that used in any other KFC store. Rural activist M. D. Nanjundaswamy claimed KFC would adversely affect the health of the impoverished, by diverting grain from poor people to make the more profitable animal feed. Environmentalist Maneka Gandhi joined the anti-KFC movement. A second outlet opened in Delhi, but was closed by the authorities throughout November, purportedly for health reasons, but more likely to avoid a repetition of the Bangalore incident. The Delhi outlet soon closed permanently.|$|E

2500|$|Guaguancó uses three congas. The {{smallest}} conga is {{the lead}} drum known as quinto. The following nine-measure quinto excerpt is from the guaguancó “La polémica” by Los Muñequitos de Matanzas (1988). This passage moves between the main modes of playing (A,B,C). The A section is the basic lock or ride, {{as it is known}} in North America. It spans one clave (measure). An alternate phrase (B) is also one measure in length. Cross-beats, the basis of the third section (C), contradict the meter. By alternating between the lock and the cross, the quinto creates larger rhythmic phrases that expand and contract over several clave cycles. The great Los Muñequintos quintero Jesús Alfonso (1949–2009) described this phenomenon as a man getting “drunk at a party, going <b>outside</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> while, and then coming back inside.” ...|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the first}} {{paintings}} of the view was F611 Mountainous Landscape Behind Saint-Rémy, now in Copenhagen. Van Gogh {{made a number of}} sketches for the painting, of which F1547 The Enclosed Wheatfield After a Storm is typical. It is unclear whether the painting was made in his studio or outside. In his June 9 letter describing it, he mentions he had been working <b>outside</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few days. Van Gogh described the second of the two landscapes he mentions he was working on, {{in a letter to his}} sister Wil on 16 June 1889. This is F719 Green Field, now in Prague, and the first painting at the asylum he definitely painted outside en plein air. F1548 Wheat field, Saint-Rémy de Provence, now in New York, is a study for it. Two days later, Vincent wrote Theo that he had painted [...] "a starry sky".|$|E
2500|$|Howell was {{restrained}} to Berdella's bed for {{a period}} of approximately 28 hours. Throughout this period of captivity, Berdella repeatedly drugged, tortured, raped and violated the youth with foreign objects, repeatedly ignoring Howell's intermittent questioning as to why he was being treated in this manner, and pleas to be freed before, according to Berdella, the youth [...] "either asphyxiated on [...] vomit, or the combination of the gag and the medicines were too strong for him to be able to catch breath". Berdella would later state that he did briefly attempt to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation upon Howell after he had died before dragging his body to the basement. He then suspended Howell's body above a large cooking pot and made several incisions to the youth's inner elbows and jugular vein, before leaving the body suspended in this position overnight to allow the blood to drain from his corpse. The following day, he dismembered Howell's body using a chainsaw and boning knives, before wrapping the sections in newspaper and trash bags. These bags were later placed inside larger trash bags which Berdella placed <b>outside</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> garbage crew to collect and take to a landfill.|$|E

[...] Makoto tries to have sex with Shizuko again, despairing when he finds that his impotence has returned. [...] Despite this, he keeps training her, even taking her <b>outside</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> walk. [...] Taking a chance, he unties her so that she might use the restroom; after a long, worrying delay, Shizuko returns, to the delight of Makoto. [...] Later the two go to watch a pornographic film, which features a black man who resembles the soldier from Makoto's dreams. [...] Uncomfortable at first, Makoto starts to remember his childhood incident in detail, eventually remembering that it was his mother who shot the man, not him. [...] Overjoyed, Makoto calls his mother from a public phone booth to tell her he has remembered the truth, letting her listen as he has sex with Shizuko during the call.|$|E

2500|$|Pittsburgh's defense forced Green Bay to punt on {{the first}} drive of the second half, and got the ball at midfield after a {{facemask}} call on Tom Crabtree while tackling Antonio Brown on the punt return. The offense then scored in five plays (all runs). First, Rashard Mendenhall broke free along with right sideline for a 17-yard run, then Isaac Redman rushed for 3yards, and Roethlisberger ran for 6, bringing up third down and 1. On the next play, Redman tried to run up the middle, but was held up at the line, so he backed away {{and ran to the}} <b>outside</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> 16-yard gain to the 8-yard line. Then Mendenhall scored an 8-yard touchdown run on the next play, making the score 21–17. [...] After forcing a punt, Pittsburgh mounted a drive to the Packers 29-yard line, but Green Bay's defense made a stand. First Roethlisberger's pass was batted down behind the line by linebacker Clay Matthews, then Roethlisberger tried a screen pass to tight end Heath Miller, but Desmond Bishop tackled him for a 3-yard loss. Then on third down Frank Zombo sacked Roethlisberger on the 34, and Suisham's ensuing 52-yard field goal attempt sailed wide left.|$|E
2500|$|In December 2010 Alaskan {{state senator}} Scott Kawasaki {{proposed}} legislation creating the state's first law and medical schools, {{with the law}} school in Anchorage. Kawasaki cited high legal costs, his desire {{for the state to}} be a model for tribal and environmental law and not losing Alaskan law talent to the lower 48 states as reasons for the legislation. In reply, the University of Alaska System noted that [...] "adding graduate programs would require an analysis of student demand and the work force needed to staff" [...] a law school. On January 7, 2011 Kawasaki introduced Alaska House Bill (HB) 38, [...] "University Institutes Of Law And Medicine" [...] at the University of Alaska, to the 2011 legislative session. A day after the bill was introduced, it was opposed by legislators [...] "who question the cost and the need for Alaska to have the schools." [...] A commentator replied that due to the absence of an Alaskan law school, the Alaska Law Review had been published by the UCLA and Duke University Schools of Law. The Juneau Empire opposed an Alaska law school in a January 16 editorial, saying that [...] "the idea of creating Alaska's own JD factory should be quickly dismissed." [...] Asserting that Alaska has had little trouble attracting lawyers and the U.S. has too many attorneys (rather than Alaska having too few), the newspaper proposed: [...] "The seed money required to launch a law school could go to better use to endow scholarships for bright Alaskans to go <b>outside</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> fully funded legal education, in the same vein as the WWAMI program for Alaska's medical students. It could also be used to better fund district attorney's offices, Legal Aid, victims' compensation and public defenders programs."
