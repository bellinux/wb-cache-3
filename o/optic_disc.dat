5|$|The {{pressure}} {{around the}} brain may rise, causing papilledema (swelling of the <b>optic</b> <b>disc)</b> {{which may be}} experienced as visual obscurations. In severely raised intracranial pressure, the level of consciousness is decreased, the blood pressure rises, the heart rate falls and the patient assumes an abnormal posture.|$|E
5|$|The eye {{problems}} associated with the King Charles Spaniel include cataracts, corneal dystrophy, distichia, entropion, microphthalmia, <b>optic</b> <b>disc</b> drusen, and keratitis. Compared to other breeds, the King Charles Spaniel has an increased risk of distichia (where extra eyelashes or hairs cause irritation to the eye). Inheritance is suspected in the other conditions, with ages of onset ranging from six months for cataracts to two to five years for corneal dystrophy.|$|E
5|$|Idiopathic {{intracranial}} hypertension {{is a condition}} of unknown cause characterised by a rise in CSF pressure. It is associated with headaches, double vision, difficulties seeing, and a swollen <b>optic</b> <b>disc.</b> It can occur {{in association with the}} use of Vitamin A and tetracycline antibiotics, or without any identifiable cause at all, particularly in younger obese women. Management may include ceasing any known causes, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor such as acetazolamide, repeated drainage via lumbar puncture, or the insertion of a shunt such as a ventriculoperitoneal shunt.|$|E
50|$|In {{patients}} with headaches, {{the finding of}} swollen <b>optic</b> <b>discs,</b> or papilledema, on ophthalmoscopy is a key sign, as this indicates raised intracranial pressure (ICP) which {{could be due to}} hydrocephalus, benign intracranial hypertension (aka pseudotumor cerebri) or brain tumor, amongst other conditions. Cupped <b>optic</b> <b>discs</b> are seen in glaucoma.|$|R
50|$|In a small {{population}} {{of people with}} larger, symptomatic cysts, the following comorbid conditions have been noted: Pseudotumor cerebri (elevated intracranial pressure), empy sella, hormonal disturbances, flattened <b>optic</b> <b>discs,</b> chiari malformation, sjogren's, POTS, dysautonomia, PCOS.|$|R
40|$|A {{modified}} snake method {{based on}} the novel idea of coordinate regeneration is presented and is tested on an object with complex concavities and on retinal images for locating the boundaries of <b>optic</b> <b>discs,</b> where the conventional snake methods fail. We have demonstrated that the use of conventional snake method with our proposed coordinate regeneration technique gives ultimate solution for finding the boundaries of complex objects. The proposed method requires a Gaussian blur of the object with a large kernel so that the snake can be initialised away from the object boundaries. In the second and third steps the blurring kernel size is reduced so that exact boundaries can be located. Coordinate regeneration is applied at each step which ultimately converges the snake (active contour) to exact boundaries. For complex objects like <b>optic</b> <b>discs</b> in retinal images, vessels act as snake distracters and some preimage processing is required before the proposed technique is applied. We are demonstrating this technique to find the boundary of <b>optic</b> <b>discs</b> in retinal images. In principle, this technique can be extended to find the boundary of any object in other modalities of medical imaging. Simulation results are presented to support the idea...|$|R
25|$|Papilledema, or the {{swelling}} of the <b>optic</b> <b>disc,</b> can be a reliable sign that ICP is elevated. Unlike other conditions that may result in {{the swelling}} of the <b>optic</b> <b>disc,</b> {{it is in the}} case of papilledema that vision may go largely unaffected.|$|E

25|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} of acute optic neuropathy include painless loss of vision which may affect either one or both eyes, reduced visual acuity, reduced color vision, relative afferent pupillary defect, central scotoma, swollen <b>optic</b> <b>disc,</b> macular edema, or retrobulbar pain. When these symptoms occur with concurrent mucocutaneous ulcerations, they raise suspicion of acute optic neuropathy in Behçet's Disease. Progressive optic atrophy may result in decreased visual acuity or color vision. Intracranial hypertension with papilledema may be present.|$|E
25|$|Region growing {{approach}} is a method of detecting neighboring pixels with similarities. A seed point is required for such method to start. Two elements are needed for this technique to work: similarity and spatial proximity. A neighboring pixel to the seed pixel with similar intensity {{is likely to be}} the same type and will be added to the growing region. One disadvantage of this technique is that it requires manual selection of seed point, which introduces bias and inconsistency in the algorithm. This technique is also being used in <b>optic</b> <b>disc</b> identification.|$|E
40|$|AIMS—To define {{an unusual}} macular {{appearance}} found {{in association with}} nanophthalmos.  METHODS—A case review.  RESULTS—Seven children (aged 8  months to 17  years) with nanophthalmos were examined. They all exhibited the same clinical findings of an unusual yellow macula appearance with retinal folds and crowded <b>optic</b> <b>discs.</b> Visual electrophysiology performed in four cases was normal.  CONCLUSION—A distinctive yellow macular pigmentation with associated chorioretinal folds and crowded <b>optic</b> <b>discs</b> is present in nanophthalmos. It is proposed that the retinal folds are due to a disparity between scleral and retinal growth while the macula discoloration {{is due to a}} congenital abnormality in arrangement or position of the luteal pigment and is not degenerative. Included in this case series is the second case in the literature of nanophthalmos associated with Kenny's syndrome. Inheritance of nanophthalmos appears to be autosomal recessive.    Keywords: nanophthalmos; maculopathy; Kenny's syndrom...|$|R

50|$|DOA is an {{autosomal}} dominant disease {{caused by a}} defect in the nuclear gene OPA1. A slowly progressive optic neuropathy, usually presents {{in the first decade}} of life and is bilaterally symmetrical.

25|$|Towards {{the centre}} of the retina is the fovea (or the less specialised, area centralis) which has a greater density of receptors and is the area of {{greatest}} forward visual acuity, i.e. sharpest, clearest detection of objects. In 54% of birds, including birds of prey, kingfishers, hummingbirds and swallows, there is second fovea for enhanced sideways viewing. The optic nerve is a bundle of nerve fibres which carry messages from the eye to the relevant parts of the brain and vice versa. Like mammals, birds have a small blind spot without photoreceptors at the <b>optic</b> <b>disc,</b> under which the optic nerve and blood vessels join the eye.|$|E
25|$|Green channel {{filtering}} {{is another}} technique that {{is useful in}} differentiating lesions rather than vessels. This method {{is important because it}} provides the maximal contrast between diabetic retinopathy-related lesions. Microaneurysms and hemorrhages are red lesions that appear dark after application of green channel filtering. In contrast, exudates, which appear yellow in normal image, are transformed into bright white spots after green filtering. This technique is mostly used according to the 2014 review, with appearance in 27 out of 40 published articles in the past three years. In addition, green channel filtering can be used to detect center of <b>optic</b> <b>disc</b> in conjunction with double-windowing system.|$|E
25|$|In an {{epidemiologic}} study, 56 {{percent of}} patients with Behçet's disease developed ocular involvement at {{a mean age of}} 30. Ocular involvement was the first manifestation of Behçet's disease in 8.6 {{percent of patients}}. Ocular Behçet's disease with involvement of the optic nerve is rarely reported. Among patients with ocular Behçet's disease funduscopic findings of optic atrophy, and <b>optic</b> <b>disc</b> paleness have been identified with a frequency of 17.9 percent and 7.4 percent, respectively. Other fundoscopic findings include vascular sheathing (23.7%), retinal hemorrhage (9%), macular edema (11.3%), branch retinal vein occlusion (5.8%), and retinal edema (6.6%). However, optic atrophy was the most significant cause of visual impairment identified in 54 percent of patients with ocular Behçet's disease and permanent visual impairment.|$|E

50|$|Dominant {{optic atrophy}} is an {{autosomal}} dominant disease {{caused by a}} defect in the nuclear gene OPA1. A slowly progressive optic neuropathy, dominant optic atrophy, usually presents {{in the first decade}} of life and is bilaterally symmetrical.

40|$|One hundred {{patients}} with symmetrical proliferative diabetic retinopathy had one eye randomly chosen for treatment with xenonarc photocoagulation {{while the other}} was left untreated as a control. Patients were subdivided into those with new vessels on both <b>optic</b> <b>discs</b> and those with only peripheral new vessels. In {{patients with}} new vessels on the <b>optic</b> <b>discs</b> {{the vision of the}} untreated eyes deteriorated more than that of the treated eyes and the difference in deterioration was significant after one, two, and three years. There was no such difference in patients who had only peripheral new vessels. Eighteen patients had become blind in one or both eyes by the last assessment, but only one patient became blind in the treated eye without concomitant blindness in the untreated eye. Thirteen were blind only in the untreated eye. Both photographic and ophthalmoscopic examinations showed that new vessels on the disc regressed more in the treated eyes than in the untreated ones.

25|$|Abnormalities of the {{cranial nerves}} are present 50-70% of cases. The most common {{abnormality}} is {{involvement of the}} facial nerve, which may lead to reduced power on one or {{both sides of the}} face (65% resp 35% of all cranial nerve cases), followed by reduction in visual perception due to optic nerve involvement. Rarer symptoms are double vision (oculomotor nerve, trochlear nerve or abducens nerve), decreased sensation of the face (trigeminal nerve), hearing loss or vertigo (vestibulocochlear nerve), swallowing problems (glossopharyngeal nerve) and weakness of the shoulder muscles (accessory nerve) or the tongue (hypoglossal nerve). Visual problems may also be the result of papilledema (swelling of the <b>optic</b> <b>disc)</b> due to obstruction by granulomas of the normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulation.|$|E
25|$|Visual acuity, {{or color}} vision loss with {{concurrent}} mucocutaneous lesions or systemic Behçet's disease symptoms should raise suspicion of optic nerve involvement in Behçet's disease and prompt a work-up for Behçet's disease if not previously diagnosed {{in addition to}} an ocular work-up. Diagnosis of Behçet's disease is based on clinical findings including oral and genital ulcers, skin lesions such as erythema nodosum, acne, or folliculitis, ocular inflammatory findings and a pathergy reaction. Inflammatory markers such ESR, and CRP may be elevated. A complete ophthalmic examination may include a slit lamp examination, optical coherence tomography to detect nerve loss, visual field examinations, fundoscopic examination to assess <b>optic</b> <b>disc</b> atrophy and retinal disease, fundoscopic angiography, and visual evoked potentials, which may demonstrate increased latency. Optic nerve enhancement may be identified on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in some patients with acute optic neuropathy. However, a normal study does not rule out optic neuropathy. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis may demonstrate elevated protein level with or without pleocytosis. Imaging including angiography may be indicated to identify dural venous sinus thrombosis as a cause of intracranial hypertension and optic atrophy.|$|E
500|$|The {{increased}} pressure leads to papilledema, which is {{swelling of the}} <b>optic</b> <b>disc,</b> {{the spot where the}} optic nerve enters the eyeball. This occurs in practically all cases of IIH, but not everyone experiences symptoms from this. Those who do experience symptoms typically report [...] "transient visual obscurations", episodes of difficulty seeing that occur in both eyes but not necessarily at the same time. Long-term untreated papilledema leads to visual loss, initially in the periphery but progressively towards the center of vision.|$|E

2500|$|The {{most common}} sign of CEA is the {{presence}} of an area of undeveloped choroid (appearing as a pale spot) lateral to the <b>optic</b> <b>disc.</b> [...] The choroid is a collection of blood vessels supplying the retina. [...] CEA can also cause retinal or scleral coloboma, coloboma of the <b>optic</b> <b>disc,</b> retinal detachment, or intraocular hemorrhage. [...] It can be diagnosed by fundoscopy by the age of six or seven weeks. [...] Severe cases may be blind.|$|E
2500|$|Optic neuropathy, nonarteritic {{anterior}} ischemic {{optic neuropathy}} (N-AION), occurs in 1-2% {{of people and}} is not dosage dependent. Bilateral <b>optic</b> <b>disc</b> swelling and mild and reversible visual field defects can also occur.|$|E
2500|$|CEA {{is caused}} by {{improper}} development of the eye. [...] Failure of {{the cells of the}} posterior portion of the optic vesicles to express growth hormone affects the differentiation of other cells of the eye. [...] The choroid, especially lateral to the <b>optic</b> <b>disc,</b> is hypoplastic (underdeveloped). [...] A coloboma, or hole, may form in or near the <b>optic</b> <b>disc</b> due to a failed closure of embryonic tissue. [...] The degree of these abnormalities varies between individual dogs, and even between the same dog's eyes. [...] CEA is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait that has a penetrance reaching 100 percent, and has been localized to canine chromosome 37.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. New {{information}} technologies provide {{a possibility of}} collecting {{a large amount of}} fun-dus images into databases. It allows us to use automated processing and classification of images for clinical decisions. Automated localization and parameterization of the <b>optic</b> nerve <b>disc</b> is par-ticularly important in making a diagnosis of glaucoma, because the main symptoms in these cases are relations between the optic nerve and cupping parameters.

40|$|AIMS: To {{evaluate}} {{the evolution of}} ocular and electroretinographic findings in identical twin sisters with the carbohydrate deficient glycoprotein (CDG) syndrome {{over a period of}} 14 years. METHODS: Both girls underwent a clinical ophthalmic examination with funduscopy and an electrophysiological assessment with recording of flash electroretinogram (FERG) at the age of 4 years and 18 years RESULTS: On ophthalmic examination at the age of 4 years an alternating convergent squint and a saccadic pursuit was diagnosed. In both, vision was 6 / 9 bilaterally. Fundus examination showed normal <b>optic</b> <b>discs,</b> narrow blood vessels, and a mild irregular pigmentation in the periphery. In one girl the FERG showed a recognisable a, b 1, and b 2 -wave with reduced amplitude to less than 40 % of the normal. In the other girl the reduction in amplitude was still more obvious, but for the white flash a small b 1 -wave was still present. At the age of 18 vision had remained 6 / 9 in both eyes. Funduscopy showed pink <b>optic</b> <b>discs,</b> moderately narrowed blood vessels, and bony spicule pigmentary deposits in the mid periphery.
