5|$|The Me 262, {{while not}} a war winner, might have {{extended}} the Defence of the Reich campaign. The problems with the engines, failures of production priorities and Hitler's meddling are well known, but the long delay between <b>operational</b> <b>testing,</b> tactical and doctrinal development and training were largely Galland's fault.|$|E
5|$|Although {{existing}} sources do not record {{when the}} Mk. XIV went into {{production in the}} UK, they do record that <b>operational</b> <b>testing</b> started in January 1942 and production examples started reaching squadrons in March. It was manufactured by small machine shops and instrument makers, such as the Aron Meter Company. Production was too slow to meet the demand; between July and October, fewer than a hundred a month were being delivered. As the design was finalized, automated production was undertaken and by mid-1943, 900 a month were available. This was enough to equip the heavy bombers as they arrived from the production lines and by late 1942 the Handley Page Halifax was being delivered with the sight head already installed.|$|E
5|$|By {{this point}} the Air Ministry was desperate to get any unit into service. Satisfied with his visit in May, Dowding {{suggested}} that the Mk. I {{was good enough for}} <b>operational</b> <b>testing</b> purposes. On 11 June 1939, AI was given the highest priority and provisions were made to supply 11 additional Blenheims to No 25 squadron at RAF Hawkinge (for a total of 21). Since each of the parts came from different suppliers, and the fitters were unfamiliar with any of it, members of the AI team would have to hand-assemble the components as they arrived and instruct the fitters on the sets.|$|E

5|$|During 2002, the Comanche program {{underwent}} heavy restructuring; consequently, {{the number}} of Comanches that were intended to be purchased was dropped down to 650 rotorcraft. At the time, the projected total cost for the full production of the Comanche in such numbers stood at $26.9 billion. Originally, he EMD phase had been planned to last for six years, as well as having involved {{a total of five}} Comanches being constructed to participate in the testing regime. During 2003, production on the third RAH-66, which was intended to be the first EMD-conformant helicopter, was started. Subsequently, eight RAH-66s were to be constructed for <b>operational</b> <b>testing</b> purposes. As planned, the initial production RAH-66s were to be completed to a Block I configuration, which would have included the majority of the rotorcraft's planned weapons and sensors. From the 16th Comanche onwards, deliveries would have been made to the Block II standard, which was to have all of the planned capabilities included.|$|E
5|$|There is also {{an annual}} Fighter Weapons Instructor Course (FWIC) run by No.410 Squadron, and a Fighter Electronic Warfare and Advanced Radar (FEWAR) Course. The intense and highly {{challenging}} FWIC lasts for three months. Each operational CF-18 squadron and tactical radar squadron sends candidates (eight students per course) who graduate with the leadership qualities and expertise required {{to return to their}} squadrons and design tactical training programs themselves. The Advanced Radar Course is conducted in two phases: ground school at 4 Wing, Cold Lake, and a flying phase at an electronic warfare range. This three-week course is designed to allow ten pilots annually to graduate and return to their squadrons as electronic warfare experts and instructors. Since No.410 Squadron has always had some of the most experienced CF-18 pilots in the fighter community, it is often charged with carrying out special fighter projects. The squadron conducted the <b>operational</b> <b>testing</b> and evaluation of the CF's precision guided munitions, and in 2010 was anticipating testing the use of night vision devices in the Hornet.|$|E
5|$|When {{the time}} came for {{developmental}} and <b>operational</b> <b>testing</b> of the SAW candidates, three 5.56mm candidate weapons were included with the 6mm candidates: the M16 HBAR, a heavy-barrel variant of the M16 designed for prolonged firing; the Fabrique Nationale de Herstal (FN) Minimi; and the HK 23A1. The initial round of tests ended in December 1974. In February 1976, the Minimi and Rodman XM235 SAW were selected for further development. At this time, opinions of the 6mm cartridge were beginning to sour due to the logistical implications of providing yet another ammunition type to the infantry. In June, it was requested that the SAW specifications document be revised to emphasize standard 5.56mm ammunition. In October, the requested revisions were approved, and bids were solicited for {{the conversion of the}} Rodman XM235 to 5.56mm. Production of the converted XM235 was awarded to Ford Aerospace, and its designation was changed to XM248. A new M16 HBAR variant, the XM106, was developed in 1978, and soon after, Heckler & Koch lobbied to include a 5.56mm conversion of its HK 21A1 (instead of the standard 7.62mm NATO ammunition it was built for) in future SAW testing. The latter model was designated the XM262. At this time, the Minimi received the designation XM249. Testing of the four candidates resumed in April 1979.|$|E

25|$|The April 2016 Report {{from the}} U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) {{described}} Boeing’s test {{schedule for the}} KC-46 program as “optimistic” and projects Boeing will need an additional four months beyond the August 2017 target to deliver 18 full-up tankers due to testing and parts qualification issues. The report notes that <b>operational</b> <b>testing</b> will not now begin until May 2017 {{and will not be}} completed until two months after the first tranche of 18 aircraft are delivered, risking late discoveries of problems. The GAO also noted that Boeing has not obtained Federal Aviation Administration's approval for two key aerial refueling systems - the centerline drogue system and the wing aerial refueling pods, which were built without following FAA processes. Boeing now projects these components will be ready for the FAA to certify by July 2017 — over three years late. The 18 aircraft were meant to include the four developmental aircraft, brought up to an operational standard, plus the first 14 low-rate production (LRP) examples. Instead, 16 of the 18 will be production line examples; because the aircraft will be delivered before <b>operational</b> <b>testing</b> is complete, Boeing will be responsible for any late design fixes.|$|E
