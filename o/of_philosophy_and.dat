5|$|The I Ching, or Yijing, was {{originally}} a divination system that had its origins around 1150 BCE Although it predates the first mentions of Tao as an organised system <b>of</b> <b>philosophy</b> <b>and</b> religious practice, this text later became of philosophical importance to Daoism and Confucianism.|$|E
5|$|Instrumentalism {{became popular}} among {{physicists}} {{around the turn}} of the 20th century, after which logical positivism defined the field for several decades. Logical positivism accepts only testable statements as meaningful, rejects metaphysical interpretations, and embraces verificationism (a set of theories of knowledge that combines logicism, empiricism, and linguistics to ground philosophy on a basis consistent with examples from the empirical sciences). Seeking to overhaul all <b>of</b> <b>philosophy</b> <b>and</b> convert it to a new scientific philosophy, the Berlin Circle and the Vienna Circle propounded logical positivism in the late 1920s.|$|E

5|$|Ramanuja's Vishishtadvaita {{interpretation}} of the Upanishad is a qualified monism. Ramanuja interprets the Upanishadic literature to be teaching a body-soul theory, states Jeaneane Fowler – a professor <b>of</b> <b>Philosophy</b> <b>and</b> Religious Studies, where the Brahman is the dweller in all things, yet also distinct and beyond all things, as the soul, the inner controller, the immortal. The Upanishads, according to the Vishishtadvaita school, teach individual souls {{to be of the}} same quality as the Brahman, but quantitatively they are distinct.|$|E
5|$|After Marcin Kromer died {{in early}} March 1589, Andrew became the Prince-Bishop of Warmia {{and a member}} of the Senate of Poland. He {{supported}} the introduction of the teaching <b>of</b> <b>philosophy</b> <b>and</b> theology in the Collegium Hosianum in Braniewo, because he wanted to develop it into a university. At the request of Sigismund III Vasa, Pope Sixtus made Andrew coadjutor bishop of Piotr Myszkowski, the elderly bishop of Kraków. However, the Habsburgs wanted to prevent Andrew from seizing the bishopric which was situated near Royal Hungary. The new papal nuncio, Annibale di Capua (who was their supporter) convinced the king to nominate Jerzy Radziwiłł to the see after Myszkowski died on 5 April 1591. Capua emphasized that Andrew had not been an ordained priest. Most Polish noblemen regarded the Lithuanian Radziwiłł's appointment to a Polish see unlawful, but Pope Gregory XIV confirmed the king's decision.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} time in the history of UST, the Faculty of Pharmacy opened its doors to women in the {{academic}} year 1924–1925. It was one of the first universities in the Philippines to become co-educational when it admitted women. There were 24 women enrollees out of the 93 who matriculated for the said Faculty that school year. The University, however, had been granting certificates through the School of Midwifery since 1879. Permission was given to the College of Education in 1926, to Faculty <b>of</b> <b>Philosophy</b> <b>and</b> Letters in 1927 followed by the Faculty of Medicine and Surgery and College of Commerce in 1932. The admission of women no longer became an issue in later years. Only the Faculties of Sacred Theology, Canon Law, and Philosophy remained exclusively for men.|$|E

Besides his interest in philosophy, Fodor passionately follows opera and regularly writes popular columns for the London Review of Books on that and other topics.|$|E
5|$|Mehldau has {{expressed}} an interest in, and knowledge <b>of,</b> <b>philosophy</b> <b>and</b> literature. In a 2003 interview he commented on romanticism and nostalgia, linking pleasure and pain to musical expression: I love {{the part of the}} Orpheus myth where he is allowed to take his wife out of Hades on the condition that he doesn't look back at her for the trip on the river Styx. When he can't help himself, he looks back, and she is pulled back downstream away from him, taken away forever. Music is that moment right when he looks at her: seeing something that you love for an instant being taken away forever. There's an element of folly to the whole thing – you look even though you know you shouldn't. Music kind of yokes together the feeling of attainment and the feeling of loss at the same time.|$|E

ArchelausI received many more Greek scholars, artists, and celebrities at his court than his predecessors. His honored guests included the painter Zeuxis, the architect Callimachus, the poets Choerilus of Samos, Timotheus of Miletus, and Agathon, {{as well as the}} famous Athenian playwright Euripides. The philosopher Aristotle, who studied at the Platonic Academy of Athens and established the Aristotelian school of thought, moved to Macedonia, and is said to have tutored the young Alexander the Great, as well as serving as an esteemed diplomat for PhilipII. Among Alexander's retinue of artists, writers, and philosophers was Pyrrho of Elis, founder of Pyrrhonism, the school of philosophical skepticism. During the Antigonid period, Antigonos Gonatas fostered cordial relationships with Menedemos of Eretria, founder of the Eretrian school <b>of</b> <b>philosophy,</b> <b>and</b> Zenon, the founder of Stoicism.|$|E
