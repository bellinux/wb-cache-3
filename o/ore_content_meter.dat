5000|$|The system {{consists}} of all vital components for monitoring and controlling the {{discharge from the}} vessel's oily water separator. The white box includes a stainless steel cage with a locked door. The bilge water from the oily water separator is pumped through the white box and analyzed by an oil <b>content</b> <b>meter.</b> A flow switch secures that there is flow through the oil <b>content</b> <b>meter</b> and a flow meter counts the accumulated discharged overboard volume. If the door is opened, the oil content exceeds the legal limit of 15 parts per million (PPM) or the flow to the oil <b>content</b> <b>meter</b> is lost the three way valve will immediately redirect the bilge water back to the bilge water holding tank. All components inside the system are connected to a digital recorder mounted in the engine control room that records the oil content, three way valve position, flow through oil <b>content</b> <b>meter,</b> accumulated discharged volume, door position together with the vessels geographical position and time. The chief engineer possesses the key and when locked, the system [...] cannot be tampered with and equally importantly provides {{the evidence that the}} vessel has been compliant. The recorder data is stored in an encrypted format and can be presented to any official body such as Port State Control, United States Coast Guard, Vetting or Classification society officials to prove that the vessel has been compliant to MARPOL 73/78 (the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution From Ships) or any national regulation, and that no illegal discharge has been made.|$|R

50|$|The process {{initially}} {{involves the}} drilling of holes into the ore deposit. Explosive or hydraulic fracturing {{may be used}} to create open pathways in the deposit for solution to penetrate. Leaching solution is pumped into the deposit where it makes contact with the ore. The solution bearing the dissolved <b>ore</b> <b>content</b> is then pumped to the surface and processed. This process allows the extraction of metals and salts from an ore body without the need for conventional mining involving drill-and-blast, open-cut or underground mining.|$|R

50|$|Chlorophyll <b>content</b> <b>meters</b> are {{commonly}} used for nutrient plant stress measurement, that includes nitrogen stress, and sulfur stress. Because research has shown, that if used correctly, chlorophyll <b>content</b> <b>meters</b> are reliable for nitrogen management work, these meters are often the instruments of choice for crop fertilizer management because they are relatively inexpensive. Research has demonstrated that by comparing well fertilized plants to test plants, {{the ratio of the}} chlorophyll content index of test plants, divided by the chlorophyll content index of well fertilized plants, will provide a ratio that is an indication of when fertilization should occur, and how much should be used. It is common to use a well fertilized stand of crops in a specific field and sometimes in different areas of the same field, as the fertilization reference, due to differences from field to field and within a field. The research done to date uses either ten and thirty measurements on test and well fertilized crops, to provide average values. Studies have been done for corn and wheat. One paper suggests that when the ratio drops below 95%, it is time to fertigate. The amounts of fertilizer are also recommended.|$|R

50|$|An OWS {{needs to}} be fitted with an oil <b>content</b> <b>meter</b> (OCM) that samples the OWS {{overboard}} discharge water for oil content. If the oil content is less than 15 ppm, the OCM allows the water to be discharged overboard. If the oil content is higher than 15 ppm, the OCM will activate an alarm and move a three-way valve that, within {{a short period of}} time, will recirculate the overboard discharge water to a tank on the OWS suction side.|$|R
50|$|An OCM is a {{small part}} of what is called the oil {{discharge}} monitoring and control system. The first part is the oil <b>content</b> <b>meter.</b> The second is a flow meter which measures the flow rate of the water at the discharge pipe. Third, is a computing unit which calculates how much oil has actually been discharged along with the day and time of the discharge. And lastly is the overboard valve control system which is essentially just a valve that can stop the discharge from flowing out at the appropriate time.|$|R

25|$|By 1952 the Bolivian {{economy had}} {{deteriorated}} even further. The {{governments of the}} sexenio had been reluctant to increase taxes for the upper class and to reduce social spending, resulting in high inflation. The tin industry had stagnated since the Great Depression, despite short revivals during World War II. <b>Ore</b> <b>content</b> had declined, and the richer veins were depleted, increasing tin production costs; at the same time, tin prices on the international market fell. A disagreement with the United States over tin prices halted exports temporarily and caused a decline in income that further hurt the economy. The agricultural sector lacked capital, and food imports had increased, reaching 19% of total imports in 1950. Land was unequally distributed - 92% of the cultivable land was held by estates of 1,000 hectares or more.|$|R
40|$|It {{will not}} be long until the peak oil problem will spread onto a number of metals. Profitable sources of many {{inorganic}} raw materials have already been exhausted. In primary raw materials, the <b>ore</b> <b>content</b> of metals is beginning to be very low, so that the exploitation is increasingly time- and energy consuming. By way of application examples, it will be demonstrated that many raw materials have a tremendous influence on our day-to-day life even though their actual content in a final product {{may appear to be}} negligible. The recovery of precious raw materials and their recycling back into the substance cycle will remain one of the main head topics on society's agenda for decades to come. Development of novel recovery processes is in full swing as will be shown by the examples chosen for this article...|$|R
50|$|The OCM {{continuously}} monitors {{how much}} oil {{is in the}} water that is pumped out the discharge line of the OWS system. The OCM will not allow the oil concentration of the exiting water to be above the Marpol standard of 15 ppm. This standard was first adopted in 1977 with Resolution A.393(X) which was published by IMO. These standards were updated various but the most current resolution is MEPC 107(49). The oil <b>content</b> <b>meter</b> will sound an alarm if the liquid leaving the system has an unsatisfactory amount {{of oil in the}} mixture. If it is still above that standard, then the bilge water will be reentered into the system until it meets the required criteria. The OCM uses light beams to determine how oily the water in the system is. The system will then gauge the oil concentration based on a light intensity <b>meter.</b> Modern oil <b>content</b> <b>meters</b> also have a data logging system that can store oil concentration measurements for more than 18 months.If the OCM determines that there is far too much of a type of oil, the OCM may be fouled and needs to be flushed out. Running clean water through the OCM sensor cell is one way it can be cleaned. Also scrubbing the sensor area with a bottle brush is another effective method. The new MEPC 107(49) regulations have set out stringent actions that require the OCM to be tamper proof and also the OCM needs to have an alarm that sounds whenever the OCM is being cleaned. When the alarm goes off, the OCM functionality will be checked by crew members.|$|R
50|$|Crop {{consultants}} {{also use}} these tools for fertilizer recommendations. However, because strict scientific protocols are more time consuming and more expensive, consultants sometimes use well-fertilized plants located in low-lying areas {{as the standard}} well-fertilized plants. They typically also use fewer measurements. The evidence for this approach involves anecdotal discussions with crop consultants.Chlorophyll <b>content</b> <b>meters</b> are sensitive to both nitrogen and sulfur stress at usable levels. Chlorophyll fluorometers require a special assay, involving a high actinic light level in combination with nitrogen stress, to measure nitrogen stress at usable levels. In addition, chlorophyll fluorometers will only detect sulfur stress at starvation levels. For best results, chlorophyll content measurements should be made when water deficits are not present. Photosynthesis systems will detect both nitrogen and sulfur stress.|$|R

For these samples {{it is necessary to}} measure chlorophyll content using chlorophyll fluorescence.In his scientific paper Gitelson (1999) states, [...] "The ratio between chlorophyll fluorescence, at 735 nm and the wavelength range 700nm to 710 nm, F735/F700 was found to be linearly proportional to the chlorophyll content (with determination coefficient, r2, more than 0.95) and thus this ratio {{can be used as a}} precise indicator of chlorophyll content in plant leaves."

40|$|ABSTRACT] We {{present a}} method for {{retrieving}} aerosol optical thickness over the Okhotsk area based on ground data of a vegetation index for farmland monitoring. In the first step, we developed a camera for observation of the vegetation index. A NDVI value from the camera around the wheat canopy showed a good relation with SPAD, the chlorophyll <b>content</b> <b>meter,</b> in the same farmland. The NDVI value from ground data in west Abashiri farmland was 0. 355 (June 12, 2003). In the second step, we compare the ground data of NDVI and NDVI obtained from atmospherically corrected TERRA/MODIS imagery using 6 S, the radiative transfer code (Channel 1 and channel 2, on June 12, 2003). Then the aerosol optical thickness value is 0. 12 with the continental aerosol model and 0. 07 with the maritime model. The methods appear to be useful to validate satellite remote sensing for non-regular atmospheric observation...|$|R
