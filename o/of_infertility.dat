5|$|Female {{birds have}} sperm storage {{mechanisms}} that allow sperm from males to remain viable long after copulation, a hundred days in some species. Sperm from multiple males may compete through this mechanism. For females, possible benefits of extra-pair copulation include getting better genes for her offspring and insuring against the possibility <b>of</b> <b>infertility</b> in her mate. Males {{of species that}} engage in extra-pair copulations will closely guard their mates to ensure the parentage of the offspring that they raise.|$|E
5|$|Female orangutans {{experience}} {{their first}} ovulatory cycle around 5.8–11.1years. These occur earlier in females with more body fat. Like other great apes, female orangutans enter a period <b>of</b> <b>infertility</b> during adolescence which may last for 1–4years. Female orangutans {{also have a}} 22– to 30-day menstrual cycle. Gestation lasts for 9 months, with females giving birth to their first offspring {{between the ages of}} 14 and 15years.|$|E
25|$|However, {{salpingitis}} {{can also}} lead to infertility because the eggs released in ovulation can't get contact with the sperm. Approximately 75,000-225,000 cases <b>of</b> <b>infertility</b> in the US are caused by salpingitis. The more times one has the infection, the greater the risk <b>of</b> <b>infertility.</b> With one episode of salpingitis, the risk <b>of</b> <b>infertility</b> is 8-17%. With 3 episodes of salpingitis, the risk is 40-60%, although the exact risk depends on the severity of each episode.|$|E

25|$|The {{consequences}} <b>of</b> <b>infertility</b> are manifold and {{can include}} societal repercussions and personal suffering. Advances in assisted reproductive technologies, such as IVF, can offer hope to many couples where treatment is available, although barriers exist {{in terms of}} medical coverage and affordability. The medicalization <b>of</b> <b>infertility</b> has unwittingly led to a disregard for the emotional responses that couples experience, which include distress, loss of control, stigmatization, and a disruption in the developmental trajectory of adulthood.|$|E

40|$|Infertility affects {{approximately}} 15 % of couples, {{and male}} factor {{is responsible for}} 30 %- 50 % <b>of</b> all <b>infertility.</b> The most severe form <b>of</b> male <b>infertility</b> is testicular failure, and the typical phenotype of testicular failure is severely impaired spermatogenesis resulting in azoospermia or severe oligozoospermia. Although the etiology of testicular failure remains poorly understood, genetic factor typically is an underlying cause. Modern assisted reproductive techniques have revolutionized the treatment <b>of</b> male factor <b>infertility,</b> allowing biological fatherhood to be achieved by many men who {{would otherwise have been}} unable to become father to their children through natural conception. Therefore, identifying genetic abnormalities in male is critical because of the potential risk of transmission of genetic abnormalities to the offspring. Recently, along with other intense researches ongoing, whole-genome approaches have been used increasingly in the genetic studies <b>of</b> male <b>infertility.</b> In this review, we focus on the genetics of testicular failure and provide an update on the advances in the study of genetics <b>of</b> male <b>infertility...</b>|$|R

25|$|The main {{potential}} {{factors that}} influence pregnancy (and live birth) rates in IVF have been suggested to be maternal age, duration <b>of</b> <b>infertility</b> or subfertility, bFSH and number of oocytes, all reflecting ovarian function.

25|$|Human {{multiple}} births can occur either naturally (the woman ovulates multiple eggs or the fertilized egg splits into two) {{or as the}} result <b>of</b> <b>infertility</b> treatments such as IVF (several embryos are often transferred to compensate for lower quality) or fertility drugs (which can cause multiple eggs to mature in one ovulatory cycle).|$|E

25|$|In Jordan, not {{everyone}} has insurance coverage for fertility investigation and treatment. Army forces cover the army members for all infertility investigations and treatments.

25|$|This {{scientific}} breakthrough established standards {{and became an}} agent of change for women suffering from the afflictions <b>of</b> <b>infertility</b> and for women {{who did not want}} to pass on genetic disorders to their children.

Although donor embryo transfer as practiced today has evolved from the original non-surgical method, it now accounts for approximately 5% of in vitro fertilization recorded births.|$|E

30|$|Adhesions are {{the leading}} cause <b>of</b> {{secondary}} <b>infertility</b> in women.

Furthermore, tubal-related problems account for up to 40 % <b>of</b> female <b>infertility</b> cases, with identifiable causes including post-infectious, endometriosis-related and post-surgical adhesion formation [44, 45].|$|R
40|$|While the {{appropriate}} method {{for the investigation}} <b>of</b> female <b>infertility</b> continues to be debated, {{the timing of the}} investigation has received less attention. The current approach is time-consuming, and paradoxically may lead to overtreatment as well as undertreatment. Recent findings on fecundity and the conception window in humans have important implications for the timing of the investigation <b>of</b> female <b>infertility.</b> The findings support the view that fertility-oriented intercourse may have a major impact in reducing the time to pregnancy. Procedures for the investigation <b>of</b> female <b>infertility</b> are becoming less invasive and more accurate, while the therapies for infertility are more effective. It is proposed that under appropriate circumstances female infertility should be investigated after 6 months of fertility-oriented intercourse.
