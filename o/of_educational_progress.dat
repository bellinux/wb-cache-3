The study sample consisted of all {{children in}} England born in academic years 1993 to 1994 through 1997 to 1998 who were in local authority care at any point during the academic years 2005 to 2006 through 2012 to 2013 and for whom results of national tests in literacy and numeracy were available at ages 7, 11, and 16 (N = 47 [*] 500). Group trajectory analysis <b>of</b> children's <b>educational</b> <b>progress</b> identified 5 trajectory groups: low achievement, late improvement, late decline, predominant, and high achievement. Being looked after earlier was associated with a higher probability of following a high achievement trajectory and a lower probability of following a late decline trajectory. For children first looked after between ages 7 and 16, having a longer total time looked after by age 16 was associated with a higher probability of following a high achievement trajectory. For children with poor outcomes at ages 7 and 11, being looked after by age 16 was associated with an increased chance <b>of</b> <b>educational</b> improvement by age 16. This study provides evidence that early entry into care can reduce the risk <b>of</b> poor <b>educational</b> outcomes.

40|$|The need {{to develop}} {{policies}} and procedures that {{do a better job}} <b>of</b> evaluating <b>educational</b> <b>progress,</b> and especially the extent to which students are learning to perform tasks that require high-level cognitive abilities, is widely recognized.

The contributors to this use <b>of</b> <b>Educational</b> Researcher address several aspects of the dual problem of assessing high-order cognitive functioning and doing so {{in such a way as}} to impact the educational system positively as a whole. Educational Researcher, Vol. 18, No. 9, pp. 3 - 7 E ducational tests are used to evaluate the effectiveness of teachers, curricula, and educa-tional systems or programs, to identify trends in educational achievement, to determine the relative standings of school districts, states, or nations with respect to <b>educational</b> <b>progress,</b> and to aid curriculum planning and policy definition. With respect to individuals, test results are used to inform decisions regarding admittance to schools or educational programs and promotion within or graduation from programs, to identify needs for remedial education or opportunities for advanced or ac-celerated work, and to establish qualifications of teachers for licensure or certification. Sometimes testing is used to guide instruction—as in the case of performance-contingent sequencing of material in computer-based instruc-tion, or the continuous evaluation and adaptation by a human tutor—and, oc-casionally, to instruct. In short, testing serves many purposes in education and is conducted in a variety of context...|$|R

40|$|The rapid {{advances}} in {{information and communication}} technologies, coupled with increased access to information {{and the formation of}} global communities, have resulted in interest among researchers and academics to revise educational practice to move beyond traditional ‘literacy’ skills towards an enhanced set of “multiliteracies” or “new media literacies”. Measuring the literacy of a population, in the light of its linkage to individual and community wealth and wellbeing, is essential to determining the impact of compulsory education. The opportunity now is to develop tools to assess individual and societal attainment of these new literacies. Drawing on the work of Jenkins and colleagues (2006) and notions of a participatory culture, this paper proposes a conceptual framework for how learning analytics can assist in measuring individual achievement of multiliteracies and how this evaluative process can be scaled to provide an institutional perspective <b>of</b> the <b>educational</b> <b>progress</b> in fostering these fundamental skills...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, Adams {{identifies}} {{factors which}} influence {{the effectiveness of}} education provided for Indigenous students, focussing on child poverty (including loss of cultural identity and self-value); the degree <b>of</b> <b>educational</b> disadvantage Indigenous students are likely to experience because of such poverty, {{as well as the}} covert discrimination and racism they have to contend with in the school setting, which frequently leads to their alienation from the schooling process. In discussing educational participation, achievement and absenteeism among Indigenous students, the author suggests that poor educational outcomes apparent in upper primary/lower secondary school are symptomatic <b>of</b> inadequate <b>educational</b> <b>progress</b> {{in the early years of}} schooling. In addressing improvements needed in the provision of education for Indigenous students, Adams points to the need to recognise the importance and equal status of each stage of schooling, the inter-relatedness of all stages and the responsibility incumbent in each stage to ensure a student's satisfactory progression during that stage and into the next. Such an orientation focuses attention on the crucial importance of early childhood education in establishing attitudes to self, as an individual, and as a learner and in developing future attitudes to schooling.
