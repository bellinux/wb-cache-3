5|$|The 1973–1974 {{oil embargo}} had lasting {{effects on the}} United States and other industrialized nations, which {{established}} the International Energy Agency in response, as well as national emergency stockpiles designed to withstand months of future supply disruptions. Oil conservation efforts included lower speed limits on highways, smaller and more energy-efficient cars and appliances, year-round daylight saving time, reduced usage of heating and air-conditioning, better insulation, increased support of mass transit, and greater emphasis on coal, natural gas, ethanol, nuclear and other alternative energy sources. These long-term efforts became effective enough that US <b>oil</b> <b>consumption</b> would rise only 11 percent during 1980–2014, while real GDP rose 150 percent.

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{investigate}} the inter-temporal causal relationship among Economic growth, <b>Oil</b> products <b>consumption,</b> Electricity consumption and Price (intermittent variable) during 1973 - 2006. We employ the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) -Bounds Testing approach by Pesaran et al (2001). The result of bounds test shows that there is long run co-integration among economic growth, Price, <b>Oil</b> products <b>consumption</b> and economic growth, Price, Electricity consumption. Also the result shows that there is unidirectional casual effect of <b>Oil</b> products <b>consumption</b> and Electricity consumption on economic growth {{and the impact of}} these two variables on economic growth in long run is negative. Hence, waste and deficient of <b>oil</b> product <b>consumption</b> and electricity consumption in long run are a deterrent for economic growth in Iran’s economy. Thus, energy saving policies should be selected by policymakers in Iran’s economy...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate in postmenopausal women the effect of daily consumption and/or application of argan oil on skin elasticity. Materials and methods: Sixty postmenopausal women consumed butter during the stabilization period and were randomly divided into two groups for the intervention period: the treatment group of 30 participants received dietary argan oil, the control group of 30 participants received olive oil, and both groups applied cosmetic argan oil in the left volar forearm during a 60 -day period. Assessments of skin elasticity parameters, ie, the three R-parameters (R 2 or gross-elasticity of the skin, R 5 or net elasticity of the skin, and R 7 or biological elasticity), and the resonance running time (RRT) at both volar forearms of the two groups were performed during three visits: before starting <b>oils</b> <b>consumption</b> and application, after 30 days of <b>oils</b> <b>consumption</b> and application, and after 60 days of <b>oils</b> <b>consumption</b> and application. Results: The <b>consumption</b> of argan <b>oil</b> led to a significant increase of gross-elasticity of the skin (R 2) (P< 0. 001), net elasticity of the skin (R 5) (P< 0. 001), biological elasticity (R 7) (P< 0. 001), and a significant decrease of RRT (P= 0. 002). The application of argan oil led to a significant increase of gross-elasticity of the skin (R 2) (P< 0. 001), net elasticity of the skin (R 5) (P< 0. 001), biological elasticity (R 7) (P= 0. 001), and a significant decrease of RRT (P< 0. 001). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the daily consumption and/or topical application of argan oil have an anti-aging effect on the skin demonstrated by the improvement of skin elasticity, characterized by an increase of R-parameters (R 2, R 5, and R 7) and a decrease of RRT.

Here, we invesyigated the effect of educationalintervention on women’s behavior about <b>oils</b> and fats <b>consumption</b> in Tadayon and Family health centersin Semnan, Iran. Materials and Methods: In this study, 250 and 255 families were selected by the coincidental clustersampling, before and after intervention, respectively. Data were collected by questionnaire via ofinterview. The intervention consisted of speeches, installation mentioned in the leaflet, leaflet distributionand printing educational materials in the local newspaper. Results: In the majority of families, the first preference of oil for preparation of non fried foods (56. 4 vs. 36. 8, before and after intervention, respectively) and fried foods (60. 8 vs. 32. 7, before and afterintervention, respectively) was solid hydrogenated vegetable oil. After training, the use of conventionalliquid oil and frying oil for the preparation of fried and non-fired foods was increased significantly(p< 0. 001). After intervention the percent of subjects who removed the visible fat from red meats wasincreased from 52 % to 62. 5 % (p< 0. 01). In addition, after intervention the percent of people believed tobe harmful usage of hydrogenated oil was increased (p< 0. 028).
