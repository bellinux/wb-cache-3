50|$|The {{patient is}} {{administered}} with a radioactive pharmaceutical agent, such as iodine, which will naturally collect in the thyroid. The detector moves in a raster pattern over studied {{area of the}} patient, making a constant count rate.

The <b>output</b> <b>method</b> is designed such that positional and detection information is maintained. For example when using a light source and film the light is moved in tandem with the detector, and the intensity of light produced increases with an increase in activity, producing dark areas on the film.|$|E
50|$|Three {{strategies}} {{have been used}} to obtain the market values of all the goods and services produced: the product (or <b>output)</b> <b>method,</b> the expenditure method, and the income method. The product method looks at the economy on an industry-by-industry basis. The total output of the economy is the sum of the outputs of every industry. However, since an output of one industry may be used by another industry and become part of the output of that second industry, to avoid counting the item twice we use not the value output by each industry, but the value-added; that is, the difference between the value of what it puts out and what it takes in. The total value produced by the economy is the sum of the values-added by every industry.|$|E
50|$|Speech mapping (also {{known as}} output-based measures) {{involves}} testing with a speech or speech-like signal. The hearing aid is adjusted {{so that the}} speech is amplified to the approximate middle of the patient's residual auditory area (the amplitude range between the patient's hearing threshold and upper limit of comfort) while observing a real-time spectrum display of the speech in the patient's ear canal. Many multi-channel hearing aids allow each frequency channel to be adjusted separately. The aim {{is to find a}} good compromise between intelligibility and loudness discomfort. This approach to hearing aid testing is implemented in most current real ear systems {{and there has been a}} significant increase in audiologists selecting to verify using the <b>output</b> <b>method.</b> Using a real speech signal to test a hearing aid has the advantage that features that may need to be disabled in other test approaches can be left active, and the effects of these features in normal use are included in the test.|$|E

5000|$|The {{market value}} {{approach}} comes {{with its own}} set of flaws. One type of approach within this category is the Direct <b>Output</b> <b>Method,</b> which is based on the value of production rather than the hours of labour performed in the household. [...] It solves the problem of having {{to come up with a}} standard wage, but it is inherently difficult to obtain data on production output (e.g., number of pants folded) in the home. Furthermore, comparing the value of individual tasks performed to the average market price it would cost to get that same task completed may not be accurate, as multiple tasks can and are often done simultaneously in the home. To counteract this problem, one can construct a valuation based on the total wages of a housekeeper who performs a similar set of tasks. Yet, even then, the model does not take into account that men and women in the labour market often do housework, but hire housekeepers to do specific jobs that may require particular skills or expertise and demand a higher wage as a result.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: We {{investigated}} the accuracy and feasibility of a 2 D echo-independent ultrasonic continuous wave Doppler cardiac output monitoring device (USCOM) operated by trained nurse for the atrio-ventricular interval (AVI) optimization in cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). Background: CRT is of proven benefit {{in patients with}} advanced chronic heart failure and ventricular conduction delay. Appropriate AVI selection is critical to optimize hemodynamic in CRT. Currently, most non-invasive methods for AVI optimization are often complicated and labor-intensive. Methods: USCOM method, Ritter method, and aortic outflow cardiac <b>output</b> <b>method</b> {{were used to determine}} the optima AVI in 20 patients with CRT. The accuracy and time for measurement of each method were determined. Results: The optimal AVI determined by USCOM method had good correlation with Ritter's method and aortic outflow estimated cardiac <b>output</b> <b>method</b> (r 2 = 0. 78, P < 0. 01 and r 2 = 0. 73, P < 0. 01, respectively). The optimal AVI determined USCOM method showed good agreement (within 10 msec range) with Ritter's method (85 % patients) and aortic outflow estimated cardiac <b>output</b> <b>method</b> (80 %). The mean time for determining AVI using USCOM method was shorter than that with aortic outflow method (7. 1 ± 0. 7 min vs 12. 7 ± 1. 1 min, P < 0. 01), whereas the mean time was shortest for Ritter method (4. 7 ± 1. 6 min vs 7. 1 ± 0. 7 min, P < 0. 01). Conclusion: USCOM device operated by trained nurse can provide a simple, accurate, and fast non-invasive method for the AVI optimization in CRT population. © 2007, The Authors. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|Critics {{routinely}} fault traditional {{measures of}} economic development for being {{out of touch with}} reality. Nowhere is this disparity more apparent than in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), which doesn't count any work done by mothers and fathers in the home as “productive. ” However, since the UN's Fourth World Conference on Women in 1995 there have been greater efforts to correct this shortcoming by including unpaid household work in the System of National Accounts (SNA) (used to calculate the GDP). One approach to addressing this issue is the use of household satellite accounts (HHSA), which economists and policymakers would use in tandem with the GDP. Even so, two problems hamper its use: lack of universal awareness and lack of universal methodology. This paper reviews recent HHSA studies, results, and methodologies in order to increase awareness about them and call for a universally accepted methodology. In this paper, I make the case for a two-tiered methodology. 1. Primary use of the <b>output</b> <b>method</b> due to its methodological consistency with the SNA, while it also places a realistic value on unpaid work. 2. At the same time, a standardised input method should be available to fit the needs of developing countries who may not have the resources to employ the <b>output</b> <b>method.</b> In the end, with unpaid work estimated by the UN Development Programme at a sum equal to 70 % of the world GDP, the importance and urgency of valuating it and the women and men who perform it cannot be overstated...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} {{work in progress}} in developing kernel methods for enzyme function prediction. Our focus is in developing so called structured <b>output</b> prediction <b>methods,</b> where the enzymatic reaction is the combinatorial target object for prediction. We compared two structured <b>output</b> prediction <b>methods,</b> the Hierarchical Max-Margin Markov algorithm (HM 3) and the Maximum Margin Regression algorithm (MMR) in hierarchical classification of enzyme function. As sequence features we use various string kernels and the GTG feature set derived from the global alignment trace graph of protein sequences. Results In our experiments, in predicting enzyme EC classification we obtain over 85 % accuracy (predicting the four digit EC code) and over 91 % microlabel F 1 score (predicting individual EC digits). In predicting the Gold Standard enzyme families, we obtain over 79 % accuracy (predicting family correctly) and over 89 % microlabel F 1 score (predicting superfamilies and families). In the latter case, structured <b>output</b> <b>methods</b> are significantly more accurate than nearest neighbor classifier. A polynomial kernel over the GTG feature set {{turned out to be}} a prerequisite for accurate function prediction. Combining GTG with string kernels boosted accuracy slightly in the case of EC class prediction. Conclusion Structured output prediction with GTG features is shown to be computationally feasible and to have accuracy on par with state-of-the-art approaches in enzyme function prediction. </p...|$|R
