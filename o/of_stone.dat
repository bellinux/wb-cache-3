50|$|Based on the limited, imprecise and {{inconsistent}} {{information provided by}} Hayes, and utilising maps contemporaneous with the time of Hayes and Penney’s discovery of their Ring <b>of</b> <b>Stones,</b> {{an attempt was made}} to reconstruct their journey. This placed the Hayes-Penney’s Ring <b>of</b> <b>Stones</b> approximately 25 km south southeast of Dongara and about 30 km north of Burt’s Ring <b>of</b> <b>Stones.</b>|$|R
25|$|The Callanish <b>Stones</b> consist <b>of</b> a <b>stone</b> circle <b>of</b> {{thirteen}} <b>stones</b> with a monolith {{near the}} middle. Five rows <b>of</b> standing <b>stones</b> connect to this circle. Two long rows <b>of</b> <b>stones</b> running almost parallel {{to each other}} from the stone circle to the north-northeast form a kind of avenue. In addition, there are shorter rows <b>of</b> <b>stones</b> to the west-southwest, south and east-northeast. The <b>stones</b> are all <b>of</b> the same rock type, namely the local Lewisian gneiss. Within the stone circle is a chambered tomb to the east <b>of</b> the central <b>stone.</b>|$|R

5|$|A {{large number}} of genera of macroinvertebrates have been {{discovered}} in and around Nescopeck Creek.

5|$|A {{large number}} <b>of</b> <b>stone</b> monuments {{were placed in}} the North Acropolis.

50|$|Following this, {{attention}} {{turned to}} locating Hayes and Penney’s Ring <b>of</b> <b>Stones.</b> Whereas Burt’s Ring <b>of</b> <b>Stones</b> had been ‘half a mile’ from the coast, was ‘4 ft.’ {{in diameter and}} a simple circle; the Hayes-Penney Ring <b>of</b> <b>Stones</b> was ‘about’ or ‘at least two mile from the coast’, was ‘eight feet’ across, and had a line <b>of</b> <b>stones</b> leading off it, so that is looked ‘like a pointer’. Apart from {{the distance from the}} coast there was, however, little specific locational information provided in Hayes and Penney’s account. It would appear that they drove south from Dongara {{to the end of a}} dirt track to within ‘about nine miles’ of their Ring <b>of</b> <b>Stones,</b> and then proceeded on foot for ‘seven or eight miles’ - 12.8 km.|$|R

5|$|As {{news about}} the arrest spread, there was {{violence}} {{in other parts of}} Maharashtra too. Sporadic incidents <b>of</b> <b>stone</b> pelting at municipal and private buses were reported in the reat of Maharashtra following the arrest of MNS chief Raj Thackeray in Ratnagiri. In Kothrud area, some alleged MNS activists damaged a company's bus that was taking its employees to workplace. Few Pune Municipal Transport (PMT) buses were stoned by miscreants, police said. Meanwhile, police have picked up around 100 MNS activists, including some corporators as a preventive measure. In Nashik, MNS activists set ablaze a truck near PWD minister Chhagan Bhujbal's farm and also damaged another truck at Vilholi-Phata area, police said. Incidents <b>of</b> <b>stone</b> pelting on MSRTC buses and other vehicles were reported in some areas, they said, adding vehicular traffic on the busy Mumbai-Agra-national highway was disrupted following the protest. Police rounded up 70 MNS activists in Nashik incidents and security was tightened in the city. In Solapur, incidents <b>of</b> <b>stone</b> pelting on state transport buses were also reported. In Nagpur MNS party leaders claimed to have damaged several MSRTC buses.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to perform the {{chemical}} analysis <b>of</b> <b>stones</b> to investigate the pattern of biochemical composition <b>of</b> <b>stones</b> and to determine epidemiological risk factors for stone formation in Ardabil province <b>of</b> Iran. Renal <b>stones</b> from 1268 patients were analyzed during 5 year period from March 2001 -March 2006. These stones were sent to seven laboratories in 2 cities of Ardabil province for analysis from different clinics and hospitals. The stones were analyzed by semi-quantitative method (Saba kit). The powdered stones and standards both were analyzed for uric acid, cystine, oxalate, phosphate, ammonium, calcium and magnesium contents. Male to female ratio was 2. 7 : 1. The stone frequency was very greater in adults as compared to children. Maximum number <b>of</b> <b>stones</b> was analyzed in summer months. Calcium oxalate stones were the commonest followed by uric acid and phosphate stones. Only 8 cystine stone was found in the series analyzed. From the study of epidemiological factors, it seems that the men are more prone to development <b>of</b> <b>stones.</b> A clear stone season seems to exist in the area corresponding to the summer months. The relative increased frequency <b>of</b> <b>stones</b> in the region indicates that nutritional, environmental and genetic factors play a role in the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>stones.</b> M/F ratio, male to female ratio; mm, millimeters; mg, milligram...|$|R
