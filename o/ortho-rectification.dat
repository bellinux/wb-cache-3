40|$|International audienceOrtho-rectification using digital terrain {{models is}} a key issue for full polarimetric complex {{synthetic}} aperture radar (SAR) data because resampling the complex data can corrupt the polarimetric phase, mainly in study sites with relief. This research thus compared two approaches for the <b>ortho-rectification</b> of the complex SAR data: the polarimetric processing is performed before (scientist approach) or after (user approach) the geometric processing. A quantitative evaluation between the two approaches {{as a function of}} different geometric and radiometric parameters was thus performed to quantify the impact of the <b>ortho-rectification</b> on the complex polarimetric SAR. Radarsat- 2 fine-quad data acquired over a rolling relief study site were geometrically processed using a lidar digital surface model. The evaluation results showed than the terrain slopes and land covers can potentially corrupt the polarimetric complex SAR data during the <b>ortho-rectification.</b> Advices are finally provided to reduce these impacts to an acceptable level for the users and their applications. Preliminaries results to simulated compact polarimetric SAR data of the new Canadian Radar Constellation Mission will be presented at the conference...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a four-step <b>ortho-rectification</b> {{procedure}} for real-time geo-referencing of video data from a low-cost UAV equipped with a multi-sensor system. The basic procedures for the real-time <b>ortho-rectification</b> are: (1) decompilation of the video stream into individual frames; (2) establishing the interior camera orientation parameters; (3) determining the relative orientation parameters for each video frame with respect to each other; (4) finding the absolute orientation parameters, using a self-calibration bundle and adjustment {{with the aid of}} a mathematical model. Each ortho-rectified video frame is then mosaicked together to produce a mosaic image of the test area, which is then merged with a well referenced existing digital map for the purpose of geo-referencing and aerial surveillance. A test field located in Abuja, Nigeria was used to evaluate our method. Video and telemetry data were collected for about fifteen minutes, and they were processed using the four-step <b>ortho-rectification</b> procedure. The results demonstrated that the geometric measurement of the control field from ortho-images is more accurate when compared with those from original perspective images when used to pin point the exact location of targets on the video imagery acquired by the UAV. The 2 -D planimetric accuracy when compared with the 6 control points measured by a GPS receiver is between 3 to 5 metres...|$|E

40|$|True-orthophotographs are {{now being}} widely used in some areas, proving already as very {{valuable}} documents even replacing maps being more complete, reliable and objective. But they are still hard to produce with enough quality for other uses and scales, such as in architecture and conservation. Most works in these fields are just approximate <b>ortho-rectifications</b> by single or multiple planes [1]. Some academic attempts to reach quality “true ” orthophotos were made recently [2] [9] {{using a combination of}} laser scanner and images, but are still costly solutions lacking from the flexibility needed for field work. In this paper, a new practical technique and software to produce these architectural orthophotographs is presented, departing just from conventional digital photographs with no need for metric cameras or laser scanner, and for small projects, not even for topographical surveying. It is also intended to be easy to use for non-photogrammetrists, dramatically reducing the working time usually spent in other photogrammetry applications. This method requires very intensive calculations through a dedicated software development using GPU (Graphic Processing Unit), making easier and faster the production of high quality true-orthophotographs. The prototype was already tested producing some orthophotographs in a commercial environment and is being now developed as a compact software application making very easy to widely produce quality architectural orthoimages, that we feel can become a standard in heritage documentation soon. 1...|$|R
40|$|Evaluation and {{analysis}} of most remotely sensed data requires careful image-to-image reg-istration or <b>ortho-rectification</b> (geocoding). Photogrammetric practice has shown that poly-nomial transformation functions are useful for registration of aerial photographs. However, multi- and hyperspectral remotely sensed data are often recorded by airborne line scanners. Then <b>ortho-rectification</b> by conventional global coordinate transforms is not satisfactory, particularly due to the non-instantaneous image formation process. It is rather necessary to allow for local corrections of distortions. We have implemented two interpolation techniques for the computation of the resam-pling coordinates, local AKIMA and HARDY multiquadric interpolation, and applied them to experimental image data. Comparison shows that resampling based on AKIMA interpo-lation is much faster than on HARDY multiquadric. Moreover, AKIMA interpolation in the limit corresponds to conventional second degree polynomial transformation. It is thus an appropriate instrument for local image registration utilizing ground control points. 1...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The <b>ortho-rectification</b> of {{satellite}} images is normally a time-consuming and expensive task. It can strongly benefit from automatic or semi-automatic procedures {{in order to}} avoid field work for ground control survey. This article presents an automated method to automatically georeference satel-lite images acquired by the ASTER sensor. The method is based on automatic matching of images and Digital Elevation Models (DEM). First a DEM is ex-tracted from the two stereo image bands, which then is matched to the SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) DEM in order to correct its position in a map reference system. This allows for the simultaneous correction of image geo-location, which then is followed by the <b>ortho-rectification.</b> The method was applied to an ASTER image from North Portugal and assessed using topog-raphic map data. It was possible to geo-reference images in hilly terrain with positional accuracy better than one pixel. ...|$|E

40|$|Title {{from first}} page of PDF file (viewed November 19, 2010) Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 74) The work for this thesis is to develop an image rectification application that performs automatic image <b>ortho-rectification</b> for images taken by the Rotomotion robotic UAV helicopter. The application also geo-references the images with the geo-location and attitude data for use in other geographic image system (GIS) software. This thesis is {{in support of the}} "Robotic Helicopter for Monitoring Pollution and Habitat Restoration at Tijuana Estuary" project, which goal is to build and test a robotic helicopter that can fly to locations at Tijuana Estuary that are too dangerous or sensitive to reach on foot or on a boat, and capture high-resolution, geo-referenced images for use in monitoring pollution and habitat condition. Although there are many image processing applications available that can perform image rectification, most are based on non-parametric methods, which require users to input reference control points for each image. In addition, the proprietary format of the Rotomotion data and the large number of image files call for the need of an automated application that can perform image rectification and image geo-reference. Hence, the automatic image rectification application in this thesis has been developed to resolve these problems. For this thesis, a parametric based <b>ortho-rectification</b> algorithm is developed. The algorithm models the attitude error of the robotic helicopter and rectifies the geometric distortions. This process uses the GPS geo-location data and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) attitude data obtained from the helicopter's onboard flight computer during flight. In addition to the algorithm development, a windows application has been developed by implementing the parametric <b>ortho-rectification</b> algorithm. The image rectification application is fully automated and can process multiple images without any user intervention. Finally, several test flights were conducted near the Tijuana Estuary to validate the performance of the robotic helicopter and image rectification applications. The application provided a modest improvement on the rectification of the images, due to sensor in-accuracy and timing synchronization of the system...|$|E

40|$|Rather than fitting {{a single}} model, as is {{typically}} done, this approach fits {{a sequence of}} three models. The first model estimates the azimuth of the image, the image scaling factor and image shifting; the second model estimates the overall image pitch/shearing angle; and the third model estimates the image roll and swing angles and the affine transformation coefficients. The first and second models are linear while the third model is non-linear. Unlike other <b>ortho-rectification</b> approaches which require sensor and orbital ephemeris information and large numbers of control points, the three-model approach requires only the rough satellite orbit height above the earth’s surface and a minimum of only four control points for the whole process. In experimental trials, this new approach has been tested and compared with established implementations of rigorous satellite orbital modelling. Overall, {{the results from the}} three-model approach for satellite image <b>ortho-rectification</b> are promising in comparison to the rigorous satellite orbital modelling. The three-model approach is easy to understand (it has a clear physical meaning for each model) and the implementation is very simple. The biggest advantage of the three-model approach over other approaches {{is that it does not}} require good approximations for parameters and other associated information (such as ephemeris data). In addition, to ensure minimal residuals within a production environment, the proposed three-model approach employs a robust estimation technique.

40|$|Low-cost Unmanned Airborne Vehicles (UAVs) {{are rapidly}} {{becoming}} suitable platforms for acquiring remote sensing data {{for a wide}} range of applications. For example, a UAV-based mobile mapping system (MMS) is emerging as a novel phenotyping tool that delivers several advantages to alleviate the drawbacks of conventional manual plant trait measurements. Moreover, UAVs equipped with direct geo-referenced frame cameras and pushbroom scanners can acquire geospatial data for comprehensive high-throughput phenotyping. UAVs for mobile mapping platforms are low-cost and easy to use, can fly closer to the objects, and are filling an important gap between ground wheel-based and traditional manned-airborne platforms. However, consumer-grade UAVs are capable of carrying only equipment with a relatively light payload and their flying time is determined by a limited battery life. These restrictions of UAVs unfortunately force potential users to adopt lower-quality direct geo-referencing and imaging systems that may negatively impact the quality of the deliverables. Recent advances in sensor calibration and automated triangulation have made it feasible to obtain accurate mapping using low-cost camera systems equipped with consumer-grade GNSS/INS units. However, <b>ortho-rectification</b> of the data from a linear-array scanner is challenging for low-cost UAV systems, because the derived geo-location information from pushbroom sensors is quite sensitive to the performance of the implemented direct geo-referencing unit. This thesis presents a novel approach for improving the <b>ortho-rectification</b> of hyperspectral pushbroom scanner imagery with the aid of orthophotos generated from frame cameras through the identification of conjugate features while modeling the impact of residual artifacts in the direct geo-referencing information. The experimental results qualitatively and quantitatively proved the feasibility of the proposed methodology in improving the geo-referencing accuracy of real datasets collected over an agricultural field. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explains}} how <b>ortho-rectification</b> of frame camera, aerial photography is fairly complex, {{and the difficulties}} associated with rectifying oblique aerial photos (OAPs) from small format photography have been so problematic that the approach has been little used and seldom described within the literature. Recent advances in photogrammetric software, however, have now made conventional, frame camera photogrammetry more convenient and more easily {{able to deal with}} the <b>ortho-rectification</b> of space-borne and air-borne sensors as well as hand-held film and digital cameras. Consequently, it is now possible to use oblique photography to correct vertical photographs - provided that we address issues related to image distortion and ensure that the reliability of extracted features is sufficient for their use within Geographic Information Systems (GIS). This will be demonstrated by showing that oblique photographs taken with a hand-held, 35 mm camera during a reconnaissance flight over a weed infested area can be ortho-rectified using modern software, thereby clarifying this approach’s status as a useful aid for delineating infestations for the purpose of say, ground truthing, verification of remotely sensed image analysis or simply contributing towards more comprehensive aerial mapping. The example used here may seem trivial but it actually illustrates, clearly, how a spraying pattern, while possibly too refined to show in a satellite image, can be mapped as a reference for monitoring weed infestations. This example is not intended to be a rigorous application of the technique, but simply a demonstration of its possibilities whenever {{there is a need to}} quickly or frequently update existing spatial data and environmental records in a much more cost-effective way than would be possible through deployment of the much more expensive, conventional, aerial survey methods...|$|E

40|$|Spatial {{accounting}} and monitoring {{of land use}} and land cover (LULC) systems have become essential for the sustainable development of any country. In order to monitor these LULC systems a multi-temporal study is required at regular intervals. Indian Remote Sensing Satellite RESOURCESAT- 1 (IRS-P 6) has a unique sensor called AWiFS having medium resolution and wide ground swath and is designed to have around 80 % overlap across adjacent paths. Hence {{this is one of}} the best-suited sensors for medium scale LULC temporal studies. Standard corrections cannot account for the errors caused due to its swath and terrain relief distortions. For getting the accurate registration with respect to temporal layers or maps an <b>ortho-rectification</b> procedure can be adopted. The Rigorous Sensor Model or the Rational Functional Model (RFM) can be used to ortho rectify such images. In relatively flat areas <b>ortho-rectification</b> is not necessary, but in mountainous terrains ortho rectification is essential. Since the AWiFS camera has differing focal lengths between bands, performing ortho rectification using Rigorous Sensor model on these scenes demands more computations. Alternately a projective transformation approach based on RFM can correct the effects of the temporal data acquired through overlapping paths. The projective transformation simulates the sensor orientation while considering the terrain relief without looking for sensor information. Since this approach considers DEM, effects of terrain undulations can be rectified with high precision. This is a better tool for creating the spatio temporal database for carrying out the LULC natural resource studies. The accuracy of DEM and its corresponding ortho rectified data sets play a major role in the accuracy of the temporal registration.

The study was carried out on different topography in order to determine errors related to the digital surface model used in the <b>ortho-rectification</b> of Sentinel- 2 A scenes.

40|$|Recent {{airborne}} {{remote sensing}} applications show a tendency from {{an interpretation of}} single image strips to an evaluation of extended image maps for further usage in data fusion and GIS applications. Most of the problems during the mosaicking process are caused by geometric <b>ortho-rectification</b> errors, radiation variations across the single image strips and between adjacent image strips. The proposed procedure for generating ortho-rectified image maps consists of the following three steps. Within an image strip radiometric normalization is performed using an image-based empirical radiometric correction method, which accounts for sensor viewing angle effects. Individual strips are then ortho-rectified applying the direct georeferencing approach by using the onboard IGI CCNS/AEROcontrol-IIb system for the GPS/IMU integration and a digital elevation model. To remove the between-strip radiometric variations we propose to use a radiometric correction method, {{which is based on}} the information contained in the overlapping region of the image strips. The processing of data acquired by airborne multi-spectral scanner DAEDALUS AADS 1268 ATM show the effectiveness and potential of the proposed method especially for the thematic analysis applications...|$|E
40|$|Along {{with the}} {{advances}} in technology, modern surveying technology developed rapidly, {{a series of}} high-tech equipments have been invited and developed. A lot of cluster-based Remote Sensing image processing systems, at home or abroad, have been produced and used in production, such as PixelFactory, PixelGrid, CIPS etc. Been popularized and used, processing technology and procedure have changed {{to be different from}} the old pattern, and traditional ways of quality control no longer meet the need of new technology. Above all, it is of vital importance for us to find new ways of procedure quality control for the geographical spatial data quality certification under new technology system. Based on the mainstream image fast processing systems – PixelFactory and PixelGrid, the nodes and methods of quality control during image processing will be studied in this paper, including image preprocessing, AT, DSM, DEM, <b>ortho-rectification,</b> mosaic etc. After that, the feasibility of quality control ways proposed will be verified by actual production project. All the advices can be used as references for large-scale application of new technology in information surveying system...|$|E
