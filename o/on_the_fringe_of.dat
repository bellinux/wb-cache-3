5|$|The first rural {{cemetery}} in the United States—Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts—was {{developed in the}} 1830s. Rural cemeteries are burial grounds typically located <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fringe</b> <b>of</b> a city that offer a natural setting for interment of the dead. The development of rural cemeteries followed closely with the English garden movement of the early 19thcentury.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1970s, there {{remained}} only 40 Mérens horses {{registered in the}} breed studbook. The breed was saved from extinction by utopian communities believing in an ecological apocalypse. As part of the hippie movement, people wanting to live <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fringe</b> <b>of</b> society settled in the small villages of Ariege. They boosted the local economy, including encouraging the resumption of the breeding of Mérens. At the same time, {{the story of the}} semi-feral horse Bonbon became a local phenomenon. This Mérens, orphaned following an accident, was raised on bottle-fed goat milk. He was then sold to a horse-dealer before later returning to his homeland and winning prizes as a stallion. He died at twenty, having returned to his herd high in the mountains.|$|E

Some {{children}} of primary school age attend Colegate Community Primary School, located <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fringe</b> <b>of</b> Windy Nook at Colegate West in neighbouring Leam Lane. This too is a satisfactory school which suffers from inconsistent attainment among pupils. The nearest Roman Catholic school is St Augustine's Primary; a good school at Leam Lane Estate. Secondary school provision is at Thomas Hepburn Community Academy on Swards Road in Felling. This is a satisfactory but improving school where the number of pupils entitled to free school meals {{is more than twice}} the national average.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century and early 20th century, Carlton Hill's notoriety as a slum increased. Poverty, drunkenness, disease and low living {{standards}} were rife. Brighton's reputation was damaged by a disparaging article in The Lancet in 1882: making reference to Carlton Hill, it criticised the town's poor standards of health. Assisted by government funding, Brighton Corporation undertook extensive slum clearance from 1928 until {{the start of}} World War II, transforming the area's appearance. Two large blocks of flats—Brighton Corporation's first council flats—were built to rehouse many of the displaced residents. The Milner Flats, a long four-storey block, stand {{on the site of}} Woburn Place, and were completed in 1934. Alderman Hugh Milner Black, a Corporation member who campaigned for housing improvements in Brighton, was commemorated in the naming. Kingswood Flats, on the site of Nelson Place and a Primitive Methodist chapel, were built in 1938. The name refers to Minister for Health Kingsley Wood. Some displaced residents were moved out of the area: the new council estates of Whitehawk and Moulsecoomb, built in the 1920s and early 1930s <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fringe</b> <b>of</b> Brighton, accommodated many former Carlton Hill residents. An earlier low-rise development took place in 1931, when the small Tarnerland council estate was built on empty land near Tilbury Place.|$|E

On the other hand, his Suisho genso (Crystalline Fantasy) is pure stream-of-consciousness writing. He was even involved in writing the script for the experimental film A Page of Madness.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} the Family began to form, Manson was an {{unemployed}} former convict, who had spent half {{of his life in}} correctional institutions for a variety of offenses.

After Manson was charged with the crimes of which he was later convicted, recordings of songs written and performed by him were released commercially.

25|$|Hainan {{has always}} been <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fringe</b> <b>of</b> the Chinese {{cultural}} sphere. Traditionally, the island {{was a place of}} exile for criminals and disgraced officials. As a frontier region celebrated by such exiled poets as Su Dongpo, Hainan acquired an air of mystery and romance. The influx of large numbers of mainlanders after 1950 – particularly in the 1970s, when young Chinese from southern Guangdong were assigned to state farms to help develop Hainan, and in the 1980s, when thousands more came {{to take advantage of the}} economic opportunities offered – has perpetuated the frontier atmosphere on the island.|$|E

In 1947 he finally established himself in the side and played 18 championship matches, plus 4 other first class games, scoring 567 runs and doubling his batting average to 20.25. Fittingly, he made his maiden century for Hampshire against Worcestershire at Southampton in 1951, which was instrumental helping Hampshire to a 5 wicket victory. That proved to be his best season with the bat, scoring 1189 runs at an average of 30.48.|$|E
