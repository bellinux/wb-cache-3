5|$|Although the {{majority}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>works</b> were in Polish, he tried {{his hand at}} several works in French language (Le roi de Landawa, Beatrice Cenci). Many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>works</b> were published only posthumously, often under arbitrary titles, as Słowacki never named them himself. He also left notes on works that he never began or never completed. Słowacki is also considered the father of modern Polish drama.|$|E

5|$|Translations <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>works</b> are {{difficult}} due to passages with elaborate word formation, alien or robotic poetry, and puns.|$|E
5|$|After his death, Gasparo's {{reputation}} {{fell into}} oblivion caused by unfavourable secular criticism. His complex artistic personality and catalog of works were only reconstructed {{from the end}} of the twentieth century, thanks to targeted critical studies that have for the first time allowed a thorough analysis and rediscovery <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>works.</b>|$|E

5|$|Busoni gave many (but not all) <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>works</b> opus numbers; {{some numbers}} apply {{to more than}} one work (after the {{composer}} dropped some of his earlier works from his acknowledged corpus). Nor are the composer's numbers all in temporal order. The musicologist Jürgen Kindermann has prepared a thematic catalogue <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>works</b> and transcriptions which is also used, {{in the form of the}} letters BV (for Busoni Verzeichnis, German:Busoni Index: sometimes the letters KiV for Kindermann Verzeichnis are used) followed by an identifier, to identify his compositions and transcriptions. The identifier B (for Bearbeitung, German: arrangement) is used for Busoni's transcriptions and cadenzas– e.g. BV B 1 refers to Busoni's cadenzas for Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 4.|$|E

He also edited 5 {{magazines}} and translated 15 books or other writings.

50|$|Gaywood was prolific, {{the bulk}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>work</b> {{consisting}} <b>of</b> portraits and frontispieces to books, {{for which he}} was widely employed by publishers. Much <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>work</b> was for Peter Stent.|$|R
5000|$|Epstein was Jewish, and {{negative}} reviews <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>work</b> sometimes {{took on an}} antisemitic flavour, {{though he did not}} attribute the [...] "average unfavorable criticism" [...] <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>work</b> to antisemitism.|$|R
5|$|Chisholm's Neoclassical Period {{refers to}} several <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>works</b> which were {{inspired}} by ancient and obscure motifs from the pre-Classical era. His Sonatina no. 3, evidently based on several ricercare motifs originally written by Dalza, fuses Brittenesque harmonies and gentle dissonances in quintessentially pianistic textures.|$|E
5|$|Elgar {{has been}} {{described}} as the first composer to take the gramophone seriously. Between 1914 and 1925, he conducted a series of acoustic recordings <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>works.</b> The introduction of the moving-coil microphone in 1923 made far more accurate sound reproduction possible, and Elgar made new recordings of most of his major orchestral works and excerpts from The Dream of Gerontius.|$|E
5|$|His {{works have}} been {{translated}} into Belorussian, Bulgarian, Czech, Esperanto, Finnish, German, Hungarian, Russian and Slovenian. Almost none <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>works</b> have {{been translated into}} English; the only exception is the short story Wyjątkowo trudny teren ("Particularly Difficult Territory") that Zajdel wrote for the English language Tales from the Planet Earth anthology edited by Frederik Pohl and Elizabeth Anne Hull.|$|E

5|$|Hogarth {{revisited}} Morning in his bidding ticket, Battle of the Pictures, for {{the auction}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>works,</b> held in 1745.

5|$|In his fifties, Elgar {{composed}} a symphony and a violin concerto that were immensely successful. His second symphony and his cello concerto did not gain immediate public popularity and took {{many years to}} achieve a regular place in the concert repertory of British orchestras. Elgar's music came, in his later years, {{to be seen as}} appealing chiefly to British audiences. His stock remained low for a generation after his death. It began to revive significantly in the 1960s, helped by new recordings <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>works.</b> Some <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>works</b> have, in recent years, been taken up again internationally, but the music continues to be played more in Britain than elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Johnson's style {{evolved from}} realism to {{expressionism}} to a powerful folk style, {{for which he}} is best known.

She can be seen seated on the left of the painting in a red dress.|$|E
5|$|Murphy {{continued}} to make films in the 1960s. Murphy and Huston worked together one {{more time in the}} 1960 film The Unforgiven, in which Murphy took second billing as Burt Lancaster's racist kid brother who was bent on the destruction of the Kiowa.Writer Clair Huffaker had success in a number <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>works</b> being adapted for the films, including his 1958 novel Flaming Lance being filmed as the Elvis Presley western Flaming Star. Two <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>works</b> retained their original titles when Huffaker wrote the screenplays for them as Murphy's films in 1961, Seven Ways from Sundown and Posse from Hell. Author Bob Herzberg deemed the scripts two of the best Murphy worked with in that decade. Herbert Coleman directed Posse from Hell as well as the black and white World War II drama Battle at Bloody Beach set in the Philippines.|$|E
