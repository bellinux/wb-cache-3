It is very particular. I consider that I went through all stages, from popcorn to dance, club and pop music, so I considered that I have reached a maturity which allows me to release a song which I like, which makes me move in a club and {{makes me want to}} hear it on the radio, and I'm very fulfilled.|$|E
5|$|In 1805, Messrs. Wood and Street, from Richmond, Va., {{found their}} way to Kentucky. Friendly {{considerations}} led me to patronize them. This was done through the solicitations of a young friend from Virginia. They commenced a paper, published in 1806, called the 'Western World.' Imbibing strong prejudices against slavery, perhaps from my mother's repeating, in my infancy, the nurse's songs composed by Cowper, designed to make such impressions. In June 1806, to the great astonishment <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>friends,</b> I left Kentucky, with all the flattering prospects a youth could have, and hastened to Ohio. Connecting circumstances, and from hints that fell from Wood and others, a deep impression had been made on my mind, that an eventful period was fast approaching.|$|E

25|$|In 2006, Warwick {{signed with}} Concord Records after a fifteen-year tenure at Arista, which had ended in 1994. Her {{first and only}} release for the label was My Friends and Me, a duets album {{containing}} reworkings of her old hits, very similar to her 1998 CD Dionne Sings Dionne. Among her singing partners were Gloria Estefan, Olivia Newton-John, Wynonna Judd and Reba McEntire. The album peaked at #66 on the Top R/Hip-Hop Albums chart. The album was produced by her son, Damon Elliott. A follow-up album featuring Warwick's old hits as duets with male vocalists was planned, but the project was cancelled. The relationship with Concord concluded with the release <b>of</b> <b>My</b> <b>Friends</b> and Me. A compilation CD of her greatest hits and love songs, The Love Collection, entered the UK pop charts at number 27 on February 16, 2008.|$|E
25|$|It is {{time for}} a new beginning. As I have {{discussed}} with some <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> over the past few weeks, my elected service is one piece of what I hope will be an interesting and diverse professional career. After spending more than 13 of my 31 years in public service, it {{is time for}} a change for me and my family. I was appointed to my first public position as a college freshman and leave my second elected office as a proud father of three little girls. I am stepping down today from the State Assembly to turn greater attention to them and my law practice and to fulfilling other personal and professional aspirations. I will remain an active and vocal voice for better schools, a cleaner environment and lower taxes. I am grateful for the friendship and support of so many, especially my wife Lauren, my family, my campaign volunteers and my clients. It has been a privilege to serve.|$|E

[...] Ament said, [...] "In some ways, it's like the band's story. It's about growing up."

[...] In an interview, Lavigne said about her collaboration with Kroeger: [...] "I have a song called Hello Kitty, which I wrote about Hello Kitty because I'm obsessed, and it's a really fun thing that I've never done before. It kind of has a kind of glitchy, electronic feel to it and it's... the only one on the record that sounds like that. It's really different and a lot <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> I've played it for really like it. I'm having a lot of fun with that one." ...|$|E

On October 18, 2007, Peck was invited by the Cleveland Indians to sing the National Anthem prior to Game 5 of the American League Championship Series between the Red Sox and Indians. Beckett was the {{starting}} pitcher in that game, and some Red Sox fans theorized that her invitation was an attempt by the Indians organization to distract Beckett. The Indians denied this claim. It did not seem to affect Beckett, as he beat the Indians with eight innings pitched, five hits, one walk, one earned run, and eleven strikeouts. In a postgame interview with Beckett, when asked if he was affected by Peck's presence, Beckett replied, [...] "I don't get paid to make those decisions. She's a friend of mine. It doesn't bother me at all. Thanks for flyin' one <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> to the game so she could watch it for free."
