40|$|Speech {{recognition}} systems tend to {{be sensitive}} to unimportant steady-state variation in speech spectra (i. e. those caused by vary-ing the microphone or channel characteristics). There have been many attempts <b>o</b> <b>solve</b> <b>this</b> problem; however, these techniques are often computationally burdensome, specially for real-time implementation. Recently, Hermansy et el. [1] and Hirsch et el. [2] have suggested a simple technique that removes slow-moving lin-ear channel variation with little adverse ffect on speech recogni-tion performance. In this paper we examine this technique, known as RASTA filtering, and evaluate its performance when applied to SRI's DECIPHER TM speech recognition system [3 l. We show that RASTA filtering succeeds in reducing DECIPHERTM's depen-dence on the channel. 2...|$|E

40|$|We extend homological {{perturbation}} theory to encompass algebraic structures governed by operads and cooperads. The main difficulty {{is to find}} a suitable notion of algebra homotopy that generalizes to algebras over operads <b>O.</b> To <b>solve</b> <b>this</b> problem, we introduce what we call thick maps of O-algebras and special thick maps that we call pseudo-derivations, which serve as appropriate generalizations of algebra homotopies for the purposes of homological {{perturbation theory}}. As an application, we derive explicit formulas for transferring Cobar(C) -algebra structures along contractions, where C is any connected cooperad in chain complexes. This specializes to transfer formulas for O-infinity algebras for any Koszul operad O, in particular for A-infinity, C-infinity, L-infinity and G-infinity algebras. A key feature is that our formulas are expressed in terms of the compact description of Cobar(C) -algebras as coderivation differentials on cofree C-coalgebras. Moreover, we get formulas not only for the transferred structure and a structure on the inclusion, but also for structures on the projection and the homotopy.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the long time (i. e. monthly) {{operating}} rule of one dam system. The monthly input flow into a dam are approximated by the Gamma-type distributions, and output flow is constant {{in a period of}} a month. The mathma-tical model of a discrete dam system is treated as a Markov process. The problem is how to determine the optimum quantity in each month so as to maximize the total sum of a year obtainable from a dam, under the constraint that the probability of emptiness of dam content is less than <b>O.</b> 1. To <b>solve</b> <b>this</b> problem, the Heuristic Programming is used. The numerical results of the optimum quantity in each month under the above constraint are shown by using the input data of real dams in Kitakyushu city. INTRODUCT[ION It is necessary to supply suMcient water to cities which are expanding and have large scale factories. To obtain the necessary water continuously from dams is demanded economically and socially. For the operation of dams, it is important to determine the optimum quantity (i. e. the maximum quantity without deple...|$|R

A semidefinite program (SDP) is an {{optimization}} problem over n × n symmetric matrices where a linear {{function of the}} entries is to be minimized subject to linear equality constraints, and the condition that the unknown matrix is positive semidefinite.
