In Comana lake, tetra- and <b>octoploids</b> were found, whereas in the Danube Delta also hexaploids occurred. In freshwater habitats, shoots of <b>octoploids</b> were longer and thicker with more nodes than those of tetraploids. Panicles of octopoids were also larger than those of tetraploids. The number of alive leaves did not differ between ploidy levels. Total leaf area, however was higher of octo- than of tetraploids, which indicates that <b>octoploids</b> produced larger leaves. <b>Octoploids</b> also had thicker rhizomes. No differences in allocation of dry matter to leaves, stems, and leaves (blades and sheaths) were found between tetra- and <b>octoploids.</b> Both tetra- and <b>octoploids</b> shoots were among the tallest in the central Danube Delta. Tetraploids were morphologically more diverse in Comana lake than in the central Danube Delta. Within areas, size of shoots could, however, not be related to water depth.

Comparing cpDNA phylogeny with different cytotypes provides insights into the origin and establishment of polyploid species. We have previously defined the geographic distribution of cytotypes in prairie cordgrass throughout the {{different regions of the}} United States. In this study, chloroplast haplotype variation is explored in 54 populations of prairie cordgrass, using nine noncoding chloroplast regions. These chloroplast analyses were combined with the cytotype surveys of prairie cordgrass to infer the phylogeography and to elucidate the origin of the different cytotypes. In this study, we identified three haplotypes, Prairie Cordgrass Group 1 (PCG 1), Prairie Cordgrass Group 2 (PCG 2), and Prairie Cordgrass Group 3 (PCG 3). In general, related haplotypes were strongly associated with geographic distribution. Useful insertions-deletions (indels) were also found among prairie cordgrass populations. The PCG 1 haplotypes collected in the East North Central to the New England regions of the US, were polyploid (tetraploid, hexaploid, and <b>octoploids),</b> while the PCG 2 haplotypes, found in southern South Dakota, Iowa, and Missouri, were primarily <b>octoploids,</b> but also included a small number of tetraploids.

40|$|The highest {{frequency}} of polyploidy among plants {{is considered to}} occur in the Pteridophytes. In this study, we focused on polyploidy displayed by a specific fern taxon, the genus Pteris L. (Pteridaceae), comprising over 250 species. Cytological data from 106 Pteris species were reviewed. The base number of chromosomes in Pteris is 29. Polyploids are frequently found in Pteris, including triploids, tetraploids, pentaploids, hexaploids, and <b>octoploids.</b> In addition, an aneuploid species, P. deltodon Bak., has been recorded. Furthermore, the relationship between polyploidy and reproductive biology is reviewed. Among these 106 Pteris species, 60 % exhibit polyploidy: 22 % show intraspecific polyploidy and 38 % result from polyploid speciation. Apogamous species are common in Pteris. Diploids are the most frequent among Pteris species, and they can be sexual or apogamous. Triploids are apogamous; tetraploids are sexual or apogamous. Most Pteris species have one to two ploidy levels.

40|$|Abstract Background The genus Fragaria {{comprises}} {{species at}} ploidy levels ranging from diploid (2 n = 2 x = 14) to decaploid (2 n = 10 x = 70). Fluorescence {{in situ hybridization}} with 5 S and 25 S rDNA probes was performed to gather cytogenetic information that illuminates genomic divergence among different taxa at multiple ploidy levels, {{as well as to}} explore the evolution of ribosomal RNA genes during polyploidization in Fragaria. Results Root tip cells of diploid taxa were typified by two 5 S and six 25 S rDNA hybridization signals of varying intensities, providing a baseline for comparisons within the genus. In three exceptional diploid genotypes, F. nilgerrensis (CFRA 1358 and CFRA 1825) and F. vesca 'Yellow Wonder', two 5 S but only four 25 S rDNA sites were found but with differing site losses. The numbers of 5 S and 25 S rDNA signals, respectively were three and nine in a triploid F. × bifera accession, and were four and twelve in three tetraploids, thus occurring in proportional 1. 5 × and 2 × multiples of the typical diploid pattern. In hexaploid F. moschata, a proportional multiple of six 5 S rDNA sites was observed, but the number of 25 S rDNA sites was one or two less than the proportionate prediction of eighteen. This apparent tendency toward rDNA site loss at higher ploidy was markedly expanded in <b>octoploids,</b> which displayed only two 5 S and ten 25 S rDNA sites. In the two decaploids examined, the numbers of 5 S and 25 S rDNA signals, respectively, were four and fifteen in F. virginiana subsp. platypetala, and six and twelve in F. iturupensis. Conclusions Among diploid Fragaria species, a general consistency of rDNA site numbers implies conserved genomic organization, but highly variable 25 S signal sizes and intensities and two instances of site loss suggest concurrent high dynamics of rDNA copy numbers among both homologs and non-homologs. General conservation of rDNA site numbers in lower ploidy, but marked site number reductions at higher ploidy levels, suggest complex evolution of rDNA sites during polyploidization and/or independent evolutionary pathways for 6 x versus higher ploidy strawberries. Site number comparisons suggest common genomic composition among natural <b>octoploids,</b> and independent origins of the two divergent decaploid accessions. </p...|$|R

40|$|A central {{goal of the}} RosBREED {{consortium}} {{has been}} to establish SNP arrays for peach, cherry, apple, and strawberry, to facilitate QTL discovery and marker‐assisted breeding. This goal has been advanced by the release of three Illumina® Infinium® arrays for apple, peach, and cherry (8 K, 9 K and 6 K, respectively). Here, {{we report on the}} development of a 90 K Strawberry Affymetrix Axiom® genotyping array. The cultivated strawberry is an allo‐octoploid. This level and type of ploidy creates challenges to overcome, which we address in several ways. First, the large size of the array permits success despite a lower conversion rate of candidate to functional SNPs than for diploid crops. Second, we exploit site‐specific, biological reductions in ploidy resulting from subgenome‐specific deletions. Third, we exploit designed reductions in ploidy by targeting probes to sites of subgenome‐specific sequence motifs. Fourth, we include SNPs and/or probes specific to one sub‐genome. We are using a diverse germplasm discovery panel of 19 <b>octoploids.</b> The array will target several polymorphism types, including indels and di‐ and multi‐allelic SNPs.

Crosses of aα x a, aα x a, aaα x a, aαα x a, etc. resulted in the production of respective hybrids with a relatively high frequency of about 10 - 6 to 10 - 7, whereas crosses of aaα x a, aαα x α, aaαα x a, aaαα x α, etc. resulted in hybrids with an extremely low frequency of about less than 10 - 8. Genetic analyses revealed that the rare matings were mostly caused by the presence of cells derived from the non-maters in which mating type had converted to a homozygous genotype. Mitotic recombination was shown to be a likely explanation for most of the conversion, judging from associated exchange of an outside marker, thr 4.

Doubled haploid plants are highly valued by both consumers and breeders as these plants usually show larger flower, leaves and fruit, thus making them more marketable. Marianna open pollinated plum rootstocks’ adaptability to different soil types and moisture conditions has been favoured in polyploidy studies as parental material in breeding programmes. The potential of the microtubule depolymerizing herbicide (oryzalin) for in vitro chromosome doubling were investigated by optimizing the concentration and incubation time of plant shoots to the antimitotic agent. Meristem tissues were treated for two time intervals (24 and 48 h) with five different concentrations of oryzalin (50, 75, 100, 150 or 200 μM) in liquid Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium. After treatment, plants were allowed to grow under a 16 / 8 h light/dark photoperiod at 24 ± 2 ˚C for 4 weeks. One and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2 -DE) coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) was used to separate, visualise and identify differently expressed proteins. Furthermore, changes in ROS accumulation, photosynthetic pigmentation, lipid peroxidation and antioxidant enzyme activity (SOD, APX and GR) were investigated. Flow cytometry results revealed that treatment of plants with oryzalin concentrations ranging from 75 to 150 μM induced ploidy after 24 h exposure whereas, 200 μM produced mixoploids containing both tetraploid and <b>octoploids</b> plants after 24 h exposure. Longer incubations of 48 h were detrimental to plant tissues as complete mortality was observed in the higher concentration (100 to 200 μM) treatments. Mass spectrometry analysis identified 14 differentially expressed protein spots that were characterized into different functional categories. ROS accumulation, the extent of lipid peroxidation and antioxidant capacity were differentially regulated in response to oryzalin treatment whereas photosynthetic pigments were significantly enhanced. The results suggests that oryzalin-induced proteins may act as potential biomarkers to improve fruit characteristics in future breeding programs whereas antioxidant enzymes {{play an important role}} in scavenging ROS in plants to enhance their adaptability to different environmental conditions...|$|R

The cultivation of switchgrass carrying novel genes and traits has made ecological risk assessment (ERA) research critical for predicting the effects of pollen dispersal and pollen-mediated gene flow on local switchgrass populations and plant communities. The goals of this research were to: 1) Understand Panicum species distribution, habitat types, and plant communities; 2) Create a Lagrangian model of pollen dispersal informed by data on pollen longevity, size, and wind fields; 3) Determine the potential for interspecific hybridization between switchgrass and other Panicum species; 4) Characterize the genotypes in switchgrass populations in coastal grasslands and inland road verges. All studies were conducted in the northeastern U. S. (Ecoregion Level III: Northeastern Coastal Zone, Northeastern Highlands). In the first study, a botanical survey showed that switchgrass populations were common in three coastal habitat types (semi-natural, human impacted, and roadside) as well as two inland habitats (roadside and wastelands) outside of their expected range. In the second study, pollen longevity, pollen size, and wind fields were used to parameterize a Lagrangian mathematical model to predict pollen dispersal. Switchgrass pollen grains entrained in light, buoyant winds were predicted to travel up to approximately 3. 5 km. A model incorporating stronger, directional winds predicted pollen dispersal up to about 6. 5 km. In the third project, switchgrass flowers were crossed with flowers from four other Panicum species but did not produce hybrid progeny. However, technical challenges prevented robust analysis of interspecific sexual compatibility. In the last study, switchgrass plants collected from inland roadsides and coastal habits were analyzed using their DNA and simple-sequence repeat (SSR) molecular markers. The switchgrass plants in the study were genetically diverse; the majority of inland individuals were identified as Upland <b>octoploids</b> genotypes, while the majority of coastal individuals were identified as Lowland tetraploid genotypes. Collectively, these projects suggest that pollen-mediated gene flow from switchgrass biofuels plantations could potentially alter the genetics of local coastal populations, as well as the composition of natural or roadside plant communities...|$|R
