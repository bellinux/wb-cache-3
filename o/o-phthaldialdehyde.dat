Alloxan {{treatment of}} mice {{was followed by}} a marked increase in the number and fluorescence intensity of the OPT-reactive A 2 -cells, whereas cobalt chloride given to guinea pigs induced an almost total depletion of the cytoplasmic fluorescence with concomitant reduction of their argyrophilia. Microspectrofluorometric analysis of the fluorophore revealed excitation maxima at 370 and 420 mp; the corresponding emis-sion maxima were 430 and 490 mp. This closely resembled the spectral characteristics of the OPT-induced fluorescence of authentic glucagon. It is concluded that OPT forms fluorphores wth glucagon in the A 2 -cells and that the NH 2 -terminal histidine residue of the polypeptide is responsible for the formation of the fluorophore.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{response}} to light of one ommatidium is reduced or suppressed by simultaneous illumination of neighboring ommatidia. The mechanism of this lateral inhibition may be chemical synaptic transmission, {{based on the}} physiological findings {{of a number of}} investigators and on the following evidence. The fine structure of the neuropil of the lateral plexus exhibits numerous clear vesicles (ca. 400 A), dense-core vesicles (ca. 700 - 1400 A), Golgi regions, and other morphological features of neurochemical synapses. The indolealkylamine, serotonin (5 -HT), even in nanomolar concentrations, has a potent inhibitory action. An initial, potent inhibitory dose of 5 -HT produces a long lasting densensitization to subsequent doses. The desensitization affects lateral inhibition evoked by light stimulation of neighboring receptors, i. e. crossed-desensitization. Eye tissue extracts contain 5 -HT and melatonin (MLT) at a level greater than 1 ag/g wet tissue and perhaps as high as 20 - 30,ug/g, as determined by two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and <b>o-phthaldialdehyde</b> fluorescence assay techniques.

In addition, fractionation of the most effective (potent) hydrolysate by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography indicated a direct association between hydrophobicity and radical scavenging activity of the hydrolysates.
