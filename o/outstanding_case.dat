500|$|Upon its release, Mr.Mr {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Heather Phares from AllMusic labelled the EP [...] "a set of songs that offers something for {{every kind of}} Girls' Generation and expands their musical reach." [...] Phares further praised the EP for helping the group to be an <b>outstanding</b> <b>case</b> of Korean popular music. Writing for Billboard, Jeff Benjamin named the six songs of the EP [...] "strong" [...] and called it a more [...] "impressive effort" [...] compared to the group's 2013 album I Got a Boy. He also deemed the track list [...] "a tight bundle of songs that still see the group dipping and experimenting into new sonic territory, but possibly more focused than ever." [...] Benjamin also wrote an article for Fuse, on which he complimented the album's musical styles as [...] "short, sweet, but strong." [...] On the other hand, Kim Do-heon from online magazine IZM compared the EP to the group's 2011 album The Boys for its [...] "balance of musical competence and appeal to mass popularity", but found the songs to be inadequate. He concluded that the group needed to [...] " [...] a clear direction for the future" [...] after the [...] "mistake" [...] of I Got a Boy, and Mr.Mr was not the answer.|$|E
500|$|Brown was {{regarded}} as a cautious starter who was reluctant to use his full array of strokes. He had an upright stance and was known for his trademark leg glancing and placement of the ball. He hooked occasionally and scored the majority of his off-side runs with the cut shot. Johnnie Moyes said that [...] "even when slow, he never wearied, as some do, because his style was cultured and free from jarring faults". Moyes felt that Brown's superior record on English soil was a result of the crowd attitude, which was more respectful. At Australian grounds, impatient spectators who disliked Brown's cautious batting frequently heckled him, blaming Brown for delaying Bradman's arrival to the crease. [...] Moyes felt that the more serene English gallery allowed Brown to play to his game plan without hastening to placate impatient spectators. [...] "A placid chap was Brown, and he liked to play in peaceful surroundings. When on the job he was as emotionless as a stoic." [...] Moyes said that Brown was [...] "always cool and thoughtful, he preferred finesse to force". The English journalist Neville Cardus commented [...] "His cricket is perpetually keeping an appointment leisurely with moments to spare. Does the bat have an engagement this over with a half-volley? Very well, then, put it down in the book. We'll be there for it. Plenty of time." [...] Bradman also noted Brown's ability to quickly get into position to play the ball, writing [...] "One hallmark of good batting is that the player appears to have plenty of time in which to play his strokes. Bill Brown was an <b>outstanding</b> <b>case</b> of one who never seemed to be in a hurry for any stroke." [...] Ray Robinson said that Brown was [...] "the most serene batsman I ever saw play for Australia". Robinson said that [...] "for artistry, Brown's leg-glancing could be mentioned in the same breath as Archie Jackson's". Brown's placid nature extended to his observations of modern cricket—he disliked the emotional displays made by contemporary players.|$|E

50|$|School administrators {{initially}} {{claimed that}} Bradford never actually applied for tenure {{and that the}} faculty had never voted {{on whether or not}} his scholarly and pedagogical record warranted receiving it. Instead, the law faculty had simply held a straw poll to determine the likelihood that he would receive tenure: the vote was 10-5 in favor, which meant that five professors believed that Mr. Bradford had a low probability of doing so. The straw poll was not binding and did not involve the entire faculty. However, on Thursday August 25, Indiana State Representative Jeffrey Thompson spoke with Dr. Charles R. Bantz, Chancellor of Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis, during which Chancellor Bantz reportedly admitted that Bradford was eligible for tenure, had correctly applied for tenure, and that he had an <b>outstanding</b> <b>case</b> for tenure. In early September 2005, Thompson stated that Chancellor Bantz had ordered IU-Indy Law School to vote on tenure for Bradford.|$|E
50|$|The silos are cylindrical, {{barrel-shaped}} structures with {{an outer}} diameter between 2 and 4 m. The base is a podium, probably built {{to protect the}} cereals from rodents. It consists of several courses of bricks sealed inside with lime plaster. The silos demonstrate several universal principles guiding the construction of silos worldwide, past and present: 1. Rounded sides, giving the structure a cylindrical shape. This form better withstands the pressure exerted by the contents, which is distributed evenly onto {{the sides of the}} silo and does not create excessive stress at the base or the corners {{as is the case with}} a rectilinear shape. 2. Building of a number of silos near one another allows for greater ease of handling than one big installation. This facilitates separation of grain from different years or different crops. In the event of fire, humidity, rodent or insect infestation, some of the stored grain may be spared. 3. Organization of silos in adjacent rows facilitates their arrangement within a confined space. The stability of silo shape over considerable periods of time and large geographical regions provide an <b>outstanding</b> <b>case</b> in human architecture.|$|E
