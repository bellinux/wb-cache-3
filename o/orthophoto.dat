40|$|The {{popularity}} of using UAV in image-taking {{for the production}} of 3 D models and <b>orthophotos</b> has increased over time. Karlskoga Municipality has recently acquired an UAV to produce their own 3 D models and <b>orthophotos.</b> This project paper aims to study the geospatial accuracy of the <b>orthophotos</b> and DEM files produced using the images taken with their UAV. The flight takes only a few minutes but a considerable time is spent in the production processes. Difficulty is experienced in determining the right center point for most GCPs. Produced <b>orthophotos</b> in the software Photoscan have a resolution from 1. 7 to 2. 4 centimeters while DEM files have a resolution from 3. 4 to 4. 8 centimeters. Four <b>orthophotos</b> and four DEM files are produced where GCPs are used and not used and at two different flight heights, 76 and 105 meters. The spatial data of the ten GCPs are identified on the <b>orthophotos</b> and DEM files in ArcMap and compared with GNSS NRTK measurements and Lantmäteriet's data. A visual control in terms of completeness of data, alignment, residual tilt and scale is also done. Standard deviations in plane for <b>orthophotos</b> there GCPs are not used are greater than 2 meters, while there GCPs are used are around 0. 7 meters. Standard deviations for DEM files are observed at 0. 8 meters...|$|R

40|$|Along {{with the}} modern {{technological}} developments, also the individual branches of land surveying as a profession are developing. The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) is in land surveying already one of the established sources of acquiring spatial data. In this thesis, we analyzed the data obtained with two different unmanned aerial vehicles recording the same area on the same day. We evaluated {{the quality of the}} both types of the <b>orthophotos</b> that were made from these recordings, as well as the quality of the digital surface models (DSM) that were used for the production of the <b>orthophotos.</b> We found out that the increasing of the number of ground control points (GCP) improves the positional accuracy or the <b>orthophotos.</b> We also evaluated some of the effects {{on the quality of the}} <b>orthophotos</b> and the quality of the digital surface model. We found out that the image spatial resolution has a very greate impact on the quality of the <b>orthophotos</b> and the quality of the digital surface model.

40|$|Active {{landslides}} {{have three}} major effects on landscapes: (1) land cover change, (2) topographical change, and (3) above ground biomass change. Data derived from multi-temporal Light Detection and Ranging technology (LiDAR) {{are used in}} combination with multi-temporal <b>orthophotos</b> to quantify these changes between 2006 and 2012, caused by an active deep-seated landslide {{near the village of}} Doren in Austria. Land-cover is classified by applying membership-based classification and contextual improvements based on the synergy of <b>orthophotos</b> and LiDAR-based elevation data. Topographical change is calculated by differencing of LiDAR derived digital terrain models. The above ground biomass is quantified by applying a local-maximum algorithm for tree top detection, in combination with allometric equations. The land cover classification accuracies were improved from 65 % (using only LiDAR) and 76 % (using only <b>orthophotos)</b> to 90 % (using data synergy) for 2006. A similar increase from respectively 64 % and 75 % to 91 % was established for 2012. The increased accuracies demonstrate the effectiveness of using data synergy of LiDAR and <b>orthophotos</b> using object-based image analysis to quantify landscape changes, caused by an active landslide. The method has great potential to be transferred to larger areas for use in landscape change analyses...|$|R
40|$|In many {{occasions}} <b>orthophotos</b> {{in the background}} of GIS applications enrich their presentation. Often they serve for data capturing. Geometrically such images posses a defined, homogeneous geometry. One produces <b>orthophotos</b> since several decades with ever increasing demands and performance in quality and quantity. However, large-scale city <b>orthophotos</b> using standard algorithms and procedures typically have following problems: (a) Displacements and occlusions make it difficult to superimpose vector data for checking and change detection purposes; (b) The orthorectification of the image is partly geometrically inaccurate and/or incomplete (i. e., buildings are distorted from their true location as they are not modelled in the DTM). By using Digital Surface Models (DSM) and considering occluded areas it is possible to generate True-Orthophotos which do not have above mentioned problems. In this article the aspects on the generation of True-Orthophotos will be discussed. Different methods and economical aspects to build up the DSM for the True-Orthophoto production will be mentioned. 1...|$|R

40|$|Semi–natural {{areas are}} {{characterized}} by cultivated and natural areas with continuous transition zones. Especially in the alpine regions, this type of land-cover is predominant. The paper presents a method to classify semi –natural alpine areas by combining the spatial detail of <b>orthophotos</b> with the spectral information of SPOT satellite images. As case study, an alpine region in South Tyrol (Italy) has been considered. A four step approach is applied: (1) object delimitation, (2) object information assignment, (3) data mining and (4) classification. First, a segmentation procedure on <b>orthophotos</b> is used for an accurate delimitation of spatial objects, namely the segment. In a second step, spectral information from SPOT data as well as textural information from <b>orthophotos</b> are assigned to the segments. In a third step, those information are inserted in a data mining procedure, reducing {{the information to the}} most relevant ones for the next step based on classification. The classification procedure is mainly based on a decision tree approach. The main aim {{of this study was to}} compare the results from standard pixel vs. object-based classification approach by combining and considering different attributes (spectral, textures, topography) with decision tree approach and by comparing two classification approaches (maximum likelihood, decision tree). The study shows the potential of mapping semi–natural areas by combining high geometric detail (<b>orthophotos)</b> with spectral information of satellites images (SPOT). 1...|$|R

5000|$|Orthophotographs are {{commonly}} used in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) as a [...] "map accurate" [...] background image. An orthorectified image differs from [...] "rubber sheeted" [...] rectifications as the latter may accurately locate a number of points on each image but [...] "stretch" [...] the area between so scale may not be uniform across the image. A digital elevation model (DEM) is required to create an accurate <b>orthophoto</b> as distortions in the image due to the varying distance between the camera/sensor and different points on the ground need to be corrected.
