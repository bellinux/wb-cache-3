5|$|As a high {{altitude}} species with limited contact with humans until the development <b>of</b> <b>mountain</b> tourism activities, the Alpine chough has little cultural significance. It was, however, featured together with its wild mountain habitat in Olivier Messiaen’s Catalogue d'oiseaux ("Bird catalogue"), a piano piece written in 1956–58. Le chocard des alpes ("The Alpine Chough") is the opening piece of Book 1 of the work.|$|E
5|$|Goat Rocks {{obtained}} {{its name}} from a population <b>of</b> <b>mountain</b> goats that can be observed around the mountain. Other fauna include marmots and pikas at high elevations. Deer and elk can be found below the timberline, including mule deer, mule deer-black-tailed hybrids, Roosevelt elk, and Rocky Mountain elk that were introduced from Yellowstone National Park in 1913. Black-tailed deer are especially common.|$|E

5|$|Wolves {{supplement}} their diet with {{fruit and vegetable}} matter. They willingly eat the berries <b>of</b> <b>mountain</b> ash, lily of the valley, bilberries, blueberries and cowberry. Other fruits include nightshade, apples and pears. They readily visit melon fields during the summer months. A well-fed wolf stores fat under the skin, around the heart, intestines, kidneys, and bone marrow, particularly during the autumn and winter.|$|E
5|$|A barrier jet in the {{low levels}} forms just {{upstream}} <b>of</b> <b>mountain</b> chains, with the mountains forcing the jet to be oriented parallel to the mountains. The mountain barrier increases {{the strength of the}} low level wind by 45 percent. In the North American Great Plains a southerly low-level jet helps fuel overnight thunderstorm activity during the warm season, normally in the form of mesoscale convective systems which form during the overnight hours. A similar phenomenon develops across Australia, which pulls moisture poleward from the Coral Sea towards cut-off lows which form mainly across southwestern portions of the continent.|$|E

5|$|Ben Nevis's popularity, {{climate and}} complex {{topography}} {{contribute to a}} high number <b>of</b> <b>mountain</b> rescue incidents. In 1999, for example, there were 41 rescues and four fatalities on the mountain. Some accidents arise over difficulties in navigating to or from the summit, especially in poor visibility. The problem {{stems from the fact}} that the summit plateau is roughly kidney-shaped and surrounded by cliffs on three sides; the danger is particularly accentuated when the main path is obscured by snow. Two precise compass bearings taken in succession are necessary to navigate from the summit cairn to the west flank, from where a descent can be made on the Pony Track in relative safety.|$|E
5|$|In {{recognition}} of the established and popular activity <b>of</b> <b>mountain</b> biking in the greater Adelaide area, and to better accommodate the mountain biking community in the north eastern suburbs, it was proposed in 2006 to permit cycling in designated zones on purpose-built tracks and on certain management tracks within the park. The intention is to satisfy both biodiversity and recreation objectives {{in the park and}} reducing the incidence of illegal mountain bike riding in other non designated areas.|$|E
5|$|Many beetle species {{undertake}} annual mass movements {{which are}} termed as migrations. These include the pollen beetle Meligethes aeneus and {{many species of}} coccinellids. These mass movements may also be opportunistic, in search of food, rather than seasonal. A 2008 study of an unusually large outbreak <b>of</b> <b>Mountain</b> Pine Beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) in British Columbia found that beetles were capable of flying 30–110km per day in densities of up to 18, 600 beetles per hectare.|$|E
