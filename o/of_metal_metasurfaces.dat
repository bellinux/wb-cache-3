30|$|Split ring {{resonator}} (SRR) {{is a common}} plasmonic metasurface element because of its inductance-capacitance resonance nature that allows its flexibility in tuning optical properties. Similarly, other dielectric metasurfaces also employ the SRR as the basic metasurface unit due to its capacity for tunability and fabrication [21, 22]. Other element shapes such as “Z-slots” on silicon films have also been designed as polarization splitters [23]. However, the <b>metal</b> <b>metasurfaces</b> have high ohmic losses and low transmittance that lower their efficiency of light manipulation [24, 25].|$|R
30|$|Recently, graphene-based Fano {{resonance}} metasurfaces {{have been}} successfully proposed for light manipulating devices such as modulators [10 – 13], absorbers [14, 15], slow-light devices [16, 17], and cloaks [16, 18], as well as others. In these devices, radiative losses were mitigated {{as a result of}} strong interaction between the monolayer graphene and the confined electric field in resonant gaps. Graphene offers remarkable properties including tunable optical conductivity and high carrier mobility. This enables it to support high-Q resonant structures with suppressed radiative losses [19, 20]. On the other hand, <b>metal</b> <b>metasurfaces</b> utilize subwavelength elements to enhance electric field confinement and create abrupt changes in phase, amplitude, and polarization of the impinging light.|$|R

The damage <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> rubber which is accumulated with its inner partial broken and wore wires, results in deterioration of its macro-mechanical characteristic, macro-cracking and final fatigue failure, so it does not rupture as sudden failure of solid material. It is difficult to describe damage evolution <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> rubber in the microscopic perspective, and from a macro point of view, it is feasible method to describe degree of fatigue damage which bases on the changes of mechanical properties.

30|$|The {{accumulation}} <b>of</b> <b>metals</b> in the earthworm tissues {{might be}} the reason for reduction of leachable concentration <b>of</b> <b>metals</b> during vermicomposting <b>of</b> S. natans. Similar results were also reported by Jain et al. (2004) and Singh and Kalamdhad (2013). The evidence of cutaneous absorption <b>of</b> <b>metals</b> by earthworms was reported by Suthar (2009). The leachability <b>of</b> <b>metals</b> might have also reduced due to increase in pH and complexity <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> humic substances. An increase in the pH of vermicompost resulted in an increase of surface negative charge, which increased cationic adsorption, formation <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> hydroxyl species that have a greater affinity for adsorption sites than the metal cations, and precipitation <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> as metal hydroxides (Maity et al. 2008). Another reason for the reduction <b>of</b> leachable <b>metal</b> concentration during vermicomposting was the affinity <b>of</b> the <b>metals</b> with the functional groups –OH or –COO– of humic substances of the vermicompost (Kang et al. 2011). The threshold limits for heavy metal contamination are 20  mg/kg for Cd, 100  mg/kg for Cr and 100  mg/kg for Pb (US EPA method 1311, 1992).
