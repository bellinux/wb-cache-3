A picture <b>of</b> <b>Einstein</b> also appears {{on the wall of}} Dr. Pryor's office. At one point Homer erroneously refers to Einstein as the inventor of the light bulb. Dr. Pryor compares Bart's proposed work among ordinary children to Jane Goodall's study of chimpanzees. Goodall was pleased to be mentioned in the episode, sending the program a letter, and Vitti an autographed copy of her book. The conductor of the opera the family attends is named Boris Csupowski, {{a reference to}} animator Gabor Csupo. The opera attended by the family is Carmen, by French composer Georges Bizet; the song that Bart mocks is a famous aria called the Toreador Song. Students at the gifted school have lunchboxes that feature images of the 1945 novel Brideshead Revisited and chess grandmaster Anatoly Karpov.|$|E

25|$|These {{thoughts}} <b>of</b> <b>Einstein</b> {{would set}} off a line of research into hidden variable theories, such as the Bohm interpretation, {{in an attempt to}} complete the edifice of quantum theory. If quantum mechanics can be made complete in Einstein's sense, it cannot be done locally; this fact was demonstrated by John Stewart Bell with the formulation of Bell's inequality in 1964.|$|E
25|$|This {{idea was}} {{elaborated}} by Hermann Minkowski, who {{used it to}} restate the Maxwell equations in four dimensions, showing directly their invariance under the Lorentz transformation. He further reformulated in four dimensions the then-recent theory of special relativity <b>of</b> <b>Einstein.</b> From this he concluded that time and space should be treated equally, and so arose his concept of events taking place in a unified four-dimensional spacetime continuum.|$|E
25|$|The EPR paradox {{refers to}} a famous thought {{experiment}} <b>of</b> <b>Einstein,</b> Podolski and Rosen that was realized experimentally {{for the first time}} by Alain Aspect in 1981 and 1982 in the Aspect experiment. In this experiment, the measurement of the state of one of the quantum systems of an entangled pair apparently instantaneously forces the other system (which may be distant) to be measured in the complementary state. However, no information can be transmitted this way; the answer {{to whether or not the}} measurement actually affects the other quantum system comes down to which interpretation of quantum mechanics one subscribes to.|$|E

25|$|When the 23-year-old Albert Einstein {{started the}} Olympia Academy study group in 1902, {{with his two}} younger friends, Maurice Solovine and Conrad Habicht, his first reading {{suggestion}} was Pearson's The Grammar of Science. This book covered several themes that were later {{to become part of}} the theories <b>of</b> <b>Einstein</b> and other scientists. Pearson asserted that the laws of nature are relative to the perceptive ability of the observer. Irreversibility of natural processes, he claimed, is a purely relative conception. An observer who travels at the exact velocity of light would see an eternal now, or an absence of motion. He speculated that an observer who travelled faster than light would see time reversal, similar to a cinema film being run backwards. Pearson also discussed antimatter, the fourth dimension, and wrinkles in time.|$|E
25|$|A {{little more}} than a year before his death, Minkowski {{introduced}} his geometric interpretation of spacetime to the public on November 5, 1907 in a lecture to the Göttingen Mathematical society with the title, The Relativity Principle (Das Relativitätsprinzip). In the original version of this lecture, Minkowski continued to use such obsolescent terms as the ether, but the posthumous publication in 1915 of this lecture in the Annals of Physics (Annalen der Physik) was edited by Sommerfeld to remove this term. Sommerfeld also edited the published form of this lecture to revise Minkowski's judgement <b>of</b> <b>Einstein</b> from being a mere clarifier of the principle of relativity, to being its chief expositor. On December 21, 1907, Minkowski spoke again to the Göttingen scientific society, and on September 21, 1908, Minkowski presented his famous talk, Space and Time (Raum und Zeit), to the German Society of Scientists and Physicians.|$|E
25|$|According {{to general}} relativity, {{gravitational}} radiation is generated {{in situations where}} the curvature of spacetime is oscillating, such {{as is the case}} with co-orbiting objects. The gravitational radiation emitted by the Solar System is far too small to measure. However, gravitational radiation has been indirectly observed as an energy loss over time in binary pulsar systems such as PSR B1913+16. It is believed that neutron star mergers and black hole formation may create detectable amounts of gravitational radiation. Gravitational radiation observatories such as the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) have been created to study the problem. In February 2016, the Advanced LIGO team announced that they had detected gravitational waves from a black hole collision. On 14 September 2015, LIGO registered gravitational waves for the first time, as a result of the collision of two black holes 1.3 billion light-years from Earth. This observation confirms the theoretical predictions <b>of</b> <b>Einstein</b> and others that such waves exist. The event confirms that binary black holes exist. It also opens the way for practical observation and understanding of the nature of gravity and events in the Universe including the Big Bang and what happened after it.|$|E

500|$|In {{a series}} of works {{completed}} from 1911 to 1913, Planck reformulated his 1900 quantum theory and introduced the idea of zero-point energy in his [...] "second quantum theory".

Assuming the energy of rotating diatomic molecules contains zero-point energy, they then compared the theoretical specific heat of hydrogen gas with the experimental data. The numbers matched nicely.
