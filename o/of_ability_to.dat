5|$|Midazolam, marketed {{under the}} trade name Versed, among others, is a {{medication}} used for anesthesia, procedural sedation, trouble sleeping, and severe agitation.

When given intravenously, it typically begins working within five minutes; when injected into a muscle, it can take fifteen minutes to begin working. Effects last for between one and six hours.|$|E

25|$|Early in {{her career}} she {{recognized}} that negative symptoms and associated cognitive impairments had more debilitating effects than psychotic symptoms, like delusions and hallucinations. While psychotic symptoms represent an exaggeration of normal brain/mind functions, negative symptoms represent a loss of normal functions, for example, alogia the loss <b>of</b> the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> think and speak fluently, affective blunting the loss <b>of</b> the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> express emotions, avolition, loss <b>of</b> the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> initiate goal-directed activity, and anhedonia, loss <b>of</b> the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> experience emotions. The papers describing these concepts have become citation classics, {{as determined by the}} Science Citation Index produced by the Institute for Scientific Information.|$|R

25|$|While air {{pollution}} hotspots affect {{a variety of}} populations, some groups {{are more likely to}} be located in hotspots. Previous studies have shown disparities in exposure to pollution by race and/or income. Hazardous land uses (toxic storage and disposal facilities, manufacturing facilities, major roadways) tend to be located where property values and income levels are low. Low socioeconomic status can be a proxy for other kinds of social vulnerability, including race, a lack <b>of</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> influence regulation and a lack <b>of</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> move to neighborhoods with less environmental pollution. These communities bear a disproportionate burden of environmental pollution and are more likely to face health risks such as cancer or asthma.|$|E

25|$|The Lockheed F-104A had {{originally}} been scheduled to replace the North American F-100 Super Sabres of the Tactical Air Command beginning in 1956. However, {{by the time that}} the F-104A was finally ready for delivery, Air Force requirements had changed. The Starfighter's relatively low endurance and its lack <b>of</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> carry a significant offensive weapons load made it no longer suitable for TAC. Consequently, the TAC lost all interest in the F-104A even before it was scheduled to enter service.|$|E
25|$|Leprosy, {{also known}} as Hansen's disease (HD), is a {{long-term}} infection by the bacterium Mycobacterium leprae or Mycobacterium lepromatosis. Initially, infections are without symptoms and typically remain this way for 5 to 20 years. Symptoms that develop include granulomas of the nerves, respiratory tract, skin, and eyes. This {{may result in a}} lack <b>of</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> feel pain, thus loss of parts of extremities due to repeated injuries or infection due to unnoticed wounds. Weakness and poor eyesight may also be present.|$|E

People most commonly get pets for companionship, to protect a home or property, or because of the beauty or attractiveness of the animals. The most common reasons for not owning a pet are lack of time, lack of suitable housing, and lack <b>of</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> care for the pet when traveling.|$|E

25|$|Disruption in self-identity, {{relationships}} with others, and emotional well-being {{can lead to}} social consequences after stroke {{due to the lack}} <b>of</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> communicate. Many people who experience communication impairments after a stroke find it more difficult to cope with the social issues rather than physical impairments. Broader aspects of care must address the emotional impact speech impairment has on those who experience difficulties with speech after a stroke. Those who experience a stroke are at risk of paralysis which could result in a self disturbed body image which may also lead to other social issues.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have shown}} that {{congenital}} amusia is a deficit in fine-grained pitch discrimination and that 4% of the population suffers from this disorder. Acquired amusia, on the other hand, may take several forms. Patients with brain damage may experience the loss <b>of</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> produce musical sounds while sparing speech, much like aphasics lose speech selectively but can sometimes still sing. Other forms of amusia may affect specific sub-processes of music processing. Current research has demonstrated dissociations between rhythm, melody, and emotional processing of music, and amusia may include impairment of any combination of these skill sets.|$|E
25|$|Early in his career, {{under the}} {{instruction}} of his first stablemaster, Konishiki was primarily oshi-sumo specialist, preferring pushing and thrusting techniques such as oshi-dashi and tsuki-dashi that would win the bout as quickly as possible. Following his knee problems in 1988 and 1989, his balance suffered and as his weight continued to increase he began to change his style, preferring to bide his time by grabbing the opponent's mawashi and rely on his huge weight advantage to wear them out. By 1992 he was winning virtually all his matches by yori-kiri (force out), and his lack <b>of</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> change tack once he had been sidestepped {{was one of the}} concerns raised by the Yokozuna Deliberation Committee when he was up for promotion.|$|E
