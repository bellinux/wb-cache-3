40|$|Apstract: The aim of {{this study}} was the anthropological {{analysis}} of seven individuals from Late Roman period which were excavated in necropolis in Šid.

To get a complete antropological picture of buried individuals, detailed descriptions of individual skeletal remains for each grave were given. The description comprehended: preservation and completeness of skeletal remains, sex and age estimation, stature estimation, paleopathological finds, nonmetric skeletal traits and skeletal markers of occupational stress. Dental analysis showed presence of caries, attrition, and periodontal disorders. A careful observation of skeletal remains demonstrated that these deceased suffered of joint diseases and hematological disorders. In consideration of all these real existences these people buried here, were health and led a quiet and wealthy life...|$|R
