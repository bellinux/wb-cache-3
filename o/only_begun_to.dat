5|$|Along {{with the}} rest of the Yugoslav Army, the 1st Cavalry Division began mobilising on 3 April 1941, and was still engaged in that process three days later when the Germans began an air {{campaign}} and a series of preliminary operations against the Yugoslav frontiers. By the end of the following day, the division's cavalry brigade headquarters and all of the division's cavalry regiments had been detached for duty with other formations of the 1st Army Group. The divisional headquarters and divisional-level units remained in the vicinity of Zagreb until 10 April, when they were given orders to establish a defensive line southeast of Zagreb along the Sava river, with infantry and artillery support. The division had <b>only</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> deploy for this task when the German 14th Panzer Division captured Zagreb. The divisional headquarters and all attached units were then disarmed by armed Croat fifth column groups, or surrendered to German troops.|$|E
5|$|In 1830 Honoré de Balzac had <b>only</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> achieve {{recognition}} as a writer. Although his parents had persuaded him to make his profession the law, he announced in 1819 {{that he wanted to}} become an author. His mother was distraught, but she and his father agreed to give him a small income, on the condition that he dedicate himself to writing, and deliver to them half of his gross income from any published work. After moving into a tiny room near the Bibliothèque de l'Arsenal in Paris, Balzac wrote for one year, without success. Frustrated, he moved back to his family in the suburb of Villeparisis and borrowed money from his parents to pursue his literary ambitions further. He spent the next several years writing simple potboiler novels, which he published under a variety of pseudonyms. He shared some of his income from these with his parents, but by 1828 he still owed them 50,000 francs.|$|E

25|$|Because of the {{relatively}} small area of cultivable hinterland and a treacherous harbour entrance, early hopes of Opotiki town becoming a major centre for the Bay of Plenty were dashed. During the twentieth century the town suffered from repeated shifts of businesses and local government to Whakatane, a situation which has <b>only</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> reverse very recently with increasing population. Major floods in the 1950s and 1960s led {{to the protection of}} the town by levees (‘stopbanks’) which have successfully prevented any further inundations. A major boost to prosperity occurred with the kiwifruit boom of the late twentieth century.|$|E

She was a valued 'special' member of the Gay and Lesbian Association of Doctors and Dentists (GLADD), and was instrumental in establishing the first National LGBT Health Summit at Cardiff in 2006. In 2007 the LGBT Health Summit established an LGBT Health Community Award in her name; there was some objection to this from within the transgender community, as she had twice written material which appeared to cast transsexuals in a bad light. The objections were noted and discussed, and the award continued to be established in her name.|$|E
25|$|In vertebrates, {{the nervous}} system can be split into two parts, {{the central nervous system}} (brain and spinal cord), and the {{peripheral}} nervous system. In many species — including all vertebrates — {{the nervous system}} is the most complex organ system in the body, with most of the complexity residing in the brain. The human brain alone contains around one hundred billion neurons and one hundred trillion synapses; it consists of thousands of distinguishable substructures, connected to each other in synaptic networks whose intricacies have <b>only</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> be unraveled. The majority of the approximately 20,000–25,000 genes belonging to the human genome are expressed specifically in the brain. Due to the plasticity of the human brain, the structure of its synapses and their resulting functions change throughout life. Thus the challenge of making sense of all this complexity is formidable.|$|E
25|$|Further {{research}} should be conducted in order to fill the gaps in entomotoxicology. Such areas as bioaccumulation, insect metabolism of drugs, and quantitative analyses of insect evidence have <b>only</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> be researched. Because it {{is a relatively new}} branch of forensic entomology, entomotoxicology has its limitations. According to Pounder’s research, there is no correlation between the drug concentration in tissue and the larvae feeding on that tissue. Entomological specimens make for excellent qualitative toxicological specimens. There is, however, a lack of research in the way of developing an assessment that can quantify the concentration of a drug in tissue using entomological evidence. One {{reason for this is that}} a drug can only be detected in larvae when the rate of absorption exceeds the rate of elimination. demonstrated this theory using Calliphora vicina larvae reared on human skeletal muscle obtained from cases of co-proxamol and amitriptyline overdose. Samples of pupae and third instar larvae no longer contained concentrations of the drugs, suggesting that drugs do not bioaccumulate over the entire life-cycle of larvae. This leads entomologists to theorize that toxins are eliminated from the larvae’s system over time if they are not receiving a constant supply of the toxin.|$|E

500|$|Historian Edward Hasted, in {{the third}} volume of The History and Topographical Survey of the County of Kent {{published}} in 1798, dismissed {{the legend of the}} Biddenden Maids. He claimed that the Bread and Cheese Lands were the gift of two women named Preston (although he elsewhere described the lands as having been [...] "given by persons unknown"). Hasted stated that the Biddenden cakes had <b>only</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> be moulded with the imprint of two women in the last 50 years (i.e. since 1748) and that the figures were intended to represent [...] "two poor widows, as the general objects of a charitable benefaction".

500|$|Most of the caldera's eruptive {{products}} have been heavily eroded by alpine glaciers {{and are now}} exposed in precipitous slopes extending from near sea level to elevations less than [...] The bulk of the complex {{appears to have been}} erupted between 100,000 and 500,000 years ago, but postglacial andesitic and basaltic andesite cones and lava flows are also present. Anomalously old potassium-argon dates of 1,000,000 and 1,100,000 years were obtained from a large lava flow at least [...] long in the postglacial Pashleth Creek and Machmell River valleys. This blocky lava flow is clearly much younger than the potassium-argon date, and high-energy glacial streams have <b>only</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> etch a channel along the margin of the lava flow. The younger andesitic rocks issued from a cluster of vents, now mostly ice-covered, ranged around the periphery of the caldera. At high elevations, proximal breccia and cinders from several eroded cones rest on coarse colluvium derived from the older parts of the volcanic complex. The presence of unconsolidated glacial fluvial deposits under the flow suggest that it is less than 1,000 years old.|$|E

I filmed a lot of audition tapes in front of a white wall at home. I've paid my dues for years." [...] Bukstein also stated that she had previously sent in an audition tape to the series when it was first casting its first season, saying, [...] "A few years ago, when they had <b>only</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> cast the first season of Game of Thrones, I sent an audition tape. I didn't really know for which role, and I mainly didn't know—and neither did the world—what a hit the series was about to become.

500|$|Auxiliary Units were a {{specially}} trained and secret organisation that [...] {{would act as}} uniformed commandos to attack the flanks and rear of an enemy advance. They were organised around a core of regular army 'scout sections', supported by patrols [...] of 6 - 8 men recruited [...] from the Home Guard. Although [...] approval for the organisation had been given in June 1940, recruiting only began in early July. Each patrol was a self-contained cell, expected to be self-sufficient. There was, however, no means of communicating with them once {{they had gone to}} ground, which greatly reduced their strategic value. Each patrol was well-equipped and was provided with a concealed underground operational base, usually built in woodland and camouflaged. [...] Auxiliary Units were only expected to operate during an organised military campaign, with an expected lifespan of 14 days. [...] They were not, therefore, intended to operate as a long term resistance organisation. [...] The latter was the responsibility of the Secret Intelligence Service Section VII, which would have <b>only</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> expand its operations once the country had actually been occupied, thus confining knowledge of its existence only to those men and women who would have been available at the time.|$|E
