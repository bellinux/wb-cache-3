40|$|The article {{examines}} whether social stratification in Poland follows {{the conceptual framework}} developed by theorists of the mar-ket transition in post-communist countries re-garding returns to human capital and merits related to <b>occupational</b> <b>achievements.</b> This analysis extends an earlier study by using na-tional surveys spanning from 1982 to 2008. Data analyses support hypotheses that mar-ket-like reforms changes the mode of allocat-ing rewards in favour of greater incentives to meritocracy and individual attainments. The direct link between education, income and po-sition had been monitored. Key words: meritocracy, social strati-fication, human capital, <b>occupational</b> <b>achievements,</b> individual attainments, educa-tion, income, position. In what follows I analyze trends in mechanisms of income stratification {{in the course of}} the Polish market transition. The relationship between incomes, and education and occupational position in market econo-mies is well-known. Functional theory of stra-tification explains that relatively high grada-tion in incomes by level of educational in-vestments and occupational positions is ne-cessary to provide incentives for individual effort (Duncan, 1961; Treiman, 1970). Basing on this assumption, close association between rewards and individual productivity, as re-flected in education and occupational posi-tion, is among indicators of economic effec-tiveness, modernization and meritocracy. By extending this logic to reforming post-communist economy analysts of social stratification attempt to explain and anticipate path taken by the market transition in former state communist countries in Europe, and Asia.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between French and British women's domestic circumstances, their employment patterns and their <b>occupational</b> <b>achievement</b> {{is the subject}} of this thesis. Using secondary analysis of large nationally representative survey data, the Labour Force Survey 1984 and the Enquete Emploi 1985, case studies of two contrasted occupations, office working and teaching, are developed. The work is based on the premise that an examination of women's employment needs to take into account the different historical and structural aspects of particular occupations, as well as the socio-cultural context which gives rise to particular policies. This combination of social, cultural, structural and policy elements is referred to as the 'occupational situation'. The analyses show that the effects of domestic circumstances vary in each occupation. Yet, in a country such as France where day care is widely available, and in occupations whose structure is likely to minimise the effect of domestic responsibilities, the effect of marriage and children on employment patterns and <b>occupational</b> <b>achievement</b> persists. An added finding relates to the effect of part-time working on occupational achievement: in French office working, part- time working does not significantly decrease chances of <b>occupational</b> <b>achievement.</b> This indicates the importance of French employment protection legislation, particularly that which allows for continuity of employment during the period of family formation and which protects part-time working. Yet, although such policies can affect employment patterns, they may not have a marked effect on <b>occupational</b> <b>achievement.</b> Policy and structural elements of particular occupations can lessen the effect of domestic circumstances on employment patterns and <b>occupational</b> <b>achievement.</b> However, the unequal relations of power between women and men in the home and in the workplace act as a constant variable in each of these case studies, and inequalities persist between women and men in employment...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} inequalities in the Uruguayan education-to-work {{transition}} {{at the light}} of new technological determinants: the skills needed for critical and autonomous use of Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) or e-skills. While important cumulative experience exists regarding the increasing diversification of formal education and labor market pathways and its serious consequences for the process of Uruguay’s social inequality reproduction, none of them relates {{to the role of}} ICTs. The central hypothesis presented here argues that even after controlling the factors traditionally associated with unequal pathways, such as social class, gender, cognitive skills, educational attainment and labor history, there is an additional explanatory component of ICT on occupational attainment at the first stages of education-to-work-transitions. With this objective in mind, nested logistic models were fitted, using a longitudinal survey with a representative panel of a sub-sample of the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) tests. Findings tend to corroborate the hypothesis, showing a statistically significant effect of digital skills attained until the age of 15 / 16 on white collar <b>occupational</b> <b>achievements</b> at the age of 19 / 20.

40|$|The {{past three}} decades have been a period of {{exceptional}} change for women. The face of the professions and much of middle management in Scotland is increasingly female. The gender profile of politics has changed significantly. But the face of poverty is also {{most likely to be}} a woman's face while the top jobs are still predominantly male. These changes have been accompanied by demographic developments with significant implications for Scottish society. It is a tempting story to present the positive developments in women's role as the product of feminist activism. That activism has played a part but we need to look to the structural changes in the economy for the primary causal factors. Economic change presented new opportunities in the labour market. Women grasped them and employers used them. But these opportunities also presented a new set of dilemmas for men and women that are unlikely to be resolved positively without substantial intervention in the labour market. The challenge for Scotland is to continue the progress in women's educational and <b>occupational</b> <b>achievements</b> while creating the conditions for population renewal and also tackling the two extremes of under-representation in the top jobs and over-representation {{in some of the most}} poorly paid.

Holland is studied using causal modeling procedures. The lack of explicitness in the developmental postulates of Holland's theory is seen as a major deficiency. Among the principal postulates of the theory is that most persons can be characterized by their resemblance to each of six personality types (realistic, investigative, artistic, social, enterprising, and conventional). A recent study using a biographical questionnaire d monstrates wide variations in the life histories {{of men and women in}} the six vocational types. Subjects for this study were obtained from respondents to the 1971 Cooperative Institutional Research Programs survey (completed on entering college in 1971) which obtained a broad array of personal information. Subjects also completed a follow-up survey in 1980 that gathered data on college experiences and educational and <b>occupational</b> <b>achievements</b> in the 9 -year period. Findings support Holand's general premise that vocational type development is a function of a complex series of events resulting from family backgrounds, initial personal orientations and occupational preferences, and interactions with alternative environmental settings.

40|$|Singapore is {{a country}} {{dependent}} on professional and skilled immigrants to sustain its growing economy. To add to its economic challenges, Singapore's population is ageing and birth rate declining. Though Singapore is able to attract professional immigrants, it becomes important {{to ensure that they}} are retained too, especially in their next generation. In light of this scenario, this study investigates the educational and occupational aspirations of the first generation Indian immigrants in Singapore for their children studying at the pre-university level. It also examines the factors influencing these aspirations and the role of their acculturation process in shaping these aspirations. The study is mainly qualitative in nature and employs the case study approach. Each case comprises of the first generation Indian immigrant parents’ pair whose children are studying at the pre-university level in Singapore. A postal questionnaire was administered to gather the background information of the parents and the children in order to recruit suitable participants for the subsequent qualitative phase. Twelve parents’ pairs were selected as the twelve cases. Data was collected through semi-structured interviews with both the parents and group interviews with the children. The parents had high aspirations for their children’s educational and <b>occupational</b> <b>achievements.</b> Their emphasis was on quality education, academic excellence, professional success and financial security. Parents expected their children to match their level of educational and <b>occupational</b> <b>achievements.</b> They also wished to see inter-generation occupation mobility. Parents’ aspirations were influenced by factors at the individual, familial and societal level. At the individual level, it was their desire to enhance their children’s educational opportunities, personal values and perception of affordability of educational expenses. At the familial level their parents and children were found to be influential. Their parents’ role was seen through the family culture they were brought up into and their childhood experiences. Their children’s role was influential through the gender and the self-identity of the child. Also, the role of the birth order of the child stood out as parents’ experiences with their older child, expectations with the older child and the level of success the older child had achieved shaped parents’ aspirations for their younger child. At the societal level, the living environment of India and Singapore {{played a significant role in}} shaping their aspirations. In particular, it was the socio-cultural, physical, legal, economic and educational environments of both countries. Institutional discrimination too had a role in shaping parents’ aspirations as preference was given to Singaporeans in educational and occupational opportunities. The role of acculturation was evidently seen in shaping parents’ aspirations for their children. When parents migrated, they brought along their personal characteristics and experiences with them. In Singapore, parents were exposed to a new environment which was different from that in India, in many ways. Some of their characteristics underwent a change in the new environment while others remained intact depending on their acculturation strategy which was observed to be integration or separation. The influence of this acculturation process was seen on their parents’ aspirations for their children...|$|E
40|$|Background: Attention deficit {{hyperactivity}} disorder (ADHD) {{is one of the}} most commonly diagnosed neurodevelopmental disorders in the youth population, with a prevalence of 6 - 12 % in North America. The disease negatively impacts academic and social functioning in childhood, as well as <b>occupational</b> <b>achievements</b> in adulthood. The etiology is highly multifactorial and embraces genetics, prenatal exposures to tobacco smoke and alcohol, and postnatal factors such as parenting style. Objective: To examine the association between maternal stress during pregnancy and the development of ADHD in school-aged children. Methodology: A systematic review was completed to investigate the relationship between maternal stress and ADHD symptomatology in offspring by using PubMed, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Library databases. Both quantitative and qualitative publications within the past twenty years were searched using keywords such as maternal stress, pregnancy, ADHD, behavioural disorder, and risk factor. The articles were screened for extraneous variables such as maternal age at conception to minimize biases. Results: Epidemiological studies have indicated an association between maternal stress and behavioural disturbances in offspring, persisting until the ages of four and six. The “excess glucocorticoid” theory suggests that severe maternal stress saturates the enzyme 11 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type II responsible for deactivating cortisol in the placenta during pregnancy, allowing excess hormone to reach the fetus. Conclusion: Determining preventable risk factors early in life leads to new strategies and treatment options to reduce diagnostics of the disease, improve the quality of life of children at risk, and dramatically reduce health care costs.

The main objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the course of childhood-onset epilepsy during a period of 15 years. Generally, medication is withdrawn after a 2 -year remission. Here, subjects with a fast response to medication were randomized for 6 - or 12 month treatment. Four years later, we found no difference in recurrence rate, terminal remission, or adverse events between both groups. Unnecessary treatment was prevented for > 1 year, but after recurrences renewed medication sometimes failed. We cannot recommend early withdrawal in all fast responders. At last contact, a 5 -year terminal remission was reached by 71 % of the cohort and 9 % was intractable. Course during follow-up was favorable in 50 %, improving in 29 %, and poor or deteriorating in 16 %. Duration of seizure activity was 12 years in another 25 %. Antiepileptic drugs were used by 86 %. Mortality was significantly higher only in the remote symptomatic group. The idiopathic and cryptogenic etiology groups resembled their Dutch age-peers in having a partner/ offspring and in employment status, but the educational and <b>occupational</b> <b>achievements</b> of the idiopathic group were lower than expected. This might be due to their epilepsy, or to an assumed common cause for the epilepsy and other brain dysfunctions.

The {{purpose of the}} research is to better understand how integration occurs {{for the children of}} Haitian immigrants as they transition from adolescence to adulthood. Building upon a prior study of second-generation immigrant adolescents between 1995 and 2000, a sub-set of the original participants was located to participate in this follow-up research. Qualitative interviews were conducted as well as in-depth ethnographic research, including participant observation. Survey instruments used with other second-generation populations were also administered, enabling comparisons with the Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Study (CILS). The results indicate that educational and <b>occupational</b> <b>achievements</b> were markedly below the participants’ original expectations as adolescents. Gender figures prominently in participants’ familial roles and relationships, with men and women distinctly incorporating both Haitian and American cultural practices within their households. Contrary to previous research, these results on the identification of participants suggest that these young adults claim attachment to both Haiti and to the United States. The unique longitudinal and ethnographic nature of this study contributes to the ongoing discussion of the integration of the children of immigrants by demonstrating significant variation from the prior integration trends observed with Haitian adolescents. The results cast doubt on existing theory on the children of immigrants for explaining the trajectory of Haitian-American integration patterns. Specifically, this research indicates that Haitians are not downwardly mobile and integrating as African Americans. They have higher education and economic standing than their parents and are continuing their education well into their thirties. The respondents have multiple identities in which they increasingly express identification with Haiti, but in some contexts are also developing racialized identifications with African Americans and others of the African diaspora. ...|$|E

A village for youth to live, learn and work with guided autonomy and responsibility might be a possible social tool to augment their transition into adulthood. Similar to a youth centre, there are communities that are in need for facilities that can help adolescents who come from low socioeconomic families. However in some circumstances, the bare provision of youth centres is not enough to attract the youth of the community to voluntarily partake in activities. Therefore, a common interest has to be identified as the driving force. This project will take on the architectural characteristics of the village structure and the applied chosen programmes. They will act as a catalyst that will attract and assist the development of the youth. There are generally three stages during adolescent development; early, middle and late adolescence. The stages involve physical, cognitive and social-emotional development. It is important for this project to be aware of these developing parts. Therefore, the village must offer a healthy environment for the social-emotional development of the youth. The village must offer programmes that cater to the physical and cognitive areas of their development. The study hopes to produce a youth environment that allows youth to develop into mature adults with self-confidence, ambition and willing to take on responsibilities to prepare them for the future.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the {{occupational}} progress and earnings attainment of immigrants in Germany {{over time and}} compare them to native Germans. Our analysis is guided by the human capital and segmented labor market theories. To assess the separate effects of occupational segmentation and discrimination in the allocation of occupations and wages we conceptualize the process of earnings attainment as occurring in three stages: initial <b>occupational</b> <b>achievement,</b> final <b>occupational</b> <b>achievement</b> after the accumulation of experience, and contingent on the former, final earnings attainment. Using data from the German Socioeconomic Panel, our results indicate {{a high degree of}} initial occupational segmentation, with immigrants being less able to translate their human capital into a good first job and being channeled into first occupations of significantly lower status than natives. We also developed evidence to suggest that immigrants experienced significant discrimination in the process of occupational attainment, yielding little job mobility over time, and widening the status gap between Germans and guestworkers. Holding occupational status constant, however, we found less evidence of direct discrimination in the process of earnings attainment. Although immigrants achieved lower rates of return to technical or vocational training than natives, their wage returns to experience, hours worked, years since migration, and academic high school were greater, yielding significant earnings mobility over time...|$|R
40|$|Although {{women have}} {{increased}} their labour market participation and educational level they still lag behind men in their <b>occupational</b> <b>achievements.</b> An important discussion in the literature {{as well as in}} popular media is whether this is due to a gender difference in aspirations. In this study the importance of aspirations for work outcomes is studied in more detail in four empirical chapters using a variety of methods. Results showed that there were gender differences in work and family aspirations that followed traditional gender roles. In general, women thought that family aspirations were more important than men while men thought that career aspirations were more important than women. However, this study showed that women did not lose their ambition when having children. Furthermore, there were also gender differences in how these aspirations related to work outcomes. More specifically, when family aspirations were related to work outcomes, family aspirations were positively related to men’s work outcomes but negatively related to women’s work outcomes. Moreover, work aspirations seemed to matter more for the work outcomes of women than of men. Thus, similar aspirations did not always lead to similar outcomes for men and women. This dissertation also investigated the direction of the relationship between aspirations and earnings. Results showed that work aspirations affected earnings rather than the only way around, but this relationship was only found for women. For men there was no evidence for a relationship in either direction using longitudinal data. Finally, the importance of the aspirations of the partner were investigated. It was found that the aspirations of the partner could function as a resource or a restriction. Where partners seemed to stimulate each other’s aspirations, it also appeared to be the case that the aspirations of the partner could limit or stimulate one’s own labour market participation. Together, this dissertation has investigated several aspects of the relationship between aspirations and work outcomes. It contributed to previous research by explicitly including family aspirations when investigating the relationship between aspirations and work outcomes, by investigating the direction of the relationship between aspirations and earnings, and by combining insights from various research fields. This study has implications for policy makers, employers, and employees. For policy makers it is important to realise that the same aspirations for men and women do not always lead to the same outcomes. Women do not lose their career aspirations when they have a child. Hence, employers should give mothers the chance to realize their ambitions. Finally, it is good for women to realize that their work aspirations do have an effect and that if they hold on to their aspiration they may increase the chance of achieving their desired work outcomes...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{prevalence}} of overweight and obesity has increased {{during the last}} decades in many countries, and current prevalence data are alarming and give reason for serious health concerns in the future. However, our knowledge on the determinants of overweight and obesity in childhood and adolescence are limited, and more information is needed on the contribution of early development, social background, children’s diet and physical activity. The {{aim of this study}} was to identify if there where any differences in diet, leisure time and physical activity between a group of normal weight and a group of over weight/ obese adolescents in the age of 10 – 17 years old, and the following hypothesis was set: diet and physical activity has an effect on overweight and obesity among children and adolescents. It was conducted a data analysis and a systematic literature search to enlighten the subject. The secondary aim of the study was to compare different kinds of referencesystems based on BMI and detect if, and if so, why a system based on waist circumference, could be used as an alternative to reference systems based on BMI. Methods: The current research was conducted at different schools in Delitzsch, Germany during the spring 2010. It was a cross-sectional study in about 300 children and adolescents with detailed assessment of anthropometry, questionnaires on early development, social background, diet and physical activity of children aged 10 - 17 years old. Early development was assessed by questionnaires to the mothers and included data on pregnancy and delivery, infant feeding and weight development during the first year of life. Parents were also asked on their BMI, education and <b>occupational</b> <b>achievements.</b> Dietary data focused on intake of sweets, fast food, fruit and vegetables and drinking habits. Results: The main finding was that there where only small, and mostly non- differences in the consumption of foods and beverages and physical activity between children with overweight/ obesity, and children with normal weight. The secondary finding was that the reference system based on waist circumference classified fewer children as obese than the system based on BMI. Conclusion: Only small differences were found in food and beverage consumption between the overweight/ obese and the normal weight children. Possible causes could be the cross sectional nature of this study, which make it difficult to make any definite statements on the 6 causes or causal directions. Cross sectional studies alone are not suitable to define obesity among children. Several longitudinal studies on the area are necessary to determine cause and effect. To get an indication on central obesity which is associated with health risks, waist circumference should be considered as a reference system for the measure of overweight/ obesity in children and adolescents...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} the first {{in-depth}} exploration of ethnic identity and belonging among second-generation Sri Lankans in Australia. The scholarly contribution of this thesis lies in the originality of its subject matter, the identity formation of second-generation Sri Lankans, including those from three ancestry groups Sinhalese, Tamils and Burghers. Based on 30 in-depth semi-structured interviews and diaries and drawing on the theoretical framework of social constructionism, I analyse the intricate social processes behind the identity construction of second-generation Sri Lankans in the contemporary, multicultural Australian social context. The thesis provides new knowledge on how structural integration and ethnicity intersect in the multicultural Australian social landscape. As I will demonstrate, {{the lives of the}} children of middle-class Sri Lankans are characterised by subtle struggles of simultaneous inclusion and exclusion because of the interplay between socioeconomic affluence and racial discrimination. Assimilation theorists have argued that the salience of ethnic identity would decrease as immigrants became middle-class, English educated and integrated into mainstream professional occupations. On the contrary, I show that despite their middle-class background and high socioeconomic assimilation within the mainstream society, ethnic identities retain resonance in the identity narratives of second-generation Sri Lankans in Australia. I found that the second-generation Sri Lankans construct their ethnic culture with reference to their heritage culture, mainly through constructing and reconstructing the symbols of family, ‘ethnic’ values and food. They accomplished this while at the same time, upholding a self-defined Australian identity. I found that the participants articulate their national identity mainly though language, shared interests and claiming an emotional belonging to the Australian nation-state. However, one of the most noteworthy findings of this study on the ethnic identity of second-generation Sri Lankans is that they adopted strong Australian national identities by maintaining, rather than relinquishing, their ethnic culture and transnational ties. This study also elaborates the continuing salience of racialisation and how contemporary racism operates in Australian society despite years of multicultural policies and the wide prevalence of anti-discrimination legislation. It reveals that racialisation remains crucial in shaping the identities of second-generation Sri Lankans, regardless of having similar educational and <b>occupational</b> <b>achievements</b> to middle-class whites. Yet, and at the same time, I found that without becoming passive receptors of external ascriptions these second-generation Sri Lankan Australians exercise considerable agency in actively negotiating the racial and ethnic constraints they encounter in their daily life. As a whole, this study suggests that ethnic identity construction is a dynamic, complex, contradictory and selective process, which involves negotiation, creation and transformation of an array of demands, expectations and influences from both migrant cultures and host cultures that ultimately lead to the construction of new forms of ethnic and national identification...|$|E

40|$|This {{study of}} {{immigrant}} <b>occupational</b> <b>achievement</b> was directed towards developing {{a better understanding}} of those factors that account for differential <b>occupational</b> <b>achievement</b> among the members of three different recent immigrant population groups. Attention was focused on the labor market experience of Korean, Soviet Jewish, and Vietnamese males, aged 20 - 69, who arrived in the Philadelphia Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA) between January 1, 1975 and December 31, 1977. ^ A nonprobability sample of 120 respondents, with 40 subjects from each population cited above, was selected. In January 1982 the researcher began to collect information from the respondents regarding their labor market experiences through personal interviews. The results of these interviews were recorded in field notes and on a structured questionnaire. The interviews were completed in August 1982. ^ Null hypotheses were developed {{on the basis of the}} immigrants 2 ̆ 7 sociocultural capital, migration orientation and job information sources. These factors were represented by the immigrants 2 ̆ 7 (1) fathers 2 ̆ 7 occupational status, (2) formal education, (3) size of place of residence, (4) chance of return-migration, (5) age at immigration, (6) religion, (7) first occupational status following immigration, (8) formal education following immigration, (9) English and vocational training, (10) English language ability, (11) length of residence in the United States, and (12) job information source occupational status. Regression analysis was performed for each of the immigrant groups to test the significance of each of these hypotheses. ^ The findings indicated that immigrant <b>occupational</b> <b>achievement</b> is an outcome of a process whereby groups convert their sociocultural capital into labor market positions in the receiving society. This process, itself, is conditioned by the job information sources to which groups have access and by the extent to which the groups are able to add to the sociocultural capital which they bring into the receiving community. Social resources was the sole factor shown to be consistently important across the three groups studied. Family members, friends and other personal contacts were important sources of material assistance, financial aid and information. Without such help, the immigrants would not have been able to achieve their attained levels of occupational status and mobility. ...|$|R
