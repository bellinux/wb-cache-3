40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} historical and theological context <b>of</b> the <b>means</b> <b>of</b> grace in the theology of John Wesley {{with the aim of}} identifying its central role in his soteriology. Examining the <b>means</b> <b>of</b> grace in its historical context requires locating the emergence <b>of</b> the <b>means</b> <b>of</b> grace in the English theological lexicon prior to Wesley and tracing Wesley's own inheritance of that tradition. The task <b>of</b> placing the <b>means</b> <b>of</b> grace within the context of Wesley's broader theological framework involves explaining how the <b>means</b> <b>of</b> grace, as disciplined practices engaged within the community of faith, {{lie at the heart of}} his soteriology as it finds expression in the Christian life. It is argued that the best way to conceive <b>of</b> the <b>means</b> <b>of</b> grace in Wesley's theology is as the "sacramental grammar" of his thought, grounded in the Wesleyan idea of social holiness, which names both the communal arena in which the <b>means</b> <b>of</b> grace are practiced and the salvific reality experienced by those joined together in such practice. Chapter 1 introduces the topic and explains the thesis. It describes the plan and scope of the dissertation, which is to locate John Wesley's doctrine <b>of</b> the <b>means</b> <b>of</b> grace in its historical and theological context. It lays out the approach, method, and sources for the project with reference to major scholarly texts that are engaged as well as the primary source material utilized. The chapter concludes by noting that, in addition to elucidating aspects of John Wesley's understanding <b>of</b> the <b>means</b> <b>of</b> grace not present in scholarship up to this point, it also intends to serve as a way to bring discipline to the use of Wesleyan language for the <b>means</b> <b>of</b> grace in contemporary Wesleyan scholarship. Chapter 2 - "The History <b>of</b> the <b>Means</b> <b>of</b> Grace: 16 th and 17 th Centuries" - analyzes the emergence of the language <b>of</b> the <b>means</b> <b>of</b> grace in the Church of England after the period of the Reformation. The chapter argues that the concept <b>of</b> the <b>means</b> <b>of</b> grace emerged as a way to describe the way God can be experienced through activities of devotion and worship, specifically after the loss of the full Roman Catholic sacramental system. It traces the particular use <b>of</b> the <b>means</b> <b>of</b> grace in Puritan practical divinity and examines its inclusion in the Book of Common Prayer. The chapter concludes with a study of John Norris' use of "means of grace" as an example of doctrinal development at the beginning of the 18 th century. Chapter 3 - "The Reception and Development <b>of</b> the <b>Means</b> <b>of</b> Grace in John Wesley" - demonstrates Wesley's reception <b>of</b> the <b>means</b> <b>of</b> grace during the period of Oxford Methodism. It then goes on to trace Wesley's development <b>of</b> the <b>means</b> <b>of</b> grace specifically in relation to the influences of mysticism and Moravianism. The period it covers is from 1731 to 1746, at which time, it is argued, Wesley's doctrine <b>of</b> the <b>means</b> <b>of</b> grace had reached a level of maturity as embodied in his publication of the sermon, "The <b>Means</b> <b>of</b> Grace. " Chapter 4 - "The Content <b>of</b> the <b>Means</b> <b>of</b> Grace in John Wesley's Theology" - analyzes the <b>means</b> <b>of</b> grace in Wesley's theology with respect to two main considerations: the nature of grace and the nature <b>of</b> the <b>means</b> themselves as "practices. " It also examines Wesley's categories <b>of</b> instituted <b>means,</b> prudential means, and general <b>means,</b> noting aspects <b>of</b> Wesley's distinctive understanding of each category. Chapter 5 - "The Character and Context <b>of</b> the <b>Means</b> <b>of</b> Grace" - brings the preceding work of the dissertation into a consideration of the nature of salvation in Wesley, specifically in relation to Wesley's understanding of present salvation as the recovery of holiness of heart and life. It then argues that Wesley's doctrine <b>of</b> the <b>means</b> <b>of</b> grace is best characterized through an intersection of the notion of "social holiness" as the environmental context in which the <b>means</b> <b>of</b> grace are practiced and holiness becomes manifest in the Christian community. Conclusion - The dissertation ends with a conclusion that summarizes the preceding chapters and underscores the significance of social holiness in understanding the context <b>of</b> the <b>means</b> <b>of</b> grace in Wesley's theology and practice of ministry.

40|$|AbstractOn {{the base}} of {{laboratory}} experiments the nonlinear wave transformation above submerged rectangular permeable and solid bars was investigated. A transmission coefficient and a change <b>of</b> <b>mean</b> wave period as parameters of wave transformation were considered. Both of these parameters can characterize an ability of submerged structure to reduce a wave impact in coastal zone. It was revealed that for decreasing <b>of</b> <b>mean</b> wave period solid submerged bar is more effective, but permeable bar is more effective for decreasing of wave height. The optimal relations for transmission coefficient and change <b>of</b> <b>mean</b> wave period in dependence of parameters of bar and waves were revealed. For decreasing <b>of</b> wave <b>mean</b> period the optimal length of solid bar must be 0. 4 of initial wavelength and 0. 1 - for permeable bar. For decreasing of wave height the length of bar for permeable bar must be 0. 21 of initial wavelength and for solid bar - 0. 55. It was revealed that maximal decreasing <b>of</b> <b>mean</b> wave period will be at relative depth of bar 1. 25 independently of permeability of bar. The optimal relation between transmission coefficient and changes <b>of</b> <b>mean</b> wave period depends on wave steepness...|$|R
