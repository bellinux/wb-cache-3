5|$|In orbit, the Enterprise {{crew and}} Jameson beam {{down into the}} tunnels beneath Karnas' manor, but find that their arrival was {{anticipated}} and face off against armed guards. Jameson collapses during the fight, and the crew beams back to the Enterprise, where they discover Jameson was not shot but instead the reverse aging drug is destroying his body. Karnas demands to see Jameson or he will kill a hostage every 15 minutes. Picard opts to beam himself, Dr. Crusher (Gates McFadden), Jameson, and eventually Jameson's wife Anne directly to Karnas' office. Though Karnas initially refuses {{to believe that the}} young man is Jameson, Picard shows him the images of his reverse aging <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> after which Jameson reveals a scar on his wrist inflicted by Karnas years ago. Karnas prepares to fire on Jameson to get his revenge, but decides to get his revenge by watching Jameson suffer and die horribly from the drug instead. Jameson dies shortly afterward in his wife's embrace. Karnas agrees to let the hostages go, and to allow Jameson to be buried on Mordan IV at Anne's request.|$|E
5|$|The chicks {{take from}} 34 to 50 days to fledge, the period {{depending}} on the abundance of their food supply. In years of fish shortage, the whole colony may experience a longer fledgling period but the normal range is 38 to 44 days, by which time chicks will have reached about 75% of their mature body weight. The chick may come to the burrow entrance to defecate but does not usually emerge into the open and seems to have an aversion to light until it is nearly fully fledged. Although the supply of fish by the adults reduces <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> spent in the nest, the chick is not abandoned as happens in the Manx shearwater. On occasions, an adult has been observed provisioning a nest even after the chick has departed. During {{the last few days}} underground, the chick sheds its down and the juvenile plumage is revealed. Its relatively small beak and its legs and feet are a dark colour and it lacks the white facial patches of the adult. The chick finally leaves its nest at night, when the risk of predation is at its lowest. When the moment arrives, it emerges from the burrow, usually for the first time, and walks, runs and flaps its way to the sea. It cannot fly properly yet so descending a cliff is perilous; when it reaches the water it paddles out to sea, and may be three kilometres (two miles) away from the shore by daybreak. It does not congregate with others of its kind and will not return to land for two or three years.|$|E

500|$|On 23 December {{the water}} carrier [...] arrived at Sallum with 3,000 tons of water, while the monitor [...] brought another 200 tons. The water {{was taken to}} storage tanks at Fort Capuzzo. Efforts were made to stock 8 Field Supply Depot with seven days' supply of fuel and stores, and 500 rounds per gun of ammunition. The effort to do so {{proceeded}} satisfactorily despite Italian air raids and blinding sand storms. Last-minute {{efforts were made to}} rectify the 6th Division's remaining equipment shortages. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> before the battle, some 95 additional vehicles were obtained, of which 80 were assigned to hauling ammunition. A consignment of 11,500 sleeveless leather jerkins for protection against the cold and barbed wire were distributed, as were 350 sets of captured Italian wire cutters. The 17th Infantry Brigade finally received its 3-inch mortars but found them lacking their sights. An officer dashed back to Cairo to obtain these in time. Some 300 pairs of gloves and [...] of marking tape arrived with only hours to go. The gloves were distributed, but the tape did not reach the 16th Infantry Brigade in time, so rifle cleaning flannelette was torn into strips and used instead.|$|E
500|$|Around 3a.m., Col. Everett Peabody, {{commanding}} Brig. Gen. Benjamin Prentiss's 1st Brigade, sent {{a patrol}} of 250 infantry {{men from the}} 25th Missouri and the 12th Michigan out on reconnaissance patrol, convinced that the constant reports of Confederate contacts <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> meant {{there was a strong}} possibility of a large confederate force in the area. The patrol, under the command of Maj. James E. Powell, met fire from Confederates who then fled into the woods. A short time later, 5:15a.m., they encountered Confederate outposts manned by the 3rd Mississippi Battalion, and a spirited fight lasted about an hour. Arriving messengers and sounds of gunfire from the skirmish alerted the nearest Union troops, who formed battle line positions before the Confederates were able to reach them; however, the Union army command had not adequately prepared for an attack on their camps. [...] When Prentiss learned that Peabody had sent out a patrol without his authorization he was outraged and accused the Colonel of provoking a major engagement in violation of Grant's orders, but he soon realized he was facing an assault by an entire Confederate army and rushed to prepare his men for defense. By 9a.m. Union forces at Pittsburg Landing were either engaged or moving toward the front line. [...] Both Peabody and Powell were soon killed in the subsequent fighting.|$|E

Chiming in as well, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper also called to warn Karzai that he would face dire problems with the coalition countries involved in Afghanistan if he did not cooperate. The American, British, and French ambassadors to Afghanistan joined U.S. Senator Kerry and the U.N.'s Kai Eide in flanking Karzai as he made his announcement at the news conference. U.S. administration officials had also used President Obama's pending strategy review on Afghanistan as leverage on Karzai, indicating that they would not make a decision on adding troops until Karzai agreed to accept the election outcome.|$|E

2500|$|... – President George Bush {{strongly}} {{condemned the}} assassination, urging her killers {{to be brought}} to justice. Bush condemned the assassination as a [...] "cowardly act by murderous extremists," [...] and encouraged Pakistan to [...] "honor Benazir Bhutto's memory by continuing with the democratic process for which she so bravely gave her life." [...] Bush also offered some strong praise of Bhutto, noting that [...] "she knew that her return to Pakistan earlier this year put her life at risk. Yet she refused to let assassins to dictate the course of her country." [...] Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said, [...] "The brutal assassination of former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto is a tragic setback for the restoration of democracy in Pakistan. Her courageous return to Pakistan this year gave hope to all those concerned by efforts to extinguish rule of law there." [...] Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said, [...] "It is important, when faced with the violence and loss of innocent life <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>days,</b> that political leaders show a commitment to resolve but also restraint. Extremists must be brought to justice, but extremism must not undermine commitment to the rule of law, to human rights, and to democracy." [...] At another press briefing at around 13:00 EST on December 27, a State Department spokesman asserted that [...] "some kind of postponement or delay" [...] in Pakistan’s democratic process would be [...] "a victory" [...] for [...] "the extremists" [...] who were responsible for Benazir Bhutto's assassination. He also asserted that [...] "perhaps the best antidote to extremism is the continuation of the democratic process." [...] He called for a [...] "credible and transparent" [...] investigation of the attack, and alluded to the [...] "broad international outrage" [...] about the incident. He also said that Bush spoke with Musharraf at 13:15 EST. Ambassador to the United Nations Zalmay Khalilzad, while describing Bhutto as a “courageous figure”, said that “The world has much at stake in the success of Pakistan's democratic institutions. It's a great tragedy because she stood for moderation, for rule of law, for democracy in her country, and her death is a loss for the cause of moderation, democracy, and rule of law for Pakistan. She was clear-headed about the problems of her country, the challenges that she faced — even the security challenges she faced." [...] Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said in a statement,"We extend our sincere condolences to the Bhutto family and to the families of others who were killed and wounded in the attack. We condemn in the strongest terms possible this cowardly and murderous attack." ...|$|E
