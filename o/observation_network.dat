5|$|In 1938, the United States Weather Bureau began issuing {{tropical}} cyclone warnings as a collaborative <b>observation</b> <b>network</b> for cities along the U.S. coastline, and {{the season was}} defined between June 15 and November 15. In 1964, the season was extended to begin on June 1 and end on November 30, which remains the official length of the season. About 97% of all {{tropical cyclone}}s form within this time span, and activity usually peaks between August and October. After Tropical Storm Ana formed in May 2015, former American Meteorological Society president Marshall Shepherd used Twitter to question whether the season should begin earlier. James Franklin of the National Hurricane Center believed there was little advantage to changing {{it because of the}} rarity of off-season storms, noting that May storms only formed on average once every six years since the advent of satellite imagery. Franklin opined that the season could begin on May15 with little difficulty, coinciding with the beginning of the Pacific hurricane season, but an earlier start would be costlier and interfere with off-season work.|$|E

25|$|In 1654, Ferdinando II de Medici {{established}} the first weather observing network, {{that consisted of}} meteorological stations in Florence, Cutigliano, Vallombrosa, Bologna, Parma, Milan, Innsbruck, Osnabrück, Paris and Warsaw. The collected data were sent to Florence at regular time intervals. In 1832, an electromagnetic telegraph was created by Baron Schilling. The arrival of the electrical telegraph in 1837 afforded, for the first time, a practical method for quickly gathering surface weather observations from a wide area. This data {{could be used to}} produce maps {{of the state of the}} atmosphere for a region near the Earth's surface and to study how these states evolved through time. To make frequent weather forecasts based on these data required a reliable network of observations, but it was not until 1849 that the Smithsonian Institution began to establish an <b>observation</b> <b>network</b> across the United States under the leadership of Joseph Henry. Similar observation networks were established in Europe at this time. The Reverend William Clement Ley was key in understanding of cirrus clouds and early understandings of Jet Streams. Later after this Charles Kenneth Mackinnon Douglas known as 'CKM' Douglas read Ley's papers after his death and carried on the early study of weather systems.|$|E

The design of successful monitoring or <b>observation</b> <b>networks</b> that rely on citizen observers requires a careful balancing of the two primary user groups, namely data users and data contributors (i. e., citizen scientists).
