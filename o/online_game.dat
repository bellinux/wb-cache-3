5|$|When {{speaking}} about why an <b>online</b> <b>game</b> {{was chosen as}} {{the next step in the}} series, Fujisawa cited the intuitive character AI in Dragon Quest IV and party member communication in Dragon Quest VII. Solid ideas for an <b>online</b> <b>game</b> set within the Dragon Quest series were first suggested in 2005, when development was wrapping up on Dragon Quest VIII. It was initially worked on by a very small team, who worked together on the groundwork for some time. A core part of the initial plan was that the game would have a pre-planned ten-year lifespan with continual content updates. Once work had finished on Dragon Quest IX, Dragon Quest X took full priority. During these earlier phases, it was still undecided whether to make the game a mainline title, and there was even doubt as to whether it could be an MMORPG rather than just an online multiplayer game. These doubts, held by Saito, were assuaged by Fujisawa's confidence in the project. Despite this, Fujisawa was a novice at both developing and playing MMORPGs, putting him in stark contrast with other staff members such as Saito, Yoshida and second chief planner Takashi Anzai.|$|E

40|$|Massively Multiplayer <b>Online</b> <b>Games</b> (MMOGs) {{are popular}} worldwide. Especially in Korea, {{there were about}} 19 million gamers in 2006. Despite this wide popularity, some players have become seriously {{addicted}} to <b>online</b> <b>games,</b> causing a serious social problem. However, studies and/or trials to address game addiction problems have rarely been performed. In this paper, we investigate the relationships among interested parties in the game industry and propose a base model to explain them. From the base model, we expect that casual gamers increase until some point of time, but decline afterward. The growth rate of total revenue from <b>online</b> <b>games</b> is decreased due to a reduced number of casual gamers over time and a negative image of <b>online</b> <b>games.</b> To resolve game addiction problems, we analyzed a self regulation policy and a tax and rebate policy in the base model. Through {{the analysis of the}} policies, we found that a tax and rebate policy is preferable to a self regulation policy. Under the tax and rebate policy, the total revenue of <b>online</b> <b>games</b> increases contrary to the concern of game companies, the social image of <b>online</b> <b>games</b> is improved and the number of game addicts decreases...|$|R
