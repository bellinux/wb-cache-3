Our purpose is to determine the factors behind the crude <b>oil</b> <b>import</b> policy of Turkey and to measure their contribution to a well-organized import strategy. We implemented a principle component analysis to construct an <b>Oil</b> <b>Import</b> Vulnerability Index (OIVI) based on four factors, which are crude <b>oil</b> <b>import</b> dependency of primary energy consumption, crude <b>oil</b> <b>import</b> bill as a share of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), non-diversification of import sources, and share of oil in total energy import. The contribution of these factors to the OIVI is found to be approximately equal. While an overall deterioration in the OIVI has been observed during periods of increasing oil prices, better diversification of <b>oil</b> <b>import</b> sources has lead to significant improvements. We suggest Turkish policy-makers implement sound policies, emphasizing diversification of crude <b>oil</b> <b>import</b> sources and reduction of the share of crude oil in primary energy imports to increase energy supply security. This study has also demonstrated that it is possible to construct an index representing crude oil vulnerability caused by <b>import</b> dependency. <b>Oil</b> <b>import</b> policy Vulnerability index Turkey...|$|R

Göring assured Hitler that the 6th Army could be supplied by air, but {{this turned out to be}} infeasible. Hitler's refusal to allow a retreat led to the deaths of 200,000 German and Romanian soldiers; of the 91,000 men who surrendered in the city on 31 January 1943, only 6,000 survivors returned to Germany after the war. Soviet forces continued to push the invaders westward after the failed German offensive at the Battle of Kursk and by the end of 1943 the Germans had lost most of their territorial gains in the east.|$|E

Hence, this paper compares the effects of real oil price shock on TOT in both <b>oil</b> <b>importing</b> and exporting countries, using Panel Data technique and during 1980 - 2010. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, we applied the nonlinear approach in order to assess the asymmetric impact of the oil price shocks on TOT. The results show that the oil price shocks influenced the TOT in the <b>oil</b> exporting and <b>importing</b> countries, differently. So that, in oil exporting countries, positive (negative) oil price shocks have significantly positive (negative) effect on their TOT, while in <b>oil</b> <b>importing</b> countries, positive (negative) oil price shocks have significantly a negative (positive) effect on TOT. Furthermore, the findings reveal that in the oil exporting countries, the effect of negative oil price shocks on TOT is more than positive oil price shocks.
