40|$|In a {{multiuser}} system, several {{signals are}} transmitted simultaneously {{within the same}} frequency band. This can result in significant improvements both in spectral efficiency and system capacity. However, a detrimental effect of the shared transmissions (both in time and bandwidth), is that the signal received at the base station (BS) or access point (AP) suffers from cochannel interference (CCI) and inter-symbol interference (ISI). This situation presents challenges to receiver design. To combat the destructive nature of multipath fading, a receiver often employs multiple antennas to collect the faded superimposed versions of the transmitted signals. The multiple signals are combined and processed {{in such a way}} that the effects of CCI and ISI are minimized and the desired information is reliably recovered. The situation is even more challenging when the system is <b>operating</b> under <b>overload,</b> i. e. when there are fewer receive antennas than there are transmitted signals. Multiuser detection (MUD) is used to simultaneously estimate the information sent by the transmitters. To do this, the receiver exploits differences among the cochannel signals (through unique spatial signatures in this case). We consider a cochannel communication system where multiple transmitted signals arrive at a receiver (equipped with multiple receive antennas) after propagating through a Rayleigh fading channel. It is assumed that the receiver is <b>operating</b> in an <b>overloaded</b> scenario. For such systems, an optimum maximum a posterior probability (MAP) detector estimates the transmitted signal by maximizing the probability of correct decision. The MAP detector reduces to the maximum likelihood (ML) detector when all the transmitted signals are equiprobable. The computational complexity of both MAP and ML detectors increases exponentially with the number of transmitted signals and the channel memory. For large systems suffering severe CCI and ISI, this is clearly not a good choice for real-time implementation due to the associated computational expenses. The main factors that influence the complexity of MAP / ML detection are: (i) the number of transmitted signals (or equivalently the number of users sharing the system resources), (ii) modulation alphabet size, and (iii) length of the channel memory. On the other hand, linear detection approaches fail to offer acceptable performance while other nonlinear sub-optimum approaches incur high computational costs for reasonably improved system performance and exhibit an irreducible error-floor at medium to high signal to noise ratio (SNR) values. We develop receiver signal processing techniques for the frequency-flat fading channel (where all the multipaths of the transmitted signal arrive at the receiver within a symbol period). We develop an ant colony optimization (ACO) assisted soft iterative detection approach for binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) modulated signals which employs a simplified MAP criteria to extract the most probable signals from the search space. The structure of the receiver is such that it can continue <b>operating</b> under <b>overloaded</b> conditions. The technique achieves near maximum likelihood (ML) performance in critically loaded cases using much lower complexity. For the challenging case of overload it still offers performance close to ML at low to moderate SNR values. Second, an integrated framework comprising of ACO metaheuristic and a recursively defined ML search criteria is developed to handle multilevel modulations. The proposed receiver is capable of achieving near-ML performance for the considered system with significant savings in computational complexity. The receiver framework is independent of the system loading condition, and therefore it remains suitable for overloaded scenarios. Due to the branch and bound nature of the algorithm, an exact expression for the complexity cannot be determined. Instead, an upper bound on computational complexity is developed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Real-time stream {{processing}} {{is essential for}} many real-life stream-based applications. Systems designed to run such applications {{must be prepared to}} <b>operate</b> under <b>overloaded</b> conditions. Existing load shedding techniques are not suitable for processing data streams with stringent timing constraints because their tuple dropping policies may violate application deadlines in an uncontrolled way. To tackle this problem, we propose a Safe lOad Shedding Approach (SOSA) that aims to reduce the workload imposed on the system {{while at the same time}} preserve system timing constraints in this paper. By exploiting data stream semantics, SOSA categorizes {{stream processing}} into two different modes. This allows one to place provably lighter loads, under the (m, k) real-time scheduling model, on streams that operate in one particular mode. More importantly, we show that SOSA itself does not introduce any new timing failures. This property sets our work apart from other load shedding strategies for stream processing. To demonstrate the usefulness of SOSA, we introduce a concrete (m, k) scheduling algorithm called SOSA-DBP by combining SOSA with DBP, a well-known (m, k) scheduling algorithm. Probabilistic analysis and experimental results show that SOSA-DBP has significant performance gain over DBP. ...|$|R
40|$|Large-scale {{deployment}} of IEEE 802. 11 wireless LANs (WLANs) remains a significant challenge. Many access points (APs) must be deployed and interconnected without a-priori {{knowledge of the}} demand. We consider that the deployment should be iterative, as follows. At first, access points are deployed to achieve partial coverage. Then, usage statistics are collected while the network <b>operates.</b> <b>Overloaded</b> and under-utilized APs would be identified, giving the opportunity to relocate, add or remove APs. In this thesis, we propose extensions to the WLAN architecture that would make our vision of iterative deployment feasible. One line of work focuses on self-configuration, which deals with building a WLAN from APs deployed without planning, and coping with mismatches between offered load and available capacity. Self-configuration is considered at three levels. At the network level, we propose a new distribution system that forms a WLAN from a set of APs connected to different IP networks and supports AP auto-configuration, link-layer mobility, and sharing infrastructure between operators. At the inter-cell level, we design a load-balancing scheme for overlapping APs that increases the network throughput and reduces the cell delay by evenly distributing the load. We also suggest how to reduce the handoff time by early detection and fast active scanning. At the intra-cell level, we present a distributed admission control that protects cells against congestion by blocking stations whose MAC service time would be above a set threshold. Another line of work deals with self-deployment and investigates how the network can assist in improving its continuous deployment by identifying the reasons for low cell throughput. One reason may be poor radio conditions. A new performance figure, the Multi-Rate Performance Index, is introduced to measure the efficiency of radio channel usage. Our measurements show that it identifies cells affected by bad radio conditions. An additional reason may be limited performance of some AP models. We present a method to measure the upper bound of an AP’s throughput and its dependence on offered load and orientation. Another reason for low throughput may be excessive distance between users and APs. Accurate positioning of users in a WLAN would permit optimizing the location and number of APs. We analyze {{the limitations of the}} two most popular range estimation techniques when used in WLANs: received signal strength and time of arrival. We find that the latter could perform better but the technique is not feasible due to the low resolution of the frame timestamps in the WLAN cards.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Current {{clinical}} {{methods for}} monitoring fracture healing are often invasive and inaccurate. This paper evaluates {{the use of}} a pressure sensitive platform to improve monitoring. METHODS: Standardised 3 mm diaphyseal bone defects were created in the right tibia of 64 female sheep and stabilised with either a rigid monolateral external fixator or a more flexible variant. Over a nine week healing period gait parameters were measured using a pressure sensitive platform and interfragmentary movements at the fracture site were monitored. Frequency spectra were calculated for the ground reaction forces. The tibiae were tested biomechanically after sacrifice and callus sections were analysed histomorphometrically. FINDINGS: All animals unloaded the <b>operated</b> and <b>overloaded</b> the contralateral hindlimb. Callus mineralisation and stiffness, as well as limb loading increased during healing whilst interfragmentary movements were reduced. Larger interfragmentary movements resulted in a slower fracture healing rate as documented histologically and biomechanically. Frequency analysis showed upto 14 dB loss of power at frequencies associated with bone mechanotransduction at four weeks postoperatively, reducing to a 3 dB loss at nine weeks. INTERPRETATION: Gait analysis is a valuable tool for monitoring the course of fracture healing. Different fixation stiffnesses caused different initial interfragmentary movements leading to different healing rates. Ground reaction forces were strongly related to the course of callus mineralisation and thus directly reflected the recovery of stiffness at the fracture site. Reduced levels of loading frequencies that may affect bone healing persist to nine weeks postoperatively...|$|R

A technique is developed by which accelerated testing can be achieved without <b>operating</b> under <b>overload</b> conditions, saving time and cost without sacrificing validity. The development of programming by XY plotter is described, with a method of operating one XY plotter to programme the machine, monitor its own behaviour, and plot its own results in logical sequence. Commissioning trials are described and the generation of reproducible results in frictional behaviour and material durability is discussed. Teclmiques are developed to cross check the operation of the machine in retrospect, and retrospectively correct results in the event of malfunctions. Sensitivity errors in the measuring circuits are displayed between calibrations, whilst leaving the recorded results almost unaffected by error. Typical results of brake lining tests are used to demonstrate the range of performance parameters which can be studied by use of the machine. Successful test investigations completed on the machine are reported, including comments on behaviour of cast iron drums and discs. The machine shows that materials can repeat their complex friction/ temperature/speed/pressure relationships at a reproducibility of the order of +- 0. 003 u and +~ 0. 0002 in. thickness loss during wear tests. Discussion of practical and academic implications completes the report with recommendations for further work in both fields...|$|R
