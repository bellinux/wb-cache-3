40|$|Upon {{examination}} of eleven main buildings of power plants, analysis of defects and damages of building structures was performed. Thereafter, the damageability of principal bearing structures of main buildings of thermal plants was analyzed. It was identified that {{the fastest growing}} defects and damages were concentrated in the structures of <b>operating</b> <b>sites.</b> The research of the rate of development of the most frequent damages and defects {{made it possible to}} conclude that internal corrosion of the reinforcing steel was the most dangerous defect, as far as the reinforced concrete elements of <b>operating</b> <b>sites</b> were concerned. Methods of mathematical statistics were applied to identify the reinforcing steel development pattern inside reinforced concrete elements of floors of <b>operating</b> <b>sites.</b> It was identified that the probability of corrosion of reinforced concrete elements of <b>operating</b> <b>sites</b> was distributed in accordance with the demonstrative law. Based on these data, calculation of strength of reinforced concrete slabs and metal beams was performed in terms of their regular sections, given the natural loads and the realistic condition of structures. As a result, dependence between the bearing capacity reserve ratio and the corrosion development pattern was identified for reinforced concrete slabs and metal beams of <b>operating</b> <b>sites.</b> In order to analyze the sufficiency of the bearing capacity of building structures of <b>operating</b> <b>sites</b> in relation to their time in commission, equations were derived to identify the nature of dependence between the sufficiency of the bearing capacity of reinforced concrete slabs and metal beams of the <b>operating</b> <b>sites</b> and their time in commission...|$|R

40|$|In suboccipital {{craniectomy}} {{where the}} bone is not repositioned, {{there may be}} a significant cosmetic defect due to lack of skull bone in the suboccipital region. It may accompanied by sensory symptoms, including pain. To prevent any cosmetic defect and sensory symptoms we repositioned the bone chips at the craniectomy site in 42 suboccipital craniectomies before the closure of the scalp. At a mean follow-up of 22 months (range: 5 - 44 months), two patients complained of mild discomfort in the healed wound or of occasional local pain. One patient complained of mild itching at the site. In two patients, bone chips were accumulated at {{the lower part of the}} suboccipital craniectomy and failed to form a uniform bone cover at the <b>operated</b> <b>site.</b> In one patient, all bone chips were reabsorbed and there was no bone at the <b>operated</b> <b>site.</b> There was pseudomeningocele formation in one patient. In the rest of the cases there was satisfactory bone coverage at the <b>operated</b> <b>site,</b> both clinically and radiologically. The wound sites were aesthetically acceptable in 40 cases. Our study suggests that in the majority of cases where suboccipital craniotomy is not possible or not done, repositioning of the bone chips at the craniectomy site is associated with satisfactory aesthetic and functional outcome and formation of bone coverage at the <b>operated</b> <b>site...</b>|$|R

50|$|Remediation efforts require {{continuous}} {{collection and}} treatment of landfill gases and liquids. Potentially injurious gases rise from decomposing garbage and organic matter; while water, seeping from trash, mixes with toxic compounds and creates leachate. The gas collection system extracts gas from deep inside the landfill and burns it. In 2002, EPA installed micro-turbines which convert landfill gases into electricity for <b>operating</b> <b>site</b> systems. Environmentally friendly, the micro-turbines send their emissions towards the gas treatment system, destroying all contaminants. For landfill liquids, a series of wells and pipes captures leachate, directing it towards a leachate treatment plant. After the treatment, the liquids filter into the sanitary sewer.|$|E

The plan directed that USAREUR designate a lieutenant colonel as the warm-basing commander. The first commander was Lt. Col. John Moon for 2007-08 and second was Lt. Col. Tina Kracke for the winter of 2008-2009. The plan also directed a colonel be assigned as the commander to assume “full command authority” over all U.S. personnel operating on or from MKAF and the Novo Selo Training Area during rotations. The first colonel designee was Col. Peri A. Anest. The staff was assigned as necessary to accomplish the mission. On occasion USAREUR staff sections would surge additional personnel to JTF-East when required for a specific task or during a rotation.|$|E
50|$|The Manomet Mills are a {{historic}} textile mill complex {{on the north}} side of New Bedford, Massachusetts. They are located between Riverside Avenue and the Acushnet River, north of Manoment Street and the Whitman Mills. The complex consists of three Classical Revival brick buildings, built between 1903 and 1907. The main building, Mill No. 1, is a 54-bay three story structure that was built in 1903. It is attached to Mill No. 2 (1907), of similar size, by a single story brick structure. The third building is the Mill No. 2 Department Room (1907), a two story brick building that was originally connected to the other two via overhead bridges, now removed. The mill complex was the main <b>operating</b> <b>site</b> of the Manoment Mill Company, which produced cotton yarn until about 1928. The buildings were sold in that year to the Delaware Rayon Company, which went bankrupt in 1954. Mill No. 2 was then used by the Acushnet Process Company for the manufacture of golf balls, while Mill No. 1 continued to be used for rayon production, a chemically intensive and environmentally hazardous process.|$|E
50|$|In 2005, HS-5 {{provided}} two {{aircraft and}} 37 personnel {{to participate in}} the massive Hurricane Katrina relief effort. The Nightdippers logged more than 93.6 flight hours, rescued 41 people in distress and delivered 14,860 pounds of food and water to hurricane victims. Also that summer approximately thirty maintainers, aircrew, and pilots were deployed for six months to an Expanded Maritime Interdiction Operation (EMIO) <b>operating</b> <b>site.</b> The Nightdippers effectively executed the Navy’s EMIO mission operating as part of the maritime component fighting the Global War on Terrorism by deterring, delaying, and disrupting the movement of terrorists and terrorist-related materials at sea. The Nightdippers operated with United States Marine Corps Fleet Anti-Terrorism Security Team (FAST) companies and Mobile Security Squadron Seven (MSS-7), as well as with forces from various allied nations. From January to July 2009, HS-5 deployed in support of Operation ENDURING FREEDOM. Seven months later, HS-5 again deployed aboard Eisenhower and on the first night aboard launched the alert aircraft to conduct a long-range open ocean rescue in perilous weather conditions; the squadron also later recovered three survivors from an E-2C Hawkeye forced to ditch in the North Arabian Sea. In June 2012, HS-5 and CVW-7 deployed with Carrier Strike Group EIGHT (CSG-8) again aboard Eisenhower. Twelve days into the deployment, HS-5 successfully rescued a French Rafale pilot who ejected in the Mediterranean Sea and returned him to the French aircraft carrier, Charles de Gaulle. HS-5 returned home for two months before deploying again aboard Eisenhower until July 2013. Two months into that second deployment, HS-5 successfully rescued two American Naval Aviators who ejected from their F/A-18F in the Persian Gulf. While deployed the squadron’s homeport officially changed to NS Norfolk, VA in anticipation of the upcoming transition to the MH-60S Seahawk. On January 24, 2014, Helicopter Antisubmarine Squadron Five (HS-5) completed its transition to the MH-60S and was re-designated Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron Five (HSC-5) during a ceremony at Naval Station Norfolk.|$|E
