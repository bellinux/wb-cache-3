This is the most punctual work to devise an <b>operator’s</b> based <b>Inter</b> Cloud financial model for investigating shopper to-Cloud and Cloud-to-Cloud connections. While economic experiences in the middle of shoppers and Cloud suppliers are displayed as a numerous to-numerous arrangement, financial experiences among Clouds are demonstrated as a coalition diversion. To reinforce numerous to-numerous customer to-Cloud transactions, this work devises a novel association convention and a novel arrangement technique that is portrayed by both 1) Adaptive concession rate (ACR) and 2) Minimally sufficient concession (MSC). Scientific confirmations demonstrate that specialists receiving the ACR-MSC methodology arrange ideally {{on the grounds that they}} make least measures of concession. Via naturally controlling concession rates, observational results demonstrate that the ACR-MSC methodology is proficient in light of the fact that it accomplishes fundamentally higher utilities than the altered concession-rate time-subordinate procedure.

We describe how competition between roaming operators at the wholesale level is influenced by the adoption of traffic redirection techniques.

We propose a simple and effective regulatory price cap mechanism to restore efficiency in the wholesale market. When mobile operators cooperate within a cross border alliance, internal IOTs are set at cost and retail prices are lower. ...|$|R

It is suggested that home teams play an attack dominated style (Thomas et al., 2008) and therefore {{the aims of the}} present study are to examine the impact of the game location on positional profiles of a professional rugby union over a competitive season and also gain an insight into the implications for the coaching process.

40|$|This article {{grew out}} of recent work of Dykema, Figiel, Weiss, and Wodzicki (Commutator {{structure}} of <b>operator</b> ideals) which <b>inter</b> alia characterizes commutator ideals in terms of arithmetic means. In this paper we study ideals that are arithmetically mean (am) stable, am-closed, am-open, soft-edged and soft-complemented. We show {{that many of the}} ideals in the literature possess such properties. We apply these notions to prove that for all the ideals considered, the linear codimension of their commutator space (the “number of traces on the ideal”) is either 0, 1, or ∞. We identify the largest ideal which supports a unique nonsingular trace as the intersection of certain Lorentz ideals. An application to elementary operators is given. We study properties of arithmetic mean operations on ideals, e. g., we prove that the am-closure of a sum of ideals is the sum of their am-closures. We obtain cancellation properties for arithmetic means: for principal ideals, a necessary and sufficient condition for first order cancellations is the regularity of the generator; for second order cancellations, sufficient conditions are that the generator satisfies the exponential Δ 2 -condition or is regular. We construct an example where second order cancellation fails, thus settling an open question. We also consider cancellation properties for inclusions. And we find and use lattice properties of ideals associated with the existence of “gaps. ...|$|R
40|$|AIM: Chronic {{cerebrospinal}} {{venous insufficiency}} (CCSVI) is a syndrome described in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, characterized by stenosis {{of the main}} extracranial veins with hampered cerebral venous outflow. In the original description echo-colour Doppler demonstrated to be an ideal non invasive tool for screening CCSVI patients, but the reproducibility was not assessed. Aim {{of this study is}} to assess the variability coefficient between trained and in not trained echo-colour Doppler operators. METHODS: Thirty-six (36) subjects, matched for age and gender, were subset in 3 groups (group A, 12 healthy controls, HC; group B, 12 multiple sclerosis patients, MS; group C, 12 patients with other neurological disease, OND) underwent echo-colour Doppler screening for CCSVI according to an original protocol previously described. The inter observer variability rate was assessed by comparing respectively trained vs not trained operators, and trained vs trained operators, by using the same echo-colour Doppler equipment. In addition, by scanning 15 subjects after one month from the first session, intra observer coefficient was also assessed in trained <b>operator.</b> RESULTS: The <b>inter</b> observer variability rate between trained and not trained echo-colour Doppler operators, were not completely satisfactory (K coefficient 0. 47 95 % CI 0. 27 - 0. 68). To the contrary the inter observer agreement between trained operators was much more reliable (K coefficient 0. 80 95 % CI 0. 59 - 1. 01). Finally, the intra observer variability rate in trained operators was 0. 93, (95 % CI 0. 80 - 1. 06) confirming a highly satisfactory agreement.

40|$|To {{measure the}} {{scapulohumeral}} rhythm (SHR) in outpatient settings, the motion analysis protocol named ISEO (INAIL Shoulder and Elbow Outpatient protocol) was developed, based on inertial and magnetic sensors. To complete the sensor-to-segment calibration, ISEO requires {{the involvement of}} an operator for sensor placement and for positioning the patient’s arm in a predefined posture. Since this can affect the measure, this study aimed at quantifying ISEO intra- and inter-operator agreement. Forty subjects were considered, together with two operators, A and B. Three measurement sessions were completed for each subject: two by A and one by B. In each session, the humerus and scapula rotations were measured during sagittal and scapular plane elevation movements. ISEO intra- and <b>inter</b> <b>operator</b> agreement were assessed by computing, between sessions, the: (1) similarity of the scapulohumeral patterns through the Coefficient of Multiple Correlation (CMC 2), both considering and excluding the difference of the initial value of the scapula rotations between two sessions (inter-session offset); (2) 95 % Smallest Detectable Difference (SDD 95) in scapula range of motion. Results for CMC 2 showed that the intra- and inter-operator agreement is acceptable (median 0. 85, lower-whisker 0. 75) {{for most of the}} scapula rotations, independently from the movement and the inter-session offset. The only exception is the agreement for scapula protraction–retraction and for scapula medio-lateral rotation during abduction (inter-operator), which is acceptable only if the intersession offset is removed. SDD 95 values ranged from 4. 48 to 8. 68 for the inter-operator and between 4. 98 and 8. 58 for the intra-operator agreement. In conclusion, ISEO presents a high intra- and inter-operator agreement, particularly with the scapula inter-session offset removed...|$|R
40|$|Current {{communication}} landscape {{focuses on}} the integration of networks, where these networks exhibit heterogeneous characteristics. The motivation for such network integration arises {{the advent of the}} smart end-user devices and revolutionary advances in other network components, the telecommunication business models shift focus from network-centric to the user-centric paradigm. This further dictates that operators will find the profit windows in increasing the satisfied user pool, which intuitively may be translated into meeting the user requirements. The shift towards new paradigm gives birth to several major issues and suitability of the current bandwidth sharing algorithms is one of them. The research work for the new paradigm is confined to <b>inter</b> <b>operator</b> and intra operator levels only. The bandwidth allocation at last mile, i. e. at user-end is not widely addressed. There is a need for an optimal solution that considers user perceived Quality of Experience (QoE) in bandwidth allocation at user-end. An optimal solution of this problem will maximize user satisfaction and increase operator’s revenue. Adapting the economic components of the existing user satisfaction function will capture the user behaviour more realistically against multiple parameters. A user perceived QoE-based distributed decision making algorithm at network level will be deployed at base station and the interdependency would be captured. The characteristics of involved access technologies i. e. (WLAN, UMTS) will be confined to capacity and coverage only. MATLAB implementation is used to proof the concept. The performance gain of the proposed work was investigated by using various performance evaluation criteria, such as call blocking probability, operator’s revenue maximization and user satisfaction. The proposed optimum bandwidth allocation algorithm is compared with non-optimum bandwidth allocation algorithm in single radio interface as well as in heterogeneous environment. The obtained results show that optimum bandwidth allocation model maximizes user satisfaction and operator’s revenue and minimizes number of calls rejection...|$|R
40|$|This paper studies {{international}} roaming markets in Europe. The object {{of this paper}} is to conclude, why {{international roaming}} prices are very high. The main question is whether the prices are high because of collusion or because of some other reasons. I approach this question by modeling different factors that might raise prices. I use the following three articles in modeling: Shy (2001), Kultti and Leppämäki (2004) and Salsas and Koboldt (2003). Other important references of this paper are: Economides (1996) and Laffond and Tirole (2000). I also study if collusion can be equilibrium in international roaming markets and distinguish different factors that favor collusion. In addition I use the related industrial organization, access pricing and network economics theories in my analysis. In chapter four I discuss that self-sustaining collusion can work for MNOs in international roaming and is more consistent with reality than the fully competitive example. In addition, I distinguish many factors that favor collusion in international roaming markets. I also reason that a collusive strategy across and inside country borders can be equilibrium. On the other hand, I show that <b>inter</b> <b>operator</b> tariffs (IOTs) can be high in competitive markets yet because of imperfect traffic direction systems. Bulk discount are used aside with traffic direction. Modeling bulk discounts prevails that bulk discounts probably increase the usage of roaming services. It is not clear how they affect to prices. In addition I reason that consumer behavior and negotiations rules have features that mute competition and thus probably raise prices. Modeling alliances prevails that it is probable that alliances increase wholesale prices. This reflects to retail prices as well. In addition the prices that alliance MNOs apply are probable higher than what non alliance members apply. Even though international roaming markets have many features that might raise prices I come to the conclusion that mobile network operators are engaged in tacit collusion in Europe.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Mathematics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2004. This study {{revolves}} around operators defined by conditional expectations and operators generated by random measures. Studies of operators in function spaces defined by conditional expectations {{first appeared in}} the mid 1950 's by S-T. C. Moy [22] and S. Sidak [26]. N. Kalton studied them in the setting of Lp-spaces 0 < p < 1 in [15, 131 and in L 1 -spaces, [14], while W. Arveson [5] studied them in L 2 -spaces. Their averaging properties were studied by P. G. Dodds and C. B. Huijsmans and B. de Pagter in [7] and C. B. Huijsmans and B. de Pagter in [lo]. A. Lambert [17] studied their relationship with multiplication operators in C*-modules. It was shown by J. J. Grobler and B. de Pagter [8] that partial integral operators that were studied A. S. Kalitvin et a 1 in [2, 4, 3, 11, 121 and the special cases of kernel <b>operators</b> that were, <b>inter</b> alia, studied by A. R. Schep in [25] were special cases of conditional expectation operators. On the other hand, operators generated by random measures or pseudo-integral operators were studied by A. Sourour [28, 271 and L. W. Weis [29, 30], building on the studies of W. Arveson [5] and N. Kalton [14, 151, in the late 1970 's and early 1980 's. In this thesis we extend the work of J. J. Grobler and B. de Pagter [8] on Multiplication Conditional Expectation-representable (MCE-representable) operators. We also generalize the result of A. Sourour [27] and show that order continuous linear maps between ideals of almost everywhere finite measurable functions on u-finite measure spaces are MCE-representable. This fact enables us to easily deduce that sums and compositions of MCE-representable operators are again MCE-representable operators. We also show that operators generated by random measures are MCE-representable. The first chapter gathers the definitions and introduces notions and concepts that are used throughout. In particular, we introduce Riesz spaces and operators therein, Riesz and Boolean homomorphisms, conditional expectation operators, kernel and absolute T-kernel operators. In Chapter 2 we look at MCE-operators where we give a definition different from that given by J. J. Grobler and B. de Pagter in [8], but which we show to be equivalent. Chapter 3 involves random measures and operators generated by random measures. We solve the problem (positively) that was posed by A. Sourour in [28] about the relationship of the lattice properties of operators generated by random measures and the lattice properties of their generating random measures. We show that the total variation of a random signed measure representing an order bounded operator T, it being the difference of two random measures, is again a random measure and represents ITI. We also show that the set of all operators generated by a random measure is a band in the Riesz space of all order bounded operators. In Chapter 4 we investigate the relationship between operators generated by random measures and MCE-representable operators. It was shown by A. Sourour in [28, 271 that every order bounded order continuous linear operator acting between ideals of almost everywhere measurable functions is generated by a random measure, provided that the measure spaces involved are standard measure spaces. We prove an analogue of this theorem for the general case where the underlying measure spaces are a-finite. We also, in this general setting, prove that every order continuous linear operator is MCE-representable. This rather surprising result enables us to easily show that sums, products and compositions of MCE-representable operator are again MCE-representable. Key words: Riesz spaces, conditional expectations, multiplication conditional expectation-representable operators, random measures. Doctora...|$|R
