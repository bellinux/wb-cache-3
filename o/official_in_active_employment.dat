From a multi-method research methodology (538 questionnaires and 61 in-depth interviews of women prisoners throughout the country), this article discusses the categories and data used for intervention in prisons state of art,with powerful reflections for the specialized field of SocialEducation Penitentiary (ESP). The conclusions drawn in this area are based on some small successes of the prison systemas access and proliferation of software, or the presence of certain gender and socio-cultural programs. However, there remainmajor challengeswithin the recovering constitutional purposes awarded to custodial sentences, within our democratic framework.

40|$|INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Recurrent syncope has a {{significant}} impact on quality of life. The development of measurement scales to assess this impact that are easy to use in clinical settings is crucial. The objective of the present study is a preliminary validation of the Impact of Syncope on Quality of Life questionnaire for the Portuguese population. METHODS: The instrument underwent a process of translation, validation, analysis of cultural appropriateness and cognitive debriefing. A population of 39 patients with a history of recurrent syncope (> 1 year) who underwent tilt testing, aged 52. 1 ± 16. 4 years (21 - 83), 43. 5 % male, most <b>in</b> <b>active</b> <b>employment</b> (n= 18) or retired (n= 13), constituted a convenience sample. The resulting Portuguese version is similar to the original, with 12 items in a single aggregate score, and underwent statistical validation, with assessment of reliability, validity and stability over time. RESULTS: With regard to reliability, {{the internal consistency of the}} scale is 0. 9. Assessment of convergent and discriminant validity showed statistically significant results (p< 0. 01). Regarding stability over time, a test-retest of this instrument at six months after tilt testing with 22 patients of the sample who had not undergone any clinical intervention found no statistically significant changes in quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that this instrument is of value for assessing quality of life in patients with recurrent syncope in Portugal...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{literature}} reports that obese persons are discriminated in the workplace. Evidence suggests that obese people {{are perceived as}} having less leadership potential, and in comparison to normal weight peers, {{are expected to be}} less successful. This study examined whether obese people are discriminated against when applying for employment. Three hypotheses were offered in line with previous research: (1) obese people {{are less likely to be}} assessed positively on personnel suitability than normal weight people(2) obese people <b>in</b> <b>active</b> <b>employment</b> are more likely to be discriminated against than people in non-active employmentand (3) obese women are more likely to be discriminated against than obese men. 181 Participants were sampled from sedentary, standing, manual and heavy manual occupations. Participants rated hypothetical candidates on their suitability for employment. Employees also completed measures of implicit and explicit attitudes toward obesity. MANOVA was conducted to examine if obese candidates were discriminated against during the recruitment procedure. Results demonstrated that participants rated obese candidates as less suitable compared with normal weight candidates and when the weight status of the candidate was not revealed for work across the four workplace groups. Participant gender and weight status also impacted perceptions of candidates’ suitability for work and discrimination toward obese candidates was higher in participants from more physically demanding occupations. The study findings contribute to evidence that obese people are discriminated against in the hiring process and support calls for policy development...|$|R

If the secrets of our [...] "casebooks"--that is, we suppose, our medical dossiers, doctors' records of the condition of their patients--could be revealed, it would be shown that many clever people have a fancy skeleton in their cupboards. By a fancy skeleton we mean, not some dismal secret of crime or shame, but a melancholy and apprehensiveness without any ground in outward facts. With the real skeleton doctors have nothing to do. He rather belongs to the province of Scotland Yard. If a man has compromised himself in some way, if he has been found out by some scoundrel, if he is compelled to [...] "sing," [...] as the French say, or to pay [...] "blackmail," [...] then the doctor is not concerned in the business. A detective, a revolver, or a well-planned secret flight may be prescribed to the victim. Other real skeletons men possess which do not come of their own misdeeds. One of their friends or one of their family may be the skeleton, or the consciousness of coming and veritable misfortune, pecuniary or what-not. But the Medical Times, which no doubt ought to know, refers purely to cases of vague melancholy and hypochondriac foreboding. Apparently [...] "The Spleen," [...] the [...] "English Disease," [...] is as bad now as when Green wrote in verse and Dr. Cheyne in prose.

40|$|The European Employment Strategy (EES) and {{the process}} of Open Method of Coordination (OMC) have key roles in {{ensuring}} that the European Member States reach the Lisbon Targets by 2010. The EES promotes <b>active</b> <b>employment</b> policies, and this dissertation compares and analyses <b>active</b> <b>employment</b> policies <b>in</b> three welfare states; United Kingdom, Denmark and the Netherlands. The analysis focuses on whether or not <b>active</b> <b>employment</b> policies <b>in</b> the three countries have converged towards the recommendations of the EES. The impact of the EES and OMC is widely discussed, and some of the main problems concern whether OMC has the ‘power’ to change welfare states. A macro-oriented regime framework for analysing the characteristics of different employment regimes is developed, including a distinction between path-dependent and path-breaking changes. Based on these distinctions, a categorisation of the regimes according to the three possible combinations of categories of instruments is utilised when establishing the development <b>in</b> the countries’ <b>active</b> <b>employment</b> policies. The study reveals that the countries’ different historical and institutional legacies mostly influence developments in national employment policies prior to 1997, and, hence, that the countries’ policy-developments are relatively path-dependent. But in the period after the launch of EES (after 1998) the study reveals that cross-country tendencies and convergence have emerged, which cannot be explained by the national policy-paths. Features of <b>active</b> <b>employment</b> policies and the rhetorical understanding of problems and solutions regarding unemployment have, to a varying extent, converged within the United Kingdom, Denmark and the Netherlands...|$|R

Sapheno-peritoneal shunts have been performed in patients with refractory ascites. Here, we evaluated the use of saphenous vein to be anastomosed to the peritoneam to drain the refractory ascites. Nine patients (7 male, median age 45 years, range 17 - 69) with tense refractory ascites associated with liver cirrhosis, perioprtal fibrosis and end stage renal diseases underwent sapheno-peritoneal anastomosis by mobilizing and rotating the proximal vein in order to be anastomosed to peritoneum in the lower abdomen. All procedures were performed under local anaesthesia. Thirty-day mortality was 22 % (2) patient. Morbidity included fluid leakage in 1 (11 %), and wound infection in 1 (11 %). Hospital stay (median) was 16 days (range 11 to 23). In the short term (median of 2 months) significant reduction in body weight and abdominal girth was seen in 9 (90 %), 6 (60 %) were not on diuretics while 3 (30 %) continued to remain on reduced doses of diuretic. Furthermore, 7 (70 %) did not require paracentesis. At 2 -year follow-up, 5 (45 %) patients died and 3 succumbed during follow-up. The remaining 3 were all <b>in</b> <b>active</b> <b>employment,</b> 1 was off diuretics, and 2 were on reduced doses.

The factor significantly associated with acceptability of antiretroviral generics was acceptance of generics per se (p< 0. 001). Among the 116 physicians following a median of 100 HIV-patients/year, 75 % would prescribe generics, dropping to 26 % if the combo had to be broken. Factors significantly associated with willingness to prescribe antiretroviral generics were the absence of concern regarding the chemical entity (OR = 0. 33), being aware that the patient would accept generics for other pathologies (OR = 2. 04) and would accept antiretroviral generics (OR = 1. 94). No factor related to sociodemographic conditions, HIV status or comorbidities was associated with the acceptability of antiretroviral generics.
