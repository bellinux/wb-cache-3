5|$|Although each {{planet has}} unique {{physical}} characteristics, {{a number of}} broad commonalities do exist among them. Some of these characteristics, such as rings <b>or</b> <b>natural</b> satellites, have only as yet been observed in planets in the Solar System, whereas others are also commonly observed in extrasolar planets.|$|E

5|$|If {{the state}} space is the {{integers}} <b>or</b> <b>natural</b> numbers, then the stochastic process {{is called a}} discrete or integer-valued stochastic process. If the state space is the real line, then the stochastic process {{is referred to as}} a real-valued stochastic process or a process with continuous state space. If the state space is -dimensional Euclidean space, then the stochastic process is called a -dimensional vector process or -vector process.|$|E
5|$|Mycotoxins are {{secondary}} metabolites (<b>or</b> <b>natural</b> products), {{and research}} has established {{the existence of}} biochemical pathways solely {{for the purpose of}} producing mycotoxins and other natural products in fungi. Mycotoxins may provide fitness benefits in terms of physiological adaptation, competition with other microbes and fungi, and protection from consumption (fungivory). Many fungal secondary metabolites (or derivatives) are used medically, as described under Human Use below.|$|E

5|$|Pym and Peters {{hide in the}} {{mountains}} surrounding {{the site of the}} ambush. They discover a labyrinth of passages in the hills with strange marks on the walls, and disagree about whether these are the result of artificial <b>or</b> <b>natural</b> causes. Facing a shortage of food, they make a desperate run and steal a pirogue from the natives, narrowly escaping from the island and taking one of its inhabitants prisoner.|$|E
5|$|Severely {{threatened}} by the 2001 outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in England and Wales, the breed has survived due to the intent to preserve this unique animal as {{a crucial part of}} traditional Lakeland agriculture. Still far fewer in number than most commercial breeds, Herdwicks survive largely due to farming subsidies and the aid of the British National Trust for Places of Historic Interest <b>or</b> <b>Natural</b> Beauty.|$|E
5|$|The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage Sites {{are places}} of {{importance}} to cultural <b>or</b> <b>natural</b> heritage {{as described in the}} 1972 UNESCO World Heritage Convention.

5|$|The high-mass air well design {{attempts}} to cool a large mass of masonry with cool nighttime air entering the structure due to breezes <b>or</b> <b>natural</b> convection. In the day, {{the warmth of}} the sun results in increased atmospheric humidity. When moist daytime air enters the air well, it condenses on the presumably cool masonry. None of the high-mass collectors performed well, Knapen's aerial well being a particularly conspicuous example.|$|E
5|$|The {{races are}} held mainly over water near cities, {{but are also}} held at airfields <b>or</b> <b>natural</b> wonders. They are {{accompanied}} by a supporting program of show flights.

He was the first English artist to make illustrations of dragonflies accurate enough to be identified to species (Aeshna grandis at top left of plate illustrated), though his rough drawing of a larva (at lower left) with the mask extended appears to be plagiarised.|$|E
5|$|Another of Hill's {{concerns}} was {{the availability}} of open spaces for poor people. She campaigned against development on existing suburban woodlands, and helped to save London's Hampstead Heath and Parliament Hill Fields from being built on. She {{was one of the}} three founders of the National Trust, set up to preserve places of historic interest <b>or</b> <b>natural</b> beauty for the enjoyment of the British public. She was a founder member of the Charity Organisation Society (now the charity Family Action) which organised charitable grants and pioneered a home-visiting service that formed the basis for modern social work. She {{was a member of the}} Royal Commission on the Poor Laws in 1905.|$|E
5|$|Commonsense {{knowledge}} and reasoning. Many important artificial intelligence applications like vision <b>or</b> <b>natural</b> language require simply {{enormous amounts of}} information about the world: the program needs to have some idea of what it might be looking at or what it is talking about. This requires that the program know most of the same things about the world that a child does. Researchers soon discovered that this was a truly vast amount of information. No one in 1970 could build a database so large and no one knew how a program might learn so much information.|$|E
