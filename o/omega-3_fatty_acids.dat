5|$|Most {{of the fat}} {{found in}} food {{is in the form}} of triglycerides, cholesterol, and phospholipids. Some dietary fat is {{necessary}} to facilitate absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) and carotenoids. Humans and other mammals have a dietary requirement for certain essential fatty acids, such as linoleic acid (an omega-6 fatty acid) and alpha-linolenic acid (an omega-3 fatty acid) because they cannot be synthesized from simple precursors in the diet. Both of these fatty acids are 18-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids differing in the number and position of the double bonds. Most vegetable oils are rich in linoleic acid (safflower, sunflower, and corn oils). Alpha-linolenic acid is found in the green leaves of plants, and in selected seeds, nuts, and legumes (in particular flax, rapeseed, walnut, and soy). Fish oils are particularly rich in the longer-chain <b>omega-3</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). A large number of studies have shown positive health benefits associated with consumption of <b>omega-3</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> on infant development, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and various mental illnesses, such as depression, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and dementia. In contrast, it is now well-established that consumption of trans fats, such as those present in partially hydrogenated vegetable oils, are a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.|$|E

25|$|Fish do not {{actually}} produce <b>omega-3</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids,</b> but instead accumulate them from either consuming microalgae that produce these fatty acids, {{as is the}} case with forage fish like herring and sardines, or, {{as is the case}} with fatty predatory fish, like salmon, by eating prey fish that have accumulated <b>omega-3</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> from microalgae. To satisfy this requirement, more than 50 percent of the world fish oil production is fed to farmed salmon.|$|E

25|$|In AREDS2, {{participants}} {{took one}} of four AREDS formulations: the original AREDS formulation, AREDS formulation with no beta-carotene, AREDS with low zinc, AREDS with no beta-carotene and low zinc. In addition, they {{took one of}} four additional supplement or combinations including lutein and zeaxanthin (10mg and 2mg), <b>omega-3</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> (1,000mg), lutein/zeaxanthin and <b>omega-3</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids,</b> or placebo. The study reported {{that there was no}} overall additional benefit from adding <b>omega-3</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> or lutein and zeaxanthin to the formulation. However, the study did find benefits in two subgroups of participants: those not given beta-carotene, and those who had little lutein and zeaxanthin in their diets. Removing beta-carotene did not curb the formulation's protective effect against developing advanced AMD, which was important given that high doses of beta-carotene had been linked to higher risk of lung cancers in smokers. It was recommended to replace beta-carotene with lutein and zeaxanthin in future formulations for these reasons.|$|E

25|$|Eighty {{percent of}} the forage fish caught are fed to animals, in large {{part due to the}} high content of {{beneficial}} long chain <b>omega-3</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> in their flesh.
