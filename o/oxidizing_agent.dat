5|$|Although E°(Md4+→Md3+) was {{predicted}} in 1975 to be +5.4V, suggesting that mendelevium(III) {{could be easily}} oxidized to mendelevium(IV), 1967 experiments with the strong <b>oxidizing</b> <b>agent</b> sodium bismuthate were unable to oxidize mendelevium(III) to mendelevium(IV).|$|E
5|$|Lead(II) nitrate is toxic, an <b>oxidizing</b> <b>agent,</b> and is {{categorised}} as probably carcinogenic {{to humans}} by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Consequently, {{it must be}} handled and stored with the appropriate safety precautions to prevent inhalation, ingestion and skin contact. Due to its hazardous nature, the limited applications of lead(II) nitrate are under constant scrutiny.|$|E
5|$|Molecular oxygen is {{an ideal}} {{terminal}} electron acceptor {{because it is a}} strong <b>oxidizing</b> <b>agent.</b> The reduction of oxygen does involve potentially harmful intermediates. Although the transfer of four electrons and four protons reduces oxygen to water, which is harmless, transfer of one or two electrons produces superoxide or peroxide anions, which are dangerously reactive.|$|E
30|$|Furthermore, the endoglucanase {{activity}} was substantially stable with <b>oxidizing</b> <b>agents</b> at {{a concentration of}} 0.5 %. Similarly, Gaur and Tiwari (2015) reported that higher concentrations of <b>oxidizing</b> <b>agents</b> (1.0 %) decreased the stability of cellulase except for sodium hypochlorite whereas lower concentrations (0.1 %) enhanced the activity. This suggests that the endoglucanase of B. licheniformis KBFB 3 is moderately tolerant to <b>oxidizing</b> <b>agents</b> and detergents and prove its potential applications in detergent formulations.|$|R
40|$|The {{influences}} of carious <b>oxidizing</b> <b>agents,</b> existing as impurities in nickel plating baths, were investigated and their maximum limits of allowance were determined. Baths of {{bright nickel plating}} and of ordinary dull nickel plating were both employed. As <b>oxidizing</b> <b>agents,</b> nitrate, hydrogen peroxide, chromic acid and chlorine were used here. Among these, chromic acid caused the most injurious effect and chlorine had no marked effect. Removal of these <b>oxidizing</b> <b>agents</b> were attempted by various methods, among which an electrolytic method was found most satisfactory...|$|R

5|$|Lead(II) nitrate is an <b>oxidizing</b> <b>agent.</b> Depending on the reaction, {{this may}} be due to the Pb2+(aq) ion, which has a {{standard}} reduction potential (E0) of −0.125V, or the nitrate ion, which under acidic conditions has an E0 of +0.956V. The nitrate would function at high temperatures or in an acidic condition, while the lead(II) works best in a neutral aqueous solution.|$|E
5|$|Like many powders, {{dysprosium}} powder {{may present}} an explosion hazard when {{mixed with air}} and when an ignition source is present. Thin foils of the substance can also be ignited by sparks or by static electricity. Dysprosium fires cannot be put out by water. It can react with water to produce flammable hydrogen gas. Dysprosium chloride fires, however, can be extinguished with water, while dysprosium fluoride and dysprosium oxide are non-flammable. Dysprosium nitrate, Dy(NO3)3, is a strong <b>oxidizing</b> <b>agent</b> and will readily ignite on contact with organic substances.|$|E
5|$|The common {{oxidation}} {{states of}} silver are (in order of commonness): +1 (the most stable state; for example, silver nitrate, AgNO3); +2 (highly oxidising; for example, silver(II) fluoride, AgF2); and even very rarely +3 (extreme oxidising; for example, potassium tetrafluoroargentate(III), KAgF4). The +1 state {{is by far}} the most common, followed by the reducing +2 state. The +3 state requires very strong oxidising agents to attain, such as fluorine or peroxodisulfate, and some silver(III) compounds react with atmospheric moisture and attack glass. Indeed, silver(III) fluoride is usually obtained by reacting silver or silver monofluoride with the strongest known <b>oxidizing</b> <b>agent,</b> krypton difluoride.|$|E

5|$|The {{standard}} reduction {{potential of}} the E°(No3+→No2+) couple was estimated in 1967 to be between +1.4and+1.5V; it was later found in 2009 to be only about +0.75V. The positive value shows that No2+ is more stable than No3+ and that No3+ is a good <b>oxidizing</b> <b>agent.</b> While the quoted values for the E°(No2+→No0) and E°(No3+→No0) vary among sources, the accepted standard estimates are −2.61and−1.26V. It has been predicted that the value for the E°(No4+→No3+) couple would be +6.5V. The Gibbs energies of formation for No3+ and No2+ {{are estimated to be}} −342and−480kJ·mol−1, respectively.|$|E
5|$|As shown above, E. coli {{can grow}} with {{reducing}} agents such as formate, hydrogen, or lactate as electron donors, and nitrate, DMSO, or oxygen as acceptors. The larger {{the difference in}} midpoint potential between an oxidizing and reducing agent, the more energy is released when they react. Out of these compounds, the succinate/fumarate pair is unusual, as its midpoint potential is close to zero. Succinate can therefore be oxidized to fumarate if a strong <b>oxidizing</b> <b>agent</b> such as oxygen is available, or fumarate {{can be reduced to}} succinate using a strong reducing agent such as formate. These alternative reactions are catalyzed by succinate dehydrogenase and fumarate reductase, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Silver {{and gold}} have rather low {{chemical}} affinities for oxygen, lower than copper, {{and it is}} therefore expected that silver oxides are thermally quite unstable. Soluble silver(I) salts precipitate dark-brown silver(I) oxide, Ag2O, upon the addition of alkali. (The hydroxide AgOH exists only in solution; otherwise it spontaneously decomposes to the oxide.) Silver(I) oxide is very easily reduced to metallic silver, and decomposes to silver and oxygen above 160°C. This and other silver(I) compounds may be oxidized by the strong <b>oxidizing</b> <b>agent</b> peroxodisulfate to black AgO, a mixed silver(I,III) oxide of formula AgIAgIIIO2. Some other mixed oxides with silver in non-integral oxidation states, namely Ag2O3 and Ag3O4, are also known, as is Ag3O which behaves as a metallic conductor.|$|E

5|$|Few {{inorganic}} lead(IV) compounds are known, {{and these}} exist only in highly acidic solutions. Lead(II) oxide gives a mixed oxide on further oxidation, Pb3O4. It {{is described as}} lead(II,IV) oxide, or structurally 2PbO·PbO2, and is the best-known mixed valence lead compound. Lead dioxide is a strong <b>oxidizing</b> <b>agent,</b> capable of oxidizing hydrochloric acid to chlorine gas. This is because the expected PbCl4 that would be produced is unstable and spontaneously decomposes to PbCl2 and Cl2. Analogously to lead monoxide, lead dioxide is capable of forming plumbate anions. Lead disulfide and lead diselenide are only stable at high pressures. Lead tetrafluoride, a yellow crystalline powder, is stable, but less so than the difluoride. Lead tetrachloride (a yellow oil) decomposes at room temperature, lead tetrabromide is less stable still, {{and the existence of}} lead tetraiodide is questionable.|$|E
5|$|The {{noble gas}} atoms, like atoms in most groups, {{increase}} steadily in atomic radius from one period {{to the next}} due to {{the increasing number of}} electrons. The size of the atom is related to several properties. For example, the ionization potential decreases with an increasing radius because the valence electrons in the larger noble gases are farther away from the nucleus and are therefore not held as tightly together by the atom. Noble gases have the largest ionization potential among the elements of each period, which reflects the stability of their electron configuration and is related to their relative lack of chemical reactivity. Some of the heavier noble gases, however, have ionization potentials small enough to be comparable to those of other elements and molecules. It was the insight that xenon has an ionization potential {{similar to that of the}} oxygen molecule that led Bartlett to attempt oxidizing xenon using platinum hexafluoride, an <b>oxidizing</b> <b>agent</b> known to be strong enough to react with oxygen. Noble gases cannot accept an electron to form stable anions; that is, they have a negative electron affinity.|$|E
25|$|It can be {{seen that}} the values of Ecello for these {{reactions}} are similar, but nitric acid is a more powerful <b>oxidizing</b> <b>agent.</b> Base on the fact that dilute nitrous acid can oxidize iodide into iodine, it can be deduced that nitrous is a faster, rather than a more powerful, <b>oxidizing</b> <b>agent</b> than dilute nitric acid.|$|E

25|$|The atom or {{molecule}} which loses electrons {{is known}} as the reducing agent, or reductant, and the substance which accepts the electrons is called the <b>oxidizing</b> <b>agent,</b> or oxidant. Thus, the <b>oxidizing</b> <b>agent</b> is always being reduced in a reaction; the reducing agent is always being oxidized. Oxygen is a common <b>oxidizing</b> <b>agent,</b> but not the only one. Despite the name, an oxidation reaction does not necessarily need to involve oxygen. In fact, a fire can be fed by an oxidant other than oxygen; fluorine fires are often unquenchable, as fluorine is an even stronger oxidant (it has a higher electronegativity and thus accepts electrons even better) than oxygen.|$|E
