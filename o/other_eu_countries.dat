5|$|Northern England has {{a strong}} export-based economy, with trade more {{balanced}} than the UK average, and the North East is the only region of England to regularly export more than it imports. Chemicals, vehicles, machinery and other manufactured goods make {{up the majority of}} Northern exports, just over half of which go to <b>other</b> <b>EU</b> <b>countries.</b> Major manufacturing plants include car plants at Vauxhall Ellesmere Port, Jaguar Land Rover Halewood and Nissan Sunderland, the Leyland Trucks factory, the Hitachi Newton Aycliffe train plant, the Humber, Lindsey and Stanlow oil refineries, the NEPIC cluster of chemical works based around Teesside, and the nuclear processing facilities at Springfields and Sellafield.|$|E
5|$|Like the UK as a whole, the Northern English {{economy is}} now {{dominated}} by the service sector – as of September 2016, 82.2% of workers in the Northern statistical regions were employed in services, compared to 83.7% for the UK as a whole. Manufacturing now employs 9.5%, compared to {{the national average of}} 7.6%. The unemployment rate in Northern England is 5.3% compared to an England-wide and UK-wide average of 4.8%, and the North East has the highest unemployment rate in the UK, at 7.0% as of December 2016, more than one percentage point higher than any other region. As of 2015, the gross value added (GVA) of the Northern English economy was £316 billion, and if it were an independent nation, it would be the tenth largest economy in Europe. The region does have poor growth and productivity rates compared to Southern England and to <b>other</b> <b>EU</b> <b>countries.</b>|$|E

40|$|In this article, {{we review}} the EU’s {{significance}} for social {{policies in the}} UK. The EU has a limited legal role or institutional capacity to directly regulate the social policies of its member states. This role is even more limited {{in the case of}} non-eurozone countries. There are a handful of EU policy measures which have had effects on social policy in the UK. However, these effects have not changed the institutional arrangements for making, organising and delivering social policy, which remain firmly in the hands of UK governments. In consequence, a ‘Leave’ or ‘Remain’ result has relatively limited implications for social policy, except in the case of specific social groups: notably for UK and <b>other</b> <b>EU</b> nationals who have lived and worked in at least one <b>other</b> <b>EU</b> <b>country.</b> <b>Other</b> <b>EU</b> legislation and regulation is compatible with the current and historical policy preferences of UK governments and political parties...|$|R
25|$|Portugal made {{significant}} progress in raising its standard of living to that of its EU partners. GDP per capita on a purchasing power parity basis rose from 51% of the EU average in 1985 to 78% in early 2002. By 2005 this had dropped to 72% (of the average across all of now 25 EU members, including seven with GDP per capita lower than Portugal) as GDP per capita rose in <b>other</b> <b>EU</b> <b>countries.</b> Unemployment stood at 4.1% {{at the end of}} 2001, which was low compared to the EU average.|$|E
25|$|The UK {{has some}} opt-outs from EU policies. One is the opt-out from the Schengen Area, meaning there are full {{passport}} checks for travellers from <b>other</b> <b>EU</b> <b>countries</b> except the Republic of Ireland, {{which is part}} of the Common Travel Area (CTA) with the UK. The Scottish government proposed that an independent Scotland should remain outside the Schengen Area and join the CTA, ensuring that no passport controls would be needed at the Anglo-Scottish border. Nicola Sturgeon commented that an independent Scotland would negotiate with the EU to have the same visa arrangements as the UK has.|$|E
25|$|In European Union (EU) member states, petrol (gas) {{prices are}} much higher than in North America due to higher fuel excise or taxation, {{although}} the base price is also {{higher than in the}} U.S. Occasionally, price rises trigger national protests. In the UK a large-scale protest in August and September 2000, known as 'The Fuel Crisis', caused wide-scale havoc not only across the UK, but also in some <b>other</b> <b>EU</b> <b>countries.</b> The British government eventually backed down by indefinitely postponing a planned increase in fuel duty. This was partially reversed during December 2006 when Gordon Brown (UK Chancellor of the Exchequer) raised fuel duty by 1.25 pence per liter.|$|E
40|$|Permanent {{grassland}} {{makes up}} {{a greater proportion}} of the agricultural area in the UK and Ireland than in any <b>other</b> <b>EU</b> <b>country,</b> representing 60 % and 72 % of UAA respectively (Eurostat 2007). Of the permanent grassland in the UK, approximately half (about 6 million hectares) comprises improved grassland on moist or free-draining neutral soils typical of lowland livestock farms. These swards tend to have low plant species richness and are typically dominated by perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne).

25|$|Public {{water supply}} and {{sanitation}} in Germany is universal and of good quality. Some salient features of the sector compared to other developed countries are its very low per capita water use, the high share of advanced wastewater treatment and very low distribution losses. Responsibility for {{water supply and}} sanitation provision lies with municipalities, which are regulated by the states. Professional associations and utility associations {{play an important role in}} the sector. As in <b>other</b> <b>EU</b> <b>countries,</b> most of the standards applicable to the sector are set in Brussels (see EU water policy). Recent developments include a trend to create commercial public utilities under private law and an effort to modernize the sector, including through more systematic benchmarking.|$|E
25|$|Even before article 7 of {{directive}} 93/98/EC explicitly {{prohibited the}} application of the rule of the shorter term amongst EU countries, the comparison of terms within the EU was not allowed. The Treaty instituting the European Community, which in its original version became effective in 1958, defined in article 7, paragraph 1, that within the union, any discrimination on grounds of nationality was prohibited. (Since 2002, when the treaty was amended by the Treaty of Maastricht, this is article 12, paragraph 1.) Application of the rule of the shorter term is such a discrimination, as it results in granting domestic authors longer copyright terms for their works than foreign authors from <b>other</b> <b>EU</b> <b>countries.</b>|$|E
50|$|For {{countries}} {{within the}} European Union, dental qualifications {{are required to}} reach a minimum approved by each country’s government. Thus a dentist qualified in one country can apply to any <b>other</b> <b>EU</b> <b>country</b> to practice in that country, allowing for greater mobility of labour for dentists (Directives typically apply {{not only to the}} EU but to the wider designation of the European Economic Area - EEA). The Association for Dental Education in Europe (ADEE) has standardization efforts to harmonize European standards. Proposals from the ADEE's Quality Assurance and Benchmarking taskforce cover the introduction of accreditation procedures for EU dentistry universities as well as programmes to facilitate dental students completing part of their education in foreign dentistry schools. Standardization of qualification in a region reciprocally removes one of the perceptual barriers for the development of patient mobility within that region.|$|R
