The {{purpose of the}} study was to validate, in patients with idiopathic {{intracranial hypertension}}, MR imaging–based volumetric measurements of the optic nerve sheath and hypophysis as an objective observation method for more accurate diagnosis and posttreatment follow-up. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-three patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension as well as age-, sex-, and body mass index–matched controls underwent volumetric measurements of the optic nerve, optic nerve sheath, and hypophysis on high-resolution T 2 -weighted MR images by using a 7 -cm surface coil, followed by correlation with CSF <b>opening</b> <b>pressures</b> and clinical symptom scores of visual disturbances and headache. RESULTS: Mean values of optic nerve sheath (341. 86 163. 69 mm 3 versus 127. 56 53. 17 mm 3, P. 001) and hypophysis volumes (554. 59 142. 82 mm 3 versus 686. 60 137. 84 mm 3, P. 05) differed significantly between healthy and diseased subjects.

50|$|The main {{oxidizer}} valve (MOV) was a butterfly-type valve, spring-loaded to {{the closed}} position, pneumatically operated {{to the open}} position, and pneumatically assisted to the closed position. It was mounted between the oxidizer high-pressure duct from the oxidizer turbopump and the oxidizer inlet on the thrust chamber assembly.

Application of <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> in this manner, together with controlled venting of the main oxidizer valve closing pressure through a thermal-compensating orifice, provided a controlled ramp opening of the main oxidizer valve through all temperature ranges.

50|$|Queckenstedt's {{maneuver}} is {{an outdated}} clinical test, formerly used for diagnosing spinal stenosis. The test is performed {{by placing the}} patient in the lateral decubitus position, thereafter the clinician performs a lumbar puncture. The <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> is measured. Then, the clinician's assistant compresses both jugular veins (if increased intracranial pressure is not suspected then one may exert pressure on both external jugular veins but usually pressure is first exerted on the abdomen, this pressure causes an engorgement of spinal veins and in turn rapidly increases cerebrospinal fluid pressure), {{which leads to a}} rise in the intracranial pressure. Given normal anatomy, the intracranial pressure will be reflected as a rapidly rising pressure measured from the lumbar needle, within 10-12 seconds. If there is a stenosis in the spine, there will be a damped, delayed response in the lumbar pressure, thus a positive Queckenstedt's maneuver. Nowadays this test has been made mostly superfluous by superior imaging modalities like MRI and CAT.|$|E
5000|$|The {{lack of an}} {{electrical}} ignition system also reduces the parasitic load on the engine, as the engine {{does not have to}} produce the necessary electricity to ignite the fuel. A significant amount of electricity is required by a spark ignition system, and as engine speeds and loads increase, the ignition system consumes proportionately more electricity, while simultaneously becoming less efficient. Higher cylinder pressure require a [...] "hotter" [...] spark with more current present to overcome the pressure and jump the gap from electrode to electrode in the spark plug. Increased engine speeds and loads also require the spark to occur more rapidly, resulting in additional electrical system loads and demands and more engine power required to meet them. As diesel engine speeds and loads increase, the higher cylinder temperatures after compression of the intake charge result in increased injection and ignition efficiency due to increased fuel atomization. Regardless of fuel system design, a mechanical diesel fuel injection system and rapid rise of fuel pressure and flow will result in injection nozzle <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> being reached more rapidly and also earlier in the 4-stroke cycle with more precise fuel delivery, more precise injection timing and built-in timing advance. Additional power is required to operate the injection system as engine speeds and loads increase, but the increase is more offset than in spark-ignition engines. Modern diesel engines with electronic injection systems use a large amount of electricity for injection, but the ability to precisely time injection and even perform multiple injection events per cycle result in generally increased fuel efficiency compared to mechanically-injected diesel engines of similar size and power.|$|E
30|$|Introduction: The {{sequence}} of events that at alveolar level determine lung inflation are only partially known. Methods that can provide simultaneously high-resolution, in-vivo conditions and information about the core region of the lungs are lacking. Ventilatory strategies to support lung function rely upon the idea that lung alveoli are isotropic balloons that accommodate gas progressively and that pressure/volume curves derive by the interplay of <b>opening</b> <b>pressures</b> and position of alveoli inside the lung. This simplistic idea has been challenged by subpleural microscopy 1, magnetic resonance imaging 2 and computed tomography (CT) studies 3, 4.

5000|$|The {{person is}} usually placed {{on their side}} (left more {{commonly}} than right). The patient bends the neck so the chin {{is close to the}} chest, hunches the back, and brings knees toward the chest. This approximates a fetal position as much as possible. Patients may also sit on a stool and bend their head and shoulders forward. The area around the lower back is prepared using aseptic technique. Once the appropriate location is palpated, local anaesthetic is infiltrated under the skin and then injected along the intended path of the spinal needle. A spinal needle is inserted between the lumbar vertebrae L3/L4, L4/L5 or L5/S1 and pushed in until there is a [...] "give" [...] as it enters the lumbar cistern wherein the ligamentum flavum is housed. The needle is again pushed until there is a second 'give' that indicates the needle is now past the dura mater. The arachnoid membrane and the dura mater exist in flush contact with one another in the living person's spine due to fluid pressure from CSF in the subarachnoid space pushing the arachnoid membrane out towards the dura. Therefore, once the needle has pierced the dura mater it has also traversed the thinner arachnoid membrane. The needle is then in the subarachnoid space. The stylet from the spinal needle is then withdrawn and drops of cerebrospinal fluid are collected. The <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> of the cerebrospinal fluid may be taken during this collection by using a simple column manometer. The procedure is ended by withdrawing the needle while placing pressure on the puncture site. The spinal level is so selected to avoid spinal injuries. In the past, the patient would lie on their back for at least six hours and be monitored for signs of neurological problems. There is no scientific evidence that this provides any benefit. The technique described is almost identical to that used in spinal anesthesia, except that spinal anesthesia is more often done with the patient in a seated position.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To assess {{impact of}} serial lumbar {{punctures}} on association between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> and prognosis in HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis; to explore time course and relationship of <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> with neurological findings, CSF fungal burden, immune response, and CD 4 cell count. DESIGN: Evaluation of 163 HIV-positive ART-naive patients enrolled in three trials of amphotericin B-based therapy for cryptococcal meningitis in Thailand and South Africa. METHODS: Study protocols required four lumbar punctures with measurements of <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> {{over the first}} 2 weeks of treatment and additional lumbar punctures if <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> raised. Fungal burden and clearance, CSF immune parameters, CD 4 cell count, neurological symptoms and signs, and outcome at 2 and 10 weeks were compared between groups categorized by <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> at cryptococcal meningitis diagnosis. RESULTS: Patients with higher baseline fungal burden had higher baseline <b>opening</b> <b>pressure.</b> High fungal burden appeared necessary but not sufficient for development of high pressure. Baseline <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> {{was not associated with}} CD 4 cell count, CSF pro-inflammatory cytokines, or altered mental status.

Overall mortality was 12 % (20 / 162) at 2 weeks and 26 % (42 / 160) at 10 weeks, with no significant differences between <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> groups. CONCLUSION: Studies are needed to define factors, in addition to fungal burden, associated with raised <b>opening</b> <b>pressure.</b> Aggressive management of raised <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> through repeated CSF drainage appeared to prevent any adverse impact of raised <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> on outcome in patients with cryptococcal meningitis.

The model is characterized by distributions of critical <b>opening</b> and closing <b>pressures</b> throughout the lung and by distributions of speeds with which the processes of opening and closing take place once the critical pressures have been achieved.

Excellent fits to the data were obtained when the normally distributed critical <b>opening</b> <b>pressures</b> were about 5 cmH 2 O above the closing pressures and when the hyperbolically distributed opening velocities were about an order of magnitude greater than the closing velocities. We also found that, compared with controls, the injured mice had markedly increased <b>opening</b> and closing <b>pressures</b> but no change in the velocities, suggesting that the key biophysical change wrought by acid injury is dysfunction of surface tension at the air-liquid interface.
