A survey commissioned by Duraspace found that 72% of respondents indicated that their institutional repository is a hosted service. [...] Institutions are choosing cloud-based solutions because such providers [...] "enable institutions to easily get started with a hosted software service, with no need to provision local hardware, software, staff, or other infrastructure nor is there any specific technical skill or expertise required". [...] Also important to the decision to go hosted may be the understanding that a hosted institutional repository solution [...] "frees a library from both hardware and software support, allowing staff resources to be directed to <b>other</b> <b>publishing</b> <b>service</b> functions such as consulting and workflow design." ...|$|R

40|$|Simply put, a Web service {{refers to}} a {{programmable}} Web application that is universally accessible using standard Internet protocols. This paradigm of Web services has been changing the Internet from a repository of data into a repository of services along the following three dimensions: (1) By means that business organizations expose their services on the Internet and make them accessible via standard programmatic interfaces, this model of Web services offers a promising way to facilitate Business-to-Business (B 2 B) collaboration within and across organizational boundaries; (2) The Web services technology provides a uniform framework to increase cross-language and cross-platform interoperability for distributed computing and resource sharing over the Internet; and (3) This paradigm of Web services opens a new cost-effective way of engineering software to quickly develop and deploy Web applications by dynamically integrating <b>other</b> <b>published</b> Web <b>services</b> components to conduct new business transactions. In one word, the paradigm of Web services is thus {{considered to be the}} strategic model {{for the next generation of}} Internet computing (Zhang, 2004). Gartner Group, a leading industry analyst firm, predicted that by 2008 more than 60 % of the business will adopt Web services technique and transform into new forms of enterprises (Pezzini, 2003) ...|$|R

40|$|Technical {{progress}} in electronic publishing affords increasingly sophisticated archiving and retrieval options for authors {{as well as}} readers of ETD and <b>other</b> university document <b>publishing</b> <b>services.</b> The "marketing" of these services has received less attention, despite its great importance for success. In particular, an ETD service must market to its potential authors - their work is what constitutes the service's content. Providing such content may require additional time and effort: The creation of an adequate electronic document involves the intellectual and technical (re-) structuring and markup of a text. What forms of information policy and author support are needed to meet these new challenges for authors? This paper describes a large-scale, questionnaire-based study of the marketing strategies of the Document and Publication Server of Humboldt University Berlin ([URL] This service emphasises long-term archiving and structured retrieval, which requires authors to prepare their texts for conversion into the relatively complex, SGML-based format DiML (Dissertation Markup Language). In this study, the experiences, assessments, plans, and wishes of two central target groups of authors were investigated: people working on their doctoral and "Habilitation" dissertations. The results show that {{a large percentage of}} authors do not know the service, and if they do, start using it very late. The paper concludes with recommendations for improving the information flow between ETD service and authors...|$|R
