5|$|It {{was seen}} in Figure2 that Foucault placed the {{rotating}} mirror R {{as close as possible}} to lens L so as to maximize the distance between R and the slit S. As R rotates, an enlarged image of slit S sweeps across the face <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>distant</b> mirror M. The greater the distance RM, the more quickly that the image sweeps across mirror M and the less light is reflected back. Foucault could not increase the RM distance in his folded optical arrangement beyond about 20meters without the image of the slit becoming too dim to accurately measure.|$|E
5|$|The great {{rivalry between}} these two cities may {{have been based on}} more than {{competition}} for resources. Their dynastic histories reveal different origins and the intense competition between the two powers may have had an ideological grounding. Calakmul's dynasty seems ultimately derived from the great Preclassic city of El Mirador while the dynasty of Tikal was profoundly affected by the intervention <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>distant</b> central Mexican metropolis of Teotihuacan. With few exceptions, Tikal's monuments and those of its allies place great emphasis upon single male rulers while the monuments of Calakmul and its allies gave greater prominence to the female line and often the joint rule of king and queen.|$|E

5|$|Two {{attempts}} were made to travel back to Shipwreck Camp to pick up extra food, but both failed, the second resulting in further losses of dogs and equipment. Chafe, whose feet had become gangrenous after severe frostbite, had his toes removed by second engineer Williamson, with improvised tools. McKinlay and Munro risked their lives by travelling over the sea ice towards Herald Island, in a final effort to locate either of the missing parties. They could get no nearer than , and from an examination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>distant</b> island through binoculars could see no indications of life.|$|E
5|$|One {{reason for}} the mission's success was that it worked by example. Also {{important}} was Gregory's flexibility and willingness to allow the missionaries to adjust their liturgies and behaviour. Another reason was the willingness of Æthelberht to be baptised by a non-Frank. The king would have been wary of allowing the Frankish bishop Liudhard to convert him, as that might open Kent up to Frankish claims of overlordship. But being converted by an agent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>distant</b> Roman pontiff was not only safer, it allowed the added prestige of accepting baptism from the central source of the Latin Church. As the Roman Church was {{considered part of the}} Roman Empire in Constantinople, this also would gain Æthelberht acknowledgement from the emperor. Other historians have attributed the success of the mission to the substantial resources Gregory invested in its success; he sent over forty missionaries in the first group, with more joining them later, a quite significant number.|$|E
5|$|The British, however, did not {{accommodate}} Tirpitz's projections; {{from his}} appointment as the First Sea Lord in 1904, Fisher began a major {{reorganization of the}} Royal Navy. He concentrated British battleship strength in home waters, launched the Dreadnought revolution, and introduced rigorous training for the fleet personnel. In 1912, the British concluded a joint defense agreement with France that allowed the British to concentrate in the North Sea while the French defended the Mediterranean. Worse still, the British began developing the strategy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>distant</b> blockade of Germany starting in 1904; this removed the ability of German light craft to reduce Britain's superiority in numbers and essentially invalidated German naval planning {{before the start of}} World War I.|$|E

25|$|In the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, the Ottomans embarked on an ambitious project: the construction of a railway connecting Istanbul, the capital of the Ottoman Empire and the seat of the Islamic Caliphate, and Hejaz with its holiest shrines of Islam which are the yearly pilgrimage destination of the Hajj. Another important goal was to improve the economic and political integration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>distant</b> Arabian provinces into the Ottoman state, and to facilitate the transportation of military troops in case of need.|$|E
25|$|As the {{designers}} and builders pushed north into Columbia County, connecting Lake Taghkanic State Park {{at last to}} the parkway, they {{took advantage of the}} more open and rolling terrain to improve the road's scenic possibilities. Medians averaged 100 feet (31 m) in width, and it was easier to include views <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>distant</b> Catskills. Curves were generally wider than they had been in Dutchess County. A service station was built in the median at the park, and a scenic overlook at CR8.|$|E
25|$|During {{the years}} {{immediately}} preceding {{the fall of the}} Umayyad Caliphate of Damascus (661–750), revolts arose among the Kharijite Berbers in Morocco which eventually disrupted the stability of the entire Maghrib. Although the Kharijites failed to establish lasting institutions, the results of their revolt persisted. Direct rule by the Caliphs over Ifriqiya became untenable, even following the rapid establishment of the new Abbasid Caliphate of Baghdad in 750. Also, after several generations a local Arabic-speaking aristocracy emerged, which became resentful <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>distant</b> caliphate's interference in local matters.|$|E
2500|$|The group {{recorded}} two Northern singles including [...] "Come On" [...] (1959) and [...] "Alright" [...] (1960). Between these releases, Albert [...] "Mooch" [...] Harrell replaced Pee-Wee Crawford. [...] "Come On" [...] {{became a}} local hit and the Warwick Records label picked the record up for national distribution. Following <b>the</b> release <b>of</b> [...] "Alright", Matthews appointed Williams the group leader, and the group's name {{was changed to}} Otis Williams & <b>The</b> <b>Distants.</b> During this period, both <b>the</b> Primes and <b>Distants</b> were influenced by other vocal groups including the Miracles. Other inspirations included the Cadillacs, Frankie Lymon & the Teenagers, the Drifters, and the Isley Brothers. Though [...] "Come On" [...] was a local hit in the Detroit area, <b>the</b> <b>Distants</b> never saw much record sales and [...] "Alright" [...] was not as successful. After receiving an offer from Berry Gordy to sign with Motown Records, <b>the</b> <b>Distants</b> got out <b>of</b> their contract with Northern Records. However, Mooch Harrell and Richard Street shortly departed from the group and the remaining members lost use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Distants</b> name. Richard Street later formed another Distants group who recorded for the Thelma label in the early 1960s.|$|R

25|$|The {{period of}} the orbit of an eclipsing binary may be {{determined}} from {{a study of the}} light curve, and the relative sizes of the individual stars can be determined in terms of the radius of the orbit by observing how quickly the brightness changes as the disc of the near star slides over the disc <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>distant</b> star. If it is also a spectroscopic binary the orbital elements can also be determined, and the mass of the stars can be determined relatively easily, which means that the relative densities of the stars can be determined in this case.|$|E
25|$|During {{the years}} {{immediately}} preceding {{the fall of the}} Umayyad Caliphate of Damascus (661-750), revolts arose among the Kharijite Berbers in Morocco which eventually disrupted the stability of the entire Maghrib (739-772). The Kharijites failed to establish strong lasting institutions, yet the small Rustamid kingdom persisted (which controlled southern Ifriqiyah); also the impact of the Berber Kharijite revolt changed the political landscape. Direct rule from the East by the Caliphs over Ifriqiya became untenable, even following the rapid establishment of the new Abbasid Caliphate of Baghdad in 750. Also, after several generations a local Arab-speaking aristocracy emerged in Ifriqiya, which became resentful <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>distant</b> caliphate's interference in local matters.|$|E
25|$|The picture's {{theatrical}} design {{places the}} most prominent figures in a shallow foreground stage. Immediately behind them are a diverting company of pages, halberdiers, dwarfs, dogs and monkeys, and in the further distance looms an architectural screen, an arched promenade parallel to the picture plane and supporting more spectators. These are pictorial preferences typical of Veronese, with the placement of figures and edifices reinforcing a processional character. The curves <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>distant</b> arches echo {{the movement of the}} supplicated foreground figures, while the gesture of Sisygambis corresponds to and is reinforced by the verticals of the central fountain; the architectural geometry organizes the movement of the figures.|$|E

25|$|Balakirev also further {{cultivated}} the orientalism of Glinka's opera Ruslan and Lyudmila, {{making it}} a more consistent style. It appears in the Georgian Song of 1861, Islamey and Tamara. This style comprises two parts: a languorous vein of slow, sinuous melody with ornamentation and slow-moving harmonic progressions, contrasted with a more ecstatic vein marked by a perpetuum mobile at a fast tempo and rapid melodic contours over a slower-moving harmonic changes. This style on one hand evoked the mystery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>distant,</b> exotic east with which Russia did not have direct contact, {{and on the other}} hand could also be used to refer to recently colonized areas of the Russian Empire.|$|E
25|$|Despite Sheridan's later {{criticism}} of Warren for moving slowly and his removal of Warren from command the next day, when {{at the end}} of the Battle of White Oak Road Warren heard the sound <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>distant</b> battle receding toward Dinwiddie Court House, he sent Brigadier General Joseph J. Bartlett's brigade of Griffin's division to reinforce Sheridan intending that Bartlett attack Pickett's flank. Moving cross country, Bartlett's men drove Confederate pickets from Dr. Boisseau's farm, just east of Crump Road. Since it was dark when Bartlett's men reach Gravelly Run, they did not try to cross but engaged the Confederates on the other side with sniper fire. The dark night hid the size of Bartlett's force from close scrutiny.|$|E
25|$|The Book of Daniel is not {{regarded}} by scholars as a reliable guide to history.

The book {{that bears his name}} is an apocalypse, not a book of prophecy, and its contents form a cryptic allusion to the persecution of the Jews by the Syrian king Antiochus IV Epiphanes (reigned 175–164 BCE). There is broad agreement that the stories making up chapters 16 are legendary in character, and that the visions of chapters 712 were added during the persecution of Antiochus, the book itself being completed soon after 164 BCE.|$|E
