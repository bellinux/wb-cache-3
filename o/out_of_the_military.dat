5|$|Phan {{was never}} {{known for his}} {{scholarly}} abilities; it was his reputation for principled integrity {{that led to his}} quick rise through the ranks under the reign of Emperor Tự Đức. He was first appointed as a district mandarin in Ninh Bình Province, where he punished a Vietnamese Roman Catholic priest, who, with the tacit support of French missionaries, had harassed local non-Catholics. Amid the diplomatic controversy that followed, he avoided blaming the unpopular alliance between Vietnamese Catholics and the French on Catholicism itself, stating that the partnership had arisen <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> and political vulnerabilities of Vietnam's imperial government. Despite this, the Huế court eventually removed Phan from this post.|$|E
5|$|The Navy {{established}} five separation {{centers for}} the demobilization of the WAVES and Navy nurses, one in Washington, D.C., Memphis, San Francisco, Chicago, and New York. The separation process began on 1 October 1945, {{and within a}} month about 9,000 WAVES had been separated. By the end of 1946, almost 21,000 more had been discharged. It soon became apparent that more centers were needed and ten additional centers were soon opened. By September 1946, demobilization of the WAVES was all but completed. Most women spent {{two or three days}} at separation centers before being discharged, having physical exams; orientation on rights as veterans; final settlement of pay, and then the price of a ticket home. At the time, it was not clear whether demobilization meant phasing women <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> services altogether.|$|E

25|$|Story and {{his wife}} Ellen had a son, Walter Perry Story, {{who was born in}} Bozeman, Montana, on December 18, 1882. He was the last born of their children. Walter began his {{education}} but later attended Shattuck Military Academy at Faribault, Minnesota. He left there in 1902 and graduated from Eastman Business College at Poughkeepsie, New York in 1903. He returned to Bozeman to work with his father until 1905, when he went back to Los Angeles. There he worked in real estate and founded the first motor transit line in the western United States. He then helped his father develop more business in Los Angeles, including building the Story Building, which had twelve stories and was completed on April 1, 1910. The elder Story then retired and move back to Bozeman but died in Los Angeles on March 10, 1926. Walter began his military service by enlisting as a private, later serving in World War I. He was <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> until 1920 when he was commissioned as a captain of infantry in the California National Guard. He became a Brigadier General in July 1926. He wasn't promoted to Major General for another 11 years. In 1928 he founded Camp Merriam, which is now known as Camp San Luis Obispo. He entered federal military service in March 1941 and took command of the 40th Infantry Division. He was relieved of command in September 1941, and retired from active list in July 1942.|$|E

500|$|Smith {{was fascinated}} by the idea of being a fighter pilot, and {{particularly}} excited by the prospect of flying a Spitfire. He wanted to leave Rhodes immediately to join the Southern Rhodesian Air Force, but did not because military recruiters in the colony had been told not to accept university students until after they graduated. As in the First World War, white Rhodesians in general were very keen to enlist; because it was feared that the absence of these men might adversely affect the strategically important mines, manpower controls were introduced to keep certain whites <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> and in their civilian occupations. One of Southern Rhodesia's main contributions to the Allied war effort proved to be its participation, from 1940, in the Empire Air Training Scheme. The Southern Rhodesian Air Force was absorbed into the British Royal Air Force (RAF) in April 1940, becoming No. 237 (Rhodesia) Squadron RAF. Two more RAF squadrons, No. 44 and No. 266, were subsequently also designated [...] "Rhodesian" [...] formations.|$|E

Hedrick visited California School of Fine Arts (now the San Francisco Art Institute) in 1946. During this period, he joined Progressive Art Workers with David Simpson, John Stanley and others. The Progressive Art Workers was a social club which also functioned as a co-operative through which the group the members were able to exhibit their works.

2500|$|In {{the event}} of a combat or {{emergency}} situation, the mixture control may be moved to the auto rich position, providing extra fuel to the engine, or in military aircraft, into military position, if the aircraft is so equipped. [...] When in the military position, the Anti-Detonation Injection (ADI) system is activated, injecting the ADI fluid into the engine intake system. [...] The pressure in the ADI system moves the derichment diaphragm in the fuel control to close off the derichment jet, reducing the fuel flow to a leaner mixture which produces higher engine power by raising the mean effective pressure. This causes the cylinder head temperature to increase to a very high level, which dramatically increases the risk of detonation (see: engine knocking). Adding the ADI fluid raises the mean octane level of the charge preventing pre-ignition and also lowers the cylinder temperatures to a more acceptable level. As this operation takes the engine well beyond its normal design limits, this power setting is not suitable for prolonged use. Once the ADI fluid is exhausted or if the mixture control valve is moved <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> position, the fuel control derichment diaphragm pressure is lost, and the derichment jet is opened once again for normal fuel flow.|$|E

2500|$|The laying <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> {{garden was}} begun in July 1789, and {{an area of}} 800 by {{slightly}} less than 200 metres was quickly made ready for cultivation, but soon the idea was extended {{to the creation of}} a public park, of which the military garden should be only a small part. On August 13, 1789, Charles Theodore published a decree, devoting the Hirschanger to the amusement of the people of Munich. To advise on the project, the Royal Gardener Friedrich Ludwig Sckell (ennobled in 1808) who had studied landscape gardening in England and had previously worked for Charles Theodore at Schwetzingen, had been summoned to Munich earlier in August. Various associated projects were made part of the park development, among them the Elevengarten ("Pupils' Garden", a garden for the students at the recently formed military academy), a [...] "Schweizerey" [...] (cattle farm), [...] "Schäfery" [...] (sheep farm) and [...] "Ackerbauschule" [...] (arable farming school) to improve farming techniques, and a [...] "Vihearzneyschule" [...] (veterinary school) for the treatment of cattle diseases. Most of these projects did not long survive the creation of the park, but the veterinary school went on to become what is now the Tierärztliche Fakultät (Veterinary Faculty) of the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. The gateway from 1790 can be seen at the Veterinärstraße entrance to the garden. [...] The park was initially named [...] "Theodors Park", but it very quickly became known by the descriptive name of [...] "the English Garden". By May, 1790 sufficient progress had been made to allow Charles Theodore to make an inspection tour; but it was first in the spring of 1792 that the park was officially opened to the approximately 40,000 citizens of Munich.|$|E

60|$|Among other central {{thoughts}} in Comte's explanation of history are these:--The displacement of theological by positive conceptions {{has been accompanied}} by a gradual rise of an industrial régime <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> régime;--the great permanent contribution of Catholicism was the separation which it set up between the temporal and the spiritual powers;--the progress of the race consists in the increasing preponderance of the distinctively human elements over the animal elements;--the absolute tendency of ordinary social theories will be replaced by an unfailing adherence to the relative point of view, and from this it follows that the social state, regarded as a whole, has been as perfect in each period as the co-existing condition of humanity and its environment would allow.|$|E

6000|$|Now it can {{be easily}} shown that the thing we call {{aristocracy}} in Europe is not in its origin and spirit an aristocracy at all. It is not a system of spiritual degrees and distinctions like, for example, the caste system of India, or even like the old Greek distinction between free men and slaves. It is simply {{the remains of a}} military organization, framed partly to sustain the sinking Roman Empire, partly to break and avenge the awful onslaught of Islam. The word Duke simply means Colonel, just as the word Emperor simply means Commander-in-Chief. The whole story is told in the single title of Counts of the Holy Roman Empire, which merely means officers in the European army against the contemporary Yellow Peril. Now in an army nobody ever dreams of supposing that difference of rank represents a difference of moral reality. Nobody ever says about a regiment, [...] "Your Major is very humorous and energetic; your Colonel, of course, must be even more humorous and yet more energetic." [...] No one ever says, in reporting a mess-room conversation, [...] "Lieutenant Jones was very witty, but was naturally inferior to Captain Smith." [...] The essence of an army is the idea of official inequality, founded on unofficial equality. The Colonel is not obeyed because he is the best man, but because he is the Colonel. Such was probably the spirit of the system of dukes and counts when it first arose <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> spirit and military necessities of Rome. With the decline of those necessities it has gradually ceased to have meaning as a military organization, and become honeycombed with unclean plutocracy. Even now it is not a spiritual aristocracy--it is not so bad as all that. It is simply an army without an enemy--billeted upon the people.|$|E
