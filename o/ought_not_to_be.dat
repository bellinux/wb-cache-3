5|$|Eta Carinae B is {{a massive}} {{luminous}} hot star, about which little else is known. From certain high excitation spectral lines that <b>ought</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> produced by the primary, Eta Carinae B {{is thought to be}} a young O-type star. Most authors suggest it is a somewhat evolved star such as a supergiant or giant, although a Wolf–Rayet star cannot be ruled out.|$|E
5|$|The whole {{dramatic}} {{moral of}} Coriolanus {{is that those}} who have little shall have less, and {{that those who have}} much shall take all that others have left. The people are poor; therefore they ought to be starved. They are slaves; therefore they ought to be beaten. They work hard; therefore they ought to be treated like beasts of burden. They are ignorant; therefore they <b>ought</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> allowed to feel that they want food, or clothing, or rest, that they are enslaved, oppressed, and miserable. This is the logic of the imagination and the passions; which seek to aggrandise what excites admiration and to heap contempt on misery, to raise power into tyranny, and to make tyranny absolute; to thrust down that which is low still lower, and to make wretches desperate: to exalt magistrates into kings, kings into gods; to degrade subjects to the rank of slaves, and slaves to the condition of brutes. The history of mankind is a romance, a mask, a tragedy, constructed upon the principles of poetical justice; it is a noble or royal hunt, in which what is sport to the few is death to the many, and in which the spectators halloo and encourage the strong to set upon the weak, and cry havoc in the chase though they do not share in the spoil. We may depend upon it that what men delight to read in books, they will put in practice in reality.|$|E

John A. Ryan, also trained as an economist, developed this idea in his book A Living Wage (1906).|$|E

25|$|Parnell's intrigue should not, Biggar said, {{be allowed}} {{to stand in the}} way of {{political}} obligations, and no seat should be sold to a worthless woman's husband. Biggar was not a purist, but urged that private vices should be kept private, and <b>ought</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> imported into political issues. He was prepared to bring about the downfall of Parnell, in spite of the fact that Gladstone was in treaty with him for a Home Rule Bill. I differed.|$|E
25|$|Although it was {{admitted}} {{that those who}} were mere investors <b>ought</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> liable for debts arising from the management of a corporation, throughout {{the late nineteenth century}} there were still many arguments for unlimited liability for managers and directors on the model of the French société en commandite. Such liability for directors of English companies was abolished in 2006. Further, it became increasingly common {{from the end of the}} nineteenth century for shareholders to be directors, protecting themselves from liability.|$|E
25|$|I {{think there}} is a growing distaste for the family duties among women … that should be condemned. The efforts of women to equal man in studies, work, etc., while still {{claiming}} their sex privileges, with the dissolution of club and society life, are leading to a 'race suicide.' This <b>ought</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> Woman is anatomically, physiologically, and emotionally evolved for one sole and single purpose, any departure therefrom being done at the violation of her best ideals and a misdirection of energy.|$|E

25|$|On 1 July 1416 Chichele {{directed}} a half-yearly inquisition by archdeacons to hunt out heretics. On 12 February 1420 proceedings were begun before him against William Taylor, priest, {{who had been}} for fourteen years excommunicated for heresy, and was now degraded and burnt for saying that prayers <b>ought</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> addressed to saints, but only to God. A striking contrast was exhibited in October 1424, when a Stamford friar, John Russell, who had preached that any religious potest concumbere cum muliere and not mortally sin, was sentenced only to retract his doctrine.|$|E
25|$|We assume in {{accordance}} with that case that the corrective process supplied by the State may be so adequate that interference by habeas corpus <b>ought</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> allowed. It certainly is true that mere mistakes of law {{in the course of}} a trial are not to be corrected in that way. But if the case is that the whole proceeding is a mask—that counsel, jury and judge were swept to the fatal end by an irresistible wave of public passion, and that the State Courts failed to correct the wrong, neither perfection in the machinery for correction nor the possibility that the trial court and counsel saw no other way of avoiding an immediate outbreak of the mob can prevent this Court from securing to the petitioners their constitutional rights.|$|E
25|$|As to {{the other}} {{question}} — that of singing roles that, according to self-proclaimed experts, we <b>ought</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> singing — I have a little story to tell. When I decided to sing Otello, many people told me that I was crazy. Mario Del Monaco, they said, had had the proper kind of voice for the role, and my voice was nothing like his. Twenty years earlier, Del Monaco had been warned not to sing Otello because his voice was nothing like that of Ramon Vinay, who was then performing the opera all over the world. Vinay, of course, had heard that only a tenor with a piercing sound like Giovanni Martinelli's ought to sing the part. Some years earlier, Martinelli had had Antonin Trantoul, who had sung Otello at La Scala in the twenties, held up {{to him as a}} shining example; but at La Scala, those who still remembered the very first Otello, Francesco Tamagno, had found Trantoul completely unsatisfactory. But there exists a letter from Verdi to his publisher in which the composer makes it quite clear that Tamagno left a great deal to be desired.|$|E

25|$|A {{landmark}} Calcutta High Court {{ruling on}} 16 May 2003, {{based on a}} report from an academic committee consisting of Dr. Nemai Sadhan Basu, Prof. Barun De, Prof. Sushil Chaudhri, Prof. Arun Dasgupta and Prof. Pradip Sinha found that a 'highly civilised society' and 'an important trading centre' had existed {{on the site of}} Calcutta long before the first European settlers came down the Hooghly. They also found the place then called Kalikatah was an important religious centre due to the existence of the Kali temple in the adjacent village of Kalighat. The first literary reference to the site is found in Bipradas Pipilai's magnum opus Manasa Mangala which dates back to 1495. Abul Fazl's Ain-I-Akbari dating 1596 also mentions the place. The Sabarna Roy Choudhury family was granted the Jagirdari of Kalikatah by Emperor Jehangir in 1608. The report added that Charnock's name was just the first of those, including Eyre, Goldsborough, Lakshmikanta Majumdar (Laksmikanta Roy Choudhury), the Sett Bysack families and Sabarna Choudhuries, that could be celebrated for developing the city. The court declared that Charnock <b>ought</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> regarded as the founder of Calcutta, and ordered government authorities to purge his name from all textbooks and official documents containing the history of the founding story of the city.|$|E

500|$|Lord Phillips {{noted that}} expert {{witnesses}} (unlike witnesses giving evidence of facts) {{had volunteered to}} give evidence and were doing so for payment. [...] He saw [...] "no justification" [...] for the assumption that experts would be discouraged from providing their services {{if they could be}} sued. As for the effect on an expert's willingness to give frank evidence, there was no empirical evidence either way, he said. However, a witness of integrity would concede a change of view where necessary to do so and <b>ought</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> concerned about being sued.|$|E

I advise you to say nothing more of that sort. I do so entirely for your own sake." ...|$|E

[...] Coolidge was aware of his stiff reputation; indeed, he cultivated it. [...] "I think the American people want a solemn ass as a President," [...] he once told Ethel Barrymore, [...] "and I think I will go along with them." [...] Some historians would later suggest that Coolidge's image was created deliberately as a campaign tactic, while others believe his withdrawn and quiet behavior to be natural, deepening {{after the death of}} his son in 1924.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to the Courier, other groups and institutions that decried the punitive use of the blue discharge included the American Legion, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the Congress of Industrial Organizations, and the Veterans Benevolent Association. In the U.S. Senate, {{the chairman of the}} Senate Veterans Committee, Sen. Edwin C. Johnson (D-Colorado), read the Couriers editorial into the record. On October 29, 1945, noting that a blue discharge meant the veteran had not been convicted and yet had been separated from the military without being able to defend himself, he said: [...] "There <b>ought</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a twilight zone between innocence and guilt. Blue discharges are certain to be a headache for Congress from now on." ...|$|E
500|$|As vice president-elect, Tyler {{remained}} quietly at {{his home}} in Williamsburg. [...] He privately expressed hopes that Harrison would prove decisive and not allow intrigue in the Cabinet, especially in the first days of the administration. Tyler did not participate in selecting the Cabinet, and did not recommend anyone for federal office in the new Whig administration. Harrison, beset by office seekers and the demands of Senator Clay, twice sent letters to Tyler asking his advice as to whether a Van Buren appointee should be dismissed. [...] In both cases, Tyler recommended against, and Harrison wrote, [...] "Mr. Tyler says they <b>ought</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> removed, and I will not remove them."

[...] He related the spheres' motions to the proportion of motive power to resistance that was impressed in each sphere when God created the heavens. [...] In discussing the relation of the moving power of the intelligence, the resistance of the sphere, and the circular velocity, he said [...] "this ratio <b>ought</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> called a ratio of force to resistance except by analogy, because an intelligence moves by will alone... and the heavens do not resist it." ...|$|E
