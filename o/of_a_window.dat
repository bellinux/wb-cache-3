Phoebe causes a snowfall that awakens the astronomers, and they seek shelter in a cavern where they discover giant mushrooms.

5|$|The Greek meander pattern at {{the foot}} of the wall is unusually close to the picture plane, {{confining}} the sitter. The wall is painted in gold, adding to the sense of a monumental portrait of a modern icon. The details of Bertin's face are highly symmetrical. His eyes are heavily lidded, circled by oppositely positioned twists of his white collar, the winds of his hair, eyebrows and eyelids. His mouth turns downwards at the left and upwards to the right. This dual expression is intended to show his duality and complex personality: he is a hard-nosed businessman, and a patron of the arts. The reflection <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>window</b> can be seen in the rim of Bertin's chair. It is barely discernible, but adds spatial depth. The Portrait of Pope Leo X (c. 1519) by Raphael, a source for the Bertin portrait, also features a window reflection of the pommel on the pope's chair.|$|E

5|$|The Joker forces Batman {{into a game}} of {{hide and}} seek, giving him one hour to escape Arkham before his adversaries are sent to hunt him down. Although Batman {{initially}} refuses, he accepts the challenge after the Joker shoots a prison guard {{in the head and}} then threatens to kill Adams. However, unbeknownst to Batman, the Joker shortens the time from one hour to ten minutes after being pressured by the other inmates. Batman subsequently encounters Clayface, Mad Hatter, the Scarecrow, and Maxie Zeus, among other villains. During a struggle with Killer Croc, Batman is thrown out <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>window,</b> grabbing onto the statue of the angel Michael. Clutching the statue's bronze spear, Batman climbs back inside and impales Croc before throwing him out the window, sustaining a severe wound from the spear in the process.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Jennifer Crittenden. She came into the writers' room and pitched {{the idea that there}} should be a teachers' strike in an episode. Then-show runner David Mirkin thought the episode had a lot of potential, and much of it is based on his {{experience}} as a child with schools running out of money. Despite the title of the episode, at no point does the PTA (Parent-Teacher Association) actually disband. The title was suggested by Mirkin and was intended to poke fun at Crittenden, who thought the most exciting part of the teachers going on strike would be that the PTA might disband. In addition to this, Mirkin added a character to the episode who, on thinking the PTA has disbanded, jumps panicking out <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>window.</b> He jumps back in the same window when he is told the PTA has not disbanded.|$|E
5|$|The first Japanese {{mainstream}} {{film with}} nudity was Seijun Suzuki's Gate of Flesh, (1964), and Takechi {{made the first}} big-budget, mainstream pink film, Daydream(白日夢), the same year. Like Women... Oh, Women!, Daydream was produced independently but Shochiku studios distributed the film. This time, the studio gave Takechi's film a major publicity campaign. Based on a 1926 short story by Jun'ichirō Tanizaki, the film was a black comedy involving a series of sex scenes imagined by an artist under anesthesia in a dentist's office. After being drugged, the artist watches helplessly {{from the other side}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>window</b> as the dentist tortures and performs a series of sexual acts on a female patient.|$|E

5|$|The police {{discover}} Michael's {{location and}} surround the shed. Loomis arrives and goes inside {{to try to}} reason with Michael. Inside, he finds Laurie, who is hallucinating a younger Michael holding her down, and tries telling her {{that no one is}} restraining her. Just then, Deborah instructs the older Michael {{that it is time to}} go home; Michael attacks Loomis and kills him. Stepping in front <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>window</b> while holding Loomis' body, Michael is shot twice by Annie's father, Sheriff Leigh Brackett (Brad Dourif), and falls into the spikes of some farming equipment. Apparently released from her visions, Laurie walks over and tells Michael she loves him, then stabs him repeatedly. The shed door opens and Laurie walks out, wearing Michael's mask. Later, Laurie sits in isolation in a psychiatric ward, grinning at a vision of Deborah.|$|E
