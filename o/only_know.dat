5|$|After {{a lengthy}} time, {{it seems as}} if the dog is cured, in that he is now {{friendly}} towards Keys. Julie confronts the dog's original owner, who has come to claim him, and who presumably trained him to attack black people. She angrily tells him in front of his grandchildren, who <b>only</b> <b>know</b> the dog as a loving family pet, that the dog has been cured by a black man.|$|E
5|$|Yeah, I don't know. I mean, I mostly <b>only</b> <b>know</b> {{things are}} {{different}} because people ask me different questions, but I don't feel like things are very changed. I mean, I still, I {{do the same things}} that I did before … I think about the same things, so … I'm the wrong kind of person to be really big and famous.|$|E
5|$|The Hebrew {{alphabet}} is, {{like the}} Persian alphabet, an abjad. It {{is used for}} the Jewish Bukhori dialect primarily in Samarkand and Bukhara. Additionally, since 1940, when Jewish schools were closed in Central Asia, the use of the Hebrew Alphabet outside Hebrew liturgy fell into disuse and Bukharian Jewish publications such as books and newspapers began to appear using the Tajik Cyrillic Alphabet. Today, many older Bukharian Jews who speak Bukharian and went to Tajik or Russian schools in Central Asia <b>only</b> <b>know</b> the Tajik Cyrillic Alphabet when reading and writing Bukharian and Tajik.|$|E

50|$|Lissonanchus lusheri, the Streaky {{clingfish}}, is {{a species}} of clingfish <b>only</b> <b>known</b> from one specimen collected {{off the coast of}} southern Mozambique. The length of the <b>only</b> <b>known</b> specimen was 2.1 cm SL. This species is the <b>only</b> <b>known</b> member of its genus.|$|R
50|$|Information on {{some species}} is limited {{due to lack}} of {{specimen}}s. C. caiapo, C. jurubidae, C. sarcodes, and C. umbrosa are <b>only</b> <b>known</b> from a single specimen each, C. starnesi is <b>only</b> <b>known</b> from two specimens, C. parma is <b>only</b> <b>known</b> from four, and C. sandrae from only six specimens.|$|R
5|$|The {{adults in}} the {{community}} are considered semi-speakers as they have a passive understanding of Wagiman and generally <b>only</b> <b>know</b> a few basic words. Their children, the grandchildren of the elders, understand very little Wagiman and speak none. Apart from Mayali, Kriol, a creole language based on the vocabulary of English, is the lingua franca of the area. All members of the Wagiman ethnic group, {{as well as all}} other ethnic groups represented in the area, are native speakers of a moderate grade of Kriol.|$|E
5|$|As well, {{ordinary}} {{middle class}} Dutch people began buying art {{for the first}} time, creating a high demand for paintings of all kinds. This demand was met by enormous painter guilds. Master painters set up studios to produce large numbers of paintings quickly. Under the master's direction, studio members would specialise in parts of a painting, such as figures in landscapes, or costumes in portraits and history paintings. Masters would sometimes add a few touches to authenticate a work mostly done by pupils, to maximise both speed and price. Numerous art dealers organised commissions on behalf of patrons, as well as buying uncommissioned stock to sell on. Landscape artists did not depend on commissions in the way most painters had to do, and could therefore paint for stock. In Ruisdael's case, {{it is not known}} whether he kept stock to sell directly to customers, or sold his work through dealers, or both. Art historians <b>only</b> <b>know</b> of one commission, a work for the wealthy Amsterdam burgomaster Cornelis de Graeff, jointly painted with Thomas de Keyser.|$|E

25|$|Its {{geographical}} {{identification is}} not clear, several locations having been suggested throughout history. We <b>only</b> <b>know</b> {{that it was}} connected by a road with Jerusalem; the distance given by Luke varies in different manuscripts and the figure given has been made even more ambiguous by interpretations.|$|E
25|$|So it is {{said that}} if you know your enemies and know {{yourself}}, you will not be put at risk even in a hundred battles.If you <b>only</b> <b>know</b> yourself, but not your opponent, you may win or may lose.If you know neither yourself nor your enemy, you will always endanger yourself.|$|E
25|$|Consequently, {{throughout}} the history of human culture, people have become dissatisfied with language's ability to express reality and as a result have developed new modes of representation. It is necessary to construct new ways of seeing reality, as people <b>only</b> <b>know</b> reality through representation. From this arises the contrasting and alternate theories and representational modes of abstraction, realism and modernism, to name a few.|$|E
50|$|Ectrepopterus uruguayensis is {{a species}} of characin <b>only</b> <b>known</b> from streams in Uruguay. This species grows to 4.7 cm in {{standard}} length. This species is the <b>only</b> <b>known</b> member of its genus.|$|R

25|$|The layouts of both {{floors of}} “Maxim’s” have been preserved. Having entered the variety theatre the {{visitors}} {{found themselves in}} a large oblong space with a small stage and a row of boxes running along the three walls. We have no specific information about the décor, the evidence is scarce. We <b>only</b> <b>know</b> that there were metal columns and many lamps of various colours in the house, the contemporaries also mention the glass floor with inbuilt lights.|$|E
25|$|Humphrey Stafford married Lady Anne Neville, {{daughter}} of Ralph de Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland and Lady Joan Beaufort (Westmorland's second wife), {{at some point}} prior to 18 October 1424. Anne Neville was a literary patron in her own right, also receiving a dedication in a copy of Scrope's translated Othea, and left many books in her will. They had 12 children: seven sons (only three of whom survived to adulthood) and five daughters (of whom we <b>only</b> <b>know</b> of three marrying).|$|E

25|$|Eretria at {{its height}} (a period brought to an end by this war) could field 3,000 hoplites, 600 cavalry and 60 chariots. This implies that this {{conflict}} {{took place at the}} transitional time between the Homeric aristos, entering the war on chariot and fighting his enemies like the heroes of the Iliad, and the classical hoplite. The size and numbers of Chalcis's forces are unknown. We <b>only</b> <b>know</b> that their infantry was superior and their cavalry inferior to that of Eretria.|$|E
25|$|This {{statement}} of the mean value property can be generalized as follows: If h is any spherically symmetric function supported in B(x,r) such that ∫h = 1, then u(x) = h * u(x). In other words, we can take the weighted average of u about a point and recover u(x). In particular, by taking h to be a C∞ function, we can recover the value of u at any point even if we <b>only</b> <b>know</b> how u acts as a distribution. See Weyl's lemma.|$|E
25|$|It {{may now be}} {{understood}} that Henri Bergson was dissatisfied with Kantianism, which limited the bounds of reason {{to such an extent}} that it deemed knowledge of the absolute an impossibility. His method of intuition can in fact be seen as a response to Immanuel Kant, who believed that we can <b>only</b> <b>know</b> the world as it appears to us, not as it is in itself. He maintained that the attempt to know the absolute always resulted in antinomies, a kind of philosophical paradox caused by the limits of reason.|$|E
50|$|Amyrmex golbachi {{is a rare}} Neotropical {{species of}} ant and the <b>only</b> <b>known</b> species in the genus Amyrmex. It is {{currently}} <b>only</b> <b>known</b> from males from the Amazon basin of Brazil and from northern Argentina.|$|R

25|$|Most of the Greco-Roman alchemists {{preceding}} Zosimos {{are known}} only by pseudonyms, such as Moses, Isis, Cleopatra, Democritus, and Ostanes. Others authors such as Komarios, and Chymes, we <b>only</b> <b>know</b> through fragments of text. After 400, Greek alchemical writers occupied themselves solely in {{commenting on the}} works of these predecessors. By {{the middle of the}} 7th century alchemy was almost an entirely mystical discipline. It was at that time that Khalid Ibn Yazid sparked its migration from Alexandria to the Islamic world, facilitating the translation and preservation of Greek alchemical texts in the 8th and 9th centuries.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to Picasso and Braque, Gleizes' intent {{was not to}} analyze and describe visual reality. Gleizes had argued that we cannot know the external world, we can <b>only</b> <b>know</b> our sensations. Objects from daily life⎯guitar, pipe or bowl of fruit⎯ did not satisfy his complex idealistic concepts of the physical world. His subjects were of vast scale and of provocative social and cultural meaning. Gleizes' iconography (as of Delaunay, Le Fauconnier and Léger) helps to explain why there is no period in his work corresponding to analytic Cubism, {{and how it was}} possible for Gleizes to become an abstract painter, more theoretically in tune with Kandinsky and Mondrian than Picasso and Braque, who remained associated with visual reality.|$|E
25|$|Some recruits, {{due to the}} {{sensitivity}} of their position or their personalities not being appropriate for cell leadership, might not enter cells but be run as singletons, perhaps by other than the recruiting case officer. Asset BARD is {{a different sort of}} highly sensitive singleton, who is a joint asset of the country B, and the country identified by prefix AR. ARNOLD is a case officer from the country AR embassy, who knows only the case officer BERTRAM and the security officer BEST. ARNOLD does not know the station chief of BERRY or any of its other personnel. Other than BELL and BEST, the Station personnel <b>only</b> <b>know</b> BERTRAM as someone authorized to be in the Station, and who is known for his piano playing at embassy parties. He is covered as Cultural Attache, in a country that has very few pianos. Only the personnel involved with BARD know that ARNOLD is other than another friendly diplomat.|$|E
