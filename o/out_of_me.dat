If you get high, you can do that, which is why a lot of people drop acid or do drugs, because they want to get closer to God. But there's going to be a short circuit, and that's the {{illusion}} of drugs, because they give you the illusion of getting closer to God, but ultimately they kill you. They destroy you. I mean, I tried everything once, but as soon as I was high, I spent my time drinking tons of water {{to get it out of}} my system. As soon as I was high, I was obsessed with flushing it <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>me.</b> I was like, 'OK, I'm done now'.|$|E
25|$|During the 13 months (in the) almost continual and {{sustained}} combat in which I have ever participated, there were moments, and rare ones, I am sure; but they lose {{none of their}} terror or horror for which fear laid a relentless and a powerful hold on me, that the pull of cowardice was almost more than I could ward off. There were terrible moments that encompassed a lifetime, an endlessness, when terror was so strong in me, that I could feel idiocy replace reason. (Yet,) I have never left my position, nor have I shirked hazardous duty. Fear {{did not make a}} coward <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
25|$|Paisley {{released}} his book Diary of a Player: How My Musical Heroes Made a Guitar Man <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>Me</b> in 2011 under Howard Books Publishing. He co-wrote {{the book with}} author David Wild, {{a contributing editor for}} Rolling Stone magazine and an Emmy nominated TV writer and producer. The book is an autobiography and talks about Paisley's introduction to the music industry and how the events in his life helped to prepare him for what was up ahead. The book features topics such as the first guitar that his grandfather gave him, his first band the C-notes, the first song he wrote, and many more music/guitar related topics. Although the book does speak briefly of his personal life, the main focus is on his music and the start of his career.|$|E

His subsequent assignment was to produce the 1943 April Fools' Day cover for The Post, which was much more relaxing.|$|E
500|$|Judah, who trailed 97–91 on {{all three}} scorecards, claimed he had been {{weakened}} by the two low blows early in the fight. He said, [...] "The first low blow was very hard.

[...] Cotto earned $2.5 million plus a piece of the pay-per-view profits, while Judah earned $1 million plus a percentage of the profits.|$|E

500|$|The pessimism {{expressed}} by Phillips and Mecklin surprised Frederick Nolting, who preceded Lodge as the US ambassador in Saigon. Nolting said that Phillips' account [...] "surprised the hell <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>me.</b> I couldn't believe my ears." [...] Nolting asserted that Mecklin was psychologically vulnerable to being brainwashed {{because he had}} recently split with his wife. At the time, Mecklin was living with journalists David Halberstam and Neil Sheehan of The New York Times and UPI respectively. Halberstam and Sheehan both won Pulitzer Prizes and were strident critics of Diệm.|$|E
500|$|At Sutter's July 2006 {{induction}} to the Hall, Smith {{talked with}} reporters about his chances for election. Like many others, he commented {{that he was}} puzzled {{that he had not}} yet been selected. [...] "This confuses the hell <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>me.</b> But I've always been baffled by it", he said. Smith's candidacy may have been hampered by the number of outstanding relievers on the ballot; Sutter had earned increasing vote totals for nine years before Smith appeared on the ballot, and Gossage—who first appeared on the ballot three years before Smith—has received greater support in each year from 2004 until his induction in 2008.|$|E

According to Maria Muldaur, {{she and her husband}} were frequent dinner guests, which usually involved sitting around a piano and singing songs. She doubted her abilities, but [...] "it was Butter that first encouraged me to let loose and just sing the blues [...] not to worry about singing pretty or hitting all the right notes... He loosened all the levels of self-consciousness and doubt <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>me...</b> And he'll forever live in my heart for that and for respecting me as a fellow musician." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Soul Sound" [...] {{was written}} by the Scottish {{musician}} Charlotte Gordon Cumming during her trip to Kenya. Her inspiration to write the song stemmed from Africa, a continent which she visited frequently with her family as a child. According to Cumming, [...] "In Africa I feel extremely alive, but also very small. The song was the essence of how I felt: seeing the beauty and horror of a place, and going into a heightened state." [...] She elaborated, [...] "My songs are all about who I am and what I am feeling, {{which is why they}} can take so much <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> to perform – and I always feel a lot when I go to Africa".|$|E

I {{thought he was going to}} take a bite <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> so I lifted the veil I was wearing and had a stare-down with him and he opened his mouth and let out this huge roar. I got so frightened my heart fell in my shoe. When he finally walked away, the director yelled 'Cut' and I had to take a long breather. But I could really relate to the lion. I feel like in a past life I was a lion or a cat or something." ...|$|E
500|$|In May 1757, in {{defiance}} of the custom of holding the heavy cavalry in reserve, Seydlitz brought his regiment forward to join the advance guard at the Battle of Prague. Here he nearly lost his life attempting to ride through a marshy pool; his horse became stuck in quicksand and his troopers pulled him away. At the Prussian loss at Kolin in June 1757, he and a cavalry brigade checked the Austrian pursuit by a brilliant charge. Two days later, the King promoted him to major general and awarded him the Pour le Mérite. Seydlitz felt he had deserved the promotion for a long time, for he responded to Hans Joachim von Zieten's congratulations by saying, [...] "It was high time, Excellency, if they wanted more work <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>me.</b> I am already thirty-six." ...|$|E

500|$|Of the end result, Spotnitz said [...] "I {{was very}} pleased with the way it was executed, and I {{think it was a good}} mystery. He later wrote that he [...] "liked [...] more as time has gone on." [...] Director Rob Bowman {{admitted}} to being tired and not inspired by the time this episode—the second to last of the season—was produced. This lack of interest later resulted in the episode taking extra time to finish. Bowman later recalled that the most difficult aspect of the episode was filming the climactic human sacrifice scene, if only because of the ceremonial mask featured. He explained, [...] "the mask scared the hell <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> only because I thought, 'Boy, if I don't shoot this right, it's going to be silly." ...|$|E
500|$|Shakur {{converted}} to Roman Catholicism {{as a child}} and attended the all-girls Cathedral High School, for six months before transferring to public high school, which she attended until she dropped out. Shakur is no longer Catholic. She later earned a General Educational Development (GED) with her aunt's help. Often there were few, or no other black students in her high school class. Shakur later wrote teachers seemed surprised when she answered a question in class, as if not expecting black people to be intelligent and engaged, and what she was taught a sugar-coated version of history that ignored the oppression suffered by people of color, especially in the United States. In her autobiography she later wrote: “I didn’t know what a fool they had made <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> until I grew up and started to read real history”.|$|E
500|$|Hordern was a self-confessed [...] "lazy bugger" [...] {{when it came}} to role preparation. He did not regret {{his lack}} of formal acting training, and {{attributed}} his abilities to watching and learning from other actors and directors. He said: [...] "I am bored of the intellectual view of the theatre. Actually, it scares the shit <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>me,</b> my view being that an actor should learn the lines without too much cerebral interference." [...] In 1951, he asked Byam Shaw how best to rehearse unfamiliar roles. [...] The director advised him to [...] "never read up on them" [...] before going on to say [...] "read the plays as much as [...] but never read the commentators or critics". It was advice which Hordern adopted for the role of King Lear, {{and for the rest of}} his career. The critic Brian McFarlane, writing for the British Film Institute, said that Hordern, despite his relaxed attitude, [...] "had one of the most productive careers of any 20th century British actor".|$|E

500|$|Although {{there had}} been stress and {{conflict}} during the recording of other Chili Peppers albums, the Mother's Milk sessions were uncomfortable due to Beinhorn's incessant desire to create a hit. He recalled {{that he and the}} band were at odds: [...] "Suffice to say that I had a very intense personal relationship [...] and somewhere along the line I fell out with [...]" [...] Beinhorn constantly clashed with Frusciante over guitar effects. According to Kiedis, [...] " [...] wanted John to have a big, crunching, almost metal-sounding guitar tone whereas before we always had some interesting acid-rock guitar tones as well as a lot of slinky, sexy, funky guitar tones." [...] Frusciante was frustrated with the producer's attitude and ultimately resented his playing on the record, feeling it was too [...] "macho". Kiedis recalled that, in the end, [...] "I couldn't tolerate his direction any longer. He was trying to squeeze something <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> that I wasn't feeling, and we got in a fight and I knew that I was done with him." ...|$|E
500|$|At age 10, Ryder and {{her family}} moved on again, this time to Petaluma, California. During her first week at Kenilworth Junior High, she was bullied {{by a group of}} her peers who mistook her for an effeminate, scrawny boy. [...] "I was wearing an old Salvation Army shop boy’s suit. As I went to the {{bathroom}} I heard people saying, ‘Hey, faggot’. They slammed my head into a locker. I fell to the ground and they started to kick the shit <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>me.</b> I had to have stitches. The school kicked me out, not the bullies... Years later, I went to a coffee shop and I ran into one of the girls who’d kicked me, and she said, ‘Winona, Winona, can I have your autograph?’ And I said, ‘Do you remember me? Remember in seventh grade you beat up that kid?’ And she said, ‘Kind of’. And I said, ‘That was me. Go fuck yourself.’" [...] As a result, Ryder ended up being home-schooled that year.|$|E

As commented by both Becky Bain of Idolator and Jennifer Still of the British entertainment and media news website Digital Spy, the [...] "powerful [...] emotional" [...] performance [...] "deservedly brought the judges to their feet". Amaro received a standing ovation from the audience and panel of judges alike. The performance of Amaro also brought Nicole Scherzinger to tears. She said: [...] "This is why I do this. People like you inspire me. You made a believer <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>me.</b> Thank you." [...] Paula Abdul said: [...] "You are the brightest gift, God bless you." [...] L.A. Reid declared: [...] "Melanie, you are truly amazing.
