5|$|After 4500 BCE the Ertebølle culture <b>of</b> <b>northwestern</b> origin {{entered a}} ceramic phase {{with its own}} forms of pottery (characteristic pointed bottoms).

At their settlement in Dąbki near Koszalin Stroke-ornamented pottery was found, obtained probably through trade with the Danubian people.|$|E

5|$|The {{life history}} {{characteristics}} of the silky shark differ across its range (see table). Northwestern Atlantic sharks tend to be larger {{than those in the}} western-central Pacific at all ages, while eastern Pacific sharks tend to be smaller than sharks in other regions. Eastern Atlantic and Indian Ocean sharks seem to match or exceed the size <b>of</b> <b>northwestern</b> Atlantic sharks, but the figures are based on relatively few individuals and more data are needed.|$|E
5|$|The {{proposed}} {{migration of}} speakers of the Proto-Nahuan language into the Mesoamerican region {{has been placed}} at sometime around AD 500, {{towards the end of}} the Early Classic period in Mesoamerican chronology. Before reaching the Mexican Plateau, pre-Nahuan groups probably spent a period of time in contact with the Corachol languages Cora and Huichol <b>of</b> <b>northwestern</b> Mexico (which are also Uto-Aztecan).|$|E

5|$|One poorly studied area of Maya {{folk art}} is graffiti. Additional graffiti, {{not part of}} the planned decoration, was incised into the stucco of {{interior}} walls, floors, and benches, {{in a wide variety of}} buildings, including temples, residences, and storerooms. Graffiti has been recorded at 51 Maya sites, particularly clustered in the Petén Basin and southern Campeche, and the Chenes region <b>of</b> <b>northwestern</b> Yucatán. At Tikal, where a great quantity of graffiti has been recorded, the subject matter includes drawings of temples, people, deities, animals, banners, litters, and thrones. Graffiti was often inscribed haphazardly, with drawings overlapping each other, and display a mix of crude, untrained art, and examples by artists who were familiar with Classic-period artistic conventions.|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys gorgasi, {{also known}} as Gorgas's oryzomys or Gorgas's rice rat, is a rodent in the genus Oryzomys of family Cricetidae. First {{collected}} as a living animal in 1967, it is known from only a few localities, including a freshwater swamp in the lowlands <b>of</b> <b>northwestern</b> Colombia and a mangrove islet in northwestern Venezuela. It formerly occurred {{on the island of}} Curaçao off northwestern Venezuela; this extinct population {{has been described as a}} separate species, Oryzomys curasoae, but does not differ morphologically from mainland populations.|$|E

5|$|The 1st Army Group was a Royal Yugoslav Army {{formation}} mobilised {{prior to}} the German-led Axis invasion of the Yugoslavia in April 1941 during World War II. It consisted of the 4th Army, 7th Army, and the 1st Cavalry Division, which was the army group reserve.

5|$|The American robin has a {{place in}} Native American mythology. The {{story of how the}} robin got its red breast by fanning the dying flames of a campfire to save a Native American man and a boy is similar to those that {{surround}} the European robin. The Tlingit people <b>of</b> <b>Northwestern</b> North America held it to be a culture hero created by Raven to please the people with its song. One of the houses of the Raven Tribe from the Nisga'a Nation holds the robin as a house crest.|$|E
5|$|The Austro-Hungarians {{suffered}} about 225,000 casualties, including 30,000 killed, 173,000 {{wounded and}} 70,000 taken prisoner. They reported that 200 of their officers were taken prisoner {{during the battle}} and more than 130 cannon, 70 heavy machine-guns and a large quantity of matériel were captured. The Serbs also suffered heavy casualties, with 22,000 killed, 91,000 wounded and 19,000 missing or captured. The Western press was appalled with the scale of atrocities committed by the Austro-Hungarian troops against Serbian civilians, including women and children. William Shepard, of the United Press, confirmed as an eyewitness that at least eighteen towns were fully abandoned, and the whole <b>of</b> <b>northwestern</b> Serbia was nearly depopulated.|$|E

The main US forces defending Khe Sanh Combat Base (KSCB) were two regiments of US Marines supported by elements from the United States Army and the United States Air Force.

5|$|The Colorado {{is joined}} by over 25 {{significant}} tributaries, of which the Green River is the largest by both length and discharge. The Green takes drainage from the Wind River Range of west-central Wyoming, from Utah's Uinta Mountains, and from the Rockies <b>of</b> <b>northwestern</b> Colorado. The Gila River is the second longest and drains a greater area than the Green, but has a significantly lower flow because of a more arid climate and larger diversions for irrigation and cities. Both the Gunnison and San Juan rivers, which derive most of their water from Rocky Mountains snowmelt, contribute more water than the Gila did naturally.|$|E
5|$|The Mahajanga Basin <b>of</b> <b>northwestern</b> Madagascar has {{produced}} a rich late Cretaceous fauna, including various dinosaurs and crocodyliforms as well as mammals, found by the team of David W. Krause since 1993. Many of these taxa show affinities with similarly aged South American and Indian animals, also parts of Gondwana. The mammalian fauna consists of several taxa known only by isolated teeth and a single reasonably complete skeleton, none {{of which can be}} plausibly related to the Recent Madagascar fauna (see list of mammals of Madagascar). The fossils come from the Maastrichtian (latest Cretaceous) of the Anembalembo Member of the Maevarano Formation.|$|E
