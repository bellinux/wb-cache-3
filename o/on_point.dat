5|$|A {{battalion}} of the 3rd Parachute Division, {{along with an}} armoured regiment of the 1st SS Panzer Division, now joined {{the assault on the}} ridge. At 14:00 the 8th Infantry Battalion on the ridge's northern slopes once more came under attack. Although the infantry and armour closing in on the Polish positions were eventually repulsed, with a large number of prisoners being taken and artillery again causing significant casualties, the Poles were being gradually pushed back. However, they managed to retain their grip <b>on</b> <b>Point</b> 262N and with well-coordinated artillery fire continued to exact a toll on German units traversing the corridor. Another attempt was made to organise an attack towards Point 239 but the Germans were ready and the 9th Infantry Battalion's 3rd Company was driven back with heavy losses.|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} 1857, {{the need for}} a {{lighthouse}} <b>on</b> <b>Point</b> Stephens was identified, due to the proximity to the entrance of Port Stephens, and the dangers of the local coastline to ships. Another reason was that mariners were mistaking the entrance to Fingal Bay for that of Port Stephens. At least twenty four vessels are known to have been wrecked in the area. the most serious being the Dove in 1828 with the loss of seven lives, and the Pandora in 1836 with five lives. Another notable wreck was the Florence Irving in 1877.|$|E
5|$|Moving up from Chambois, the Polish 1st Armoured Division's {{reconnaissance}} regiment made {{an attempt}} to reach their comrades <b>on</b> <b>Point</b> 262N but was mistakenly fired upon by the ridge's defenders.

The Canadian Grenadier Guards reached the ridge just over an hour later, having fought {{for more than five}} hours and accounted for two Panthers, a Panzer IV, and two self-propelled guns along their route. By 14:00, {{with the arrival of the}} first supply convoy, the position was relieved.|$|E
5|$|Nina Gold and Robert Sterne are the series' primary casting directors. Through {{a process}} of auditions and readings, the main cast was assembled.

Other actors signed for the pilot were Kit Harington as Jon Snow, Jack Gleeson as Joffrey Baratheon, Harry Lloyd as Viserys Targaryen and Mark Addy as Robert Baratheon. Addy was, according to showrunners Benioff and Weiss, the easiest actor to cast for the show, being that his audition was <b>on</b> <b>point.</b> Catelyn Stark {{was scheduled to be}} played by Jennifer Ehle, but the role was recast with Michelle Fairley. Daenerys Targaryen was also recast, with Emilia Clarke replacing Tamzin Merchant. The rest of the first season's cast was filled {{in the second half of}} 2009.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of November 24, the ROK 1st Infantry Division {{advanced}} towards the town of Taechon with its 11th and 12th Infantry Regiment <b>on</b> <b>point.</b> Although Chinese booby traps and mortar fire tried to delay the Koreans along the way, the 1st Infantry Division still managed to envelop the town by the dusk of November 24. But unknown to the Koreans, the 1st Infantry Division was marching into a Chinese assembly area, and the resistance around Taechon immediately increased as the result. On the night of November 24, the defending PVA 66th Corps counterattacked the Koreans with infantry and cavalry charges, and the Chinese and Korean troops were soon locked in a seesaw battle from November 25 to 26.|$|E
5|$|Rather than {{allowing}} {{himself to}} be paroled, Hogun requested he be taken prisoner, and was interned at the British prison camp at Haddrel's Point <b>on</b> <b>Point</b> Pleasant, located {{in what is now}} Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, across from Sullivan's Island. Hogun's decision was based, in part, on his desire to stifle the recruiting efforts of the British, who sought to enlist captured Continental soldiers to serve in the British West Indies. The British, however, held only the officers at Haddrel's Point, deciding to house the enlisted men in barracks in Charleston.|$|E
5|$|The next day, the {{squadron}} patrolled the Sidi Rezegh and Gambut escarpments, driving off German tanks and infantry {{in the afternoon}} and incurring vehicle and crew losses. The German column turned north during the night, attacking the divisional headquarters from the east. The four Stuart tanks repulsed the assault; 2 and 5 Troops attempted to regain the New Zealand field hospital, which had been captured the night before. They withdrew, narrowly escaping encirclement by German tanks from the 15th Panzer Division. When the remnants of the 21st Battalion were destroyed <b>on</b> <b>Point</b> 175, the New Zealand Division rear was shelled. The Italian Ariete Armoured Division attacked on 30 November and were repulsed by the divisional artillery. During the afternoon, the 24th Battalion and most of the 26th were overrun by the 15th Panzer Division.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} days of World War II, some maps showed the western {{terminus}} of US 80 at the Cabrillo National Monument <b>on</b> <b>Point</b> Loma, running north on Catalina Boulevard, north then east on Cañon Street, northeast on Rosecrans Street, southeast on Lytton Street, east on Barnett Avenue, south on Pacific Highway (US 101) and finally east on Market Street, before continuing north along Park Boulevard to El Cajon Boulevard. US 395 ran concurrently along the route from downtown San Diego to the intersection with Fairmount Avenue. By 1942, the US 395 concurrency had been removed. With the completion of the Cabrillo Freeway, between 1946 and 1948, US 80 shifted from Park Boulevard to 11th Avenue north onto the new freeway before continuing east onto El Cajon Boulevard towards La Mesa. The final San Diego alignment, with signs to be placed in 1954, moved the western terminus to the intersection with US 101 where it traveled east on what was known as Camino del Rio and Alvarado Canyon Road, and then continuing on the Mission Valley road towards La Mesa. According to Caltrans district engineer Jacob Dekema, during the 1950s, the parts of Camino Del Rio and Rosecrans Street from Lytton Street and Rosecrans Street to Pacific Highway were considered a part of US 80.|$|E
5|$|MD 5 begins within Point Lookout State Park in St. Mary's County by {{heading west}} <b>on</b> <b>Point</b> Lookout Road, a two-lane {{undivided}} road which continues south from the route’s southern terminus {{along the shoreline}} of the Chesapeake Bay to the confluence with the Potomac River. The route turns north, passing a fee booth for the park at the entrance before continuing into wooded areas. A short distance later, the road makes a left turn and heads northwest through a mix of woodland and farmland. MD 5 passes through Scotland and continues north through more agricultural areas with intermittent residences. It reaches Ridge, where MD 5 intersects the southern terminus of MD 235 (Three Notch Road). From here, the road heads into more wooded areas. MD 5 passes through agricultural and residential areas before turning northwest and entering St. Mary's City. Here, the route makes a turn to the north, with MD 584 looping {{to the west of}} the route through the center of St. Mary's City. The road runs long the shore of the St. Marys River and passes near St. Mary's College of Maryland before leaving St. Mary's City had heading into forested areas. It reaches Park Hall, where MD 5 intersects MD 489 (Park Hall Road).|$|E
5|$|Of the {{approximately}} 20 German infantry and armoured divisions {{trapped in the}} Falaise pocket around 12 were still operating {{with a degree of}} combat-effectiveness. As these formations retreated eastwards they fought desperately to keep the jaws of the encirclement—formed by the Canadians in Trun and St. Lambert, and the Poles and Americans in Chambois—from closing. German movement out of the pocket throughout the night of 19 August cut off the Polish battlegroups on the Mont Ormel ridge. On discovering this Stefanowicz conferred with Koszutski. Lacking sufficient means to either seal the pocket or fight their way clear, the two decided that the only chance of survival for their force was to hold fast until relieved. Although the Polish soldiers <b>on</b> <b>Point</b> 262N could hear movement from the valley below, other than some mortar rounds that landed among the positions of the 8th Infantry Battalion the night passed uneventfully. Without possession of Point 262S the Poles were unable to interfere with the large numbers of German troops slipping past the southern slopes of the ridge. The uneven, wooded terrain, interspersed with thick hedgerows, made control of the ground to the west and southwest difficult by day and impossible by night. As it grew light on 20 August Szydłowski prepared to fulfil his orders of the previous day and organised two companies of his 9th Infantry Battalion, supported by the 1st Armoured Regiment, for an attack across the road towards Point 262S. However, hampered by the wreckage littering the pass the attack soon bogged down in the face of fierce German resistance.|$|E

5|$|Operation Atlantic, {{launched}} on 18July alongside Goodwood, had {{the objectives of}} securing the western bank of the Orne River and Verrières Ridge. The 2nd Division's 5th and 6th Brigades were selected as the assaulting forces, with the 5th Brigade focusing on the Orne and the 6th on Verrières. The 4th Brigade were tasked with securing the flank of the operation, and the Royal Regiment of Canada attacked Louvigny on 18July. Early on 19July, the Calgary Highlanders seized Point 67, directly north of Verrières Ridge, and the following morning the Royal Highland Regiment of Canada crossed the Orne River and secured the flanks of the advance. In the afternoon, the 6th Brigade's South Saskatchewan Regiment attacked the well-entrenched German positions on the ridge, with support from Typhoon fighter-bombers and tanks. However, the attack ran into torrential rain, and the Germans counterattacked in force. This and further German attacks inflicted heavy casualties on the South Saskatchewan Regiment and its supporting battalions, the Essex Scottish Regiment and the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders of Canada. On 21July, the 5th Canadian Infantry Brigade reinforced Canadian positions <b>on</b> <b>Point</b> 67. In two days of fighting, the division suffered 1,349 casualties.|$|E
