In three-firm linear <b>oligopolies,</b> monopoly will be formed (or be stable) if its merging cost is sufficiently low and cost differentials are sufficiently large. When monopoly is unprofitable {{due to high}} merging costs, a profitable two-member merger will be formed if its efficient member receives a sufficiently large share of the merger’s gain and cost differentials are sufficiently small. In n-firm linear <b>oligopolies,</b> monopoly will be formed if number of firms and merging costs both are sufficiently small and cost differentials are sufficiently large...|$|R

We provide new results about the semi-uniqueness and uniqueness of (Cournot) equilibria for the <b>oligopolies</b> that satisfy these conditions. The condition of concave integrated price flexibility is implied by (but does not imply) the log-concavity of a continuous decreasing price function. So, our results generalize previous results for decreasing log-concave price functions and convex cost functions. We also discuss the particular type of quasi-concavity that characterizes the conditional revenue and profit functions of the firms in these <b>oligopolies</b> and we point out an error {{of the literature on}} the equilibrium uniqueness in <b>oligopolies</b> with log-concave price functions.

25|$|In microeconomics, the Bertrand–Edgeworth {{model of}} price-setting <b>oligopoly</b> looks at {{what happens when}} there is a {{homogeneous}} product (i.e. consumers want to buy from the cheapest seller) where {{there is a limit to}} the output of firms which they are willing and able to sell at a particular price. This differs from the Bertrand competition model where it is assumed that firms are willing and able to meet all demand. The limit to output can be considered as a physical capacity constraint which is the same at all prices (as in Edgeworth’s work), or to vary with price under other assumptions.|$|E
25|$|Other {{causes of}} {{perceived}} insulation from risk may derive from a given entity's predominance {{in a market}} relative to other players, and not from state intervention or market regulation. A firm – or several large firms acting in concert (see cartel, <b>oligopoly</b> and collusion) – with very large holdings and capital reserves could instigate a market bubble by investing heavily in a given asset, creating a relative scarcity which drives up that asset's price. Because of the signaling power of the large firm or group of colluding firms, the firm's smaller competitors will follow suit, similarly investing in the asset due to its price gains.|$|E
25|$|Even before {{becoming}} {{a president of the}} American Economic Association, Galbraith was considered as an iconoclast by many economists. This is partly because he rejected the technical analysis and mathematical modelling of neoclassical economics as being divorced from reality. Following Thorstein Veblen, he believed that economic activity could not be distilled into inviolable laws, but rather was a complex product of the cultural and political milieu in which it occurs. In particular, he posited that important factors, such as the separation between corporate ownership and management, <b>oligopoly,</b> and the influence of government and military spending had been largely neglected by most economists because they are not amenable to axiomatic descriptions. In this sense, he worked as much in political economy as in classical economics.|$|E

25|$|The Nash {{equilibrium}} {{was named}} after American mathematician John Forbes Nash, Jr. A version of the Nash equilibrium concept was first known {{to be used in}} 1838 by Antoine Augustin Cournot in his theory of <b>oligopoly.</b> In Cournot's theory, firms choose how much output to produce to maximize their own profit. However, the best output for one firm depends on the outputs of others. A Cournot equilibrium occurs when each firm's output maximizes its profits given the output of the other firms, which is a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium. Cournot also introduced the concept of best response dynamics in his analysis of the stability of equilibrium. However, Nash's definition of equilibrium is broader than Cournot's. It is also broader than the definition of a Pareto-efficient equilibrium, since the Nash definition makes no judgements about the optimality of the equilibrium being generated.|$|E
25|$|This kind of fable made Mattei {{extremely}} {{popular in the}} economically poor Italy of the time, and he gained the popular support that was needed to gain political support.

Mattei visited Moscow in 1959, where he brokered an oil import deal with the Soviet Union {{in the middle of the}} Cold War over intense protests from NATO and the U.S. He also publicly supported independence movements against colonial powers, which allowed ENI to take advantage of postcolonial bitterness in places like Algeria. To opponents who charged that he was helping Communists and making Italy dependent on a capricious flow from the Soviet Union, Mattei answered that he bought from the cheapest sources.|$|E

Under the revised proposal, the four studios would each own a 22.58% stake in the two networks, with American Express owning a 9.68% minority interest. In addition, the consortium would appoint a management team separate from those employed by the two channels – which would continue to operate as separate services – to operate the joint venture. However, the deal ran into regulatory hurdles since Warner, Universal and Paramount received 50% of their respective total revenue from film releases and licensing fees from premium services; furthermore, Showtime and TMC combined would control about 30% of the pay cable marketplace, creating an <b>oligopoly</b> with HBO (which, in conjunction with Cinemax, controlled 60% of the market).|$|E

500|$|Cournot, a {{professor}} of mathematics, developed a mathematical treatment in 1838 for duopoly—a market condition defined by competition between two sellers. [...] This treatment of competition, first published in Researches into the Mathematical Principles of Wealth, {{is referred to as}} Cournot duopoly. It is assumed that both sellers had equal access to the market and could produce their goods without cost. [...] Further, it assumed that both goods were homogeneous. [...] Each seller would vary her output based on the output of the other and the market price would be determined by the total quantity supplied. [...] The profit for each firm would be determined by multiplying their output and the per unit Market price. [...] Differentiating the profit function with respect to quantity supplied for each firm left a system of linear equations, the simultaneous solution of which gave the equilibrium quantity, price and profits. Cournot's contributions to the mathematization of economics would be neglected for decades, but eventually influenced many of the marginalists. [...] Cournot's models of duopoly and <b>Oligopoly</b> also represent one of the first formulations of non-cooperative games. [...] Today the solution can be given as a Nash equilibrium but Cournot's work preceded modern game theory by over 100 years.|$|E
