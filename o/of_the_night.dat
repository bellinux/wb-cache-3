5|$|Giant mouse lemurs begin {{foraging}} {{moments before}} the sun disappears, occasionally participate in social activities during the last half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>night,</b> and return {{to one of their}} nests prior to sunrise. Cold temperatures cause them to leave the nest later and return early, sometime during the second half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>night.</b> During the first half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>night,</b> giant mouse lemurs are more likely to rest for an hour or more, usually at the expense of social activities, but not feeding time. Rest periods are longer when temperatures are low. Unlike many other cheirogaleids, they remain active all year and do not enter daily or seasonal torpor.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the second half, the Terrapins kicked off to the Seminoles before both teams traded field goals. It would be the only points Maryland would muster all night. In the fourth quarter, Florida State added another field goal. On the next possession, Maryland running back Da'Rel Scott and receiver Darrius Heyward-Bey both made short runs for a first down. Scott lost his second fumble <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> on the Terrapin 43-yard line. Florida State took over and scored another touchdown. After Maryland went three-and-out, Seminoles kicker Graham Gano made his third field goal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>night.</b>|$|E

40|$|Bound Infinities : Scheherazade's Moral Matrix <b>of</b> <b>The</b> 1001 Nights" is {{the first}} study that {{positions}} <b>the</b> multiple variants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nights</b> as separate texts, and ones that should be treated in literary studies as such. This is an important notion because <b>the</b> <b>Nights</b> has long been seen as one insufficiently defined work of literature. By researching each variant on its own merits much more literary and cultural history is revealed, and new, richer understandings of postcolonial, translation and semiotic studies are highlighted. This dissertation looks through <b>the</b> lens <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nights</b> via an examination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> oldest "G-manuscript" <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nights</b> and its sexualized contents, paratextual amendments <b>of</b> <b>the</b> European <b>Nights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 19 th century by Edward Lane and Richard Burton, fantastical elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 18 th century Galland version and its English translation known as "Grub Street", film versions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 20 th century, and orientalist and postcolonial theory. I argue, in part, that orientalism has been so often misapplied to <b>the</b> <b>Nights</b> that it has wrongly embedded it into a discourse that obscures its identity. I end with an examination of a modernist "version" <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nights</b> : James Joyce's Ulysses. My overall intent is to clarify what <b>the</b> <b>Nights</b> is, detach it from misapplied orientalist discourse, and to demand an elucidation in future Nights studies that specific versions and their idiosyncratic identities are addressed as a primary focus of any study involving <b>the</b> <b>Nights.</b> <b>The</b> study intersects with semiotics, cognitive linguistics, film studies, translation studies, psychoanalysis and postcolonial theory but its main goal is to resituate <b>the</b> <b>Nights</b> into a truly transnational context unfettered by a culturally embedded identit...|$|R
