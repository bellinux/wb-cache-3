5|$|According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Penda became king in 626, ruled for 30 years, and was 50 {{years old}} at the time <b>of</b> <b>his</b> accession. That he ruled for 30 years should not be taken as an exact figure, since the same source says he died in 655, which would not {{correspond}} to the year given for the beginning <b>of</b> <b>his</b> reign unless he died in the thirtieth year <b>of</b> <b>his</b> reign. Furthermore, that Penda was truly 50 {{years old at}} the beginning <b>of</b> <b>his</b> reign is generally doubted by historians, mainly because of the ages <b>of</b> <b>his</b> children. The idea that Penda, at about 80 years of age, would have left behind children who were still young (his son Wulfhere was still just a youth three years after Penda's death, according to Bede) has been widely considered implausible. The possibility has been suggested that the Chronicle actually meant to say that Penda was 50 {{years old at the}} time <b>of</b> <b>his</b> death, and therefore about 20 in 626.|$|E
5|$|According to the Board, Grissom {{suffered}} severe third degree {{burns on}} over one-third <b>of</b> <b>his</b> body and his spacesuit was mostly destroyed. White suffered third degree burns on almost half <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{body and a}} quarter <b>of</b> <b>his</b> spacesuit had melted away. Chaffee suffered third degree burns over almost a quarter <b>of</b> <b>his</b> body and a small portion <b>of</b> <b>his</b> spacesuit was damaged. The autopsy report confirmed that {{the primary cause of}} death for all three astronauts was cardiac arrest caused by high concentrations of carbon monoxide. Burns suffered by the crew were not believed to be major factors, and it was concluded that most of them had occurred postmortem. Asphyxiation happened after the fire melted the astronauts' suits and oxygen tubes, exposing them to the lethal atmosphere of the cabin.|$|E

5|$|Adler's memoirs were {{published}} in the New York socialist Yiddish-language newspaper Die Varheit in 1916–1919, and briefly resumed in 1925 in an unsuccessful revival of that paper; his granddaughter Lulla Rosenfeld's English translation was published only in 1999. The 1916–1919 portion of the memoir gives a detailed picture <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Russian years. The 1925 portion gives a comparably detailed picture <b>of</b> <b>his</b> time in London, although with some evasions around the relative timing <b>of</b> <b>his</b> relationships with his wife Sonya and with Jennya Kaiser and Dinah Shtettin. It contains only a relatively fragmentary description <b>of</b> <b>his</b> New York career. In the English-language book of these memoirs, Rosenfeld attempts to fill the gaps with her own commentary.|$|E

During {{his time in the}} commentary booth, he was known for his self-deprecating humour and frequently made fun <b>of</b> <b>his</b> conservative approach to batting during the latter half <b>of</b> <b>his</b> career. Hassett was known for his disapproval of some of the aspects of the modern evolution of cricket, particularly the more aggressive player conduct that contrasted with the more sedate and gentlemanly style <b>of</b> <b>his</b> era.|$|E
