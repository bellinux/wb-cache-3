5|$|James de Connick {{established}} the first breed {{standard for the}} French Spaniel in 1891. At {{the turn of the}} 20th century, the numbers of French Spaniels dropped so low that they nearly became extinct due to competition from foreign sporting dogs, in particular as French hunters chose to hunt particularly with English breeds of hunting dogs. A French priest named Father Fournier undertook the task of gathering the remaining French Spaniels in his Saint Hillaire kennels in order to preserve the breed. There he built the lineages that are representatives <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>we</b> now have. The French Spaniel Club was founded in 1921, with Father Fournier {{as the president of the}} association. The modern French Spaniel is one of a group of recognised French Spaniels, including the Brittany, Picardy and Blue Picardy.|$|E
500|$|There {{are very}} few extant sources of {{information}} on the individual trobairitz. Almost all information which exists about them come from their vidas (biographies) and razós (contextual explanations of the songs), the brief descriptions that were assembled in song collections called chansonniers. The vidas are notoriously unreliable, since they frequently consisted of little more than romanticized extrapolations from the poems of the trobairitz themselves. The names of about twenty female poets from the 12th and 13th centuries survive, with an estimated thirty-two works attributed to the trobairitz. There are about 5 percent as many trobairitz as there are troubadours, and the number of surviving compositions by trobairitz amounts to around 1 percent <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>we</b> have by the troubadours. The earliest surviving lyric written by a trobairitz is that of Bels dous amics, written by Tibors around 1150. Only one survives with musical notation intact, [...] "A chantar" [...] by Comtessa de Diá (see below). Some works which are anonymous in the sources are ascribed by certain modern editors to women, as are some works which are attributed to men in the manuscripts. For comparison, of the 460 male troubadours, about 2600 of their poems survive. Of these, about one in 10 survive with musical notation intact. Only two trobairitz have left us with more than one song apiece. Those two women are Comtessa de Dia, who leaves us with four cansos, and Castelloza, with three cansos and a fourth that is anonymous.|$|E
2500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film {{two and a}} half stars out of four, saying [...] "its audience, which takes these films very seriously indeed, will drink deeply of its blood. The sensational closing {{sequence}} cannot be accused of leaving a single loophole, not even some <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>we</b> didn't know were there". However, he concluded by saying, [...] ""Breaking Dawn, Part 2" [...] must be one of the more serious entries in any major movie franchise... it bit the bullet, and I imagine fans will be pleased." [...] Helen O'Hara of Empire gave the film a mixed review and said, [...] "Fans will be left on a high; other viewers will be confused but generally entertained by a saga whose romance is matched only by its weirdness".|$|E

2500|$|Strangely, Luther {{does not}} seem to have known much about his older brother, Daniel Isaac Gotwald. He was a printer who died in Cincinnati, Ohio in 1849 when he was 21. Luther says of him that [...] "He was, I think, noble and upright in all his deportment, respectful and happy in his disposition, and a genial {{favorite}} among all who knew him. [...] At the time of his death, several of the Cincinnati papers spoke very favorably of him." [...] Luther admits that he does not even know whether Daniel Isaac was a Christian, but continued that [...] "Fervently do I hope that he was, for it is a dreadful thought that any <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>we</b> love, and especially one so dear as a Brother, should be called unprepared, from time into eternity, there to suffer forever for the misdeeds of this life." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 10 November 1944, Churchill flew to Paris to a {{reception}} by de Gaulle {{and the two}} together were greeted by thousands of cheering Parisians on the next day. Harold Nicolson stated that Anthony Eden told him that [...] "not for one moment did Winston stop crying, {{and that he could}} have filled buckets by the time he received the Freedom of Paris." [...] He said [...] "they yelled for Churchill in a way that he has never heard any crowd yell before. At an official luncheon de Gaulle said, [...] "It is true that we would not have seen [...] if our old and gallant ally England, and all the British dominions under precisely the impulsion and inspiration <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>we</b> are honouring today, had not deployed the extraordinary determination to win, and that magnificent courage which saved the freedom of the world. There is no French man or woman who is not touched to the depths of their hearts and souls by this." ...|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{their arrival}} at Elstree Studios, Wendy Carlos and Rachel Elkind were shown {{the first version}} of the film by Kubrick: [...] "The film was a little on the long side. There were great gobs of scenes that never made it to the film. There was a whole strange and mystical scene in which Jack Nicholson discovers objects that have been {{arranged}} in his working space in the ballroom with arrows and things. He walks down and thinks he hears a voice and a ghost throws a ball back to him. None of that made it to the final film. We scored a lot <b>of</b> <b>those.</b> <b>We</b> didn't know what was going to be used for sure". Carlos has said that she was so disillusioned by Kubrick's actions that she vowed never to work with him again. Her own music was released in its near entirety in 2005 as part of her Rediscovering Lost Scores compilation.|$|E

2500|$|Her {{first book}} was the nonfiction memoir Fighting Fire, {{published}} in 1998. Her second, the 2006 historical novel East Wind, Rain {{is based on}} the Niihau Incident, a historical event in which a Japanese pilot crash-landed on the private Hawaiian island of Niihau, after the attack on Pearl Harbor. [...] "When it's over, we don't want to leave," [...] said the New York Times review of the book. Lost Cat, A True Story of Love, Desperation, and GPS Technology was published in 2013 and illustrated by her partner, artist Wendy MacNaughton. It details Paul and MacNaughton's high-tech search for their cat. The PBS Newshour described the book as [...] "A thoughtful, kind and funny story about the love people can have for their pets and the weird places that this love and accompanying devotion can take them. But it also travels beyond the realm of human-pet relationships, offering commentary on all relationships and the roles <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>we</b> love, and sometimes don't love, in our lives." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{tongue twister}} [...] "Çekoslovakyalılaştıramadıklarımızdan mısınız" [...] {{is often said}} to be the longest word in Turkish, despite in written form {{appearing}} to be two separate words.
