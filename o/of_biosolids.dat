5|$|Mining in the creek's {{watershed}} {{began in}} 1844. A number of mining villages {{existed in the}} Tangascootack Creek watershed between 1845 and 1870. In the mid-1850s the Farrandsville Iron Company purchased large amounts of land in several places, including along Tangascootack Creek. In 1870 all of the mines in the area closed and lumbering became the area's most significant industry, with millions of board feet being floated downstream. The railroad tracks were removed and the mine buildings were abandoned or burned down. However, deep mining of the Clarion coal formation and the Lower Kittaning coal formation in the Tangascootack Creek watershed began in the 1800s and continued into the early 1900s. Strip mining operations began in the 1950s and 1960s, {{with some of the}} deep mines and surface mines being remined in the 1980s. The Independent Regulatory Review Commission issued a statement in the summer of 1987, saying that part of the North Fork Tangascootack Creek watershed was no longer suitable for surface mining. Treatment of the watershed began as early as 1998. Several projects devoted to improving the water quality of the creek had begun by 2001, by which point several more projects were planned. At least one of these projects involves the use <b>of</b> <b>biosolids</b> to encourage vegetation growth.|$|E

EPA created an Intra-Agency Sludge Task Force to aid in developing comprehensive sludge regulations that are designed to do the following: (1) Conduct a multimedia examination of sewage sludge management, focusing on sewage sludge generated by POTWs; and (2) develop a cohesive Agency policy on sewage sludge management, designed to guide the Agency in implementing sewage sludge regulatory and management programs.|$|E

These were amended with biosolids at the amounts of 15 and 30 Mg ha- 1 and incubated for 60 days under controlled conditions of moisture and temperature. Four domestic biosolids {{were obtained from the}} monofill at one of the Santiago wastewater treatment plants. Biosolid and soil sequential extraction was performed according to the procedure recommended by BCR, which considers four extractions to obtain an acid-soluble fraction (exchangeable, carbonates), a reducible fraction (iron/manganese oxides), an oxidizable fraction (organic matter and sulfides) and the residual one. Trace metals were determined by flame atomic absorption spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Among the metals determined in biosolids, Zn had the highest concentration. Total trace metal contents found, except for Ni in some biosolids, was below the limits allowed by the Chilean regulation for biosolids. In general, without considering the residual fraction, the metals were found predominantly as reducible and oxidizable fractions. A multifactorial design was applied to assess the effects <b>of</b> <b>biosolid</b> application amounts, biosolid type and incubation time. Biosolid incorporation at the amount of 30 Mg ha- 1 produced an increase in Zn and Ni availability in all soils and Cu in most of them, while Cr, and Pb showed no significant variations.

40|$|Abstract. The impact <b>of</b> <b>biosolid</b> {{and soil}} type on the {{movement}} of faecal coliforms through the vadose zone was investigated following the application of animal manure to soil. Two types <b>of</b> <b>biosolid,</b> solid and liquid manure, were applied to two soil types at {{a wide range of}} initial water contents. Bacteria present in the soil solution were collected using calibrated ceramic-porous-cup samplers. Estimated bacterial migration velocities in the soil profile were consistent with the hypo-thesis that bacteria move mostly through soil macropores, as the rate of transport was faster than the average pore-water velocity. Macropore transport was more likely to occur in wet soils, but it was not necessarily restricted to soils with high initial soil water content. A larger soil clay content, lower total soil porosity, and lower saturated hydraulic conductivity resulted in a greater likelihood that suspended bacteria would be funnelled through pores of larger diameter and faster pore water velocity, increasing the potential vertical transport length of bacteria through the vadose zone. Total porosity was not a significant factor in enhancing deep transport of faecal bacteria. The potential of faecal bacteria to be transported to depth in soil was correlated with the water content of the manure. We conclude that application of animal manure to soil can readily lead to groundwater contamination with faecal bacteria especially under moist soil conditions, and that macropores are important in the transport...|$|R

Seven soils, typifying the span of properties and formation environments encountered in Israel, were incubated with and without biosolids for 7 yr, and changes in organic carbon (OC) content and labile Cu concentration were determined. Isotopic exchange techniques, using 64 Cu, and ion activity measurements, using a Cu 2 + ion selective electrode, revealed that the available Cu concentration remained relatively low and stable over the 7 -yr incubation.

40|$|The {{wastewater}} treatment process generates {{large amounts of}} sewage sludge that are dried and then often stored in biosolid stockpiles in treatment plants. Because the biosolids are rich in decomposable organic matter they could be a significant source for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, yet there are no direct measurements of GHG from stockpiles. We therefore measured the direct emissions of methane (CH 4), nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and carbon dioxide (CO 2) {{on a monthly basis}} from three different age classes <b>of</b> <b>biosolid</b> stockpiles at the Western Treatment Plant (WTP), Melbourne, Australia, from December 2009 to November 2011 using manual static chambers. All biosolid stockpiles were a significant point source for CH 4 and N 2 O emissions. The youngest biosolids (< 1 year old) had the greatest CH 4 and N 2 O emissions of 60. 2  kg of CO 2 -e per Mg <b>of</b> <b>biosolid</b> per year. Stockpiles that were between 1 and 3 years old emitted less overall GHG (∼ 29  kg CO 2 -e Mg(- 1)  yr(- 1)) and the oldest stockpiles emitted the least GHG (∼ 10  kg CO 2 -e Mg(- 1)  yr(- 1)). Methane emissions were negligible in all stockpiles but the relative contribution of N 2 O and CO 2 changed with stockpile age. The youngest stockpile emitted two thirds of the GHG emission as N 2 O, while the 1 - 3 year old stockpile emitted an equal amount of N 2 O and CO 2 and in the oldest stockpile CO 2 emissions dominated. We did not detect any seasonal variability of GHG emissions and did not observe a correlation between GHG flux and environmental variables such as biosolid temperature, moisture content or nitrate and ammonium concentration. We also modeled CH 4 emissions based on a first order decay model and the model based estimated annual CH 4 emissions were higher as compared to the direct field based estimated annual CH 4 emissions. Our results indicate that labile organic material in stockpiles is decomposed over time and that nitrogen decomposition processes lead to significant N 2 O emissions. Carbon decomposition favors CO 2 over CH 4 production probably because of aerobic stockpile conditions or CH 4 oxidation in the outer stockpile layers. Although the GHG emission rate decreased with <b>biosolid</b> age, managers <b>of</b> <b>biosolid</b> stockpiles should assess alternate storage or uses for biosolids to avoid nutrient losses and GHG emissions.
