500|$|Confessions on a Dance Floor is a full-on dance, {{electronic}} and disco record, which is structured like a nightly set composed by a DJ. The music starts out light and happy, {{and as it}} progresses, it becomes intense, with the lyrics dealing more about personal feelings, hence [...] "Confessions". According to Madonna, [...] "his is the direction of my record. That's what we intended, to make a record that you can play at a party <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> car, where you don't have to skip past a ballad. It's nonstop." [...] Madonna used samples and references of music by other disco artists. In the album's first song, [...] "Hung Up", she sampled ABBA's 1979 hit [...] "Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)", for which she wrote a personal letter to songwriters Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus, who gave Madonna {{permission to use the}} track. References of other disco-influenced acts, including Pet Shop Boys, Depeche Mode, and Daft Punk, were also used on the album, as were the disco hits of Parisian DJ Cerrone. The album has a song called [...] "Forbidden Love", which is different from the same titled song from Madonna's sixth studio album Bedtime Stories. Regarding sampling herself and her own song names, Madonna commented: ...|$|E

All the things that happen in a race or happen in a championship <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> life, there is maybe a reason behind. And that reason is because better times are coming, and I prefer to think that way." ...|$|E

[...] Later in life, she corresponded with Gustave Flaubert, and despite their differences in temperament and aesthetic preference, they eventually became close friends. She {{engaged in an}} intimate friendship with actress Marie Dorval, which led to widespread but unconfirmed rumours of a lesbian affair. Letters written by Sand to Dorval made such references as [...] "wanting you either in your dressing room <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> bed." ...|$|E

2500|$|Palin {{later said}} that her death panel remark had been [...] "vindicated" [...] and that the {{policies}} of Emanuel are [...] "particularly disturbing" [...] and [...] "shocking". [...] On former Senator Fred Thompson's radio program, McCaughey warned that [...] "the healthcare reform bill would make it mandatory—absolutely require—that every five years people in Medicare have a required counseling session that will tell them how to end their life sooner." [...] She said those sessions would help the elderly learn how to [...] "decline nutrition, how to decline being hydrated, how to go in to hospice care ... all to do what's in society's best interest <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> family's best interest and cut your life short." [...] As The New York Times mentioned, conservative pundits were comparing the Nazi T4 euthanasia program to Obama’s policies {{as far back as}} November 2008, calling them [...] "America's T4 program—trivialization of abortion, acceptance of euthanasia, and the normalization of physician assisted suicide." ...|$|E
2500|$|In July 2009, McCaughey {{claimed that}} a {{section in the}} pending {{healthcare}} legislation, [...] "Advance Care Planning Consultation", actually prescribed [...] "euthanasia for the elderly" [...] because it included provisions that:would make it mandatory — absolutely require — that every five years people in Medicare have a required counseling session that will tell them how to end their life sooner [...] decline nutrition, how to decline being hydrated, how to go in to hospice care ... all to do what's in society's best interest <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> family's best interest and cut your life short.McCaughey's choice of words and analysis were described by The Atlantics James Fallows as inaccurate and sensationalistic. Politifact responded that the end-of-life counseling was voluntary, calling McCaughey's claim a [...] "ridiculous falsehood" [...] and giving it their lowest accuracy rating, [...] "pants on fire". Factcheck.org called the claims [...] "nonsense" [...] and stated that what that section of the bill would actually do is [...] "require Medicare to pay for voluntary counseling sessions helping seniors to plan for end-of-life medical care, including designating a health care proxy, choosing a hospice and making decisions about life-sustaining treatment." [...] During an appearance on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart which aired on August 20, 2009, McCaughey repeated these assertions about the counselling sessions and referred to the Factcheck.org as [...] "spot-check dot org", claiming they failed to adequately read the House health care bill. In a rebuttal, Factcheck.org stood by their analysis and provided further analysis, which led them to conclude that McCaughey had misinterpreted the bill.|$|E

Lady Constance is usually introduced by a statement {{along the lines}} of [...] "what is that coming towards us? – It's huge – It's a rhinoceros!" [...] – [...] "No, it's me!!!" [...] and this is often accompanied by a rousing rendition of [...] "Happy Days Are Here Again", and always by rousing cheers from the audience. Her size is legendary; in the [...] "Henry VIII" [...] sketch, Katharine of Aragon and Lady Constance (masquerading as Anne of Cleavage) fight a duel to decide who is to be Queen. [...] Brooke-Taylor introduces her in the style of a boxing MC: [...] "..and in the blue corner, at 15 hundredweight, your own, your very own – and there's enough to go round – twice -...". [...] In the [...] "Dentisti" [...] sketch, a parody on the 1960s TV series Daktari, Lady Constance plays (appropriately) an elephant; and in [...] "Jack The Ripper", Lady Constance is invited to: [...] "please, sit down anywhere ... <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> case, everywhere". In the [...] "Radio Prune Greek Tragedy" [...] sketch, she plays the mother of Oedipus Rex – according to the Oracle, she was hoping for a dog – and [...] she tells Oedipus: [...] "Now let me get on with my housework, I've got a little behind [...]." [...] (pause for the double-entendre to register) [...] ".. oh all right, I've got a colossal behind!!" [...] In the [...] "Colditz" [...] sketch, the lads' escape route is through the plug hole of her bath, and Bill Oddie exclaims [...] "She's like a ruddy great iceberg: one eighth above the water, 76 eighths below!". She also in her own way {{is a bit of a}} nymphomaniac – she's described in the 25th anniversary show version of [...] "Jack The Ripper" [...] as a steaming volcano of eroticism – and there are frequent references to unfulfilled sexual desire: in the [...] "3.17 to Cleethorpes" [...] sketch, she and the other players in the drama are adrift on a raft in the ocean; Lady Constance offers to take all her clothes off and use them for a sail, and when Hatch says, [...] "Yes, and then what?", Lady Constance replies, [...] "Well, that's rather up to you ...." ...|$|E
