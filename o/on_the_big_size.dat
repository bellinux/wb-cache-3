40|$|Background:Although,different {{studies on}} end-to-side nerve repair, results are controversial. The {{importance}} of this method in case is unavailability of proximal nerve. In this method, donor nerves also remain intact and without injury. In compare to other classic procedures,end-to-side repair is not much time consuming and needs less dissection. Overall, the previous studies in this field have just evaluated nerve recovery by non functional or functional parameters. As it has proven, the results of functional and non functional studies are not always matched. Therefore, {{this study was designed}} to evaluate this method by functional (Sciatic function index) and non functional parameters (histochemical study).   Methods: In this experimental study, forty adult male Wistar rats (200 - 250 g) were used their left proneal nerve was cut and divided into four groups: 1 - control group (n= 10). In this group, nerve was exposed and cut and implanted onto adductor muscles, 2 - end-to-end anastomosis (n= 10). In this group, peroneal nerve cut and two segments were anastomosed end-to-end, 3 - end-to-side anastomosis with window (n= 10). In this group, peroneal nerve was cut and anastomosed with window to tibial nerve, 4 - end-to-side anastomosis without window (n= 10). In this group, peroneal nerve was cut and anastomosed without window to tibial nerve. After 1, 8 and 16 weeks, functional (Sciatic function index) and after 16 weeks non functional studies (histochemical study) were performed and the results compared.   Results: All experimental groups (group 2, 3, 4) motor recovery at 8 th, 16 th week were not statistically different (p> 0. 05). In histological study axons count in end -to-side with window anastomosis were higher than other experimental groups (p< 0. 05).   Conclusion: According to our findings, the authors believe that end to side neuroraphy leads to axon growth and comparable functional recovery with end to end neuroraphy in rat model. Due to the fact that the diameter of nerves and muscles which might be neurotised in human are much bigger and not comparable with rat, it is suggested to set up some set of experiments <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>size</b> animals such as primates in further studies for generalization of results to human being. ...|$|R
40|$|In agriculture, {{anthropometry}} has {{a remarkable}} relevance above all {{in design and}} realization of a tractor cab. The operators spend much time in driving tractors and an uncomfortable cab represents a risk for them. A space too narrow is extremely dangerous in case of overturning, for the collisions with the internal parts of the cab, and it can favour unintentional use of the commands with consequences <b>on</b> <b>the</b> behaviour of the vehicle. This paper is focused on experimental analysis of the internal dimension of tractor cabs. The main goal is to verify the respect of “the least overall dimensions” of the driver (according to UNI EN ISO 3411 standard), calculated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> driver <b>size,</b> corresponding to the internal cab surface with no visible deformation. Measurements {{have been carried out}} on 15 tractors differently dimensioned and aged, later compared to the provided limits, in order to verify the least overall dimensions. The results show that all the cabs, also if approved in accordance with OECD standard, don’t respect one or more parameters provided by the UNI EN ISO 3411 standard.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present an {{adaptive}} split procedure for decomposing an image into a set of squares of different size and its application to image coding. The sub-image contained in each square is approximated in the least mean square sense using polynomial functions. Different algorithms have been established in order to use the separability condition when the approximation is evaluated on a rectangular grid. Starting with a certain set of identical size squares covering the image, the approximation is calculated for each of them. Then, different measurements are performed in order to determine the quality of the approximation inside each square. Whenever this quality is not sufficient, the analysed square is split into four sub-squares of identical size. The same procedure is integrated until the quality is considered good enough. In order to enhance the quality, special smoothing is finally applied <b>on</b> <b>the</b> boundary of <b>big</b> <b>size</b> squares. Examples present the coding efficiency of this type of processing...|$|R
40|$|Background & objectives: Genital Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) {{infections are}} one of the most {{prevalent}} sexually transmitted infections across the world. In pregnant women, if not detected and treated early, these may result in poor pregnancy outcomes and complications. The present study was aimed to screen CT infections from first void urine (FVU) samples of asymptomatic pregnant women using molecular methods. The secondary objective was to evaluate cost-effectiveness in pooling FVU samples for their diagnostic application. Methods: FVU samples were collected from 1000 asymptomatic pregnant women over a period of three years. Pooling was done by including five specimens in one pool in the amount of 10 μl and subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and further confirmed by direct fluorescent antibody assay (DFA). Results: The age of study participants ranged from 18 to 43 yr with the median±standard deviation of 26 ± 3. 84 yr. Majority of positive participants were younger than 25 years. A total of 200 pools were prepared and 20 of these were PCR positive. When individual specimen in 20 positive pools was tested, 20 PCR-positive specimens were identified from 19 pools, of which 16 were positive by DFA. Thus, CT was detected in 1. 6 per cent asymptomatic pregnant women in India and pooling strategy resulted in 70 per cent reduction in a number of tests performed. Interpretation & conclusions: Our study detected C. trachomatis infection in 1. 6 per cent asymptomatic pregnant women, and pooling of FVU specimens for PCR testing was found to be a cost-saving strategy in comparison to testing individual samples. Further evaluation and studies <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bigger</b> sample <b>size</b> are warranted to validate these results...|$|R
30|$|The {{effects of}} filler size and density {{as well as}} {{interphase}} thickness <b>on</b> <b>the</b> characteristics of nanoparticles and the interface/interphase properties were studied by simple equations. Also, the aggregates/agglomerates of nanoparticles were assumed as large particles and their influences <b>on</b> <b>the</b> interphase parameters and the tensile strength of nanocomposites were discussed. The small size and low density cause significant levels for number, surface area, stiffening efficiency, and specific surface area of nanoparticles. Only 2  g of small and well-dispersed nanoparticles (R[*]=[*] 10  nm) with df =[*] 2  g/cm 3 can produce about 250  m 2 interfacial area with polymer matrix. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> other hand, <b>big</b> <b>size</b> and aggregates/agglomerates weaken the positive attributes of nanoparticles in nanocomposites. Small nanoparticles and thick interphase present the high levels for B parameter, tensile strength, interphase volume fraction, and a interphase parameter. B decreases to below 3 when the size of nanoparticles grows to about 40  nm and the interphase thickness reduces to less than 10  nm. However, B[*]=[*] 13 is obtained by the smallest nanoparticles (R[*]=[*] 10  nm) and the thickest interphase (t[*]=[*] 25  nm). This occurrence confirms that the interfacial/interphase properties depend <b>on</b> <b>the</b> nanoparticle size beside the interfacial interaction/adhesion. Additionally, large nanoparticles produce low interfacial/interphase properties and poor tensile strength even at high interphase thickness revealing the main role of particles size. The smallest nanoparticles and the thickest interphase give {{the highest level of}} φi, while φi decreases to about 0 at R[*]>[*] 30  nm. This evidence demonstrates that only a thick interphase (t[*]=[*] 25  nm) cannot make a high φi when large nanoparticles or aggregates/agglomerates are present in nanocomposites. Accordingly, the aggregated/agglomerated nanoparticles negatively affect the interfacial/interphase properties and tensile strength of polymer nanocomposites.|$|R
