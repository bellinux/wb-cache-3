25|$|Sanskaras, once {{acquired}} and accumulated, form {{what can}} be compared to a lens through which the subjective aspects <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>experience</b> such as judgment arise. Thus when we perceive (either thoughts or external objects) we apperceive those objects through the lens of past experience. We perceive through the imprint or conditioning of past impressions or sanskaras.|$|E
25|$|Unger turns this {{question}} {{from one of}} general principles {{to one of the}} enactment of a vision or project of self-affirmation. For Unger, at issue here is not the pure speculation of philosophical inquiry into the nature of human beings and their activities, but rather a transformative project of self and society. In this way, the task is to realize a vision and enact a program of self-affirmation. The only alternative is to find a better one or fail at self-affirmation. The standards by which Unger confirms a project of self-affirmation are as follows: socially it is unstable if it fails to deal with behavior predispositions or material constraints, and existentially it fails if it disregards recurrent features <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>experience,</b> e.g. dependence upon others.|$|E
5000|$|The sociological {{approach}} [...] {{emphasizes the}} importance of language, collective representations, self-conceptions, and self-reflectivity. This theoretical approach argues that the shape and feel of human consciousness is heavily social, and this is no less true <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> [...] "collective consciousness" [...] than it is <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> individual consciousness.|$|R

500|$|Madhayamaka Buddhism goes even further, finding {{fault with}} the monist view of physicalist philosophies of mind {{as well in}} that these {{generally}} posit matter and energy as the fundamental substance of reality. [...] Nonetheless, this {{does not imply that}} the cartesian dualist view is correct, rather Madhyamaka regards as error any affirming view of a fundamental substance to reality.In denying the independent self-existence of all the phenomena that make up the world <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>experience,</b> the Madhyamaka view departs from both the substance dualism of Descartes and the substance monism—namely, physicalism—that is characteristic of modern science. The physicalism propounded by many contemporary scientists seems to assert that the real world is composed of physical things-in-themselves, while all mental phenomena are regarded as mere appearances, devoid of any reality in and of themselves. Much is made of this difference between appearances and reality.Indeed, physicalism or the idea that matter is the only fundamental substance of reality is explicitly rejected by Buddhism.In the Madhyamaka view, mental events are no more or less real than physical events. In terms of our common-sense experience, differences of kind do exist between physical and mental phenomena. While the former commonly have mass, location, velocity, shape, size, and numerous other physical attributes, these are not generally characteristic of mental phenomena. For example, we do not commonly conceive of the feeling of affection for another person as having mass or location. These physical attributes are no more appropriate to other mental events such as sadness, a recalled image from one’s childhood, the visual perception of a rose, or consciousness of any sort. Mental phenomena are, therefore, not regarded as being physical, {{for the simple reason that}} they lack many of the attributes that are uniquely characteristic of physical phenomena. Thus, Buddhism has never adopted the physicalist principle that regards only physical things as real.|$|E

2500|$|Qualities that qualify our own actions: [...] Qualities such {{as those}} we {{experience}} when we perceive or remember our own actions fall in this category. [...] Two examples used by Sircello are “my gentleness when I speak” and “my efficiency when I work”. [...] These qualities comprise a major part <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>experience</b> of ourselves in our everyday lives.|$|E
2500|$|We {{experience}} the world subjectively thus we create subjective representations <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>experience.</b> These subjective representations of experience are constituted {{in terms of}} five senses and language. That is to say our subjective conscious experience {{is in terms of}} the traditional senses of vision, audition, tactition, olfaction and gustation such that when we—for example—rehearse an activity [...] "in our heads", recall an event or anticipate the future we will [...] "see" [...] images, [...] "hear" [...] sounds, [...] "taste" [...] flavours, [...] "feel" [...] tactile sensations, [...] "smell" [...] odours and think in some (natural) language. [...] Furthermore it is claimed that these subjective representations of experience have a discernible structure, a pattern. It is in this sense that NLP is sometimes defined as the study of the structure of subjective experience.|$|E
2500|$|The {{idea of a}} 'dreambody' was {{generalised}} to {{the concept}} of a 'dreaming process': a potentially meaningful pattern within symptoms, dreams and other irrational or disturbing aspects <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>experience.</b> [...] Totton explains that for process oriented psychology, 'dreaming' refers to any 'extra-conscious signals through which our process communicates itself'. The signals of a 'dreaming process' go beyond nighttime dreams and body symptoms to include 'daydreams, imagery and flickers of awareness that come and go'. [...] For Process Work, 'dreaming' can be defined as 'the unconscious activity of the person, both when they are asleep and when they are awake'. Shafton comments that Mindell, along with Walter Bonime, Fritz Perls, Strephon Williams, Jeremy Taylor and Eugene Gendlin, makes the assumption that 'dreamlike symbolic processes occur in waking' and accordingly applies dreamwork techniques to aspects of conscious experience.|$|E

40|$|We {{maintain}} that no extant {{argument in favor}} of phenomenal external- ism (PE) is really convincing. PE is the thesis that the phenomenal properties <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>experiences</b> must be individuated widely insofar as they are constituted by worldly properties. We consider what we take to be the five best arguments for PE. We try to show that none of them really proves what it aims at proving. Unless better arguments in favor of phenomenal externalism show up in the debate, we see no reason to relinquish an idea that seems intuitive and appeals to many cognitive sci- entists: that phenomenology is narrow, i. e., that phenomenal properties are intrinsic properties <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>experiences.</b> This idea grounds the opposite philosophical position, phenomenal internalism (PI) ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1898 appeared—also {{under the}} {{pseudonym}} Paul Mongré—Hausdorff's epistemological experiment Chaos in cosmic selection. The critique of metaphysics put forward {{in this book}} had its starting point in Hausdorff's confrontation with Nietzsche's idea of eternal recurrence. It ultimately gets to destroying any kind of metaphysics. Of the world itself, from the transcendent world core—as Hausdorff expressed—we know nothing and we know nothing. We must assume [...] "the world itself" [...] as undetermined and undeterminable, as a mere chaos. The world <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>experience,</b> our cosmos {{is the result of}} the selection, the selection that we have always instinctively made according to our possibilities of understanding and make more. From that chaos would also be seen other orders, other Kosmoi, conceivably. At any rate, from the world of our cosmos you can not conclude the existence of a transcendent world.|$|E
2500|$|In another {{scene in}} which a {{character}} dies from solar exposure among the ashes from cremated bodies, massive wind turbines propelled biodegradable dust at the actor in the director's attempt to have the computer-generated effects follow the actor instead of vice versa. Boyle commented on his approach to using effects, [...] "There {{is part of our}} brain where we admire the effect, but we put it in a side compartment <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>experience</b> because you know there's no way an actor can live through that, or be there in that moment." [...] During the post-production process, Boyle hired one visual effects company, London's Moving Picture Company, to work on the film's 750 visual effects. The assignment of a single company was contrary to the industry trend of hiring multiple vendors to work on a film's effects. Boyle chose one company for ease of quality control, though the decision resulted in a prolonged post-production process.|$|E
2500|$|... "They {{see that}} the {{dominant}} feminist paradigm {{is based on an}} unacknowledged model of centre and periphery. In this model, Indigenous, African-descendent, and poor women occupy the periphery and must accept the ideas and conceptualization of feminism as defined by those at the centre. In other words, we Indigenous women are expected to accept the dominant picture of what constitutes women's oppression and women's liberation. [...] The trouble is, this picture is only a partial match with our own experiences. Elements <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>experience</b> that do not match this picture are denied or marginalized. This dominant model tries to homogenize the women's movement, claiming that all women have the same demands and the same access to the enjoyment of their rights. This flawed assumption denies the diverse cultural, linguistic and social needs and visions of distinct groups of women."Indigenous Feminist scholars have resisted the cooptation and exploitation of their scholarship as another result of colonialism. As a collective, various Indigenous feminist scholars have called for [...] "the profound need for transparency and responsibility in light of the traumatic histories of colonization, slavery, and genocide that shape the present" [...] in order to ensure Indigenous feminism is informed by decolonization.|$|E
