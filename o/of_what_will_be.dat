5|$|Desperate Housewives {{focuses on}} the lives of several {{residents}} in the suburban neighborhood of Wisteria Lane. In recent episodes, Mike Delfino (James Denton) married an unidentified bride, who was either Susan Mayer (Teri Hatcher), his ex-wife, or Katherine Mayfair (Dana Delany), his fiancée and Susan's close friend. Lynette Scavo (Felicity Huffman) learned that she and her husband, Tom (Doug Savant), are expecting twins, two <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> six children. Gabrielle (Eva Longoria) and Carlos Solis (Ricardo Antonio Chavira) agreed to take in his niece, Ana (Maiara Walsh), and she and Gabrielle began to antagonize one another. Bree Hodge (Marcia Cross) sought a divorce from her husband, Orson (Kyle MacLachlan); however, Orson refused to end their marriage and blackmailed her into staying in the relationship. As a result, Bree began an affair with her divorce lawyer and Susan's ex-husband, Karl Mayer (Richard Burgi).|$|E
25|$|Filming of {{an episode}} can usually take a {{considerable}} amount of time to be done and as such, each task is usually filmed back-to-back, rather than weekly as it appears in the broadcast schedule for a series. For each episode, four television crews are used to follow the candidates during a task, and often are focused on picking up on mistakes and issues between candidates, than on their overall performance. The final edit of an episode often trims down a task that took 2–3 days to be done, to fit it within approximately about half <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> televised for that episode, meaning candidates may appear to make minimal contributions when in reality they made more, while others may not feature as much if Lord Sugar or his advisers feel they did well and completed their duties, as emphasis is often put on moments that can be entertaining for audiences. Often the filming of an episode can hamper the efforts of candidates in a task, due to film crews usually having to get filming permission first from the respective owner of a store or establishment, which can often be a time consuming and cumbersome process as a result, whilst the strict rules of the BBC on product placement and advertising mean candidates have to approach businesses with care when asking them for help.|$|E
500|$|That same year, Coulter {{joined forces}} with {{previous}} Australian Idol contestants Paulini, Emily Williams and Kate DeAraugo {{to be part of}} the all-girl singing project called Young Divas. The project was initially formed to promote a joint 17-date national tour, where all singers would perform their solo material and several songs as a group. Young Divas released a cover version of Donna Summer's single [...] "This Time I Know It's for Real" [...] in May 2006, through Sony BMG, to promote tickets for the tour. A music video was also shot to accompany the song's release. In an interview with The Sydney Morning Herald, DeAraugo stated that they are [...] "not an Idol supergroup, it's just about finding four female voices. It just so happened the four we've gone with are all from Idol. The single is just to promote the tour, just to show a taste <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> on there, but there won't be an album". Young Divas' version of [...] "This Time I Know It's for Real" [...] peaked at numbertwo and remained in the top-ten for fourteen consecutive weeks. It was eventually certified platinum, for shipments of 70,000 copies. Five months after the single's release, Young Divas released a second single in November 2006, a cover of Lonnie Gordon's [...] "Happenin' All Over Again". The song peaked at numbernine and was certified gold.|$|E

500|$|Salford has {{suffered}} from high levels of unemployment and housing and social problems since around the 1960s, although there are regeneration schemes to reverse its fortunes. Many of the high-rise housing blocks from the 1960s and 1970s were demolished during the 1990s, [...] "a sign that the great social engineering schemes (from that period) had failed". However, the high-rises that remain are a striking feature of Salford's landscape. Work was scheduled to begin on the £180million redevelopment of the Greengate area of Salford in January 2007. The plans include the construction <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> the two tallest tower blocks in Salford. Plans also include a five-star hotel, a new public square and park, restaurants, cafes and 403 apartments. Work is ongoing to regenerate the area known as Middlewood Locks, with the restored Salford terminus of the Manchester Bolton & Bury Canal forming the centrepiece of a brand new residential development. As part of the Pathfinder initiative, Salford was identified in 2002 as one of nine areas in specific need of investment for new homes. Between 2003 and 2006 £115M was invested in the Manchester and City of Salford housing markets, £44M of which was invested in central Salford. Rows of terraces in neighbourhoods such as Seedley and Langworthy– once used for the title sequence of Coronation Street– are being compulsorily purchased, demolished and replaced by [...] "modern sustainable accommodation". Other schemes such as the Charlestown and Lower Kersal New deal for Communities, have concentrated on renovating existing terraced housing stock by block improvement and alleygating, as well as demolishing unsuitable properties and building new facilities, {{in consultation with the}} local community.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the first}} draft of the script, Rubin had not wanted to have to explain to the {{audience}} how Phil got in the loop, and so had the movie start in medias res, with Phil already {{in the midst of the}} looping; the audience would have followed one of his days after waking up to [...] "I Got You Babe" [...] where he is already aware <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> happening, and thus provoking curiosity to the audience; the film would then have used voice-over narration by Phil to provide some of the backstory. Rita also would confess to being trapped in a time loop of her own. Rubin considered this draft more in line with the black comedy Kind Hearts and Coronets, particularly on how Phil's suicides were presented.|$|E

[...] Zorn released the second volume of Arcana: Musicians on Music {{in the summer}} of 2007. According to the preface by Zorn, [...] "This second installment <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> a continuing series of books presenting radical, cutting-edge ideas about music is made, like the initial volume, out of necessity."
