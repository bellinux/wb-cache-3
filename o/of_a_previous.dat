5|$|Birth control also {{improves}} child {{survival in}} the developing world by lengthening the time between pregnancies. In this population, outcomes are worse when a mother gets pregnant within eighteen months <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>previous</b> delivery. Delaying another pregnancy after a miscarriage however does not appear to alter risk and women are advised to attempt pregnancy in this situation whenever they are ready.|$|E
5|$|Breeding {{of animals}} and plants showed related {{varieties}} varying in similar ways, or tending to revert to an ancestral form, and similar patterns of variation in distinct species were explained by Darwin as demonstrating common descent. He recounted how Lord Morton's mare apparently demonstrated telegony, offspring inheriting characteristics <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>previous</b> mate of the female parent, and accepted this process as increasing the variation available for natural selection.|$|E
5|$|Epilepsy {{can have}} both genetic and {{acquired}} causes, with interaction {{of these factors}} in many cases.

In about 60% of cases the cause is unknown. Epilepsies caused by genetic, congenital, or developmental conditions are more common among younger people, while brain tumors and strokes are more likely in older people.|$|E

5|$|Inside {{the walls}} the tower {{included}} a crypt chapel, {{which may be}} the site <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>previous</b> church. The crypt chapel originally had a nave, chancel and an apsidal sanctuary. It is a typical early Norman design with solid pillars and arches. In 1074 D'Oyly and his close friend, Roger d'Ivry endowed a chapel with a college of priests. At an early stage it acquired a dedication to Saint George.|$|E
5|$|The {{carousel}} {{was commissioned}} by William Hubbs, who had it installed in White City Amusement Park in 1917. Built on a Mangel-Illions mechanism, it used animals carved by the Dentzel carousel company of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, sometime before 1900. The carousel was assembled by the William F. Mangels carousel company in 1917. It was probably not the first carousel in the park, as there are indications <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>previous</b> ride that came from Hartford, Connecticut.|$|E

5|$|According {{to modern}} genealogies {{the father of}} Artavasdes I, Ariobarzanes I was a son <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>previous</b> ruling King Mithridates I of Media Atropatene and his wife, an unnamed Armenian Princess from the Artaxiad Dynasty who was a {{daughter}} of the Armenian King Tigranes the Great and his wife, Cleopatra of Pontus, which can explain the claims of Mithridates I’s descendants to the Armenian Kingship {{in opposition to the}} lasting ruling monarchs of the Artaxiad Dynasty. Another possibility in linking Artavasdes I to the marriage of Mithridates I and his wife is through his name. The name Artavasdes bears as a typical Armenian royal name and therefore, in all likelihood, Artavasdes I is a descendant of this marriage.|$|E
5|$|As {{with any}} non-repeating calendar, the Maya {{measured}} time from a fixed start point. The Maya set {{the beginning of}} their calendar as the end <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>previous</b> cycle of bak'tuns, equivalent to a day in 3114 BC. This was believed by the Maya to be the day of the creation of the world in its current form. The Maya used the Long Count Calendar to fix any given day of the Calendar Round within their current great Piktun cycle consisting of either 20 bak'tuns. There was some variation in the calendar, specifically texts in Palenque demonstrate that the piktun cycle that ended in 3114 BC had only 13 bak'tuns, and other inscriptions seem to have used an exceptional cycle of 13 + 20 bak'tun in the current piktun. Additionally, there may have been some regional variation in how these exceptional cycles were managed.|$|E

5|$|Aziz al-Dawla's {{replacements}} were {{challenged by}} Salih and chaos prevailed in Aleppo. In 1023, Salih entered the Kilab into a military {{pact with the}} Banu Tayy of Transjordan and the Banu Kalb of central Syria, both of which opposed direct Fatimid rule. Medieval historian Yahya al-Antaki relates that the alliance was a renewal <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>previous</b> pact made by the same parties in circa 1021, during which they rebelled and ultimately reconciled with the new Fatimid caliph, az-Zahir (r. 1021–1036), who took power {{in the aftermath of}} Caliph al-Hakim's disappearance in 1021. However, the reconciliation unraveled by 1023 due to the Tayy's conflict with Palestine's Fatimid governor, Anushtakin al-Dizbari, which prompted the respective chieftains of Tayy and Kalb, Hassan ibn Mufarrij and Sinan ibn Ulayyan, to meet with Salih at the outskirts of Aleppo and renew the alliance.|$|E
5|$|Erik and Ashley begin dating, but {{on their}} first date at a restaurant, Erik has hot soup spilled accidentally on his legs, so Ashley brings him to her room to clean up. As Ashley rubs lotion on Erik's thigh, he {{develops}} an involuntary erection and accidentally ejaculates over her possessions. Erik apologizes and explains to Ashley that, after breaking up with Tracy, he has not ejaculated in four months, masturbation being a taboo in his house because <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>previous</b> incident. Meanwhile, Cooze {{falls in love with}} Ashley's roommate Denise; however, she is nervous about showing her genitalia and having sex with him, so she gives Cooze a handjob instead. After talking with Erik, Bobby, and Dwight about Denise, Cooze develops suspicions that Denise might have a penis, so Dwight encourages him to find out.|$|E

5|$|Task Force Kean {{kicked off}} its attack on August 7, moving out from Masan. At the Notch, a {{northern}} {{pass into the}} city and site <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>previous</b> battle, the 35th Infantry Regiment encountered 500 North Korean infantry, defeating them. The force surged forward to Pansong, inflicting another 350 casualties on the North Koreans. There, they overran the North Korean 6th Division's headquarters. However {{the rest of the}} task force was slowed by North Korean resistance. Task Force Kean pressed on the Chindong-ni area, resulting in a confused battle where the fragmented force had to rely on air strikes and airdrops to keep it effective. Task Force Kean's offensive had collided with one being delivered simultaneously by the North Korean 6th Division.|$|E
5|$|The {{location}} of the castle was important both because it controlled an important mountain pass, and possibly because Llywelyn claimed authority as {{the lord of the}} mountains and coasts of Wales: several of his castles appear to have been located with such political symbolism in mind. It is also possible that Llywelyn may have built his castle on top of the remains <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>previous</b> fortification constructed by Maelgwn Gwynedd, a king of Gwynedd in the 6th century, although no such remains have been found.|$|E
5|$|Avi Arad, the CEO of Marvel Studios, first {{announced}} plans to develop the film in April 2005, after Marvel Enterprises declared independence by allying with Merrill Lynch to produce a slate of films that would be distributed by Paramount Pictures. Marvel discussed their plans in a brief presentation to Wall Street analysts; the studio's intention was to release individual films for the main characters—to establish their identities and familiarize audiences with them—before merging the characters together in a crossover film. Screenwriter Zak Penn, who wrote The Incredible Hulk (2008), was hired by Marvel Studios to write the film in June 2007. In {{the wake of the}} 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, Marvel negotiated with the Writers Guild of America to ensure that it could create films based on its comic book counterparts, including Captain America, Ant-Man and The Avengers. After the successful release of Iron Man (2008) in May, the company set a July 2011 release date for The Avengers. In September 2008, Marvel Studios reached an agreement with Paramount—an extension <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>previous</b> partnership—which gave the company distribution rights for five future Marvel films.|$|E

5|$|In 1984, actress Jane Seymour {{bought the}} house with her then husband David Flynn for £350,000. After {{spending}} £3 million on refurbishments, they undertook renovation of the house. They brought purchased furniture from Littlecote House, owned by Sir Seton Wills, as he was selling his house and there was little furniture at St Catherine's. Seymour spent summers at the house. After her divorce from Flynn and marriage to American film producer James Keach, Seymour rented out the manor as a film set, recording studio and latterly country house estate/hotel for corporate events and weddings. The English band The Cure recorded their album Wild Mood Swings there in end of 1994 and 1995; they came back {{in the autumn of}} 1998 to record most of their 2000 album Bloodflowers. The rock band Radiohead recorded most of their 1997 album OK Computer there. English Rock/Electronic Band New Order also recorded part of their 2005 album Waiting for the Sirens' Call at St Catherine's Court. The property was also rented by Robbie Williams, as seen in the first episode of MTV Cribs. In May 2007, Seymour was granted a 24-hour alcohol and entertainment licence under new UK regulations, by Bath and North East Somerset council. Neighbours complained the access lane was too narrow and the noise excessive. Seymour won the court battle, but sold the house in November 2007 to an unknown buyer. In 2009 a planning application for a two-storey extension, including a swimming pool was submitted to the local council. This was on the site <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>previous</b> orchard from which the trees were transplanted. The house is now available for catered rental and weddings.|$|E
5|$|Rod Jones {{was known}} as a hard hitter and a {{world-class}} track star, but was a controversial selection because, coming from the run-heavy Southwest Conference, his pass-coverage skills were unknown. At 5'11", 165lbs., he was considered undersized for the NFL. Jones was the first defensive back selected, but was rated no better than fifth-best by most scouting services. The Buccaneers were criticized for taking linebacker Jackie Walker with their third pick, when Kevin Murphy of the national champion Oklahoma Sooners was still available. The Buccaneers did eventually draft Murphy, who they were surprised to find still available with their 40th overall selection. Murphy was believed to have fallen due to rumors of a knee injury. The Buccaneers had rated both Walker and Murphy among the top 15 players in the draft. Craig Swoope was rated as the best safety in the draft, but fell to the fourth round because <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>previous</b> charge (and acquittal) of conspiracy to distribute cocaine. Swoope was eventually the only Buccaneer to achieve any kind of postseason honors in 1986, being selected to the Football Digest All-Rookie team. The team went for big offensive linemen in the later rounds. One of them was J.D. Maarleveld, the first cancer patient drafted by the NFL. Maarleveld was considered to have been a second-round talent, but fell {{all the way to the}} fifth round. Belief that Maarleveld was worth much more money than the average fifth-rounder caused his agent, Greg Marotta, to advise him to reject the Buccaneers' offer and sign with the USFL Baltimore Stars. Maarleveld was eventually able to reach agreement with the Buccaneers.|$|E
5|$|The {{hexagonal}} Great Tower {{was probably}} {{begun in the}} 1430s and 1440s, possibly on the motte <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>previous</b> castle. The tower today has lost not only one of its walls but part of its upper structure, and would originally have been three storeys high with probably additional machicolations on top similar to those on the gatehouse. It {{was designed to be}} a self-contained fortification, with its own water and food supplies, and luxurious quarters lit by large windows on the upper floors. Originally the tower was reached by a bascule drawbridge, usually considered to be drawn from contemporary French designs, such as those at Ferté-Milon and Vannes. This drawbridge was designed to have two parts— a wide, heavy bridge that would be raised or lowered when the family was in residence, and a thinner bridge, easier to lift, designed for the use of servants at other times. The Herberts used the bridge as their badge, and it {{can be seen in the}} carved window designs around the castle. The drawbridge was replaced with a grander stone bridge in the 1460s, probably at a cost of around £900 to £1000. An apron wall with six turrets was also added around the tower at around the same time.|$|E
