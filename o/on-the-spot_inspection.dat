40|$|BACKGROUND: This study {{presents}} a case {{report of a}} woman running a fruit and vegetables market stall, occupationally exposed to mushroom spores, who developed asthmatic symptoms. Basidiospores are allergens that can give rise to sensitization and subsequently trigger an allergic reaction, such as contact dermatitis, rhino-conjunctivitis, asthma and hypersensitivity pneumonitis. METHODS: A 40 -year-old atopic woman, who had worked at a market stall selling fruit and vegetables for the past 26 years {{in a small town}} market in southern Italy, came to our attention at the Occupational Medicine Unit, complaining of a 3 -year history of dyspnoea, cough, and wheezing during autumn and winter. RESULTS: Spirometry showed a severe mixed type respiratory deficit with a significant bronchodilator response obtained with salbutamol administration. Skin prick tests to common aeroallergens were negative. Prick-to-prick test with fresh Pleurotus ostreatus was positive. We evaluated the size of the skin wheals and compared them to the positive control according to the Skin Index. An <b>on-the-spot</b> <b>inspection</b> of her store was performed and environmental conditions were identified that did not allow a satisfactory air exchange. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical history and the results of the allergologic investigations, plus an <b>on-the-spot</b> <b>inspection,</b> permitted us to ascertain that this subject had developed occupational asthma due to Pleurotus ostreatus spores. We advised her to stop handling and selling mushrooms, and she has no longer suffered asthmatic symptoms, over seven years of follow-up, and regularly continued to work without needing to take anti-asthma drugs...|$|E

25|$|In Caetité, between January and June 2004 the {{reservoir}} for radioactive water flooded seven times, which spread liquid effluents of uranium-238, thorium-232 and radium-226 to the Riacho das Vacas creek {{and the surrounding}} environment. This accident motivated in loco, or <b>on-the-spot,</b> <b>inspections</b> of CNEN’s Coordination of Nuclear Facilities (Coordenação de Instalações Nucleares – CODIN). The inspectors produced a technical report which listed various irregularities, such as constant overflows of contaminated water and inadequate excavation measures, {{which could lead to}} landslides and lack of hydro-geological studies to prevent the contaminated water from reaching the groundwater. Despite the critiques of the report, Caetité’s mining license was renewed. According to an article in Folha de S.Paulo, the report authors resigned from their positions.|$|R
40|$|Contemporary society {{stresses}} its multicultural and multiethnic character. The {{comings and}} goings of humankind are becoming more important than ever before, affecting cities and metropolises, exposing them to global risk and causing them to search for nervous and confused responses to the global challenge. In order to understand this current transmutation, it is necessary first to adopt a cosmopolitan outlook and to perform “sopralluoghi” (over-places). In other words, it is necessary to go beyond the methodological nationalism which is a constituent of the social sciences, and, by using <b>on-the-spot</b> <b>inspections,</b> to detect the places of contact where the present cosmopolitan processes are manifesting themselves. Mediterranean cities are, in this sense, the best places to explore this phenomenon, because new cultures and identities continue to spring up there, thanks to the duration and the intensity of human mobility, the frequency of contacts, the variety of cultures and the stratification of a shared cultural heritage...|$|R
40|$|The {{writers have}} made an <b>on-the-spot</b> <b>inspection</b> of grass-roots banks of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China {{in a number of}} cities experimenting with {{monetary}} reform. On the basis of our inspection, we summed up the features of the current banking system in China as being similar to other countries with a planned economy, namely, that money is not a positive instrument affecting the course of reproduction but only a negative reflection of this course. We went a step further to draw the conclusion that China's grass-roots banks today are characterized by "large reserves, lax restrictions, and low risks. " We believe that to ensure the success of reform of the monetary system, restraints on the payment capability of the grass-roots banks should be strengthened from the very beginning, prudently and step by step. In this connection, we put forward a number of proposals on matters of policy. ...|$|E

Consumer centers nationwide received more than 1,000 complaints and queries regarding Nova annually and the National Consumer Affairs Center of Japan says it received some 7,600 complaints or inquiries about Nova's contract and cancellation policies between 1996 and March 2007.|$|R
