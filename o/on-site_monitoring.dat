Johnston supported the lateral blast theory: he believed the explosive eruption would be ejected sideways out of the volcano, not upward.

50|$|Although on-site data {{collection}} using electronic measuring equipment is common-place, many monitoring programmes also use remote surveillance and remote {{access to data}} in real time. This requires the <b>on-site</b> <b>monitoring</b> equipment {{to be connected to}} a base station via either a telemetry network, land-line, cell phone network or other telemetry system such as Meteor burst. The advantage of remote surveillance is that many data feeds can come into a single base station for storing and analysis. It also enable trigger levels or alert levels to be set for individual monitoring sites and/or parameters so that immediate action can be initiated if a trigger level is exceeded. The use of remote surveillance also allows for the installation of very discrete monitoring equipment which can often be buried, camouflaged or tethered at depth in a lake or river with only a short whip aerial protruding. Use of such equipment tends to reduce vandalism and theft when monitoring in locations easily accessible by the public.|$|E

40|$|Taking {{into account}} outdoor thermal {{comfort in the}} urban design stage can {{potentially}} enhance the livability of a city. This study aims to demonstrate an outdoor thermal comfort prediction method using measured thermal parameters and simulated wind velocities. This is done by first comparing the CFD simulation results of wind velocities around a single building with and without elevated design with those obtained from a wind tunnel experiment, and two turbulence models, the Delayed Detached Eddy Simulation (DDES) and the RNG k-ε model, were assessed. The mean velocity field obtained using DDES model has better agreement with the wind tunnel measurements, especially in the wake region and at the open space beneath the elevated building. It is shown that the building elevation modified the mean flow pattern around a building. Then the potential impact on pedestrian thermal comfort was assessed using a simplified method by combining the predicted wind velocity and the <b>on-site</b> <b>monitored</b> radiant and air temperatures and air humidity on two summer days. It is revealed that the elevated design improves the thermal comfort only in the limited neighboring area, but that the open space underneath the elevated building provides much better thermal comfort in the summer conditions.

40|$|Errors in the design, the conduct, {{the data}} {{collection}} process, and the analysis of a randomized trial {{have the potential to}} affect not only the safety of the patients in the trial, but also, through the introduction of bias, the safety of future patients. Trial monitoring, defined broadly to include methods of oversight which begin when the study is designed and continue until it is reported in a publication, has a role to play in eliminating such errors. <b>On-site</b> <b>monitoring</b> can be extremely inefficient for the identification of errors most likely to compromise patient safety or bias study results. However, a variety of other monitoring strategies offer alternatives to <b>on-site</b> <b>monitoring.</b> Each new trial should conduct a risk assessment to identify the optimal means of monitoring, taking into account the likely sources of error, their consequences for patients, the study's validity, and the available resources. Trial management committees should consider central statistical monitoring a key aspect of such monitoring.
