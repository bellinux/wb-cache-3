40|$|No {{specific}} guidelines {{exist to}} assist in designing usable hypertext systems. In this paper, we discuss three experiments to study usability issues in hypertext design. In the first experiment, we investigated usability of four types of hypertext interfaces: graphical with labeled links (GL), graphical with unlabeled links (GU), textual with embedded links (TE), and textual with a separate list of related items/links (TS). The results favored GL interface for novice users. However, most subjects suggested incorporating multiple access pathways to facilitate search. To determine how hypertext designers could establish, a priori, these multiple <b>structures,</b> we extracted <b>organization</b> schemes from domain experts in the second experiment. Distinctly different <b>organization</b> <b>structures</b> emerged from experts with different professional backgrounds. Therefore, we modified the hypertext to incorporate multiple <b>organization</b> <b>structures.</b> In experiment 3, we compared subjects’ performance using multiple and single <b>organization</b> <b>structures.</b> Multiple structures, contrary to previous evidence, enhanced search performance. The benefits of multiple structures, however, diminished over time. These experiments provide empirical evidence in favor of GL interfaces and incorporation of multiple <b>organization</b> <b>structures</b> to improve hypertext usability...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} a Cournot duopoly game with endogenous <b>organization</b> <b>structures.</b> There are two firms A and B who {{compete in the}} retail market, where A is more efficient than B. Prior to competition in the retail stage, firms simultaneously choose their <b>organization</b> <b>structures</b> which can be either 'centralized' (one central unit chooses quantity to maximize firm's profit) or 'decentralized' (the retail unit chooses quantity to maximize firm's revenue while the production unit supplies the required quantity). Identifying the (unique) Nash Equilibrium for every retail-stage subgame, we show that the reduced form game of organization choices is a potential game. The main result is that with endogenous <b>organization</b> <b>structures,</b> situations could arise where the less efficient firm B obtains a higher profit than its more efficient rival A. ...|$|R

This second organization adopted a standard white costume and used code words which were similar to those used by the first Klan, while adding cross burnings and mass parades to intimidate others. [...] It rapidly declined in the later half of the 1920s.|$|E

2500|$|William Richard Scott {{describes}} contingency {{theory in}} the following manner: [...] "The best way to organize depends {{on the nature of}} the environment to which the organization must relate". The work of other researchers including Paul Lawrence, Jay Lorsch, and James D. Thompson complements this statement. They are more interested in the impact of contingency factors on organizational structure. Their structural contingency theory was the dominant paradigm of organizational structural theories for most of the 1970s. A major empirical test was furnished by Johannes M Pennings who examined the interaction between environmental uncertainty, <b>organization</b> <b>structure</b> and various aspects of performance. Pennings carried out an empirical study on a sample of retail brokerage offices in which aspects of their market environment such as competitiveness, change and munificence, versus [...] organizational arrangements such as decision making templates, power distribution were juxtaposed for possible implications for performance. While structural attributes of offices strongly impacted performance, the evidence for [...] "contingency" [...] was less pronounced.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are many}} {{community}} organizations and social movements {{around the world}} which are taking action to reduce homelessness. They have sought to counteract the causes and reduce the consequences by starting initiatives that help homeless people to transition to self-sufficiency. Social movements and initiatives tend to follow a grassroots, community-based model of organization. This form of movement is generally characterized by a loose, informal and decentralized structure, {{with an emphasis on}} radical protest politics. An interest group gives more of an emphasis on influencing government policies and relies on more of a formal <b>organization</b> <b>structure.</b> [...] These different groups share a common element: they are both made up of and run by a mix of allies of the homeless population and former or current members of the homeless population. Both grassroots groups and interest groups aim to break stereotyped images of the homeless as being weak, criminals, drug addicts and excluded and to ensure that the voice of homeless people and their representatives is clearly heard by policymakers.|$|E
