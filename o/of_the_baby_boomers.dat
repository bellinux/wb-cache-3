25|$|Why We Want You to Be Rich {{notes in}} the {{introduction}} it is not intended as a technical manual with specific recommendations. The book warns the reader that the American middle class strata is shrinking due to multiple factors including oncoming retirement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>boomers,</b> rising costs of light crude oil, decreasing employer pay to employees, increasing national debt of the United States, and a declining power of the United States dollar. The authors caution that individuals should not rely on the federal bureaucracy for support from problems including the middle-class squeeze, economic globalization, and threats of terrorism. They assert that employment opportunities are not formed from the government but rather through entrepreneurship.|$|E
25|$|In {{the last}} 50 years {{there have been}} great changes toward gender {{equality}} in industrialised nations such as the United States of America. With the feminist movement of the 1960s, women began to enter the workforce in great numbers. Women had also had high labor market participation during World War II as so many male soldiers were away, women had to take up jobs to support their family and keep their local economy on track. Many of these women dropped right {{back out of the}} labor force when the men returned home from war to raise children born in the generation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>boomers.</b> In the late 1960s when women began entering the labor force in record numbers, they were entering in addition to all of the men, as opposed to substituting for men during the war. This dynamic shift from the one-earner household to the two-earner household dramatically changed the socioeconomic class system of industrialised nations in the post-war period.|$|E

During the era <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>boomers,</b> families became a popular social topic, especially on television. Family shows such as Roseanne, All in the Family, Leave It to Beaver, [...] The Cosby Show, Married... with Children, The Jeffersons, and Good Times, Everybody Loves Raymond have portrayed different social classes of families growing up in America. Those [...] "perfect" [...] nuclear families have changed {{as the years passed}} and have become more inclusive, showing single-parent and divorced families, as well as older singles. Television shows that show single-parent families include Half & Half, One on One, Murphy Brown, and Gilmore Girls.|$|E

Spielberg later co-produced the World War II themed television miniseries Band of Brothers and its counterpart The Pacific with Tom Hanks. When asked about this by American Cinematographer, Spielberg said, [...] "I think that World War II {{is the most significant}} event of the last 100 years; the fate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>boomers</b> and even Generation X was linked to the outcome. Beyond that, I've just always been interested in World War II. My earliest films, which I made when I was about 14 years old, were combat pictures that were set both on the ground and in the air. For years now, I've been looking for the right World War II story to shoot, and when Robert Rodat wrote Saving Private Ryan, I found it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Beginning in 1967, studies raised {{concerns}} that LSD might produce genetic damage or developmental abnormalities in fetuses. However, these initial reports {{were based on}} in vitro studies or were poorly controlled and have not been substantiated. In studies of chromosomal changes in human users and in monkeys, the balance of evidence suggests no increase in chromosomal damage. For example, white blood cells {{of people who had}} been given LSD in a clinical setting were examined for visible chromosomal abnormalities; overall, there appeared to be no lasting changes. [...] Several studies have been conducted using illicit LSD users and provide a less clear picture. Interpretation of this data is generally complicated by factors such as the unknown chemical composition of street LSD, concurrent use of other psychoactive drugs, and diseases such as hepatitis in the sampled populations. It seems possible that the small number of genetic abnormalities reported in users of street LSD is either coincidental or related to factors other than a toxic effect of pure LSD. A 2008 medical review concluded, [...] "The available data suggest that pure LSD does not cause chromosomal abnormalities, spontaneous abortions, or congenital malformations." [...] However, this refutation has not stopped this perennial legend from being told, nor has it stopped the jokes about such [...] "mutations" [...] allegedly messing up the children <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baby</b> <b>Boomers.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this thesis investigates how the ‘Baby Boomer generation’ has become constructed as a social problem in Britain. I begin by outlining <b>the</b> theoretical orientation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> research, which is grounded in Mannheim’s understanding that <b>the</b> problem <b>of</b> generations is {{to do with the}} interaction between generational location and wider social forces. The subsequent chapters present <b>the</b> results <b>of</b> a qualitative media analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baby</b> <b>Boomer</b> problem, using a sample of British national newspaper articles published between 1986 and 2011 to examine <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> a cultural script. These chapters outline, first, <b>the</b> main features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baby</b> <b>Boomer</b> problem as it is currently presented, before moving on to analyse how the cultural script has, over time, constructed the Boomer generation in two main ways: as an economic problem, and as a cultural problem. My findings indicate that both <b>the</b> attributes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baby</b> <b>Boomer</b> generation, and <b>the</b> importance attached to generation as a political or social category, have changed over time, and are affected by wider political, social, and cultural shifts. This has a number of implications for how we think about <b>the</b> construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> problem <b>of</b> generations in <b>the</b> present day...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the next}} decade the older travel market will {{experience}} a generational shift as the pre-war generation is replaced by <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>boomer</b> generation.

2500|$|Older {{generations of}} Americans have {{consistently}} reported {{the lowest level}} of access to the Internet per age cohorts. Americans 55 and older have always shown {{the lowest level of}} broadband usage, while Americans ages 18–24 have exhibited the highest levels of usage: in 2001, 3.1% of households 65 years and older, 10.1% of households 45–64 years of age, and 11.3% of households 16–44 years of age connected to the Internet at home. The same trend holds true on the individual level: in 2005, 26% of Americans ages 65+, 67% of ages 50–64, 80% of ages 30–49, and 84% of ages 18–29 reported Internet access. As a whole, usage rates are increasing rapidly, but older Americans still have the lowest levels of Internet connectivity: by 2009, 39.9% of households 65 years and older, 68.2% of households 45-64, and 71.2% of households 16-44 reported connecting to the Internet. Per the oldest generations of Americans, 4% of the G.I. Generation (85+), 7% of the Silent Generation (66-84), and 35% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baby</b> <b>Boomers</b> (47-65) had connected to the Internet by February 2008. Although older generations still hold the lowest amount of Internet usage age-wise, the United States has seen a dramatic increase in Internet users at the age of 65 and older. From 2000 to 2015, the amount of senior citizens connected to the Internet increased by 44%. As far as device usage, seniors tended to describe their smartphones as [...] "freeing" [...] and [...] "connecting" [...] {{and are more likely to}} use tablets and e-readers.|$|E
