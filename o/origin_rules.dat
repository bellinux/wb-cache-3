25|$|The {{interest}} {{generated by}} the experimental state of origin matches of 1980 and 1981 {{and the potential for}} financial rewards were enough to convince the authorities to play all three games under state of <b>origin</b> <b>rules</b> the following year.|$|E
25|$|From time to {{time the}} {{selection}} of players under the State of <b>Origin</b> <b>rules</b> creates controversy. Since 1980, Queensland has completed just the 7 series with a team completely made up of players of a Queensland birth, while for New South Wales the total is only 6. However, place of birth has only been a relevant factor in eligibility since 2012.|$|E
25|$|The Australian game {{divided in}} 1997 into two competitions, one {{run by the}} ARL and one by the News Limited-owned Super League, and an interstate series was played in each. Under the Super League banner there was a Tri-Origin series with a New Zealand side added to the competition. The ARL {{meanwhile}} stuck to its traditional format. The teams were selected using <b>origin</b> <b>rules,</b> and New South Wales and Queensland met twice. These matches do not count towards the official state of origin record. As with the premiership, players were spread between two representative tournaments as well.|$|E

25|$|With {{the lack}} of {{international}} competition, state representative matches were regarded with great importance. The Australian Football Council co-ordinated regular interstate carnivals, including the Australasian Football Jubilee, held in Melbourne in 1908 to celebrate the game's bicentenary. Due {{in part to the}} VFL poaching talent from other states, Victoria dominated interstate matches for three quarters of a century. State of <b>Origin</b> <b>rules,</b> introduced in 1977, stipulated that rather than representing the state of their adopted club, players would return to play for the state they were first recruited in. This instantly broke Victoria's stranglehold over state titles and Western Australia and South Australia began to win more of their games against Victoria. Both New South Wales and Tasmania scored surprise victories at home against Victoria in 1990.|$|E
25|$|The State of Origin {{eligibility}} rules varied from game to game, and matches during the 1980s were sometimes played under partial, rather than full, State of <b>Origin</b> <b>rules.</b> This was {{in large part}} so that neutral leagues were not disrupted by a stand-alone game between two other states; e.g. VFL clubs would not lose access to interstate origin players on the weekend of a game between South Australia and Western Australia. For example, in the stand-alone 1982 match between South Australia and Victoria, a quota of up to six VFL players of South Australian origin, {{and no more than}} one from any VFL club, could play for South Australia; but otherwise, all SANFL and VFL players were eligible to play for South Australia and Victoria respectively – indeed Victoria fielded five VFL players of Western Australian origin in that match, including their captain, Mike Fitzpatrick. Jason Dunstall and Terry Daniher, who were born in and recruited from Queensland and New South Wales respectively, both played several partial-origin matches for Victoria; and in a partial-origin match against Victoria in 1990, New South Wales was allowed to be represented by players of New South Welsh origin and any player who had played for the Sydney Swans.|$|E

[...] This saw the new State of <b>Origin</b> <b>rules</b> applied a fairer game, saw it again in 1981. [...] In 1981, legendary captain Arthur Beetson was ready to play before injury ruled him out, so he became coach of the team, and would remain so {{for the next three}} years. It seemed that State of Origin might still be dominated by New South Wales with the Blues ahead 15–0, but a remarkable comeback by Queensland saw them defeat New South Wales 22–15 with young captain Wally Lewis and Chris Close the stars of the comeback win. [...] This match gave rugby league officials the impetus to decide that 1982 should have 2 State of Origin matches and a decider if required.|$|E
