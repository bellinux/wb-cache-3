30|$|A {{case study}} was {{conducted}} to determine the benefits of aggregator operation. By making full use of batteries distributed on the demand side, the business mode that the aggregators <b>operate</b> <b>and</b> <b>coordinate</b> with distributed batteries is economically superior to individual consumer operation. This is mainly due to two reasons: 1) the aggregation mode enables the relatively small distributed batteries to participate in the regulation market, which sets certain requirements that are unattainable for individual batteries; and 2) the aggregator is able to make the best use of information and approach the optimal bidding and operation strategy to maximize profits. It is thus reasonable to conclude that the model in which distributed batteries are operated and coordinated by the aggregator is technically and economically feasible.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{compositional}} modeling {{framework for the}} optimal energy management of a district network. The focus is on cooling of buildings, which can possibly share resources {{to the purpose of}} reducing maintenance costs and using devices at their maximal efficiency. Components of the network are described in terms of energy fluxes and combined via energy balance equations. Disturbances are accounted for as well through their contribution in terms of energy. Different district configurations can be built, and the dimension and complexity of the resulting model will depend on the number and type of components and on the adopted disturbance description. Control inputs are available to efficiently <b>operate</b> <b>and</b> <b>coordinate</b> the district components, thus enabling energy management strategies to minimize the electrical energy costs or track some consumption profile agreed with the main grid operator.

30|$|The high {{penetration}} of distributed renewable energy raises a higher {{concern for the}} safe and economic operation of the smart grid. Distributed batteries equipped in demand-side can not only contribute to the reliability and security of the grid, but also make profits by participating in the electricity market, especially when distributed batteries are combined <b>and</b> <b>operated</b> by an aggregator. Considering the well-operated mechanism of performance based regulation (PBR) in the U.S. electricity market, it becomes increasingly lucrative for batteries to participate not only in energy markets for energy arbitrage, but also in ancillary service markets to provide regulation and peak-load shaving services. In this study, distributed batteries are <b>operated</b> <b>and</b> <b>coordinated</b> by the aggregator, which simultaneously submits offers to the energy and the ancillary service markets as an individual entity. An optimal decision model is formulated for the aggregator to determine the operation and bidding strategy for the distributed batteries by considering the characteristics of batteries, including the terms of capacity, efficiency and degradation cost. Finally, a numerical case is conducted to evaluate {{the benefits of the}} decision model.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND Golden-hour, a time-tested {{concept for}} trauma-care, {{involves}} a systems approach encompassing healthcare, logistics, geographical, environmental and temporal variables. Golden-hour paradigm in mass-gathering-medicine {{such as the}} Hajj-pilgrimage entwines along healthcare availability, accessibility, efficiency and interoperability; expanding from the patient-centric to public-health centric approach. The realm of mass-gathering-medicine invokes an opportunity for incorporating operations-throughput as a determinant of golden-hour for overall capacity-building and interoperability. METHODS Golden-hour was evaluated during the Indian-Medical-Mission operations for Hajj- 2016; which established, <b>operated</b> <b>and</b> <b>coordinated</b> a strategic network of round-the-clock medical operations. Throughput was evaluated as deliverables/time, against established Standard-Operating-Procedures for various clinical, investigation, drug-dispensing and patient-transfer algorithms. Patient encounter-time, waiting-time, turnaround-time were assessed throughout echeloned healthcare under a patient-centric healthcare-delivery model. Dynamic evaluation was carried out to cater for variation and heterogeneity. RESULTS Massive surge of 3, 94, 013 patients comprising 2, 25, 103 males (57. 1 %) and 1, 68, 910 females (42. 9 %) overwhelmed the throughput capacities of outpatient attendance, pharmacy, laboratory, imaging, ambulance, referrals and documentation. There was delay in attendance, suspicion, diagnosis and isolation of patients with communicable infections. The situational-analysis of operations-throughput highlights wasted turnaround-time due to mobilization of medical-team, diverting critical healthcare resources away from emergency situations. CONCLUSION Time being a crucial factor in the complexity of medical-care, operations-throughput remains an important determinant towards interoperability of bottlenecks, thereby being a determinant of golden-hour in mass-gathering-medicine. Early transportation of patient to definitive-care reduces treatment initiation-time, notwithstanding logistics of communication, evacuation, terrain and weather being deterministic in outcome. Golden-hour needs to be emphasized under a population-based approach targeting the clientele towards administering first-aid and reaching out to hospital within the golden-hour...|$|R

As the success of the entire food supply chain depends on the prosperity of farms and local communities, the direct climate change risks faced by the agricultural sector are also risks to businesses and food supply chains. Hence, the importance of resilience at farm level, community level and business level when looking at food supply chain policy and management. Attention is given to each phase of the supply chain: input production, agriculture, food processing, retailing, consumption and post-consumption. The book integrates various approaches related to sustainability, resilience and climate adaptation drawing from environmental management, environmental policy, agro-ecology, sociology and behavioral sciences. European case studies demonstrate the vulnerabilities of contemporary food supply chains, the opportunities and competitive advantages related to climate change, and the trans-disciplinary challenges related to successful climate adaptation.

40|$|Abstract The {{conflict}} in Afghanistan is {{over a decade}} long, yet the literature surrounding the strategies of the Taliban is distinctly lacking. A few scholars, analysts and former military personnel have dedicated chapters or articles to various Taliban strategies, however, {{a lot of the}} information appears in a diffuse state or has rapidly become outdated with the contemporary nature of the conflict. This project will therefore address two of the Taliban?s most important strategies. It will chronologically analyse the development of the information operations and the kinetic strategies of the organisation, investigating how the leadership has evolved the insurgency from an exiled group in Pakistan, into one that is able to <b>operate</b> <b>and</b> launch <b>coordinated</b> <b>and</b> sophisticated attacks in every province of Afghanistan by 2012. The importance of religion in the Taliban?s messaging will be examined, along with the evolution of dissemination techniques, going from simple word of mouth and public letters known as ?shabnamah?, to the incorporation of technology such as DVDs, websites and mobile phone media. The investigation into the chronological progress of the Taliban?s kinetic strategies will show how they have effectively made use of denial, demoralisation, infiltration, interdiction and concentration against the Afghan and international forces. Finally, the theoretical debate of whether the Taliban is fighting a new or classic style of insurgency will be explored. It will demonstrate the futility of Hammes? argument that the Taliban is fighting a ?fourth generation war?, and that Liang and Xiangsui?s ?unrestricted warfare? is too complex for the Taliban to undertake successfully. The Taliban have adapted traditional approaches from historical Afghan conflicts into a style of warfare that best mirrors the classic strategies of a Maoist guerrilla war...|$|R

In this presentation we review the current status of co-location sites of the 4 techniques contributing to the ITRF: VLBI, SLR, GPS and DORIS. After recalling the usage of local ties in the ITRF combination, we will evaluate the impact of their errors on the ITRF quality and reliability as well as on its datum definition and mainly its physical parameters, namely the origin and the scale. Based on the results of the ITRF 2005 combination and other analysis, we will isolate co-location site where discrepancies between terrestrial surveys and space geodesy estimates are significant. 1...|$|R
