50|$|Direct {{hydrogen}} cooling {{is employed}} in the stator terminals. The rotor forging is of nickel chromium molybdenum vanadium steel having a minimum yield point of 33.2 ton/in.2. The shaft end which connects to the turbine is deferentially tempered to give additional strength to withstand the severe forces which could be applied under fault conditions on the generator. The first three critical speeds are arranged to be below the running speed. The hydrogen-cooled rotor conductors are formed from silver-bearing hard drawn copper tube. Two tubes in parallel form one conductor and there are six conductors per slot except for the slots adjacent to the pole centres, which contain five. The generator is ventilated by cold gas fed {{to a number of}} radial ducts at the slipring end of the core, which communicate with the axial vent holes in the core and stator teeth. After passing through the axial holes the gas is discharged into the ‘air’ gap through further radial ducts at the turbine end of the core. The gas discharged from the core passes along the ‘air’ gap, together with the hot gas discharged from the outlet holes in the rotor body, to the region between the end windings and a baffle at the slipring end, and thence through one half of each axial cooler to the blower intake. After leaving the blower, the gas is passed through the other halves of the coolers and is delivered to the various inlet regions of the stator core and rotor. Gas is fed to the turbine end of the rotor through axial holes machined in the hub of the blower rotor from an annulus formed between the end bracket and the blower <b>outlet</b> <b>diffuser.</b> Large diameter tubes passing longitudinally through the stator frame connect this annulus to the extreme end section at the slipring end, from which the slipring end of the rotor is fed. The three-stage axial blower mounted on the generator shaft comprises a shaft-mounted sleeve upon which is mounted the bladed rotor disc, a bladed stator casing, a diffuser and an inlet fairing.|$|E

The overall aim {{of the work is}} to visualise the air velocity and temperature distributions in different sections of the climatised volume to understand if the right thermal comfort condition of the occupants are established. To reach the goal the research group of the Dipartimento di Energetica dell’Università di Ancona (D. E.

In this way is possible to verify the right position of inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>diffusers,</b> the flow rate and inlet air temperature to establish an uniform distribution of the air velocity. For this purpose vertical grills, round ceiling diffusers and floor linear diffusers are installedon the sides of a controlled room, where walls, floor and ceiling are modular to have whatever positions for the inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>diffusers.</b> To record in steady state the values of the temperature and the air velocity on different vertical planes cutting the climatised volume an automated apparatus, designed and built with the component derived from the robotic technologies, has been utilised.

40|$|A cyclone {{combustor}} {{was designed}} to enable the use of dual fuels in small gas turbines. Multiple tangential inlets enable gasified products of biomass and gas oil to be introduced separately into the combustion chamber. An integrated vortex collector pocket (VCP) was positioned just before a tangential off take. As the flow moves past the VCP the fine particles are removed from the flow. The tangential off take will draw the flow past the VCP and produce near uniform exit conditions. Results showed the combustor produced a stable swirling flame, with good mixing patterns for all cases, with LCV wood gas, gas oil and when running {{with a combination of}} both fuels. Areas of high temperature in the combustor were identified, where refractory material would be needed. The VCP performance was good, collecting particles below 10 - 5 m. The tangential off-take from the combustor potentially decreases the pressure drop across the system by efficiently funnelling the swirling flow into a square duct with low losses whilst pro ducing a near uniform velocity profile.

40|$|Fluid dynamic {{analysis}} of turbodynamic blood pumps (TBPs) is often conducted under steady flow conditions. However, {{the preponderance of}} clinical applications for ventricular assistance involves unsteady, pulsatile flow-due to the residual contractility of the native heart. This study was undertaken to demonstrate the importance of pulsatility and the associated time derivative of the flow rate (dQ/dt) on hemodynamics within a clinical-scale TBP. This was accomplished by performing flow visualization studies on a transparent model of a centrifugal TBP interposed within a cardiovascular simulator with controllable heart rate and stroke volume. Particle image velocimetry triggered to both the rotation angle of the impeller and phase of the cardiac cycle was used to quantify the velocity field in the outlet volute and in between the impeller blades for 16 phases of the cardiac cycle. Comparison of the unsteady flow fields to corresponding steady conditions at the same (instantaneous) flow rates revealed marked differences. In particular, deceleration of flow was found to promote separation within the <b>outlet</b> <b>diffuser,</b> while acceleration served to stabilize the velocity field. The notable differences between the acceleration and deceleration phases illustrated the prominence of inertial fluid forces.

In this paper, we investigate {{the characteristics of a}} planar diffuser/nozzle based micropump using de-tailed computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analyses. The significant parameters are determined using the Buckingham-Pi theorem. In part based on this, the shape of the diffuser and the nozzle of the micropump, as well as the piezoelectric disc oscillation frequency, are selected for numerical investiga-tion. The influences of the determined parameters on the flow rate of the micropump are then studied using three dimensional transient CFD analyses. The data from the CFD analyses are compared to ve-locity profiles from Jeffery-Hamel flow predictions in a wedge shaped channel. Significant similarities are found between the CFD data and the Jeffery-Hamel velocity profiles, especially near the exit of the diffuser where the flow is more developed. Three different diffuser geometries are simulated at three different frequencies. The flow rate and direction of flow are shown to be highly sensitive to inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>diffuser</b> shapes, with the absolute flow rate varying by as much as 200 % for the geometrical perturbations studied. Entrance losses at both the diffuser inlet and nozzle inlet appear to dominate the flow resistance at extremely laminar flow conditions with an average Reynolds number of Reaverage ≈ 500. ...|$|E
40|$|This volume {{summarizes}} the analysis {{used to assess}} the structural life of the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) High Pressure Fuel Turbo-Pump (HPFTP) Third Stage Impeller. This analysis was performed in three phases, all using the DIAL finite element code. The first phase was a static stress analysis to determine the mean (non-varying) stress and static margin of safety for the part. The loads involved were steady state pressure and centrifugal force due to spinning. The second phase of the analysis was a modal survey to determine the vibrational modes and natural frequencies of the impeller. The third phase was a dynamic response analysis to determine the alternating component of the stress due to time varying pressure impulses at the <b>outlet</b> (<b>diffuser)</b> side of the impeller. The results of the three phases of the analysis show that the Third Stage Impeller operates very near the upper limits of its capability at full power level (FPL) loading. The static loading alone creates stresses in some areas of the shroud which exceed the yield point of the material. Additional cyclic loading due to the dynamic force could lead to a significant reduction in the life of this part.

40|$|This thesis details a {{study of}} {{strategies}} used to limit the flow generated noise encountered in the outlet diffusers of high velocity heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) duct systems. The underlying noise rating criterion is drawn from the specifications covering ocean going aluminium fast ferries. Although directed primarily towards the fast ferry industry the results presented herein are applicable to other niche high velocity HVAC applications. Experimental tests have been conducted to prove the viability of a high velocity HVAC duct system in meeting airflow requirements whilst maintaining acceptable passenger cabin noise levels. A 50 mm diameter circular jet of air was expanded using a primary conical diffuser {{with a variety of}} secondary outlet configurations. Noise measurements were taken across a velocity range of 15 to 60 m/s. An optimum outlet design has been experimentally identified by varying the diffuser angle, outlet duct length and the termination grill. A 4 to 5 fold reduction in required duct area was achieved {{with the use of a}} distribution velocity of 20 to 30 ms- 1, without exceeding the prescribed passenger cabin noise criteria. The geometric configuration of the diffuser outlet assembly was found to have a pronounced effect on the noise spectrum radiating from the duct outlet. The development of a numerical model capable of predicting the flow induced noise generated by airflow exiting a ventilation duct is also documented. The model employs a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) CFD model to calculate the turbulent flow field through the duct diffuser section and outlet. The flow-generated noise is then calculated using a far field acoustic postprocessor based on the Ffowcs-Williams and Hawkings integral based formulation of Lighthill&# 146;s acoustic analogy. Time varying flow field variables are used to calculate the fluctuating noise sources located at the duct outlet and the resulting far field sound pressure levels. This result is then used to calculate the corresponding far field sound intensity and sound power levels.

40|$|This study {{presents}} a thermodynamic model {{for determining the}} entrainment ratio and double choke limiting pressure of supersonic ejectors {{within the context of}} heat driven refrigeration cycles, with and without droplet injection, at the constant area section of the device. Input data include the inlet operating conditions and key geometry parameters (primary throat, mixing section and <b>diffuser</b> <b>outlet</b> diameter), whereas output information includes the ejector entrainment ratio, maximum double choke compression ratio, ejector efficiency, exergy efficiency and exergy destruction index. In single-phase operation, the ejector entrainment ratio and double choke limiting pressure are determined with a mean accuracy of 18 % and 2. 5 %, respectively. In two-phase operation, the choked mass flow rate across convergent-divergent nozzles is estimated with a deviation of 10 %. An analysis on the effect of droplet injection confirms the hypothesis that droplet injection reduces by 8 % the pressure and Mach number jumps associated with shock waves occuring {{at the end of the}} constant area section. Nonetheless, other factors such as the mixing of the droplets with the main flow are introduced, resulting in an overall reduction by 11 % of the ejector efficiency and by 15 % of the exergy efficiency...|$|R
