Therefore, the purposes of the study are to investigate the objective of teaching reading, the topic of teaching reading, the technique of teaching reading, the evaluation technique of teaching reading for the first year students at SMP Negeri 3 Batu. This study was descriptive research as research design. Here, the writer used subject of the study to investigate the implementation of teaching reading that was used by the first grade of English teachers at SMP Negeri 3 Batu. The subjects are two English teachers of the first year students. The instruments that were used in this study were a semi structured interview and an observation. Based on the result of the data analysis, {{it was found that the}} objectives of teaching reading at SMP Negeri 3 Batu were: (a) to get general information (b) to get specific information (c) to read English well (d) to read for pleasure. English teachers focused teaching reading for the first year students on all of these objectives. The topics of teaching reading, which were used, were self identity, school life, family life and profession. Techniques of teaching reading that were used English teachers were three phases of teaching reading, as follows: (a) pre-reading: introducing the text that would be discussed and looking for new vocabulary, (b) while reading: reading the text, answering question, and understanding the text, and (c) post reading: summarizing both old and new information and retelling. Next, Evaluation techniques that were used English teachers at SMP Negeri 3 Batu were such subjective tests as an essay and answering question, and such objective test as matching the word to know the ability of students. Teacher also evaluated (a) cognitive domain; giving written test as essay and understanding the text, (b) affective domain; giving <b>oral</b> <b>question</b> and students answered the question, and responding the question, and (c) psychomotor domain; doing what teacher asked. ...|$|E

40|$|With this Resolution (B 7 - 0475 / 2011), {{adopted by}} a large majority, the European Parliament sends out a strong {{political}} message that homelessness is an urgent issue, on which the EU must step up its co-ordination and support of Member States’ policies. This requires building on previous work at EU-level in order to deliver an ambitious, integrated European homelessness strategy that can make concrete progress {{in the fight against}} homelessness. FEANTSA welcomes the adoption of this Resolution. Freek Spinnewijn, FEANTSA Director, said that he hoped it would help the European Commission to make concrete progress towards developing an EU homelessness strategy in the framework of the Europe 2020 strategy; the European Platform against Poverty and Social Exclusion; and in line with the recommendations of the Jury of the European Consensus Conference on Homelessness.. He particularly welcomed calls for a specific focus on innovative ‘housing-led’ approaches, for links to the structural funds and for the agreement of a framework for monitoring and reporting on the development of national and regional homelessness strategies. The motion for a Resolution was presented by MEPs Karima Delli (France, Greens/EFA) and Pervenche Berès (Belgium, S&D) on behalf of the EP Employment and Social Affairs Committee. Karima Delli said "Ending homelessness is possible and must be a trans-European priority. The EP has today sent a strong message to the other institutions to stop ignoring this core issue and to establish a European strategy to end homelessness by 2020 ”. The Resolution was preceded by an <b>oral</b> <b>question</b> for debate with the Commission (O- 000153 / 2011) in which MEPs from across the political spectrum took the floor to call on the Commission to deliver an EU homelessness strategy. This Resolution follows a cross-party Written Declaration on an EU Homelessness Strategy (61 / 2010) adopted in December 2010 and initiated by MEPs Britta Thomsen (Denmark, S&D), Liz Lynne (UK, ALDE), Ilda Figueiredo (Portugal, GUE/NGL), Karima Delli and Jacek Protasiewicz (Poland, Christian Democrats) [...] The parliament also previously adopted a Written Declaration on Ending Street Homelessness (111 / 2007) in 2008. FEANTSA congratulates the Parliament on its commitment to ending homelessness, which is a violation of human dignity and fundamental rights, and looks forward to further co-operation with the European Commission and other institutions in order to support follow-up of this Resolutio...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{discussed}} {{about teaching}} learning process for deaf students. This thesis {{was based on}} the Indonesian government regulation that all citizen have the same right to get education, included who was disable. Students who had hearing impairment would face some difficulties in teaching learning process. It was because English skills taught included listening and speaking while deaf students had problems with hearing and usually with speaking. In addition, teacher of English had to prepare the appropriate teaching learning process which eased the students in understanding the materials. This thesis was aimed to answer these problems: (1) What materials are taught for deaf students at SMALB-B YASPENLUB Demak? (2) What methods are used in teaching English for deaf student at SMALB-B YASPENLUB Demak? (3) How does the teacher of English assess deaf student SMALB-B YASPENLUB Demak? Those problems were discussed through qualitative descriptive study at SMALB-B YASPENLUB Demak. The data were collected through observation, documentation and interview. All of data were analyzed using descriptive qualitative analysis. It meant that the research describes the social phenomena that being a focus of research. Based on the data collected by the researcher showed: (1) materials given to the students with hearing impairment were based on the KTSP which was specially composed for SLB-B. The materials given for eleventh grade students were expressions of asking and giving certainty, doubt, asking for repetition, paying attention, admiring, short message, advertisement, and announcement. Genre texts given at this class were procedure and report. The materials given for twelfth grade students were expressions of notice, politeness expression, giving interesting news, private letter, advertisement, brochure, announcement, oral message invitation, narrative and report. (2) there were three methods used by teacher. They were Grammar Translation Method (GTM), Silent Way and Question Answer. GTM was used by translating the materials into students’ native language. Silent way demanded the students to produce written language as much as possible. Question answer method was used in order to keep students’ concentration on the materials delivered by teacher. (3) Teacher used both formal and informal assessment to assess the students. Informal assessment usually used <b>oral</b> <b>question.</b> Besides checking students’ understanding, the teacher also could train students to communicate with others. Formal assessment was usually held in written test. It was adjusted the students’ condition. Keyword: English Language Teaching Learning, Deaf...|$|E
40|$|Every {{year the}} process of media {{concentration}} gathers pace and with it comes increasing concern for the impact on media quality, pluralism and diversity. Public concern about corporate and political dominance over media and information services is greater than ever. Confidence among readers, viewers, listeners and users of information is low {{and there is an}} increasing perception that journalism is failing to carry out its watchdog role in society because of the vested interests that drive the media business. Not surprisingly, politicians are worried, too. A group of European Parliament members expressed their exasperation to the European Commission in an <b>oral</b> <b>question</b> on 29 August 2002 noting that: ‘In 1997, 5 years after the Green Paper on pluralism and media concentration in the Internal Market, the Commission decided to postpone indefinitely any proposal for a directive to harmonise national laws on media ownership. This, despite a series of European Parliament resolutions calling for such a directive. ’ The Parliament has noted significant developments in the media field since the Commission, bowing to ferocious lobbying by European media organisations, decided to drop plans to regulate ownership. Not least have been developments in Italy where Prime Minister and media magnate Silvio Berlusconi has a stranglehold on both the private and public broadcasting media, creating a conflict of interest and a level of undue influence on media unheard of in any modern democracy. The enclosed survey on European Media Ownership, which has been supported by the European Commission as part of the EFJ project on ‘Globalisation and the Media: The European Agenda’, is an overdue but timely study that underlines the urgent need to respond to public concern about media concentration. The media concentration crisis has paralysed policy makers but as this paper indicates, it is time to stimulate fresh debate and prepare concrete actions to confront the challenge of corporate power in mass media. We hope this report will help to motivate people to work through their media unions, political parties and campaign groups to build support for policies to make the media more democratic and accountable. Above all, there is a pressing need to challenge the present political complacency over commercial and corporate exploitation of journalism that is eroding standards and undermining the importance of free media press to democratic society. All around Europe governments seem to be in retreat from long-held commitments to ensure that strong regulation plays its role in protecting and developing media. For years both the European Commission and the Council of Europe argued strongly that media products are not like other economic products - they have a social, cultural and democratic value that makes them special within market conditions. The market itself cannot protect pluralism and diversity. The public need to be properly informed which means that information services must be regulated outside the market imperatives of ratings, profits and commercial objectives. However, the political will to protect quality and pluralism in media services through effective regulation is weaker than ever. This study provides compelling evidence that this must change. If Europe’s media is to have a future even remotely connected to its traditional role as a watchdog over the exercise of political and corporate power and as a provider of quality information in the public interest, then consumers, citizens and people who work in the industry will have to work and campaign together. The EFJ will be a willing partner {{in the creation of a}} new and effective coalition for change.
