5|$|Another {{hypothesis}} is that the Anahim hotspot is supplied by a miniplume. These mantle plumes have their roots in the upper mantle but they may later originate from the lower mantle. Arguments for an Anahim miniplume are centred {{on the existence of}} two small dike swarms at the western (hence oldest) end of the Anahim Volcanic Belt. This assumption is in turn based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> that giant dike swarms mark the arrival of deep-seated mantle plumes.|$|E
5|$|Ian Drake, an {{assistant}} professor of Political Science and another critic of the compact, has argued that the constitution both requires and prohibits Congressional approval of the compact. In Drake's view, only a constitutional amendment could make the compact valid. Authors Michael Brody, Jennifer Hendricks, and Bradley Turflinger have examined the compact and concluded that the NPVIC, if successfully enacted, would pass constitutional muster. Brody has put forth a unique theory that the legality of the NPVIC could potentially hinge <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> that faithless electors are not necessarily obligated to vote for the candidate to whom they are pledged.|$|E
5|$|Hitsugaya {{lived with}} his {{grandmother}} and with Momo Hinamori, whom he considers a very close friend. Hitsugaya excelled in the Soul Reaper academy, becoming the youngest captain {{in the history of}} Soul Society with command over Squad 10. Introduced to the Gotei 13, Hitsugaya suspected Squad 3 captain Gin Ichimaru of foul play as the circumstances surrounding the coming execution of Rukia Kuchiki become more complicated. When Hinamori is manipulated into thinking that Hitsugaya killed Sōsuke Aizen, Hitsugaya attacks Gin <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> that he tricked her. The fight is interrupted when Hitsugaya dodges an attack that almost kills Hinamori, only to be intercepted by his lieutenant Rangiku Matsumoto. Seeing how destructive Rukia's execution is becoming, Hitsugaya tries to stop it by appealing to the Chamber 46, only to discover all members were murdered by Aizen, who faked his death. When Hitsugaya discovers Hinamori injured, Hitsugaya tries to kill Aizen but is defeated.|$|E

5|$|In The Ant and the Grasshopper, a {{grasshopper}} squanders {{the spring}} and summer months on singing while the ants put food away for the winter; when winter comes, the hungry grasshopper begs the ants for food, but the ants turn him away. Andrew Stanton and Joe Ranft hit <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> that the grasshopper could just take the food. After Stanton had completed a draft of the script, he came to doubt one of the story's main pillars – that the Circus Bugs that had come to the colony to cheat the ants would instead stay and fight. He thought the Circus Bugs were unlikable characters as liars and that it was unrealistic for them to undergo a complete personality change. Also, no particularly good reason existed for Circus Bugs to stay with the ant colony during the second act. Although the film was already far along, Stanton concluded that the story needed a different approach.|$|E
5|$|On 3 September 1939, Britain {{declared}} war when its ultimatum for Germany {{to withdraw from}} Poland expired. Because the Statute of Westminster {{had not yet been}} ratified by the Australian parliament, any declaration of war by the UK applied to Australia by default. In some other Commonwealth Dominions, such as South Africa and Canada, there were intense parliamentary debates before the declaration of war was accepted. Australian Prime Minister Robert Menzies asked the British government to notify Germany that Australia was an associate of the United Kingdom. Menzies' support for the war was based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> of an imperial defence system, upon which he believed Australia relied and which would be destroyed if the UK was defeated. This position was generally accepted by the Australian public, although there was little enthusiasm for war.|$|E

40|$|Studies in {{the history}} of politeness in English have {{generally}} relied <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>notions</b> of positive and negative face. While earlier work argued that a general trend from positive politeness to negative politeness can be observed, more recent work has shown that in Old English and in Middle English face concerns were not as important as in Modern English and that, in certain contexts, there are also opposing tendencies from negative to positive politeness. In this paper, I focus in more detail <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>notions</b> of positive and negative face and follow up earlier suggestions that for negative face a clear distinction must be made between deference politeness and non-imposition politeness.
