Mark, which is most likely the earliest written gospel, has been considered for many decades the most historically accurate. John, the latest written gospel, differs considerably from the Synoptic Gospels, and thus is generally considered less reliable, although more and more scholars now also recognize that it may contain a core of older material as historically valuable as the Synoptic tradition or even more so.|$|E

40|$|Background: The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) -Criteria A 1 and A 2 for {{posttraumatic}} stress disorder (PTSD) have been discussed extensively, with several studies in adults or adolescents supporting the removal <b>of</b> <b>Criterion</b> A 2. However, solid research in children is missing. Objective: This study evaluated the DSM-Criteria A 1 and A 2 in predicting {{posttraumatic stress}} in children. Method: A sample of 588 Dutch school children, aged 8 - 18 years, completed a self-report questionnaire {{to determine if they}} met Criteria A 1 and/or A 2. Their posttraumatic stress response was assessed using the Children's Revised Impact of Event Scale. Results: The contribution <b>of</b> <b>Criterion</b> A 2 to the prediction of posttraumatic stress in children is of greater importance than the contribution <b>of</b> <b>Criterion</b> A 1. Children who met Criterion A 2 reported significantly higher levels of posttraumatic stress and were nine times more likely to develop probable PTSD than children who did not meet Criterion A 2. When Criterion A 1 was met, a child was only two times more likely to develop probable PTSD as compared with those where Criterion A 1 was not met. Furthermore, the low sensitivity <b>of</b> <b>Criterion</b> A 1 suggests that children may regularly develop severe posttraumatic stress in the absence <b>of</b> <b>Criterion</b> A 1. The remarkably high negative predictive value <b>of</b> <b>Criterion</b> A 2 indicates that if a child does not have a subjective reaction during an event that it is unlikely that he or she will develop PTSD. Conclusions: In contrast to most adult studies, {{the findings of this study}} emphasize the significant contribution <b>of</b> <b>Criterion</b> A 2 to the prediction of posttraumatic stress in children and raise fundamental questions about the value <b>of</b> the current <b>Criterion</b> A...|$|R

5|$|Autism {{is caused}} by a {{combination}} of genetic and environmental factors. Some cases are strongly associated with certain infections during pregnancy including rubella and use of alcohol or cocaine. Controversies surround other proposed environmental causes; for example the vaccine hypotheses, which have been disproven. Autism affects information processing in the brain by altering how nerve cells and their synapses connect and organize; how this occurs is not well understood. In the DSM V, autism is included within the autism spectrum (ASDs), as is Asperger syndrome, which lacks delays in cognitive development and language, and pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified (commonly abbreviated as PDD-NOS), which was diagnosed when the full set <b>of</b> <b>criteria</b> for autism or Asperger syndrome were not met.|$|E
5|$|In {{the absence}} of officially {{recognized}} diagnostic criteria, and beyond the ambit of the discourse on a broader set <b>of</b> <b>criteria</b> discussed above, the term attachment disorder has been increasingly used by some clinicians {{to refer to a}} broader set of children whose behavior may be affected by lack of a primary attachment figure, a seriously unhealthy attachment relationship with a primary caregiver, or a disrupted attachment relationship. Although there are no studies examining diagnostic accuracy, concern is expressed as to the potential for over-diagnosis based on broad checklists and 'snapshots'. This form of therapy, including diagnosis and accompanying parenting techniques, is scientifically unvalidated and is not considered to be part of mainstream psychology or, despite its name, to be based on attachment theory, with which it is considered incompatible. It has been described as potentially abusive and a pseudoscientific intervention, that has resulted in tragic outcomes for children.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{stressor}} criterion (criterion A) in the DSM-IV {{diagnosis of}} {{posttraumatic stress disorder}} (PTSD) is frequently questioned. To explore the clinical and diagnostic usefulness <b>of</b> <b>criterion</b> A, we examined its value in predicting and capturing PTSD symptom clusters (criteria B-D) {{in a sample of}} trauma survivors. METHOD: We studied 342 adult German-speaking Swiss tourists affected by the 2004 tsunami. We analyzed sensitivity and specificity, predictive value and variance explanation <b>of</b> <b>criterion</b> A for evoking PTSD criteria B-D. RESULTS: Sensitivity <b>of</b> <b>criterion</b> A for PTSD criteria B-D was 93. 2 %, while positive predictive value was 23. 1 %. Criterion A made a small, yet statistically significant contribution of 7. 5 % for PTSD symptom clusters B-D. CONCLUSION: The assessment <b>of</b> <b>criterion</b> A (A 1 and A 2) is not necessary for the identification of individuals suffering from PTSD symptoms according to DSM-IV. We suggest therefore that criterion A is a dispensable part of the diagnosis of PTSD...|$|R

5|$|The first {{indication}} of the franchises' displeasure with their parent over this issue came in 2005 and involved claims by a Manhattan-based franchise that the company failed {{to take into account}} local market conditions when setting prices. E-Z Eating Corp., operator of five restaurants in New York and owned by brother-sister partners Elizabeth and Luan Sadik, had been struggling after the 9/11 terrorist attacks but had been in a company-sponsored turn around program when Burger King started its new value program in 2006. The program required all locations to carry a specific set of products at a discounted price, with limited exemptions for certain locations that met a set <b>of</b> <b>criteria.</b> The Sadiks applied for an exemption to the pricing requirement but were turned down by Burger King. In response to the denial, the Sadiks closed two of their locations without consulting Burger King and refused to implement the scheme in their other two locations. Burger King responded by suing the company in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida for breach of contract, and eventually revoked the franchise agreement for the remaining two locations in January 2006. The Sadik's responded by filing their own lawsuit in 2008 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York claiming that Burger King had engaged in a breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair in its actions towards the franchise. The actions were eventually consolidated in a single case in the Southern District Court under Judge Maricia G. Cooke, where Burger King requested and was granted a summary judgement against the Sadiks. The judgment was upheld on appeal by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in June 2009.|$|E
