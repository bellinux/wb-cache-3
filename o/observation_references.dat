Thus far, the model fitting procedure in EwE has been carried out manually: a repetitive task involving setting > 1000 specific individual searches to find the statistically ‘best fit’ model. The novel fitting procedure automates the manual procedure therefore producing accurate results and lets the modeller concentrate on investigating the ‘best fit’ model for ecological accuracy...|$|R

30|$|Would a {{wholesale}} change in grazing practices {{that reduces the}} latency of livestock within a pasture eliminate the negative impacts of partial rest and thereby improve rangeland ecosystems worldwide? To think to suggest so would be naïve. Rather, a comprehensive appreciation for the many causes of land degradation (fire, aquifer degradation, along with overgrazing) needs {{to take on a}} holistic approach including a thorough understanding of livestock grazing, fire, hydrology, and climatic variability, as well as the socio-cultural aspects within which this issue is integrally tied (Savory 1999; Munro 2003). By itself, understanding livestock grazing practices and their effects is a hugely significant question and it is certain that some will argue the suggested approach will not yield the expected results in spite of the historical <b>observations</b> <b>referenced</b> throughout this paper suggesting otherwise. This then becomes both a dilemma and a challenge for the future of rangeland ecosystems, range science, range managers, and graziers across the globe.|$|R
40|$|Playing {{music in}} {{ensemble}} represents a unique human condition/performance where musicians should rely on empathic relationships. Recent theories attribute to frontal Brodmann areas (BAs) 44 / 45 and 10 / 11 a neural basis for "emotional" and "cognitive" empathy. We hypothesized that activity of these structures reflects empathy trait in professional musicians playing in ensemble. Simultaneous electroencephalographic (EEG) alpha rhythms (8 - 12 Hz) {{were recorded in}} three saxophone quartets during music performance in ensemble (EXECUTION), video observation of their own performance (OBSERVATION), a control task (CONTROL), and resting state (RESTING). EEG source estimation was performed. Results showed that the higher the empathy quotient test score, the higher the alpha desynchronization in right BA 44 / 45 during the <b>OBSERVATION</b> <b>referenced</b> to RESTING condition. Empathy trait score and alpha desynchronization were not correlated in other control areas or in EXECUTION/CONTROL conditions. These results suggest that alpha rhythms in BA 44 / 45 reflect "emotional" empathy in musicians observing own performance. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

30|$|Meek et al. (1985) also {{analysed}} {{almost a}} year of radar observations made near Saskatoon, Canada, for gravity wave horizontal scales and found a similar statistic. Walterscheid et al. (1999) analysed OH airglow imager data and found a higher frequency of occurrence of QM waves, varying from 41 % of the observational time in winter, to 62 % in summer. Reid et al. (1987), Reid and Woithe’s (2005) and Walterscheid et al.’s (1999) observations are all for data from Adelaide, Australia. Based on these observational studies, we could argue that QM waves are present between 25 and 60 % of the time. An additional complication {{in this context is}} whether the QM waves detected in airglow observations are freely propagating or ducted waves. The radar <b>observations</b> <b>referenced</b> above were able to identify features consistent with propagating gravity waves over a range of heights, whereas single-colour airglow observations are single height measurements, and so restricted in interpretation.

40|$|We study a {{mean-variance}} portfolio selection problem under {{a hidden}} Markovian regime-switching Black-Scholes-Merton economy. Under this model, the appreciation rate of a risky share is modulated by a continuous-time, finite-state hidden Markov chain whose states represent different states of an economy. We consider {{the general situation}} where an economic agent cannot observe the "true" state of the underlying economy and wishes to minimize the variance of the terminal wealth for a fixed level of expected terminal wealth with access only to information about the price processes. By exploiting the separation principle, we discuss the mean-variance portfolio selection problem and the filtering-estimation problem separately. We determine an explicit solution to the mean-variance problem using the stochastic maximum principle {{so that we do}} not need the assumption of Markovian controls. We also provide robust estimates of the hidden state of the chain and develop a robust filter-based EM algorithm for online recursive estimates of the unknown parameters in the model. This simplifies the filtering-estimation problem.

The <b>observations</b> (<b>references)</b> are expected to indicate a process of multiple symbiosis through which a discipline becomes differently dependent upon different disciplines involved In order to simplify the mesurement process the various dependences of two sciences are clustered into four dimensions: Intradependence, Interdependence, Homodependence and Heterodependence.
