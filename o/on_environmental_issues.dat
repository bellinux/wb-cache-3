5|$|In 1970, Denver was {{selected}} to host the 1976 Winter Olympics to coincide with Colorado's centennial celebration, but in November 1972, Colorado voters struck down ballot initiatives allocating public funds {{to pay for the}} high costs of the games, which were subsequently moved to Innsbruck, Austria. The notoriety of becoming the only city ever to decline to host an Olympiad after being selected has made subsequent bids difficult. The movement against hosting the games was based largely <b>on</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>issues</b> and was led by State Representative Richard Lamm, who was subsequently elected to three terms (1975–87) as Colorado governor. Denver explored a potential bid for the 2022 Winter Olympics, but no bid will be submitted.|$|E

In 2007 Steinholt was elected as Red Nordland's leading candidate in the local elections of 2007. Steinholt had a very short election campaign, but she managed to make several notable appearances. Steinholt focused <b>on</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>issues</b> during the campaign, and opposed the establishment of a petroleum plant in northern Norway. Under her leadership, Red Norddland received 2,956 votes, 3.0 percent of the votes, an increase of 0.9% from the previous local election in 2003. Red won another seat on the Nordland County Council during the election; Steinholt became the youngest member of the council.|$|E

5|$|The herd {{has been}} studied {{periodically}} since the late 1980s, with researchers recommending various management strategies depending on the focus of their study. Current herd levels {{have been shown to}} {{have a negative effect on}} their environment, and researchers focused <b>on</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>issues</b> recommend a severe reduction in herd numbers. Other researchers, looking at genetic variability, state that a herd size nearly as large as current is necessary to prevent inbreeding, but also state the herd is not genetically unique enough to warrant special preservation. The National Park Service has no current management plan for the horses, and their one effort to create one was blocked by Jack Kingston, a Georgia member of the US House of Representatives.|$|E
5|$|<b>On</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>issues,</b> Mathias {{established}} a {{record as a}} strong advocate of the Chesapeake Bay. After touring the bay shoreline in 1973, he sponsored legislation {{that led to a}} study by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) two years later, which was one of the first reports that made the public aware of harmful levels of nutrients and toxins in the waters. As a result, the report was one of the catalysts for cleanup efforts, and evolved into the Chesapeake Bay Program. In recognition, the Charles Mathias Laboratory, part of the Smithsonian Institution, was established in 1988 as a research facility to analyze human impact on the bay. In 1990, the Mathias Medal was established by Maryland Sea Grant at the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science as further acknowledgment of Mathias' environmental record. In 2003, thirty years after he launched a study of the Chesapeake, Mathias was recognized by the Army Corps of Engineers for the influential role he played initiating restoration efforts.|$|E
5|$|The {{screenplay}} by Hampton Fancher was optioned in 1977. Producer Michael Deeley {{became interested in}} Fancher's draft and convinced director Ridley Scott to film it. Scott had previously declined the project, but after leaving the slow production of Dune, wanted a faster-paced project to take his mind off his older brother's recent death. He joined the project on February 21, 1980, and managed to push up the promised Filmways financing from US$13million to $15million. Fancher's script focused more <b>on</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>issues</b> and less on issues of humanity and religion, which are prominent in the novel and Scott wanted changes. Fancher found a cinema treatment by William S. Burroughs for Alan E. Nourse's novel The Bladerunner (1974), titled Blade Runner (a movie). Scott liked the name, so Deeley obtained {{the rights to the}} titles. Eventually he hired David Peoples to rewrite the script and Fancher left the job over the issue on December 21, 1980, although he later returned to contribute additional rewrites.|$|E
