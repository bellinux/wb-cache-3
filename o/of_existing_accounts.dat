60|$|The {{history of}} the life of every {{individual}} who has, for any reason, attracted extensively the attention of mankind, has been written in a great variety of ways by a multitude of authors, and persons sometimes wonder why we should have so many different accounts of the same thing. The reason is, that each one of these accounts is intended for a different set of readers, who read with ideas and purposes widely dissimilar from each other. Among the twenty millions of people in the United States, there are perhaps two millions, between the ages of fifteen and twenty-five, who wish to become acquainted, in general, with the leading events in the {{history of the}} Old World, and of ancient times, but who, coming upon the stage in this land and at this period, have ideas and conceptions so widely different from those of other nations and of other times, that a mere republication <b>of</b> <b>existing</b> <b>accounts</b> is not what they require. The story must be told expressly for them. The things that are to be explained, the points that are to be brought out, the comparative degree of prominence to be given to the various particulars, will all be different, on account of the difference in the situation, the ideas, and the objects of these new readers, compared with those of the various other classes of readers which former authors have had in view. It is for this reason, and with this view, that the present series of historical narratives is presented to the public. The author, having had some opportunity to become acquainted with the position, the ideas, and the intellectual wants of those whom he addresses, presents the result of his labors to them, with the hope that it may be found successful in accomplishing its design.|$|E

In 2007, Saul published Simple Sentences, Substitution and Intuitions (Oxford University Press) in which she develops her views on these issues with attention to their methodological implications.

40|$|Abstract: The {{increased}} use of advanced composites in aerospace manufacturing {{has led to the}} development of new production processes and technology The implementation of advanced composites manufacturing technology is poorly served by traditional cost accounting methods, which distort costs by using inappropriate volume-based allocations of overhead. Activity-based costing has emerged as a methodology, which provides accurate allocation of costs to products or activities by their usage of company resources. Better designs may also be produced if designers could evaluate the cost implications of their choices early in the design process. This paper describes a methodology whereby companies can improve the quality of product cost estimation at the conceptual design phase using intelligent searching and arrangement <b>of</b> <b>existing</b> <b>accounting</b> data enabling designers to access the activity cost information more readily. This concept has a considerable scope for application in industry because it will allow companies, to make better use of the said information already recorded in their information system...|$|R

It is concluded that the concept of socially responsible business corresponds only to the kind of business where the manager makes decisions based on the current legislation and ethical standards maximizing profits. It corresponds to ethical or ethically universal business. The purpose of the accounting system in this case is to provide managers with sufficient information necessary for conducting business in accordance with the current legislation, ethical norms maximizing profits. The author proves that the variability of accounting information allows managers to take into account the interests of the majority of stakeholders and balance their interests in the context of ethical business.

40|$|Scientology has {{consistently}} been interpreted by sociologists {{in terms of}} rationalization. However, {{a review of existing}} studies shows that the meaning attached to this term varies around a central ambiguity summed up as the ‘‘iron cage’ ’ versus ‘‘charisma’’. The author argues that this ambiguity arises from ambivalence over the public meaning of science in modernity. Through a re-examination <b>of</b> <b>existing</b> <b>accounts</b> of Scientology provided by Wilson, Whitehead, and Wallis, the author offers a revised interpretation that attempts to resolve the ambiguity through emphasizing the socially constructed and rhetorical nature of the public meaning of science. With this, rationalization appears no longer as an external logic dictated by science, but as resource of persuasion that social groups may construct differently on different occasions to suit different specific purposes such as legitimation of their actions and beliefs. Accordingly, NRMs may fruitfully be studied as active attempts to develop an ethics of conduct based in part on interpretations of the public mean-ing of science...|$|E

In particular, it aims to demonstrate a new approach of climate change accounting in order to overcome some important weaknesses of previous environmental accounting methods, such as accuracy and reliability. Currently, the majority <b>of</b> <b>existing</b> <b>accounting</b> methods record information on climate change on a voluntary basis. Even though they may assist businesses in designing essential environmental strategies and help public policy entities improve their knowledge on the results of such strategies, the informal nature of the accounting standards and the variable type of financial and non-financial information make the use of such models untrustworthy and complicated.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{limitation}} <b>of</b> <b>existing</b> <b>accounting</b> {{systems is}} {{their lack of}} knowledge sharing and knowledge reuse, which makes the design and implementation of new accounting systems time consuming and expensive. An important requirement for knowledge sharing and reuse is {{the existence of a}} common semantic infrastructure. In this article we use McCarthy’s (1982) Resource-Event-Agent (REA) model as a common semantic infrastructure in an accounting context. The objective is to make knowledge-intensive use of REA to share accounting concepts across functional boundaries and to reuse these concepts in different applications and different systems, an approach we call augmented intensional reasoning. Intensional reasoning is the active use of conceptual structures in information systems operations such as design and information retrieval. For augmented intensional reasoning, the conceptual structures are extended with domain-specific REA knowledge. Sections II and III describe different dimensions of augmented intensional reasoning: the REA primitives, the technological features needed to support augmented intensional reasoning, the need for epistemologically-adequate representations to make augmented intensional reasoning feasible, and the practical necessity of implementation compromises. Sections IV and...|$|R

We find that the stock returns of a significant fraction of the U. S. companies move with the exchange rate, while few of the Japanese returns that we observe do so. We next examine more closely the sensitivity of the U. S. firms by linking the U. S. estimates cross-sectionally to accounting-based measures of currency risk. We suggest that the sensitivity estimates can provide a benchmark for assessing the adequacy <b>of</b> <b>existing</b> <b>accounting</b> measures <b>of</b> currency risk. Benchmarked in this way, the reported measures that we examine appear to provide a significant, though only partial, picture of the exchange rate exposure of U. S. banking institutions.

Co-extensional analysis {{can provide a}} means of illustrating how the referents of these complex indefinite expressions are cohesively tied to the preceding text and on-going discourse. The writer does not simply rely on textual cohesion, but also taps into the cultural knowledge assumed as shared by the readership, i.e. the writer makes out that the information is ‘hearer-old’, given the likely readership of this of kind of article. Another strategy to guide interpretation is {{the continuation of the}} identity chain of reference. In each of the expressions, there is something to link the expression to the specific participant, whether it is textual ties, contextual/discoursal ties or continuity of reference. Thus, there is an assumption of cooperation and adherence to the principle of distant responsibility towards the reader (Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs 1986 : 34), through the provision of a platform for the interpretation of the expression as referring to the established participant.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the status of}} historical legacies in debates on the reform of public administration in East Central Europe.

First, legacy arguments tend to zoom in on {{the negative effects of}} the communist past, yet there is not one but many legacies that matter for post-communist reforms and these many legacies have to be carefully distinguished. Second, legacy explanations tend to search for broad similarities between the administrative past and the present set-up of East Central European administrations in order to demonstrate the importance of the legacy. The identification of similarities is however not sufficient for the identification of legacy effects. Instead, the paper argues in favour of the identification of causal mechanisms of legacification to explain recent administrative developments in East Central Europe. Finally, the paper draws attention to the interaction of legacy effects with other determinants of administrative reform such as European integration and political parties...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} the so-called adverbial {{use of the}} wh-pronoun was (‘what’), which establishes a non-standard interrogative construction type in German. It argues that the adverbial use of was (‘what’) {{is based on the}} lexi-cal properties of a categorically deficient pronoun was (‘what’), which bears a causal meaning. In addition, adverbial was (‘what’) differs from canonical argument was (‘what’) as it is analyzed as a functor which is generated in clause-initial position. By means of empirical facts mainly provided by d’Avis (2001) it is shown that was (‘what’) behaves ambivalently regarding the wh-property: On the one hand, was (‘what’) can introduce an interrogative clause, {{but on the other hand}} it cannot license wh-phrases in situ. While formally analyzing the data against the background <b>of</b> <b>existing</b> <b>accounts</b> on wh-interrogatives couched in the framework of Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar, an analysis is developed that separates two pieces of information to keep track of the wh-information percolating in an interrogative clause. Whereas the WH-value models wh-fronting and pied-piping phenomena, the QUE value links syn-tactic and semantic information and thus keeps track of wh-in-situ phrases. ...|$|E
