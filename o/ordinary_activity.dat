They made no sounds at all, either in flying or trying to speak, and they conversed mainly by means of quick signals made with their wooden fingers or lips.

60|$|In {{the poems}} of 1842 {{we have the}} secret of Tennyson's {{eminence}} as a poet {{as well as the}} secret of his limitations. He appears to have been constitutionally deficient in what the Greeks called 'architektoniké', combination and disposition on a large scale. The measure of his power as a constructive artist is given us in the poem in which the English idylls may be said to culminate, namely, 'Enoch Arden'. 'In Memoriam' and the 'Idylls of the King' have a sort of spiritual unity, but they are a series of fragments tacked rather than fused together. It is the same with 'Maud', and it is the same with 'The Princess'. His poems have always a tendency to resolve themselves into a series of cameos: it is only the short poems which have organic unity. A gift of felicitous and musical expression which is absolutely marvellous; an instinctive sympathy with what is best and most elevated in the sphere of ordinary life, of ordinary thought and sentiment, of <b>ordinary</b> <b>activity</b> with consummate representative power; a most rare faculty of seizing and fixing in very perfect form what is commonly so inexpressible because so impalpable and evanescent in emotion and expression; a power of catching and rendering the charm of nature with a fidelity and vividness which resemble magic; and lastly, unrivalled skill in choosing, repolishing and remounting the gems which are our common inheritance from the past: these are the gifts which will secure permanence for his work as long as the English language lasts.|$|E

60|$|Poetry is not {{the proper}} antithesis to prose, but to science. Poetry is opposed to science, and prose to metre. The proper and {{immediate}} object of science is the acquirement, or communication, of truth; the proper and immediate object of poetry is the communication of immediate pleasure. This definition is useful; but as it would include novels and other works of fiction, which yet we do not call poems, {{there must be some}} additional character by which poetry is not only divided from opposites, but likewise distinguished from disparate, though similar, modes of composition. Now how is this to be effected? In animated prose, the beauties of nature, and the passions and accidents of human nature, are often expressed in that natural language which the contemplation of them would suggest to a pure and benevolent mind; yet still neither we nor the writers call such a work a poem, though no work could deserve that name which did not include all this, together with something else. What is this? It is that pleasurable emotion, that peculiar state and degree of excitement, which arises in the poet himself in the act of composition;--and in order to understand this, we must combine a more than ordinary sympathy with the objects, emotions, or incidents contemplated by the poet, consequent on a more than common sensibility, with a more than <b>ordinary</b> <b>activity</b> of the mind in respect of the fancy and the imagination. Hence is produced a more vivid reflection of the truths of nature and of the human heart, united with a constant activity modifying and correcting these truths by that sort of pleasurable emotion, which the exertion of all our faculties gives in a certain degree; but which can only be felt in perfection under the full play of those powers of mind, which are spontaneous rather than voluntary, and in which the effort required bears no proportion to the activity enjoyed. This is the state which permits the production of a highly pleasurable whole, of which each part shall also communicate for itself a distinct and conscious pleasure; and hence arises the definition, which I trust is now intelligible, that poetry, or rather a poem, is a species of composition, opposed to science, as having intellectual pleasure for its object, and as attaining its end by the use of language natural to us in a state of excitement,--but distinguished from other species of composition, not excluded by the former criterion, by permitting a pleasure from the whole consistent with a consciousness of pleasure from the component parts;--and the perfection of which is, to communicate from each part the greatest immediate pleasure compatible with the largest sum of pleasure on the whole. This, of course, will vary with the different modes of poetry;--and that splendour of particular lines, which would be worthy of admiration in an impassioned elegy, or a short indignant satire, would be a blemish and proof of vile taste in a tragedy or an epic poem.|$|E

The article illustrates analytic procedures for recovering such orientations and thus for understanding how people embed and reveal practice, with and for one another, in interaction. It is argued that the practice-turn should not overlook the fact that practice is, in the first instance, a members' phenomenon, something that members draw upon, monitor and orient to in real time interaction...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Previous {{studies have}} shown that various factors such as {{emotional}} stress can trigger of MI in susceptible persons. More studies are needed to evaluate the characteristics of patients regarding to emotional stress, heavy work, routine activity, infection or rest before occurrence of MI. Methods: We studied 608 consecutive hospitalized in CCUs from May 2000 to October 2001. For patients, questionnaires including demographic, clinical and paraclinical characteristics were completed and data analyzed. Results: In this study rest (33. 4 %) and <b>ordinary</b> <b>activity</b> (32. 4 %) were more prevalent among the MI situations and infection had the lowest prevalence (0. 7 %). In patients higher than 45 years we had similar results, but in age group younger than 45 year <b>ordinary</b> <b>activity</b> (30. 6 %) and after heavy work (20. 8 %) had the highest prevalence before occurring of MI. In Diabetic patients, MI developed in sleep situation more frequently. (17. 8 %),(P= 0. 03) 52. 5 % of MI mortality occurred in rest situation. (P= 0. 009) Conclusion: Rest had the highest prevalence of MI compared to other situations but in age group younger than 45 years MI after heavy work had the highest prevalence.
