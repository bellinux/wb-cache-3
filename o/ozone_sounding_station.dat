40|$|A {{validation}} of the GOME- 2 ozone profiles has been carried out. This {{has been done by}} using <b>ozone</b> <b>sounding</b> data, which have a vertical resolution of about 100 m and is measuring ozone from the surface up to about 34 km. GOME- 2 ozone data was made available by KNMI at pre-selected sites. The reference data which was available limited this study to the European mid-latitudes and European Nordic region. The algorithm version used for this retrieval of GOME- 2 ozone profiles is 3. 2. For this study, data from other <b>ozone</b> <b>sounding</b> <b>stations</b> besides Uccle have been used (De Bilt, Hohenpeissenberg, Payerne, NY-Alesund, Sodankyla and Lerwick). GOME- 2 ozone profiles show sensibly better results at European mid-latitudes than at Nordic latitudes, especially in the tropopause region. The target accuracies for the ozone profiles are respectively 30 % in the troposphere and 15 % in the stratosphere. Data analysis over the time period March 2007 - February 2008 has shown that this accuracy is reached at least partially in the stratosphere. In the UTLS region, and especially at high latitudes, GOME- 2 ozone profiles are least accurate. In the troposphere, mean relative differences are reasonable, at least at midlatitudes, but the information content in the lower levels is relatively low...|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{analysis}} of 2. 5 years of weekly <b>ozone</b> <b>soundings</b> conducted at a new monitoring station in Paramaribo, Surinam (6 deg N, 55 deg W). This is currently {{one of only three}} <b>ozone</b> <b>sounding</b> <b>stations</b> in the northern hemisphere (NH) tropics, and {{the only one in the}} equatorial Atlantic region. Paramaribo is part of the Southern Hemisphere ADditional Ozone Sounding program (SHADOZ). Due to its position close to the equator, the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) passes over Paramaribo twice per year, which results in a semi-annual seasonality of many parameters including relative humidity and ozone. The dataset from Paramaribo is used to: (1) evaluate ozone variability relative to precipitation, atmospheric circulation patterns and biomass burning; (2) contrast ozone at the NH equatorial Atlantic with that at nearby southern hemisphere (SH) stations Natal (6 deg S, 35 deg W) and Ascension (8 deg S, 14 deg W); (3) compare the seasonality of tropospheric ozone with a satellite-derived ozone product: Tropical Tropospheric Ozone Columns from the Modified Residual method (MR-TTOC). We find that Paramaribo is a distinctly Atlantic station. Despite its position north of the equator, it resembles nearby SH stations during most of the year. Transport patterns in the lower and middle troposphere during February and March differ from SH stations, which leads to a seasonality of ozone with two maxima. MR-TTOC over Paramaribo does not match the observed seasonality of ozone due to the use of a SH ozone sonde climatology in the MR method. The Paramaribo ozone record is used to suggest an improvement for northern hemisphere MR-TTOC retrievals. We conclude that station Paramaribo shows unique features in the region, and clearly adds new information to the existing SHADOZ record...|$|R
40|$|Total {{column and}} stratospheric ozone levels at {{mid-latitudes}} often reveal strong fluctuations on time scales of days caused by dynamic processes. In {{some cases the}} total ozone column is distinctly reduced below climatological values. Here, a very low total ozone episode around 19 January 2006 over Western Europe is investigated when the observed total ozone column over Uccle (BE), measured by a Brewer spectrophotometer, reached a daily minimum of 200 DU, the lowest recorded value at this station. In order to investigate the mechanisms leading to the ozone minimum, the present study used data from (i) six <b>ozone</b> <b>sounding</b> <b>stations</b> in Western and Middle Europe, (ii) ECMWF meteorological fields, (iii) a simulation of the CLaMS model for January 2006, (iv) a multi-year run of the chemistry transport model KASIMA, and (v) a six-year run of the climate chemistry model ECHAM 5 /MESSy 1. The ozone decrease at different heights was quantified and it was determined to what extent different transport mechanisms, and instantaneous, in-situ chemical ozone depletion contributed to the event. All three models reproduced the evolution and formation of the event. The ozone column decrease between &Theta;= 300 and 750 K was strongest at Uccle (BE) and De Bilt (NL) with 108 and 103 DU, respectively, and somewhat lower at Hohenpeissenberg (DE), Payerne (CH), Prague (CZ) and Lerwick (UK) with 85, 84, 83 and 74 DU, respectively. This analysis demonstrated that mainly the displacement of the ozone depleted polar vortex contributed to the ozone column decrease. Advection of ozone-poor low-latitude air masses was important in the UTLS region. The vertical displacement of isentropes connected with divergence of {{air out of the}} column was found to be of minor importance compared to the horizontal transport processes. Severe low total ozone episodes seem to occur when the mentioned mechanisms are superimposed. Instantaneous, in-situ chemical ozone depletion accounted for only 2 &plusmn; 1 % of the overall total ozone decrease at the <b>sounding</b> <b>stations...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{environmental}} simulation facility {{established at}} the Forschungszentrum Juelich (FZJ) is designed to investigate the performance {{of different types of}} balloon borne ozone sensors as well as air borne humidity sensors to measure the vertical distribution of atmospheric ozone and water vapor, respectively. Key component of the facility is a temperature and pressure controlled simulation chamber with a test room volume of about 500 liter (80 x 80 x 80 cm) whereby pressure as well as temperature can be dynamically regulated between 5 and 1000 hPa and between 200 and 300 K (- 2 K/min #<=# rate #<=# + 2 K/min) respectively. The volume mixing ratio of ozone can be dynamically regulated between 5 and 10000 ppbv up to a simulation altitude of about 35 km. The relative humidity in the chamber can be varied from about 95 % down to 2 % over a temperature range between + 30 C and - 70 C and pressure range between 1000 and 100 hPa. Ozone and humidity sensing devices can be calibrated against accurate reference instruments. A fast response dual beam UV-photometer serves as ozone reference. For the calibration of the water vapor sensors a dew point hygrometer is used for lower/middle tropospheric humidity conditions, while for middle/upper tropospheric conditions a Lyman (#alpha#) fluorescence hygrometer serves as reference. The entire simulation process is computer controlled to provide reproducible conditions with respect to pressure, temperature, ozone concentration and humidity. Since 1994 the chamber is used for the regular (monthly) calibration of water vapor sensing devices which are flown aboard 5 civil ''in-service'' aircraft (Airbus-A 340) within the frame of the European project MOZAIC (measurement of ozone and water vapor on airbus in-service aircraft) for automatic monitoring of the water vapor distribution in the troposphere. The facility is also established as world calibration facility for ozone sondes (WCFOS) as part of the global atmosphere watch (GAW) program of the world meteorological organization (WMO). In the scope of this frame work several intercomparison experiments, JOSIE (=Juelich ozone sonde intercomparison experiment), were conducted to assess the performance of the major types of ozone sondes used within the global network of <b>ozone</b> <b>sounding</b> <b>stations.</b> Furthermore, the facility serves as platform to investigate the performance of new developed airborne sensing devices.

The values of Zs at fixed times appeared to be systematically too low as compared to Zr. The differences Zr-Zs increase with altitude; at 30 km the annual mean values of Zr-Zs (plus or minus standard deviation) vary between 590 plus or minus 910 m and 1410 plus or minus 1160 m, according to the pressure calibration of different manufacturing series of radiosondes. From these results it is found that around the 30 km level the ozone concentrations calculated from soundings with VIZ sondes are too low by 7. 5 to 14 percent, depending upon the manufacturing series of radiosondes. At least part of the discrepancy which has often been found between ozone profiles from balloon soundings and from other techniques such as rocket observations or Umkehr measurements may be explained by this effect. An altitude correction would have important consequences as to the climatology of ozone in the middle stratosphere as adopted at the moment. About half of the day-to-day variability of <b>ozone</b> observed from <b>soundings</b> with VIZ radiosondes above the 30 km level, is induced by the variability of Zr-Zs.

40|$|A global {{three-dimensional}} (i. e. latitude, longitude, altitude) climatology of {{tropospheric ozone}} {{is derived from}} the <b>ozone</b> <b>sounding</b> record by trajectory mapping. Approximately 52 000 ozonesonde profiles from more than 100 stations worldwide since 1962 are used. The small number of stations causes the set of <b>ozone</b> <b>soundings</b> to be sparse in geographical spacing. Here, forward and backward trajectory calculations are performed for each <b>sounding</b> to map <b>ozone</b> measurements to a number of other locations, and so to fill in the spatial domain. This is possible because the lifetime of ozone in the troposphere is of the order of weeks. This physically-based interpolation method offers obvious advantages over typical statistical interpolation methods. The trajectory-mapped ozone values show reasonable agreement, where they overlap, to the actual soundings, and the patterns produced separately by forward and backward trajectory calculations are similar. Major regional features of the tropospheric ozone distribution are clearly evident in the global maps. An interpolation algorithm based on spherical functions is further used for smoothing and to fill in remaining data gaps. The resulting three-dimensional global tropospheric ozone climatology facilitates visualization and comparison of different years, decades, and seasons, and offers some intriguing insights into the global variation of tropospheric ozone. It will be useful for climate and air quality model initialization and validation, and as an a priori climatology for satellite data retrievals.

Global <b>ozone</b> <b>soundings</b> comprising 51 898 profiles at 116 stations over 44 yr (1965 – 2008) are used, from which forward and backward trajectories are calculated from meteorological reanalysis data to map ozone measurements to other locations and so fill in the spatial domain. The resulting global ozone climatology is archived monthly for five decades from the 1960 s to the 2000 s on a grid of 5 ° × 5 ° × 1 km (latitude, longitude, and altitude), from the surface to 26 km altitude. It is also archived yearly for the same period. The climatology is validated at 20 selected ozonesonde stations by comparing the actual <b>ozone</b> <b>sounding</b> profile with that derived through trajectory mapping of <b>ozone</b> <b>sounding</b> data from all stations except the one being compared. The two sets of profiles are in good agreement, both overall with correlation coefficient r = 0. 991 and root mean square (RMS) of 224 ppbv and individually with r from 0. 975 to 0. 998 and RMS from 87 to 482 ppbv. The ozone climatology is also compared with two sets of satellite data from the Satellite Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) and the Optical Spectrography and InfraRed Imager System (OSIRIS). The ozone climatology compares well with SAGE and OSIRIS data in both seasonal and zonal means. The mean differences are generally quite small, with maximum differences of 20 % above 15 km. The agreement is better in the Northern Hemisphere, where there are more ozonesonde stations, than in the Southern Hemisphere; it is also better {{in the middle and}} high latitudes than in the tropics where reanalysis winds are less accurate. This ozone climatology captures known features in the stratosphere as well as seasonal and decadal variations of these features. The climatology clearly shows the depletion of ozone from the 1970 s to the mid 1990 s and ozone increases in the 2000 s in the lower stratosphere. When this climatology is used as the upper boundary condition in an Environment Canada operational chemical forecast model, the forecast is improved {{in the vicinity of the}} upper troposphere-lower stratosphere (UTLS) region. This ozone climatology is latitudinally, longitudinally, and vertically resolved and it offers more complete high latitude coverage as well as a much longer record than current satellite data.

An increase has been observed in equatorial radiance at 2550 A relative to 2900 A, which seems to indicate that the amount of ozone in the upper stratosphere is related to the eleven-year solar cycle...|$|R
40|$|The chemiluminescent rocket {{ozonesonde}} utilizing rhodamine-B as a detector and self-pumping for {{air sampling}} has been improved. The instrument employs standard meteorological sounding systems {{and is the}} only technique available for routine nighttime ozone measurements above balloon altitudes. The chemiluminescent detector, when properly calibrated, is shown to be specific to ozone, stable, and of sufficient sensitivity for accurate measurements of ozone from about 65 - 20 km. An error analysis indicates that the measured ozone profiles have an absolute accuracy of about + or - 12 % and a precision of about + or - 6 %. Approximately 20 flights have been conducted for geophysical investigations, while additional flights were conducted with other rocket and satellite <b>ozone</b> <b>soundings</b> for comparisons. In general, these comparisons showed good agreement...|$|R
