5|$|The prisoners {{realised}} that if {{they managed}} to fully counterfeit the dollars, their lives {{would no longer be}} safeguarded by the work they were undertaking, so they slowed their progress as much as they could. The journalist Lawrence Malkin, who wrote a history of Operation Bernhard, writes that prisoners considered this to have the tacit approval of Krüger, who would face front-line duty if Operation Bernhard ended. In August 1944 Salomon Smolianoff, a convicted forger, was added to the production team at Sachsenhausen to aid the counterfeiting of US dollars, although he also assisted in quality control for the pound notes. The Jewish prisoners working on the operation at the time complained to Krüger at having to work with a criminal, so he was given his <b>own</b> <b>room</b> to sleep in.|$|E
25|$|The {{dormitory}} {{is a big}} gothic {{room where}} the monks slept together: only the abbot was allowed to have his <b>own</b> <b>room.</b> In the 16th century the space was divided into individual cells. In the 1930s the cell walls were demolished.|$|E

25|$|Building on McKinley's {{effective}} use of the press, Roosevelt made the White House the center of news every day, providing interviews and photo opportunities. After noticing the reporters huddled outside the White House in the rain one day, he gave them their <b>own</b> <b>room</b> inside, effectively inventing the presidential press briefing. The grateful press, with unprecedented access to the White House, rewarded Roosevelt with ample coverage.|$|E
25|$|His father {{remarried}} {{when he was}} nine, {{but neither}} Weston nor his sister got along with their new stepmother and stepbrother. After May was married and left their home in 1897, Weston's father devoted {{most of his time}} to his new wife and her son.

25|$|After the war, Althusser {{was able}} to finally attend the École Normale Supérieure (ENS) in Paris. The school was {{sympathetic}} with his illness, allowing him to reside in his <b>own</b> <b>room</b> in the school infirmary. Althusser would live at the ENS in the Rue d'Ulm for decades, except for periods of hospitalization. His professional role within the school structure was ill-defined, leading to his nickname amongst the students Althusserarien ("Althusser good for nothing").|$|E
25|$|The {{start of}} season 3 in fall 1987 found Larry and Balki in a new, larger {{apartment}} where Balki had his <b>own</b> <b>room</b> instead of {{sleeping on a}} fold-out sofa. External shots clearly depict a new apartment building. According to season 6, episode 13, Larry and Balki's address is 711 Coldwell Street, Apt #209, Chicago, Illinois. The characters never made reference to the move, and Jennifer and Mary Anne were still co-tenants in the new surroundings.|$|E
25|$|On 12 April 1905 some Melbourne members {{formed the}} Bird Observers Club to {{facilitate}} {{more frequent and}} less formal meetings and field-trips. At this time, membership of the union was a prerequisite for membership of the club. In 1916, when the union acquired its <b>own</b> <b>room</b> for meetings and storage of donated specimens, it became impossible for the club to share {{the use of the}} room. This led to the club becoming inactive for the next few years, though it was successfully revived as an independent entity in 1927.|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} 1873 {{he started}} the {{practice}} of Christianity, when his devotee Shambu Charan Mallik read the Bible to him. Ramakrishna said that for several days he was filled with Christian thoughts and no longer thought {{of going to the}} Kali temple. Ramakrishna described a vision in which a picture of the Madonna and Child became alive and he had a vision in which Jesus merged with his body. In his <b>own</b> <b>room</b> amongst other divine pictures was one of Christ, and he burnt incense before it morning and evening. There was also a picture showing Jesus Christ saving St Peter from drowning in the water.|$|E
25|$|Nyarlathotep sends Carter {{on a great}} Inganok shantak-bird {{through space}} to the sunset city. Unfortunately, Carter realizes too late that the mocking Nyarlathotep has tricked him, and that instead he is being taken {{to the court of}} Azathoth {{at the center of the}} universe. At first believing he is doomed, Carter {{suddenly}} remembers that he is in a dream and saves himself by leaping from the great bird. As he falls, his thoughts turn toward New England, and he wakes to find that he is at last in his marvelous sunset city; no longer in the Dreamlands but in his <b>own</b> <b>room</b> in the waking world of Boston, looking out upon its architectural graces, suffused in a splendid sunrise.|$|E
25|$|Puyi's {{second choice}} {{for his wife}} was Wanrong, a Daur. She married Puyi in 1922 and became his Empress. Her father, Rong Yuan (榮源), was a Minister of Domestic Affairs. She was {{considered}} beautiful and came from a wealthy family. By Puyi's own account, he abandoned Wanrong in the bridal chamber {{and went back to}} his <b>own</b> <b>room.</b> He maintained that she was willing to be a wife in name only, in order to carry the title of Empress. The couple's relationship was good initially, and Puyi showed preference over Wenxiu for Wanrong and displayed trust in her. However, after Wenxiu left in 1931, Puyi blamed Wanrong and stopped speaking to her and ignored her presence. She became addicted to opium, and eventually died in a prison in Yanji, Jilin after being arrested by Chinese Communist soldiers.|$|E

500|$|Although {{he later}} praised Jorden, Johnson came to odds with him {{over what he}} {{considered}} to be Jorden's [...] "meanness" [...] of abilities. He discouraged his friend Taylor, who came to Pembroke in March, from having Jorden as his tutor, and Taylor was soon encouraged to go to Christ Church to be taught by Edmund Bateman. Johnson appreciated Bateman's skill as a lecturer, and he would often travel to meet Taylor to discuss the lectures. However, Johnson lacked the funds to even replace his shoes, and so he started to make the journey barefoot. In response, those of Christ Church began to mock Johnson, and he soon kept to his <b>own</b> <b>room</b> {{for the rest of}} his time at Pembroke, with Taylor visiting him instead.|$|E

[...] The note states that the tollbooth is being sent to another child who needs help finding his {{direction}} in life.

500|$|Despite being married, Beatrice {{fulfilled}} {{her promise}} to the Queen by continuing as her full-time confidante and secretary. Queen Victoria warmed to Henry, as she often did with other handsome, strong men. However, the Queen criticised Beatrice's conduct {{during her first}} pregnancy. When Beatrice stopped coming to the Queen's dinners a week before giving birth, preferring to eat alone in her room, the Queen wrote angrily to her physician, Dr James Reid, that, [...] "I [...] coming to dinner, and not simply moping in her <b>own</b> <b>room,</b> which is very bad for her. In my case I regularly came to dinner, except when I was really unwell (even when suffering a great deal) up to the very last day." [...] Beatrice, aided by chloroform, gave birth the following week to her first son, Alexander. Despite suffering a miscarriage {{in the early months}} of her marriage, Beatrice gave birth to four children: Alexander, called [...] "Drino", was born in 1886; Ena in 1887; Leopold in 1889 and Maurice in 1891. Following this, she took a polite and encouraging interest in social issues, such as conditions in the coal mines. However, this interest did not extend to changing the conditions of poverty, as it had done with her brother, the Prince of Wales.|$|E
500|$|Soon afterward, Barton is {{visited by}} two police detectives, who inform him that Charlie's {{real name is}} Karl [...] "Madman" [...] Mundt. Mundt is a serial killer wanted for several murders; after {{shooting}} his victims, they explain, he decapitates them and keeps the heads. Stunned, Barton returns {{to his room and}} examines the box. Placing it on his desk without opening it, he begins writing and produces the entire script in one sitting. After a night of celebratory dancing, Barton returns to find the detectives in his room, who, after handcuffing Barton to the bed, reveal they've found evidence of Mundt's latest murders. Each of the men notes how hot it is, before Charlie as the hotel is engulfed in flames. Running through the hallway, screaming [...] "I'll show you the life of the mind!", Charlie shoots the policemen with a shotgun. As the hallway burns, Charlie speaks with Barton about their lives and the hotel, breaks the bed frame to which Barton is handcuffed (thus freeing him), then retires to his <b>own</b> <b>room,</b> saying as he goes that he paid a visit to Barton's parents and uncle in New York. Barton leaves the still-burning hotel, carrying the box and his script. Shortly thereafter he attempts to telephone his family, but there is no answer.|$|E
