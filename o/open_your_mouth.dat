2500|$|Increasingly impatient, Juror 7 {{changes his}} vote to hasten the deliberation, which earns him {{the ire of}} Jurors 3 and 11, both on {{opposite}} sides of the debate. Juror 11, an immigrant from Europe, presses Juror 7 about using his vote frivolously, until Juror 7 admits that he truly believes the boy is not guilty. Then, Jurors 12 and 1 change their votes, leaving only three dissenters: Jurors 3, 4, and 10. Juror 10 vents a torrent of condemnation of slum-born people, claiming they are no better than animals who kill for fun. All jurors literally turn their backs on him, except for Juror 4, who tells him to [...] "Sit down and don't <b>open</b> <b>your</b> <b>mouth</b> again."

"And {{you have}} <b>opened</b> <b>your</b> <b>mouth</b> {{to say a}} very {{sensible}} thing Miss Harriet," [...] said Mick; [...] "but if I were Lord Paramount for eight-and-forty hours, I'd soon settle that question. Wouldn't I fire a broadside into their 'double deckers?' The battle of Navarino at Mowbray fair with fourteen squibs from the admiral's ship going off at the same time, should be nothing to it." ...|$|R
