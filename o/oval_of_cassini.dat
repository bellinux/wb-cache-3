Further, {{it is evident that}} B(A) can contain the spectra of related n × n matrices. We show here that the spectra of these related matrices can fill out B(A). Finally, if G R (A) denotes the minimal Gerˇsgorin set for A, we show that G R (A) ⊆ B(A). Key words.

Hence, the n-th Minkowski power of N 1 =nA yields the original set A. Minkowski rootextractions are fundamental operations in the Minkowski geometric algebra of complex sets: depending on the natureof A, subtle issues concerning the existence, uniqueness, and minimality or maximality of N 1 =nA may arise. For adomain A with a smooth boundary that is strictly logarithmically convex, we show that each connected component ofthe &quot;ordinary &quot; root A 1 =n = f z j zn 2 A g is a Minkowski n-th root. N 1 =nA has a more intricate structure, however,when @A has logarithmic inflections.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to find the numerical solution of the Dirichlet problem for the Helmholtz equation for a smooth superellipsoid. The superellipsoid is a shape that is controlled by two parameters. There are some numerical issues {{in this type of}} an analysis; any integration method is affected by the wave number k, because of the oscillatory behavior of the fundamental solution. In this case we could only obtain good numerical results for super ellipsoids that were more shaped like super cones, which is a narrow range of super ellipsoids. The formula for these shapes was: $x=cos(x) sin(y) ^{n},y=sin(x) sin(y) ^{n},z=cos(y) $ where $n$ varied from 0. 5 to 4. The Helmholtz equation, which is the modified wave equation, is used in many scattering problems. This project was funded by NASA RI Space Grant for testing of the Dirichlet boundary condition for the shape of the superellipsoid. One practical value of all these computations can be getting a shape for the engine nacelles in a ray tracing the space shuttle. We are researching the feasibility of obtaining good convergence results for the superellipsoid surface. It was our view that smaller and lighter wave numbers would reduce computational costs associated with obtaining Galerkin coefficients. In addition, we hoped to significantly reduce the number of terms in the infinite series needed to modify the original integral equation, all of which were achieved in the analysis of the superellipsoid in a finite range. We used the Green's theorem to solve the integral equation for the boundary of the surface. Previously, multiple surfaces were used to test this method, such as the sphere, ellipsoid, and perturbation of the sphere, pseudosphere and the <b>oval</b> <b>of</b> <b>Cassini</b> Lin and Warnapala, Warnapala and Morgan...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} steady, laminar, viscous, {{incompressible}} flow in tubes of non-circular cross sections is investigated. The specific {{aims of the}} investigation are (a) {{to look at the}} problems of both developing flow and fully developed flow, (b) to consider non-circular cross sections in a more systematic manner than has been done in the past, and (c) to develop a relatively simple finite element technique for producing accurate numerical solutions of flow in tubes of fairly arbitrary cross sections.;Fully developed flow in tubes is governed by a Poisson type equation for the mainstream velocity. Both analytical and numerical solutions are considered. The cross sections studied include elliptic and rectangular cross sections of different aspect ratios, some triangular cross sections, and a series of crescent-shaped cross sections. The physical characteristics of the flow are examined in a systematic manner in order to determine how these characteristics are affected by certain geometrical features of the cross section. Solutions fall into three basic categories depending on the shape of the cross section. In the first category, which includes circular and elliptic cross sections, solutions are possible in closed form. In the second, including rectangular and some triangular cross sections, solutions are in the form of infinite series. In the third, including cross sections of more complicated or irregular shapes, only numerical solutions are possible. Results of calculations of velocity profiles, flow rate, pumping power, and friction factor are presented in a way which can be useful for engineering applications.;In numerical studies of both developing and fully developed flow finite element techniques are used. Results are obtained for tubes of rectangular and elliptic cross sections of different aspect ratios, for tubes of crescent-shaped cross sections and a tube whose cross section is an <b>oval</b> <b>of</b> <b>Cassini.</b> For fully developed flow, results are compared with the corresponding exact solutions, where available. For rectangular and elliptic cross sections results are also compared with those obtained by using a commercial package (FIDAP).

The conditions under which the auroral bifurcations associated with this bursty reconnection were observed were examined for this and three other examples. The magnetosphere was strongly compressed with a high magnetosheath field strength in every case. We conclude that reconnection can proceed at different locations on the magnetopause, depending on the local magnetic shear and plasma β conditions, and bursty reconnection occurs when the magnetosphere is strongly compressed and can result in significant solar wind-driven flux transport in Saturn's outer magnetosphere...|$|R
