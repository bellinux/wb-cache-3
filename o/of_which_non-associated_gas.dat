Although a number of other onshore areas have been explored by seismic survey and by drilling, no further commercial oil has yet been discovered. However offshore there has been much further exploration around the current producing areas and more fields have been discovered. Since 1990 the Al-Khalij, Al-Rayyan and Al-Shaheen fields have been considered commercial and are being developed, even under the present global economic uncertainties due to low oil prices. Most probably more finds will be made, with some possibly straddling Qatar's territorial boundaries. These fields will have to be appraised, evaluated, and whenever they are considered commercial, efficient, fair production plans will have to be agreed between governments...|$|R

40|$|Most mature oil {{reservoirs}} or fields tend {{to perform}} below expectations, owing to {{high level of}} associated gas production. This creates a sub-optimal performance of the oil production surface facilities; increasing oil production specific operating cost. In many scenarios oil companies flare/vent this gas. In addition to oil production constraints, associated gas flaring and venting consists an environmental disasters and economic waste. Significant steps are now being devised to utilise associated gas using different exploitation techniques. Most of the technologies requires large associated gas throughput. However, small-scale associated <b>gas</b> resources and <b>non-associated</b> natural <b>gas</b> reserves (commonly referred to as stranded gas or marginal field) remains largely unexploited. Thus, {{the objective of this}} thesis is to evaluate techno- economic of gas turbine engines for onsite electric power generation called gas- to-wire (GTW) using the small-scaled associated gas resources. The range of stranded flared associated <b>gas</b> and <b>non-associated</b> <b>gas</b> reserves considered is around 10 billion to 1 trillion standard cubic feet undergoing production decline. The gas turbine engines considered for power plant in this study are based on simple cycle or combustion turbines. Simple cycle choice of power-plant is conceived to meet certain flexibility in power plant capacity factor and availability during production decline. In addition, it represents the basic power plant module cable of being developed into other power plant types in future to meet different local energy requirements. This study developed a novel gas-to-wire techno-economic and risk analysis framework, with capability for probabilistic uncertainty analysis using Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) method. It comprises an iterative calculation of the probabilistic recoverable reserves with decline module and power plant thermodynamic performance module enabled by Turbomatch (an in-house code) and Gas Turb® software coupled with economic risk modules with @Risk® commercial software. This algorithm is a useful tool for simulating the interaction between disrupted gas production profiles induced by production decline and its effect on power plant techno-economic performance over associated gas utilization economic life. Furthermore, a divestment and make- up fuel protocol is proposed for management of gas turbine engine units to mitigate economical underperformance of power plant regime experienced due to production decline. The results show that utilization of associated gas for onsite power generation is a promising technology for converting waste to energy. Though, associated gas composition can be significant to gas turbine performance but a typical Nigerian associated gas considered is as good as a regular natural gas. The majority of capital investment risk is associated with production decline both natural and manmade. Finally, the rate of capital investment returns decreases with smaller reserves...|$|R

40|$|The major Paleozoic {{petroleum}} {{system of}} Saudi Arabia is qualitatively {{characterized by a}} proven Silurian (Qusaiba Member, Qalibah Formation) source rock, Devonian (Jauf Formation), Permian and Carboniferous (Khuff and Unayzah Formations) reservoirs, a laterally extensive, regional Permian seal (basal Khuff clastics and Khuff evaporites), and four-way closure Hercynian structures. Hydrocarbons found in these systems include <b>non-associated</b> <b>gas</b> in Eastern Arabia and extra light oil in Central Arabia. A basin modeling approach was used to quantify {{important aspects of the}} petroleum system. First, 17 regional wells were selected to establish a reference tool for the three dimensional (3 -D) basin model using multiple one dimensional (1 -D) models. This was accomplished by studying core material from source rocks and other lithologies for thermal maturity and kerogen quality. The major emphasis was on the Silurian section, other Paleozoic intervals {{and to a lesser extent}} on the Mesozoic cover from which only few samples were studied. Although vitrinite macerals, solid bitumen, and other vitrinite-like particles were not abundant in most of the investigated samples, enough measured data established valid maturity-depth trends allowing for calibrated models of temperature history. Sensitivity analyses for maturity support the view that thermal boundary conditions and Hercynian uplift and erosion did not greatly influence the Paleozoic petroleum systems. Second, a 3 -D basin model was constructed using major geologic horizon maps spanning the whole stratigraphic column. This model was used to gain insight into the general maturity distribution, acquire a better control of the model boundary conditions and investigate charge, drainage, migration and filling history of the main Paleozoic reservoirs. The 3 -D hydrocarbon migration simulation results qualitatively account for the present gas accumulations in the Permian-Triassic Khuff and Carboniferous-Permian Unayzah reservoirs in the Ghawar area. This kind of study illustrates the importance of 3 -D basin modeling when used with other geologic data to describe petroleum systems. It provides a predictive exploratory tool for efficiently modeling hydrocarbon distribution based on seismic and well data and information on known oil and gas fields. Real earth models can only be described in 3 -D as pressure variations and fluid movements in the subsurface are impossible to address in 1 -D and 2 -D domains...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} of the study were: (1) to perform resource assessment of the thermogenic gas resources in deeply buried (> 15, 000 ft) natural gas reservoirs of the onshore interior salt basins of the north central and northeastern Gulf of Mexico areas through petroleum system identification, characterization and modeling; and (2) to use the petroleum system based resource assessment to estimate {{the volume of the}} deep thermogenic gas resource that is available for potential recovery and to identify those areas in the interior salt basins with high potential for this thermogenic gas resource. Petroleum source rock analysis and petroleum system characterization and modeling, including thermal maturation and hydrocarbon expulsion modeling, have shown that the Upper Jurassic Smackover Formation served as the regional petroleum source rock in the North Louisiana Salt Basin, Mississippi Interior Salt Basin, Manila Subbasin and Conecuh Subbasin. Thus, the estimates of the total hydrocarbons, oil, and gas generated and expelled are {{based on the assumption that}} the Smackover Formation is the main petroleum source rock in these basins and subbasins. The estimate of the total hydrocarbons generated for the North Louisiana Salt Basin in this study using a petroleum system approach compares favorably with the total volume of hydrocarbons generated published by Zimmermann (1999). In this study, the estimate is 2, 870 billion barrels of total hydrocarbons generated using the method of Schmoker (1994), and the estimate is 2, 640 billion barrels of total hydrocarbons generated using the Platte River software application. The estimate of Zimmermann (1999) is 2, 000 to 2, 500 billion barrels of total hydrocarbons generated. The estimate of gas generated for this basin is 6, 400 TCF using the Platte River software application, and 12, 800 TCF using the method of Schmoker (1994). Barnaby (2006) estimated that the total gas volume generated for this basin ranges from 4, 000 to 8, 000 TCF. Seventy-five percent of the gas is estimated to be from late cracking of oil in the source rock. Lewan (2002) concluded that much of the thermogenic gas produced in this basin is the result of cracking of oil to gas in deeply buried reservoirs. The efficiency of expulsion, migration and trapping has been estimated to range from 0. 5 to 10 percent for certain basins (Schmoker, 1994 : Zimmerman, 1999). The estimate of the total hydrocarbons generated for the Mississippi Interior Salt Basin is 910 billion barrels using the method of Schmoker (1994), and the estimate of the total hydrocarbons generated is 1, 540 billion barrels using the Platte River software application. The estimate of gas generated for this basin is 3, 130 TCF using the Platte River software application, and 4, 050 TCF using the method of Schmoker (1994). Seventy-five percent of the gas is estimated to be from late cracking of oil in the source rock. Claypool and Mancini (1989) report that the conversion of oil to gas in reservoirs is a significant source of thermogenic gas in this basin. The Manila and Conecuh Subbasins are oil-prone. Although these subbasins are thermally mature for oil generation and expulsion, they are not thermally mature for secondary, <b>non-associated</b> <b>gas</b> generation and expulsion. The gas produced from the highly productive gas condensate fields (Big Escambia Creek and Flomaton fields) in these subbasins has been interpreted to be, in part, a product of the cracking of oil to gas and thermochemical reduction of evaporite sulfate in the reservoirs (Claypool and Mancini, 1989). The areas in the North Louisiana and Mississippi Interior Salt Basins with high potential for deeply buried gas reservoirs (> 15, 000 ft) have been identified. In the North Louisiana Salt Basin, these potential reservoirs include Upper Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous facies, especially the Smackover, Cotton Valley, Hosston, and Sligo units. The estimate of the secondary, <b>non-associated</b> <b>gas</b> generated from cracking of oil in the source rock from depths below 12, 000 feet in this basin is 4, 800 TCF. Assuming an expulsion, migration and trapping efficiency of 1 to 5 %, 48 to 240 TCF of gas is potentially available. The final recoverable gas is some percent of this estimated thermogenic gas resource based on the recovery factor for the specific reservoir. To date, some 29 TCF of gas have been produced from this basin. Also, the thermogenic gas, whether generated from late secondary cracking of oil to gas in the source rock or from oil to gas conversion in deeply buried reservoirs, migrated updip into shallower reservoirs, including the Monroe gas rock at depths of some 2, 000 feet...|$|R

The model is capable of simulating the surface profile of reinforced granular fill over very soft soil due to the immediate settlement. A primary ground deformation profile is evaluated prior to filling and is based on a parametric study involving variables such as the height and the spacing of the embankment fingers, the stiffness modulus of the reinforcement and the cohesion of the soft soil. The numerical results indicated that these parameters affect the performance of the system in many direct ways. The immediate and final settlement is based on the level the first deformation has attained and is estimated using a nonlinear and incremental stress-strain analysis.
