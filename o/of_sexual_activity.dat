5|$|Kinsey and {{his staff}} {{reported}} that 28% of women had been aroused by another female, and 19% had a sexual contact with another female. Of women who had sexual contact with another female, half to two-thirds of them had orgasmed. Single women had the highest prevalence of homosexual activity, followed by women who were widowed, divorced, or separated. The lowest occurrence <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>activity</b> was among married women; those with previous homosexual experience reported they got married to stop homosexual activity.|$|E
5|$|Globally, condoms are {{the most}} common method of birth control. Male condoms are put on a man's erect penis and {{physically}} block ejaculated sperm from entering the body of a sexual partner. Modern condoms are most often made from latex, but some are made from other materials such as polyurethane, or lamb's intestine. Female condoms are also available, most often made of nitrile, latex or polyurethane. Male condoms have the advantage of being inexpensive, easy to use, and have few adverse effects. Making condoms available to teenagers does not appear to affect the age of onset <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>activity</b> or its frequency. In Japan about 80% of couples who are using birth control use condoms, while in Germany this number is about 25%, and in the United States it is 18%.|$|E

On 6 February 2016, Sunderland scored two late goals to draw 2-2 with Liverpool at Anfield, having trailed 2-0 with ten minutes remaining. Later that week winger Adam Johnson was sacked by the club after {{pleading guilty to}} one count <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>activity</b> with a child and one charge of grooming. Sunderland remained in the relegation zone {{for much of the}} remainder of the 2015–16 season, before they boosted their survival chances by beating Norwich City 3–0 at Carrow Road on 16 April, closing the gap on 17th-place Norwich to just one point. Allardyce successfully led Sunderland to safety from relegation after beating Everton 3–0 on 11 May, a result which also ensured the relegation of rivals (and one of his former clubs) Newcastle United. Allardyce earned praise for his management of Sunderland from some pundits, particularly for his organized approach and emphasis on a strong defence.|$|E

5|$|The {{presence}} <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>activity</b> {{between women}} {{as necessary to}} define a lesbian or a relationship continues to be debated. According to feminist writer Naomi McCormick, women's sexuality is constructed by men, whose primary indicator of lesbian sexual orientation is sexual experience with other women. The same indicator {{is not necessary to}} identify a woman as heterosexual, however. McCormick states that emotional, mental, and ideological connections between women are as important or more so than the genital. Nonetheless, in the 1980s, a significant movement rejected the desexualization of lesbianism by cultural feminists, causing a heated controversy called the feminist sex wars. Butch and femme roles returned, although not as strictly followed {{as they were in the}} 1950s. They became a mode of chosen sexual self-expression for some women in the 1990s. Once again, women felt safer claiming to be more sexually adventurous, and sexual flexibility became more accepted.|$|E
5|$|Eric and Leslie Ludy {{met when}} Eric was 21 and Leslie was 16. They pursued a {{friendship}} {{for several months}} before starting to court, and married in December 1994, the same month that Eric turned 24. In When God Writes Your Love Story, the Ludys advise single people not to be physically or emotionally intimate with others, but {{to wait for the}} life partner that God has planned for them; the Ludys suggest that one should marry this person rather than independently choosing a mate. Also focusing on premarital physical and emotional purity, the authors do not discuss the physical processes <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>activity.</b> Like many other Christian books about premarital romantic relationships, the Ludys' book explicitly does not present a set of rules to follow or a strategy for romantic success, but rather gives readers a framework for pursuing Christian romantic relationships; the book is intended to be a tool {{in the creation of the}} reader's unique romantic relationship rather than as a blueprint explaining what all Christian romantic relationships are supposed to look like.|$|E
25|$|Strong {{views are}} often {{expressed}} about anal sex. It is controversial in various cultures, {{especially with regard}} to religious prohibitions. This is commonly due to prohibitions against anal sex among males or teachings about the procreative purpose <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>activity.</b> It may be regarded as taboo or unnatural, and is a criminal offense in some countries, punishable by corporal or capital punishment. By contrast, people also regard anal sex as a natural and valid form <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>activity</b> that may be as fulfilling as other desired sexual expressions. They may regard it as an enhancing element of their sex lives or as their primary form <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>activity.</b>|$|E

25|$|As {{with most}} forms <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>activity,</b> anal sex {{participants}} risk contracting sexually transmitted infections (STIs/STDs). Anal sex {{is considered a}} high-risk sexual practice because of {{the vulnerability of the}} anus and rectum. The anal and rectal tissues are delicate and do not provide lubrication like the vagina does, so they can easily tear and permit disease transmission, especially if a personal lubricant is not used. Anal sex without protection of a condom is considered the riskiest form <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>activity,</b> and therefore health authorities such as the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend safe sex practices for anal sex.|$|E
