5|$|Egyptologists {{have noted}} that instead <b>of</b> <b>hiding</b> their non-royal origins, Neferhotep I, his {{predecessor}} Sobekhotep III, and his successor Sobekhotep IV, remarkably proclaimed them on their stelae and scarab seals. This {{is at odds with}} the traditional Egyptian system where the legitimacy of the new king rests mainly on his filiation. These proclamations of non-royal origins were possibly made to dissociate these kings from their immediate predecessors, in particular Seth Meribre whose monuments have been usurped and defaced. The reason for this remains unknown.|$|E

40|$|The article {{analyses}} {{theoretical and}} methodological problem <b>of</b> <b>hidden</b> curriculum at school. It compares individualistic and holistic approach in connection to research, measurement and analysis <b>of</b> <b>hidden</b> curriculum. The {{goal of the}} study is to present the inconsistency in understanding and explaining the concept <b>of</b> <b>hidden</b> curriculum. The inconsistency is grounded in the absence of paradigmatical background. The theories <b>of</b> <b>hidden</b> curriculum are devided into two groups. The first group is grounded in individualistic approach and the second group is grounded in holistic approach. The examples of empirical studies are used as tools to grasp hidden curriculum at school. The study concludes that the deϐinitions and understanding of the concept <b>of</b> <b>hidden</b> curriculum are logical conclusions of methodologicalapproach and empirical investigation <b>of</b> <b>hidden</b> curriculum in research. The methodological approach and empirical investigation reversely constitute the theory <b>of</b> <b>hidden</b> curriculum. The individualistic paradigm grasps hidden curriculum as a an implicit socialization of a child through the actions of individuals in the school. The holistic paradigm understands hidden curriculum as institutionalized nature of ideology or the tool for reproduction of society...|$|R

5|$|Robinson Crusoes of Warsaw {{were people}} who, {{after the end}} of the 1944 Warsaw Uprising and the {{subsequent}} planned destruction of Warsaw by Nazi Germany, decided to stay and hide in the ruins of the German-occupied city. The period <b>of</b> <b>hiding</b> spanned as long as three and a half months, from the day of the capitulation of the uprising, October 2, 1944, until the entry of the Red Army on January 17, 1945. Most of the Robinsons were Jews, although a considerable number of non-Jewish Poles were also present. The hideaways lived in the ruins of houses, basements, and bunkers which had been prepared ahead of time. They lived in extremely dire circumstances, while the city was being destroyed around them. Some managed to escape Warsaw, many were captured and killed by the Germans, while others survived until the withdrawal of German troops.|$|E

5|$|In May 1965, a {{military}} tribunal under Kỳ sentenced both Thảo and Phát, {{who were still}} on the run, to death in absentia. As a result, Thảo {{had little choice but to}} move around indefinitely or attempt to seize power in order to save himself. He chose the latter. On May 20, a few officers and around 40 civilians, predominantly Catholic, were arrested on charges of attempting to assassinate Quát and kidnap Kỳ among others. Several of the arrested were known supporters of Thảo and believed to be abetting him in evading the authorities. In July 1965, he was reported dead in unclear circumstances after being hunted down; an official report claimed he died of injuries while on a helicopter taking him to Saigon, after being captured north of the city. It was generally assumed he was murdered or tortured to death on the orders of some junta members. Phát remained on the run for three years. During that time, Kỳ's power was eclipsed by Thiệu in a continuing power struggle, and the latter removed Kỳ supporters in the military from positions of high power. In June 1968, Phát came out <b>of</b> <b>hiding</b> and surrendered himself to the authorities. He was pardoned by {{a military}} court in August and released.|$|E
5|$|Kirchner's health {{first became}} {{a topic of}} public concern in 2005 when Noticias {{magazine}} reported that she might suffer from bipolar disorder. Journalist Franco Lindner interviewed the psychiatrist who treated her without revealing his name. Journalist Nelson Castro investigated further and discovered that the psychiatrist was Alejandro Lagomarsino, who died in 2011. Lagomarsino was the leading specialist {{in the treatment of}} bipolar disorder in Argentina. Castro's investigation revealed that Kirchner was treated by Lagomarsino for a short period. He could not determine the length of her treatment or the medicine she received, or whether another psychiatrist continued treating her or not. Castro considers that some of her outlandish phrases or projects, and her frequent periods <b>of</b> <b>hiding</b> from public view, may be explained by the disorder's periods of mania and depression, as well as being a regular political strategy. Eduardo Duhalde said that Néstor Kirchner once confided in him that she had a bipolar disorder, while she was having a violent outburst. During the United States diplomatic cables leak it was revealed that Hillary Clinton questioned Kirchner's mental health and asked the US embassy whether she was receiving treatment or not; she later apologized to Kirchner for those leaks. Kirchner said in her book La Presidenta that it was all a misunderstanding; it is her sister who suffers from bipolar disorder.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the next}} fifteen years, Grannvale expands to hold {{dominion}} {{over the whole}} of Judgral, and Arvis turns Grannvale into an empire and styles himself emperor. He and Deirdre have twin children: Julius, the scion of Loptyr, and Julia, the scion of Naga. Manfroy uses the Loptyr tome to corrupt Julius and turn him into Loptyr's vessel, and Deirdre sacrifices herself to send Julia into hiding. Julius overthrows his father and turns the Empire into a tyrannical regime. At this point, Seliph comes out <b>of</b> <b>hiding</b> to protect a nearby village, revealing his long-hidden existence to Grannvale. Traveling across the lands of Jugdral, Seliph reunites with the long-hidden children of Sigurd's companions, including Julia. Making {{his way through the}} countries of Jugdral, he gains support from the surviving powers, and gradually frees Grannvale's conquered territories. Arvis is powerless to subvert his son's rule, and is killed in battle against Seliph. During the course of these battles, Julia is captured and Manfroy and Julius attempt to sacrifice her as her powers could banish Loptyr for good. Seliph manages to save her, and after defeating Manfroy and Julius in battle, Julia successfully banishes Loptyr, ending his rule for good and allowing Jugdral to recover from the recent conflicts. Seliph takes his rightful place on the throne as the emperor of Grannvale, and restores power to the surrounding countries with their respective heirs.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: {{studying}} curriculum as a pedagogical {{problem has}} traditionally been reduced {{to the analysis of}} its explicit content, set in official educational documents. However, a much less studied hidden content plays a significant role in education. So, what is the role <b>of</b> the <b>hidden</b> curriculum during professional language training? The purpose of the article is to determine the potential impact <b>of</b> <b>hidden</b> curriculum on students’ conceptual worldview. Comparing the worldview presented in textbooks with students’ one has allowed us to estimate the rate <b>of</b> influence <b>of</b> <b>hidden</b> curr iculum. Materials and Methods: the methodological basis of the work is the cultural concept of personalityoriented education. The methodology for studying the role <b>of</b> <b>hidden</b> curriculum includes four stages: at the first stage, the authors set the criteria for selecting textbooks for analysis and do the selection; at the second stage, the authors select sociocultural concepts for analysis; at the third stage, the scheme of analysis is designed and the analysis of textbooks is done; at the fourth stage, the authors identify the potential influence <b>of</b> <b>hidden</b> curriculum on students’ conceptual worldview. Results: the structure <b>of</b> <b>hidden</b> curriculum has been determined and the scheme for analysing its subject component has been developed. The authors have identified a significant influence <b>of</b> <b>hidden</b> curriculum on students’ worldview, which represents the scientific novelty of the article. Discussion and Conclusions: the article gives the definition <b>of</b> a <b>hidden</b> curriculum which is new for Russian pedagogy and presents a methodology for its analysis in EFL textbooks. That analysis is recommended to be conducted when selecting teaching materials both i n languages and other humanities...|$|R
