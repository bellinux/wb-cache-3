The vignettes have no traditional sense of narrative; they {{begin in the}} middle. Shifting points-of-view and narrative perspectives disguise autobiographical details.|$|E

500|$|The 1925 {{edition of}} In <b>Our</b> <b>Time</b> <b>is</b> {{considered}} one of Hemingway's masterpieces. Reviewers and critics noticed, and the collection received positive reviews on its publication. The New York Times described the language as [...] "fibrous and athletic, colloquial and fresh, hard and clean, his very prose seems to have an organic being of its own". A reviewer for Time wrote, [...] "Ernest Hemingway is somebody; a new honest un-'literary' transcriber of life – a Writer." [...] Reviewing if for The Bookman, F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote Hemingway was an [...] "augury" [...] of the age and that the Nick Adams stories were [...] "temperamentally new" [...] in American fiction.|$|E
500|$|In <b>Our</b> <b>Time</b> <b>is</b> Ernest Hemingway's first {{collection}} of short stories, published in 1925 by Boni & Liveright, New York. Its title {{is derived from the}} English Book of Common Prayer, [...] "Give peace in our time, O Lord". The collection's publication history was complex. It began with six prose vignettes commissioned by Ezra Pound for a 1923 edition of The Little Review; Hemingway added twelve more and in 1924 compiled the in our time edition (with a lower-case title), which was printed in Paris. To these were added fourteen short stories for the 1925 edition, including [...] "Indian Camp" [...] and [...] "Big Two-Hearted River", two of his best-known Nick Adams stories. He composed [...] "On the Quai at Smyrna" [...] for the 1930 edition.|$|E
500|$|A Child of <b>Our</b> <b>Time</b> <b>is</b> {{a secular}} oratorio by the British {{composer}} Michael Tippett (190598), who also wrote the libretto. Composed between 1939 and 1941, {{it was first}} performed at the Adelphi Theatre, London, on 19 March 1944. The work was inspired by [...] events that affected Tippett profoundly: the assassination in 1938 of a German diplomat by a young Jewish refugee, and the Nazi government's reaction {{in the form of}} a violent pogrom against its Jewish population—called Kristallnacht. Tippett's oratorio deals with these incidents in the context of the experiences of oppressed people generally, and carries a strongly pacifist message of ultimate understanding and reconciliation. The text's recurrent themes of shadow and light reflect the Jungian psychoanalysis which Tippett underwent in the years immediately before writing the work.|$|E

500|$|Radical Middle Newsletter proved controversial. [...] Many responded {{positively}} to Satin's new direction. [...] A professor of management, for example, wrote that unlike Satin's former newsletter, Radical Middle spoke about [...] "reality". [...] Scholarly books began citing the newsletter. [...] In {{a book on}} globalization, Walter Truett Anderson said Radical Middle [...] "carries the encouraging news of an emerging group with a different voice, one that is 'nuanced, hopeful, adult'.... It is essentially a willingness to listen to {{both sides of the}} argument." [...] But three objections were often heard. [...] Some critics accused Satin of misguided policy proposals, as when peace studies scholar Michael N. Nagler wrote that the article [...] "praising humanitarian military intervention as the 'peace movement' of <b>our</b> <b>time,</b> <b>is</b> nothing short of an insult... to the real peace movement" [...] [...] Other critics accused Satin of abandoning his old constituency, as when author and former New Options advisor David Korten chided him for consciously choosing pragmatism over idealism. [...] There were also accusations of elitism, as when the executive editor of Yes! [...] magazine said Satin favored globalization because it appealed to his interests and those of his [...] "law school buddies".|$|E

[...] Divination seems to have emerged from our knowing the inevitability of death. [...] The idea is clear—we know that <b>our</b> <b>time</b> <b>is</b> limited and that we want things in our lives to happen in accord with our wishes. Realizing that our wishes have little power, we have sought technologies for gaining knowledge of the future… gain power over our own [...]" ...|$|E
2500|$|Chamberlain was {{an early}} {{supporter}} of Hanns Hörbiger's Welteislehre, the theory that most bodies {{in our solar system}} are covered with ice. Due in part to Chamberlain's advocacy, this became official cosmological dogma during the Third Reich. Chamberlain's attitude towards the natural sciences was somewhat ambivalent and contradictory – he later wrote: [...] "one of the most fatal errors of <b>our</b> <b>time</b> <b>is</b> that which impels us to give too great weight to the so-called 'results' of science." [...] Still, his scientific credentials were often cited by admirers to give weight to his political philosophy. Chamberlain rejected Darwinism, evolution and social Darwinism and instead emphasized [...] "" [...] which he said derived from Goethe.|$|E
2500|$|The Daily Telegraph {{wrote of}} his 1984 Andrea Chénier at London's Royal Opera House: [...] "Switching {{effortlessly}} from the lyric poet Rodolfo in La Bohème {{a few weeks}} ago to the heroic poet Chenier, the Spanish tenor's vocal artistry held us spellbound throughout." [...] Of his 1985 performance in Andrea Chénier at La Scala (preserved on DVD), Carl Battaglia wrote in Opera News that Carreras dominated the opera [...] "with formidable concentration and a cleverly refined vocal accent that imparts to this spinto role an overlay of intensity lacking in his essentially lyric tenor." [...] However, Carl H. Hiller's review of the La Scala performance in Opera also noted that while in the quiet phrases of the score [...] "he could display all the tonal mellowness of which this perhaps most beautiful tenor voice of <b>our</b> <b>time</b> <b>is</b> capable", he had difficulty with the high loud notes, which sounded strained and uneasily produced.|$|E

2500|$|The {{foundation}} has long sought, in its constituent museums, to unite its artworks with distinguished architecture. [...] In 1943, Hilla von Rebay and Solomon R. Guggenheim commissioned Frank Lloyd Wright {{to build the}} foundation's first permanent museum. [...] Rebay wrote to Wright that [...] "each of these great masterpieces should be organized into space, and only you ... would test the possibilities to do so. … [...] I want a temple of spirit, a monument!" [...] The resultant achievement, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, in New York City, testifies not only to Wright's architectural genius, {{but also to the}} adventurous spirit that characterized its founders. [...] The critic Paul Goldberger later wrote that, before Wright's modernist building, [...] "there were only two common models for museum design: Beaux-arts Palace ... and the International Style Pavilion." [...] Goldberger thought the building a catalyst for change, making it [...] "socially and culturally acceptable for an architect to design a highly expressive, intensely personal museum. In this sense almost every museum of <b>our</b> <b>time</b> <b>is</b> a child of the Guggenheim." ...|$|E
