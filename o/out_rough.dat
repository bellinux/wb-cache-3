500|$|Famitsus reviewers each {{praised the}} gameplay, story, and the {{introduction}} of full-motion movies. One reviewer cited it as the series' new exemplar, while another pointed <b>out</b> <b>rough</b> edges in the graphical redesign and that the new 3D perspective made seeing some parts of the map difficult. 1UP.com's Shane Betternhausen was positive overall, saying [...] " [...] delivers a superbly paced and rewarding adventure". RPGamer's Chris Privitere said [...] "While Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance doesn't necessarily add anything new to the tactical genre, it does everything very well", recommending it to players while stressing the need for patience. Peer Schneider of IGN called the game [...] "yet another worthy installment in Intelligent Systems' venerable strategy RPG series". RPGFan reviewer Mark Tjan said that while not the best Fire Emblem game he had played, [...] "it's certainly a good game and worth picking up if you're searching for an SRPG worth your time and money". Nintendo World Report's Karl Castaneda was also highly positive, though commenting that its graphical quality were more suited to {{the early days of the}} GameCube's life and that it might have been a great success if released during that period. Eurogamer's Tom Bramwell, despite feeling that the game was flawed by inherent problems in the Fire Emblem formula, enjoyed the game and was willing to replay once he had finished. Greg Kasavin, writing for GameSpot, saying that [...] "by replacing the traditional random battles that typify most Japanese role-playing games with a fun and exciting turn-based combat system, and by going out of its way to deliver a memorable and genuinely emotional story, Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance accomplishes what all role-playing games attempt, but very few actually manage to do". The majority of praise went to the game's story and gameplay, while criticism was focused on the graphical quality.|$|E
2500|$|Lully's operas were {{described}} as [...] "tragedies in music" [...] (tragédies en musique). The point of departure was a verse libretto, in most cases by the verse dramatist Philippe Quinault. For the dance pieces, Lully would hammer <b>out</b> <b>rough</b> chords and a melody on the keyboard, and Quinault would invent words. For the recitative, Lully imitated the speech melodies and dramatic emphasis used by the best actors in the spoken theater. His attentiveness to transferring theatrical recitation to sung music shaped French opera and song for a century.|$|E

2500|$|On December 7, 1938, Haslin {{was traded}} by the New York Giants to the minor league San Diego Padres of the Double-A Pacific Coast League in {{exchange}} for Manny Salvo. The trade was originally intended to have two players go to the Padres, but San Diego's president Spider Baum agreed to take Haslin after he hear from baseball executives around the majors that he would [...] "be lucky to land [...] ". However, Haslin's tenure with the Padres started <b>out</b> <b>rough</b> after he failed to report to spring training until his demand of a higher salary was met. On March 18, Haslin joined the Padres, signing a contract worth US$600 a month, a third less than his original asking price of the US$900 a month. It was not the last of Haslin's issues that year, because after a game on May 10, he got into an argument with San Diego manager Cedric Durst over a matter Durst called [...] "unimportant" [...] and Haslin left the team's stadium. After the ordeal, Durst suspended Haslin and fined him US$100. During a game on June 25, against the Oakland Oaks, Haslin hit two home runs and drove in all the Padres runs leading them to a 5–to–2 victory. With the Padres that season, Haslin batted [...]345 with 185 hits, 29 doubles, five triples, and 11 home runs in 151 games played. In the field, he played all of his games at third base.|$|E

50|$|Marking blue, layout stain or Prussian blue is a dye used in {{metalworking}} {{to aid in}} marking <b>out</b> <b>rough</b> parts for further machining. It is sometimes called Dykem (after a popular brand). It is used to stain or paint a metal object with a very thin layer of dye that can be scratched off using a scriber or other sharp instrument to reveal a bright, yet very narrow line in the metal underneath. The advantages are that any existing scratches are covered with the dye and the new lines have a contrasting background.|$|E

50|$|The CX suspension’s {{ability to}} soak up large {{undulations}} and yet damp <b>out</b> <b>rough</b> surfaces was extraordinary, with a consistent ride quality, empty, or fully laden. The suspension was attached to sub frames that were fitted to the body through flexible mountings, to improve even more the ride quality and to reduce road noise. The British magazine Car described the sensation of driving a CX as hovering over road irregularities, much like a ship traversing above the ocean floor. This suspension was used under license by Rolls-Royce on the Silver Shadow. The Mercedes-Benz 450SEL 6.9 was not built under license, but copied the Hydropneumatic suspension principles after the less effective Mercedes-Benz 600 Air suspension installation.|$|E

50|$|Most {{traditional}} carpets {{begin with}} a layer of undyed sawdust spread in a wood frame to smooth <b>out</b> <b>rough</b> surfaces such as stone paved streets and then sprayed with a light coating of water. Sometimes other materials such as sand are used for the base. Then the designs are laid over top. On smooth streets and other surfaces, the design can be drawn in chalk and filled in with the coloring materials. There are two ways to create the design, with the use of molds or stencils and freehand, sprinkling and placing the colored material. Freehand takes longer and requires more skill with the use of molds allowing for very defined and complicated designs. After the carpet is finished, it received a very light spray of water to affix the sawdust in place and keep the colors from fading.|$|E
