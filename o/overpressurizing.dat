Fluctuations in the fluid’s velocity are generated by restrictions like a pump starting/stopping, a valve opening/closing, or a reduction in line size. Hydraulic surges can be generated {{within a matter of}} seconds anywhere that the fluid velocity changes and can travel through a pipeline at very high rate of speed, damaging equipment or causing piping failures from <b>overpressurizing.</b> Surge relief systems absorb and limit high-pressure surges, preventing the pressure surge from traveling through the hydraulic system. Methods for controlling hydraulic surges include utilizing a gas-loaded surge relief valve, spring-loaded pressure safety valves, pilot-operated valves, surge suppressors, and rupture disks.|$|E

The vertical fin separated from the airplane. Hydraulic components located in the aft body were also severed, leading to a rapid depletion of all four hydraulic systems. The loss of the vertical fin, coupled {{with the loss of}} all four hydraulic systems, left the airplane extremely difficult, if not impossible, to control in all three axes.

The BOG recondenser system targets the liquefied natural gas (LNG) bunkering operation, in which the BOG phase transition occurs in a pressure vessel instead of a heat exchanger. The BOG that is generated during LNG bunkering operation is characterized as an intermittent flow with various peak loads. The system was designed to temporarily store the transient BOG inflow, condense it with subcooled LNG and store the condensed liquid. The superiority of the system was verified by comparing it with the most extensively employed conventional re-liquefaction system in terms of consumption energy and via an exergy analysis. Static simulations were conducted for three compositions; the results indicated that the proposed system provided 0 to 6. 9 % higher efficiencies. The exergy analysis indicates that the useful work of the conventional system is 24. 9 %, and the useful work of the proposed system is 26. 0 %. Process dynamic simulations of six cases were also performed to verify the behaviour of the BOG recondenser system. The results show that the pressure of the holdup in the recondenser vessel increased during the BOG inflow mode and decreased during the initialization mode. The maximum pressure of one of the bunkering cases was 3. 45 bar. The system encountered a challenge during repetitive operations due to <b>overpressurizing</b> of the BOG recondenser vessel...|$|E

In situ sap flow gauges, and mass flow measurements, showed that removing the lamina approximately doubted sap flow rate through the petiole stub that remained attached to the plant. This was a consequence of flow out of the roots being diverted along this low-resistance pathway and away from leaves higher in the canopy. Leaf and whole shoot excision temporarily released extra solutes in to sap as it discharged from the cut petiole or from the hypo-cotyl stump. This contamination prevented the use of sap extracted from detached lamina by <b>overpressurizing</b> in a Scholan-der bomb. To minimise distortions to sap flow and wound-induced contamination, estimates of in planta concentration and delivery (concentration × sap flow rate) of ABA and osmolality in xylem sap were made using sap flow rates measured before excision and concentrations in flowing sap collected approximately 30 mm after excision. At this time, effects of excision on solute contamination had subsided. The approach revealed that withholding water from upper roots increased ABA delivery from roots into the shoot base 3 -fold. However, approximately half this ABA was lost {{en route to the}} youngest fully open leaf.

A synthetic sonic log profile obtained from multichannel seismic data from Site 583 showed that the apparently stratified layer has a lower seismic velocity than the overlying accreted sediments. This inver-sion strongly suggests that the pelagic layer is <b>overpressurized</b> because interstitial water cannot be released through the sedimentary overburden. When the accretion of trench-wedge turbidites proceeds, major thrust faults extending to the decollement are generated and the <b>overpressurized</b> pore water is able to escape to the seafloor through the faults.

Another reason for this low-V and relatively high-Vp/Vs area could be the presence of <b>overpressurized</b> fluid (Sherburn et al. 2006; Chiarabba et al. 2009). For a misoriented compressional inversion fault, reduction of fault strength by <b>overpressurized</b> fluid along the fault is a possible cause for reactivation (Sibson 1990; Sibson 2009). The fault plane of the 2008 Iwate-Miyagi Nairiku earthquake {{is thought to be}} as compressional inversion fault (Sibson 2009). Compressional inversion fault is the reverse fault along the pre-existing ‘normal’ fault. The previous study (Okada et al. 2012) showed the complex distribution of the aftershock alignment of the 2008 Iwate-Miyagi Nairiku Earthquake. The complex distribution of the aftershock alignment (i.e., fault) has been spatially correlated with the distribution of the LVZ. Seismic low-velocity zones along and around complex fault planes were observed after the 2004 Niigata-Chuetsu earthquake (Okada et al. 2006).

Two generations of ground ice are distinguished within a single stratigraphic sequence. Pre-deformation ice has been glacially deformed or eroded beneath the cold-based margin of the Laurentide Ice Sheet (LIS) during Marine Isotope Stage 2. Such ice comprises (1) buried basal ice, (2) massive segregated ice and (3) ice clasts subglacially eroded from pre-existing ground ice. In contrast, post-deformation ice has not been glacially disturbed because it formed during or after deglaciation; it includes (4) dykes and sills of intrusive ice, (5) massive segregated-intrusive ice, (6) ice wedges and composite wedges, (7) segregated ice and (8) pool ice. The superimposition of post-deformation intrusive ice and massive segregated-intrusive ice into permafrost containing pre-deformation ground ice indicates that substantial quantities of <b>overpressurized</b> water were injected into ice-marginal permafrost during or after deglaciation.
