40|$|Background]Whole-body cancer {{screening}} with multimodalities including [18 F]-fluorodeoxyglucose {{positron emission tomography}} (FDG-PET) detects {{a wide range of}} tumors. This program has been recognized as an option for opportunistic screening, particularly in Japan. However, reports on diagnostic accuracy have been limited. We aimed to evaluate the detectability and related properties of this screening program among asymptomatic individuals in a community setting. [Methods]The study participants were 1, 762 residents of Osaka Prefecture, Japan, who underwent <b>opportunistic</b> <b>cancer</b> screening at Higashitemma Clinic for the first time between November 2004 and December 2005. FDG-PET {{cancer screening}} was performed with several imaging modalities (e. g., FDG-PET, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasonography) and fecal occult blood test. Screening records were linked to the Osaka cancer registry within 1 year after the screening to determine sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive values. [Results]After excluding 12 participants with cancer detected before the screening, 33 were identified by the cancer registry to have primary cancers. Of these, the present screening program found that 28 were positive (6 prostate, 5 lung, 5 colorectal, 5 thyroid, 3 liver and 4 others). Sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive values were 84. 8 % (28 / 33, 95 % confidence interval 69. 1 – 93. 3), 86. 8 % (1, 491 / 1, 718, 85. 1 – 88. 3) and 10. 1 % (28 / 277, 6. 4 – 12. 9), respectively. [Conclusions]FDG-PET cancer screening with multimodalities reasonably and accurately detects existing asymptomatic cancer. However, the numbers of false negatives and false positives were not insignificant. Facilities that provide the screening should inform participants of relevant information, including the limitations of this program...|$|E
30|$|As {{described}} in the introduction, embryogenesis {{is a process that}} involves growth and differentiation and is regulated primarily by epigenetic events. <b>Opportunistic</b> <b>cancer</b> cells and cancer progenitor cells hijack this process to their advantage to go through EMT and possibly the opposite process of MET for successful metastasis. The previous paradigm proposed by many researchers that metastatic processes involve the accumulation of mutations and genetic changes does not explain the reversible phenomena of EMT and MET, as mutations and genetic changes are irreversible. For this reason, Sarkar et al. previously proposed that the initiation of carcinogenesis and EMT/MET processes should be regulated by epigenetic mechanisms which are, by default, reversible [2, 17, 18, 23, 117, 118]. While mutations and other genetic alterations can speed up cancer cell growth at a certain degrees of metastasis, the amount of EMT defining a particular degree of differentiation should be controlled by epigenetic changes [17]. These epigenetic changes involve histone modifications, DNA methylation, and changes in the expression of miRNA. Tam and Weinberg also recently proposed that epigenetic changes are involved in the stepwise progression of EMT [119], but they do not describe the changes necessary at different times to produce metastatic cancers of different grades. As explained by Sarkar et al., these epigenetic changes are grade-specific and variable because they occur at different times, when growth slows down and differentiation speeds up. Once the differentiation for the more metastatic form is achieved, growth speeds up and new mutations incurred at that time may help in this process of rapid growth. The reverse process takes place during MET. Thus, epigenetic changes that promote and enable both EMT and MET are dynamic and variable, not static. Overall, the involvement of epigenetic changes in cancer is well studied, and the involvement of epigenetic changes in cancer initiation are discussed elsewhere [17, 18, 23, 117, 118]. Therefore, in this review we instead attempt to connect the significance of epigenetic changes related to EMT and MET.|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the utilization of breast, colon and prostate cancer screening in the adult Croatian population in a period without national cancer screening programs, with a special interest in respondents' rural versus urban origin. [...] - METHODS: Self-reported screening utilization was investigated in the Croatian Adult Health Survey, which collected health-related information from a representative sample of the adult Croatian population. Breast cancer screening was investigated in women aged over 40 years, while colon and prostate screening was investigated in respondents aged over 50 years. The data were analysed using binary logistic regression. [...] - RESULTS: One in five women reported breast cancer screening uptake in the year preceding the survey (22. 5 %), while only 4. 5 % reported a colon screening. A total of 6. 1 % men reported colon screening, while 13. 7 % of men reported having a prostate cancer screening. Respondents with rural origin reported all sites screening utilization less frequently than those of urban origin (breast: 14. 5 % vs 27. 4 %; prostate: 9. 6 % vs 16. 3 %; colon-men: 5. 7 % vs 6. 3 %; colon-women: 3. 6 % vs 5. 1 %; respectively). Multivariable models indicated that people with higher socio-economic status more commonly reported breast and prostate cancer screening uptake. Access to health care was the only independent variable associated with colon cancer screening in men, and the strongest variable associated with colon cancer screening in women. Rural origin was associated only with lower odds of breast screening (adjusted odds ratio 0. 60 [95 % confidence interval 0. 48 - 0. 74]), while in the remaining models, rural origin was not a significant predictor for cancer screening uptake. [...] - CONCLUSIONS: <b>Opportunistic</b> <b>cancer</b> screening uptake is low in the Croatian adult population, with existing socio-economic differences in breast and prostate screening, and their absence in colon cancer screening. Rural origin was significantly associated with breast screening, even after adjustment to socioeconomic status and problems in access to health care. Lack of rural origin significance in the other screening sites could be related to small sample sizes of people who reported opportunistic utilization. Overall, access to health care is the strongest cancer screening predictor, and this should have a prominent role in the development of a systematic cancer screening program on a national level...|$|E

The term was first used in the pre-HIV era, by Kazal et al. in 1976. The term was not specific to any particular disease or infection, and was used clinically to describe proctitis {{and a variety of other}} complaints caused by a wide range of infectious organisms. Reported causes include herpes viruses, syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, campylobacter, and shigellosis, as well as a variety of protozoal infections. The concept of [...] "gay bowel syndrome" [...] was later expanded to include various <b>opportunistic</b> <b>cancers.</b> Transmission of disease was considered to take place by two routes: anal sex, and fecal-oral route. Sometimes, difficulty in specifying the method may be a result of transmission by both methods. Following the onset of the AIDS epidemic, the reported incidence of these complaints has declined, likely as a result of safer sexual practices.

50|$|There is a {{consensus}} among experts that, once initiated, antiretroviral therapy should never be stopped. This is because the selection pressure of incomplete suppression of viral replication {{in the presence of}} drug therapy causes the more drug sensitive strains to be selectively inhibited. This allows the drug resistant strains to become dominant. This in turn makes it harder to treat the infected individual as well as anyone else they infect. One trial where ART therapy was periodically stopped had higher rates of <b>opportunistic</b> infections, <b>cancers,</b> heart attacks and death in patients who interrupted their ART.|$|R

The latency stage involves few or no symptoms and can last anywhere from two weeks to twenty years or more, depending on the individual. AIDS, {{the final stage of}} HIV infection, is defined by low CD4+ T cell counts (fewer than 200 per microliter), various <b>opportunistic</b> infections, <b>cancers</b> and other conditions.|$|R
40|$|Background: Despite {{years of}} public education, sun-related {{behaviours}} {{are difficult to}} change and a recent survey showed low levels of sun protection. In this study we evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of an <b>opportunistic</b> skin <b>cancer</b> prevention intervention in general practice. Methods: We used a controlled pre-and-post intervention design. Participants (n = 100) were recruited sequentially from patients attending two general practices in Sydney, Australia, from November to December 2010. Participants in the intervention practice (n = 50) received general practitioner delivered sun protection advice after completing a skin cancer risk assessment tool, and a sun protection pamphlet, in addition to routine care, at a single attendance. The skin cancer risk assessment tool provided three levels of risk. The general practitioner (GP) reinforced the level of risk and discussed sun protection. Participants in the control practice (n = 50) received routine care. We measured feasibility by patients’ and GPs’ participation in the intervention and time taken, and acceptability by intervention participants and GPs ratings of the intervention. We measured reported sun-related knowledge, attitudes and behaviour {{between the two groups}} at 1 and 13 months. Results: The intervention was found to be feasible within existing primary care team arrangements. Participation at baseline was 81 % (108 / 134), and repeated participation was 88 % (88 / 100) at 1 month and 70 % (70 / 100) at 13 months. Participants and practitioners found the intervention acceptable. At 1 month, sun-related knowledge had increased in both patient groups, with a greater increase in the intervention group (adjusted mean difference 0. 48, p = 0. 034). There were no differences between groups in sun-related knowledge, attitudes and behaviour at 13 months. Conclusions: A brief <b>opportunistic</b> skin <b>cancer</b> prevention intervention in general practice is feasible and acceptable.

40|$|Background: Before {{the era of}} {{combination}} therapy (c-ART) more than 90 % of the patients with HIV-infection died {{of one or more}} opportunistic infections (OI). We and others noted early on that CMV was an important pathogen in these patients. We investigated the OIs related to causes of death in all Venhälsan patients, with these specific questions 1) All OIs and <b>opportunistic</b> <b>cancers</b> (OC) s in patients who died with CD 4 + counts below 100 x 106 /mL; 2) The prevalence of CMV encephalitis (CMV-E) and Korsakoff syndrome (Paper 1); 3) CMV retinitis (CMV-R) in relation to CMV-E (Paper II); 4) CMV adrenalitis (CMV-A) and its relation to CMV-R and CMV-E, including comparison of CMV assessment by PCR in blood and the Synacthen test; 5) The correlation between CMV disease and other OIs and OCs (Papers I, II and III); 6) The interaction between CMV, Epstein Barr virus (EBV) and other human herpes viruses in a case of anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) (Paper IV) Material end methods: We followed all patients that died at Venhälsan from 1989 - 1996, with intensive blood testing, biopsies, culturing, X-ray, computer tomography CT, magnetic resonance imaging MRI as well as autopsy when permission was provided. We focused especially on Synacthen tests to diagnose CMV-A, neurological examinations to diagnose CMV-E and Korsakoff, and ophthalmologic examinations to diagnose CMV-R. In a case of anaplastic large cell lymphoma, we did extensive analysis of all human herpes viruses {{in the course of the}} disease. Results: Of all 219 patients, that died with CD 4 + < 100 x 106 /mL 87 % showed signs of reactivated CMV-infection. CMV-R was found in 84, CMV-E in 65, CMV-A in 41 and CMV in the gastrointestinal tract in 21. Mycobacterial infection was found in 87 and toxoplasmosis in 29. Kaposi’s sarcoma was the most common tumour (68 cases) followed by 22 patients with malignant lymphoma and 20 with CNS-lymphoma. CMV-reactivation was seen in most diagnostic. A case of primary CMV-infection leading to a malignant lymphoma by interaction with two other herpes viruses was also seen. Conclusion: CMV-infection was the main OI in AIDS-patients during the pre-c-ART era and also the main cause of death by itself or together with other OIs. Reactivation of CMV was found in 87 %. The most important CMV manifestations were CMV-R, CMV-E and CMV-A that seemed to occur at the same time. All of them have characteristic symptoms. Thus, when one of these is diagnosed investigation for the other two should be done. This is still today important in patients with CD 4 + < 100 x 106 /mL without access to modern HIV-treatment. These findings reveal the intimate interaction between HIV and CMV which should be considered in all co-infected patients also today...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: {{to assess}} {{compliance}} with the recommendations for <b>opportunistic</b> breast <b>cancer</b> screening by mammography. METHODS: 460 women {{from the town of}} Taubaté, São Paulo, Brazil, were followed-up prospectively after the index mammography, 327 of them attended by the public health system and 133 by the private system. We evaluated the prevalence of mammography repetition, the adherence rates and predictive factors associated with the current recommendations of mammographic screening. The association of the outcomes with the independent variables was studied by obtaining the risk rates (RR) and the respective 95 % confidence intervals (95 %CI). The adjusted prevalence rates were calculated by the COX regression model. RESULTS: although more than 90 % of the studied women repeated the mammography at least once, the rate of correct {{compliance with the}} recommendations of mammographic screening, with repetition of the procedure every 24 months, was low (about 30 % of the study sample). The preditive factors associated with compliance with mammographic screening were related to the unequal access to public or private healthcare services (RR= 1. 77; 95 %CI= 1. 26 - 2. 48) and to previous screening (RR= 3. 07; 95 %CI= 1. 86 - 5. 08).

40|$|A major {{underlying}} cause for {{aging of the}} immune system is the structural and functional atrophy of the thymus, and associated decline in T cell genesis. This loss of naïve T cells reduces adaptive immunity to new stimuli and precipitates a peripheral bias to memory cells against prior antigens. Whilst multiple mechanisms may contribute to this process, the temporal alliance of thymic decline with puberty has implicated a causative role for sex steroids. Accordingly ablation of sex steroids induces profound thymic rejuvenation. Although the thymus retains some, albeit highly limited, function in healthy adults, this is insufficient for resurrecting the T cell pool following cytoablative treatments such as chemo- and radiation-therapy and AIDS. Increased risk of <b>opportunistic</b> infections and <b>cancer</b> relapse or appearance, are a direct consequence. Temporary sex steroid ablation may thus provide a clinically effective means to regenerate the thymus and immune system in immunodeficiency states...|$|R

In June 2006 a revised recommendations for cervical cancer screening was introduced to increase coverage and to promote a three-year interval between screening tests. Aim: This study examines cervical cancer screening coverage and prevalence of cytology abnormalities in Catalonia by immigration status. Methods: The study analyses the cytologies registered among women aged 25 - 65 that have been attended at the Primary Health Centers (PHC) for any reason (n= 1, 242, 105) during 2008 - 11. Coverage was estimated from Governmental data base Information System Primary Care (SISAP) that includes 77 % of PHC. The database is anonymous, and includes information on age, country of birth, diagnostic center and cytology results Results: During the period 2008 - 2011, 758, 690 smears were performed {{in a total of}} 595, 868 women over 14 years, of whom 18. 3 % were immigrants. Cytology coverage was higher among immigrant women compared to Spanish born (51. 2 % and 39 % respectively). Immigrant women also had a higher prevalence of abnormal Paps compared to the Spanish population, 4. 9 % and 3. 3 % respectively.

40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{this study}} was to analyse breast cancer {{incidence}} and mortality in Tyrol from 1970 to 2006, namely after performing more than a decade of opportunistic mammography screening and just before piloting an organised screening programme. Our investigation was conducted on a population level. Methods To study time trends in breast cancer incidence and mortality, we applied the age-period-cohort model by Poisson regression to the official mortality data covering more than three decades from 1970 to 2006 and to the incidence data ranging from 1988 to 2006. In addition, for incidence data we analysed data on breast cancer staging and compared these with EU guidelines. Results For the analysis of time trend in breast cancer mortality in age groups 40 - 79, an age-period-cohort model fits well and shows for years 2002 - 2006 a statistically significant reduction of 26 % (95 % CI 13 %- 36 %) in breast cancer mortality as compared to 1992 - 1996. We see only slight non-significant increases in breast cancer incidence. For the past five years, incidence data show a 10 % proportion of in situ cases, and of 50 % for cases in stages II+. Conclusions The <b>opportunistic</b> breast <b>cancer</b> screening programme in Tyrol has only in part exploited the mortality reduction known for organised screening programmes. There seems to be potential for further improvement, and we recommend that an organised screening programme and a detailed screening database be introduced to collect all information needed to analyse the quality indicators suggested by the EU guidelines. </p...|$|R

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate {{the performance of the}} INNO-LiPA HPV Genotyping Extra assay (SPF 10 -LiPA) for the detection of carcinogenic HPV types in women referred for <b>opportunistic</b> cervical <b>cancer</b> screening by comparison with the Hybrid Capture 2 (HC 2) assay. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis from baseline data of HC 2 and SPF 10 -LiPA testing in cervical specimens collected from 1580 consecutive women and correlation with cervical cytology and histology data, when available. RESULTS: The two assays showed a good agreement for detection of carcinogenic HPV types and reported the same prevalence of carcinogenic HPV infections in different age groups. Stratification of study subjects by cervical cytology interpretation and histology results demonstrated that the two tests gave very similar results in the different cytology interpretation groups and in CIN 2 and CIN 3 samples, while in <CIN 2 samples the SPF 10 -LiPA assay provided a significantly lower number of carcinogenic HPV-positive results than the HC 2 test. A comparative analysis of the two assay for individual HPV types showed that HC 2 identified as positive between 73 % and 100 % of specimens with carcinogenic HPV types detected by SPF 10 -LiPA and, in particular, approximately 90 % and 80 % of HPV 16 - and HPV 18 -positive samples, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A good agreement was observed between HC 2 and SPF 10 -LiPA for carcinogenic HPV type detection, that supports further evaluation of the clinical performance of the new version of SPF 10 -LiPA in cervical cancer screening protocols...|$|R

The majority of the populations are ethnically Chinese with a total population of 6. 98, 4. 5 and 23 million, respectively. Cervical cancer has been declining over {{the last thirty years}} in all three states and is largely attributable to widespread <b>opportunistic</b> cervical <b>cancer</b> screening. The age-standardized incidence rates of cervical cancer are 9. 6 per 100, 000 women in Hong Kong in 2004, 10. 6 per 100, 000 women in Singapore in 2002 and 18. 6 per 100, 000 women in Taiwan in 2003. High prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) was observed in all three states. In cervical cancer, HPV 16 and 18 are the two most prevalent HPV types, but HPV 58 and 52 are also highly prevalent in these three states. Important epidemiological risk factors for invasive cervical cancer include smoking and age at sexual debut for women, although this is changing towards an earlier age. Of the three states, Taiwan was the first to have a comprehensive national screening programme in 1995 followed by Hong Kong in 2002 and Singapore in 2004. Women in these three states are well aware of cervical cancer and the preventative means by Pap smear screening, although their awareness and understanding of the role of HPV in cervical carcinogenesis is low. Prophylactic HPV vaccines have been licensed in the three states. Routine comprehensive public vaccination programme for adolescent girls has yet to be adopted by the governmental agency, despite an affirmative recommendation by medical professional bodies. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we used of 100 people. 50 of them were suffered from HIV and 50 of them were healthy. So we aimed to compare their some properties related to their personality such as extraversion, neuroticism, anger and self-esteem. At the end, data were analysed by SPSS software. The main findings of the research indicated that on the traits of Extraversion and Neuroticism, HIV positive individuals scored higher than HIV free subjects. Also, the HIV positive subjects showed low Self Esteem and high anger...|$|R
40|$|Mycoplasmas cause {{numerous}} human {{diseases and}} are common <b>opportunistic</b> pathogens in <b>cancer</b> patients and immunocompromised individuals. Mycoplasma infection elicits various host immune responses. Here we demonstrate that mycoplasma-infected tumor cells release exosomes (myco+ exosomes) that specifically activate splenic B cells and induce splenocytes cytokine production. Induction of cytokines, including the proinflammatory IFN-c and the anti-inflammatory IL- 10, was largely {{dependent on the}} presence of B cells. B cells were the major IL- 10 producers. In splenocytes from B cell deficient mMT mice, induction of IFN-c+ T cells by myco+ exosomes was greatly increased compared with wild type splenocytes. In addition, anti-CD 3 -stimulated T cell proliferation was greatly inhibited in the presence of myco+ exosome-treated B cells. Also, anti-CD 3 -stimulated T cell signaling was impaired by myco+ exosome treatment. Proteomic analysis identified mycoplasma proteins in exosomes that potentially contribute to the effects. Our results demonstrate that mycoplasma-infected tumor cells release exosomes carrying mycoplasma components that preferentially activate B cells, which in turn, are able to inhibit T cell activity. These results suggest that mycoplasmas infecting tumor cells can exploit the exosome pathway to disseminate their own components and modulate the activity of immune cells, in particular, activate...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundPrompt {{utilization}} {{of health services}} on detecting breast symptoms can improve breast cancer (BC) survival. Little is known about Chinese women's help-seeking behaviour. Our aim was to determine patterns of self-referral among Hong Kong Chinese women with self-detected breast symptoms. MethodsWe recruited 37 women awaiting their first consultation at public hospitals for breast symptoms. Interviews were transcribed and analysed based on the grounded theory approaches. ResultsA two-stage help-seeking model provided the best interpretation of the data. Symptom recognition was triggered by symptom interpretation, symptom progression and social messages. Painful lumps were seen as symptomatic, but atypical symptoms were often dismissed as benign as they responded to dietary change. Symptom intensification and discussions with someone who had faced BC prompted consultation. Service utilization involved fear of consequences, confirmation need, symptom distress, lay referral, media prompts and <b>opportunistic</b> presentation. Fearing <b>cancer</b> as incurable delayed consultation. Utilization barriers included cost, uncertainty about referral pathways, competing priorities and embarrassment. ConclusionsAtypical and painless presentation was more common among women delaying presentation. Barriers included cost, access, time and embarrassment. Education should emphasize atypical symptoms, the high-cure rate {{and the need for}} early presentation. Reduced cost and improved access to clinics would enhance early consultation. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|The human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) kills more people worldwide than any other infectious disease. Approximately 42 million people, mostly in Africa and Asia, are currently infected with HIV (Figure 3. 1), and 5 million new infections occur every year (AIDS Epidemic Update, 2002). It is estimated that 22 milIion people have died since the first clinical evidence of AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) emerged in 1981 ('Mobilization for Microbicides' ~ The Rockfeller Foundation). HIV is generally transmitted {{in one of three}} ways: through unprotected sexual intercourse, blood-to-blood contact, and mother-to-child transmission. Once the virus has entered the body, it invades the cells of the immune system and initiates the production of new virus particles with concomitant destruction of the immune cells. As the number of immune cells in the body slowly declines, weight loss, debilitation, and eventually death occur due to <b>opportunistic</b> infections or <b>cancers.</b> Although AIDS is presently incurable, highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), where a cocktail of potent antiretroviral drugs are administered daily to HIV-positive patients to control the viral load, has resulted in dramatic reductions in HIV-related morbidity and mortality in the developed worl...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND Human {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) DNA testing can {{be crucial}} {{for women who}} have limited access to traditional screening. The current study compared the results obtained through HPV DNA testing with those obtained through cytology-based screening. METHODS A total of 3068 women aged 18 to 85 years were enrolled in an <b>opportunistic</b> cervical <b>cancer</b> screening program developed by the Barretos Cancer Hospital and performed {{by a team of}} health professionals working within a mobile unit from March to December 2012, followed by statistical analyses. For each patient, 2 different cervical samples were collected and preserved in a careHPV assay and SurePath medium, respectively. RESULTS High-risk HPV (hr-HPV) DNA was detected in 10. 0 % of women, with the majority (86. 7 %) demonstrating no abnormal Papanicolaou test results. The following cytological samples were found to be hr-HPV positive: 8. 2 % of the normal samples; 39. 4 % of the samples with atypical squamous/glandular cells of undetermined significance; 38. 5 % of the samples with atypical squamous/glandular cells of undetermined significance, cannot exclude high-grade lesion; 55. 3 % of the samples with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions; and 100 % of the samples with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions. Colposcopy examinations were performed among 33. 4 % of the women with positive results on at least 1 of the tests (HPV DNA positive and/or cytology with atypical squamous/glandular cells of undetermined significance, cannot exclude high-grade lesion or high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions), and 59. 5 % of these women underwent biopsies. Among these samples, 18. 2 % were confirmed as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. CONCLUSIONS The careHPV test was demonstrated to be a feasible alternative to primary screening in low-resource settings accessed through the use of mobile units. Adriana T.

40|$|Cervical {{cancer is}} the second most common cancer among Brazilian women. High-risk human {{papillomavirus}} (hr-HPV) persistence is the primary cause of cervical neoplasia. Early detection of hr-HPV is important for identifying women at risk for developing cervical lesions. Approximately 85 % of new cases of cervical cancer worldwide and 50 % of the total cervical cancer deaths occurred in developing countries. Here, a new methodology to support a cervical cancer screening program was evaluated in women from various Brazilian regions. METHODS: Two thousand women aged 18 - 77 years were enrolled in an <b>opportunistic</b> cervical <b>cancer</b> screening program and were randomized into self-vaginal or health professional-guided cervical sampling groups. The Qiagen careHPV™ test was performed on all samples. Pap tests were performed on all women using liquid-based cytology. RESULTS: Positive hr-HPV results were obtained in 12. 3 % (245 / 2000) of women; similar rates were observed in self- or health professional-collected samples. Eighty-nine percent (1719 / 2000) of cervical cytologies classified as normal were negative to hr-HPV. Among the cytological samples, 36. 6 % classified as ASC-US+ were positive to hr-HPV, 78. 8 % were LSIL and 75. 0 % were HSIL. CONCLUSIONS: Self-sampled and health professional-sampled vaginal/cervical specimens did not differ in their rates of detection of hr-HPV. Therefore, HPV DNA testing in self-sampled vaginal cells is an alternative to primary screening in low-resource settings.

40|$|Immunosuppressive drugs {{successfully}} prevent {{rejection of}} islet allografts {{in the treatment}} of type I diabetes. However, the drugs also suppress systemic immunity increasing the risk of <b>opportunistic</b> infection and <b>cancer</b> development in allograft recipients. In this study, we investigated a new treatment for autoimmune diabetes using naturally immune privileged, hair follicle derived, autologous cells to provide localized immune protection of islet allotransplants. Islets from Balb/c mouse donors were cotransplanted with syngeneic hair follicle dermal sheath cup cells (DSCC, group 1) or fibroblasts (FB, group 2) under the kidney capsule of immune-competent, streptozotocin induced, diabetic C 57 BL/ 6 recipients. Group 1 allografts survived significantly longer than group 2 (32. 2 ± 12. 2 versus 14. 1 ± 3. 3 days, P< 0. 001) without administration of any systemic immunosuppressive agents. DSCC reduced T cell activation in the renal lymph node, prevented graft infiltrates, modulated inflammatory chemokine and cytokine profiles, and preserved better beta cell function in the islet allografts, but no systemic immunosuppression was observed. In summary, DSCC prolong islet allograft survival without systemic immunosuppression by local modulation of alloimmune responses, enhancing of beta cell survival, and promoting of graft revascularization. This novel finding demonstrates the capacity of easily accessible hair follicle cells to be used as local immunosuppression agents in islet transplantation...|$|R
