5|$|Various incarnations of a Doctor Strange film {{had been}} in {{development}} since the mid-1980s, until Paramount Pictures acquired the film rights in April 2005, on behalf of Marvel Studios. Thomas Dean Donnelly and Joshua Oppenheimer were brought on board in June 2010 to write a screenplay. In June 2014, Derrickson and Spaihts were hired to direct and re-write the film, respectively.

5000|$|In June 1843, Schumann's <b>other</b> <b>commitments</b> {{made him}} <b>give</b> up editorship of the magazine, and in 1844 Franz Brendel became owner and editor. Under his tenure, {{the most notable}} piece was Richard Wagner's anti-Jewish article [...] "Das Judenthum in der Musik", {{published}} under the pseudonym K. Freigedank ('Freethought') in volume 33, no. 19 (3 September 1850). Ignaz Moscheles and other teachers at the Leipzig Conservatory were outraged and called for Brendel's resignation from its board. Wagner's article had insulted the memory of Felix Mendelssohn, the conservatory's founder - but had little further effect at the time. Later in the nineteenth century, it contributed to the rise in anti-semitism, including criticism of music by Jewish composers who differed in style from Wagner. Brendel continued to edit the magazine {{until his death in}} 1868.|$|R
