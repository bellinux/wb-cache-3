25|$|Warning {{signs are}} often used where sight {{distance}} is insufficient. The US MUTCD requires Stop Ahead, Yield Ahead or Signal Ahead signs at intersections where the traffic control device is not visible from a distance equal to the stopping sight distance at speed of approaching traffic. Hill Blocks View signs can be used where crest vertical curves restrict sight distance. However, many jurisdictions still expect drivers to use <b>ordinary</b> <b>care</b> regarding conditions readily apparent to a driver, without the prompting of a sign. The care and focus ordinarily required of a driver against certain types of hazards may be somewhat amplified on roads with lower functional classification. The probability of spontaneous traffic increases proportionally to the density of access points, and this density should be readily apparent to a driver even when a specific access point is not. For this reason, full corner sight distance is almost never required for individual driveways in urban high-density residential areas, and street parking is commonly permitted within the right-of-way.|$|E
500|$|The fifth commandment forbids {{suicide and}} the mercy killing {{of those who}} are dying, even to {{eliminate}} suffering. The <b>ordinary</b> <b>care</b> of those facing an imminent death may not morally be withheld, according to the Church. [...] "Ordinary care" [...] refers to food, water and pain relief, and does not include [...] "extraordinary care", which refers to the use of respirators or feeding tubes that are considered discretionary. Allowing a terminally ill person to die, using painkillers that may shorten their life, or refusing extraordinary treatment to the terminally ill such as chemotherapy or radiation, are considered morally acceptable and not a violation of the fifth commandment, in accordance with the principle of double effect.|$|E
2500|$|Early trover cases {{involved}} the keeping or taking of a bailment by the bailee (the person charged {{to hold them}} with [...] "ordinary care"). Others concerned the use of lost chattels found by another. Who was the real owner? Early on, there was difficulty in dealing with situations where chattels held by a bailee were used by a third party. Examples could be sheep, horses, farm goods, grains or other chattels left {{in the care of}} a person who was required to exercise <b>ordinary</b> <b>care.</b> If negligence led to damages, an action could be had. A third person might use the chattel, returning it in a damaged condition. [...] The early common law had some difficulty in dealing with this kind of situation. This led to expansions of actions in trover.|$|E

2500|$|Opposing the claim, Serjeant Adams {{denied that}} the cart had been overloaded, noting that Priestley had {{continued}} on the journey after first witnessing Beeton's protest, and then hearing the cart crack near Peterborough. Nor could Fowler be held liable, Adams continued, as he was only bound to use [...] "such <b>ordinary</b> <b>care</b> and diligence as he would use over himself," [...] and the defendant had been satisfied as {{to the state of}} his property. In any event, Serjeant Adams asserted that as a legal matter, Fowler as a master was not liable to his servant Priestley. This was because there was [...] "no such case in the books," [...] and for good reason: [...] "If the defendant was responsible in this case, every master was liable to any accident that might occur to his servant about his work." [...] No evidence reveals the possible negligence of Priestley's fellow servants ever being raised or at issue during the trial.|$|E

40|$|CBT {{treatment}} programmes {{for children}} and adolescents with anxiety disorders are promising as indicated by efficacy research. Replicating this research in <b>ordinary</b> clinical <b>care</b> is crucial {{in order to establish}} the validity of these results and disseminate empirically based treatments to practitioners. This paper presents the first experiences of using a structured programme, the Friends for Life manual, in <b>ordinary</b> clinical <b>care</b> in Norway targeting anxiety problems in children aged between 7 and 12 years. The effects of the treatment are presented as multiple single-case studies. Clinical meaningful change is considered from two perspectives; diagnostic change and changes in self-report measures. At a statistical significance level the treatment effect can be characterized as modest. Independent of the symptom reduction, the children, families and therapist are in the main satisfied with the structured approach indicating the acceptability of the programme...|$|R

50|$|Within about a {{year and}} four months from the death of his first wife, he Emmons married Martha, {{daughter}} of the Rev. Chester Williams of Hadley, Massachusetts. He found her to be a companion not only distinguished for her excellent intellectual and moral qualities, but of such exemplary domestic habits as to relieve him, in a great measure, from the <b>ordinary</b> <b>cares</b> of his family. By this marriage he had six children, two sons and four daughters. In 1813, Emmons' second daughter died, followed within a few years by another son and daughter. Emmons' second wife, Martha, died in August, 1829, when Emmons was 85. In 1831, Emmons married for the third time, to the widow of the late Rev. Edmund Mills of Sutton, Massachusetts. His health and spirits seemed to revive, so that he was enabled to endure the fatigue of several journeys of considerable length.|$|R

They are totally distinct from the busy, thrifty people about them. They seem to be, like the Indians of America, either above or below the <b>ordinary</b> <b>cares</b> and anxieties of mankind.

I was still rapidly ascending, and my barometer gave a present altitude of three and three-quarter miles. Immediately beneath me in the ocean, lay a small black object, slightly oblong in shape, seemingly about the size, and in every way bearing a great resemblance to one of those childish toys called a domino. Bringing my telescope to bear upon it, I plainly discerned it to be a British ninety four-gun ship, close-hauled, and pitching heavily in the sea with her head to the W.S.W. Besides this ship, I saw nothing but the ocean and the sky, and the sun, which had long arisen.|$|R
