40|$|Ergonomic {{problems}} of surgical lighting {{systems have been}} indicated by surgeons; however, the underlying causes are not clear. The aim of this dissertation is to assess the problems in detail, and subsequently clarify the underlying causes. In {{the first stage of}} the research, the observation method was used to quantify the luminaire use during 46 hours of <b>open</b> <b>routine</b> surgical procedures in the field of general surgery. The location of the observation study was the Reinier de Graaf Gasthuis hospital in Delft, which employs the Berchtold Chromophare C series as the surgical lighting system. The results showed that every 7. 5 minute a luminaire action takes place, intended to reposition the luminaire. Of these LAs, 74 % was performed by surgeons and residents. For 64 % of these LAs the surgical tasks of OR-staff were interrupted. Observed difficulties were collision of the luminaire against any object, or that the luminaire was out of reach for the surgeon in a sitting posture. The primary difficulty appeared in the kinetic relation during the SLS and user interaction, as manoeuvrability of the luminaire was cumbersome and in some situations the system was immovable. These problems primarily occur during the repositioning of the luminaire 2 dimensional plane of the pendant arms. In the second research stage a valid simulation model of the surgical lighting system was constructed in MSC Adams software to allow virtual experiments to analyse the system mechanics. The model showed that the required force during luminaire usage depends on the location of the luminaire its work field and are on average higher than ergonomically acceptable. Primary cause of this difficulty with the current systems is the two pendant arms construction as the highest forces were found when the luminaire was directly below the ceiling suspension or in the peripheral region of the work field. In those regions the pendant arms are either in parallel or serial alignment. The force spectrum for luminaire use showed a diffuse image, ranging from 14 Newton till unlimited quantities when the system is unmovable. The average required force is 136 Newton in the region where the observed luminaire use was primarily undertaken. In addition, the software engineering model which was constructed in this study is applicable as a test procedure to analyse surgical lighting systems. As a result, this dissertation stated novel insights into the OR lighting problem during <b>open</b> <b>routine</b> surgical procedures in the field of general surgery. And it presented a valid simulation model of a surgical lighting system Berchtold Chromophare C series. The protocol for the model construction can be user to analyse surgical lighting system of different brands using engineering software simulation. Furthermore, this dissertation presented a direction for future research and an improved user system interaction of the luminaire during surgical procedures.

This study was conducted to evaluate the feasibility and safety of utilizing laparoscopic partial nephrectomy in dogs and to compare this technique with <b>open</b> <b>routine</b> partial nephrectomy {{for the first time in}} Iran. Design- Experimental study. Animals- Sixteen large mixed-breed female dogs, weighting 22 ± 5 kg, 1 - 2 years age. Procedures- All dogs were anesthetized and positioned for surgery on left kidney. Partial nephrectomy (PN) was performed through five portals in left flank in laparoscopic group and through midline incision in open group. After renal artery was recognized and clamped, the caudal pole of kidney was resected. Then the exposed renal parenchyma was sutured. Operative time, ischemia time, incision length, clinical findings, hematological parameters, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine and intra and post-operative complications were recorded for one month. Results- Surgeries were performed successfully in both groups and visualization was excellent in laparoscopic group. Mean operative time was insignificantly longer in laparoscopic group. Mean ischemia time was evaluated more in laparoscopic group but total length of incisional scar was obviously longer in open cases. There was mild infection in one portal site of first group. Other parameters were assessed normal and there was no significant complication in both groups. Conclusion and Clinical Relevance- This experience demonstrated that LPN is a safe and feasible procedure in dogs with acceptable outcomes and advantages comparing with open PN.

30|$|Unlike fault prediction, fault {{detection}} is reactive and identifies and, or classifies a failure {{after it has}} occurred, using network symptoms, performance degradation, and other parameters. Rao [382] propose {{fault detection}} for cellular networks that can detect faults at different levels, base station, sector, carrier, and channel. They employ a statistical hypothesis testing framework which combines parametric, semi-parametric, and non-parametric test statistics to model expected behavior. In parametric and semi-parametric statistical tests, a fault is detected when significant deviations from the expected activity is observed. In the case of non-parametric statistical tests, where the expected distribution is not known a-priori, the authors {{use a combination of}} empirical data and statistical correlations to conduct the hypothesis test. The test is dependent on a threshold value that is initially set through statistical analysis of traffic patterns. However, improper threshold settings may lead to high FPs and FNs. Hence, the threshold should be adapted to changing traffic patterns due to spatial, temporal, and seasonal effects. In the background, an <b>open</b> loop <b>routine</b> continuously learns and updates the threshold, in an adjustable period of time.

The mineral composition and quantity within calcified arterial plaques remains unelucidated; therefore, {{the aim of}} this study was to analyze the mineral composi-tion of such plaques. Calcified arterial plaques were obtained from patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) and carotid artery stenoses. Calcified aneurysmal plaques were obtained during the <b>routine</b> <b>open</b> repair of AAAs, while calcified carotid plaques were collected from patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Following the appropriate preparation of each sample, inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP‑AES) was used to analyze the calcium and phosphate levels, while flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS) was used to analyze the levels of iron and zinc. The levels of these mineral components were evaluated. In the aortic and carotid plaques, the mean calcium concentration was 9. 83 and 11. 94 wt. %, respectively, and the mean phosphate concentration was 4. 31 and 6. 08 wt. %, respectively. It was not possible to analyze the absolute concentration of iron in the carotid plaques due to the concentration being below the measurement limit. The zinc concentration was variable between samples. In conclu-sion, the main components of aortic and carotid plaques are calcium and phosphate.

40|$|The natural proof {{technique}} for heap verification developed by Qiu et al. [32] provides {{a platform for}} powerful sound reasoning for specifications written in a dialect of separation logic called Dryad. Natural proofs are proof tactics that enable automated reasoning exploiting recursion, mimicking common patterns found in human proofs. However, these proofs are known to work only for a simple toy language [32]. In this work, we develop a framework called VCDRYAD that extends the VCC framework [9] to provide an automated deductive framework against separation logic specifications for C programs based on natural proofs. We develop several new techniques to build this framework, including (a) a novel tool architecture that allows encoding natural proofs {{at a higher level}} in order to use the existing VCC framework (including its intricate memory model, the underlying type-checker, and the SMT-based verification infrastructure), and (b) a synthesis of ghost-code annotations that captures natural proof tactics, in essence forcing VCC to find natural proofs using primarily decidable theories.

MethodsTwenty-one neonatal piglets underwent 180 minutes of full-flow cardiopulmonary bypass with pulmonary artery occlusion, followed by reperfusion. The piglets were divided into 3 groups of 7 animals. In group I, uncontrolled reperfusion was achieved by unclamping the pulmonary artery. In contrast, pulmonary reperfusion was done with leukocyte-depleted hyperoxemic blood in group II or with leukocyte-depleted hypoxemic blood in group III for 15 minutes at a flow rate of 10 mL/min/kg before pulmonary artery unclamping. Then the animals were monitored for 120 minutes to evaluate post-cardiopulmonary bypass pulmonary function. ResultsGroup I developed pulmonary dysfunction that was characterized by an increased alveolar-arterial oxygen difference (204 ± 57. 7 mm Hg), pulmonary vasoconstriction, and decreased static lung compliance. Terminal leukocyte-depleted lung reperfusion attenuated post-cardiopulmonary bypass pulmonary dysfunction and vasoconstriction when hypoxemic blood was used for reperfusion (alveolar-arterial oxygen difference, 162 ± 61. 0 mm Hg). In contrast, no benefit of terminal leukocyte-depleted lung reperfusion was detected after reperfusion with hyperoxemic blood (alveolar-arterial oxygen difference, 207 ± 60. 8 mm Hg). ConclusionReperfusion with leukocyte-depleted hypoxemic blood has a protective effect against ischemia/reperfusion-induced pulmonary dysfunction by reducing endothelial damage, cytokine release, and leukocyte activation...|$|R
40|$|Recently, two new and {{independent}} methods for quantitative studies of SAR imaging of current features {{were presented in}} the July 2005 issue of Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans. They are the Doppler shift approach and the radar imaging modelling (RIM) approach. It is therefore timely to combine these two approaches for more comprehensive and quantitative studies of SAR imaging of current features. In this paper we present and examine the preliminary results obtained with this new “DopRim ” model, which also features an independent wind-wave SAR retrieval tool. Forward simulations of SAR images using this DopRim model have been conducted for two test areas around the French coast {{at the entrance to}} the English Channel. The 3 D current fields are taken from numerical ocean models, while the wind and dominant wave field are retrieved from the respective SAR images. These products serve as the input for the forward DopRim module. Extensive testing and validation of this method is currently ongoing. Preliminary results show that surface current velocities and estimation of current deformation such as zones of convergence and current shear can be derived in consistence with the SAR backscatter anomalies, near surface wind and wave fields, and the measured Doppler shifts. The inverse module, when fully tested and validated, is expected to significantly advance the use of SAR imagery in quantitative studies of mesoscale features such as fronts, eddies and filaments. In the longer term, it may also <b>open</b> up for <b>routine</b> application of SAR image data in operational oceanography...|$|R
