5|$|In France, as in Italy, Spain and Portugal, organs were {{primarily}} designed to play alternatim verses rather than accompany congregational singing. The French Classical Organ, became remarkably consistent throughout France {{over the course}} of the Baroque era, more so than any other style of <b>organ</b> <b>building</b> in history, and standardized registrations developed. It was elaborately described by Dom Bédos de Celles in his treatise L'art du facteur d'orgues (The Art of <b>Organ</b> <b>Building).</b>|$|E
5|$|Different {{national}} {{styles of}} <b>organ</b> <b>building</b> began to develop, often due to changing political climates. In the Netherlands, the organ became a large instrument with several divisions, doubled ranks, and mounted cornets. The organs of northern Germany also had more divisions, and independent pedal divisions became increasingly common. The {{divisions of the}} organ became visibly discernible from the case design. 20th-century musicologists labelled this the Werkprinzip.|$|E
5|$|Special unpitched stops {{also appear}} in some organs. Among {{these are the}} Zimbelstern (a wheel of {{rotating}} bells), the nightingale (a pipe submerged in a small pool of water, creating {{the sound of a}} bird warbling when wind is admitted), and the effet d'orage ("thunder effect", a device that sounds the lowest bass pipes simultaneously). Standard orchestral percussion instruments such as the drum, chimes, celesta, and harp have also been imitated in <b>organ</b> <b>building.</b>|$|E

50|$|The Robert Morton Organ Company was a {{producer}} of theater pipe organs and church organs, located in Van Nuys, California. Robert Morton was the number two volume producer of theatre <b>organs,</b> <b>building</b> approximately half as many organs as the industry leader Wurlitzer. The name Robert Morton was derived not from any person in the company, but rather from the name of company president Harold J. Werner's son, Robert Morton Werner.|$|R

5|$|At the {{entrance}} to the south transept is the organ. This is by Forster and Andrews, of Hull. This <b>organ</b> <b>building</b> company was formed by James Alderson Forster (1818–1886) and Joseph King Andrews (1820–1896). The business developed and {{became one of the most}} successful of the North of England organ builder. The business was taken over by John Christie in 1924 and finally wound up in 1956. As well as their Hull headquarters, the company had branches in London and York. The organ dates from 1885. It was a gift from Sir Pryse Pryse, Bt DL JP, of Gogerddan. The organ has a pine case, and painted pipes.|$|E

500|$|During the Renaissance and Baroque periods, the organ's tonal colors {{became more}} varied. Organ {{builders}} fashioned stops that imitated various instruments, {{such as the}} krummhorn and the viola da gamba. The Baroque period is often thought of as <b>organ</b> <b>building's</b> [...] "golden age", as virtually every important refinement was brought to a culminating art. Builders such as Arp Schnitger, Jasper Johannsen, Zacharias Hildebrandt and Gottfried Silbermann constructed instruments that were in themselves artistic masterpieces, displaying both exquisite craftsmanship and beautiful sound. These organs featured well-balanced mechanical key actions, giving the organist precise control over the pipe speech. Schnitger's organs featured particularly distinctive reed timbres and large Pedal and Rückpositiv divisions.|$|R

25|$|The {{composer}} {{most probably}} {{spent his entire}} life in Amsterdam, only occasionally visiting other cities in connection with his professional activities: {{he was asked to}} inspect organs, give opinions and advice on <b>organ</b> <b>building</b> and restoration, etc. These duties resulted in short visits to Delft, Dordrecht (1614), Enkhuizen, Haarlem (1594), Harderwijk (1608), Middelburg (1603), Nijmegen (1605), Rotterdam (1610), Rhenen (1616), as well as Deventer, his birthplace (1595, 1616). Sweelinck's longest voyage was to Antwerpen in 1604, when he was commissioned by the Amsterdam authorities to buy a harpsichord for the city. No documentary evidence has turned up to support the tradition, going back to Mattheson, that Sweelinck visited Venice– perhaps a confusion with his brother, the painter Gerrit Pietersz Sweelink, who did– and similarly {{there is no evidence that}} he ever crossed the English Channel, although copies of his music did such as the pieces included in the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book. His popularity as a composer, performer and teacher increased steadily during his lifetime. Contemporaries nicknamed him Orpheus of Amsterdam and even the city authorities frequently brought important visitors to hear Sweelinck's improvisations.|$|E
500|$|Beginning {{in about}} 1400, {{the rate of}} {{development}} of musical instruments increased in earnest as compositions demanded more dynamic sounds. People also began writing books about creating, playing, and cataloging musical instruments; the first such book was Sebastian Virdung's 1511 treatise Musica getuscht und ausgezogen ('Music Germanized and Abstracted'). Virdung's work is noted as being particularly thorough for including descriptions of [...] "irregular" [...] instruments such as hunters' horns and cow bells, though Virdung is critical of the same. Other books followed, including Arnolt Schlick's Spiegel der Orgelmacher und Organisten ('Mirror of Organ Makers and Organ Players') the following year, a treatise on <b>organ</b> <b>building</b> and organ playing. Of the instructional books and references published in the Renaissance era, one is noted for its detailed description and depiction of all wind and stringed instruments, including their relative sizes. This book, the Syntagma musicum by Michael Praetorius, is now considered an authoritative reference of sixteenth-century musical instruments.|$|E
2500|$|Aristide Cavaillé-Coll ( [...] ; 4 February 1811 [...] 13 October 1899), was a French organ builder.

He pioneered innovations in the art and science of <b>organ</b> <b>building</b> that permeated throughout the profession and influenced the course of <b>organ</b> <b>building</b> and organ composing through the early 20th century. The organ reform movement sought to return <b>organ</b> <b>building</b> to a more Baroque style; but since the 1980s, Cavaillé-Coll's designs have come back into fashion. After Cavaillé-Coll's death, Charles Mutin maintained the business into the 20th century. Cavaillé-Coll was the author of many scientific journal articles and books on the organ in which he published the results of his researches and [...] experiments. He was the inventor of several organ sounds/ranks/stops such as the flûte harmonique.|$|E

2500|$|His {{pamphlet}} [...] "The Art of <b>Organ</b> <b>Building</b> and Organ Playing in Germany and France" [...] (1906, republished with an appendix on {{the state}} of the organ-building industry in 1927) effectively launched the 20th-century Orgelbewegung, which turned away from romantic extremes and rediscovered baroque principles—although this sweeping reform movement in <b>organ</b> <b>building</b> eventually went further than Schweitzer himself had intended. In 1909 he addressed the Third Congress of the International Society of Music at Vienna on the subject. Having circulated a questionnaire among players and organ-builders in several European countries, he produced a very considered report. This provided the basis for the International Regulations for <b>Organ</b> <b>Building.</b> He envisaged instruments in which the French late-romantic full-organ sound should work integrally with the English and German romantic reed pipes, and with the classical Alsace Silbermann organ resources and baroque flue pipes, all in registers regulated (by stops) to access distinct voices in fugue or counterpoint capable of combination without loss of distinctness: different voices singing together in the same music.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the success}} of the {{oscilloscope}} kit, Heath went on to produce dozens of Heathkit products. Heathkits were influential in shaping two generations of electronic hobbyists. The Heathkit sales premise was that by investing the time to assemble a Heathkit, the purchaser could build something comparable to a factory-built product at a very significantly lower cash cost and, if it malfunctioned, could repair it himself. [...] During those decades, the premise was basically valid. Commercial factory-built electronic products were constructed from generic, discrete components such as vacuum tubes, tube sockets, capacitors, inductors and resistors, and essentially hand-wired and assembled. The home kit-builder could perform these assembly tasks himself, and, if careful, to at least the same standard of quality. In the case of their most expensive product, the Thomas electronic <b>organ,</b> <b>building</b> the Heathkit version represented very substantial savings.|$|E

A second console (two manuals and pedal) located in the rear gallery controls pipes located in the alcoves adjacent to the gallery. [...] The main console also has access to the rear gallery pipes. While most of the main organ pipes are located around the front chancel a commanding “tuba” (trumpet) stop is located [...] above in a ceiling chamber.|$|E
2500|$|Cavaillé-Coll is {{responsible}} for many innovations that revolutionized <b>organ</b> <b>building,</b> performance and composition. Instead of the Positif, Cavaillé-Coll placed the Grand-Chœur manual as the lowest manual, and included couplers that allowed the entire tonal resources of the organ to be played from the Grand-Chœur. He refined the English swell box by devising a spring-loaded (later balanced) pedal with which the organist could operate the swell shutters, thus increasing the organ's potential for expression. He adjusted pipemaking and voicing techniques, thus creating a whole family of stops imitating orchestral instruments such as the bassoon, the oboe and the english horn. He popularized the harmonic flute stop, which, together with the montre, the gambe and the bourdon, formed the fonds (foundations) of the organ. He introduced divided windchests which were controlled by ventils. [...] These allowed the use of higher wind pressures and for each manual's anches (reed stops) to be added or subtracted as a group {{by means of a}} pedal. Higher wind pressures allowed the organ to include many more stops of 8' (unison) pitch in every division, so complete fonds as well as reed choruses could be placed in every division, designed to be superimposed on top of one another. Sometimes he placed the treble part of the compass on a higher pressure than the bass, to emphasize melody lines and counteract the natural tendency of small pipes (especially reeds) to be softer.|$|E
50|$|Correa's organ {{music was}} {{inspired}} by the unique tonal qualities of Spanish organs, unequal temperament, and such devices as the divided keyboard. Modern-day recording technology, coupled with an increased interest in studying ancient <b>organs</b> and <b>building</b> newer instruments to replicate them, has made these works more readily accessible to both performer and listener.|$|R
50|$|It {{has often}} been claimed that Wilhelm Wundt, the father of modern psychology, {{was the first to}} adopt introspection to {{experimental}} psychology though the methodological idea had been presented long before, as by 18th century German philosopher-psychologists such as Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten or Johann Nicolaus Tetens. Also, Wundt's views on introspection must be approached with great care. Wundt was influenced by notable physiologists, such as Gustav Fechner, who used a kind of controlled introspection as a means to study human sensory <b>organs.</b> <b>Building</b> upon the pre-existing use of introspection in physiology, Wundt imposed exacting control over the use of introspection in his experimental laboratory at the University of Leipzig making it possible for other scientists to replicate his experiments elsewhere, a development that proved essential to the development of psychology as a modern, peer-reviewed scientific discipline.|$|R
