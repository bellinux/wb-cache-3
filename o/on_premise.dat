25|$|In January 2002, Bush {{signed the}} No Child Left Behind Act, with Democratic Senator Ted Kennedy as chief sponsor, {{which aims to}} close the {{achievement}} gap, measures student performance, provides options to parents with children in low-performing schools, and targets more federal funding to low-income schools. Critics, including Senator John Kerry and the National Education Association, say schools were not given the resources to help meet new standards, although their argument is based <b>on</b> <b>premise</b> that authorization levels are spending promises instead of spending caps. The House Committee on Education and the Workforce said that the Department of Education's overall funding increased by US$14 billion since the enactment of NCLB in fiscal year 2001, going from US$42.6 billion to US$56.6 billion in fiscal year 2005.

The author referred to the process of a thetan leaving its human body as [...] "exteriorization", which he said allowed for space travel. Urban notes that this is similar to Aleister Crowley's teachings of astral projection, although he adds that Hubbard did not use that term.|$|E
