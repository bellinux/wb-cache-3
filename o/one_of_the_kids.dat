25|$|The {{part that}} I never really {{developed}} {{is the death}} of Luke and Leia's mother. I had a backstory for her in earlier drafts, but it basically didn't survive. When I got to Jedi, I wanted <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> {{to have some kind}} of memory of her because she will be a key figure in the new episodes I'm writing. But I really debated whether or not Leia should remember her.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} September 1957, {{the nine}} were {{admitted}} to Little Rock Central High {{under the protection of}} the 101st Airborne Division (and later the Arkansas National Guard), but they were still subjected to a year of physical and verbal abuse (being spat on and called names) by many of the white students. Melba Pattillo had acid thrown into her eyes and also recalled in her book, Warriors Don't Cry, an incident in which a group of white girls trapped her in a stall in the girls' washroom and attempted to burn her by dropping pieces of flaming paper on her from above. Another one of the students, Minnijean Brown, was verbally confronted and abused. She said I was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> 'approved' by the school officials. We were told we would have to take a lot and were warned not to fight back if anything happened. One girl ran up to me and said, 'I'm so glad you're here. Won't you go to lunch with me today?' I never saw her again.|$|E

500|$|Like Amir, {{the protagonist}} of the novel, Hosseini was born in Afghanistan and left {{the country as a}} youth, not {{returning}} until 2003. Thus, he was frequently questioned about the extent of the autobiographical aspects of the book. In response, he said, [...] "When I say some of it is me, then people look unsatisfied. The parallels are pretty obvious, but... I left a few things ambiguous because I wanted to drive the book clubs crazy." [...] Having left the country {{around the time of the}} Soviet invasion, he felt a certain amount of survivor's guilt: [...] "Whenever I read stories about Afghanistan my reaction was always tinged with guilt. A lot of my childhood friends had a very hard time. Some of our cousins died. One died in a fuel truck trying to escape Afghanistan [...] Talk about guilt. He was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> I grew up with flying kites. His father was shot." [...] Regardless, he maintains that the plot is fictional. Later, when writing his second novel, A Thousand Splendid Suns (then titled Dreaming in Titanic City), Hosseini remarked that he was happy that the main characters were women as it [...] "should put the end to the autobiographical question once and for all".|$|E
2500|$|The {{shooting}} colored what sparse legacy his FSA {{work had}} left him. [...] Colleen McDannell says that, because of it, [...] "Dick {{was the most}} infamous of the FSA photographers." [...] Stryker connects it to his sense of the pattern of Dick's life: [...] "He shot himself, or he shot his wife, and <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> and himself. [...] He {{never had a chance}} to be himself. It was one of the worst cases I've ever known in my experience of the wealthy son who couldn't get away from it." [...] Of course, Stryker's memory is poor, as Dick's children were unharmed.|$|E

Roberts was captain of one outfit, and once, after a fight, they took a lot of prisoners--squaws, an' kids an' babies. An' <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> was my father.

6000|$|... "They {{were now}} {{entered into the}} deep time of Lent, and could get no flesh in their inns. Whereupon fell out a {{pleasant}} passage, if I may insert it, by the way, among more serious. There was, near Bayonne, a herd of goats, with their young ones; upon the sight whereof, Sir Richard Graham tells the marquis (of Buckingham), that he would snap <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids,</b> and make some shift to carry him snug to their lodging. Which the prince overhearing, 'Why, Richard,' says he, 'do you think you may practise here your old tricks upon the borders?' Upon which words, they, in the first place, gave the goat-herd good contentment; and then, while the marquis and Richard, being both on foot, were chasing the kid about the stack, the prince, from horseback, killed him in the head, with a Scottish pistol.--Which circumstance, though trifling, may yet serve to shew how his Royal Highness, even in such slight and sportful damage, had a noble sense of just dealing."--Sir HENRY WOTTON'S Life of the Duke of Buckingham.|$|E
60|$|After I {{had been}} {{two or three days}} {{returned}} to my castle, I thought that, in order to bring Friday off from his horrid way of feeding, and from the relish of a cannibal's stomach, I ought to let him taste other flesh; so I took him out with me one morning to the woods. I went, indeed, intending to kill a kid out of my own flock, and bring it home and dress it; but as I was going, I saw a she-goat lying down in the shade, and two young kids sitting by her. I catched hold of Friday;--Hold, said I; stand still; and made signs to him not to stir: immediately I presented my piece, shot, and killed <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids.</b> The poor creature, who had, at a distance, indeed, seen me kill the savage, his enemy, but did not know, nor could imagine, how it was done, was sensibly surprised, trembled and shook, and looked so amazed, that I thought he would have sunk down. He did not see the kid I shot at, or perceive I had killed it, but ripped up his waistcoat, to feel whether he was not wounded; and, as I found presently, thought I was resolved to kill him: for he came and kneeled down to me, and embracing my knees, said a great many things I did not understand; but I could easily see the meaning was, to pray me not to kill him.|$|E

60|$|I had {{not been}} above {{two or three days}} {{returned}} to my castle, but my chief design was, how I should bring Friday off from this horrid way of feeding; and to take from him that inhuman relish he by nature had been accustomed to, I thought it my duty to let him taste other flesh, which might the rather tempt him to the same abhorrence I so often expressed against their accursed way of living. Upon which, one morning I took him out with me, with an intention to kill a kid out of the flock, and bring it home and dress it. As I was going, I perceived a she-goat lying down in the shade, and two young kids sitting by her. Immediately I catched hold of my man Friday, and bidding him stand still, and not stir, I presented my piece, and shot <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids.</b> My poor servant, who had at a distance perceived me kill his adversary, and yet did not know by what means, or how it was done, stood trembling and surprised, and looked so amazed, that I thought he would have sunk into the earth.
