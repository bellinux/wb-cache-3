5|$|Minor {{changes were}} made to the track on 22 February 2010 after {{bobsleigh}} four-man teams from Latvia and Croatia rolled over in supplementary practice. Following a meeting with 11 team captains, practice runs were postponed by the FIBT until later that day to adjust the shape <b>of</b> <b>turn</b> 11 so it would be easier for sleds to get {{through the rest of the}} track without crashing. FIBT spokesman Don Krone also stated that it was common that turn profiles were changed when it was being used by other sliding disciplines such as luge and skeleton.|$|E
5|$|As the pit stops {{started on}} lap eleven, Massa, Nico Hülkenberg and Felipe Nasr {{were the first}} to come in for new tyres. Hamilton had managed to extend his {{advantage}} over Vettel to almost 8 seconds when Vettel made a pit stop– the first of the front runners to do so– on lap 14. The undercut-strategy worked, as Rosberg emerged from the pit lane behind the Ferrari when he made a pit stop one lap later. Hamilton changed tyres on the following lap, emerging close in front of the battling Rosberg and Vettel, with the Mercedes driver taking second position in a DRS-aided move on the inside <b>of</b> <b>turn</b> one. He was now close behind teammate Hamilton, but ultimately unable to attack him for the lead. Räikkönen was the last of the top four to pit, on lap 18 and applied a different strategy, as he used the harder medium tyres, while the Mercedes and Vettel were running their middle stint on the softer tyre compound. Even with the harder tyres, he was able to close to the top three.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the first act, the judge asks the court clerk to call jurors from the audience. Once the jurors are seated, the prosecution argument begins. Flint explains that Andre was not just Faulkner's secretary, but also his lover. He says Faulkner jilted her to marry Nancy Lee Whitfield and fired Andre, motivating Andre to murder him. Flint then calls a series of witnesses, starting with the medical examiner, who testifies that Faulkner's body was so damaged by the fall {{that it was impossible to}} determine whether he was killed by the impact or was already dead. An elderly night watchman and a private investigator describe the events they saw that evening. A police inspector testifies to finding a suicide note. Faulkner's very religious housekeeper disapprovingly describes the sexual relationship between Andre and Faulkner, and says she saw Andre with another man after Faulkner's marriage. Nancy Lee testifies about her and Faulkner's courtship and marriage, portraying both as idyllic. The act ends with Andre speaking out <b>of</b> <b>turn</b> to accuse Nancy Lee of lying.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} enzyme-inhibiting {{adjuvants}} on L-DOPA + benserazide-induced contralateral turning in unilateral 6 -hydroxydopamine (6 -OHDA) -lesioned rats was studied. Both the number <b>of</b> <b>turns</b> and the duration <b>of</b> <b>turning</b> were examined. Inhibition of MAO-A with 10 mg/kg Ro 41 - 1049 increased both parameters; inhibition of COMT with 30 mg/kg Ro 40 - 7592 {{had a similar}} effect. In contrast, inhibition of MAO-B with 10 mg/kg Ro 19 - 6327 did not change turning behavior. A further potentiation <b>of</b> <b>turning</b> behavior was observed after the combined administration of both the MAO-A and COMT inhibitor. MAO-A inhibition in conjunction with MAO-B inhibition prolonged the duration <b>of</b> L-DOPA-induced <b>turning</b> but {{had no effect on}} the number <b>of</b> <b>turns.</b> However, in conjunction with COMT inhibition, 10 mg/kg of the MAO-B inhibitor, Ro 19 - 6327, significantly affected both the number and duration <b>of</b> <b>turning</b> behavior. An even further potentiation <b>of</b> <b>turning</b> behavior was observed after the combined administration of all three enzyme-inhibitors...|$|R
5|$|At {{the start}} of the race Hamilton, Rosberg and Vettel {{maintained}} their grid positions into the first corner, while Daniil Kvyat managed to overtake team-mate Daniel Ricciardo for fourth. Trying to get past Nico Hülkenberg on the inside <b>of</b> <b>turn</b> five, Fernando Alonso made contact with Hülkenberg, who hit the wall but was able to continue, though {{at the back of the}} field. Alonso was reprimanded with a five-second penalty to serve at his first pit stop. Meanwhile, Felipe Massa made contact with Pastor Maldonado, damaging his front wing. Massa came into the pit lane for a new wing and equipped the harder tyre compound. Maldonado suffered from brake problems in the early laps, eventually retiring on lap seven.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the race, all drivers {{at the front of the}} grid got away without {{incident}} and with no changes in position. On the outside <b>of</b> <b>turn</b> three, Nico Hülkenberg was able to get around Pastor Maldonado for sixth position. Sebastian Vettel and Felipe Massa, who both started from the rear end of the grid, made up places early in the race, running in twelfth and thirteenth by lap 9, when Vettel came into the pit lane for his first stop. The pit stop did not go well, as his car was stationary for about six seconds. Massa in turn went past Marcus Ericsson for eleventh two laps later in a wheel-to-wheel manoeuvre through turns one and two. Meanwhile, at the front, Lewis Hamilton had built a sufficient gap to second-placed Rosberg to deny Rosberg the chance to use DRS and try to overtake.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} laps, Massa {{appeared}} to have a faster car than Hamilton, and repeatedly tried to pass the McLaren on the inside <b>of</b> <b>turn</b> four. His first attempt was on lap three, but Hamilton braked late and kept ahead of Massa into the following corner. Massa tried again {{at the same place}} on the next two laps. He passed Hamilton briefly into the turn on lap five, but overshot the corner and ran wide onto the grass. He dropped to fifth, behind teammate Räikkönen and BMW's Nick Heidfeld. Hamilton apologised after the race for 'tricking' Massa into the move. Albers, in the sole remaining Spyker, retired on lap nine with a gearbox fire.|$|E

5|$|Gidley {{lost control}} of the {{rear-end}} of his car exiting turn 11 while accelerating and hit the outside wall which broke his right-front suspension on the same lap. He stopped on the frontstretch and retired from the race. Gidley was unhurt. The ninth period of yellow flags were shown on lap 73 to allow track officials to recover Gidley's damaged car. The race resumed on lap 76 with Andretti leading the field. The tenth caution was necessitated when de Ferran went to the inside <b>of</b> <b>turn</b> three and came across the front wing of da Matta. Jourdain was collected, and Kanaan spun to avoid the two drivers who temporarily blocked the track. De Ferran, da Matta and Jourdain retired, while Kanaan continued without damaging his car. Andretti retained his lead at the lap-79 restart, Fittipaldi was passed by Fernández for fourth position in the first turn. Zanardi moved from eighth to sixth by lap 82, while Fernández got ahead of Junqueira for third on the same lap. Between the 85th and 86th laps, Fittipaldi drove aggressively in an attempt to move in front of Junqueira for fourth but was unable to pass him.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} {{practice}} session, Alonso set the fastest lap {{of the day}} with a time of 1:39.283; Red Bull drivers Vettel and Webber finished with the second and third-fastest times. Rosberg was fourth, ahead of Hamilton and Kubica. Massa, Adrian Sutil, Button and Barrichello followed in the top-ten. Massa caused the session to be disrupted after spinning in the fourth corner and narrowly avoided making contact with the barrier. The session was red-flagged to allow Massa's car to be removed from the centre of the track to be taken to the pit lane. Timo Glock's lost the use of his car's fifth gear and pulled {{over to the side of}} the track at turn twelve which prematurely ended his running. Vitaly Petrov spun at the exit <b>of</b> <b>turn</b> 14 and reversed his car to rejoin the circuit, avoiding the need for a red-flag. Vettel was the fastest driver in the final practice session with a lap of 1:38.052; Webber was third-fastest. Kubica separated the two Red Bull drivers in second, with Sutil fourth. Alonso was fifth-fastest, and Barrichello was sixth. Vitantonio Liuzzi, Massa, Button and Hamilton rounded out the top ten.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} {{practice}} session, Button set the quickest lap of the day, a 1:28.280, which was nearly one {{tenth of a}} second quicker than Webber. Vettel was third fastest followed by Hamilton in fourth. Alonso was fifth. Both Mercedes cars were slower in the session with Rosberg sixth and Schumacher seventh. Kubica, Petrov and Massa followed in the top ten. Webber stopped outside the exit <b>of</b> <b>turn</b> two with an engine failure and engaged in an argument with marshals on preventing the car from moving backwards. In the final practice session, Vettel was fastest {{with a time of}} 1:27.086. This made him three tenths of a second faster than Rosberg in second place. Hamilton set the third quickest lap despite spinning sideways into the turn eight gravel trap. He was ahead of Webber who was afflicted with a throttle problem, Kubica and Alonso. Schumacher, Button, Massa and Petrov completed the top ten ahead of qualifying.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the month}} of July, the Autodromo Nazionale Monza race track's main {{straight}} was straightened and the Variante Goodyear and Seconda Variante chicanes were reconfigured by the race organisers to become a series of narrower corners with the exit away from the entry <b>of</b> <b>turn</b> one. The run-off areas around the two sections of the circuit were enlargened. Some of the drivers, however, were unhappy with the modifications, though, as there were fears of a multi-car accident on the first lap. Coulthard claimed that the new corner would make braking more difficult and was concerned over the amount of penalties issued to other competitors. However, Michael Schumacher believed his and other teams would be less concerned with suspension damage. Jean Alesi {{who was the first}} driver to test the new circuit, said that it would be easier for drivers to pull off the track {{in the event of a}} technical issue.|$|E
5|$|Tagliani ran {{in sixth}} gear after his team {{ordered him to}} {{conserve}} fuel {{and was unable to}} generate enough heat into his tires to challenge Andretti on the restarts. On lap 87, Fittipaldi tried an overtaking manoevure on Junqueira around the outside <b>of</b> <b>turn</b> three which resulted in Fittipaldi and Junqueira making contact and both drivers slid into the outside tire barrier. Andretti's lead of 7.4 seconds was reduced to nothing when the eleventh (and final) caution was displayed on the next lap to allow course officials to extract Fittipaldi's and Junquiera's cars from the track. Racing resumed on lap 90 with Andretti retaining the first position and pulled away {{from the rest of the}} field. Fernández's radio had malfunctioned and was in another gear in an attempt to save fuel which allowed Tagliani to pass him for second. However, Tagliani was unable to close the gap to Andretti because of the presence of Junqueira's lapped car which cost him more than two seconds. He drove on the track's dirty side on the backstraight and his tires were cleaned in the next five turns on the track.|$|E
5|$|The Chief of Staff of the United States Army, General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower, {{met with}} Groves on 30 January 1948 to {{evaluate}} his performance. Eisenhower recounted {{a long list}} of complaints about Groves pertaining to his rudeness, arrogance, insensitivity, contempt for the rules and maneuvering for promotion out <b>of</b> <b>turn.</b> Eisenhower made it clear that Groves would never become Chief of Engineers. Groves realized that in the rapidly shrinking postwar military he would not be given any assignment approaching in importance the one he had held in the Manhattan Project, as such posts would go to combat commanders returning from overseas, and he decided to leave the Army. He was promoted to lieutenant general on 24 January 1948, just before his retirement on 29 February 1948 in recognition of his leadership of the Manhattan Project. By special Act of Congress his date of rank was backdated to 16 July 1945, the date of the Trinity nuclear test.|$|E

5|$|The FIA {{approved}} {{minor changes}} to the layout of the Marina Bay Street Circuit ahead of the Grand Prix. The modifications ran from turn 11 to turn 13; drivers still turned right at turn 11 but it now kinked left slightly on entry, with the track shifting to the left-hand side of Fullerton Road. This changed the profile <b>of</b> <b>turn</b> 12, as drivers now used {{the other side of the}} Anderson Bridge, while the hairpin at turn 13 has been widened by a metre in order to increase overtaking opportunities. The drag reduction system (DRS) had two activation zones for the race; the first between turns five and seven down the length of Raffles Boulevard, and the second on the start/finish straight between turn 23 to turn one.|$|E
5|$|The {{race was}} a story of pit strategy, as the only passing on the circuit was of lapped traffic. Albers was the only car to run a three pit stop race, as all other drivers chose to stop only twice. The only lead changes came on lap 26, as Schumacher's 32-second stop gave Barrichello the lead, and on lap 51, as Schumacher turned in the quickest pit stop at 23.615 seconds, giving him enough time to exit pit lane {{at the same time}} as Barrichello, with the result of forcing Barrichello into the grass <b>of</b> <b>Turn</b> One. After this incident, which was not {{investigated}} by race officials, both Ferrari drivers were reminded over their radios not to crash out of the race, and they both settled into a slower pace, comfortably ahead of the rest of the field. All four of the drivers for Jordan and Minardi scored their first points in Formula One at this race. Karthikeyan's points were the first for an Indian driver in Formula One. This was also the final race at which the Minardi team tallied points.|$|E
5|$|After {{a two-hour}} delay, {{the race was}} restarted. Rahal {{suffered}} clutch problems on the restart, which placed him two laps down, while the other drivers ran behind the safety car, during which the marshalls showed {{the areas in which}} repair work had been conducted. Just prior to the restart, there was a short rain shower which made the track slightly slippy. Power lost one position on the restart, dropping to third. Franchitti, who was the closest driver to the front to have the softer compound red tires fitted gained two positions on the restart, moving up to fourth. The restart only lasted for six corners, before Castroneves spun in the wet conditions, and was then struck by Ed Carpenter. On the next corner, Josef Newgarden had slid into the wall and stalled, and a full-track caution was again called. The race was restarted with nine laps remaining, and Franchitti once more gained a position, passing Pagenaud to gain second. However, the race was almost immediately under a yellow flag again as E.J. Viso was spun by Marco Andretti, and stalled in the middle <b>of</b> <b>turn</b> four. From the ensuing restart, Dixon managed to maintain the lead from Franchitti, and the two Chip Ganassi Racing drivers completed a second successive one-two finish.|$|E

5|$|At the start, Nico Rosberg {{got around}} the outside of Hamilton in turn one, while Räikkönen lost {{positions}} due to a slow getaway. Sebastian Vettel got past Verstappen, but was immediately repassed on the approach to turn four. At {{the front of the}} race, coming out <b>of</b> <b>turn</b> three, Hamilton tried to retake the position from Rosberg. As the latter defended his position, Hamilton went off the track and spun and they collided at turn 4, ending the race of both Mercedes drivers. The collision resulted in a safety car period, with the order standing: Ricciardo, Verstappen, Sainz, Vettel and Räikkönen. The safety car came in at the end of lap four. Vettel got past Sainz on lap eight and Räikkönen tried to follow suit two laps later, but was forced off track into turn two. He completed the move one lap later at the same spot. Sainz and Button were the first to come into the pit lane for new tyres on lap 12, followed by race leader Ricciardo one lap later, making Verstappen the first Dutchman to lead a Grand Prix, before he came in another lap later. When Vettel made a pit stop on lap 16, he emerged third behind the two Red Bull drivers, all on the medium compound tyre.|$|E
5|$|Herta retired on lap 55 when {{he slowed}} on the frontstrech after his car {{developed}} {{a voltage regulator}} problem which caused his engine to cut out. Da Matta moved back into first place on the next lap, but Gidley reclaimed the position four laps later. Tracy slowed on the backstraight on lap 64 and drove to pit road to retire {{with a loss of}} engine power. On the 72nd lap, Vasser took over the lead from Papis. Franchitti lost engine power after leaving turn one and drove down the backstraight to retire, necessitating the second caution. All drivers chose to make pit stops under caution. The race resumed on lap 80 with da Matta passing Castroneves to move back into first place. Da Matta fell to fourth after he was passed by Vasser around the outside <b>of</b> <b>turn</b> one and Castroneves moved into second five laps later. Papis retook the first position on lap 86. Castroneves pulled off the track at turn four and stopped at the pit road exit to retire with an engine failure on the following lap. Mears moved into the lead on lap 87, but lost it to Papis two laps later. Da Matta and Papis traded the first position over laps 91 to 98. Tagliani took over the lead on the 99th lap.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, April 22, 1920, the House reported {{its passage}} of the Maine bill to the Senate. The bill was referred to the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency; on April 28, Connecticut's George P. McLean reported it back with a recommendation that it pass. On May 3, McLean asked that the three coin bills (Maine, Alabama and Pilgrim) be considered by the Senate immediately, fearing that though {{they were on the}} Senate's agenda for that day, they might not be reached, and believing urgent action was required. Utah Senator Reed Smoot objected: Smoot's attempt to bring up an anti-dumping trade bill out <b>of</b> <b>turn</b> had just been objected to by Charles S. Thomas of Colorado. Smoot, however, stated if the coin bills had not been reached by about 2:00 pm, there would probably not be any objection. When McLean tried again to advance the coin bills, Kansas' Charles Curtis asked if there was any urgency. McLean replied that as the three coin bills were to mark ongoing anniversaries, there was a need to have them authorized and get the production process started. All three bills passed the Senate without opposition and the Maine bill was enacted with the signature of President Woodrow Wilson on May 10, 1920.|$|E
