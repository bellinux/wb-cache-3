5000|$|A tenant of {{a market}} garden, or other land, under the Evesham Custom {{has the right to}} sell their tenancy if the {{landlord}} gives their approval, including the right to nominate the new tenant. The payment (known as the [...] "ingoing") made by the incoming tenant includes compensation for any improvements the <b>outgoing</b> <b>tenant</b> has made, such as the planting of fruit trees. The payment also includes a premium for receiving a tenancy offering lifetime security. The entire transaction is made between the outgoing and incoming tenant, with the landlord not involved beyond giving their approval. Furthermore, if the landlord does not accept the new tenant, they are obliged to compensate the <b>outgoing</b> <b>tenant</b> to ensure they did not suffer any financial loss.|$|E

5000|$|Although {{the number}} of market gardens in the Vale of Evesham has {{declined}} sharply since the mid 20th century, the Evesham Custom is still observed in tenancies. In 1995, at {{the reading of the}} Agricultural Tenancies Bill, the local MP Michael Spicer observed that there were still around 420 tenants potentially affected, and noted that they could expect to realise [...] "ingoing" [...] payments of £200-£300 an acre (at that time, 50% of the land's freehold value). As market gardening has further declined it has become more common for landlords to take over the land at the end of tenancies, and by the mid 2000s, there was evidence that solicitors employed by some landlords were attempting to avoid the traditional operation of the Custom by making minimal compensation payments to <b>outgoing</b> <b>tenants.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1945 the {{management}} of the cavern was taken over by the Harrison family who still operate it. The <b>outgoing</b> <b>tenant</b> John Royse, who was close to retirement, reported he had discovered a significant and previously unknown source of Blue John in the cave. Royse intended to return with the 19-year-old Peter Harrison but died before he could describe the location. The lost vein, concealed by wooden battens, a piece of carpet and a layer of clay, was rediscovered in 2013 by John Turner, Peter Harrison's grandson. At current rates of extraction the find is expected to last for at least a decade. The discovery prompted a visit by the BBC's Countryfile programme later that year.|$|E
50|$|A {{certain amount}} of {{recognition}} was given by the Small Holdings and Allotments Act 1908, but the Evesham Custom was eventually given stautory expression in s.68 of the Agricultural Holdings Act 1948, which granted tenant farmers security of tenure for life. There were proposals to abolish it in 1949, which generated protest from fruit growers and market gardeners, and which were not eventually followed through. The rights continued under the Agricultural Holdings Act 1986, but on {{the introduction of the}} Agricultural Tenancies Act 1995, it was required to create a special exclusion to ensure the continued working of the Evesham Custom, as otherwise an <b>outgoing</b> <b>tenant</b> {{would not be able to}} offer a tenancy to an incomer on equivalent terms and security.|$|E
5000|$|There was dissatisfaction from {{industry}} groups with this approach, and the detailed proposals published in September 1992 watered down the initial consultation document quite considerably. [...] In December 1993, the National Farmers Union, the Country Landowners Association, the Tenant Farmers Association and others issued their Joint Industry Statement setting out the consensus proposals for reform. It was this statement {{that formed the}} basis of the Agricultural Tenancies Act 1995, which received royal assent on 9 May 1995. The RICS predicted that it would lead to 1 million extra acres becoming available for letting. Market garden land tenanted under the so-called Evesham Custom was given a specific exemption, as otherwise an <b>outgoing</b> <b>tenant</b> {{would not be able to}} offer a tenancy to an incomer on equivalent terms and security, this being one of the Custom's essential principles.|$|E
