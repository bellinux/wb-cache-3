5|$|Ridiculous Fishing: A Tale of Redemption is {{a mobile}} fishing video game where players use motion and touch {{controls}} to catch fish and subsequently shoot them <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> for cash. The game {{is known for}} its developers' battle against a cloned version of their game released by another company. The game was developed and published by Vlambeer—Rami Ismail and Jan Willem Nijman—and released for iOS on March 13, 2013, and later that year for Android.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the game, Shadow suffers from amnesia. Other than the events of Sonic Heroes that took place three months prior, Shadow remembers only two things: his name and his attempt to escape the space colony ARK with his creator's granddaughter Maria, who was killed by G.U.N. soldiers. Having walked through a room filled with androids that looked like him during the events of Sonic Heroes, Shadow wonders if he too is an android. The game starts with Shadow reminiscing outside the city of Westopolis when the alien race Black Arms drops <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> and invades the city. One Black Arms alien, Doom's Eye, approaches Shadow, and the Black Arms's leader Black Doom tells Shadow of an old agreement Shadow made: to bring Black Doom the Chaos Emeralds. Stunned that Black Doom knew his name, Shadow searches for the Chaos Emeralds to learn about his past.|$|E
5|$|Players cast {{a fishing}} line {{into the ocean}} and use motion {{controls}} to avoid fish as the hook sinks and to catch as many fish as possible as the reel retracts. Players then touch the screen to shoot fish <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> for money that can be spent on upgrades. Nijman developed the idea during a television show about tuna fishermen. The game was first released as Flash game Radical Fishing with the same basic mechanics. A year after Vlambeer began their iOS development, Gamenauts released Ninja Fishing, a clone of the game that hurt Vlambeer morale. The team worked on other games and spoke publicly about the situation to a standing ovation at the 2012 Game Developers Conference before resolving to scrap {{the majority of their}} work and finish the game. Artist Greg Wohlwend moved in with iOS developer Zach Gage to work 14-hour days on the game.|$|E

6000|$|I {{was very}} much afraid {{that we did not}} rejoice quite as unselfishly in Sara's good fortune as we should have done.

50|$|Dr Madigan, the {{anthropologist}} in charge, explains <b>the</b> legend <b>of</b> <b>the</b> totem pole. Hetocumtek was a vicious god who fell <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skies</b> {{and tried to}} enslave {{the people on the}} Mojave plains. The Native American medicine men tricked the god, imprisoning him inside the totem pole. Sarah Jane suspects that Hetocumtek was an alien masquerading as a warrior god. However, a scan detects no alien signs of any kind.|$|R
5|$|Unable {{to enter}} Cortex's castle after getting there via bridge, Crash climbs the tower walls, {{and enters the}} castle through the window he had {{previously}} escaped from. After making {{his way through the}} dark hallways and the Castle's many machines, Crash is confronted by Brio inside his laboratory. Brio uses chemicals to mutate himself into a monster. While Crash is successful in defeating Brio, the castle laboratory catches on fire during the struggle. Crash escapes to Cortex's airship, where he confronts Cortex himself as the castle burns. Cortex attacks him with a plasma gun, but Crash deflects his own projectiles against him and sends Cortex falling <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky.</b> Tawna embraces Crash as the two escape the burning castle on Cortex's airship.|$|E
5|$|Wes and Rui {{then go to}} Realgam Tower. All four {{administrators are}} there and ready to face Wes again. After doing so, he is granted access to the Colosseum {{at the top of}} the building. There, he is greeted by a large crowd. A Cipher man named Nascour tells Wes that he will have to face four trainers. After Wes defeats all four trainers, Nascour fights him. Once defeated, Nascour tries to leave, only to be {{interrupted}} by Es Cade. Es Cade reveals that he is really none other than Evice, the head of Cipher, and battles Wes. When Wes defeats him, Evice attempts to escape by helicopter, but the legendary Pokémon Ho-Oh swoops in and blasts it <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky.</b> Evice and Nascour are presumably arrested.|$|E
5|$|As {{the bombers}} worked over the airfield, Aircraftman D. Roberts waited {{for them on}} the {{northern}} boundary with his parachute-and-cable launchers. Three Do 17s were heading towards him, climbing slowly. When they were in range he fired the cables. Nine rockets flew upwards. Wilhelm Raab saw the rockets go up. Although {{he did not understand}} what they were, he banked the Do 17 to avoid the lines of smoke {{that may or may not}} have concealed something. Because the Dornier banked, one of the cables that hit his bomber slid off the wing before the lower parachute had time to deploy. Pilot Petersen's Dornier was not that lucky. Already on fire it ran into the cable which dragged it <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky.</b> The Do 17 crashed killing all five crewmen. Oberleutnant Rudolf Lamberty (carrying Joachim Roth) also managed to avoid a collision, but before he could do so fire hit his Dornier destroying the fuel tanks. The bomber caught fire and he was barely able to keep control. Eventually it crash-landed at Leaves Green in Kent after being shot down by No. 111 Squadron Hurricanes. Roth was killed, but Lamberty survived with burns.|$|E

5|$|In June 1943, Mayer {{encountered}} Robert S. Johnson, {{a future}} ace from the 56th Fighter Group of the US Eighth Air Force. Johnson's P-47 Thunderbolt had been badly shot-up by some Focke Wulf Fw 190s during a routine mission. As Johnson limped home, with a canopy {{that would not}} open and hydraulic fluid and oil covering his windscreen, Mayer pulled alongside him in his Fw 190. Mayer looked the wounded P-47 over, and then circled to come in from Johnson's six-o'clock {{to give it the}} coup de grâce. The first gun pass failed to knock the heavy American fighter <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky.</b> Mayer made two more runs on Johnson, without success. After running out of ammunition, Mayer pulled alongside Johnson, saluted him and headed for home. Johnson landed his plane, and counted more than 200 holes, without even moving around the airplane. He also saw that a 20mm cannon shell had exploded just behind his headrest, which had made it impossible to open his canopy.|$|E
5|$|It {{seemed to}} the besieged Christians as if arrows were shot <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> to strike and humble {{the pride of}} the infidels who rapidly died with marks on their bodies and lumps in their joints and several part, {{followed}} by putrid fever; all advice and help of the doctors being of no avail. Whereupon the Tartars, worn out by this pestilential disease, and falling on all sides as if thunderstruck, and seeing that they were perishing hopelessly, ordered the corpses to be placed upon their engines and thrown into the city of Kaffa. Accordingly were the bodies of the dead hurled over the walls, so that the Christians were not able to hide or protect themselves from this danger, although they carried away as many dead as possible and threw them into the sea. But soon the whole air became infected, and the water poisoned, and such a pestilence grew up that scarcely one out of a thousand was able to escape.|$|E
5|$|Mario, Luigi, and Bowser {{fly to the}} Beanbean Kingdom via Bowser's airship, the Koopa Cruiser. Mid-flight, Fawful {{attacks the}} cruiser and blows it <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky.</b> The {{brothers}} find themselves at Stardust Fields {{which is at the}} Mushroom/Beanbean Border, after making a deal with Tolstar, the king of Stardust Fields to get some coins to help Bowser who is stuck in a cannon and learning Bros. Techniques from the Border Bros., Tolstar cheats them but is defeated by the brothers, afterwards Bowser is launched out of the cannon and he and the brothers become separated. On their journey, the brothers find themselves at Hoohoo Village at the base of Hoohoo Mountain but cannot travel to the Beanbean Castle because of Fawful setting up a roadblock. Ascending the mountain and defeating its guardian Hoohooros, at the summit they meet Blablanadon a pterodactyl who ferries people to the summit and back to the town below, he discovered a strange egg that soon hatches into a dragon called Dragohoho that the brothers defeat which then transforms into Prince Peasley, who had been transformed into a dragon by Cackletta. Blablanadon takes the brothers back down to the village and they meetup with the Hammer Bros. who fashion them hammers made from a Hoohoo Block that lets them destroy Fawful's roadblock.|$|E

25|$|He fired {{only when}} {{he thought he could}} destroy. Two hundred and fifty yards was the {{distance}} from which he liked best to fire.

For Beurling the confirmed kill was the thing.|$|E
