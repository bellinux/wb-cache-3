The width was 135 feet in 1887, in 120 feet in 1888 and then {{progressively}} until by 1914 it was down to 100 feet at the start tapering to 80 feet at the finish. In 1899, floating booms secured between the pilings which mark the course were also introduced along part of its length in an attempt to keep spectators from obstructing races.|$|E
25|$|Common {{plants in}} the Little Nescopeck Creek {{watershed}} include conifer and hardwood trees, herbs, legumes, and grasses. The {{plants in the}} Little Nescopeck Creek watershed are fairly typical for the Ridge-and-Valley province. Resident deciduous trees in the watershed include five species of oak, one species of cherry, five species of maple, one species of walnut, two species of hickory, and four species of birch, two species of dogwood, and one species each of basswood, poplar, ash, and beech. All but four of these trees {{are found in the}} creek's riparian zone. Coniferous trees in the watershed include three species of pine, two species of spruce, and one species of hemlock. Four of these species are found in the creek's riparian zone. There are also 16 species of legumes, grasses, and weeds, seven species of bushes, and six species of perennials. All <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bushes</b> and perennials, and seven of the grasses are found in Little Nescopeck Creek's riparian zone. There are also a number of aquatic plants in Little Nescopeck Creek. These include bulrush, pondweed, duckweed, waterweed, and some types of algae, all of which are typical for a stream in the eastern United States. The forest around the creek's headwaters are composed mostly of oak and hickory.|$|E

2500|$|The Sinai {{peninsula}} {{has traditionally}} been considered Sinai's location by Christians, although {{it should also be}} noted that the peninsula gained its name from this tradition, and was not called that in Josephus' time or earlier. (The Sinai was earlier inhabited by the Monitu and was called Mafkat or Country of Turquoise.) In early Christian times, a number of Anchorites settled on Mount Serbal, considering it to be the biblical mountain, and in the 4th century a monastery was constructed at its base. Nevertheless, Josephus had stated that Mount Sinai was [...] "the highest of all the mountains thereabout", which would imply that Mount Catherine was actually the mountain in question, if Sinai was to be sited on the Sinai peninsula at all. In the 6th century, Saint Catherine's Monastery was constructed at the base of this mountain, leading to the abandonment of the monastery at Serbal, and two monks, allegedly in 300 CE, claimed that one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bushes</b> in the monastic grounds was the biblical burning bush, and according to monastic tradition this bush still survives (rather than another having grown in its place).|$|E

In view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> issues <b>of</b> <b>the</b> current <b>bushing</b> monitoring method, a new detection method of bushing insulation defects is proposed in this paper. According to <b>the</b> internal structure <b>of</b> <b>bushing,</b> <b>the</b> internal insulation defects are divided into three categories, including partial moisture, pollution, local insulation defects, <b>the</b> outer insulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bushing</b> is equivalent to a resistance chain model. <b>The</b> entire <b>bushing</b> insulation is considered as a parallel between inner insulation and external insulation (inner Insulation is the main). This detection makes uses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transient voltage measured from transformer <b>bushing</b> and <b>the</b> transient current measured from the end shield down-lead as the signal source. The reference data dynamically generated is used to diagnosis and distinguish Insulation defects of Transformer <b>bushing,</b> according to <b>the</b> monitoring data <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bushing</b> and <b>the</b> maximum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reference data, <b>the</b> type <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bushing</b> insulation defect and the severity can be sentenced. A large number of simulation results initially confirmed the effectiveness and feasibility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proposed method...|$|R
