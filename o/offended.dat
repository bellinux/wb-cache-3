40|$|The {{current study}} {{examines}} the intergenerational transmission and concentration of violent <b>offending</b> using conviction data of 3, 440 persons from three consecutive generations from the Dutch Transfive study. Violent <b>offending</b> is more concentrated within nuclear families than non-violent <b>offending,</b> and the intergenerational transmission of violent <b>offending</b> {{is stronger than}} the intergenerational transmission of non-violent <b>offending.</b> Due to the low prevalence of violent <b>offending</b> by women, only transmission from father to son is studied. Paternal violent <b>offending</b> before {{the birth of the}} son does not increase the son's risk to become violent, while paternal violent <b>offending</b> during the son's childhood and adolescence does.

I present a symbolic interactionist framework and use the longitudinal Denver Youth Survey to analyze the age-varying relationships between and among gender, empathic development, and juvenile <b>offending.</b> I find support for the hypothesis that males exhibit, on average, lower levels of empathy across the life course than do females and that empathy mediates the effect of being male on <b>offending.</b> I also find empathic ability is inversely related to <b>offending,</b> and significantly decreases fraud and theft <b>offending,</b> but not victimless or violent <b>offending...</b>|$|R

The results suggested that low agreeableness and low conscientiousness were independently related to the prevalence of self-reported <b>offending</b> for males and that low agreeableness was independently related to frequent male <b>offending.</b> Low conscientiousness was independently related to female <b>offending,</b> but so too were interactions between disrupted family and extraversion and disrupted family and openness.

Journal of Quantitative Criminology, 1 - 28. ObjectivesThis article {{examines}} the timing of change in criminal <b>offending</b> relative to entrance into parenthood, in light of four competing theoretical frameworks (social control, routine activities, strain and cognitive transformation). Moreover, it analyzes whether criminal developments over time are gender- or country-specific. MethodsUsing samples {{of men and women}} at risk of <b>offending</b> in the Netherlands and Norway, this study investigates monthly changes in <b>offending</b> probabilities around the time of first birth (5 years before, 5 years after). The implemented smoothing splines technique allowed for a flexible exploration of changes in <b>offending</b> probabilities for both pre-childbirth and post-childbirth periods. ResultsThe results show that the probabilities to <b>offend</b> decline ahead of childbirth for all individuals analyzed. The post-childbirth period is characterized by increases in <b>offending</b> probabilities. However, in these overall trends, the exact timing and magnitude of change differs by gender and country of residence. ConclusionsThe results offer partial support for the cognitive transformation hypothesis because <b>offending</b> rates decline before childbirth. The post-childbirth period converges with assumptions of the strain theory (for males in particular) because <b>offending</b> probabilities increase in this period. Additional analysis investigating changes in property <b>offending</b> shows that economic strain does not explain the upward trend of the overall <b>offending</b> after childbirth...|$|R
40|$|Parental {{criminal}} <b>offending</b> is {{an established}} {{risk factor for}} <b>offending</b> among offspring, but little evidence is available indicating the impact of <b>offending</b> on early childhood functioning. We used data from a large Australian population cohort to determine associations between exposure to parental <b>offending</b> {{and a range of}} developmental outcomes at age 5 years. Multi-generation data in 66 477 children and their parents from the New South Wales Child Development Study were combined using data linkage. Logistic and multinomial regressions tested associations between any and violent <b>offending</b> histories of parents (fathers, mothers, or both parents) obtained from official records, and multiple measures of early childhood developmental functioning (social, emotional–behavioural, cognitive, communication and physical domains) obtained from the teacher-reported 2009 Australian Early Development Census. Parental <b>offending</b> conferred significantly increased risk of vulnerability on all domains, particularly the cognitive domain. Greater risk magnitudes were observed for <b>offending</b> by both parents and by mothers than by fathers, and for violent than for any <b>offending.</b> For all parental <b>offending</b> exposures, vulnerability on multiple domains (where medium to large effects were observed) was more likely than on a single domain (small to medium effects). Relationships remained significant and of comparable magnitude following adjustment for sociodemographic covariates. The effect of parental <b>offending</b> on early childhood developmental outcomes is pervasive, with the strongest effects on functioning apparent when both parents engage in violent <b>offending.</b> Supporting affected families in early childhood might mitigate both early developmental vulnerability and the propensity for later delinquency among these offspring...|$|R

The media in particular has run a number of stories claiming {{that there is a}} ‘yob culture’ and the government has responded by looking at strategies for decreasing the incidence of youth <b>offending.</b> These have ranged from tougher penalties for repeat offenders, custodial sentences and electronic tagging. Traditional work in to youth <b>offending</b> has focused on a set of factors which are deemed to signify whether youths are likely to engage in <b>offending</b> behaviour. These include low economic status, high levels of truancy and an unstable family background. What previous research has tended to ignore when drawing their conclusions is the accounts of young people whether they are <b>offending</b> or ‘at risk’ of <b>offending.</b> This paper looks at groups of youths who are deemed to be ‘at risk’ of slipping in to <b>offending</b> behaviour. The youths attended a Youth Group where many of the children are either involved in <b>offending</b> behaviour or deemed to be ‘at risk’ of <b>offending.</b> Using unstructured interviews with small groups from the centre, the talk was analysed using a discursive psychological approach.

Low cognitive empathy was strongly related to <b>offending,</b> while low affective empathy was weakly related to <b>offending.</b> The Hogan Empathy Scale and the Questionnaire Measure of Emotional Empathy produced stronger relationships with <b>offending</b> than the Interpersonal Reactivity Index. The relationship between low empathy and <b>offending</b> was relatively strong for violent offenders, but relatively weak for sex offenders.
