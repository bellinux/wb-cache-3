We can use this surface to quantify and visualize color space properties, as we demonstrate for the CIE XYZ and L*a*b* spaces, {{as well as our}} own neurophysiologically-based NPP space. We then extend the technique to compute a representative set of surface spectral reflectance functions, all contained within the volume bounded by the OCS surface, and their corresponding representations in a color space. This set of spectra can be used to generate training sets for a backpropagation algorithm computing color space transforms, for example. 1 The research reported in this paper was done while the author {{was a member of the}} SNePS Research Group at the department of Computer Science, State University of New York at Buffalo, and was supported in part by Equipment Grant No. EDUD-US- 932022 from SUN Microsystems Computer Corp [...] ...|$|E
40|$|We {{estimated}} {{the number of}} colors perceived by color normal and color-deficient observers {{when looking at the}} theoretic limits of object-color stimuli. These limits, the <b>optimal</b> <b>color</b> <b>stimuli,</b> were computed for a color normal observer and CIE standard illuminant D 65, and the resultant colors were expressed in the CIELAB and DIN 99 d color spaces. The corresponding color volumes for abnormal color vision were computed using models simulating for normal trichromatic observers the appearance for dichromats and anomalous trichomats. The number of colors perceived in each case was then computed from the color volumes enclosed by the optimal colors also known as MacAdam limits. It was estimated that dichromats perceive less than 1 % of the colors perceived by normal trichromats and that anomalous trichromats perceive 50 %– 60 % for anomalies in the medium-wavelength-sensitive and 60 %– 70 % for anomalies in the long-wavelength-sensitive cones. Complementary estimates obtained similarly for the spectral locus of monochromatic stimuli suggest less impairment for color-deficient observers, a fact that is explained by the two-dimensional nature of the locus.

In attempting to convert the ellipses to circles of equal size MacAdam encountered the non-Euclidean nature of psychophysical color space.|$|R
40|$|A {{new method}} for calculating the <b>optimal</b> <b>colors</b> of any linear input device is proposed. The {{algorithm}} searches systematically {{the two types}} of <b>optimal</b> <b>colors</b> in the R+G+B planes of the device. In this way, the loci of <b>optimal</b> <b>colors</b> associated to the input device can be plotted in its own chromaticity diagram, but also in CIE (human) color spaces. Thus, we can make a comparison in CIE color spaces of the color gamut of the linear input device relative to that of the human visual system (MacAdam limits). This algorithm has been applied to some linear input devices, fulfilling or not the Luther condition, associated or not to real digital cameras, even to animal visual systems. We have found that the color gamut of a linear input device is {{the same as that of}} the human visual system, regardless of the fulfillment or not of the Luther condition. This is a corollary derived from the definition of <b>optimal</b> <b>color,</b> because it has not got any possible physically metamers except itself, independently of the capture color space. This also implies that the shape and volume of color solid of the positive spectral reflectances depends on the color space used, and, if the input device does not fulfill the Luther condition, the metamerism of the device will work in a different way redistributing the <b>color</b> <b>stimuli.</b> But the number of the distinguishable colors can be different depending on the chromatic discrimination properties of each input device. So, this work may open new ways to compare the color gamuts, actually the number of distinguishable colors, between the human visual system and non-human input devices, above all those associated to animal visual systems, because their color metric may differ from that of the human visual system.

40|$|We {{performed}} a theoretical analysis {{based on our}} <b>optimal</b> <b>color</b> hypothesis to explain why “#TheDress” image had a different color appearance for different observers (observer-dependent perception). We then carried out an experiment {{to test the hypothesis}} derived from the aforementioned theoretical analysis. In the <b>optimal</b> <b>color</b> hypothesis, the visual system picks the <b>optimal</b> <b>color</b> distribution that provides the best fit to the luminance distribution at a scene. The peak of the best-fit <b>optimal</b> <b>color</b> distribution corresponds with the illuminant's color temperature. In the theoretical analysis, we found that as the luminance level was increased the best-fit <b>optimal</b> <b>color</b> temperature changes abruptly from high to low at a specific luminance-level. Under the dark-blue (low luminance and high color temperature) illuminant the dress should appear white/gold whereas under the bright-white (high luminance and low color temperature) illuminant the dress should appear blue/black. The observer-dependent appearances of the dress may be explained by this luminance-dependent illuminant prediction. In the experiment, we used the original dress, a chromatically inverted dress, and an achromatic dress as stimuli. The observer adjusted chromaticity and luminance of a test field drawn onto the dress image so that it appeared as a full-white surface. We found that the white/gold group estimated the illuminant to be darker and bluish and the blue/black group estimated it to be brighter and yellowish. The observer's estimated illuminant was consistent with the predicted illuminant by the <b>optimal</b> <b>color</b> theory.

40|$|A concurrent-chains {{schedule}} {{was used to}} examine how a delay to conditional discriminative stimuli affects conditioned reinforcement strength. Pigeons' key-peck responses in the initial link produced either of two terminal links according to independent variable-interval 30 -s schedules. Each terminal link involved an identical successive conditional discrimination and was segmented into three links: a delay interval (green), a <b>color</b> conditional discriminative <b>stimulus</b> (blue or red), and a line conditional discriminative stimulus (vertical or horizontal lines). Food delivery occurred 45 s after entering the terminal link with a probability of. 5, but its conditional probability (1. 0 or 0) depended on the combination of the color and the line stimuli. One of the <b>color</b> <b>stimuli</b> occurred independently of further responding, 5 s after entry into the right terminal link, but it occurred 35 s after entry into the left terminal link. One of the line stimuli occurred independently of responding 40 s after entry into either terminal link, synchronized with the offset of the <b>color</b> <b>stimulus.</b> The initial-link relative response rate for the right was consistently higher in comparison with a control condition in which the <b>color</b> <b>stimuli</b> occurred 20 s after entry into either terminal link.

Assessment of the reference images verifies the suitability of the pipeline. Evaluation of the transmittance spectra reveals differences of material- and manufacturer-specifics, which are capable of inducing considerable changes in color perception, particularly in the blue color range and mixed colors involving blue.

Retrieval of information from VSTM was associated with an event-related lateralization (ERL) with a contralateral negativity relative to the visual field from which the probed stimulus was originally encoded, suggesting a lateralized organization of VSTM. The scalp distribution of the retrieval ERL was more anterior than what is usually associated with simple maintenance activity, {{which is consistent with}} the involvement of different brain structures for these distinct visual memory mechanisms.

5000|$|The idea of <b>optimal</b> <b>colors</b> was {{introduced}} by the Baltic German Chemist Wilhelm Ostwald. Erwin Schrödinger showed in his 1919 article [...] (Theory of Pigments with Highest Luminosity) that the most-saturated colors that can be created with a given total reflectivity are generated by surfaces having either zero or full reflectance at any given wavelength, and the reflectivity spectrum must have at most two transitions between zero and full. Thus two types of [...] "optimal color" [...] spectra are possible: Either the transition goes from zero {{at both ends of}} the spectrum to one in the middle, as shown in the image at right, or it goes from one at the ends to zero in the middle. The first type produces colors that are similar to the spectral colors and follow roughly the horseshoe-shaped portion of the CIE xy chromaticity diagram, but are generally less saturated. The second type produces colors that are similar to (but generally less saturated than) the colors on the straight line in the CIE xy chromaticity diagram, leading to magenta-like colors. Schrödinger's work was further developed by David MacAdam and Siegfried Rösch. MacAdam was the first person to calculate precise coordinates of selected points on the boundary of the <b>optimal</b> <b>color</b> solid in the CIE 1931 color space for lightness levels from Y = 10 to 95 in steps of 10 units. This enabled him to draw the <b>optimal</b> <b>color</b> solid at an acceptable degree of precision. Because of his achievement, the boundary of the <b>optimal</b> <b>color</b> solid is called the MacAdam limit. On modern computers, it is possible to calculate an <b>optimal</b> <b>color</b> solid with great precision in seconds or minutes. The MacAdam limit, on which the most saturated (or [...] "optimal") colors reside, shows that colors that are near monochromatic colors can only be achieved at very low luminance levels, except for yellows, because a mixture of the wavelengths from the long straight-line portion of the spectral locus between green and red will combine to make a color very close to a monochromatic yellow.|$|R
