5|$|On {{their first}} stop ashore at St Jago in Cape Verde, Darwin {{found that a}} white band high in the {{volcanic}} rock cliffs included seashells. FitzRoy {{had given him the}} first volume of Charles Lyell's Principles of Geology, which set out uniformitarian concepts of land slowly rising <b>or</b> <b>falling</b> over immense periods, and Darwin saw things Lyell's way, theorising and thinking of writing a book on geology.|$|E
5|$|A mermaid is {{a legendary}} aquatic {{creature}} {{with the head}} and upper body of a female human and {{the tail of a}} fish. Mermaids appear in the folklore of many cultures worldwide, including the Near East, Europe, Africa and Asia. The first stories appeared in ancient Assyria, in which the goddess Atargatis transformed herself into a mermaid out of shame for accidentally killing her human lover. Mermaids are sometimes associated with perilous events such as floods, storms, shipwrecks and drownings. In other folk traditions (or sometimes within the same tradition), they can be benevolent or beneficent, bestowing boons <b>or</b> <b>falling</b> in love with humans.|$|E
5|$|According to {{generally}} accepted standards of respect, the national flag {{should never be}} dipped to any person or thing. Care {{should be taken to}} prevent the flag from touching the ground, floor or water beneath it. It should be also secured from being torn off <b>or</b> <b>falling</b> to the ground and it should not be flown outdoors during a heavy rain, blizzard or very strong wind. The flag should never be flown dirty, torn or faded. When no longer in a fit condition to be used, it should be disposed of in a dignified manner, preferably by cutting it in half so as to separate the colors and then, burning.|$|E

5|$|The {{damage caused}} to the North Tower {{destroyed}} any {{means of escape}} at the impact zone or above it. All stairwells and elevators from the 92ndfloor up were rendered impassable, trapping 1,344people. According to the Commission Report, hundreds were killed instantly by the impact; the rest were trapped and died from the subsequent fire and smoke, the eventual collapse, or (in some cases) after jumping <b>or</b> <b>falling</b> from the building. Elevator shafts channeled burning jet fuel through the building. At least one elevator shaft carried burning fuel downward, exploding on the 77thfloor, the 22ndfloor, and at street level on the West Side Lobby.|$|E
5|$|The {{levels in}} And Yet It Moves are {{designed}} such that spinning {{the world at}} certain moments is required to progress. Because the character will tear into pieces if he falls from too high a distance, the player must often spin the world such that the character can safely surmount or descend from large obstacles. Other hazards such as wild beasts, fire and boulders, <b>or</b> <b>falling</b> into the black void that borders the playing field will tear the character. However, the player has unlimited lives and will reappear at the last checkpoint he passed prior to being torn.|$|E
5|$|Paranotal {{hypothesis}}: This hypothesis {{suggests that}} the insect's wings developed from paranotal lobes, a preadaptation found in insect fossils that {{is believed to have}} assisted stabilization while hopping <b>or</b> <b>falling.</b> In favor of this hypothesis is the tendency of most insects, when startled while climbing on branches, to escape by dropping to the ground. Such lobes would have served as parachutes and enable the insect to land more softly. The theory {{suggests that the}}se lobes gradually grew larger and in a later stage developed a joint with the thorax. Even later would appear the muscles to move these crude wings. This model implies a progressive increase in the effectiveness of the wings, starting with parachuting, then gliding and finally active flight. Still, lack of substantial fossil evidence of the development of the wing joints and muscles poses a major difficulty to the theory, as does the seemingly spontaneous development of articulation and venation, and it has been largely rejected by experts in the field.|$|E

5|$|Sihanaka culture {{traditionally}} {{adhered to}} a wide variety of fady, some of which are still respected to varying degrees by more traditional families to the present day. Many of their fady in the early 1900s were documented by historian Van Gennep. The most absolute fady and the only one that was seemingly practiced by all Sihanaka was a prohibition against working in a paddy field on Tuesdays; sub-groups among the Sihanaka also practiced other taboos associated with particular days of the week, such as not leaving the house or not cleaning floor mats on certain days. A fady was placed on consumption of any new or foreign products, including Western medicines. Another common fady was a taboo against watching the rising or setting of the sun, staring at anything red, <b>or</b> <b>falling</b> asleep at sunset.|$|E
5|$|Similarly to Sonic Advance 1 and 2 before it, Advance 3 is a fast-paced 2D platformer. The player {{controls}} {{one of five}} characters {{simultaneously with}} a second one as a sidekick; alternately, a second player joins and one controls each character. The two characters run and jump {{through a series of}} seven levels, destroying robots along the way. The player collects rings in levels and boss battles as a form of health: upon being hit by an enemy or harmful obstacle, the player's rings will scatter and can be recollected. Being hit while carrying no rings, being crushed by an obstacle, <b>or</b> <b>falling</b> into a bottomless pit causes death; running out of lives incurs a game over screen.|$|E
5|$|The player kills enemies {{by firing}} daggers from their fingers. There are two firing options: {{clicking}} the left-mouse button fires a shotgun-like blast of daggers {{with a wide}} spread, and holding the mouse button down fires a precise, continuous stream of daggers. Some enemies have weak spots indicated by red crystals on their bodies. Once dead, the red crystals are dropped and can be gathered by the player to obtain attack upgrades, such as increased damage and homing daggers. The player dies when coming into physical contact with an enemy <b>or</b> <b>falling</b> off the stage. At {{the top of the}} screen, a timer displays how long the playthrough has lasted. The player's best survival time is published on a global leaderboard. Accessed via the leaderboard, replays of playthroughs can be downloaded and watched from either a first-person view or a top-down perspective.|$|E

5|$|To defeat enemies, {{the player}} can use both regular and special attacks. The latter use up Special Attack Stars; the player starts {{the game with}} three, and can gain more {{throughout}} the game, which carry over between areas. The types of attacks and stats such as attack power and agility differ depending on the character: Jack Frost's standard attack is throwing snowballs, Jack Lantern's is shooting fire balls, while Jack Skelton uses his knife. Their special attacks are, respectively, freezing all enemies for a few seconds; dealing {{a large amount of}} damage to all enemies; and defeating all enemies that are visible on the screen. As the player explores the floors, they need to avoid being attacked by enemies <b>or</b> <b>falling</b> into traps: each time this happens, the remaining time limit decreases by five seconds. If the timer reaches zero, the player reaches a game over state, although they are given the option to restart {{from the beginning of the}} current area.|$|E
5|$|E.T. is an {{adventure}} {{game in which}} players control an alien (E.T.) from a top-down perspective. The objective {{of the game is}} to collect three pieces of an interplanetary telephone. The pieces are found scattered randomly throughout various pits (also referred to as wells). The player is provided with an on-screen energy bar, which decreases when E.T. performs any actions (including moving, teleporting, <b>or</b> <b>falling</b> into a pit, as well as levitating back to the top). To prevent this, E.T. can collect Reese's Pieces, which are used to restore his energy or, when nine are collected, E.T. can call Elliott to obtain a piece of the telephone, or the player can save the candy pieces for bonus points at the end. After the three phone pieces have been collected, the player must guide E.T. to an area where he can use the phone, which allows him to call his home planet. When the call is made, E.T. must reach the spaceship in a given time limit. Once E.T. gets to the forest where his ship abandoned him and stands and waits in the designated area for the ship to come, the ship will appear on screen and take him back to his home planet. Then the game starts over, with the same difficulty level, while changing the location of the telephone pieces. The score obtained during the round is carried over to the next iteration. The game ends when the energy bar depletes. E.T. has three lives and if he dies within those three lives Elliot will come in and revive him. E.T. can get a fourth life if the player is lucky enough to find a geranium in one of the wells. It turns into a sprite from some games that Howard Scott Warshaw made, such as Raiders of the Lost Ark.|$|E
