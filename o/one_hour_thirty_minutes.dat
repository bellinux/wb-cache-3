O experimento foi conduzido em casa de vegetação na Escola Superior de Agricultura “Luiz de Queiroz”, situada no município de Piracicaba (SP). O delineamento experimental foi inteiramente aleatorizado, contendo as quatro partes da planta de ambos os horários de colheita, com um fatorial 4 x 2, com três repetições, sendo quatro partes das plantas (folhas, caule herbáceo, caule sublenhoso e inflorescências) e dois horários de colheita: 9 h 00 e 15 h 00. O óleo essencial foi extraído por hidrodestilação em aparelho tipo Clevenger modificado por uma hora e trinta minutos. Os resultados obtidos demonstram que o horário de colheita influenciou na extração de óleo essencial e as partes da planta de Ocimum basilicum L. que apresentaram o maior teor de óleo essencial foram a inflorescência e as folhas.

The patient is a woman 55 -years-age, carrying esophageal myoma of 40 mm in diameter wide, situated in the posterior wall of the lower esophagus. Indications for surgery were based mainly on {{the growth of the}} mass (6 mm when discovered 7 years previously, increased to 40 mm). Recently the patient returned suffering from pain, which could be attributed to his litiasic cholecystopaty. A small degree of low disphagia could also be observed. Radiologic imaging, direct endoscopic examination and endoscopic ultrasound showed that the mioma protruded on to the oesophagic lumen, discreetly diminishing there. A laparoscopic esophageal myomectomy was indicated at the same session of the laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Once the pneunoperitoneum was installed, five ports were placed as if for a hiatus hernia surgery. The cholecystectomy was uneventful. Next, an esophagoscopy was performed so as to determine the precise area covering the base of the tumour; at the right-lateral site. Longitudinal and circular fibres of the esophagus was severed over the lesion and the enucleation of the tumour was performed alternating the monopolar dissection, bipolar and hidrodisection. Control-endoscopy was carried out to verify mucosa integrity. Four suture points with poliglactine 3 - 0 string so as to close the musculature followed this. One suture was placed in for diminution {{of the size of the}} esophagean hiatus. Total time of intervention: two hours (30 m for the cholecystectomy and <b>one</b> <b>hour</b> and <b>thirty</b> <b>minutes</b> for the myomectomy). Postoperative period: uneventful.

40|$|Prosody has {{a crucial}} role in TV news {{speaking}} style in transmitting the message to listener. Speaking style influences prosodic structure and may characterize a distinctive mark of aperson or a social group speech. Besides, speaking style allows the speaker to attract thelistener´s attention to particular chunks of his/her announcement. The aim of this work is tostudy the rhythmic organization of Brazilian Portuguese (BP) TV news speaking style byanalyzing the evolution of the normalized duration of vowel-to-vowel units (VV units) throughout the utterances in two conditions (before and after vocal training workshops). Forthis study two students of journalism were submitted to vocal training workshops for six months. Each meeting lasted <b>one</b> <b>hour</b> and <b>thirty</b> <b>minutes.</b> The training workshops intended to improvephonoarticulatory aspects involved in TV news speaking style. The students read a specific textbefore and after the training but did not receive direct instructions as how to read the text. ThePraat Software was used to analyze the VV durations and statistic analyses were carried out. Statistical analyses of VV durations did not show differences between before and afterintervention as a whole, but showed differences in specific stretches of the utterances,particularly in phrase stress position. These differences across conditions were considered anindication of the strategies developed by the participants during the training, such as theincrease of silent pause duration and the increase of VV duration in general. The increase in VVunits duration after the training may be considered a way of speaking the news with moreemphasis. These strategies did not appear before training. Based on the results of VV timingafter training it is possible to say that the training had {{a crucial role}} in improving theprofessional-related subjects´ speaking style. Perceptual tests were carried out to exam how thestrategies used by the subjects to read the announcement would be interpreted by the listenercomparing before and after intervention. The perceptual tests suggested that listeners doperceive emphasis in after-training reading and this seems to be related not only to longer VVunits, but also to expanded fundamental frequency range. The order that the announcementswere presented had influenced the listeners´ answers...|$|R

40|$|Para se efetivar uma real inclusão, além dos aspectos políticos, estruturais e educacionais, é essencial que se considere também os aspectos subjetivos e relacionais envolvidos no processo. A desinformação e a falta de contato cotidiano de pessoas sem deficiência com pessoas com deficiência podem contribuir para a construção de preconceitos e dificuldades nas interações sociais entre ambas. A presente pesquisa descreveu concepções e atitudes sociais de crianças não-deficientes acerca da deficiência mental e da inclusão e analisou os efeitos de um programa informativo sobre elas. Participaram do estudo quarenta crianças de duas salas de primeira série de uma escola estadual de Marília-SP. Uma das salas participou como grupo controle. Todas as crianças passaram por um pré e um pós-teste, na forma de entrevistas individuais sobre o tema e de aplicação de uma escala infantil de atitudes sociais em relação à inclusão. O grupo {{experimental}} participou do programa informativo, composto por treze encontros semanais de uma hora e meia de duração cada nos quais foram discutidas as limitações e as possibilidades das pessoas com deficiência mental, o atendimento especializado, sua escolarização e aspectos familiares e sociais, utilizando estratégias lúdicas e educacionais variadas. Os dados coletados nas entrevistas foram categorizados e analisados em seu conteúdo. Com a escala, foram obtidos escores individuais. Foram realizados cálculos estatísticos para verificar a significância das diferenças entre os grupos. Os resultados indicam que o programa informativo proporcionou um maior entendimento da deficiência mental, incluindo uma visão mais realista das possíveis limitações, das habilidades de pessoas deficientes e das necessidades de apoio e transformações do meio para atender às suas necessidades. Além disso, aumentou a percepção das similaridades entre pessoas com e sem deficiência, a aceitação social do deficiente e as atitudes favoráveis à inclusão. Os resultados apontam para a necessidade de ampliação de pesquisas e intervenções sobre o tema junto à comunidade, que levem à construção de concepções mais adequadas, de atitudes e sentimentos positivos e de facilitadores à inclusão, desde a infância.

The present research describes conceptions and social attitudes of children without disabilities concerning mental retardation and inclusion, and analyzes the effects of an informative program about these aspects. The participants of this research were forty children from two the first grade classrooms in one public elementary school localized in Marília, State of São Paulo. One of the classrooms participated as a control group. Every child was submitted to a pre and a post-test in the form of individual interviews about the issue. They also participated in the application of childish scale on social attitudes in respect to the inclusion. The experimental group participated in the informative program, composed of thirteen weekly meetings of <b>one</b> <b>hour</b> and <b>thirty</b> <b>minutes</b> duration each in which it were discussed limitations and possibilities of people with mental retardation, specialized assistance, their scholarization and familiar and social aspects, utilizing a variety of ludic and educational strategies.

Statistics calculations were realized to verify the significance of the differences among groups. The results indicated that the informative program favored a higher understanding of the mental retardation, including a more realistic view of the possible limitations and abilities of people with disabilities as well as their needs of support and the environment transformation. Moreover, the perception of similarities among people with and without disabilities, social acceptance and favorable attitudes towards inclusion increased.
