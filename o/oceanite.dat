50|$|When {{the term}} <b>oceanite</b> was {{apparently}} first proposed by Antoine Lacroix, {{he used the}} term to apply only to basalts with more than 50% olivine content (an extremely rare occurrence).

40|$|S U M M A R Y. The one-atmosphere xperimental melting and {{crystallization}} {{relations of}} some basic lavas of R 6 union Island, Indian Ocean, are investigated. They comprise {{products of the}} extinct volcano Piton des Neiges and the active volcano Piton de la Fournaise. New data and interpretations are presented for the I 939 <b>oceanite</b> and its contained glass, originally described by Lacroix (I 939 a). The liquidus v. iron enrichment curves for these R 6 union lavas fall about 2 o ~ above those of the lavas of Kilauea, Hawaii. The primitive liquid reaching the surface contained about IO % MgO. THE island of R 6 union is built of lavas of two shield volcanoes, Piton des Neiges (3069 m) and Piton de la Fournaise (263 I m). The former is extinct and deeply eroded, exposing a complex of intrusions ranging from picrite to quartz syenite. The volcanic succession revealed in Piton des Neiges is of an older series dominated by olivine basalts, {{referred to as the}} <b>Oceanite</b> Series, and a younger series ranging from feldsparphyric basalts through intermediate lavas to trachytes, known as the Differentiated Series. The most recent study of the geology of this volcano is given by Upton and Wadsworth (I 966, 1967). Lacroix, in a series of contributions (I 936, x 939 a, I 939 b), has devoted attention i...|$|E
40|$|The 2007 caldera-forming {{eruption}} of Piton de la Fournaise (PdF) erupted the largest volume of magma (210 Mm 3) recorded at this volcano {{in at least}} three centuries. Major and trace element and Sr-Nd isotope data for bulk-rocks, groundmasses and olivine phenocrysts have been combined with melt inclusion data (major, trace and volatile elements) to track magma evolution over the whole eruptive sequence. We show that each eruptive phase had a distinctive geochemical and petrological signature and that caldera collapse on 5 April was preceded by a marked shift in bulk magma composition and crystal content and size. Aphyric basalt erupted {{at the beginning of the}} sequence (February 2007) had relatively high Sr isotope ratio (87 Sr/ 86 Sr = 0. 70420 - 0. 704180) and low Nd isotopic ratio (143 Nd/ 144 Nd = 0. 51285 - 0. 51286). Olivine-basalts extruded on 2 - 5 April just before caldera collapse are less enriched in radiogenic Sr (87 Sr/ 86 Sr = 0. 70412 - 0. 70416), but characterized by the same Nd isotopic composition. This magma is interpreted as a new deep input, which pressurized the shallow PdF plumbing system and triggered the 2007 activity. Post-collapse <b>oceanite</b> lavas represent the main volume of magma extruded in 2007. Their bulk-rocks and groundmasses have 87 Sr/ 86 Sr (~ 0. 70418) intermediate between those of February and 5 April, and similar to those of the March 2007 and 2001 - 2006 lavas. We show that the Steady State Basalts (SSB) commonly erupted at PdF are hybrid melts, which result from multistep mixing between 'alkaline' and 'transitional' end-members. Our results lead us to propose a new model of the PdF plumbing system to reconcile the petrological, geochemical and geophysical observations: (1) the shallow portion (above sea level) of the PdF plumbing system hosts several small sills, in which magma experiences variable degrees of degassing, cooling and crystallization; (2) <b>oceanite</b> lavas result from the withdrawal of shallow harrisitic mushes stored at low pressures (< 48 MPa; < 1800 - 2400 m depth) below both the volcano summit and its eastern flank; (3) water degassing plays a major role in fast magma crystallization at shallow depths. Multistep ascent and periodic extrusion of the shallow magmas is promoted by injections of deeper and hotter basaltic magma, containing up to 1. 3 wt % H 2 O and 1630 ppm S. In 2007, the new deep input was the ultimate source of the large excess in sulfur degassing detected by satellites. Lateral draining and intrusion of magma below the eastern flank of the volcano are the cause of major volcano deformation, flank sliding and summit caldera collapse. © The Author 2014.

40|$|International audienceSince {{the middle}} of the 20 th century, {{improvement}} in volcano monitoring techniques has provided large data sets {{that can be used to}} evaluate the evolution of magma plumbing systems. At Piton de La Fournaise volcano, abundant eruptive activity and a dense monitoring network are especially conducive to such research. Analysis of the extensive set of geophysical and geochemical data associated with the last 35  years of activity provides new insights into magma transport and storage at Piton de La Fournaise. Two periods of frequent eruptions separated by 6  years of inactivity can be distinguished: 1972 – 1992 and 1998 – 2007. Considering these two periods, we show evidence of major changes in the shallow plumbing system in 2000. During 1972 – 1992 and 1998 – 2000, lava compositions and weak long term eruptive precursors (lasting few days to three weeks), characterized by no significant summit inflation and about ten volcano-tectonic earthquakes per day, suggest that eruptions were fed by the progressive drainage of an occasionally recharged shallow magma reservoir. Geophysical evidence of shallow magma reservoir recharge was only recorded in 1986 and 1998. In contrast, from 2000 to 2007, geophysical data highlight the appearance of long-term precursors (1 to 5  months of summit inflation and strong seismicity, up to one hundred events per day) preceding cycles of successive eruptions. Each cycle of eruptions was characterized by a sequence (3 to 10  months in duration) of summit and near-summit, proximal, eruptions, and ended with a distal, low-altitude <b>oceanite</b> (olivine abundances > 20  vol. %) eruption on the eastern flank of the volcano. Within each of these eruptive cycles, lavas became progressively more magnesian over time. The preferential motion of the eastern flank caused by continuous recharging of the shallow reservoir since 2000 would favour the occurrence of distal eruptions towards this flank at the end of a cycle...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePiton de la Fournaise (La Réunion Island) {{is a very}} active, {{primarily}} effusive ocean-island volcano. The Bellecombe Tephra represents {{at least}} three explosive eruptions that occurred between about 5465 and 2971 calendar years BP. Near {{the margin of the}} present-day Enclos Fouqué caldera margin, two Bellecombe eruptions produced a sequence of two tuff breccias interbedded with tuff. The tuff breccias only reach a few hundred meters outside the current caldera margin. At Petite Carrière, an old scoria cone ~ 1 km from the Enclos Fouqué margin, these two deposits (the Blower Bellecombe Tephra^) are represented by two tuffs with incipient soil formation at the top of each. They are overlain by a third unit (the upper Bellecombe Tephra) made of bedded lapilli tuff and tuff, some reworked in small debris flows off the scoria cone. The lapilli increase in size and the beds in thickness southeastward, toward Chisny volcano and away from the Enclos Fouqué caldera. Deposits from the upper Bellecombe tephra are correlated to sites 5 km northwest of Petite Carrière and 6 km north of a postulated vent location {{on the north side of}} Chisny volcano. Distribution patterns of all Bellecombe tephra are consistent with eruption columns that did not rise above 8 km asl. The ash fraction of the Bellecombe Tephra contains three juvenile components: a dominant gray vitric basaltic ash, an oceanitic (olivine-rich basalt) ash, and pyroxene-bearing gabbro with a few percent glass. It also contains doubly terminated clear quartz grains, and olivine and rarer clinopyroxene crystals. The lower Bellecombe Tephra contains an altered brown ash, whereas a tan-yellow clay-rich ash is common in the upper unit. Lava flows of gray aphyric basalt and <b>oceanite</b> are exposed at the surface and preceded the Bellecombe eruptions, but the gab-bro, quartz crystals, and hydrothermally altered grains indicate the involvement of the magma/hydrothermal system from 0. 5 -to 2 -km depth. We propose that the three eruptions of the Bellecombe tephra were preceded by voluminous eruptions of lava flows that led to seaward-sliding mass movement of the volcano. This opened fractures that explosively depressurized the hydrothermal system and incorporated magma and gabbro, from the magma system and probably from rock along the fissure, in the ejecta. This model is consistent with the small erupted volume (150 Mm 3 for the lower two combined and about the same for the upper tephra) and presence of components from a variety of depths. If the eruption had excavated downward, more surficial components would be expected. Instead, the fissures allowed material from many depths to erupt simultaneously. Similar eruptions may occur after voluminous eruptions and/or when lateral seaward sliding of the volcano occurs...|$|E
