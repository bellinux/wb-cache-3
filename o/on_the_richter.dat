5|$|Grand Canyon {{lies on the}} {{southern}} end of the Intermountain West seismic belt. At least 35 earthquakes larger than 3.0 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Richter</b> Scale occurred in the Grand Canyon region in the 20th century. Of these, five registered over 5.0 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Richter</b> Scale and the largest was a 6.2 quake that occurred in January 1906. Major roughly north—south trending faults that cross the canyon are (from west to east), the Grand Wash, Hurricane and Toroweap. Major northeast-trending fracture systems of normal faults that intersect the canyon include the West Kaibab and Bright Angel while northwest-trending systems include the Grandview—Phantom. Most earthquakes in the region occur in a narrow northwest-trending band between the Mesa Butte and West Kaibab fracture systems. These events are probably the result of eastward-migrating crustal stretching that may eventually move past the Grand Canyon area.|$|E

5|$|Before the Nazko {{earthquake}} swarm began in 2007, the Anahim hotspot {{was not known}} to be an earthquake zone. On October 10 of the following year, a swarm of earthquakes occurred.

5|$|Striking the Autonomous Region of Azores on 1 January, the 1980 Azores Island {{earthquake}} killed 61 {{people and}} injured over 400, causing severe {{damage on the}} islands of Terceira and São Jorge.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{behind this}} work were to study postural stability in an earthquake-simulated environment and {{to investigate whether}} human postural control in withstanding the impact of earthquake tremors could be proven to be cognitively learned and retained over long stretches of time. Thus, an earthquake simulator was designed and developed to reproduce seismic activities compliant with <b>the</b> <b>Richter</b> magnitude and <b>the</b> Mercalli intensity scales. A commercial biopotential data-acquisition system was also {{used to measure the}} head acceleration and collect dynamic electromyographic data from lower extremity muscles. Ten abled-adult volunteers participated in the study. Each participant underwent three test trials which spanned over one week. Every trial was comprised of 10 stages, beginning with quiet standing and followed by increasing simulated earthquake magnitudes from 4. 5 to 6. 5 degrees <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Richter's</b> scale. Data analysis revealed notable increase in lower extremity muscular activity and head acceleration in the control of postural stability. In addition, the repeated trials showed statistically significant reductions in the recorded data suggesting an adaptive and retained learning about the perturbed environment. The study outcomes could be useful in determining the threshold of falling within different subject populations during an earthquake. The earthquake simulator, as well, could be used in schools, rehabilitation centers, and other community public service locations, found on seismic belts, to train individuals who are at risk of falling durin...|$|R
5|$|Multiple {{theories}} {{explaining the}} origin of this lake have been formulated. One version is that it is the remnants of a post-glacial lake, which has undergone drastic changes in size over the years and the other theory is that it is of fluvial origin from an old flood spill channel or ox-bows of the Jhelum River. The dendritic drainage pattern of the catchment signifies that its rock strata have low levels of porosity. Lithologically, a variety of rock types have been discerned namely, igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary. The Dachigam Telbal Nallah system is conjectured to follow two major lineaments. Discontinuous surfaces seen in the terrain are attributed to the angular and parallel drainage pattern. The water table cuts the hill slopes, which is evidenced by the occurrence of numerous springs in the valley. Seismic activity in the valley is recorded under Zone V of the Seismic Zoning Map of India, the most severe zone where frequent damaging earthquakes of intensity IX could be expected. In the year 2005, Kashmir valley experienced one of the severe earthquakes measured at 7.6 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Richter's</b> scale, which resulted in deaths and the destruction of many properties, leaving many homeless.|$|R
25|$|Present-day {{earthquakes}} {{range from}} barely perceptible tremors to major movements measuring five or higher <b>on</b> <b>the</b> open-ended <b>Richter</b> scale. Turkey's most severe earthquake {{in the twentieth}} century occurred in Erzincan <b>on</b> <b>the</b> night of December 28–29, 1939; it devastated most of the city and caused an estimated 160,000 deaths. Earthquakes of moderate intensity often continue with sporadic aftershocks over periods of several days or even weeks.

5|$|The 1916 Irondale {{earthquake}} struck north–central Alabama on October 18.

Damage, limited to Shelby and Jefferson counties, reached its maximum severity near the epicenter {{in the city of}} Irondale, including cracked windows, fallen chimneys, and dried-up wells. While there were no fatalities, the earthquake spawned widespread panic, sending alarmed workers from tall buildings.|$|E
5|$|The 2007–2008 Nazko {{earthquakes}} were {{a series}} of small volcanic earthquakes measuring less than 4.0 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Richter</b> magnitude scale. They took place in the sparsely populated Nazko area of the Central Interior of British Columbia, Canada starting on October 9, 2007 and ending on June 12, 2008. They occurred just west of Nazko Cone, a small tree-covered cinder cone that last erupted about 7,200 years ago.|$|E

40|$|From a {{time when}} electoral shifts in The Netherlands were minor tremors hardly detect-able to other than the {{political}} seismologists, elections now produce changes of greater force <b>on</b> <b>the</b> political <b>Richter</b> scale, easily noticeable by even the most casual observer.

5000|$|In May, the United Nations World {{magazine}} {{carried a}} short article by Hans Thirring, {{the director of}} the Institute for Theoretical Physics in Vienna, and well known author on nuclear matters.

[...] When Thirring heard the announcement, he had gone searching for anyone that knew him from before he arrived in Argentina.

5|$|Before the Rove sediments {{were laid}} down, during the Archean Eon, the Algoman orogeny added landmass along a border from South Dakota to the Lake Huron region; this {{boundary}} is the Great Lakes tectonic zone. Several million years later {{a thin layer}} of hypervelocity impact ejecta from the Sudbury impact event was deposited on the older, underlying, Gunflint Iron Formation, and the Rove was then deposited on top of the ejecta; it is estimated that at ground zero the earthquake generated by the meteor impact would have registered 10.2 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Richter</b> scale.|$|E
5|$|In early 1960, Eisenhower {{indicated}} {{his support}} for a comprehensive test ban conditional on proper monitoring of underground tests.

Underground tests measuring more than 4.75 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Richter</b> scale would also be barred, subject to revision as research on detection continued. Adopting Macmillan's quota compromise, the US proposed each nuclear state be subject to roughly 20 on-site inspections per year (the precise figure based on the frequency of seismic events).|$|E
5|$|In {{the middle}} of the Meiji period, Gifu was officially {{established}} as a city on July 1, 1889, with an original population of 25,750 people and an area of 10km². On October 28, 1891, two years later, the Mino–Owari earthquake occurred, estimated at 8 magnitude <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Richter</b> Scale. About 37% of the city was lost to fire, resulting in 1,505 casualties (245 dead, 1,260 injured) and 6,336 buildings affected (3,993 of which were completely destroyed). As a result, Gifu erected the first Earthquake Memorial Hall in all of Japan, which holds memorial services for the victims on the 28th of every month.|$|E

Mumbai sits on a seismically active zone owing to the presence of 23 fault lines in the vicinity.
