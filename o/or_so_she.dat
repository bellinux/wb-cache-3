25|$|James {{reports that}} Kent fought {{for almost two}} hours and that Rivington {{was killed by a}} shot to the head as the French boarded. He states that Kents {{armament}} consisted of twenty 12-pounders, and six 6-pounders on her castles, and that Confiances armament consisted of 20-22 long 8-pounder guns. He speculates that if Kent had carried 18 or 24-pounder carronades instead of the long 6-pounders, she {{might have been able to}} use grapeshot to deter boarding. He further reports that in addition to her crew of 100 <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> <b>she</b> had some 38 male and three female passengers, including seven or eight passengers that she had picked up at St. Salvador, after a fire there had destroyed the Indiaman Queen on 9 July. Apparently some four or five passengers were among the British dead, and there were also passengers among the wounded. James attributes the crew being overwhelmed by the boarders to a shortage of swords, pikes and pistols.|$|E
500|$|Barclay and Co. sailed Prince of Wales {{between the}} West Indies and London, and {{particularly}} Martinique and London, from 1797 to 1800. They then sold her to Fairbridge & Co. Under {{the command of}} Captain [...] "Farbidge", she sailed between London and the Mediterranean between 1801 and 1805. In 1806 Prince of Wales received a large repair and new deck and sides. Fairbridge also rearmed her with six 6-pounder guns. From 1805 <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> <b>she</b> was {{under the command of}} Captain Stoker, who then sailed in the London-St Vincent trade. She was still listed as sailing in 1810.|$|E
500|$|Bayan was {{assigned}} to the First Pacific Squadron after completion, and based at Port Arthur from the end of 1903. She suffered minor damage during the Battle of Port Arthur {{at the beginning of the}} Russo-Japanese War and participated in the action of 13 April 1904, when Vice Admiral Tōgō Heihachirō successfully lured out a portion of the Pacific Squadron, including Vice Admiral Stepan Makarov's flagship, the battleship [...] When Makarov spotted the five Japanese battleships, he turned back for Port Arthur, and Petropavlovsk struck a minefield and quickly sank after a mine detonated one of her magazines. After bombarding Imperial Japanese Army positions on 27 July, Bayan struck a mine and was under repair for the next month <b>or</b> <b>so.</b> <b>She</b> was subsequently trapped in Port Arthur and sunk at her mooring by Japanese howitzer shells on 8 December.|$|E

500|$|Rolling Stone writer Caryn Ganz {{disliked the}} two {{original}} ballads, [...] "Christmas Time Is In the Air Again" [...] and [...] "One Child", describing them [...] "both thick with gooey orchestration", but praised [...] "Oh Santa!" [...] and [...] "When Christmas Comes" [...] for their uptempo melodies. However, she was {{confused by the}} re-recording of [...] "All I Want for Christmas Is You", saying that [...] "It's {{hard to figure out}} what's 'extra festive, and quipped that it is [...] "far easier to determine what's wrong with 'Auld Lang Syne' (an awkward dance beat)". Ganz concluded with [...] "the LP's warm heart is in the right place." [...] Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine gave the album {{two and a half stars}} our of five, writing [...] "Everything about Carey’s sequel to 1994’s buoyant, if, in retrospect, safe, Merry Christmas is as desperate and habitual as it is reassuringly predictable." [...] While he continued to label it as an [...] "incredibly adventureless album," [...] he also wrote that it is a [...] "remarkably comforting listen". He felt that Merry Christmas II You was not a sequel, or a remake, but rather an attempt at rewinding time on Carey's part. Rich Juzwiak of The Village Voice was critical of Merry Christmas II You. He described [...] "One Child" [...] as a [...] "needless retelling", [...] "Oh Santa!" [...] as trying too hard and too difficult to sing along to and [...] "All I Want for Christmas Is You (Extra Festive)" [...] as a desperate attempt at Carey canonising herself for re-recording her own song. [...] "The near-crazed desperation to please listeners for her own sake is all over Merry Christmas II You: A [...] "gift" [...] to her fans (<b>or</b> <b>so</b> <b>she</b> claims) that they, of course, must pay for, it's her fascinating, career-long saga of self-obsession in a nutshell." ...|$|E
500|$|In February 2003, Case {{temporarily}} {{exited the}} show {{as a result of}} lengthy contract negotiations. Instead of having the character depart permanently (or be killed off), executive producer David Shaughnessy chose to have her leave town after issues with her marriage to Nick. While away, Sharon becomes suicidal; Case explained that Sharon's life had fallen apart and she left town to commit suicide, drinking herself into [...] "a complete stupor". Travelling to Denver, she meets (and has an affair with) businessman Cameron Kirsten (Linden Ashby), who physically abuses her. In April, Case signed a new contract with the show. Executive producer and head writer at the time John F. Smith said that upon Sharon's return to Genoa City, she wants to keep where she was a secret. That December, Sharon is horrified when Cameron arrives in town for apparent business with Newman Enterprises. Smith stated that the story with Cameron and Sharon would be one that [...] "builds quickly into a lot of drama". Explaining their relationship, Ashby revealed that Cameron and Sharon were [...] "kindred spirits" [...] and hooked up, but Cameron becomes abusive, with Ashby calling him [...] "really disturbing". Cameron blackmails Sharon into meeting him at a motel. When she arrives they have a physical altercation in which Sharon throws a bottle at him to keep him from raping her, [...] "killing" [...] him (<b>or</b> <b>so</b> <b>she</b> believes). Australian magazine TV Soap noted that [...] "sweet, demure" [...] Sharon had become a murderer. After driving around with his body in her car trunk for days, she dumps it in an alley. Sharon's former friend, Grace, returns to town; she discovers Cameron alive, and nurses him back to health. Detective Weber (Sherman Augustus) is suspicious of Sharon's involvement in Cameron's disappearance. Sharon begins [...] "hallucinating" [...] with visions of Cameron's [...] "ghost" [...] (which is actually him, alive). Case noted that Sharon was getting into deeper trouble by making mistakes [...] "trying to do the right thing".|$|E

2500|$|Following this victory, Volage came briefly {{under the}} command of Arthur Bingham in February 1812, <b>or</b> <b>so.</b> <b>She</b> then was sent to the East Indies under Captain Donald Hugh Mackay. She was {{carrying}} Sir Evan Nepean, who was taking up his post as governor in Bombay, and escorting three cartel ships. On the way she arrived at the Cape of Good Hope on 24 June. She then served under the orders of Sir Samuel Hood in the Eastern Archipelago and the China seas. In June 1813, Volage was {{under the command}} of Captain Samuel Leslie when her sailors took part in the capture of the pirate settlement at Sambas, in Borneo. There they helped capture five batteries, one after another, in half an hour. [...] Then in September Volage participated [...] in the operations in support of the restoration of the Sultan of Palembang. Leslie left Volage on 1 January 1814. Then for while she came {{under the command of}} her first lieutenant (acting captain) John Allen.|$|E
2500|$|Despite Clare {{showing a}} more [...] "vulnerable" [...] {{side in the}} weeks prior to her departure, in episodes that aired in July 2008, Bradley {{discovered}} her original plan to manipulate money from himself and other men in Walford, and subsequently shunned her, leaving Clare [...] "feeling isolated and unwanted by her closest friends and family". Bissix has discussed her character's departure and the [...] "softer side" [...] to Clare that emerged: [...] "she does genuinely care for [...] When he turns against her, {{it turns into a}} bit of a drunken mission for her and she wrecks Dot's house. When Dot comes back, she finds her {{in a bit of a}} state and hands her a Christianity leaflet. [...] actually sits and tries to pray". Kris Green from Digital Spy has suggested that the programme [...] "only really ever scratched the surface with [...] " [...] and that there was still a lot that was undiscovered about the character, which Bissix has agreed with. She comments, [...] "This isn't a closed chapter. At the end of the day, she's been outed off the Square and with the character she is, she doesn't even know what's going on in her own head. Someone like Clare doesn't stick around Walford unless there's a reason. I like to believe in what I do and believe in my characters. I'm not going to stay in a job for no reason. Clare would definitely leave in this situation." [...] After one last [...] "huge row" [...] with Bradley and realising that she had no friends in Walford, Clare decided to leave, making her exit in an hour-long episode that aired on 7 August 2008. Discussing her exit, Bissix said, [...] "I leave Albert Square in the back of a Black Cab, of course! Which is how I left with Nigel 10 years ago so it feels kind of right. It’s better than going out in a [...] isn’t it? I don’t want to be killed off!" [...] She also revealed that she is hoping Clare Bates will return to EastEnders again one day, commenting, [...] "I don’t think it’s the end of Clare. I’m sure she’ll be back to cause trouble at some point." [...] In 2009, Bissix added that producers told her when she left in August 2008 that they were thinking of bringing her character back in a year <b>or</b> <b>so.</b> <b>She</b> added, [...] "but it's one of those things. I'll just have to wait and see." ...|$|E

500|$|When The September Issue was {{released}} three years later, critics compared {{it with the}} earlier, fictional film. [...] "For the past year <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> <b>she's</b> been on the media warpath to win back her image," [...] said Paul Schrodt in Slant Magazine. Many considered {{the question of how}} similar she was to Streep's Priestly, and praised the film for showing the real person. Manohla Dargis at The New York Times said that Priestly had helped humanise Wintour, and [...] "the documentary continues this."
