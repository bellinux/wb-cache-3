5|$|Andrei and Daniil {{are working}} on the {{decoration}} of a church in Vladimir. Although they have been there for several months the walls are still white and bare as Andrei is doubting himself. A messenger arrives with word from the furious Bishop to say they have until the Autumn to finish the job. On a nearby road {{in the middle of a}} field of flowers Andrei confides to Daniil that the task disgusts him and that he is unable to paint a subject such as the Last Judgement as he doesnâ€™t want to terrify people into submission. He comes to the conclusion that he has lost the ease of mind that an artist needs for his work. Foma, impatient and ambitious, resigns and leaves Andrei's group to take up the offer of painting a smaller, less prestigious, church. Stone carvers and decorators of Andrei's party have also been working on the Grand Prince's mansion. The Prince wants the work to be done again more in line with his tastes but the workers already have another job, at the mansion of the Grand Prince's brother, and refuse. On a path through the woods soldiers accost the artisans on the orders of the Grand Prince and gouge their eyes out, so that they cannot replicate their work. Back at the church Andrei is dismayed by the news of their fate and angrily throws paint and smears it on one of the walls. Sergei (Vladimir Titov) one of the young apprentices who escaped the attack unharmed reads a random section of the bible aloud, at Daniil's request, concerning women. Durochka (Irma Raush) (whose name identifies her as a holy fool or Yurodivy), wanders in <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> and is upset by the sight of the paint on the wall. Her feeble-mindedness and innocence leads Andrei to the idea to paint a feast.|$|E
25|$|On August 9, 1991, just a {{month after}} being {{released}} from Bridgewater State Hospital, Bar-Jonah observed a seven-year-old boy sitting alone in a car outside of a post office in Oxford, Massachusetts. Bar-Jonah, who weighed 275 lbs {{at the time of}} the incident, entered the vehicle and sat on the boy, thrusting his mass atop the boy's fragile chest. Some witnesses, along with the boy's mother, observed the event and ran to the boy's rescue, causing Bar-Jonah to flee. An officer recognized Bar-Jonah's description from over 15 years earlier, and he was later arrested for the attack. At first, Bar-Jonah claimed that he entered the car to get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain,</b> but later admitted that he intended to kill the boy. For the attack, Bar-Jonah was sentenced to probation in Montana.|$|E
2500|$|More than a {{week after}} the death of Mr. Starks, police {{departments}} {{on both sides of the}} city were still being swamped with excited calls about prowlers and gunshots. Reports arranged from the possible to the ridiculous, yet officers diligently checked every report. On Friday, May 10, officers rushed to a home on Olive street with reports of strange noises coming from an upstairs room. Officers found a cat thrashing about in a trash can. Again on Olive street, officers checked a report that a strange man was on someone's porch. It turned out that he had stepped <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> to wait for a bus. On Magnolia street, a report of a prowler bumping up against a house turned out to be hedges being blown against it. On Sixteenth street, a family called in that they heard a tapping at their door. It was later discovered that a messenger was delivering a special letter. At one point, when white-faced calves broke loose around County Avenue and slept on lawns, frightened residents called to report [...] "white-faced things in the dark". Gunshots that were heard turned out to be someone shooting at something they thought was a prowler (usually a shadow), accidental discharges from people loading their guns, and even backfires from vehicles.|$|E

5000|$|Rain waters: Because {{almost all}} of Metairie is between two and seven feet below sea level, all rain water was {{captured}} in the Metairie [...] "bowl." [...] Unable to return for nearly two days, the pump operators could not turn the pumps on to pump <b>out</b> any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> water or backflow.|$|R
60|$|The fees were paid; {{we wrote}} our {{names in the}} books and on the certificate; the clergyman quietly wished me happiness; the clerk solemnly imitated him; the pew-opener smiled and curtseyed; Mr. Sherwin made congratulatory speeches, kissed his daughter, shook hands with me, frowned a private rebuke at his wife for {{shedding}} tears, and, finally, led the way with Margaret <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vestry. <b>The</b> <b>rain</b> was still falling, as they got into the carriage. The fog was still thickening, as I stood alone under <b>the</b> portico <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church, and tried to realise to myself that I was married.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hello!" [...] he exclaimed, as Dave hurried in <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> {{and shook}} the water from his cap. [...] "I thought {{you were one of}} our crowd." ...|$|E

60|$|Golightly {{kept his}} temper, and began {{explaining}} {{all over again}} from the beginning. Then he was marched <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> into the refreshment-room and told {{not to make a}} qualified fool of himself.|$|E
25|$|Three Test {{matches and}} seven One Day Internationals were planned. One ODI (in Guwahati) was washed <b>out</b> because <b>of</b> <b>rains.</b> <b>The</b> Test series was drawn 1-1 while India won the ODI series 5-1.|$|R
60|$|It {{was dark}} and quiet. Neither moon nor stars were visible. There was a smell like <b>rain</b> in <b>the</b> still, heavy air, and I put my hand <b>out</b> <b>of</b> window. No. <b>The</b> <b>rain</b> was only threatening, it had not come yet.|$|R
60|$|The Captain, with an abashed {{and guilty}} air, {{immediately}} walked on tiptoe {{to the little}} parlour and locked himself in. Rob, opening the door, would have parleyed with the visitor on the threshold if the visitor had come in female guise; but <b>the</b> figure being <b>of</b> <b>the</b> male sex, and Rob's orders only applying to women, Rob held {{the door open and}} allowed it to enter: which it did very quickly, glad to get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> driving <b>rain.</b>|$|R

60|$|One {{evening in}} August he came {{when it was}} raining. He came in with his jacket collar turned up, his jacket buttoned close, his face wet. And he looked so slim and definite, coming <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chill <b>rain,</b> she was {{suddenly}} blinded with love for him. Yet he sat and talked with her father and mother, meaninglessly, whilst her blood seethed to anguish in her. She wanted to touch him now, only to touch him.|$|R
50|$|In 2010, Nelson {{reached a}} record deal with Frontiers Records. They {{released}} three albums almost consecutively. The first, Before <b>the</b> <b>Rain,</b> {{is a collection}} <b>of</b> some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> demo songs that were left <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> After <b>the</b> <b>Rain</b> album. <b>The</b> second one is Perfect Storm, which is a compilation of live recordings from <b>the</b> After <b>the</b> <b>Rain</b> world tour. This is notable because, despite being such a massive world tour that covered almost 300 dates across the world, no official recording was made <b>of</b> it. <b>The</b> third album is a new studio album called Lightning Strikes Twice, which features new material from the band. It is the first original studio album from the band since Life was released in 1999.|$|R

60|$|She slept {{again and}} again looked <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> window. It <b>rained</b> a little but still there were hours in which <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> might cease. Again she slept and at eight her maid brought her word {{that there would be}} hunting. It did rain a little but very little. Of course she would dress herself in riding attire.|$|R
60|$|Between ten {{and eleven}} o'clock, finding that neither Fairway nor anybody else came to him, he retired to rest, {{and despite his}} anxieties soon fell asleep. His sleep, however, was not very sound, by reason <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{expectancy}} he had given way to, and {{he was easily awakened}} by a knocking which began at the door about an hour after. Clym arose and looked <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> window. <b>Rain</b> was still falling heavily, <b>the</b> whole expanse <b>of</b> heath before him emitting a subdued hiss under the downpour. It was too dark to see anything at all.|$|R
60|$|The captain obeyed hastily, and, {{stepping}} {{inside the}} dismantled room, stood {{for some time}} gazing <b>out</b> <b>of</b> window at <b>the</b> <b>rain.</b> Then he filled his pipe and, removing a small chair which was sitting upside down in a large one, took its place and stared disconsolately at <b>the</b> patch <b>of</b> wet floor and the general disorder.|$|R

50|$|Frederick Libby {{volunteered for}} service with the Royal Flying Corps on a thirty-day {{probationary}} period; {{he said it}} was to get in <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> constant <b>rain.</b> If he proved satisfactory as an aerial observer, he would be commissioned a second lieutenant; if unsatisfactory, he would return to his old unit without prejudice. According to Libby, when he reported to 23 Squadron, he received his machine gun training in the morning, and went on flight status that afternoon. A crack shot since his childhood, he scored his first victory on his very first combat mission, coincidentally his birthday, 15 July 1916, flying with Lieutenant E. D. Hicks.|$|R
50|$|In the Middle Ages, cisterns {{were often}} {{constructed}} in hill castles in Europe, especially where wells {{could not be}} dug deeply enough. There were two types: the tank cistern and the filter cistern. Such a filter cistern was built at the Riegersburg in Austrian Styria, where a cistern was hewn <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lava rock. <b>Rain</b> water passed through a sand filter and collected in the cistern. The filter cleaned <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> water and enriched it with minerals.|$|R
50|$|Dejected, Lauryn {{goes to a}} diner to {{down her}} sorrows, but soon finds her car towed off. Upon seeing her misfortunes, Dana (Tessa Thompson), a {{friendly}} waitress from the diner invites Lauryn to her apartment and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pouring <b>rain.</b> Dana subsequently offers Lauryn a place to stay, considering Lauryn could not go back home and face her brother. The next day, Dana brings Lauryn to a club called Ruby's (whose dances are rooted in burlesque), where she meets with Russ (Riley Smith), the slick-talking disc jockey, and Brenda (Karen LeBlanc), the club owner. Brenda hires Lauryn as a bookkeeper, in light of her skills with numbers. Lauryn watches as a dancer, Carmen (Julissa Bermudez) performs impressively on the stage.|$|R
60|$|Both boys {{returned}} to the barn, to get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain.</b> Then they sneaked to the cellar {{of the house and}} up to the kitchen, and then to a little storeroom next to the dining room. From the storeroom they could catch much of the conversation coming from the three men in the dining room.|$|E
6000|$|Golightly {{kept his}} temper, and began {{explaining}} {{all over again}} from the beginning. Then he was marched <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> into the refreshment-room and told {{not to make a}} qualified fool of himself. The men were going to run him up to Fort Govindghar. And [...] "running up" [...] is a performance almost as undignified as the Frog March.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Good evening, Mr MacGinnis,' I said. 'I'm glad to {{see your}} leg is all right again. I won't detain you a moment. Just feel in your pockets and shed a few of your guns, {{and then you can}} come in <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain.</b> To prevent any misunderstanding, I may say I have a gun of my own. It is trained on you now.' ...|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{protective}} nature <b>of</b> {{paper and}} fiberglass asphalt shingles primarily {{comes from the}} long-chain petroleum hydrocarbons, while wood shingles are protected by natural oils in the cellulose structure. Over time in the hot sun, these oils soften and when <b>rain</b> falls <b>the</b> oils are gradually washed <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shingles. During <b>rain,</b> more water is channeled along eaves and complex rooflines, and these are subsequently more prone to erosion than other areas.|$|R
50|$|On {{the distant}} planet Fluva, torrential rains that leave it barely {{habitable}} {{also make it}} {{a treasure trove of}} rare botanical specimens. When the human bio-prospector Shadrach Hasselemoga crashes in the remote and deadliest place on Fluva; the Viisiiviisii. The only crew available to search for him is the warrior Jemunu-jah, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> native Sakuntala, and the immigrant Deyzara trader and experienced pilot, Masurathoo. This culturally different and physically repulsive to each other couple promptly crash also. While the rescuers and the rescued are all slogging it <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ultimate <b>rain</b> forest, <b>the</b> reptilian AAnn empire is fomenting bloody trouble between the Sakuntula and the Deyzara. This leaves Commonwealth administrator Lauren Matthias in the hot seat, with refugees swarming in to her limited facilities and <b>the</b> bodies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> innocent piling up, with few resources to help. But it's <b>the</b> survivors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> forest who bring new knowledge that helps save Fluva, along with quick work by Matthias.|$|R
50|$|Servia {{held the}} lead until he pitted for fuel {{and a fresh}} set of slick tires on lap 34. Rain began to fall soon after. On lap 38, Ryan Dalziel and Neel Jani came <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pits on <b>rain</b> tires. It {{turned out to be}} the correct decision. Servia and Tagliani tangled at the {{slippery}} turn 3 on lap 39. Both cars were able to continue but a yellow flag was brought out. Except for Dan Clarke, <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> field pitted for <b>rain</b> tires during <b>the</b> caution.|$|R
