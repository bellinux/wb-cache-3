5|$|In 1960, Dunstan became {{president}} of the State Labor Party. The year also saw the death <b>of</b> <b>Opposition</b> Leader Mick O'Halloran and his replacement by Frank Walsh. Dunstan attempted to win both the position <b>of</b> <b>Opposition</b> Leader and, failing that, Deputy Leader. However, the Labor caucus was sceptical of his age and inexperience, and he failed to gain either position, albeit narrowly.|$|E

There is also a Leader <b>of</b> the <b>Opposition</b> in the Senate, who is usually of the same party as the Leader <b>of</b> the <b>Opposition</b> in the house.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} {{is dedicated to}} answering the question on how the content <b>of</b> <b>oppositions</b> and implementation <b>of</b> dialectical thinking operations are connected at pre-school and adult age. We say that segregation <b>of</b> <b>oppositions</b> is a basic component {{of the structure of}} dialectical thinking, the one that is extremely important at the pre-school age. This ability appears to be essential for the formation and implementation of dialectical actions. With that, once formed and rigidly fixed, for example, through some specifics of the educational environment, representation <b>of</b> <b>oppositions</b> might result in development of formal logical constructions...|$|R
40|$|The article {{embraces the}} study of {{structural}} syntactic features of undetached appositions in Modern English. The main aim of the investigation is to study role and place <b>of</b> <b>oppositions</b> in the English linguistics. The thoughts of the scholars in the study <b>of</b> <b>oppositions,</b> the determination <b>of</b> <b>oppositions</b> as to their types and functions, terms related to the oppositions are differently used by scholars. Having mentioned all these varieties in the determination of appositions, we have offered the terms undetached and detached <b>oppositions,</b> instead <b>of</b> other terms offered by other scholars. In {{the scope of the}} study consideration of the problem among the Azerbaijani-English studying scholars has taken place as well. Investigations show {{that there is not a}} unanimous determination <b>of</b> <b>oppositions</b> and usage <b>of</b> terminology related to the oppositions...|$|R

5|$|During the Torrijos presidency, Moscoso {{remained}} {{an active member}} of the opposition. In September 2007, she criticized the appointment of PRD politician Pedro Miguel González, who was wanted in the US for the murder of US Army sergeant Zak Hernández, as the head of the National Assembly. In the same year, she joined Endara and Perez Balladares in lobbying the Organization of American States to investigate the Hugo Chavez government's refusal to renew the broadcasting license <b>of</b> <b>opposition</b> station Radio Caracas Televisión Internacional in Venezuela.|$|E

According to Rajab, an order for his arrest was issued on 8 September but was cancelled on 18 October. Rajab was also subject to a travel ban during this period.|$|E

5|$|Few films {{before the}} late 1970s about the Vietnam War {{actually}} depicted combat. The exceptions included The Green Berets (1968). Critics such as Basinger explain that Hollywood avoided the subject because <b>of</b> <b>opposition</b> to United States {{involvement in the}} Vietnam War, making the subject divisive; in addition, the film industry was in crisis, and the army {{did not wish to}} assist in making anti-war films.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{where an}} MP {{of the ruling}} party vacates his or her seat, a {{counterpart}} in a neighbouring ward may take over his or her functions, thus {{eliminating the need for}} a by-election. However, this arrangement may not work if an opposition MP vacates his or her seat and no by-election is called, because of the dearth <b>of</b> <b>opposition</b> MPs in Parliament. Therefore, the voters in the opposition ward will be denied of representation until the next general election.|$|E

5|$|The NCMP {{scheme was}} {{introduced}} on 22 August 1984 by the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Act 1984 and the Parliamentary Elections (Amendment) Act 1984. Under Article 39(1)(b) of the Constitution which {{was introduced by}} the constitutional amendment Act, {{the maximum number of}} NCMPs was set at six. However, the actual number that could be declared elected at any general election was fixed at three, less the total number <b>of</b> <b>Opposition</b> MPs elected to Parliament. The President, acting on the advice of the Cabinet, could order that between four and six NCMPs be declared elected for the purpose of a particular general election. Such an order ceased to have effect at the next dissolution of Parliament. On 1 July 2010, the need for a presidential order {{to increase the number of}} NCMPs was removed. Instead, the maximum number of NCMPs in Parliament was increased from six to nine, and the actual number that would be declared elected following a general election would be nine less the number <b>of</b> <b>opposition</b> MPs elected to Parliament.|$|E
