5|$|In 1982, the ACLU became {{involved}} in a case involving the distribution <b>of</b> <b>child</b> <b>pornography</b> (New York v. Ferber). In an amicus brief, the ACLU argued that child pornography that violates the three prong obscenity test should be outlawed, but that the law in question was overly restrictive because it outlawed artistic displays and otherwise non-obscene material. The court did not adopt the ACLU's position.|$|E
5|$|In July 2013, a 21-year-old {{man from}} Virginia, whose {{computer}} coincidentally did contain pornographic photographs of underaged girls {{with whom he}} had conducted sexualized communications, turned himself in to police after receiving and being deceived by ransomware purporting to be an FBI message accusing him of possessing child pornography.

5|$|Initially Bryant {{kept her}} {{concerns}} low-key, despite her pastor's pleadings to become involved. She {{wrote a letter}} to the county commission and called Ruth Shack, expressing her concerns. Her most significant objection to the ordinance was that it would allow homosexuals to work in parochial schools; all four of Bryant's children attended a local private Christian school. She admitted she was largely ignorant of any specific dangers homosexuals presented, but when she was sent graphic images of homosexual acts, and shown photos <b>of</b> <b>child</b> <b>pornography</b> by a local police sergeant visiting her church, she was horrified. Bryant credited her inspiration later to her 9-year-old daughter suggesting God could assist with her cause; then she decided to take a more public role.|$|E
5|$|After {{arriving}} at Lukeville POE at 3 or 3:30 PM, the two agents interviewed Howard and Maureen Cotterman separately. Howard Cotterman {{offered to help}} the agents with the computer, but the offer was declined. At 6 PM, the two agents left with both laptops and one digital camera. The devices were taken to Tucson and delivered to John Owens, an ICE Computer Forensic Examiner at 11 PM that night. The camera was returned to the Cottermans as {{there was no evidence}} of contraband found. However, on April 8, Agent Owens' forensic examination turned up approximately 75 images <b>of</b> <b>child</b> <b>pornography</b> on Howard Cotterman's computer. Agent Owens called the Cottermans that night, asking Howard Cotterman for assistance opening the password protected files. Howard Cotterman agreed to come in the next day, but only his wife showed up to pick up the other laptop.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, {{the first}} federal law to ban the for-profit {{production}} and distribution <b>of</b> <b>child</b> <b>pornography</b> was the Protection of Children Against Sexual Exploitation Act of 1977. In response to New York v. Ferber, , a U.S. Supreme Court decision allowing the prohibition <b>of</b> <b>child</b> <b>pornography</b> {{even if it did}} not meet the obscenity standard established in Miller v. California, Congress passed the Child Protection Act of 1984, broadening the definition <b>of</b> <b>child</b> <b>pornography</b> and criminalizing nonprofit child pornography trafficking. The 1986 Meese Report found that child pornography was a cause of serious harm; this led to the passage of the Child Sexual Abuse and Pornography Act of 1986, which increased penalties for repeat offenders.|$|E

25|$|Child {{pornography}} is illegal and censored in most jurisdictions in the world.

25|$|The Protect Act §503 of 1992 (codified at 18 U.S.C. §2251 to 18 U.S.C. §2260) {{makes it}} a federal crime to possess or create sexually {{explicit}} images of any person under 18 years of age; this creates a federal age of consent of 18 for pornography. Thus, while some conduct covered by the statute is highly culpable, these penalties apply even when consensual sex between someone {{under the age of}} eighteen and someone over the age of eighteen is entirely legal under state law, the non-commercial possession of an explicit picture or video clip of the person under the age of eighteen (such as a cell phone photograph of a naked sexual partner, under the age of eighteen, of the person taking the photo) may still constitute a serious federal child pornography felony. The sentence for a first time offender convicted of producing child pornography under 18 U.S.C. §2251 (such as taking a suggestive cell phone picture of an otherwise legal sexual partner under the age of eighteen without an intent to share or sell the picture), face fines and a statutory minimum of 15 years to 30 years maximum in prison. While mandatory minimum offenses do not apply to mere possession <b>of</b> <b>child</b> <b>pornography,</b> it is almost always the case that a person in possession <b>of</b> <b>child</b> <b>pornography</b> is also necessarily guilty of either receipt <b>of</b> <b>child</b> <b>pornography,</b> which carries a five-year mandatory minimum sentence, or production <b>of</b> <b>child</b> <b>pornography,</b> which carries a fifteen-year mandatory minimum sentence.|$|E
