40|$|We {{explain why}} underpricing in IPOs can be large in {{magnitude}} and clustered, using a signalling model where firms have private {{information about their}} qualities (high or low). A novel feature is that a firm, if perceived by the market as high quality, benefits from the industry's publicity which is an increasing function {{of the amount of}} IPO underpricing by all high-quality firms in the industry. Despite the potential free-rider problem created by the industry's publicity, we show that a high-quality firm chooses to underprice its own IPO as the best response to other high-quality firms' underpricing. Thus, IPO underpricing is clustered. Initial public <b>offering,</b> <b>Signalling,</b> Externality, Multiple equilibria...|$|R

40|$|Time-correlated single photon {{counting}} (TCSPC) is {{a fundamental}} fluorescence lifetime measurement technique <b>offering</b> high <b>signal</b> to noise ratio (SNR).

We present a single-point digital Silicon Photomultiplier (SiPM) detector accomplishing real-time fluorescence lifetime-activated actuation targeting cell sorting applications in flow cytometry. The sensor also achieves burst-integrated fluorescence lifetime (BIFL) detection by TCSPC.

40|$|Abstract—Fluctuations {{and noise}} are {{important}} factors {{interfering with the}} operation of devices and circuits, and this effect will become stronger as feature sizes decrease. This paper presents two building blocks for Single Electron Tunneling (SET) circuits that are designed with signal fluctuations in mind. One of these blocks, a so-called Hub, outputs its signals to other building blocks by repeatedly <b>offering</b> its <b>signals</b> at its output terminals, and taking them back when they cannot be delivered. Based on a random scheme of signaling, the Hub requires fluctuations to drive its operation. The other building block, a Conservative Join, is designed to work {{in cooperation with the}} Hub, though it does not require fluctuations. We propose SET circuit topologies for both blocks, and analyze their behavior at a temperature of 1 K by computer simulations with SIMON 2. 0. The two very different modes of operation in the blocks—fluctuation vs. non-fluctuating—can be accommodated by appropriately tuning circuit parameters, as we show. Utilizing these proposed topologies we then present an example of a network constructed using the two building blocks. I...|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} a new {{design for a}} split Hopkinson tensile bar (SHTB) as well as generated representative experimental results. The new design uses a U shaped striker bar as projectile and addresses several shortcomings of classical SHTB designs using hollow striker bars. The results presented show that the non-symmetrical striker bar is capable of generating a clean and virtually oscillation free square pulse signal five times longer than typically achieved by classical striker tubes, whilst {{at the same time}} <b>offering</b> superior <b>signal</b> quality. Due to the longer stress pulse duration, the new SHTB design allows for the characterisation of materials at strain rates that were difficult to achieve for hydraulic testing machines and classical striker tube based SHTB designs. In addition, the developed SHTB is based on a simple and modular design and allows {{for a wide range of}} pulse shaping methodologies to be applied. Therefore, materials requiring different input stress pulse shapes, such as square (ductile), trapezoid or triangular (brittle), can be experimentally characterised at a large range of strain rates. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The fact that anticipated organizational support only partially mediates the relationship indicates that there may be additional channels how FWPs affect organizational attractiveness beyond anticipated organizational support.

30|$|Another {{important}} delineation in {{the concept}} of economic resilience, and resilience in general, is the distinction between inherent and adaptive resilience (Tierney 2007; Cutter 2016). Inherent resilience refers to resilience capacity already built into the system or that can be “pre-positioned in advance of the disaster, such as the ability to utilize more than one fuel in an electricity generating unit, the workings of the market system in <b>offering</b> price <b>signals</b> to identify scarcity and value, and established government policy levers. Adaptive resilience is exemplified by actions devised after the disaster strikes, such as undertaking conservation that was not previously thought possible, changing technology, devising market mechanisms where they might not have previously existed (for example, reliability premiums for electricity or water delivery), or devising new government post-disaster assistance programs. It is important to realize that a good amount of resilience is already embodied in the economy at various levels (for example, a firm’s ability to substitute inputs, market signals for reallocating resources), and that policies should be designed to capitalize rather than obstruct or duplicate this capacity. At the same time, policy should also be geared to rewarding both types of resilience.|$|R

Their response was characterized using ultra high-speed imaging. Although there was considerable variability across the population, good agreement was found between the experimental results and theoretical predictions in terms of the frequency and amplitude of microbubble oscillation following pulsed excitation.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this letter is to test the competing predictions of the Heinkel and Schwartz model, in which a higher subscription in a Common Stock Rights <b>Offering</b> price <b>signals</b> a higher quality firm, and the Myers and Majluf model in which the firm sets a low subscription price {{in order to secure}} the financing for a positive NPV project from the firm's existing stockholders. For a sample of 105 public utilities, the two-day offering period cumulative abnormal return, the dependent variable, is estimated using standard event study methodology. The independent variable is the relative subscription price, defined as the ratio of the subscription price to the mean of closing prices of the five trading days immediately preceding the two-day offering period. The results indicate that there are public utilities whose financing decision complies with the predictions of the Heinkel and Schwartz model and others whose financing activity acts according to the predictions of the Myers and Majluf model. Finally, the explanatory power of either model is generally minimal pointing towards the presence of other factors, in addition to securing the financing of a project and signalling the quality of the firm, that determine the subscription price in a common stock rights offering. ...|$|R
