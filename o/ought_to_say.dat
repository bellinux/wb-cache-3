No living person possesses a tithe of his information respecting the Hudson's Bay countries... Never mind his Bunyan-like face and cropped hair; {{he has a very}} powerful mind, and a singular faculty of picture-making. He can create a wilderness and people it with warring savages, or climb the Rocky Mountains with you in a snow-storm, so clearly and palpably, that only shut your eyes and you hear the crack of the rifle, or feel the snow-flakes melt on your cheeks as he talks.|$|E
500|$|Not all reviewers were enthusiastic. Some {{lamented the}} use of poor white Southerners, and {{one-dimensional}} black victims, and Granville Hicks labeled the book [...] "melodramatic and contrived". When the book was first released, Southern writer Flannery O'Connor commented, [...] "I think for a child's book it does all right. It's interesting that all the folks that are buying it don't know they're reading a child's book. Somebody <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> what it is." [...] Carson McCullers apparently agreed with the Time magazine review, writing to a cousin: [...] "Well, honey, one thing {{we know is that}} she's been poaching on my literary preserves." ...|$|E
500|$|A third Dooley collection, Mr. Dooley's Philosophy, {{appeared}} in 1900. The lead story was [...] "A Book Review", that is, Mr. Dooley's discussion of New York Governor Theodore Roosevelt's wartime memoir, The Rough Riders. In Mr. Dooley's version, Roosevelt wins the whole war by himself, a role slightly {{greater than that}} in his actual book. Dooley's conclusion: [...] "No man that bears a grudge against himself'll ever be governor of a state. [...] And if Teddy done it all he <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> so and relieve the suspense. [...] But if I were him I'd call the book Alone in Cuba." [...] Somewhat to Dunne's surprise, [...] "Rosenfelt" [...] (as Dooley called him) took the sting in good humor, and when the two met, told Dunne of a young female admirer of his, who told the governor that she had read all of his books, with her favorite Alone in Cuba. Roosevelt was elected vice president on McKinley's ticket in 1900, and when he succeeded after the president was assassinated the following year, Dunne wrote of the new chief executive, the youngest to hold that position, [...] "a man is... {{old enough to be}} president when he becomes president. If he ain't, it'll age him." ...|$|E

500|$|The book {{generally}} received positive reception from literature critics. Publishers Weekly {{described it}} as [...] "golden SF from the Golden Age", and The Harvard Crimson called it [...] "one of the great classics" [...] of the Golden Age of Science Fiction. A reviewer writing in Publishers Weekly commented: [...] "Hubbard brilliantly evokes the vastness of space and the tragedy {{of those who would}} conquer it", and called the book [...] "one of his [...] finest works". Alan Cheuse reviewed the book in the San Francisco Chronicle, writing: [...] "As in a number of groundbreaking -- or time-breaking, I suppose we <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> -- works of science fiction, the science behind the story is more interesting than the fiction itself. Hubbard is a thinker who writes, rather than a writer who thinks, as most masters are." [...] Cheuse highlighted the book among his 2004 literature holiday picks in a piece for National Public Radio's program All Things Considered: [...] "Before he began founding new religions, Hubbard was one of the country's most prolific pulp science fiction writers, and this book is one of his best." [...] Georges T. Dodds, columnist for WARP, newsletter/fanzine of the Montreal Science Fiction and Fantasy association writes [...] "besides being among the earliest hard science fiction works to consider time-dilation effects in long distance near-light-speed space travel, (To The Stars) is a pretty entertaining story." ...|$|E
2500|$|It is not {{accurate}} to say that originalism rejects change or that originalists necessarily oppose the use of [...] "the evolving standards of decency" [...] in determining what the Constitution ought to say; rather, originalism rejects the concept that the courts should consider what the Constitution <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> but instead rule solely on what it said as understood {{at the time of its}} enactment. Originalists argue that the business of determining what the Constitution and the law <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> is within the purview of the Congress, that changes to the law should come through the legislature, and changes to the constitution should be made per the amendment process outlined in Article V. Sometimes this approach yields results that please conservatives (see, for example, Justice Scalia's dissents in Roper v. Simmons or Romer), and sometimes it yields results that do not (see, for example, Justice Scalia's dissents in BMW v. Gore or Hamdi v. Rumsfeld).|$|E

[...] A complete proof taking possible ties into account is not essentially {{different from the}} one given here, except that one <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> [...] "not above" [...] instead of [...] "below" [...] or [...] "not below" [...] instead of [...] "above" [...] in some cases.

2500|$|In 1999, in a Republican {{presidential debate}} at Dartmouth College, McCain opposed {{the legalization of}} marijuana. He said, [...] "We’re losing the war on drugs. We <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> 'It’s not a war anymore,' or we really ought to go after it. And {{there was a time}} in our history when we weren’t always losing the war on drugs. It was when Nancy Reagan had a very simple program called 'Just Say No.' And young Americans were {{reducing}} the usage of drugs in America." [...] At the debate, McCain called marijuana a [...] "gateway drug".|$|E
2500|$|Southey's {{contemporary}} James Losh {{believed that}} the poem was [...] "superior to anything before written by Southey". A letter from Charles Lamb to Southey dated 6 May 1815 said, [...] "I have, since the receipt of your present, read it quite through again, and with no diminished pleasure. I don't know whether I <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that it has given me more pleasure than any of your long poems. Kehama is doubtless more powerful, but I don't feel that firm footing in it that I do in Roderick". An anonymous review in the December 1814 Theatrical Inquisitor argued, [...] "It is scarcely possible to view the errors of exalted genius without breathing a sigh of compassion and regret. The generous mind feels humiliated at the contemplation [...] Such are the feelings that must be excited by the reader of Southey's poems [...] The story of the present poem is interesting, and would probably have made an excellent romance. It has, however, several capital defects, that make it altogether unfit for an heroic poem".|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, the 50th {{anniversary of}} Buechner's ordination, Rich Barlowe wrote of Buechner in the Boston Globe, [...] "Who knows? The words are Frederick Buechner's mantra. Over {{the course of}} an hourlong chat with the writer and Presbyterian {{minister}} in his kitchen, they recur any number of times in response to questions about his faith and theology. Dogmatic religious believers would dismiss the two words as the warning shot of doubt. But for Buechner, it is precisely our doubts and struggles that mark us as human. And that insight girds his theological twist on Socrates: The unexamined human life is a lost chance to behold the divine." [...] In 2002, Richard Kauffman interviewed Buechner for The Christian Century upon the publication of Speak What We Feel (Not What We <b>Ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>Say).</b> Buechner answered the question [...] "Do you envision a particular audience when you write?" [...] by saying [...] "I always hope to reach people who don't want to touch religion with a ten-foot pole. The cultured despisers of religion, Sehleiermacher called them. Maybe some of my books reach them. But most of my readers, as far as I can tell, aren't that type. Many of them are ministers. They say, 'You've given us something back we lost and opened up doors we didn't think could be opened for people.'" ...|$|E
