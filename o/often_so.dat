5|$|The bee-eaters are diurnal (active by day), {{although}} a few species may migrate during the night if the terrain en route is unsuitable for stopping or if they are crossing the sea. Bee-eaters are highly social, and pairs sitting or roosting together are <b>often</b> <b>so</b> close that they touch (an individual distance of zero). Many species are colonial in the breeding season and some species are also highly gregarious when not nesting.|$|E

It is also visited, though by less numbers, on every Friday afternoon, and by some nearly every day. No one is molested in these visits by the Mahomedans, as {{we have a very}} old firman from the Sultan of Constantinople that the approach shall not be denied to us, though the Porte obtains for this privilege a special tax, which is, however, quite insignificant.|$|E
5|$|Under Dick Stoeffler's management, Kona Lanes kept busy 24 hours a day, {{which made}} him one of the most {{successful}} proprietors in the country. Stoeffler met his future wife there, and other couples had similar experiences. Kona was <b>often</b> <b>so</b> busy that customers had to make reservations to get a lane during open (non-league) bowling hours. At its peak, Kona Lanes averaged more than 80 lines on each of its 40 lanes.|$|E

5|$|David Adler's book {{contains}} {{a detailed account}} of the event that made the Fool's Gold Loaf sandwich famous. On the night of February 1, 1976, Elvis Presley was at his home at Graceland in Memphis, entertaining Capt. Jerry Kennedy of the Denver, Colorado police force, and Ron Pietrafeso of Colorado's Strike Force Against Crime. The three men began discussing the sandwich, and Presley decided he wanted one right then. Presley had been to the restaurant before, while in Denver. Kennedy and Pietrafeso were friends of the owners and hung out there <b>often,</b> <b>so</b> they were driven to the Memphis airport and boarded Presley's private jet, the Lisa Marie, and flew the two hours to Denver. When they arrived at Stapleton International Airport at 1:40 AM, the plane taxied to a special hangar where the passengers were greeted by Buck Scott, the owner of the Colorado Mine Company, and his wife Cindy who had brought 30 fresh Fool's Gold Loaves for the men. They spent two hours in the hangar eating the sandwiches, washing them down with Perrier and champagne. Presley invited the pilots of the plane, Milo High and Elwood Davis, to join them. When they were done, they flew back to Memphis without ever having left the Denver airport.|$|E

25|$|Women's {{personal}} name changes were recorded less <b>often,</b> <b>so</b> {{they may not}} have changed their names as frequently as men did, but women who went into service as maids or entertainers frequently changed their names for the duration of their service. During their employment, their temporary names were treated as their legal names. For example, a maid who was involved in legal dealings in Kyoto in 1819-1831 signed legal documents as Sayo during one period of employment and as Mitsu during a later period of employment, but she signed as Iwa, presumably her birth name, when she was between jobs.|$|E
25|$|The {{products}} of faience manufactories are {{identified by the}} usual methods of ceramic connoisseurship: {{the character of the}} clay body, the character and palette of the glaze, and the style of decoration, faïence blanche being left in its undecorated fired white slip. Faïence parlante bears mottoes often on decorative labels or banners. Apothecary wares, including albarelli, can bear the names of their intended contents, generally in Latin and <b>often</b> <b>so</b> abbreviated to be unrecognizable to the untutored eye. Mottoes of fellowships and associations became popular in the 18th century, leading to the faïence patriotique that was a specialty of the years of the French Revolution.|$|E
25|$|On Cape Cod, marsh creek {{banks are}} <b>often</b> <b>so</b> riddled with Sesarma burrows that they collapse, exposing fresh peat to further {{burrowing}} and erosion (Bertness et al. 2008). Feedbacks between crab herbivory and cordgrass die-off may thus {{lead to the}} retreat of marsh edges. For example, Coverdale and colleagues found that 20 years of die-off on Cape Cod {{have resulted in the}} loss of over 200 years of marsh accretion and hundreds of acres of marsh loss. The detrimental effects trophic cascades have had on marshes not only reduce the biodiversity, health, and aesthetic appeal of these ecosystems, but also compromise the ability of marshes to provide key ecosystem services to human populations.|$|E

25|$|River North was {{previously}} named Smokey Hollow, {{at the turn}} of the 20th century, due to the many factories and forges in the area. Smoke from the factories was <b>often</b> <b>so</b> thick that it blocked the sunlight. At the time, Smokey Hollow was a major transportation hub, with railroad tracks linking the ports along the Chicago River to the surrounding areas. The now mixed-use Merchandise Mart was once a major storage warehouse for goods, and it still has railroad tracks underneath its sprawling structure. Former major retailer Montgomery Ward also had a major transportation and storage facility in River North. Massive coal bins were formerly located throughout the neighborhood, for storage of coal transported by ship.|$|E
25|$|Tāwari is a {{rich source}} of nectar, which is <b>often</b> <b>so</b> {{abundant}} that bees produce monofloral honey, that is the honey is chiefly made of nectar from Tāwari flowers. Tāwari honey is regularly for sale from food shops in New Zealand. The nectar contains a lot of fructose and much water. The honey may be thin as a consequence, but nonetheless crystallizes quickly. The honey has a light colour and tastes a bit like butterscotch. It contains relatively few pollen, and if at least 20% of the pollen is Tāwari, it can be marketed as Tāwari honey. Bark can produce a black dye that is known to be used on flax. Māori people use the flowers to make necklaces and other adornments to be worn at festivities.|$|E
25|$|The {{whole of}} the Soviet Union became {{dedicated}} to the war effort. The population of the Soviet Union was probably better prepared than any other nation involved in the fighting of World War II to endure the material hardships of the war. This is primarily because the Soviets were so used to shortages and coping with economic crisis in the past, especially during wartime—World War I brought similar restrictions on food. Still, conditions were severe. World War II was especially devastating to Soviet citizens because it was fought on their territory and caused massive destruction. In Leningrad, under German siege, over one million people died of starvation and disease. Many factory workers were teenagers, women and the elderly. The government implemented rationing in 1941 and first applied it to bread, flour, cereal, pasta, butter, margarine, vegetable oil, meat, fish, sugar, and confectionery all across the country. The rations remained largely stable in other places during the war. Additional rations were <b>often</b> <b>so</b> expensive {{that they could not}} add substantially to a citizen’s food supply unless that person was especially well-paid. Peasants received no rations and had to make do with local resources that they farmed themselves. Most rural peasants struggled and lived in unbearable poverty, but others sold any surplus they had at a high price and a few became rouble millionaires, until a currency reform two {{years after the end of}} the war wiped out their wealth.|$|E

500|$|Feminist {{economics}} {{argue that}} {{gender and race}} {{must be considered in}} economic analysis. Amartya Sen argues that [...] "the systematically inferior position of women inside and outside the household in many societies points to the necessity of treating gender as a force of its own in development analysis." [...] He {{goes on to say that}} experiences of men and women, even within the same household, are <b>often</b> <b>so</b> different that examining economics without gender can be misleading.|$|E
