5|$|By {{the time}} the strip ended in March 1995 Melchester were in dire straits, on the verge <b>of</b> <b>bankruptcy,</b> and their {{long-term}} future far from certain. When the strip returned in Match of the Day magazine in May 1997, much of the monthly comic's new continuity was ignored, although the basic thread of the club having struggled against relegation and being severely in debt was continued. It was revealed in the first strip that in the intervening years, while Rovers had managed to survive the threat <b>of</b> <b>bankruptcy,</b> a bribery scandal had caused a mass exodus of players and eventual relegation to Division One. Rocky, meanwhile, was playing for fierce local rivals Melborough, after a bitter falling-out with his father over a car accident in Italy in which his mother, Penny, had been killed. Roy, who had quit football as a result, was blamed by some (including his son) for the accident, {{even though he had}} no memory of it, and the precise circumstances surrounding the event were never resolved.|$|E

Over the past 25 years, Canadian businesses have experienced a number of tumultuous periods. After 2 decades <b>of</b> high <b>bankruptcy</b> associated with 2 major recessions and the implementation of 2 free trade agreements in the 1980 s and 1990 s, bankruptcies have returned by 2005 to levels experienced in the early 1980 s. At the same time, the differences between the <b>bankruptcy</b> rates <b>of</b> Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia fell as the intensity <b>of</b> <b>bankruptcies</b> in these 3 provinces converged. Throughout the period, bankruptcies in these 3 provinces moved in concert with unemployment rates in most provinces.

In 1919 Boncho Bonev was imprisoned in Berkovitsa for eight months before he was acquitted, Ivan Kovachev was put on trial, and the bank's funds were sealed. In 1922, the Bulgarian National Bank closed Girdap's account, causing 38 million leva of deposits in Girdap to be withdrawn by 1923 and its debtors (including members of Girdap's management) to protest their bills. While {{at the time the}} Bulgarian National Bank, Girdap's most important creditor, was opposed to Girdap's declaration <b>of</b> <b>bankruptcy,</b> it reversed its stance two years later.

5|$|By 1857, Consett Iron Company {{owed the}} failed Northumberland and Durham District Bank {{almost a million}} pounds.

On 4 April 1864, after operating for several years under the threat <b>of</b> <b>bankruptcy,</b> a new Consett Iron Company Ltd was formed with capital of £400,000. This was divided into 40,000 shares priced initially at £10 each, with J. Priestman as managing director. Two local Members of Parliament, Henry Fenwick and John Henderson, were among the directors. It became the owner of 18 blast furnaces. The company {{had the capacity to}} produce 80,000 tons of pig iron and 50,000 tons of finished iron per year.

40|$|A {{bank failure}} can have various adverse {{consequences}} for the clients. The adverse impacts might, however, differ depending on who takes over {{the operation of the}} failed banks. In this paper, we show that how to manage the new banks is important in mitigating the short-run and long-run consequences of bank failures. In the analysis, we focus on clients of three large failed Japanese banks - Hokkaido Takushoku Bank, the Long-term Credit Bank of Japan (LTCB), and the Nippon Credit Bank. We examine when the number <b>of</b> <b>bankruptcies</b> increased and how the market valuation changed for the client firms after the banks' operations were taken over by new banks. As for the clients of LTCB, there were dramatic increases <b>of</b> <b>bankruptcies</b> in the short-run but the surviving clients showed significant recovery of their stock prices. In contrast, as for the clients of the other two banks, there was neither dramatic increase <b>of</b> <b>bankruptcies</b> nor significant recovery of their stock prices. The result implies that "shock therapy" or "soft budget constraints" had dramatically different consequences in solving bad loan problems in Japan. ...|$|R

Projects to develop a pocket television and digital watch turned out to be expensive failures. The company made losses of more than £350,000 in 1975–76, bringing it to the edge <b>of</b> <b>bankruptcy.</b> In July 1977 Radionics was rescued by a state agency, the National Enterprise Board (NEB), which recapitalised it, provided a loan facility and took effective control of the company by acquiring a 73% stake.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, {{two people}} were {{interested}} in buying the track: Fred Weisman, a California businessman, and former National Football League player Mark May.

In Weisman's first full season of operations, Rosecroft experienced a 10.5 percent increase in handle and an 8.3 percent increase in attendance. In 1992, Western Hanover, the richest horse of that year, won two of the three Triple Crown races, including the Messenger Stakes at Rosecroft. Rosecroft Raceway went into the record books on October 10, 1992, when a three-horse dead heat occurred in the seventh race. It was the 17th time in harness-racing history and the first time in Maryland history.|$|E

The economic landscape of the region was transformed overnight—the South African Republic went from the verge <b>of</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> in 1886 to a fiscal output equal to the Cape Colony's the following year. The British became anxious to link Johannesburg to the Cape and Natal by rail, but Kruger thought this might have undesirable geopolitical and economic implications if done prematurely and gave the Delagoa Bay line first priority.|$|E
