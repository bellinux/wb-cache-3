25|$|Mining {{operations}} use crushers, commonly {{classified by}} {{the degree to which}} they fragment the starting material, with primary and secondary crushers handling coarse materials, and tertiary and quaternary crushers reducing ore particles to finer gradations. Each crusher is designed to work with a certain maximum size of raw material, and often delivers its output to a screening machine which sorts and directs the product for further processing. Typically, crushing stages are followed by milling stages if the materials need to be further reduced. Additionally rockbreakers are typically located next to a crusher to reduce <b>oversize</b> <b>material</b> too large for a crusher. Crushers are used to reduce particle size enough so that the material can be processed into finer particles in a grinder. A typical processing line at a mine might consist of a crusher followed by a SAG mill followed by a ball mill. In this context, the SAG mill and ball mill are considered grinders rather than crushers.|$|E

Depending on {{the magnitude of the}} <b>oversize</b> <b>material</b> so treated and the manner of the crushing process the resulting density and CBR values obtained from duplicate tests may vary considerably and misrepresent the actual properties of the soil. The aim of the paper is to investigate the influence of oversize replacement (OR) on the laboratory CBR. The variations in maximum density and CBR that oversize replacement affect for materials with oversize fractions ranging from 20 to 40 % are significant. Materials with large fractions greater than 19 mm should not be tested for CBR as a strength criterion but should be treated in the manner of crushed stone materials by compacting to a specified solids ratio.

40|$|Rock {{blasting}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} dominating operations in open pit mining efficiency. As many downstream processes depend on the blast-induced fragmentation, an optimized blasting strategy can influence the total revenue of a mine to a large extent. Boliden Aitik mine in northern Sweden {{is one of the}} largest copper mines in Europe. The annual production of the mine is expected to reach 36 million tonnes of ore in 2014; so continuous efforts are being made to boost the production. Highly automated equipment and new processing plant, in addition to new crushers, have sufficient capacity to reach the production goals; the current obstacle in the process of production increase is a bottleneck in crushers caused by oversize boulders. Boulders require extra efforts for secondary blasting or hammer breakage and if entered the crushers, they cause downtimes. Therefore a more evenly distributed fragmentation with less <b>oversize</b> <b>material</b> can be advantageous. Furthermore, a better fragmentation can cause a reduction in energy costs by demanding less amounts of crushing energy. In order to achieve a more favorable fragmentation, two alternative blast designs in addition to a reference design were tested and the results were evaluated and compared to the current design in Aitik. A comparatively large bench was divided to three sections with three different drill plans, which led to different specific charges in each section. The sections were drilled in patterns of 6 x 9 m, 7 x 9 m and 7 x 10 m of burden and spacing; planned specific charges of the sections were 1. 17 kg/m 3, 1. 02 kg/m 3, and 0. 91 kg/m 3 respectively. Similar to the current drill plan in Aitik, the section with 7 x 9 m (1. 02 kg/m 3 specific charge) was used as the reference for results comparison. The drilling and charging processes were monitored carefully and the post-blast parameters were measured accordingly. Laser scanning was used to measure the swelling of the sections and two different methods of image analysis were utilized to evaluate the fragmentation of the rock for each section. Drilling log data (MWD) were analyzed to evaluate the hardness of the rock; energy consumption log of the crusher was also analyzed and all the data was collected in a single database. VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) programming language was embedded within data spreadsheets to correlate the mentioned data to the coordinates of the rock by means of Minestar logs, which include both timestamps and coordinates of all machinery e. g. shovels and trucks. The results of the test show significant improvements in fragmentation and <b>oversize</b> <b>material</b> percentage in the section with 6 x 9 m drill plan (1. 17 kg/m 3). The advantage of 6 x 9 m plan was confirmed by 52 % higher swelling, 66 % lower <b>oversize</b> <b>material</b> and 26 % lower crushing energy compared to the reference section. The section with 7 x 10 m drill plan (0. 91 kg/m 3) also showed theoretically acceptable results; however, the deviations from reference were not as large as formerly mentioned section. The swelling had a decrease of 8 % compared to the reference section and the percentage of <b>oversize</b> <b>material</b> and crushing energy were increased by 16 % and 2 % respectively. Presented results are based only on technical aspects and do not include the costs of drilling and charging. Thus, in order to evaluate the drill plans in practice an economical evaluation of the sections should be conducted. Also a confirmation test with more accurate geology explorations is recommended. Finally, upon the request of Boliden Mines, a short report on the usage of Air-decking technique in Aitik is enclosed as an appendix. The report includes a brief introduction to air-decking and discusses practical solutions to apply this technique in Aitik. Validerat; 20121001 (anonymous...|$|E
