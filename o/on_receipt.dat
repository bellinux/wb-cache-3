5|$|By 1812, {{advisers}} to Alexander suggested {{the possibility of}} an invasion of the French Empire and the recapture of Poland. <b>On</b> <b>receipt</b> of intelligence reports on Russia's war preparations, Napoleon expanded his Grande Armée to more than 450,000 men. He ignored repeated advice against an invasion of the Russian heartland and prepared for an offensive campaign; on 24 June 1812 the invasion commenced.|$|E
5|$|In 1871, Bute {{asked his}} chief Cardiff engineer, John McConnochie, to {{excavate}} and clear the castle ruins. The {{report on the}} investigations was produced by William Burges, an architect {{with an interest in}} medieval architecture who had met Bute in 1865. The Marquess subsequently employed him to redevelop Cardiff Castle in the late 1860s, and the two men became close collaborators. Burges's lavishly illustrated report, which drew extensively on Clark's earlier work, laid out two options: either conserve the ruins or rebuild the castle to create a house for occasional occupation in the summer. <b>On</b> <b>receipt</b> of the report, Bute commissioned Burges to rebuild Castle Coch in a Gothic Revival style.|$|E
5|$|To fit in {{with this}} strategy, the RAF's initial plans {{involved}} launching raids against German shipping <b>on</b> <b>receipt</b> {{of the results of}} aerial reconnaissance. This was attempted on 3 September, when a Bristol Blenheim (flown by Flying Officer Andrew McPherson of No. 139 Squadron RAF)—on a reconnaissance flight over the North Sea—spotted a large naval force in the Schillig Roads off Wilhelmshaven. The Blenheim's radio failed, however, so an attack could not be launched until McPherson returned to base, when 15 Handley Page Hampdens and nine Vickers Wellington bombers were launched against the German ships. The weather was poor, however, and the bombers failed to find any targets.|$|E

5|$|Neither Galba nor his {{successor}} Otho survived long in office. In April 69, Vitellius {{was recognized as}} Emperor by the Roman Senate, but his opponents were beginning to rally behind Vespasian, commander of the Roman forces conducting the war in Judea. The loyalties of Alexander, who commanded two legions and had control of the grain shipments from Alexandria to Rome, were of crucial importance. Fortunately for Vespasian, Alexander was willing to correspond with him secretly; go-betweens suspected by modern historians include Berenice (soon to be lover of Vespasian's son Titus), and an Egyptian official named Basilides. On July 1 Alexander became the first to make a decisive move against Vitellius: <b>on</b> <b>receipt</b> of a letter from Vespasian, he instructed his forces to take the oath of allegiance to Vespasian as Emperor. His lead was followed by legions throughout the eastern Empire, and the anniversary of Vespasian's accession was later celebrated on this date.|$|E
5|$|On 11May the briefcase, {{complete}} with the documents, was returned to Haselden by the Spanish authorities; he forwarded it to London in the diplomatic bag. <b>On</b> <b>receipt</b> the documents were forensically examined, and the missing eyelash noted. Further tests showed that the fibres in the paper had been damaged by folding more than once, which confirmed that the letters had been extracted and read. An additional test was made as the papers – still wet {{by the time they}} returned to London – were dried out: the folded paper dried into the rolled form it had when the Spaniards had extracted it from the envelope. To allay any potential German fears that their activities had been discovered, another pre-arranged encrypted but breakable cable was sent to Haselden stating that the envelopes had been examined and that they had not been opened; Haselden leaked the news to Spaniards known to be sympathetic to the Germans.|$|E
5|$|Required {{to tender}} {{by the end}} of April 1947, work began <b>on</b> <b>receipt</b> of Specification B.35/46 at Avro, led by {{technical}} director Roy Chadwick and chief designer Stuart Davies; the type designation was Avro 698. It was obvious to the design team that conventional aircraft could not satisfy the specification; knowing little about high-speed flight and unable to glean much from the Royal Aircraft Establishment or the US, they investigated German Second World War swept wing research. The team estimated that an otherwise conventional aircraft, with a swept wing of 45°, would have doubled the weight requirement. Realising that swept wings increase longitudinal stability, the team deleted the tail (empennage) and the supporting fuselage, it thus became a swept-back flying wing with only a rudimentary forward fuselage and a fin (vertical stabilizer) at each wingtip. The estimated weight was now only 50% over the requirement; a delta shape resulted from reducing the wingspan and maintaining the wing area by filling in the space between the wingtips, which enabled the specification to be met. Though Alexander Lippisch is generally credited as the pioneer of the delta wing, Chadwick's team had followed its own logical design process. The initial design submission had four large turbojets stacked in pairs buried in the wing either side of the centreline. Outboard of the engines were two bomb-bays.|$|E

G. could return home <b>on</b> <b>receipt</b> of a cable reporting the death of Mrs Martha Grace at the age of 72. The greatest tragedy of Grace's life was the loss of his daughter Bessie in 1898, aged only 20, from typhoid. She had been his favourite child. Then, in February 1905, his eldest son W.

The following morning, having concealed his men in the thicket, Menéndez dressed himself in a French costume with a cape over his shoulder, and, carrying a short lance in his hand, went out and showed himself on the river-bank, accompanied by one of his French prisoners, in order to convince the castaways by his boldness that he was well supported. The Frenchmen soon observed him, and one of their number swam over to where he was standing. Throwing himself at his feet the Frenchman explained who they were and begged the Admiral to grant him and his comrades a safe conduct to Fort Caroline, as they were not at war with Spaniards.|$|E
25|$|One of the UK Special Forces' Jedburgh teams (codenamed Hugh) {{operating}} in the area, reported back to Special Forces HQ, requesting a reprisal attack on {{the headquarters of the}} 17th SS Panzergrenadier Division in Bonneuil-Matours. <b>On</b> <b>receipt</b> of this request, Special Forces HQ passed it on to SAS Brigade HQ, who contacted No. 2 Group RAF, part of the RAF's Second Tactical Air Force. 2 Group's Air Officer Commanding, Air Vice-Marshal Basil Embry assigned the reprisal attack operation to No. 140 Wing RAF, which had already responded to Bulbaskets request for the attack on the supply trains in Châtellerault in the previous month. By this time, No. 140 Wing was operating out of RAF Thorney Island, where, on 14 July 1944, Embry personally briefed the 14 crews selected for this operation. The plan of attack called for four phases: Four Mosquitos would drop high explosive bombs; following them, six aircraft would drop US M76 incendiary bombs; the remaining aircraft would then drop more HE bombs and finally the aircraft would return to strafe the target before returning to base.|$|E
