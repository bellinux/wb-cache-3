Vivès {{has the most}} to say about Baret, but his memoir is problematical because he and Commerson were on bad terms throughout the voyage, and his account – largely written or revised after the fact – is full <b>of</b> <b>innuendo</b> and spiteful comments directed at both Commerson and Baret.|$|E

In an unusual election-eve television broadcast, Ferraro talked about [...] "the ethnic slur that I am {{somehow or other}} connected to organized crime.

Ferraro did not concede she had lost for two weeks.|$|E
500|$|The songs discuss {{dysfunctional}} {{intimate relationships}} and sexual deviancy, and feature themes {{of pleasure and}} guilt. They are narrated {{from the perspective of}} a broken sinner and [...] with sinister and narcissistic tones. Dulli's lyrics incorporate haunting refrains and express angst and melodrama. His baritone vocals are moaningly husky and feature falsetto wails. Daniel Fidler of Spin compares Dulli's vocals on the album to those of [...] "a young Paul Westerberg [...]" [...] David Sprague of the Trouser Press calls Congregation a [...] "strangely flamboyant" [...] album that showcases [...] "Dulli's metamorphosis from everypunk wallflower to rakish scoundrel with a [...]" [...] Jason Ankeny of AllMusic calls Dulli [...] "a truly magnetic presence" [...] and writes of his performance on the album, [...] "by turns predator ('Tonight') and prey ('I'm Her Slave'), he's the guy your parents always warned you about, delivering each syllable of his remarkable lyrics with equal measures <b>of</b> <b>innuendo</b> and venom." [...] Stephanie Benson of Rhapsody comments that his lyrics are [...] "full of stifling dissatisfaction and boozy philosophy".|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} reviewers have {{compared}} [...] "Dear Jessie" [...] {{to the work}} of The Beatles. Allen Metz, {{one of the authors of}} The Madonna Companion: Two Decades of Commentary, described the composition of the song as [...] "pastel-pretty, [...] richly orchestrated". He felt that the song would have fit better on The Beatles' 1969 soundtrack album, Yellow Submarine. The Beatles influence was also noted by Stephen Holden from The New York Times, who labeled [...] "Dear Jessie" [...] a [...] "stylish swatch of late Beatles-style psychedelia". Joey Levy from Spin characterized [...] "Dear Jessie" [...] as [...] "amazing", describing his reaction to the song as [...] "Wow! This is neat!" [...] He added that the song sounded like Prince singing for The Beatles' 1967 album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Kevin Phinney from the Austin American-Statesman compared the song to the solo work that Beatles' member John Lennon did later in his career. Phinney wondered how Madonna was able to come up with the song, since most of the tracks from Like a Prayer are full <b>of</b> <b>innuendo</b> and double meanings.|$|E

500|$|Throughout Houses run, six of {{the main}} actors have {{received}} star billing. All of them play doctors who work at the fictional Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital in New Jersey. Dr. Gregory House (Hugh Laurie), the title character, heads the Department of Diagnostic Medicine. House describes himself as [...] "a board-certified diagnostician with a double specialty of infectious disease and nephrology". Dr. James Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard), House's one true friend, {{is the head of}} the Department of Oncology. Dr. Lisa Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein), an endocrinologist, is House's boss, as she is the hospital's dean of medicine and chief administrator. House has a complex relationship with Cuddy, and their interactions often involve a high degree <b>of</b> <b>innuendo</b> and sexual tension. In the sixth episode of season five, [...] "Joy", they kiss for the first time. Their physical relationship does not progress any further during the fifth season; in the finale of season five, House believes he and Cuddy had sex, but this is a hallucination brought on by House's Vicodin addiction. In the finale of season six, Cuddy tells House she loves him. They kiss and agree to try being a couple. Throughout season seven, House and Cuddy try to make their relationship work. However, in the finale of season seven, House drives his car into Cuddy's living room in anger and their relationship effectively ends.|$|E
500|$|Writing in Variety, Todd McCarthy {{said the}} cast {{ensemble}} [...] "could not be better"; he praised Spacey's [...] "handling <b>of</b> <b>innuendo,</b> subtle sarcasm, and blunt talk" [...] {{and the way}} he imbued Lester with [...] "genuine feeling". Janet Maslin in The New York Times said Spacey was at his [...] "wittiest and most agile" [...] to date, and Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times singled Spacey out for successfully portraying a man who [...] "does reckless and foolish things [...] doesn't deceive himself". Kevin Jackson of Sight & Sound said Spacey impressed in ways distinct from his previous performances, the most satisfying aspect being his portrayal of [...] "both sap and hero". Writing in Film Quarterly, Gary Hentzi praised the actors, but said that characters such as Carolyn and Col. Fitts were stereotypes. Hentzi accused Mendes and Ball of identifying too readily with Jane and Ricky, saying the latter was their [...] "fantasy figure"—a teenaged boy who's an absurdly wealthy artist able to [...] "finance [...] own projects". Hentzi said Angela was the most believable teenager, in particular with her [...] "painfully familiar" [...] attempts to [...] "live up to an unworthy image of herself". Maslin agreed that some characters were unoriginal, but said their detailed characterizations made them memorable. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times said the actors coped [...] "faultlessly" [...] with what were difficult roles; he called Spacey's performance [...] "the energy that drives the film", saying the actor commanded audience involvement despite Lester not always being sympathetic. [...] "Against considerable odds, we do like ," [...] Turan concluded.|$|E

2500|$|In general, Buddhist scripture {{does not}} {{distinguish}} same-sex sexual activity from heterosexual activity, both {{being seen as}} non-conducive to spiritual growth. Many Buddhist moral laws arise from traditional tales and legends, and {{this is also the}} case with the Buddhist view of LGBT people. For example, the monastic rules that prohibit LGBT clergy in some sects come from interpretation of the epic Mahavagga. In the Pandakavathu section of this work, tales about [...] "pandaka" [...] (sexually or gender variant people) are related. In one such story, a Pandaka first approaches a group of monks, then a group of novices, and finally elephant keepers and requests them to [...] "defile" [...] him/her. Although rejected each time and driven away, the encounters create an ethos <b>of</b> <b>innuendo</b> about the monks, leading the Buddha to bar pandakas from the clergy.|$|E
2500|$|Urechia's {{marriage}} to Luiza produced three children: sons Nestor and Alceu and daughter Corina. The Urechias' relationship, likened by Călinescu to a [...] "Greek tragedy", was the topic <b>of</b> <b>innuendo</b> and scandal.

Rumors also had it that the two other Wirth sisters, Carlotta, who was Queen Elisabeth's music tutor, and Emilia, wife of Romanian Army General Staff Chief Nicolae Dona, were also V. A. Urechia's lovers. Such claims of sororal polygyny were notably popularized by Eminescu, who once described Urechia as a [...] "poor fellow who has two keep two sisters as his wives." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{collection}} of stories, Last Tales (...) {{was published in}} 1957, followed in 1958 by the collection Anecdotes of Destiny (...) [...] Last Tales included seven stories that Blixen had intended to be parts of Albondocani. It also included sections called New Gothic Tales and New Winter's Tales. Blixen's concept {{of the art of}} the story is perhaps most directly expressed in the stories [...] "The Blank Page" [...] and [...] "The Cardinal's First Tale" [...] in Last Tales. These tales illustrate her use <b>of</b> <b>innuendo,</b> which Blixen employed to force her reader into participating {{in the creation of the}} story. Though she used techniques of oral storytellers, Blixen entwined obscure references with explicit observation. [...] Her writing was not just a retelling of tales, but a complex layering of clues and double entendres which forces the reader to deduce her intent and draw conclusions. The story for Blixen was vital to expression, giving a recitation of experience, and simultaneously a potential vision of the possible.|$|E

Clegg stated that his rival was indulging in: [...] "the politics <b>of</b> <b>innuendo,</b> mounting false challenges {{and running a}} campaign that is handing political ammunition to the party's political opponents." [...] Huhne and Clegg were debating on live television on BBC's The Politics Show on Sunday 18 November 2007, when presenter Jon Sopel produced a briefing document that had been specially delivered to the show's production team by the Huhne campaign team on the preceding Friday. The document excoriated Clegg {{on a number of}} policy and political issues and was titled [...] "Calamity Clegg". When challenged about the document, Huhne claimed that he had no knowledge of it and said he did not agree with the document title but agreed with the points within it.

But I can assure you that's not had my authorization." [...] After Clegg complained about what he called [...] "dirty tricks" [...] and other senior party members condemned the Huhne campaign attack, Huhne's campaign manager Anna Werrin claimed that the title of the memo was just the product of an [...] "over-zealous researcher" [...] and had not been seen or approved by Huhne or any senior campaign officials prior to release.

2500|$|On December 1, 2008, Multiven {{filed an}} {{antitrust}} lawsuit against Cisco Systems, Inc. {{in an effort}} to open up the network maintenance services marketplace for Cisco equipment, promote competition and ensure consumer choice and value. Multiven's complaint alleges that Cisco harmed Multiven and consumers by bundling and tying bug fixes/patches and updates for its operating system software to its maintenance services (SMARTnet) and through a series of other illegal exclusionary and anticompetitive acts designed to maintain Cisco's alleged monopoly in the network maintenance services market for Cisco networking equipment. In May 2010, Cisco accused the person who filed the antitrust suit, British-Nigerian technology entrepreneur Peter Alfred-Adekeye, with hacking and pressured the US government to extradite him from Canada. Alfred-Adekeye was arrested while in the middle of testifying against Cisco in an anti-trust hearing. Although he was released after 28 days on bail, the case has stretched for a year, because the U.S. Attorney's office was unable to present the evidence required for the extradition. The antitrust lawsuit has been settled 2 months after Alfred-Adekeye's arrest. In May 2011, the US extradition request has been denied. Canadian Supreme Court Justice Ronald McKinnon, who oversaw the extradition hearing, commented on the arrest saying [...] "It is simply not done in a civilized jurisdiction that is bound by the rule of law". He also stated that the real reason for the extradition proceedings was because Alfred-Adekeye [...] "dared to take on a multinational giant." [...] Judge McKinnon has also condemned the US prosecutor for hiding the fact that Alfred-Adekeye was in legal proceedings against Cisco Systems, for stating that Alfred-Adekeye had left the USA in a time period when he had not and a formal request for extradition was not filed against Alfred-Adekeye when he was taken into custody. He described the information provided by Cisco and the US prosecutor as [...] "full <b>of</b> <b>innuendo,</b> half-truths and falsehoods," [...] adding that [...] "This speaks volumes for Cisco's duplicity" [...] and accused them of [...] "unmitigated gall" [...] in using such a heavy-handed move as an unsupportable arrest and jailing to pressure Alfred-Adekeye to drop or settle his civil antitrust complaint.|$|E

For this the attitude of the Church itself was much to blame; coarse, virulent, unspiritual as it was in France in those days. Voltaire, Diderot, Holbach, would have written in a very different spirit, even while maintaining and publishing the same attacks on theological opinion, if the Church of France had possessed such a school of teachers as the Church of England found in the Latitudinarians in the seventeenth century; or such as she finds now in the nineteenth century in those who have imported, partly from the poetry of Wordsworth, partly from the historic references of the Oxford Tracts, an equity, a breadth, an elevation, a pensive grace, that effectually forbid the use of those more brutal weapons of controversy which were the only weapons possible in France a century ago.|$|E
