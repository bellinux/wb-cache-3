40|$|In {{previous}} research {{it has been}} shown that while the Dickey [...] Fuller unit root test exhibits oversizing in the presence of GARCH, this is reduced via the application <b>of</b> <b>White's</b> heteroscedasticity-consistent covariance matrix (HCCM). These findings provide the motivation for the present study. It is shown that the application <b>of</b> <b>White's</b> HCCM to the Dickey [...] Fuller test results in a shift of the finite-sample distribution of the test thereby necessitating the use of HCCM-specific critical values. Re-examination of the impact of GARCH upon the Dickey [...] Fuller test shows the combination <b>of</b> <b>White's</b> HCCM and HCCM-specific critical values leads to a marked improvement in empirical size. A similar analysis is performed for an alternative nonlinear unit root test. The results obtained show that in comparison to the Dickey [...] Fuller test, the distribution of this test is more sensitive to the use <b>of</b> <b>White's</b> HCCM while it also exhibits greater oversizing in the presence of GARCH. However, use <b>of</b> <b>White's</b> HCCM and HCCM-specific critical values are found to correct the size of the test. The results presented illustrate the usefulness <b>of</b> <b>White's</b> HCCM and HCCM-specific critical values when examining the unit root hypothesis in time series exhibiting GARCH. ...|$|R
