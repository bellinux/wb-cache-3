They serve to regulate the star formation rates and suppress the growth of supermassive black holes. A significant fraction of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) possess powerful radio jets capable of driving such large-scale outflows. Having a good grasp of the physical properties of the outflows is essential for understanding the impact they can have on their environment. The first part of this thesis aims to characterize a large sample of radio jet-driven <b>outflows.</b> <b>I</b> selected a sample of 80 radio-loud AGNs and observed them using an integral field spectrograph. The resulting data map the flux distribution and the kinematic structure of any detected outflow, which allowed us to estimate the total mass, mass outflow rate, and 3 -D morphology of the outflow. Despite circumstantial evidence that supports a direct causal link between the jets and the outflows, the most luminous and extended outflow systems do not show any evidence of interaction with the radio jets. I observed the outflow systems from 8 very young radio sources, which are more likely to show evidence of direct jet-cloud interaction. I found that at these early stages, the outflows have morphologies and velocity gradients that are well aligned with the corresponding radio axes, unlike the outflows associated with the more evolved radio sources. To further investigate the early stage of the <b>outflows,</b> <b>I</b> performed a detailed analysis of a very young and compact outflow from 3 C 48, a young radio-loud quasar.

40|$|This {{research}} combines observation, experimentation, {{and modeling}} {{to evaluate the}} influence of lakes on dissolved organic matter (DOM) quantity, quality and export in subalpine watersheds of the Sawtooth Mountain Lake District, central Idaho. First, I conducted an empirical study of the hydrologic and biogeochemical controls on DOM dynamics in stream-lake fluvial networks. I hypothesized that lakes would decrease temporal variability (i. e., buffer) and alter the characteristics of DOM from inflow to outflow. I tested these hypotheses by evaluating DOM temporal patterns and measuring annual export in seven-paired lake inflows and <b>outflows.</b> <b>I</b> then evaluated how ultraviolet (UV) exposure affected DOM characteristics during snowmelt and baseflow, and how UV alters baseflow DOM bioavailability and nutrient limitation. Given that increased water residence time increases UV exposure, I hypothesized that lake outflow DOM would be more photorecalcitrant than DOM from lake inflows. I further hypothesized that UV exposure would increase DOM quality, heterotrophic processing, and nutrient demand. Results indicate that lakes can buffer stream temporal variability by acting as a DOM sink during snowmelt and a DOM source during baseflow. Lake outflow DOM photodegradation was similar to lake inflows during snowmelt (p= 0. 66). Conversely, outflow DOM was 2 X more photorecalcitrant than inflow DOM during baseflow (ANOVA, p= 0. 03) and was strongly related to water residence time (WRT). During baseflow, light exposure increased inflow and outflow DOM bioavailability (p= 0. 059 and 0. 024, respectively) and nutrient limitation (p= 0. 03 and 0. 09, respectively). Combined, {{these results indicate that}} WRT in subalpine lakes strongly influences DOM temporal variability and DOM degradation and processing. Thus, lakes can provide temporal stability of DOM and potentially increase both carbon and nutrient uptake by heterotrophs in lake <b>outflows.</b> <b>I</b> then evaluated how global changes could alter hydrologic and nutrient dynamics in a subalpine lake. Model results indicate that the magnitude and timing of snowmelt runoff can have a substantial effect on water and nutrient exports. In phosphorus (P) -limited lakes, increases in inorganic N concentrations within and exported from lakes are likely to occur with increased temperatures and lake WRT. Increases in atmospheric N deposition will further enhance inorganic N exports in P-limited subalpine lakes...|$|E

In the second part, I examine a dynamic investment model where firms invest in a risky asset but cannot hedge the risk of their investment because they lack the ability to commit to future repayments of debt. Once firms have access to exogenous supplies of risk free assets, they may on an aggregate level invest more in the risky asset, because risk free technology allows them to increase in wealth in equilibrium.

This radio data, in addition to measurements at the optical bands, suggest that the afterglow arises from a collimated <b>outflow,</b> <b>i.</b> e. a jet. To test this hypothesis in a self-consistent manner, we employ a global fit and find that a model of a jet, expanding into a constant density medium (ISM+jet), provides the best fit to the data. A model of the burst occurring in a wind-shaped circumburst medium (wind-only model) can be ruled out, and a wind+jet model provides a much poorer fit of the optical/IR data than the ISM+jet model. In addition, we present the first clear indication that the reported fluctuations in the optical/IR are achromatic with similar amplitudes in all bands, and possibly extend into the radio regime. Using the parameters derived from the global fit, in particular a jet break time, t jet ≈ 7. 5 days, we infer a jet opening angle of θ 0 ≈ 0. 2, and consequently the estimate of the emitted energy in the GRB itself is reduced by a factor ∼ 50 relative to the isotropic value, giving E ≈ 1. 1 × 10 51 ergs.

40|$|Abstract. Cellular Automata (CA) {{represent}} a formal frame for dynamical systems, which evolve {{on the base}} of local interactions. Some types of landslide, such as debris flows, match well this requirement. The latest hexagonal release (S 3 −hex) of the deterministic model SCIDDICA, specifically developed for simulating debris flows, is described. For CA simulation purposes, landslides {{can be viewed as a}} dynamical system, subdivided into elementary parts, whose state evolves exclusively as a consequence of local interactions within a spatial and temporal discretum. Space is the world of the CA, here constituted by hexagonal cells. The attributes of each cell (“substates”) describe physical characteristics. For computational reasons, the natural phenomenon is “decomposed ” into a number of elementary processes, whose proper composition makes up the “transition function ” of the CA. By simultaneously applying this function to all the cells, the evolution of the phenomenon can be simulated in terms of modifications of the substates. SCIDDICA S 3 −hex exhibits a great flexibility in modelling debris flows. With respect to the previous releases of the model, the mechanism of progressive erosion of the soil cover has been added to the transition function. Considered substates are: altitude; thickness and energy of landslide debris; depth of erodable soil cover; debris outflows. Considered elementary processes are: mobilisation triggering and effect (T 1), debris <b>outflows</b> (<b>I</b> 1), update of landslide debris thickness and energy (I 2), and energy loss (T 2).

40|$|Magnetars are {{proposed}} to be peculiar neutron stars powered by their super strong magnetic field. Observationally, anomalous X-ray pulsars and soft gamma-ray repeaters {{are believed to}} be magnetar candidates. While more and more multiwave observations of magnetars are available, unfortunately, we see accumulating failed predictions of the traditional magnetar model. These challenges urge rethinking of magnetar. Wind braking of magnetars is one of the alternative modelings. The release of magnetic energy may generate a particle <b>outflow</b> (<b>i.</b> e., particle wind), that results in both an anomalous X-ray luminosity and significantly high spindown rate. In this wind braking scenario, only strong multipole field is necessary for a magnetar (a strong dipole field is no longer needed). Wind braking of magnetars may help us to understand their multiwave radiation properties, including (1) Non-detection of magnetars in Fermi-LAT observations, (2) The timing behaviors of low magnetic field magnetars, (3) The nature of anti-glitches, (4) The criterion for magnetar's radio emission, etc. In the wind braking model of magentars, timing events of magnetars should always be accompanied by radiative events. It is worth noting that the wind engine should be the central point in the research since other efforts with any reasonable energy mechanism may also reproduce the results.

40|$|Background: The reservoir-wave {{paradigm}} considers aortic {{pressure as}} the superposition of a 'reservoir pressure', {{directly related to}} changes in reservoir volume, and an 'excess' component ascribed to wave dynamics. The change in reservoir pressure {{is assumed to be}} proportional to the difference between aortic inflow and <b>outflow</b> (<b>i.</b> e. aortic volume changes), an assumption that is virtually impossible to validate in vivo. The aim of this study is therefore to apply the reservoir-wave paradigm to aortic pressure and flow waves obtained from three-dimensional fluid-structure interaction simulations in a model of a normal aorta, aortic coarctation (narrowed descending aorta) and stented coarctation (stiff segment in descending aorta). Method and results: We found no unequivocal relation between the intraaortic volume and the reservoir pressure for any of the simulated cases. When plotted in a pressure-volume diagram, hysteresis loops are found that are looped in a clockwise way indicating that the reservoir pressure is lower than the pressure associated with the change in volume. The reservoir-wave analysis leads to very high excess pressures, especially for the coarctation models, but to surprisingly little changes of the reservoir component despite the impediment of the buffer capacity of the aorta. Conclusion: With the observation that reservoir pressure is not related to the volume in the aortic reservoir in systole, an intrinsic assumption in the wave-reservoir concept is invalidated and, consequently, also the assumption that the excess pressure is the component of pressure that can be attributed to wave travel and reflection...|$|R
40|$|DNA {{damage is}} related {{to a variety of}} {{degenerative}} diseases such as cancer, atherosclerosis and neurodegenerative diseases, depending on the tissue affected. Increasing evidence indicates that reactive oxygen species (ROS) {{play a key role in}} the pathogenesis of primary open angle glaucoma (POAG), the main cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. Oxidative DNA damage is significantly increased in the ocular epithelium regulating aqueous humor <b>outflow,</b> <b>i.</b> e., the trabecular meshwork (TM), of glaucomatous patients compared to controls. The pathogenic role of ROS in glaucoma is supported by various experimental findings, including (a) resistance to aqueous humor outflow is increased by hydrogen peroxide by inducing TM degeneration; (b) TM possesses remarkable antioxidant activities, mainly related to superoxide dismutase–catalase and glutathione pathways that are altered in glaucoma patients; and (c) intraocular-pressure increase and severity of visual-field defects in glaucoma patients parallel the amount of oxidative DNA damage affecting TM. Vascular alterations, which are often associated with glaucoma, could contribute to the generation of oxidative damage. Oxidative stress, occurring not only in TM but also in retinal cells, appears to be involved in the neuronal cell death affecting the optic nerve in POAG. The highlighting of the pathogenic role of ROS in POAG has implications for the prevention of this disease as indicated by the growing number of studies using genetic analyses to identify susceptible individuals and of clinical trials testing the efficacy of antioxidant drugs for POAG management...|$|R
