5|$|Important {{national}} and royal ceremonies are shared between St Paul's and Westminster Abbey. The Abbey {{is not to}} be confused with nearby Westminster Cathedral, which is the largest Roman Catholic cathedral in England and Wales. Despite the prevalence of Anglican churches, observance is very low within the Anglican denomination. Church attendance continues <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>long,</b> slow, steady decline, according to Church of England statistics.|$|E
5|$|In October 1993, River Phoenix came to {{stay with}} Frusciante and the duo went <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> drug binge {{together}}, {{doing a lot of}} drugs and barely sleeping. According to Bob Forrest, the two arrived at The Viper Room together on October 31, 1993 and continued to do drugs. Shortly after their arrival, Phoenix went into seizures and was rushed by ambulance (accompanied by Flea) to the hospital where he died of a drug overdose.|$|E
5|$|On {{their first}} {{offensive}} {{possession of the}} second half, and on the third consecutive offensive play, Alabama scored <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> touchdown play. This time Julio Jones ran the ball 56-yards for a touchdown to extend the Alabama lead to 27–3. Shelley scored Alabama's final points in the fourth on a 28-yard field goal with State scoring their lone touchdown late on a 27-yard Chad Bumphis touchdown reception from Tyler Russell. The Alabama defense allowed only 149 rushing yards, registered five sacks and two interceptions.|$|E

5|$|Robert soon left Avalona {{and sailed}} {{to the island}} of Corfu, which {{surrendered}} because of a small garrison. Having won a bridgehead and a clear path for reinforcements from Italy, he advanced on the city of Dyrrhachium, the capital and chief port of Illyria. The city was well defended <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>long,</b> narrow peninsula running parallel to the coast, but separated by marshlands. Guiscard brought his army onto the peninsula and pitched camp outside the city walls. However, as Robert's fleet sailed to Dyrrhachium, it {{was hit by a}} storm and lost several ships.|$|E
5|$|A halt {{was called}} for Christmas while {{supplies}} were brought up. Units had a rest day. Most dined on turkey, ham, roast potatoes and Christmas pudding, and Christmas services were held. General Blamey insisted that Christmas fare be available to all units, and extraordinary {{efforts were made to}} carry out his directive. In one instance, a Piper Cub of No. 4 Squadron RAAF dropped Christmas fare to a Papuan Company <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> range patrol. The advance resumed on 27 December, preceded by air strikes by 18 B-25 Mitchell and 12 Boston bombers. The 2/15th Infantry Battalion and tanks of A Squadron, 1st Tank Battalion took the lead on 31 December; they reached Sialum on 2 January 1944. This had a sheltered beach which served as a maintenance area. That day, the American landing at Saidor placed a large force across the Japanese escape route.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{bounced back}} the {{following}} season, winning their second League title. Arsenal {{had started the}} season weakly, but then went <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> winning run to catch up and then overtake fellow title challengers Aston Villa, whom they beat 5–0 at Highbury in April to clinch the title. By this time Chapman's first set of signings had started to show their age so {{with an eye to}} the future Chapman promoted George Male to the first team to replace Tom Parker, and signed Ray Bowden to take over from David Jack. The only blot on the club's record was an infamous loss to Walsall of the Third Division North in the FA Cup; five of the first team were out with injury or flu and had their place taken by reserves, and without them Arsenal lost 2–0 in one of the greatest FA Cup upsets of all time. One of the stand-ins, Tommy Black, was particularly to blame (conceding a penalty for Walsall's second), and was sold by an enraged Chapman to Plymouth Argyle within a week of the result; another, striker Charlie Walsh, was transferred to Brentford a week later.|$|E

5|$|Between 1970 and 1975, Sihanouk took up {{residence}} in state guesthouses at Beijing and Pyongyang, courtesy of the Chinese and North Korean governments, respectively. In February 1973 Sihanouk traveled to Hanoi, where he started <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> journey with Khieu Samphan and other Khmer Rouge leaders. The convoy proceeded along the Ho Chi Minh trail and reached the Cambodian border at Stung Treng Province the following month. From there, they traveled across the provinces of Stung Treng, Preah Vihear, and Siem Reap. Throughout this entire leg of the journey, Sihanouk faced constant bombardment from American planes participating in Operation Freedom Deal. At Siem Reap, Sihanouk visited the temples of Angkor Wat, Banteay Srei, and Bayon. In August 1973 Sirik Matak wrote an open letter calling on Sihanouk to bring the Cambodian Civil War {{to an end and}} suggesting the possibility of his return to the country. When the letter reached Sihanouk, he angrily rejected Sirik Matak's advances.|$|E
5|$|California {{received}} {{the ball at}} its 41-yard line and used the good field position to its advantage. After two short-gain plays, Rodgers completed a 16-yard pass and a 24-yard toss to drive the Bears inside the Virginia Tech 20-yard line. Echemandu rushed the ball twice for seven total yards, then Rodgers ran it himself the remaining nine yards for another California touchdown. The touchdown and extra point gave California a 42–28 lead, its largest in the game. Virginia Tech {{received the}} ball with 41seconds remaining in the quarter, and ran four quick plays. After Bryan Randall threw two incompletions, he connected with Ernest Wilford <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> 23-yard pass, and Kevin Jones rushed up {{the middle of the}} field for another 12yards. As time expired in the quarter, Tech was inside California territory for the first time since the beginning of the quarter and had a first down. At the end of the third quarter, California held a 42–28 lead.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland rebounded {{from its}} first {{loss of the}} season with a 31–28 victory over the Rockets. The game started slow; Groza's 21-yard field goal was the only score in the first quarter. The Rockets then went ahead by scoring a {{touchdown}} <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> pass from quarterback Vacanti to end Elroy Hirsch. Cleveland, however, piled on the points as Motley ran for a touchdown in the second quarter and Speedie caught a pass from Graham in the third. Jones added two touchdown runs in the fourth quarter, giving Cleveland a 31–14 lead. Chicago almost caught {{up at the end of}} the game, scoring two touchdowns, but the Browns held on to win. Cleveland's third-string players were on the field in the closing minutes when Chicago made its final push. Rockets rookie Ray Ramsey had three touchdowns in the game. Graham had 239 passing yards on 10 completions. Speedie caught half of them, gaining 166 yards. His touchdown came after he dropped to the ground to grab a 17-yard pass from Graham. He faked a backward lateral while on the ground, which drew Chicago's defense away from him, and then got up and ran into the end zone.|$|E

5|$|Directional {{stability}} {{was achieved}} by four fixed vanes, two vertical and two horizontal, attached {{at the rear of}} the gas-bag, and by a long vertical vane running along the main axis of the gas-bag from the centre of the elliptical frame to its rear. Horizontal motion was controlled by the movement of a balanced rudder at the rear of an empennage <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> boom, mounted below the gas-bag and aft of the gondola (see lead image). The empennage consisted of vertical and horizontal vanes arranged like the fletching of an arrow, behind which the vertical rudder was mounted. During a refit in 1907 the vertical vanes of the empennage were modified, as is shown in the accompanying illustration.|$|E
5|$|Early in the 1958–59 season, Punch Imlach, the {{assistant}} {{general manager of the}} Leafs, fired Reay, installed himself as head coach, and appointed Olmstead as the playing assistant coach. This meant that while Imlach coached the team during games, Olmstead {{was in charge of the}} practices; however, Olmstead only lasted three months as assistant coach, resigning to devote more time to improving his play. The same season, the Leafs went <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> winning streak in order to qualify for the playoffs, but they lost to the Canadiens in the finals. After losing in the Finals the next season, and falling short of the Finals the next season, Olmstead won his fifth and final Stanley Cup in 1962, missing two months of the season with a broken shoulder, and being limited to only four out of the 12playoffgames.|$|E
5|$|Ian Richardson {{was booked}} {{within a minute}} {{of the second half}} {{starting}} for bringing down Kiwomya. Notts County started to come back into the game; Martindale headed wide, Agana and Richardson both had shots blocked during a goalmouth scramble and Tony Battersby had a shot saved over the crossbar by Jonathan Gould, as County tried to equalise during a 20-minute spell of pressure. Between County's chances, Stallard had the opportunity to double City's lead when he capitalised on a slip from Strodder, but Ward saved his effort. However, City went on to double their advantage on 75 minutes. Ormondroyd, who had replaced the injured Hamilton, flicked <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> pass from Richard Huxford with his first touch. His header went across goal to Stallard who volleyed home. Two minutes after the goal, Martindale fired wide for County after a pass from Agana, and with time running out Finnan's long-range shot was deflected for a corner, but from the resulting set-piece, Richardson shot over the crossbar.|$|E

5|$|In a contest, a row {{of small}} cages, each housing a single male finch, is lined up {{approximately}} six feet apart along a street. The close proximity of the cages increases the number of calls, as the birds sing for mates and to establish territory. A timekeeper begins and ends the contest with a red flag. Every time a bird sings a correct terminating flourish to their callmost often transcribed as susk-e-wieta tally mark in chalk is made <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> wooden stick. The bird singing its song the most times during one hour wins the contest. Champion finches regularly sing hundreds of calls in contests.|$|E
5|$|Longstreet's {{attack was}} delayed, however, because he {{first had to}} wait for his final brigade (Evander M. Law's, Hood's division) to arrive, and then he was forced to march <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>long,</b> {{circuitous}} route that could not be seen by Union Army Signal Corps observers on Little Round Top. It was 4 p.m. by the time his two divisions reached their jumping off points, and then he and his generals were astonished to find the III Corps planted directly in front of them on the Emmitsburg Road. Hood argued with Longstreet that this new situation demanded a change in tactics; he wanted to swing around, below and behind, Round Top and hit the Union Army in the rear. Longstreet, however, refused to consider such a modification to Lee's order.|$|E
5|$|Lurgan {{sits in a}} {{relatively}} flat part of Ireland by the south east shore of Lough Neagh. The two main formations in north Armagh are an area of estuarine clays by {{the shore of the}} lough, and a mass of basalt farther back. The earliest human settlements in the area were to the northwest of the present day town near the shore of the lough. When the land was handed to the Brownlow family, they initially settled near the lough at Annaloist, but later settled where the town was eventually built. The oldest part of the town, the main street, is built <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> ridge in the townland (baile fearainn) of Lurgan.

5|$|On {{the morning}} of what they {{suspected}} would be the general engagement, Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg sought out the field chaplain, and requested the sacraments because, as he told his aide, anything can happen during a battle. Although Ostrach had been a hard-fought battle, at Engen and Stockach, the Austrian and French forces were far more concentrated—more men in a smaller space—than they had been at Ostrach, where the French forces in particular had been stretched thinly <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> line from Lake Constance to north of the Danube. At Stockach, furthermore, Jourdan had all his troops under his direct control, {{with the possible exception}} of Dominique Vandamme, who was maneuvering his small force of cavalry and light infantry into position to attempt a flanking action on the far right Austrian flank.|$|E

5|$|The Japanese {{determined}} that the reestablishment of their forces on the east bank of the Matanikau would be prohibitive {{in terms of the}} number of troops required to accomplish it. Therefore, the Japanese devised a plan of attack for their scheduled offensive that sent many of their troops <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> and arduous journey to attack the U.S. Lunga perimeter from inland. The march—which began on 16 October—exhausted the Japanese troops involved to such an extent that it was later considered as one of the major factors in the decisive Japanese defeat in the subsequent Battle for Henderson Field from 23–26 October 1942. Thus, the failure of the Japanese to gain and hold a strong position on the Matanikau proved to have lasting strategic consequences in the battle for Guadalcanal, significantly contributing to the ultimate Allied victory in the campaign.|$|E
