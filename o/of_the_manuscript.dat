5|$|The codex was {{prepared}} for liturgical use with marginalia (text's division), and has almost completely survived; it was used by Erasmus for his Novum Instrumentum omne. The text <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>manuscript</b> has been cited in all critical editions of the Greek New Testament; in this codex, {{the text of the}} Gospels is more highly esteemed by scholars than that of the remaining New Testament books.|$|E
5|$|The {{early history}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>{{manuscript}}</b> is unknown. In 1821 {{it was brought}} by general Colin Macaulay to England from the Greek island Zakynthos in the Ionian Sea. The manuscript {{was placed in the}} library of the British and Foreign Bible Society (Mss 24) in London.|$|E
5|$|The first 26 (numbered) pages <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>manuscript</b> {{paper for}} the pre-Oceanides suite are missing; {{assuming}} {{the first page}} would have been reserved for the title, {{this means that the}} missing first movement likely consisted of 25 pages.

5|$|The lower text <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>manuscript</b> {{contains}} {{fragments of}} the chapters 1:1-11:33 of the Gospel of Luke. The codex comprises 86 thick, coarse parchment leaves and three partial leaves; it measures 36 x 29cm. The text was written in a single column with well-formed uncial script. The letters are large, round and narrow, without spiritus asper, spiritus lenis, or accents. The manuscript was written by two scribes.|$|E
5|$|The {{provenance}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>manuscript</b> {{before the}} seventeenth century is unclear. From a signature on the flyleaf {{we know that it}} was in van Vliet's collection in 1659. It was auctioned in 1666, after his death, and probably was purchased by Franciscus Junius, from whose library it came to the Bodleian as part of the Junius donation (Holt 1878, pp. liv–lvi).|$|E
5|$|As a result, {{the text}} of Asser's Life is known from a {{multitude}} of different sources. Various transcripts {{had been made of}} the Cotton manuscript and a facsimile of the first page <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>manuscript</b> had been made and published, giving more direct evidence for the hand of the scribe. In addition to these transcripts, the extracts mentioned above made by other early writers have been used to help assemble and assess the text. Because of the lack <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>manuscript</b> itself and because Parker's annotations had been copied by some transcribers as if {{they were part of the}} text, scholarly editions have had a difficult burden. There have been multiple editions of The Life published, both in Latin and in translation. The 1904 critical edition by W. H. Stevenson, Asser's Life of King Alfred, together with the Annals of Saint Neots erroneously ascribed to Asser, still provides the standard text. An important recent translation, with thorough notes on the scholarly problems and issues, is Alfred the Great: Asser's Life of King Alfred and Other Contemporary Sources by Simon Keynes and Michael Lapidge.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the issues}} with the {{publishing}} of Killing Time, there was increased oversight by Roddenberry's staff regarding the novels published by Pocket Books. This was delegated to Arnold, and would later cause confusion for Pocket Books as comments would be sent back and it was sometimes unclear whether they were from Roddenberry or Arnold. These comments rejected plot developments in the novels where they were {{stepping out of the}} bounds set by the television series. Rumours subsequently spread that there was an alternative version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>manuscript</b> with more explicit Kirk/Spock slash details, something that Van Hise later denied.|$|E
5|$|Giraldus Cambrensis wrote a Life of St Æthelberht, {{probably}} at Hereford during the 1190s. He quotes an incident from Asser {{that occurred during}} the reign of Offa of Mercia, who died in 796. This incident is not in the surviving copies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>manuscript.</b> It is possible that Giraldus had access to a different copy of Asser's work. It is also possible that he is quoting a different work by Asser, which is otherwise unknown, or even that Giraldus is making up the reference to Asser to support his story. The latter is at least plausible, since Giraldus is not always regarded as a trustworthy writer.|$|E
5|$|In June 2005, a team {{of experts}} from the UK, Europe, Egypt, Russia and USA {{undertook}} a joint project to produce a new digital edition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>manuscript</b> (involving all four holding libraries), {{and a series of}} other studies was announced. This will include the use of hyperspectral imaging to photograph the manuscripts to look for hidden information such as erased or faded text. This is to be done in cooperation with the British Library.|$|E
40|$|Three million ancient Arabic manuscripts are jealously {{preserved}} in libraries, in conservation institutions and in private homes. A non-consulted document {{is like a}} dead document—its fate is related to its consultation by users. The access {{to this kind of}} document is very difficult because of two main reasons: first, <b>the</b> fragile state <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>manuscripts</b> that make them easily degradable, necessarily limiting handling. Second, <b>the</b> dispersion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>manuscripts</b> in different locations in the world makes access difficult. Thus, the digitization and <b>the</b> online availability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ancient Arabic <b>manuscripts</b> are sought as a solution. The question remains: how to access <b>the</b> digitized images <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>manuscripts?</b> Despite <b>the</b> difficulty <b>of</b> interpreting <b>the</b> images, building the cataloguing is an imperative. Our paper deals with <b>the</b> Arabic <b>manuscript</b> cataloguing problems. It reviews <b>the</b> various aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Arabic <b>manuscripts</b> cataloguing metadata. We propose a new cataloguing model and a potential interoperability project between catalogs encoded with different formats...|$|R

5|$|The Codex Sinaiticus {{came to the}} {{attention}} of scholars in the 19th century at Saint Catherine's Monastery in the Sinai Peninsula, with further material discovered in the 20th and 21st centuries. Although parts of the codex are scattered across four libraries around the world, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>manuscript</b> is today vested in the British Library in London, where it is on public display. Since its discovery, study of the Codex Sinaiticus has proven to be useful to scholars for critical studies of biblical text.|$|E
5|$|The Marriage Charter of Empress Theophanu (State Archives of Wolfenbüttel, 6 Urk 11) is the dower {{document}} for the Byzantine princess Theophanu. Written in Latin, {{the document}} {{was created in the}} Early Middle Ages after the marriage of Theophanu to Emperor Otto II in 972, which made her the Holy Roman Empress. The document was prepared by Otto II and exemplifies an instance of political and cultural contact between the Holy Roman Empire and the Byzantine Empire. It serves as an example of Ottonian Renaissance art, and the calligraphy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>manuscript</b> has led it to be {{regarded as one of the}} most beautiful diplomatic documents of the Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of the book was terminated by Bernoulli's death in 1705; thus the book is essentially incomplete when compared with Bernoulli's original vision. The quarrel with his younger brother Johann, who was the most competent person who could have fulfilled Jacob's project, prevented Johann to get hold <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>manuscript.</b> Jacob's own children were not mathematicians and were {{not up to the}} task of editing and publishing the manuscript. Finally Jacob's nephew Niklaus, 7 years after Jacob's death in 1705, managed to publish the manuscript in 1713.|$|E
