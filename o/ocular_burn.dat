Methods: The medical records of fifteen patients who had DALK with AMT were retrospectively reviewed. Indi-cations for surgery included <b>ocular</b> <b>burn,</b> bacterial keratitis, herpes simplex virus keratitis, corneal opacity with Stevens-Johnson syndrome, Mooren’s ulcer, idiopathic myxoid degeneration of corneal stroma, and recurrent band keratopathy. DALK was performed using partial-thickness acellular corneal tissue and a temporary am-niotic membrane patch was added {{at the end of}} the operation. Results: All cases that underwent DALK with AMT became epithelialized within 2 postoperative weeks. Twelve patients showed favorable outcomes without graft rejection, corneal opacification, or neovascularization. The other three grafts developed corneal opacification and neovascularization, and required additional penetrating keratoplasty (PK). Unlike the results of previous PKs, there were no graft rejections and the graft clarity was well-maintained in these three cases for at least 8 months after PK.

40|$|BACKGROUND/AIM—Chemical <b>ocular</b> <b>burn,</b> {{especially}} by alkali, {{may result in}} damage to the limbal stem cells, fundamental in maintaining the integrity of ocular surface. Clinically, patients manifest abnormal conjunctival-corneal healing with peripheral neovessels, chronic epithelial defect, severe stromal inflammation, and conjunctivalisation of the corneal, which is characteristic of limbal deficiency. Penetrating keratoplasty has a poor prognosis in these cases. Available therapeutic options included limbal autograft and allograft transplantation associated or not with human amniotic membrane transplant. The authors propose an alternative treatment with ipsilateral autologous limbal transplantation, transferring the healthy portion of the limbus from the partially burned eye to the deficient area in patients with partial limbal deficiency secondary to alkali burn.  METHODS—Ipsilateral limbal autografts were performed in five patients with partial limbal deficiency secondary to alkali burn, transferring the healthy portion of the limbus to the burned area of the same eye, without intervening in the contralateral eye.  RESULTS—All cases had regression of the limbal deficiency with improvement of visual acuity to a minimum of 20 / 60 - 20 / 20 (partial), without complications during the follow up period (range 7 - 11 months).  CONCLUSION—Ipsilateral autologous limbal autograft is a therapeutic option for partial limbal deficient eyes. ...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{compare the}} safety, efficacy, and {{clinical}} outcomes of simple limbal epithelial transplantation (SLET) with conjunctival-limbal autologous transplantation (CLAU) in severe unilateral <b>ocular</b> chemical <b>burns.</b> Materials and Methods: Twenty patients of unilateral chronic <b>ocular</b> <b>burns</b> {{with more than}} 270 ° limbal stem cell deficiency and a healthy fellow eye {{were divided into two}} groups – ten patients of Group A underwent SLET while ten patients of Group B were operated for CLAU. Patients were followed up for 6 months and assessed for a stable epithelialized ocular surface, extent of reduction in vascularization and forniceal reconstruction, improvement in corneal clarity and visual acuity. Results: A stable epithelialized corneal surface was obtained in all patients, with a significant reduction in the mean clock hours of vascularization in both the groups (P < 0. 001). The mean symblepharon score showed a statistically significant reduction from 1. 80 ± 1. 14 to 0. 30 ± 0. 63 in Group A and 1. 70 ± 1. 06 to 0. 15 ± 0. 24 in Group B at 6 months. Corneal clarity, as well as best-corrected visual acuity, showed a statistically significant improvement in both the groups. Conclusion: Both the procedures, SLET and CLAU, were equally effective in achieving a stable ocular surface, forniceal reconstruction, and regression of corneal vascularization.

40|$|Corneal {{wound healing}} {{involves}} a complex cascade of cytokine-controlled cellular events, including inflammatory and angiogenesis responses that are regulated by transcriptional chromatin remodeling. Nuclear Ubiquitous Casein and cyclin-dependent Kinase Substrate (NUCKS) {{is a key}} chromatin modifier and transcriptional regulator of metabolic signaling. In this study, we investigated the role of NUCKS in corneal wound healing by comparing its effects on corneal alkali burn in NUCKS knockout (NKO) and NUCKS wild-type (NWT) mice. Our data showed that following alkali-injury, inhibition of NUCKS (NKO) accelerated ocular resurfacing and suppressed neovascularization; the cytokine profile of alkali burned corneas in NKO mice showed suppressed expression of inflammation cytokines (IL 1 A &IL 1 B); upregulated expression of antiangiogenic factor (Pigment Epithelium-derived Factor; PEDF); and downregulated expression of angiogenic factor (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor, VEGF); in vitro, following LPS-induced NFκB activation, NKO corneal cells showed reduced expression of IL 6, IP 10 and TNFα. In vitro, corneal epithelial cells showed reduced NF-κb activation on silencing of NUCKS and corresponding NFκB-mediated cytokine expression was reduced.

40|$|AbstractPurposeTo {{elucidate}} the manifestations of ocular {{injuries in the}} colored corn starch dust explosion at a Taiwan water park. MethodsThis is a retrospective, non-comparative, consecutive-interventional case series. Fifty explosion-injury patients on 27 June 2015 treated at Chang-Gung Memorial Hospital, Linkou, were included. Thorough ophthalmic examinations were based on emergent triage and consecutive ophthalmological consultations. Multiple ocular and systemic parameters were assessed. ResultsOf the 100 eyes in the 50 cases reviewed, 22 cases were male and 28 cases were female. The mean age was 22. 08 ± 4. 64 years, and the mean burn {{total body surface area}} (TBSA) of patients was 45. 92 ± 20. 30 %. Of the 50 patients, 20 had Grade 1 <b>ocular</b> <b>burns,</b> and the others were without ocular involvement. Two of the 20 cases that presented Grade 1 <b>ocular</b> <b>burns</b> died within 1 month due to other systemic complications. The most common ocular manifestations among those with ocular injuries included periocular swelling (75 %), followed by conjunctival chemosis (65 %), conjunctival hyperemia (50 %), singed eyelashes (20 %), cornea epithelial defects (10 %), and punctate keratopathy (5 %). It is worth mentioning that one patient developed herpes simplex keratitis due to stress 3 weeks after being burned. Half of the 50 patients had facial burns. Specifically, the patients with a greater TBSA presented more significant ocular-burn manifestations than those patients with lower TBSA.

30|$|The {{temporal}} span {{between the}} initial 2006 burn in August and {{the collection of}} the ground level CBI and <b>ocular</b> <b>burn</b> severity measurements during the following winter and spring may have led to the limited agreement between the 2006 ΔNBR scene and the ground data. The ΔNBR index measures differential changes in soil cover and reflectivity as an indicator of vegetative consumption, and is sensitive to vegetative cover (Key and Benson 2006). The ΔNBR index has been shown to strongly agree with surface measures of burn severity in Florida sandhill and flatwoods sites (Picotte and Robertson 2011). Henry (2008) suggested that the ΔNBR index may not be suitable for application in sand pine scrub given the short vegetative response following fire. The vegetative response to fire in Florida can be very rapid, in some cases with post-fire vegetative fuels loads returning to pre-fire vegetative fuels loads within a few years (Lavoie et al. 2010), suggesting that collecting field plot data even a matter of months following the fire could influence ground plot and remotely sensed data agreement (Wimberly and Reilly 2007). During ground data collection, every effort was made to distinguish between vegetation recovery and vegetation survival. However, in the low severity areas, this was not always possible. Following the 2006 burn, the JPW continued to experience a period of prolonged drought, which may have aided the agreement between ground plots and the remotely sensed imagery by slowing the JPW vegetative recovery; however, an assessment of the effect of this drought on vegetative recovery to fire is unknown.|$|E
40|$|OBJETIVO: Investigar o potencial terapêutico do transplante de membrana amniótica nos casos agudos graves de queimadura ocular química e síndrome de Stevens-Johnson. MÉTODOS: Foram analisados retrospectivamente os prontuários de oito pacientes, com um total de dez olhos, submetidos a transplante de membrana amniótica para tratamento de queimadura ocular química e síndrome de Stevens-Johnson na fase aguda entre janeiro de 1999 e maio de 2008 no Departamento de Oftalmologia da UNIFESP. Dados referentes a sexo, idade, grau da queimadura, etiologia, olho acometido, achados oftalmológicos, extensão da membrana amniótica, operações adicionais, tempo em dias entre a lesão e a cirurgia, acuidade visual antes e depois da cirurgia, defeito epitelial em dias, complicações e tempo de seguimento em meses foram coletados. RESULTADOS: A idade média dos pacientes foi de 35, 7 ± 23, 04 anos, dos quais seis eram homens e dois eram mulheres. Três pacientes (quatro olhos) apresentaram síndrome de Stevens-Johnson e cinco pacientes (seis olhos) apresentaram queimadura ocular química. O defeito epitelial foi cicatrizado em média de 27, 8 ± 4, 7 dias (variando de 20 a 35 dias). Todos os pacientes evoluíram com deficiência límbica em seguimento médio de 7, 8 ± 2, 8 meses (variando entre cinco e doze meses) e quatro olhos desenvolveram simbléfaro. CONCLUSÕES: Os resultados sugerem que o transplante de membrana amniótica representa um aditivo que pode ser realizado nos casos agudos graves de queimadura ocular química e síndrome de Stevens-Johnson com a finalidade de promover a epitelização e suprimir a inflamação e suas consequências, se comparado a outros trabalhos que trataram casos semelhantes com terapia medicamentosa somente. Por outro lado, não é capaz de evitar a deficiência límbica nesses casos, que futuramente necessitarão de transplante de células-tronco do limbo ou outras cirurgias para correção da superfície ocular. PURPOSE: To {{study the}} {{therapeutic}} potential of amniotic membrane transplantation {{in cases of}} severe acute chemical <b>ocular</b> <b>burn</b> and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of eight patients, {{with a total of}} ten eyes, submitted to amniotic membrane transplantation for treatment of ocular chemical burns and Stevens-Johnson syndrome in the acute phase between January 1999 and May 2008 in the Ophthalmology Department of UNIFESP. Data relating to sex, age, degree of chemical burns, etiology, affected eye, ophthalmological findings, extension of amniotic membrane, surgeries, additional time between the injury and surgery in days, visual acuity before and after surgery, epithelial defect healing (days), complications and time of follow-up in months were collected. RESULTS: The average age of patients was 35. 7 ± 23. 04 years, with six men and two women. Three patients (four eyes) had Stevens-Johnson syndrome and five patients (six eyes) had chemical <b>ocular</b> <b>burn.</b> The epithelial defect was healed at an average of 27. 8 ± 4. 7 days (ranging from 20 and 35 days). All patients presented limbal stem cell deficiency in a median follow-up of 7. 8 ± 2. 8 months (ranging from six and twelve months) and four eyes developed symblepharon.

Material and Method: Fifteen patients (21 eyes) with acute <b>ocular</b> <b>burn</b> severity grading of II to IV were retrospectively reviewed. Thirteen eyes were treated with preserved AMP while eight eyes were treated with conventional treatment. Outcomes and complications were evaluated and compared between eyes in the AMP group and the control group with the same severity of burn. Results: In the AMP group, the mean age was 36. 9 + 11. 7 years (range, 20 - 58). The mean follow-up time was 8. 0 + 6. 8 months (range, 1 - 20). Complete epithelialization was achieved in 69. 2 % (9 / 13 eyes) in total, 100 % (5 / 5 eyes), 100 % (3 / 3 eyes) and 20 % (1 / 5 eyes) in grade II, III and IV respectively. Mean epithelial healing time in the AMP group was 10. 4 + 5. 8 days (range, 4 - 20). Comparison of grade 2 and 3 burns showed that the AMP group in which patching was performed within 5 days resulted in faster epithelial healing, less corneal haze and limbal deficiency than in the group in which patching was performed after 5 days, and the control group (mean epithelial defect 7. 0 + 2. 0, 19. 5 + 0. 7, 9. 9 + 10. 8 days respectively).

Methods: This was a prospective study including all cases of BKPro implantation for ocular burns at the External Diseases and Cornea Service of the Federal University of São Paulo, between February 2008 and February 2010. Ten patients (10 eyes) were enrolled. Procedures performed to manage ocular injury were identified, and data were collected regarding patients' ocular history, surgical procedure(s) performed, and postoperative outcomes, including visual acuity, retention, complications and required surgical procedures. Results: A total of 11 Type 1 BKPro were implanted in 10 eyes of 10 patients. the mean follow-up period was 25. 7 +/- 10. 8 months. Preoperative best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) ranged from count fingers to light perception. Postoperative BCVA was better than 20 / 200 in 90 % of the patients and better than 20 / 60 in 60 % of the patients. the overall BKPro retention rate was 90 %. the most common complications were retroprosthetic membrane formation (50 %) and persistent corneal epithelial defect evolving to corneal melting (40 %). Patients who underwent ocular surface procedures such as limbal transplantation prior to BKPRo implantation had a lower incidence of corneal melting/thinning (p= 0. 07), although this was not statistically significant.

40|$|Alkali burn {{injury is}} a true ocular {{emergency}} of the conjunctiva and cornea that requires immediate precision. Lack of an immediate therapy {{can lead to a}} substantial damage in the ocular surface and anterior segment further causing visual impairment and disfigurement. We explored the regenerative capability of dominant negative survivin protein (SurR 9 -C 84 A) and histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin-A (TSA) in vivo, in a rat alkali burn model. A topical insult in rat eyes with NaOH led to degradation of the conjunctival and corneal epithelium. The integrity of the conjunctival and corneal tissue was increased by TSA and SurR 9 -C 84 A by improving the clathrin and claudin expressions. Wound healing was initiated by an increase in TGF-beta- 1 and, increased endogenous survivin which inhibited apoptosis post-TSA and SurR 9 -C 84 A treatments. Protein expressions of fibronectin and alpha-integrin 5 were found to increase promoting corneal integrity. The cytokine analysis confirmed increased expressions of IL- 1 beta, IL- 6, IL- 12, IL- 13, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, GMCSF, Rantes, and MMP- 2 in injured cornea, which were found to be significantly downregulated by the combined treatment of SurR 9 -C 84 A and TSA. The ocular and systemic pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were measured post-topical ocular administration of TSA and SurR 9 -C 84 A. The SurR 9 -C 84 A and TSA sustained relatively longer in the cornea, conjunctiva, and aqueous humor than in the tear fluid and plasma. Our results confirmed that a combination of TSA with SurR 9 -C 8 A worked in synergy and showed a promising healing and anti-inflammatory effect {{in a very short time}} against alkali burn. Therefore, a combination of TSA and SurR 9 -C 84 A can fulfill the need for an immediate response to wound healing in alkali burnt cornea. We also synthesized ultra-small chitosan nanoparticles (USC-NPs) targeted with alpha-SMA antibodies that can be used for delivery of TSA and SurR 9 -C 84 A specifically to the <b>ocular</b> <b>burn</b> site...|$|E

Results: Greater vascularization and opacity appeared in the animals that were treated with saline than in those treated with subconjunctival triamcinolone (vascularization: 7 days, P = 0. 0107; 14 days, P = 0. 0099; and 21 days, P = 0. 0088; opacity: 7 days, P = 0. 0079; 14 days, P = 0. 0112; and 21 days, P = 0. 0255). These results were also compatible with the morphological and statistical analyses, which revealed a more intense inflammatory process in the group treated with saline (P = 0. 0317). No complications, such as corneal melting, perforation, or infection, were observed. Conclusions: Subconjunctival injection of triamcinolone may be a therapeutic option for the treatment of acute <b>ocular</b> <b>burn</b> because it reduced the corneal inflammatory process, opacity, and vascularization, with no apparent clinical changes in the general state of the animal.

40|$|A {{series of}} <b>ocular</b> HF <b>burns</b> was {{produced}} in rabbits in order to clarify {{the nature of the}} injury and to provide a description of the animal model. Burned eyes were evaluated clinically and allowed to progress for up to 65 days before histologic examination. The mechanism of HF toxicity was investigated through the study of burns produced by chemicals chosen to mimic its pH effects, osmotic effects, and effects of the free fluoride ion alone. The severe progressive caustic effect of HF on the eyes was found to depend on the combination of pH and the toxic effects of the free fluoride ion, together causing extensive dose-related damage to superficial and deep structures of the eye. Mild <b>burns</b> caused reversible <b>ocular</b> injury; whereas more severe burns lead to corneal stromal scarring, vascularization, edema, formation of calcific band keratopathy plus iris and ciliary body fibrosis. An investigation was made of potential treatments for experimental <b>ocular</b> HF <b>burns</b> in rabbits. Topical ointments containing MgO or MgSO 4 and irrigations with or subconjunctival injections of H 2 O or solutions containing NaCl, MgCl 2, CaCl 2, LaCl 3, hyamine, zephiran, calcium gluconate or a mixture of divalent metal ions were tested for toxicity and for therapeutic value in <b>ocular</b> HF <b>burns.</b> Immediate single irrigation with H 2 O, NaCl or MgCl 2 solution was most effective. Other therapeutic agents commonly used in HF skin burn therapy were either too toxic in normal eyes or caused additive damage to burned eyes...|$|R
40|$|International audiencePurpose: The Ex Vivo Eye Irritation Test (EVEIT) is used {{to analyse}} the {{clinical}} observations of corneal calcification attributed {{to the presence of}} phosphate within applied eye drops used in treating glaucoma, Still-Chauffard syndrome, <b>ocular</b> <b>burns</b> and dry eyes. Method: Live corneas from abattoir rabbit eyes were cultured in order to study epithelial healing following mechanical abrasion of the corneal surface combined with repeated exposure to various eye drops. Results: Obvious corneal calcification of the wound area along with a complete epithelial healing covering the calcified area was observed following exposure to phosphate hyaluronate eye drops. Epithelial healing without calcification was achieved using citrate hyaluronate eye drops. Conclusion: Clinical observations show that topical use of artificial tears containing phosphate on injured eyes may lead to sight-threatening corneal complications. Simulation of such treatment conditions by the EVEIT convincingly demonstrate that changes in the composition of the pharmaceutically used treatments can prevent this undesired side effect. Although considerable healing was achieved during the repeated application of eye drops, using either phosphate or citrate buffered, only the drops containing citrate did not develop corneal calcification on the eye. We therefore recommend discontinuing the use of phosphate buffered eye drops, or other topically applied solutions, to avoid further injury to the patient...|$|R
40|$|It {{has only}} been {{a quarter of a}} century since the {{discovery}} of adult stem cells at the human corneo-scleral limbus. These limbal stem cells are responsible for generating a constant and unending supply of corneal epithelial cells throughout life, thus maintaining a stable and uniformly refractive corneal surface. Establishing this hitherto unknown association between ocular surface disease and limbal dysfunction helped usher in therapeutic approaches that successfully addressed blinding conditions such as <b>ocular</b> <b>burns,</b> which were previously considered incurable. Subsequent advances in ocular surface biology through basic science research have translated into innovations that have made the surgical technique of limbal stem cell transplantation simpler and more predictable. This review recapitulates the basic biology of the limbus and the rationale and principles of limbal stem cell transplantation in ocular surface disease. An evidence-based algorithm is presented, which is tailored to clinical considerations such as laterality of affliction, severity of limbal damage and concurrent need for other procedures. Additionally, novel findings in the form of factors influencing the survival and function of limbal stem cells after transplantation and the possibility of substituting limbal cells with epithelial stem cells of other lineages is also discussed. Finally this review focuses on the future directions in which both basic science and clinical research in this field is headed...|$|R

40|$|Damage to {{the cornea}} from {{chemical}} burns {{is a serious}} clinical problem that often leads to permanent visual impairment. Because transforming growth factor (TGF) -β has been implicated in the response to corneal injury, we evaluated the effects of altered TGF-β signaling in a corneal alkali burn model using mice treated topically with an adenovirus (Ad) expressing inhibitory Smad 7 and mice with a targeted deletion of the TGF-β/activin signaling mediator Smad 3. Expression of exogenous Smad 7 in burned corneal tissue resulted in reduced activation of Smad signaling and nuclear factor-κB signaling via RelA/p 65. Resurfacing of the burned cornea by conjunctival epithelium and its differentiation to cornea-like epithelium were both accelerated in Smad 7 -Ad-treated corneas with suppressed stromal ulceration, opacification, and neovascularization 20 days after injury. Introduction of the Smad 7 gene suppressed invasion of monocytes/macrophages and expression of monocyte/macrophage chemotactic protein- 1, TGF-β 1, TGF-β 2, vascular endothelial growth factor, matrix metalloproteinase- 9, and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase- 2 and abolished the generation of myofibroblasts. Although acceleration of healing of the burned cornea was also observed in mice lacking Smad 3, the effects on epithelial and stromal healing were less pronounced than those in corneas treated with Smad 7. Together {{these data suggest that}} overexpression of Smad 7 may have effects beyond those of simply blocking Smad 3 /TGF-β signaling and may represent an effective new strategy for treatment of <b>ocular</b> <b>burns...</b>|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} the clinical findings, treatment modalities and long-term prognosis {{of chemical and}} thermal burns of the cornea. Materials and Methods: Twenty-one patients (27 eyes) who were followed at two centers for corneal chemical and thermal burns between 2001 and 2013 were included. Eyes were grouped into four grades according to the severity of burn using Roper-Hall classification. Age, gender, type of burn, follow-up duration, corrected visual acuity before and after treatment, treatment modalities and complications were recorded. Patients received medical treatment or combined surgical treatment including amniotic membrane transplantation (AMT), conjunctivolimbal autograft/allograft (CLAU/CLAL) transplantation, keratolimbal allograft (KLAL) or penetrating keratoplasty (PKP). Results: Patients had {{a mean age of}} 27. 1 ± 15. 5 years (range, 6 months- 56 years) and were followed for a mean 63. 2 ± 58. 6 weeks (4 - 160 weeks). Significant improvement was achieved with medical treatment alone in patients with grade I (4 eyes) and 2 burns (8 eyes). Patients with grade III burns (11 eyes) underwent CLAU (6 eyes), combined AMT/CLAU (3 eyes), AMT/CLAL (1 eye), or CLAL+PKP (1 eye), while patients with grade IV burns (4 eyes) had keratectomy+CLAL/AMT (1 eye), keratectomy+CLAL+PKP after recurrence with CLAU/AMT (1 eye), CLAU+PKP (1 eye), and AMT/KLAL+PKP (1 eye). All patients except the latter showed ocular surface stabilization with these procedures. Conclusion: <b>Ocular</b> <b>burns</b> cause severe impairment of the ocular surface. It is possible to achieve good results with appropriate medical treatment and surgeries including ocular surface reconstruction. (Turk J Ophthalmol 2015; 45 : 182 - 187...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Ocular</b> <b>burns</b> cause {{depletion}} of limbal stem cells, {{which leads to}} corneal opacification and visual loss. Autologous cultured epithelial cells can restore damaged corneas, but this technology is still developing. We sought to establish a culture system that allows preservation of limbal stem cells and preparation of manageable epithelial sheets and to investigate whether such cultures can permanently restore total limbal stem cell deficiency. METHODS: We selected a homogeneous group of patients whose limbal cell deficiency was evaluated by scoring {{the gravity of the}} clinical picture and the keratin expression pattern. Stem cells, obtained from the limbus of the contralateral eye, were cultivated onto a fibrin substrate and their preservation was evaluated by clonal analysis. Fibrin cultures were grafted onto damaged corneas. RESULTS: Fibrin-cultured limbal stem cells were successful in 14 of 18 patients. Re-epithelialization occurred within the first week. Inflammation and vascularization regressed within the first 3 - 4 weeks. By the first month, the corneal surface was covered by a transparent, normal-looking epithelium. At 12 - 27 months follow-up, corneal surfaces were clinically and cytologically stable. Three patients had a penetrating keratoplasty approximately 1 year after restoration of their corneal surface. Their visual acuity improved from light perception or counting fingers to 0. 8 - 1. 0. CONCLUSIONS: Preservation of limbal stem cells in culture gives new perspectives on the treatment of ocular disorders characterized by complete limbal stem cell deficiency. The multicenter nature of this study and the handiness and ease of long-distance transportation of the fibrin-cultured epithelial sheets suggest that this technology can now be widely applied...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} the effect {{and value of}} amniotic membrane patches and grafts for acute <b>ocular</b> surface <b>burn</b> at different degrees. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 28 cases(28 eyes) affected by ocular chemical or thermal burn with different degree were included in our hospital from March 2007 to March 2012. Amniotic membrane patched was undergone in 13 eyes with fresh amnion that the patients corneal burns degree Ⅱ or Ⅲ with partial limbal buns at degree Ⅳ. Amniotic membrane grafts was performed in 15 eyes with fresh amnion that the patients all corneal burns at degree Ⅲ with the whole limbal necrosis without severe eyelid defect. The follow-up time ranged 6 ～ 24 mo. The postoperative visual acuity, the condition of amniotic membrane transplant, renovation of cornea and complications were observed. RESULTS: Postoperative corrected visual acuity was improved in 20 eyes(71 %), it was not changed in 5 eyes(18 %), the visual acuity declined in 3 eyes(11 %). The amniotic membrane survived in 23 eyes and the survival rate was up to 82 %. The cornea of 4 eyes recovered to transparent, nebula emceed in 8 eyes eventually, corneal macula emerged in 10 eyes, 4 eyes ended up with leukoma, 2 eyes developed corneal melting after therapy, then received lamellar keratoplasty. Corneal surface become epithelization after amnion patches or grafts, but any of them have recurrent epithelial erosion, and become stable epithalization after repeat operation.

40|$|Sulfuric acid is a colorless, odorless liquid, {{which causes}} typical injury {{patterns}} such as cutaneous and <b>ocular</b> <b>burns,</b> respiratory complications from inhalation, and ingestion injuries (coagulative necrosis of the mucosa, gastric and intestinal perforations) with significant dermal and mucosal injury {{because of its}} corrosive action. Most injuries caused by sulfuric acid ingestion are accidental, especially in the pediatric population. Intentional cases of ingestion have rarely been reported in adults {{as a method of}} suicide following a major depressive disorder. In this paper, we report the case of a 44 -year-old woman who was found dead outside her home with a retained fillet knife embedded in her left chest wall and cutaneous chemical burns extending from her mouth down her chin and anterior torso. During the crime scene investigation, a half empty bottle of chemical drain cleaner containing concentrated sulfuric acid was found next to her body. An autopsy revealed chemical burns to the tongue, trachea, larynx, pharynx and esophagus along with a blackish fluid in the peritoneal cavity. Histological analyses showed extensive corrosive changes in the gastrointestinal tract. Toxicological screening of blood and urine samples was negative; gastric contents contained a high quantity of concentrated (≈ 96 %) sulfuric acid with a pH value of < 1. 0. Death was attributed to shock following sulfuric acid ingestion. Circumstantial evidence and autopsy findings proved that the manner of death was suicidal. Complex suicides can be challenging for the forensic pathologist because of the plurality of methods used. The authors highlight the importance of systematical exhaustive postmortem investigation in order to ascertain the cause and manner of death in cases of planned complex suicide...|$|R
