40|$|AbstractA {{problem of}} no-wait {{scheduling}} of zero–one time operations without allowing inserted idle times is {{considered in the}} case of open, flow and mixed shop. We show that {{in the case of}} <b>open</b> <b>shop</b> this problem is equivalent to the problem of consecutive coloring the edges of a bipartite graph G. In the cases of flow shop and mixed shop this problem is equivalent to the problem of consecutive coloring the edges of G with some additional restrictions. Moreover, in all shops under consideration the problem is shown to be strongly NP-hard. Since such colorings are not always possible when the number of processors m> 3 for <b>open</b> <b>shop</b> (m> <b>2</b> for flow <b>shop),</b> we concentrate on special families of scheduling graphs, e. g. paths and cycles, trees, complete bipartite graphs, which can be optimally colored in polynomial time...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, three metaheuristics are {{proposed}} for solving {{a class of}} job <b>shop,</b> <b>open</b> <b>shop,</b> and mixed shop scheduling problems.

The computational results show that the proposed algorithms perform extremely well on all these three types of shop scheduling problems. The results also reveal that the mixed shop problem is relatively easier to solve than the job shop problem {{due to the fact that}} the scheduling procedure becomes more flexible by the inclusion of more <b>open</b> <b>shop</b> jobs in the mixed shop...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Unlike {{implemented}} in other production systems, dispatching in an <b>open</b> <b>shop</b> not only {{takes into account}} the job priority at each machine but also the selection of the next ma-chine for any jobs leaving the current machine. The control mechanism for scheduling in an <b>open</b> <b>shop</b> can be utilized by a dispatching rule-pair that consists of a machine-selection rule and a job-dispatching rule. This study conducts a steady-state simulation comparison on the perform-ance of 39 dispatching rule-pairs in <b>open</b> <b>shops.</b> We find that using NINQ as the ma-chine-selection rule can minimize the mean flowtime of jobs while using LINQ as the ma-chine-selection rule can minimize mean tardiness of jobs for most cases. The choice of the best dispatching rule-pair depends on the selected performance criterion as well as the system’s con-figurations such as utilization factor, number of machines, and processing time distribution of jobs. Finally, under similar system configurations, the best job-dispatching rule in an <b>open</b> <b>shop</b> is different from that of a job shop...|$|R

Extensive computational results are presented for problems with up to 50 jobs and 50 machines, respectively. The quality of the solutions is evaluated by a lower bound for the corresponding preemptive <b>open</b> <b>shop</b> problem and by an alternative estimate of mean flow time. We observe that the recommendation of an appropriate constructive algorithm strongly depends on the ratio n/m.
