5|$|Vorster was so {{angered by}} the raid that he {{immediately}} terminated Operation Polo, under which members of the South African forces had secretly stayed on in Rhodesia after their official withdrawal in August 1975. This and the general international condemnation after Nyadzonya made the Rhodesians very hesitant to authorise any more external operations, even covertly, while the peace process crawled on during {{the last months of}} 1976. Two further unsuccessful rounds of negotiations took place between September and December: first the United States Secretary <b>of</b> <b>State</b> <b>Henry</b> <b>Kissinger</b> thrashed out a deal, which in September the Rhodesians accepted and the nationalists rejected, then from October to December 1976 the government and nationalist parties took part in the abortive British-mediated Geneva Conference.|$|E
5|$|On October 10, 1973, Agnew {{appeared}} before the federal court in Baltimore, and pled no contest to one felony charge, tax evasion, for the year 1967. Richardson agreed {{that there would be}} no further prosecution of Agnew, and released a 40-page summary of the evidence. Agnew was fined $10,000 and placed on three years' unsupervised probation. At the same time, he submitted a formal letter of resignation to the Secretary <b>of</b> <b>State,</b> <b>Henry</b> <b>Kissinger,</b> and sent a letter to Nixon stating he was resigning in the best interest of the nation. Nixon responded with a letter concurring that the resignation was necessary to avoid a lengthy period of division and uncertainty, and applauding Agnew for his patriotism and dedication to the welfare of the US. House Minority Leader Gerald Ford, who would be Agnew's successor as vice president (and Nixon's as president) recalled that he heard the news while on the House floor and his first reaction was disbelief, his second sadness.|$|E

50|$|United <b>States</b> Secretary <b>of</b> Defense Donald Rumsfeld {{began to}} make speeches arguing that the Soviets were {{ignoring}} Secretary <b>of</b> <b>State</b> <b>Henry</b> <b>Kissinger's</b> treaties and secretly building up their weapons, {{with the intention of}} attacking the United States. Rumsfeld used his position to persuade President Ford to set up an independent inquiry. Rumsfeld and Paul Wolfowitz wanted to create a much more severe view of the Soviet Union, Soviet intentions, Soviet views about fighting and winning a nuclear war.|$|R

After a series of talks between American President Gerald Ford and Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko in Washington and American Secretary <b>of</b> <b>State</b> <b>Henry</b> <b>Kissinger's</b> visit to Moscow, Ford traveled to Vladivostok to meet with Soviet General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev directly. The two heads <b>of</b> <b>state</b> agreed to terms that would limit both nations an [...] "equal aggregate number" [...] of various weapons, including strategic nuclear delivery vehicles (SNDVs), intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), and submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) fitted with multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs).|$|R
25|$|After {{losing control}} of Mount Hermon on October 6 and failing to {{recapture}} it on October 8, the IDF, and the Golani Brigade in particular, grew determined to recapture it. Its loss levied a heavy toll on Israel's intelligence gathering during the war. At 10:15 PM on October 19, Israeli Chief of Staff (Ramatkal) David Elazar {{was on his way}} to the Israeli Northern Command to monitor an attack on the Hermon. At that time, the General Staff learned <b>of</b> the United <b>States</b> Secretary <b>of</b> <b>State</b> <b>Henry</b> <b>Kissinger's</b> notification <b>of</b> an immediate ceasefire to the war. Elazar was asked to return to Tel Aviv, where he met with the Defense Minister, Moshe Dayan, and they agreed that recapturing the Hermon was top priority.|$|R

25|$|United States Secretary <b>of</b> <b>State</b> <b>Henry</b> <b>Kissinger</b> also {{condemned}} these policy {{positions on}} a short visit to India in July 1971, particularly when Subrahmanyam told Kissinger that he {{expected him to be}} more considerate on account of Kissinger's own experience with genocide, having himself escaped the Holocaust. In spite of these many objections the substance of Subrahmanyam's views swiftly gained ground and led to the Indian government's examination of various military options. These culminated in India's December 1971 war with Pakistan, its victory, and the subsequent creation of Bangladesh.|$|E
25|$|He {{felt the}} Turks had overstepped {{the bounds of}} {{legitimate}} NATO interests in Cyprus and suggested that the United States might have to reexamine its military aid program to Turkey. During this time, President Gerald R.

Lair channeled the resulting intelligence back to Washington, DC. Both President Gerald Ford and Secretary <b>of</b> <b>State</b> <b>Henry</b> <b>Kissinger</b> were thus made privy to details of the maneuvering of possible successors to the Great Helmsman. Despite this, CIA management told Lair they had no domestic assignment for him after Bangkok. Lair decided to retire. He was honored by King Bhumipol with a private audience before he departed.|$|E
25|$|After being {{defeated}} {{in his home}} country's presidential election, he was appointed to succeed U Thant as United Nations Secretary-General the same year.

The brief letter read: “I hereby resign the Office of President of the United States.” Kissinger would subsequently sign his initials, acknowledging that he had received it, and write the time—11:35a.m.—denoting when Nixon's presidency officially ended. Then, with his family at his side, Nixon gave an emotional farewell talk in the East Room to an assembly of White House staff and Cabinet officials.

5000|$|As National Security Advisor for Ronald Reagan, Clark {{frequently}} {{consulted with}} and visited {{with the three}} living former presidents, Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and Gerald Ford, leaving a briefing book with them on subjects important to them.

50|$|The group focused {{mainly on}} bomb attacks and {{extortion}} attempts targeting American and British civilian and economic interests in Lebanon, at times claiming that its actions were either {{carried out in}} protest for US Secretary <b>of</b> <b>State</b> <b>Henry</b> <b>Kissinger's</b> 1974 diplomatic Middle Eastern Tour or to force British-owned Lebanese companies to distribute freely large amounts of food to impoverished local families. It is still unclear who financed and armed the ACO though the most likely suspect at the time {{would have been the}} Palestinians (either the mainstream PLO or the Rejectionist Front factions), who certainly provided weapons, explosives and training at their Bekaa Valley facilities. When the Lebanese civil war finally broke out in April 1975, it seems that the group opted for not joining the Lebanese National Movement and took no part in the savage street battles at Beirut and elsewhere. Instead, they shifted their attention to Syria, where their leaders were arrested and tortured in July that year and then {{sentenced to life in prison}} by Syrian courts.|$|R
5000|$|By the 1970s International Affairs had transitioned {{from acting}} solely as {{a record of}} Chatham House speeches to also {{publishing}} high-calibre scholarly articles, for which the journal gained increasing renown. Works {{by the likes of}} Hedley Bull, Joseph Nye [...] and Susan Strange exemplified this new approach, including Strange’s influential article ‘International economics and international relations: a case of mutual neglect.’ Indeed Strange was a prolific regular contributor to the journal due to her links with Chatham House - publishing 81 articles and book reviews between 1950 and 1996 [...] During the 1980s this new reputation for academic research was combined with a focus on current affairs. [...] Articles on Afghanistan, Iran and the Falklands War appeared alongside more theoretical contributions to the field of International Relations.

In 1982 the former US Secretary <b>of</b> <b>State</b> <b>Henry</b> <b>Kissinger’s</b> Chatham House speech appeared in the journal, titled ‘Reflections on a partnership: British and American attitudes to postwar foreign policy.’ ...|$|R
