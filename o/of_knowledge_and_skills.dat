2500|$|The {{test was}} {{announced}} because the Texas Assessment <b>of</b> <b>Knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>Skills</b> (commonly referred to its acronym TAKS) assessment was repealed by Texas Senate Bill 1031 in spring 2007. The bill called for secondary schools (for grades 9-11) to take end of course assessments {{every time a}} student {{was at the end}} of taking a course, instead of taking general [...] "core subject" [...] tests. STAAR mostly replaced the TAKS in the spring of 2012, although students who entered 10th grade before the 2011-2012 school year continued to take the TAKS. This process is part of the TAKS to STAAR transition plan. In 2015 the last students had taken the TAKS test, so the first students will graduate with a completed STAAR end of course assessments. However, many policies from the TAKS are still withheld in the STAAR's policies for practical purposes.|$|E

Increasingly, emphasis is placed upon 'transversal' or 'horizontal' skills (such as 'learning to learn' or 'social competences'), which cut across traditional subject boundaries, and therefore call into question traditional ways of designing the Teacher Education curriculum (and traditional school curricula and ways of working in the classroom).|$|R

2500|$|This term 'scaffolding' is {{a useful}} metaphor {{that is used to}} symbolise the process of {{supporting}} a learner {{in the early stages of}} the learning process – as the walls get higher – until there is sufficient evidence <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>skills</b> having been acquired, to then be able to remove that scaffolding so the learner is able to 'stand alone', or be effectively independent enough to continue learning 'alone'. In a similar way, there is a gradual dismantling of the scaffolding as the 'job' becomes more secure and so there is a gradual release of responsibility from the teacher to the learner. As scaffolding is temporary, so too are the lessons that are constructed to help students as they embark into unfamiliar thinking. As noted by Pearson and Gallagher, [...] "The critical stage of the model is the 'guided practice,' the stage in which the teacher gradually releases task responsibility to the students." [...] As such, these lessons eventually fade away as students become gradually more comfortable with the learning and are able to work without the necessary guidance of the teacher.|$|E

This study investigated the perceptions of nursing deans concerning the level of microcomputer literacy currently expected of students in baccalaureate nursing programs. The deans identified in this study represent baccalaureate nursing programs accredited by the National League of Nursing (NLN). This study also identified deans' plans for future implementation <b>of</b> microcomputer <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>skills</b> for their baccalaureate nursing programs. A questionnaire was mailed to all 398 listed deans of NLN accredited baccalaureate nursing programs throughout the United States. Of those distributed, 295 (74. 1 % return rate) were completed, returned, and identified as usable questionnaires. Part I of the questionnaire consisted of 10 items requesting demographic data. Part II of the questionnaire requested participants to indicate the level <b>of</b> microcomputer <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>skills</b> currently expected <b>of</b> their students and the level of future implementation of microcomputer instruction being planned for their nursing programs. Frequencies, percentages and medians were tabulated. The chi square goodness of fit, Spearman rho, and Mann-Whitney U test were used to test hypotheses. Conclusions based on the findings of the study were as follows: (1) deans of baccalaureate nursing programs currently expected low levels <b>of</b> microcomputer <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>skills</b> for students; (2) they are planning more implementation <b>of</b> microcomputer <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>skills</b> for the future; (3) the proportion of nursing faculty with microcomputer skills was significantly related to the level <b>of</b> microcomputer <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>skills</b> currently expected <b>and</b> the plans for future implementation of microcomputer instruction; (4) the number of microcomputers available was significantly related to the level <b>of</b> microcompter <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>skills</b> currently expected <b>and</b> the plans for future implementation of microcomputer instruction; (5) the number of software packages available was significantly related to the level <b>of</b> microcomputer <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>skills</b> currently expected; (6) the presence of a faculty member responsible for coordinating microcomputer instruction was significantly related to the level <b>of</b> microcomputer <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>skills</b> currently expected...|$|R
