50|$|People {{have used}} <b>olive</b> <b>presses</b> since Greeks first began {{pressing}} olives over 5,000 years ago. Roman <b>olive</b> <b>presses</b> survive {{to the present}} time, with a notable collection present at Volubilis in Morocco. An <b>olive</b> <b>press</b> works by applying pressure to olive paste to separate the liquid oil and vegetation water from the solid material. The oil and vegetation water are then separated by standard decantation.|$|R
40|$|The <b>olive</b> <b>presses</b> at Idalion, a city-kingdom on the Eastern Mediterranean {{island of}} Cyprus, exhibit an {{amalgamation}} of Levantine and Greek socio-economic and religious practices that were representative of Mediterranean culture at large. Idalion's <b>olive</b> <b>presses</b> illustrate the different uses {{of olive oil}} and how those uses reflected the community's unique atmosphere by combining both Greek and Levantine culture. The location of an <b>olive</b> <b>press,</b> {{as well as the}} artifacts found nearby, convey its use. Presses in the Lower City North produced oil as part of the cottage industry present in the area, while the press inside the ancient sanctuary on the East Acropolis provided oil for religious requirements. Aerial photography, maps, and photos provide the orientation of Cyprus within the Mediterranean and also Idalion within Cyprus, showing the geographical circumstances within which the city-kingdom became an important economic and religious center. This thesis will use photographs, architectural drawings, and illustrations confirm how each <b>olive</b> <b>press</b> was used. The physical remains of <b>olive</b> <b>press</b> installations at Tel Dan, Halieis, The Hill of Agios Georgios, and Myrtou-Pyghades each illustrate a different aspect of Greek or Levantine olive oil culture in the Mediterranean. The aspects, exhibited individually at the above sites, are all found present at Idalion. The <b>olive</b> <b>presses</b> illustrate Idalion's unique multi-cultural environment created by the social, religious, and economic implications of its location within Cyprus and the larger Mediterranean sphere. This study of the <b>olive</b> <b>presses</b> at Idalion opens an ethnographic window through which the effects of the cultural dynamic at Idalion had on the community in the Cypriot Bronze Age...|$|R

5000|$|The term [...] "monopoly" [...] first {{appears in}} Aristotle's Politics. Aristotle {{describes}} Thales of Miletus's cornering {{of the market}} in <b>olive</b> <b>presses</b> as a monopoly (μονοπωλίαν).|$|R
2500|$|One of the {{earliest}} written records of futures trading is in Aristotle's Politics. [...] He {{tells the story of}} Thales, a poor philosopher from Miletus who developed a [...] "financial device, which involves a principle of universal application". [...] Thales used his skill in forecasting and predicted that the olive harvest would be exceptionally good the next autumn. Confident in his prediction, he made agreements with local olive-press owners to deposit his money with them to guarantee him exclusive use of their <b>olive</b> <b>presses</b> when the harvest was ready. Thales successfully negotiated low prices because the harvest was in the future and no one knew whether the harvest would be plentiful or pathetic and because the olive-press owners were willing to hedge against the possibility of a poor yield. When the harvest-time came, and a sharp increase in demand {{for the use of the}} <b>olive</b> <b>presses</b> outstripped supply (availability of the presses), he sold his future use contracts of the <b>olive</b> <b>presses</b> at a rate of his choosing, and made a large quantity of money. It should be noted, however, that this is a very loose example of futures trading and, in fact, more closely resembles an option contract, given that Thales was not obliged to use the <b>olive</b> <b>presses</b> if the yield was poor.|$|R
