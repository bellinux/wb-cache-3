40|$|In multivariate {{stratified}} random sampling, {{for practical}} purposes {{we need an}} <b>allocation</b> which is <b>optimum</b> in some sense for all characteristics because the individual <b>optimum</b> <b>allocations</b> usually differ widely unless the characteristics are highly correlated. Cochran (1977) suggested the use of characteristic wise average of individual <b>optimum</b> <b>allocations</b> as a compromise allocation for correlated characteristics. For uncorrelated ones, many authors have suggested various criteria to work out an <b>optimum</b> compromise <b>allocation.</b> For example a compromise criterion may be to minimize the total loss in efficiency of the estimate due to not using the individual <b>optimum</b> <b>allocations.</b> When auxiliary information is also available, it is customary {{to use it to}} increase the precision of the estimates.

The proposed scheme efficiently combines {{signals from the}} direct and multiple relay links to improve communication reliability. Bit-errorrate (BER) analysis for M-ary differential phase shift keying is provided as performance measure of the proposed scheme, and <b>optimum</b> power <b>allocation</b> is investigated. While the exact BER formulation of the proposed scheme is not available currently, we provide as a performance benchmark a tight BER formulation based on optimum combining weights.

40|$|AbstractA new method, Collaborative Allocation (CA), is {{proposed}} {{to solve the}} large-scale <b>optimum</b> <b>allocation</b> problem in aircraft conceptual design. According to the characteristics of <b>optimum</b> <b>allocation</b> in aircraft conceptual design. The principle and mathematical model of CA are established. The <b>optimum</b> <b>allocation</b> problem is decomposed into one main optimization problem and several sub-optimization problems. A group of design requirements for subsystems are provided by the main system respectively, and the subsystems execute their own optimizations or further provide the detailed design requirements to the bottom components of aircraft, such as spars, ribs and skins, etc. The subsystems minimize the discrepancy between their own local variables and the corresponding allocated values, and then return the optimization results to main optimization. The main optimization is performed to reallocate the design requirements for improving the integration performance and progressing toward the compatibilities among subsystems. CA provides the general <b>optimum</b> <b>allocation</b> architecture and is easy to be carried out. Furthermore, the concurrent computation can also be realized.

Considering the sum capacity as the performance metric, we solve the problem of optimally allocating the total power of each relay node between the transmissions it is assisting. We first obtain the <b>optimum</b> power <b>allocation</b> policies for the relay nodes when the relaying strategies of all source nodes are given. Next, to obtain higher sum capacities, we investigate the <b>optimum</b> power <b>allocation</b> problem jointly with relaying strategy selection.
