Urinary RSR of calcium <b>oxalate</b> was individually calculated using Equil 2. A “theoretical” curve {{of the relationship between}} urinary RSR of calcium <b>oxalate</b> and concentration of calcium or <b>oxalate</b> was obtained at two stability constants for calcium <b>oxalate</b> complex, while varying calcium or <b>oxalate</b> and using group mean values for urinary constituents. ResultsAt the stability constant of 7. 07 × 103, the increase in RSR of calcium <b>oxalate</b> was less marked with calcium than with <b>oxalate.</b> However, at the stability constant of 2. 746 × 103 from the Equil 2 that is considered the “gold standard,” calcium and <b>oxalate</b> were equally effective in increasing RSR of calcium <b>oxalate.</b> The above theoretical curves (relating RSR with calcium or <b>oxalate)</b> were closely approximated by the actual curves constructed with data from individual urine samples.

An understanding of the actual contribution of dietary <b>oxalate</b> to urinary <b>oxalate</b> excretion is important, as it is potentially modifiable. MethodsWe varied the amount of dietary <b>oxalate</b> consumed by a group of adult individuals using formula diets and controlled, solid-food diets with a known <b>oxalate</b> content, determined by a recently developed analytical procedure. Controlled solid-food diets were consumed containing 10, 50, and 250 mg of oxalate/ 2500 kcal, as well as formula diets containing 0 and 180 mg oxalate/ 2500 kcal. Changes in the content of <b>oxalate</b> and other ions were assessed in 24 -hour urine collections. ResultsUrinary <b>oxalate</b> excretion increased as dietary <b>oxalate</b> intake increased. With oxalate-containing diets, the mean contribution of dietary <b>oxalate</b> to urinary <b>oxalate</b> excretion ranged from 24. 4 ± 15. 5 % on the 10 mg/ 2500 kcal/day diet to 41. 5 ± 9. 1 % on the 250 mg/ 2500 kcal/day diet, much higher than previously estimated.

40|$|The {{last step}} in the {{clotting}} process is the con-version of a soluble protein, fibrinogen, into an in-soluble protein, fibrin.

Biggs and Macfarlane (1) observed that the clotting time of mixtures of <b>oxalated</b> plasma and thrombin varied in different conditions. They suggested the possibility that there are factors in plasma which accelerate the thrombin-fibrinogen reaction.

Brdieka in 1933 described the albumin wave by means of electrolysis of protein in Cobalt-salt solution, thence the polarographic albumin wave has been widely employed in the etiologic study of diseases or an aid of their diagnosis. In the present study polarography was employed in 149 patients with gen i t o-urinary diseases. 1. Method a) First reaction : 0. 5 cc of distilled water was added to 0. 5 cc of the <b>oxalated</b> plasma and it was treated with 0. 25 cc of 1 N KOH. Then the wave was obtained with 0. 5 cc of this solution by the polarographic apparatus using Co＋＋ salt buffer solution. b) Second reaction One cc of distilled water was added to 0. 5 cc of the <b>oxalated</b> plasma and it was treated with 0. 1 cc of 1 N KOH. After leave this solution alone for a constant time, lcc of 2 % sulfosalicilic acid was added, and its protein was precipitated by Watman No. 5 filter paper. The wave was then obtained with 0. 05 cc of this solution by the polarographic apparatus using Co＋＋ salt buffer solution. 2. Chemical treatment of the plasma was performed fo r 30 minutes at a temperature between 10 ° and 25 °C. 3. Normal pla s ma albumin wave was shown in Figure 2. 4. The plasma albumine waves of the patients were show n in Figures 3 - 12. 5. Conclusion : Although a change in the polarographic albumin wav e was not specific in a particular disease, the more significant changes that the wave was depressed in the first reaction, while it was elevated in the second reaction were obtained in a group of patients with tumor than in a group of patients without tumor. The changes of the wave were more significant in a group of patients with generalized systemic disease than in a group of patients with localized disesse. The polarography, therefore, is applicable to a supplementary diagnostic procedure from the changes of the waves in both first and second reactions.

40|$|The role {{of calcium}} <b>oxalate</b> {{crystals}} and deposits in UTI pathogenesis {{has not been}} established. The objectives {{of this study were}} to identify bacteria present in pediatric urolithiasis and, using in vitro and in vivo models, to determine the relevance of calcium <b>oxalate</b> deposits during experimental pyelonephritis. Pediatric kidney stones and urine were collected and both cultured and sequenced for bacteria. Bacterial adhesion to calcium <b>oxalate</b> was compared. Murine kidney calcium <b>oxalate</b> deposits were induced by intraperitoneal glyoxalate injection and kidneys were transurethrally inoculated with uropathogenic Escherichia coli to induce pyelonephritis. E. coli of the family Enterobacteriaceae was identified in patients by calcium <b>oxalate</b> stone culture. Additionally Enterobacteriaceae DNA was sequenced from multiple calcium <b>oxalate</b> kidney stones. E. coli selectively aggregated on and around calcium <b>oxalate</b> monohydrate crystals. Mice inoculated with glyoxalate and uropathogenic E. coli had higher bacterial burdens, increased kidney calcium <b>oxalate</b> deposits and an increased kidney innate immune response compared to mice with only calcium <b>oxalate</b> deposits or only pyelonephritis. In a murine model, the presence of calcium <b>oxalate</b> deposits increases pyelonephritis risk, likely due to preferential aggregation of bacteria on and around calcium <b>oxalate</b> crystals. When both calcium <b>oxalate</b> deposits and uropathogenic bacteria were present, calcium <b>oxalate</b> deposit number increased along with renal gene transcription of inner stone core matrix proteins increased. Therefore renal calcium <b>oxalate</b> deposits may be a modifiable risk factor for infections of the kidney and urinary tract. Furthermore, bacteria may be present in calcium <b>oxalate</b> deposits and potentially contribute to calcium <b>oxalate</b> renal disease...|$|R
40|$|<b>Oxalate</b> {{concentration}} in forage plants is important, because it results mineral deficiency in ruminants. Data on <b>oxalate</b> {{concentration in}} forage plants {{in conjunction with}} cutting and uncutting conditions throughout the growing period are limited. This study was aimed to investigate the changes in <b>oxalate</b> and some mineral concentrations of setaria (Setaria sphacelata). The plants were harvested at different stages (vegetative, boot, pre-flowering, flowering and seed) of maturity and at about 50 cm in length of regrowth (second to sixth cuttings) for evaluation of soluble <b>oxalate,</b> insoluble <b>oxalate</b> and some mineral concentrations. Soluble <b>oxalate</b> and total <b>oxalate</b> concentrations, as well as mineral concentrations, decreased with advancing maturity. Both <b>oxalate</b> concentrations (soluble or insoluble) were higher in leaf compared to stem. Soluble <b>oxalate</b> and total <b>oxalate</b> concentrations of regrowth were the highest at third cutting and lowest at sixth cutting. Insoluble <b>oxalate</b> concentration of regrowth was almost similar in all cuttings, except for the sixth cutting. The highest concentrations of potassium, sodium and magnesium of regrowth were observed at third cutting, while the highest concentration of calcium was observed at sixth cutting. A relationship between <b>oxalate</b> and mineral concentrations was partially observed. Results suggest that cutting materials of setaria from June to October could achieve <b>oxalate</b> levels that are toxic to ruminants...|$|R
