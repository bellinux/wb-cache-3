5|$|Coakley {{summed up}} his {{prosecution}} case on September 22. His {{aim was to}} show the court that a conspiracy had taken placethe mass of accounts from officers and men appeared to support the conclusion that ringleaders and agitators had forced a rebellion against authority. Veltmann pointed out that few of the accused had been ordered to load ammunition, meaning {{that they could not}} all be guilty of the charge of disobeying orders. Veltmann stressed that much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>testimony</b> was hearsay and failed to establish a conspiracy or a mutiny. The court, however, seemed to side with Coakley on all points, settling each objection in favor of the prosecution.|$|E
5|$|According to the prosecution's theory, {{the assassin}} shot Goebel from the {{secretary}} of state's office {{on the first floor}} of a building next to the state capitol. However, much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>testimony</b> against the accused men was conflicting, and some of it was later proven to be perjured. Most of the state's judges were Democratic supporters of Goebel and juries were packed with partisan Democrats. The appellate courts, however, were largely Republican, and the convictions returned by the lower courts were often overturned, with the cases being remanded for new trials. Howard was tried and convicted in September 1900, January 1902, and April 1903; his final appeal failed, and he was sentenced to life in prison. Powers was also convicted three times—in July 1900, October 1901, and August 1903; a fourth trial in November 1907 ended in a hung jury. In 1908, Powers and Howard were pardoned by Republican governor Augustus E. Willson. Months later, Willson also issued pardons for former governor Taylor and several others still under indictment. Despite the pardon, Taylor seldom returned to Kentucky; he became an insurance executive in Indiana and died there in 1928. Youtsey, the only defendant not to appeal his sentence, was paroled in 1916 and pardoned in 1919 by Democratic governor James D. Black.|$|E

40|$|Masters of ArtThis thesis {{examines}} how two narrators construe their experiences <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same events differently through the linguistic choices that they make, through a systemic functional analysis, {{as well as}} a genre analysis <b>of</b> two <b>testimonies.</b> <b>The</b> Human Rights Violations (HRV) hearings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) allowed testifiers to tell stories of their experiences during apartheid. <b>The</b> selected <b>testimonies</b> refer to <b>the</b> events that led up to the arrest and eventual torture of Faried Muhammad Ferhelst, as told by himself and his mother, Minnie Louisa Ferhelst. Theframeworks used to analyse <b>the</b> <b>testimonies</b> are drawn from the transitivity and genre theories of Systemic Functional Linguistics. A clausal analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transitivity patterns is used to compare {{the ways in which the}} testifiers construct their identities and roles when recounting their stories. <b>The</b> transitivity analysis <b>of</b> both testimonies shows that both Mrs Ferhelst and Faried Ferhelst construe themselves as the Affected participant through Material, Mental and Verbal clauses, and construe the police as the Causers, mostly through Material clauses. A genre analysis revealed that both <b>testimonies</b> took <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> narratives, in particular the Recount, a typical genre for relating narratives of personal experience. This research project also explores how the original Afrikaans versions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>testimonies</b> differ from <b>the</b> translated English versions, available online on the TRC website. The Afrikaans versions were transcribed by the researcher from audio-visual records. A transitivity analysis reveals that <b>the</b> interpretation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Afrikaans <b>testimonies</b> is fairly accurate, with a minimum loss of meaning. Thus in <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> these <b>testimonies,</b> <b>the</b> actual online record in English is an accurate reflection of their stories. South Afric...|$|R
