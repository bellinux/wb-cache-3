5|$|Emperor {{penguins}} are serially monogamous. They {{have only}} one mate each year, and stay faithful to that mate. However, fidelity between years is only about 15%.

5|$|New Labour {{tended to}} emphasise social justice, {{rather than the}} {{equality}} which {{was the focus of}} previous Labour governments, and challenged the view that social justice and economic efficiency are mutually exclusive. The party's traditional attachment to equality was reduced: Minimum standards and equality <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> were promoted over the equality of outcome. The Commission on Social Justice, set up by John Smith, reported in 1994 that the values of social justice were: equal worth of citizens, equal rights to be able to meet their basic needs, the requirement to spread opportunities as much as possible, and the need to remove unjustified inequalities. The party viewed social justice primarily as the requirement to give citizens equal political and economic liberty and also as the need for social citizenship. It encompasses the need for equal distribution <b>of</b> <b>opportunity,</b> with the caveat that things should not be taken from successful people to give to the unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|A right-arm fast bowler, Halcombe {{moved from}} South Australia to Western Australia after two seasons {{due to a}} lack <b>of</b> <b>opportunity.</b> With more regular {{selection}} on the field, Halcombe was considered a leading contender to become his state's first ever representative for Australia in Test cricket due to his express pace, but his career was derailed after he was no balled for throwing in two consecutive matches in early 1930.|$|E
5|$|At RAF Winthorpe the Ju 88s {{attacked}} bombers {{illuminated by}} the landing lights. Leutnant Arnold Döring of IV./NJG 3 engaged and destroyed two bombers between 01:05 and 01:15 using his Schräge Musik. The British crews that witnessed the action switched off their navigation lights {{and he did not}} engage another bomber successfully. Döring had been told not to return with any ammunition so he engaged any targets <b>of</b> <b>opportunity.</b> He shot up a locomotive and set a wagon on fire. During the ten-minute time-frame Döring had claimed his victories, nine bombers had been destroyed. At 01:05 60 of No. 5 Group's Lancasters were still airborne and further losses were incurred against NJG 5 machines.|$|E

5|$|Eclipses {{can occur}} {{only when the}} Sun is within about 15 to 18 degrees of a node, (10 to 12 degrees for central eclipses). This is {{referred}} to as an eclipse limit. In the time it takes for the Moon to return to a node (draconic month), the apparent position of the Sun has moved about 29 degrees, relative to the nodes. Since the eclipse limit creates a window <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> of up to 36 degrees (24 degrees for central eclipses), it is possible for partial eclipses (or rarely a partial and a central eclipse) to occur in consecutive months.|$|E
5|$|In March 1826, a French-Canadian {{man named}} Methode, his Native American wife, and their {{children}} were gathering maple syrup in present-day Iowa, about twelve miles north of Prairie du Chien, when they were murdered, apparently by a Ho-Chunk raiding party that had been passing through. The murderers evidently had no specific grievance with the victims, who were targets <b>of</b> <b>opportunity.</b> Two Ho-Chunk suspects were arrested by Prairie du Chien militiamen and taken to Fort Crawford. After they escaped, U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Willoughby Morgan seized two Ho-Chunk hostages and demanded that the Ho-Chunk tribe turn over the murderers.|$|E
5|$|In May 1988, Gingrich (along with 77 other House {{members and}} Common Cause) brought ethics charges against Democratic Speaker Jim Wright, who was {{alleged to have}} used a book deal to {{circumvent}} campaign-finance laws and House ethics rules. During the investigation, {{it was reported that}} Gingrich had his own unusual book deal, for Window <b>of</b> <b>Opportunity,</b> in which publicity expenses were covered by a limited partnership. It raised $105,000 from Republican political supporters to promote sales of Gingrich's book. Gingrich's success in forcing Wright's resignation contributed to his rising influence in the Republican caucus.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that for an icy satellite the size of Mimas or Enceladus to enter an 'excited state' of tidal heating and convection, it would need to enter an orbital resonance before it lost too much of its primordial internal heat. Because Mimas, being smaller, would cool more rapidly than Enceladus, its window <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> for initiating orbital resonance-driven convection would have been considerably shorter.|$|E
5|$|Kieswetter played junior cricket for Western Province {{until the}} age of 18, but lack <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> led him to seek an {{alternative}} route in England. He studied at Millfield, where he was noticed by Somerset. The county's lack of a strong wicket-keeper gave Kieswetter his opportunity, and he made his debut for the team early in the 2007 season. Through his Scottish mother, he qualified to play county cricket, and his performances soon generated discussion about his potential to play for England. Around this time, the captain of South Africa, Graeme Smith, invited him to return to play in South Africa but Kieswetter preferred to qualify for England.|$|E
5|$|On 3 December 1944, No. 351 Squadron {{carried out}} a {{successful}} rocket attack against Axis coastal defences on the Island of Lošinj, launching from Vis. This {{was followed by a}} period of scouting and reconnaissance over several Yugoslav regions, hitting targets <b>of</b> <b>opportunity,</b> sometimes escorted and supported by the Spitfires of No. 352 Squadron. No. 351 Squadron ranged widely, interdicting rail and road routes in eastern and western Bosnia and throughout Dalmatia, and attacking Axis maritime traffic off the Adriatic coast and islands. As the year drew to a close, operations became severely hampered by the worsening weather.|$|E

5|$|One of the French squadrons that {{operated}} in the Atlantic campaign of 1806 {{was the result}} <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> rather than strategy. After the Battle of Trafalgar, most of the French survivors had retreated to Cadiz, where they remained until Duckworth's blockade squadron abandoned the port in November 1805. Although Duckworth's ships were replaced by forces under Lord Collingwood, the replacements were inadequate and on 26 February 1806, while the blockade squadron, which had been pulled back {{in the hope of}} luring the French out of the port, had been blown off station, four frigates and a brig escaped. Chased by the British frigate HMS Hydra, Commodore Louis La-Marre-la-Meillerie refused battle and abandoned the brig Furet to the British in his haste to escape.|$|E
5|$|The next raid on Singapore {{took place}} in January 1945. Following reports that Japanese {{warships}} damaged during the Philippines Campaign were being repaired at Singapore, a force of 47 Superfortresses was dispatched from India to attack the AdmiraltyIX Floating Dock {{as well as the}} King's Dock on the island's south coast. These aircraft took off at about midnight on 10January and began to arrive over Singapore at 08:20 on 11January. Only 27 of the attackers struck the docks, and due to heavy anti-aircraft fire from Japanese warships in the Straits of Johor the bombers did not cause any damage. The other aircraft bombed Penang in Malaya, Mergui in Burma and several targets <b>of</b> <b>opportunity,</b> generally without success. Two B-29s were lost during this operation.|$|E
5|$|The {{outbreak}} of the First World War gave Finland a window <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> to achieve this. The Finns sought aid from both the German Empire and the Bolsheviks to that end, and on 6 December 1917, the Senate of Finland declared the country's independence. The new Bolshevik Russian government was weak, and soon the Russian Civil War would break out. Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin could spare no troops or attention for Finland, and consequently, Soviet Russia recognized the new Finnish government just {{three weeks after the}} declaration of independence. In 1918, the Finns fought a short civil war, where the pro-Bolshevik Red Guards were armed by 7,000 to 10,000 Russian troops stationed in Finland.|$|E

50|$|SSMK {{receives}} around 1400 {{letters and}} 200 emails every month on various issues {{that matters to}} young people of Nepal. Among most of the letters, concerns on livelihood and employment opportunities are always received in high number. Nepal has unemployment rate of over 42% and its per capita income is barely $350. So most of youths either migrate to foreign countries or city areas in search <b>of</b> <b>opportunities</b> and jobs.According to many studies and assessments, lack <b>of</b> <b>opportunities</b> and unemployment are the major problem being faced by Nepalese youth. Because <b>of</b> lack <b>of</b> <b>opportunities,</b> young people are compelled to migrate to urban areas or foreign countries. Government estimates that around 600 young people leave for abroad every day in search <b>of</b> work and <b>opportunities.</b> This data excludes {{the number of young}} people who leave without any documentation through India. Because <b>of</b> lack <b>of</b> <b>opportunities,</b> young people not only migrate for opportunities but also are facing other problems like frustration resulting various social problems. In the view of high rates of youth migrating to urban areas or to foreign countries because <b>of</b> lack <b>of</b> <b>opportunities</b> and unemployment in Nepal, SSMK started its spin off radio programme on livelihood called Kamka Kura on May 2007.|$|R
5|$|The {{resulting}} power vacuums in {{the weeks}} following the Japanese surrender, created an atmosphere of uncertainty, but also one <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> for the Republicans. Many pemuda joined pro-Republic struggle groups (badan perjuangan). The most disciplined were soldiers from the Japanese-formed but disbanded Giyugun (PETA) and Heiho groups. Many groups were undisciplined, due to both the circumstances of their formation and what they perceived as revolutionary spirit. In the first weeks, Japanese troops often withdrew from urban areas to avoid confrontations.|$|E
5|$|The {{second part}} of the book {{presents}} evidence that globalization is creating a new class divide: those who are able to move to a different community to take advantage <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> and those who are rooted. This mobile class of people are differentiating urban areas in terms of values, culture, economic specialization, and other factors, and businesses are following the most talented people to these cities despite high land prices and labor costs. Florida also insists that a disproportionate amount of wealth is being generated in those cities which have been successful in attracting the creative class. Finally, globalization has reduced the importance of resource extraction and manufacturing in the economy and increased the importance of fields in which the creative class participate.|$|E
5|$|Article 15 prohibits {{discrimination}} on the grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth, or any of them. This right can be enforced against the State as well as private individuals, with regard to free access to places of public entertainment or places of public resort maintained partly or wholly out of State funds. However, the State is not precluded from making special provisions for women and children or any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens, including the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. This exception has been provided since the classes of people mentioned therein are considered deprived {{and in need of}} special protection. Article 16 guarantees equality <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> in matters of public employment and prevents the State from discriminating against anyone in matters of employment on the grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, descent, place of birth, place of residence or any of them. It creates exceptions for the implementation of measures of affirmative action for the benefit of any backward class of citizens in order to ensure adequate representation in public service, as well as reservation of an office of any religious institution for a person professing that particular religion.|$|E
