5000|$|McPhee {{notes that}} one of the central {{challenges}} to addressing <b>sex</b> <b>tourism</b> is the differing laws and norms regarding normal sexual behavior in sending and receiving countries. Because <b>sex</b> <b>tourism</b> is a transnational issue, it must be addressed beyond the domestic level. <b>Sex</b> <b>tourism</b> also has economic implications for all nations involved. [...] <b>Sex</b> <b>tourism</b> is encouraged by the tourist sector of destination countries, because it draws individuals from wealthier nations with greater amounts of disposable income into poorer nations. This stimulates the economy of these poorer nations. These economic reinforcements are part of the reason <b>sex</b> <b>tourism</b> continues to exist.|$|R
5000|$|Female <b>sex</b> <b>tourism</b> is <b>sex</b> <b>tourism</b> {{by women}} who travel {{intending}} {{to engage in}} sexual activities with a sex worker. Female sex tourists may seek aspects of the sexual relationship not shared by their male counterpart, such as perceived romance and intimacy. Women - especially wealthy, single, older white women - plan their holidays to have romance and sex with a companion {{who knows how to}} make them feel special and give them attention. The prevalence of female <b>sex</b> <b>tourism</b> is significantly lower than male <b>sex</b> <b>tourism.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Child <b>sex</b> <b>tourism</b> (CST) is tourism for {{the purpose}} of {{engaging}} in the prostitution of children, which is commercially facilitated child sexual abuse. The definition of child in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child is [...] "every human being below the age of 18 years". Child <b>sex</b> <b>tourism</b> results in both mental and physical consequences for the exploited children, which may include sexually transmitted infections (including HIV/AIDS), [...] "drug addiction, pregnancy, malnutrition, social ostracism, and possibly death", according to the State Department of the United States. Child <b>sex</b> <b>tourism,</b> part of the multibillion-dollar global <b>sex</b> <b>tourism</b> industry, is a form of child prostitution within the wider issue of commercial sexual exploitation of children. Child <b>sex</b> <b>tourism</b> victimizes approximately 2 million children around the world.

They also state that the expression female <b>sex</b> <b>tourism</b> [...] "serves to perpetuate gender roles and reinforce power relations of male dominance and female subordination, romance tourism in Jamaica provides an arena for change".|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Tourism and Hospitality Management)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2009. The {{potential}} for the <b>sex</b> <b>tourism</b> industry to become legalised in South Africa with the upcoming 2010 FIFA World Cup is an issue which has raised much controversy and {{is now at the}} top of the agenda for debate within government, the business sector and civil society. The study investigates perceptions of students at a Further Education & Training College towards the <b>sex</b> <b>tourism</b> industry, together with selected components of that industry. The study is undertaken to better understand student's perceptions of the <b>sex</b> <b>tourism</b> industry. In order to achieve this, the researcher set out to better understand the <b>sex</b> <b>tourism</b> industry as a whole; as well as to investigate selected socio-cultural impacts that the <b>sex</b> <b>tourism</b> industry can have upon society in order to explore the positive and negative impacts that <b>sex</b> <b>tourism</b> can have upon the youth. In terms of South African legislation, prostitution is illegal under the Sexual Offences Act 23 of 1957, and the study examines current calls for the <b>sex</b> <b>tourism</b> industry to be legalised or decriminalised in light ofthe forthcoming 2010 FIFA Soccer World Cup. The study further examines life orientation for learners and sex education for sex workers. Life orientation is examined as it may have an effect on students' perceptions towards the <b>sex</b> <b>tourism</b> industry. The training of tourism and hospitality staff is seen as a vehicle for combating one of the components ofthe <b>sex</b> <b>tourism</b> industry, namely, child <b>sex</b> <b>tourism</b> and, thus, it is necessary to examine a number ofits other components. The study briefly touches on life orientation, as a key element in ensuring that learners become competent members of society, and as a tool which assists in providing them with essential life skills. Sex education is seen as necessary for both learners and sex workers in order to enable them to comprehend their rights and choices in life. For the purposes ofthe empirical study, the researcher makes use of first year tourism students at an FET College to gain insight into a student's perspective of the <b>sex</b> <b>tourism</b> industry. The iv researcher makes use of students in order to obtain a varied perspective as the students hail from different walks oflife and have diverse views and opinions. Entry into prostitution comes as a result of one or more of a number of contributing factors such as poverty and human trafficking. The contributing factors are researched and are explained in the literature review. The need to conduct the study emanates from the fact that the sex industry forms a large part of the tourism industry and it is a growing industry in South Africa. The research focuses on two areas: the students' perceptions of the <b>sex</b> <b>tourism</b> industry and the social impacts that the <b>sex</b> <b>tourism</b> industry can have upon society. The research methodology includes a literature search followed by the data collection for the empirical survey. The data collection procedure is explained in detail in the relevant chapter. A combination of the qualitative and quantitative approaches are followed for the· empirical survey. Such an approach is also known as a ''triangulative approach". The empirical survey together with the ensuing statistical analysis are conducted in collaboration with the CPUT registered statistician. The responses to the questionnaire are statistically analysed by the statistician, after which the results are described and interpreted by the researcher. The study finds that the majority of students do not want the <b>sex</b> <b>tourism</b> industry to become legalised and perceive the sex industry as immoral. The social impacts of the <b>sex</b> <b>tourism</b> industry can be harmful to society and the study found that the majority ofstudents understood the impact the industry can have and the role that education plays in reducing a few ofthese selected impacts. Finally, a set ofrecommendations and a number ofconcluding remarks are made. A comprehensive bibliography is included...|$|R
