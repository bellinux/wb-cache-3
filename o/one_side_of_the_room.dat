500|$|In 1990, Nicholas Meyer {{was brought}} in to direct the sixth film in the series: [...] Roddenberry and he clashed creatively, as Roddenberry felt that having the Enterprise crew hold prejudices against the Klingons did not fit with his view of the universe. Meyer {{described}} a meeting with Roddenberry he later regretted, saying:His guys were lined up on <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> and my guys were lined up {{on the other side of}} the room, and this was not a meeting in which I felt I'd behaved very well, very diplomatically, I came out of it feeling not very good, and I've not felt good about it ever since. He was not well, and maybe there were more tactful ways of dealing with it, because at the end of the day, I was going to go out and make the movie. I didn't have to take him on. Not my finest hour. In Joel Engel's biography, Gene Roddenberry: The Myth and the Man Behind Star Trek, he states that Roddenberry watched The Undiscovered Country alongside the producers of the film at a private screening two days before his death, and told them they had done a [...] "good job". [...] In contrast, Nimoy and Shatner's memoirs report that after the screening he called his lawyer and demanded a quarter of the scenes be cut; the producers refused.|$|E

The noise being heard in the {{adjoining}} room, his family went in {{to see what was}} the matter, and found him going from <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> to the other, from the effects of which Sidney was laid up for five or six weeks. Thus was Joseph's prediction in regard to him verified. [...] " ...|$|E
50|$|Mediastinal {{shift is}} <b>the</b> {{deviation}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mediastinal structures towards <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chest cavity, usually seen on chest radiograph.

An emergent condition classically presenting with mediastinal shift is tension pneumothorax.|$|R

2500|$|The {{question}} of whether this time-asymmetric dissipation is really inevitable has been considered by many physicists, often {{in the context of}} Maxwell's demon. The name comes from a thought experiment described by James Clerk Maxwell in which a microscopic demon guards a gate between two halves of a room. It only lets slow molecules into one half, only fast ones into the other. By eventually making <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> cooler than before and the other hotter, it seems to reduce the entropy of the room, and reverse the arrow of time. Many analyses have been made of this; all show that when the entropy of room and demon are taken together, this total entropy does increase. Modern analyses of this problem have taken into account Claude E. Shannon's relation between entropy and information. Many interesting results in modern computing are closely related to this problem [...] reversible computing, quantum computing and physical limits to computing, are examples. These seemingly metaphysical questions are today, in these ways, slowly being converted into hypotheses of the physical sciences.|$|E
