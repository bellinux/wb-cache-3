50|$|The way {{in which}} <b>owner-occupied</b> <b>dwellings</b> should {{be dealt with in}} a Consumer Price Index has been, and remains, a subject of heated {{controversy}} in many countries. Various s have been considered, each with their advantages and disadvantages.|$|R
5000|$|The {{application}} of this principle in the <b>owner-occupied</b> <b>dwellings</b> component of a Consumer Price Index {{is known as the}} [...] "debt profile" [...] method. It means that the current movement of the index will reflect past changes in dwelling prices and interest rates. Some people regard this as odd. Quite a few countries use the debt profile method, but in doing so most of them behave inconsistently. Consistency would require that the index should also cover the interest on consumer credit instead of the whole price paid for the products bought on credit if it covers mortgage interest payments. Products bought on credit would then be treated {{in the same way as}} <b>owner-occupied</b> <b>dwellings.</b>|$|R

Our main findings can be summarized as follows. First, both ICI and TARSU show a moderate regressive impact with respect to household disposable gross income, while PIT on dwellings other than the main residence is progressive. Second, all households owning the main residence gain from the 2008 housing taxation reform, but tax cuts are mostly concentrated on the last three deciles of household equivalent disposable gross income, so that the richest benefited most. Finally, by including imputed rent from owner-occupied dwellings as a component of the personal income tax base, we find that overall inequality is reducing; broadening the personal income tax base could lead to a consistent reduction of tax rates...|$|E
40|$|In all analyses, {{the sample}} {{contains}} only men {{born in the}} United States who were 18 years or older {{at the time of}} the Census. In Section I, in cases where allocation flags are available, I drop any observation whose age, sex, place of birth, group quarters status, or home ownership status was allocated by the Census Bureau. In all other sections, in addition to these restrictions I also drop men whose veteran status was allocated; in the 1960 sample I also drop men for whom total personal income was allocated. I categorize living arrangements into the mutually exclusive categories of owning, renting, living with relatives, and a residual category. I classify men who were listed as the household head or the spouse of the head in an <b>owner-occupied</b> <b>dwelling</b> as home owners. Renters include household heads, or spouses of heads, in dwellings identified as renter-occupied; I also classify as a renter anyone listed as a roomer, boarder, or lodger. Men ‘living with relatives ’ are those who are otherwise related to the household head. The remainder consist mostly of men in group quarters – for example, institutions and military quarters – and household servants. State veteran shares in Section V. B are calculated from the 1960 IPUMS sample using the same data allocation restrictions as for the main 1960 analysis sample. All controls are calculated from IPUMS data, except the urban share of each state, which is from Census counts (Haines, 2010) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{presence}} of extensive housing subsidies characterizes the current Italian tax system as inefficient. In this article, we study whether inefficiency {{is the price}} to be paid to improve equity, by assessing the distributive impact of housing taxation on households' well-being. We concentrate on the Personal Income Tax (PIT) on the main residence, and compare current provisions of the Tax Code with alternative approaches which consider the imputed rent (IR) from <b>owner-occupied</b> <b>dwellings,</b> and would make the tax system neutral with respect to the allocation of wealth among different assets. Holding revenues constant at the current level, we assess the distributional consequences of the IR approach in terms of several alternative scenarios. Our results suggest that the current tax system is as inefficient as it is inequitable. In particular, by including IR from <b>owner-occupied</b> <b>dwellings</b> as a component of the PIT gross income, we find that overall, inequality is reduced, while contemporaneously increasing efficiency in the allocation of wealth. Moreover, considering changes in tax liabilities for individual taxpayers, we show that taxing IRs will favour the young and penalize the elderly. © The Author 2012.

Our empirical analysis shows that the reform impacted on municipalities that in 2008 were in their preelectoral year, by expanding the size of their budget {{in the form of an}} increase of current expenditure and fees and charges, but this did not occurred in municipalities that experienced their pre-electoral year before 2008...|$|R
5000|$|Variants of {{the debt}} profile method are {{employed}} or have been proposed. One example is to include down payments as well as interest. Another is to correct nominal mortgage rates for changes in dwelling prices or {{for changes in the}} rest of the Consumer Price Index to obtain a [...] "real" [...] rate of interest. Also, other methods may be used alongside the debt profile method. Thus several countries include a purely notional cost of depreciation as an additional index component, applying an arbitrarily estimated, or rather guessed, depreciation rate to the value of the stock of <b>owner-occupied</b> <b>dwellings.</b> Finally, one country includes both mortgage interest and purchase prices in its index.|$|R
50|$|A survey {{conducted}} by the Management and Coordination Agency in 1983 found that there were 34.75 million occupied dwellings in Japan, of which 46.1% were built of timber, 31.3% of fireproof timber, and 22.6% of ferroconcrete or other nontimber materials. The same survey found that detached housing accounted for 64.3% off all housing in Japan, with the ratio falling in urban areas. In the 23 wards of Tokyo, for instance, multi-unit structures such as apartment houses accounted for 62.5% of all housing in those wards. In terms of tenure, 62.4% of housing in Japan consisted of <b>owner-occupied</b> <b>dwellings,</b> 24.3% of units leased by the private sector, 7.6% of units leased by the public sector, and 5.2% of housing for government workers and company employees.|$|R

50|$|Although the {{argument}} has been expressed {{in connection with}} <b>owner-occupied</b> <b>dwellings,</b> the logic applies equally to all durable consumer goods and services. Furniture, carpets and domestic appliances are not used up soon after purchase {{in the way that}} food is. Like dwellings, they yield a consumption service that can continue for years. Furthermore, since strict logic is to be adhered to, there are durable services as well that ought to be treated in the same way; the service consumers derive from appendectomies or crowned teeth continue for a long time. Since estimating values for these components of consumption has not been tackled, the economic theorists are torn between their desire for intellectual consistency and their recognition that inclusion of the opportunity cost of the use of durables is impracticable.|$|R

50|$|One {{argument}} is that purchases of new dwellings are treated as Investment in the System of National Accounts, so should not enter a consumption price index. It is {{said that this is}} more than just a matter of terminological uniformity. For example, it may be thought to help understanding and facilitate economic analysis if what is included under the heading of Consumption is the same in the Consumer Price Index and in the national income and expenditure accounts. Since these accounts include the equivalent rental value of <b>owner-occupied</b> <b>dwellings,</b> the equivalent rental approach would have to be applied in the Consumer Price Index too. But the national accounts do not apply it to other durables, so the argument demands consistency in one respect but accepts its rejection in another.|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{taxation}} of the {{owner-occupied house}} – the “principal dwelling”– was a recurrent central {{issue in the}} political and economic debate in Italy especially in the last 15 years. It may be useful, therefore, to address this issue, by both examining the theoretical aspects and reviewing the Italian legislation since the general tax reform of the seventies – whose starting point for direct taxation was the year 1974 – with respect to the two tax bases {{that can be used in}} the taxation of <b>owner-occupied</b> <b>dwellings,</b> namely the imputed income and the asset value. This paper first analyzes the tax treatment of principal dwellings in Italy on both equity and efficiency grounds over the past forty years and compares it with the solutions adopted in other countries; second an empirical assessment of the evolution of the total tax burden on owner-occupied houses in Italy is proposed...|$|R

50|$|There are, of course, {{practical}} problems in implementing {{either of these}} economists' approaches. Thus, with the alternative cost approach, if house prices are rising fast the cost can be negative and then become sharply positive once house prices start to fall, so such an index would be very volatile. On the other hand, with the rental equivalent approach, there may be difficulty in estimating the movement of rental values of types of property which are not actually rented. If one or other of these measures of the consumption of the services of <b>owner-occupied</b> <b>dwellings</b> is included in consumption, then it must be included in income too, for income equals consumption plus saving. This means that if the movement of incomes is to {{be compared with the}} movement of the Consumer Price Index, incomes must be expressed as money income plus this imaginary consumption value. That is logical, {{but it may not be}} what users of the index want.|$|R

The best examples of architecture of that period are the Old City Hall, the former Hotel [...] "Louvre", the former Hotel [...] "London", and Public Secondary schools #1 and #3. First enterprises were built at that time to the north of the town center. In the 1920s and 1930s, the area near the railway station was built out. After the World War II, Georgiyevsk grew quickly in the western residential areas and northern industrial areas.

40|$|During the 1970 s and 1980 s, the {{proportion}} of dual-income households in the Netherlands increased rapidly. Dutch society lagged a little behind other Western societies {{in terms of the}} emancipation of women in the labour market, but women began to enter the labour market more often and continue working while raising children. Households with a stable dual-income became more common. Mortgage lenders reacted to this situation by introducing new mortgage products onto the market. From the year 1993 onwards, the ‘dual-income’ mortgage made it possible to take out a mortgage against the income of both partners. The owner-occupied market became accessible for many more households and the potential demand for housing in this sector of the market rose sharply. However, since there was no corresponding expansion in the supply of new housing, house prices also rose strongly during the 1990 s. The rising trend in house prices created a huge increase in equity for households that already owned their home. The combination of this increase in equity, new forms of mortgages and relatively low interest rates led to a growth in the demand for <b>owner-occupied</b> <b>dwellings</b> in the middle and upper end of the housing market in the late 1990 s and {{the first two years of}} this century. The owner-occupied market boomed. The average house price rose by 10 % to 15 % per year, the number of transactions climbed up from 70, 000 in 1990 to 130, 000 in 2002. The number of newly built <b>dwellings</b> in the <b>owner-occupied</b> sector grew to around 70, 000 units per year in the late 1990 s, with a shift to more expensive houses. However, the effect of the dual-income mortgage introduction on the housing demand fades away into the early years of this century. Additionally, the sharp rise in the house prices made <b>owner-occupied</b> <b>dwellings</b> less affordable and the sector less accessible for first-time buyers. The continuing growth in the potential demand for owner-occupied housing is now slowing and in some sectors and regions there has even been a drop in demand. The ‘credit crunch’ of 2008 has only served to reinforce this slow-down, which was already underway. Housing SystemsOTB Research Institut...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{reports on}} the main {{developments}} in the Private Rented Sector (PRS) in Flanders {{over the past few}} decades. The most striking conclusion is that the PRS contains an ever weakening market. One of the root causes {{can be traced back to}} historical policy options mainly focusing on homeownership through tax incentives and premiums. The percentage of <b>owner-occupied</b> <b>dwellings</b> increased ever since the post-war period. The PRS more and more became a residual market characterized by little professional letting and inhabited by tenants with a weakening socio-economic profile. After discussing the role, size and composition of the PRS due to historic measures, the paper elaborates on current and future housing policies, thereby focusing on two key developments. First, there is a growing level of understanding that the private rental market needs supportive policies. Secondly, the next step in the reform of the Belgian state will offer historic opportunities for the Flemish housing policy as new competences such as the rental legislation and the budgets for tax benefits will be transferred to the regions. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Regional {{differences}} have been increasing in Sweden. Over {{the last five}} to ten years, several municipalities have lost well over 1 per cent per annum of their population through a net outmigration to metropolitan regions and university cities. Losses of inhabitants normally {{have a negative effect}} on the housing market. Prices of <b>owner-occupied</b> <b>dwellings</b> decrease and vacancies occur in the rented sector. This paper aims to analyse the differences between depopulating municipalities. In some cases a net loss in population is compatible with a net migration of elderly households and middle-aged families - even when there is a massive outmigration of young people. A regression model shows that municipalities in a coastal location, with good living conditions and a strong housing market, also have a net inmigration of middle-aged or elderly households. The analysis also shows that a net outmigration is not always in conflict with a dynamic housing market. If there is a reasonably large inmigration of middle-aged or elderly households, the housing market conditions can still be favourable. Mobility, housing, suburbanization, econometrics,...|$|R
