During the interview for Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, Schmidt stated that the software company would have strong competition against Apple, the designer of the iPad line of tablets. While he did not {{refer to it as}} such, the device was inferred {{to be part of the}} Google Nexus series of consumer devices using the Android operating system and built by a partnering <b>original</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>manufacturer</b> (OEM).|$|E
5|$|In August 2012, and as {{a result}} of Europe's debt crisis that {{resulted}} in PSA Peugeot Citroën (PSA) Group slow sales, Mitsubishi Motors announced the suspension of its supply of the i-MiEV electric vehicle to PSA, although the period for supplying vehicles under their contract as part of <b>original</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>manufacturer</b> agreements has not yet ended. The suspension is part of the decision of several Japanese manufacturers to suspend their joint development projects and contracts with several European partners. By early August 2012, PSA had sold a total of 6,575 Peugeot iOns and Citroën C-Zeros since their launch in Europe in 2010, while Mitsubishi had assembled almost 11,000 electric cars destined to PSA, leaving the French carmaker with more than 4,400 electric cars in unsold inventory. PSA only sold 50% of the sales target set for 2011 and according to PSA the supply was only temporarily interrupted.|$|E

Later versions were available as free downloads, or in service packs, and included in the <b>original</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>manufacturer</b> (OEM) service releases of Windows 95 and later versions of Windows.

25|$|If Windows is pre-installed on a {{computer}} by an <b>original</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>manufacturer</b> (OEM), the operating system is automatically activated {{without the need for}} interaction from the user. In this case, the copy of Windows installed does not use the product key listed on the certificate of authenticity, but rather a master product key issued to OEMs called a System Locked Pre-installation (SLP) key. On each boot, Windows confirms the presence of specific information stored in the BIOS by the manufacturer, ensuring the activation only remains valid on that computer, even if the product key is used on another machine.|$|E
25|$|Computer {{hardware}} {{is usually}} sold with an operating system other than Linux already installed by the <b>original</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>manufacturer</b> (OEM). In {{the case of}} IBM PC compatibles the OS is usually Microsoft Windows; {{in the case of}} Apple Macintosh computers it has always been a version of Apple's OS, currently macOS; Sun Microsystems sold SPARC hardware with the Solaris installed; video game consoles such as the Xbox, PlayStation, and Wii each have their own proprietary OS. This limits Linux's market share: consumers are unaware that an alternative exists, they must make a conscious effort to use a different operating system, and they must either perform the actual installation themselves, or depend on support from a friend, relative, or computer professional.|$|E
25|$|Prior to {{the launch}} of the Prevé and Suprima S, Proton cars {{suffered}} from a poor safety reputation. The Proton Jumbuck infamously scored one star out of a potential five in its ANCAP test in 2009. Proton responded by raising safety standards significantly during the development of the Prevé. The Reinforced Safety Structure (RESS) frame was developed specifically for the new car. Proton employs the use of Hot Press Forming (HPF), a process which was pioneered in Germany, during the frame's manufacturing process. Twelve incorporated HPF components help in the reinforcement of the passenger compartment for improved occupant safety. The end result is an increased tensile strength and torsional body rigidity of 19,000 Nm/degree. The usage of HPF in the Prevé's manufacturing process also helps in weight-saving, which translates into improved fuel efficiency, handling and performance. Proton is the only <b>Original</b> <b>Equipment</b> <b>Manufacturer</b> (OEM) in South East Asia to use Hot Press Forming in their manufacturing processes.|$|E

25|$|Taiwan's {{information}} technology industry has {{played an important role}} in the worldwide IT market over the last 20 years. In 1960, the electronics industry in Taiwan was virtually nonexistent. However, with the government's focus on development of expertise with high technology, along with marketing and management knowledge to establish its own industries, companies such as TSMC and UMC were established. The industry used its industrial resources and product management experience to cooperate closely with major international suppliers to become the research and development hub of the Asia-Pacific region. The structure of the industry in Taiwan includes a handful of companies at the top along with many small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) which account for 85% of industrial output. These SMEs usually produce products on an <b>original</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>manufacturer</b> (OEM) or original design manufacturer (ODM) basis, resulting in less resources spent on research and development. Due to the emphasis of the OEM/ODM model, companies are usually unable to make in-depth assessments for investment, production, and marketing of new products, instead relying upon importation of key components and advanced technology from the United States and Japan. Twenty of the top information and communication technology (ICT) companies have International Procurement Offices set up in Taiwan. As a signer of the Information Technology Agreement, Taiwan phased out tariffs on IT products since 1 January 2002.|$|E

Thanks to Muntz's talent for mass-market advertising and self-promotion, by 1977 the projection receivers were a multimillion-dollar business. Muntz was quick to feature Sony's Betamax as well as JVC's and RCA's VHS recorders in his store, setting up a showroom to demonstrate {{the potential for a}} [...] "theater experience in the home".|$|E

Xerox (copy machines), and Cummins Engine are examples of refurbishing factories in the USA. Rolls Royce has a very large aircraft remanufacturing factory in Singapore; Caterpillar recently announced the opening of a tractor refurbishing plant in China.
