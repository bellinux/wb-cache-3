40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{conditions}} that affected market liquidity during the recent financial crisis, and how this setting resulted in a systemic breakdown in the economy. We also review <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Reserves</b> actions and provide empirical evidence on <b>the</b> effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Reserves</b> unconventional monetary policy in providing market liquidity during the crisis. We use a dataset consisting of an aggregate market liquidity measure and individual program data on <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Reserves</b> activity to analyze <b>the</b> market impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Reserves</b> balance sheet programs. In baseline regressions we find no statistically significant evidence that <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Reserves</b> unconventional policies {{had an impact on}} market liquidity. However, in asymmetric tests, we find that positive changes in the QE 1 large-scale asset purchase program and the liquidity to key credit markets program had a statistically significant impact on the market liquidity measure...|$|R

5|$|American {{economist}} and former Chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Reserve</b> Paul Volcker {{has argued that}} the lack of global consensus on key issues threatens efforts to reform the global financial system. He has argued that quite possibly the most important issue is a unified approach to addressing failures of systemically important financial institutions, noting public taxpayers and government officials have grown disillusioned with deploying tax revenues to bail out creditors for the sake of stopping contagion and mitigating economic disaster. Volcker has expressed an array of potential coordinated measures: increased policy surveillance by the IMF and commitment from nations to adopt agreed-upon best practices, mandatory consultation from multilateral bodies leading to more direct policy recommendations, stricter controls on national qualification for emergency financing facilities (such as those offered by the IMF or by central banks), and improved incentive structures with financial penalties.|$|E
