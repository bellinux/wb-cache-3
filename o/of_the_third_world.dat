5|$|Some protesters, {{commentators}} such as Libération correspondent Jean Quatremer and the Liège-based NGO Committee for the Abolition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Third</b> <b>World</b> Debt (CADTM) {{allege that}} the debt should be characterised as odious debt. The Greek documentary Debtocracy, {{and a book}} of the same title and content examine whether the recent Siemens scandal and uncommercial ECB loans which were conditional on the purchase of military aircraft and submarines are evidence that the loans amount to odious debt and that an audit would result in invalidation of {{a large amount of}} the debt.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{aftermath}} of the Cold War is not always easily erased, as many of the economic and social tensions that were exploited to fuel Cold War competition in parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Third</b> <b>World</b> remain acute. The breakdown of state control {{in a number of areas}} formerly ruled by communist governments produced new civil and ethnic conflicts, particularly in the former Yugoslavia. In Central and Eastern Europe, the end of the Cold War has ushered in an era of economic growth and an increase in the number of liberal democracies, while in other parts of the world, such as Afghanistan, independence was accompanied by state failure.|$|E

5|$|Staffrooms {{are funny}} places, full of articulate, mad people. They have a {{tremendous}} sense of black humour, but there's a layer of dust over them. They are immature because they're in a children's environment all the time. They have a strange perspective; because they spend all day with kids, they are more aware of kids' culture than adults'. When they read about a former pupil who has become head of ICI, they always say, 'But that boy's an idiot. He's crap at geography.' The boy is condemned forever because in the 1960s he didn't know all the capitals <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Third</b> <b>World.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Mikhail Gorbachev became Secretary-General of the Soviet Communist Party. A reformer, he {{implemented}} {{measures to}} increase {{freedom of the}} press (glasnost) and economic decentralization (perestroika) in an attempt to strengthen socialism. Like many orthodox Marxist critics, Castro feared that the reforms would weaken the socialist state and allow capitalist elements to regain control. Gorbachev conceded to U.S. demands to reduce support for Cuba, with Soviet-Cuban relations deteriorating. When Gorbachev visited Cuba in April 1989, he informed Castro that perestroika meant an end to subsidies for Cuba. Ignoring calls for liberalization in accordance with the Soviet example, Castro continued to clamp down on internal dissidents and in particular kept tabs on the military, the primary threat to the government. A number of senior military officers, including Ochoa and Tony de la Guardia, were investigated for corruption and complicity in cocaine smuggling, tried, and executed in 1989, despite calls for leniency. On medical advice given him in October 1985, Castro gave up regularly smoking Cuban cigars, helping to set an example {{for the rest of the}} populace. Castro became passionate in his denunciation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Third</b> <b>World</b> debt problem, arguing that the Third World would never escape the debt that First World banks and governments imposed upon it. In 1985, Havana hosted five international conferences on the world debt problem.|$|E

5|$|Varying {{definitions}} of the term First World and {{the uncertainty of the}} term in today's world leads to different indicators of First World status. In 1945, the United Nations used the terms first, second, third, and fourth worlds to define the relative wealth of nations (although popular use of the term fourth world did not come about until later). There are some references towards culture in the definition. They were defined in terms of Gross National Product (GNP), measured in U.S. dollars, along with other socio-political factors. The first world included the large industrialized, democratic (free elections, etc.) nations. The second world included modern, wealthy, industrialized nations, but they were all under communist control. Most {{of the rest of the}} world was deemed part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>world,</b> while the fourth world was considered to be those nations whose people were living on less than US$100 annually. If we use the term to mean high-income industrialized economies, then the World Bank classifies countries according to their GNI or gross national income per capita. The World Bank separates countries into four categories: high-income, upper-middle-income, lower-middle-income, and low-income economies. The First World is considered to be countries with high-income economies. The high-income economies are equated to mean developed and industrialized countries.|$|E

40|$|The {{concept that}} {{education}} equips and enlightens people towards a brighter future is not revolutionary or unusual; applying this ideology to <b>the</b> <b>Third</b> <b>World,</b> however, {{is a more}} recent endeavor. Decades <b>of</b> study examining <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> education on <b>the</b> lives <b>of</b> women in <b>the</b> <b>Third</b> <b>World</b> reveal that it has positive effects socially, culturally, politically and economically, as the single most determining factor improving <b>the</b> lives <b>of</b> women and children. This thesis researches the multi-faceted obstacles, stemming from longstanding norms, that prevent <b>the</b> education <b>of</b> women in <b>the</b> <b>Third</b> <b>World,</b> and it reveals {{the way in which}} overcoming those obstacles would usher in an age of progress and freedom into <b>the</b> lives <b>of</b> women in <b>the</b> <b>Third</b> <b>World...</b>|$|R

25|$|When Democrats after 1945 {{proclaimed the}} Tennessee Valley Authority {{as a model}} for {{countries}} in the developing world to follow, conservative critics charged it was a top-heavy, centralized, technocratic venture that displaced locals and did so in insensitive ways.

25|$|Some theorists, such as Martin Khor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Third</b> <b>World</b> Network, {{point out}} that many {{developing}} nations have gone from being food independent to being net food importing economies since the 1970s and 1980s International Monetary Fund (and later the World Trade Organisation's Agreement on Agriculture) free market economics directives to debtor nations. In opening developing countries to developed world food imports subsidised by Western governments, developing nations can become more dependent upon food imports if local agriculture does not improve.|$|E

Almost every nation in the world have issued commemorative coins.|$|E
