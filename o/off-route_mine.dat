50|$|An <b>off-route</b> <b>mine</b> {{system was}} {{developed}} using the APILAS rocket {{mounted on a}} tripod using a sensor package, or tripwires.|$|E
50|$|Addermine is an {{acoustic}} sensor system which utilises the LAW 80 as a kill mechanism {{to create an}} <b>off-route</b> <b>mine.</b> It can also be command detonated from up to 200 m away.|$|E
5000|$|Selectable Lightweight Attack Munition or (M2/M3/M4 SLAM) {{is a small}} United States {{multi-purpose}} landmine {{produced by}} ATK Precision Fuze Company in Janesville, Wisconsin from 1992-2002. [...] It has a passive infrared sensor, and a magnetic influence sensor which {{allow it to be}} used as a demolition munition, <b>off-route</b> <b>mine</b> or full width belly attack mine.|$|E
50|$|The PARM 1 (DM-12) and PARM 2 are German <b>off-route</b> <b>mines</b> {{that fire}} small fin {{stabilized}} rockets.|$|R
50|$|RD-7 <b>off-route</b> {{anti-tank}} <b>mine.</b>|$|R
50|$|Due to the {{critical}} standoff necessary for penetration {{and the development of}} standoff neutralization technologies, shaped charge <b>off-route</b> <b>mines</b> using the Munroe effect are more rarely encountered, though the British/French/German ARGES mine with a tandem warhead is an example of one of the more successful.|$|R
50|$|The FFV 016 is a Swedish {{designed}} <b>off-route</b> <b>mine</b> {{designed for}} use against lightly armoured vehicles. The mine uses a Misznay Schardin effect warhead to produce a self-forging fragment that has an initial velocitiy of approximately 2,000 metres per second and can penetrate 60 mm of armour at 30 metres range. The mine's body is circular, with a dished front which is aimed using a simple built in sight along the expected route of the target.|$|E
50|$|The Snatch Land Rover is a {{protected}} patrol vehicle {{based on the}} Land Rover Defender 110 chassis. Intended for general patrolling in low-threat areas, it is the successor to the Truck Utility Medium (TUM) with Vehicle Protection Kit (VPK). The vehicle was developed in 1992 for use in Northern Ireland. It provides some degree of small arms protection for occupants and a limited level of protection from Improvised Explosive Devices and <b>off-route</b> <b>mines.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Off-route</b> <b>mines</b> are {{designed}} to be effective when detonated next to a vehicle instead of underneath the vehicle. They are useful in cases where the ground or surface is not suitable for burying or concealing a mine. They normally employ a Misznay-Schardin shaped charge to fire a penetrating slug through the target armour. This self forging projectile principle has been used for some French and Soviet off route mines and has earned infamy as an improvised explosive devices (IED) technique in Israel and especially Iraq.|$|R
50|$|The TM-83 is a Russian <b>off-route</b> {{anti-tank}} <b>mine,</b> first shown publicly in 1993. The mine {{consists of}} a large Misznay Schardin effect warhead and infra-red and seismic sensors.|$|R
5000|$|The M24 {{mine was}} a United States <b>off-route</b> land <b>mine</b> {{based on the}} M28A2 HEAT rocket {{normally}} fired by the M20 3.5 inch rocket launcher. The rocket was launched from an M143 plastic launch tube.|$|R
50|$|ARGES is an <b>off-route</b> {{anti-tank}} <b>mine,</b> {{developed by}} an international consortium {{to meet the needs}} of the British, French and German armed forces. The system consists of a rocket and launch tube, a tripod and a sensor package.|$|R
5000|$|The Kasia 100 and Kasia 170 and Kasia 2 x 100 are Polish <b>off-route</b> anti-vehicle <b>mines.</b> The mines {{consist of}} a warhead and are mounted on a four-legged metal frame. The warheads are either 100 or 170 {{millimeters}} in diameter. A number of interchangeable warheads to provide different effects: ...|$|R
50|$|The FFV 018 is a Swedish <b>off-route</b> {{anti-tank}} <b>mine.</b> It uses a large Misznay Schardin effect warhead, {{that generates}} a fast moving slug capable of penetrating the side armour of a tank. The mine {{is mounted on}} a squat tripod, and a built in infra-red sensor package, which detects the target and triggers the mine when the target is in the optimal position.|$|R
50|$|The ATM-6 and ATM-7 are Austrian <b>off-route</b> {{anti-tank}} <b>mines</b> {{that use}} Misznay Schardin effect warheads to fire self forging fragments into {{the sides of}} armoured vehicles. Both mines are mounted on a pedestal base {{which is used to}} aim the mine, and have simple sights to aim the mines. The mines originally could be triggered by a variety of means, including contact wire and infra-red fuses, however as a result of Austrian laws, they now only use command detonation.|$|R
50|$|The MPB is a Polish <b>off-route</b> {{anti-tank}} <b>mine.</b> It {{was developed}} by BELMA (BZE BELMA S.A.) with its partner Military Institute of Engineer Technology. The MPB consists of a metal cylinder filled with explosives, mounted horizontally in an adjustable frame. The mine {{is intended to be}} hidden from direct view of the intended target, {{off to the side of}} a probable vehicle route, usually a road, to attack the weaker armour on the sides and rear of a vehicle. The mine can be triggered by either a contact fuze (MPB-ZK variant) or an influence fuze (MPB-ZN variant) based on infra-red and acoustic sensors, and is also fitted with an anti-handling device. When used with the passive infrared fuze, an acoustic sensor detects approaching vehicles and activates the infra-red sensor, which triggers the mine at an optimal moment as the target passes. The mine can be programmed to self-destruct after either 1, 10 or 30 days have passed.|$|R
