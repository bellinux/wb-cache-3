5|$|Pericles and {{his friends}} were never immune from attack, as preeminence in {{democratic}} Athens was not equivalent to absolute rule. Just before the eruption of the Peloponnesian War, Pericles and two of his closest associates, Phidias and his companion, Aspasia, faced a series <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> <b>and</b> judicial attacks.|$|E

5|$|According to some later accounts, {{before the}} {{eruption}} of the Peloponnesian War (431 BC404 BC), Pericles, some of his closest associates (including the philosopher Anaxagoras and sculptor Phidias) and Aspasia faced a series <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> <b>and</b> legal attacks. Aspasia, in particular, was reportedly accused of corrupting the women of Athens {{in order to satisfy}} Pericles' perversions. According to Plutarch, she was put on trial for impiety, with the comic poet Hermippus as prosecutor. The historical nature of the accounts about these events is disputed, and apparently no harm came to her as a result.|$|E

40|$|An {{active area}} of {{studying}} antecedents and correlates of happiness, satisfaction and subjective well-being, examines the function <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> goals <b>and</b> goal strivings. The article presents the theoretical concept <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> goals <b>and</b> the application <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> goals assessment <b>and</b> {{analysis in the}} domain of work. The study aims to answer the following questions: what is the content <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> work goals, <b>and</b> {{what is the relationship between}} the characteristics <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> goals <b>and</b> job satisfaction. The content <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> goals mainly represents desires, intentions to improve job performance, to get knowledge, and intellectual development. Job satisfaction is connected with importance, value <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> goals, feelings <b>of</b> efficacy, and with the positive responses of the work environment to <b>personal</b> strivings <b>of</b> employees. This shows that employees have found meaning and purpose connected to work, something that gives them sense of efficacy, self-worthiness and the possibility to get affirmation from others.

5|$|Following {{a period}} <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> <b>and</b> legal {{troubles}} with drug addiction, Gil Scott-Heron recorded and released his first album of original material in sixteen years, I'm New Here (2010), {{with the assistance}} of XL Recordings-label head Richard Russell. Produced by Russell, the album served as a departure from Scott-Heron's earlier work, both musically and thematically, eschewing its soul, jazz, and funk styles and social commentary for more personal, reflective lyrics with ruminations on love, loss, and identity, set to contemporary electronic music. It was well received by fans and music critics, who viewed it as a comeback for Scott-Heron.|$|E

5|$|McGovern {{attended}} Mitchell High School, {{where he}} was a solid but unspectacular member of the track team. A turning point came when his tenth-grade English teacher recommended him to the debate team, where he became quite active. His high-school debate coach, a history teacher who capitalized on McGovern's interest in that subject, proved to be a great influence in his life, and McGovern spent many hours honing his meticulous, if colorless, forensic style. McGovern and his debating partner won events in his area and gained renown in a state where debating was passionately followed by the general public. Debate changed McGovern's life, giving him a chance to explore ideas to their logical end, broadening his perspective, and instilling a sense <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> <b>and</b> social confidence. He graduated in 1940 in the top ten percent of his class.|$|E

5|$|Rabearivelo's {{early period}} of modernist-inspired poetry showed skill and {{attracted}} critical attention but adhered strictly to traditional genre conventions. The surrealist poetry he composed beginning in 1931 displayed greater originality, garnering him strong praise and acclaim. Despite increasing critical attention in international poetry reviews, Rabearivelo was never afforded {{access to the}} elite social circles of colonial Madagascar. He suffered a series <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> <b>and</b> professional disappointments, including {{the death of his}} daughter, the French authorities' decision to exclude him from the list of exhibitors at the Universal Exposition in Paris, and growing debt worsened by his philandering and opium addiction. Following Rabearivelo's suicide by cyanide poisoning in 1937, he became viewed as a colonial martyr.|$|E
5|$|While Marlborough {{fought in}} the Low Countries a series <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> <b>and</b> party rivalries instigated a general {{reversal}} of fortune. The Whigs, who were the main prop of the war, had been laying siege to Godolphin. As a price for supporting {{the government in the}} next parliamentary session, the Whigs demanded a share of public office with the appointment of a leading member of their Junto, the Earl of Sunderland (Marlborough's son-in-law), to the post of Secretary of State. The Queen, who loathed Sunderland and the Junto, and who refused to be dominated by any single party, bitterly opposed the move; but Godolphin, increasingly dependent on Whig support, had little room for manoeuvre. With Sarah's tactless, unsubtle backing, Godolphin relentlessly pressed the Queen to submit to Whig demands. In despair, Anne finally relented and Sunderland received the seals of office; but the special relationship between Godolphin, Sarah, and the Queen had taken a severe blow and she began to turn increasingly to a new favourite – Sarah's cousin, Abigail Masham. Anne also became ever more reliant on the advice of Harley, who, convinced that the duumvirate's policy of appeasing the Whig Junto was unnecessary, had set himself up as alternative source of advice to a sympathetic Queen.|$|E
