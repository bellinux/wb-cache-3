5|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Gil Green and produced by Merge @ Crossroads. Filmed in Los Angeles, California, the video features Bedingfield reuniting with a love from her past. The video begins with Bedingfield singing in a park. She then meets up with a boyfriend (played by model Josh Slack) from her past. The two then remember the good times they had together while sitting <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>picnic</b> bench. The video concludes with Bedingfield singing and dancing at a house party. Scenes of Kingston {{in front of an}} ice cream truck and at the house party are intercut throughout the video.|$|E
5|$|Amy {{discovers that}} Kyle's adoptive parents have died. She and Victoria attend the funeral {{to see if}} Kyle is there and see him at the wake with his adoptive grandmother, Joanie Wright (Denise Black). When Kyle drops his toy, Amy {{picks it up and}} tries to give it back but Joanie doesn't hear her so she keeps it. Amy returns the next day and a barmaid gives her Joanie's address. Amy plans to return the toy but changes her mind and leaves. Needing to see Kyle, she persuades Andy to let her take baby Jack to Kyle's playgroup and makes friends with Joanie, telling her that she is {{studying}} childcare and asking if she needs any help with Kyle. Joanie accepts and allows Amy to look after Kyle occasionally. Val is thrilled when she finds out but Victoria and Eric think it is a bad idea and Eric tells Joanie that Amy is Kyle's birth mother. Disgusted, Joanie refuses to let Amy see Kyle again but is eventually persuaded to change her mind. Sadly, while Amy and Kyle are <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>picnic</b> together, Kyle almost drowns and Joanie blames Amy. She promptly bans her from seeing Kyle and refuses to even consider changing her mind, even calling the police when Amy visits repeatedly, who warn her to stay away. Desperate to see her son, Amy and Andy (who she is now dating) call Social Services to see if she can get custody but the social worker tells her that being awarded custody is very unlikely. Feeling now that the adoption was a mistake, Amy decides to snatch Kyle and go on the run. Kerry, understanding how Amy feels, tries to talk her out of it but when she can't, decides to help her. They go to Kyle's playgroup and kidnap him and Kerry drives them to the docks. During the drive, Val phones repeatedly but they don't answer. Eventually Kerry answers and Amy tearfully reveals her plans before throwing the phone away. Eric checks the computer's internet history and finds out where Amy is going. Cain, Andy, Val, Eric and Joanie all rush to the docks. In the end, Cain persuades Amy to return Kyle, warning her of the complications of the life on the run and how Kyle might be affected. She says goodbye to Kyle and gives him to Cain but fearing she'll be sent to prison, Amy leaves, devastating Val. Val later gets a call from Amy and learns that she is living in Ireland with her aunt.|$|E
25|$|Rejected by the Salon jury of 1863, Manet {{seized the}} {{opportunity}} to exhibit Déjeuner sur l'herbe and two other paintings in the 1863 Salon des Refusés. Déjeuner sur l'herbe depicts the juxtaposition of a female nude and a scantily dressed female bather in the background, <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>picnic</b> with two fully dressed men in a rural setting. The painting sparked public notoriety and stirred up controversy and has remained controversial, even to this day. Odilon Redon, for example, did not like it. There is a discussion of it, from this point of view, in Proust's Remembrance of Things Past.|$|E

Inside the cave, Poirot also sniffs a delicate exclusive perfume only used by Arlena and Rosamund. Poirot invites everyone <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>picnic</b> to test their vertigo. Christine and Emily both claimed fear of heights (acrophobia), but Christine easily traverses the bridge – thus she lied. After the picnic, Linda is found overdosed on six of Christine's sleeping pills, and almost dies. She has written a confession but Poirot finds her library book about magic, melted wax and a pin, and realises she mistook piercing a voodoo image for murder. Christine made sure her tablets were handy, provoking the guilt-ridden Linda to take them.|$|E

500|$|Nathaniel Hawthorne, {{though a}} {{founding}} member, was unhappy {{during his tenure}} as a Brook Farmer, partly because {{he was unable to}} write while living there. [...] "I have no quiet at all", he complained, and his hands were covered [...] "with a new crop of blisters—the effect of raking hay". He later presented a fictionalized portrait of his experience in his 1852 novel, The Blithedale Romance. He acknowledged the resemblance in his introduction, saying [...] "in the 'Blithedale' of this volume, many readers will probably suspect a faint and not very faithful shadowing of Brook Farm, in West Roxbury, which (now a little more than ten years ago) was occupied and cultivated by a company of socialists." [...] The chapter called [...] "The Masqueraders", for example, was based <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>picnic</b> held one September to celebrate the harvest season. George Ripley, who reviewed the book for the New York Tribune, said that former Brook Farmers would only notice the resemblance in the humorous parts of the story. Some have also seen a resemblance between Margaret Fuller and Hawthorne's fictional character Zenobia. In the novel, a visitor—a writer like Hawthorne—finds that hard farm labor is not conducive to intellectual creativity.|$|E
500|$|In {{his music}} hall acts, Leno created {{characters}} based on observations mostly {{about life in}} London, including , grocer's assistants, beefeaters, huntsmen, racegoers, firemen, fathers, henpecked husbands, garrulous wives, pantomime dames, a police officer, a fireman and a hairdresser. [...] For his London acts, Leno purchased songs from the foremost music hall writers and composers, including Harry King, who wrote many of Leno's early successes, Harry Dacre and Joseph Tabrar. From 1890, George Le Brunn composed the music to many of Leno's songs and sketches, including [...] "The Detective", [...] "My Old Man", [...] "Chimney on Fire", [...] "The Fasting Man", [...] "The Jap", [...] "All Through a Little Piece of Bacon" [...] and [...] "The Detective Camera". Le Brunn also wrote the music for three of Leno's best known sketches that depicted life in everyday occupations: [...] "The Railway Guard" [...] (1890), [...] "The Shopwalker" [...] and The Waiter" [...] (both from 1891). Leno made 14 short films {{towards the end of}} his life, most as himself, and four as an actor. [...] He generally portrayed a bumbling buffoon who struggles to carry out everyday tasks, such as riding a bicycle. In An Obstinate Cork (1902), one of Leno's few surviving films, he struggles to pull a cork out of a champagne bottle while <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>picnic</b> with his wife Lydia.|$|E
500|$|According to MTV, {{the initial}} concept {{for the music}} video was to portray Spears {{on the porch of}} a beachfront home {{watching}} a group of kids having fun, prompting flashbacks about her former boyfriend. The video begins with Spears going to the telescope, and Spears is looking through a telescope. The concept was later changed a man and a dog walk on the beach, portraying the singer as the girl next door, watching her love interest, played by model Chad Cole, from afar. The beach location was kept, and the music video intercuts with scenes of Spears' dancing on the Paradise Cove pier with her dancers dressed all in beach-friendly white attire, then Spears sits near a car. A writer of Rolling Stone noted the video is best known for [...] "purifying the sexy persona Spears introduced in the '... Baby One More Time' video", while describing it as [...] "a virginal Britney in a long, flowing white dress (and other demure outfits) gazes at a clean-cut boy on the beach, then she walks on the balcony with a pink ball, then does some chaste choreography that features her dancers forming a heart while she sings that she only wants to [...] "hold you tight, treat you right." [...] Spears is sitting <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>picnic</b> blanket wishing she was there with him. She leaves alone."

500|$|The {{music video}} {{revolves}} around the fantasy of a computer store employee, as he dreams about a relationship with Carey. Throughout the video, the pair is seen to have a pillow fight; play laser tag, Guitar Hero and slot cars; and throw a frisbee. The video also features Carey in various revealing outfits. The video begins with a small Compu Nerd Volkswagen, parodying Geek Squad, pulling up into the driveway of Carey's large manor. As the employee introduces himself, Carey flippantly refers {{to him as a}} [...] "CompuNerd", and asks him to follow her to the broken computer. As he attends to it, Carey removes her robe, and enters her large closet, leaving McBrayer to begin his fantasy with her. The first scene is of Carey wearing a tight pink number, laying seductively on the bed, as the computer employee plays with an electric guitar. He joins her on the bed, and she begins playfully spanking him as the two enter a pillow fight. Another scene is interspersed, of Carey sporting a mini silver dress, with tall socks and heels, flaunting her body. The fantasy then adapts to a new scenery, of the pair dressed in medieval clothing, while walking a unicorn, followed by the duo in a large room in the mansion, racing electronic cars. As they proceed to play laser tag, they are shown outside, laying <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>picnic</b> bed, with Carey dressed in a [...] "naughty school girl outfit". They both get up, and begin to throw a frisbee, before relocating in front of the main stairwell in the mansion. The final scenes of the fantasy are of Carey, wearing a shortened red gown, standing atop the staircase, and McBrayer climbing on his knees while carrying flowers. All the scenes begin to fade, with the last being Carey feeding him by hand by the refrigerator, as he wakes up with Carey, now dressed, poking him. She tells the employee that security will let him out when he is finished, and leaves him while he is still fantasizing about her.|$|E

2500|$|Skirmishes and the {{clashes between}} the two sides during 2009 began in June.

The bodies of three of them, a South Korean teacher and two German nurses were discovered. Two German children where freed in May 2010 by combined Saudi and Yemeni forces. They, together with their younger sibling, were separated from their parents. Their sibling is presumed dead. Their parents (both German), and a Briton are still missing and their status is unknown. It is still unclear who was behind the kidnapping. Initial official statements said the group was apparently seized by Houthi rebels. However, Yemen's news agency later reported Houthi rebels accused drug cartels of abducting the group and killing the three. In addition, a spokesman for the rebels accused regional tribes of being behind the kidnappings and slayings.|$|E

2500|$|Many of {{her other}} {{photographs}} containing her nude or hurt children caused controversy. For example, in [...] "The Perfect Tomato," [...] the viewer sees a nude Jessie, posing <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>picnic</b> table outside, bathed in light. Jessie told Steven Cantor during the filming {{of one of his}} movies that she had just been playing around and her mother told her to freeze, and she tried to capture the image in a rush because the sun was setting. This explains why everything is blurred except for the tomato, hence the photograph's title. This image was likely criticized for Jessie’s nudity and presentation of the adolescent female form. While Jessie was aware of this photograph, Dana Cox, in her essay, said that the Mann children were probably unaware of the other photographs being taken as Mann’s children were often naked because “it came natural to them.” This habit of nudity is a family thing because Mann says she used to walk around her house naked when she was growing up. Cox states that “the own artist’s childhood is reflected in the way she captures moments in her children’s lives.” One image that deals more with another aspect of childhood besides [...] "naked play", Jessie's Cut, shows Jessie's head, wrapped in what appears to be plastic, with blood running down the side of her face from the cut above her left eye. The cut is stitched and the blood is dry and stains her skin. As painful as the image looks, there are a great number of viewers who could relate to Jessie when they think about the broken bones and stitched up cuts they had during childhood.|$|E
2500|$|The {{experimental}} {{video for}} [...] "Loser" [...] {{was directed by}} Beck's friend Steve Hanft. Hanft had worked for a week on storyboards for the video, then called a meeting with Beck's label, Bong Load Records, and requested a $300 shooting budget so he could shoot on film instead of video. The unprocessed 16 mm film was frozen for 6 months until Beck signed with Geffen Records. [...] Geffen gave Hanft $14,000 to process, edit, and master the video, making the budget total $14,300. [...] Filming for the video was done all across California, including in Rothrock's Humboldt County studio and backyard and at the Santa Monica graveyard. The video is a mashup of various 16 mm film clips using avant-garde filmmaking techniques and psychedelic color experiments. Beck insisted they were [...] "fucking around" [...] when they made the video; he told Option in 1994, [...] "We weren't making anything slick – it was deliberately crude. You know? It wasn't like one of these perfect new-wave color soft-focus extravaganzas." [...] Hanft, inspired by D.I.Y. American avant-garde filmmakers, Stan Brakhage, Maya Deren, and 1920s surrealist films, included stop-motion animation footage of a moving coffin in the video. Two coffins were used, one which was a prop borrowed from a local drama school and the other which had been built by Beck and Hanft. [...] Clips and sounds sampled from Hanft's Cal Arts, MFA thesis film, [...] "Kill the Moonlight", about a loser stock car racer, are {{also included in the}} video and song. [...] The moment where Beck is wearing a Star Wars mask is often censored for copyright reasons. [...] The work's only clip shot on video rather than film is the one depicting famous mountain dancer Jesco White wearing a white satin shirt and dancing <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>picnic</b> table. [...] The clip was shot by director Julian Nitzberg and was added to the final cut {{on the last day of}} editing.|$|E
