40|$|<b>The</b> wear {{behavior}} <b>of</b> a forged Co- 29 Cr- 6 Mo alloy {{without any}} Ni and C added {{has been investigated}} by using a tribosystem consisting of a pin-on-disc type wear testing machine in distilled water containing different dissolved oxygen content. Dissolved oxygen content in the distilled water was controlled by aerating with oxygen or by deaerating with argon. Wear volume in the distilled water containing high oxygen content is approximately two times larger than in that containing low oxygen content. Accordingly, it is deduced that the overall wear volume is significantly affected by the dissolved oxygen content in the distilled water surrounding the tribosystem. Although abrasive wear, caused by wear debris, is operative as a wear mechanism in the present tribosystem irrespective <b>of</b> oxygen content, <b>the</b> transfer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wear <b>debris</b> to sliding surfaces, as well as <b>the</b> aggregation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wear <b>debris</b> on <b>the</b> sliding surfaces, is more prone to occur during the wear process with the lower oxygen content. Therefore, in the present tribosystem with the lower oxygen content, since <b>the</b> transfer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wear <b>debris</b> to <b>the</b> disc or the pin readily occurs, <b>the</b> generation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wear <b>debris</b> does not directly contribute to the wear volume, leading to the apparently lower wear volume in the tribosystem with lower oxygen content than in that with higher oxygen content; <b>the</b> transfer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wear <b>debris</b> is not counted as wear loss because the wear volume is estimated based on the loss in disc and pin weight that occurs during the wear test.

5|$|The {{hurricane}} dropped torrential rainfall {{over the}} Southeast United States, causing unprecedented devastation in the region. The storm {{was considered the}} worst to impact in the region in at least 29years. Precipitation peaked at 20.65in (525mm) in Idlewild, North Carolina. The heavy rainfall caused streams to greatly exceed their respective flood stages, damaging waterfront property. Many of the deaths occurred in North Carolina, where 30people died. Transportation was disrupted as a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>debris</b> scattered by the wind and rain. In Caldwell County alone, 90percent of bridges were swept away. Overall, the storm caused 50fatalities and $13million in damages.|$|E
5|$|The inner {{boundary}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>debris</b> disk {{was estimated}} at 11″±2″, or 70–100AU. The disk of dust is produced as radiation pressure from Vega pushes debris from collisions of larger objects outward. However, continuous production {{of the amount of}} dust observed over the course of Vega's lifetime would require an enormous starting mass—estimated as hundreds of times the mass of Jupiter. Hence it is {{more likely to have been}} produced as the result of a relatively recent breakup of a moderate-sized (or larger) comet or asteroid, which then further fragmented as the result of collisions between the smaller components and other bodies. This dusty disk would be relatively young on the time scale of the star's age, and it will eventually be removed unless other collision events supply more dust.|$|E

5|$|At the {{southwest}} corner of the same intersection, the building housing Sidetrack Bar & Grillwhich has held a bar and restaurant continuously since at least 1850has an unusual shape resulting from a 1929 train derailment. On an early January morning, the twelfth car, laden with lumber, of an 85-car freight train came off the tracks and crashed into the corner of the building. The owner of the building, who lived just above the section that was hit, was uninjured but had most of her personal effects scattered into the street. There were only a few people near the railroad crossing when it derailed including an 18-year-old female who was knocked unconscious and a man who was sitting in his car, but was able to get away unharmed. When the current owners went to build a patio on the spot, they found some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>debris</b> had been piled up underneath, which made it more difficult to dig post holes. In 1931, the entrance to the building was moved from the east side to its current position on the north side to accommodate a post-prohibition law requiring bar entrances to be at least 500 feet from any church. The back patio was constructed after the nearby church burned down. According to Sidetrack owner Linda French, the first-floor walls are three bricks deep, with the oldest remaining bricks dating to the 1850s.|$|E
5|$|Einsteinium was {{discovered}} {{as a component}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>debris</b> of the first hydrogen bomb explosion in 1952, and named after Albert Einstein. Its most common isotope einsteinium-253 (half-life 20.47 days) is produced artificially from decay of californium-253 in a few dedicated high-power nuclear reactors with a total yield {{on the order of}} one milligram per year. The reactor synthesis is followed by a complex process of separating einsteinium-253 from other actinides and products of their decay. Other isotopes are synthesized in various laboratories, but at much smaller amounts, by bombarding heavy actinide elements with light ions. Owing to the small amounts of produced einsteinium and the short half-life of its most easily produced isotope, there are currently almost no practical applications for it outside basic scientific research. In particular, einsteinium was used to synthesize, for the first time, 17 atoms of the new element mendelevium in 1955.|$|E
5|$|Several {{elliptical}} {{rings of}} material {{have been observed}} in the outer regions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>debris</b> disk between 500 and 800 AU: these may have formed {{as a result of}} the system being disrupted by a passing star. Astrometric data from the Hipparcos mission reveal that the red giant star Beta Columbae passed within 2 light years of Beta Pictoris about 110,000 years ago, but a larger perturbation would have been caused by Zeta Doradus, which passed at a distance of 3 light years about 350,000 years ago. However computer simulations favor a lower encounter velocity than either of these two candidates, which suggest that the star responsible for the rings may have been a companion star of Beta Pictoris on an unstable orbit. The simulations suggest a perturbing star with a mass of 0.5 solar masses is likely to blame for the structures. Such a star would be a red dwarf of spectral type M0V.|$|E
