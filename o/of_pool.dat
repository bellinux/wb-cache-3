5|$|The 1988 Dungeons & Dragons {{role-playing}} game module Ruins of Adventure {{was produced}} {{using the same}} adventure scenario as Pool of Radiance, using the same plot, background, setting, {{and many of the}} same characters as the computer game. The module thus contains useful clues to the successful completion of the computer missions. Ruins of Adventure contains four linked miniscenarios, which form the core <b>of</b> <b>Pool</b> of Radiance. According to the editors of Dragon magazine, Pool of Radiance was based on Ruins of Adventure, and not vice versa.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, Rossen co-wrote, {{produced}} and directed The Hustler. Drawing upon his own {{experiences as a}} pool hustler, he teamed with Sidney Carroll to adapt the novel {{of the same name}} for the screen. The Hustler was nominated for nine Academy Awards and won two. Rossen was nominated as Best Director and with Carroll for Best Adapted Screenplay but did not win either award. He was named Best Director by the New York Film Critics Circle and shared with Carroll the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Written Drama. The Hustler was an enormous popular success and is credited with sparking a resurgence in the popularity <b>of</b> <b>pool</b> in the United States, which had been on the decline for decades.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Andy (Chris Pratt) {{continues}} {{his efforts to}} break up the relationship between his ex-girlfriend Ann (Rashida Jones) and her new boyfriend Mark (Paul Schneider). Andy challenges Mark to a game <b>of</b> <b>pool</b> with the hopes of hustling him, but Mark turns out to be an excellent player and wins multiple games. Mark and Andy make one final wager: if Andy wins, he gets Ann, but if Mark wins he has to leave them alone. Mark dominates the game but loses when he scratches on the 8 ball. Initially delighted, Andy becomes confused when Ann leaves with Mark anyway. The next day, he tells Mark and Ann he will no longer be bothering them, and says a final goodbye to Ann.|$|E

40|$|Land use {{practices}} in Colorado {{during the last}} two centuries altered the supply of sediment and water to many channels in the upper South Platte Basin. As a result of increased supply of sediment and mobility and reduced peak flows, the characteristics <b>of</b> <b>pools</b> associated with channel constrictions, referred to as forced pools, may have been altered. Increased supply of sediment and reduced transport capacity of high flows could lead to aggradation in forced pools. Channel confined by road corridors could lead to high velocities at normal flows, increased energy dissipation from riprap, or even increased pool frequency resulting from failed riprap. To assess potential alterations, four hypotheses were tested: (1) impacted streams will show significantly different mean volume <b>of</b> <b>pools</b> than a control stream; (2) mean volume <b>of</b> <b>pools</b> on streams where land-use activities increased the supply of sediment will be significantly different from streams solely affected by flow regulation; (3) the strongest change in characteristics <b>of</b> <b>pools</b> <b>of</b> impacted streams will be a reduced volume of pools; (4) streams affected by road corridors will show statistically lower spacing <b>of</b> <b>pools</b> than streams unaffected by roads. The downstream spacing and residual volume of twenty consecutive forced pools were surveyed on five streams in the Colorado Front Range that varied from no contemporary impact to multiple historical and contemporary impacts. ANCOVA with stepwise model selection indicated that degree of land-use (categorical), bankfull spacing <b>of</b> <b>pools,</b> upstream riffle slope and expansion ratio were all significant (α= 0. 1) predictors <b>of</b> volume <b>of</b> <b>pools</b> (R 2 = 0. 73).
