Materials employed for the ground may be kaolin, chalk or gypsum, or any other white material deriving from an inert mineral. To organise the painting, preliminary sketches were carried out. Generally this involved the geometric layout of the design {{with the help of}} snapped lines and/or rulers. Compasses were employed mainly for the construction of mandalas. Figures were roughly sketched, and then rendered with precise contours. These outlines are usually in black. Repetitive designs were in some cases achieved with the use of stencils.|$|R
30|$|In addition, {{researchers}} have recently {{realized that the}} traditional separation of protocols in layers, through the clear definition of the services that each layer must provide and the isolation of each layer's operation, {{is not the best}} way to go. In other words, the exchange of information among <b>layers</b> <b>renders</b> a far better performance than working in isolation. This discovery has given rise to the notion of cross-layer protocol design.|$|R
40|$|Data Types Graphical {{abstract}} {{data types}} support the tight coupling of the graphics <b>layer,</b> the <b>rendering</b> <b>layer,</b> {{and the application}} layer. Consider an application managing 3 D arrows. An arrow object is an application object which has to be represented in the graphics layer in terms of nodes. To visualize an arrow, we could combine a cone node and a cylinder node. However, two problems arise: 1. The application stores redundant information, i. e. for each arrow a cone node and a cylinder node. 2. The arrow semantics is lost in the graphics <b>layer</b> and the <b>rendering</b> <b>layer.</b> The semantics could be useful to optimize rendering and intersection algorithms. In our approach, applications can define application-specific types as new graphical abstract data types and integrate them in the <b>rendering</b> <b>layer</b> and the graphics layer. For example, an arrow class can be registered in a virtual rendering device together with an arrow rendering algorithm. The application creates its arrow objects and embed [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Nested or {{intersecting}} {{surfaces are}} proven techniques for visualizing shape differences between static 3 D objects (Weigle and Taylor II, IEEE Visualization, Proceedings, pp. 503 – 510, 2005). In this paper we present an image-based formulation for these techniques that extends their use to dynamic scenarios, in which surfaces {{can be manipulated}} or even deformed interactively. The formulation is based on our new <b>layered</b> <b>rendering</b> pipeline, a generic image-based approach for rendering nested surfaces based on depth peeling and deferred shading. We use <b>layered</b> <b>rendering</b> to enhance the intersecting surfaces visualization. In addition to enabling interactive performance, our enhancements address several limitations of the original technique. Contours remove ambiguity regarding the shape of intersections. Local distances between the surfaces can be visualized at any point using either depth fogging or distance fields: Depth fogging {{is used as a}} cue for the distance between two surfaces in the viewing direction, whereas closest-point distance measures are visualized interactively by evaluating one surface’s distance field on the other surface. Furthermore, we use these measures to define a three-way surface segmentation, which visualizes regions of growth, shrinkage, and no change of a test surface compared with a reference surface. Finally, we demonstrate an application of our technique in the visualization of statistical shape models. We evaluate our technique based on feedback provided by medical image analysis researchers, who are experts in working with such models.
