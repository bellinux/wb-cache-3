25|$|One of {{the major}} factors that causes {{complications}} is that the contact lens is an oxygen barrier. The cornea needs a constant supply of oxygen to remain completely transparent and function as it should; it normally gets that oxygen from the surrounding air while awake, and from the {{blood vessels in the}} back of the eyelid while asleep. The most prominent risks associated with long-term, chronic low oxygen to the cornea include corneal neovascularization, increased epithelial permeability, bacterial adherence, microcysts, corneal edema, endothelial polymegethism, dry eye and potential increase in myopia. That is why much of the research into the latest soft and rigid contact lens materials has centered on improving <b>oxygen</b> <b>transmission</b> through the lens.|$|E

40|$|Changes in the {{hydrological}} regime of the saline closed basin Lake Van, a large, deep lake in eastern Turkey, {{resulted in a}} lake level increase by about 2 m between 1988 and 1995, followed by a 1. 5 m decrease until 2003 and a relatively constant lake level thereafter. Based on measurements of transient tracers (sulfur hexafluoride, CFC- 12, 3 H, 3 He, 4 He, Ne), dissolved <b>oxygen,</b> light <b>transmission,</b> conductivity-temperature-depth profiles, and thermistor data, we investigate the implications associated with lake level fluctuations for deep-water renewal and oxygenation. Our data suggest that deep-water renewal was significantly reduced in Lake Van between 1990 and 2005. This change in mixing conditions resulted {{in the formation of}} a more than 100 m thick anoxic deep-water body below 325 m depth. Apparently, the freshwater inflows responsible for the lake level rise between 1988 and 1995 decreased the salinity of the surface water sufficiently that the generation of density plumes during winter cooling was substantially reduced compared to that in the years before the lake level rise. Significant renewal and oxygenation of the deep water did not occur until at least 2005, although by 2003 the lake level was back to almost the same level as in 1988. This study suggests that short-term changes in the {{hydrological regime}}, resulting in lake level changes of a couple of meters, can lead to significant and long-lasting changes in deep-water renewal and oxic conditions in deep saline lakes...|$|R

40|$|The {{foodborne}} {{bacterial pathogen}} Campylobacter jejuni is an obligate microaerophile that {{is exposed to}} atmospheric <b>oxygen</b> during <b>transmission</b> through the food chain. Survival under aerobic conditions requires the concerted control of oxidative stress systems, which in C. jejuni are intimately connected with iron metabolism via the PerR and Fur regulatory proteins. Here, we have characterized the roles of C. jejuni PerR in oxidative stress and motility phenotypes, and its regulon {{at the level of}} transcription, protein expression and promoter interactions. Insertional inactivation of perR in the C. jejuni reference strains NCTC 11168, 81 - 176 and 81116 did not result in any growth deficiencies, but strongly increased survival in atmospheric oxygen conditions, and allowed growth around filter discs infused with up to 30 [*]% H 2 O 2 (8. 8 M). Expression of catalase, alkyl hydroperoxide reductase, thioredoxin reductase and the Rrc desulforubrerythrin was increased in the perR mutant, and this was mediated at the transcriptional level as shown by electrophoretic mobility shift assays of the katA, ahpC and trxB promoters using purified PerR. Differential RNA-sequencing analysis of a fur perR mutant allowed the identification of eight previously unknown transcription start sites of genes controlled by Fur and/or PerR. Finally, inactivation of perR in C. jejuni did not result in reduced motility, and did not reduce killing of Galleria melonella wax moth larvae. In conclusion, PerR {{plays an important role in}} controlling oxidative stress resistance and aerobic survival of C. jejuni, but this role does not extend into control of motility and associated phenotypes...|$|R
