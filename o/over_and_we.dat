500|$|The Blue Jays drafted Loup in {{the ninth}} round of the 2009 Major League Baseball Draft. Loup had shown a strong {{performance}} when he was playing for the Tulane Green Wave and was the second Green Wave player to be drafted. Loup said of the event, [...] "I had 20 people text message me before I even heard anything and then my phone rang and I got the call. It's exciting. They told me they would call {{me as soon as}} the draft was <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> would discuss details, so hopefully everything will shake out." ...|$|E
500|$|Hours {{following}} the second concert, {{the attacks on}} the World Trade Center in New York City, the Pentagon outside of Washington, D.C., and a crash near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, resulted in the loss of 2,993 lives. Following the events of September 11, Jackson rewrote [...] "What More Can I Give" [...] and expressed his views on the song, writing and music. [...] "I'm not one to sit back and say, 'Oh, I feel bad for what happened to them I want the whole world to sing , to bring us together as a world, because a song is a mantra, something you repeat over and <b>over.</b> <b>And</b> <b>we</b> need peace, we need giving, we need love, we need unity." ...|$|E

500|$|The film's {{director}} and choreographer Ortega {{stated that the}} rehearsal footage and concept of making a film to document {{the preparation of the}} concerts had come about as [...] "an accident". Ortega stated the film was pieced together from [...] "private footage", shot by documentarians Sandrine Orabona and Tim Patterson of Jackson, and that before Jackson's death, was never intended to be released to the public, or even in general. [...] "The recordings were made so we could use them, then the tapes were destined for Michael 's private library. They have a real unguarded honesty to them." [...] Ortega stated that he had gotten the idea to use the rehearsal footage from Jackson's fans after his death: [...] "At first I got so many messages from fans around the world asking to see the shows, asking to see the footage and eventually I realized the journey wasn't <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> had to do this", and Ortega also stated that the film was made only for the Jackson fans: [...] " [...] is for the fans and the film will show the development and intentions of the show, and the concert as it moved closer to London." ...|$|E

2500|$|In early 1920, Soviet–Polish {{tensions}} {{eventually led}} to the Polish–Soviet War. In the run-up and during the war, Trotsky argued that the Red Army was exhausted and the Soviet government should sign a peace treaty with Poland as soon as possible. He did not believe that the Red Army would find much support in Poland proper. Lenin later wrote that he and other Bolshevik leaders believed the Red Army's successes in the Russian Civil War and against the Poles meant [...] "The defensive period of the war with worldwide imperialism was <b>over,</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> could, and had the obligation to, exploit the military situation to launch an offensive war." ...|$|E

I was terrified and thought to myself, 'What would happen to our prisoners there if this story gets out?' Nevertheless, I feel that we must not be silent.... People say that these things happen in wartime {{and that there is}} loyalty to the army and loyalty among the troops, which causes these things to disappear beneath the carpet. But I believe that we are betraying our real responsibility, which is to take these skeletons out of the closet, even if we think that the enemy has more skeletons than us. We must not be silent. We are all part of this terrible conspiracy of silence, and it is eating us up inside." ...|$|E
2500|$|Eisenhower was {{a proponent}} of Roosevelt's New Deal and disapproved {{of the idea of}} the mass {{internment}}. Early on he had tried, unsuccessfully, to limit the internment to adult men, allowing women and children to remain free, and he pushed to keep WRA policy in line with the original idea of making the camps similar to subsistence homesteads in the rural interior of the country. This, along with proposals for helping Japanese Americans resettle in labor-starved farming communities outside the exclusion zone, was met with opposition from the governors of these interior states, who worried about security issues and claimed it was [...] "politically infeasible," [...] at a meeting in Salt Lake City in April 1942. Shortly before the meeting Eisenhower wrote to his former boss, Secretary of Agriculture Claude Wickard, and said, “when the war is <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> consider calmly this unprecedented migration of 120,000 people, we as Americans are going to regret the unavoidable injustices that we may have done.” ...|$|E
