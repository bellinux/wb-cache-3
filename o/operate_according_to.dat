25|$|Furthermore, anti-globalization proponents {{argue that}} those in the West who defend sweatshops show double {{standards}} by complaining about sweatshop labor conditions in countries considered enemies or hostile by Western governments, while still gladly consuming their exports but complaining about the quality.

25|$|From Émile Durkheim, through Marcel Mauss and Claude Lévi-Strauss, Bourdieu {{inherited}} a certain structuralist {{interpretation of the}} tendency of social structures to reproduce themselves, based on the analysis of symbolic structures and forms of classification. However, Bourdieu critically diverged from Durkheim in emphasizing {{the role of the}} social agent in enacting, through the embodiment of social structures, symbolic orders. He furthermore emphasized that the reproduction of social structures does not <b>operate</b> <b>according</b> <b>to</b> a functionalist logic.|$|E
25|$|The Anglican Church in North America is {{structured}} as a self-governing, multinational ecclesiastical province. The province's polity {{is described in}} its constitution and canon law.

25|$|Paul Feyerabend {{advanced}} {{the idea of}} epistemological anarchism, which holds {{that there are no}} useful and exception-free methodological rules governing the progress of science or the growth of knowledge and that the idea that science can or should <b>operate</b> <b>according</b> <b>to</b> universal and fixed rules are unrealistic, pernicious and detrimental to science itself. Feyerabend advocates treating science as an ideology alongside others such as religion, magic, and mythology, and considers the dominance of science in society authoritarian and unjustified. He also contended (along with Imre Lakatos) that the demarcation problem of distinguishing science from pseudoscience on objective grounds is not possible and thus fatal to the notion of science running according to fixed, universal rules. Feyerabend also stated that science does not have evidence for its philosophical precepts, particularly the notion of uniformity of law and process across time and space.|$|E
500|$|On 20 October 2011, the Austrian Institute of Economic Research {{published}} an article that suggests transforming the EFSF into a European Monetary Fund (EMF), which could provide governments with fixed interest rate Eurobonds at a rate slightly below medium-term economic growth (in nominal terms). These bonds would not be tradable but could be held by investors with the EMF and liquidated at any time. Given the backing of all eurozone countries and the ECB, [...] "the EMU would achieve a similarly strong position vis-à-vis financial investors as the US where the Fed backs government bonds to an unlimited extent". To ensure fiscal discipline despite lack of market pressure, the EMF would <b>operate</b> <b>according</b> <b>to</b> strict rules, providing funds only to countries that meet fiscal and macroeconomic criteria.|$|E
500|$|A {{more modern}} {{argument}} is that secret trusts are independent and operate outside the will. This {{would mean that the}} trust is not testamentary in nature but falls within the ordinary equitable jurisdiction of the court. The trust was created by the donor and trustee during the donor's life, and simply not constituted until his death; it does not have to follow the Wills Act, because it was not created by a will. This view was expressed by Megarry VC in Re Snowden, where he said [...] "The whole basis of secret trusts... is that they operate outside the will, changing nothing that is written in it, and allowing it to <b>operate</b> <b>according</b> <b>to</b> its tenor, but then fastening a trust on to the property {{in the hands of the}} recipient". This suggests that secret trusts are not constructive trusts but rather express trusts.|$|E

2500|$|Enlightenment thinkers, {{under the}} {{influence}} of Newtonian science, tended to view the universe as a vast machine, created and set in motion by a creator being, that continues to <b>operate</b> <b>according</b> <b>to</b> natural law, without any divine intervention. This view naturally led to what was then usually called necessitarianism (the modern term is determinism): the view that everything in the universe – including human behavior – is completely causally determined by antecedent circumstances and natural law. (See, for example, La Mettrie's [...]) As a consequence, debates about freedom versus [...] "necessity" [...] were a regular feature of Enlightenment religious and philosophical discussions.|$|E
