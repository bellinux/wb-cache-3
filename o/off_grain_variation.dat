40|$|Cast {{material}} has a grain structure that is relatively non-uniform. There is {{a desire to}} evaluate the grain structure of this material non-destructively. Traditionally, grain size measurement is a destructive process involving the sectioning and metallographic imaging of the material. Generally, this is performed on a representative sample on a periodic basis. Sampling is inefficient and costly. Furthermore, the resulting data may not provide an accurate description of the entire part&#x 27;s average grain size or <b>grain</b> size <b>variation.</b> This project is designed to develop a non-destructive acoustic scanning technique, using Chirp waveforms, to quantify average grain size and <b>grain</b> size <b>variation</b> {{across the surface of}} a cast material. A Chirp is a signal in which the frequency increases or decreases over time (frequency modulation). As a Chirp passes through a material, the material&#x 27;s grains reduce the signal (attenuation) by absorbing the signal energy. Geophysics research has shown a direct correlation with Chirp wave attenuation and mean grain size in geological structures. The goal of this project is to demonstrate that Chirp waveform attenuation can be used to measure grain size and <b>grain</b> <b>variation</b> in cast metals (uranium and other materials of interest). An off-axis ultrasonic inspection technique using air-coupled ultrasonics has been developed to determine grain size in cast materials. The technique gives a uniform response across the volume of the component. This technique has been demonstrated to provide generalized trends of <b>grain</b> <b>variation</b> over the samples investigated...|$|R

These microstructure features include crystallographic texture, grain size, grain size distribution, grain to grain magnetic isolation, grain to <b>grain</b> composition <b>variation</b> {{and in the case}} of L 10 materials the <b>grain</b> to <b>grain</b> <b>variation</b> in the degree of atomic order. We discuss recording media comprised of continuous thin films as well as granular thin films. We discuss media composed of either hcp Co alloys or FePt L 10 alloys. Methods of controlling the microstructural parameters are discussed as is their effects on recording properties. Examples from our recent research will be used to illustrate these microstructural aspects of perpendicular recording media.

Terwindt (1962) studied cross-shore <b>grain</b> size <b>variations</b> for the location Katwijk along the Holland coast before and after a (minor) storm event The field results are discussed and compared to computational results öf a cross-shore mathematical model, for graded sediments.

The effect of a minor storm on the bed material composition (coarsening effect) along the barred cross-shore profile of Katwijk can be reasonably well simulated by the model. ...|$|R
