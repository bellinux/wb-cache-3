50|$|The Münster Matthew {{is printed}} {{version of the}} Gospel of Matthew, written in the Hebrew {{language}} published by Sebastian Münster in 1537 and dedicated to King Henry VIII of England. He had received the text from Spanish Jews he had converted to Christianity in the 1530s. Apparently, these Jews had been using the text to understand the Christian religion in order to counter it. Münster felt that the text was defective, and set about reworking it. The <b>original</b> <b>manuscript</b> he <b>received</b> no longer exists; only his printed reworking of it survives, and it closely resembles the Du Tillet Matthew. Because the places where Münster changed the text is unknown, this text {{can be difficult to}} use for textual criticism.|$|R
25|$|The first {{completed}} <b>manuscript,</b> {{called the}} <b>original</b> <b>manuscript,</b> was completed {{using a variety}} of scribes. Portions of the <b>original</b> <b>manuscript</b> were also used for typesetting. In October 1841, the entire <b>original</b> <b>manuscript</b> was placed into the cornerstone of the Nauvoo House, and sealed up until nearly forty years later when the cornerstone was reopened. It was then discovered that much of the <b>original</b> <b>manuscript</b> had been destroyed by water seepage and mold. Surviving manuscript pages were handed out to various families and individuals in the 1880s.|$|R
5000|$|While {{the first}} page of the <b>original</b> <b>manuscript</b> is lost, the second page (starting with 1 Ne. 2:2) exists and is written in Cowdery's handwriting. [...] Since the first scribes for the <b>Original</b> <b>Manuscript</b> (O) are said to be Joseph's wife Emma and his younger brother Samuel, this {{suggests}} the <b>original</b> <b>manuscript</b> was not begun at 1 Nephi.|$|R
50|$|The <b>original</b> <b>manuscript</b> {{published}} by Avon Books in 1959 was almost immediately {{pulled from the}} shelves due to objections over profanity in one particular passage. The passage was rewritten and the book redistributed even though Kerouac reportedly objected to the changes. The <b>original</b> <b>manuscript</b> remained unpublished until 2015 when Devault-Graves Digital Editions restored the full uncut <b>original</b> <b>manuscript</b> for its print edition.|$|R
25|$|Only 28 {{percent of}} the <b>original</b> <b>manuscript</b> now survives, {{including}} a remarkable find of fragments from 58 pages in 1991. The majority of {{what remains of the}} <b>original</b> <b>manuscript</b> is now kept in the LDS Church's Archives.|$|R
5000|$|Hades, meanwhile, steals the <b>original</b> <b>manuscript</b> of Charles Dickens's Martin Chuzzlewit. He also kidnaps Mycroft, Polly, and the Prose Portal {{in order}} to {{blackmail}} the literary world; any changes made to the plot of a novel's <b>original</b> <b>manuscript</b> will change all other copies. To demonstrate his demands are serious, Hades kills Mr Quaverley, a minor character from the <b>original</b> <b>manuscript</b> of Martin Chuzzlewit. When his demands are not met he also stages a theft of the <b>original</b> <b>manuscript</b> of [...] "Jane Eyre", and kidnaps Jane for another ransom demand. This causes the text of all copies of the Jane Eyre novel to abruptly end {{at the moment of}} Jane's kidnapping, roughly halfway through the book.|$|R
