25|$|The OPO {{consists}} essentially of {{an optical}} resonator and a nonlinear optical crystal. The optical resonator serves to resonate {{at least one}} of signal and idler waves. In the nonlinear optical crystal, the pump, signal and idler waves overlap. The interaction between these three waves leads to amplitude gain for signal and idler waves (parametric amplification) and a corresponding deamplification of the pump wave. The gain allows the resonating wave(s) (signal or idler or both) to oscillate in the resonator, compensating the loss that the resonating wave(s) experience(s) at each round-trip. This loss includes the loss due to <b>outcoupling</b> by one of the resonator mirrors, which provides the desired output wave. Since the (relative) loss is independent of the pump power, but the gain is dependent on pump power, at low pump power there is insufficient gain to support oscillation. Only when the pump power reaches a particular threshold level, oscillation occurs. Above threshold, the gain depends also on the amplitude of the resonated wave. Thus, in steady-state operation, the amplitude of the resonated wave is determined by the condition that this gain equals the (constant) loss. The circulating amplitude increases with increasing pump power, and so does the output power.|$|E
2500|$|Lifespan: The biggest {{technical}} {{problem for}} OLEDs was the limited lifetime {{of the organic}} materials. One 2008 technical report on an OLED TV panel found that [...] "After 1,000 hours the blue luminance degraded by 12%, the red by 7% and the green by 8%." [...] In particular, blue OLEDs historically have had a lifetime of around 14,000 hours to half original brightness (five years at 8 hours a day) when used for flat-panel displays. This {{is lower than the}} typical lifetime of LCD, LED or PDP technology. Each currently is rated for about 25,000–40,000 hours to half brightness, depending on manufacturer and model. Degradation occurs because of the accumulation of nonradiative recombination centers and luminescence quenchers in the emissive zone. It is said that the chemical breakdown in the semiconductors occurs in four steps: 1) recombination of charge carriers through the absorption of UV light, 2) homolytic dissociation, 3) subsequent radical addition reactions that form [...] radicals, and 4) disproportionation between two radicals resulting in hydrogen-atom transfer reactions. However, some manufacturers' displays aim to increase the lifespan of OLED displays, pushing their expected life past that of LCD displays by improving light <b>outcoupling,</b> thus achieving the same brightness at a lower drive current. In 2007, experimental OLEDs were created which can sustain 400nbsp&cd/m2 of luminance for over 198,000 hours for green OLEDs and 62,000 hours for blue OLEDs.|$|E

50|$|The {{coupling}} {{of the two}} oscillators, photons modes in {{the semiconductor}} optical microcavity and excitons of the quantum wells, results in the energy anticrossing of the bare oscillators, giving rise to the two new normal modes for the system, known as {{the upper and lower}} polariton resonances (or branches). The energy shift is proportional to the coupling strength (dependent, e.g., on the field and polarization overlaps). The higher energy or upper mode (UPB, upper polariton branch) is characterized by the photonic and exciton fields oscillating in-phase, while the LPB (lower polariton branch) mode is characterized by them oscillating with phase-opposition. Microcavity exciton-polaritons inherit some properties from both of their roots, such as a light effective mass (from the photons) and a capacity to interact with each other (from the strong exciton nonlinearities) and with the environment (including the internal phonons, which provide thermalization, and the <b>outcoupling</b> by radiative losses). In most cases the interactions are repulsive, at least between polariton quasi-particles of the same spin type (intra-spin interactions) and the nonlinearity term is positive (increase of total energy, or blueshift, upon increasing density).|$|E

40|$|Although SU(1, 1) {{interferometry}} achieves Heisenberg-limited sensitivities, it {{suffers from}} one major drawback: only those particles <b>outcoupled</b> from the pump mode {{contribute to the}} phase measurement. Since the number of particles <b>outcoupled</b> to these `side modes' is typically small, this limits the interferometer's absolute sensitivity. We propose an alternative `pumped-up' approach where all the input particles participate in the phase measurement, and show how this can be implemented in spinor Bose-Einstein condensates and hybrid atom-light systems - {{both of which have}} experimentally realized SU(1, 1) interferometry. We demonstrate that pumped-up schemes are capable of surpassing the shot-noise limit with respect to the total number of input particles and are never worse than conventional SU(1, 1) interferometry. Finally, we show that pumped-up schemes continue to excel - both absolutely and in comparison to conventional SU(1, 1) interferometry - in the presence of particle losses, poor particle-resolution detection, and noise on the relative phase difference between the two side modes. Pumped-up SU(1, 1) interferometry therefore pushes the advantages of conventional SU(1, 1) interferometry into the regime of high absolute sensitivity, which is a necessary condition for useful quantum-enhanced devices.

This enables optimisation of the optical behaviour {{of the stack}} which ultimately determines the <b>outcoupling</b> efficiency. In terms of optical <b>outcoupling</b> {{there are limits to}} the efficiency by which the generated electromagnetic radiation can be extracted from the stack. These limitations are linked to the refractive indices of the individual layers. Values for maximum <b>outcoupling</b> efficiency are sometimes calculated under the implicit assumptions that the OLED stack is planar, that all layers are isotropic with a certain refractive index and that the emitters are not preferentially oriented. In reality it is known that these assumptions are not always valid, be it intentional or unintentional.

Geometrical anisotropy, as for example in gratings, lenses or other internal or external scattering centres, 2. Anisotropic emitters, where the orientation significantly influences the direction in which radiation is emitted and 3.
