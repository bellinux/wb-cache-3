40|$|Purpose-The {{purpose of}} this paper is to propose a new {{assessment}} tool for Leagility. Design/methodology/approach-This research was carried out to systematically propose the <b>operational</b> <b>activities</b> of Leagile supply chains (SCs) with regard to SC drivers. Particularly, SC logistic (facility, transportation and inventory) and cross-functional drivers (information, sourcing and pricing) were selected to classify all <b>operational</b> <b>activities</b> of Leagile SCs. Findings-This study proposed a new framework to evaluate the <b>operational</b> <b>activities</b> of Leagile SCs. <b>Operational</b> <b>activities</b> of Leagile supply chain strategy were determined and categorized with regard to SC drivers. These activities were ranked using an analytic hierarchy process and were then categorized using a cycle view of SC. Originality/value-This study contributed in proposing <b>operational</b> <b>activities</b> of Leagile SC based on its major drivers. The result of this study assist managers, scholars and practitioners to construct new Leagile SCs or assess their Leagility level...|$|R
2500|$|In the mid-1950s, the Navy {{was under}} {{considerable}} pressure to cutback on land-based patrol {{aircraft in the}} wake of the Korean War and the United States Air Force was making demands to control all of America's land-based military aircraft. [...] To face these challenges, the Navy needed to demonstrate the ability to quickly deploy the Neptune aircraft in squadron strength to any part of the globe, and VP-1 was tasked with making this demonstration. [...] On 21 April 1955, the entire squadron departed on what would become the first around-the-world flight by a patrol squadron, returning to Whidbey Island on 5 May. [...] Together with the Navy's record-setting effort of the Truculent Turtle, the Navy was able to demonstrate the value of its Neptune fleet and preserve support for the patrol aviation community. [...] <b>Operational</b> <b>activity</b> included a deployment to Kwajalein for Operation Redwing, during which the squadron conducted radiation monitoring flights following nuclear testing.|$|E
