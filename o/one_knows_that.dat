25|$|The analogy {{given by}} Dzogchen masters is that one's nature {{is like a}} mirror which {{reflects}} with complete openness, but is not affected by the reflections. Rigpa is the knowledge that ensues from recognizing this mirror-like clarity, which cannot be found by searching nor identified. <b>One</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> there is a primordial freedom from grasping his or her mind.|$|E
25|$|Lê Tắc (or Lê Trắc) was an advisor of the Marquis Chương Hiến Trần Kiện {{who was the}} son of Prince Tĩnh Quốc Trần Quốc Khang and {{grandson}} of the emperor Trần Thái Tông. During the 1285 invasion of Đại Việt by the Yuan Dynasty, Trần Kiện surrendered to Kublai Khan's prince Toghan, but he was killed before he could flee to the northern border. As a subordinate of Trần Kiện, Lê Tắc followed his master to China, he survived the ambush that killed Trần Kiện and afterwards lived in exile in the town of Hanyang, Hubei. During his exile in Hanyang, Lê Tắc compiled the An Nam chí lược to recite the history, geography and culture of Đại Việt. A study shows that Lê Tắc wrote his work around the period from 1285 to 1307 and continuously supplemented until 1339, from the foreword of Lê Tắc, <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> An Nam chí lược was published {{for the first time in}} 1335 during the reign of the Emperor Huizong of Yuan, it was subsequently published in the library Siku Quanshu of the Qing Dynasty. During the reign of the Ming Dynasty, an author also based on An Nam chí lược to write an extensive records about Vietnam named Việt Kiệu thư.|$|E

2500|$|During a {{rehearsal}} of Respighi's Pines of Rome in London, de Sabata [...] "demonstrated the bowing and fingering {{of the high}} cello part in the first movement by playing it—without even {{a glance at the}} part. The pianist asked for advice about the solo cadenza, which de Sabata also played by heart. In the rehearsal interval, he asked the flicorni for the final movement to play their brass fanfares. They did. 'What are you playing?' he asked. 'It is an octave higher.' 'Can't be done, Maestro.' ... The Maestro borrowed one of their instruments and blew the correct notes in the right octave." [...] (this anecdote is all the more impressive when <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> the flicorno (saxhorn) is an instrument usually associated with brass bands and very rarely used in a symphony orchestra).|$|E

2500|$|There {{are several}} types of wordplay used in cryptics. One is {{straightforward}} definition substitution using parts of a word. For example, in one puzzle by Mel Taub, the answer IMPORTANT is given the clue [...] "To bring worker into the country may prove significant". The explanation is that to import means [...] "to bring into the country", the [...] "worker" [...] is a worker ant, and [...] "significant" [...] means important. Here, [...] "significant" [...] is the straight definition (appearing here {{at the end of}} the clue), [...] "to bring worker into the country" [...] is the wordplay definition, and [...] "may prove" [...] serves to link the two. Note that in a cryptic clue, there is almost always only one answer that fits both the definition and the wordplay, so that when one sees the answer, <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> it is the right answer—although it can sometimes be a challenge to figure out why it is the right answer. A good cryptic clue should provide a fair and exact definition of the answer, while at the same time being deliberately misleading.|$|E
2500|$|Ringer {{participated in}} his first {{organized}} team activities in May 2009. When talking about rookie camp, he said [...] "Ability-wise, I feel like I am good with competing. Strength, speed and quickness, I feel like I am OK. It's just the plays {{are a lot more}} complicated than college, and I am trying to get used to it. I just need some more time. We all just need time. But the veterans have been helpful." [...] Discussing all the Titans rookies (including Ringer), offensive coordinator Mike Heimer-dinger said [...] "Right now, you can tell they're all rookies. But that's about it." [...] Ringer was one of three Titans rookies who remained unsigned trough July 20. Bruce Tollner, Ringer's agent, said of signing Ringer “We are continuing to talk with the Titans, and hopefully we should have something done pretty soon." [...] However, Ringer and the Titans agreed to a multi-year deal on July 21, 2009. His base salary is expected to be $310,000. Titans' running backs coach Earnest Byner said of the running backs, “Each <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> they're competing for playing time and a position on this team, so there's something to be said about that.” He also said of Ringer, “Bringing in Javon has definitely added to the mix because, right away, guys know he's something to reckon with because they see what he's done out here." ...|$|E
2500|$|Thomson played rugby {{union for}} the Royal Navy before the First World War, {{appearing}} as a centre three-quarter in a match against Harlequins at New Year 1914. After the war, The Times carried reports on matches played {{by both the}} Royal Navy and by the United Services team in which Thomson features, and he was [...] "one of the outstanding players" [...] in the trial match for the Scottish national side in January 1921. On 12 January 1921 The Times reported his name among those picked to play for Scotland against France as a centre. The match itself was not a success for Thomson: he [...] "was entirely out of form" [...] and [...] "mishandled the ball practically every time it came to him", said {{the report of the}} match, a 3-0 win for France. Thomson retained his place in the Scotland team for the next match against Wales at St Helen's, Swansea and was the subject of comment in The Times: [...] "A. E. Thomson's mishandling of the ball was so atrocious that the Scottish selectors may, perhaps, be pardoned for assuming that his form was too bad to be real. <b>One</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> he does possess the quality of pace." [...] This match was won by Scotland and Thomson was the scorer of the first try; the report in The Times, which dwelt largely on pitch invasions that once brought the match to a halt and impeded play throughout, praised Thomson's speed, though again it said his handling was [...] "weak". An ankle injury prevented Thomson playing in the next international match away to Ireland, when Scotland were beaten, but he was recalled for the final international of the season, the Calcutta Cup match against England at Inverleith. It was again not a happy experience: his miss of a pass let in the England wing three-quarter for a try, and the report in The Times said that both Thomson and his Royal Navy colleague Cecil MacKenzie, the other centre three-quarter, were [...] "entirely at sea, both in attack and defence". Thomson did not play any further international rugby in subsequent seasons, though he continued to play for the United Services club, moving successfully to full back.|$|E
