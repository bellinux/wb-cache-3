He told People magazine at the time, [...] "Three years from today, we'll be the new United Artists. Either that, or we'll be <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> butt on the street." [...] In 1976, Laughlin announced that he was more than $7million in debt and blamed the financial troubles on unethical behavior by Warner Bros. Pictures, which he said had illegally sold the television rights to his films.|$|E

60|$|<b>Out</b> we rolled, <b>on</b> <b>our</b> last Sardinian drive. The {{morning was}} of a bell-like beauty, blue and very lovely.

60|$|At Aden {{we changed}} into a P. and O. steamer. Our first evening <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> second cruise was a {{beautiful}} one; the bland Indian Ocean wore its sweetest smile for us.

60|$|There were {{fragments}} of tracery, of mouldings and cornices, and grotesque bits of architecture there, which I {{would have given}} a good deal to be the possessor of.

60|$|But {{to return}} from this long digression. I set about my {{preparations}} without delay, and was soon ready with a small but very select amount of baggage.
