25|$|Leyden jars or more {{powerful}} devices employing flat glass plates alternating with foil conductors were used exclusively up until about 1900, when {{the invention of}} wireless (radio) created a demand for standard capacitors, and the steady move to higher frequencies required capacitors with lower inductance. More compact construction methods began to be used, such as a flexible dielectric sheet (like <b>oiled</b> <b>paper)</b> sandwiched between sheets of metal foil, rolled or folded into a small package.|$|E

In 1960, <b>oil</b> <b>paper</b> umbrella, tobacco leaves, and rice were Meinong district's major income sources. At that time, it was the renaissance of <b>oil</b> <b>paper</b> umbrella. It was estimated that {{there were at least}} twenty factories producing twenty thousand <b>oil</b> <b>paper</b> umbrellas annually. However, with the rapid industrialization in Taiwan, mechanically produced Western umbrellas have replaced them in attribute to low cost, longevity, and portability. Taiwan has become the key country of Western umbrella production and forced lots of traditional handmade oil-paper umbrella factories out of business.|$|R
25|$|Leakage is {{equivalent}} to a resistor in parallel with the capacitor. Constant exposure to heat can cause dielectric breakdown and excessive leakage, a problem often seen in older vacuum tube circuits, particularly where <b>oiled</b> <b>paper</b> and foil capacitors were used. In many vacuum tube circuits, interstage coupling capacitors are used to conduct a varying signal from the plate of one tube to the grid circuit of the next stage. A leaky capacitor can cause the grid circuit voltage to be raised from its normal bias setting, causing excessive current or signal distortion in the downstream tube. In power amplifiers this can cause the plates to glow red, or current limiting resistors to overheat, even fail. Similar considerations apply to component fabricated solid-state (transistor) amplifiers, but owing to lower heat production {{and the use of}} modern polyester dielectric barriers this once-common problem has become relatively rare.|$|E
25|$|The {{problems}} of making metal-coated, glass mirrors {{was due to}} the difficulties in making glass that was very clear, as most ancient glass was tinted green with iron. This was overcome when people began mixing soda, limestone, potash, manganese, and fern ashes with the glass. There was also no way for the ancients to make flat panes of glass with uniform thicknesses. The earliest methods for producing glass panes began in France, when people began blowing glass bubbles, and then spinning them rapidly to flatten them out into plates from which pieces could be cut. However, these pieces were still not uniform in thickness, so produced distorted images as well. A better method was to blow a cylinder of glass, cut off the ends, slice it down the center, and unroll it onto a flat hearth. This method produced the first mirror-quality glass panes, but it was very difficult and resulted in a lot of breakage. Even windows were primarily made of <b>oiled</b> <b>paper</b> or stained glass, until the mid-nineteenth century, due to the high cost of making clear, flat panes of glass.|$|E

The tinned blacking paste was at this time exclusively for army use. The text states [...] "Yet, as the soldier’s boots or shoes must to some extent emulate the brightness and glitter of the boots of those who pay for battles instead of fighting them, a portable blacking apparatus is provided."

6000|$|Such {{a teacher}} was Francis Glass, {{who was born}} in Dublin in 1790, and came to Ohio in 1817, to teach the {{children}} of the backwoods. One of these afterwards remembered a log-cabin schoolhouse where Glass taught, in the twilight let through the windows of <b>oiled</b> <b>paper.</b> The seats were of hewn blocks, so heavy that the boys could not upset them; in the midst was a great stove; and against the wall stood the teacher's desk, of un-planed plank. But as Glass used to say to his pupils, [...] "The temple of the Delphian god was originally a laurel hut, and the muses deign to dwell accordingly in very rustic abodes." [...] His labors in the school were not suffered to keep him from higher aims: he wrote a life of Washington in Latin, which was used for a time as a text-book in the Ohio schools.|$|E
60|$|The {{table was}} of hand-hewn spruce boards, {{and the men}} who played whist had {{frequent}} difficulties in drawing home their tricks across the uneven surface.

Such was the difference of temperature in the small cabin between the floor level and a yard or more above it. The sheet-iron Yukon Stove roared red-hot, yet, eight feet away, on the meat-shelf, placed low and beside the door, lay chunks of solidly frozen moose and bacon. The door, {{a third of the way}} up from the bottom, was a thick rime. In the chinking between the logs at the back of the bunks the frost showed white and glistening. A window of <b>oiled</b> <b>paper</b> furnished light. The lower portion of the paper, on the inside, was coated an inch deep with the frozen moisture of the men's breath.|$|E

60|$|As soon as {{the panel}} was {{replaced}} they mounted the stairs. Before beginning they had seen {{that there were no}} lights in any of the windows, and feeling sure that the house was deserted they groped their way upstairs without hesitation until they reached the attics in the sloping roof. They entered one of these facing the street, opened the casement, in which <b>oiled</b> <b>paper</b> took the place of glass, and stepped down on to the parapet. Their course was now easy. The divisions between the houses were marked by walls some six feet high extending {{from the edge of the}} parapet over the roof. They were able to climb these, however, without having to use their cord, one helping the other up and then being assisted by him.

60|$|Glass is {{so common}} and so cheap {{that we never}} think of being {{grateful}} for it. But if we had lived a few centuries ago, when the richest people had only wooden shutters to their windows, which, of course, had to be closed whenever it was cold or stormy, making the house as dark as night, and had then been placed in a house lighted by glass windows, we would scarcely have found words to express our thankfulness. It {{would have been like}} taking a man out of a dreary prison and setting him in the bright world of God's blessed sunshine. After a time men made small windows of stones that were partly transparent; and then they used skins prepared something like parchment, and finally they used sashes similar to ours, but in them they put <b>oiled</b> <b>paper.</b> And when at last glass came into use, it was so costly that very few were able to buy it, and they had it taken out of the windows and stored carefully away when they went on a journey, as people now store away pictures and silver-plate.|$|E

Except for my tread on the boards there was no sound in the place till I heard some one breathing heavily behind a screen. The priest slid back what had appeared to me a dead wall, and we found a very old priest half-asleep over his charcoal handwarmer. This was the picture. The priest in olive-green, his bald head, pure silver, bowed down before a sliding screen of white <b>oiled</b> <b>paper</b> which let in dull silver light. To his right a battered black lacquer stand containing the Indian ink and brushes with which he feigned to work.

50|$|In the {{population}} of Yao located in Longhui County of Hunan, <b>oil</b> <b>paper</b> umbrella is used as an engagement present by the men side.

Then the experienced man must bring the <b>oil</b> <b>paper</b> umbrella back to the husband's house for the proof of a successful engagement.
