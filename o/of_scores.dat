5|$|The Fasci {{movement}} {{was made up}} of a federation <b>of</b> <b>scores</b> of associations that developed among farm workers, tenant farmers, and small sharecroppers as well as artisans, intellectuals, and industrial workers. The immediate demands of the movement were fair land rents, higher wages, lower local taxes and distribution of misappropriated common land. Between 1889 and 1893 some 170 Fasci were established in Sicily. According to some sources the movement reached a membership of more than 300,000 by the end of 1893. The Fasci constituted autonomous organizations with their own insignia (red rosettes), uniforms and sometimes even musical bands, and their own local halls for reunions and congresses. They were called Fasci (Fascio literally means bundle) because everyone can break a single stick, but no one can break a bundle of sticks.|$|E
5|$|During the 1896 season, Roe {{enjoyed his}} best run <b>of</b> <b>scores</b> for Somerset. Against Kent, he batted {{for most of}} Somerset's innings to score 93 runs without being dismissed, almost half of his team's total, to help Somerset recover from 12 for 5 to post 194. He added a further 45 runs in the second innings, but despite his efforts, Somerset lost by 145 runs. In his next match, Roe posted a low score in the first innings, but {{recorded}} his second century in first-class cricket in the second innings to help Somerset secure a draw. He scored 106 runs, including six boundaries. Against Sussex in the next game, Roe scored an unbeaten 85, but was overshadowed by scores of 154 and 156 by Richard and Lionel Palairet, and 191 by Sussex's Ernest Killick. Roe finished the season fourth in the national batting averages, the highest of any Somerset player, his 434 runs coming {{at an average of}} 43.4.|$|E
5|$|Many {{classification}} {{systems have}} been developed {{in an effort to}} predict difficulty of tracheal intubation, including the Cormack-Lehane classification system, the Intubation Difficulty Scale (IDS), and the Mallampati score. The Mallampati score is drawn from the observation that the size of the base of the tongue influences the difficulty of intubation. It is determined by looking at the anatomy of the mouth, and in particular the visibility of the base of palatine uvula, faucial pillars and the soft palate. Although such medical scoring systems may aid in the evaluation of patients, no single score or combination <b>of</b> <b>scores</b> can be trusted to specifically detect all and only those patients who are difficult to intubate. Furthermore, one study of experienced anesthesiologists, on the widely used Cormack–Lehane classification system, found they did not score the same patients consistently over time, and that only 25% could correctly define all four grades of the widely used Cormack–Lehane classification system. Under certain emergency circumstances (e.g., severe head trauma or suspected cervical spine injury), it may be impossible to fully utilize these the physical examination and the various classification systems to predict the difficulty of tracheal intubation. In such cases, alternative techniques of securing the airway must be readily available.|$|E

50|$|However, {{after the}} change in scoring technique, {{androgynous}} is the result <b>of</b> <b>scoring</b> above the median in both masculine and feminine categories. Sex-typed scores, masculine and feminine, are the result <b>of</b> <b>scoring</b> above the median in one gender and below the median in the other. An undifferentiated score is now a result <b>of</b> <b>scoring</b> below the median in both masculine and feminine categories. In other words, since scores are based on normative data, an androgynous classification occurs when a subject <b>scores</b> above 50% <b>of</b> the comparison group in both masculine and feminine categories, while a sex-typed classification is the result <b>of</b> <b>scoring</b> above half the comparison group in only one gender category.|$|R
5|$|The 1971 Five Nations Championship {{was a new}} dawn for Welsh rugby. The new National Stadium was completed, and {{the team}} now into their Second Golden era were both {{experienced}} and talented. John and Edwards played in all four games, starting with an easy win over England. Wales won 22–6, with John scoring six points from two dropped goals. The second game of the Championship, played against Scotland, was a close encounter, won by Wales 19–18 thanks to a late Gerald Davies try converted by John Taylor. Barry John scored eight of Wales' points, with a try, penalty goal and a conversion; missing only his trademark drop goal to complete a full house <b>of</b> <b>scores.</b> John surpassed his Scotland tally in the next match, a home game against Ireland, scoring 11points with a dropped goal, conversion and two penalty goals. Seen as one of Wales' more accomplished victories, the 23–0 win gave the team a Triple Crown title, {{and set up a}} Grand Slam encounter with France. Despite the low score, the 9–5 win over France at Stade Colombes on 27 March was a match of the highest quality. Edwards and John scored all the points in the encounter, Edwards with a try, John a try and a penalty goal. This was Wales' first Grand Slam since 1952 and the 1971 squad is seen as the greatest ever to be fielded by Wales.|$|E

The main stages <b>of</b> <b>scoring</b> cards development were considered. The scoring card was constructed that is based on actual statistical data on granting of the consumer loans. The research also presents comparative analysis <b>of</b> the <b>scoring</b> cards with other statistical methods of subjects classification. Conclusions. It was established in this study that the scoring cards have better forecasting ability than other statistical methods such as decision trees, neural networks and logistic regression. The format of development the forecasting models in the form <b>of</b> <b>scoring</b> cards is the easiest for interpreting. However, application of this method requires considerable investments as well as continuous updating and renewal of credit histories for borrowers. ????????????. ?????????? ??????????? ??????? ?????? ?????????????????? ??? ? ????? ?????? ??? ?????????????? ??????????????? ????????. ???? ????????????. ??????????? ????????? ?????????? ??????????? ?????? ? ???? ??????????? ?????. ?????? ???????????? ????????????? ?????? ??????????? ???? ??? ??????????? ?????????? ????????? ??????. ???????? ??????????. ?????????? ??????????? ????? ? ??????????????? ?????? ???????? ?????? ? ??????? ?????????????????? ????????? ???????
