40|$|To request Commission {{approval}} for {{the publication of a}} final rule. This final rule amends Parts 30, 31, 32, and 150, and affects distributors of byproduct material to exempt persons, some general licensees, and some users of exempt products. The staff has developed this final rule to improve regulatory efficiency, and ensure public health and safety and protection of the environment. This paper does not address any new commitments. SUMMARY: This final rule will amend several regulations governing the distribution of byproduct material. The reporting requirements for licensees distributing byproduct material to persons exempt from licensing are being changed, <b>obsolete</b> <b>provisions</b> are being deleted, certain regulatory requirements are being clarified, and smoke detector distribution regulations are being simplified.

40|$|To request Commission {{approval}} of {{the publication of a}} proposed rule in the Federal Register for public comment. This proposed rule includes miscellaneous amendments to Parts 30, 31, 32, and 150, regarding the use of byproduct material under exemptions from licensing and under general licenses, and regarding the requirements for those who distribute products and materials for use under exemptions from licensing. SUMMARY: The proposed rule would amend the regulations governing the use of byproduct material to revise requirements for reporting transfers to persons exempt from licensing, simplify the licensing of smoke detector distribution, remove <b>obsolete</b> <b>provisions,</b> and clarify certain regulatory provisions. These actions are intended to better ensure the protection of public health and safety, make the licensing of distribution to exempt persons more effective and efficient, and reduce unnecessary regulatory burden to certain general licensees. These changes would affect users of certain generally licensed devices, persons holding certain byproduct materials under exemption, and licensees who distribute byproduct material to exempt persons.

40|$|A {{paper on}} Characterology needs some apology, I fear, {{if it is}} to be read to a Statistical and Social Inquiry Society such as this. No doubt characterologists are not in quite as unenviable a {{position}} as palmists, clairvoyants or spiritualists. They are not liable to be imprisoned or fined under the <b>obsolete</b> <b>provisions</b> of enactments originally directed against gipsies and witches. But that is not because practical characterology is regarded as worthy of very serious consideration?though not a few people imagine themselves to be fairly good amateur characterologists? but only because it is not regarded as mischievous, and so not worth considering at all. In the public mind charaeterologists are supposed to stand in much the same relation to psychologists as homeopathists, herbists and bone-setters stand to those whose names are to be found on the Medical Register. The object of this paper is to consider if characterology does not deserve some measure of definite recognition, and if it appears to do so, to offer some suggestions as to the statistical methods that should be employed as the basis of characterological research...|$|R
40|$|Abstract A {{radical change}} of the {{composition}} of the population from a religious point of view emerged in the last twenty years of the twentieth century in Italy together with the late unsettled realization of the instrument of agreements with the non-catholic denominations provided by art. 8. 3 of the Constitution. We must reflect about continuing {{to go along with the}} path traced by the constituents or find other solutions to answer the even more insistent requests made by the large number of religious groups in the country, which are still subject to the <b>obsolete</b> <b>provisions</b> of 1929 - 1930. The agreements stipulated by Prodi’s Government on April 2007 and their failure made evident by the fact that after two years, six of these are still waiting to be presented to Parliament by the Government for approval, show what it is that went wrong and what should be done to modernize the relations between the State and the religious minorities respecting the principle of equal freedom, present in the 1 ° subsection of art. 8 Cost., which should be the main rule of Italian ecclesiastic la...|$|R
40|$|Criteria-driven policy {{analysis}} {{resources from the}} University of Wisconsin Pain and Policy Studies Group (PPSG) evaluated drug control and professional practice policies that can influence use of controlled substances for pain management, and documented changes over a 3 -year period. Additional research was needed {{to determine the extent}} of change, the types of messages contained in the policies, and what has contributed to changing policy content. Four research aims guided this study: (1) evaluate change between 2000 and 2003 of state policy that can affect pain relief, (2) describe content differences for statutes, regulations, guidelines, and policy statements, (3) evaluate differences between policies specific to pain management and policies governing general healthcare practice, and (4) compare content of policies specific to pain management created by healthcare regulatory boards to those created by state legislatures. Results showed that more current policies, especially policies regulating health professionals, tend to encourage pain management and avoid language that restricts professional decision-making and patient treatment. In addition, pain policies from healthcare regulatory boards were generally less restrictive than statutes or policies that govern general healthcare practice. These findings suggest that the positive policy change results primarily from state medical, pharmacy, and nursing boards adopting policies promoting pain management and the use of opioids, while containing few if any restrictions. Despite this improvement, further progress can be made when states continue to abrogate additional restrictions or clinically <b>obsolete</b> <b>provisions</b> from policies. PPSG policy evaluations provide guidance to lawmakers, healthcare regulators, and clinicians who are striving to achieve balanced policy, an attainable but redoubtable goal, to benefit patient care...|$|R
5000|$|In {{a report}} dated 6 April 1993, the Law Commission and the Scottish Law Commission said that {{sections}} 3(1)(c) to (f) and 4 [...] "provided {{in general terms}} for the repeal of or omission of various recurrent words relating to obsolete civil procedure (which occurred mainly in now <b>obsolete</b> statutory <b>provisions</b> for the recovery of penalties by common informers), to Scottish stewartries (which occurred mainly in obsolete definitions of [...] "sheriff" [...] or [...] "county") and to self-governing Dominions of the Old Commonwealth". The provision relating to Scottish stewartries had been intended {{to give effect to}} section 7 of the Interpretation Act 1889 which had been repealed as obsolete by the Interpretation Act 1978.

40|$|The year 2010 set an {{important}} milestone {{in the development}} of data protection law in Europe: both Europe's basic regulatory texts, the EU Data Protection Directive and the Council's Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data (Convention 108), were placed at an amendment process, having served individual data protection for many years and witnessed in the meantime technological developments that threatened to make their <b>provisions</b> <b>obsolete.</b> After briefly presenting Convention 108, the analysis that follows will highlight the Council's data protection sys- tem currently in effect as well as developments relating to the Convention's amendment so far with the aim of identifying improvements and shortcomings. While doing this two separate points of view shall be adopted: at first a micro point of view will attempt to identify improvements and shortcomings through an 'insider' perspective, that is, judging only the merits and difficulties of the draft text at hand. Afterwards a macroscopic view will be adopted, whereby strategic issues will be discussed pertaining to the important issue of the relationship of the suggested draft with the EU data protection system, as well as, the same draft's potential to constitute the next global information privacy standard...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this project was to devise materials and bring together information {{that could be used}} by guidance personnel and teachers to help the grade eight student make pre-vocational course choices for grade nine at the Conception Bay South District Vocational School. [...] Out of this overall objective there developed three sub-objectives which were as follows: [...] 1. The development of an information package to be used by guidance personnel and teachers to help the grade eight student make pre-vocational course choices for grade nine at the Conception Bay South Pre-Vocational Pilot Project. [...] 2. The development of an annotated bibliography on the pre-vocational courses and related areas that could be drawn on by teachers and counsellors to provide readily available career guidance information for grade eight students. [...] 3. The development of ten slide-tape presentations, one on each pre-vocational course, to be used by teachers and counsellors to give the grade eight student an insight into what is involved in each course offered by the Conception Bay South Pre-Vocational Pilot Project. [...] The achievement of each of objective resulted in three products as follows: [...] 1. An information package for teachers and counselors. [...] 2. An annotated bibliography. [...] 3. Ten slide-tape presentations. [...] This project took approximately six hundred and ten man hours to complete, and its approximate cost was $ 533. 88 for materials. [...] The overall evaluation of the three products was carried out by teachers, counsellors, a panel of experts, grade eight students, and grade nine students. All evaluators determined the that products were suitable for the purposes for which they were designed. [...] The limiting factors in this project were as follows: [...] 1. The amount of time that was available if the products were to be ready for the school year beginning in September of 1973. [...] 2. Because of the time factor involved, the slides in some of the presentations do not completely cover the course. [...] 3. The technical quality of the slide-tape presentations is limited in some cases. [...] 4. The amount of money that was available for the preparation of the project. [...] 5. Pre-vocational course content can be expected to change, and more up to date materials will be brought into the Department of Education, Audio-Visual Division. These factors may cause the present materials to become outdated. [...] As a result of the project a number of recommendations were made. For use, the recommendations included getting the products into the schools where they can do the most good, using the information package and the slide-tape presentations for public relations purposes, having the information package drawn up into a handbook for students, having the information in the annotated bibliography distributed to guidance counsellors for use in their guidance programs, and having the materials examined for use elsewhere if the pre-vocational program is extended to other areas in Newfoundland. For improvement of the products, the recommendations included having the slide-tape presentations made over in other forms if the appropriate equipment cannot be made available, making improvements in the technical quality of the slide-tape presentations, having people in the actual occupations filmed for inclusion in the career areas discussed on the tape, having the materials on the typing course revised subsequent to the implementation of the new business fundamentals course, and having the electronics slide-tape presentation re-edited before it is presented to students. The general recommendations included having the three products brought up to date when they become <b>obsolete,</b> and having <b>provision</b> made for updating of the guidance materials available from the Department of Education, Audio-Visual Division...|$|R
