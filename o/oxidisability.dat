40|$|Abstract Background Acute {{hyperglycaemia}} is {{an independent}} cardiovascular risk factor in Type 2 diabetes which may be mediated through increased oxidative damage to plasma low density lipoprotein, and in vitro, high glucose concentrations promote proatherogenic adhesion molecule expression and matrix metalloproteinase expression. Methods We examined these atherogenic risk markers in 21 subjects with Type 2 diabetes and 20 controls during an oral 75 g glucose tolerance test. Plasma soluble adhesion molecule concentrations [E-selectin, VCAM- 1 and ICAM- 1], plasma matrix metalloproteinases [MMP- 3 and 9] and plasma LDL <b>oxidisability</b> were measured at 30 minute intervals. Results In the diabetes group, the concentrations of all plasma soluble adhesion molecules fell promptly [all p Conclusions A glucose load leads to a rapid fall in plasma soluble adhesion molecule concentrations in Type 2 diabetes and controls, perhaps reflecting reduced generation of soluble from membrane forms during enhanced leukocyte â€“ endothelial adhesion or increased hepatic clearance, without changes in plasma matrix metalloproteinase concentrations or low density lipoprotein <b>oxidisability.</b> These in vivo findings are in contrast with in vitro data. </p...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine the effects of treatment with atorvastatin, alpha-tocopherol and the combination of both, on lipoproteins and oxidative stress in dialysis patients. DESIGN AND SETTING: This double-blind randomised placebo-controlled trial was performed at the dialysis department of a non-university hospital. SUBJECTS, INTERVENTION AND MEASUREMENTS: A total of 44 clinically stable, non-diabetic patients on dialysis therapy (23 on haemo- and 21 on peritoneal-dialysis) without manifest cardiovascular disease were included in this study. They were randomised for treatment during a period of 12 weeks with 40 mg atorvastatin + placebo alpha-tocopherol (group 1) once daily, 800 IU alpha-tocopherol + placebo atorvastatin once daily (group 2), 40 mg atorvastatin + 800 IU alpha-tocopherol once daily (group 3), or placebo atorvastatin + placebo alpha-tocopherol once daily (group 4). Assessment of lipid profile and oxidative stress was performed at the start of the study and after 12 weeks of treatment. RESULTS: Treatment with atorvastatin reduced total cholesterol, triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, apolipoprotein B (apoB) and levels of oxidised LDL (oxLDL) with 30 - 43 %. It had no influence on LDL <b>oxidisability.</b> Additional supplementation with alpha-tocopherol had no effect on lipid profile and oxLDL levels but decreased in vitro LDL <b>oxidisability.</b> No side-effects were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with atorvastatin is effective in lowering plasma total cholesterol, TG, LDL, apoB and oxLDL in a population of stable dialysis patients and might therefore be an effective tool in improving the poor cardiovascular outcome in these patients. Supplementation of alpha-tocopherol to atorvastatin had beneficial effects on in vitro LDL <b>oxidisability</b> and might therefore be of additional value. Further research on the clinical effects of treatment with atorvastatin in combination with alpha-tocopherol is necessary...|$|E
40|$|Evidence {{has been}} {{increasing}} {{the last several years}} that oxidative modification of LDL may {{play an important role in}} the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis [1, 2]. Further support for the oxi-dative modification hypothesis is provided by the recent report of Salonen et al. [3] who found that the titre of autoantibodies to malondialdehyde-modified LDL was an independent predictor of the progression of carotid atherosclerosis. Although there is little doubt about the specificity of these antibodies to artificially oxidised LDL [4], direct evidence that LDL oxidation actually takes place in vivo is scarce; most research on oxidation of LDL involves <b>oxidisability</b> in vitro. We have measured circulating cholesterol oxidation prod-ucts in WHHL rabbits. Six-month-old rabbit...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{amplification}} of {{low-density lipoprotein}} (LDL) peroxidation in vitro by copper and myoglobin are well-studied biochemical approaches for investigating the oxidative modification of LDL {{and its role}} in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Since the acidity of the environment is increased in inflammatory sites, the aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effects of acidic pH on the <b>oxidisability</b> of LDL mediated by the haem protein myoglobin in comparison with that of copper-mediated LDL oxidation. The results show that acidic pH enhances myoglobin-mediated LDL oxidation as measured by conjugated dienes, lipid hydroperoxides and electrophoretic mobility, whilst a retardation is observed with copper as pro-oxidant; the mechanism probably relates to the effects of pH on the decomposition and formation of lipid hydroperoxides and the relative influences of copper ions and of myoglobin under these conditions...|$|E
40|$|Objective: We {{reviewed}} the bioavailability and antioxidant effects of phenols from {{extra virgin olive}} oil. Search strategy: We searched the MEDLINE database for the years 1966 - 2002. To review the bioavailability of olive oil phenols, we selected animal and human studies that studied the absorption, metabolism, and urinary excretion of olive oil phenols. We also estimated the intake of the various phenols in the Mediterranean area. To review the antioxidant effects of olive oil phenols, we included human and animal studies {{on the effect of}} olive oil phenols on markers of oxidative processes in the body. We excluded studies without a proper control treatment and studies in which the antioxidant effects of phenols could not be disentangled from those of the fatty acid composition of olive oil. Results: Bioavailability studies in humans show that the absorption of olive oil phenols is probably larger than 55 - 66 mol%, and that at least 5 % is excreted in urine as tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol. Animal studies suggest that phenol-rich olive oil lowers <b>oxidisability</b> of ex vivo low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles or lowers markers in urine of oxidative processes in the body. In five out of seven human studies, however, these effects of phenols were not found. There are no data on the phenol concentrations in plasma that are attainable by intake of olive oil. We estimated that 50 g of olive oil per day provides about 2 mg or similar to 13 mumol of hydroxytyrosol-equivalents per day, and that the plasma concentration of olive oil phenols with antioxidant potential resulting from such an intake can be at most 0. 06 mumol/l. This is much lower than the minimum concentrations of these phenols (50 - 100 mmol) required to show antioxidant activity in vitro. Conclusion: Although phenols from olive oil seem to be well absorbed, the content of olive oil phenols with antioxidant potential in the Mediterranean diet is probably too low to produce a measurable effect on LDL <b>oxidisability</b> or other oxidation markers in humans. The available evidence does not suggest that consumption of phenols in the amounts provided by dietary olive oil will protect LDL against oxidative modification to any important extent...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{intends to}} assess the {{technological}} process of obtaining drinking water at Targu-Mures water treatment plant. The assessment was performed before changing the technological process and four months were chosen to be analized during 2008 : January, April, July and October for its efficiency analysis on treatment steps. Mures River is the water source for the water treatment plant, being characterized by unsteady flow and quality parameters with possible important variability {{in a very short}} period of time. The treatment technological process is the classic one, represented by coagulation, sedimentation, filtration and disinfection, but also prechlorination was constantly applied as additional treatment during 2008. Results showed that for the measured parameters, raw water at the water treatment plant fits into class A 3 for surface waters, framing dictated by the bacterial load. The treatment processes efficiency is based on the performance calculation for sedimentation, filtration, global and for disinfection, a better conformation degree of technological steps standing out in January in comparison to the other three analyzed months. A variable non-compliance of turbidity and residual chlorine levels in the disinfected water was observed constantly. Previous treatment steps managed to maintain a low level of <b>oxidisability,</b> chlorine consumption and residual chlorine levels being also low. 12 % samples were found inconsistent with the national legislation in terms of bacteriological quality. Measures for the water treatment plant retechnologization are taken primarily for hyperchlorination elimination, which currently constitutes a discomfort factor (taste, smell), and a generating factor of chlorination by-products...|$|E
40|$|Aims/Hypothesis: Non-alcoholic {{fatty liver}} disease (NAFLD) has been {{associated}} with the metabolic syndrome. However, {{it is not clear whether}} insulin resistance is an independent feature of NAFLD, and it remains to be determined which of the in vivo actions of insulin are impaired in this condition. Methods: We performed a twostep (1. 5 and 6 pmol min(- 1) kg(- 1)) euglycaemic insulin clamp coupled with tracer infusion ([6, 6 -H- 2 (2) ] glucose and [H- 2 (5) ] glycerol) and indirect calorimetry in 12 non-obese, normolipidaemic, normotensive, non-diabetic patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD and six control subjects. Results: In NAFLD patients, endogenous glucose production (basal and during the clamp) was normal; however, peripheral glucose disposal was markedly decreased (by 30 % and 45 % at the low and high insulin doses, respectively, p< 0. 0001) at higher plasma insulin levels (p = 0. 05), due to impaired glucose oxidation (p = 0. 003) and glycogen synthesis (p< 0. 001). Compared with control subjects, glycerol appearance and lipid oxidation were significantly increased in NAFLD patients in the basal state, and were suppressed by insulin to a lesser extent (p< 0. 05 - 0. 001). The lag phase of the in vitro copper-catalysed peroxidation of LDL particles was significantly shorter in the patients than in the control subjects (48 +/- 12 vs 63 +/- 13 min, p< 0. 04). Lipid oxidation was significantly related to endogenous glucose production, glucose disposal, the degree of hepatic steatosis, and LDL <b>oxidisability.</b> Conclusions/interpretation: Insulin resistance appears to be an intrinsic defect in NAFLD, with the metabolic pattern observed indicating that adipose tissue is an important site...|$|E
40|$|Humic {{substances}} are {{a natural}} admixture of surface water {{and determine the}} level of organic pollution of water and colour intensity. Application of coagulation process in surface water treatment allows for decrease turbidity and colour of water, as well as organic matter content. In Poland most drinking water treatment plants use aluminium sulphate as a coagulant. Research works on pre-hydrolysed coagulants, e. g. polyaluminium chlorides (general formula Al n (OH) m Cl 3 n-m) are also carried out. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effectiveness of the coagulation process using polyaluminium chlorides with different basicity, in reducing the level of pollution of surface water with organic substances. Apart from the typical indicators used to evaluate the content of organic compounds, the potential for trihalomethanes formation THM-FP was also determined. The influence of the type of coagulant (low, medium, highly alkaline) on the efficiency of organic compound removal, determined as total organic carbon TOC, <b>oxidisability</b> OXI, absorbance UV 254, was stated. Under the conditions of the coagulation (pH 7. 2 - 7. 4, temperature of 19 - 21 Â°C), the best results were obtained using highly alkaline polyaluminium chlorides PAX-XL 19 F, PAX-XL 1905 and PAX-XL 1910 S, decrease in TOC and OXI by 43 - 46 %, slightly worse - 40 - 41 % using low alkaline PAX 18. Using the medium alkaline coagulants PAX-XL 61 and PAXX-XL 69, 30 - 35 % removal of organic matter was obtained. Despite various effects of dissolved organic carbon removal, depending on the used coagulant, THM-FP in purified water did not differ significantly and ranged from 10. 0 to 10. 9 mgCHCl 3 m - 3. It was by 37 - 42 % lower than in surface water...|$|E
