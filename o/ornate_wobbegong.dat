50|$|The <b>ornate</b> <b>wobbegong</b> (Orectolobus ornatus) is {{a species}} of carpet shark in the family Orectolobidae, found in the western Pacific Ocean around eastern Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and Australia, between latitudes 1° N and 34° S (near Sydney). As yet, only Australian populations are known to {{certainly}} belong to this species, {{and it is possible}} populations in other countries represent a separate, undescribed species. The maximum reported length of the <b>ornate</b> <b>wobbegong</b> is 1.17 m. Reports of a larger maximum size are due to confusion with the recently revalidated gulf wobbegong, O. halei, which for the most part is found further south than the <b>ornate</b> <b>wobbegong.</b>|$|E
50|$|O. halei is {{very similar}} to the <b>ornate</b> <b>wobbegong,</b> O. ornatus, of which it was treated as a synonym until 2006. Despite this, genetic {{evidence}} suggests that O. halei is more closely related to the largely sympatric spotted wobbegong, O. maculatus, than either are to the generally more northern O. ornatus.|$|E
5|$|Considered {{the most}} {{specialized}} member of its family, the tasselled <b>wobbegong's</b> <b>ornate</b> coloration and complex dermal fringe grants it excellent camouflage, {{while it is}} probably a slower swimmer than related species. It is solitary and spends {{most of the day}} lying motionless inside caves or under ledges with its tail curled up. Individual sharks have a small home range, containing several preferred resting spots that are used repeatedly. This species becomes more active at night, swimming onto the reef to hunt.|$|R

50|$|The carpet {{sharks are}} {{a diverse group}} of sharks with differing sizes, appearances, diets, and habits. They first {{appeared}} in the fossil record in the Early Jurassic; the oldest known orectolobiform genera are Folipistrix (known from Toarcian to Aalenian of Belgium and Germany), Palaeobrachaelurus (Aalenian to Barremian) and Annea (Toarcian to Bajocian of Europe). All species have two dorsal fins and a relatively short, transverse mouth that does not extend behind the eyes. Besides the nostrils are barbels, tactile sensory organs, and grooves known as nasoral grooves connect the nostrils to the mouth. Five short gill slits are {{just in front of the}} origin of the pectoral fin and the fifth slit tends to overlap the fourth one. A spiracle occurs beneath each eye which is used in respiration. The only exception to this rule is the whale shark, the spiracles of which are situated just behind the eyes. Carpet sharks derive their common name from the fact that many species have a mottled appearance with intricate patterns reminiscent of carpet designs. The patterning provides camouflage when the fish is lying on the seabed. The largest carpet shark is the whale shark (Rhincodon typus) which can grow to a length of 14 m. It is the largest species of fish, but despite its size, is not dangerous, as it is a filter feeder, drawing in water through its wide mouth and sifting out the plankton. The smallest carpet shark, at up to about 30 cm long, is the barbelthroat carpet shark, (Cirrhoscyllium expolitum). Some of the most spectacularly coloured members of the order are the necklace carpet shark (Parascyllium variolatum), the zebra shark (Stegostoma fasciatum), and the <b>ornate</b> <b>wobbegong</b> (Orectolobus ornatus). Nurse sharks and whale sharks have a fringe of barbels on their snouts, and barbelthroat carpet sharks (Cirrhoscyllium expolitum) have barbels dangling from their throat regions.|$|E
40|$|The Australian {{fur seal}} (Arctocephalus pusillus doriferus) {{is listed as}} a ‘vulnerable’ species in New South Wales (NSW) under the Threatened Species Conservation Act, {{recovering}} from exploitation by commercial sealing activities around southeastern Australia. Recent dietary studies indicate they are generalist predators that feed {{on a wide variety}} of both vertebrates (fish and, occasionally, birds) and invertebrates (cephalopods and, occasionally, crustaceans). While a small number of elasmobranchs have been reported from the diets of a variety of fur seal species, no published evidence exists of either fur seals preying on wobbegongs (Orectolobus spp.), or of large wobbegongs as prey items in the diet of any predator. Here we describe an account of an Australian fur seal feeding on a large <b>ornate</b> <b>wobbegong</b> (Orectolobus ornatus). Wobbegongs are also listed as ‘vulnerable’ in NSW by the IUCN, with commercial fishing catch having dropped over 50 % from 1990 - 2000. Knowledge of relationships between high trophic level species is important for assessing interactions between marine mammals and fisheries and also presents interesting challenges for the conservation of commercially targeted species...|$|E
40|$|The diets {{of three}} species of {{wobbegong}} (Orectolobus ornatus, O. maculatus, and O. halei) in New South Wales, Australia, were inves-tigated using stomach contents from specimens caught by commercial fishers. Some 80 % of wobbegongs caught by commercial setline, and 60 % caught by trap or scuba diving, had empty stomachs, most {{likely due to}} regurgitation. Wobbegongs were frequently hooked in the stomach (80 – 90 % of the catch), potentially contributing to the greater proportion of empty stomachs compared with other species of shark. The diet of all three species was primarily osteichthyans, but with some cephalopods and chondrichthyans. Interspecific differ-ences in the diets were related to total length of the shark. Octopuses were more frequent in the diet of O. ornatus (dwarf <b>ornate</b> <b>wobbegong)</b> than other wobbegong species, possibly through the smaller adult size facilitating capture of octopuses in small holes/ crevices. Orectolobus halei fed more frequently on pelagic species and chondrichthyans, possibly because of their greater mobility. Wobbegongs feed at a high trophic level, and their removal from their ecosystem may impact lower trophic levels...|$|E
40|$|Wobbegongs are benthic sharks {{that are}} commercially {{targeted}} in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Given a dramatic reduction {{of more than}} 50 % in landed catch in a decade, {{there is a clear}} need to ensure that basic ecological data such as distribution and abundance are available for management use. Opportunistic sightings of wobbegongs collected by recreational scuba-divers were used to assess the distribution and relative abundance of wobbegongs in NSW. From July 2003 until January 2005, 304 dives were undertaken by recreational divers and 454 wobbegongs were reported. Larger numbers of wobbegongs were sighted in northern compared to southern NSW. Spotted and ornate wobbegongs were sighted in similar numbers, but species composition was highly variable across locations. Only a few juvenile and newborn spotted wobbegongs were sighted, whereas small ornate wobbegongs were mostly sighted north of central NSW. The latter were possibly the third, cryptic species, the dwarf <b>ornate</b> <b>wobbegong.</b> The paucity of sightings of small wobbegongs suggests that juveniles and newborns are inconspicuous to divers or that small wobbegongs are found in areas not visited by divers. Potential species and size segregation suggest that closing areas to fishing may enable populations to sustain current levels of commercial exploitation. The cost-effectiveness of using recreational scuba-divers to opportunistically collect distribution and relative abundance data was apparent from this study. However, the lack of spatial and temporal homogeneity in diving effort suggests that future studies should consider incorporating organized surveys and a facilitator, rather than using opportunistic records of sightings. 10 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Comparative {{studies of}} the mechanosensory lateral line (MLL) have {{provided}} valuable insights into the predatory, escape and navigation behaviours of teleost and elasmobranch fishes. Recent work on the MLL in elasmobranchs has focused on canal morphology and pore topography in batoid species, with considerably less detailed examination of the canal system of sharks. In this study, the spatial arrangement of MLL canals and pit organs, and the morphology of the sensory neuromasts, are described for two species of wobbegong shark: the spotted wobbegong Orectolobus maculatus and the <b>ornate</b> <b>wobbegong</b> O. ornatus. Wobbegongs are benthic species that employ an ambush feeding strategy, and it is hypothesised that the MLL will be adapted for both these ecological traits. The spatial distribution of the MLL system in both species is broadly similar to other elasmobranchs, with a dorsal concentration of canals and pit organs that is ideally suited for detecting water flow {{over the top of}} the head. This arrangement may facilitate the detection of prey and predators swimming above and in front of the shark. The non-pored canals positioned directly above the mouth may be used as mechanotactile receptors to optimise 2 ̆ 7 touch 2 ̆ 7 sensation when feeding. Wobbegong canal and pit organ neuromast hair cell morphology is typical of other sharks; however, canal neuromast sensory tissue differs from other elasmobranch species in that it is not continuous throughout the canals. The study provides evidence that the MLL system of wobbegong sharks is well adapted for their rather unique feeding mode and benthic lifestyle...|$|E
40|$|Several visual traits have {{previously}} been assessed in elasmobranchs; however, {{few studies have}} examined and compared multiple visual attributes within a particular genus. The primary advantage of studying closely related species is that any differences between them are more likely to reflect functional ecological adaptations rather than the effects of phylogenetic separation. In this study, the visual capabilities of 4 wobbegong shark species, which vary in life-history and/or habitat, were examined: the western wobbegong (Orectolobus hutchinsi), the spotted wobbegong (O. maculatus), the <b>ornate</b> <b>wobbegong</b> (O. ornatus) and the dwarf spotted wobbegong (O. parvimaculatus). The retinae of all 4 wobbegong species are duplex; rod and cone photoreceptors can be distinguished easily on the basis of morphology. Some variation in relative eye size exists, with O. parvimaculatus possessing the largest eyes. The topographic distribution of cells within the ganglion cell layer of O. hutchinsi reveals a weakly elongated central visual streak of increased cell density, mediating a higher spatial resolving power of 2. 06 cycles deg⁻¹ in the frontal visual field. Retinal topography of O. maculatus and O. parvimaculatus is similar, with both possessing a dorsal horizontal streak facilitating an increased spatial resolving power of 3. 51 cycles deg⁻¹ and 3. 91 cycles deg⁻¹, respectively, in the lower visual field. O. parvimaculatus also possesses an area of increased cell density in the naso-ventral region of the retina, mediating acute vision in the upper caudal region of the visual field. While all 4 species have visual systems optimised for increased visual sensitivity, O. maculatus and O. parvimaculatus appear to be particularly well suited to activity under low light conditions. 13 page(s...|$|E
40|$|The {{topographic}} {{analysis of}} retinal ganglion and photoreceptor cell distributions yields valuable information {{for assessing the}} visual capabilities and behavioral ecology of vertebrates.

Hemiscyllium ocellatum; and the east Australia shovelnose ray, Aptychotrema rostrata, for regional specializations mediating zones of improved visual ability. These species represent a range of lifestyles: benthic, mid-water. diurnal, and nocturnal. Both photoreceptors (visualized using differential interference contrast optics) and ganglion cells (stained with cresyl violet) in the retina are extensively sampled, and their spatial distribution {{is found to be}} nonuniform. exhibiting areae or "visual streaks. " In general, the topographic distribution,; of both cell populations are in register and match well with respect to the location of regions of high density.

40|$|Elasmobranchs {{are thought}} to possess an acute sense of smell, but the {{relationship}} between the anatomy of their olfactory organs and their sensory ecology is poorly understood. Moreover, the ecological diversity of elasmobranchs as a group indicates that there might be considerable interspecific variation in the importance of the olfactory sense. Wobbegong sharks, with their sedentary lifestyle and ambush predatory technique, probably utilize their senses differently than other shark species, making it difficult to generalize about their olfactory capabilities and olfactiondependent behaviors. In this study, the number of olfactory lamellae and the surface area of the olfactory epithelium were measured as a means of assessing relative olfactory sensitivity in four species of wobbegong shark (the Western wobbegong, Orectolobus hutchinsi; the spotted wobbegong, O. maculatus; the <b>ornate</b> <b>wobbegong,</b> O. ornatus; and the dwarf spotted wobbegong, O. parvimaculatus). We also present a phylogenetic comparative analysis between wobbegongs and other elasmobranchs for which published data on olfactory morphology are available. There is {{a significant difference in the}} total number of olfactory lamellae between most species, but not between O. hutchinsi and O. maculatus, although the olfactory sensory surface area is comparable between these two species and O. ornatus. Orectolobus parvimaculatus has a significantly larger olfactory sensory surface area than the other three species, and there is a positive relationship between total body length and olfactory sensory surface area for all four species. Assuming that these morphological measures are true indications of olfactory capability, the olfactory abilities of wobbegongs are as good as, or better than, other benthic elasmobranchs. Interspecific differences in olfactory ability within this group of benthic ambush predators could indicate relative differences in prey detection, intraspecific recognition and mate detection. 11 page(s...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} used {{wobbegong}} sharks (genus Orectolobus) {{to assess the}} threshold value proposed by previous research to categorize strict lecithotrophic from incipient histotrophic species. Totals of 236 and 135 <b>ornate</b> <b>wobbegong</b> Orectolobus ornatus and spotted wobbegong Orectolobus maculatus, respectively, were collected from the New South Wales commercial fishery between June 2003 and May 2006. Eight pregnant gulf wobbegong Orectolobus halei were also recorded outside the sampling period for the first time. The three species were reproductively synchronous with a gestation of c. 10 - 11 months. Embryos started to be macroscopically visible during January and external yolk sacs were fully absorbed by June to July when embryos were c. 200 mm total length (LT). Internal yolk sacs were first observed during April to May when embryos were c. 160 mm LT, reached a peak during June and persisted in embryos immediately prior to parturition. The total wet mass from uterine egg to full-term embryos increased by 44 - 89 % and 45 - 62 %, whereas the total organic mass decreased by 32 - 33 % and 26 %, for O. o rnatus and O. maculatus, respectively, suggesting that these species are strict lecithotrophic yolk-sac viviparous sharks with no maternal nutrient input. A {{review of the literature}} identified various issues and suggested that the previously proposed organic mass loss threshold value separating strict lecithotrophic species from incipient histotrophic species might not be appropriate. Instead, it is recommended that a combination of methods (e. g. estimation of organic mass gain or loss between ovarian egg and developed embryo, histology and electron microscopy of the uterus, radio-tracer assay and uterine fluid analysis throughout gestation) is used to discern between strict lecithotrophic and incipient histotrophic species. 15 page(s...|$|E

In New South Wales, Australia, wobbegong sharks (Orectolobidae) have been commercially targetted by the Ocean Trap and Line Fishery since 1991. A catch decrease of ca. 50 % in a decade lead to concern over the sustainability of the fishery and to wobbegongs being listed as vulnerable in NSW under the World Conservation Union Red List assessment.

40|$|Investigation of {{ligament}} morphology and musculoskeletal mechanics in elasmobranchs {{that use}} suction (white-spotted bamboo shark, Chiloscyllium plagiosum and <b>Ornate</b> <b>wobbegong,</b> Orectolobus ornatus), bite (sandbar shark, Carcharhinus plumbeus) and generalist (suction and bite, spiny dogfish, Squalus acanthias) feeding mechanisms reveal ligament morphologies and musculoskeletal mechanics specific to feeding mode, and novel ligament linkages in obligate suction feeders (C. plagiosum and O. ornatus) that couple jaw and hyoid depression. In vivo data of muscle strain, activation, skeletal kinematics and buccal pressure during suction capture and prey processing in C. plagiosum support {{the function of}} linkage systems in suction feeders during both behaviors. ^ The arrangements of the postspiracularis (LPI), hyomandibuloceratohyal (LHCC), hyoidiomandibular (LHMM) and hyomandibuloceratohyomandibular ligaments (LHCM) morphology at the chondrocraniohyomandibular (CHMA), hyomandibuloceratohyal (HMCA) and hyomandibulomandibular (HMMA) articulations are specific to feeding mode. The LPI and LHCC in Chiloscyllium plagiosum and Orectolobus ornatus and Squalus acanthias forms a moveable pulley and tether system that link hyomandibula (HMD) depression with ceratohyal (CER) in suction feeders and feeding generalists. The LHMM is split into two divisions in the four species the LHMM (medial division) and LHML (lateral division). The LHMM of C. plumbeus and S. acanthias forms a twisting linkage between the HMDs and CERs that results in anterolateral and ventral motion of the HMD in bite and generalist feeders. ^ Musculoskeletal morphology and mechanics underlining jaw and hyoid depression and jaw adduction in Chiloscyllium plagiosum, Carcharhinus plumbeus, and Squalus acanthias reveal a mosaic of convergent and divergent features. Coracomandibularis (CM, jaw depressor) physiological cross-sectional PSCA is the main contributor to variation in force output to the lower jaw during jaw depression in the three species. Morphology of the coracohyoideus (CH) and coracoarcualis (CA) (hyoid depressors) are similar in the three species. Mechanics of hyoid depression in C. plagiosum differ from C. plumbeus and S. acanthias in that the initial in-lever is {{much smaller than the}} other species due to alignment of the hyoid with the hyomandibuloceratohyal articulation. Application of four-bar linkage mechanics to the jaws and hyoid of C. plagiosum suggests that the jaw and hyoid depression are linked by the lateral hyoidiomandibular ligament (LHML-linkage) and result in levels of force transfer to the jaws and hyoid during suction feeding that are greater than that possible from un-linked systems. The jaw adductors and protruders in the three species, quadratomandibularis (QM), preorbitalis (PO) and levator palatoquadrati (LP, a jaw proturder in C. plumbeus only), are subdivided and complex in architecture. ^ Simultaneously measurement of hyoid and jaw kinematics, buccal pressure and fascicle shortening and muscle activity in the CM, CH and CA using Sonomicrometry in Chiloscyllium plagiosum reveal interaction of the feeding muscles and the LHML-linkage. Active shortening of the CM occurs prior to the onset of jaw opening and buccal pressure decrease, while jaw depression to peak gape occurs during CM lengthening. The CH actively lengthens and the CA actively shortens prior to jaw and hyoid depression. Peak active CM shortening, onset of active CH shortening, depression of the hyoid, and buccal pressure decrease occur simultaneously. A catch mechanism involving the LHML, LHMM and CM that would allow the CH to be lengthened by the CA and released, resulting in high-powered expansion during suction feeding is proposed. The CM initiates jaw lower depression while the CH and CA drive the jaw and hyoid to peak depression. The LHML in bamboo sharks appears to be a biomechanical link coupling lower jaw and hyoid depression that is convergent with the mandibulohyoid ligament in bony fishes. During bite processing, the CM shortens to depress the lower jaw and hyoid. Elevation of the hyoid prior to the onset of jaw depression results in increased positive orobranchial pressure and may help to secure prey in the mouth when the jaws are repositioned to deliver a processing bite. However, the LHML-linkage may constrain PO and QM function. (Abstract shortened by UMI.) ...|$|E
40|$|Elasmobranchs (sharks, skates and rays) {{possess a}} {{sophisticated}} array of sensory systems that are, undoubtedly, {{of great importance}} to their survival. Representing the earliest group of extant jawed vertebrates, detailed study of elasmobranch sensory biology can provide much-needed information {{on the evolution of}} vertebrate sensory systems. Some sensory modalities have been studied in detail in several species, but few studies have examined and compared multiple sensory systems within a particular genus. By examining the morphology and physiology of the different sensory systems, correlations can be made within both an ecological and a phylogenetic context. The primary advantage of studying the sensory systems of closely related species is that any differences between them are more likely to reflect functional ecological adaptations rather than the effects of phylogenetic separation. Wobbegongs sharks (Orectolobidae) are a distinctive group of benthic sharks that are characterised by a highly patterned, dorso-ventrally compressed body. Wobbegongs are ambush predators that employ a unique ‘sit and wait’ strategy. Their morphologically distinct body shape, sedentary lifestyle and mode of predation suggest that wobbegong sharks may differ from other elasmobranchs in how they employ their different sensory systems. In this study, four wobbegong species that vary in life-history and/or habitat were examined: the Western wobbegong, Orectolobus hutchinsi, the spotted wobbegong, O. maculatus, the <b>ornate</b> <b>wobbegong,</b> O. ornatus and the dwarf spotted wobbegong, O. parvimaculatus. Vision and olfaction were assessed in all four species. Detailed assessment of electroreception and mechanoreception (lateral line) was conducted only for O. maculatus and O. ornatus. Morphology, physiology and molecular genetics were examined in the visual system, and morphological assessment was conducted for the olfactory, electroreceptive and mechanosensory lateral line systems. The retinae of all four wobbegong species are duplex; rod and cone photoreceptors can be distinguished easily on the basis of morphology. The wavelength of maximum absorbance (λmax) of the rod visual pigment is 496 nm in O. hutchinsi, 484 nm in O. maculatus, 498 nm in O. ornatus and 494 nm in O. parvimaculatus. Absorbance spectra of cone visual pigments were only obtained from O. maculatus and O. ornatus. Only one spectral type of cone was measured in each species, with max values at 553 nm and 560 nm, respectively. Partial sequences were obtained for the rh 1 opsin gene in all four species, and for the lws opsin gene in every species except O. parvimaculatus. The apparent presence of only one cone pigment raises the possibility that wobbegongs do not have colour vision. The topographic distribution of cells within the ganglion cell layer of Orectolobus hutchinsi show a weakly elongated central visual streak of increased cell density, mediating a higher spatial resolving power of 2. 06 cycles deg- 1 in the frontal visual field. Retinal topography of O. maculatus and O. parvimaculatus are similar, with both possessing a dorsal horizontal streak facilitating increased spatial resolving power in the lower visual field. Orectolobus parvimaculatus also possesses an area of increased cell density in the naso-ventral region of the retina mediating acute vision in the upper caudal region of the visual field. Spatial resolving power reaches 3. 51 cycles deg- 1 and 3. 91 cycles deg- 1 in O. maculatus and O. parvimaculatus, respectively. The topographical variation in retinal sampling indicates that different regions of the visual field are relatively more important and may reflect interspecific differences in behaviour and habitat. The mean number of lamellae in the olfactory rosette is 47. 0 for Orectolobus hutchinsi, 48. 7 for O. maculatus, 40. 7 for O. ornatus and 55. 7 for O. parvimaculatus. Olfactory sensory epithelial surface area is comparable in O. hutchinsi, O. maculatus and O. ornatus, while O. parvimaculatus has a significantly larger surface area, relative to body size, compared to the other three species. Olfaction appears to be relatively more important in O. parvimaculatus, especially during low light conditions, when vision is limited. The distribution of ampullary electroreceptive pores and mechanosensory lateral line pores (pored and non-pored canals) is almost entirely concentrated on the dorsal region of the head in both O. maculatus and O. ornatus. This suggests that both sensory systems are well-adapted and specialised to detect prey swimming overhead when the wobbegong is sitting motionless, thereby facilitating its unique, predatory, “lie-in-wait’ ambush strategy. Orectolobus hutchinsi and O. ornatus appear to be well-suited to both diurnal and nocturnal activities, whereas O. maculatus and O. parvimaculatus are probably most active under low light conditions. Sensory system information inferred from this study correlates well with what is known of the diet and habitat of the four wobbegong species examined. Therefore, in the absence of other biological data, sensory neurobiological approaches can be used to predict such bio-ecological factors as predatory strategy, habitat preference, and behaviour. Electrophysiology and behavioural approaches will provide major advances in future studies in order to understand how each of the different senses is integrated at both peripheral and central levels and how such studies are vital to our understanding of evolutionary and ecological processes...|$|E
