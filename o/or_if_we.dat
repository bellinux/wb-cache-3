And we shall do so if we {{establish}} similitudes as striking as possible; if we set up images that are not many or vague but active; if we assign to them exceptional beauty or singular ugliness; if we ornament some of them, as with crowns or purple cloaks, so that the similitude may be more distinct to us; <b>or</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> somehow disfigure them, as by introducing one stained with blood or soiled with mud and smeared with red paint, so that its form is more striking, or by assigning certain comic effects to our images, for that, too, will ensure our remembering them more readily.|$|E

The band's April 3, 1994 concert in Atlanta, Georgia at the Fox Theatre was {{broadcast}} live on the radio in the United States. A few days later, the body of Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain was found in his home in Seattle due to an apparent suicide, which deeply affected Vedder. At the band's April 8, 1994 concert in Fairfax, Virginia at the Patriot Center, Vedder proclaimed, [...] "I don't {{think any of us}} would be in this room tonight if it weren't for Kurt Cobain." [...] Vedder later said that [...] "the day that we found out about Kurt... I was just spinning. I was lost and didn't know if we should play, <b>or</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> should just go home, <b>or</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> should attend the services.

500|$|Chelsea manager José Mourinho {{used his}} pre-match {{interview}} {{to state that}} his previous wins in the tournament had changed the way that clubs approach the League Cup: [...] "Lots of teams have followed us since then when we took the League Cup as a real competition, as a real challenge.

Despite opining that the two teams and the match officials would act fairly, he criticised players who dive, despite not naming any names.

500|$|The {{sessions}} were particularly difficult for DeLonge, who suffered chronic back pain. [...] "When your back is killing {{you and you}} have to have surgery and all this stuff, it's just kind of hard to keep a focus on the happier times in your life," [...] he told MTV News. [...] "You end up writing all these songs about feeling sad and confused." [...] He often could only stand and sing for five minutes at a time before having to lay down again. Journalist Joe Shooman writes that the album followed a DIY spirit, rather than spending [...] "months and months refining and polishing everything for a major label and international pop market." [...] DeLonge intended to pay for the project himself, but when an A representative heard four unfinished songs, MCA—the record label Blink-182 was on—wanted to finance the album. DeLonge's manager convinced him it would be a bad idea to pass up someone else paying for its distribution. According to Boukas, an MCA representative dropped in on the sessions and was pleased with what he heard. [...] "When we wrote this album, we didn't know if it was going to be on a label <b>or</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> were going to put it out ourselves," [...] Barker said at the time.

2500|$|During {{the last}} two decades - when most of the works shown here were made – the {{activities}} of the poster designer, the printmaker, the illustrator, and the film director have completed each other. Many motive, stylistic features, technical solutions appeared in all of the media and for Orosz it seemingly did not cause any problem to cross the borders of the different genres. When he was drawing a poster usually he did it with the preciseness of illustrators, when he was illustrating a book, he did it with the narrative mood of filmmakers, if he was animating films, sometimes he used the several layers approach of etchers and engravers and for prints he often chose the emblematic simplifying way of depiction of posters. If we call him only a poster designer based on his functional prints, we narrow down his field of activity, we go closer to the truth if we associate him with „postering" [...] as a way of thinking, <b>or</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> call his many sided image depicting ourselves and our age as the poster-mirror of István Orosz.

2500|$|Propositional {{logic is}} closed under truth-functional connectives. [...] That is to say, for any {{proposition}} , [...] {{is also a}} proposition. [...] Likewise, for any propositions [...] and , [...] is a proposition, and similarly for disjunction, conditional, and biconditional. [...] This implies that, for instance, [...] is a proposition, and {{so it can be}} conjoined with another proposition. [...] In order to represent this, we need to use parentheses to indicate which proposition is conjoined with which. [...] For instance, [...] is not a well-formed formula, because we do not know if we are conjoining [...] with [...] <b>or</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> are conjoining [...] with [...] [...] Thus we must write either [...] to represent the former, or [...] to represent the latter. [...] By evaluating the truth conditions, we see that both expressions have the same truth conditions (will be true in the same cases), and moreover that any proposition formed by arbitrary conjunctions will have the same truth conditions, regardless of the location of the parentheses. [...] This means that conjunction is associative, however, one should not assume that parentheses never serve a purpose. [...] For instance, the sentence [...] does not have the same truth conditions of , so they are different sentences distinguished only by the parentheses. [...] One can verify this by the truth-table method referenced above.|$|E
2500|$|On 31 March 1982, {{soon after}} the Argentine {{invasion}} of the Falklands, Leach brushed aside serious doubts from the Secretary of State for Defence Sir John Nott and addressed the Prime Minister on the appropriate course of action. The Chief of the Defence Staff {{at the time was}} on his way back from a foreign visit, and in addressing the Prime Minister, Leach effectively bypassed the Acting Chief of the Defence Staff. When he was asked if retaking the islands was possible, he replied [...] "Yes we can recover the islands." [...] He then added [...] "and we must!" [...] Thatcher replied [...] "Why?" [...] Leach exclaimed [...] "Because if we do not, <b>or</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> pussyfoot in our actions and do not achieve complete success, in another few months we shall be living in a different country whose word counts for little." [...] Leach then explained how the task force would take shape and what ships would be involved: when asked about the lack of available aircraft carriers, Leach reassured the Prime Minister that the two small carriers available would suffice. Thatcher approved this and preparations were made to send a task force to set sail to retake the Falklands. On account of his determination, Andrew Marr referred to Leach as Thatcher's [...] "Knight in Shining Gold Braid" [...] in his documentary series History of Modern Britain. Upon his retirement in December 1982, Leach was promoted to Admiral of the Fleet.|$|E

2500|$|The second {{approach}} {{involves the}} determination of a point on the Mohr circle called the pole or the origin of planes. Any straight line drawn from the pole will intersect the Mohr circle at a point that represents the state of stress on a plane inclined at the same orientation (parallel) in space as that line. Therefore, knowing the stress components [...] and [...] on any particular plane, one can draw a line parallel to that plane through the particular coordinates [...] and [...] on the Mohr circle and find the pole as the intersection of such line with the Mohr circle. As an example, let's assume we have a state of stress with stress components , , and , as shown on Figure 7. First, we can draw a line from point [...] parallel to the plane of action of , <b>or,</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> choose otherwise, a line from point [...] parallel to the plane of action of [...] The intersection {{of any of these}} two lines with the Mohr circle is the pole. Once the pole has been determined, to find the state of stress on a plane making an angle [...] with the vertical, or in other words a plane having its normal vector forming an angle [...] with the horizontal plane, then we can draw a line from the pole parallel to that plane (See Figure 7). The normal and shear stresses on that plane are then the coordinates of the point of intersection between the line and the Mohr circle.|$|E
