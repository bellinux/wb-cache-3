The matrices are based on the minimum percentage identity of the aligned protein sequence used in calculating them.

50|$|The simple scheme {{described}} above {{focuses on the}} LZW algorithm itself. Many applications apply further encoding to the sequence of output symbols. Some package the coded stream as printable characters using some form of binary-to-text encoding; this will increase the encoded length and decrease the compression rate. Conversely, increased compression can often be achieved with an adaptive entropy encoder. Such a coder estimates the probability distribution {{for the value of}} the next symbol, based on the <b>observed</b> <b>frequencies</b> of values so far. A standard entropy encoding such as Huffman coding or arithmetic coding then uses shorter codes for values with higher probabilities.|$|E
