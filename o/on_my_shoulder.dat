25|$|Stewart grew up {{with both}} his mother and father, but his mother died {{while he was a}} {{teenager}} and his father remarried. His mother was part of the Dudgeon sept of the Noresmen. His mother was thought to be a major influence in Stewart’s life from whom he received his love and appreciation for beauty. He was a cab proprietor and later ran a farm called Pictstonhill. He was a very religious man and influenced Stewart towards missionary work. Stewart had a desire from a young age to go to Africa. He told his cousin, “I shall never be satisfied till I am in Africa with a Bible in my pocket, and a rifle <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder</b> to supply my wants.” From a very young age, James Stewart knew {{what he wanted to do}} with his life: be a missionary in Africa.|$|E

500|$|Both athletes {{participated in}} the triple jump event. Yordanys Durañona {{qualified}} for the male's event by meeting qualification standards. Dominica used their wildcard spot for Thea LaFond in the women's triple jump. Durañona was among seven other people to scratch all three of their attempted jumps, failing to achieve a mark and therefore not having a position.

500|$|Make-up effects artist Toby Lindala was {{tasked with}} {{creating}} a prop {{which would allow}} actress Sarah Koskoff to simulate a nosebleed on-camera, rather than {{through the use of}} off-screen make-up and editing tricks. However, during test shots, the prop's tubing burst, causing the stage blood to begin dripping down Koskoff's forehead, rather than from her nose. Gillian Anderson has expressed displeasure over the scene in which her character, Dana Scully, visits Fox Mulder in his motel room in her underwear to have him examine a suspicious wound which turns out to be insect bites. The actress felt that the scene was too gratuitous, saying [...] "there really wasn't a reason for it. The bites could have been <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder</b> or something." [...] However, Carter has explained that the scene was simply intended to highlight the platonic relationship between the two lead roles.|$|E

[...] Despite any hard feelings, Voorhis sent Nixon a letter of congratulations in early December 1946. Nixon and Voorhis met for an hour at Voorhis's office, and parted, according to Voorhis, as friends. In 1971, Voorhis said that the two had never spoken again.

The guard was then dragged by his security personnel. The guard said his intention was to kill Gandhi because of [...] "the damage he had caused" [...] to Sri Lanka. Wijemuni was imprisoned for two-and-a-half years for the assault Gandhi later said about the incident: When I was inspecting the guard of honour and as I walked past one person, I saw through {{the corner of my}} eye some movement.

At one stage as an addict, Cole worked as a prostitute’s tout in order to fund her drug habit. Cole said she began recreational drug use while attending the University of Massachusetts Amherst. She was arrested in Toronto, Canada, for possession of heroin in 1975. Cole spiralled out of control – including one incident during which she refused to evacuate a burning building, and another during which her young son Robert nearly drowned in the family swimming pool while {{she was on a}} drug binge.

2500|$|In December 1941 it was {{announced}} that Rogers had entered into a deal with United Artists, who would distribute his independent films. From 1943 through 1947 he would produce a film per year for the studio, including 1946's classic Angel <b>on</b> <b>My</b> <b>Shoulder</b> starring Paul Muni, Anne Baxter and Claude Rains.
