25|$|It was a {{pitch to}} sell Ladd to women filmgoers, {{though he had}} not changed one iota {{and he did not}} have a {{noticeable}} romantic aura. But Paramount hoped that women might feel that beneath the rock-like expression there smouldered fires of passion, <b>or</b> <b>something</b> <b>like.</b> His black-lashed eyes, however, gave nothing away; it was 'take me as I am' or 'I'm the boss around here'. He never flirted nor even seemed interested (which is one of the reasons he and Lake were so effective together).|$|E
25|$|Ron Meyer’s {{recruiting}} {{strategy was}} very aggressive. He pursued and attracted the finest football players {{from all of}} Texas. Not all of his players were acquired the ethical way, however; his recruiting staff was paying recruits, and Meyer was letting it slide. According to Steve Endicott the first payments came at Kashmere High School in Houston, Texas. “... It was Ron, Myself, Rob (Robin Buddecke, Endicott’s assistant), and maybe another coach...I can’t pin it down it was maybe twenty or fifty bucks <b>or</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> that we gave”. the Kashmere football players would call the SMU recruiters “Santa Claus”.

25|$|Although it manifests {{differently}} in different animals, REM sleep <b>or</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> {{it occurs in}} all land mammals {{as well as in}} birds. The primary criteria used to identify REM are the change in electrical activity, measured by EEG, and loss of muscle tone, interspersed with bouts of twitching in phasic REM. The amount of REM sleep and cycling varies among animals; predators enjoy more REM sleep than prey. Larger animals also tend to stay in REM for longer, possibly because higher thermal inertia of their brains and bodies allows them to tolerate longer suspension of thermoregulation. The period (full cycle of REM and non-REM) lasts for about 90 minutes in humans, 22 minutes in cats, and 12 minutes in rats. In utero, mammals spend more than half (50–80%) of a 24-hour day in REM sleep.|$|E

His stories, including Buldozeristul ("The Bulldozer Operator"), {{winner of the}} Editura Nemira prize for 1997, saw print in various venues during the late 1990s. Lungu also debuted as a dramatist, his work being included in two anthologies of young Romanian theater. The first among these writings is the 1995 Lecție.

Having made his editorial debut in short story with the 1999 collection Cheta la flegmă, he regularly published new works of fiction and cultural analysis over the following years. Between 2001 and 2002, he took over as editor in chief of Timpul.|$|E

500|$|Jolie next starred {{opposite}} Antonio Banderas as his mail-order bride in Original Sin (2001), {{the first}} of a string of films that were poorly received by critics and audiences alike. The New York Times critic Elvis Mitchell questioned Jolie's decision to follow her Oscar-winning performance with [...] "soft-core nonsense." [...] The romantic comedy Life <b>or</b> <b>Something</b> <b>Like</b> It (2002), though equally unsuccessful, marked an unusual choice for Jolie. Salons Allen Barra considered her ambitious newscaster character a rare attempt at playing a conventional women's role, noting that her performance [...] "doesn't get off the ground until a scene where she goes punk and leads a group of striking bus workers in singing 'Satisfaction'". Despite her lack of box office success, Jolie remained in demand as an actress; in 2002, she established herself among Hollywood's highest-paid actresses, earning $10–$15 million per film for the next five years.|$|E
500|$|Jolie's first role in 1999 was in Pushing Tin, a {{critical}} and commercial failure; however, her next film The Bone Collector {{emerged as a}} commercial success.

A role opposite Nicolas Cage in the heist film Gone in 60 Seconds (2000) proved to be her highest-grossing to that point. Jolie achieved worldwide recognition as the eponymous archaeologist in [...] (2001), an action film based on the Tomb Raider video game series. Despite negative reviews, the film had the biggest opening weekend for a film featuring an action heroine. This was followed by roles in two box-office failures—the 2001 erotic thriller Original Sin and the 2002 romantic comedy Life <b>or</b> <b>Something</b> <b>Like</b> It. Jolie reprised the role of Lara Croft in the sequel [...] (2003).|$|E
