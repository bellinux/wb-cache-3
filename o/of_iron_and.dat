5|$|After the {{industrial}} scale production of cadmium started in the 1930s and 1940s, the major application of cadmium was the coating <b>of</b> <b>iron</b> <b>and</b> steel to prevent corrosion; in 1944, 62% and in 1956, 59% of the cadmium in the United States was used for plating. In 1956, 24% of the cadmium in the United States was used for a second application in red, orange and yellow pigments from sulfides and selenides of cadmium.|$|E
5|$|Another small-bore cannon of the 14th {{century was}} the culverin, whose name derives from the snake-like handles {{attached}} to it.

5|$|During the Middle Precambrian {{a shallow}} inland sea covered {{much of the}} Lake Superior region and formed the Animikie Group, which are layers of {{sedimentary}} rocks which unconformably overlies 2700-million-year-old Archean rocks. This group contains both the Rove and Gunflint Iron formations. The Rove Formation is {{the youngest of the}} many Animikie layers; it consists of gently tilted fine-grained sediments. It is composed of greywackes and black shale, and contains lower concentrations <b>of</b> <b>iron</b> <b>and</b> taconite than the underlying Gunflint Iron Formation does.|$|E
5|$|Metalwork was an {{important}} and well-developed craft, and metal tools such as axes, mammoties and hoes were widely used. Weapons and tools <b>of</b> <b>iron</b> <b>and</b> steel were produced in large scale for the military.

5|$|On {{geophysical}} evidence, {{most of the}} nickel on Earth {{is believed}} to be in the Earth's outer and inner cores. Kamacite and taenite are naturally occurring alloys <b>of</b> <b>iron</b> <b>and</b> nickel. For kamacite, the alloy is usually in the proportion of 90:10 to 95:5, although impurities (such as cobalt or carbon) may be present, while for taenite the nickel content is between 20% and 65%. Kamacite and taenite are also found in nickel iron meteorites.|$|E

5|$|Small {{amounts of}} oxidizers like sodium nitrate {{are added to}} enhance the reaction. The result is {{aluminium}} oxide and ferroniobium, an alloy <b>of</b> <b>iron</b> <b>and</b> niobium used in the steel production. Ferroniobium contains between 60 and 70% niobium. Without iron oxide, the aluminothermic process is used to produce niobium. Further purification is necessary to reach the grade for superconductive alloys. Electron beam melting under vacuum is the method used by the two major distributors of niobium.|$|E

5|$|After {{the defeat}} of Perseus at Pydna in 168BC, the Roman Senate allowed the reopening <b>of</b> <b>iron</b> <b>and</b> copper mines, but forbade the mining of gold and silver by the four newly {{established}} autonomous client states that replaced the monarchy in Macedonia. The law may originally have been conceived by the Senate due to the fear that material wealth gained from gold and silver mining operations would allow the Macedonians to fund an armed rebellion. The Romans were perhaps also concerned with stemming inflation caused by an increased money supply from Macedonian silver mining. The Macedonians continued minting silver coins between 167 and 148BC (i.e. just before {{the establishment of the}} Roman province of Macedonia), and when the Romans lifted the ban on Macedonian silver mining in 158BC it may simply have reflected the local reality of this illicit practice continuing regardless of the Senate's decree.|$|E
5|$|During {{his student}} days, Gaudí {{attended}} craft workshops, {{such as those}} taught by Eudald Puntí, Llorenç Matamala and Joan Oñós, where he learned the basic aspects of techniques relating to architecture, including sculpture, carpentry, wrought ironwork, stained glass, ceramics, plaster modelling, etc. He also absorbed new technological developments, integrating into his technique the use <b>of</b> <b>iron</b> <b>and</b> reinforced concrete in construction. Gaudí took a broad view of architecture as a multifunctional design, in which every single detail in an arrangement has to be harmoniously made and well-proportioned. This knowledge allowed him to design architectural projects, including {{all the elements of}} his works, from furnishings to illumination to wrought ironwork.|$|E
