[...] He touted the period since the last election as [...] "five years of progress". [...] In keeping with the UFA's view of good government as being the non-partisan administration of business rather than any clash of ideologies, he concluded his speeches by asking [...] "Are we going to return in this Province to Government based on the two-party system, <b>or</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> going to continue to work for a better ?" ...|$|E
500|$|... "Human" [...] was {{released}} in October 2008 with Brandon Flowers describing the song as [...] "Johnny Cash meets the Pet Shop Boys". The song {{went on to become}} a huge hit worldwide, the lyric [...] "Are we human, <b>or</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> dancer?" [...] created much confusion and debate due to its grammar and ambiguity, with some believing the lyric was [...] "dancers" [...] or [...] "denser" [...] rather than [...] "dancer", Flowers explained that the line was inspired by a Hunter S. Thompson quote where he stated America was raising [...] "a generation of dancers". It has since been voted by one poll as the most confusing song lyric of all time.|$|E

500|$|Originally, Hakim did {{not intend}} to be an actress, but an {{architect}} or psychologist. However, she was cast in Teguh Karya's 1973 film Cinta Pertama after he saw pictures of her modelling in a magazine; despite only modelling to help her friend and not wanting to act, she was unable to decline Karya's request for fear of being impolite to such a [...] "warm and friendly" [...] person. She later described Karya as having [...] "reeled [...] in, slowly, slowly, like a fisherma," [...] and considered leaving acting after wrapping up filming. Her work in Cinta Pertama garnered her a Citra Award for Best Actress, which convinced her to continue acting. Karya later told her that he had fought with his producer over her casting; the producer expressed concern that Hakim was [...] "too thin and had no chest," [...] to which Karya replied [...] "are we selling a film <b>or</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> selling breasts?" ...|$|E
500|$|... "I'm Goin' Down" [...] {{features}} an energetic rhythm, propelled by a heavy drumbeat by Weinberg, and contains a saxophone solo by Clemons. The music has a basic chord progression of A–E–F#m–D. In concerts in 1984, Springsteen introduced the song by describing the diminishing intimacy and sexual activity {{that can occur}} {{over the course of}} a romantic relationship: [...] " [...] you're making love to 'em all the time, three or four times a day. Then you come back a little bit later, and, uh-oh... it's like 'Are you gonna make love to me tonight, <b>or</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> gonna wait for the full moon again', y'know?" [...] The song's lyrics include lines such as [...] "I'm sick and tired of you setting me up / Setting me up just to knock-a knock-a knock-a me down" [...] and [...] "You used to love to drive me wild / But lately girl you get your kicks from just driving me down". The lyrics later turn into a stream of gibberish syllables.|$|E

Steve Lillywhite {{was brought in}} to produce a few tracks during these subsequent sessions. In pre-release interviews, U2 compared the extent of their expected shift in musical style to that of Achtung Baby. The band scaled back these experimental pursuits, however; Mullen,Jr. noted, [...] "at a certain stage, reality hits, and you go, 'What are we gonna do with this stuff?' Are we going to release this sort of meandering experimentation, <b>or</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> gonna knock some songs out of this?" [...] Bono shared this opinion, stating, [...] "We went so far out on the Sufi singing and the sort of ecstatic-music front, that we had to ground it and find a counterpoint." [...] Eno commented that many of [...] "the more contemplative and sonically adventurous songs" [...] had been dropped, attributing the lack of African-inspired music to its sounding [...] "synthetic" [...] and unconvincing when paired with other songs.|$|E

5000|$|In 1987 a {{group of}} Flora {{officials}} formed the so-called [...] "Barbed Wire Choir" [...] and recorded a music video {{in an attempt to}} land a state prison. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5-d2WOgpfQ The song featured several city officials, including the mayor, asking then-Gov. Jim Thompson [...] "Is <b>we</b> <b>is</b> <b>or</b> <b>is</b> <b>we</b> isn't/gonna get ourselves a prison." [...] After being shown on local TV stations, the video gained the attention of national programs such as MTV, Good Morning America and The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers. Flora ultimately lost its bid to host the new prison.|$|R
500|$|The film drew {{a number}} of {{negative}} reactions from the film critics. Subhra Gupta gave the film a half-star out of five in The Indian Express, saying [...] "After all the shoot-outs and bang-bangs are over, you are left with a film which leaves you with so little new that you wonder if there's any juice left in this style of retro gangsta flick. <b>Or</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> heading for a third-time-in-Mumbai-Tibara?" [...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave the film 1.5 out of five stars, describing the film as the [...] "equivalent of getting a root canal". He criticised the naivety of the three leads: Kumar for his [...] "in-your-face flamboyance", Khan for playing an [...] "urban rich kid slumming it out at a dress-up party" [...] and both for [...] "rat-a-tat punch lines", but praised Sonali Bendre's cameo as Mumtaz. Mohar Basu gave the film two out of five stars in Koimoi, criticising the melodrama and the [...] "lacklustre chemistry", remarking that the film [...] "lacks the effervescence and naturalness of its prequel".|$|E
500|$|In 2008, Popular Mechanics named The Truman Show {{as one of}} the 10 most prophetic {{science fiction}} films. Journalist Erik Sofge argued that the story {{reflects}} the falseness of reality television. [...] "Truman simply lives, and the show's popularity is its straightforward voyeurism. And, like Big Brother, Survivor, and every other reality show on the air, none of his environment is actually real." [...] He deemed it an eerie coincidence that Big Brother made its debut a year after the film's release, and he also compared the film to the 2003 program The Joe Schmo Show: [...] "Unlike Truman, Matt Gould could see the cameras, but all of the other contestants were paid actors, playing the part of various reality-show stereotypes. While Matt eventually got all of the prizes in the rigged contest, the show's central running joke was in the same existential ballpark as The Truman Show." [...] Weir declared, [...] "There has always been this question: Is the audience getting dumber? <b>Or</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> filmmakers patronizing them? Is this what they want? Or is this what we're giving them? But the public went to my film in large numbers. And that has to be encouraging." ...|$|E
500|$|The main {{theme of}} Minority Report {{is the classic}} {{philosophical}} debate of free will vs. determinism. One of the main questions the film raises is whether the future is set or whether free will can alter the future. As critic C.A. Wolski commented, [...] "At the outset, Minority Report... promises to mine some deep subject matter, to do with: do we possess free will <b>or</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> predestined to our fate?" [...] However, {{there is also the}} added question of whether the precogs' visions are correct. As reviewer James Berardinelli asked, [...] "is the Precogs' vision accurate, or has it in some way been tampered with? Perhaps Anderton isn't actually going to kill, but has been set up by a clever and knowledgeable criminal who wants him out of the way." [...] The precog Agatha also states that since Anderton knows his future, he can change it. However, the film also indicates that Anderton's knowledge of the future may actually be the factor that causes Leo Crow's death. Berardinelli describes this as the main paradox regarding free will vs. determinism in the film, [...] "ere's the biggest one of all: Is it possible that the act of accusing someone of a murder could begin a chain of events that leads to the slaying. In Anderton's situation, he runs because he is accused. The only reason he ends up in circumstances where he might be forced to kill is because he is a hunted man. Take away the accusation, {{and there would be no}} question of him committing a criminal act. The prediction drives the act [...] a self-fulfilling prophecy. You can see the vicious circle, and it's delicious (if a little maddening) to ponder." [...] Film scholar Dean A. Kowalski argues that in this scenario free will still exists, as the perpetrators control their actions, and the precogs' visions are but the facts that resulted from their choices.|$|E

Are we to extend our concern to all the beings capable of pleasure and pain whose feelings are affected by our conduct? <b>or</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> to confine our view to human happiness? The former view is the one adopted by Bentham and Mill, and (I believe) by the Utilitarian school generally: and is obviously most in accordance with the universality that is characteristic of their principle ... it seems arbitrary and unreasonable to exclude from the end, as so conceived, any pleasure of any sentient being." ...|$|E

We contended that economic sanctions against Iraq would result in a form of genocide against the Iraqi people and that the only correct position for the U.S. antiwar movement was to demand, 'No war against Iraq.'… The economic sanctions ultimately took the lives of more than one million Iraqis, most of them children under the age of five, according to the UN's own statistics… The question for the antiwar movement is this: are we building a movement that comprehensively challenges imperialism <b>or</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> opposed only to certain tactics employed by imperialism such as overt, unilateral military invasion?" ...|$|E
