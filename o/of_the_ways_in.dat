5|$|In {{the course}} of his {{preparing}} for a drama review, Hazlitt was in the habit of reading or rereading the play he was soon to see, and his reviews came to include extensive commentary on the plays themselves, turning rapidly from dramatic criticism to literary criticism. With Shakespeare in particular, this led to considerations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> which the actors—again, particularly his favourite Kean—communicated the message of the plays. But he also noted ways in which no actor's interpretation could live up to the dramatist's conception.|$|E

5|$|Leg before wicket (lbw) is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> which a batsman can be {{dismissed}} {{in the sport}} of cricket. Following an appeal by the fielding side, the umpire may rule a batsman out lbw if the ball would have struck the wicket, but was instead intercepted by {{any part of the}} batsman's body (except the hand holding the bat). The umpire's decision will depend on a number of criteria, including where the ball pitched, whether the ball hit in line with the wickets, and whether the batsman was attempting to hit the ball.|$|E
5|$|Scientific {{literature}} and science fiction have put forward various models <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> which extraterrestrial and human civilizations might interact. Their predictions range widely, from sophisticated civilizations that could advance human civilization {{in many areas}} to imperial powers that might draw upon the forces necessary to subjugate humanity. Some theories suggest that an extraterrestrial civilization could be advanced enough to dispense with biology, living instead inside of advanced computers.|$|E
5|$|Feminist economists' work on {{globalization}} is diverse and multifaceted. But {{much of it}} is tied together through detailed and nuanced studies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> which globalization affects women in particular and how these effects relate to socially just outcomes. Often country case studies are used for these data. Some feminist economists focus on policies involving the development of globalization. For example, Lourdes Benería argues that economic development in the Global South depends in large part on improved reproductive rights, gender equitable laws on ownership and inheritance, and policies that are sensitive to the proportion of women in the informal economy. Additionally, Nalia Kabeer discusses the impacts of a social clause that would enforce global labor standards through international trade agreements, drawing on fieldwork from Bangladesh. She argues that although these jobs may appear exploitative, for many workers in those areas they present opportunities and ways to avoid more exploitative situations in the informal economy.|$|E

25|$|A common {{image is}} the scala naturae, {{the ladder of}} nature on which animals of {{different}} species occupy successively higher rungs, with humans typically at the top.

25|$|Epistasis {{occurs when}} the {{expression}} of one gene is modified by another gene.

He also wrote four volumes, On the Use of the Indian Numerals (Ketab fi Isti'mal al-'Adad al-Hindi) which contributed greatly to diffusion of the Indian system of numeration in the Middle-East and the West. In geometry, among other works, he wrote on the theory of parallels. Also related to geometry were two works on optics. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> which he made use of mathematics as a philosopher was to attempt to disprove the eternity of the world by demonstrating that actual infinity is a mathematical and logical absurdity.|$|E
25|$|Landscape {{archaeology}} is {{the study}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> which {{people in the past}} constructed and used the environment around them. Landscape archaeology is inherently multidisciplinary in its approach to the study of culture, and is used by pre-historical, classic, and historic archaeologists. The key feature that distinguishes landscape archaeology from other archaeological approaches to sites is that there is an explicit emphasis on the sites' relationships between material culture, human alteration of land/cultural modifications to landscape, and the natural environment. The study of landscape archaeology (also sometimes referred to as the archaeology of the cultural landscape) has evolved to include how landscapes were used to create and reinforce social inequality and to announce one's social status to the community at large.|$|E
25|$|Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS): The UVIS is a remote-sensing {{instrument}} that captures {{images of the}} ultraviolet light reflected off an object, such as the clouds of Saturn and/or its rings, {{to learn more about}} their structure and composition. Designed to measure ultraviolet light over wavelengths from 55.8 to 190nm, this instrument is also a tool to help determine the composition, distribution, aerosol particle content and temperatures of their atmospheres. Unlike other types of spectrometer, this sensitive instrument can take both spectral and spatial readings. It is particularly adept at determining the composition of gases. Spatial observations take a wide-by-narrow view, only one pixel tall and 64 pixels across. The spectral dimension is 1,024 pixels per spatial pixel. Also, it can take many images that create movies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> which this material is moved around by other forces.|$|E

25|$|Language, {{linguistics}} {{and discourse}} are active {{areas of study}} in the humanities, along with literature and the arts. Discourse analysis seeks to reveal the meaning of race and the actions of racists through careful study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> which these factors of human society are described and discussed in various written and oral works. Van Dijk (1992), for example, examines the {{different ways in which}} descriptions of racism and racist actions are depicted by the perpetrators of such actions as well as by their victims. He notes that when descriptions of actions have negative implications for the majority, and especially for white elites, they are often seen as controversial and such controversial interpretations are typically marked with quotation marks or they are greeted with expressions of distance or doubt. The previously cited book, The Souls of Black Folk by W.E.B. Du Bois, represents early African-American literature that describes the author's experiences with racism when he was traveling in the South as an African American.|$|E
