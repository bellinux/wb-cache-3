The presences of synephrine and quercetine in that product are also reported. Firstly, a raspberry ketone molecule was identified in the product by preliminary TLC and confirmed by NMR analysis and mass data. To establish fingerprint profile of the product HPTLC technique was used. To obtain quantitative analysis of raspberry ketone quantities, HPLC-DAD method was performed. The chromatographic separation was performed on a reversed phase column ODS- 2 with gradient elution with acetonitrile-water. In this condition, linearity, inter- and intra-day precision and accuracy were within acceptable values. The developed method showed satisfactory [...] ...|$|R
500|$|Spiders and {{scorpions}} {{are members}} of one chelicerate group, the arachnids. Scorpions' chelicerae have three sections and are used in feeding. Spiders' chelicerae have two sections and terminate in fangs that are generally venomous, and fold away behind the upper sections while not in use. The upper sections generally have thick [...] "beards" [...] that filter solid lumps out of their food, as spiders can take <b>only</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>food.</b> Scorpions' pedipalps generally form large claws for capturing prey, while those of spiders are fairly small appendages whose bases also act {{as an extension of}} the mouth; in addition, those of male spiders have enlarged last sections used for sperm transfer.|$|R

25|$|Digestion {{is carried}} out {{internally}} and externally. Spiders do not have powerful chelicerae, but secrete digestive fluids into their prey {{from a series of}} ducts perforating their chelicerae. The coxal glands are excretory organs that lie in the prosoma, and open to the outside at the coxae of the walking legs. In primitive spiders, such as the Mesothelae and the Mygalomorphae, two pairs of coxal glands open onto the posterior side of the first and third coxae. They release a fluid only during feeding and {{play an important role in}} ion and water balance. Digestive fluids dissolve the prey's internal tissues. Then the spider feeds by sucking the partially digested fluids out. Other spiders with more powerfully built chelicerae masticate the entire body of their prey and leave behind only a relatively small amount of indigestible materials. Spiders consume <b>only</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>foods.</b> Many spiders will store prey temporarily. Web weaving spiders that have made a shroud of silk to quiet their envenomed prey's death struggles will generally leave them in these shrouds and then consume them at their leisure.|$|R

50|$|T. oleracea {{flies in}} early summer from April to June, (peak May-June) {{and there is a}} second {{generation}} in the late summer from August to October. Small swarms, which probably serve as pairing formations are formed in the evening hours when they fly close to the ground over meadows and fields.Eggs are laid individually into loose, moist soil. Wet meadows offer this possibility, but also gardens and cultural areas are ideal for egg-laying. As a female can lay eggs up to 1200 and often up to 400 larvae may live in a square metre, mass attacks can damage crops.The eggs are oval and slightly less than one millimeter in size. They have a dark colour. The larvae hatch after about 15 days. The larvae are brownish and the first instar is three to four millimeters long.The larvae feed on decaying vegetable matter, but also on delicate roots and can cause damage in crops like cabbage. At night, they can affect the above ground parts of the plants and eat the leaves. The larval development takes around four months and includes four moults. The larva is several centimeters long and pupates in the soil. The second generation spends the winter in the ground until late spring or early summer.The adult animals can take <b>only</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>food</b> like nectar due to its soft mouthparts.The entire life cycle of T. oleracea is up to eight months.|$|R
40|$|Aims: To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} chronic ethanol consumption and alcohol detox on macroscopic gastric lesions in rats. Methods: This is an experimental study in which 18 adult male rats (Rattus norvegicus) of the Wistar strain, with 40 days of life were divided into three randomized groups with six animals each: Control Group (CT), Detoxicated Group (DE) and Alcohol Group (AC). The AC animals {{have been subjected to}} an experimental model termed as chronic alcoholics, in which, after a period of adaptation, they received ethanol as the <b>only</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>food</b> available until completion of 13 weeks of the experiment. The DE was subjected to the same protocol as the AC, however, after six weeks of alcohol consumption, the animals were subjected to the alcohol detoxification process. At the end of the experiment, the stomach of the three groups of animals were collected in order to {{investigate the}} presence of gastric lesions. Results: The animals in the CG showed no lesions. The animals in DE exhibited a larger number of lesions in comparison to the AC (44 ± 3. 7 and 21 ± 0. 3 respectively). Macroscopic examination of the animal's stomachs indicates that the animals in the DE were those with the highest injury rate in the gastric mucosa. Conclusions: Ethanol consumed chronically or after alcohol detoxification triggered gastric lesions in AC and DE, but sharply in the group submitted to detoxification, which can characterize a possible synergism between ethanol consumption and alcohol detox post-stress in the pathogenesis of gastric ulcer...|$|R

40|$|People {{suffering}} from celiac disease are gluten intolerant and inadvertent ingestion of gluten proteins must be avoided. Several techniques {{have been proposed}} to detect/quantify gluten proteins in foodstuffs: immunochemical methods, mass tandem spectrometry and polymerase chain reaction as well as gluten sensors [1]. Recently, a potentiometric electronic tongue (ET) with lipo/polymeric membranes {{has been used to}} detect gliadins, which are gluten proteins, in foodstuffs [2]. However, the use of these techniques requires the previous extraction of gluten proteins. This step can be a possible drawback since {{it is not possible to}} guarantee that the extraction has a 100 % yield since the protein types overlap in solubility and extractability [3]. In this work, the feasibility of a hybrid multi-sensor ET, which combines repeated cross-sensitivity and ion selective sensors (Fig. 1), to discriminate gluten-free and gluten-containing <b>liquid</b> baby <b>foods</b> has been evaluated. The device was constructed using a screen- printed technique and directly applied in the <b>liquid</b> infant <b>food</b> samples. No extraction or dilution/dissolution step was required. In total, 5 “gluten-free” and 10 “gluten- containing” <b>liquid</b> baby <b>foods</b> of different flavors were purchased at local supermarkets and analyzed. The preliminary results obtained from the principal component analysis (Fig. 2) show that the signals profiles recorded by the hybrid ET possessed valuable information allowing grouping the samples in mainly two groups. In fact, linear discriminant analysis allowed the correct classification of 95 % of the samples (leave- one-out cross-validation process) being <b>only</b> one baby <b>liquid</b> <b>food</b> containing gluten misclassified as gluten-free. Although further studies are needed, the satisfactory preliminary results described here presumably demonstrate the ability of the hybrid ET to be used as a rapid and disposable practical tool for quality control of <b>liquid</b> <b>foods</b> for babies {{suffering from}} gluten intolerance...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: esophageal {{stenosis}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} serious problems in patients with peptic esophagitis. It may require esophageal resection and replacement, if no other treatment is effective. Patients and methods: we report a successfully managed case of persistent esophageal stricture. The patient was a 10 -year-old boy suffering from gastroesophageal reflux since birth. He has an esophageal peptic stricture which was treated with multiple dilatation at another hospital (about 24 times). The boy joined our Unit for gastroesophageal reflux and severe esophageal stricture confirmed with contrast X-ray. He could <b>only</b> eat <b>liquid</b> <b>foods</b> and had a growth retardation. He underwent endoscopy which shows severe esophagitis with mucosal bleeding. He also had a severe anemia, for which he underwent blood transfusion. We decided to submit the boy to Toupet laparoscopic fundoplication, endoscopic intraluminal dilatation with balloon and diathermic needle and therapy with PPI (protonic pump inhibitors) and corticostheroids. The little patient needed 7 endoscopic dilatations. Results: one month after the last dilatation he has grown, can eat all kind of foods, his blood count is normal and X-ray and endoscopy both show resolution of the stenosis and esophagitis. Conclusions: we report this case because we think that it’s a complex and interesting case. This patient was a candidate for esophageal replacement. We managed to save his native esophagus, treating gastroesophageal reflux and peptic stenosis with surgery and endoscopic dilatations, and reducing fibrosis and scarring with corticosteroid therapy. We thus think that this therapeutic procedure can be an optimal choice to contemplate before considering native esophagus replacement...|$|R

Iron, the main active ingredient reacts with oxygen to form iron hydroxide and iron oxide, thereby removing oxygen from the primary packaging. Only activated carbon has not been evaluated as such, but it meets the specifications for activated charcoal which is authorised as additive for plastic materials and articles in contact with foods. All other ingredients of the oxygen absorber formulations have been evaluated and approved for use as additives in plastic food contact materials and/or as food additives and/or <b>food</b> <b>supplements</b> or feed additives.

With older age, the prevalence of multimorbidity and pharmacotherapy increases. Aim was to explore the prevalence of <b>food</b> <b>supplement</b> use among population aged ? 50 years in Ireland and to identify factors associated with <b>food</b> <b>supplement</b> use. Design and setting Cross-sectional analysis of <b>food</b> <b>supplements</b> and medicines reported during in-home interviews by 8081 community dwelling participants aged ? 50 years included in the first wave of the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing. Results The prevalence of regular use of <b>food</b> <b>supplements</b> was 16. 6 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) 15. 5 ? 17. 7 %) and 14. 1 % (95 % CI 13. 2 ? 15. 1 %) reported taking <b>food</b> <b>supplements</b> and medicines concomitantly. Associate factors for supplement use were being female (odds ratio (OR) 2. 65; 95 % CI 2. 30 ? 3. 06), retired (OR 1. 49; 95 % CI 1. 23 ? 1. 79), a non-smoker (OR 1. 47; 1. 21 ? 1. 77), having third level or higher education (OR 1. 32; 95 % CI 1. 10 ? 1. 57) and living alone (OR 1. 37; 1. 07 ? 1. 76). Possession of private health insurance (OR 1. 61; 95 % CI 1. 23 ? 2. 19), reporting three or more chronic conditions (OR 2. 56; 95 % CI 2. 01 ? 3. 27) and polypharmacy were also associated factors (OR 2. 35; 95 % CI 1. 85 ? 2. 98). Conclusions <b>Food</b> <b>supplement</b> use is significant among the elderly in Ireland and increases with age. Its use is associated with having chronic conditions and taking (multiple) medicines, so further study is needed to assess the appropriateness and risks associated with <b>food</b> <b>supplement</b> use and to examine further the factors influencing their differential use by men and women...|$|R
