50|$|The overuse <b>of</b> <b>plastics</b> {{results in}} a dumping <b>of</b> <b>plastics</b> into our oceans {{at a rate of}} 8 million tons per year. The pilling up <b>of</b> <b>plastics</b> around the world {{continues}} to build up and now will facing issues like the Great Pacific garbage patch. Scientists now have estimated that at the rate will continue to dump plastics into our oceans, by 2050 there will have more plastic than fish in our oceans.|$|R
40|$|Plastics {{see very}} {{widespread}} use in modern society. The properties <b>of</b> many <b>plastics</b> {{can be modified}} relatively easily to fit {{a wide variety of}} applications. However, the disposal <b>of</b> waste <b>plastics</b> presents a significant environmental challenge. Recently, there has been considerable interest into tertiary recycling <b>of</b> waste <b>plastics</b> to produce liquid fuel. This project focuses on the formation of aromatic hydrocarbons during thermal pyrolysis <b>of</b> <b>plastics.</b> Several reactor configurations have been suggested for the pyrolysis <b>of</b> <b>plastics.</b> The reactor configuration used in this study consists of a stirrer tank reactor coupled with a reflux column and a condenser...|$|R

5|$|About 20 {{minutes before}} the plane landed, on its final descent, he {{secretly}} ignited a small explosive device consisting of a mix <b>of</b> <b>plastic</b> explosive powder and acid. Abdulmutallab apparently had a packet of the plastic explosive sewn to his underwear, and injected liquid acid from a syringe into the packet to cause a chemical reaction. While {{there was a small}} explosion and fire, the device failed to detonate properly. Passengers heard popping noises resembling firecrackers, smelled an odor, and saw the suspect's pants, leg and the wall of the plane on fire.|$|E
5|$|Artificial {{climbing}} {{walls are}} used to simulate boulder problems in an indoor environment, usually at climbing gyms. These walls are constructed with wooden panels, polymer cement panels, concrete shells, or precast molds of actual rock walls. Holds, usually made <b>of</b> <b>plastic,</b> are then bolted onto the wall to create problems. The walls often feature steep overhanging surfaces, forcing the climber to employ highly technical movements while supporting much of their weight with their upper body strength.|$|E
5|$|Compounds of boron, silicon, arsenic and {{antimony}} {{have been}} used as flame retardants. Boron, in the form of borax, {{has been used as a}} textile flame retardant since at least the 18th century. Silicon compounds such as silicones, silanes, silsesquioxane, silica and silicates, some of which were developed as alternatives to more toxic halogenated products, can considerably improve the flame retardancy <b>of</b> <b>plastic</b> materials.|$|E

5|$|Earth {{has evolved}} through {{geological}} and biological processes that have left {{traces of the}} original conditions. The outer surface is divided into several gradually migrating tectonic plates. The interior remains active, with a thick layer <b>of</b> <b>plastic</b> mantle and an iron-filled core that generates a magnetic field. This iron core is composed of a solid inner phase, and a fluid outer phase. Convective motion in the core generates electric currents through dynamo action, and these, in turn, generate the geomagnetic field.|$|E
5|$|Fiberglass is a fiber {{reinforced}} polymer made <b>of</b> <b>plastic</b> {{reinforced by}} glass fibers, commonly woven into a mat. The glass fibers {{used in the}} material are made of various types of glass depending upon the fiberglass use. These glasses all contain silica or silicate, with varying amounts of oxides of calcium, magnesium, and sometimes boron. The boron is present as borosilicate, borax, or boron oxide, and is added to increase {{the strength of the}} glass, or as a fluxing agent to decrease the melting temperature of silica, which is too high to be easily worked in its pure form to make glass fibers.|$|E
5|$|In 2001 RIRA members {{travelled}} to Slovakia {{to procure}} arms, and {{were caught in}} a sting operation by the British security agency MI5. The men attempted to purchase five tonnes <b>of</b> <b>plastic</b> explosives, 2,000 detonators, 500 handguns, 200 rocket-propelled-grenades, and also wire-guided missiles and sniper rifles. Three men from County Louth were arrested and extradited to the UK and subsequently imprisoned for 30 years each after pleading guilty to conspiring to cause explosions and other charges.|$|E

5|$|Ingestion <b>of</b> <b>plastic</b> flotsam {{is another}} problem, one faced by many seabirds. The amount <b>of</b> <b>plastic</b> in the seas has {{increased}} dramatically since the first record in the 1960s, coming from waste discarded by ships, offshore dumping, litter on beaches and waste washed to sea by rivers. It is impossible to digest and takes up space in the stomach or gizzard that {{should be used for}} food, or can cause an obstruction that starves the bird directly. Studies of birds in the North Pacific have shown that ingestion of plastics results in declining body weight and body condition. This plastic is sometimes regurgitated and fed to chicks; a study of Laysan albatross chicks on Midway Atoll showed large amounts of ingested plastic in naturally dead chicks compared to healthy chicks killed in accidents. While not the direct cause of death, this plastic causes physiological stress and causes the chick to feel full during feedings, reducing its food intake and the chances of survival.|$|E
5|$|Nearly 24,000 {{metric tons}} <b>of</b> <b>plastic</b> are {{dumped into the}} ocean each year. Turtles ingest {{a wide array of}} this {{floating}} debris, including bags, sheets, pellets, balloons and abandoned fishing line. Loggerheads may mistake the floating plastic for jellyfish, a common food item. The ingested plastic causes numerous health concerns, including intestinal blockage, reduced nutrient absorption and malnutrition, suffocation, ulcerations, or starvation. Ingested plastics release toxic compounds, including polychlorinated biphenyls, which may accumulate in internal tissues. Such toxins may lead to a thinning of eggshells, tissue damage, or deviation from natural behaviors.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{created for}} deer hunting, Richmond Park now has 630 red and fallow deer that roam freely within {{much of the}} park. A cull takes place each November and February to ensure numbers can be sustained. Some deer are also killed in road accidents, through ingesting litter such as small items <b>of</b> <b>plastic,</b> or by dogs; three deer were killed by dogs in 2012. Many of the deer in Richmond Park are {{infected}} with a bacterium called Borrelia burgdorferi which can be transmitted to humans through a tick bite causing Lyme disease.|$|E

5|$|The {{extraction}} of peat from the Moors {{is known to}} have taken place during Roman times, and has been carried out since the Levels were first drained. The introduction <b>of</b> <b>plastic</b> packaging in the 1950s allowed the peat to be packed without rotting, which led to the industrialisation of peat extraction during the 1960s as a major market in horticultural peat was developed. The reduction in water levels that resulted put local ecosystems at risk; peat wastage in pasture fields was occurring at rates of 1–3feet (0.3–0.8m) over 100years. Peat extraction continues today, although much reduced.|$|E
