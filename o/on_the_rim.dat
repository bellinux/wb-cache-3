The medallions were stored in the Command Service Module during flight and on missions involving a lunar landing, a small number were brought to the lunar surface aboard the Lunar Module. The flown medallions were returned to the Robbins Company after the flight to have the dates engraved and for a final polishing.

5|$|The woman's veil forms {{a diamond}} shape, {{balanced}} by the inverse flow of a light vest worn beneath her dress. She is shown at a slight angle, but her pose is centred by the interlocked broad lines of arms, décolletage and veil. The woman's head is delicately lit, leaving no strong tonal contrasts on her skin. She has a long, thin face, plucked eyebrows and eyelids, and a plucked hairline to create a fashionably high forehead. Her hair is tightly pinned back <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> of the bonnet and rests above her ear. Her high headdress and severe hairline accentuate her elongated face, giving it a sculpted appearance.|$|E

5|$|Species in {{the genus}} Cyathus have fruit bodies (peridia) that are vase-, trumpet- or urn-shaped with {{dimensions}} of 4–8mm wide by 7–18mm tall. Fruit bodies are brown to gray-brown in color, {{and covered with}} small hair-like structures on the outer surface. Some species, like C.striatus and C.setosus, have conspicuous bristles called setae <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> of the cup. The fruit body is often expanded at the base into a solid rounded mass of hyphae called an emplacement, which typically becomes tangled and entwined with small fragments of the underlying growing surface, improving its stability and helping it from being knocked over by rain. Immature fruit bodies have a whitish membrane, an epiphragm, that covers the peridium opening when young, but eventually dehisces, breaking open during maturation. Viewed with a microscope, the peridium of Cyathus species is made of three distinct layers—the endo-, meso-, and ectoperidium, referring to the inner, middle, and outer layers respectively. While {{the surface of the}} ectoperidium in Cyathus is usually hairy, the endoperidial surface is smooth, and depending on the species, may have longitudinal grooves (striations).|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{activity}} is an ignimbrite erupted 0.65 ± 0.18 mya, called the Tuzgle ignimbrite. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> of the caldera left by this eruption is a lava dome complex named the Old Complex Unit. 0.3 ± 0.1 mya ago effusive activity commenced with the Pre-platform and Platform units that were then {{followed by a}} tectonic event that dissected these units. Afterwards, the Post-platform and Young Flow Units were erupted. The youngest unit is latitic and was dated 0.1 ± (0.1-0.3) mya ago. This unit may be Holocene or PleistoceneHolocene in age. It {{is possible that the}} continuing activity of the Chorrillos fault zone is compressing the magma chamber and feeder dyke of Tuzgle, thus impeding eruptive activity. The well-preserved summit crater and youthful-looking lava flows have been assigned Holocene ages.|$|E
5|$|Altar 12 is {{carved in}} the early Maya style and archaeologists {{consider}} {{it to be an}} especially early example dating to {{the first part of the}} Late Preclassic. Because of the carvings on the upper face of the altar, it is supposed that the monument was originally erected as a vertical stela in the Late Preclassic, and was reused as a horizontal altar in the Classic. At this time 16 hieroglyphs were carved around the outer rim of the altar. The carving on the upper face of the altar represents a standing human figure portrayed in profile, facing left. The figure is flanked by two vertical series of four glyphs. A smaller profile figure is depicted facing the first figure, separated from it by one of the series of glyphs. The central figure is depicted standing upon a horizontal band representing the earth, the band is flanked by two earth monsters. Above the figure is a celestial band with part of the head of a sacred bird visible in the centre. The 16 glyphs <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> of the monument are formed by anthropomorphic figures mixed with other elements.|$|E

5|$|It was {{announced}} on 30 May 2012 that the Nobel Foundation had awarded the {{contract for the}} production of the five (Swedish) Nobel Prize medals to Svenska Medalj AB. Formerly, the Nobel Prize medals were minted by Myntverket (the Swedish Mint) from 1902 to 2010. Myntverket, Sweden's oldest company, ceased operations in 2011 after 1,017 years. In 2011, the Mint of Norway, located in Kongsberg, made the medals. The Nobel Prize medals are registered trademarks of the Nobel Foundation. Each medal features an image of Alfred Nobel in left profile on the obverse. The medals for physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, and literature have identical obverses, showing the image of Alfred Nobel and the years of his birth and death. Nobel's portrait also appears on the obverse of the Peace Prize medal and the medal for the Economics Prize, but with a slightly different design. For instance, the laureate's name is engraved <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> of the Economics medal. The image on the reverse of a medal varies according to the institution awarding the prize. The reverse sides of the medals for chemistry and physics share the same design.|$|E
5|$|Kīlauea's {{high state}} of {{activity}} {{has a major}} impact on its mountainside ecology, where plant growth is often interrupted by fresh tephra and drifting volcanic sulfur dioxide, producing acid rains particularly in a barren area south of its southwestern rift zone known as the Kaʻū Desert. Nonetheless, wildlife flourishes where left undisturbed elsewhere on the volcano and is highly endemic thanks to Kīlauea's (and the island of Hawaii's) isolation from the nearest landmass. Historically, the five volcanoes on the island were considered sacred by the Hawaiian people, and in Hawaiian mythology Kīlauea's Halemaumau Crater served as the body and home of Pele, goddess of fire, lightning, wind, and volcanoes. William Ellis, a missionary from England, gave the first modern account of Kīlauea and spent two weeks traveling along the volcano; since its foundation by Thomas Jaggar in 1912, the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, located <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> of Kīlauea caldera, has served as the principal investigative and scientific body on the volcano and the island in general. In 1916, a bill forming the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park was signed into law by President Woodrow Wilson; since then, the park has become a World Heritage Site and a major tourist destination, attracting roughly 2.6 million people annually.|$|E
25|$|In November 1891, Grove Karl Gilbert, chief {{geologist}} for the U.S. Geological Survey, {{investigated the}} crater {{and concluded that}} it {{was the result of a}} volcanic steam explosion. Gilbert had assumed that if it were an impact crater then the volume of the crater, as well as meteoritic material, should be present <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rim.</b> Gilbert also assumed a large portion of the meteorite should be buried in the crater and that this would generate a large magnetic anomaly. Gilbert's calculations showed that the volume of the crater and the debris <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> were roughly equivalent, so that the mass of the hypothetical impactor was missing, nor were there any magnetic anomalies. Gilbert argued that the meteorite fragments found <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> were coincidental. Gilbert publicized his conclusions in a series of lectures. In 1892, however, Gilbert would be among the first to propose that the Moon's craters were caused by impact rather than volcanism.|$|E
