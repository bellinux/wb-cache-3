50|$|Meat and {{vegetable}} stews, served with rice, bulgur, or bread, are {{another form of}} meat preparation in the region. Kibbeh is a pie or dumpling made with meat and cereal. The most common are made with ground meat (typically lamb) and burghul, worked together like a dough, then stuffed with minced meat that has been fried with onion, aromatics, and, sometimes, pine nuts or almonds and raisins. This can either be {{in the form of}} individual small dumplings (usually shaped like a torpedo), or in slices like a cake, baked on an <b>oven</b> <b>tray</b> with the stuffing placed between two layers of the dough. One variation is kibbeh naye, raw kibbeh, which is made by pounding raw meat and burghul together with seasoning and served with dips of lemon juice and chili sauce.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effect of drying conditions on the phenolic constituents and colour of extracts of organically grown white willow and meadowsweet for incorporation into a functional beverage with potential anti-inflammatory properties. The herbs were freeze-dried, air-dried, oven or tray-dried at 30 or 70 °C. The drying kinetics of the herbs was first determined. Both drying temperature and method had a significant effect (p ≤ 0. 05) on the drying rate, the samples tray-dried had a faster drying rate than those oven-dried. Results show that for meadowsweet and willow, freeze-drying and <b>oven</b> or <b>tray</b> drying at 30 °C had no significant effect on the phenolic constituents (e. g. total phenols, salicylates, quercetin) or the colour of the extracts in comparison to traditional air-drying. Although increasing the drying temperature to 70 °C resulted in an increase in the drying rate of both herbs it also led to the loss of some phenolic compounds. Also, the extracts from both herbs dried at 70 °C were significantly (p ≤ 0. 05) redder than the other drying methods. Therefore, tray drying these herbs at low temperatures may reduce drying time without having a significant effect on the phenolic content and colour of the extracts...|$|R
50|$|The CrustaStun is {{a device}} {{designed}} to administer a lethal electric shock to shellfish (such as lobsters, crabs, and crayfish) before cooking. This avoids boiling a live shellfish {{which may be}} able to experience pain in a way similar to vertebrates. The CrustaStun comprises a stainless-steel box approximately the size of a domestic microwave <b>oven</b> containing a <b>tray</b> with a wet sponge and an electrode. The shellfish is placed in the box and when the lid is closed, the wet sponge conducts the current which electrocutes the animal with a 110 volt, 2-5 amp charge. It is reported the CrustaStun renders the shellfish unconscious in 0.3 seconds and kills the animal in 5 to 10 seconds, compared to 3 minutes to kill a lobster by boiling or 4.5 minutes for a crab.|$|R
40|$|A new drying model {{originally}} derived for thin-wood veneer {{and successfully}} {{applied to the}} control of a veneer Jet Dryer may be extended for use in controlling the drying of such diverse products as textiles, dog food, pulp and paper, sawdust, lumber, fiberboard, gypsum board, crumb rubber, etc. In addition, such dryer types as Rotary Drum, Suspension, Flash, Through, Spray, <b>Oven,</b> <b>Tray,</b> Lime Kilns, etc., should be amenable to control utilizing this model. Moreover, it should apply to most thin slabs and webs utilizing either a hot circulating, gaseous medium (hot air) or a hot surface {{in direct contact with}} the product such as a paper machine steam drum. Control systems utilizing this new concept enable control of product moisture content prior to exiting the dryer as opposed to after-the-fact information presently utilized as a means of control...|$|E
40|$|Nata de coco or {{bacterial}} cellulose produced by Acetobacter xylinum {{is a unique}} type of biocellulose. It contains more than 90 % of water. Dried nata was preferred compared to wet form since {{it is more convenient}} and portable with stable properties. Therefore, drying process is necessary in order to produce dried nata de coco. Drying method is a key factor that influenced the properties of dried nata de coco produced. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effect of different drying methods on morphology, crystallinity, swelling ability and tensile strength of dried nata de coco. Nata de coco samples were dried using three physical drying methods such as <b>oven,</b> <b>tray</b> dryer or freeze dryer until it achieved 3 - 5 % moisture content. Obviously, the three drying techniques produced web-like structured nata de coco and quite similar crystallinity which was in range between 87 and 89 %. Freeze dried sample showed the largest swelling capacity and tensile strength which was found to be 148 MPa. Different drying method gave different properties of nata de coco. Therefore, the present work proposed the most suitable drying method can be utilized based on the properties of end product needed...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} work, drying of {{chestnut}} (Castanea sativa Mill.) fruits was performed at different air temperatures in three equipment – convection <b>oven,</b> parallel flow <b>tray</b> dryer and fluidised bed dryer, at temperatures between 40 and 100 ºC. Newton, diffusion approach and two-term models {{were found to}} be adequate in describing the moisture ratio and drying rates along time. For the same temperature, the dehydration processes that involved higher air velocities were > 1. 6 times faster. On the other hand, for the same equipment the highest temperature (100 ºC) induced a drying rate ten times faster than the lowest temperature (40 ºC), reducing drying time. Apparent diffusivity ranged between 7. 03 × 10 – 11 m 2 s– 1 (40 ºC, convection oven) and 1. 06 × 10 – 9 m 2 s– 1 (100 ºC, fluidised bed dryer). In convection oven experiments, the diffusivity in function of temperature was well described by an Arrhenius type function, with an activation energy of 4. 08 × 104 J mol– 1...|$|R
5000|$|According to the Goulbourn Township Historical Society, the {{original}} bakery {{started in the}} late 1800s when Sam Wright came from Kemptville and opened a bakery business on Strachan Street. The article, which recounts the History of the Richmond Bakery was originally published in Richmond 150 a book published in 1968 for the 150th anniversary of the Village of Richmond {{and goes on to}} say that {{the original}} bakery was sold in 1900 to Sam Wright, who operated the business until 1926. In 1930, Harold Brown rented a bakeshop and opened the Richmond Bakery on McBean Street which had a wood-fired brick oven, a few utensils and a kerosene lamp for lighting because there was no electricity. All the water was hand pumped from a well and carried to the bakery. Bread sold for 3 cents a loaf to retailers, who in turn sold it for 5 cents and the baker usually worked 16 hours per day. To deliver the bread, Mr. Brown borrowed horses from the local farmers and fed the horses in return. Drivers had to feed the horses at 4 a.m. and usually didn’t finish deliveries until 7 p.m. covering 20-25 miles per day. After being discharged from the RCAF in 1945, Mr. Brown opened another bakery in Richmond on McBean Street. Although it had electricity and trucks to do the deliveries, water still had to be pumped by hand and carried to the bakery. In 1952, Mr. Brown moved the Richmond Bakery to the corner of McBean and Perth Streets and new equipment was purchased including, gas and oil <b>ovens,</b> revolving <b>trays</b> and a bread steamer. Water was finally pumped into the bakery with an electric pump. At the new location, Mr. Brown added pastries which became one of the attractions of the bakers. On Sundays, Ottawa residents would drive to Richmond to purchase the sweet treats. The Bakery’s motto has always been, “We bake everything we sell and we sell everything we bake.” ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In {{this study}} the {{feasibility}} of joining prilling and microwave (MW) assisted treatments as combined technique to produce controlled release alginate beads was tested. Beads were produced by prilling (laminar jet break-up) using different polymer concentrations and loaded with ketoprofen, a slightly soluble non-steroidal anti-inflammatory BCS class II drug characterized by low melting point. MW assisted treatments applied using different irradiating conditions were performed as drying/curing step. The effect of formulation conditions and process variables on drying kinetics, particle micromeritics, shape, surface and inner characteristics of the matrix as well as drug loading and drug release behaviour was studied (USP pH change method). The properties of MW dried particles were compared to those dehydrated by convective methods (room conditions and <b>tray</b> <b>oven</b> 105 ◦C). Results showed that MW dried ketoprofen loaded beads were obtained in a very narrow dimensional range retaining shape and size distribution of the hydrates particles. Compared to the traditional drying methods, MW treatments were able to strongly increase drying rate of the hydrated beads achieving faster and controllable dehydration kinetics. Moreover, different regimes of irradiation affected structural properties of the particles such as matrix porosity {{as well as the}} solid state of the loaded drug. DSC, X-ray and FTIR analyses indicated complex chemical interactions between the drug and polymer matrix induced by MW, related with the regime of irradiation, that contributes to the differences in release profiles. In fact, MW treatments under different time and irradiating regimes are able to modulate drug release from alginate beads; high levels of irradiation led to beads suitable for immediate release oral dosage forms whereas the lowest regime of irradiation led to beads that achieved a prolonged/sustained release of the drug till 8 h in simulated intestinal medium. This study showed that prilling in combination with microwave treatments is a useful and simple tandem technique to prepare dextran-based dried beads...|$|R
