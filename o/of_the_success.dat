5|$|At {{least a dozen}} {{recordings}} {{were issued}} in the wake <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>success</b> of the Nonesuch recording, and the work enjoyed significant exposure {{in a number of}} artistic media worldwide. The work was repeatedly used by filmmakers in the 1990s and onwards to elicit a sense of pathos or sorrow, including as an accompaniment to a plane crash in Peter Weir's Fearless (1993), and in the soundtrack to Julian Schnabel's Basquiat (1996). An art gallery in Santa Fe, New Mexico opened an exhibit in 1995 dedicated entirely to visual art inspired by the piece.|$|E
5|$|Between 80 and 90 {{percent of}} the {{residents}} of New Orleans were evacuated before the hurricane struck, testifying to some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>success</b> of the evacuation measures. Despite this, many remained in the city, mainly those who did not have access to personal vehicles or who were isolated from the dissemination of news from the local governments. The Louisiana Superdome was used to house and support some of those who were unable to evacuate. Television shots frequently focused on the Superdome {{as a symbol of the}} flooding occurring in New Orleans.|$|E
5|$|By the Late Middle Ages (approx 1300-1550), large battles {{became more}} common, {{probably}} because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>success</b> of infantry tactics {{and changes in}} weaponry. However, because such tactics left the knight unmounted, {{the role of the}} war horse also changed. By the 17th century, the medieval charger had become a thing of the past, replaced by lighter, unarmoured horses.|$|E

5|$|In 1978 Burnet {{decided to}} officially retire; in {{retirement}} he wrote two books. During this time, {{he missed his}} laboratory work, and he was constrained to social events and theorising.

Hadl's analysis was that Donkey Kongs storyline was based on that of King Kong and was thus an infringement of Universal's rights to that film's characters and scenario.|$|E

5|$|Smart's Hymns {{are one of}} {{the first}} works of hymns {{dedicated}} to children, and they are intended to teach Christian virtues. Unlike some of the other works produced by Smart after his release from a mental asylum, such as A Song to David or Hymns and Spiritual Songs, this work was a success and went into many immediate editions. Part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>success</b> of this work lies in the simplicity and accessibility of the text.

The rest did not receive close attention until 1943, when the U-boats had been contained and {{a certain degree of}} ascendancy achieved.|$|E
5|$|Aalborg Airport, officially {{opened in}} 1938 because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>success</b> of the cement industry, {{had in fact}} {{operated}} flights to Copenhagen since 1936.

On 13 August 1940, a dozen Bristol Blenheim bombers of No. 82 Squadron RAF were launched against the Luftwaffe airfield during one of the most disastrous Royal Air Force raids of the war. One turned back because of fuel problems, but all of the remaining 11 were shot down by enemy fighters and/or flak batteries within 20 minutes.
