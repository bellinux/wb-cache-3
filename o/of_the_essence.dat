The four-year {{flagship programme}} is mainly made up of two segments, namely 'Broad-Base Curriculum' and 'Peaks of Excellence', which include cultural intelligence and life education to groom students to be world-ready.|$|E

5|$|The overall Persian {{strategy}} for the invasion of 480 BC was to overwhelm the Greeks with a massive invasion force, and complete the conquest of Greece in a single campaigning season. Conversely, the Greeks sought {{to make the best}} use of their numbers by defending restricted locations and to keep the Persians in the field for as long as possible. Xerxes had obviously not anticipated such resistance, or he would have arrived earlier in the campaigning season (and not waited 4 days at Thermopylae for the Greeks to disperse). Time was now <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>essence</b> for the Persians – the huge invasion force could not be reasonably supported indefinitely, nor probably did Xerxes wish to be at the fringe of his empire for so long. Thermopylae had shown that a frontal assault against a well defended Greek position was useless; with the Allies now dug in across the narrow Isthmus, there was little chance of conquering the rest of Greece by land. However, as equally demonstrated by Thermopylae, if the Greeks could be outflanked, their smaller numbers of troops could be destroyed. Such an outflanking of the Isthmus required the use of the Persian navy, and thus the destruction of the Allied navy. Therefore, if Xerxes could destroy the Allied navy, he would be in a strong position to force a Greek surrender; this seemed the only hope of concluding the campaign in that season. Conversely by avoiding destruction, or as Themistocles hoped, by crippling the Persian fleet, the Greeks could effectively thwart the invasion.|$|E

25|$|There is {{a general}} {{agreement}} among theologians {{that it would be}} a mistake to conceive <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>essence</b> of God existing by itself and independently of the attributes or of the attributes being an additional characteristic of the Divine Being.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} <b>the</b> Ethics <b>of</b> Baruch Spinoza {{through three}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most important concepts presented in <b>the</b> work: <b>essence,</b> knowledge, and blessedness. By thoroughly exploring and reexamining these concepts {{and the role}} they play in Spinoza’s ethical project, {{it becomes clear that}} it is knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>essences</b> <b>of</b> singular things that is key to <b>the</b> life <b>of</b> blessedness. This exploration is approached from a perspective that intends to unify the metaphysical, epistemological and moral projects presented in the Ethics. This paper will argue that knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>essences</b> <b>of</b> singular things involves <b>the</b> relations <b>of</b> finite modes, both insofar as they actually exist and insofar as they exist sub specie aeternitatis. Therefore, it is not merely reason and adequate knowledge of eternity that lead the philosopher to blessedness, but knowledge of finite modes and their relations to one another that constitutes knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> third kind, viz. scientia intuitiva, <b>the</b> highest good <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mind...|$|R

In Eastern Orthodox theology, God's uncreatedness or being or essence in Greek is called ousia. Jesus Christ is the Son (God Man) of the uncreated Father (God).
