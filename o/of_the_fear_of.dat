5|$|Plague doctors traversed {{the streets}} {{diagnosing}} victims, {{although many of}} them had no formal medical training. Several public health efforts were attempted. Physicians were hired by city officials and burial details were carefully organized, but panic spread through the city and, out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> contagion, people were hastily buried in overcrowded pits. The means of transmission of the disease were not known but thinking they might be linked to the animals, the City Corporation ordered a cull of dogs and cats. This decision may have affected the length of the epidemic since those animals could have helped keep in check the rat population carrying the fleas which transmitted the disease. Thinking bad air was involved in transmission, the authorities ordered giant bonfires to be burned in the streets and house fires to be kept burning night and day, in hopes that the air would be cleansed. Tobacco was thought to be a prophylactic and it was later said that no London tobacconist had died from the plague during the epidemic.|$|E
5|$|The Iroquois {{signed the}} Fort Stanwix Treaty of 1768, ceding the lands {{south of the}} Ohio to the British. European {{expansion}} into the upper Ohio valley increased. An estimated 4,000 to 5,000 families settled in western Pennsylvania between 1768 and 1770. Of these settlers, about a third were English, a third were Scotch-Irish, and the rest were Welsh, German and others. These groups tended to settle together in small farming communities, but often their households were not within hailing distance. The life of a settler family was one of relentless hard work: clearing the forest, stumping the fields, building cabins and barns, planting, weeding, and harvesting. In addition, almost everything was manufactured by hand, including furniture, tools, candles, buttons, and needles. Settlers {{had to deal with}} harsh winters, and with snakes, black bears, mountain lions, and timber wolves. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> raids by Native Americans, the settlers often built their cabins near, or even on top of, springs, to ensure access to water. They also built blockhouses, where neighbors would rally during conflicts.|$|E

Among other reasons, but also because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> the creation of a bigger and stronger Orthodox Serbia, that could eventually became a Russian allied, the decision of making an ethnically mixed South Slav state, where other nationalities would balance the Serb hegemony, was made.|$|E

Open to international capital markets, emergent countries are condemned to flexible exchange rates. However, a high inflation, a dollar debt (the original sin) and a fragile banking structure condemn them to the management.

The protests brought debates and discussions to our homes." [...] She also said that since the rape and protests the media is now providing coverage of sexual violence. However, she saw [...] "absolutely no change in the rape culture and related brutality. The streets are not safe. Teasing [...] and catcalling or worse are to be found everywhere. Sexual harassment in public places as well as inside the home is still rampant." [...] She added, [...] "I do acknowledge, however, that a year is too less to undo what patriarchy has done over centuries. It is too embedded in our homes, our institutions and in our laws.

He summarized that at its core, The Expanse was all about people responding to <b>fear</b> - <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other, <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new, <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> inequality, <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> death.|$|R

500|$|... {{wrote the}} {{developing}} romance between Daniel and Vala in [...] "Unending" [...] {{by having them}} have sex without a confrontation. Claudia Black and Michael Shanks protested against this intended story, as Shanks felt that [...] "here's always been this underlining, keeping [...] at arms length because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> getting too close." [...] Cooper rewrote the scene to show Vala's vulnerability to Daniel, and have Daniel share his true feelings of a relationship. The actors decided to play the confrontation scene as genuinely as possible, with both characters being neither completely in-character nor totally out-of-character. The scene was rehearsed a lot and was filmed {{over the course of}} six hours. Cooper was nevertheless concerned that Daniel appeared too edgy and mean, although his feelings were motivated by the two years of torment with Vala, and losing his wife nearly ten years before. Daniel's line, [...] "You better not be messing with me", was only said in one take by Michael Shanks. Since Cooper prefers to follow up on such emotional scenes with a laugh, the immediate next scene shows Vala coming out of Daniel's room, where she encounters a disbelieving Mitchell jogging by. In Cooper's mind, Daniel held a crying Vala in another scene because she had gotten pregnant and had lost the baby. To contrast the obvious relationship between Daniel and Vala, Amanda Tapping and Christopher Judge subtly played their scenes as if their characters also had a romantic relationship.|$|E
500|$|Claudia Black and Michael Shanks (Daniel Jackson) linked their characters' early {{relationship}} to a Spencer Tracy/Katharine Hepburn dynamic of [...] "not {{so much of}} tension, but rather constant antagonism". Despite the concern in early season 9 that their relationship would stagnate and dumb down their characters, Shanks felt Vala brought out a side of Daniel {{that he had not}} had the chance to play before, and Black advocated the slow revelation of Vala's layers of denial. The writers continued to develop the friendship between Vala and Daniel throughout season 10, aiming not to lose their sexual chemistry. Michael Shanks stated that by [...] "Memento Mori", [...] "Daniel legitimately cares about Vala and has seen some sort of redemption in her and wants that process to continue." [...] From Black's point of view, Daniel offers [...] "an interesting window" [...] into [...] "Vala's external façade to be playful with people". He helps Vala grow as a person and forces her to [...] "develop coping mechanisms that allow her to be more adult and learn that it's OK to be honest and talk how you feel." [...] Asked about a possible romance between Vala and Daniel before the filming of the series finale, Black predicted that a consummation of the relationship would end badly in terms of both story and on-screen chemistry. When producer Robert C. Cooper presented his preliminary script for the series finale, [...] "Unending", both Black and Shanks protested his intended story of having Vala and Daniel sleep together without a confrontation. Shanks felt that [...] "here's always been this underlining, keeping [...] at arms length because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> getting too close." [...] After Cooper rewrote the scene to increase Vala's vulnerability to Daniel, and have Daniel truthfully explain his feelings of a relationship, the actors decided to play the confrontation scene as genuinely as possible, with both characters being neither completely in-character nor totally out-of-character.|$|E
