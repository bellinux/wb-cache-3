40|$|The rate of electric-field-driven {{transport}} across ion-selective membranes can {{exceed the}} limit predicted by Nernst (the limiting current), and encouraging this “overlimiting” phenomenon can improve efficiency in many electrochemical systems. <b>Overlimiting</b> behavior {{is the result}} of electroconvectively induced vortex formation near membrane surfaces, a conclusion supported so far by two-dimensional (2 D) theory and numerical simulation, as well as experiments. In this paper we show that the third dimension plays a critical role in <b>overlimiting</b> behavior. In particular, the vortex pattern in shear flow through wider channels is helical rather than planar, a surprising result first observed in three-dimensional (3 D) simulation and then verified experimentally. We present a complete experimental and numerical characterization of a device exhibiting this recently discovered 3 D electrokinetic instability, and show that the number of parallel helical vortices is a jump-discontinuous function of width, as is the <b>overlimiting</b> current and <b>overlimiting</b> conductance. In addition, we show that <b>overlimiting</b> occurs at lower fields in wider channels, because the associated helical vortices are more readily triggered than the planar vortices associated with narrow channels (effective 2 D systems). These unexpected width dependencies arise in realistic electrochemical desalination systems, and have important ramifications for design optimization. United States.

In contrast to other membrane processes such as ultrafiltration, in electrodialysis, current transport above the limiting current is possible. In this work, {{the origin of the}} <b>overlimiting</b> current at cation-exchange polymers is investigated. We show that, under certain experimental conditions, electroconvection is the origin of the <b>overlimiting</b> conductance. The theory concerning electroconvection predicts a shortening of the plateau length of membranes with increased conductive or geometrical heterogeneity. We investigate the influence of these two parameters and show that the creation of line undulations on the membrane surface normal to the flow direction, having distances in the range of approximately 50 − 200 % of the boundary-layer thickness, lead to an earlier onset of the <b>overlimiting</b> current. The plateau length of the undulated membranes is reduced by up to 60 % compared to that of a flat membrane.

40|$|These are {{informal}} {{notes about}} how to set the class parameters for Class-Based Queueing (CBQ) [FJ 95]. Some of the guidelines, such as those for setting maxidle and offtime, apply {{to any of the}} link-sharing algorithms discussed in [FJ 95]. Others are only necessary for Ancestor-Only link-sharing. The current distribution of the CBQ code implements Ancestor-Only link-sharing; this should be updated to Top-Level Link-Sharing shortly. As explained in [FJ 95], Ancestor-Only link-sharing is somewhat sensitive to the exact setting of the class parameters. Section 2 underscores that fact. 1 An overview of the guidelines In CBQ, each class has variables idle and avgidle, parameter maxidle used in computing the limit status for the class, and parameter offtime used in determining how long to restrict throughput for <b>overlimit</b> classes. Definition: idle. The variable idle is the difference between the desired time and the measured actual time between the most recent packet transmissions for the last two packets sent from this class. When the connection is sending perfectly at its alloted rate  , then idle is zero. When the connection is sending more that its allocated bandwidth, then idle is negative. Definition: avgidle. The variable avgidle is the average of idle, and is computed using a exponential weighted moving average (EWMA). When avgidle is zero or lower, then the class is <b>overlimit</b> (the class has been exceeding its allocated bandwidth in a recent short time interval). Definition: maxidle. The parameter maxidle gives an upper bound for avgidle. Thus maxidle limits the `credit ' given to a class that has recently been under its allocation. Definition: offtime. The parameter offtime gives the time interval that a <b>overlimit</b> class must wait before sending another packet. This parameter determines th...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{experiments}} revealed nonlinear current–voltage {{characteristics in}} a micro–nanochannel integrated system. The current characteristics {{were found to}} deviate from the classical−diffusion limited current transport theory, which predicts a saturation of the current density at higher applied voltages with an infinite differential resistance. Using a detailed 2 −D nonlinear, nonideal ion–selective model, we capture and explain all the three regions observed in the experiments, by analyzing {{the behavior of the}} ionic concentration, near the depletion junction of the micro–nanochannel. Figure 7. 6 (a) shows the normalized nonlinear current–voltage characteristics in a highly ion–selective nanochannel integrated with a microchannel using our physical model. At low electric fields (region I in Figure 7. 6 (a)), the current increases linearly with the applied voltage, following the Ohm’s law. However, beyond the first critical voltage, the current deviates from the Ohmic behavior, but continues to increase with a slope smaller than that of the Ohmic region. This region (II) {{is often referred to as}} the limiting resistance region (LRR). Finally, beyond a second critical voltage, the slope of the current increases in comparison to the limiting regime and this region is typically referred to as the <b>overlimiting</b> current region (III). We attribute the limiting resistance region to the predominant propagation of induced space charges towards the microchannel. The <b>overlimiting</b> current characteristics is attributed to the redistribution of the space charges near the micro/nanochannel interface resulting in an anomalous enhancement in the ionic concentration of the electrolyte (predominantly anion concentration) in the induced space charge region (see Figure 7. 6 (b)). ...|$|R
