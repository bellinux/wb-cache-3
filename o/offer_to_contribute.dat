25|$|In one of {{the many}} Manhattan {{properties}} that Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney and her husband owned, Gertrude Whitney established the Whitney Studio Club at 8 West 8th Street in 1914, as a facility where young artists could exhibit their works. By the 1930s it had evolved into her greatest legacy, the Whitney Museum of American Art, on the site of today's New York Studio School of Drawing, Painting and Sculpture. The Whitney was founded in 1931, as an answer to the Museum of Modern Art, founded 1928, and its collection of mostly European modernism and its neglect of American Art. Gertrude Whitney decided to put the time and money into the museum after the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art turned down her <b>offer</b> <b>to</b> <b>contribute</b> her twenty-five-year collection of modern art works. In 1936, the renowned Abstract Expressionist artist and teacher Hans Hofmann moved his art school from E. 57th Street to 52 West 9th Street. In 1938, Hofmann moved again to a more permanent home at 52 West 8th Street. The school remained active until 1958 when Hofmann retired from teaching.|$|E
25|$|The {{second stage}} of Meyer's cricket career began after his return to England to set up Millfield School in Somerset. From the 1936 season, he {{appeared}} in Somerset matches, almost always those {{in the second half}} of the season when the school term had ended and, with rare exceptions, those played at home. In these games, he played as an all-rounder, his batting having improved significantly since his Cambridge days. Against Lancashire at Taunton in the last match of the 1936 season, he rescued Somerset from likely defeat with his maiden century, an undefeated 202, scored in 225 minutes. There is no doubt of the innings' merit– Somerset were still 48 behind with half their second innings wickets gone– but there is an oft-repeated story that the double century was obtained by an <b>offer</b> <b>to</b> <b>contribute</b> to the Lancashire beneficiary's fund. And he got a second century the following year against Sussex. As a bowler, he managed at least one five-wicket innings haul in each of the four seasons running up to the Second World War, though his bowling was an increasingly idiosyncratic mixture of spin and swing. In the war, he served in the Royal Air Force.|$|E

The clinical and scientific section of the Canadian Diabetes Association has accepted the report in principle, anticipating that it may need to be modified in the light of future clinical experience and research findings.

40|$|Introduction The risk {{management}} project of The University Hospital “A. Gemelli” aims {{to define the}} necessary procedures to manage clinical risk, by identifying the structures involved within this process, so {{that all of the}} personnel can contribute to a measurable improvement in the safety of both patients and staff. Methods The Risk Management Program is comprised of 5 long-term phases: Phase 1 - Strategy Definition and Communication: a clear and shared Risk Management Strategy is indispensable to guarantee a coordinated action plan, in order to focus all of the interventions towards the achievement of common and measurable results. Phase 2 - Risk Management System Governance: all of the organisational structures have been activated in order to effectively manage the Risk Management System. The system has been introduced to interact within all areas of the hospital and to transfer information. Phase 3 - Promotion within the Organisation: this phase fosters the aims of the project within the whole organisation, by stressing the concept of “learning from errors”. This is crucial if organisational and healthcare workers are to understand the true aims of risk prevention and protection and <b>offer</b> <b>to</b> <b>contribute</b> to the process. Phase 4 - Risk Assessment: a data survey system was created and institutionalized. This phase begins with an analysis of the information flow, in order to estimate the probabilities that certain risks occur, and ends with defining the interventions to undertake. Risk assessment makes it possible to forecast the consequences of certain risks and thus prioritise those for prevention. Phase 5 - Risk Management: this consists of planning and implementing all of the actions necessary to prevent risks, protect and finance (in terms of prevention) A. Gemelli University Hospital. Results The results achieved are remarkable especially when one considers the organisation of a complex clinical {{risk management}} system within a large university hospital. An information flow that examines and identifies risks from surveying the data has been created. Preventative activities have been planned in the laboratories, transfusion and pharmacotherapy sectors as outlined in the risk map, together with clinical audit activities. Furthermore, all of these issues have been highlighted across all sectors with the creation of an accredited ECM training program as well as the implementation of an anonymous survey. These initiatives have not only increased the interest in Risk Management issues, but have also fostered the integration of different groups and their working methods. Conclusions Introducing risk management processes to A. Gemelli University Hospital represents a step from the promotion and dissemination phase to that of a formal organic risk management system in medicine. This initiative, involving the participation of all personnel, has produced a measurable improvement in safety of both patients and staff...|$|E
