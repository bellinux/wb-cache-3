40|$|The {{detection}} of point and other simple mutations in DNA {{is important for}} cancer research and diagnosis and other biological studies. Capillary electrophoresis has been successfully used for separating DNA fragments. However, a low-viscosity polymer sieving buffer for DNA separation with <b>on-line</b> <b>coating</b> has never been reported. In this paper, a new method using capillary electrophoresis with <b>on-line</b> <b>coating</b> and laser-induced fluorescence detection (CE-LIF) for screening for point or simple DNA mutations has been demonstrated. The method uses an on-line dynamic coating technique that increases capillary lifetime and analysis reproducibility, and employs a low-viscosity polymer solution, which allows the user to rinse the capillary rapidly and refill with polymer solution easily. Experiments proved that the additives in the separation buffer for on-line capillary coating do not affect the separation efficiency of the running buffer, and do {{not interfere with the}} formation of hydrogen-bonded network between boric acid, mannitol and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose polymers. The stability of the dynamically coated capillary was quantitatively studied; the capillary lifetime was increased 6 - to 7 -fold compared with that of permanently coated CE columns. Standard DNA fragments containing mutations, with sizes of 209, 219, and 338 bps, were successfully separated and detected with this system, after the mutated DNA fragments were cleaved by CEL-I endonuclease. The technique is very sensitive for the size-separation of low-range, middle-range, and high-range DNA fragments. Results were compared with the HPLC methods developed by Transgenomic, Inc. and were in good agreement. The method should be applicable to mutation detection for all relevant biological and clinical studies. The factors influencing separations and the stability of dynamic capillary coatings are also discussed in the paper...|$|E
40|$|A {{process for}} coating glass {{substrates}} {{with a hard}} polymer layer to increase the fracture resistance, in which the polymer layer is formed by polymerisation of a gaseous hydrocarbon monomer (I) in a corona discharge. Pref. (I) is a hydrocarbon monomer with double or triple C/C bonds, pref. acetylene. The polymer layer obtd. is 1 - 10 microns thick. This layer may be coated with an oxide layer, pref. with a thickness of 0. 1 - 5 microns, obtd. {{by the action of}} a corona discharge or a flame on a gaseous organometallic or organometalloid monomer (II) in presence of oxygen. Pref. (II) is an organo-Si monomer, esp. pref. Me 4 Si or Me 3 Si-O-SiMe 3. Pref. substrates are hollow glass prods., which are <b>coated</b> <b>on-line</b> after their prodn [...] The corona discharge is operated at a frequency of 35 - 50 kHz. USE - For coating glass to prevent fracture, esp. e. g. to prevent glass bottles cracking during the cooling phase in prodn. ADVANTAGE - A simple polymer coating process which avoids the use of organic or inor ganic solvents...|$|R
40|$|The creping {{process and}} the {{conditions}} on the Yankee cylinder are the key factors in the production process. They need to be kept under good control {{in order to maintain}} a high and uniform quality. A natural coating always develops {{on the surface of the}} Yankee cylinder due to evaporation from dissolved and dispersed substances and to fiber fragments that remain on the surface after creping. Nevertheless, coating chemicals are sprayed onto the Yankee surface in order to modify the adhesion between the paper and the dryer cylinder. To be able to control the process, <b>on-line</b> measurements of <b>coating</b> thickness as well as of the crepe structure of the tissue paper produced would be very valuable. In the work described in this thesis, the coating layer was analyzed chemically and morphologically to provide information about the coating layer before starting any on-line measurements. The chemicals added and the constituents of the pulps are known to the paper producers, but what is left on the cylinder and whether there are different layers of coating still remain to be investigated. The chemical analysis indicated that the adhesive content was higher in an inner layer of the coating than in the outer layer. The relative amount of polyamide-amine resin calculated on the basis of the nominal nitrogen content in the resin was low indicating that the coating consisted of a significant amount of carbohydrates or other substances. The coating layer could not be considered transparent. It was observed that the coating was thick and appeared patch-wise and that it contained fiber fragments. Measurements on a laboratory scale, to further be applied on-line on the tissue machine, have been investigated and evaluated in this study. The thickness of the coating layer on a laboratory dryer has been measured. The method was based on fluorescence with an optical brightener added to the coating chemicals sprayed on the Yankee dryer. With a UV-LED (Ultra Violet - Light Emitting Diode) the coating layer was exposed to UV-light and the intensity of the light emitted by the optical brightener in the layer was measured. The intensity in the trials with different thickness of the coating and no coating was scattered and no trend could be seen between the different trial points. Attempts were made to measure the wavelength of the tissue paper produced with an optical fiber perpendicular to and at an angle to the paper surface. The paper was travelling in a slow speed while the measurements were made. The collected signal to noise ratio was low and it was not possible to detect any representative characteristic wavelength of the tissue...|$|R
