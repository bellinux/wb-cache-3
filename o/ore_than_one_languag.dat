40|$|Multiple {{regression}} analysis is a statistical technique which allows to predict a dependent variable from m <b>ore</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> independent variable {{and also to}} determine influential independent variables. Using experimental data, in this study the multiple {{regression analysis}} is applied to predict the room mean velocity and determine the most influencing parameters on the velocity. More than 120 experiments for four different heat source locations were carried out in a test chamber {{with a high level}} wall mounted air supply terminal at air change rates 3 - 6 ach. The influence of the environmental parameters such as supply air momentum, room heat load, Archimedes number and local temperature ratio, were examined by two methods: a simple regression analysis incorporated into scatter matrix plots and multiple stepwise regression analysis. It is concluded that, when a heat source is located along the jet centre line, the supply momentum mainly influences the room mean velocity regardless of the plume strength. However, when the heat source is located outside the jet region, the local temperature ratio (the inverse of the local heat removal effectiveness) is a major influencing parameter...|$|R

We estimate the impact of parent death on primary school partici-pation using an unusual fi ve-year panel data set of over 20, 000 Kenyan children. There is a substantial decrease in school participation following a parent death and a smaller drop before the death (presum-ably due to pre-death morbidity). Estimated impacts are smaller in specifi cations without individual fi xed effects, suggesting that estimates based on cross-sectional data are biased toward zero. Effects are largest for children whose mothers died and, in a novel fi nding, for those with low baseline aca-demic performance. <b>ore</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> in nine children under age 18 in sub-Saharan Africa have lost a parent, and the HIV/AIDS pandemic is the leading cause (UNAIDS, UNICEF, and USAID 2004). 1 HIV/AIDS deaths today could have major long-term effects on economic development by affecting the human capital accumulation of the next generation.

40|$|Rather than {{conveying}} morphosyntactic meaning, conjugation classes {{determine how}} such properties are expressed. Conjugation classes are therefore ‘ornamental’ properties {{of language and}} clearly not essential to communication. Such purely formal distinctions tend to be absent from contact varieties largely because adults have a natural tendency to bypass linguistic features that are perceived as semantically unnecessary (e. g., Seuren and Wekker 1986, McWhorter 2001). The goal of this paper, however, will be to show that language contact does not necessarily lead {{to a loss of}} meaningless forms. Building on recent work by Luís (2008, forthcoming), we provide empirical evidence which shows that Romance conjugation classes respond in different ways to language contact. In particular, we show that conjugation classes may undergo different types of morphological change, such as lexicalization, levelling, retention and extension. Our evidence will be drawn from contact varieties which have derived from the contact between one Romance language (either Portuguese or Spanish) and <b>one</b> (or more <b>than</b> <b>one)</b> non-Romance <b>languag...</b>|$|R

Approximately 5000 MT of lead are required each year for this process, however this process recovers 25% more lead from the starting <b>ores</b> <b>than</b> other processes.|$|R
