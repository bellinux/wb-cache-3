However, the tilted over engine and specially designed gearbox also produced many reliability problems including <b>oil</b> <b>surge</b> and a lack of throttle response that only compounded the already poor response of the BMW turbo (four cylinder turbos generally suffered more 'turbo lag' as a result of only using a single turbocharger, while V6 and V8 engines used twin turbos and suffered less lag). This saw the Brabhams off the pace on the slower circuits such as Monaco (where de Angelis qualified 20th and last for his final race, though amazingly Patrese managed to qualify 6th), Detroit, and the then new circuits of Jerez and the Hungaroring where acceleration counted for more than outright speed. The team scored just two points all season, both by driver Riccardo Patrese with sixth placings in San Marino and Detroit. It should be noted that, as in 1985, the Brabham's performance was severely hampered by inconsistent Pirelli race tyres.|$|E

50|$|According to Holden Dealer Team boss Harry Firth, Holden {{chose to}} have the V8 engine in the SL/R 5000 {{developed}} by Repco on their dyno which led to massive <b>oil</b> <b>surge</b> problems on the race track and {{had a number of}} teams, including the HDT, suffer numerous engine failures in both testing and races in 1974.

5000|$|Transmission {{problems}} were tackled {{by adding a}} further mounting-point (making five) for the whole engine and transmission assembly {{at the back of}} the gearbox where it was supported by an extra chassis cross-member.

Firth believed that developing the engine on the dyno and not on the race track saw continual problems for the engine such as <b>oil</b> <b>surge</b> - especially in touring car racing. He also claimed to have already cured the oil problems while developing the still-born Holden LJ Torana GTR XU-1 V8 in 1972 and that Holden ignored his warnings about the Repco engine.|$|E

50|$|The 1986 Brabham-BMW, the BT55, was {{the brainchild}} of long time Brabham {{designer}} Gordon Murray. The BT55 was a lowline car with a reduced frontal area, the idea being to have a cleaner airflow over the car to create more downforce, {{while at the same time}} reducing the car's drag. The chassis proved effective, unlike the l4 BMW turbo that had to be tilted to an angle of 72°. This caused severe <b>oil</b> <b>surge</b> and an even greater lack of throttle response than the BMW had become famous for. Although the team worked hard to overcome these problems, it was clear from early in the season that Brabham had fallen behind the leading pack.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} the 1974 season Brock {{left the}} HDT team, whilst Colin Bond {{continued}} on as the team's sole circuit racing driver. The L34 option was homologated for racing in 1975 which cured the V8's <b>oil</b> <b>surge</b> problems and Bond {{went on to win the}} 1975 Australian Touring Car Championship whilst also competing in rally events for HDT in a LH Torana SL/R 5000 L34. While the L34 solved the engine problems, the Torana still had one major weak spot in that the axles on the car were easily broken. In later years drivers such as Bond, Brock, Bob Morris and Allan Grice would all tell how carefully they had to drive the cars in order for them to finish races.|$|E
50|$|Despite the BT55's {{problems}} {{and lack of}} results Murray remained convinced that his design was correct. During 1986 it was discovered the car's main problem was actually the BMW engine which in the lowline design had to be turned to an angle of 18° from horizontal. This caused <b>oil</b> <b>surge</b> in the corners and also {{had the effect of}} harming the engine's already poor throttle response. While the car had better downforce in the corners than its predecessor {{and was one of the}} fastest in a straight line thanks to its low drag, the engine problems saw to it that the car was only competitive on the fast circuits of the year such as Hockenheim, the Österreichring and Monza. In a late 1986 season interview, Murray stated that he believed the lowline concept would work better if mated to a more compact V6 such as the Honda or TAG-Porsche engines, rather than a taller Straight-4 like the BMW. A further noteworthy aspect was the inconsistent Pirelli race tyres which had also hampered the team's 1985 season.|$|E

The engine was specifically designed and configured for the purpose, being a twin cylinder in-line arrangement with double overhead camshafts and four valves per cylinder. Most of the engine components were specially cast or machined from billets. A detailed theoretical analysis was completed to determine engine specifications and operating conditions. Results from the analysis indicated a new engine design was necessary to sustain highly TC operation. Dry sump lubrication was implemented after initial <b>oil</b> <b>surge</b> problems were found with the wet sump system during vehicle testing. The design {{and development of the}} system is outlined, together with brake performance effects for the varying systems. Tuning an odd fire engine with an intake restriction and upstream throttle location was explored together with varying injector locations and manifold geometry. To improve engine efficiency, turbocharging and specific engine downsizing were employed in conjunction with a lean burn strategy at low brake mean effective pressure (BMEP). This engine package and tuning strategy resulted in the Melbourne University Formula SAE vehicle being very successful in competition, finishing first in the fuel economy event at the 2004 Australasian competition. Peak BMEP values of 25 bar, believed to be the highest recorded for small engines on pump gasoline were also achieved. 5 - 7 DecemberOpen Acces...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{develop a}} {{structural}} {{model of the}} global market for crude oil {{that for the first}} time explicitly allows for shocks to the speculative demand for oil as well as shocks to flow demand and flow supply. The speculative component of the real price of oil is identified with the help of data on oil inventories. Our estimates rule out explanations of the 2003 - 08 <b>oil</b> price <b>surge</b> based on unexpectedly diminishing oil supplies and based on speculative trading. Instead, this surge was caused by unexpected increases in world oil consumption driven by the global business cycle. There is evidence, however, that speculative demand shifts played an important role during earlier oil price shock episodes including 1979, 1986, and 1990. Our analysis implies that additional regulation of oil markets would not have prevented the 2003 - 08 <b>oil</b> price <b>surge.</b> We also show that, even after accounting for the role of inventories in smoothing oil consumption, our estimate of the short-run price elasticity of oil demand is much higher than traditional estimates from dynamic models that do not account for price endogeneity.

40|$|US {{and state}} governments have subsidized ethanol since 1978, and the {{rationale}} for these subsidies has varied over time from supporting farm prices and income, to environmental quality, and more recently to energy security and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.

Thus, in the 2005 - 07 period, ethanol was extremely profitable inducing substantial new investment. For the future, different political action groups and political figures propose renewable fuels targets or standards ranging from 35 to 100 billion gallons per year. To achieve anything like these levels, {{it is likely that the}} current policy set will need to be reconsidered. In addition to the current policy, this paper considers using a subsidy tied to the energy security gains and greenhouse gas emission reductions provided by renewable fuels, subsidies targeted specifically at cellulose ethanol, and different versions of a renewable fuel standard such as the one passed by the US Senate. It is clear that we must develop a better understanding of the consequences of these alternative policy pathways. ...|$|R

The forward-looking element of the real price of oil is identified with the help of data on oil inventories. The model estimates rule out explanations of the 2003 - 08 <b>oil</b> price <b>surge</b> based on unexpectedly diminishing oil supplies and based on speculative trading. Instead, we find that this surge was caused by fluctuations in the flow demand for oil driven by the global business cycle. There is evidence, however, that speculative demand shifts played an important role during earlier oil price shock episodes including 1979, 1986, and 1990. Recently, it has been suggested that it is possible for speculative trading to occur even without any change in oil inventories, if the short-run price elasticity of oil demand is zero. Our structural model allows us to obtain an estimate of this elasticity based on shifts of the supply curve along the demand curve. We show that, even after accounting for the role of inventories in smoothing oil consumption, our estimate of the price elasticity of oil demand is not close to zero and much higher than traditional estimates from dynamic models that do not account for price endogeneity.
