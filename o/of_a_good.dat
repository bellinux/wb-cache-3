5|$|Breadth of {{definition}} of a good: The broader the definition <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> (or service), the lower the elasticity. For example, Company X's fish and chips would {{tend to have a}} relatively high elasticity of demand if a significant number of substitutes are available, whereas food in general would have an extremely low elasticity of demand because no substitutes exist.|$|E
5|$|Early {{treatment}} {{increases the}} chance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> outcome. Treatment consists of stabilizing the person, {{followed by the}} use of an antidote. The preferred antidote is fomepizole with ethanol used if this is not available. Hemodialysis may also be used in those where there is organ damage or a high degree of acidosis. Other treatments may include sodium bicarbonate, thiamine, and magnesium.|$|E

5|$|Price {{elasticity}} of demand (PED or Ed) {{is a measure}} used in economics to show the responsiveness, or elasticity, of the quantity demanded <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> or service {{to a change in}} its price, ceteris paribus.

5|$|With {{economies of}} scale, the PPF would curve inward, with the {{opportunity}} cost of one good falling as more of it is produced.

5|$|A patient's genome {{may include}} an {{inherited}} or random mutation which affects {{the probability of}} developing a disease in the future. For example, Lynch syndrome is a genetic disease that predisposes patients to colorectal and other cancers; early detection can lead to close monitoring that improves the patient's chances <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> outcome. Cardiovascular risk is indicated by biological markers and screening can measure the risk that a child will be born with a genetic disease such as Cystic fibrosis. Genetic testing is ethically complex: patients may not want the stress of knowing their risk. In countries without universal healthcare, a known risk may raise insurance premiums.|$|E

5|$|An {{important}} statistic {{tracked by}} {{the game is}} Karma which {{is affected by the}} decisions and actions the character performs during the game. Positive actions to Karma include freeing captives and helping others, while negative actions towards this include killing good characters and stealing. Actions vary in the level of karma change they cause; thus, pickpocketing produces less negative karma than the killing <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> character. Karma can have tangible effects to the player, beyond acting as flavor for the game's events, in that it can affect the ending the player gets, alter dialogue with non-player characters (NPCs) or give off unique reactions from other characters, while also granting access to certain perks that require a specific Karma level. However, the player's relationships with the game's factions are distinct, so any two groups or settlements may view the player in contrasting ways, depending on the player's conduct.|$|E
5|$|Bert Combs {{was born}} in the Town Branch section of Manchester, Kentucky on August 13, 1911; he was one of seven {{children}} of Stephen Gibson and Martha (Jones) Combs. Combs's father Stephen, a part-time logger and farmer, was active in local politics, despite being a Democrat in a county where a large majority of residents were Republicans. His mother was a teacher, and she impressed upon her children the importance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> education. Bert's first school was the two-room Beech Creek grade school. When he reached the seventh grade, his parents sent him and his sister to Oneida Baptist Institute in nearby Oneida because its school term was 8 to 9 months long, as opposed to the 5- to 6-month terms at Beech Creek. Later, Combs and his sister began riding a donkey every day to Clay County High School. Combs excelled academically and skipped some grades, graduating as valedictorian of his class in 1927 at age 15.|$|E
5|$|Economists have {{observed}} that consumers tend to travel more when their cars are more fuel efficient, causing a 'rebound' in the demand for fuel. An increase in the efficiency with which a resource (e.g. fuel) is used, causes {{a decrease in the}} cost of using that resource when measured in terms of what it can achieve (e.g. travel). Generally speaking, a decrease in the cost (or price) <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> or service will increase the quantity demanded (the law of demand). With a lower cost for travel, consumers will travel more, increasing the demand for fuel. This increase in demand is known as the rebound effect, and {{it may or may not}} be large enough to offset the original drop in demand from the increased efficiency. The Jevons paradox occurs when the rebound effect is greater than 100%, exceeding the original efficiency gains.|$|E

5|$|For Kant a {{good will}} is a broader {{conception}} than a will which acts from duty. A will which acts from duty is distinguishable as a will which overcomes hindrances {{in order to}} keep the moral law. A dutiful will is thus a special case <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> will which becomes visible in adverse conditions. Kant argues that only acts performed with regard to duty have moral worth. This is not to say that acts performed merely in accordance with duty are worthless (these still deserve approval and encouragement), but that special esteem is given to acts which are performed out of duty.|$|E
5|$|He was accepted, and {{although}} his appointment delighted Murray, {{the government was}} very concerned at the loss <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> Attorney General. In an attempt {{to persuade him to}} stay, the new Prime Minister, the Duke of Newcastle offered him the Duchy of Lancaster, in addition to the position of Attorney General, an extra £6,000 a year, and a pension, and finally attempted to blackmail him by saying that if he accepted the office of Lord Chief Justice, the government would refuse to grant him a peerage. It was customary for all Lord Chief Justices to be given a peerage, and Murray responded by saying that in that situation he would refuse to become either Lord Chief Justice or Attorney General. Newcastle gave in, and promised to allow him to become Lord Chief Justice and to recommend him for a peerage.|$|E

5|$|Morris {{marked his}} {{first-class}} debut on English soil with a fluent 138 against Worcestershire, which was scored in only {{four hours and}} made him the first Australian centurion on tour. Morris found batting difficult {{for the first few}} weeks as he adapted to the alien batting conditions, reaching 50 only twice in his next nine innings with a total of 223 runs at 24.77; Morris sometimes attempted to drive balls pitched just short <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> length, and if they reared suddenly he was liable to be caught.

5|$|The book {{is divided}} into nine {{chapters}} with seven appendices. The first chapter details the pig and its use in antiquity before summarizing the nutrient components of pork in comparison to beef. The second chapter opens with the defining characteristics <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> bacon pig. The six principal breeds of the United Kingdom {{at the time were}} the Large White Yorkshire, the Middle White, the Tamworth, the Berkshire, the Lincolnshire Curly-Coated and the Large Black. The Large White Yorkshire breed is traced to Robert Bakewell and highlights the importance of the breed for its quick maturity, rapid fattening and providing a long side. Though also credited for the breeding of the Small White pig, Bakewell was secretive in his work and evidence of his pig breeding (as a whole) cannot be confirmed. Nicholls describes the other breeds and provides information on the number of pigs, the state of the industry and the classification of pigs for the market.|$|E
