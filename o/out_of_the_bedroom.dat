5|$|There {{were three}} {{telephones}} {{at the farm}} on the night, {{all on the same}} landline. There was usually a cordless phone with a memory-recall feature in the kitchen; a beige digital phone, also kept in the kitchen; and a cream rotary phone in the main bedroom. (There was normally a fourth phone too, a blue digital phone in the first-floor office, but it had been sent for repairs on 5 August.) The rotary phone had at some point been moved <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> and into the kitchen, where the police found it after the murders with its receiver off the hook. They found the beige digital phone under a pile of magazines in the kitchen.|$|E

Katie comes <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> with the knife still in her hand, the police ask her to drop the knife. Following a heated confrontation, a door behind one of the police officer slams shut, causing the officer to shoot Katie, killing her.

25|$|The {{events of}} the seventeenth night have psychologically terrified the couple, {{which in turn has}} {{strengthened}} the demon. Over the next few nights, the paranormal activity is excessive and intense. They eventually call Dr. Fredrichs back to the house, but he is overwhelmed by the demonic energy upon entering. He apologetically leaves despite their pleas, stating that his presence only makes the demon angrier. The bleak reality causes the couple to lose all hope, which makes the demon strong {{enough to be able to}} pull Katie <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> and bite her, causing her to become fully possessed. Micah discovers the bite mark and deciding events are too out of control to remain in the house, he packs to head to a motel. Just as they are set to leave, the possessed Katie insists they will be okay now.|$|E

25|$|While Sykes and Haytham {{watch the}} {{entrance}} to the complex, al-Ghazi, Fleury, and Mayes follow a blood trail and kill many gunmen inside. Mayes, separated from the others, finds Leavitt and his attackers, preparing an execution video of Leavitt. She kills the remaining insurgents, and al-Ghazi and the team start to leave. Fleury then realizes there is a trail of blood leading {{to the back of the}} apartment, and al-Ghazi sees the grandfather and inspects his hand. When the old man gives him his hand, al-Ghazi sees that the man is missing the same fingers as Abu Hamza al-Masri in the terrorist group's many videos and confirms his suspicion that the grandfather is the terrorist leader. Abu Hamza's teenage grandson walks <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> and shoots al-Ghazi in the neck, then he starts to point his gun at Mayes, prompting Fleury to kill him. Abu Hamza then pulls out an assault rifle and Haytham kills him. As Abu Hamza dies, another grandchild hugs him and Abu Hamza whispers something into his ear to calm the child down. Al-Ghazi dies in Fleury's arms.|$|E

The two began arguing heatedly in the bedroom, during which Stompanato threatened to kill Turner, her daughter, and her mother. Fearing that her mother's life was in danger, Turner's fourteen-year-old daughter, Cheryl, grabbed a kitchen knife and ran to Turner's defense. According to testimony provided by Turner at the coroner's inquest, Cheryl, who had {{been listening to the}} couple's fight behind the closed door, stabbed Stompanato in the stomach when Turner attempted to usher him <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom.</b> [...] " [...] I thought [...] hit him in the stomach," [...] Turner testified in court.

Priya Elan of NME described the lyrics [...] "Suck my cockiness, [...] my persuasion" [...] as [...] "cringey", but complimented the song's compositional structure, writing that it provides a [...] "genuine elastic thrill, twisting into all sorts of jaw-dropping musical shapes". Randell Roberts of the Los Angeles Times described [...] "Cockiness (Love It)" [...] and another track from the album, [...] "Birthday Cake", as the [...] "breast and booty" [...] of Talk That Talk but noted that they failed to capture the raunchiness that they set out to achieve. Melissa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly also wrote that [...] "Cockiness (Love It)" [...] and [...] "Birthday Cake" [...] were the most provocative songs on the album, describing them as [...] "I-like-it-rough tracks", but criticized them for being album fillers designed to get the listener <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> and on to the dance floor.|$|E

Sam Lansky of MTV Buzzworthy was complimentary of [...] "Birthday Cake", writing, [...] "The only misstep on the album – not because it's not amazing (it is!), but because it's only 78 seconds long.

40|$|This study {{examined}} physical activity, sedentary behaviours, location of electronic media and snacking among children from five countries. These variables were assessed by ecological momentary assessment (EMA) using a free-time diary. Data {{were obtained from}} 812 secondary-school students (348 male, 464 female) aged from 12 to 18 years in United Kingdom, China, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia. We found that {{less than half the}} students met <b>the</b> recommended guideline <b>of</b> 60 minutes daily physical activity (48 % of British, 40 % of Romanian, 34 % of Slovakian, 20 % of Hungarian and only 4 % of Chinese students met this criterion). Ninety-six percent of British and 86 % of Hungarian youth had more than one TV set in their home, followed by Romanian (64 %), Slovakian (64 %) and Chinese (29 %) counterparts. Most British (73 %) youths had televisions in their bedroom, followed by Hungarians (66 %), Romanians (37 %), Slovakians (35 %) and Chinese (4 %). When compared to females, male students spent significantly more time on TV/DVD/video viewing (on average 110. 7 vs 90. 2 minutes/day; p<. 001) and playing computer games (on average 34. 0 vs 10. 5 minutes/day; p<. 001). Students who had a TV in their bedroom spent more time watching TV compared to those without a TV in their bedroom (on average 109 vs 91 minutes/day, p<. 001). Higher levels of TV viewing were associated with more snack food consumption (r=. 13, p<. 01). In order to promote less TV viewing and snacking, it may be useful to keep TVs <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedrooms</b> <b>of</b> children and adolescents...|$|R

Hoskins described Barry Bonds's use of anabolic steroids, and how his personal trainer, Greg Anderson, would discuss taking the steroids in an open manner. Even though Hoskins never witnessed Barry Bonds actually taking the drugs, he witnessed Anderson handling the needle, and Barry Bonds going in and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom,</b> and Barry Bonds complaining about the shots leaving his butt sore. Barry Bonds would use his girlfriends to get the steroids, and would pay them a few thousand dollars at a time. Heisler analyzes the different sports and their testings.

Beck and Robertson also discussed Washed Out, as well as Toro y Moi, dubbing the album an unfunny parody of chillwave and also criticized it as [...] "such a strong homage to everything that's cool about retro-chic that you can't help but smell a rat". At PopMatters, Wisnicki wrote that Era Extraña {{did not have the}} same quality tunes and aesthetic that Psychic Chasms had, declaring that while each song on Psychic Chasms [...] "felt like getting to open another piece of candy", Era Extraña [...] "feels more like opening one of those refrigerated boxed sandwiches from the grocery store".|$|E

5000|$|In 1909, Sergei Diaghilev invited Fokine {{to become}} <b>the</b> {{resident}} choreographer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first season <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ballets Russes in Paris. Fokine's years with Ballets Russes were successful, collaborating with other artists {{to create a}} ballet of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov's Scheherazade which premiered in 1910. This ballet was inspired by symphonic poems composed by Rimsky-Korsakov and ancient tales of 1001 nights {{also known as the}} Arabian nights. The spectacular sets designed by Léon Bakst matched the sexually charged choreography. Despite his lack <b>of</b> historic accuracy, <b>the</b> ballet was widely successful due to its brilliant colors, exoticism and sexual overtones. [...] (1910, featuring Vaslav Nijinsky in <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Golden Slave); The Firebird (1910) was also created by a [...] "committee," [...] a system inspired by <b>the</b> Wagnerian notion <b>of</b> Gesamtkunstwerk, which translates as <b>the</b> synthesis <b>of</b> theatrical elements like; music, drama, spectacle and dance, giving birth to a more cohesive art work. Petrushka (1912), with music composed by Igor Stravinsky and sets designs by Alexandre Benois Petrouchka was inspired by the Russian puppet which traditionally appeared at the Butter Week (Shrovetide, Pre-Lenten) Fairs. In this ballet Fokine included, street dancers, peddlers, nursemaids a performing bear and a large ensemble of characters that complemented the plot. The story was centered on the sinister Magician (Enricco Ceccetti) and his three puppets; Petrouchka (Nijinsky) the Ballerina (Karsavina) and the savage Moor (Alexander Orlov) and Daphnis et Chloé (1912). Fokine's ballet Le Spectre de la Rose (1911) showcased Nijinsky as <b>the</b> spirit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rose given to a young girl. His exit featured a grand jeté <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> young girl's <b>bedroom</b> window, timed so the audience would last see him suspended in mid-air.|$|R

60|$|It was, perhaps, {{about two}} in the morning when a man, very {{efficient}} at the trade which he was then following, knelt outside Lady Eustace's door, and, with a delicately-made saw, aided, probably, by some other equally well-finished tools, absolutely cut <b>out</b> that portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> door on which the bolt was fastened. He must have known the spot exactly, for he did not doubt a moment as he commenced his work; and yet there was nothing on <b>the</b> exterior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> door to show where the bolt was placed. The bit was cut out without the slightest noise, and then, when the door was opened, was placed, just inside, upon the floor. The man then with perfectly noiseless step entered the room, knelt again,--just where poor Lizzie had knelt as she said her prayers,--so that he might the more easily raise the iron box without a struggle, and left the room with it in his arms without disturbing the lovely sleeper. He then descended the stairs, passed into the coffee-room at <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> them, and handed the box through an open window to a man who was crouching on the outside in the dark.
