40|$|As a {{case study}} for testing and field monitoring, a small EHXair-hor <b>one-pipe</b> <b>system</b> for a single-family house was chosen. It is placed in Rubiana, a small town located on a false plan intruding the left slope of the low Susa Val-ley nearby Turin, with the centre at 643 m {{altitude}} a. s. l [...] A yearly ambient temperature profile of the location is shown in Table 1. Wind flow has a breeze pattern with cyclical daily alternate directions along the south facing slope, typical of a mountain region. The EHXair-hor system is made of a 48 m-long curved pipe buried at a depth varying from 2, 6 to 3, 2 m, in an enlarged construction site trench surrounding the house as shown in Figure 1. The pipe was placed on a compacted and levelled sand bed and covered by sand as well. The 25 cm-diameter pipe is made of 4, 9 mm-thick PVC and has two open ends, placed at different heights to allow for drainage of condensation water. At the lower end a variable velocity fan is applied, work-ing to inlet the air. A pictures showing {{the placement of the}} pipe is shown in Figure 2. Figure 1 : The construction site trench surrounding the test house, where the buried pipe was located. Earth heat exchange (EHX) through buried horizontal air ducts (EHXair-hor) can be an effective passive/ibryde system to reduce heating and cooling loads in temperate climate zones. This paper shows the results of the au-thors â€™ most recent testing and design experience on the field. Conclusions are drawn in relation to the necessity of further monitoring and testing on more complex and variegated EHXair-hor systems. 1...|$|E

There were three primary objectives: {{to determine whether}} fuel consumption was lower in buildings using TRVs: to determine if occupants would accept the TRVs: and to determine if overheating in apartments could be eliminated using TRVs. ...|$|R
40|$|Considerable {{research}} {{has been carried out}} on the optimisation of water distribution systems (WDSs) within the last three decades. In previous research, attention has mainly focused on the minimisation {{of the cost of the}} networks. The study described in this paper extends previous research by incorporating into the optimisation an environmental sustainability criterion of minimising Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. A Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm was developed to solve this problem. The impacts of minimising GHG emissions on the result s of WDS optimisation have been explored for two simple case studies: a <b>one-pipe</b> pumping <b>system</b> and one multi-pump system. In addition, results obtained from optimising WDSs accounting for bot h the economic and environmental sustainability objectives are compared with those obtained when only the economic objective was considered. A comparison of results indicates that the inclusion of GHG emission minimisation as one of the objectives results in significant tradeoffs between the economic objective and the environmental sustainability objective. This research will allow the consideration of sustainability criteria in the planning, design and evaluation of WDSs, and further contribute to sustainable development in urban areas.

40|$|This {{report was}} written as a {{resource}} for professionals involved in multifamily audits, retrofit delivery, and program design, as well as for building owners and contractors. It is intended to serve as a guide for those looking to evaluate and improve the efficiency and operation of <b>one-pipe</b> steam heating <b>systems.</b> In centrally heated multifamily buildings with steam or hydronic systems, the cost of heat for tenants is typically absorbed into the owner's operating costs. Highly variable and rising energy costs have placed a heavy burden on landlords. In the absence of well-designed and relevant efficiency efforts, increased operating costs would be passed on to tenants who often cannot afford those increases. Misinvestment is a common problem with older heating systems [...] multiple contractors may inadequately or inappropriately upgrade parts of systems and reduce system functionality and efficiency, or the system has not been properly maintained...|$|R
40|$|Climate change, {{especially}} {{global warming}} caused by human activities, presents serious global risks. Mitigating global warming by reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions {{is a unique}} challenge facing our generation. For all industries, actions {{must be taken to}} reduce emissions and the water industry must play its part. Previous research on water distribution system (WDS) optimisation has found that the discount rate used in the conceptual design process of a WDS involving pumping has {{a significant impact on the}} final design of the network, which in turn has an impact on the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions generated from the system. In this paper, the impact of the discount rate used in project planning on the final decision making of WDS design is investigated via a <b>one-pipe</b> water transmission <b>system.</b> Two different pumping systems with pipe lengths of 15 km and 150 km are used as case studies. The total cost of the WDS with different pipe diameters has been evaluated using a high and a low discount rate in the literature. The total GHG emissions from these systems are also calculated in this paper. The computation shows that different discount rates lead to different least-cost WDS networks. A lower discount rate than the cost of capital can lead to a final WDS design with significant GHG reductions. Wenyan Wu, Angus Simpson and Holger Maie...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{measured the}} energy savings associated with installing thermostatic radiator valves (TRVs) on <b>one-pipe</b> low-pressure steam <b>systems</b> in New York City multifamily buildings. There were three primary objectives: {{to determine whether}} fuel consumption was lower in buildings using TRVs; to determine if occupants would accept the TRVs; and to determine if overheating in apartments could be eliminated using TRVs. Eight buildings, {{ranging in size from}} 15 to 26 apartments, were monitored for three years. Each building was audited to determine fuel history and quick-payback energy conservation measures. The project covered three phases; phase- 1 consisted of installing low-cost energy conservation measures such as pipe insulation, air vents and burner tune-tips; determining each building`s baseline energy use, and recording baseline apartment temperatures. TRV installations occurred in phases 2 and 3. In phase- 2, TRVs were installed in half the apartments in four buildings. In phase- 3, TRVs were installed in the remainder of the apartments. Experimental results were conclusive. Buildings with overheated apartments achieved energy savings through the installation of TRVs. The authors research shows an average reduction of 9. 45 % in space heating energy use occurred with partial installation of TRVs, and savings of 15. 5 % were achieved after full installation. Buildings with the highest average apartment temperatures during the base year showed the greatest energy savings. Simple payback, based on an installed price of $ 50 per TRV, averaged 3. 1 years...|$|R
