40|$|The {{algebraic}} notion <b>of</b> <b>openings</b> <b>of</b> a map-germ {{is introduced}} in this paper. An opening separates the self-intersections {{of the original}} map-germ, preserving its singularities. The notion <b>of</b> <b>openings</b> {{is different from the}} notion <b>of</b> unfoldings. <b>Openings</b> do not unfold the singularities. For example, the swallowtail is an <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> the Whitney’s cusp map-germ from plane to plane and the open swallowtail is a versal <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> them. <b>Openings</b> <b>of</b> map-germs appear as typical singularities in several problems of geometry and its applications. The notion <b>of</b> <b>openings</b> has close relations to isotropic map-germs in a symplectic space and integral map-germs in a contact space. We describe the <b>openings</b> <b>of</b> Morin singularities, namely, stable unfoldings of map-germs of corank one. The relation <b>of</b> unfoldings and <b>openings</b> are discussed. Moreover we provide a method to construct versal <b>openings</b> <b>of</b> map-germs and give versal <b>openings</b> <b>of</b> stable map-germs (R 4, 0) ! (R 4, 0). Lastly the relation of lowerable vector fields and openings is discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|An {{algorithm}} {{was developed}} to predict the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>openings</b> in naturally, ventilated agricultural buildings. Validation was conducted in a wind tunnel using scale models under isothermal conditions. Wind angle of incidence, wind velocity, the ratio of height to width <b>of</b> <b>openings</b> and roof slope were varied. Wind angle of incidence and wind velocity had the greatest influence on opening effectiveness. Changes in the ratio of height to width <b>of</b> <b>openings</b> and roof slope had measurable but smaller effects...|$|R

The {{branches}} of the postorbital and jugal that usually surround the back {{and bottom of the}} eye socket in therocephalians appear to be either very reduced or absent entirely. Meanwhile, the top of the eye socket is formed by the prefrontal, and the frontal is also small. The skull does not bear a pineal foramen.

5|$|Following the German invasion, Molotov {{conducted}} urgent {{negotiations with}} Britain and, later, the United States for wartime alliances.

5|$|Honeyeaters {{prefer to}} forage at {{individual}} flowers which have only just opened, as these {{offer the most}} nectar. As they probe for nectar, honeyeaters end up with large quantities of pollen on their beaks, foreheads and throats, some of which they subsequently transfer to other flowers. This transfer is quite efficient: flowers typically lose nearly all their pollen within four hours <b>of</b> <b>opening,</b> and pollen is deposited on the majority of stigmata. Around 15% of these stigmata end up with pollen lodged in the stigmatic groove, a prerequisite to fertilisation.|$|E
5|$|In 1847 Staunton {{published}} {{his most famous}} work, The Chess-Player's Handbook, which is still in print. It contained over 300 pages <b>of</b> <b>opening</b> analysis, and almost 100 pages of endgame analysis. Modern endgame tablebases confirm Staunton's assessments of both endgames. Staunton's Handbook was based on Bilguer and von der Lasa's Handbuch des Schachspiels (first published in 1843), but enhanced by many variations and analyses of Staunton's own. His book The Chess-Player's Companion followed in 1849.|$|E

5|$|In 1943, due to fear of Allied bombing, {{the prime}} {{minister}} of the Independent State of Croatia (NDH), Nikola Mandić, ordered the creation of a public bomb shelter under the hill of Gornji Grad. The said shelter was to be connected to an east-west corridor spanning the entirety of the hill. A sum of 141.2million NDH kuna was allocated for planning and construction of the tunnel. The project was assigned to engineers Abramović, Senjaković and Vajda. The plan was to construct the tunnel in 90 working days, but the cost rose to 490 million kuna (partly due to high wartime inflation) and the date <b>of</b> <b>opening</b> was delayed into 1944.|$|E

The co-designers for the interior renovation were Rockwell Group Europe and Virgin Hotels' in-house design team. The purchase was part of Virgin Hotels' 2010 business plan to acquire distressed properties in North America cheaply during the property downturn.|$|E
