5|$|Gategood {{could not}} get through on the radio because the petrol {{generator}} that supplied power to the radios at Mud Bay had broken down, thereby cutting Arnold's link with Mud Bay, Milne Force and Taleba Bay. Arnold launched an attack on Kilia at 09:10, supported by two 3-inch mortars and 100rounds that had been brought up from Mud Bay. A promised air strike failed to arrive. Instead, Japanese aircraft strafed the Australian positions, {{as well as the}} ketch Maclaren King in Mud Bay with wounded men on board, resulting in further casualties. Arnold attempted a flanking movement with A Company, but it became lost in the jungle. The attack then became a frontal <b>one</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> main Japanese defences, which Arnold chose not to press.|$|E
5|$|Handley was {{replaced}} by Dan Reeves, the successful former {{head coach of the}} Denver Broncos who led the Broncos to three Super Bowls in four years, <b>one</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Giants. After his dismissal from the Broncos, Reeves took the unusual step of lobbying heavily for the job. Especially after being publicly rebuffed by a number of candidates, George Young was pleased that someone with Reeves's credentials wanted the job, and Reeves was hired as Giants head coach. He had been a finalist along with Perkins for the team's head coaching position in 1979, but Young went with Perkins at the time because he felt he knew him better from their days together with the Baltimore Colts.|$|E
5|$|On 13 March, Hitler signed Operational Order No. 5, which {{authorised}} several offensives, including <b>one</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Kursk salient. As {{the last}} Soviet resistance in Kharkov petered out, Manstein attempted to persuade Günther von Kluge, commander of Army Group Centre, to immediately attack the Central Front, which was defending the northern {{face of the}} salient. Kluge refused, believing that his forces were too weak to launch such an attack. Further Axis advances were blocked by Soviet forces that had been shifted down from the Central Front to the area north of Belgorod. By mid-April, amid poor weather and with the German forces exhausted {{and in need of}} refitting, the offensives of Operational Order No. 5 were postponed.|$|E

Young finished the series with a 21 record and a 1.85 ERA in four appearances, and Boston defeated Pittsburgh, five games to three games.|$|E
5|$|The often uproarious and {{spectacular}} Cuocolo trial attracted {{a lot of}} attention of newspapers and the general public both in Italy {{as well as in the}} United States, including by Pathé's Gazette.

5|$|After their disappointing {{run in the}} World Cup, Saeed {{rejoined the}} team in the 1986 Asian Games where he scored a goal against Oman in Iraq's first match which ended 4–0 and another <b>one</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> UAE in the 2–1 defeat. He missed the Iraq's 5–1 win over Pakistan and the quarterfinal with Saudi Arabia which ended in a 1–1 draw, leading the match to {{penalties}} where Iraq lost 9–8. Saeed appeared in all of Iraq's matches in the 1988 Summer Olympics qualifiers and scored four goals: three against Jordan and one against Qatar, getting qualified to the Summer Olympics {{for the third time}} in the row where they were knocked out again from the group stage after finishing 3rd in the Group B table. 1988 was the first year where Saeed didn't score any goal since his debut year in 1976.|$|E
5|$|Charles I, {{who ruled}} from 1331 to 1357, {{and was the}} son of François Grimaldi's cousin Rainier I, {{significantly}} enlarged the fortress by adding two large buildings: <b>one</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> eastern ramparts and the second looking out over the sea. This changed the appearance of the fortress, making it appear more of a fortified house than a fortress. The fortifications remained very necessary, for during the next three decades the fortress was alternately lost and regained by the Grimaldi to the Genoese. In 1341 the Grimaldi took Menton and then Roquebrune, thus consolidating their power and strength in the area. Subsequently they strengthened not only the defences of the harbour but also their fortress on the Rocher. The Grimaldi's stronghold was now a power base from which the family ruled a large but very vulnerable area of land.|$|E
5|$|Charlton scored four {{international}} hat-tricks; {{in addition}} to the <b>one</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> United States, he scored three goals in a game against Luxembourg during the 1962 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, and in friendlies against Mexico and Switzerland. He scored more goals against Northern Ireland than any other team, with six goals, while he scored five goals against each of Luxembourg, Portugal, Scotland and Wales. Of Charlton's 49 goals, 22 were scored in friendlies. In competitive matches, the majority of his goals came during British Home Championship matches. Charlton scored 16 times in these matches, including 3 in tournaments which doubled as qualification for UEFA Euro 1968. He scored four goals during FIFA World Cup tournaments, including three goals during the 1966 FIFA World Cup, which England won, collecting one during the group stage and both goals in England's 2–1 victory over Portugal in the semi-final.|$|E

In Week 5 against the San Francisco 49ers, week six against the Atlanta Falcons and week seven against the Tennessee Titans, Kafka was the backup to Kolb after Vick, who took over as the starting quarterback {{for the remainder of}} the season, suffered a rib injury in Week 4 against the Washington Redskins. In the week seventeen game against the Dallas Cowboys, Kafka was the backup quarterback to Kolb in a decision to rest Vick and the team's starters before the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|Pluralists use {{the term}} Crusade of any {{campaign}} explicitly sanctioned by the reigning Pope. This reflects {{the view of the}} Roman Catholic Church (including medieval contemporaries such as Saint Bernard of Clairvaux) that every military campaign given Papal sanction is equally valid as a Crusade, regardless of its cause, justification, or geographic location. This broad definition includes attacks on paganism and heresy such as the Albigensian Crusade, the Northern Crusades, and the Hussite Wars, and wars for political or territorial advantage such as the Aragonese Crusade in Sicily, a Crusade declared by Pope InnocentIII against Markward of Anweiler in 1202, <b>one</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Stedingers, several (declared by different popes) against Emperor FrederickII and his sons, two Crusades against opponents of King Henry III of England, and the Christian re-conquest of Iberia.|$|E
5|$|Saeed {{participated in}} the 1982 Gulf Cup of Nations in Abu Dhabi, scoring {{a total of five}} goals in the tournament: one against Oman, two against Bahrain, one against Saudi Arabia, and a last <b>one</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> UAE. Although Iraq {{finished}} 1st in the table, they withdrew from the competition by an order from Former President Saddam Hussein to motivate Kuwait who qualified to the 1982 FIFA World Cup by letting them win which led to scratching all of Iraq's results from the competition. In the same year, Saeed led Iraq to win their first ever gold medal in the Asian Games in the 1982 Asian Games, under the management of Ammo Baba, in New Delhi. In Iraq's first match, Saeed scored a goal in an easy 4–0 win over Burma. He also scored two goals in Iraq's 3–0 win against Nepal. In the quarterfinal, Iraq won over Japan with a single goal in extra time from Emad Jassim and, in the semifinal, they defeated Saudi Arabia with one goal. On 3 December, the final match was played between Iraq and Kuwait, where Saeed gained Iraq's gold medal when he scored the winning goal in the 82nd minute of the match with a through pass from Karim Mohammed Allawi.|$|E

5|$|Using the {{retreating}} South Korean troops {{to cover their}} movements, the Chinese had infiltrated the brigade position {{in the initial stages}} of the battle, penetrating between A and B Companies, 3 RAR astride the road, and largely surrounding the latter before moving into the rear positions. The Australians struggled to distinguish the Chinese from the South Koreans in the dark, although the Korean Service Corps porters attached to the battalion were able to provide valuable assistance to the defenders distinguishing the Chinese by the sounds of their voices. At 21:30 the Chinese launched their first attack on the forward platoon of American tanks, which had been posted on the road without infantry support. The initial moves were easily repelled; however, a stronger attack an hour later forced the tanks to withdraw after two of the tank commanders were killed, including the platoon commander. The Chinese then proceeded to assault the Australians on two different axes: <b>one</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> two forward companies in front of Hill 504, and the other through the valley astride the road around Battalion Headquarters. Finally, by 23:00 the New Zealand artillery had returned to the brigade, although they provided only limited support {{throughout the rest of the}} night.|$|E
5|$|Vick {{came into}} week {{one of the}} 2012 season as the starter, despite a solid showing from rookie Nick Foles in the preseason. Vick led the Eagles to a 17–16 victory in week <b>one</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Cleveland Browns despite {{throwing}} four interceptions. The Eagles won their following game against the Baltimore Ravens, but lost 27–6 in {{the third week of}} the season to the Arizona Cardinals. Facing former teammate Kevin Kolb, Vick completed only 17 of 37 passes with no touchdowns and two lost fumbles. The Eagles went on to beat the New York Giants, but then lost three straight games. After the third loss against the Falcons on October 28, calls for coach Andy Reid to replace Vick with Foles intensified. Reid refused to make the move.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 1950 season, Linde signed a new {{contract}} with the Indians, but was released in February and sent to the Portland Beavers in the PCL. Over the course of the season, Linde won 5 games and lost 13 in 47 appearances, 18 of them starts, and amassed an ERA of 4.66. The following year, in 1951, Linde became a regular starter on the team, and before the end of April he had won as many games as he had won all of last year. He finished the season with a 12–12 record and a 4.29 ERA in 32 starts. In 1952, Linde remained part of the core starting rotation of the past couple years alongside Red Adams and Marino Pieretti. His performances included <b>one</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Angels in which Linde kept the team to five hits as the Beavers won 4–3 in 11 innings. He won 11 games, lost 15, threw 119 strikeouts, and brought his ERA down to 3.10 in 41 season appearances, 28 of them starts. In 1953, Linde started the season strong unlike his fellow pitchers, opening his season with a 2–1 victory against the Angels on April 3. In early May, he ended Ted Beard's streak of hitting safely in 12 straight at-bats, which tied the PCL record at the time. Shortly afterward, Linde won what was considered an odd performance as he allowed 15 hits and 20 runners on base, yet won a game against the Sacramento Solons 8–3. In his final professional season, Linde pitched in 36 games and finished with a 13–10 record and a 3.36 ERA.|$|E
