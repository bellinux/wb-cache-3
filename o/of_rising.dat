5|$|After {{the sharp}} fall in bond prices of 2013 ("taper tantrum"), investors {{continued}} {{to question the}} impact <b>of</b> <b>rising</b> rates on risk parity portfolios or other more concentrated equity portfolios. A historical analysis of episodes <b>of</b> <b>rising</b> rates show the value in distinguishing between orderly and disorderly rising rates regimes. Risk parity has weaker performance in disorderly rising rates environments but its performance over time is not dependent on falling bond yields.|$|E

40|$|Cuff-occluded rate <b>of</b> <b>rise</b> <b>of</b> {{peripheral}} {{venous pressure}} {{has been proposed}} to reflect volume changes in experimental studies. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate changes in cuff-occluded rate <b>of</b> <b>rise</b> <b>of</b> peripheral venous pressure associated with fluid removal by haemodialysis in six adult patients with chronic renal failure on intermittent haemodialysis. Measurements were carried out before and after each haemodialysis session. The volume of fluid removed (indexed to body surface area) linearly correlated with changes in cuff-occluded rate <b>of</b> <b>rise</b> <b>of</b> peripheral venous pressure (r = 0. 84; r(2) =() 0. 70; p = 0. 037). Cuff-occluded rate <b>of</b> <b>rise</b> <b>of</b> peripheral venous pressure may be feasible for future clinical monitoring of individual fluid balance...|$|R
40|$|The global mean {{sea level}} (GMSL) changes derived from {{modelling}} do not match actual measurements of sea level {{and should not be}} trusted. Compilations of individual tide gauges of sufficient quality and length provide much more reliable information. The present work is a contribution towards {{a better understanding of the}} observed of sea levels in India and its relation to worldwide observations. The latest average relative rate <b>of</b> <b>rise</b> <b>of</b> worldwide sea levels from a compilation of 170 stations with more than 60 years of data returns an average relative rate <b>of</b> <b>rise</b> + 0. 25 mm/year. The individual rates <b>of</b> <b>rise</b> are about constant in between subsequent updates suggesting the absence of any acceleration. Observation in key sites suggests a similarly stable pattern. Along the coastline of India, the average rate <b>of</b> <b>rise</b> <b>of</b> sea level is + 1. 06 mm/year computed by considering the 11 longest tide gauges of average length 51 years. Shorter records may overrate the sea level rate <b>of</b> <b>rise</b> because <b>of</b> the local phasing of the quasi- 60 -year oscillation. In the longest records, the rates <b>of</b> <b>rise</b> are decreasing since 1955. The lack of any GPS monitoring of the vertical position of the tide gauge does not permit the determination of the absolute rates <b>of</b> <b>rise...</b>|$|R
40|$|It {{is shown}} that the sea level rate <b>of</b> <b>rise</b> is {{different}} in the two islands of Kwajalein and Majuro, located in the two atolls of Kwajalein and Majuro, in the Republic of the Marshall Islands. Kwajalein has a rate <b>of</b> <b>rise</b> <b>of</b> about 2 mm/year, up from a prior 1. 4 mm/year, while Majuro has a rate <b>of</b> <b>rise</b> exceeding 3. 6 mm/year about constant. The difference in the rates <b>of</b> <b>rises</b> and their recent changes are more likely explained by differential subsidy in space time {{at a higher rate}} especially in Kwajalein from the 2000 s than by global warming thermal expansion of the oceans...|$|R

5|$|Air {{breathing}} {{fish can}} be divided into obligate air breathers and facultative air breathers. Obligate air breathers, such as the African lungfish, must breathe air periodically or they suffocate. Facultative air breathers, such as the catfish Hypostomus plecostomus, only breathe air if they need to and will otherwise rely on their gills for oxygen. Most air breathing fish are facultative air breathers that avoid the energetic cost <b>of</b> <b>rising</b> to the surface and the fitness cost of exposure to surface predators.|$|E
40|$|A solar {{activity}} precursor technique of spotless event has been currently {{used to predict}} the strengths and the times <b>of</b> <b>rise</b> <b>of</b> the 11 -year coming cycles. This simple statistical method has been previously applied to predict the maximum amplitudes and the times <b>of</b> <b>rises</b> <b>of</b> cycles 22 and 23. The results obtained are successful for both cycles. A developed version of the suggested method was previously used to make an early forecast of the characteristic parameters of the cycle 24. In this work the preliminarily predicted parameters of the cycle 24 are checked using observed values of the spotless events. In addition, the developed method is also applied to forecast the maximum amplitude and time <b>of</b> <b>rise</b> <b>of</b> the 25 th solar cycle. The maximum Wolf number and time <b>of</b> <b>rise</b> <b>of</b> the latter cycle {{are found to be}} 118. 2 and 4. 0  years respectively...|$|R

5|$|Bilis and its {{associated}} flooding left over 400,000people homeless, and over 2million more had to be evacuated in the face <b>of</b> <b>rising</b> waters. Following the storm, the Red Cross Society of China provided food, blankets, and water purification kits to over 100,000 Hunan residents in mass evacuation shelters. The relief effort was complicated by an earthquake in Yunnan, as well as three more tropical cyclones: Typhoon Kaemi, Typhoon Prapiroon, and Typhoon Saomai. All of the storms were stronger than Bilis, and exacerbated flooding and other problems in the region.|$|E

5|$|Earnings {{management}} {{may involve}} exploiting {{opportunities to make}} accounting decisions that change the earnings figure reported on the financial statements. Accounting decisions can in turn affect earnings because they can influence the timing of transactions and the estimates used in financial reporting. For example, a comparatively small change in the estimates for uncollectible accounts can {{have a significant effect}} on net income, and a company using last-in, first-out accounting for inventories can increase net income in times <b>of</b> <b>rising</b> prices by delaying purchases to future periods.|$|E

5|$|Neck {{stiffness}} usually presents {{six hours}} after initial onset of SAH. Isolated dilation of a pupil {{and loss of}} the pupillary light reflex may reflect brain herniation as a result <b>of</b> <b>rising</b> intracranial pressure (pressure inside the skull).

This is known as Terson syndrome (occurring in 3–13 percent of cases) and is more common in more severe SAH.|$|E
