5|$|Following McCartney's {{marriage}} to Mills, he joined {{her in a}} campaign against land mines, becoming a patron of Adopt-A-Minefield. In 2006, the McCartneys travelled to Prince Edward Island to raise international awareness of seal hunting. The couple debated with Danny Williams, Newfoundland's then Premier, <b>on</b> <b>Larry</b> King Live, stating that fishermen should stop hunting seals and start seal-watching businesses instead. McCartney also supports the Make Poverty History campaign.|$|E
5|$|On March 3, 2006, Williams {{appeared}} <b>on</b> <b>Larry</b> King Live where Paul McCartney {{and then}} wife Heather Mills argued the seal hunt was inhumane because seal cubs were being clubbed to death. Williams said the annual hunt {{is supported by}} scientists, veterinarians and organizations like the UN and the World Wildlife Fund, and that 90% of seals are killed by bullet. Williams accused the McCartneys of being used by IFAW, Greenpeace and PETA to help them raise funds. He then invited the McCartneys to visit Newfoundland and Labrador.|$|E
5|$|Hud is a 1963 film {{directed}} by Martin Ritt and starring Paul Newman, Melvyn Douglas and Patricia Neal. It {{was produced by}} Ritt and Newman's recently founded company, Salem Productions, and was their first film for Paramount Pictures. Hud was filmed on location on the Texas Panhandle, including Claude, Texas. Its screenplay was by Irving Ravetch and Harriet Frank, Jr. and was based <b>on</b> <b>Larry</b> McMurtry's 1961 novel, Horseman, Pass By. The film's title character, Hud Bannon, was a minor character in the original screenplay but was reworked as the lead role. With its main character an antihero, Hud was later described as a revisionist Western.|$|E

5|$|In March 2006, Mills and McCartney {{travelled}} to Canada {{to bring}} attention to the country's annual seal hunt. Sponsored by the Humane Society of the United States, they complained that the hunt was inhumane, and called on the Canadian government {{to put an end}} to it. Their arrival on the floes sparked much attention in Newfoundland and Labrador, where 90 per cent of the sealers live. Mills and McCartney protested against seals being clubbed to death, pierced with boat hooks and sometimes skinned alive. Newfoundland and Labrador's Premier, Danny Williams, debated the issue with them <b>on</b> <b>Larry</b> King Live, the issue being that seals are no longer hunted that way, and have not been for a while. Mills joined a Viva! film team at a pig farm in Somerset, in February 2007, to publicise the use of restrictive farrowing crates, which are used for sows who are suckling piglets. A video of the investigation was made available on the Internet.|$|E
5|$|Runnels was {{originally}} a make-up artist for CNN from 1985 to 1991, {{where she worked}} <b>on</b> <b>Larry</b> King's make-up.

Runnels debuted in 1990 as Alexandra York, a laptop-carrying accountant who led an alliance known as the York Foundation, a group of wrestlers with finance-themed gimmicks. The York character was created over a lunch with Tony Schiavone, one of WCW's announcers. She worked at WCW for two years.|$|E
