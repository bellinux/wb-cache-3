Four minutes later, Lieutenant Colonel Timothy Duffy and Major Daniel Nash were {{scrambled}} and flew F-15 fighters out of the base heading toward New York City to intercept the plane. Conflicting reports say they departed somewhere between 8:46 and 8:52 and also at what speeds they flew (supersonic versus subsonic.) In the 2006 TV documentary , both Otis pilots were interviewed and <b>one</b> <b>spoke</b> about their speed being supersonic in their effort to intercept the hijacked airliner headed for New York.|$|E

A year later he relaunched it as full-time station Radio Kahungunu in Hastings, to increase grammatical and spoken Māori language fluency, and expose the language to homes where no <b>one</b> <b>spoke</b> it. Te Rito archived more than 2000 programme recordings, which he used to study and translate the tribe's distinctive dialect, teach courses on the local spoken and written language, and provide an international model for preserving dialects in other communities in Asia and the Pacific.|$|E
25|$|Earlier in the war, the Second Continental Congress promised {{officers}} {{they would}} receive a life pension of half-pay beginning on 21 October 1780. The army was well aware that Congress had {{made no effort to}} back up this promise. In January 1783, a committee of officers drew up a petition listing their grievances and Alexander McDougall presented it to Congress in company with Matthias Ogden and John Brooks. Differing from earlier petitions, this <b>one</b> <b>spoke</b> for the entire army, not just the officer corps. Behind the scenes, Washington wrote to members of Congress that the officers' claims were legitimate. Unfortunately, the Congress defeated a measure that would have given the officers full pay for five years as compensation for the promised pension.|$|E

500|$|James R. Doolittle of Wisconsin objected {{that the}} {{citizenship}} provision {{would not be}} sufficiently narrow to exclude American Indians from citizenship, and {{in an attempt to}} address this issue, he proposed to add a phrase taken from the Civil Rights Act—"excluding Indians not taxed". [...] Although most Senators agreed that birthright citizenship should not be extended to the Indians, a majority saw no need to clarify the issue, and Doolittle's proposal was voted down. [...] Upon its return to the House of Representatives, the proposed Fourteenth Amendment received little debate; no <b>one</b> <b>spoke</b> in opposition to the Senate's addition of the Citizenship Clause, and the complete proposed amendment was approved by the House on June 13, 1866, and declared to have been ratified on July 28, 1868.|$|E
500|$|The {{trial was}} held {{behind closed doors}} and the public was not {{informed}} of the results nor that legal proceedings had occurred until a few days later. Despite the outcome, when the matter was made public, it was accompanied with a warning from Khánh against neutralism. The public press release stated that Khánh's junta had taken a lenient approach to enhance [...] "the spirit of unity and the traditional comradeship in arms of the armed forces." [...] Some civilians in Khánh's cabinet were caught off-guard by the secret hearing and <b>one</b> <b>spoke</b> out, saying [...] "Letting them go like this removes the apparent justification for the whole Government's existence". The junta statement did not specifically charge anyone of neutralism but said that repetition of such activities could result in discharges from the military, implying that neutralist moves had occurred in the past. It warned of [...] "infliction of all the punishments reserved for military personnel who have committed the crime of treason against {{the people in the}} struggled against the Communists and neutralists." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{last two}} {{chapters}} feature Peshkin's {{commentary on the}} school in society, its tradeoffs and comparison with other total institutions and larger social movements, like the New Religious Right. He also compares the academy to public and parochial schools, wherein he finds public school students more politically tolerant and acceptant of religious pluralism. Peshkin's final reflections are written as a [...] "cost-benefit analysis" [...] of these Christian schools in the larger American society. In the last chapter, Peshkin contemplates how his Jewish identity is insulated within a pluralistic and secular society, and how he is fearful of absolutist [...] "imperious, implacable logic" [...] and [...] "zeal for conversion and exclusivism". He recounted that while the school spoke derogatorily of non-fundamentalists and non-Christians, no <b>one</b> <b>spoke</b> of the American religious plurality that permitted this. In response to the encroaching state, fundamentalists feel that their political conviction should mirror that of their religion. Peshkin views the school as schismatic in a larger society for promoting intolerance towards fellow Americans. He also praised traits of the schools including its community, dedicated teachers, and attractive image. At the time of print, Christian schools like Bethany were outpacing the growth of other schools. In 1989, Christian schools comprised about 20% of private school enrollment—around 700,000 students.|$|E

500|$|The new {{qualifying}} format was criticised {{immediately after}} the end of the session by pundits, drivers and team personnel alike. Sky Sports commentator Martin Brundle called for a swift revision of the rules, saying the procedure was [...] "not acceptable" [...] and calling for it to be abandoned before the next race. Mercedes's executive director Toto Wolff and former driver Johnny Herbert were equally critical, describing it as [...] "rubbish" [...] and [...] "embarrassing". Red Bull team director Christian Horner was apologetic, describing the format as [...] " [...] good for Formula One." [...] Niki Lauda, non-executive chairman at Mercedes, was in agreement, calling it [...] "a big mistake." [...] Particular criticism was aimed at the fact that many drivers did not get enough time to improve on their lap times, seeing many getting out of their cockpits while still technically in contention. [...] World Champion Damon Hill observed that pole-sitter Hamilton [...] "could have waved his own chequered flag [...] with four minutes still to go." [...] Nico Rosberg acknowledged that it had [...] "not worked", while Sebastian Vettel was equally critical, describing it as [...] "the wrong way to go." [...] Lewis Hamilton joined the criticism but acknowledged the attempt to revitalise the format. Bernie Ecclestone, the commercial rights holder of Formula <b>One,</b> <b>spoke</b> out against the format as well, declaring it to be [...] "pretty crap". On the day of the race, the teams of Formula 1 voted a proposal to go back to the qualifying format as it had been in previous seasons, which was rejected by the FIA's F1 Commission.|$|E
500|$|The main {{recording}} {{sessions for}} Closing Time {{took place at}} Sunset Sound Recorders in Hollywood, California—where Buffalo Springfield, Joni Mitchell, Neil Young and The Doors had previously recorded—during spring 1972. Yester fronted production and the sessions were held almost immediately after Waits' record deal, and were described [...] "quick and efficient." [...] Waits was [...] "nervous, but confident enough in his own material" [...] during {{the beginning of the}} sessions; however, as the sessions progressed, Waits and Yester [...] "were pulling against each other" [...] over the direction which the album would take, with Waits wanting a jazz-laden record and Yester more focused on producing a folk-based album. Despite this, Waits was [...] "absolutely communicative" [...] with his fellow musicians, articulating his direction and using metaphors to describe how he wanted the songs to sound. The sessions took a total of ten days, with the first two days focusing on [...] "getting used to [...]" [...] Both Waits and Yester wanted to record during the evening, but as no slots were available, it was recorded through the morning and afternoon [...] "from ten to five every day." [...] During the recording of [...] "Ol' '55", Seiter contributed backing vocals and [...] "came up with a perfect harmony line that started faintly before the chorus even began." [...] The sessions concluded with a total of nine songs completed. Though unsatisfied with the amount of songs, a second recording session was arranged the following week in United Western Recorders. The final session for Closing Time began the following Sunday, with guest musicians Arni Egilsson replacing Plummer and Jesse Erlich performing cello. The title track, [...] "Closing Time", was the only song recorded in full, and Yester later described the session as [...] "the most magical session I've ever been involved with. At the end of it, no <b>one</b> <b>spoke</b> for what felt like five minutes, either in the booth or out in the room. No one budged. Nobody wanted the moment to end." [...] String overdubs were later cut for [...] "Martha" [...] and [...] "Grapefruit Moon" [...] the following day. The final recordings were mixed and mastered at Wally Heider Studios in San Francisco.|$|E

After {{the fall of the}} empire and the {{transformation}} of spoken Latin into the early Romance languages the only representative of the Latin language was written Latin, which became known as classicus, [...] "classy" [...] Latin. The original opposition was between formal or implied good Latin and informal or Vulgar Latin. The spoken/written dichotomy is entirely philological.|$|E

2500|$|The {{following}} day, {{a neighbor}} of Casolaro's and long-time housekeeper, Olga, helped Casolaro pack a black leather tote.

Casolaro said he was leaving for several days to visit Martinsburg, West Virginia, to meet a source who promised to provide an important missing piece to his story. This {{was the last time}} Olga saw him. Olga told The Village Voice that she answered several threatening telephone calls at Casolaro's home that day. She said that one man called at about 9:00a.m. and said, [...] "I will cut his body and throw it to the sharks". Less than an hour later, a different man said: [...] "Drop dead." [...] There was a third call, but Olga remembered only that no <b>one</b> <b>spoke</b> and that she heard music as though a radio were playing. A fourth call was the same as the third, and a fifth call, this one silent, came later that night.|$|E
2500|$|Thus {{there was}} a long history to {{conflicts}} between the Moray gentry and the clans of the West Coast, but some historians present Harlaw as a clash between the Scottish Highlands and Lowlands, or between Celt and Teuton. John Hill Burton (1809–1881) claimed that in Lowland Scotland Harlaw [...] "was felt as a more memorable deliverance even than that of Bannockburn. What it was to be subject to England the country knew and disliked; to be subdued by their savage enemies of the mountains opened to them sources of terror of unknown character and extent". However Sir Robert Rait (1874–1936) detected no racial antipathy in the two contemporary accounts of the Scotichronicon and the Book of Pluscarden, and viewed Harlaw not as a conflict between races, but between two groups of Scots of which <b>one</b> <b>spoke</b> Scots and the other Gaelic. Rait mentions Buchanan's view that it was simply a raid for plunder.|$|E

2500|$|In 1917, {{the year}} the United States {{declared}} war on Germany, half of the city's residents could speak German, and many spoke only German. The community had organized German schools and frequently held religious services in German at many churches. In 1918, the government required German men who had not become naturalized citizens to register as alien enemies. The New York Times reported, [...] "When <b>one</b> <b>spoke</b> of going 'over the Rhine,' as the canal was called, he meant that he was disappearing into a realm where all English was left behind." [...] The city passed an ordinance to change all German street names in the city. In Over-the-Rhine, Bremen Street was changed to Republic and Hanover became Yukon Street. As happened in some {{other areas of the}} country with numerous ethnic Germans, the state closed German-language schools, dismissed teachers of German, and banned German-language classes from all public schools. The Public Library of Cincinnati and Hamilton County withdrew all German books from its shelves. Many German Americans anglicized their names out of fear of persecution. Some businesses with German names changed them to survive the anti-war sentiment. Cincinnati's German heritage continued to be suppressed until after World War II, a war in which Germany again was opposed by the United States.|$|E
