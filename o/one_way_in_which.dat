5|$|Physiological enzyme {{inhibition}} {{can also be}} produced by specific protein inhibitors. This mechanism occurs in the pancreas, which synthesises many digestive precursor enzymes known as zymogens. Many of these are activated by the trypsin protease, so {{it is important to}} inhibit the activity of trypsin in the pancreas to prevent the organ from digesting itself. <b>One</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the activity of trypsin is controlled is the production of a specific and potent trypsin inhibitor protein in the pancreas. This inhibitor binds tightly to trypsin, preventing the trypsin activity that would otherwise be detrimental to the organ. Although the trypsin inhibitor is a protein, it avoids being hydrolysed as a substrate by the protease by excluding water from trypsin's active site and destabilising the transition state. Other examples of physiological enzyme inhibitor proteins include the barstar inhibitor of the bacterial ribonuclease barnase and the inhibitors of protein phosphatases.|$|E

25|$|Use of the {{empirical}} CFE equation (42), and {{the measurement of}} κ, may be of particular use for non-metals. Strictly, Fowler-Nordheim-type equations apply only to emission from the conduction band of bulk crystalline solids. However, empirical equations of form (42) should apply to all materials (though, conceivably, modification might be needed for very sharp emitters). It seems very likely that <b>one</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> CFE equations for newer materials may differ from Fowler-Nordheim-type equations is that these CFE equations may have a different power of F (or V) in their pre-exponentials. Measurements of κ might provide some experimental indication of this.|$|E

A perfect crystal is one in which the internal lattice structure is the same at all times; in other words, it is fixed and non-moving, and does not have rotational or vibrational energy.

Therefore, reliance on political stereotypes is one way to use their knowledge about the sources when making judgments, and the use of metacognitive knowledge gains importance.

25|$|In {{order to}} {{maintain}} high-quality performance, some musicians take chemical substances. Some musicians take drugs or alcohol {{to deal with the}} stress of performing. As a group they have a higher rate of substance abuse. The most common chemical substance which is abused by pop musicians is cocaine, because of its neurological effects. Stimulants like cocaine increase alertness and cause feelings of euphoria, and can therefore make the performer feel as though they in some ways ‘own the stage’. <b>One</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> substance abuse is harmful for a performer (musicians especially) is if the substance being abused is aspirated. The lungs are an important organ used by singers, and addiction to cigarettes may seriously harm the quality of their performance. Smoking causes harm to alveoli, which are responsible for absorbing oxygen.|$|E
25|$|<b>One</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> caves retain low {{temperatures}} {{is through a}} constant input of cold air from outside the cave circulating in. Typically, the caves supporting the largest Indiana bat populations have multiple entrances that allow cool air from outside the cave to come in, creating a circulation of fresh cooled air. Gates that are meant to keep vandals out of caves have altered the temperature and airflow of hibernacula, resulting in population declines of Indiana bats at many major hibernacula throughout their range. Removing or modifying gates {{at some of these}} have given these populations a chance to rebound. Also, the bats seem to prefer a relative humidity of 74% to 100%, although it is uncommon for the air to be saturated. Relative humidities of only 50.4% have also been recorded.|$|E
25|$|Liverpool ONE is a shopping, {{residential}} and leisure complex in Liverpool, England. The project involved the redevelopment of 42 acres (170,000 m²) of underutilised land in Liverpool city centre. It is a retail led development, anchored by department stores Debenhams and John Lewis, with additional elements including leisure facilities (anchored by a 14-screen Odeon cinema and 36-hole adventure golf centre), apartments, offices, {{public open space}} and transport improvements. The completion of Liverpool ONE has significantly boosted the local economy as well as lifted Liverpool into the top five most popular retail destinations in the UK. Liverpool ONE is the largest open air shopping centre in the United Kingdom and the 5th largest overall. Each store was created by a different architect, thereby leading to quite stark differences between some buildings, and this is <b>one</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> Liverpool ONE differentiates itself from other shopping centres.|$|E

25|$|When {{a coastal}} {{environment}} is in sediment deficit, anthropogenic sediment nourishment is <b>one</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> a balanced sedimentary budget can be maintained. This type of coastal erosion management {{has been adopted}} {{all over the world}} in order to preserve and protect. An example of this is at Mount Maunganui beach in the North Island of New Zealand which had been experiencing erosion, resulting in coastal dune retreat of almost 20 metres. When ongoing dredging {{at the entrance to the}} Tauranga Harbour began, it was decided that the sediment removed would be used to re-nourish the Mt. Manganui beach. The sediment was deposited in the nearshore zone promoting beach accretion by offshore berm emplacement. Results show that most of the 80,000m3 of sediment added to the nearshore zone made it to ashore to re-nourish the beach and even out the past sediment deficit. Nourishment of a coast can be regarded as a fast fix option to reversing a sediment deficit; however, it is important that nourishment is on-going in order to ensure the sedimentary budget remains balanced.|$|E
25|$|The first {{spectrum}} of SN 2002cx was obtained with FLWO on 2002 May 17, 4 days before B-band max.

Si II λ6355 though is not apparent in SN 2002cx at this point, and it has very weak Ca II H & K lines suggesting that SN 2002cx is similar to SN 1991T which also lacked such lines. This spectrum for SN 2002cx has a low expansion velocity measuring only ~6400km s−1. This marked <b>one</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> it was different from SN 1997br, as SN 1997br's expansion velocity was ~10,400km s−1 {{at the same point}} relative to its own B-band maximum.

25|$|Due {{to similar}} {{favourable}} climatic conditions, Eucalyptus plantations have often replaced oak woodlands, {{for example in}} California, Spain and Portugal. The resulting monocultures have raised concerns about loss of biological diversity, through loss of acorns that mammals and birds feed on, absence of hollows that in oak trees provide shelter and nesting sites for birds and small mammals and for bee colonies, as well as lack of downed trees in managed plantations. A study {{of the relationship between}} birds and eucalyptus in the San Francisco Bay Area found that bird diversity was similar in native forest vs. eucalyptus forest but the species were different. <b>One</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the avifauna changes is that cavity nesting birds including woodpeckers, owls, chickadees, wood ducks, etc. are depauperate in eucalyptus groves because the decay-resistant wood of these trees prevents cavity formation by decay or excavation. Also those bird species that glean insects from foliage, such as warblers and vireos, have population declines when eucalyptus replace oak forest. Birds that do well in eucalyptus groves in California like tall vertical habitat like herons and egrets (possibly because redwood trees are less available), or have longer bills, which {{may play a role in}} preventing their nostrils from being clogged by eucalyptus resin/pitch. The Point Reyes Bird Observatory observes that sometimes short-billed birds like the ruby-crowned kinglet are found dead beneath eucalyptus trees with their nostrils clogged with pitch.|$|E
