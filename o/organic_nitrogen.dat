A uniform design method was thus employed in this study to further optimize H 2 O 2 dosage by investigating effects of pH and H 2 O 2 dosage {{on the amount of}} H 2 O 2 residue and releases of <b>organics,</b> <b>nitrogen,</b> and phosphorus. A regression model was established with pH and H 2 O 2 dosage as the independent variables, and H 2 O 2 residue and releases of <b>organics,</b> <b>nitrogen,</b> and phosphorus as the dependent variables. In the optimized microwave-H 2 O 2 process, the pH value of the sludge was firstly adjusted to 11. 0, then the sludge was heated to 80 degrees C and H 2 O 2 was dosed at a H 2 O 2 :mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) ratio of 0. 2, and the sludge was finally heated to 100 degrees C by microwave irradiation. Compared to the microwave-H 2 O 2 process without optimization, the H 2 O 2 dosage and the utilization rate of H 2 O 2 in the optimized microwave-H 2 O 2 process were reduced by 80 % and greatly improved by 3. 87 times, respectively, when the H 2 O 2 :MLSS dosage ratio was decreased from 1. 0 to 0. 2, resulting in nearly the same release rate of soluble chemical oxygen demand in the microwave-H 2 O 2 process without optimization at H 2 O 2 :MISS ratio of 0. 5...|$|R

25|$|Nitrogen {{is present}} in the {{environment}} {{in a wide variety of}} chemical forms including <b>organic</b> <b>nitrogen,</b> Ammonium (NH), nitrite (NO), nitrate (NO), nitrous oxide (N2O), Nitric oxide (NO) or inorganic nitrogen gas (N2). <b>Organic</b> <b>nitrogen</b> may be in the form of a living organism, humus or in the intermediate products of organic matter decomposition. The processes of the nitrogen cycle transform nitrogen from one form to another. Many of those processes are carried out by microbes, either in their effort to harvest energy or to accumulate nitrogen in a form needed for their growth. For example, the nitrogenous wastes in animal urine are broken down by nitrifying bacteria in the soil to be used as new. The diagram besides shows how these processes fit together to form the nitrogen cycle.|$|E
25|$|The {{first report}} of {{mycorrhizal}} inhibition of decomposition was in 1971 and came from ectomycorrhizal Pinus radiatia plantations in New Zealand. Authors show that excluding roots and mycorrhizal fungi resulted in net carbon loss, {{and that the}} result could not be explained by soil disturbance effects. The mechanism presented is that ectomycorrhizal fungi can compete with free-living decomposers for nutrients, and thereby limit the rate of total decomposition. Since then {{there have been several}} other reports of ectomycorrhizal fungi reducing activity and decomposition rates of free-living decomposers and thereby increasing soil carbon storage. A theoretical ecosystem model recently demonstrated that greater access to <b>organic</b> <b>nitrogen</b> by mycorrhizal fungi should slow decomposition of soil carbon by free-living decomposers by inducing nutrient limitation. It should be noted however, that Koide and Wu (2003) made a strong case that the effect of ectomycorrhizal fungi on reducing decomposition may {{have more to do with}} competition for soil water than soil nutrients.|$|E
25|$|Chemical {{forms of}} {{nitrogen}} {{are most often}} of concern with regard to eutrophication, because plants have high nitrogen requirements so that additions of nitrogen compounds will stimulate plant growth. Nitrogen is not readily available in soil because N2, a gaseous form of nitrogen, is very stable and unavailable directly to higher plants. Terrestrial ecosystems rely on microbial nitrogen fixation to convert N2 into other forms such as nitrates. However, {{there is a limit}} to how much nitrogen can be utilized. Ecosystems receiving more nitrogen than the plants require are called nitrogen-saturated. Saturated terrestrial ecosystems then can contribute both inorganic and <b>organic</b> <b>nitrogen</b> to freshwater, coastal, and marine eutrophication, where nitrogen is also typically a limiting nutrient. This is also the case with increased levels of phosphorus. However, because phosphorus is generally much less soluble than nitrogen, it is leached from the soil at a much slower rate than nitrogen. Consequently, phosphorus is much more important as a limiting nutrient in aquatic systems.|$|E

A way of jointly treating and exploiting these increasing wastes jointly is the composting. Composting makes it possible to reduce volumes and the masses of wastes all while developing them in a product usable like organic soil enrichment. In this work, the composting process of an industrial sewage sludge composting plant was monitored to study the evolution of different physico-chemical parameters (temperature, moisture, pH, organic carbon, <b>organic</b> and inorganic <b>nitrogen,</b> <b>organic</b> carbon/organic <b>nitrogen</b> ratio, humic substances) and biochemical parameters (soluble fraction, hemicellulose, cellulose, lignin).

2500|$|The warmer {{atmospheric}} temperatures observed {{over the}} past decades are expected {{to lead to a}} more vigorous hydrological cycle, including more extreme rainfall events. [...] Erosion and soil degradation is more likely to occur. [...] Soil fertility would also be affected by global warming. However, because the ratio of soil organic carbon to nitrogen is mediated by soil biology such that it maintains a narrow range, a doubling of soil organic carbon is likely to imply a doubling in the storage of nitrogen in soils as <b>organic</b> <b>nitrogen,</b> thus providing higher available nutrient levels for plants, supporting higher yield potential. The demand for imported fertilizer nitrogen could decrease, and provide the opportunity for changing costly fertilisation strategies.|$|E
2500|$|The {{nitrogen}} cycle {{is an important}} process in the ocean as well. While the overall cycle is similar, there are different players and modes of transfer for nitrogen in the ocean. Nitrogen enters the water through the precipitation, runoff, or as N2 from the atmosphere. Nitrogen cannot be utilized by phytoplankton as N2 so it must undergo nitrogen fixation which is performed predominately by cyanobacteria. Without supplies of fixed nitrogen entering the marine cycle, the fixed nitrogen would be used up in about 2000 years. Phytoplankton need nitrogen in biologically available forms for the initial synthesis of organic matter. [...] Ammonia and urea are released into the water by excretion from plankton. Nitrogen sources are removed from the euphotic zone by the downward movement of the organic matter. This can occur from sinking of phytoplankton, vertical mixing, or sinking of waste of vertical migrators. The sinking results in ammonia being introduced at lower depths below the euphotic zone. Bacteria are able to convert ammonia to nitrite and nitrate but they are inhibited by light so this must occur below the euphotic zone. Ammonification or Mineralization is performed by bacteria to convert <b>organic</b> <b>nitrogen</b> to ammonia. Nitrification can then occur to convert the ammonium to nitrite and nitrate. Nitrate can {{be returned to the}} euphotic zone by vertical mixing and upwelling where it can be taken up by phytoplankton to continue the cycle. N2 can be returned to the atmosphere through denitrification.|$|E

This article re-viewed the recent advances from the research on prediction methods of pollutants yield in manure from intensive animal husbandry. Pollutant generation coefficients and prediction models, including models based on composition of dietary, {{physical and chemical properties}} and nearinfrared spectrum analysis, were summarized respectively. Pollutant generation coefficients were average level of major pollutants in livestock and poultry manure, which were more precise at the macro level and were used to predict the amount of pollutants. There were three predic-tion model systems discussed. First, prediction models based on composition of dietary were less accurate than others but were more useful for farms where could get the basic data of the diet to predict rapidly the concentrations of <b>organic</b> matter, <b>nitrogen</b> and phosphorus of manure for the treatment and utilization of manure. Second, prediction models based on physical and chemical properties of manure were more precise than the first one, which could provide scientific basis for developing instruments determined concentrations of <b>organic</b> matter, <b>nitrogen</b> and phosphorus rapidly. Third, prediction models based on near-infrared spectrum analysis were the most accurate. Those models were likely to finish the on-line analysis of concentrations of <b>organic</b> matter, <b>nitrogen,</b> phosphorus of livestock and poultry manure in the laboratory. Finally, future research on prediction methods was proposed to estimate the production of major pollutants in manure from large-scale livestock and poultry farms in China...|$|R
