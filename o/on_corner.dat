5|$|The Cardinals won the toss {{and decided}} to receive. On the opening kickoff, David Johnson {{returned}} it 108 yards for a touchdown. After both teams exchanged punts, receiver Josh Bellamy caught a 48-yard touchdown pass from Cutler, his first career touchdown reception. On the Cardinals' ensuing drive, the Bears forced fourth down after Palmer's pass to Johnson went out of bounds, but was reversed after it was determined he had a knee and elbow inbounds. Two plays later, Arizona gained 42 yards on Palmer's pass to John Brown, added with a defensive pass interference penalty <b>on</b> <b>corner</b> Kyle Fuller, placing the offense at the Bears' 11-yard line. After two plays, Palmer threw a six-yard touchdown pass to Jaron Brown. On Chicago's next drive, runningback Jeremy Langford scored on a one-yard dive. However, the Cardinals scored two touchdowns in 52 seconds: after Larry Fitzgerald's eight-yard touchdown reception, Tony Jefferson intercepted Cutler, scoring on the 26-yard return. Cutler tried to dive to tackle Jefferson, but landed on his right shoulder and suffered a hamstring injury; Jimmy Clausen replaced Cutler {{for the rest of}} the game. Despite losing Cutler, the Bears were able to score three points with Robbie Gould's 40-yard field goal, and got the ball back on the next drive with linebacker Jared Allen intercepting Palmer's pass intended for J. J. Nelson on the first play; however, the Bears had to settle for Gould's 23-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Clausen's pass for Marquess Wilson was intercepted by Patrick Peterson, with the Cardinals capitalizing on the turnover with Palmer's 28-yard touchdown pass to Fitzgerald. After the Bears punted, Arizona increased the score with Johnson's 13-yard touchdown run. Gould eventually kicked a 51-yard field goal to make the score 42–23, but Fitzgerald caught another touchdown pass, this time of nine yards, to widen the margin by 25 points, though Chandler Catanzaro's extra point was wide left.|$|E

25|$|The Cougars {{traveled}} to Chicago {{to face the}} Big Ten's Northwestern at UIC's Flames Field due to construction at NU's Evanston campus. As at Butler, Jambga opened the scoring, this time, going on-on-two versus the Wildcat defense before putting the ball past the keeper at the far post. The Cougars fairly well dominated the offense, outshooting the Wildcats 12-8 and 8-3 <b>on</b> <b>corner</b> kicks, despite having 23 fouls called on them versus only 10 on the hosts. Lane made the score 2-0 with his first goal {{of the season in}} the 57th minute, while the SIUE defense limited the NU offense to only 2 shots on goal. In the 69th minute, Roberge headed a pass from Keliher past Dal Santo on a throw-in set piece to pull Northwestern to within one, but the Cougar defense shut the Wildcats down {{the rest of the way}} to preserve the win.|$|E

25|$|As for {{architecture}} in the city, both {{the body of}} architectural styles {{as well as the}} prevalent way of living have experienced significant changes in the 20th century. While having survived relatively intact throughout the years of war 1939–1945, the city faced increasing changes in the 1950s and 1960s due to rising demands for apartments, the eagerness to rebuild, and most of all the new development of infrastructure (especially increased automobile traffic). The wooden one- to two-story houses that were the dominant mode of building in the city were mostly demolished in the 1950s and 1960s to both enable more efficient building and to ease vehicle traffic. This resulted in the destruction of buildings that were, in later decades, seen as beautiful and worth saving. Some individual buildings remain controversial to this day {{when it comes to their}} demolition in the decades after the war. For example, the building of Hotel Phoenix that stood <b>on</b> <b>corner</b> of the Market Square was torn down to make way for a large, multistory apartment building in 1959. The building was significant both for its location and history: having stood on one of the most valuable lots in the city center since 1878, the building had, for example, served as the first main building of the University of Turku. Other buildings whose demolition was seen as scandalous, either already at the time of action or proved to be so in later years, include The Nobel House (subject to the very first photograph ever taken in Finland) and the building of Old Hotel Börs which was built in jugendstil in 1909 by Frithiof Strandell.|$|E

2500|$|On a Sunday {{night in}} Winston-Salem, North Carolina, the Cougars {{challenged}} the #2 ranked Wake Forest Demon Deacons the tournament's #2 and highest remaining seed. Wake ranked #10 in Division I in shots {{per game and}} came out shooting. In only the 3rd minute, the Deacons' top scorer passed from the end line to their #2 scorer, Bakero, who blasted {{the ball into the}} net from 9 yards in front. On the Cougars' lone corner kick of the game, both Ebbesen and his shot on goal were knocked down by the Wake keeper, but Ledbetter got to the rebound and netted [...] it to tie the score. SIUE looked about {{to take the lead in}} the 51st minute on a Jambga breakaway, but the Deacons' keeper, Cases Mundet, stayed with the pass to Ebbesen and blocked his point-blank shot. After repeated stops and saves by the Cougar defense, in the 72nd minute, it was again Bakero who redirected a shot that Dal Santo was ready to stop and scored the game winner. Although SIUE looked to be dominated in the statistics, out-shot 24–6 and bested <b>on</b> <b>corner</b> kicks 9–1, Wake Forest knew they had been in a fight; [...] "“I give SIUE credit." [...] said Wake's coach Muuss. [...] "They were blocking shots, battling."

6000|$|... 16. I am {{sure that}} all of you must readily {{acknowledge}} the charm which is imparted to any landscape {{by the presence of}} cottages; and you must over and over again have paused at the wicket gate of some cottage garden, delighted by the simple beauty of the honeysuckle porch and latticed window. Has it ever occurred to you to ask the question, what effect the cottage would have upon your feelings if it had no roof? no visible roof, I mean;--if instead of the thatched slope, in which the little upper windows are buried deep, as in a nest of straw--or the rough shelter of its mountain shales--or warm coloring of russet tiles--there were nothing but a flat leaden top to it, making it look like a large packing-case with windows in it? I don't think the rarity of such a sight would make you feel it to be beautiful; on the contrary, if you think over the matter, you will find that you actually do owe, and ought to owe, a great part of your pleasure in all cottage scenery, and in all the inexhaustible imagery of literature which is founded upon it, to the conspicuousness of the cottage roof--to the subordination of the cottage itself to its covering, which leaves, in nine cases out of ten, really more roof than anything else. It is, indeed, not so much the whitewashed walls--nor the flowery garden--nor the rude fragments of stones set for steps at the door--nor any other picturesqueness of the building which interest you, so much as the gray bank of its heavy eaves, deep-cushioned with green moss and golden stone-crop. And there is a profound, yet evident, reason for this feeling. The very soul of the cottage--the essence and meaning of it--are in its roof; it is that, mainly, wherein consists its shelter; that, wherein it differs most completely from a cleft in rocks or bower in woods. It is in its thick impenetrable coverlet of close thatch that its whole heart and hospitality are concentrated. Consider the difference, in sound, of the expressions [...] "beneath my roof" [...] and [...] "within my walls,"--consider whether you would be best sheltered, in a shed, with a stout roof sustained <b>on</b> <b>corner</b> posts, or in an inclosure of four walls without a roof at all,--and you will quickly see how important a part of the cottage the roof must always be to the mind {{as well as to the}} eye, and how, from seeing it, the greatest part of our pleasure must continually arise.|$|E
