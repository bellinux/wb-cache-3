50|$|The first <b>OBO</b> <b>carrier</b> was Naess Norseman, {{built at}} A. G. Weser {{for the company}} Norness Shipping, {{controlled}} by the Norwegian shipowner Erling Dekke Næss. Næss was instrumental in conceiving the new type of vessel, together with his chief naval architect Thoralf Magnus Karlsen. Naess Norseman was delivered in November 1965 and was 250 m long with a beam of 31.6 m, a draft of 13.5 m, and a gross register tonnage of 37,965 tonnes.|$|E
50|$|Erling Dekke Næss, (5 September 1901 - 7 February 1993) was a Norwegian {{shipowner}} and businessman. Brother of philosopher Arne Dekke Næss, {{his nephew}} was the mountaineer and businessman Arne Næss Jr. Best {{known for his}} early adoption of flags of convenience, Næss was Deputy Head of Nortraship's New York office from 1942 to 1946. Næss was the initiator behind the <b>OBO</b> <b>carrier.</b> He is also credited as proposing the very successful Norwegian International Ship Register, which allowed Norwegian shipowners to compete {{on an equal footing}} with flags of convenience.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>OBO</b> <b>carrier</b> {{quickly became}} popular among {{shipowners}} {{around the world}} and as of today several hundreds of this type of vessel have been built. The ship type had its glory days in the early 1970s. In the 1980s, {{it became clear that the}} type required more maintenance than other vessels. Also, it was expensive to [...] "switch" [...] from wet to dry cargoes, and it took valuable time. If you had carried oil, you could switch to carrying ore or other dirty bulk cargoes, but not grain or other clean bulk cargoes. As the 1970s-built OBO vessels become older, most of them were used either as pure tankers or as pure ore carriers.|$|E
50|$|Frontline Ltd. is the world's {{largest oil}} tanker {{shipping}} company, based in Hamilton, Bermuda {{and controlled by}} John Fredriksen. Its primary business is transporting crude oil. As of 2008 the company {{had one of the}} world's largest tanker fleets consisting of VLCC, Suezmax and Suezmax <b>OBO</b> <b>carriers</b> (82 tankers in total with 18 more on order).|$|R
5000|$|In 1962 Næss {{learned that}} the P&O had ordered four bulk carriers, each of around [...] Næss {{knew that this was}} a new area for P&O and {{arranged}} a meeting with the chairman, Sir Donald F. Anderson, whom he knew well from his Nortraship days. Næss proposed that the two companies should cooperate and pool their vessels into one joint owned company. P&O found the idea attractive and Associated Bulk Carriers Ltd. was established on 8 April 1964. The joint company was a huge success and by 1970 ABC contained 36 vessels with a total of [...] Part of the success was that Næss was able to persuade the more conservative P&O to order a number of <b>OBO</b> <b>carriers,</b> thus adding flexibility to the concept.|$|R
50|$|OBO-carriers {{are today}} not {{as common as}} they were in the 1970-1980s. This is due to investors seeking assets that are easily valued, whilst the value of the OBO is only {{appreciated}} by those operating them. With few of them being ordered after the 1980s, most are time-expired and no longer exist. Some ship-owners continued to support the OBO-concept and its trading flexibility. SKS, part of the Kristian Gerhard Jebsen Group, is today operating the largest OBO-fleet in the world consisting of 10 <b>OBO</b> <b>carriers.</b> The latest obo-vessel in the fleet, SKS Mersey, was delivered in 2003 from Hyundai Heavy Industries. The design of these vessels has been significantly improved compared to the vessels made in the seventies and all problems which were related to the OBO-concept - including many that were common amongst tankers at that time - have been dealt with.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{behavior}} of shipping freight rate by using the freight index as an proxy variable. A proxy variable {{is the one that}} is a substitute to the intended one because it is difficult to obtain. It was found that a seasonal pattern in the freight rate exists, but no specific estimated pattern of the seasonal variation was found. Generally, tramp freight rates rise above average level from February or March to June or July, and from September or October to December or January. The tanker freight rate, which differs from the tramp freight rate, has only one peak season; it rises above its average from September or October, reaches its peak in December, then falls below average in January or February until reaching its trough in April. Interestingly, when the tramp freight rate rises above its average, from February or March to June or July, the tanker freight rate falls below its average. This might suggest that the owners of the <b>OBOs</b> (Ore/Bulk/Oil <b>Carriers)</b> may take advantage of this phenomenon by switching their vessels between the two markets during that period...|$|R
