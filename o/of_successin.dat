40|$|The {{control of}} genetic {{resistance}} to the anomaly reddish wilting in cotton was studied using diallel crosses, bythe method of Hayman, and also by specific designs for analyses of means and variances, by the method of Mather and Jinks. Results indicated that the resistance to this anomaly is predominantly due to additive effects, based on the action of three tofour genes. The mode of gene action and good heritability level of the factors concerned indicated a high probability <b>of</b> <b>successin</b> the selection for resistance to this anomaly...|$|E

50|$|Universities in Britain {{have complained}} that the {{increasing}} number of A grades awarded makes it hard to distinguish between students at {{the upper end of the}} ability spectrum. The C grade was originally intended to represent the average ability, and students typically required 60% or higher across all assessments to attain it; however, the average result is now at the lower end of the B grade. Many universities have introduced their own entrance tests such as the BMAT and LNAT for specific courses, or conduct interviews to select applicants. In addition, the head of admissions at the University of Cambridge outlined changes he believed should be made to the current system, particularly the use of the Advanced Extension Awards, a more challenging qualification based on the more advanced content of the A-level syllabus. More universities have wanted to see applicants' individual module results to see how comfortably they have achieved their result due to fears that the A-level might not offer an accurate test of ability, or that it is a good prediction <b>of</b> future academic <b>success.In</b> 2007, allegations that students had been given lower marks than they deserved in order to fix overall results and make the pass rate seem lower than it had been in previous years were raised. The Tomlinson Inquiry was set up to ascertain whether this was an underhand to disprove that A levels were becoming too easy. As a result, some papers were re-marked but only 1,220 A level and 733 AS-level students saw an improvement to their results.|$|R
