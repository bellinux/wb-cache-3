5|$|In {{the period}} of French {{intervention}} in the 1540s and 1550s, at the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rough</b> Wooing, Scotland was given a defended border {{of a series of}} earthwork forts and additions to existing castles. These included the erection of single bastions at Edinburgh, Stirling and Dunbar.|$|E
5|$|Roslin {{was more}} {{severely}} {{damaged by the}} Earl of Hertford, who burned the castle during the War <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rough</b> Wooing in 1544. The keep was almost totally destroyed, although its one remaining ruined wall can still be seen.|$|E

Darwaza stresses a close connection between the Quran and the biography of the Muhammad (sira) and states that the Quran fully reflects various stages between the Quran and the career of Muhammad. He also emphasizes that both the angels and the jinn are spoken in the Quran not for their own sake, but to reinforce Muhammad's missions and goals.|$|E

5|$|In the 19th and 20th centuries, Indigenous Australian men played {{significant}} {{roles as}} stockmen in the Australian pastoral industry, and as entertainers participating in competitive demonstrations of stockmen's skills, {{referred to as}} rough riding. Dodd worked as a stockman, horse breaker and rodeo rider prior to and during his acting career, including a period working for rider and entertainer Smoky Dawson. He was a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rough</b> Riders Association, and gave exhibition rides at the Calgary Stampede in 1964.|$|E
5|$|The nuclear envelope, {{otherwise}} known as nuclear membrane, consists of two cellular membranes, an inner and an outer membrane, arranged {{parallel to one another}} and separated by 10 to 50 nanometres (nm). The nuclear envelope completely encloses the nucleus and separates the cell's genetic material from the surrounding cytoplasm, serving as a barrier to prevent macromolecules from diffusing freely between the nucleoplasm and the cytoplasm. The outer nuclear membrane is continuous with the membrane <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rough</b> endoplasmic reticulum (RER), and is similarly studded with ribosomes. The space between the membranes is called the perinuclear space and is continuous with the RER lumen.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} a castle on the site since the early 14th century, when the Sinclair family, Earls of Caithness and Barons of Roslin, {{fortified}} the site, although the present ruins are of slightly later date. Following destruction during the War <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rough</b> Wooing of 1544, the castle was rebuilt. This structure, built into the cliffs of Roslin Glen, has remained at least partially habitable ever since. The castle is accessed via a high bridge, which replaced an earlier drawbridge. Roslin was renovated in the 1980s and now serves as holiday accommodation.|$|E
50|$|Before the Henry J was {{released}} to the market, the first production models were taken to Arkansas and driven over roads that experts computed that each 100 miles km <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>roughest</b> roads would equal 5000 miles km of normal driving.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we extend <b>the</b> <b>rough</b> set {{model on}} two {{different}} universes in intuitionistic fuzzy approximation spaces to a single-valued neutrosophic environment. Firstly, based on the (α, β, γ) -cut relation R ˜ { (α, β, γ) }, we propose a rough set model in generalized single-valued neutrosophic approximation spaces. Then, some properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new <b>rough</b> set model are discussed. Furthermore, we obtain two extended models <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new <b>rough</b> set model—the degree rough set model and <b>the</b> variable precision <b>rough</b> set model—and study some of their properties. Finally, we explore an example to illustrate <b>the</b> validity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new <b>rough</b> set model...|$|R
25|$|On 13 September 1909, Baddeck No. 2 was towed up the Baddeck River from Beinn Bhreagh to the Bentick Farm testing grounds. The {{flight tests}} out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>roughed</b> out field, began on 17 September and {{continued}} into October and November 1909.|$|R
5|$|Though Parry {{had a great}} {{interest}} in music, he had no opportunity to study it until there was a temporary closure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rough</b> and Ready Iron Works. Some of his co-workers were also musicians, and they offered music lessons while the iron works was closed. Parry joined a music sight-reading class taught by one of the men. He continued to study harmony with another co-worker, and learned how to read and write while he was learning about harmony.|$|E
5|$|As Apollo 17 was {{the final}} lunar mission of the Apollo program, several {{different}} scientific objectives were identified {{in order to maximize}} the scientific productivity of the mission. Landing sites considered for previous missions, but were rejected were reconsidered. Taurus–Littrow was one of several potential landing sites considered for Apollo 17 along with Tycho crater, Copernicus crater, Tsiolkovskiy crater on the far side, among others. All but Taurus–Littrow were eventually eliminated for scientific and/or operational reasons. A landing at Tycho was thought to be too dangerous because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rough</b> terrain found there, a landing on the far side in Tsiolkovskiy would add the expense of communications satellites necessary to maintain contact between the crew and ground control during surface operations, and a landing in Copernicus was regarded as low priority.|$|E
5|$|During the 15th century, England {{was divided}} by the {{prolonged}} period of civil war called the Wars of the Roses: the Luttrells were supporters of the House of Lancaster. In 1461, Sir James Luttrell died following the Lancastrian defeat at the Second Battle of St Albans, {{and his family were}} deprived of their estates by the Yorkist Edward IV. The castle was given to the Herberts, but the Luttrells regained it on the accession of the Lancastarian Henry VII in 1485, when Dunster was restored to James' son, Sir Hugh Luttrell. Hugh repaired the castle chapel and in the early 16th century his son, Sir Andrew Luttrell, built a new wall {{on the east side of}} the castle. Andrew's son Sir John Luttrell, who inherited the castle, was a famous soldier, diplomat, and courtier under Henry VIII and Edward VI, serving in France and in Scotland during the conflicts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rough</b> Wooing. In 1542, the antiquarian John Leland reported the castle keep and buildings to be considerable disrepair, with the exception of the chapel, and after Sir John's death the castle was leased out for several years, first by his daughter, Mary, and then under his brother, Thomas.|$|E

5|$|From a low base at the {{beginning}} of the sixteenth century, trade expanded in the 1530s, but suffered from the English invasions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rough</b> Wooing in the 1540s. From the mid-sixteenth century, Scotland experienced a decline in demand for exports of cloth and wool to the continent. Scots responded by selling larger quantities of traditional goods, increasing the output of salt, herring and coal. The fortunes of Scottish burghs in the export trade changed across the century. Haddington, which had been one of the major centres of trade in the late Medieval period, saw its share of foreign exports collapse in the sixteenth century. Aberdeen's share of trade remained stable for most of the century, but slumped in the last decade. The small Fife ports grew in significance and Edinburgh took an increasing share of trade through its port of Leith. This forced smaller ports to diversify into other commodities and to undertake more coastal trading. Overall there was an increase in foreign trade from the 1570s, of which Edinburgh received the major share.|$|E
5|$|Like most European nations the Scots in {{this period}} began to covert from the bow to {{gunpowder}} firearms. Handguns were present in Scottish armies in small numbers from the fifteenth century and there are increasingly frequent references to handguns and arquebus in records. An account of the Scottish vanguard at Haddon Rig in 1542 suggests that half the troops were missile men and half of those were arquebusiers. Equal proportions of missile to melee troops {{seems to have been}} an aim of Scottish commanders for most of the century, although it was not always possible in the field. The main source of firearms were the French, who seem to have extensively rearmed the Scottish after the English invasions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rough</b> Wooing.|$|E
5|$|Powerful surf {{affected}} the northern coastlines {{of the islands}} in the Greater Antilles. Strong swells also lashed the Bahamas. During most hurricanes, {{the location of the}} Bahamas prevents powerful swells of Atlantic hurricanes from striking southeast Florida. However, the combination of the location, forward speed, and strength of Isabel produced strong swells through the Providence Channel onto a narrow 10mile (16km) stretch of the southeastern Florida coastline; wave heights peaked at 14feet (4.3m) at Delray Beach. The swells capsized a watercraft and injured its twopassengers at Boynton Beach, and a swimmer required assistance to be rescued near Juno Beach. Minor beach erosion was reported in Palm Beach County. In the northern portion of the state, waves reached up to 15feet (4.5m) in height at Flagler Beach, causing the Flagler Beach Pier to be closed due to damaged boards from the waves. Rip currents from Isabel killed a surfer at an unguarded beach in Nassau County, with an additional six people requiring rescue from the currents. The beaches were later closed during the worst <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rough</b> surf.|$|E

40|$|In rough {{machining}} of parts with sculptured surfaces, two main objectives are usually considered: machining time and overall removed material at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>roughing</b> phase. <b>The</b> outcome <b>of</b> that phase {{is critical for}} the subsequent finishing phase. This paper proposes a method for measuring roughed part quality through calculation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> local difference between <b>the</b> <b>roughed</b> part geometry and the ideally finished part geometry. The method calculates the height from a point lying on <b>the</b> <b>roughed</b> surface to its projection on the ideally finished part surface. Using <b>the</b> API <b>of</b> a CAD system for this purpose proves computationally inefficient. Therefore, a mean distance between a triangle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>roughed</b> surface triangular mesh and the ideally finished part surface region lying in a suitable envelope is calculated instead. The calculation is repeated not for all triangles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mesh, but for a sample as low as 3 %, which, according to the Levene statistical test suffices, thereby, reducing computational cost by orders <b>of</b> magnitude. <b>The</b> method ultimately yields a single figure, i. e. <b>the</b> standard deviation <b>of</b> local differences between <b>the</b> <b>roughed</b> and finished part, normalized by the mean difference. The concept was tested on sculptured surface parts of various mechanical and operational properties and was proven efficient in all test cases...|$|R
5|$|The nuclear {{envelope}} surrounds the nucleus, separating its contents from the cytoplasm. It has two membranes, each a lipid bilayer with associated proteins. The outer nuclear membrane is continuous with the {{rough endoplasmic reticulum}} membrane, and like that structure, features ribosomes attached to the surface. The outer membrane is also continuous with the inner nuclear membrane since the two layers are fused together at numerous tiny holes called nuclear pores that perforate the {{nuclear envelope}}. These pores are about 120 nm in diameter and regulate the passage of molecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm, permitting some {{to pass through the}} membrane, but not others. Since the nuclear pores are located in an area of high traffic, they {{play an important role in}} the physiology of cells. The space between the outer and inner membranes is called the perinuclear space and is joined with the lumen <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rough</b> ER.|$|E

25|$|On June 30, Colonel Leonard Wood, the {{commander}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rough</b> Riders, {{was promoted to}} the rank of Brigadier General. Likewise, Lt. Colonel Roosevelt was promoted to Colonel and given command <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rough</b> Riders. On the following day, the fiercest battle of the Spanish-American War occurred: the Battle of San Juan Hill. Frantz's skill during the battle would forever gain him Roosevelt's friendship and trust. Just before the final assault on the Spanish fortifications, Captain O'Neill was warned about unnecessarily exposing himself to Spanish fire. Even as he was dismissing the danger, O'Neill was instantly killed by a bullet hitting him in the mouth. Frantz immediately took over the command and led the company to a successful charge up Kettle and San Juan Hills. After the battle concluded, in recognition of Frantz's service, Roosevelt promoted Frantz {{to the rank of}} Captain and commander of A Company <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rough</b> Riders.|$|E
