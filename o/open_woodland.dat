40|$|Since 1950, the {{creation}} of <b>open</b> <b>woodlands</b> has increased in Canada's northeastern continuous boreal forest and recent {{studies have demonstrated that}} the mechanisms underlying their creation are similar to those found in the lichen woodland zone. Since no natural re-densification of <b>open</b> <b>woodlands</b> has been observed to date, afforestation is necessary to counteract an increase of these types of stands in the continuous boreal forest. The aim {{of this study was to}} test the operational feasibility and success of afforestation efforts in <b>open</b> <b>woodlands,</b> 10 years after planting. The experimental design included different containerized seedling stocks and site preparation approaches, such as patch and disk scarification, and covered most of the geographical range of accessible continuous boreal forest in Québec. In <b>open</b> <b>woodlands,</b> regardless of black spruce stock size, disk scarification increased planted seedling survival and growth compared with patch scarification and direct planting, possibly due to a beneficial effect on seedling nutrition. However, even if seedling growth in <b>open</b> <b>woodlands</b> and feathermoss stands submitted to disk scarification was comparable, growth was higher in the latter stands. Nonetheless, we conclude that disk scarification followed by planting is an appropriate method to afforest boreal <b>open</b> <b>woodlands...</b>|$|R
5|$|Banksia sphaerocarpa is {{distributed}} widely across southwestern Western Australia—from Eneabba in the north, {{south to the}} Whicher Range, Nannup, Albany and Jerramungup, and eastwards to the vicinity of Hyden. It is mainly found on sandy soils in flat or gently sloped areas in shrubland, mallee or <b>open</b> <b>woodland.</b>|$|E
5|$|Favoured {{soils are}} deep grey sandy loams or {{shallower}} sand overlying claypan. Associated vegetation is typically scrubland or shrubland, although moisture-loving trees such as B.littoralis (Swamp Banksia) or Melaleuca preissiana (Moonah) {{may also be}} present, sometimes in sufficient numbers to form a low <b>open</b> <b>woodland.</b>|$|E
5|$|The species {{grows in}} sand dunes of white, white-grey or {{yellow-brown}} sand, amongst {{a system of}} ephemeral salt creeks. Populations occur both in low-lying areas near creeks, and atop dunes.

30|$|Comparison of burned transects by {{season and}} {{vegetation}} structure type. When considering the partitioned transects by vegetation type, the same overall seasonal trends described for fire transects by season were observed (Appendix 2). Burned area was also {{lowest in the}} EDS, and unburned patch density and mean unburned patch length were highest in the EDS, for almost all vegetation types. <b>Open</b> <b>woodlands</b> were the most extensively burned vegetation type and sandstone woodlands the least. Mean char and scorch heights were highest in <b>open</b> <b>woodlands</b> in the EDS, and in woodlands in the LDS. Unburned patch density was highest in sandstone heaths and lowest in <b>open</b> <b>woodlands.</b> Mean unburned patch length was almost five times higher in open forests {{when compared to the}} lowest value, observed in <b>open</b> <b>woodlands.</b>|$|R

The gnatcatchers and gnatwrens are mainly soft bluish gray {{in color and}} have the typical insectivore's long sharp bill. They are birds of fairly <b>open</b> <b>woodland</b> or scrub which nest in bushes or trees.|$|E
5|$|Banksia ilicifolia grows {{exclusively}} on sandy soils; its range ends where heavy soils are evident. It especially favours low-lying areas. It generally grows in <b>open</b> <b>woodland</b> alongside such trees as jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata), candlestick banksia (Banksia attenuata), firewood banksia (B. menziesii) and Western Australian Christmas tree (Nuytsia floribunda). Along the south coast, it grows in heath, sometimes forming stands with bull banksia (B. grandis).|$|E
5|$|Found in <b>open</b> <b>woodland,</b> {{parks and}} gardens, the blue-faced honeyeater {{is common in}} {{northern}} and eastern Australia and southern New Guinea. It appears to be sedentary in parts of its range and locally nomadic in other parts; however, the species has been little studied. Its diet is mostly composed of invertebrates, supplemented with nectar and fruit. They often take over and renovate old babbler nests, in which the female lays and incubates two or rarely three eggs.|$|E

5|$|Several {{different}} {{habitat types}} {{are found in}} Ireland, including farmland, <b>open</b> <b>woodland,</b> temperate broadleaf and mixed forests, conifer plantations, peat bogs {{and a variety of}} coastal habitats. However, agriculture drives current land use patterns in Ireland, limiting natural habitat preserves, particularly for larger wild mammals with greater territorial needs. With no large apex predators in Ireland other than humans and dogs, such populations of animals as semi-wild deer that cannot be controlled by smaller predators, such as the fox, are controlled by annual culling.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent ashfall from eruptions in the Cascade Range in {{the late}} Miocene contributed to the Mascall Strata, layers of stream-deposited {{volcanic}} tuffs laid atop the Picture Gorge Basalt. Preserved in the Mascall are fossils of animals such as horses, camels, rhinoceroses, bears, pronghorn, deer, weasels, raccoons, cats, dogs, and sloths. These fauna thrived in the monument's <b>open</b> <b>woodland</b> and savannah between 15 and 12million years ago. The fossils of oak, sycamore, maple, ginkgo, and elm trees reflect the area's cool climate during this time period.|$|E

5|$|The holly-leaved banksia gives {{its name}} to the Banksia ilicifolia {{woodlands}} ('community type 22'), a possibly threatened ecological community found in the Bassendean and Spearwood systems in the central Swan Coastal Plain north of Rockingham.

The habitat is <b>open</b> <b>woodland</b> and with an open understorey, and such trees as B. ilicifolia, B. attenuata and stout paperbark (Melaleuca preissiana).|$|E
5|$|There {{are about}} 2,000 species of antlion {{found in most}} parts of the world, with the {{greatest}} diversity being in warmer areas.

Antlions live in a range of usually dry habitats including <b>open</b> <b>woodland</b> floors, scrub-clad dunes, hedge bases, river banks, road verges, under raised buildings and in vacant lots.|$|E

5|$|Throughout {{its wide}} range, the olive baboon {{can be found}} in a number of {{different}} habitats. It is usually classified as savanna-dwelling, living in the wide plains of the grasslands. The grasslands, especially those near <b>open</b> <b>woodland,</b> do make up a large part of its habitat, but the baboon also inhabits rainforests and deserts. Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, for instance, both support olive baboon populations in dense tropical forests.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} the {{fieldfare}} frequents mixed woodland of birch, alder, pine, spruce and fir, often near marshes, moorland or other open ground. It does not avoid {{the vicinity of}} humans and {{can be seen in}} cultivated areas, orchards, parks and gardens. It also inhabits open tundra and the slopes of hills above the tree line. In the winter, groups of fieldfares are chiefly found in open country, agricultural land, orchards and <b>open</b> <b>woodland.</b> They are nomadic, wandering wherever there is an abundance of berries and insects. Later in the year they move on to pastureland and cultivated fields.|$|E
5|$|Nettlecombe Park is {{important}} for its lichen flora. Records suggest this site has been wood pasture or parkland for at least 400 years. There are some very old oak pollards which may be of this age or older. The oldest standard trees are over 200 years of age. The continuity of <b>open</b> <b>woodland</b> and parkland, with large mature and over-mature timber, has enabled characteristic species of epiphytic lichens and beetles to become established and persist. Many of the species in the park are now nationally scarce because this type of habitat has been eliminated over large areas of Great Britain. The park was notified as an SSSI in 1990.|$|E
