40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{subject of}} tax reform seems {{to emerge as}} a highly debated topic of {{discussion}} every few years because <b>our</b> current <b>income</b> tax system is too complex, inefficient, and intrusive. There are two unique proposals that would {{change the face of}} our tax system, the flat tax and the national sales tax.

5000|$|Research {{published}} in 2013 {{shows that the}} US provides, alongside the United Kingdom and Spain, the least economic mobility of any of 13 rich, democratic countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Prior research suggested that the United States shows roughly average levels of occupational upward mobility and shows lower rates of income mobility than comparable societies. Blanden et al. report, [...] "the idea of the US as 'the land of opportunity' persists; and clearly seems misplaced." [...] According to these studies, [...] "by international standards, the United States has an unusually low level of intergenerational mobility: <b>our</b> parents' <b>income</b> is highly predictive of <b>our</b> <b>incomes</b> as adults. Intergenerational mobility in the United States is lower than in France, Germany, Sweden, Canada, Finland, Norway and Denmark. Research in 2006 found that among high-income countries for which comparable estimates are available, only the United Kingdom had a lower rate of mobility than the United States." [...] Economist Isabel Sawhill concluded that [...] "this challenges the notion of America as the land of opportunity". Several public figures and commentators, from David Frum to Richard G. Wilkinson, have noted that the American dream is better realized in Denmark, which is ranked as having the highest social mobility in the OECD. [...] In 2015, economist Joseph Stiglitz stated, [...] "Maybe we should be calling the American Dream the Scandinavian Dream." ...|$|R
