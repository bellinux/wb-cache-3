The thermodynamic properties of vapor cells in filters are carefully controlled because they determine important {{qualities of the}} filter, for instance the necessary strength of the magnetic field. Light is let {{into and out of}} this vapor chamber by way of two low-reflection windows made of a material such as magnesium fluoride.

25|$|In February 2015, a {{switched-mode}} {{power supply}} chip, designated U16, of the Raspberry Pi2 ModelB version1.1 (the initially released version) {{was found to be}} vulnerable to flashes of light, particularly the light from xenon camera flashes and green and red laser pointers. However, other bright lights, particularly ones that are on continuously, were found to have no effect. The symptom was the Raspberry Pi2 spontaneously rebooting or turning off when these lights were flashed at the chip. Initially, some users and commenters suspected that the electromagnetic pulse (EMP) from the xenon flash tube was causing the problem by interfering with the computer's digital circuitry, but this was ruled out by tests where the light was either blocked by a card or aimed at {{the other side of the}} Raspberry Pi2, both of which did not cause a problem. The problem was narrowed down to the U16 chip by covering first the system on a chip (main processor) and then U16 with Blu-Tack (an opaque poster mounting compound). Light being the sole culprit, instead of EMP, was further confirmed by the laser pointer tests, where it was also found that less opaque covering was needed to shield against the laser pointers than to shield against the xenon flashes. The U16 chip seems to be bare silicon without a plastic cover (i.e. a chip-scale package or wafer-level package), which would, if present, block the light. Unofficial workarounds include covering U16 with <b>opaque</b> <b>material</b> (such as electrical tape, lacquer, poster mounting compound, or even balled-up bread), putting the Raspberry Pi2 in a case, and avoiding taking photos of the top side of the board with a xenon flash. This issue was not caught before the release of the Raspberry Pi2 because while commercial electronic devices are routinely subjected to tests of susceptibility to radio interference, it is not standard or common practice to test their susceptibility to optical interference.|$|E

500|$|Dickson and his then lead assistant, Charles Brown, made halting {{progress}} at first. Edison's original idea involved recording pinpoint photographs, 1/32 {{of an inch}} wide, directly on to a cylinder (also {{referred to as a}} [...] "drum"); the cylinder, made of an <b>opaque</b> <b>material</b> for positive images or of glass for negatives, was coated in collodion to provide a photographic base. An audio cylinder would provide synchronized sound, while the rotating images, hardly operatic in scale, were viewed through a microscope-like tube. When tests were made with images expanded to a mere 1/8 of an inch in width, the coarseness of the silver bromide emulsion used on the cylinder became unacceptably apparent. Around June 1889, the lab began working with sensitized celluloid sheets, supplied by John Carbutt, that could be wrapped around the cylinder, providing a far superior base for the recording of photographs. The first film made for the Kinetoscope, and apparently the first motion picture ever produced on photographic film in the United States, may have been shot at this time (there is an unresolved debate over whether it was made in June 1889 or November 1890); known as Monkeyshines, No. 1, it shows an employee of the lab in an apparently tongue-in-cheek display of physical dexterity. Attempts at synchronizing sound were soon left behind, while Dickson would also experiment with disc-based exhibition designs.|$|E

40|$|Although the thrombogenic {{nature of}} the {{surfaces}} of cardiovascular devices is {{an important aspect of}} blood biocompatibility, few studies have examined platelet deposition onto <b>opaque</b> <b>materials</b> used for these devices in real time. This is particularly true for the metallic surfaces used in current ventricular assist devices (VADs). Using hemoglobin depleted red blood cells (RBC ghosts) and long working distance optics to visualize platelet deposition, we sought to perform such an evaluation. A titanium alloy (Ti 6 Al 4 V) and 5 alternative <b>opaque</b> <b>materials</b> were examined. Ti 6 Al 4 V had significantly increased platelet deposition relative to the majority of alternative materials. Blood flow patterns are of particular concern for devices such as blood pumps where shearing forces can be high, volumes are relatively large, and the flow fields can be complex. However, few studies have examined the effect of geometric irregularities on thrombus formation on clinically relevant <b>opaque</b> <b>materials</b> under flow. The second objective of this report was to quantify human platelet deposition onto titanium alloys, as well as positive and negative control surfaces, in the region of crevices (50 - 150 µm in width) that might be encountered in many VADs. The results revealed that the largest crevice size was the least thrombogenic. At the higher shear rate, the most deposition occurred in the medium size crevice. A third challenge in assessing the hemocompatibility of a blood-wetted device is understanding the functional relationship between shear stress, biochemical agonists, and artificial surfaces. The final objective of this report was to investigate the effect of sub-threshold concentrations of ADP in conjunction with flow on platelet deposition onto clinically relevant <b>opaque</b> <b>materials.</b> To achieve this aim, a membrane-based agonist delivery system was designed to evenly introduce specific concentrations of agonists into a flowing blood analog. The results showed that that the addition of a sub-threshold level of ADP to the system resulted in nearly a 2. 5 fold increase in deposition on the titanium surface.
