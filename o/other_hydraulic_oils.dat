40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the variation of the required punch load during the deep drawing process under different friction conditions. In this regards, several deep-drawing tests of cylindrical cups were conducted under four friction conditions at the tool–blank interface. The first case was the dry deep-drawing, considered as a reference friction condition, while in the <b>other</b> three cases <b>hydraulic</b> <b>oil,</b> lithium-based grease and animal fat were used as lubricants. For each friction case, three levels of blank holding force were adopted, namely 10, 20 and 25 kN. The finite element simulation of the deep-drawing process was used to generate a set of calibration curves. By overlapping the experimental load-stroke curves on the calibration curves, the friction coefficient was estimated for each friction case...|$|R

40|$|This is {{the final}} {{documentation}} of the basis that can be the foundation of how {{to solve the problem}} with leaking <b>hydraulic</b> <b>oil</b> in a shoe press at the company Albany International AB in Halmstad, Sweden. The project has been performed at Halmstad University as a degree project commissioned by Albany International AB. The purpose of the degree project was to find a way of detecting the hydraulic leak of a shoe press. The reason is that the shoe press runs unattended during nights and weekends, this can cause an extensive decontamination work and production stop if leak. The <b>hydraulic</b> <b>oil</b> could be leaking in large amounts or slowly as a fine mist. The development of a working system that can detect a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>oil</b> leak and stop the machine before a large amount of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>oil</b> leaks out would considerably reduce the cost of the decontamination work. It would also reduce the interruption time of the production. When the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>oil</b> is leaking as a fine mist and spreading in the facility, the risk of fire is much higher and will be reduced if detected in time. The outcome of the degree project is this document containing results of investigations and a suggestion on how to make a prototype.

40|$|This {{report is}} based on the {{challenges}} FMC Technologies has due to measuring the amount of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>oil</b> inside a piston accumulator tank {{on the bottom of the}} sea. It is favorably to know at any given time how much <b>hydraulic</b> <b>oil</b> is left in the tank; in time some of the oil will be lost to the environment due to its function. There are several hydraulic accumulator tanks attached to a subsea Xmas tree, each operating on different system but perform the same main function, which is to send <b>hydraulic</b> <b>oil</b> to an actuator. The actuator uses the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>oil</b> as energy to open and close valves. Today FMC Technologies does not have any satisfying solution regarding this problem; rather they use prior experience of how long it takes before an accumulator tank needs to be refilled. In collaboration with FMC Technologies a solution to the problem has been developed for measuring the remaining <b>hydraulic</b> <b>oil</b> inside the tank, where a measuring system were put on the top of the accumulator tank protected by a housing. The critical issue for the system is an expected lifetime of 25 years. Several solution regarding a measuring system where proposed. A scoreboard criterion where used to distinguish out the best solution according to the requirements given by FMC Technologies. A detailed concept regarding the best solution where developed, which consist of a time-offlight laser placed inside a housing which is attached to the top of the accumulator tank. The housing must be able to withstand water pressure down to 2750 m (275 Bar). The bottom of the housing must be able to withstand internal pressure from the accumulator tank which is 345 Bar.
