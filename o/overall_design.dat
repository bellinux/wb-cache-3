40|$|In {{this paper}} we shall extend the {{applications}} of iterative identification and control design to partially unknown unstable plants. We show that by employing a two step approach, where an unstable plant is first stabilized by a parallel feedback stabilizer, {{it is possible}} to <b>design</b> systematically an <b>overall</b> closed-loop system that has good step responses with little overshoots by using the iterative identification and control design methodology. Furthermore, this approach easily preserves the simplicity of an IMC design through tuning the <b>overall</b> <b>designed</b> closed-loop bandwidth with a single design parameter. Specifically, similarly to situations where the plant is stable (apart from possibly including a simple integrator), we can design a system with a small initial <b>overall</b> <b>designed</b> closed-loop bandwidth (after the plant is stabilized by a known parallel feedback stabilizer) such that high frequency unmodelled dynamics of the plant are not overly excited. Through iterative applications of a control-relevant closed-loop system identification procedure and the standard IMC design method to the stabilized plant, the <b>overall</b> <b>designed</b> closed-loop bandwidth of the system can be widened progressively while maintaining good step responses with little overshoots. Two simulation examples are employed to illustrate the method. These examples show that, irrespective of the presence of adverse unstable real pole-zero structures, the expected results are achievable by the method described...|$|R

5|$|For the exterior, Burges re-used some of {{his earlier}} unexecuted plans, the <b>overall</b> <b>design</b> from the Crimea Memorial Church and St John's Cathedral, Brisbane, the {{elevations}} from Lille Cathedral. The main problem of the building was its size. Despite the prodigious efforts of its fundraisers, and despite Burges exceeding the original budget, Cork was still unable to afford a really large cathedral. Burges overcame this obstacle by using the grandeur of his three-spired exterior to offset the lesser scale of {{the remainder of the}} building.|$|E

5|$|The {{house today}} appears an {{assemblage}} of several architectural styles popular during the Victorian era. While the <b>overall</b> <b>design</b> and air {{could be described as}} Italianate, also present in the same entrance facade are examples of high Victorian Gothic, such as an Italianate seigneurial tower confused in design with a campanile tower. This tower complete with a glazed loggia is crowned by a French-style mansard roof with oversized chimneys masquerading as Renaissance ornament. The centrepiece of the same facade is a porte-cochère designed in a heavy neoclassical style.|$|E

5|$|Because the {{new game}} is set within a {{well-established}} franchise, Starbreeze tried {{to retain the}} essence of the world and rebuild these elements. The game's story was written by British science-fiction writer Richard K Morgan, whom the team approached after they read his book Altered Carbon. Syndicate was Morgan's second video-game script after 2011's Crysis 2; he used the original game for reference and included elements that those who had played it would immediately recognize. He preserved the original's dystopian setting and theme, and hoped to use these elements to build a powerful story. Morgan traveled to Sweden to meet Starbreeze's game designers to ensure the game's story would not contradict its <b>overall</b> <b>design.</b>|$|E
5|$|Before 1951, several {{different}} flags {{had been in}} use since the Revolution. The earliest flag was plain red, and was used in 1919 during {{the existence of the}} Lithuanian-Byelorussian SSR. After the formation of the Byelorussian SSR, the lettering ССРБ (SSRB) was added in gold to the top hoist. This design was established {{with the passage of the}} first Constitution of the Byelorussian SSR. It was later modified in the 1927 Constitution where the letters were changed to БССР (BSSR) but kept the <b>overall</b> <b>design</b> the same. This design was changed in 1937, when a hammer and sickle and red star were placed above the letters. The flag dimensions were also formally established as 1:2 for the first time. This flag remained in use until the adoption of the 1951 flag, which did away with the letters.|$|E

5|$|Development of Final Fantasy XIII-2 began around March and April 2010 {{and lasted}} about {{one and a}} half years. The game was {{unveiled}} at the Square Enix 1st Production Department Premier in January 2011. Many of the key designers remained in their roles from the previous game, and developer tri-Ace was hired to help with the game's design, art, and programming. The development team wanted to exceed Final Fantasy XIII in every aspect while making the story's tone mysterious and darker than the previous game. The game builds upon the Paradigm Shift battle system used in Final Fantasy XIII and includes a less linear <b>overall</b> <b>design.</b>|$|E
5|$|Jackals, or Kig-Yar, (from {{the moon}} of Eayn, {{orbiting}} Chu'ot) carry energy shields or ranged weaponry. Shield or armor colors denotes {{the rank of}} each caste. In some cases, such as with the Jackals, the <b>overall</b> <b>design</b> was honed once the enemy's role was clearly defined. They look like bird-like creatures or raptors. This particular species did not come into the Covenant {{in the same way}} as other species. They work as mercenaries, as their culture is based on piracy and do not follow the religious beliefs like the other species. In the Halo book, Halo: Contact Harvest, it was revealed that Jackals were the first species in the Covenant to encounter humanity. The resulting events initiated the start of the Human-Covenant War.|$|E
5|$|The Red Ensign of Singapore {{is a civil}} ensign used by privately owned, non-military {{ships that}} are {{registered}} in Singapore. The <b>overall</b> <b>design</b> of the ensign is a modification of the national flag, with {{the ratio of the}} width to the length extended to 1:2. The ensign was created by law in 1966. The use of this ensign is regulated by the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA). According to the MPA, the Red Ensign is the only ensign to be used on Singaporean civilian ships, and the national flag is not an acceptable substitute. The ensign must be hoisted on all Singaporean ships on entering or leaving port.|$|E

5|$|Metroid Prime was a {{collaboration}} between Retro Studios and Nintendo EAD and R. The <b>overall</b> <b>design</b> was a collaborative effort, while the art and engineering was done entirely at Retro, and the music was handled in Japan. Retro Studios was created in 1998 by an alliance between Nintendo and Iguana Entertainment founder Jeff Spangenberg. The studio would create games for the forthcoming GameCube targeted at a mature demographic. After establishing its offices in Austin, Texas in 1999, Retro worked on four GameCube projects. When Miyamoto visited Retro in 2000, he suggested a new Metroid game after seeing the prototype of a first-person shooter engine they had created. In 2000 and early 2001, three games in development at Retro were canceled, and in July 2001, an RPG, Raven Blade, was terminated, leaving Prime {{the only game in}} development. During the last nine months of development, Retro's staff worked 80- to 100-hour weeks to reach the deadline imposed by Nintendo.|$|E
5|$|Heroes of Mana was {{produced}} by series creator Koichi Ishii, directed by Takeo Oin, and written by Masato Kato. Ishii had previously produced or directed all of the previous Mana games, while Kato also wrote the stories for Children of Mana (2006) and Dawn of Mana (2006). The game was developed by Brownie Brown, who previously helped develop Sword of Mana (2003). Ishii created the <b>overall</b> <b>design,</b> and Brownie Brown worked directly with him to implement it. As the series creator, Ishii {{felt it was important}} to be directly involved in all stages of development. Heroes of Mana was created as an RTS game to complement the other titles in the World of Mana project, which all offer a spin on the original Seiken Densetsu formula. Ishii stated that it was also to help expose Japanese gamers to real-time strategy games, a genre that is relatively obscure in Japan, while simultaneously satisfying players abroad with an RTS for an unconventional console, as most real-time strategy games are released for personal computers. To match this mission, the game was designed for more casual players than the typical fan of the traditionally role-playing game series. The Nintendo DS was chosen as the platform partially due to the system's multiplayer potential as well as giving the sensation of touching the game. The team found developing an RTS for the Nintendo DS to be difficult, and had to start development over at one point. Although prior to the World of Mana project Ishii has said that the games in the series are only thematically connected, Heroes is explicitly set as a prequel to Seiken Densetsu 3 (1995), depicting battles between the nations present in that game. It is set one generation prior to Seiken Densetsu 3, with some characters noted as the parents of characters in the other game.|$|E
