40|$|This work is an {{investigation}} into <b>the</b> ground <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> sufficient reason. My original contribution is the claim that in David Hume 2 ̆ 7 s writing on causality we find an implicit treatment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> sufficient reason. While Hume does not explicitly accept or deny <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> sufficient reason, my claim is that in analyzing causality, Hume also provides us with an account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> sufficient reason, since causality may be understood as <b>the</b> empirical manifestation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> more general <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> sufficient reason. I support my claim about Hume by presenting two opposed views <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> sufficient reason, that of Leibniz and Schopenhauer. In my exegesis of Leibniz and Schopenhauer, I show how Leibniz 2 ̆ 7 s presentation treats <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> sufficient reason as legitimately metaphysical, and Schopenhauer in his dissertation, On <b>the</b> Fourfold Root <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Principle</b> <b>of</b> Sufficient Reason, treats <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> as a merely transcendental principle. These two polar views may be bridged, it is my claim, by looking to Hume 2 ̆ 7 s treatment of causality situated between them...|$|R

5|$|The axiom of {{foundation}} {{proposed that}} every set {{can be constructed}} {{from the bottom up}} in an ordered succession of steps by way <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> Zermelo and Fraenkel. If one set belongs to another then the first must necessarily come before the second in the succession. This excludes the possibility of a set belonging to itself. To demonstrate that the addition of this new axiom to the others did not produce contradictions, von Neumann introduced a method of demonstration, called the method of inner models, which later became an essential instrument in set theory.|$|E
5|$|The double {{election}} {{was a result}} of the growing tensions inside the College of Cardinals concerning the policy of the Holy See towards the Holy Roman Empire, initiated by the Concordat of Worms (1122), which ended the investiture controversy. Several, particularly older, cardinals considered the compromise achieved in Worms as desertion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> the Gregorian Reform, and inclined to accept it only as a tactical move. They supported the traditional alliance of the Papacy with the Normans in southern Italy. Some of them were connected to old monastic centers in Southern Italy such as Montecassino. One of their leaders was Cardinal Pierleoni, representative {{of one of the most}} powerful families of Rome.|$|E
5|$|With the {{commencement}} of hostilities between Japan and the British Empire, {{it became clear that}} the three hospital ships currently serving Australia—Manunda, Wanganella, and Oranje—would not be able to operate in the shallow waters typical of Maritime Southeast Asia, so a new hospital ship was required. Of the Australian Merchant Navy vessels able to operate in this region, none were suitable for conversion to a hospital ship, and a request to the British Ministry of Shipping placed Centaur at the disposal of the Australian military on 4 January 1943. The conversion work began on 9 January and Centaur was commissioned as an Australian Hospital Ship on 1 March. During her conversion, Centaur was painted with the markings of a hospital ship as detailed in Article 5 of the tenth Hague Convention of 1907 ("Adaptation to Maritime War <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Principles</b> <b>of</b> the Geneva Convention"); white hull with a green band interspersed by three red crosses on each flank of the hull, white superstructure, multiple large red crosses positioned so that the ship's status would be visible from both sea and air, and an identification number (for Centaur, 47) on her bows. At night, the markings were illuminated by a combination of internal and external lights. Data on the ship's markings and the layout of identifying structural features was provided to the International Committee of the Red Cross during the first week of February 1943, who passed this on to the Japanese on 5 February. This information was also circulated and promoted by the press and media.|$|E
