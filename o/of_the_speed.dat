5|$|In 1845, Arago {{suggested}} to Fizeau and Foucault that {{they attempt to}} measure the speed of light. Sometime in 1849, however, {{it appears that the}} two had a falling out, and they parted ways pursuing separate means of performing this experiment. In 1848−49, Fizeau used, not a rotating mirror, but a toothed wheel apparatus to perform an absolute measurement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> of light in air. In 1850, Fizeau and Foucault both used rotating mirror devices to perform relative measures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> of light in air versus water. Foucault used a scaled-up version of the rotating mirror apparatus to perform an absolute measurement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> of light in 1862. Subsequent experiments performed by Marie Alfred Cornu in 1872–76 and by Albert A. Michelson in 1877–1931 used improved versions of the toothed wheel and rotating mirror experiments to make steadily more accurate estimates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> of light.|$|E

5|$|The first {{quantitative}} estimate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> {{of light}} {{was made in}} 1676 by Rømer (see Rømer's determination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> of light). From the observation that the periods of Jupiter's innermost moon Io appeared to be shorter when the Earth was approaching Jupiter than when receding from it, he concluded that light travels at a finite speed, and estimated that it takes light 22 minutes to cross the diameter of Earth's orbit. Christiaan Huygens combined this estimate with an estimate for {{the diameter of the}} Earth's orbit to obtain an estimate of speed of light of , 26% lower than the actual value.|$|E

5|$|Among animals, {{there exists}} a single known example of an {{apparently}} freely-rotating structure, though it is used for digestion rather than propulsion: the crystalline style of certain bivalves and gastropods. The style consists of a transparent glycoprotein rod which is continuously formed in a cilia-lined sac and extends into the stomach. The cilia rotate the rod, so that it becomes wrapped in strands of mucus. As the rod slowly dissolves in the stomach, it releases digestive enzymes. Estimates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> of rotation of the style in vivo vary significantly, and it is unclear if the style is rotated continuously or intermittently.|$|E

5|$|At this time, the {{efficacy}} of the Chapman–Jouguet model was still in doubt, and it was the subject of studies by John von Neumann at the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study. Kistiakowsky realized that the deviations from hydrodynamic theory were the result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> of the chemical reactions themselves. To control the reaction, calculations down to the microsecond level were needed.

5|$|If a photon {{did have}} non-zero mass, {{there would be}} other effects as well. Coulomb's law would be {{modified}} and the electromagnetic field would have an extra physical degree of freedom.

If Coulomb's law is not exactly valid, then {{that would allow the}} presence of an electric field to exist within a hollow conductor when it is subjected to an external electric field.

5|$|In 1834, Charles Wheatstone {{developed}} {{a method of}} using a rapidly rotating mirror to study transient phenomena, and applied this method to measure the velocity of electricity in a wire and the duration of an electric spark.

If mirror R is stationary, then the slit image will reform at S regardless of the mirror's tilt. The situation is different, however, if R is in rapid rotation.|$|E
