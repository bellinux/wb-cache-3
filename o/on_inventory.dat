25|$|Regarding {{production}} planning, {{there is}} a basic distinction between the push approach and the pull approach, with the later including the singular approach of just in time. Pull means that the production system authorizes production based <b>on</b> <b>inventory</b> level; push means that production occurs based on demand (forecasted or present, that is purchase orders). An individual production system can be both push and pull; for example activities before the CODP may work under a pull system, while activities after the CODP may work under a push system.|$|E
25|$|ABC {{analysis}} {{is a method}} for analyzing inventory based on Pareto distribution, it posits that since revenue from items <b>on</b> <b>inventory</b> will be power law distributed then {{it makes sense to}} manage items differently based on their position on a revenue-inventory level matrix, 3 classes are constructed (A,B and C) from cumulative item revenues, so in a matrix each item will have a letter (A,B or C) assigned for revenue and inventory. This method posits that items away from the diagonal should be managed differently: items in the upper part are subject to risk of obsolescence, items in the lower part are subject to risk of stockout.|$|E
500|$|An {{aspect of}} {{gameplay}} in Murder on the Orient Express which received largely negative reactions was the repetitive nature of many tasks the player must complete. 2404 accused {{the game of}} reducing Christie's novel, and the game, {{into a series of}} repetitive and secretarial tasks, such as collecting fingerprints, passports, and other random items. The site further {{went on to say that}} the player is made to feel [...] "like a secretary for Poirot." [...] Game Over Online agreed with this view, saying that much of the game consisted of [...] "goofy little errands" [...] such as completing tasks for characters and mindlessly searching for objects. Eurogamer provides an example of this, by saying that at one point in the game the player is required to go through each cabin checking the shoe sizes of the various passengers' shoes to check if one matches shoe prints outside the train. The inventory system featured in Murder on the Orient Express has also received significant criticism. IGN complained that instead of being able to find item combinations through trial and error in the main screen, the player is forced to drag items to a separate screen, leading to tedious gameplay. Some reviewers, in contrast, praised the inventory system, with Quandary calling it intuitive, and easy for players to organize. The puzzles in Murder on the Orient Express received positive responses from some reviewers. GameSpot commented favourably on the relatively small number of puzzles in the game, saying that they are integrated fairly well within the plot, and are not excessively difficult. The review went on to say that later puzzles in the game often rely more heavily <b>on</b> <b>inventory</b> combinations, but are still reasonably satisfying to solve. Game Over Online, in comparison, accused the game of giving the player too little information to solve puzzles, and also called the puzzles convoluted. The choice of the developers of Murder on the Orient Express to use Antoinette Marceau, rather than Poirot, as the protagonist and player character was criticized by some. 2404 disapproved of the choice, accusing the developers of not fully utilizing the talent of David Suchet, arguably the most famous and successful portrayer of Poirot. The reviewer even went so far as to tell AWE Productions to [...] "make use of talent like David Suchet when you've got it." [...] Like its predecessor, Murder on the Orient Express was criticized for diverging from Christie's original ending. Adventure Gamers called the new ending [...] "a little too contrived for the game's good." [...] 2404 also disapproved of the ending, commenting that it goes off in too much of a Hollywood direction, and that the original ending is much better and a far more satisfying conclusion.|$|E

2500|$|Adventure Gamers' Cameron Urquhart scored it 4 out of 5. He praised how {{the game}} used factual {{historical}} information in its fictional narrative, {{and was also}} impressed with the graphics, sound and voice acting. He was also complementary of the puzzles; [...] "Rather than being loaded down with contrived puzzles for padding, Dracula 3 relies heavily <b>on</b> <b>inventory</b> puzzles, yet you are never resigned to trying everything on everything. The hotspots are almost always necessary, while puzzles are logical and accessible and never feel out of place." [...] He concluded [...] "The game rarely wows you in any one way, and the pace can drag at times in dry subject matter, but overall it's both logical and accessible, with [...] interesting approach to vampire lore and deftly crafted storyline." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mammals: Mammal explorations in Lebanon {{were limited}} until {{around the middle}} of the twentieth century. They are fragmentary and {{provided}} little information on the mammals inhabiting the country. Many species and sub-species were not yet recorded for Lebanon till the 1970s. Between 1980 and 1985, Tohmé, G. and Tohmé, H. alone produced 33% of the known published papers on the Lebanese mammals. The only documented data of the mammals of Al-Shouf Cedar Reserve apparently appeared in the report of Tohmé, H. that was prepared, on behalf of the Protected Areas Project at the Ministry of Environment, in 1999 by the NCSR. This report, which was based <b>on</b> <b>inventory</b> and surveys as well as brochures and other documents developed by the managing team of the reserve, produced a list of 32 mammals which include: wild boar (Sus scrofa), gray wolf (Canis lupus [...] ), beech marten (Martes foina), mountain gazelle (Gazella gazella), golden jackal (Canis aureus), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), European badger (Meles meles), Cape hare (Lepus capensis), Caucasian squirrel (Sciurus anomalus), roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), Persian fallow deer (Dama dama mesopotamica), wild goat (Capra aegagrus), Syrian brown bear (Ursus arctos syriacus), Middle East blind mole-rat (Nannospalax ehrenbergi) Indian porcupine (Hystrix indica), striped hyena (Hyaena hyaena), wild cat (Felis silvestris), Cape hyrax (Procavia capensis). The reserve launched a project to reintroduce the Nubian ibex (Capra nubiana) to the area from Jordan, after it was extinct in the mid-twentieth century. The reserve was most probably home to the Anatolian leopard (Panthera pardus tulliana) which are extinct now in Lebanon. The aurochs (Bos primigenius) may have existed in the area in the middle ages as well.|$|E

40|$|Net {{investment}} in inventories {{is one of}} the more volatile components of GDP, giving it an important role in short-run variation in the growth of GDP and in the timing and duration of economic downturns. Its most distinctive feature may, however, be the number of conceptual and practical difficulties that arise in its measurement both in nominal terms and in real terms. Net {{investment in}} inventories is also known as change in inventories (CII). The first part of this paper concerns the measurement of nominal CII at the annual frequency. The principle that the economic value of production is measured at the prices existing when the production occurred means that the definition of nominal CII must keep holding gains and losses <b>on</b> <b>inventories</b> out of the measure of GDP. Yet, however clear this requirement may be in the realm of theory, it does not translate literally into practice because the data are generally not precise enough to justify complete faith in the raw estimate of holding gains or losses <b>on</b> <b>inventories.</b> If the estimate of holding gains or losses <b>on</b> <b>inventories</b> is large, the implicit price for the annual CII it is likely to be extreme or negative. We wish to avoid the inconvenience that this causes unless we have some assurance that the large estimate is not a result of an unlucky draw of random errors in the underlying data...|$|R
