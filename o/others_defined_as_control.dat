40|$|America was Promises': The Ideology of Equal Opportunity, 1877 - 1905 " {{seeks to}} untangle {{one of the}} {{enduring}} ideas in American history [...] equal economic opportunity [...] by exploring the varied discourses about its meaning during the upheavals caused by the corporate consolidation of the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries. In so doing, a new framework is proposed through which to comprehend {{the social and political}} disruptions wrought by the transition from an entrepreneurial to a corporate society. This framework centers on a series of tensions that have permeated the idea of opportunity in the American context. As an expression of capitalism, the ideology of equal opportunity historically occupies conflicted terrain as it endeavors to promote upward mobility by permitting more people to participate in the economic sphere and emphasizing merit over inherited wealth, while it concurrently acts as a mechanism to maintain economic inequality. This tension allowed the rhetoric of opportunity to animate social dissent among rural and urban workers [...] the origins of Progressive reform [...] even as it simultaneously served efforts by business elites to temper this dissent. The dissertation examines the discourses about the ideology of equal opportunity of prominent figures and groups located along a spectrum of political belief. Some grounded opportunity in land ownership (Booker T. Washington); <b>others</b> <b>defined</b> it <b>as</b> <b>control</b> of one's own labor (Knights of Labor); while others connected opportunity to increased leisure and consumption (Samuel Gompers and business elites). As this occurred, the site of opportunity shifted away from entrepreneurship toward competition for advancement and investment within the corporation. Most social activists and reformers stressed the conditions necessary for equal opportunity to thrive. They thus reinforced assumptions about the benefits of economic competition and differentially rewarding individuals, even as they objected to the results of that system. And, certainly, some of these arguments led to progressive changes. But because the necessary outcome of equal opportunity was an inequality of economic result, to move beyond the boundaries of equal opportunity ideology demanded a rare willingness (Edward Bellamy) to question the system of economic competition itself...|$|R

If left untreated, TTTS is associated with very high perinatal mortality and morbidity rates, due to a combination of fetal and/or obstetric complications. The reported prevalence is 10 - 15 % of all MC twins, or about 1 in 2000 pregnancies. This consensus document reviews available evidence and offers practical guidance to clinicians by providing recommendations on various aspects concerning diagnosis and management of TTTS. status: publishe...|$|R

The second, title, is the expectation that others will recognize rights to control resource, even when it is not in possession. He elaborates the differences between these two concepts, and proposes a history of how they came to be attached to persons, as opposed to families or to entities such as the church.|$|R

In connection oriented network only the control packets are sent with the control wavelengths, data or messages are sent with other wavelengths. On the other hand, in datagram network, all the packets are sent with the control wavelengths. The allocation of wavelengths may be fully dynamic. Comment: 10 Page...|$|R

40|$|Cooling {{systems are}} an {{essential}} element in many facets of modern society including cars, computers and buildings. Cooling systems are usually divided into two types: passive and active. Passive cooling transfers heat without using any additional energy while active cooling {{is a type of}} heat transfer that uses powered devices such as fans or pumps. This paper will focus on one particular type of passive cooling: air-conditioning systems. An air-conditioning system is <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>controlled</b> air movement, temperature, humidity and cleanliness of a building area. Air conditioning consists of cooling and heating. Therefore, the air-conditioning system should be able to add and remove heat from the area. An air-conditioning system is <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> a <b>control</b> or treatment of air in a confined space. The process that occurs is the air-conditioning system absorbs heat and dust while, at the same time, cleaning the air breathed into a closed space. The purpose of air-conditioning is to maintain a comfortable atmosphere for human life and to meet user requirements. In this paper, air-conditioning systems for non-residential buildings will be presented and discussed...|$|R
