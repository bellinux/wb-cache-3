5|$|Eventually, Dexagoridas, {{one of the}} two {{garrison}} commanders, {{sent word}} to the Roman legate {{that he was willing to}} surrender the city. This plan fell through when Gorgopas, the other commander, learned of it and slew Dexagoridas with his <b>own</b> <b>hands.</b> Gorgopas continued to resist fiercely until Flamininus arrived with 4,000 additional troops that he had recently recruited. The Romans renewed their assault and Gorgopas was forced to surrender, though he did secure the condition that he and his garrison could leave unharmed and return to Sparta.|$|E
5|$|His campaigns conquered much French territory, but by 1374, all {{the gains}} had been lost. Edward's reign was also {{marked by the}} further {{development}} of Parliament, which came to {{be divided into two}} Houses. In 1377, Edward III died, leaving the Crown to his 10-year-old grandson Richard II. Like many of his predecessors, Richard II conflicted with the nobles by attempting to concentrate power in his <b>own</b> <b>hands.</b> In 1399, while he was campaigning in Ireland, his cousin Henry Bolingbroke seized power. Richard was deposed, imprisoned, and eventually murdered, probably by starvation, and Henry became king as Henry IV.|$|E

5|$|On March 3, Michigan {{defeated}} Michigan State (#9 AP/#10 Coaches) in the Ann Arbor rematch {{of their}} rivalry series as Trey Burke made 2 steals {{in the final}} 30 seconds to secure the 58–57 victory.

On March 6, with its Big 10 Conference Championship destiny in its <b>own</b> <b>hands,</b> Michigan defeated Purdue to set up a championship showdown with Indiana on March 10. Michigan concluded its road schedule with a 5–5 record.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, Voss signed {{himself out}} on leave on his authority as Staffelführer. His first stop was Berlin, {{where he was}} honored receiving an autographed photograph of Kaiser Wilhelm II from the emperor's <b>own</b> <b>hands.</b> From the 15th to the 17th, {{he was at the}} Fokker factory in Schwerin; he was accompanied by his girlfriend Ilse. His leave authorization also cleared him for Düsseldorf and his hometown of Krefeld, but it is unknown if he visited them. In any case, he returned to duty on 22 September 1917.|$|E
5|$|The series—presented {{as if it}} were a real documentary—depicts the {{everyday}} lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In the episode, after Robert California (James Spader) challenges the Dunder Mifflin staffers to double their sales, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), taking matters into his <b>own</b> <b>hands,</b> creates an incentive program.

Meanwhile, Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) strikes up an unlikely friendship with Angela Lipton (Angela Kinsey), both of whom are pregnant.|$|E

5|$|The {{value to}} the sinecurist of an office like that of Paymaster of Marines lay {{not so much in}} the {{official}} salary attached to it, but in the lax accounting procedures associated with disbursement of funds, which allowed the official to retain large sums of public money in his <b>own</b> <b>hands</b> for many years until accounts were made up. The office of Paymaster General had been reformed in 1783 to avoid these abuses, but these changes had not yet been extended to the Marines during Villiers' tenure.|$|E
5|$|When Otho was {{defeated}} by Vitellius at the First Battle of Bedriacum, the armies in Judaea and Egypt took matters into their <b>own</b> <b>hands</b> and declared Vespasian emperor on 1 July 69. Vespasian accepted and entered an alliance with Gaius Licinius Mucianus, the governor of Syria, against Vitellius. A strong force drawn from the Judaean and Syrian legions marched on Rome {{under the command of}} Mucianus, while Vespasian travelled to Alexandria, leaving Titus in charge of ending the Jewish rebellion.|$|E

Having learned of the threat, Mega Man's rival Bass decides to take matters into his <b>own</b> <b>hands.</b> The game is an action-platformer where the player advances by defeating bosses and acquiring their signature weapons. Mega Man & Bass lets the player choose between either of its title characters, each of which plays differently from the other.|$|E

5|$|Aqil angered the kaimakam (district governor) of Acre, Muhammad Kubrisi, for his {{intervention}} {{in a dispute}} between two factions of the Catholic Church in Nazareth. One {{of the leaders of}} the Catholic factions, Sheikh Yusef Elias, had been dismissed by the church and subsequently entered Aqil's protection. He requested Aqil's intercession with Kubrisi, which was unsuccessful. When Sheikh Yusef decided to take matters into his <b>own</b> <b>hands</b> by raising a group of armed partisans in Nazareth, the church was compelled to restore his employment. Kubrisi believed Aqil had backed Sheikh Yusef's actions and accused Aqil of sedition. Kubrisi recalled Aqil and his Hawwara irregulars to Acre, verbally lambasted them and dismissed them all from service. Aqil was deeply insulted by Kubrisi's words and actions, and subsequently left for Transjordan where he sought the protection of the Beni Sakhr tribe.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{continued}} defacement, fans rushed to the sites of the installments as soon as they are announced. A group of men took advantage of this and threatened to deface a stencil painting of a beaver in East New York, charging money for people to take photographs. Some took matters into their <b>own</b> <b>hands</b> by guarding the works, others restoring them once defaced. In part because of the defacement, but also because of the great value of the artworks, property owners have also gone to extreme measures to protect the art. Some hired security guards, others covered the art with acrylic glass, and yet others installed metal roll-down gates.|$|E
5|$|Just when Caroline {{thinks she}} {{has managed to}} win Mac back, his former girlfriend Holly (Sally Phillips) returns to the hospital, to replace Angela. Things become even worse when it is {{discovered}} that she never had the abortion that {{was the cause of}} Mac and Holly's breakup years ago, and that Mac has a son. Caroline distances herself from Mac, and Guy starts {{to fall in love with}} her. Caroline however seems to have feelings for Jake Leaf (Darren Boyd), a complementary therapist. Guy takes actions into his <b>own</b> <b>hands</b> and throws a Swiss army knife into Jake's head. Sue then discovers that Holly is lying, that Mac is not her son's father after all. Holly leaves the hospital. Caroline dumps Jake and then tries to impress Mac again.|$|E

5|$|The {{events that}} would cost Cumanus his office began {{with the murder of}} one or more Galilean pilgrims who had been {{travelling}} through Samaria on their way to Jerusalem. A Galilean embassy asked Cumanus to investigate but received little attention; Josephus alleges that he had been bribed by the Samaritans to turn a blind eye. The result was that a crowd of Jews decided to take the law into their <b>own</b> <b>hands.</b> Under the leadership of two Zealots, Eleazar and Alexander, they invaded Samaria and began a massacre. Cumanus led most of his troops against the militants, killing many and taking others prisoner, and the Jewish leaders from Jerusalem were subsequently able to calm most of the others, but a state of guerrilla warfare persisted.|$|E
5|$|The gunfight {{was not the}} end of the conflict. On December 28, 1881, Virgil Earp was ambushed and maimed in {{a murder}} attempt by the Cowboys. On March 18, 1882, Cowboys fired from a dark alley through the glass door of a saloon, killing Morgan Earp. The {{suspects}} in both incidents furnished alibis supplied by other Cowboys and were not indicted. Wyatt Earp, newly appointed as Deputy U.S. Marshal in Cochise County, then took matters into his <b>own</b> <b>hands</b> in a personal vendetta. He was pursued by county sheriff Johnny Behan, who had received a warrant from Tucson for Wyatt's shooting of Frank Stilwell.|$|E
5|$|The name Book of Kells {{is derived}} from the Abbey of Kells in Kells, County Meath, which was its home for much of the medieval period. The manuscript's date and place of {{production}} {{have been the subject of}} considerable debate. Traditionally, the book was thought to have been created in the time of Columba, possibly even as the work of his <b>own</b> <b>hands.</b> This tradition has long been discredited on paleographic and stylistic grounds: most evidence points to a composition date 800, long after St. Columba's death in 597. The proposed dating in the 9th century coincides with Viking raids on Iona, which began in 794 and eventually dispersed the monks and their holy relics into Ireland and Scotland. There is another tradition, with some traction among Irish scholars, that suggests the manuscript was created for the 200th anniversary of the saint's death.|$|E

5|$|Through {{relatives}} Playford met {{his future}} wife Lorna Clark, who lived with her family in Nailsworth. Although both families were religiously devout, the Clarks were {{even more so than}} the Playfords, and a long courtship ensued. Taking her out on his Harley Davidson motorcycle at night, the two were forced to leave the theatre halfway through performances so as to not raise the ire of the Clarks. Before their wedding on 1 January 1928, they were engaged for three years. During their engagement, Playford built their new house on his property, mostly by his <b>own</b> <b>hands</b> and indented in the hills themselves; it remained their home throughout their lives.|$|E
5|$|With the Observer Corps {{passing a}} steady stream of reports {{regarding}} approaching German formations they soon realised a coordinated attack was under way. The two Squadrons approaching the high-altitude attack could not be diverted and no fighters had been asked to engage the 9 Staffel. The only Squadron {{on the ground in the}} area was No. 111 Squadron RAF that had 12 Hurricanes at RAF Croydon. Although usually the responsibility of Park, the controllers took the matter into their <b>own</b> <b>hands</b> and ordered all aircraft into the air. Even those that were not in combat condition were flown north-east, to avoid them being caught on the ground.|$|E
5|$|However, Russell also {{received}} negative attention. Constantly provoked by New York Knicks center Ray Felix during a game, he complained to coach Auerbach. The latter {{told him to}} take matters into his <b>own</b> <b>hands,</b> so after the next provocation, Russell punched Felix unconscious, paid a $25 fine and was no longer a target of cheap fouls. With his teammates, Russell had a cordial relationship, with the notable exception of fellow rookie and old rival Heinsohn. Heinsohn felt that Russell resented him because the former was named the 1957 NBA Rookie of the Year: many people thought that Russell was more important, but Russell also had only played half the season. Russell also ignored Heinsohn's plea to give his cousin an autograph, and openly said to Heinsohn that he deserved half of his $300 Rookie of the Year check. The relationship between the two rookies remained reserved. On the other hand, despite their different ethnic backgrounds and lack of common off-court interests, his relationship with Celtics point guard and fan favorite Bob Cousy was amicable.|$|E
