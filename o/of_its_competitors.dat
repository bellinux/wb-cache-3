5|$|During the {{transition}} from MS-DOS to Windows, the success of Microsoft's product Microsoft Office allowed the company to gain ground on application-software competitors, such as WordPerfect and Lotus 1-2-3. Novell, an owner of WordPerfect for a time, alleged that Microsoft used its inside knowledge of the DOS and Windows kernels and of undocumented Application Programming Interface features to make Office perform better than its competitors. Eventually, Microsoft Office became the dominant business suite, with a market share far exceeding that <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>competitors.</b> In March 1992, Microsoft released Windows 3.1 along with its first promotional campaign on TV; the software sold over three million copies in its first two months on the market. In October, Windows for Workgroups 3.1 was released with integrated networking abilities such as peer-to-peer file and printing sharing. In November, Microsoft released {{the first version of}} their popular database software Microsoft Access.|$|E
5|$|Fantastic Universe was a U.S. {{science fiction}} {{magazine}} which began publishing in the 1950s. It ran for 69 issues, from June 1953 to March 1960, under two different publishers. It {{was part of}} the explosion of science fiction magazine publishing in the 1950s in the United States, and was moderately successful, outlasting almost all <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>competitors.</b> The main editors were Leo Margulies (1954–1956) and Hans Stefan Santesson (1956–1960); under Santesson's tenure the quality declined somewhat, and the magazine became known for printing much UFO-related material. A collection of stories from the magazine, edited by Santesson, appeared in 1960 from Prentice-Hall, titled The Fantastic Universe Omnibus.|$|E
5|$|Initially the {{sandwich}} {{was made with}} a plain bun; however, that changed when the company switched to a sesame-seeded bun around 1970. In 1985, {{the weight of the}} Whopper was increased to , while the bun was replaced by a Kaiser roll. This was part of a program to improve the product and featured a US$30 million (approx US$66 million in 2014) advertising campaign featuring various celebrities such as Mr. T and Loretta Swit. The goal of the program was to help differentiate the company and its products from those <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>competitors.</b> The Whopper reverted to its previous size in 1987 when a new management team took over the company and reverted many of the changes initiated prior to 1985. The Whopper sandwich's Kaiser roll was changed back into a sesame seed bun in 1994, eliminating the last trace of {{the sandwich}}'s 1985 reconfiguration.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, PETA {{went before}} Burger King's board of {{directors}} during its parent company's annual corporate meeting to request that poultry suppliers switched to a more-humane method of slaughter called controlled atmosphere killing (CAK). Instead of using its previous tactic of stating that the procedure is more humane, {{the group claimed that}} CAK was economically more feasible as it reduces the chances of injury to workers in poultry factories and it produces better products by preventing injury to the animal. Responding to the proposal in March 2007, Burger King announced it would make further changes to its animal-welfare policies. The new policies favor suppliers of chickens that utilize CAK rather than electric shock to knock birds unconscious before slaughter, and require its pork and poultry suppliers to upgrade the living conditions of pigs and chickens. Under the agreement, 2% of BK's North American egg suppliers are to use cage-free-produced eggs and 10% of pork suppliers are to use crate-free pigs for its pork products. PETA and the Humane Society of the United States were quoted as saying that Burger King’s initiatives put it ahead <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>competitors</b> in terms of animal rights and welfare and that they were hopeful that the new initiatives would trigger reform throughout the fast food industry as a whole.|$|E
