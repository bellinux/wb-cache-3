5|$|Brütal Legend was {{generally}} well received by game reviewers, praising Schafer's vision and {{writing of the}} heavy metal-inspired world, and the performances <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> cast, particularly Black and Osbourne.

5|$|In {{regards to}} the English dub, Shinkai {{did not feel that}} he could judge the quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> acting since he could not speak English natively.

However, he noted that the experience would be different for viewers and that the final judgment could only be made by English-speaking audiences.|$|E

5|$|The 7 {{trillion}} year {{figure was}} first changed to 7 billion {{years and then}} to 3 million and the characters of Arnold Rimmer and the Cat were created. The name Dave Hollins was changed to Dave Lister when a football player called Dave Hollins became well-known, and Hab was replaced by Holly. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> actors from Son of Cliché, Chris Barrie went on to portray Arnold Rimmer in the Red Dwarf TV series.|$|E

5|$|Between 1965 and 1967, APF Records {{released}} 19 audio {{episodes in}} the form of vinyl EPs. Three are original stories; the rest are adapted from TV episode soundtracks, with additional narration provided by a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> cast.

5|$|However, {{interviews}} with the two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> actors have given a glimpse into small parts of the development process. An interview with Robert Clotworthy, the voice of Jim Raynor in all released StarCraft games to date, has revealed {{that for the most}} part the voicing for the characters was done over only a few days in sessions of up to four hours, a fact mirrored in a similar interview with Sarah Kerrigan's actress, Glynnis Talken Campbell. Clotworthy also stated how the concept art for the game usually used for the visual development of characters and locales in games was used by him in order to develop the personality of his character.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, while America {{geared up}} for front line {{involvement}} in World War II, Pflueger received fewer assignments {{than he had}} been seeing previously. Grover Magnin kept a flow of work with I. Magnin designs, and Pflueger also helped the Army with a depot building in Ogden, Utah. He began to draw up plans for a 12-story cross-shaped medical teaching hospital for the University of California, San Francisco (eventually to be built at 505 Parnassus in 1955 with additional design work performed by his brother Milton Pflueger). His firm accepted a commission to excavate below the Mark Hopkins Hotel {{in order to create a}} bomb-resistant radio transmission center for AM station KSFO and shortwave programs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Voice</b> of America. This space became the hotel's underground parking garage after the war.|$|E
5|$|In the {{interest}} of transatlantic appeal, {{it was decided that}} the main characters would be mostly American and therefore actors capable of producing an appropriate accent were used. British, Canadian and Australian actors formed most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> cast; the only American involved was stage actor David Holliday, who was noticed in London's West End and given the part of Virgil Tracy. Following the completion of the first series, Holliday returned to the US. The character was voiced by English-Canadian actor Jeremy Wilkin for Thunderbirds Are Go, Series Two and Thunderbird 6.|$|E
