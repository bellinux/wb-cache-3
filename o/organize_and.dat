5|$|A large upper-level low {{separated}} from a trough north of Puerto Rico in early July. Convection increased on July7 after a surface trough developed, {{and a low}} pressure area formed east of the Bahamas once the upper-level low retreated to the southwest. Wind shear decreased across the region, allowing the convection to increase and <b>organize,</b> <b>and</b> it is estimated the system developed into a tropical depression on July11 about 330miles (530km) southwest of Bermuda. After developing, the cyclone moved northeastward in advance of an approaching cold front. It quickly intensified into Tropical Storm Bill, and briefly threatened to pass near Bermuda. As a result, a tropical storm warning was issued, although it was quickly dropped; there was {{no impact on the}} island from Bill.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on September 17. It moved across the shear-ridden Atlantic Ocean without development, and remained disorganized until reaching the western Caribbean Sea on September 26. There, the wave situated itself beneath an upper-level anticyclone, allowing for favorable upper-level outflow and for deep convection to develop. On the September 27, a low pressure area developed while the system was located a few hundred miles to the east of the Yucatán Peninsula. The system continued to <b>organize,</b> <b>and</b> nearly developed into a tropical depression before moving ashore on the Yucatán Peninsula on September 29.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on September 19. The wave moved westward, but was difficult to track due to its proximity to Hurricane Lisa and another large tropical wave. It passed through the Lesser Antilles, and slowly organized as convection increased due to an upper level low. On October 5, it entered the Gulf of Mexico, and developed an area of low pressure two days later. The system continued to <b>organize,</b> <b>and</b> on October 8, after developing a circulation, it developed into Tropical Depression Fourteen while located 205miles (330km) to the southeast of Brownsville, Texas.|$|E
5|$|A weak surface trough, located to {{the west}} of an upper-level low, {{developed}} convection to the east of the Bahamas on July 26. A tropical wave entered the area two days later, resulting in an increase of convective organization and area. Although conditions were not favorable for tropical cyclone formation, it sped to the northwest and steadily organized, developing a surface area of low pressure on the 30th. On July 31, the system continued to <b>organize,</b> <b>and</b> developed into Tropical Depression One while located 200miles (320km) to the east of Jacksonville, Florida.|$|E
5|$|A westward-moving {{tropical}} wave {{exited the}} coast of Africa on July 17. It tracked across the unfavorable Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea without development, and after crossing Central America, it entered the eastern Pacific Ocean on July 25. The cloud pattern and convection began to become better organized on July 28, and shortly thereafter a mid-level circulation developed. It continued to <b>organize,</b> <b>and</b> subsequent {{to the development of}} a low-level circulation it formed into Tropical Depression Seven-E while located about 975miles (1,575km) south-southeast of Cabo San Lucas on July 29. Operationally, tropical cyclone advisories were not initiated until visible satellite images confirmed the low-level circulation twelve hours after the depression formed.|$|E

5|$|Around 1200UTC the {{following}} day, Linfa further intensified into a severe tropical storm. A microwave satellite {{image of the}} storm depicted an eye-feature surrounded by deep convection. Interacting with a nearby upper-level low, poleward outflow significantly improved late on June19, fueling further strengthening. Slowly tracking in a general northward direction, Linfa continued to <b>organize</b> <b>and</b> by June20, the JTWC upgraded Linfa to a typhoon. A small, ragged eye appeared on visible satellite images by this time and several hours later, the storm reached its peak intensity just below typhoon-status according to the JMA. Maximum sustained winds peaked at 110km/h (70mph 10-minute winds) and a barometric pressure of 975hPa (mbar).|$|E

The first modern Navajo government convened in 1923 {{in an effort to}} <b>organize</b> <b>and</b> regulate an increasing amount of oil exploration activities on Navajo lands, and they would play a big role in the monument's further development.|$|E
5|$|During the American Civil War, Indianapolis, {{the state}} capital of Indiana, was a major base {{of support for the}} Union. Governor Oliver P. Morton, a major {{supporter}} of President Abraham Lincoln, quickly made Indianapolis a gathering place to <b>organize</b> <b>and</b> train troops for the Union army. The city became a major railroad hub for troop transport to Confederate lands, and therefore had military importance. Twenty-four military camps were established in the vicinity of Indianapolis. Camp Morton, the initial mustering ground to <b>organize</b> <b>and</b> train the state's Union volunteers in 1861, was designated as a major prisoner-of-war camp for captured Confederate soldiers in 1862. In addition to military camps, a state-owned arsenal was established in the city in 1861, and a federal arsenal in 1862. A Soldiers' Home and a Ladies' Home were established in Indianapolis to house and feed Union soldiers and their families as they passed through the city. Indianapolis residents also supported the Union cause by providing soldiers with food, clothing, equipment, and supplies, despite rising prices and wartime hardships, such as food and clothing shortages. Local doctors aided the sick, some area women provided nursing care, and Indianapolis City Hospital tended to wounded soldiers. Indianapolis sent an estimated 4,000 men into military service; an estimated 700 died during the war. Indianapolis's Crown Hill National Cemetery was established as one of two national military cemeteries established in Indiana in 1866.|$|E

5|$|Early in the season, a {{low-pressure}} area {{formed and}} persisted north of Honduras. Despite moderate wind shear, the low managed to <b>organize,</b> <b>and</b> was designated Tropical Depression One on June 8. The storm strengthened further, {{and it was}} upgraded to Tropical Storm Arlene on the following day. From this point, Arlene headed north, intensifying steadily as it spread tropical storm-force winds and heavy rains to the Cayman Islands and Cuba. Arlene made landfall in Cuba near Cabo Corrientes with 50mph (80km/h) winds. Wind shear weakened as the storm entered the Gulf of Mexico {{on the morning of}} June 10, and the storm intensified to just under hurricane strength with 70mph (110km/h) winds.|$|E
5|$|Eight {{commercial}} {{contractors are}} currently {{licensed by the}} International Seabed Authority (an intergovernmental organization established to <b>organize</b> <b>and</b> control all mineral-related activities in the international seabed area {{beyond the limits of}} national jurisdiction) to explore nodule resources and to test mining techniques in eight claim areas, each covering 150,000km². When mining ultimately begins, each mining operation is projected to directly disrupt 300–800km² of seafloor per year and disturb the benthic fauna over an area 5–10 times that size due to redeposition of suspended sediments. Thus, over the 15-year projected duration of a single mining operation, nodule mining might severely damage abyssal seafloor communities over areas of 20,000 to 45,000km² (a zone at least the size of Massachusetts).|$|E

5|$|On June 29, 2005, a {{tropical}} wave emerged off {{the west coast}} of Africa. Gradually, the system organized on July 2 and formed a broad low pressure area. The system continued to <b>organize,</b> <b>and</b> became {{a tropical}} depression on July 4. Tracking westward, it became a tropical storm on July 5 and a hurricane on July 7. Dennis rapidly intensified to attain Category4 status on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale before making landfall on Cuba. The storm weakened to Category1 status before re-emerging in the Gulf of Mexico and intensifying. Dennis made landfall on the Florida Panhandle on July 10 before tracking over Alabama as a minimal hurricane.|$|E
