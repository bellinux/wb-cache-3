The game's art director Yuta Saito said, [...] "From DOA4 we wanted to evolve the characters in a slightly realistic direction. The most difficult, and you don't have to ask, is Kasumi. Kasumi {{is the face of}} DOA and the eternal heroine. And for such a popular character like Kasumi, to change her form we really needed a lot of courage and it really was a big challenge. But if we didn't do that, we couldn't make DOA5 and we wouldn't be able to show you anything." [...] Producer Yasuke Hayashi said the processn of remodeling Kasumi has sparked most disputes in the development team, especially since she is [...] "a character that is not so much <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> with [...] hidden feelings, and it's been difficult to express such a 'hidden look'." [...] GamesRadar noted that [...] "the manga influences on her facial featureswhile still apparenthave been scaled right back nd her boobs seem less ludicrously unmanageable."

2500|$|Jordan Thomas, BioShock 2s {{creative}} director, {{said that}} the first concern with a sequel to BioShock was [...] "where do you go with this? How do you bring people back to an experience and terrify them and shock {{them in a way}} that they’re not expecting, but also fulfill the many expectations they’re projecting onto it?" [...] Early on, Thomas decided that it couldn't be a BioShock game without the city of Rapture, and that there were many unseen locations and untold stories that could remained with the setting. The developers wanted to bring some of the mystery back to the location of Rapture, and maintain a balance of surprising old players while introducing the setting to newcomers. Thomas and environmental artist Hogarth De La Plante agreed that the setting of Rapture was fertile ground for new ideas, and that as they were both veterans of the original game, they were excited to add never-before-seen parts of the city and push the artistic style they had developed. [...] "Any idea was <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> at that point, and I think nobody has played BioShock more than the developers that made it, so I feel like in one respect we are a pretty good litmus test for whether it’s still an interesting place or not," [...] La Plante recalled. [...] "And if that doesn’t bore us and we’re the people that played it for thousands upon thousands of hours, then I think we have a pretty good perspective on how interesting that location really is." ...|$|E
2500|$|Prior to obtaining {{his record}} deal, Mika sent demos to many record {{companies}} in Britain, but was never signed. One record label in particular claimed that Mika {{had a good}} voice, but insisted he write more conventional songs like Robbie Williams {{in order to become}} more commercial. Mika rejected this advice. [...] The song [...] "Grace Kelly" [...] was inspired by these problems. In 2006 Mika signed with Island Records and began recording his debut album. His musical influences are based in classical music. Before Mika released his debut album he promised the media that [...] "It was a magical world that you could live in. A parallel universe for people that is illusory and enchanting and amazing." [...] Some songs on the album are sexually ambiguous, prompting some questioning regarding Mika's sexuality. On this, Mika comments that he has no taboos about what he can use to tell a story or what stories he can actually tell. He believes that sexualizing music is great, but politically sexualizing music and making the artist's sexuality the defining point of someone's music is [...] "boring". He says about his own sexuality: [...] "...laying myself <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> to almost a tabloid level and kind of sharing my entire personal life, I'm really not into that." [...] The songs on the album have different subjects. [...] "Grace Kelly", as stated before, is about the struggle of getting a record deal. Mika stated that the song is a very important song on the album mostly because:"...it's a flagpole for the record in terms of lyrical content and the whole pop vision I wanted to get across." [...] The cover for the album and booklet was designed by Mika's sister, Yasmine, who works under the pen name DaWack, Richard Hogg and Mika himself. In March 2007 the album was released in the United States. Before its release there was much publicity about the album, mainly due to its success in Europe. Mika commented on the hype by saying: [...] "I think I'm lucky. Hype can be good and hype can be bad. The good thing that's happening to me is that the hype is about the project, it's about the music ... I'm not the son of anyone famous, I haven't really slept with anyone particularly well known ... it's really just about music, and that's something I think is very healthy." ...|$|E

2500|$|In July 2009, Chad was scripted {{as the son}} of Bill and Marsha Peterson. In June 2009 it was {{announced}} that David Leisure had been cast in the recurring role of D.A. Woods. In October 2009, the character's name was revised to Chad Peterson Woods when D.A. Woods was revealed to be his father. In February 2010 Soap Opera Digest reported that veteran soap actress, Jessica Tuck, known for her role as One Life to Live's Megan Gordon was cast in the role of Chad's mother. Deidrick explained that Chad goes to Kate for answers because she has been a [...] "mother figure." [...] Both the actor and executive producer Gary Tomlin enjoyed Chad's scenes with Koslow's Kate. Chad immediately confronts Madeline and he is [...] "completely devastated" [...] when she admits to being a former prostitute. Chad is fed up with his mother's lies and just wants everything <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> The revelation really impacts him in an [...] "inexplicable" [...] way. Deidrick described Chad's reaction as [...] "flabbergasted" [...] and wants to get away from her. When Chad witnesses Madeline's fall, he freezes for a moment because he is unable to [...] "process" [...] the situation. Such tragedy could have the potential to screw him up. Because Deidrick did not know the pain of losing a parent, let alone his own mother, the actor does his best to portray Chad during the scenes; Deidrick's first reaction as Chad is going into denial. Chad clings on to the little bit of courage he has left hoping to work things out with Charles in the future. According to Deidrick, the aftermath of his mother's death and his confrontation with Charles makes Chad a little [...] "cuckoo crazy." [...] Knowing Chad is all alone in the world Kate schemes to expose that Chad is Madeline's son with Kate's husband, Stefano DiMera (Joseph Mascolo) born on March 3, 1990, making him a whole year older than was initially said to be. The storyline showcased two very distinct sides to Chad's personality. According to Deidrick, during scenes with Kate, he intentionally emphasized Chad's vulnerabilities due to his mother's recent death; he is in desperate need of a mother figure at the moment, and Kate fills that void. Chad does not show that side of his personality too often for fear of getting hurt. On the other hand, Chad's relationship with his new found father Stefano appears to be a bit more volatile. The nature of the relationship is first displayed in November 2010 when Chad confronts Stefano with a knife and demands blood for a DNA test. Chad has no idea how to react to the DNA results. According to Deidrick, [...] " [...] struggles to find the courage to be able to love [...] who had a relationship with his mother and never knew he existed." [...] Deidrick explained that Chad rejects Stefano based on instinct. It is all he knows thanks to D.A. Woods who always pushes him away when things get difficult. However, Stefano is not easily turned away. Deidrick expected the role to be short lived thinking the character was only to wrap up the baby switch storyline. However, he accredited Gary Tomlin with fighting for the character and believing in him as an actor. Deidrick said that it was Tomlin's idea to attach him to a main family, [...] "So they made [...] a DiMera." ...|$|E
