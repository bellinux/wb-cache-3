5|$|The {{determination}} of an individual's age by anthropologists {{depends on whether}} or not the individual was an adult <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>child.</b> The {{determination of}} the age of children, under the age of 21, is usually performed by examining the teeth. When teeth are not available, children can be aged based on which growth plates are sealed. The tibia plate seals around age 16 or 17 in girls and around 18 or 19 in boys. The clavicle is the last bone to complete growth and the plate is sealed around age 25. In addition, if a complete skeleton is available anthropologists can count the number of bones. While adults have 206 bones, the bones of a child have not yet fused resulting in a much higher number.|$|E
5|$|Khandoba is {{described}} as doing odd jobs under Banai's orders. Banai first assigns him the task of sweeping the entire vada. He is responsible for cleaning the sheep pens and taking the sheep and lambs for grazing. He completes all tasks by spreading his magical bhandara. The shepherds are astonished how a single old man can handle all the animals. Their vanity is crushed. Banai assigns him the additional responsibility {{of taking care of}} five hundred children. She commands if any sheep or lamb is lost <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> cries, she will not give him his food. But Khandoba fulfils the tasks again by spraying his bhandara. She assigns him the job of washing the sheep and lambs. Instead, Khandoba kills all her sheep and lambs to humble the shepherds and Banai. He skins the sheep and separates the meat. A repentant Banai begs his forgiveness; he agrees to revive her flock on the condition that Banai marries him. Khandoba revives the sheep by spreading his bhandara and reveals his true form.|$|E

25|$|Congenital adrenal {{hyperplasia}} due to 11β-hydroxylase deficiency {{is a form}} of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) {{which produces}} a higher than normal amount of androgen, resulting from a defect in the gene encoding the enzyme steroid 11β-hydroxylase which mediates the final step of cortisol synthesis in the adrenal. 11β-OH CAH results in hypertension due to excessive mineralocorticoid effects.

2500|$|By late 1946, agreed {{standards}} of training were established, which {{was followed by}} the opening of a training headquarters and the opening of an additional nine (9) training centres in Wales, Scotland, and then throughout Great Britain. The National Health Service Act of 1946 indicated that domestic help should be provided for households where that help is required [...] "owing to the presence of any person who is ill, lying-in, an expectant mother, mentally defective, aged <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> not over compulsory school age." [...] 'Home help' therefore included the provision of home-helps for nursing and expectant mothers and for mothers with {{children under the age of}} five, and by 1952 some 20,000 women were engaged in this service.|$|E
2500|$|A {{new baby}} is born <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> is adopted into an {{established}} family group, which contains a microcosm of social alignments found in many larger groups: the vertical relationship between grandparents and grandchildren, the horizontal relationship between siblings and cousins of a generation or age group, clusters of girls or boys and skill-based family alliances. The child grows up in this family, sees and learns the family lore as it is performed throughout the seasons and the life cycle. Not only is the family the first folk group of the child, it is [...] "the group in which important primary folkloric socialization takes place and individual aesthetic preference patterns for folkloric exchange are set." ...|$|E
2500|$|The second question, [...] "how is operant {{behavior}} controlled?" [...] arises because, {{to begin}} with, the behavior is [...] "emitted" [...] {{without reference to}} any particular stimulus. [...] Skinner answered this question by saying that a stimulus comes to control an operant if it is present when the response is reinforced and absent when it is not. [...] For example, if lever-pressing only brings food when a light is on, a rat, <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>child,</b> will learn to press the lever only when the light is on. Skinner summarized this relationship by saying that a discriminative stimulus (e.g. light) sets the occasion for the reinforcement (food) of the operant (lever-press). This [...] "three-term contingency" [...] (stimulus-response-reinforcer) is one of Skinner's most important concepts, and sets his theory apart from theories that use only pair-wise associations.|$|E

2500|$|From an {{evolutionary}} perspective, grief is perplexing because it appears costly, {{and it is}} not clear what benefits it provides the sufferer. Several researchers have proposed functional explanations for grief, attempting to solve this puzzle. Sigmund Freud argued that grief is a process of libidinal reinvestment. The griever must, Freud argued, disinvest from the deceased, which is a painful process. But this disinvestment allows the griever to use libidinal energies on other, possibly new attachments, so it provides a valuable function. John Archer, approaching grief from an attachment theory perspective, argued that grief is a byproduct of the human attachment system. [...] Generally, a grief-type response is adaptive because it compels a social organism to search for a lost individual (e.g., a mother <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>child).</b> However, in the case of death, the response is maladaptive because the individual is not simply lost and the griever cannot reunite with the deceased. Grief, from this perspective, is a painful cost of the human capacity to form commitments.|$|E
2500|$|Critical {{reaction}} was mixed. Some accused {{the music of}} being [...] "sickly and practically lifeless" [...] and of sounding [...] "like the noise of a squeaky door {{or a piece of}} furniture being moved about, <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> crying in the distance." [...] Camille Saint-Saëns, a relentless opponent of Debussy's music, claimed he had abandoned his customary summer holidays so he could stay in Paris and [...] "say nasty things about Pelléas." [...] But others — especially the younger generation of composers, students and aesthetes — were highly enthusiastic. Debussy's friend Paul Dukas lauded the opera, Romain Rolland described it as [...] "one of the three or four outstanding achievements in French musical history", and Vincent d'Indy wrote an extensive review which compared the work to Wagner and early-17th-century Italian opera. D'Indy found Pelléas moving, too: [...] "The composer has in fact simply felt and expressed the human feelings and human sufferings in human terms, despite the outward appearance the characters present of living in a dream." [...] The opera won a [...] "cult following" [...] among young aesthetes, and the writer Jean Lorrain satirised the [...] "Pelléastres" [...] who aped the costumes and hairstyles of Mary Garden {{and the rest of the}} cast.|$|E

[...] In 1993, Congress enacted the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, which required states to attempt to recoup [...] "the expense of long-term care and related costs for deceased Medicaid recipients 55 or older." [...] The Act also allowed states to recover other Medicaid expenses for deceased Medicaid recipients 55 or older, at each state's choice. However, states are prohibited from estate recovery when [...] "there is a surviving spouse, a child under the age of 21 <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> of any age who is blind or disabled" [...] and [...] "the law also carved out other exceptions for adult children who have served as caretakers in the homes of the deceased, property owned jointly by siblings, and income-producing property, such as farms." [...] Each state now maintains a Medicaid Estate Recovery Program, although the sum of money collected significantly varies from state to state, [...] "depending on how the state structures its program and how vigorously it pursues collections." ...|$|E
