5|$|Following Whitman's {{resignation}} and DiFrancesco's departure, John O. Bennett served as acting governor {{for three and}} a half days. During that time, he signed a few bills into law, gave a State of the State Address, and held parties at Drumthwacket, the New Jersey governor's mansion. Similarly, Richard J. Codey served as acting governor as well. Because control of the New Jersey State Senate was split, resulting in two Senate co-presidents, Codey and Bennett, each held the office of acting governor for three days. Perhaps this spectacle as much as any <b>other</b> <b>factor</b> led to the voters' decision to amend the state constitution to create the office of Lieutenant Governor of New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|Self-incompatible, Acacia pycnantha cannot {{fertilise}} {{itself and}} requires cross-pollination between plants to set seed. Birds facilitate this and field experiments keeping birds away from flowers greatly reduces seed production. Nectaries {{are located on}} phyllodes; those near open flowers become active, producing nectar that birds feed upon just before or during flowering. While feeding, birds brush against the flower heads and dislodge pollen and often visit multiple trees. Several species of honeyeater, including the white-naped, yellow-faced, New Holland, and occasionally white-plumed and crescent honeyeaters, and Eastern spinebills have been observed foraging. Other bird species include the silvereye, striated, buff-rumped and brown thornbills. As well as eating nectar, birds often pick off insects on the foliage. Honeybees, native bees, ants and flies also visit nectaries, but generally do not {{come into contact with}} the flowers during this activity. The presence of Acacia pycnantha is positively correlated with numbers of swift parrots overwintering in box–ironbark forest in central Victoria, though {{it is not clear whether}} the parrots are feeding on them or some <b>other</b> <b>factor</b> is at play.|$|E
30|$|As stated earlier, LPI is {{influenced}} by many <b>other</b> <b>factors.</b> Therefore, to improve the logistics performance index, <b>other</b> <b>factors</b> {{will also have to}} be involved.

25|$|Consider a {{multiplication}} {{where one}} of the factors has multiple digits, whereas the <b>other</b> <b>factor</b> has only one digit. Write down the multi-digit factor, then write the single-digit factor under the last digit of the multi-digit factor. Draw a horizontal line under the single-digit factor. Henceforth, the multi-digit factor will be called the multiplicand, and the single-digit factor will be called the multiplier.|$|E
25|$|There {{were two}} reasons for this shift in {{preferred}} subject. The first was that Mexican society denigrated colonial culture—the indigenous past was seen as more truly Mexican. The <b>other</b> <b>factor</b> was a worldwide movement among artists to confront society, which began around 1830. In Mexico, this anti-establishment sentiment was directed at the Academy of San Carlos and its European focus.|$|E
25|$|For a {{univariate}} polynomial, p(x), {{the factor}} theorem states that a is a {{root of the}} polynomial (that is, p(a) = 0, also called a zero of the polynomial) {{if and only if}} (x – a) is a factor of p(x). The <b>other</b> <b>factor</b> in such a factorization of p(x) can be obtained by polynomial long division or synthetic division.|$|E
50|$|Although many {{researchers}} consider light {{to be the}} strongest cue for entrainment, {{it is not the}} only factor acting on circadian rhythms. <b>Other</b> <b>factors</b> may enhance or decrease the effectiveness of entrainment. For instance, exercise and other physical activity, when coupled with light exposure, results in a somewhat stronger entrainment response. <b>Other</b> <b>factors</b> such as music and properly timed administration of the neurohormone melatonin have shown similar effects. Numerous <b>other</b> <b>factors</b> affect entrainment as well. These include feeding schedules, temperature, pharmacology, locomotor stimuli, social interaction, sexual stimuli and stress.|$|R

25|$|With the {{exception}} of a few Ashanti light skirmishes across the Pra in 1853 and 1854, the peace between the Ashanti Kingdom and the British Empire had remained unbroken for over 30 years. Then, in 1863, a large Ashanti delegation crossed the river pursuing a fugitive, Kwesi Gyana. There was fighting, casualties on both sides, but the governor's request for troops from England was declined and sickness forced the withdrawal of his West Indian troops. The war ended in 1864 as a stalemate with both sides losing more men to sickness than any <b>other</b> <b>factor.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{key factor}} was the disinterest of the parents, whose main {{motivation}} for sending {{their children to}} the Scoletas appears to have been that they were looked after for a few hours and given a meal every day, rather than an interest in preserving Romansh. The <b>other</b> <b>factor</b> was that after entering primary school, the children received a few hours a week of Romansh instruction at best. As a result, the last Scoletas were closed in the 1960s with the exception of Präz, where the Scoleta remained open until 1979.|$|E
25|$|Though the Allied {{force had}} {{advanced}} successfully into central Burma, it was vital {{to capture the}} port of Rangoon before the monsoon to avoid a logistics crisis.

In addition to the allied advance, the Japanese now faced open rebellion behind their lines.|$|E

25|$|Spearman's {{argument}} {{proposing a}} general factor of human intelligence is still accepted in principle by many psychometricians. Today's factor models of intelligence typically represent cognitive abilities as a three-level hierarchy, {{where there are}} {{a large number of}} narrow factors {{at the bottom of the}} hierarchy, a handful of broad, more general factors at the intermediate level, and at the apex a single factor, referred to as the g factor, which represents the variance common to all cognitive tasks. However, this view is not universally accepted; <b>other</b> <b>factor</b> analyses of the data, with different results, are possible. Some psychometricians regard g as a statistical artifact.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. Army Air Service had a {{brief but}} {{turbulent}} history. Created during World War I by executive order of 28th President Woodrow Wilson after American entrance in April 1917 as {{the increasing use of}} airplanes and the military uses of aviation were readily apparent as the war continued to its climax, the U.S. Army Air Service gained permanent legislative authority in 1920 as a combatant arm of the line of the United States Army. There followed a six-year struggle between adherents of airpower and the supporters of the traditional military services about the value of an independent Air Force, intensified by struggles for funds caused by skimpy budgets, as much an impetus for independence as any <b>other</b> <b>factor.</b>|$|E
25|$|Colonel Monckton {{captured}} Fort Beauséjour in June 1755 in {{the sole}} British success that year, {{cutting off the}} French fortress at Louisbourg from land-based reinforcements. To cut vital supplies to Louisbourg, Nova Scotia's Governor Charles Lawrence ordered the deportation of the French-speaking Acadian population from the area. Monckton's forces, including companies of Rogers' Rangers, forcibly removed thousands of Acadians, chasing down many who resisted and sometimes committing atrocities. More than any <b>other</b> <b>factor,</b> cutting off supplies to Louisbourg led to its demise. The Acadian resistance was sometimes quite stiff, in concert with Indian allies including the Mi'kmaq, with ongoing frontier raids against Dartmouth and Lunenburg, among others. The only clashes of any size were at Petitcodiac in 1755 and at Bloody Creek near Annapolis Royal in 1757, other than the campaigns to expel the Acadians ranging around the Bay of Fundy, on the Petitcodiac and St. John rivers, and Île Saint-Jean.|$|E
