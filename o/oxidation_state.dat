5|$|Like most rare-earth elements, {{praseodymium}} most readily {{forms the}} +3 <b>oxidation</b> <b>state,</b> {{which is the}} only stable state in aqueous solution, although the +4 <b>oxidation</b> <b>state</b> is known in some solid compounds and, uniquely among the lanthanides, the +5 <b>oxidation</b> <b>state</b> is attainable in matrix-isolation conditions. Aqueous praseodymium ions are yellowish-green, and similarly praseodymium results in various shades of yellow-green when incorporated into glasses. Many of praseodymium's industrial uses involve its ability to filter yellow light from light sources.|$|E
5|$|The +4 <b>oxidation</b> <b>state</b> dominates {{titanium}} chemistry, but {{compounds in}} the +3 <b>oxidation</b> <b>state</b> are also common. Commonly, titanium adopts an octahedral coordination geometry in its complexes, but tetrahedral TiCl4 is a notable exception. Because {{of its high}} <b>oxidation</b> <b>state,</b> titanium(IV) compounds exhibit {{a high degree of}} covalent bonding. Unlike most other transition metals, simple aquo Ti(IV) complexes are unknown.|$|E
5|$|The {{only other}} <b>oxidation</b> <b>state</b> known for {{seaborgium}} {{other than the}} group <b>oxidation</b> <b>state</b> of +6 is the zero <b>oxidation</b> <b>state.</b> Similarly to its three lighter congeners, forming chromium hexacarbonyl, molybdenum hexacarbonyl, and tungsten hexacarbonyl, seaborgium {{has been shown in}} 2014 to also form seaborgium hexacarbonyl, Sg(CO)6. Like its molybdenum and tungsten homologues, seaborgium hexacarbonyl is a volatile compound that reacts readily with silicon dioxide.|$|E

50|$|Selenium's <b>oxidation</b> <b>states</b> are −2, +4, and +6. Selenium, {{like most}} chalcogens, bonds with oxygen. There are some organic {{selenium}} compounds, such as selenoproteins. Tellurium's <b>oxidation</b> <b>states</b> are −2, +2, +4, and +6. Tellurium forms the oxides tellurium monoxide, tellurium dioxide, and tellurium trioxide. Polonium's <b>oxidation</b> <b>states</b> are +2 and +4.|$|R
50|$|Phosphinoimidate {{complexes}} {{of transition}} metals containing the R3P=N− ligand {{are known to}} adopt several bonding modes. In complexes with metal ions in low <b>oxidation</b> <b>states</b> (+I, +II), the R3P=N− group often serves as a μ3-N bridging ligand. For complexes of intermediate <b>oxidation</b> <b>states</b> (+III, +IV), the R3P=N− ligand bridges pairs of metals. For metals in high <b>oxidation</b> <b>states</b> (+V to +VIII), the R3P=N− group exists exclusively as the terminal ligand. Most phosphinoimidate complexes fall into two groups, one with a linear or largely linear M-N-P bridge with bond angles between 161 and 177° and another with a bent M-N-P configuration with bond angles between 130 and 140°. Linear M-N-P arrangements are achieved mainly by metals in high <b>oxidation</b> <b>states</b> while metals with lower <b>oxidation</b> <b>states</b> are characterized by bent M-N-P arrangements.|$|R
5|$|Actinium reacts rapidly {{with oxygen}} and {{moisture}} in air forming a white coating of actinium oxide that impedes further oxidation. As with most lanthanides and actinides, actinium {{exists in the}} <b>oxidation</b> <b>state</b> +3, and the Ac3+ ions are colorless in solutions. The <b>oxidation</b> <b>state</b> +3 originates from the 6d17s2 electronic configuration of actinium, with three valence electrons that are easily donated to give the stable closed-shell structure of the noble gas radon. The rare <b>oxidation</b> <b>state</b> +2 is only known for actinium dihydride (AcH2); even this may in reality be an electride compound like its lighter congener LaH2.|$|E
5|$|After Neil Bartlett's {{discovery}} in 1962 that xenon can form chemical compounds, {{a large number}} of xenon compounds have been discovered and described. Almost all known xenon compounds contain the electronegative atoms fluorine or oxygen. The chemistry of xenon in each <b>oxidation</b> <b>state</b> is analogous to that of the neighboring element iodine in the immediately lower <b>oxidation</b> <b>state.</b>|$|E
5|$|Europium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Eu and atomic number 63. It was isolated in 1901 and {{is named after}} the continent of Europe. It is a moderately hard, silvery metal which readily oxidizes in air and water. Being a typical member of the lanthanide series, europium usually assumes the <b>oxidation</b> <b>state</b> +3, but the <b>oxidation</b> <b>state</b> +2 is also common. All europium compounds with <b>oxidation</b> <b>state</b> +2 are slightly reducing. Europium has no significant biological role and is relatively non-toxic compared to other heavy metals. Most applications of europium exploit the phosphorescence of europium compounds. Europium {{is one of the}} least abundant elements in the universe; only about % of all matter in the universe is europium.|$|E
5|$|Although niobium {{exhibits}} all of {{the formal}} <b>oxidation</b> <b>states</b> from +5 to −1, the most common compounds have niobium in the +5 state. Characteristically, compounds in <b>oxidation</b> <b>states</b> less than 5+ display Nb–Nb bonding.|$|R
50|$|Arsenic {{typically}} {{occurs in}} the <b>oxidation</b> <b>states</b> (III) and (V), illustrated by the halides AsX3 (X = F, Cl, Br, I) and AsF5. Correspondingly, organoarsenic compounds are commonly found in these two <b>oxidation</b> <b>states.</b>|$|R
500|$|Several barium platinides {{have been}} {{synthesized}} in which platinum exhibits negative <b>oxidation</b> <b>states</b> ranging from −1 to −2. These include BaPt, , and [...] Caesium platinide, , a dark-red transparent crystalline compound {{has been shown}} to contain Pt anions. Platinum also exhibits negative <b>oxidation</b> <b>states</b> at surfaces reduced electrochemically. The negative <b>oxidation</b> <b>states</b> exhibited by platinum are unusual for metallic elements, and they are attributed to the relativistic stabilization of the 6s orbitals.|$|R
5|$|In {{the most}} {{familiar}} compounds, boron has the formal <b>oxidation</b> <b>state</b> III. These include oxides, sulfides, nitrides, and halides.|$|E
5|$|It was {{discovered}} in the debris of the first hydrogen bomb explosion in 1952, and named after Enrico Fermi, {{one of the pioneers}} of nuclear physics. Its chemistry is typical for the late actinides, with a preponderance of the +3 <b>oxidation</b> <b>state</b> but also an accessible +2 <b>oxidation</b> <b>state.</b> Owing to the small amounts of produced fermium and all of its isotopes having relatively short half-lives, there are currently no uses for it outside basic scientific research.|$|E
5|$|Samarium {{is one of}} the few {{lanthanides}} that {{exhibit the}} <b>oxidation</b> <b>state</b> +2. The Sm2+ ions are blood-red in aqueous solution.|$|E
500|$|Ammonium vanadate(V) (NH4VO3) can be {{successively}} reduced with elemental zinc {{to obtain}} the different colors of vanadium in these four <b>oxidation</b> <b>states.</b> Lower <b>oxidation</b> <b>states</b> occur in compounds such as V(CO)6, [...] and substituted derivatives.|$|R
50|$|The colour of {{the zones}} visible within ametrine {{are due to}} differing <b>oxidation</b> <b>states</b> of iron within the crystal. The {{different}} <b>oxidation</b> <b>states</b> occur due to there being a temperature gradient across the crystal during its formation.|$|R
5000|$|A {{characteristic}} of transition metals {{is that they}} exhibit two or more <b>oxidation</b> <b>states,</b> usually differing by one. For example, compounds of vanadium are known in all <b>oxidation</b> <b>states</b> between −1, such as , and +5, such as [...]|$|R
5|$|The {{chemical}} {{behavior of}} ytterbium {{is similar to}} that of the rest of the lanthanides. Most ytterbium compounds are found in the +3 <b>oxidation</b> <b>state,</b> and its salts in this <b>oxidation</b> <b>state</b> are nearly colorless. Like europium, samarium, and thulium, the trihalides of ytterbium can be reduced to the dihalides by hydrogen, zinc dust, or by the addition of metallic ytterbium. The +2 <b>oxidation</b> <b>state</b> occurs only in solid compounds and reacts in some ways similarly to the alkaline earth metal compounds; for example, ytterbium(II) oxide (YbO) shows the same structure as calcium oxide (CaO).|$|E
5|$|The common <b>{{oxidation}}</b> <b>state</b> of rhodium is +3, but oxidation {{states from}} +0 to +6 are also observed.|$|E
5|$|The formal {{oxidation}} {{number in}} boranes is positive, {{and is based}} on the assumption that hydrogen is counted as −1 as in active metal hydrides. The mean oxidation number for the borons is then simply the ratio of hydrogen to boron in the molecule. For example, in diborane B2H6, the boron <b>oxidation</b> <b>state</b> is +3, but in decaborane B10H14, it is 7/5 or +1.4. In these compounds the <b>oxidation</b> <b>state</b> of boron is often not a whole number.|$|E
50|$|These facts, {{combined}} with some elements almost always having certain <b>oxidation</b> <b>states</b> (due to their very high electropositivity or electronegativity), {{allows one to}} compute the <b>oxidation</b> <b>states</b> for the remaining atoms (such as transition metals) in simple compounds.|$|R
500|$|In general, {{the lower}} <b>oxidation</b> <b>states</b> of osmium are {{stabilized}} by ligands {{that are good}} σ-donors (such as amines) and π-acceptors (heterocycles containing nitrogen). The higher <b>oxidation</b> <b>states</b> are stabilized by strong σ- and π-donors, such as [...] and [...]|$|R
5000|$|By {{virtue of}} the lone {{electron}} pair on carbon, isocyanides serves as ligands in coordination chemistry, especially with metals in the 0, +1, and +2 <b>oxidation</b> <b>states.</b> tert-Butyl isocyanide {{has been shown to}} stabilize metals in unusual <b>oxidation</b> <b>states,</b> such as Pd(I).|$|R
5|$|The <b>oxidation</b> <b>state</b> 0 is {{possible}} with carbon monoxide as ligand, {{such as in}} molybdenum hexacarbonyl, Mo(CO)6.|$|E
5|$|The <b>oxidation</b> <b>state</b> {{of oxygen}} is −2 {{in almost all}} known {{compounds}} of oxygen. The <b>oxidation</b> <b>state</b> −1 is found in a few compounds such as peroxides. Compounds containing oxygen in other oxidation states are very uncommon: −1/2 (superoxides), −1/3 (ozonides), 0 (elemental, hypofluorous acid), +1/2 (dioxygenyl), +1 (dioxygen difluoride), and +2 (oxygen difluoride).|$|E
5|$|The {{stabilisation}} of ununennium's {{valence electron}} {{and thus the}} contraction of the 8s orbital cause its atomic radius to be lowered to 240pm, very close to that of rubidium (247pm), so that the chemistry of ununennium in the +1 <b>oxidation</b> <b>state</b> should be more similar to the chemistry of rubidium than to that of francium. On the other hand, the ionic radius of the Uue+ ion is predicted to be larger than that of Rb+, because the 7p orbitals are destabilised and are thus larger than the p-orbitals of the lower shells. Ununennium may also show the +3 <b>oxidation</b> <b>state,</b> which is not seen in any other alkali metal, {{in addition to the}} +1 <b>oxidation</b> <b>state</b> that is characteristic of the other alkali metals and is also the main <b>oxidation</b> <b>state</b> of all the known alkali metals: this is because of the destabilisation and expansion of the 7p3/2 spinor, causing its outermost electrons to have a lower ionisation energy than what would otherwise be expected. Indeed, many ununennium compounds are expected to have a large covalent character, due to the involvement of the 7p3/2 electrons in the bonding.|$|E

5|$|There is a {{relatively}} large difference in the electronegativity of lead(II) at 1.87 and lead(IV) at 2.33. This difference marks the reversal in the trend of increasing stability of the +4 <b>oxidation</b> <b>state</b> going down carbon group; tin, by comparison, has values of 1.80 in the +2 <b>oxidation</b> <b>state</b> and 1.96 in the +4 state.|$|E
5|$|Calculations for {{solution}} chemistry {{indicate that}} again, the maximum <b>oxidation</b> <b>state</b> of dubnium, +5, {{will be more}} stable than that of niobium and tantalum, and the +3 state will be less stable than those of niobium and tantalum. The propensity towards hydrolysis of cations in the highest <b>oxidation</b> <b>state</b> {{is expected to continue}} to decrease within group 5; however, it is still expected to be quite rapid. Complexation of dubnium is expected to follow group 5 trends in its richness. Calculations for hydroxo-chlorido- complexes have been conducted; they show reversal in the trends of complex formation and extraction of group 5 elements, with dubnium being more prone to do so than tantalum.|$|E
5|$|Like all actinides, {{einsteinium}} {{is rather}} reactive. Its trivalent <b>oxidation</b> <b>state</b> is most stable in solids and aqueous solution where it induced pale pink color. The existence of divalent einsteinium is firmly established, especially in solid phase; such +2 {{state is not}} observed in many other actinides, including protactinium, uranium, neptunium, plutonium, curium and berkelium. Einsteinium(II) compounds can be obtained, for example, by reducing einsteinium(III) with samarium(II) chloride.
