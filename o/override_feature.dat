In August 2009, the NHTSA probed the ES 350 following 40 acceleration control complaints, eight crashes and 12 injuries, with floor mats implicated in most cases. An accident involving a loaner ES 350 killed four persons near San Diego on 28 August. The NHTSA and San Diego County Sheriff's Department found that the car was wrongly fitted with an unsecured SUV rubber floor mat; the mat had jammed the accelerator, which an earlier driver had complained about. On 29 September, a Toyota safety notice advised floor mat removal, shift to Neutral (N) gear in an emergency, with a 3-second push button ignition press for engine shutoff.

The results support the view that changes in the market’s structure while positively impacting profit and competition do not lead to increased risk.

The recent confirmation of this for hermatypic corals has raised concern over the future of coral reefs because [CO 3] is a decreasing function of increasing pCO 2 in the atmosphere. As one of the <b>overriding</b> <b>features</b> of coral reefs is their diversity, understanding the degree of variability between species in their ability to cope with a change in [CO 3] is a priority. We cultured four phylogenetically and physiologically different species of hermatypic coral (Acropora verweyi, Galaxea fascicularis, Pavona cactus and Turbinaria reniformis) under 'normal' (280 µmol/kg) and 'low' (140 µmol/kg) carbonate-ion concentrations. The effect on skeletogenesis was investigated quantitatively (by calcification rate) and qualitatively (by microstructural appearance of growing crystalline fibres using scanning electron microscopy (SEM)). The 'low carbonate' treatment resulted in a significant suppression of calcification rate and a tendency for weaker crystallization at the distal tips of fibres. However, while the calcification rate was affected uniformly across species (13 - 18 % reduction), the magnitude of the microstructural response was highly species specific: crystallization was most markedly affected in A. verweyi and least in T. reniformis. These results are discussed in relation to past records and future predictions of carbonate variability in the oceans...|$|R

40|$|Theories of word {{perception}} in reading {{can be categorized}} {{in terms of the}} assumption made about whether or not a word context modifies the feature analysis of its component letters. Independence theories assume that the visual information passed on by feature analysis is independent of word context. Nonindependence theories assume that a word context directly influences visual analysis. Some nonindependence theories have assumed that word context enhances feature analysis of letters, others have assumed that word context <b>overrides</b> <b>feature</b> analysis of letters, and some have assumed that word context directs which letters are analyzed. The present experiment provided a critical test between the two classes of theories by independently varying orthographic context and visual letter information in a letter recognition task. The results contradict the qualitative predictions of the class of nonindependence theories and are accurately described by a quantification of independence theory. To what extent is word perception mediated by letter perception? This question has been debated since the inception of reading-related research about one century ago (Cattell, 1886; Gibson & Levin, 1975; Huey, 1908 / 1968; Massaro, 1975 b). Luckily, almost every stand on this issue can be subsumed under one of two general theories.

40|$|Software {{verification}} is {{an important}} element of software reliability. The significance and importance of verification have been recognized by Bill Gates in his speech in WinHEC 2002. The software verification allows program’s specification to be formally proved to ensure the specification verified the program before its execution time using static analysis. However, in the context of object-oriented program, studies show {{there is a need to}} have formal specifications for method overriding because the <b>overriding</b> <b>feature</b> plays important role in allowing program reusability. This thesis develops an abstract formal framework for invariant generation of static analysis for method overriding in object-oriented program using inheritance. It focuses on late bound method in the class invariants generation. There are two main problems arise during the process of generating class invariant which are reverification of class invariant and over-approximation of late binding call. In the context of method overriding, the problem of late binding call happens when the abstract semantic function uses behavioral subtyping that is restricted to the rule of contravariance and covariance. The abstract formal framework using abstract interpretation theory is proposed to overcome the problem above. The framework exploits the capability of abstract interpretation method in making program analysis automated. It also overcomes the problem of generating the invariants for late binding call of method overriding with less restrictions rules of lazy behavioral subtyping method. The use of lazy behavioral subtyping results to the overridden method semantics has a not over approximated invariant. The framework produces two equations for two invariants, which are modular invariants for inheritance and invariants for method overriding. A scenario based evaluation is conducted to validate the invariants and to compare the proposed framework using lazy behavioral subtyping with the framework using behavioral subtyping...|$|R
40|$|Cerium(IV) oxide (CeO 2), ceria, is {{an active}} metal oxide used in solid oxide fuel cells and for the {{purification}} of exhaust gases in vehicle emissions control. Behind these technically important applications of ceria lies one <b>overriding</b> <b>feature,</b> namely ceria's exceptional reduction-oxidation properties. These are enabled by the duality of the cerium ion which easily toggles between Ce 4 + and Ce 3 +. Here the cerium 4 f electrons and oxygen vacancies (missing oxygen ions in the structure) are key players. In this thesis, the nature of ceria's f electrons and oxygen vacancies are in focus, and examined with theoretical calculations. It is shown that for single oxygen vacancies at ceria surfaces, the intimate coupling between geometrical structure and electron localisation gives a multitude of almost degenerate local energy mimima. With many vacancies, the situation becomes even more complex, and not even state-of-the-art quantum-mechanical calculations manage to predict the experimentally observed phenomenon of vacancy clustering. Instead, an alternative set of computer experiments managed to produce stable vacancy chains and trimers consistent with experimental findings from the literature and revealed a new general principle for surface vacancy clustering. The rich surface chemistry of ceria involves not only oxygen vacancies but also other active oxygen species such as superoxide ions (O 2 −). Experiments have shown that nanocrystalline ceria demonstrates an unusually large oxygen storage capacity (OSC) and an appreciable low-temperature redox activity, which have been ascribed to superoxide species. A mechanism explaining these phenomena is presented. The ceria surface is also known to interact with SOx molecules, which is relevant both {{in the context of}} sulfur poisoning of ceria-based catalysts and sulfur recovery from them. In this thesis, the sulfur species and key mechanisms involved are identified...|$|R
40|$|In natural vision both {{stimulus}} {{features and}} task-demands affect an observer's attention. However, {{the relationship between}} sensory-driven (“bottom-up”) and task-dependent (“top-down”) factors remains controversial: Can task-demands counteract strong sensory signals fully, quickly, and irrespective of bottom-up features? To measure attention under naturalistic conditions, we recorded eye-movements in human observers, while they viewed photographs of outdoor scenes. In the first experiment, smooth modulations of contrast biased the stimuli's sensory-driven saliency towards one side. In free-viewing, observers' eye-positions were immediately biased toward the high-contrast, i. e., high-saliency, side. However, this sensory-driven bias disappeared entirely when observers searched for a bull's-eye target embedded with equal probability {{to either side of}} the stimulus. When the target always occurred in the low-contrast side, observers' eye-positions were immediately biased towards this low-saliency side, i. e., the sensory-driven bias reversed. Hence, task-demands do not only override sensory-driven saliency but also actively countermand it. In a second experiment, a 5 -Hz flicker replaced the contrast gradient. Whereas the bias was less persistent in free viewing, the overriding and reversal took longer to deploy. Hence, insufficient sensory-driven saliency cannot account for the bias reversal. In a third experiment, subjects searched for a spot of locally increased contrast (“oddity”) instead of the bull's-eye (“template”). In contrast to the other conditions, a slight sensory-driven free-viewing bias prevails in this condition. In a fourth experiment, we demonstrate that at known locations template targets are detected faster than oddity targets, suggesting that the former induce a stronger top-down drive when used as search targets. Taken together, task-demands can override sensory-driven saliency in complex visual stimuli almost immediately, and the extent of overriding depends on the search target and the <b>overridden</b> <b>feature,</b> but not on the latter's free-viewing saliency...|$|R
40|$|If {{monetary}} {{policy is to}} be effective in controlling the macroeconomy, accurate measurement of the money supply is essential. The conventional way of measuring the level of the money supply is to simply sum the constituent liquid liabilities of banks. However, a more sophisticated, weighted monetary index has been proposed to take account of the varying degrees of liquidity of the short-term instruments included in money. Inferences about the effects of money on economic activity may depend importantly on the choice of monetary index because simple sum aggregates cannot internalize pure substitution effects. This hypothesis is investigated in the current paper. A Divisia index measure of money is constructed for the USA, UK and Italian economies and its inflation forecasting potential is compared with that of its simple sum counterpart {{in each of the three}} countries. The powerful Artificial Intelligence technique of neural networks is used to allow a completely flexible mapping of the variables and a greater variety of functional form than is currently achievable using conventional econometric techniques. The application of neural network methodology to examine the money-inflation link is highly experimental in nature and, hence, the <b>overriding</b> <b>feature</b> of this research is one of simplicity. Superior inflation forecasting models are achieved when a Divisia M 2 measure of money is used in the majority of cases. This support for Divisia is entirely consistent with findings based on standard econometric techniques reported from the respective central and Federal Reserve banks of each country. Divisia monetary aggregates appear to offer advantages over their simple sum counterparts as macroeconomic indicators. Further, the combination of Divisia measures of money with the artificial neural network offers a promising starting point for improved models of inflation. ...|$|R

40|$|Katherine Mansfield’s {{reputation}} in France {{has always been}} greater than in England. Since her untimely death in 1923, the French reception of Mansfield has idealised her persona {{to the extent of}} crafting a hagiography. In this essay I ask: what were the motives behind the French critics’ desire to put Mansfield on a pedestal and how do the translations of her work collude in the hagiography of her personality, thereby determining whether the beliefs and principles expressed in the original texts have been diluted or censored during the translation process. The French are not wrong to stress that her personality {{is to be found in}} her writing. It is simply that only certain facets of her personality are shown. We now know that the English works themselves had already been censored by her husband, the critic John Middleton Murry, who included nothing which would further stain his own tarnished image, or anything which would seriously condemn his dead first wife. There was a deliberate editing out of things distasteful, shocking, anti-French, colloquial, political, cruel, blasphemous and especially humorous. If the French version is also viewed as a severe bowdlerisation, one must ask what remained of the real Katherine Mansfield for the French audience to appreciate. I demonstrate how - factual and biographical distortions not withstanding - the Katherine Mansfield legend was dependent on the presentation of her art to the French reading public. The sharp-witted, sarcastic, comedienne perceived in her original writing becomes a dull, sober 'thinker' in translation. For when the translations of the Journal and Letters are assessed together, perhaps the most <b>overriding</b> <b>feature</b> which seems to be lost in translation is the humour.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Busulfan {{demonstrates}} a narrow therapeutic index for which clinicians routinely employ therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). However, operationalizing TDM can be fraught with inefficiency. We developed and tested software encoding a {{clinical decision support}} tool (DST) that is embedded into our electronic health record (EHR) and designed to streamline the TDM process for our oncology partners. METHODS: Our development strategy was modeled based on the features associated with successful DSTs. An initial Requirements Analysis was performed to characterize tasks, information flow, user needs, and system requirements to enable push/pull from the EHR. Back-end development was coded based on the algorithm used when manually performing busulfan TDM. The code was independently validated in MATLAB using 10, 000 simulated patient profiles. A 296 -item heuristic checklist was used to guide design of the front-end user interface. Content experts and end-users (n= 28) were recruited to participate in traditional usability testing under an IRB approved protocol. RESULTS: Decision support software was developed to systematically walk the point-of-care clinician through the TDM process. The system is accessed through the EHR which transparently imports all of the requisite patient data. Data are visually inspected and then curve fit using a model-dependent approach. Quantitative goodness-of-fit are converted to single tachometer where green alerts the user that the model is strong, yellow signals caution and red indicates {{that there may be}} a problem with the fitting. <b>Override</b> <b>features</b> are embedded to permit application of a model-independent approach where appropriate. Simulations are performed to target a desired exposure or dose as entered by the clinician and the DST pushes the user approved recommendation back into the EHR. Usability testers were highly satisfied with our DST and quickly became proficient with the software. CONCLUSIONS: With early and broad stake-holder engagement we developed a clinical DST for the non-pharmacologist. This tools affords our clinicians the ability to seamlessly transition from patient assessment, to pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation, and subsequent prescription order entry...|$|R
40|$|Living with Cancer in Old Age’ is an {{exploration}} of older people’s experiences of living with cancer, using qualitative research methods. A qualitative systematic review of international literature found {{that the experience of}} living with cancer in old age is characterised by ambiguity. There are sources of suffering, imposed by cancer itself, by treatments for cancer and by co-morbid disease. At the same time older people have access to sources of comfort and strength, both internal (attitudes of mental fortitude) and external (strong relationships with family, friends, communities and health professionals) which mitigate the worst effects of suffering. This literature study synthesised and interpreted findings from 11 studies covering a heterogeneous population of people aged 55 - 90 +, representing a wide range of cancers at different stages of progress and treatment, across four countries (Israel, Canada, Sweden, USA) and using a range of qualitative methods. A subsequent empirical study using narrative methods focused on a more homogenous population of older people aged 74 - 87, all resident in the same geographical region (NW England), with one of the four most common cancers (breast, colon, prostate and lung) at different stages of progress and treatment, but treated at the same cancer centre. In this study a biographical/narrative method of interviewing was used, in which 20 participants (13 men and 7 women) were invited to tell the ‘story’ of their life both before and after cancer. Interpretation of life history data reported by participants in this study suggests that the <b>overriding</b> <b>features</b> of life with cancer for people in their 70 s and 80 s are hope and hardiness, together forming a kind of resilience which appears to be psychologically protective and which fosters a determination to continue living positively, even at an advanced stage of illness.
