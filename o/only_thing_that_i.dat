In his track-by-track review of x for Billboard magazine, Jason Lipshutz {{suggested that the}} line [...] "Loving can hurt sometimes/But it's the <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> know" [...] in [...] "Photograph" [...] was the [...] "lynchpin line of the whole album". Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe had the same sentiment; she called the song [...] "haunting" [...] and felt it [...] " [...] up on you with [...] tunefulness". Jamieson Cox of Time described Sheeran's use of [...] "detail and powerful imagery" [...] in the lyrics as [...] "smart"; Cox opined that it [...] " [...] to life".|$|E

On The Graham Norton Show, Gaga explained the origin of the song, which involves the analogy of her hair with freedom, and how that is the only part of her body she can change without anyone judging her. According to a press listening in February, [...] "Hair" [...] draws inspiration from Pat Benatar's '80s classic [...] "We Belong", while thematically focusing on empowering lyrics similar to those of [...] "Born This Way". Gaga elaborated on the song's inspiration further with a video posted on her Twitter account: [...] "When I was a kid, I used to always come down the stairs of my parents' house, and they would say, 'Go back upstairs and brush your hair, change your clothes, you can't go out wearing that', and I felt like it was stifling my identity... My hair was my glory. It was the <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could change about myself." ...|$|E

It is composed in the key of Eb major with Brown's vocal range spanning from the note of Eb4 to the note of F5.

[...] According to Rap-Up, on the song, Brown encourages [...] "everyone {{on the dance floor}} to keep their heads up and discover the beauty inside." [...] When speaking about [...] "Beautiful People", Brown told Jayson Rodriguez from MTV News that [...] "it wasn't a selfish record, it wasn't me bragging or boasting or talking about cars or money or girls. It was me being able to inspire people with dance music. We have a lot of tragic things going on and the world needs to come together as a whole and stop the negativity." ...|$|E

On May 26, 2017 when F.T.F.O.M.F. was released, the song [...] "Foggin' Up The Window" [...] caught a lot of [...] "Juggalo Theorists" [...] attention because of Violent J's verse saying [...] "Now my number 4 is all red, Red Fred, Red Fred", believing that to be the name of the next Joker Card, or possibly it's what is said to [...] "summon" [...] the entity, going back to the April 13, 2017 edition of The Juggalo Show.
