Pam tries to keep things together and suggests they create a list <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> to maintain a positive working atmosphere. Michael sets up a meeting with a potential investor and makes a list of potential salesmen to join the company. He receives a letter from his realtor saying that running a business from his condominium is in violation of his residence agreement, so he needs to find office space for the company. Michael and Pam leave to find potential salesmen and then have their meeting with the potential investor.|$|E
25|$|On 12 April 1992, Euro Disney Resort and its theme park, Euro Disneyland, officially opened, on {{the same}} date that Mediaset's La Cinq (unrelated to the resort) ceased transmissions. Visitors were warned of chaos on the roads. A {{government}} survey indicated that {{half a million people}} carried by 90,000 cars might attempt to enter the complex. French radio warned traffic to avoid the area. By midday, the car park was approximately half full, suggesting an attendance level below 25,000. Explanations of the lower-than-expected turnout included speculation that people heeded the advice to stay away and that the one-day strike that cut the direct RER railway connection to Euro Disney from the centre of Paris made the park inaccessible. Due to the European recession that August, the park faced financial difficulties as there were a lack <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> and an overabundance of hotels, leading to underperformance.|$|E

Sutton died in hospital on 14 May 2014, at age 19. A memorial service to him at Lichfield Cathedral was attended by over 10,000 mourners. After his death, Sutton was posthumously recognised for his activism with awards including an MBE and an honorary doctorate from Coventry University.|$|E

500|$|The Official Nintendo Magazine {{commented that}} it was 'incredibly deep' and {{that it was}} 'highly addictive'. They did however mark it down for being 'Slow and really niche'. N-Europe praised the game for being 'surprisingly deep' and said that it was worth its weight in points, despite the pricey {{downloadable}} content. WiiWare World was quoted as saying [...] "Of all the WiiWare titles to date, Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: My Life as a King is easily the most ambitious game on the wii and cheap.

500|$|Greg Mueller from GameSpot {{recommends}} {{the game for}} its value but sees it as [...] "not an absolutely essential expansion" [...] and rates some of the later quests as repetitive and uninspired. Similar comments followed from GamePro reviewer Newton, who found that it is [...] "an impressive expansion" [...] which [...] "delivers more of what made Oblivion great: creative quests, a huge land to explore, and tons <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> there, [...] making this expansion is a solid purchase for anyone who was {{a fan of the}} core game". Jim Rossignol from Eurogamer initially rated the game as equally memorable to Oblivion but later saying that it is [...] "the same game as it ever was, only this time with a slightly weirder backdrop, and less interesting questing". Charles Onyett from IGN rates it as [...] "an entirely worthy addition to Bethesda's stellar fourth entry in The Elder Scrolls series" [...] and as [...] "a great excuse to jump back in [...] ".|$|E

Franco had previously said that he accepted the job for the experience {{and because it was}} a once in a lifetime opportunity. Numerous media viewers criticized Franco for his discontent and lack of energy on stage and the show was widely panned, with some reviewers dubbing it the worst telecast in its history. The actor later spoke about his hosting in an interview on the Late Show with David Letterman. He explained that when accepting the job he never had high hopes, adding [...] "It was never on my list <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> It doesn't mean I didn't care and it doesn't mean I didn't try, right?‚Äù Regarding allegations that he was under the influence of marijuana while hosting, Franco commented [...] "I think the Tasmanian Devil would look stoned standing next to Anne Hathaway.

500|$|Reviewers {{concluded}} that the game lacked the revolutionary potential of Donkey Kong Country but was of a sufficient high quality to sell well during the holiday season. [...] "The 3D platform genre doesn't evolve with Donkey Kong 64", AllGame wrote. While hyped fans would be disappointed, IGN wrote that Donkey Kong 64 remains an excellent and expansive platformer with an overwhelming amount <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> GameFan, on the other hand, was most disappointed by how the game [...] "truly offers nothing new" [...] and compared its monotony and repetition with Eyes Wide Shut: [...] "a big bloated project with not enough brilliant moments to justify the numbness ... sitting through the whole thing". The game, the reviewer continued, [...] "fails {{to live up to}} the Rare name". Donkey Kong 64 3D platforming was commonplace by the time of its release and, according to GameSpot, would have fared better as a Nintendo 64 launch title. With its competition considered, Daily Radar wrote that Donkey Kong 64 was simply the best 3D platform game on the console. Edge qualified this thought: Donkey Kong 64 was the closest any third-party developer had come to outdoing Nintendo's mastery of game structure, but its gameplay was derivative and unimaginative compared to the freedom and flexibility of Nintendo's Super Mario 64. Nevertheless, the 3D Donkey Kong was [...] "a fine effort ... in its own right".|$|E
500|$|The art {{style of}} the game world drew acclaim from many reviewers, who welcomed the {{departure}} from Oblivions Cyrodiil. Jason Schreier of Wired described the land of Skyrim as a [...] "Viking-inspired treasure trove of flavor and charm", noting its contrast to Cyrodiil, which he considered generic by comparison. The Staff at Edge magazine described Cyrodiil as a [...] "patchwork of varying terrains", praising the more consistent design of Skyrim. Shibley praised [...] "the lack of copy-and-paste level design that's plagued Bethesda's previous games,... giving a lived-in and handcrafted look to the world". Bedford noted that the improved graphical fidelity over Oblivion allowed the game world to feel more lifelike, praising the [...] "misty mountain setting, complete with swirling fog and high-altitude snowstorms". An editor for PC PowerPlay praised {{the diversity of the}} dungeon design. Andrew Reiner of Game Informer cited criticisms that Oblivion faced for repetitive dungeons, noting that [...] "the composition of each dungeon is largely unique and individualized" [...] in Skyrim. He also favored the design choice to have a quick route out of a dungeon leading from its last room, eliminating a problem he identified Oblivion as having, where the player would clear a dungeon and then have {{to go all the way}} back to the beginning to exit it. Many reviewers praised the large amount <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in the world outside of the main story. Tom Francis of PC Gamer noted that it was difficult to explore the world without becoming distracted by things to do, stating that, [...] "it's hard to walk for a minute in any direction without encountering an intriguing cave, a lonely shack, some strange stones, a wandering traveller, [...] a haunted fort".|$|E

2500|$|Members of {{the active}} parts of the network {{generally}} organise local and national gatherings of co-counsellors {{in addition to the}} international gatherings. [...] These gatherings are usually self-creating, in other words there is no pre organised programme, facilitators or speakers.

[...] Plenary sessions are mainly about organising the business of the day, as part of which anyone who wants to suggest or offer to facilitate a [...] "workshop" [...] explains their idea. [...] The workshops cover a wide range of topics from applying co-counselling to a range of issues e.g. depression or gender issues, to trying out other approaches to personal development such as meditation or cognitive behavioural therapy. [...] Some of the sessions may be training, e.g. in assertiveness, while others may be for games, music or dance. [...] Generally there is a choice <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> including having co-counselling sessions or just socialising.

[...] We had to plant some roots, lest we start to write songs about living on a tour bus. So we had to fall in love, we had to fall out of love, we had to make homes."
