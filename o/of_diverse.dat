5|$|Because of its {{multitude}} <b>of</b> <b>diverse,</b> sometimes competing ethno-linguistic groups, Nigeria {{prior to}} independence {{was faced with}} sectarian tensions and violence, particularly in the oil-producing Niger Delta region, where both state and civilian forces employ varying methods of coercion in attempts gain control over regional petroleum resources. Some of the ethnic groups like the Ogoni, have experienced severe environmental degradation due to petroleum extraction.|$|E
5|$|Despite tensions, {{the march}} was a resounding success. More {{than a quarter}} of a million people <b>of</b> <b>diverse</b> ethnicities {{attended}} the event, sprawling from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial onto the National Mall and around the reflecting pool. At the time, it was the largest gathering of protesters in Washington, D.C.'s history.|$|E

5|$|Bok was {{aided by}} people <b>of</b> <b>diverse</b> {{cultures}} and faiths in his journey to freedom. His earliest steps towards the United States were {{helped by a}} Northern Sudanese Muslim family that believed that slavery was wrong and provided him a bus ticket to Khartoum. Upon arriving in Khartoum, Bok was aided by a fellow Dinka tribesman {{and members of the}} Fur people, and his trip to the United States was paid for by members of the Lutheran church. His first point of contact in the United States was a refugee from Somalia who helped him get settled in Fargo, North Dakota.|$|E
5|$|Denver {{has many}} nationally {{recognized}} museums, {{including a new}} wing for the Denver Art Museum by world-renowned architect Daniel Libeskind, the second largest Performing Arts Center in the nation after Lincoln Center in New York City and bustling neighborhoods such as LoDo, filled with art galleries, restaurants, bars and clubs. That {{is part of the}} reason why Denver was, in 2006, recognized for the third year in a row as the best city for singles. Denver's neighborhoods also continue their influx <b>of</b> <b>diverse</b> people and businesses while the city's cultural institutions grow and prosper. The city acquired the estate of abstract expressionist painter Clyfford Still in 2004 and built a museum to exhibit his works near the Denver Art Museum.|$|E

5|$|He used actors <b>of</b> <b>diverse</b> backgrounds, from famous film {{stars to}} people who {{had never seen a}} film (as in Aparajito). Robin Wood and others have lauded him as the best {{director}} of children, pointing out memorable performances in the roles of Apu and Durga (Pather Panchali), Ratan (Postmaster) and Mukul (Sonar Kella). Depending on the talent or experience of the actor, Ray varied the intensity of his direction, from virtually nothing with actors such as Utpal Dutt, to using the actor as a puppet (Subir Banerjee as young Apu or Sharmila Tagore as Aparna). Actors who had worked for Ray praised his customary trust but said he could also treat incompetence with total contempt.|$|E

5|$|Many {{facets of}} the {{interaction}} between sea otters and the human economy are not as immediately felt. Sea otters have been credited with contributing to the kelp harvesting industry via their well-known role in controlling sea urchin populations; kelp is used in the production <b>of</b> <b>diverse</b> food and pharmaceutical products. Although human divers harvest red sea urchins both for food and to protect the kelp, sea otters hunt more sea urchin species and are more consistently effective in controlling these populations. The health of the kelp forest ecosystem is significant in nurturing populations of fish, including commercially important fish species. In some areas, sea otters are popular tourist attractions, bringing visitors to local hotels, restaurants, and sea otter-watching expeditions.|$|E
5|$|Phylogenetic {{analyses}} {{based on}} 16S ribosomal DNA suggest that S.iniae {{is closely related}} to other streptococcal pathogens of humans and animals. Specifically, it is clustered in the pyogenic group, along with other pathogenic streptococci such as S.pyogenes, S.agalactiae, S.uberis, S.canis, S.porcinus, S.phocae, and S.intestinalis. Of these related species, it is most closely related to S. porcinus. Genomic restriction fragment analysis <b>of</b> <b>diverse</b> host and geographical panels of S.iniae isolates has shown common profiles between virulent fish and human strains, though multiple pulsed field gel electrophoresis patterns have been identified among human isolates.|$|E

5|$|Religion plays a {{large part}} in the Forgotten Realms, with deities and their {{followers}} being {{an integral part of}} the world. They do not have a passive role, but in fact interact directly in mortal affairs, answer prayers, and have their own personal agendas. All deities must have worshipers to survive, and all mortals must worship a patron deity to secure a good afterlife. A huge number <b>of</b> <b>diverse</b> deities exist within several polytheistic pantheons; a large number of supplements have documented many of them, some in more detail than others.|$|E
5|$|Sited {{adjacent}} to Housing and Development Board apartment {{blocks of the}} Marine Parade Housing Estate, the Marine Parade Community Building {{could be seen as}} an attempt to engage the wider community. The activities of the community building were planned to overlap and to coalesce, as a one-stop destination for the entire family. The rich congruence of the multiple programmes for the building is expressed architecturally as a collage <b>of</b> <b>diverse</b> elements. The building was designed by a local architectural firm, William Lim Associates, which adopted a postmodern pluralist approach, expressed through a multiplicity of materials and forms.|$|E
5|$|The {{enormous}} task which Gaudí faced, not {{in terms}} of the number of works, but in terms of their complexity, required the collaboration of a large number of assistants, artists, architects and craftsmen.

A test of his expertise both in his field and in interpersonal communication was demonstrated in bringing together a large number <b>of</b> <b>diverse</b> professionals and creating an integrated team.|$|E

5|$|Van Meegeren was a {{prolific}} artist and produced thousands of original paintings {{in a number}} <b>of</b> <b>diverse</b> styles. This wide range in painting and drawing styles often irritated art critics. Some of his typical works are classical still lifes in convincing 17th century manner, Impressionistic paintings of people frolicking on lakes or beaches, jocular drawings where the subject is drawn with rather odd features, Surrealistic paintings with combined fore- and backgrounds. Van Meegeren's portraits, however, are probably his finest works.|$|E
