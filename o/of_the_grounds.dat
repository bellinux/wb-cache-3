5|$|East Lawn {{was laid}} {{out in front of}} the east window and was used for grand bazaars and fêtes until the early 20th century. A ha-ha was {{installed}} behind to keep cattle out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds.</b> To the south of the priory buildings the Long Terrace ran almost the full length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds.</b> It afforded access to the ruins via a flight of steps flanked by two carved demi-sea wolves, reflecting the coat of arms of the Chaloners. They were thought to be dragons by local people and the steps were referred to as the Dragon Steps.|$|E
5|$|Only {{two people}} were ever {{degraded}} – Lord Cochrane in 1813 and General Sir Eyre Coote in 1816, both for political reasons, rather than any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> given in the statute. Lord Cochrane was subsequently reinstated, but Coote died {{a few years after}} his degradation.|$|E
5|$|The Margaret Macmillan Open Air Nursery {{was built}} on part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> of number 1 Tilbury Place in the 1930s, partly funded by Laetitia Tilbury Tarner (who had bequeathed the house and its grounds to Brighton Corporation). A nursery school now stands on the site.|$|E

5|$|The {{next thing}} {{built on the}} grounds was an eight foot arch that went from the rectory to the next future building. A statue of Saint Peter {{was placed in the}} niche over the {{keystone}} of the arch. From the arch, a large stairway descends to the lower level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{four sides}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> {{are known as}} the Town End Terrace (official {{capacity}} 1,775), the Niramax Stand (official capacity 1,617 seated and 1,832 terraced standing), the Cyril Knowles Stand (official capacity 1,599) and the Rink End (official capacity 1,033). The Town End Terrace is a standing area behind the south goal, and usually the most vocal area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> <b>The</b> Niramax Stand (formerly the Millhouse Stand) is an all seating stand with a terraced paddock at <b>the</b> west side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> <b>The</b> Cyril Knowles Stand is a modern all-seater stand ton <b>the</b> east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> <b>The</b> Rink End is also an all-seater stand containing 1,033 seats, some with an obscured view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pitch due to supporting pillars. The Rink End is at <b>the</b> north end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> and houses only away fans.|$|R

5|$|A {{large area}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> between the asylum main {{buildings}} and Princess Street was allocated to Children's Cottages in 1885. When the Children's Cottages became a separate institution, the area surrounding the cottages became no longer under asylum management and {{was no longer}} for asylum inmate use. Widening and straightening of Princess Street in 1939-1940 resulted in the demolishing of Kew's gatehouses, loss of land and the relocation of the main gates to Victoria Park, Kew. Construction of Yarra Boulevard during the 1930s led to {{a section of the}} asylum's river frontage being acquired by the roads department.|$|E
5|$|An {{area was}} set aside within {{the grounds for}} athletics, aptly named the Tower Athletic Ground. It {{consisted}} of a stadium opened in 1896; the hope was to provide additional entertainment for visitors to the tower in the winter months. The capacity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> varied, but at one point was as high as 100,000, although attendances rarely, if ever, approached that figure.|$|E
5|$|Brislington House (now {{known as}} Long Fox Manor) was {{built as a}} private lunatic asylum. When it opened in 1806 {{it was one of}} the first {{purpose-built}} asylums in England.

5|$|Due to {{the slope}} of the site, the south façade, which overlooks the main part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds,</b> stands on a raised and terraced {{platform}} with the ground floor raised to first floor level and the basement becoming the ground floor. Above the terrace, the façade has the same general arrangement as the north façade, but the wings project slightly past the central section, which has a two-storey pedimented portico. Each wing previously had a single-storey bay at its centre but these have been removed.|$|E
5|$|During the 20th {{century the}} long-abandoned gardens were replanted {{in a style}} {{sympathetic}} to the Tudor period. The knot garden was planted in 1972, to a design taken from Leonard Meager's Complete English Gardener, published in 1670. The intricate design of the knot {{can be seen from}} one of the two original viewing mounds, common in 16th-century formal gardening, one inside the moat and the other to the southwest. Other features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> include a yew tunnel and an orchard growing fruits that would have been familiar to the house's Tudor occupants– apples, pears, quinces and medlars.|$|E
5|$|In 1910, {{the city}} {{installed}} a large boulder on the southeast portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds.</b> The Oregon Railway and Navigation Company {{had found the}} 15,000-year-old boulder in 1897 and moved it to Portland. The ten ton Wallula Stone was discovered in the Columbia River Gorge, and was covered with petroglyphs. It was returned to the Umatilla tribe of Native Americans in Eastern Oregon in 1996. The old elevators inside were replaced again in 1946, and in 1948 a runaway truck destroyed part of the stone railing on the Fifth Avenue side, which was then fixed.|$|E
25|$|A trust was established, {{providing}} {{beneficial ownership}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> for <b>the</b> ACA and ARFU. <b>The</b> management <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> shifted to a Board of Control comprising {{members from the}} ACA and ARFU.|$|R

5|$|Marie Louise Gardens is a {{relatively}} small park {{to the west of}} the centre of Didsbury. The park was originally owned by the Silkenstadt family as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> of their house. The land was bequeathed to the people of Manchester by Mrs Silkenstadt in 1904 in memory of her daughter, Marie Louise. The park was at the centre of controversy in 2007 after Manchester City Council proposed to sell a portion of it to a private property developer.|$|E
5|$|Once an {{individual}} has been detained, there are administrative processes which the executive is required to follow under sections 9, 11 and 12 of the Act. The detainee is to be informed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> of detention as soon as possible, unless their disclosure is against the national interest.

In <b>the</b> south-east corner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> floor is a private office, originally the manager's office, which has original paquetry floors and timber panelled walls. This plan is replicated at <b>the</b> south-west corner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> floor, however this room does not display the same quality finishes. <b>The</b> north-west corner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> floor contains a separate room which was originally used at the typists' room.|$|R
5|$|Part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> were {{donated to}} the local parish after Beckford's death and consecrated as a {{cemetery}} in 1848. It became known as Lansdown Cemetery and burial plots were {{laid out in a}} grid pattern. It was extended in 1947 and again in 1961. In addition to Beckford's tomb, the cemetery is also the burial site for several notable people from Bath including: Henry Goodridge, Field Marshall William Rowan, the Holburne family who founded the Holburne Museum, Anne (the wife of Sir Richard Bickerton, 2nd Baronet) and the feminist writer Sarah Grand.|$|E
5|$|Shepton {{benefits}} from a sizeable park, {{a gift of}} land from a local man, John Kyte Collett. As a boy he was thrown out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> of local estates for trespass so in later life he purchased and gave land to the town to provide a public space; this park, which opened in 1906, is called Collett Park in his honour.|$|E
5|$|Swakeleys House is a Grade I-listed 17th-century {{mansion in}} Ickenham, London Borough of Hillingdon, built in 1638 {{for the future}} Lord Mayor of London, Sir Edmund Wright. Originally {{the home of the}} lords of the manor of Swakeleys, writer Samuel Pepys visited the house twice. The {{property}} changed hands many times over the years and at one time was home to the Foreign & Commonwealth Office Sports Association. Large sections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> were sold off in 1922 and developed as suburban housing.|$|E
