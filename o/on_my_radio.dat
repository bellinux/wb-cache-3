5000|$|...I {{wanted to}} combine the club and {{commercial}} worlds in one song ...I wanted to make something that I could play in my DJ sets and <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>radio</b> show… RedOne was perfect.

5000|$|... “First and foremost, {{we wanted}} to try to do more to promote the sorts of filthy rock'n'roll that we liked (as well as {{featured}} <b>on</b> <b>my</b> old <b>radio</b> show) but that most people have never heard simply because they don’t seek it out, have never been exposed to it before, or can't hear my show for one reason or another. And having one central website where people could gather, discuss, share, and promote this music was essential. Secondly, {{we wanted to}} encourage {{each and every one of}} you to support your local independently owned record stores, mailorder sites, and especially the indie labels that produce the vast majority of music featured on GaragePunk Pirate Radio.” Jeff “Kopper” Kopp ...|$|R
5000|$|Cale told The San Diego Union-Tribune in his 1990 {{interview}} about Clapton's version:I thought: 'Well, that won't go anywhere'. ... A year later, they started playing it on every radio station, including in my hometown. The first time I heard it <b>on</b> <b>my</b> car <b>radio</b> I just drove {{off to the}} side of the road. Because I'd never heard anything of <b>my</b> own <b>on</b> the <b>radio</b> before...All record companies want big-selling records, and my music is a little too raw for commercial success. People are familiar with my songs, especially through Eric Clapton. But I have a hard time drawing a crowd, because I have been a songwriter. I've never sold a lot of records; my music's gotten much more famous than me.|$|R

5000|$|Says Charlie, “I was {{the first}} one in the family to play the fiddle and I {{was the first}} one to play <b>on</b> the <b>radio.</b> <b>My</b> dad Stamper played fiddle, banjo, and French harp, which is what we called a harmonica. I {{remember}} when I was five or six, I would sit on the floor between his legs as he played the fiddle, his big foot keeping time as it hit the floor." ...|$|R
5000|$|While {{some critics}} gave the record a more lukewarm reception, even {{they could not}} hold back completely. Bettie Lou Vegas at Ink19 listened to the record and wrote: [...] "Seven Storey is {{something}} I would have played into the ground in 1993. While I don't salivate over it now in 2002, it's still quite good." [...] Scott at Punknews.org didn't find that record passé, instead {{he felt that the}} band might have had more to give. In his review, he wrote that [...] "The album definitely has strong points with tracks like 'Unknown Satellite' and 'Dress Rehearsal,' but the majority {{of the rest of the}} album only displays the band's potential. Give this band 5 more years with this new lineup and I bet they'll be able to do something amazing. Until then, they're be in semi-heavy rotation <b>on</b> <b>my</b> college <b>radio</b> show, because that's where good rock like this belongs." ...|$|R

5000|$|Khan {{is perhaps}} best known for his innovation, Jafferkhani Baaj. He {{describes}} it as, [...] "a synthesis of precision in technique, systematic thought" [...] with a vigorous playing style. Cultural anthropologist and reader at the University of Mumbai, Dr. Kamala Ganesh states: [...] "His music making is full of eclectic yet deeply informed choices. He is a thinking musician but puts across his complex views with a simplicity and feeling which demarcate the articulate performer from the articulate theoretician.... In him, one gets an unmistakable sense... a syncretic tradition". The Indian santoor player Shivkumar Sharma remembers of Khan's performance of the raga Chaayanat: [...] "It was probably in 1955-56, I was relaxing in my terrace in Jammu. In the stillness of the night I heard the notes of Raga Chaayanat on the sitar emanate from my neighbor's radio. I immediately noticed that the tone of the sitar was completely different and the style of playing radically unique. I rushed to switch <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>radio....</b> I was totally engrossed and was very curious to know who this maestro was." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Stay the Night" [...] {{was first}} written after Blunt stated he was [...] "tired of writing self-pitying songs". In an {{interview}} for STV, Blunt claimed: [...] "After the last tour I tried writing at the piano, but I was repeating myself, writing sad songs about poor old me. I needed {{to get away from}} music for a while. My new songs, most prominently 'Stay the Night', are more optimistic. One thing I did learn is that your artistic credibility goes out the window when you have a big record. 'You're Beautiful' meant something to me, but to most people, it's a song they sing when they're drunk." [...] The lyrics in [...] "Stay the Night" [...] feature a reference to Bob Marley's classic [...] "Is This Love" [...] in the lines: Just like the song <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>radio</b> said / We’ll share the shelter of my single bed. Marley is credited as a co-writer. The version released on the U.S. edition of the album is different than the original; it features a fade-in intro and runs for a length of 3 minutes and 25 seconds.|$|E
40|$|Music {{has always}} caught the public’s imagination. From {{dreams of a}} giant “jukebox in the sky ” over the Information Superhighway 1 to the recent debate about Napster, music {{has always been the}} “killer app ” used to {{describe}} new technologies. Of course, these dreams have never quite come about as planned. Instead of a smart machine seeking out music tuned to my tastes, I still have {{only a small number of}} choices <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>radio</b> dial. And ever since Napster started filtering, sharing music on the Internet has become increasingly difficult. One thing that underlies these ideas is their dependency on metadata, or data about data. Metadata provides information about artists, song titles, and so on. All that information is attached to the music, but isn’t part of it.

40|$|I {{closed my}} eyes and rested a bit while I listened to the <b>radio</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> Walkman, trying to gear up for the day ahead. As the bus left the borough of Manhattan and entered The Bronx, the scenery changed and became more industrial; grittier and grimier. Yet on that day, it {{actually}} did not look as bad because the day was so glori-ous. There were many 18 -wheelers on the road and road construction was omnipresent.
