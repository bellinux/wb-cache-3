5|$|Although cholangiocarcinoma {{is known}} to have the {{histological}} and molecular features of an adenocarcinoma of epithelial cells lining the biliary tract, the actual cell of origin is unknown. Recent evidence has suggested that the initial transformed cell that generates the primary tumor may arise from a pluripotent hepatic stem cell. Cholangiocarcinoma is thought to develop through a series of stages - from early hyperplasia and metaplasia, through dysplasia, to the development of frank carcinoma - in a process similar to that seen in the development <b>of</b> <b>colon</b> cancer. Chronic inflammation and obstruction of the bile ducts, and the resulting impaired bile flow, are thought {{to play a role in}} this progression.|$|E
5|$|Despite being a {{very weak}} storm, forecasters were wary about Katrina, as Central America was devastated by Hurricane Mitch exactly one year earlier. There was {{considerable}} fear of additional flash flooding and mudslides across the mountainous region. Immediately after being declared a tropical depression, a tropical storm warning was issued for Nicaragua, and it was extended to the San Andrés islands of Colombia shortly afterward. Officials in Honduras evacuated 71 families from the district <b>of</b> <b>Colón</b> and another 17 families from other at-risk areas. Along the coastline of Honduras, a red alert was declared as torrential rains were anticipated to produce deadly mudslides in areas still recovering from Mitch nearly one year ago.|$|E

M-86 continues east through agricultural land into the village <b>of</b> <b>Colon.</b> The highway follows South Street and turns north on Blackstone Avenue between Sturgeon and Palmer lakes. Turning to follow State Street, the trunkline heads out of the village to the southeast. It continues eastward along Colon Road, passing north of Matteson Lake near Matteson and through Batavia Center. In Coldwater Township, M-86 experienced its lowest traffic level in 2009 at 1,872vehicles and 129trucks AADT. The highway terminates at US12 west of Coldwater near the Branch County Memorial Airport and Messenger Lake. No segment of M-86 has been listed on the National Highway System, a system of roads important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E
5|$|These {{harmful effects}} {{may also be}} seen in non-smokers, as a recent {{meta-analysis}} including data from approximately 230,000 patients showed that β-carotene, vitamin A or vitamin E supplementation is associated with increased mortality but saw no significant effect from vitamin C. No health risk was seen when all the randomized controlled studies were examined together, but an increase in mortality was detected when only high-quality and low-bias risk trials were examined separately. As {{the majority of these}} low-bias trials dealt with either elderly people, or people with disease, these results may not apply to the general population. This meta-analysis was later repeated and extended by the same authors, with the new analysis published by the Cochrane Collaboration; this analysis confirmed the previous results. These two publications are consistent with some previous meta-analyzes that also suggested that Vitamin E supplementation increased mortality, and that antioxidant supplements increased the risk <b>of</b> <b>colon</b> cancer. Beta-carotene may also increase lung cancer. Overall, the large number of clinical trials carried out on antioxidant supplements suggest that either these products have no effect on health, or that they cause a small increase in mortality in elderly or vulnerable populations.|$|E

30|$|Adenosquamous {{carcinoma}} <b>of</b> the <b>colon</b> {{is a rare}} form {{of cancer}} with an incidence of about 0.1 % of all colorectal malignancies reported in Western countries and in Japan [1, 5, 6]. Yokoi and colleagues [7] have reported {{that the incidence of}} adenosquamous carcinoma <b>of</b> the <b>colon</b> is slightly higher in males (1.19 : 1) and that the tumor is more likely to occur in the right colon compared with adenocarcinoma. Furthermore, adenosquamous carcinoma <b>of</b> the <b>colon</b> is often detected at an advanced clinical stage, in which the tumor is already large and is characterized by a high incidence of lymph node metastasis, compared with adenocarcinoma [7 – 9]. Besides surgical resection, no effective treatment has been established to treat adenosquamous carcinoma <b>of</b> the <b>colon,</b> which is resistant to chemotherapy. Although there have been reports describing the effectiveness of radiation therapy for local recurrence of adenosquamous carcinoma <b>of</b> the <b>colon</b> following surgery [5, 7], the number of cases has been small. Moreover, adenosquamous carcinoma <b>of</b> the <b>colon</b> is known to be a highly malignant form of cancer with a poor prognosis compared with adenocarcinoma.
