5|$|Zero is a number, {{and numbers}} {{are used for}} counting. Given a set <b>of</b> <b>objects,</b> one uses a number to {{describe}} how many objects are in the set. Zero is the count of no objects; in more formal terms, it is the number <b>of</b> <b>objects</b> in the empty set. The concept of parity is used for making groups of two objects. If the objects in a set can be marked off into groups of two, with none left over, then the number <b>of</b> <b>objects</b> is even. If an object is left over, then the number <b>of</b> <b>objects</b> is odd. The empty set contains zero groups of two, and no object is left over from this grouping, so zero is even.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn three {{experiments}} {{we investigated}} whether conscious object recognition is necessary or sufficient for effects <b>of</b> <b>object</b> memories on figure assignment. In experiment 1, we examined a brain-damaged participant, AD, whose conscious object recognition is severely impaired. AD’s responses about figure assignment do reveal effects from memories <b>of</b> <b>object</b> structure, indicating that conscious object recognition {{is not necessary}} for these effects, and identifying the figure-ground test employed here as a new implicit test of access to memories <b>of</b> <b>object</b> structure. In experiments 2 and 3, we tested a second brain-damaged participant, WG, for whom conscious object recognition was relatively spared. Nevertheless, effects from memories <b>of</b> <b>object</b> structure on figure assignment were not evident in WG’s responses about figure assignment in experiment 2, indicating that conscious object recognition is not sufficient for effects <b>of</b> <b>object</b> memories on figure assignment. WG’s performance sheds light on AD’s performance, and has implications for the theoretical understanding <b>of</b> <b>object</b> memory effects on figure assignment...|$|R

40|$|Numerous {{theories}} {{have been developed}} in explanation <b>of</b> <b>object</b> perception, such as Feature Integration Theory, which posits that an object is perceived after two stages: a pre-attentive stage and a focused attention stage. It is during the focused attention stage that a representation <b>of</b> the perceived <b>object</b> is formed. Theories such as Object File Theory account for the maintenance <b>of</b> these <b>object</b> representations following their creation. Evidence for object file theory has been provided by studies <b>of</b> the <b>object</b> specific preview benefit. This dissertation seeks to examine the effect that dividing attention has on the maintenance <b>of</b> <b>object</b> representations. Using the tenets <b>of</b> <b>object</b> file theory and the cortical field hypothesis for dual task interference, it is hypothesized that differential effects {{can be found in}} the creation and maintenance <b>of</b> <b>object</b> representations. Specifically, by presenting participants with two simultaneous tasks which make use of overlapping cortical areas the object representation initially formed will be lost, resulting in the loss <b>of</b> the <b>object</b> specific preview benefit. In contrast, presenting participants with two simultaneous tasks which are associated with spatially separate, or non-overlapping, cortical regions will not result in the loss <b>of</b> the <b>object</b> specific preview benefit...|$|R
