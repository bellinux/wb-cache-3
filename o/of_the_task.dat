5|$|A North Korean {{tank column}} {{equipped}} with ex-Soviet T-34/85 tanks overran {{the task force}} in the first encounter and continued its advance south. After the North Korean tank column had breached U.S. lines the Task Force opened fire on a force of some 5,000 North Korean infantry approaching its position, temporarily holding up the North Korean advance. North Korean troops eventually flanked and overwhelmed American positions and the remnants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>task</b> force retreated in disorder.|$|E
5|$|Given the {{difficulty}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>task</b> of educating his brother while earning a living, Jacques-Joseph {{decided to send}} his younger brother to the well-regarded school of the Abbé Dussert in November 1802, where Champollion would stay until the summer of 1804. During this period, his gift for languages first became evident: he started out learning Latin and Greek, but quickly progressed to Hebrew and other Semitic languages such as Arabic, Syriac and Chaldean. It was while a student here that he took up interest in Ancient Egypt, likely encouraged in this direction by Dussert and his brother, both orientalists.|$|E
5|$|In {{the days}} leading to the Constitutional Convention, Alex and the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>task</b> force try to stop Roarke from getting the votes needed to allow the Convention to take place. After their initial plan fails, they resort to a final strategy. At the {{convention}} in Philadelphia, Alex publicly broadcasts Roarke's recordings with the Federal Security Service and emails the evidence to the ACLU and other rights organizations, before having Miranda fake her death by shooting her at the event. Roarke, not willing to face the press or the police, commits suicide.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The Worst-Case Response Time (WCRT) of {{multitasking}} applications {{running on}} multi-cores {{is an important}} metric for real-time embedded systems. The WCRT is determined by <b>the</b> mapping <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tasks</b> to <b>the</b> cores (which determines load balancing) and the Worst-Case Execution Time (WCET) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tasks.</b> However, <b>the</b> WCET <b>of</b> a <b>task</b> is also influenced by the conflicts in the shared cache from concurrently executing tasks on other cores in a multi-core system. In other words, <b>the</b> mapping <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tasks</b> to <b>the</b> cores indirectly influences <b>the</b> WCET <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tasks,</b> which in turn impacts <b>the</b> WCRT <b>of</b> <b>the</b> entire application. Thus <b>the</b> mapping <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tasks</b> to <b>the</b> cores should simultaneously maximize workload balance and minimize shared cache interference. We propose an integer-linear programming (ILP) formulation to achieve this objective. Experimental evaluation shows that shared cache aware task mapping achieves on an average 25 % and 33 % WCRT reduction for real-life and synthetic applications, respectively, compared to traditional approach that is agnostic to shared cache conflicts and solely focuses on load balancing.

5|$|Juskalian {{then took}} part in Operation Torch {{as part of the}} 1st Infantry Division's 26th Infantry Regiment, {{commanded}} by Theodore Roosevelt Jr. The Allies, who had organized three amphibious task forces, aimed to seize key ports and airfields in Morocco and Algeria while simultaneously targeting Casablanca, Oran and Algiers.

Many of them nevertheless volunteered to join the task force. The soldiers were each equipped with only 120 rounds of ammunition and two days of C-rations.|$|E
5|$|Task Force Kean {{kicked off}} its attack on 7 August, moving out from Masan.

The other units <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Task</b> Force, however, were slowed by North Korean resistance. Task Force Kean pressed on the Chindong-ni area, {{resulting in a}} confused battle where the fragmented force {{had to rely on}} air strikes and airdrops to keep it effective. Task Force Kean's offensive had collided with one being delivered simultaneously by the North Korean 6th Division.|$|E

5|$|The Baltimore City Board of School Commissioners {{ultimately}} accepted {{all but one}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>task</b> force's {{recommendations in}} 1979. The group recommended maintaining the school's then-141-year-old tradition of all-male education. Citing concerns over conflicting federal and district court decisions which {{had not yet been}} resolved by the U.S. Supreme Court, the school board voted to make City a coeducational school. The board's action followed trends at the time at all-male colleges and universities like Harvard University, Yale University, and nearby Johns Hopkins University, which admitted women during the 1970s.|$|E

5|$|The Bundeswehr {{gave the}} {{remaining}} border guards and other ex-NVA soldiers {{the task of}} clearing the fortifications, which was completed only in 1994. The scale <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>task</b> was immense, involving both the clearing of the fortifications and the rebuilding of hundreds of roads and railway lines. A serious complication was the presence of mines along the border. Although the 1.4million mines laid by the GDR {{were supposed to have}} been removed during the 1980s, it turned out that 34,000 were unaccounted for. A further 1,100mines were found and removed following reunification at a cost of more than DM250million, in a programme that was not concluded until the end of 1995.|$|E

5|$|Tool use in orangutans was {{observed}} by primatologist Birutė Galdikas in ex-captive populations. In addition, evidence of sophisticated tool manufacture and {{use in the}} wild was reported from a population of orangutans in Suaq Balimbing (Pongo abelii) in 1996. These orangutans developed a tool kit for use in foraging that consisted of both insect-extraction tools {{for use in the}} hollows of trees and seed-extraction tools for harvesting seeds from hard-husked fruit. The orangutans adjusted their tools according to the nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>task</b> at hand, and preference was given to oral tool use. This preference was also found in an experimental study of captive orangutans (P. pygmaeus).|$|E
5|$|Two {{weeks after}} the end of the hostage crisis, President Claire Haas (Marcia Cross) and CIA {{director}} Matthew Keyes put forth a covert joint task force between the FBI and CIA. President Haas mentions that there were eight collaborators within the shadowy cabal group who are secretly involved with the AIC. As a result of Lydia's actions, the collaborators gained access to sensitive U.S intelligence. This information was vital to their goal of controlling certain areas within the government. As a response, the task force is assigned to uncover the conspiracy and expose the involvement of the collaborators in orchestrating the hostage crisis. Alex is hired to be a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>task</b> force along with Ryan Booth, Nimah Amin, Shelby Wyatt, and Dayana Mampasi. The leader of the group is Clay Haas (Hunter Parrish), a renowned political advisory strategist. Prior to the formation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>task</b> force, Alex is re-instated as an FBI agent.|$|E

5|$|A {{somewhat}} different DAG-based formulation of scheduling constraints {{is used by}} the program evaluation and review technique (PERT), a method for management of large human projects {{that was one of the}} first applications of DAGs. In this method, the vertices of a DAG represent milestones of a project rather than specific tasks to be performed. Instead, a task or activity is represented by an edge of a DAG, connecting two milestones that mark the beginning and completion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>task.</b> Each such edge is labeled with an estimate for the amount of time that it will take a team of workers to perform the task. The longest path in this DAG represents the critical path of the project, the one that controls the total time for the project. Individual milestones can be scheduled according to the lengths of the longest paths ending at their vertices.|$|E

5|$|During the game, players {{describe}} their PC's intended actions, such as punching an opponent or picking a lock, and converse with the DM, who then describes the result or response. Trivial actions, such as {{picking up a}} letter or opening an unlocked door, are usually automatically successful. The outcomes of more complex or risky actions are determined by rolling dice. Factors contributing to the outcome include the character's ability scores, skills and the difficulty <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>task.</b> In circumstances where a character does not have control of an event, such as when a trap or magical effect is triggered or a spell is cast, a saving throw {{can be used to}} determine whether the resulting damage is reduced or avoided.
