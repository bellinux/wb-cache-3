5|$|Various macroinvertebrate taxa inhabit Roaring Creek. At one site, {{there is}} one {{abundant}} macroinvertebrate taxon, with 25 to 100 individuals being <b>observed.</b> <b>At</b> this site, there are five common taxa and five present taxa, with 10 to 25 and 3 to 9 individuals being observed, respectively. Eleven taxa are rare, with fewer than three individuals being <b>observed.</b> <b>At</b> another site, there are two abundant taxa, three common taxa, four present taxa, and eight rare taxa. At a third site on the creek, there are three abundant taxa, four common taxa, three present taxa, and seven rare taxa.|$|E

50|$|The CLASS {{instrument}} will survey 70% {{of the sky}} at millimeter wavelengths, in the microwave portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, from a ground-based observatory with a resolution of about 1° — approximately twice the angular size {{of the sun and}} moon as viewed from Earth. The CLASS array will consist of two altazimuth mounts that will allow the telescopes to be pointed to observe different patches of sky. The four CLASS telescopes will <b>observe</b> <b>at</b> a range of frequencies to separate emission from our galaxy from that of the CMB. One telescope will <b>observe</b> <b>at</b> 40 GHz (7.5 mm wavelength); two telescopes will <b>observe</b> <b>at</b> 90 GHz (3.3 mm wavelength); and the fourth telescope will observe in two frequency bands centered at 150 GHz (2 mm wavelength) and 220 GHz (1.4 mm wavelength). Two separate telescopes, <b>observing</b> <b>at</b> different frequencies, are housed on each mount.|$|R

5|$|A herbivore, {{the royal}} {{antelope}} prefers small quantities of fresh foliage and shoots; fruits and fungi {{may be taken}} occasionally. Though the antelope {{is considered to be}} nocturnal, zoologist Jonathan Kingdon holds that feeding occurs throughout the day, though some foraging may also be <b>observed</b> <b>at</b> night. In comparison to Bates's pygmy antelope, the royal antelope has a longer muzzle, broader lips, a smaller mouth and smaller cheek muscles. These features do not allow complete digestion of lignified growth. Individuals may often move into new locations foraging for fresh growth.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 38houses in Japan were destroyed, 110were damaged, {{and more than}} 2,000were flooded. Landslides were <b>observed</b> <b>at</b> 56 locations. Power was lost to 160,000families. A total of 165flights were cancelled, delaying 15,000 passengers. A total of 160 trains were cancelled. Two bullet train lines {{experienced}} delays in Kyushu; ferry and air service were also delayed there. Offshore, ten fishing boats sunk, including one Japanese cargo ship. An additional 12ships were rendered as missing. Ninety-five other boats took refuge in North Korea, though 59left on September2 to return to Japan.|$|E
5|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century, the Church of the Holy Mother of God was the {{terminus}} of two rival religious processions organised by the ethnic Greek and Bulgarian communities of Asenovgrad. A Greek procession took place in 1899 and a comparable Bulgarian one was carried out several years later. These processions began after a man claimed to have seen lights and heard chants while passing near the then-abandoned church. Both processions ended with a Divine Liturgy <b>observed</b> <b>at</b> night by the church.|$|E

50|$|Unlike the Deep Fields, the HUDF {{does not}} lie in Hubble's Continuous Viewing Zone (CVZ). The earlier observations, using the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) camera, {{were able to take}} {{advantage}} of the increased observing time on these zones by using wavelengths with higher noise to <b>observe</b> <b>at</b> times when earthshine contaminated the observations; however ACS does not <b>observe</b> <b>at</b> these wavelengths, so the advantage was reduced.|$|R

5|$|Black Moshannon Lake and the bogs of the Natural Area are {{especially}} important to the IBA. They serve as a stopover for migratory waterfowl and shorebirds. Waterfowl <b>observed</b> <b>at</b> the park include pied-billed and Slavonian grebes, common loon, American black duck, ruddy duck, blue-winged and green-winged teal, tundra swan, long-tailed duck, hooded and red-breasted merganser, greater and lesser scaup, northern pintail, bufflehead, American wigeon, and northern shoveler.|$|E
5|$|Damage totals in the United States are {{not fully}} known, {{although}} media summaries of Nora included a loss to agriculture preliminarily estimated at several hundred million dollars, {{and at least one}} study places the figure at $150–200 million (1997 USD). It is estimated that $30–40 million (1997 USD) in damage to lemon trees occurred. Although Nora was significantly weakened, near hurricane-force winds were <b>observed</b> <b>at</b> the Dixie National Forest in southwestern Utah, where strong gusts sheared off the tops of large trees.|$|E
5|$|Education {{during the}} college's early history {{was based on}} St Ignatius' Ratio Studiorum, with {{emphasis}} upon theology, classics and science, all of which still feature prominently in the curriculum. The educational practice, <b>observed</b> <b>at</b> the College of St Omer, of dividing a class into Romans and Carthaginians continued long after the migration to Stonyhurst but is not employed today; each pupil would be pitched against an opponent {{with the task of}} picking up on the other's mistakes in an attempt to score points.|$|E

5|$|In 1819, {{smoke was}} <b>observed</b> <b>at</b> the mountain. However, {{this is often}} not {{recorded}} as an eruption as the information was insufficient to identify it as such. Similarly, in 2003, a blowing cloud of snow was mistaken by {{an employee of the}} ConocoPhillips Building in Anchorage for an ash plume. Possible steam-vapor let off was observed in 1933 at the mountain.|$|E
5|$|Investigations of the {{mathematical}} structure of M-theory have spawned important theoretical results in physics and mathematics. More speculatively, M-theory {{may provide a}} framework for developing a unified theory of all of the fundamental forces of nature. Attempts to connect M-theory to experiment typically focus on compactifying its extra dimensions to construct candidate models of our four-dimensional world, although so far none has been verified to give rise to physics as <b>observed</b> <b>at,</b> for instance, the Large Hadron Collider.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-10c is the {{outermost}} {{of the two}} known planets of Kepler-10, completing one orbit of the star every 45.29485 days {{at a distance of}} 0.2407 AU. The inner planet, Kepler-10b, is a rocky planet that orbits every ~0.8 days at a distance of 0.01684 AU. Kepler-10c's equilibrium temperature is estimated at 584 K, almost four times hotter than Jupiter's. The planet's orbital inclination is 89.65º, or almost edge-on with respect to Earth and to Kepler-10. Transits have been <b>observed</b> <b>at</b> points where Kepler-10c has crossed in front of its host star.|$|E

5|$|RNA {{thermometers}} {{sensitive to}} temperatures of 37°C {{can be used}} by pathogens to activate infection-specific genes. For example, the upregulation of prfA, encoding a key transcriptional regulator of virulence genes in Listeria monocytogenes, was demonstrated by fusing the 5' DNA of prfA to the green fluorescent protein gene; the gene fusion was then transcribed from the T7 promoter in E. coli, and fluorescence was <b>observed</b> <b>at</b> 37°C but not at 30°C.|$|E
5|$|Subtle {{problems}} with the executive functions of attentiveness, planning, flexibility, and abstract thinking, or impairments in semantic memory (memory of meanings, and concept relationships) can also be symptomatic of {{the early stages of}} AD. Apathy can be <b>observed</b> <b>at</b> this stage, and remains the most persistent neuropsychiatric symptom throughout the course of the disease. Depressive symptoms, irritability and reduced awareness of subtle memory difficulties are also common.|$|E

5|$|The oribi is diurnal (active mainly {{during the}} day), though some {{activity}} {{may also be}} <b>observed</b> <b>at</b> night. The animal rests in cover during rain events. Unlike all other small antelopes, oribi can exhibit three types of mating systems, depending on the habitat – polyandry, polygyny and polygynandry; polygyny tends to prevail as the female-to-male ratio increases. A study suggested that polygyny is preferred in areas of high predator risk, as it leads to formation of groups as an anti-predator measure. Small herds of up to four members are also common.|$|E
