25|$|The {{securities}} can {{be issued}} {{with either a}} fixed interest rate or a floating rate under currency pegging system. Fixed rate ABS set the “coupon” (rate) {{at the time of}} issuance, in a fashion similar to corporate bonds and T-Bills. Floating rate securities may be backed by both amortizing and non-amortizing assets in the floating market. In contrast to fixed rate securities, the rates on “floaters” will periodically adjust up or down according to a designated index such as a U.S. Treasury rate, or, more typically, the London Interbank <b>Offered</b> <b>Rate</b> (LIBOR). The floating rate usually reflects the movement in the index plus an additional fixed margin to cover the added risk.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the most}} common indices are the rates on 1-year constant-maturity Treasury (CMT) securities, the cost of funds index (COFI), and the London Interbank <b>Offered</b> <b>Rate</b> (LIBOR). A few lenders use their own cost of funds as an index, rather than using other indices. This is done to ensure a steady margin for the lender, whose own cost of funding will usually {{be related to the}} index. Consequently, {{payments}} made by the borrower may change over time with the changing interest rate (alternatively, the term of the loan may change). This is distinct from the graduated payment mortgage, which offers changing payment amounts but a fixed interest rate. Other forms of mortgage loan include the interest-only mortgage, the fixed-rate mortgage, the negative amortization mortgage, and the balloon payment mortgage.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} {{suggested that}} candidates from some black and minority ethnic groups {{were less likely}} to receive an offer of a place from an ‘old’ university. These findings were disputed in a re-analysis carried out for HEFCE which found that only Pakistani candidates were significantly less likely to receive offers (from both ‘old’ and ‘new’ universities). In this paper we return to the question of ethnic differences in university <b>offer</b> <b>rates,</b> examining UCAS admissions data for 2008. We use a cross-classified multi-level modelling approach to predict the probability that applications from candidates from different ethnic groups will receive an offer. Controlling for variables seeking to capture the academic quality of applications we find significant differences between <b>offer</b> <b>rates</b> for different ethnic groups. Significantly lower <b>offer</b> <b>rates</b> remained for the main ethnic groups when social characteristics were also taken into account in the model (social class background, gender and school type). However, <b>offer</b> <b>rates</b> for candidates from mixed ethnic groups were not significantly different from those for white British candidates. Our analysis did not find evidence of differences in <b>offer</b> <b>rates</b> from higher and lower status institutions for black and minority ethnic candidates relative to white British applicants...|$|R

25|$|On 27 March 2012, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) {{signed an}} {{agreement}} to lend $250 million to BMRC to part-finance Phase 2 of the metro rail project. The loan marked the multilateral lending agency's foray into the urban transport sector in South Asia, the ADB said in a press release. The loan, approved by the ADB Board in March 2011, is the first ADB loan to the urban transport sector without recourse to sovereign guarantees. In 2016, the Agence Francaise De Development (AFD) sanctioned a 1,600 crore loan for the project. The rate of interest on the loan is linked to Euro Interbank <b>Offered</b> <b>Rate</b> (Euribor) + 130 basis points. In early 2017, the European Investment Bank agreed to loan 3,700 crore to the BMRCL, with a repayment period of 20 years {{at a rate of}} interest lower than the one on the AFD loan.|$|E
25|$|Lower Manhattan {{is home to}} the New York Stock Exchange, on Wall Street, and the NASDAQ, at 165 Broadway, {{representing}} the world's largest and second largest stock exchanges, respectively, when measured both by overall average daily trading volume and by total market capitalization of their listed companies in 2013. Investment banking fees on Wall Street totaled approximately $40 billion in 2012, while in 2013, senior New York City bank officers who manage risk and compliance functions earned as much as $324,000 annually. In fiscal year 2013–14, Wall Street's securities industry generated 19% of New York State's tax revenue. New York City remains the largest global center for trading in public equity and debt capital markets, driven in part by the size and financial development of the U.S. economy. In July 2013, NYSE Euronext, the operator of the New York Stock Exchange, took over the administration of the London interbank <b>offered</b> <b>rate</b> from the British Bankers Association. New York also leads in hedge fund management; private equity; and the monetary volume of mergers and acquisitions. Several investment banks and investment managers headquartered in Manhattan are important participants in other global financial centers. New York is also the principal commercial banking center of the United States.|$|E
500|$|In December 2012, UBS {{agreed to}} pay US$1.5 billion to settle a case filed by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission alleging that UBS engaged in a {{criminal}} conspiracy to rig the London Interbank <b>Offered</b> <b>Rate</b> (Libor) benchmarks used on loans via company's Japan-based subsidiary. UBS has also been charged by British and Swiss financial regulators for its Libor manipulation scheme. In settling the case, the bank acknowledged wrongdoing. UBS Chief Executive Sergio Ermotti said, [...] "We are taking responsibility for what happened," [...] and said that all the employees linked to the scam had already left the bank. The U.S. fine would contribute to the bank's loss of US$2.7 billion in the fourth quarter.|$|E

This agreement was dependent on the bank adhering to US laws and staying out of trouble with the US authorities for two years. The deal was struck in 2012, and forex investigations started {{less than a year}} later, resulting in the non-prosecution status being scrapped. On top of the $203 million fine, UBS has had to plead guilty to one count of wire fraud in the previous Libor scandal {{as part of the deal}} with the US Department of Justice to end investigations into its conduct in the current forex scandal. As of May 2015, UBS is in a three-year probation period with the justice department.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2012, as {{a result}} of an {{international}} investigation, Barclays Bank was fined a total of £290million (US$450million) for manipulating the daily settings of London Interbank <b>Offered</b> <b>Rate</b> (Libor) and the Euro Interbank <b>Offered</b> <b>Rate</b> (Euribor). The United States Department of Justice and Barclays officially agreed that [...] "the manipulation of the submissions affected the fixed rates on some occasions". The bank was found to have made 'inappropriate submissions' of rates which formed part of the Libor and Euribor setting processes, sometimes to make a profit, and other times to make the bank look more secure during the financial crisis. This happened between 2005 and 2009, as often as daily.|$|E
2500|$|Another observer, Salman Ali, {{found that}} many of the sukuk {{structures}} [...] "do not conform to the Shariah".

They often combine more than one contract, [...] "which individually may be Shariah-compliant" [...] but when combined [...] "may defeat the objective of the shariah". Furthermore, the sukuk rate of return is often [...] "tied" [...] to the Libor (London interbank <b>offered</b> <b>rate)</b> or Euribor (euro interbank <b>offered</b> <b>rate)</b> interest rate [...] "rather than to the underlying business" [...] that the sukuk is financing. This makes the sukuk [...] "so similar to conventional debt instruments {{that it is difficult to}} tell one from the other". Ali believes this may be why rating agencies such as Standard & Poors and Moody's apply the same methodology for rating sukuk as for conventional debt instruments.|$|E

30|$|Note, since borrowers only take-up {{candidate}} <b>offers,</b> the <b>rate</b> set by {{the lender}} maximizing on expected profit is a candidate offer. We did not relate this {{to the quality of}} the candidate offer, i.e., the sequential decision model presented in this section seems to indicate a lower candidate <b>offer</b> <b>rates</b> does not attract more customers as would be expected in practice. The scenario presented here assumes the lender is cognizant of the order in which his offer lies within a sequence of offers. In our model, we assumed all consumers had received the same past offers prior to the current offer. In practice, when an offer is made, a lower <b>offer</b> <b>rate</b> attracts a higher take-up rate, i.e., the quality of the candidate offer affects the response rate. This may be attributed to each borrower receiving multiple offers from different lenders and hence, each borrower is at a different point on their sequences of offers.|$|R
