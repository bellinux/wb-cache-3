5|$|In April 1940, {{early in}} the Second World War, Nazi Germany invaded and {{occupied}} Denmark. To prevent the Germans from discovering Max von Laue's and James Franck's gold Nobel medals, Bohr had de Hevesy dissolve them in aqua regia. In this form, they were stored <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>shelf</b> at the Institute until after the war, when the gold was precipitated and the medals re-struck by the Nobel Foundation. Bohr kept the Institute running, but all the foreign scholars departed.|$|E

According to the Associated Press, the guns were <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>shelf</b> next to the door and the SEALs did not see them until they were photographing the body.|$|E
5|$|The {{adults of}} some Australian cicada {{are subject to}} a cicada-specific fungus from the genus Massospora, which grows on their {{genitalia}} and abdominal cavity, eventually causing the tail end to drop off. Australian cicadas are further preyed on by the cicada killer wasp (Exeirus lateritius), which stings and paralyses cicadas high in the trees. Their victims drop to the ground where the cicada-hunter mounts and carries them, pushing with its hind legs, sometimes over a distance of 100m (330ft). They are then shoved into the hunter's burrow, where the helpless cicada is placed <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>shelf</b> in an often extensive 'catacomb', to form food-stock for the wasp grub growing from the eggs deposited within.|$|E

Additional scenes include Dwight complaining about Jim's pranks while Michael was on vacation, Roy helping Ryan with inventory, Andy challenging Dwight to a box-stacking race, and Meredith climbing <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>shelf,</b> which falls and traps her.|$|E
5|$|Franck found a {{position}} at the Polytekniske Læreanstalt in Copenhagen for Arthur von Hippel, who was now his son in law, having married his daughter Dagmar. He decided to provide financial security for his children by dividing his Nobel Prize money between them. The gold medal itself was entrusted to Niels Bohr for safekeeping. When Germany invaded Denmark on 9 April 1940, the Hungarian chemist George de Hevesy dissolved the gold medal, along with that of Max von Laue in aqua regia to prevent the Germans from taking them. He placed the resulting solution <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>shelf</b> in his laboratory at the Niels Bohr Institute. After the war, he returned to find the solution undisturbed and precipitated the gold out of the acid. The Nobel Society then recast the Nobel Prize medals.|$|E
5|$|Using a wheelchair, Orson (Kyle MacLachlan) {{continues}} to order Bree (Marcia Cross) around at his whim {{and refuses to}} let her give him a bath. When Orson refuses to say please while Bree brings him breakfast, she places the waffles <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>shelf</b> he cannot reach. When the physical therapist arrives, he pretends to be starving and abused. The therapist tells Bree she must be more patient, or she will be reported. Later, when Orson still refuses to be bathed, Bree takes him outside and sprays him with the garden hose until he begs her to stop. He breaks down and admits he is miserable at the prospective of a life in which he needs {{to ask for help}} in everything. Bree finally understands, and asks Orson for forgiveness.|$|E

Andy's mom puts Woody <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>shelf,</b> and Andy leaves without Woody. The next day, Woody finds that Wheezy, a penguin squeaky toy, has been shelved for months due to a broken squeaker. Andy's mother puts Wheezy in a yard sale, but Woody rescues him, only to be stolen by a greedy toy collector, who takes him to his apartment. Buzz Lightyear {{and the rest of}} Andy's toys {{identify}} the thief from a commercial to be Al McWhiggin, the owner of a toy store called Al's Toy Barn. Buzz, Hamm, Mr. Potato Head, Slinky Dog, and Rex set out to rescue Woody.|$|E

25|$|Such 78rpm {{records were}} usually sold separately, in brown paper or {{cardboard}} sleeves that were sometimes plain and sometimes printed {{to show the}} producer or the retailer's name.

Records could be laid <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>shelf</b> horizontally or stood upright on an edge, but because of their fragility, many broke in storage.|$|E

25|$|These {{libraries}} are {{the largest}} among up to 60 private or public libraries that are estimated to exist in Timbuktu today, although some comprise {{little more than a}} row of books <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>shelf</b> or a bookchest. Under these circumstances, the manuscripts are vulnerable to damage and theft, as well as long term climate damage, despite Timbuktu's arid climate. Two Timbuktu Manuscripts Projects funded by independent universities have aimed to preserve them.|$|E
25|$|Power during flight {{originated}} with four silver-zinc batteries with a nominal voltage of 28±2 vdc. Battery D10 sat <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>shelf</b> at location 5, batteries D30 and D40 were on shelves in location 4, and battery D20 was at location 24. Two power supplies converted the unregulated battery power to regulated 56 vdc and 5 vdc. The 56 vdc power supply was at location 1 and provided {{power to the}} ST-124-M3 platform electronic assembly and the accelerometer signal conditioner. The 5 vdc power supply at location 12 provided 5 ±.005 vdc to the IU measuring system.|$|E

25|$|When Nazi Germany invaded Denmark in World War II, the Hungarian chemist George de Hevesy {{dissolved}} the Nobel Prize {{gold medals}} of Laue and James Franck in aqua regia {{to prevent the}} Nazis from discovering them. At the time, it was illegal to take gold out of the country, and {{if it had been}} discovered that Laue had done so he could have faced prosecution in Germany. Hevesy placed the resulting solution <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>shelf</b> in his laboratory at the Niels Bohr Institute. After the war, he returned to find the solution undisturbed and precipitated the gold out of the acid. The Nobel Society then re-cast the Nobel Prize gold medals, using the original gold.|$|E
25|$|A day later, on Saturday, August 25, Rolling {{broke into}} the {{apartment}} where 18-year-old Christa Hoyt lived by prying open a sliding glass door with a KA-BAR knife and a screwdriver, {{but she was not}} home. He waited in the living room for her to return. At 11 a.m. she entered the apartment and Rolling surprised her from behind, placing her in a choke-hold. After she had been subdued, he taped her mouth shut, bound her wrists together and led her into the bedroom, where he cut the clothes from her body and raped her. As in the Powell murder, he forced her face-down and stabbed her in the back, rupturing her heart. He then decapitated the body and posed her head <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>shelf</b> facing the corpse, adding to the shock of whoever discovered her.|$|E
25|$|The {{work was}} ready for {{publication}} {{by the end of}} 1894, but no funds were available to have it printed. Each year Nevill urged the Natal government in his annual Report of the Government Astronomer to provide funds for publication, but to no avail. In his report for 1898 he wrote despairingly: The investigations of the errors in the lunar tables have been wrapped up in brown paper, tied up with red tape, and put away <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>shelf</b> until such time as a vote can be obtained to publish it… The next year disaster struck when the manuscript was damaged during a rainstorm owing to a leak in the observatory's roof. In subsequent years similar work was done by others, notably E.W. Brown in the United States, M. Radau in France, and P.H. Cowell in Britain, who received the credit. In 1907 Nevill related this sad history in his presidential address to Section A of the South African Association for the Advancement of Science.|$|E
