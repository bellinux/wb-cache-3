40|$|SUMMARY: Flow imaging with cardiac-gated phase-contrast MR has {{applications}} {{in the management of}} neurologic disorders. Together with computational fluid dynamics, phase-contrast MR has advanced our understanding of spinal CSF flow. Phase-contrast MR is used to evaluate patients with Chiari I malformation who are candidates for surgical treatment. In theory, abnormal CSF flow resulting from the abnormal tonsil position causes syringomyelia and other neurologic signs and symptoms in patients with Chiari I. CSF flow imaging also has research {{applications in}} syringomyelia and spinal stenosis. To optimize MR acquisition and interpretation, neuroradiologists must have familiarity with healthy and pathologic patterns of CSF flow. The purpose of this review is to update concepts of CSF flow that are important for the practice of flow imaging in the spine. ABBREVIATION: PCMR phase-contrast MR In the spinal canal, oscillatory CSF flow results primarily fromthe displacement of approximately 1. 5 mL of fluid 1 from the cranial cavity as intracranial blood vessels expand in arterial sys-tole (Monro-Kellie doctrine).
