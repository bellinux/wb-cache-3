5|$|The American Red Cross ran out {{of funds}} while {{responding}} {{to the effects of}} Juan and the mid-Atlantic flooding, following the previous responses to hurricanes Elena and Gloria, as well as flooding in Puerto Rico; this prompted an emergency fundraising appeal. The agency had provided about $8million worth of assistance to families in southern Louisiana. Along the Apalachicola Bay, the series of hurricane strikes severely damaged the local oyster industry, leaving hundreds of oystermen out of work. The high waves caused by Juan prompted the United States Minerals Management Service to recommend increased inspections on older rigs and improve evacuation plans. Hurricane Juan was <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> of hurricanes that struck Louisiana coast over many years that contributed to the loss of the coastal wetlands.|$|E
5|$|The Samlesbury witches {{were three}} {{women from the}} Lancashire village of Samlesbury– Jane Southworth, Jennet Bierley, and Ellen Bierley– accused by a 14-year-old girl, Grace Sowerbutts, of practising witchcraft. Their trial at Lancaster Assizes in England on 19August 1612 was <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> of witch trials held there over two days, among the most famous in English history. The trials were unusual for England {{at that time in}} two respects: Thomas Potts, the clerk to the court, {{published}} the proceedings in his The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster; and the number of the accused found guilty and hanged was unusually high, ten at Lancaster and another at York. All three of the Samlesbury women were acquitted however.|$|E
5|$|The {{meeting was}} <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> held in Zagreb and Washington, D.C. {{following}} the March 1994 Washington Agreement. The agreement ended the Croat–Bosniak War, re-allied the ARBiH and the HVO against the VRS and provided Croatia with US military advisors from the Military Professional Resources Incorporated (MPRI). MPRI was hired because a UN arms embargo {{was still in}} place, ostensibly to prepare the HV for NATO Partnership for Peace programme participation. The organization trained HV officers and personnel for 14 weeks from January to April 1995. It was also speculated that the MPRI also provided doctrinal advice, scenario planning and US government satellite information to Croatia. MPRI and Croatian officials dismissed such speculation. In November 1994, the US unilaterally ended the arms embargo against Bosnia and Herzegovina, in effect allowing the HV to supply itself as arms shipments entered through Croatia. The US involvement reflected a new military strategy endorsed by President Bill Clinton since February 1993.|$|E

25|$|The 1971 San Fernando {{earthquake}} (also {{known as}} the Sylmar earthquake) occurred {{in the early morning}} of February 9 {{in the foothills of the}} San Gabriel Mountains in southern California.

25|$|The Battle of Ban Houei Sane was {{a battle}} of the Vietnam War that began {{on the night of}} 23 January 1968, when the 24th Regiment of the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) 304th Division overran the small Laotian Army outpost at Ban Houei Sane. The {{fighting}} at Ban Houei Sane was <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> of battles fought between Communist and Allied forces during the Tet Offensive. The small outpost, defended by the personnel of the 33rd Elephant Battalion (BV-33), was attacked and overwhelmed by the vastly superior PAVN and their PT-76 light tanks. The failure of the 33rd Elephant Battalion to defend their outpost at Ban Houei Sane would have negative consequences only a few weeks later, when the PAVN would strike again at Lang Vei.|$|E
25|$|The Galleanisti of Boston held demonstrations, rioted, and {{committed}} acts of terrorism. On December 6, 1916, the Galleanist Alfonso Fagotti {{was arrested for}} stabbing a policeman during a riot in North Square. The next day Galleanists bombed the Salutation Street station of the Boston harbor police. Fagotti was convicted, imprisoned, and later deported to Italy. On June 2, 1919, Carlo Valdinoci, a Galleanist from Roxbury, was killed trying to deliver a bomb to U.S. Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer; this was <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> of anarchist bombings {{that led to the}} Palmer Raids. Another Boston anarchist, Antonio Cesarini of Roxbury, was among those arrested during a riot that erupted during a labor march in Roxbury on May 1, 1919. Two police officers and a civilian were shot, another officer was stabbed, dozens of officers and marchers were injured, and 113 marchers were arrested. Fourteen were sent to prison by the presiding judge, Albert F. Hayden; a few days later, Hayden's home was bombed, causing a great deal of damage but no injuries.|$|E
25|$|In 1944, {{with his}} post {{doctoral}} researcher, William von Eggers Doering, Woodward reported {{the synthesis of}} the alkaloid quinine, used to treat malaria. Although the synthesis was publicized as a breakthrough in procuring the hard to get medicinal compound from Japanese occupied southeast Asia, in reality it was too long and tedious to adopt on a practical scale. Nevertheless, it was a landmark for chemical synthesis. Woodward's particular insight in this synthesis was to realise that the German chemist Paul Rabe had converted a precursor of quinine called quinotoxine to quinine in 1905. Hence, a synthesis of quinotoxine (which Woodward actually synthesized) would establish a route to synthesizing quinine. When Woodward accomplished this feat, organic synthesis was still largely a matter of trial and error, and nobody thought that such complex structures could actually be constructed. Woodward showed that organic synthesis could {{be made into a}} rational science, and that synthesis could be aided by well-established principles of reactivity and structure. This synthesis was the first <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> of exceedingly complicated and elegant syntheses that he would undertake.|$|E

25|$|Rathenau's {{assassination}} was but <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> {{of terrorist}} attacks by Organisation Consul. Most notable among them had been the assassination of former finance minister Matthias Erzberger in August 1921. While Fischer and Kern prepared their plot, former chancellor Philipp Scheidemann barely survived an attempt on his life by Organisation Consul assassins on 4 June 1922. Historian Martin Sabrow points to Hermann Ehrhardt, the undisputed leader of the Organisation Consul, {{as the one who}} ordered the murders. Ehrhardt and his men believed that Rathenau's death would bring down the government and prompt the Left to act against the Weimar Republic, thereby provoking civil war, in which the Organisation Consul would be called on for help by the Reichswehr. After an anticipated victory Ehrhardt hoped to establish an authoritarian regime or a military dictatorship. In order not to be completely delegitimized by the murder of Rathenau, Ehrhardt carefully saw to it that no connections between him and the assassins could be detected. Although Fischer and Kern connected with the Berlin chapter of the Organisation Consul to use its resources, they mainly acted on their own in planning and carrying out the assassination.|$|E
