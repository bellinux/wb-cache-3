5|$|Major General George B. McClellan, {{commanding}} the Army <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Potomac,</b> determined {{to take the}} Confederate capital of Richmond via the Virginia Peninsula. This unexpected move would, in theory, allow McClellan's army to move quickly up the peninsula rather than fighting through Northern Virginia. During March 1862, the Army <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Potomac</b> was gradually transferred by water to Fortress Monroe {{at the end of}} the Virginia Peninsula. On March 10, 1862, the 22nd left their winter camp and were shipped to Fortress Monroe. By April 4, the regiment began to advance, along with many other elements of the Army <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Potomac,</b> up the peninsula.|$|E
5|$|Generals from Massachusetts {{commanded}} several army departments, {{and included}} a {{commander of the}} Army <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Potomac</b> {{as well as a}} number of army corps commanders.|$|E
5|$|However, lacking {{requested}} reinforcements from McClellan, now {{commanding the}} Army <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Potomac,</b> Pope was soundly defeated at the Second Battle of Bull Run {{in the summer}} of 1862, forcing the Army <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Potomac</b> to defend Washington for a second time. The war also expanded with naval operations in 1862 when the CSS Virginia, formerly the USS Merrimack, damaged or destroyed three Union vessels in Norfolk, Virginia, before being engaged and damaged by the USS Monitor. Lincoln closely reviewed the dispatches and interrogated naval officers during their clash in the Battle of Hampton Roads.|$|E

5|$|The Union Army <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Potomac,</b> under Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker, {{consisted}} of seven infantry corps, a cavalry corps, and an Artillery Reserve, for a combined strength {{of more than}} 100,000 men.|$|E
5|$|Alexander {{continued}} {{in this role}} during the Engineering Brigade's deployment with the Army <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Potomac</b> during the Peninsula Campaign, several times performing ably under hostile fire. He was appointed a brevet lieutenant colonel for his service at the Siege of Yorktown, as of May 4, 1862. Following the abandonment of the campaign {{and the return of}} the Army <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Potomac</b> to northern Virginia, General Barnard, now chief engineer of defenses of Washington, D.C., requested Alexander serve as his aide-de-camp. Alexander accepted and served in that capacity throughout 1862. When the Topographical Engineers and the Army Corps of Engineers were merged on March 3, 1863, Alexander (whose permanent U.S. Army rank was captain until this time) was promoted to major, while retaining his brevet (honorary) rank of lieutenant colonel.|$|E
50|$|Custer's {{expeditionary force}} {{contained}} cavalry regiments {{from at least}} two divisions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Army <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Potomac's</b> Cavalry Corps. A section of Parrot rifles from Battery E, 1st U.S. Artillery under First Lieutenant David Essex Porter accompanied Custer's column to provide artillery support.

25|$|At <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> 1862, Henry J. Hunt {{attempted}} {{to get the}} Parrott eliminated from <b>the</b> Army <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Potomac's</b> inventory, preferring <b>the</b> 3-inch ordnance rifle. During battles when the Parrott gun would burst, artillerists would chip out the jagged parts and continue firing. In 1889, The New York Times called on <b>the</b> Ordnance Bureau <b>of</b> <b>the</b> War Department to discontinue use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Parrott gun altogether, following a series <b>of</b> mishaps at <b>the</b> West Point training grounds.|$|R

5|$|Inquirer {{journalist}} Uriah Hunt Painter {{was at the}} First Battle of Bull Run in 1861, {{a battle}} which ended in a Confederate victory. Initial reports from the government claimed a Union victory, but The Inquirer went with Painter's firsthand account. Crowds threatened to burn The Inquirers building down because of the report. Another report, this time about General George Meade, angered Meade enough that he punished Edward Crapsey, the reporter who wrote it. Crapsey and other war correspondents later decided to attribute any victories of the Army <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Potomac,</b> Meade's command, to Ulysses S. Grant, commander of the entire Union army. Any defeats of the Army <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Potomac</b> would be attributed to Meade.|$|E

50|$|Colonel Walter Phelps {{was chosen}} as <b>the</b> {{original}} commander <b>of</b> <b>the</b> regiment, and after his promotion to brigade commander, Major John McKie became regimental commander. The regiment suffered its first fatality when passing through Baltimore, when a man was killed by friendly fire during confusion among a mob.

50|$|Following <b>the</b> {{conclusion}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war, members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 5th New York Veterans Association {{continued to}} hold monthly meetings.

5|$|That September, McKinley's {{regiment}} {{was called}} east to reinforce General John Pope's Army of Virginia at the Second Battle of Bull Run. Delayed in passing through Washington, D.C., the 23rd Ohio did not arrive {{in time for}} the battle, but joined the Army <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Potomac</b> as it hurried north to cut off Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia as it advanced into Maryland. The 23rd was the first regiment to encounter the Confederates at the Battle of South Mountain on September 14. After severe losses, Union forces drove back the Confederates and continued to Sharpsburg, Maryland, where they engaged Lee's army at the Battle of Antietam, one of the bloodiest battles of the war. The 23rd was also {{in the thick of the}} fighting at Antietam, and McKinley himself came under heavy fire when bringing rations to the men on the line. McKinley's regiment again suffered many casualties, but the Army <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Potomac</b> was victorious and the Confederates retreated into Virginia. The regiment was then detached from the Army <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Potomac</b> and returned by train to western Virginia.|$|E
5|$|The Union {{army had}} {{occupied}} strong defensive positions, and Meade handled his forces well, resulting in heavy losses {{for both sides}} but leaving the disposition of forces on both sides essentially unchanged. Lee's hope of crushing the Army <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Potomac</b> on Northern territory was dashed, but undaunted, he began {{to plan for the}} third day of fighting.|$|E
50|$|In 1862, {{after the}} American Civil War raged for a year, Barney joined the 7th New York Militia Regiment (Company F) as a Private for 90-day service.

5|$|Around 1 p.m., from 150 to 170 Confederate guns {{began an}} {{artillery}} bombardment {{that was probably}} <b>the</b> largest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war.

Gen. Henry Jackson Hunt, at first did not return the enemy's fire. After waiting about 15 minutes, about 80 U.S. cannons added to the din. <b>The</b> Army <b>of</b> Northern Virginia was critically low on artillery ammunition, and the cannonade did not significantly affect the Union position.|$|R

5|$|The {{fighting}} of the Eastern Theater of the American Civil War between Lieutenant General Ulysses S.

5|$|The {{south bank}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Potomac</b> River forms the District's border with Virginia {{and has two}} major tributaries: the Anacostia River and Rock Creek. Tiber Creek, a natural {{watercourse}} that once passed through the National Mall, was fully enclosed underground during the 1870s. The creek also formed {{a portion of the}} now-filled Washington City Canal, which allowed passage through the city to the Anacostia River from 1815 until the 1850s. The Chesapeake and Ohio Canal starts in Georgetown and was used during the 19th century to bypass the Little Falls <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Potomac</b> River, located at the northwest edge of Washington at the Atlantic Seaboard fall line.|$|E
