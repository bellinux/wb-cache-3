5|$|Artists in {{the eighteenth}} century (e.g., Henry Fuseli, William Rimmer) {{depicted}} the witches variously, as have many directors since. Some have exaggerated or sensationalised the hags, or have adapted them to different cultures, as in Orson Welles's rendition of the weird sisters as voodoo priestesses. Some film adaptations have cast the witches as such modern analogues as hippies <b>on</b> <b>drugs,</b> or goth schoolgirls. Their influence reaches the literary realm as well in such works as the Discworld and Harry Potter series.|$|E

5|$|One Hot Minute was {{the only}} album that guitarist Dave Navarro {{recorded}} with the band. His presence altered the Red Hot Chili Peppers' sound considerably. It contains fewer sexual themes than previous records and explores darker subject matters, such as drug use, depression, anguish, and grief. It also re-integrated use of heavy metal guitar riffs. Vocalist Anthony Kiedis, who had resumed addictions to cocaine and heroin in 1994 after being sober {{for more than five}} years, approached his lyricism with a reflective outlook <b>on</b> <b>drugs</b> and their harsh effects.|$|E
5|$|Station to Station is {{the tenth}} studio album by English {{musician}} David Bowie, released by RCA Records in 1976.

The album was recorded after he completed shooting Nicolas Roeg's The Man Who Fell to Earth, and the cover artwork featured a still from the movie. During the sessions Bowie was heavily dependent <b>on</b> <b>drugs,</b> especially cocaine, and later claimed that he recalled almost nothing of the production.|$|E

5|$|After unsuccessfully {{searching for}} a vocalist for nearly six months, Mustaine decided to handle the vocal duties himself, while also serving as the band's primary lyricist, main {{songwriter}} and co-lead and rhythm guitarist. Early in 1984, Megadeth recorded a three song demo engineered by Karat Faye, and {{on the strength of}} that demo, the band was asked to sign with the New York-based independent label Combat Records. Early in 1985, Megadeth was given $8,000 by Combat to record and produce its debut album. However, this proved not to be enough and the band was given a further $4,000. Instead, a majority of the budget was spent <b>on</b> <b>drugs,</b> alcohol, and food, forcing the group to fire the original producer and produce the record themselves. The album was successfully recorded at the Indigo Ranch Studios, in Malibu, California.|$|E
5|$|Born to an Aymara {{family of}} {{subsistence}} farmers in Isallawi, Orinoca Canton, Morales undertook a basic education before mandatory military service, in 1978 moving to Chapare Province. Growing coca {{and becoming a}} trade unionist, he rose to prominence in the campesino ("rural laborers") union. In that capacity he campaigned against U.S. and Bolivian attempts to eradicate coca {{as part of the}} War <b>on</b> <b>Drugs,</b> denouncing these as an imperialist violation of indigenous Andean culture. His involvement in anti-government direct action protests resulted in multiple arrests. Morales entered electoral politics in 1995, became the leader of the MAS and was elected to Congress. His campaign focused on issues affecting indigenous and poor communities, advocating land reform and the redistribution of gas wealth. He gained increased visibility through the Cochabamba protests and gas conflict. In 2002 he was expelled from Congress for encouraging protesters, although he came second in that year's presidential election.|$|E

While there, she also met children with disabilities at a special school maintained by the army. In August, along with Mumbai-based artist Gurcharan Singh, Zinta painted for the cause of street children for the non-governmental organisation Khushi.

5|$|Jacobson's case {{attracted}} {{some national}} media attention. Civil liberties advocates supported him, worried {{over what they}} saw as dangerous growth in government police powers during the Reagan and Bush administrations, when law enforcement were alleged to have cracked down <b>on</b> <b>drugs</b> as well as pornography distribution {{at the behest of the}} Religious Right. Operation Looking Glass, the USPS claimed, had netted 147 convictions, but only 35 where evidence was found that the offenders had either been involved in producing child pornography or molested children. Critics claimed that the government was exaggerating the child-porn problem at best and contributing to it at worst, possibly by introducing some consumers to material they might never have developed a taste for otherwise.|$|E
5|$|Kiedis {{knew that}} the band's sound would inevitably change when Navarro joined. In June 1994, the band entered The Sound Factory, a {{recording}} studio in Los Angeles, to record the album. The band completed a few basic tracks, when Kiedis began having difficulty singing. He had been through a dental procedure in which an addictive sedative, Valium, was used; this caused him to relapse, and he once again became dependent <b>on</b> <b>drugs.</b> Kiedis had slipped from five years of sobriety and began reusing narcotics he'd sworn never to use again. The band took a short break from recording to perform at Woodstock '94, {{which was the first}} show Navarro played with the Red Hot Chili Peppers.|$|E

5|$|Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good! is {{the debut}} studio album by the American thrash metal band Megadeth {{released}} on June 12, 1985 {{by the independent}} record label Combat Records. At the beginning of 1985, the band was given $8,000 by Combat to record and produce its debut album. After spending half of the album's budget <b>on</b> <b>drugs,</b> alcohol and food, the band was forced to fire their original producer and produce the album themselves. Despite the resulting poor production, the album was a well-received effort that obtained strong reviews in various music publications. Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good! played {{an essential role in}} establishing thrash metal as an authentic subgenre of heavy metal music. It explores themes of death, violence, and occultism.|$|E
5|$|Klaus Dodds {{has noted}} {{that there is a}} geopolitical aspect to the {{locations}} used, although this is often a pre-emption of an issue by the film. For example, in the first film, Dr. No, the title villain's disruption of the American Project Mercury space launch from Cape Canaveral with his atomic-powered radio beam mirrored claims that American rocket testing at Cape Canaveral had problems with rockets going astray. Similarly Bond's anti-heroin mission in Live and Let Die coincided with President Nixon's 1972 declaration of a War <b>on</b> <b>Drugs,</b> whilst GoldenEye played against the backdrop of Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative.|$|E
