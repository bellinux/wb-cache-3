5|$|From November 1984 to June 1987 the DeKalb County Courthouse {{underwent}} {{an interior}} restoration, which {{was completed in}} time for the sesquicentennial celebration for DeKalb County. The restoration, at an approximate cost of $100,000, was undertaken by Conrad Schmitt Studios of New Berlin, Wisconsin. The modern front doors to the courthouse hide the original, beveled glass front doors from view. Once inside the modern doors, the nonfunctional original doors can be seen, standing wide open, to be admired; each door weighs several hundred pounds. Past the doors, in the building's main lobby, is the large, marble staircase to the second floor. The staircase, as well as the lobby's wainscoting, is done in gray Tennessee marble. Most of the first floor is original to the building, including the hexagonal marble flooring, stained glass windows and two original, first floor courtrooms. The plasterwork along the walls and ceilings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lobby</b> is ornately decorated.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} <b>the</b> <b>lobbying</b> power <b>of</b> different interest groups and public education spending in a panel data estimation during the period 1996 - 2009 for 132 countries. The resource rents, manufacture exports, and agriculture value added are used as proxy variables for <b>the</b> <b>lobbying</b> power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> natural resource owners, manufacturers, and landowners, respectively, in order to substantiate <b>the</b> definition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lobbying</b> power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interest groups more with economic fundamentals. As lobbying power is mediated through political institutions, different governance indicators are used individually and in interaction terms with the proxy variables in the estimations. It is found that when the country is more politically stable and the more <b>the</b> rule <b>of</b> law applies, <b>the</b> negative (positive) effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lobbying</b> power <b>of</b> natural resource owners (manufacturers) on public education spending intensifies. <b>The</b> negative effect <b>of</b> landowners’ lobbying power diminishes as institutional quality as measured by governance indicators improves. </span...|$|R
25|$|The {{staircases}} in {{the four}} corners <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lobby</b> leading {{down to the basement}} floor were originally embellished with a four-piece commissioned sculpture, The 20th Century–Thames by Keith Milow. Around 2014, one of the tondi was removed to make room for a restaurant. The other three remain in situ.|$|E
25|$|The {{entrance}} is sheltered under an arch covered with Pewabic tile; two figures by sculptor Corrado Parducci flank the door. On the interior, the lobby contains stained glass windows, and the vault {{is covered with}} brightly colored Rookwood tile, coordinated by Mary Chase Perry Stratton; the structure is modelled after Beauvais Cathedral. A mural map of Michigan dominates one end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lobby.</b>|$|E
25|$|State {{of the art}} for its time, the Smith Terminal {{eventually}} became victim to airline expansion. The design of the building did not allow for physical expansion of the ticketing area. To accommodate additional airlines, ticketing counters were constructed on the sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lobby</b> in areas that previously held lounges and retail. In contrast, the North Terminal was constructed with future expansion in mind.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Despite <b>the</b> {{prevalence}} <b>of</b> grandfathered permits, {{we still}} observe that a hybrid policy, {{in which a}} fraction of initial emission permits is distributed through auctions, is adopted in some cases. We also observe that some polluting industries support auctioned permits, and that most environmental groups support grandfathered permits. This paper at-tempts to explain these phenomena from <b>the</b> perspective <b>of</b> political economy, and investi-gates {{the conditions under which}} grandfathering, auctions, or a hybrid instrument will be the equilibrium policy. By constructing a two-stage lobbying game, in which <b>the</b> type <b>of</b> policy instrument (auction, grandfathering, or a hybrid instrument) is determined in the first stage, and then <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> permits is decided in the second stage, we highlight <b>the</b> strategic interaction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lobbying</b> activities between <b>the</b> two stages in explaining <b>the</b> behavior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lobbying</b> groups...|$|R
25|$|The {{building}} has been refurbished three times {{since it opened}} in 1976. In 1989 the building underwent a minor refurbishment {{at a cost of}} $1.5 million. Then, starting in 1999, the building underwent an extensive internal refurbishment which cost $2.5 million. The project involved a refit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lobby,</b> replacement of lift cars and improvement to core services like lighting.

Three sets of stairs are symmetrically {{laid out in the}} scheme: one of secondary importance at either side of the lobby; the most public one next to side entrances at the L-shaped circulation wings. A third set of stairs faces the patios and is the only one not to connect to the building's basement where more classrooms are found.|$|E

25|$|Moss {{performed}} the shots featuring Trinity {{at the beginning}} of the film and all the wire stunts herself. The rooftop set that Trinity uses to escape from Agent Brown early in the film was left over from the production of Dark City, which has prompted comments due to the thematic similarities of the films. During the rehearsal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lobby</b> scene, in which Trinity runs on a wall, Moss injured her leg and was ultimately unable to film the shot in one take. She stated that she was under a lot of pressure at the time and was devastated when she realized that she would be unable to do it.|$|E
25|$|The queue area {{winds through}} gardens filled with statues from many {{different}} countries up to the Hotel Hightower, where guests {{can see that the}} windows are almost completely shattered. Signs are posted all over the hotel front advertising the tour. Guests then enter the lobby, an elaborate and well-decorated room filled with plush furniture and beautiful art. On each ceiling arch is painted a mural of Hightower on one of his adventures, showing him escaping native people with a valuable artifact or item in his possession. At the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lobby</b> is the elevator in its destroyed state, its doors left open with only a single plank of wood holding them together, a broken cable visible inside. Guests are then ushered into a room filled with many pictures of Hightower, his expeditions, and his hotel.|$|E

25|$|Valley Craftsmen, of Baltimore, Maryland, {{restored}} the elaborate Art Deco lobby. They re-stenciled the beamed ceiling in a geometric Art Deco design using gold leaf, and hand-painted {{the walls to}} resemble the original veneer panels. The Saul Company replaced the missing Art Deco chandeliers and wall sconces and {{restored the}} handsome inlaid Art Deco elevator doors on the second, third, and fourth floors. On each side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lobby</b> is a lounge. The south lounge was restored to its original design and the north lounge was converted to a piano-bar, which is open to residents. On the second floor, there is ballroom with fine Art Deco detailing. The ballroom was a popular venue for events of all kinds, {{and many of the}} best known big bands of the era played there. It has been closed for many years, but current plans (2011) call for it to be restored and reopened as an event space.|$|E
25|$|Surrealist Street filled {{one side}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lobby</b> with mannequins dressed by various surrealists. The main hall was a {{simulation}} {{of a dark}} subterranean cave with 1,200 empty coal bags suspended from the ceiling. The floor was covered by Paalen with dead leaves and mud from the Montparnasse Cemetery. In {{the middle of the}} grand hall underneath Duchamp´s coal sacks, Paalen installed an artificial water-filled pond with real water lilies and reeds, which he called Avant La Mare. Illumination was provided only by a single light bulb, so patrons were given flashlights with which to view the art (an idea of Man Ray), while the aroma of roasting coffee filled the air. Around midnight, the visitors witnessed the dancing shimmer of a scantily dressed girl who suddenly arose from the reeds, jumped on a bed, shrieked hysterically, then disappeared just as quickly. Much to the surrealists' satisfaction, the exhibition scandalized many of the guests.|$|E
