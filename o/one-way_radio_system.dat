50|$|Without {{vehicular}} radios, patrolmen {{were issued}} 2 rolls of dimes each week {{so they could}} phone in for calls on a regular basis. Though the legislature authorized the patrol to establish a <b>one-way</b> statewide <b>radio</b> <b>system</b> in 1937, it had many areas of no reception (dead spots), especially in the far eastern coastal areas and more so in the rugged western mountains. The system was flawed in that patrolmen could not answer back. Poor reception made it hard for patrolmen to tell which patrolman was being called, even when {{they could hear the}} radio. If dispatchers could not locate a patrolman, they would call certain selected stores, gas stations and post offices in the particular patrolman's district and ask the employees or personnel to watch for and to flag the patrolman down the next time he was seen passing by and to tell him to call in. If patrolmen arrested a violator, they would have minor offenders follow them to the justice of the peace office or courthouse. If they physically arrested a violator, the patrolmen would hide their motorcycle in brush and drive an offender to the local jail in his own vehicle.|$|R

40|$|Spectral {{properties}} {{and performance of}} multi-pulse impulse <b>radio</b> ultra-wideband <b>systems</b> with pulse-based polarity randomization are analyzed. Instead of a single type of pulse transmitted in each frame, multiple types of pulses are considered, which is shown to reduce the effects of multiple-access interference. First, the spectral properties of a multi-pulse impulse <b>radio</b> <b>system</b> is investigated. It is shown that the power spectral density is the average of spectral contents of different pulse shapes. Then, approximate closed-form expressions for bit error probability of a multi-pulse impulse <b>radio</b> <b>system</b> are derived for RAKE receivers in asynchronous multiuser environments. The theoretical and simulation results indicate that impulse <b>radio</b> <b>systems</b> that are more robust against multiple-access interference than a "classical" impulse <b>radio</b> <b>system</b> can be designed with multiple types of ultra-wideband pulses.
