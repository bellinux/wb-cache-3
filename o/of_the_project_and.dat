5|$|Early {{research}} into the element was somewhat limited {{because most of the}} nuclear physicists and chemists in the United States at the time were focused on the massive effort to research the properties of plutonium as part of the Manhattan Project.

5|$|In August 1990, WMATA {{hired the}} Perini Corp. {{as the new}} contractor, and {{required}} the company {{to finish the job}} and rebuild the streets in the area, setting a new Green Line dedication of December 1991.

5|$|Other {{scientists}} {{criticized the}} project as being potentially unsafe for the local wildlife and the Inupiat people living near the designated area, who were not officially told of the plan until March 1960.

5|$|Tiny Town, in Springfield, Missouri, was {{the first}} city built in {{miniature}} and had over a thousand structures. A smaller village version was completed in 1919, while the larger full version was completed in 1925. It was motivated primarily by a local homebuilding promotion. The project involved 10,000 students from eighteen Springfield public high schools.

5|$|As {{investigation}} and planning work continued, the Corps of Engineers {{reached an agreement}} with the Department of the Interior, the parent agency of the Bureau of Reclamation, in March 1962. The agreement stated the Corps would have responsibility for design and construction of the project, while the Interior Department would be responsible for running and maintaining the dam after completion. In the planning stages, the Interior Department also would be responsible for examining the economic feasibility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> <b>and</b> its effect upon natural resources. This agreement negated much of the work of the REAB to that point, as the Interior Department promptly began its own three-year study of the dam's economic feasibility and environmental impact. The DRC report, though trumped by the Interior Department's new precedence in such matters, nevertheless released a report in April 1962, stating that the project was economically feasible and would attract new industries to Alaska. Meanwhile, the Corps of Engineers continued engineering studies.|$|E
5|$|As of 2012, {{progress}} on the project has been stalled by disagreements between the Wolkoffs {{and the town of}} Islip over the amount the Wolkoffs will spend for the transportation piece <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>project,</b> <b>and</b> between the family and labor unions over wages and health care. The town of Islip has stated that the Wolkoffs agreed to spend $75million (2011USD) for the infrastructure improvements; however, the family stated in a September 2011 letter that they would only commit to $27million (2011USD) and that they never agreed to the original figure. Gerald Wolkoff thought that the discrepancy stemmed from his belief that transportation should be funded by the government, not from private sources, as his project would generate tax revenue for the government. Despite the issues surrounding the project, the Heartland project received $2.5million from the State of New York for roadway improvements in December 2011. The funding was part of a $101million (2011USD) package given to Long Island for various economic improvements.|$|E
5|$|By March 2004 {{the cost}} {{had reached the}} sum of £430m (compared to an {{original}} budget of £55m in July 1998 when the architects were appointed). This equates to £85 {{for each of the}} 5.1 million people in Scotland. A report published by the Auditor General for Scotland in July 2004 specifically identified elements that contributed to both increasing costs and the delay in completing the project. His report criticised the overall management <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> <b>and</b> stated that had the management and construction process been executed better, costs could have been reduced. The report attempted to identify the reasons why there had been an acceleration in cost from £195m in September 2000 to £431m in February 2004 and concluded that over 2000 design changes to the project were a major factor. The building was finally certified for occupation in the Summer of 2004, with the official opening in October of the same year, three years behind schedule.|$|E

5|$|Construction {{was put on}} hold in August 2015, {{when the}} assets of project {{developer}} Lobsang Dargey were frozen by a court order after a civil fraud suit by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC alleges that Dargey diverted funds from the project for his own personal uses, including the purchase of his Bellevue home and gambling. The project was then transferred to a court-appointed receiver and later stripped of its EB-5 eligibility. In May 2016, the presiding judge approved a plan by two firms to buy out Dargey's share <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> <b>and</b> restart construction, pending approval from EB-5 investors; in October, the two companies signed an agreement to restart construction and re-brand the project.|$|E
5|$|Following the McIntosh-Prescott Report, which {{indicated}} the long-term faults {{with the class}} that still required solving, successful {{efforts were made to}} bring the submarines to operational standard. As part of this, a public relations plan was implemented to provide up-to-date information on the submarines to the media, to improve the public perception of the class by providing factual information on the status <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> <b>and</b> responding to queries and incidents. This same period saw the dispelling of the idea, widely held within the RAN, that the Collins-class boats would be like any other vessel previously ordered by the RAN: in service with another navy, well tested, and with all the problems solved before they entered Australian hands. The RAN began to realise that as the parent navy for the class, they had a greater responsibility than normal in ensuring that the boats were at an operational standard.|$|E
5|$|In August 2008, Skanska {{was awarded}} the $150-million design–build {{contract}} to build the new bridge. Skanska started driving test pilings into {{the ground in the}} later part of 2008. In May 2009, public voting for the aesthetic design features of the bridge decided that the cables would be blue, the pylon tops would be slanted with railings, and the lighting fixtures for the walkway would have a nautical theme. The test pilings for the bridge were completed in June 2009. Construction of the pylons began in July 2009 with the pouring of concrete into the first pylon. By December 2009, construction had begun on the approach foundations and the edge girders, with work continuing on the pylon towers and the side abutments. The completion of the design phase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> <b>and</b> the beginning of the concrete pour for the bridge deck took place in April 2010. In May 2010, the bridge received $1.79 million in federal funding for the pedestrian and bike paths. By this time, the new Indian River Inlet Bridge was about halfway complete.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to water storage and regulation, {{the system has}} a hydroelectric capacity of over 2,000 megawatts, and provides recreation and flood control with its twenty dams and reservoirs. It has allowed major cities to grow along Valley rivers which previously would flood each spring, and transformed the semi-arid desert environment of the San Joaquin Valley into productive farmland. Freshwater stored in Sacramento River reservoirs and released downriver during dry periods prevents salt water from intruding into the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta during high tide. There are eight divisions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> <b>and</b> ten corresponding units, many of which operate in conjunction, while others are independent {{of the rest of}} the network.

5|$|In early October 2006, Baird's {{department}} reviewed a promised $200 {{million grant}} to the City of Ottawa's light-rail expansion {{project for the}} O-Train. Baird indicated {{that the government would}} keep the funding at least until the November election, but added that the Council elected in November would have the final say on the issue. He also leaked details of the city's contact with the German firm Siemens. As a result, the rail program became a focal issue in the 2006 Ottawa mayoral election and Baird's opponents accused him of trying to influence the outcome. Baird and Ottawa Mayor Bob Chiarelli accused one another of lying about details <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>project,</b> <b>and</b> Liberal MP Navdeep Bains asked the Federal Ethics Commissioner to investigate Baird's decision to release details of the private contract.
