5|$|Harvey Bernard Milk (May 22, 1930 – November 27, 1978) was an American {{politician}} {{and the first}} openly gay elected official {{in the history of}} California, where {{he was elected to the}} San Francisco Board of Supervisors. Although he was the most pro-LGBT politician in the United States at the time, politics and activism were not his early interests; he was neither <b>open</b> <b>about</b> his sexuality nor civically active until he was 40, after his experiences in the counterculture movement of the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Keynes's early {{romantic and}} sexual {{relationships}} were exclusively with men. Keynes {{had been in}} relationships while at Eton and Cambridge; significant among these early partners were Dilly Knox and Daniel Macmillan. Keynes was <b>open</b> <b>about</b> his affairs, and from 1901 to 1915 kept separate diaries in which he tabulated his many sexual encounters. Keynes's relationship and later close friendship with Macmillan was to be fortunate, as Macmillan's company first published his tract Economic Consequences of the Peace.|$|E

5|$|Manning {{became the}} target of {{bullying}} at the school {{because she was the}} only American and was viewed as effeminate. Manning had come out to two friends in Oklahoma as gay, but was not <b>open</b> <b>about</b> it at school in Wales. The students would imitate her accent, and apparently abandoned her once during a camping trip; her aunt told The Washington Post that Manning awoke to an empty camp site one morning, after everyone else had packed up their tents and left without her.|$|E
5|$|The covert war in Laos {{continues}} to fascinate those with {{any knowledge of}} it. It {{was one of the}} quintessential Cold War insurgency/counterinsurgency, low-intensity conflicts and offers many lessons in the conduct of irregular covert operations supported by modern military technology. It also remains one of only a few military operations of the Vietnam War about which both major belligerent parties (the U.S. and North Vietnam) are still reluctant to discuss openly their participation. For the North Vietnamese, this is understandable. Hanoi has no more incentive to discuss its operations today than it had in the 1960s or 1970s. Although the U.S. has been more <b>open</b> <b>about</b> its participation, the covert war remains a touchy subject.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} {{movements}} {{among the general}} self-harm community to make self-harm itself and treatment better known to mental health professionals, {{as well as the}} general public.

On this day, some people choose to be more <b>open</b> <b>about</b> their own self-harm, and awareness organizations make special efforts to raise awareness about self-harm. Some people wear an orange awareness ribbon or wristband to encourage awareness of self-harm.|$|E

Walker played just one season, 42 games total, for Toledo before injuries entailed his release.|$|E
5|$|Divine {{considered}} {{himself to be}} male, and was not transgender or transsexual. He was gay, and during the 1980s had an extended relationship with a married man named Lee, who accompanied him almost everywhere that he went. They later separated, and Divine went on to have a brief affair with gay porn star Leo Ford, which was widely reported upon by the gay press. According to his manager Bernard Jay, Divine regularly engaged in sexual activities with young men that he would meet while on tour, sometimes becoming infatuated with them; in one case, he met {{a young man in}} Israel whom he wanted to bring back to the United States, but was prevented from doing so by Jay. This image of promiscuity was disputed by his friend Anne Cersosimo, who claimed that Divine never exhibited such behavior when on tour. Divine initially avoided informing the media about his sexuality, even when questioned by interviewers, and would sometimes hint that he was bisexual, but {{in the latter part of}} the 1980s changed this attitude and began being <b>open</b> <b>about</b> his homosexuality. Nonetheless, he avoided discussing gay rights, partially at the advice of his manager, realizing that it would have had a negative effect on his career.|$|E
