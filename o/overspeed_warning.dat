2500|$|The Boeing 727-251, {{registration}} N274US, departed New York City's John F. Kennedy International Airport at 19:14 for a {{ferry flight}} to Buffalo. As the craft climbed past , the <b>overspeed</b> <b>warning</b> horn sounded, followed 10 seconds later by a stick shaker stall warning. The aircraft leveled at [...] until {{it started to}} descend {{out of control in}} a spin, reaching a vertical acceleration of +5g until it struck the ground in a slightly nose down and right wing-down attitude twelve minutes after take-off, at 19:26.|$|E
50|$|Blockage, damage, or inoperation of {{stall and}} {{angle of attack}} (AOA) probes can lead to {{unreliability}} of the stall warning, and cause the stick pusher, <b>overspeed</b> <b>warning,</b> autopilot, and yaw damper to malfunction.|$|E
50|$|Spencer asked Wagstaff to {{increase}} the propeller speed to 1,050 RPM to slow the aircraft when this occurred. He raised {{the nose of the}} aircraft in response to the warning and this reduced the rate of descent to about 2,000 ft per minute, however, the VMO <b>overspeed</b> <b>warning</b> continued.|$|E
2500|$|The {{accident}} {{started at}} 12:40:26 WST {{when one of}} the aircraft’s three air data inertial reference units (ADIRU) started providing incorrect data to the flight computer. In response to the anomalous data, the autopilot disengaged automatically, and a few seconds later, the pilots received electronic messages on the aircraft ECAM, warning them of an irregularity with the autopilot and inertial reference systems, and aural stall and <b>overspeed</b> <b>warnings.</b> During this time, the pilot took control of the aircraft, increasing the altitude to 37,180 ft. The autopilot was then re-engaged and the aircraft started to return to the prior selected flight level. The autopilot was disengaged by the crew after about 15 seconds and would remain disengaged {{for the remainder of the}} flight.|$|R
5000|$|The {{aircraft}} {{almost immediately}} attained a 20-degree pitch down and began picking up speed, while Captain Berköz and First Officer Ulusman struggled to regain control. At some point, {{one of the}} crew members pressed their microphone button broadcasting the pandemonium in the cockpit on the departure frequency. Controllers also picked up a distorted transmission from the plane and the aircraft's pressurisation and <b>overspeed</b> <b>warnings</b> were heard over the pilots' words in Turkish, including the co-pilot saying [...] "the fuselage has burst!" [...] As the plane's speed increased, the additional lift raised the nose again. Berköz is recorded calling out, [...] "Speed!" [...] and pushed the throttles forward in order to level off. At 12:41:13 pm, 9 minutes after takeoff and 77 seconds after the initial door hatch gave way, the plane slammed into the trees of Ermenonville Forest, a state-owned forest at Bosquet de Dammartin in the commune of Fontaine-Chaalis, Oise. At the point of impact, the aircraft was travelling at a speed of approximately 430 kn at a slight left turn, fast enough to disintegrate the plane into thousands of pieces. The wreckage was so fragmented {{that it was difficult}} to determine whether any parts of the aircraft were missing before it crashed. Post-crash fires were small because there were few large pieces of the aircraft left intact to burn. Of the 346 passengers and crew on board, only 40 bodies were visually identifiable, with rescue teams recovering some 20,000 body fragments in all. Nine passengers were never identified.|$|R
50|$|The Boeing 727-251, {{registration}} N274US, departed New York City's John F. Kennedy International Airport at 19:14 for a {{ferry flight}} to Buffalo. As the craft climbed past 16000 ft, the <b>overspeed</b> <b>warning</b> horn sounded, followed 10 seconds later by a stick shaker stall warning. The aircraft leveled at 24800 ft until {{it started to}} descend {{out of control in}} a spin, reaching a vertical acceleration of +5g until it struck the ground in a slightly nose down and right wing-down attitude twelve minutes after take-off, at 19:26.|$|E
5000|$|On this route, {{the descent}} to Madang was steep (because {{of the need}} to remain above the Finisterre Ranges until close to Madang) and, {{although}} the aircraft was descending steeply, the propellers were at their cruise setting of 900 revolutions per minute (RPM). Neither pilot noticed the airspeed increasing towards the maximum operating speed (VMO); as they were [...] "distracted by the weather". When the aircraft reached VMO as it passed through 10,500 ft, with a rate of descent between 3,500 and 4,200 ft per minute, and the propellers set at 900 RPM, the VMO <b>overspeed</b> <b>warning</b> sounded.|$|E
5000|$|On 19 March, {{in their}} interim report, SHK revealed:After 17 seconds {{from the start}} of the event, the maximum speed (VMO) of 315 knots was exceeded. The <b>overspeed</b> <b>warning</b> was {{activated}} and the vertical acceleration turned to positive values.Another 16 seconds later, the first officer transmitted a [...] "MAYDAY" [...] message that was confirmed by air traffic control. The indicated airspeed then exceeded 400 knots and the stabilizer trim was reactivated and reduced to 0.3 degrees nose down. The Pilot in Command called [...] "Mach trim" [...] after which engine power was reduced to idle.During the further event the last valid FDR value shows that the speed continued to increase up to 508 knots while the vertical acceleration values were positive, with maximum values of approximately +3G.FDR data shows that the aircraft's ailerons and spoilerons mainly were deflected to the left during the event.|$|E
50|$|The {{flight was}} en route from Indianapolis International Airport, Indiana, to O'Hare International Airport, Chicago, Illinois. Bad weather in Chicago caused delays, {{prompting}} air traffic control to hold Flight 4184 over the nearby LUCIT intersection at 10000 ft. While holding, the plane encountered freezing rain, a dangerous icing condition where supercooled droplets rapidly cause intense ice buildup. Soon after, they were cleared to descend to 8000 ft. After this descent the pilots were ordered to enter another hold. During the descent, a warning sound indicating an <b>overspeed</b> <b>warning</b> due to the extended flaps was heard in the cockpit. After the pilot took action by retracting the flaps, a strange noise was heard on the cockpit voice recorder, followed by a sharp, uncommanded roll excursion that disengaged the autopilot. Flight recorder data showed that the aircraft subsequently went through at least one full roll, after which Aguiar and Gagliano regained control of the rapidly descending aircraft. However, another roll occurred shortly as they engaged the autopilot again. This second occurrence was unrecoverable, and fewer than thirty seconds later, at 3:59 p.m., contact with Flight 4184 was lost as the plane crashed nose-down into a soybean field near Roselawn, Indiana, killing all 64 passengers and 4 crew on board.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} a novel laser-based wide-area heads-up windshield display which {{is capable of}} actively interfacing with a human {{as part of a}} driver assistance system. The dynamic active display (DAD) is a unique prototype interface that presents safety-critical visual icons to the driver in a manner that minimizes the deviation of his or her gaze direction without adding to unnecessary visual clutter. As part of an automotive safety system, the DAD presents alerts in the field of view of the driver only if necessary, which is based upon the state and pose of the driver, vehicle, and environment. This paper examines the effectiveness of DAD through a comprehensive comparative experimental evaluation of a speed compliance driver assistance system, which is implemented on a vehicular test bed. Three different types of display protocols for assisting a driver to comply with speed limits are tested on actual roadways, and these are compared with a conventional dashboard display. Given the inclination, drivers who are given an <b>overspeed</b> <b>warning</b> alert reduced the time required to slow down to the speed limit by 38 % (p < 0. 01) as compared with the drivers not given the alert. Additionally, certain alerts decreased distraction levels by reducing the time spent looking away from the road by 63 % (p < 0. 01). Ultimately, these alerts demonstrate the utility and promise of the DAD system...|$|E
