We present here an acoustic method {{for the evaluation of}} benthic habitats in Arctic periglacial environment. The great intensity and rapid changes of morphodynamic processes in the biotic environment of Arctic fjords make them prime areas to research climate change impacts on ecosystems. This paper presents comparative results of study on the spatial distribution and biomass of macrophytobentos in two Svalbard fjords, Hornsund and Kongsfjord. Acoustical data in Hornsund fjord was collected by systematic surveys with co-registered single-beam echosounder and side-scan sonar data. For classification of acoustical imageries of bottom covered by algae, we developed algorithms using multidimensional wavelet decomposition of echo signals and fuzzy-logic clustering. Classification results are supported by video recordings and <b>biological</b> <b>samplings</b> by divers. Another, slightly different data collection approach was used in Kongsfjorden, with simultaneous single-beam and multibeam echosounder recordings, verified by <b>biological</b> <b>samplings</b> and observations. Both methods provide maps of phytobenthos distribution and biomass estimation in the fjords investigated. Comparison of single-beam and multibeam echosounder results proved a great opportunity for understanding the visualisation of macrophytes by multibeam systems and potential improvements to associated macrophytobentos recognition techniques...|$|R
40|$|The Branchiopoda, Maxillopoda and Ostracoda fauna of 59 high {{mountain}} lakes of Kackar mountains was investigated {{for the first}} time. During the study, six expeditions were {{carried out in the}} Summers of 2005 - 2007. All lakes are located at altitudes between 2530 and 3370 m except Uzungol (1100 m). Beside the <b>biological</b> <b>samplings,</b> major environmental variables of the lakes were measured. A total of 21 Branchiopoda, 9 Maxillopoda and 3 Ostracod taxa were identified. All the taxa identified are new records for their localities except C. ponticus. The investigated ecosystems support a high micro-crustacean diversity that must be adequately preserved due to the increasing direct and indirect impacts on {{high mountain}} lakes...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} fishing {{was carried out}} with a commercial Spanish vessel from October to December of the year 2003 in the Subarea 1. The main objective of the {{experimental fishing}} was to search for cephalopods species concentrations inside the territorial waters of Greenland. During the experimental fishing a scientific observer stayed on board to collect effort data, catches and yields by haul and Division, strata and gear. The observer carried out length distributions samplings of the following species: Pandalus borealis, Sebastes spp., Hippoglossoides platessoides, Gadus morhua and Macrourus berglax. <b>Biological</b> <b>samplings</b> of Reinhardtius hippoglossoides, Hippoglossoides platessoides, Gadus morhua and Gadus ogac were also carried out. Greenland halibut was the main species caught and the cephalopods, target species, have not {{been found in the}} experimental fishing...|$|R
40|$|Under {{the name}} of Campañas Oceanográficas Mar del Plata I-V, five oceanographic surveys were done {{together}} with the Servicio de Hidrografía Naval, in the area between Faro Querandí and Mar del Sur. (Argentina, Province of Buenos Aires). A total of 82 oceanographic stations were covered and physical-chemical (temperature, oxygen, salinity determinations), sedimental and <b>biological</b> <b>samplings</b> (plankton and bottom organisms) were obtained. Bottom organisms collections were made with a conventional type of dredge 1 meter wide and 46 cm high grame with a net of thin mesh 2, 60 m. Macrofauna components were only considered. This data allowed us to attempt a bionomic and litological chart of the studied area. As the sediments seem to have great heterogeneity over the hole studied area, {{in many cases the}} bottom fauna collections belonged to defferent associations which made difficult the limitations of areas covered by each one. Anyway we can draw that we are very near the minimun limits...|$|R

40|$|A {{total of}} 3532 Trachurus picturatus caught by artisanal purse-seiners off the Canary I slands were {{analyzed}} between March 2005 and March 2006 (10. 4 - 31. 9 cm total length). <b>Biological</b> <b>samplings</b> were performed and sagitta otoliths were extracted and examined. Growth parameters {{were obtained by}} direct reading {{of a total of}} 1562 whole otoliths (L∞= 34. 9 cm, k= 0. 214 years - 1, t 0 =- 2. 545 years). No differences were found between sexes (T 2 Hotelling= 0. 594; p> 0. 05). Precision (CV= 7. 5 %) and age validation were assessed. Age validation wa s addressed by means of a qualitative and a quantitative analysis. Marginal increment analysis was carried out for a selection of 453 otoliths. Assigning state of the marginal increment (qualitat ive analysis) was possible for otoliths of age groups 0, I and II. The monthly evolution of the ma rginal hyaline increment width was based on the age group 0 (quantitative analisys).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results of}} {{a study on the}} spatial distribution and biomass of macrophytobentos in a fjord of Arctic Svalbard. Kongsfjord represents a periglacial environment with intense morphodynamic processes and rapidly progressing changes in the biotic environment, {{making it one of the}} most promising areas to research climate impact on ecosystems. The main objective was to provide an acoustic tool for the evaluation of benthic habitats. The 2007 field survey included systematic, co-registered, single-beam and multibeam echosounder measurements. Acoustic observations were verified by <b>biological</b> <b>samplings</b> and observations for the classification algorithm development and verification. Analyses of acoustic signals scattered on bottoms covered by algae providing a map of phytobenthos distribution and biomass estimation in Kongsfjord. The algorithms designed and tested for processing single- and multibeam data allow extracting the morphological forms of the bottom and determine the areas covered by algae. This survey was the first instance where a multibeam imager was used to map macrophytes in an Arctic environment, in a wide variety of depths and ranges...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Exposure to {{particulate}} matter (PM) {{is associated with}} respiratory and cardiovascular disease and lung cancer. The finest fractions of PM (PM 2. 5 µm and less) play the major role in causing chronic diseases. The structure and composition of PM influence the biological properties of particles. The aim of the MAPEC study is to evaluate the association between air pollution and early biomarkers in oral mucosa of children recruited from first grade schools of 5 Italian towns characterized by different PM levels. Methods To evaluate children exposure, PM 0. 5 samples (n= 20) were collected (72 h) in the school area on the same days of <b>biological</b> <b>samplings</b> (winter 2014 - 2015) using a high-volume air sampler. PM 0. 5 organic extracts were chemically analyzed (PAH, Nitro-PAH) and tested on A 549 by the comet assay and micronucleus test and on Salmonella strains (TA 100, TA 98, TA 98 NR and YG 1021) by Ames test. Results Results showed that PM 0. 5 represents a high variable PM 10 percentage (range 19. 6 - 63...|$|R
