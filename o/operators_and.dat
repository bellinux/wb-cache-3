5|$|Beginning in March 2013, the HTC One {{was made}} {{available}} to mobile <b>operators</b> <b>and</b> major retailers in at least 181 countries. Manufacturing delays led to a staggered release beginning in late March, with its release date in certain markets (such as Asia and North America) pushed to late-April.

The reactor went critical on November 4, 1943, and produced its first plutonium in early 1944.

The reactor and chemical separation plant provided invaluable experience for engineers, technicians, reactor <b>operators,</b> <b>and</b> safety officials who {{then moved on to}} the Hanford site. It operated as a plutonium production plant until January 1945, when it was turned over to research activities, and the production of radioactive isotopes for scientific, medical, industrial and agricultural uses.

5|$|Grid parity, {{the point}} at which the cost of {{photovoltaic}} electricity is equal to or cheaper than the price of grid power, is more easily achieved in areas with abundant sun and high costs for electricity such as in California and Japan. In 2008, The levelized cost of electricity for solar PV was $0.25/kWh or less in most of the OECD countries. By late 2011, the fully loaded cost was predicted to fall below $0.15/kWh for most of the OECD and to reach $0.10/kWh in sunnier regions. These cost levels are driving three emerging trends: vertical integration of the supply chain, origination of power purchase agreements (PPAs) by solar power companies, and unexpected risk for traditional power generation companies, grid <b>operators</b> <b>and</b> wind turbine manufacturers.|$|E
