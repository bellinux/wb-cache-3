40|$|Oxygen usage {{has played}} a crucial role in the ongoing EAF process {{improvement}} and has enabled furnace operators to optimize the chemical energy input, reaching unprecedented efficiencies and productivity. This article will present the fundamental principles governing the design of an optimized chemical energy system through scrap <b>oxy-cutting</b> and melting, decarburisation, post-combustion and slag foaming. It will be illustrated with industrial results obtained at the Vallourec Mannesmann Saint-Saulve site, where a PyreJet ™ and ALARC ™ PC system, using the newly designed DRAGON Panel, has been recently commissioned. The need for an optimized chemical energy system Electric Arc Furnaces have been continuously improving over the past 30 years and have now reached unprecedented levels of efficiency and sophistication. In a market where offer and demand are closely coupled and where quality criteria are becoming more stringent, the improvement of the EAF’s operating process is an ongoing necessity. A significant effort is being made by every steelmaker worldwid...|$|E
40|$|Carbonization {{process has}} become an {{important}} stage in developing activated carbon. However, existing burner are not efficient in time production which take 24 hours to 15 days for charcoal production. Therefore, new design of burner/kilns is quite {{needed in order to}} produce larger number of charcoal in short time production, to improve charcoal quality regarding to the smooth surface area and pore volume. This research proposed new design burner which divided into two types which are vertical and horizontal types. Vertical is not completed by auto-rotating system while horizontal type is complete by auto-rotating and fume handling system. It developed using several equipment such as welding, <b>oxy-cutting,</b> drilling grinding and cutting machine. From the result of carbonization process shows that coconut shell charcoal need shorter time of 30 minutes as compared to palm shell charcoal of 2 h to completely carbonized. This result claim that the new design better than existing kiln that need longer time up to 24 h. The result of the palm and coconut shell charcoal believe will produce better properties of activated carbon in large surface area and higher total volume of pores. Therefore, this burner is high recommended for producing palm and coconut shell charcoal as well as other bio-based material...|$|E
