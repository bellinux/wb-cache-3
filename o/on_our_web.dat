40|$|Abstract. Replicating Web {{documents}} reduces user-perceived {{delays and}} wide-area network traffic. Numerous caching and replication protocols {{have been proposed}} to manage such replication, while keeping the document copies consistent. We claim however that Web documents have very diverse characteristics, and that no single caching or replication policy can efficiently manage all documents. Instead, we propose that each document is replicated with its most-suited policy. We collected traces <b>on</b> <b>our</b> university’s <b>Web</b> server and conducted simulations to determine the performance such configurations would produce, as opposed to configurations using the same policy for all documents. The results show a significant performance improvement with respect to end-user delays, wide-area network traffic and document consistency...|$|R

40|$|Literature {{awareness}} {{is an essential}} requirement for successful research. Breast Cancer Research has launched a new Viewpoints section, which replaces the Paper Reports section {{as a means of}} highlighting important research articles relevant to the biology of breast cancer and bringing them {{to the attention of the}} breast cancer community. 160 As publications on breast cancer (ranging from basic science through to results of clinical trials) continue apace, it is essential that those involved in the field are made aware of key developments. To facilitate this, Breast Cancer Research launched a Paper Report service in May 1999. The original format highlighted recent publications specifically relevant to breast cancer in the form of a short report. Each report, which was published <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>web</b> site, included a brief description of the research and comments from the reporter. The reports were based on articles selected by the reporter from a broad range of journals covering all areas of science relevant to research in breast cancer. Since the service began, we have published 188 Paper Reports <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>web</b> sit...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Replication and caching {{strategies}} {{are being used}} to reduce user perceived de-lay and wide area network traffic. Numerous such strategies have been pro-posed to manage replication while maintaining consistency among the replicas. In earlier research, we demonstrated that no single strategy can perform op-timal for all documents, and proposed a system where {{strategies are}} selected on a per-document basis using trace-driven simulation techniques. In this pa-per, we demonstrate the need for continuous dynamic adaptation of strategies using experiments conducted <b>on</b> <b>our</b> department <b>Web</b> traces. We also propose two heuristics, Simple and Transition, to perform this dynamic adaptation with reduced simulation cost. In our experiments, we find that Transition heuristic re-duces simulation cost by an order of magnitude while maintaining high accuracy in optimal strategy selection. 1...|$|R
