25|$|The Women's Movement and Civil Rights Movement {{during the}} 1950s and 1960s in the United States profoundly shaped the future <b>of</b> <b>Emory</b> University. Formerly an all-male school, Emory officially became a coeducational {{institution}} in 1953. Although it had previously admitted women under limited circumstances, the university {{had never before}} had a policy through which they could enroll in large numbers and as resident students. In 1959, sororities first appeared on campus. In 1962, {{in the midst of}} the Civil Rights Movement, Emory embraced the initiative to end racial restrictions when it asked the courts to declare portions of the Georgia statutes unconstitutional. Previously, Georgia law denied tax-exempt status to private universities with racially integrated student bodies. The Supreme Court of Georgia ruled in Emory's favor and Emory officially became racially integrated. Marvin S. Arrington, Sr. was Emory University's first, full-time African American student and graduated from Emory University School of Law in 1967.|$|E
500|$|Several movie academics, {{including}} Barbara Creed, have {{remarked on}} the color and lighting symbolism in the Alien franchise, which offsets white, strongly lit environments (spaceships, corporate offices) against darker, dirtier, [...] "corrupted" [...] settings (derelict alien ship, abandoned industrial facilities). These black touches contrast or even attempt {{to take over the}} purity of the white elements. Others, such as Kile M. Ortigo <b>of</b> <b>Emory</b> University, agree with this interpretation and point to the Sulaco with its [...] "sterilized, white interior" [...] as representing this element in the second film of the franchise.|$|E
