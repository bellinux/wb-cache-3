40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is to {{understand}} the retention issue, which is very critical to the human resource management in the organization. Companies which retain <b>valuable</b> <b>employees</b> actually retain the asset of intelligence. Organizations have to bear massive costs associated with turnover, which may conduct directly or indirectly to the management reporting or budget system. The volunteer turnover rate {{is one of the}} scales to evaluate the success of company’s retention policies. To understand retention, one needs to understand its relation to many factors which may affect the retention. So in this project, we develop a framework which reflects the relationship between employee turnover rate and firm performance. The framework is built from both employee’s side and company’s side on the basis of literature review and survey conducted to the ETM students. Then we implement the model in the Google case study to see what Google achieves its retention policies. The results in this study could help the technology companies better understand their retention issue, and the technology companies could use the results for possible strategic decisions. In addition, the human resource department could use the results to modify the current retention policies for retaining <b>valuable</b> <b>employees.</b> The study provides a basis for further research...|$|R

Employees constantly tried to start deals, often disregarding the quality of cash flow or profits, {{in order to get}} a better rating for their performance review. Additionally, accounting results were recorded as soon as possible to keep up with the company's stock price. This practice helped ensure deal-makers and executives received large cash bonuses and stock options.|$|R

30|$|This study {{examines}} the antecedents {{and consequences of}} both timing and content of idiosyncratic deals (i-deals) for attracting and retaining <b>valuable</b> <b>employees.</b> A resource exchange frame theorizes the influence pattern of personal individualism value, social skill, and perceived insider status on i-deals timing. Individualism and social skill are expected to relate to both ex ante and ex post i-deals; perceived insider status is anticipated to relate only to ex post i-deals. The frame also suggests that i-deals’ content and personal development relate primarily to relational and balanced psychological contracts; the other ex post i-deals, flexibility and workload reduction relate to transactional psychological contracts. The frame was tested with data collected from 289 Chinese employees in the telecommunication industry.|$|R

40|$|Jill Roberts, Materials Manager for Worth District Hospital, a small {{hospital}} in the San Joaquin Valley in California, finally {{had to face the}} problem with Pete Smith, a chronically tardy subordinate whose lateness had gained the attention of the new chief executive. The situation had evolved both {{as a result of the}} hospital’s organizational culture and Roberts’ decision to tolerate Smith’s behavior, which she felt had little impact on departmental efficiency. Indeed, she regarded Smith as a <b>valuable</b> <b>employee.</b> The Worth Hospital Board had recently hired a new chief executive, John Briggs, who was charged with the task of correcting the hospital’s continuing financial slide due to lower revenues amidst rising costs. As a part of his review of hospital operations, Briggs insisted on reviewing departmental performance evaluations as a part of his assessment of the staff. When Briggs reviewed Roberts’ ratings of Smith, Briggs disagreed with her assessment that Smith’s tardiness was a minor issue. He then directed her to take disciplinary action against Smith, which could ultimately lead to his termination if his behavior did not change. Although Roberts tried various tactics to change Smith’s behavior, her efforts proved less than successful. At the end of the case, Roberts was perplexed by the unpleasant decision she must face. She sincerely believed that Smith generally performed his job well, had become quite a <b>valuable</b> <b>employee</b> to her department, and would be difficult to replace in the short term. But Roberts also recalled her conversation with her boss, John Briggs, and her subsequent understanding about what she should do if Smith did not correct the tardiness problem...|$|R
