The organizations are therefore encouraged to introduce and maintain an effective management system that will ensure achieving of desired objectives. In the area of continuing airworthiness there is a traditional approach to management represented by developing and maintaining organisation exposition, which is organised in accordance with guidelines provided by regulatory authorities. The expositions are therefore focused mostly on describing duties and responsibilities of organization’s departments instead of identifying processes from their inputs to outputs. We can say that the processes are hidden by organization structure creating barriers between individual departments. The issue described above can be addressed by implementing business process management approach which can be supported by number of software applications enabling the organization to clearly identify and organize its processes, workflow, responsibilities and finally its objectives including regulatory requirements to be met. This article introduces a brief methodology for implementing business process management in continuing airworthiness organizations using a commercially available business process modelling tools. By using the methodology the organization can create clear process documentation which can be distributed to all its employees showing their responsibilities in relation to company objectives and processes. With the business process management fully implemented and the approval <b>of</b> <b>competent</b> <b>authority,</b> the process documentation can supplement or even replace the traditional organization’s textual expositions, operations manuals or internal directives...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{disaster}} risk reduction efforts {{have focused on}} disturbances ranging from climate variability, seismic hazards, geo-political instability and public and animal health crises. These factors combined with uncertainty derived from inter-dependencies within and across systems of critical infrastructure create significant problems of governance for {{the private and public}} sector alike. The potential for rapid spread of impacts, geographically and virtually, can render a comprehensive understanding of disaster response and recovery needs and risk mitigation issues beyond the grasp <b>of</b> <b>competent</b> <b>authority.</b> Because of such cascading effects communities and governments at local and state-levels are unlikely to face single incidents but rather series of systemic impacts: often appearing concurrently. A further point to note is that both natural and technological hazards can act directly on socio-technical systems as well as being propagated by them: as network events. Such events have been categorised as ‘outside of the box,’ ‘too fast,’ and ‘too strange’ (Lagadec, 2004). Emergent complexities in linked systems can make disaster effects difficult to anticipate and recovery efforts difficult to plan for. Beyond the uncertainties of real world disasters, that might be called familiar or even regular, can we safely assume that the generic capability we use now will suit future disaster contexts? This paper presents initial scoping of research funded by the Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Centre seeking to define future capability needs of disaster management organisations. It explores challenges to anticipating the needs of representative agencies and groups active in before, during and after phases of emergency and disaster situations using capability deficit assessments and scenario assessment...|$|E

40|$|Protection of {{environment}} {{and human health}} is major concern for European Union. European Commission has established integrated pollution prevention and control directive and directives concerning large combustion plants (LCP) and waste incineration (WI) plants to prevent emissions from industrial installations. The LCP and WI directives set the lowest requirements such as emission limit values and monitoring requirements that the operators have to comply in EU. European Commission has also published best available technique (BAT) reference documents to help authorities determine the requirements in environmental permits for the installations. This thesis is looking into the authority requirements for continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS) that are set by the competent authorities in Spain, Estonia, France, Poland, Czech and UK. Power plants have to monitor and report air emissions {{with the help of}} CEMS. It consists of measurement equipment, analysers and sample conditioning systems as well as environmental data management solution. Directives and standards set the requirements for the CEMS, but still requirements differ between the target countries. For instance, according to the study only in UK certification (MCERTS) for the analyser is required and only in Spain plant owner is not allowed to perform the compliance reporting of the plants emissions. It is the responsibility <b>of</b> <b>competent</b> <b>authority.</b> Also the charging and trading emissions differ between the target countries. The coming directive on industrial emissions will be possibly accepted in the end of 2010. It will unify and straiten the requirements. Emission limit values will lower and the emission monitoring requirements will be stricter. Due to the directive, the importance of the use of best available technique will be emphasized. BAT reference documents for large combustion plants and monitoring emissions are reviewed in 2010. The subject of this thesis was wide and the special requirements are presented in general level. Further studies can use this thesis as a ground for more detailed research in monitoring and reporting emissions from power plants in EU. More research should be done because monitoring of local environmental legislation of Member States is ongoing process. /Kir 1...|$|E
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Security Studies ProgramDavid GraffThis {{dissertation}} {{engages the}} question of what role the Chinese Righteous War Tradition (CRWT) played in the process of Chinese decision-making regarding the decisions to go to war during the period from 1950 to 1979. It asks whether, in their decision-making, the Chinese leaders identified “just cause” through a frame of reference provided by the CRWT; it asks further under what circumstances the identified “just cause” may have exerted influence upon their decision for war. This dissertation presents the first empirical study exploring the application and influence of the traditional Chinese concept of righteous war to China’s modern history. The CRWT is my label for a set of ideas found in the ancient Chinese classics. These ideas suggest that two major standards, righteousness-based justifications and competent authority, were a frame of reference for the Chinese leaders in their assessment of the legitimacy of a decision for war. The justifications of stopping violence, punishing a disobedient state, helping a weaker state against a stronger state’s invasion, and self-defense are regularly defined in the CRWT as righteous causes for going to war. The identification <b>of</b> <b>competent</b> <b>authority</b> is often related to the perception of moral standing, in which a war can be justified by confronting an opponent who is morally inferior to oneself. This dissertation employs the methods of most similar systems and process tracing to explore the role that the CRWT played in successive Chinese leaders’ decision to use force in six cases – the Korean War, the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis, the Sino-Indian War, the Vietnam War between 1964 and 1965, the Sino-Soviet Border Conflict, and the Sino-Vietnamese War. This dissertation also examines the pattern of the Chinese government’s use of wording, presented in the People’s Daily, morally condemning its opponents, which provides supplementary evidence to explore China’s presentation of its own righteous legitimacy. The findings of this research suggest that when the decision for war has been justified within this frame of reference, the Chinese are prone to put that legitimized decision into action. The Chinese concept of righteous war may play a more important role in the decision for war when Chinese leaders encounter an impasse in which two opposite courses of action are suggested by their calculations based on Realpolitik. A sense of the righteous legitimacy of their decision may encourage Chinese leaders to enter a war even when the likely consequence may not appear to favor the Chinese. Furthermore, these findings may well enrich Johnson and Tierney’s theory about the shift of actors’ mind-sets in decision-making because the CRWT may function as a catalyst for the shift. This research also reveals that the CRWT had limited influence when Chinese leaders faced the danger of a possible invasion by a superior opponent or that of nuclear attack. When the need for a decision for war was not open to debate, then, they were not influenced by the consideration of just cause when making their decision...|$|E

40|$|The European Union hosts {{approximately}} 8500 {{industrial sites}} that are considered major hazards due to the potential accident risk associated {{with the presence of}} dangerous substances as defined by the Seveso II Directive. Approximately, half of these sites are classified as so-called lower tier sites because the quantity of the dangerous substances exceeds the lower threshold quantity stipulated in the Directive. Theoretically, the Seveso II Directive imposes a lower regulatory burden on lower tier sites than upper tier sites, whose quantity of dangerous substances exceed the higher threshold quantity given in the Directive. This lower burden is manifested particularly in Article 7, designed to apply exclusively to lower tier sites.
