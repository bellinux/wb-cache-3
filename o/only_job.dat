Justice David Davis, however, had resigned from the Supreme Court in January 1877 after being selected as a United States Senator by the Illinois General Assembly. Seeking a replacement, Hayes settled on Harlan, and formally submitted his name to the Senate on October 16. Though Harlan's nomination prompted some criticism from Republican stalwarts, he was confirmed unanimously on November 29, 1877.|$|E

25|$|In March 1926 a new civil {{governor}} was appointed. His <b>only</b> <b>job</b> was {{to supply the}} Fengtian Army with large amounts of money. He issued new provincial bonds, forcing businesses and local communities to purchase them. Early in 1927 he even entered into the opium trade by selling expensive licenses for the sale and use of opium. Bank reserves and railway revenues were plundered, while ever more paper notes were issued. The best indicator of Manchuria's economic decline was {{the value of the}} Fengtian dollar (yuan), which had started on parity with the Japanese gold yen. In February 1928 a yen was the equivalent of 40 yuan. In this winter, Manchuria's economy collapsed. Workers went on strike, hungry immigrants flooded back into Shenyang because they could not find any work.

In Howland's third (2001–02) and fourth (2002–03) seasons, Pitt won back-to-back Big East regular season championships, appeared in back-to-back Big East tournament championship games and won the Big East tournament in 2003. Pitt advanced to consecutive NCAA tournament Sweet Sixteens (2002, 2003). For his success in the 2001–02 season, Howland was named the Big East Coach of the Year, Naismith College Coach of the Year, and won the Henry Iba Award as best college basketball coach as named by the United States Basketball Writers Association. Following the 2003 season, Howland left Pitt for the <b>only</b> <b>job</b> he said he would ever contemplate leaving Pitt for: the head coach position at UCLA.|$|E

2500|$|The factory {{produced}} {{a series of}} small colour printed leaflets (quite unusual for this time) which could be obtained by post, or picked up from stockists. This promotional device was clearly successful, as one young girl was employed whose <b>only</b> <b>job</b> was to put the leaflets in stamped addressed envelopes sent into the factory. At this time, many women would buy pottery by 'mail order' from advertising in magazines. The series of leaflets, each of which covered a range of pieces in a similar style or set of colours, included ones for Bizarre, Fantasque, Delecia, Appliqué, Inspiration, Crocus & Gayday and others. The original leaflet for the Appliqué patterns featured just two, Lucerne and Lugano, but Cliff's prolific ability to design new patterns is witnessed by the fact that by 1932 the Appliqué range had 14 patterns: with Avignon, Windmill, Red Tree, Idyll, Palermo, Blossom, Caravan, Bird of Paradise, Etna, Garden, Eden and Monsoon in addition to the original two. The Appliqué Lugano pattern is shown left on a [...] wall plaque, with (inset) the printed Bizarre mark, and a hand painted range name as often seen on this ware.

It's the <b>only</b> <b>job</b> I've ever cried about when I thought I didn't have it." [...] Benjamin said that she was overjoyed when she was eventually given the part. In 2010, Matthew Robinson discussed Lisa's introduction with Walford Web, suggesting that Lisa and several other new characters introduced were an attempt to fill in character gaps in the soap resulting from a large number of axings. Lisa was conceptualised as a [...] "totty" [...] contingent. He indicated that the casting of Benjamin had been awkward as BBC controller of drama, Mal Young, was hesitant about her hiring.

Marjory, who was at school with Audrey, is still a schoolgirl at heart and a committed countryside campaigner.

Despite Marjory's encouragement, Audrey refuses to get a job, saying her <b>only</b> <b>job</b> could be running the Grantleigh estate and doing other public service, which includes her being a magistrate.

Ned, a gardener and [...] "outside man", has worked on the estate all his life and finds working indoors difficult to get used to.
