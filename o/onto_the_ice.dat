5|$|One tourism {{activity}} {{unique to the}} Arctic North is iceberg watching. During the summer season of April to July, {{it is possible to}} watch icebergs moving down rivers while the ice around them melts. In addition, watching the floe edge is also a popular activity due to wildlife movement during this time. Whales can often be seen swimming metres from the ice, polar bears can be observed swimming briefly in the icy water and amphibious animals often bring themselves up onto dry land or <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> to sunbathe.|$|E
5|$|Meteorites from Antarctica are an {{important}} area of study of material formed early in the solar system; most are thought to come from asteroids, but some may have originated on larger planets. The first meteorite was found in 1912, and named the Adelie Land meteorite. In 1969, a Japanese expedition discovered nine meteorites. Most of these meteorites have fallen <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> sheet in the last million years. Motion of the ice sheet tends to concentrate the meteorites at blocking locations such as mountain ranges, with wind erosion bringing them to the surface after centuries beneath accumulated snowfall. Compared with meteorites collected in more temperate regions on Earth, the Antarctic meteorites are well-preserved.|$|E

40|$|The {{dependence}} of emperor penguins on diving and foraging {{in the marine}} environment necessitates frequent exits from <b>the</b> ocean <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> sea <b>ice,</b> on which they breed, rear chicks and rest. Because {{of the presence of}} predators at <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> edge, there is considerable pressure for emperor penguins exit the sea safely and efficiently. They should leap to exit <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> sea <b>ice.</b> Their ability to reach above-water height depends critically on the angle and speed of their leaps. In a video study of Adélie penguins exiting the water, Yoda and Ropert-Coudert (2004) concluded that Adélie penguins adjust their take-off angle according to the reflected image of <b>the</b> height of <b>ice</b> above <b>the</b> water. However, it is not known whether penguins also alter their swim speeds proportionately to the required height of the exit. We deliberately changed the above-water heights of two ice holes through which emperor penguins exited. Swim speed, stroke frequency, body angle and depth were monitored using animal-born recorders. Time of exit and hole choice of penguins were simultaneously monitored by observers on <b>the</b> <b>ice.</b> We obtained <b>the</b> first field data to test the hypothesis that penguins adjust swim speed according to the above-water height of holes. We also described their behavior after failed exits <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> sea <b>ice</b> and determined whether they change holes after failed exit...|$|R
5|$|The 1978–79 season capped Montreal's run of four {{consecutive}} championships in dramatic fashion. Facing the Bruins {{in the seventh}} game of the league semi-finals, Montreal trailed 4–3 with {{less than two minutes}} to play when Boston head coach Don Cherry accidentally sent too many players <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> during a line change, drawing what would {{become one of the most}} famous penalties in NHL history, and eventually costing Cherry his job. During the subsequent power play, Lafleur scored the game-tying goal with 74 seconds remaining in regulation time, and Yvon Lambert scored in overtime to win the game and series. The Canadiens proceeded to defeat the Rangers for the Cup in five games.|$|E
5|$|The sport's {{changing}} economics led the Canadiens {{to build}} a new arena in 1996 to increase revenue. The final game at the Forum was held March 11, 1996, a 4–1 victory over the Dallas Stars. Following the game, an elaborate ceremony was held with many of the franchise's greatest members welcomed onto the rink. The most boisterous response was reserved for Maurice Richard, who received a ten-minute standing ovation. Finally, Emile Bouchard, the oldest living former captain, came <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> bearing a lit torch, and it was passed in a symbolic trail through the Canadiens' history: Bouchard passed it to Richard, who passed it to Jean Beliveau, and so on in chronological order to each former captain present, ending with Pierre Turgeon. In 72 years at the Forum, the Canadiens won over 1,500 games and captured 22 Stanley Cups.|$|E
5|$|As {{physical}} {{on the ice}} as Bouchard was, he {{was also}} regarded as a clean player and only rarely participated in hockey fights. Immensely strong, most players avoided engaging him in fights and Bouchard more often would be the person to break up combatants. However, it was a fight involving Bouchard {{which led to a}} significant change in the role of referees. During the 1946–47 season, Bouchard became involved in a prolonged and one-sided fight with Boston's Terry Reardon. Due to the fight, Clarence Campbell, president of the NHL, added to the duties of referees; for the first time they had the responsibility of breaking up fights. Then there was the time in March 1947, in a game in Boston, as the Canadiens were coming back <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> for the beginning of the third period, a female fan attacked Bouchard spearing him with a hat pin. Bouchard responded by pushing the woman away forcefully. A few moments later, Boston police were leading Bouchard out to a police car. According to Bouchard, Pat Egan of the Boston Bruins, interceded and talked the police out of the arrest.|$|E

50|$|According to this hypothesis, AFPs {{disrupt the}} {{thermodynamically}} favourable growth of an ice crystal via kinetic inhibition of contact between solid ice and liquid water. In this manner, the nucleation sites of <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> crystal lattice are {{blocked by the}} AFP, inhibiting {{the rapid growth of}} the crystal that could be fatal for the organism. In physical chemistry terms, <b>the</b> AFPs adsorbed <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> exposed <b>ice</b> crystal force <b>the</b> growth of <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> crystal in a convex fashion as the temperature drops, which elevates <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> vapour pressure at <b>the</b> nucleation sites. <b>Ice</b> vapour pressure continues to increase until it reaches equilibrium with the surrounding solution (water), at which point the growth of <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> crystal stops.|$|R
5|$|Once a droplet has frozen, {{it grows}} in the {{supersaturated}} environment—one where air is saturated with respect to ice when the temperature is below the freezing point. The droplet then grows by diffusion of water molecules in the air (vapor) <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> crystal surface where they are collected. Because water droplets {{are so much more}} numerous than the ice crystals due to their sheer abundance, the crystals are able to grow to hundreds of micrometers or millimeters in size {{at the expense of the}} water droplets by the Wegener–Bergeron–Findeisen process. The corresponding depletion of water vapor causes the ice crystals to grow at the droplets' expense. These large crystals are an efficient source of precipitation, since they fall through the atmosphere due to their mass, and may collide and stick together in clusters, or aggregates. These aggregates are snowflakes, and are usually the type of ice particle that falls to the ground. Although the ice is clear, scattering of light by the crystal facets and hollows/imperfections mean that the crystals often appear white in color due to diffuse reflection of the whole spectrum of light by the small ice particles.|$|E
5|$|After {{retiring}} from professional play, Thompson became {{the head coach}} of the Buffalo Bisons of the American Hockey League (AHL) in the 1940–41 season. He coached 56 games in two seasons. The Bisons missed the playoffs both times. He appeared in one game as goaltender in the 1940–41 season. During World War II, Thompson served in the Royal Canadian Air Force and doubled as the coach of the Calgary RCAF Mustangs of the Alberta Senior Hockey League. He led the Mustangs to the league championship series in 1942–43 against the Calgary Currie Army team where injuries to the Mustangs' goaltenders brought him back <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> in March 1943. With Thompson in goal, the Mustangs defeated Currie Army 8–4 to tie the best-of-five series at two wins apiece. He played the deciding game, but his team fell short of winning the Alberta title with a 3–1 loss to Currie Army. After the war, Thompson became chief Western Canada scout for the Chicago Black Hawks. He {{was one of the few}} scouts at the time who sought to discover a player's personality along with their playing ability. Thompson often conversed with players as part of an effort to learn about the players he was watching.|$|E

Guinness World Records lists the world's largest (aggregate) snowflakes as those of January 1887 at Fort Keogh, Montana; allegedly one measured 15inches (38cm) wide. Although this report by a farmer is doubtful, aggregates of three or four inches width have been observed. Single crystals the size of a dime (17.91mm in diameter) have been observed. Snowflakes encapsulated in rime form balls known as graupel.|$|E
5000|$|Latent heat polynya: {{is formed}} through {{the action of}} {{katabatic}} wind or ocean currents which act to drive ice away from a fixed boundary, such as a coastline, fast ice, or an <b>ice</b> bridge. <b>The</b> polynya forms initially by the first year pack ice being driven away from the coast, which leaves an area of open water within which new ice is formed.

5|$|Strong {{support from}} fans {{continued}} into the playoffs, as the Penguins sold out their first two home games in 11minutes. The team erected a 12 by 16foot LED screen on the lawn directly outside Mellon Arena, allowing fans to watch all playoff games outside of the stadium, free of charge. A rally scheduled by Allegheny County executive Dan Onorato and Mayor Luke Ravenstahl took place {{in front of the}} Allegheny County Courthouse prior to Game 2 of the team's first-round series on April 11. The Penguins' third game of the playoffs attracted the third-highest regional viewing audience all-time for a Penguins game. The 4,200 tickets offered for the team's first two home games of Round Two sold out within 10minutes. As the playoffs advanced into the later rounds, the team had growing support from players and coaches of other teams in Pittsburgh, including the Steelers and Pirates, and many of the players attended games. Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin watched Game 6 of the Finals outside Mellon Arena, along with 3,000 other fans. Prior to the Stanley Cup Final, Mayor Ravenstahl led a rally in the city's Market Square, which featured chanting by the several hundred people in attendance; cooked octopus was also served by 's Fish Market, in reference to the Detroit tradition of throwing octopi <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice.</b> The team also opened up Mellon Arena for fans to watch away games on the JumboTron during the Stanley Cup Final; over 13,500 people attended Game 1. Fans who watched the three games played in Detroit raised over $85,000 for the Mario Lemieux Foundation for cancer research. The Penguins also ranked first in the league in merchandise sales.|$|E

5000|$|The {{formation}} of strudel {{is related to}} the break up of a frozen river during the melting season, where this river runs into a sea ice expanse. At that time, fresh water flows <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> fast <b>ice</b> with a progression rate of about 2-3 m/s, extending up to a few tens of kilometers away from the river mouth. Water depths above <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> surface may be up to a few meters. A strudel forms as a result of water carving its way through <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> sheet. Drainage is initiated through small openings or cracks in <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> resulting from <b>the</b> weight of the freshwater. Some are reportedly enlarged seal-breathing holes. [...] Within a few days, the water drains off <b>the</b> <b>ice.</b> Drainage is driven by the buoyancy of <b>the</b> <b>ice,</b> not by <b>the</b> density difference between freshwater and sea water. The pressure difference responsible for that flow is a function of <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> thickness and <b>the</b> difference in unit weight between <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> and <b>the</b> water.|$|R
