The produced rosin amidoximes were used as capping agents for magnetite nanoparticles to prepare hydrophobic coated magnetic powders. A new class of monodisperse hydrophobic magnetite nanoparticles was prepared by a simple and inexpensive co-precipitation method. Iron ions and iodine were prepared by the reaction between ferric chloride and potassium iodide. The structure and morphology of magnetite capped with rosin amidoxime were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), zeta potential, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and dynamic light scattering (DLS). The magnetic properties were determined from vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) analyses. These prepared magnetite nanoparticles were tested as bioactive nanosystems and their antimicrobial effects were investigated. The prepared nanomaterials were examined as a crude <b>oil</b> <b>collector</b> using magnetic fields.

40|$|The {{transport}} {{of crude oil}} requires the adoption of safety measures in port terminals, especially during the operations of loading and unloading of crude oil. Accidents at sea are further serious cause of oil pouring and cause pollution. For these reasons the port terminals are equipped with oil skimmers and boats that intervene promptly to define and collect the spill at sea. The technology of oil skimmers is subject to continuous innovation, to ensure prompt actions when operating in restricted waters, as may be {{the area of the}} Gulf of Trieste, Northern Adriatic Sea or other restricted areas within the refineries and oil terminals. In the paper the principles by which the oil skimmers recover and transfer oil and some of the more salient changes introduced recently in this technology will be explained. Then we will present a new oil skimmer design, called FL. O. C (Flexible <b>Oil</b> <b>Collector),</b> developed under the Jonathan Project, in collaboration with the University of Trieste and the Area Science Park of Trieste.

40|$|The {{request for}} ships and devices {{able to collect}} oil and polluting spills from the sea has been more and more {{increasing}} in recent years. These systems may remain unused for years and, at the same time, need frequent and very expensive maintenance. Their availability requires transferring them {{to the site of}} the incident, which may be reached many hours or days after the oil spill has occurred. The new idea is to design a light and flexible system that can be docked directly on the ships or in small boats capable of laying down and containing the oil slick. By so doing, the pollution control could be more effective and the environmental damage could be better controlled in very short time. The FLOC (FLexible <b>Oil</b> <b>Collector),</b> protected by the international patent application) has been studied and developed by Jonathan Project, in partnership with Innovation Factory of Area Science Park and the Hydrodynamic Laboratories of the University of Trieste. It consists in a floating funnel-shaped collector with an I/O balanced flow that conveys the free surface of the mixture of water and hydrocarbons for their separation and their collection into pollution tanks. By so doing, the percentage of hydrocarbon recovery is higher in comparison with traditional oil skimmers. The availability of a such system could be used as standard equipment, thus allowing fast and timely rescue. A small layout of the device can be used for cleaning maintenance of stretches of water in ports and docks...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT This thesis {{describes}} {{an investigation into}} the use of eucalyptus oils as both frother and collector in coal flotation. The application of eucalyptus oils as reagents in froth flotation dates {{back to the beginning of}} the process itself. It was realised early on that natural oils are complex mixtures of many different organic constituents. Essential oils of eucalypts are composed predominantly of terpenes, compounds which contain a sequence of two or more isoprene units (C 5 H 8) joined either head-to-head or head-to-tail. Monoterpenes (C 10) and sesquiterpenes (C 15) are the major classes of terpenes found in eucalyptus oils each of which can be divided into a number of sub-classes, varying across and within different species of the eucalypts. Ten eucalyptus oil samples were analysed using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry techniques. The results showed they contain a wide range of closely-related functional groups which might affect flotation. For each oil, surface activity was evaluated in a two-phase system using a froth column and a bubble sizer to estimate the dynamic foam stability index (DFI) and the critical coalescence concentration (CCC). On the basis of these parameters, it was shown that eucalyptol and α-pinene do not have frother properties and that E. Citriodora oil was the most promising frother, producing a better bubble size distribution than the industry standard frother, MIBC. Sequential laboratory flotation experiments were carried out using the tree-test on a Bowen Basin coal sample obtained from Peak Downs Mine. The Whiten equation was fitted to the experimental data to model the flotation response, allowing the frothing properties of the oils to be compared with MIBC. The flotation response curves were analysed using a new statistical methodology with the results showing that E. Citriodora oil has good frothing properties, comparable to MIBC. Timed laboratory batch flotation tests carried out to evaluate collecting effect showed that eucalyptus oils generally give a higher ultimate recovery, but lower rate constants compared to the industry-standard collector, diesel. Eucalyptol and α-pinene were shown to be the most effective eucalyptus <b>oil</b> <b>collectors.</b> The interaction between maceral species and the flotation reagents was evaluated using coal grain analysis (CGA). Flotation models are presented for different flotation products based on the microscopic characterisation of individual coal grains. The maceral and mineral abundance data demonstrate that MIBC floats vitrinite better than E. Citriodora oil, while their inertinite recovery is comparable. Eucalyptus <b>oil</b> <b>collectors,</b> compared to diesel, have better vitrinite recovery and higher inertinite loss to tailings...|$|R

Advancements in this field would enable a population to make economical use of its resources. One widely-used ore processing method to separate target minerals from other minerals is froth flotation. This report summarizes the method and outcome of 48 flotation experiments, performed at the Titania A/S Ilmenite mine, Hauge i Dalane, Norway, in which 6 different tall <b>oil</b> <b>collectors</b> and 2 paraffin solvents were used in a pilot scale batch process.

To obtain insight into the flotation process, contact angles on soot pellets and silica plates were determined in both the absence and presence of several collectors and the results were compared with the flotation recovery of soot (90 – 200 μm) and silica (90 – 200 μm) from suspensions of the pure materials using a modified Hallimond tube. Aerophine, dodecylpyridinium chloride and three different oils were used as collectors. Adding a collector increased the contact angles on soot particles from 89 ° to at least 100 ° and increased the flotation recovery from 56 % to 100 %. However, the contact angle and the flotation recovery of silica are also enhanced under optimal conditions for soot flotation. A semi-continuous dissolved air flotation apparatus was used for the practical flotation experiments.

Grinding is an ideal method for producing parts with a fine surface finish and high dimensional accuracy and for shaping hard or brittle workpieces. There are a wide variety of different types of grinding machines, each with different applications and slightly different energy requirements. Workpieces are generally flooded with a stream of coolant while being ground or placed in a spray of coolant mist. Coolant recycling systems are used to filter ground off chips out of coolant and to remove foreign oils and bacteria which pose health hazards. <b>Oil</b> mist <b>collectors</b> both clean mist coolant and prevent the toxic coolant from being inhaled by machinists. In total, 63 * 10 ¹⁵ joules of energy are consumed per year by grinding in manufacturing, 57 % of which is directly used in material removal. A total of 1. 5 * 10 ¹⁰ pounds of scrap chips, spent grinding wheels, and used filters are produced each year as a result of grinding, over 99 % of that being scrap chips.

40|$|Low optical-concentration {{solar thermal}} CPC {{collectors}} for process heat at 150 - 300. °C generally use thermal <b>oil</b> as the <b>collector</b> fluid. Thermal <b>oils</b> have low thermal conductivity and high viscosity, {{which leads to}} significant thermal resistance and hence reduced collector thermal efficiency. One way to minimize the thermal resistance is by having turbulent flow of the thermal oil within the receiver. For a given receiver area and mass flow rate of the fluid, this {{can be achieved by}} narrowing the flow passage but keeping the receiver area constant by adding external flat fins. In this paper a new receiver design for a compound parabolic concentrator is proposed which is a hybrid of a U-shaped tubular receiver and a bifacially irradiated flat receiver. To keep the receiver area constant, the fins are increased in width as the tube diameter is decreased. Its performance when enclosed in a glass vacuum tube and a CPC has been modelled. The transmission and absorption of solar energy, optical losses due to the receiver-reflector gap, heat transfer within the receiver, and the thermal losses have been modelled. Keeping the receiver area and fluid flow rate constant, the thermal resistance of the thermal oil flow within the receiver reduces when the flow passage is narrowed leading to increased thermal efficiency. On the other hand, the hybrid receiver has lower optical efficiency as compared to a tubular receiver due to its higher gap loss. Overall, the hybrid receiver has similar or better thermal efficiency than the tubular receiver. Thermal efficiency and effective thermal efficiency, which accounts for the pumping power penalty, shows that the performance improvement with thermal oil due to receiver shape optimization depends on the receiver area, concentration ratio, absorptivity and emissivity of the selective surface, the mass flow rate through the receiver and fluid temperature.

40|$|Coal {{flotation}} {{makes use}} of the hydrophobicity of coal surface. To enhance the hydrophobicity of coal particles, oily collectors are usually added. Although collectors have been widely applied in coal processing, the microscopic collection mechanism remains a formidable task due {{to the complexity of}} coal surface structure. In this work, different combined systems formed by collectors, water and a model surface of Wiser bituminous coal have been studied using molecular dynamics calculations. We modeled the interaction of each <b>collector</b> <b>oil</b> droplet with the coal surface in aqueous phase. In addition, water/collector model systems were also considered in order to reproduce the interaction of the different collectors with water molecules in the collector adsorption process. The results indicate that all three collectors, i. e. dodecane, nonylbenzene and nonylphenol, form spherical insoluble oil droplet in aqueous phase. After the addition of collector droplet over coal surface, all these collectors could thermodynamically repel the interfacial water molecules and spread over the coal surface, thereby reducing roughness of coal surface. The adsorption of nonylphenol on coal surface via both pi-pi stacking and hydrogen bonds is most favorable, followed by that of nonylbenzene and dodecane. The presence of collector on the coal surface could improve the hydrophobicity. The number of hydrogen bond between water and modified coal surface decreases and the mobility of water molecules increases compared to the original coal surface. However, the extent of hydrophobicity of modified coal surface by these collectors is inconsistent with their adsorption capabilities. Nonylphenol is the worst collector to improve the surface hydrophobicity of coal as part of nonylphenol molecules orient away from coal surface to form hydrogen bonds via their hydroxyl groups with water molecules. Dodecane should be the most effective collector as the hydration energy of the modified surface and the number of formed hydrogen bond between this surface and water molecules are the lowest, whereas the mobility of water molecules on this modified surface is the highest.

To improve performance and reduce costs, future designs propose direct steam generation (DSG) in the SEGS's collector field. Thus {{evaluation of the}} thermohydrodynamic performance of the DSG collector is a major task {{that has to be}} completed before these systems can be considered for commercial application. In this thesis thermal and hydrodynamic models of a DSG collector are developed to investigate collector performance at steady and transient state operation. The thermal model is developed by modelling radiation loss, convection loss, and conduction loss from the absorber tube. The hydrodynamic model consists of two main parts: flow pattern analysis, and pressure drop calculations. Different flow patterns that may occur in the solar absorber tube are considered in the model. Pressure drop correlations are validated with water-steam test data at conditions similar to the DSG collector. The thermal and hydrodynamic models are integrated into a thermohydrodynamic model to evaluate the steady-state performance of the DSG collector. The thermo-hydrodynamic model is combined with a model of the other components of a SEGS to study its performance with different collector-field and power-house arrangements. To find the effect of collector inclination on the SEGS overall performance, the SEGS performance is studied with a horizontal and an inclined DSG collector field by considering pressure drop in the collector field piping network. The appropriate spacing of collector arrays in the field is calculated by considering the shading between collectors. The annual performance of SEGS is evaluated using the hourly radiation data of different sites in Australia. A mathematical model of the transient operation of a solar absorber tube is developed by applying equations of conservation of mass, momentum and energy. The mathematical model is discretised in space and time and solved by an explicit finite difference technique. The transient model is used to study the collector operation during sudden changes in radiation and typical radiation conditions...|$|R
40|$|Thesis(MTech (Chem. Eng. Technology)) [...] //Cape Technikon, 1999 The gold mining {{industry}} has mainly relied upon {{the use of}} a highly polluting chemicals, such as mercury and cyanide, to recover gold from its ores. As environmental legislation has become more stringent in all countries and environmental protection has become the focus of world-wide research, development of environmental sound processes has been favoured. The Coal Gold Agglomeration (CGA) process is such a process which was developed some years ago and has the advantage in that gold is recovered by a procedure which has little or no effect on the environment. The CGA process is based on the hydrophobic characteristics of coal, gold and oil. Gold particles which are substantially free become attached to the coal-oil agglomerates during collision, and eventually penetrate into the agglomerates. The resulting agglomerates are recycled to increase the gold loading, separated from the slurry, burnt, ashed and smelted to produce gold bullion. Laboratory scale batch tests were performed on an artificial/synthetic gold ore, containing fine gold powder. The slurry was contacted with a mixture of coal and oil. i. e. coal-oil agglomerates, after which both the agglomerates and ore were analysed for gold. Operating parameters, such as the mode of contact between the coal-oil phase and the gold containing slurry, contact time of the slurry and the coal-oil phase, means of separating the coal-oil gold agglomerates from the slurry, coal to ore, coal to oil and water to ore ratios, type of <b>oil,</b> effect of <b>collectors</b> and the mineralogy of the ore on the gold recovery were investigated. Results have shown that stirring the coal-oil phase and the slug yielded higher gold loadings than shaking and the traditional rolling bottle technique. BI increasing the time of contact between the coal-oil phase and the gold slurry. the final gold loading in the agglomerates increases, until an equilibrium value is reached. An increase in the amount of coal, together with a decrease in the amount of water used in the slurry, has shown to increase gold recoveries. Furthermore, by varying the concentration and volume of a collector. such as potassium amyl xanthate (PAX) enhanced the settling rate and enabled the effectiveness of separation. Moreover, {{it was found that the}} gold loading on the coal-oil phase increased after recycling it. Further tests were performed on a real ore sample and after X-ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis, it was found that certain minerals other than gold was transferred to the coal-oil phase. The theoretical foundation of the CGA process is based on the difference in free energy and was expressed as a function of the interfacial tensions and three-phase contact angles between gold, oil and water, together with the ratio of coal-oil agglomerate to gold particle radii, as the free energy is a measure of the thermodynamic stability and hence, partly a measure of gold recoveries, meaningful predictions as to gold recoveries were made by performing a sensitivity analysis on the variables connected to the free energy, It was, however, found that some operating parameters, which were linked to other factors, such as the maximum gold transfer into coal-oil phase and the separation efficiency of the agglomerates. were vital to be taken into account when predictions as to gold recoveries were made. Therefore, the gold recoveries were found to be a function of the thermodynamic stability as well as the maximum gold transfer into the coal-oil phase and the separation efficiency of the agglomerates, The meaningful information gained by performing the theoretical investigations were applied and linked to gold recoveries, thereby providing useful explanations as to the typical gold recoveries obtained during experimentation. A comparative study on mercury amalgamation was done to evaluate the performance of the CGA process. It was found that the CGA process yielded better gold recoveries than amalgamation, which makes it the better process both in terms of recoveries as well as environmental safety, A further application of the theoretical knowledge was, however, very useful to explain the tendency of the CGA process yielding the better results...|$|R
