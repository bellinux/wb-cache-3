5|$|Judicial oratory {{had become}} a {{significant}} literary genre by {{the second half of}} the fifth century, as represented in the speeches of Demosthenes' predecessors, Antiphon and Andocides. Logographers were a unique aspect of the Athenian justice system: evidence for a case was compiled by a magistrate in a preliminary hearing and litigants could present it as they pleased within set speeches; however, witnesses and documents were popularly mistrusted (since they could be secured by force or bribery), there was little cross-examination during the trial, there were no instructions to the jury from a judge, no conferencing between jurists before voting, the juries were huge (typically between 201 and 501 members), cases depended largely <b>on</b> <b>questions</b> <b>of</b> probable motive, and notions of natural justice were felt to take precedence over written law—conditions that favoured artfully constructed speeches.* H. Yunis, Demosthenes: On The Crown, 263 (note 275).|$|E
5|$|Speaking in Parliament on 12 February 2009, Nominated Member of Parliament Thio Li-ann {{posed the}} {{question}} of whether the right to vote is a constitutional one and suggested that the Law Minister obtain an advisory opinion to clarify the point. This issue was briefly dealt with by the Minister who simply answered it in the affirmative, rendering the need for a resolution by the constitutional tribunal nugatory. Thio subsequently expressed the view that it would be desirable to ask the Constitutional Tribunal to give its authoritative opinion as the courts are the final arbiter <b>on</b> <b>questions</b> <b>of</b> constitutionality in Singapore.|$|E
25|$|Three {{professional}} judges sit alongside six {{jurors in}} first instance proceedings or nine in appeal proceedings. Before 2012, {{there were nine}} or twelve jurors, but this was reduced to cut spending. A two-thirds majority is {{needed in order to}} convict the defendant. During these procedures, judges and jurors have equal positions <b>on</b> <b>questions</b> <b>of</b> fact, while judges decide <b>on</b> <b>questions</b> <b>of</b> procedure. Judges and jurors also have equal positions on sentencing.|$|E

25|$|Some biographers {{hold the}} opinion {{that many of the}} American Founding Fathers (and {{especially}} Washington) believed that, as leaders of the nation, they should remain silent <b>on</b> <b>questions</b> <b>of</b> doctrine and denomination, to avoid creating unnecessary divisiveness within the nation; instead they should promote the virtues taught by religion in general.|$|E

25|$|Led by highly {{respected}} elder statesmen Koo Chen-fu and Wang Daohan, {{the two organizations}} {{began a series of}} talks that culminated in the 1992 meetings, which, together with subsequent correspondence, may have established the 1992 Consensus, under which both sides agreed to deliberate ambiguity <b>on</b> <b>questions</b> <b>of</b> sovereignty, in order to engage on operational questions affecting both sides.|$|E

25|$|From 1907 to 1910, Moore {{served as}} an {{official}} adviser on constitutional matters to the Government of Victoria, serving under Premiers Sir Thomas Bent and John Murray, and advised several conservative leaders in federal politics.

25|$|Classical Greek {{geometry}} {{defined the}} Euclidean plane and Euclidean three-dimensional space using certain postulates, {{while the other}} properties of these spaces were deduced as theorems. Geometric constructions are also used to define rational numbers. When algebra and mathematical analysis became developed enough, this relation reversed {{and now it is}} more common to define Euclidean space using Cartesian coordinates and the ideas of analytic geometry. It means that points of the space are specified with collections of real numbers, and geometric shapes are defined as equations and inequalities. This approach brings the tools of algebra and calculus to bear <b>on</b> <b>questions</b> <b>of</b> geometry and has the advantage that it generalizes easily to Euclidean spaces of more than three dimensions.|$|E
25|$|Recently (and {{sporadically}} in the 20th century) {{the novel}} {{has been seen}} in the context of 17th-century politics and 16th-century literature. Janet Todd argues that Behn deeply admired Othello, and identified elements of Othello in the novel. In Behn's longer career, her works center <b>on</b> <b>questions</b> <b>of</b> kingship quite frequently, and Behn herself took a radical philosophical position. Her works question the virtues of noble blood as they assert, repeatedly, the mystical strength of kingship and of great leaders. The character of Oroonoko solves Behn's questions by being a natural king and a natural leader, a man who is anointed and personally strong, and he is poised against nobles who have birth but no actual strength.|$|E
25|$|Finally, an {{emerging}} union-side argument against comprehensive campaigns is that legal action may expose the union's internal operations and strategies to employer scrutiny. Many legal actions, whether initiated by a union or an employer, turn <b>on</b> <b>questions</b> <b>of</b> fact. Employers can make plausible arguments for extensive discovery. In {{at least one}} case, an employer has used discovery procedures to force the union to disclose pro-union supporters within the workplace, the number of organizers working on the campaign, its organizing strategies, its organizing budget and the amount and kind of information it had collected regarding the employer. Unions, critics say, can ill-afford to have such information made known to employers, especially during an organizing campaign.|$|E
