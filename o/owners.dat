5|$|Baseball had {{for some}} time been living uneasily in the {{knowledge}} that bribes were being offered by gamblers, and that some players were accepting them. The players knew it was going on, and the <b>owners</b> knew it was going on. But more important, the players knew that the <b>owners</b> knew—and they knew the <b>owners</b> were doing nothing about it for fear of a scandal that might damage organized baseball. Under such conditions it quite obviously did not pay to be honest.|$|E

Prior to the meeting, the other minority <b>owners</b> had held a tactics meeting to discuss what to do.

5|$|For {{eight years}} after the fire, One Meridian Plaza sat vacant and damaged—in the center of Philadelphia's {{business}} district. The building was caught in litigation between the <b>owners</b> and the insurance company over how much the insurers would pay the <b>owners</b> and how repairs or demolition would proceed. Businesses near the empty high-rise closed or moved and the city sued the <b>owners</b> {{to do something with}} the building. After lawsuits were settled, the building was declared a total loss and began to be dismantled in 1998. At the time of its demolition in 1999, One Meridian Plaza was the third-tallest destroyed building in the world.|$|E
5|$|General Motors is {{sponsoring}} the Pecan Street demonstration project in Austin, Texas.

The Mueller neighborhood is the test ground, and , the community has nearly 60 Chevrolet Volt <b>owners</b> alone. This cluster of Volts was achieved thanks to GM's commitment to match the federal government's $7,500 rebate incentive, which effectively halves the purchase price of the plug-hybrid electric cars.|$|E

30|$|Second, {{selective}} tracking {{is applied}} following identification and localization of a suspicious luggage item. This approach seeks the <b>owner</b> of the luggage {{in a neighborhood}} around the detected item. If the <b>owner</b> is found within this neighborhood, the luggage {{is assumed to be}} being attended by its <b>owner</b> and thus to require no further processing. However, if no <b>owner</b> is found, the tracking algorithm returns to the frame in which the <b>owner</b> was still attending the luggage, and starts tracking the <b>owner</b> from that point. Selective tracking only tracks the <b>owner,</b> and ignores other irrelevant moving objects in the foreground. Accordingly, the computational requirements of selective tracking are less than in previous works.|$|R

5|$|Initially, {{both the}} mill <b>owners</b> and local unions were against the army's {{takeover}} of lumber production. The mill <b>owners</b> disliked having the army overseeing their businesses, and the unions saw soldiers' labor {{as a form}} of strikebreaking. Disque, however, called on everyone to support war production. He was also careful not to favor either <b>owners</b> or unions as he increased production, helping both sides achieve their goals. For the mill <b>owners,</b> military manpower kept mills open and running at full capacity; in addition, it prevented radicals from sabotaging facilities or equipment. The unions benefited because military rules stabilized wages and improved working conditions for loggers and sawmill workers throughout the Pacific Northwest. Among the improved conditions was a standard eight-hour day.|$|E
