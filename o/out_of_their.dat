5|$|Many of the cottages {{were now}} burning, {{obscuring}} {{the field of}} fire and driving the defenders <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> positions. Hearing the din of battle in Blenheim, Tallard {{sent a message to}} Marlborough offering to order the garrison to withdraw from the field.|$|E

5|$|Most Iridomyrmex {{species are}} {{aggressive}} ants that will attack anything which attacks or disturbs their nests or trails they forage on. This is noticeable with particular member {{species of the}} I. purpureus species group, where they will pour <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> nest and attack and kill all intruders. Even smaller species show similar behaviours to these ants and will also swarm <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> nests to bite and spray iridomyrmecin, a defensive chemical found in the genus. Because of their large numbers, aggression, and activeness, Iridomyrmex ants are ecologically dominant in Australia, and several species are known to obtain exclusive possession to food sources and prevent other insects from using them. These ants will also affect foraging behaviours of other ant nests living nearby due to how active they are and their large numbers.|$|E
5|$|Parker {{wanted to}} take the older {{characters}} completely <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> element and involve them in a romantic comedy. They initially encountered difficulties finding a studio; Working Title Films rejected their proposals, considering it unmarketable, but they eventually aligned with Participant Media, Imagination Abu Dhabi FZ, and Blueprint Pictures.|$|E
5|$|The {{movement}} encourages Muslims {{to spend}} time <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> daily routine in the tablighi activities so {{that the rest of}} routine could be harmonised with Tablighi lifestyle.

5|$|Within the {{red blood}} cells, the parasites {{multiply}} further, again asexually, periodically breaking <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> host cells to invade fresh red blood cells.

5|$|A large workhouse such as Whitechapel, {{accommodating}} {{several thousand}} paupers, employed {{a staff of}} almost 200; the smallest may only have had a porter and perhaps an assistant nurse {{in addition to the}} master and matron. A typical workhouse accommodating 225 inmates had a staff of five, which included a part-time chaplain and a part-time medical officer. The low pay meant that many medical officers were young and inexperienced. To add to their difficulties, in most unions they were obliged to pay <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> own pockets for any drugs, dressings or other medical supplies needed to treat their patients.|$|E
5|$|According to Maple's account, in {{the last}} few weeks of Pickingill's life, when he had become very ill, the local people moved him to the {{infirmary}} against his will, where he declared that at his funeral there would be one more demonstration of his magical powers. Many locals interpreted this as coming true when as the hearse carrying his coffin drew up to the churchyard, the horses stepped <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> harness shafts. His body was subsequently buried in the church's graveyard, whilst his abandoned house gradually became dilapidated before falling down.|$|E

5|$|After Mr. Garrison gets a nose job, {{his face}} {{resembles that of}} David Hasselhoff, the actor and singer {{best known for the}} series Knight Rider and Baywatch. Mr. Garrison refers disparagingly to the 1997 science fiction drama film Contact.

5|$|After World War II, the Kanak {{independence}} movement again picked up momentum when the United Nations placed New Caledonia on its Decolonisation List of Non-Self-Governing Territories in 1946. A major progression occurred when Kanaks and French {{settlers in the}} country obtained voting rights in 1951, shortly before it became an overseas territory of France in 1956. The Kanaks were then also allowed to move <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> reserve areas. This {{was followed by the}} establishment of the Territorial Assembly in 1957, but this was short-lived; Charles de Gaulle abolished it after he became the President of France, in 1958.|$|E
5|$|After humans {{migrated}} <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> ancestral {{environment of}} eastern Africa, they {{were exposed to}} new climates and challenges. Thus, Wade argues, human evolution did not end with behavioural modernity, but continued to be shaped by the different environments and lifestyles of each continent. While many adaptations happened in parallel across human populations, Wade believes that genetic isolation – either because of geography or hostile tribalism – also facilitated a degree of independent evolution, leading to genetic and cultural differentiation from the ancestral population and giving rise to different human races and languages.|$|E

5|$|After {{the cavalry}} {{breakthrough}} on the coast, the XXI Corps would advance {{to capture the}} headquarters of the Ottoman Eighth Army at Tulkarm together with sections of the lateral railway line in the Judean Hills between Tulkarm and Nablus, a branch of the Jezreel Valley railway, which supplied the two Ottoman Armies, including the important railway junction at Messudieh in the Judean Hills. The infantry divisions were to continue their attack by swinging north–east, pivoting on their right to push the defenders back <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> trenches away from the coast and back into the Judean Hills towards Messudieh.|$|E
5|$|Air-landing {{obstacles}} {{were not}} the only tactic Rommel used against aerial invaders. Rommel ordered the flooding of some fields so that glider troops and paratroops landing in the water would drown. He ordered machine gun crews to cover the exits of fields that were bounded by bocage—tall, dense hedgerows—so that glider infantry and paratroopers would come under fire as they moved <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> landing area. The bocage hedgerows themselves were the worse hazard to safe glider landings, and caused more glider casualties than Rommelspargel.|$|E
5|$|Albatrosses, {{along with}} all Procellariiformes, must excrete the salts they ingest in {{drinking}} sea water and eating marine invertebrates. All birds have an enlarged nasal gland {{at the base of}} the bill, above their eyes. This gland is inactive in species that do not require it, but in the Procellariiformes it acts as a salt gland. Scientists are uncertain as to its exact processes, but do know in general terms that it removes salt by secreting a 5% saline solution that drips <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> nose or is forcibly ejected.|$|E
