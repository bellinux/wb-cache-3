5|$|Clark's {{relationships}} with the other characters evolved {{over the course of}} the show. Clark's relationship with Lex Luthor was symbolic, as the two shared a yin and yang type <b>of</b> <b>relationship.</b> In the pilot, Clark first saved Lex from drowning after a car accident; at the end of the episode, Lex saved Clark when he was strung up in the cornfield and immobilized by kryptonite. His relationship with Lex was tested by his lack of honesty, just like it was with Lana for the first six seasons; the same could be said for Lex's dishonesty with Clark. Both characters wanted to be completely honest with each other, but knew they could not, which inhibited their friendship.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} pointed out that, architecturally, both the O-13 Pyramid and the Late Classic Temple of the Inscriptions at Palenque, are nearly identical; both have {{the same number of}} {{substructure}} terraces, and both pyramids' substructures have exactly five doors. Furthermore, both pyramids were built into the sides of existing hills.

5|$|Penda's brother Eowa {{was also}} said by the Historia Brittonum and the Annales Cambriae {{to have been}} a king of the Mercians at the time of Maserfield. The {{question}} of what sort <b>of</b> <b>relationship</b> of power existed between the brothers before the battle is a matter of speculation. Eowa may have simply been a sub-king under Penda and {{it is also possible that}} Penda and Eowa ruled jointly during the 630s and early 640s: joint kingships were not uncommon among Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of the period. They may have ruled the southern and northern Mercians respectively. That Penda ruled the southern part is a possibility suggested by his early involvement in the area of the Hwicce, to the south of Mercia, as well as by the fact that, after Penda's death, his son Peada was allowed to rule southern Mercia while the northern part was placed under direct Northumbrian control.|$|E
5|$|Social {{ecological}} behaviours are notable in {{the social}} insects, slime moulds, social spiders, human society, and naked mole-rats where eusocialism has evolved. Social behaviours include reciprocally beneficial behaviours among kin and nest mates and evolve from kin and group selection. Kin selection explains altruism through genetic relationships, whereby an altruistic behaviour leading to death is rewarded by the survival of genetic copies distributed among surviving relatives. The social insects, including ants, bees, and wasps are most famously studied for this type <b>of</b> <b>relationship</b> because the male drones are clones that share the same genetic make-up as every other male in the colony. In contrast, group selectionists find examples of altruism among non-genetic relatives and explain this through selection acting on the group; whereby, it becomes selectively advantageous for groups if their members express altruistic behaviours to one another. Groups with predominantly altruistic members beat groups with predominantly selfish members.|$|E

5|$|Among all predators, ants are the {{greatest}} enemy to termites. Some ant genera are specialist predators of termites. For example, Megaponera is a strictly termite-eating (termitophagous) genus that perform raiding activities, some lasting several hours. Paltothyreus tarsatus is another termite-raiding species, with each individual stacking as many termites as possible in its mandibles before returning home, all the while recruiting additional nestmates to the raiding site through chemical trails. The Malaysian basicerotine ants Eurhopalothrix heliscata uses a different strategy of termite hunting by pressing themselves into tight spaces, as they hunt through rotting wood housing termite colonies. Once inside, the ants seize their prey by using their short but sharp mandibles. Tetramorium uelense is a specialised predator species that feeds on small termites. A scout recruits 10–30 workers to an area where termites are present, killing them by immobilising them with their stinger. Centromyrmex and Iridomyrmex colonies sometimes nest in termite mounds, and so the termites are preyed on by these ants. No evidence for any kind <b>of</b> <b>relationship</b> (other than a predatory one) is known. Other ants, including Acanthostichus, Camponotus, Crematogaster, Cylindromyrmex, Leptogenys, Odontomachus, Ophthalmopone, Pachycondyla, Rhytidoponera, Solenopsis and Wasmannia, also prey on termites. In contrast to all these ant species, and despite their enormous diversity of prey, Dorylus ants rarely consume termites.|$|E
5|$|Iridomyrmex {{primarily}} {{feeds on}} sweet {{foods such as}} nectar and honeydew. They hunt for insects and other ants to feed to their young, and workers are particularly attracted to seeds with elaiosomes. They collect these seeds, remove the elaiosomes, and then discard the seeds. The seedlings that sprout from these seeds benefit from proximity to the aggressive Iridomyrmex ants, giving them {{a better chance of}} survival. Colonies sometimes nest in termite mounds, and so the termites are regularly preyed on by Iridomyrmex; no evidence for any kind <b>of</b> <b>relationship</b> (other than a predatory one) is known. Juvenile cane toads are often preyed on, as certain Iridomyrmex species such as I. purpureus and I. ruburrus are immune to the toxins released by the cane toads. As a result, placing Iridomyrmex nests in habitats which house cane toads have been suggested as a method of controlling the cane toad population. The meat ant is the only known ant in Australia that feeds on guano.|$|E

40|$|The {{majority}} of academic literature explicitly or implicitly defines an organisation as “a group of people”. In this paper, we advocate {{a distinction between}} the formal social unit (“FSU”) as economic organisation and its (internal) organisation and argue that the latter is essentially the structure (or set) <b>of</b> dynamic <b>relationships</b> between the FSU’s members. Such an approach is supported by the two levels, economic and organisational, of that adaptation of an FSU’s organisation in promoting success in a high-performance economy. A consideration <b>of</b> <b>relationships</b> between members as basic units of organisational analysis elicits the question of which types <b>of</b> <b>relationships</b> (out <b>of</b> many available classifications) are most crucial for attaining the FSU’s goals. By taking firms as the prevailing types of FSUs, we find five (close to Barnard’s view) types or dimensions <b>of</b> <b>relationships,</b> creating the direct instrumental chain <b>of</b> <b>relationships,</b> as being most influential regarding this objective. Due to our awareness that the performance of a firm significantly depends {{on the quality of the}} five types <b>of</b> <b>relationships,</b> we suggest that well-defined statistical analyses should be made in order to prove the strength of the influence between the quality <b>of</b> <b>relationships</b> on the direct instrumental chain and the firm’s performance in economic terms. A comparison with similar analyses in which some other groupings <b>of</b> <b>relationships</b> are taken into consideration should prove or negate our assumption...|$|R
