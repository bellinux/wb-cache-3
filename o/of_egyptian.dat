5|$|Ancient Greek and Roman writers, who {{described}} Egyptian religion late in its history, recorded {{much of the}} Osiris myth. Herodotus, in the 5th century BCE, mentioned parts of the myth in his description of Egypt in The Histories, and four centuries later, Diodorus Siculus provided {{a summary of the}} myth in his Bibliotheca historica. In the early 2nd century AD, Plutarch wrote the most complete ancient account of the myth in De Iside et Osiride, an analysis <b>of</b> <b>Egyptian</b> religious beliefs. Plutarch's account of the myth is the version that modern popular writings most frequently retell. The writings of these classical authors may give a distorted view <b>of</b> <b>Egyptian</b> beliefs. For instance, De Iside et Osiride includes many interpretations <b>of</b> <b>Egyptian</b> belief that are influenced by various Greek philosophies, and its account of the myth contains portions with no known parallel in Egyptian tradition. Griffiths concluded that several elements of this account were taken from Greek mythology, and that the work as a whole was not based directly on Egyptian sources. His colleague John Baines, on the other hand, says that temples may have kept written accounts of myths, which later were lost, and that Plutarch could have drawn on such sources to write his narrative.|$|E
5|$|Foreign {{religions}} were tolerated {{insofar as}} they did not interfere with public order, or could be assimilated with the traditional Roman religion. The worship <b>of</b> <b>Egyptian</b> deities in particular flourished under the Flavian dynasty, to an extent not seen again until the reign of Commodus. Veneration of Serapis and Isis, who were identified with Jupiter and Minerva respectively, was especially prominent.|$|E
5|$|Gods were {{assumed to}} be present {{throughout}} the world, capable of influencing natural events and the course of human lives. People interacted with them in temples and unofficial shrines, for personal reasons {{as well as for}} larger goals of state rites. Egyptians prayed for divine help, used rituals to compel deities to act, and called upon them for advice. Humans' relations with their gods were a fundamental part <b>of</b> <b>Egyptian</b> society.|$|E

5|$|It was {{not until}} 1799, with the Napoleonic {{discovery}} of a trilingual (i.e. hieroglyphic, Demotic, Greek) stela inscription on the Rosetta Stone, that modern scholars were able to decipher ancient Egyptian literature. The first major effort to translate the hieroglyphs of the Rosetta Stone was made by Jean-François Champollion (1790–1832) in 1822. The earliest translation efforts <b>of</b> <b>Egyptian</b> literature during the 19th century were attempts to confirm Biblical events.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{knowledge}} <b>of</b> <b>Egyptian</b> {{beliefs about}} the gods is mostly drawn from religious writings produced by the nation's scribes and priests. These people were the elite <b>of</b> <b>Egyptian</b> society and were very distinct from the general populace, {{most of whom were}} illiterate. Little is known about how well this broader population knew or understood the sophisticated ideas that the elite developed. Commoners' perceptions of the divine may have differed from those of the priests. The populace may, for example, have mistaken the religion's symbolic statements about the gods and their actions for literal truth. But overall, what little is known about popular religious belief is consistent with the elite tradition. The two traditions form a largely cohesive vision of the gods and their nature.|$|E
5|$|Predynastic Egypt {{originally}} {{consisted of}} small, independent villages. Because many deities in later times were {{strongly tied to}} particular towns and regions, many scholars {{have suggested that the}} pantheon formed as disparate communities coalesced into larger states, spreading and intermingling the worship of the old local deities. But others have argued that the most important predynastic gods were, like other elements <b>of</b> <b>Egyptian</b> culture, present all across the country despite the political divisions within it.|$|E
