On 17 April 2014, Putin acknowledged the Russian military backed Crimean separatist militias, stating that Russia's intervention was necessary [...] "to ensure proper {{conditions for the}} people of Crimea to be able to freely express their will". Defence Minister Sergey Shoygu said the country's military actions in Crimea were undertaken by forces of the Black Sea Fleet and were justified by [...] "threat to lives of Crimean civilians" [...] and danger of [...] "takeover of Russian military infrastructure by extremists". Ukraine complained that by increasing its troop presence in Crimea, Russia violated the agreement under which it headquartered its Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol and violated the country's sovereignty. The United States and United Kingdom also accused Russia of breaking the terms of the Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances, by which Russia, the US, and the UK had reaffirmed their <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> <b>refrain</b> <b>from</b> the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine. The Russian government said the Budapest Memorandum did not apply due to [...] "complicated internal processes" [...] in Crimea. In March 2015 retired Russian Admiral Igor Kasatonov stated that according to his information the Russian troop deployment in Crimea included six helicopter landings and three landings of IL-76 with 500 people.|$|E
5000|$|Rights {{are often}} spoken of as {{inalienable}} {{and sometimes even}} absolute.

Thus, even if the right not to be killed is inalienable, the corresponding <b>obligation</b> on others <b>to</b> <b>refrain</b> <b>from</b> killing is generally understood to have at least one exception: self-defense. Certain widely accepted negative obligations (such as the <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> <b>refrain</b> <b>from</b> theft, murder, etc.) are often considered prima facie, meaning that the legitimacy of the obligation is accepted [...] "on its face"; but even if not questioned, such obligations may still be ranked for ethical analysis.|$|R

40|$|Informed consent {{requirements}} for medical research have expanded {{over the past}} half-century. The focus here is upon one aspect of this expansion: the introduction of explicit <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> inform subjects about funding sources, in the Declaration of Helsinki. Whilst it is agreed from the outset that a failure to inform about funding sources can wrong a research subject, a general obligation is problematic {{in a number of}} ways: including, determining the scope of the norm; plus problems with subjects’ comprehension of complex funding information, and, most importantly, that such a norm seems to oblige researchers to disclose too much, including information irrelevant to most consent decisions. We ask whether the general obligation in Helsinki might be justified by appeal to respect for autonomy and informed consent, but find that it cannot be. The general <b>obligation</b> seems <b>to</b> rest upon an “informational fallacy”. We then note that this orthodox justification of research ethics—by appeal to respect for autonomy and informed consent—has been subject to various critiques. The aim {{in the second part of}} the paper is to provide a better approach to making sense of how a failure to inform about funding sources wrongs subjects: making appeal <b>to</b> <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> <b>refrain</b> <b>from</b> misleading by omission. This alternative approach—grounded in <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> <b>refrain</b> <b>from</b> misleading—provides a basis for a norm that protects subjects interests without being hostage to the orthodox justification, that avoids the informational fallacy, and that—by and large—avoids the problems noted above about the scope of the obligation, and its implications for subjects’ comprehension...|$|R

40|$|Global tax {{abuse is}} one of the key {{obstacles}} to sustainable development. Each year more than USD one trillion are lost to cross border tax abuse and stored away in tax havens. We establish that tax abuse accumulates capital, makes tax systems more regressive and diminishes government revenues. Tax abuse consequently indirectly increases economic inequality and relative poverty and reduces social expenditure affecting both dimensions of economic and social rights fulfillment: the ability of people to claim their rights in the market place or through the provision of entitlements. We test our theory in a cross-sectional study and find empirical evidence for several of the factors in our theory. Both revenue generation and expenditure of fiscal policy are subject <b>to</b> the <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> progressively realize economic and social human rights by using the maximum of available resources. We confirm that Mozambique has respect, protect and fulfill <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> <b>refrain</b> <b>from</b> granting extensive tax exemptions, prevent tax avoidance and prosecute tax evasion. State parties hosting and controlling multinational corporations committing tax abuse abroad have similar extraterritorial obligations. Tax havens and secrecy jurisdictions deliberately undermine the sovereignty of other states in domestic resource mobilization for rights fulfillment...|$|R

5000|$|From this article, two {{obligations}} arise on {{the part}} of the state: firstly, the negative <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> <b>refrain</b> <b>from</b> interfering with an individuals right to life arises; secondly, the positive obligation to protect it said rights.

40|$|Under {{customary}} law {{as well as}} the amendments to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court adopted in the Review Conference in Kampala in 2010, an act of aggression by a State {{is a part of the}} definition of the crime of aggression. This definition clearly encompasses two separate wrongful conducts by different actors. It is less clear how international responsibility arises for both the aggressor state and the individual, and why responsibility for the latter can be predicated only upon the former. This dissertation analyses the way in which aggression is attributed to the aggressor State and the individual, and how State and individual responsibility is delineated from each other, with a particular focus on the legal interest of the aggressed State. First, the argument considers the way in which international law prohibits and criminalizes aggression, elaborating international obligations of States and individuals in that regard (Part I). It then analyses the interconnection between <b>obligations</b> of States <b>to</b> <b>refrain</b> <b>from</b> an act of aggression and <b>obligations</b> of individuals <b>to</b> <b>refrain</b> <b>from</b> conduct relating <b>to</b> the crime of aggression (Part II).

40|$|Violence {{against women}} {{is the most}} common form of {{domestic}} violence.

However, since the problem of domestic violence against women has become increasingly common, the attitude of the international community began to change, and it was increasingly emphasizes the need to create adequate legal mechanisms to provide protection to the victim. In this sense, in the United Nations, and the European Union a number of laws were enacted. In Serbia, there is also both, criminal and civil law regulation that seeks to prevent domestic violence and to punish perpetrators and protect victims. In addition to adequate legal mechanisms, which can always be improved, it is necessary to take certain initiatives by states that can lead to improved awareness among the people about the presence of violence, and the ways in which they can help...|$|R
50|$|There {{are four}} {{references}} to Chillul Hashem in the Torah (Lev. 18:21, ibid. 19:12, ibid. 22:2, ibid. 22:32). The general prohibition of desecrating God’s name is stated most explicitly in Leviticus: “And you shall not desecrate My Holy name; and I shall be sanctified {{in the midst}} of the Children of Israel. I am the Lord who sanctifies you (Lev. 22:32).” In addition to the references in the Torah, Chillul Hashem is mentioned extensively in Prophets and Writings, especially in the Book Ezekiel. The fact that it appears so frequently throughout the Old Testament demonstrates its centrality and severity. A notable example is Ezekiel 36:20-24 in which the prophet laments the Jewish Exile to Babylonia and claims that the reality of exile — specifically, the Jewish people living outside their ancestral homeland — is itself a desecration of God’s name.

30|$|Nevertheless, in a {{perspective}} of collective action {{the key question}} is not whether any one individual will contribute, but whether enough individuals will contribute rather than free-ride. Individuals are seen to have contingent strategies or preferences, cooperation being contingent on certain aspects of the choice-situation. For example, cooperation {{has been found to be}} more likely when it is perceived that the good will only be provided if every member of the collective action contributes. In other words, cooperation is more likely when it is perceived that collective action will have a desirable outcome. For these reasons the key determinants of willingness to contribute to the public good should include social dilemma and trust in other people’s cooperation. More precisely, we assume that pro-social behavior is predicted by five types of determinants: social dilemma, trust in other people, social/personal norms, awareness of consequences and awareness of responsibility. Among these, social/personal norms are related <b>to</b> a “moral <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> perform or <b>refrain</b> <b>from</b> specific actions” (Schwartz & Howard, [1981]), p. 191. The awareness of consequences is defined as whether someone is aware of the positive or negative consequences for others when acting or not acting pro-socially to protect the environment. Finally, awareness of responsibility is described as a condition in which “a person believes he or she can make a useful contribution to the solution of the problem, whith perceived outcome efficacy” (Montada, and Kals, [2000]; De Groot and Steg, [2009]). However, according to the literature on collective action, it is important to stress that trust in other people occurs when individuals are engaged in an interaction process. Therefore it is possible to suppose that in an early-stage, hypothetical, collective action this variable could be difficult to predict.|$|R
