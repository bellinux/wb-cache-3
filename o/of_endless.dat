5|$|Beyond the Clans' territories lies a {{mountain}} range, inhabited by the Tribe of Rushing Water. The Tribe {{is shown to}} be similar to the Clans, yet follows a different set of ancestors: the Tribe <b>of</b> <b>Endless</b> Hunting. The Tribe has a Healer, cave-guards, and prey-hunters, who each serve a different function in the Tribe. The Healer leads the Tribe, heals the ill and wounded, and communicates with the Tribe <b>of</b> <b>Endless</b> Hunting; the cave-guards defend the Tribe, and the prey-hunters hunt.The Tribe was formed by the Ancients when they left the lake to live in the mountains. In turn, cats from the Tribe moved to the forest of the original series and formed the Clans.|$|E
5|$|The {{numbers of}} troops that Xerxes mustered {{for the second}} {{invasion}} of Greece {{have been the subject}} <b>of</b> <b>endless</b> dispute. Most modern scholars reject as unrealistic the figures of 2.5 million given by Herodotus and other ancient sources because the victors likely miscalculated or exaggerated. The topic has been hotly debated, but the consensus revolves around the figure of 200,000.|$|E
5|$|This {{version of}} the song replaces the word 'nights' with 'lights', in the line 'There were nights <b>of</b> <b>endless</b> pleasure'. The ending of the single version is different, {{concluding}} with an additional 'We forgive and forget and it's all coming back to me now'. The album version, following those recorded by Pandora's Box and Celine Dion, ends with the female voice whispering 'And if we...', followed by four piano notes.|$|E
50|$|Each <b>of</b> the <b>Endless</b> has a realm {{in which}} they are {{absolutely}} sovereign. Within their realm, each member <b>of</b> the <b>Endless</b> has a gallery containing symbols, or sigils, <b>of</b> the other <b>Endless.</b> The Endless may contact each other by holding the appropriate sigil and calling for that member <b>of</b> the <b>Endless.</b> Destiny is also able to summon his siblings by using his gallery of portraits, whether they want it or not (as seen in The Sandman : Overture).|$|R

5|$|Offitt's {{membership}} has tired <b>of</b> <b>endless</b> talk, and plans a general strike, {{a fact of}} which Farnham is informed by Mr. Temple, a salty-talking vice president of a rolling mill. An element among the strikers also plans to loot houses along Algonquin Avenue, including Farnham's. The strike begins, paralyzing Buffland's commerce, though it is initially nonviolent. Neither the mayor nor the chief of police, when approached by Farnham, are willing to guard Algonquin Avenue. Farnham proceeds to organize Civil War veterans, and purchases weapons to arm them. After Farnham's force rescues the mayor from being attacked, he deputizes them as special police—on condition there is no expense to the city.|$|E
5|$|The {{illusion}} <b>of</b> <b>endless</b> rows of Klingons {{was created}} by brightly lighting the accused {{in the center of}} the room with a bright blue light, then letting the rest of the set fall into shadow. To give the set a larger appearance, a shot from high above the courtroom was created using miniatures. Inspired by a scene in Ben-Hur, matte supervisor Craig Barron used two hundred commercially available Worf dolls sent by Ralph Winter. Angry Klingons were created by rocking the dolls back and forth with motors, waving sticks lit by twelve-volt light bulbs dyed red. The resulting courtroom miniature was ten feet long.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} troops which Xerxes mustered for the second {{invasion}} of Greece {{has been the subject}} <b>of</b> <b>endless</b> dispute, most notably between ancient sources, which report very large numbers, and modern scholars, who surmise much smaller figures. Herodotus claimed that there were, in total, 2.6 million military personnel, accompanied by an equivalent number of support personnel. The poet Simonides, who was a near-contemporary, talks of four million; Ctesias gave 800,000 as the total number of the army that was assembled by Xerxes.|$|E

5|$|Aerial {{dispersion}} {{is important}} in this species, despite its restricted distribution. Queens never forage outside or leave the nest, unless under severe deprivation. Before nuptial flight, fully developed females start to occur during summer. Between 9 and 10 pm in January, queens and males start to emerge from their host nest and begin to mate. Observations show that the alates will climb up onto objects such as lighted fluorescent lamps and begin to fly {{after half an hour}} <b>of</b> <b>endless</b> running. When queens are looking for a host nest or wandering openly, M. vindex foragers may identify a queen and seize her; such behaviour suggests that workers actively recruit fertilised queens for their nest. Host colonies tend to be smaller and depauperated when compared to other colonies without any inquiline queens, but host colonies can still produce alate offspring.|$|E
5|$|On {{the return}} journey, the Clan cats decide, after {{consultation}} with Midnight, {{to go through}} a mountain range which they had avoided in their initial travels. There, they meet a Clan-like group of cats called the Tribe of Rushing Water, who have their own set of ancestors: the Tribe <b>of</b> <b>Endless</b> Hunting. The Tribe takes the traveling cats in and gives them food and shelter. The Clan cats discover that the Tribe cats have a prophecy: a silver cat will save them from Sharptooth, a savage lion-like creature that has been killing many members of the Tribe. The Tribe thinks that Stormfur is the silver cat from the prophecy, and he is therefore expected to protect the Tribe from Sharptooth. Stormfur eventually agrees to help the Tribe.|$|E
5|$|The {{numbers of}} troops that Xerxes mustered {{for the second}} {{invasion}} of Greece {{have been the subject}} <b>of</b> <b>endless</b> dispute, because the numbers given in ancient sources are very large indeed. Herodotus claimed that there were, in total, 2.5 million military personnel, accompanied by an equivalent number of support personnel. The poet Simonides, who was a contemporary, talks of four million; Ctesias, based on Persian records, gave 800,000 as the total number of the army (without the support personnel) that was assembled by Xerxes. While {{it has been suggested that}} Herodotus or his sources had access to official Persian Empire records of the forces involved in the expedition, modern scholars tend to reject these figures based on knowledge of the Persian military systems, their logistical capabilities, the Greek countryside, and supplies available along the army's route.|$|E
