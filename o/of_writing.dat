5|$|Hieroglyphic writing {{dates from}} c. 3000BC, and is {{composed}} of hundreds of symbols. A hieroglyph can represent a word, a sound, or a silent determinative; and the same symbol can serve different purposes in different contexts. Hieroglyphs were a formal script, used on stone monuments and in tombs, that could be as detailed as individual works of art. In day-to-day writing, scribes used a cursive form <b>of</b> <b>writing,</b> called hieratic, which was quicker and easier. While formal hieroglyphs may be read in rows or columns in either direction (though typically written from right to left), hieratic was always written from right to left, usually in horizontal rows. A new form <b>of</b> <b>writing,</b> Demotic, became the prevalent writing style, {{and it is this}} form of writing—along with formal hieroglyphs—that accompany the Greek text on the Rosetta Stone.|$|E

40|$|AbstractMalay, the {{national}} language <b>of</b> Malaysia, is <b>written</b> in two distinct scripts: the Arabic script and the Romanised script.

Salehuddin (2013) proposed {{the introduction of the}} Arabic vowel diacritics into the Arabic script <b>of</b> <b>written</b> Malay to reduce its cognitive complexity. Hence, this paper presents results of an experiment using DMDX as a tool to investigate the accuracy of reading Malay words written in Arabic script with and without diacritics...|$|R

This study aimed to explore the nurse teachers’ accounts of their perceptions and practices <b>of</b> providing <b>written</b> feedback. A descriptive exploratory design was employed in the study. A purposive sample of 12 teachers from nursing institutions in Karachi, Pakistan, participated in the study. Using a semi-structured guide, in-depth {{interviews were conducted with}} the participants, between January-September, 2013. The interviews were tape recorded and transcribed verbatim and were manually content analyzed. The analysis of findings led to three sections: teachers’ conceptions about written feedback, teachers’ practices <b>of</b> providing <b>written</b> feedback, and factors that affect the teachers’ practices <b>of</b> providing <b>written</b> feedback to their students. The findings indicated that although the teachers realize the importance <b>of</b> <b>written</b> feedback and its impact on students’ learning, several factors, including teachers’ competence and commitment, students’ receptivity, and contextual barriers, affected their practices. To actualize the potential power <b>of</b> teachers’ <b>written</b> feedback in students’ learning, both teachers and institutional administrators need to realize the importance <b>of</b> <b>written</b> feedback. Moreover concerted efforts including teachers’ development and policies are required to overcome the factors that negatively influence the practices <b>of</b> <b>written</b> feedback...|$|R

5|$|Several {{scholars}} {{have suggested that}} rongorongo {{may have been an}} invention inspired by this visit and the signing of the treaty of annexation. As circumstantial evidence, they note that no explorer reported the script prior to Eugène Eyraud in 1864, and are of the opinion that the marks with which the chiefs signed the Spanish treaty do not resemble rongorongo. The hypothesis of these researchers is not that rongorongo was itself a copy of the Latin alphabet, or of any other form <b>of</b> <b>writing,</b> but that the concept <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> had been conveyed in a process anthropologists term trans-cultural diffusion, which then inspired the islanders to invent their own system <b>of</b> <b>writing.</b> If this is the case, then rongorongo emerged, flourished, fell into oblivion, and was all but forgotten within a span of less than a hundred years.|$|E

The exact date <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> is unknown, and there is contention among scholars about when they were written. Paul Hammond among other scholars believes that sonnets 61-103 were written primarily during the early 1590s, and then being edited or added to later, during the early 1600s (decade). Regardless of date <b>of</b> <b>writing,</b> it was published later {{along with the rest of}} the sonnets of the 1609 Quarto.|$|E
