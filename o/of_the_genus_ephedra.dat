No tannin or glycosides {{have been identified}} from the plant. The roots and stems contain the alkaloid ephedrine, normally observed in <b>the</b> different varieties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gymnosperm <b>genus</b> <b>Ephedra.</b> Recent analyses have revealed that ephedrine and pseudoephedrine constitute the major alkaloids from <b>the</b> aerial parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plant, which also show traces of sitosterol and palmitic, stearic and hexacosanoic acids. The flavones: 5,7-dihydroxy-3-isoprenyl flavone (1) and 5-hydroxy-3-isoprenyl flavone (2), β-sitosterol and stigmasterol have been isolated from the plant. The analgesic alkaloid (5′-Hydroxymethyl-1′-(1,2,3,9-tetrahydro-pyrrolo 2,1-b quinazolin-1-yl)-heptan-1-one) has also been found.

40|$|Ephedrine, {{a natural}} {{alkaloid}} from plants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>genus</b> <b>Ephedra,</b> has a chemical structure similar to catecholamines. It {{is well established}} that catecholamines (adraneline, noradrenaline and dopamine) cause genotoxic and mutagenic effects. Therefore, the objectives of this investigation were to examine weather ephedrine can exhibit genotoxic effects on isolated human lymphocytes in the Comet assay. Dose-response of human lymphocytes was determined at the concentration range of ephedrine from 0. 0005 µM to 500 µM. Three concentrations of ephedrine (1, 50 and 300 µM) which had acceptable cell viability (over 90 %) were used for further experiments with inhibitors of DNA reparation (cytosine arabinoside and hydroxyurea). The obtained results showed that ephedrine did not induce DNA damage in isolated human lymphocytes. However, co-treatment of the negative control with DNA repair inhibitors caused a slight but significant increase of DNA damage, due to an endogenous DNA damage. Interestingly, cells treated with ephedrine and DNA repair inhibitors did not express increased DNA damage. On {{the basis of the}} obtained results it can be concluded that ephedrine did not exhibit genotoxic effects on isolated human lymphocytes. This result is in accordance with previous investigations showing negative genotoxicological results for ephedrine using bacterial gene mutation test-systems and in vitro cytogenetic analysis...|$|E
40|$|Ephedrine, phenylpropanolamine, (+) -pseudoephedrine and L- {{phenylephrine}} are effectivedecongestant and {{commonly incorporated}} into cold and allergy products. (-) -Ephedrine is derivedfrom several species <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>genus</b> <b>Ephedra.</b> Because of its indirect effect on neurotransmitterstores, long-term use of ephedrine {{can lead to}} tachyphylaxis. Increasing dosage can induce toxiceffects, including peripheral vasconstriction and cardiac stimulation, leading to increased bloodpressure and increased heart rate; adverse effects on {{the central nervous system}} include nervousness,anxiety, tremor, weakness, irritability and insomnia. These adverse effects decrease it used astherapeutic agent today. Phenylpropanolamine hydrochloride resembles ephedrine in its action,but it is somewhat more active as a vasoconstrictor and less active as a bronchodilator. Adverseeffects include hypertension, headache, jitteriness, irritability, insomnia, and cardiac rhythmirregularities. In November 2000, the FDA Food Advisory committee asked the restriction inusage of phenylpropanolamine due to the adverse effects associated with stroke. Moreover,pseudoephedrine {{can be used to make}} the illegal drug methamphetamine, also known as 「speed」and the access of pseudoephedrine is controlled at the retail level in many states in the USA. Therefore, the market for L-phenylephrine is increased due to less in risk and no new drugs withmajor the therapeutic benefits. The increased regulatory demands for optically pure drugs coupled with pressures to minimizethe environmental impacts of chemical processes makes enzyme-mediated processes logicalalternatives. In previous works, we have isolated two bacteria strains with capability to producephenylephrine from 1 -(3 -hydroxyphenyl) - 2 -(methylamino) ethanone (HPMAE). A ketonereductase gene was cloned from Rhodococcus erythcoplis and expressed in E. coli. We found that E. coli cells expressing ketone reductase gene can transform HPMAE to D-phenylephrine (> 99 ％e. e.). This is fisrt enzymatic process for phenylephrine to be reported. However, the productobtained is D-form which has to be converted to L-form product by Walden inversion. Morevoer,recombinant cell expressing Rhodococcus ketone reductase exhibited low catalytic activity, andonly 50. 6 ％ of conversion was obtained in a 8 -h incubation. Therefore, recombinant DNA andprotein engineering techniques will be included in our further studies to change theenantioselectivity of the Rhodococcus ketone reductase to allow the novel ketone reductase withhigh efficiency in the bioconversion of HPMAE to L-phenylephrine. The research work in thecoming three years is as followings:First grant year 1. Screen for microorganisms capable of converting HPMAE to L-phenylephrine. 2. Overexpression of Rhodococcus ketone reductase gene in E. coli and determine the effects ofculture conditions on the bioconversion. 3. Create a novel Rhodococcus ketone reductase with high catalytic activity using error-prone PCRtechnique and high-throughput screening method developed by our lab. 4. Determine the 3 -D structure of Rhodococcus ketone reductase (in collaboration with professorWen-ChingWang, Department of Life Science, National Tsing Hua University). 5. Cloning and overexpression of genes involved in the recycle of NADPH in the recombinantcells. Second grant year 1. To evaluate catalytic activity of ketone reductase and conversion of HPMAE to phenylephrineby the recombinant E. coli cells harboring NAD(P) H recycling genes. 2. Improvement of the catalytic activity and enantioselevtivity of Rhodococcus ketone reductaseby site-directed mutagenesis, based on the 3 -D structure of the enzyme. 3. To determine the relationship between sustrate structure and enantioselectivity. 4. Cloning and expression of ketone reductase gene with capability of converting HPMAE to L-phenylephrine. Third grant year 1. Expression of ketone reductase gene in the bacteria cells other than E. coli for the conversion ofHPMAE to L-phenylephrine. 2. Establishment of a whole cell process using enzyme variant with high enantioselectivity forL-phenylephrine production. 3. Optimization of whole cell process with respect to conversion yield and productivity (gL-phenylephrine / l·h). In three grant years, key residues involved in the catalytic activity and enantioselectivity ofketone reductase will be elucidated by our proposed reseach works. Moreover, processes for theproduction of L-phenylephrine using novel ketone reductase will be developed, which do notinfringe the patents in the world.
