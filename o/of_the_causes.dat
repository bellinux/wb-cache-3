5|$|Based on the {{analysis}} of rat and human urine by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, mephedrone {{is thought to be}} metabolised by three phase 1 pathways. It can be demethylated to the primary amine (producing compounds 2, 3 and 5), the ketone group can be reduced (producing 3) or the tolyl group can be oxidised (producing 6). Both 5 and 6 are thought to be further metabolised by conjugation to the glucuronide and sulfate derivatives. Knowledge of the primary routes of metabolism should allow the intake of mephedrone to be confirmed by drug tests, as well as more accurate determination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>causes</b> of side effects and potential for toxicity.|$|E

5|$|Lactulose and {{lactitol}} are disaccharides {{that are}} not absorbed from the digestive tract. They are thought to decrease the generation of ammonia by bacteria, render the ammonia inabsorbable by converting it to ammonium (NH4+) ions, and increase transit of bowel content through the gut. Doses of 15-30ml are administered three times a day; the result is aimed to be 3–5 soft stools a day, or (in some settings) a stool pH of <6.0. Lactulose may also be given by enema, especially if encephalopathy is severe. More commonly, phosphate enemas are used. This may relieve constipation, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>causes</b> of encephalopathy, and increase bowel transit.|$|E

On 12 October 2013, the British medical journal The Lancet published a peer-reviewed article by the Swiss experts about the analysis of the 38 samples of Arafat's clothes and belongings and 37 reference samples which were known to be polonium-free, suggesting that Arafat could have died of polonium poisoning.|$|E
5|$|Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>causes</b> of {{deliberate}} self-poisoning in Sri Lankan adolescents included bereavement and harsh discipline by parents.

Great potential for the reduction of self-harm lies in education and prevention, but limited resources {{in the developing world}} make these methods challenging.|$|E

5|$|Thomas Cranmer (2 July 1489 – 21 March 1556) was {{a leader}} of the English Reformation and Archbishop of Canterbury during the reigns of Henry VIII, Edward VI and, for a short time, Mary I.

5|$|Britain had {{remained}} neutral throughout the first {{stages of the}} war. Although unsympathetic to the violence and upheaval of the French Revolution, Britain's Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger was unwilling {{to go to war}} alongside the absolutist monarchies of Eastern Europe. Nevertheless, the Royal Navy had made extensive preparations for war should it occur, starting with the Spanish Armament of 1790. The French Atlantic Fleet however was in poor condition: the principal fleet base at Brest in Brittany had been the scene of a significant mutiny in 1790 and by 1791 desertion rates among French naval officers were running at more than 80%. Despite its strong republican politics and command difficulties, the fleet itself was very strong, having been expanded and improved during the 1780s – indeed the tax rises to pay for the French Navy had been one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>causes</b> of the original Revolution in 1789.|$|E

5|$|Given Huskisson's importance, and the {{potential}} impact {{on the future of}} Liverpool and Manchester's industries and on the embryonic railway industry of any findings of liability {{on the part of the}} railway, a swift determination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>causes</b> of the accident was considered essential. By 9.00am on the morning after the accident, a hastily convened coroner's jury was assembled in the Grapes public house in Eccles. The coroner himself, MrMilne, arrived at 10.00am and was in a hurry to proceed as he had another inquest scheduled that afternoon, but proceedings were unable to begin as Lord Wilton, the only sworn witness scheduled to attend the inquest, could not be found. In the meantime, Milne sent the jury to the vicarage to view Huskisson's body.|$|E
5|$|In 2006 {{there were}} {{believed}} to be 4,035 species of amphibians that depended on water at some stage during their life cycle. Of these, 1,356 (33.6%) were considered to be threatened and this figure is likely to be an underestimate because it excludes 1,427 species for which there was insufficient data to assess their status. A number of causes are believed to be involved, including habitat destruction and modification, over-exploitation, pollution, introduced species, climate change, endocrine-disrupting pollutants, destruction of the ozone layer (ultraviolet radiation has shown to be especially damaging to the skin, eyes, and eggs of amphibians), and diseases like chytridiomycosis. However, many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>causes</b> of amphibian declines are still poorly understood, and are a topic of ongoing discussion.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, a purported {{new species}} of Streptococcus, named S.shiloi, was {{identified}} as one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>causes</b> of an epidemic of meningoencephalitis (an inflammation {{of the brain and}} its surrounding membranes) affecting farmed rainbow trout and tilapia in Israel since 1986. Since S.shiloi was alpha-hemolytic, had a G+C% content of 37% and did not ferment sugar galactose, it was not classified as S.iniae, which is beta-hemolytic, has a G+C% content of 32%, and ferments galactose. In 1995, S.shiloi was found in fact to be beta-hemolytic, and after DNA-DNA hybridization techniques with the ATCC type S.iniae and recalculation of the G+C% content, was reclassified by the same group as a junior synonym of S.iniae.|$|E

The air battle aided the Syrians in concentrating their forces for the war, as the Israelis interpreted {{it to be a}} defensive reaction {{on the part of the}} Syrians. The Israelis closely monitored this buildup near the front, but their intelligence remained adamant that Syria would not go to war without Egypt, which the Israelis believed was currently occupied with internal issues.|$|E
5|$|People have {{struggled}} to live in deserts and the surrounding semi-arid lands for millennia. Nomads have moved their flocks and herds to wherever grazing is available and oases have provided opportunities for a more settled way of life. The cultivation of semi-arid regions encourages erosion of soil and is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>causes</b> of increased desertification. Desert farming is possible {{with the aid of}} irrigation and the Imperial Valley in California provides an example of how previously barren land can be made productive by the import of water from an outside source. Many trade routes have been forged across deserts, especially across the Sahara Desert, and traditionally were used by caravans of camels carrying salt, gold, ivory and other goods. Large numbers of slaves were also taken northwards across the Sahara. Some mineral extraction also takes place in deserts and the uninterrupted sunlight gives potential for the capture of large quantities of solar energy.|$|E
5|$|Regardless <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>causes</b> of the Breeders' hiatus, {{by early}} 1995 Deal {{believed}} her next album {{would be a}} solo one, and at first intended to play all instruments on it herself. Back {{at her home in}} Dayton, Ohio, she practiced the drums and initially prepared six songs for recording. Around the same time, she produced some tracks for Guided by Voices at Easley Studios in Memphis, Tennessee. While there, Deal used a portion of the studio time to record demos for some of her new songs. As an attempt to distract her sister from her drug problems, Deal recruited Kelley to play on three songs at this initial recording session. Kelley's involvement changed Deal's mind about playing all the instruments herself, and she began to conceptualize the album as a band project.|$|E
