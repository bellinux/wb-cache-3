5|$|Of the two {{theories}} on extratropical cyclone structure and life cycle, the older is the Norwegian Cyclone Model, developed during World War I. In this theory, cyclones develop {{as they move}} up and along a frontal boundary, eventually <b>occluding</b> and reaching a barotropically cold environment. It was developed completely from surface-based weather observations, including descriptions of clouds found near frontal boundaries. This theory still retains merit, {{as it is a}} good description for extratropical cyclones over continental landmasses.|$|E
5|$|Type I toxin-antitoxin systems {{rely on the}} base-pairing of {{complementary}} antitoxin RNA {{with the}} toxin's mRNA. Translation of the mRNA is then inhibited either by degradation via RNase III or by <b>occluding</b> the Shine-Dalgarno sequence or ribosome binding site. Often the toxin and antitoxin are encoded on opposite strands of DNA. The 5' or 3' overlapping region between the two genes is the area involved in complementary base-pairing, usually with between 19–23 contiguous base pairs.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectives: {{to assess}} the results of subintimal {{angioplasty}} of native vessels {{in the presence of}} an <b>occluded</b> vascular bypass graft. Design: retrospective case note review. Materials: twelve patients presenting with symptoms of lower limb ischaemia who had previously undergone infra-inguinal bypass surgery and in whom the bypass graft had <b>occluded.</b> These patients were treated by attempting subintimal angioplasty of the <b>occluded</b> native vessels. Results: there were seven technically successful procedures but after a median follow up of four weeks, only one case had persistent patency of the previously <b>occluded</b> segment. Conclusions: although subintimal angioplasty of <b>occluded</b> native vessels in the presence of an <b>occluded</b> bypass graft appears attractive, the results are disappointing...|$|R
5|$|When {{movement}} is required, one {{strategy is to}} minimise the motion signal, for example by avoiding waving limbs about and by choosing patterns that do not cause flicker when seen by the prey from straight ahead. Cuttlefish may be doing this with their active camouflage by choosing to form stripes {{at right angles to}} their front-back axis, minimising motion signals that would be given by <b>occluding</b> and displaying the pattern as they swim.|$|E
5|$|The {{depression}} {{moved to}} the east-northeast, and quickly strengthened into Tropical Storm Matthew. Operationally, Matthew fluctuated between tropical depression and tropical storm status, but in post-season analysis, the storm remained a tropical storm. The storm turned to the northeast while moving around the periphery of a high pressure system over Texas, and attained a peak intensity of 45mph (70km/h) on October 9. Strong wind shear limited further strengthening, and on October 10, Matthew struck Cocodrie, Louisiana as a minimal tropical storm. It became an extratropical cyclone, <b>occluding</b> near the time of landfall.|$|E

40|$|When {{grasping}} an object, subjects {{tend to look}} at {{the contact}} positions of the digits (A. M. Brouwer, V. H. Franz, D. Kerzel, & K. R. Gegenfurtner, 2005; R. S. Johansson, G. Westling, A. Bäckström, & J. R. Flanagan, 2001). However, these contact positions are not always visible due to occlusion. Subjects might look at <b>occluded</b> parts to determine the location of the contact positions based on extrapolated information. On the other hand, subjects might avoid looking at <b>occluded</b> parts since no object information can be gathered there. To find out where subjects fixate when grasping <b>occluded</b> objects, we let them grasp flat shapes with the index finger and thumb at predefined contact positions. Either the contact position of the thumb or the finger or both was <b>occluded.</b> In a control condition, a part of the object that does not involve the contact positions was <b>occluded.</b> The results showed that subjects did look at <b>occluded</b> object parts, suggesting that they used extrapolated object information for grasping. Additionally, they preferred to look {{in the direction of the}} index finger. When the contact position of the index finger was <b>occluded,</b> this tendency was inhibited. Thus, an <b>occluder</b> does not prevent fixations on <b>occluded</b> object parts, but it does affect fixation locations especially in conditions where the preferred fixation location is <b>occluded.</b> © ARVO...|$|R

Near total abolition of the residual shunt was achieved by initial implantation of an embolization coil within the duct <b>occluder</b> and subsequently an Amplatzer duct <b>occluder</b> (ADO II) adjacent to the duct <b>occluder.</b> This challenging case describes an additional technique of abolishing a large residual flow in and around a Nitinol duct <b>occluder</b> device...|$|R

A nasogastric tube {{may be necessary to}} continue feeding while treatment for the tumor is given, and some patients require a gastrostomy (feeding hole in the skin that gives direct access to the stomach).

When symptoms occur, such as in acute pancreatitis, a person may suffer from acute-onset, severe mid-abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. In severe cases, pancreatitis may lead to rapid blood loss and systemic inflammatory response syndrome. When the pancreas is unable to secrete digestive enzymes, such as with a pancreatic cancer <b>occluding</b> the pancreatic duct, result in jaundice. Pancreatic disease might be investigated using abdominal x-rays, MRCP or ERCP, CT scans, and through blood tests such as measurement of the amylase and lipase enzymes.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} shown that a cuff with a wider bladder occludes blood flow at a lower {{pressure}} level than a cuff with a narrower bladder. This may be related to more efficient pressure transmission to the deeper tissues with a wider cuff. Lower pressures, and associated lower pressure gradients, may reduce the risk of pressure-related injuries to the patient. Furthermore, Estebe et. al demonstrated that a wide tourniquet cuff is less painful than a narrow cuff if inflated at lower pressures and at these lower pressures it is still effective at <b>occluding</b> blood flow.|$|E

3000|$|The sparse {{coefficient}} histogram matrix can {{be established}} by concatenating the sparse coefficient vector ξi, i.e.,ρ =[ξ_ 1,ξ_ 2,..., ξ_N_p] [...]. If the target is partially <b>occluded,</b> then some of the patches of the target are <b>occluded,</b> and their corresponding sparse coefficients will be meaningless, which makes the sparse coefficient matrix ρ unable to express the candidate target well, causing big reconstruction error. Therefore, we introduce an <b>occluded</b> target detective mechanism to identify the <b>occluded</b> patches and their corresponding sparse coefficients.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel method for {{handling}} <b>occluded</b> pixels in stereo images {{based on a}} probabilistic voting framework that utilizes a novel support-and-decision process. Occlusion handling aims to assign a reasonable disparity value to <b>occluded</b> pixels in the disparity maps. In an initial step, disparities and their corresponding supports at the <b>occluded</b> pixels are calculated using a probabilistic voting method using the disparities at visible pixels. In this way, the visible pixel information is propagated when the disparities and support at the <b>occluded</b> pixels are computed. The final disparities for <b>occluded</b> pixels are then computed through an iterative support-and-decision process to propagate the information inside the <b>occluded</b> pixel region. An acceleration technique is also proposed to improve {{the performance of the}} iterative support-anddecision process. Experimental results show that the proposed occlusion handling method works well for several challenging stereo images...|$|R
25|$|Patients with solitary rectal ulcer {{syndrome}} {{combined with}} internal intussusception (as 94% of SRUS patients have) {{were shown to}} have altered rectal wall biomechanics {{compared to patients with}} internal intussusception alone. The presumed mechanism of the obstructed defecation is by telescoping of the intussusceptum, <b>occluding</b> the rectal lumen during attempted defecation. One study analysed resected rectal wall specimens in patients with obstructed defecation associated with rectal intussusception undergoing stapled trans-anal rectal resection. They reported abnormalities of the enteric nervous system and estrogen receptors. One study concluded that intussusception of the anterior rectal wall shares the same cause as rectocele, namely deficient recto-vaginal ligamentous support.|$|E

40|$|According to the Norwegian cyclone model, {{whether a}} warm-type or cold-type <b>occluded</b> front forms de-pends upon which {{cold air mass}} is colder: the prewarm-frontal air mass or the postcold-frontal air mass. For example, a cold-type {{occlusion}} is said to occur when the <b>occluded</b> front slopes rearward with height because the prewarm-frontal airmass is warmer than the postcold-frontal airmass. This temperature difference and the resulting occluded-frontal structure in the Norwegian cyclone model {{is part of what}} is called the temperature rule. Paradoxically, no clear example of a rearward-sloping, cold-type <b>occluded</b> front has been found in the literature, even though the required temperature difference has been documented in several cases. This article presents the first documented, rearward-sloping, cold-type <b>occluded</b> front. This <b>occluded</b> front forms in a cy-clone over the North Atlantic Ocean on 3 – 5 January 2003 and is documented in model output from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. Cross sections through the evolving cyclone show the <b>occluded</b> front forms as the less statically stable warm-frontal zone ascends over the more stable cold-frontal zone. Such a stability difference between the cold- and warm-frontal zones is consistent with a pre-viously published hypothesis that the less stable air is lifted by the more stable air to form <b>occluded</b> fronts, in disagreement with the temperature rule. Because warm-frontal zones and the cold air underneath tend to be more stable than cold-frontal zones and the postcold-frontal air, warm-type <b>occluded</b> fronts are much more common than cold-type <b>occluded</b> fronts, explaining why well-defined, rearward-sloping, cold-type <b>occluded</b> fronts are not common in the meteorological literature. 1...|$|R
40|$|The author {{reports on}} the {{visibility}} of spatial details located in those regions of a stereo pair which are seen by one eye only. In normal viewing, these regions correspond to areas of a scene which are <b>occluded</b> by nearer objects for one eye or the other-so called half <b>occluded</b> regions (or monocular regions). It is assumed that the resolving power of human vision in binocular regions would be higher than that in half <b>occluded</b> regions because {{of the effect of}} binocular summation. If it were true, high spatial frequency components in half <b>occluded</b> regions could be reduced without impairment of the subjective image quality. A comparison test of the visual resolving power for spatially low-pass filtered and non-filtered patterns in half <b>occluded</b> regions was carried out. The experiment showed, however, that any impairment visible in binocular regions was also visible in half <b>occluded</b> regions. Thus the assumption has been falsified and for the purpose of stereo image coding no irrelevant data elimination can be carried out in half <b>occluded</b> regions...|$|R
40|$|The {{completion}} of partly <b>occluded</b> objects appears instantaneous and effortless, but empirically takes measurable time. The current study investigates how amount of occlusion affects the time course and mechanisms of visual completion. Experiment 1 used a primed-matching paradigm to determine completion times for objects <b>occluded</b> by various amounts. Experiments 2 and 3 used a dot-localization paradigm to probe completed contour representations for a qualitative shift above some spatial limit. The results demonstrate {{that time to}} completion rises with amount of occlusion. Nonetheless, the visual system can complete highly <b>occluded</b> objects, even when the occlusion renders visible contours nonrelatable. Furthermore, prolonged completion times for highly <b>occluded</b> objects do not result from a breakdown of low-level interpolation processes: The same contour completion mechanism operates on objects <b>occluded</b> by different spatial extents. The perception of objects is critical to one’s interpretation of the world. However, many of the objects that a person perceives are not fully specified by visual information because those objects <b>occlude</b> parts of themselves or are <b>occluded</b> by neighboring ob-jects. Despite the pervasive nature of occlusion, difficulties i...|$|R
500|$|Based on his 1913 long-jawed reconstruction, Hooley {{found the}} beak of Istiodactylus {{similar to those}} of birds such as herons, storks, and skimmers, and {{suggested}} that Istiodactylus fed on fish, occasionally dipping in water in pursuit of prey. In 1991, the German palaeontologist Peter Wellnhofer compared the front ends of the jaws of Istiodactylus with those of a duck, while noting it was not a [...] "duck-billed pterosaur" [...] (as it has been popularly called), due to its strong teeth. He suggested that the alternately meshing teeth and the broad snout indicated a fish-eating animal. Howse and colleagues found that the distinctive teeth indicated a specialised diet or feeding technique, and instead suggested they could have been used to remove chunks of meat from prey or a carcass {{in the manner of a}} [...] "cookie cutter" [...] or by biting and twisting the skull. They also pointed out that the animal was known from continental beds, and may therefore have been a scavenger similar to vultures or marabou storks. In 2010, Attila Ősi agreed that Istiodactylus was able to cut meat in this way, but added that it would not have been able to process food with precisely <b>occluding</b> teeth.|$|E

40|$|SummaryWhen interfering objects <b>occlude</b> a scene, {{the visual}} system restores the <b>occluded</b> information.
