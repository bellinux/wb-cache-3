5|$|From the 1080s, the lordships of South Wales {{were held}} by a {{succession}} of Norman families inter-married with older Welsh houses loyal to the English throne, with many lordships also held by the English King in his own right. The process was completed in the 13th century when the north of Wales, as a principality, became a client state of the English kingdom, while Magna Carta began a process <b>of</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>the</b> English monarch's political powers.|$|E

5|$|The ESL {{is renowned}} for sonic {{transparency}} and very low distortion. Its midrange performance is usually described in superlative terms, common to other electrostatic designs. Its sound is tonally neutral, exceptionally spacious, and transient response very fast. A properly configured stereo pair would generate {{a very small}} 'sweet spot' where the sound stage snaps into focus. This led to criticisms of the speaker's directionality which in practice was rarely a problem and had the benefit <b>of</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>the</b> effects of room resonances.|$|E
5|$|The {{facility}} {{attempts to}} minimize its environmental impact through several mechanisms, including minimizing area usage. Energy consumption {{is reduced by}} using recirculating excess heat to melt snow and ice for drinking water and heating. Waste is minimized through purchase planning and recycling; the remaining waste is compressed and transported away from the Antarctic. Fuel is handled {{in such a way}} that even small spills are minimized. In 2016 a solar PV plant with 7.3 kilowatt peak has been installed on one of the roof tops. It serves as a pilot installation for the declared middle term target <b>of</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>the</b> oil consumption of the research station significantly, by extending the solar PV plant over the next few years.|$|E

5|$|When I assumed office, I {{found that}} my {{predecessor}} {{had signed a}} contract for {{the building of the}} battleship Rio de Janeiro, a vessel of 32,000tons, with an armament of 14 in. guns. Considerations of every kind pointed to the inconvenience of acquiring such a vessel and to the revision of the contract in the sense <b>of</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>the</b> tonnage. This was done, and we shall possess a powerful unit which will not be built on exaggerated lines such as have not as yet stood the time of experience.|$|E

With an eight-digit display, the calculator could display positive numbers between 0.0000001 and 99,999,999, and negative numbers between -0.000001 and -9,999,999. Calculators of the time tended to have displays of between 3 and 12 digits, as reducing the number of digits was an effective way <b>of</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>the</b> cost of the calculator. A number outside that range leads to an overflow, and the screen flashes and all keys except the clear key are rendered inoperable to inform the user of the error. A independent memory register could read information from the screen, and information could only be taken from the memory onto the screen. Five keys were used for memory operations.|$|E

5|$|By 1918, {{the number}} of front line {{infantry}} within the British Army in France had decreased, leading to a manpower crisis. In an attempt to consolidate manpower and to increase {{the number of}} machine guns and artillery support available to the infantry, the number of battalions in a division was cut from twelve to nine. This had the effect <b>of</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>the</b> establishment of a division from 18,825 men to 16,035. In addition, to ease reinforcement, an attempt was made to consolidate as many battalions from the same regiment within the same brigade. These changes impacted the division, resulting in the 15th RWF, 11th SWB and 10th and 16th Welsh being disbanded and the 2nd RWF joining from the 33rd Division. These changes to the division also saw the machine gun companies consolidated into a single battalion, one medium mortar battery broken up and absorbed by the remaining two batteries and the heavy mortar battery leaving the division to become a Corps asset.|$|E
5|$|Kirchner quickly {{expanded}} {{the activities and}} scope of his office, building a parallel state. This soon started a conflict with Puricelli. Instead of being fired, Kirchner resigned and accused the governor <b>of</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>the</b> funds for social-welfare. He ran for mayor of Río Gallegos in 1987, and won by the slim margin of 110 votes. Kirchner's friend, Rudy Ulloa Igor, helped him to victory by registering some groups of Chilean immigrants to vote (immigrants were allowed to vote in mayoral elections), and persuading them to vote for Kirchner. Julio de Vido and Carlos Zannini began working with Kirchner at this time. Kirchner used the state-owned media to promote his activities. The Peronist Ricardo del Val was elected governor that year, and the province was impacted by inflation in 1989. Kirchner became the main opponent of del Val, who was impeached and removed from office in 1990 due to the inflation crisis.|$|E
5|$|Low-altitude {{intercepts}} {{would also}} have the advantage <b>of</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>the</b> problem with nuclear blackout. The lower edge of an extended fireball used to induce nuclear blackout extended down to about 60km, {{the same as the}} altitude at which decluttering became effective. Hence, low-altitude intercepts meant that deliberate attempts to create a blackout would not affect the operation of the Sprint missile. Just as importantly, because the Sprint's own warheads would be going off far below this altitude, their fireballs would be much smaller and only black out {{a small portion of the}} sky. The radar would have to survive the electrical effects of EMP, and significant effort was expended on this. It also meant that the threat tube trajectories would have to be developed rapidly, before or between blackout periods. This demanded a very high-performance computer, one that did not exist at that time.|$|E

5|$|Military {{aircraft}} {{flying at}} night {{have often been}} painted black or other dark colors, applied to just the underside of some aircraft and to the entirety of others, in the hope <b>of</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>the</b> risk of being seen in enemy searchlights or by night fighters. However, aircraft camouflaged with black paint are actually darker than the night sky, making them more visible to observers not using searchlights. The undersides of Heinkel 111 night bombers were painted black. The De Havilland Mosquito was similarly initially painted black when used as a night fighter; matt black {{was found to be}} the best at reducing the aircraft's visibility against searchlights, but the aircraft's speed was reduced by 15mph (25kph) compared to glossy black, which, being smoother, produced less drag. Since, however, black camouflage made the planes conspicuous on moonlit nights and against cloud, a variation of a day camouflage scheme was eventually chosen.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before his}} {{election}} as the Yang-Di Pertuan Agong in 1983, {{a spate of}} reports alleging Sultan Iskandar's intention to launch a coup d'état by launching {{a state of emergency}} to overthrow the government circulated within political circles, which reached Mahathir himself. The Sultan was reportedly having fostered close relations with several key military personnel, including the Army chief himself. The government subsequently took action to curb constitutional loopholes within the constitution and took to task <b>of</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>the</b> power of royal veto in passing legislation, culminating to a constitutional crisis in late 1983. Nevertheless, during his inaugural speech as the Agong in 1984, about a month after the constitutional amendments were passed in parliament, Sultan Iskandar voiced public support for the revised constitution and pledged to act in accordance to the Prime Minister's advise.|$|E

Credible, evidence based educational campaigns in the mass media about the consequences of alcohol abuse have been recommended. Guidelines for parents to prevent alcohol abuse amongst adolescents, and for helping young people with mental health problems have also been suggested.|$|E
