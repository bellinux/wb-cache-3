5|$|Film noir {{encompasses}} {{a range of}} plots: the central figure may be a private investigator (The Big Sleep), a plainclothes policeman (The Big Heat), an aging boxer (The Set-Up), a hapless grifter (Night and the City), a law-abiding citizen lured into {{a life of crime}} (Gun Crazy), or simply a victim <b>of</b> <b>circumstance</b> (D.O.A.). Although film noir was originally associated with American productions, films now so described have been made around the world. Many pictures released from the 1960s onward share attributes with film noir of the classical period, and often treat its conventions self-referentially. Some refer to such latter-day works as neo-noir. The clichés of film noir have inspired parody since the mid-1940s.|$|E

5|$|In reality, the campaign's {{military}} {{impact on}} Byzantium was limited: outside the garrison and population of Amorium itself, the Byzantine field army at Anzen {{seems to have}} suffered few casualties, and the revolt of the Khurramite corps was suppressed without bloodshed {{the next year and}} its soldiers reintegrated into the Byzantine army. Ancyra was quickly rebuilt and reoccupied, as was Amorium itself, although it never recovered its former glory and the seat of the Anatolic theme was for a time transferred to Polybotus. According to the assessment of Warren Treadgold, the imperial army's defeats at Anzen and Amorium were to a large degree the result <b>of</b> <b>circumstance</b> rather than actual incapability or inadequacy. In addition, the Byzantine campaign had suffered from Theophilos's overconfidence, both in his willingness to divide his forces in the face of greater Arab numbers and in his over-reliance on the Khurramites. Nevertheless, the defeat prompted Theophilos to undertake a major reorganization of his army, which included the establishment of new frontier commands and the dispersing of the Khurramite troops among the native troops of the themes.|$|E
5|$|The Roman {{conquest of}} Wales began in AD 48 and took 30 years to complete. Roman rule lasted over 300 years. The campaigns of conquest {{are the most}} widely known feature of Wales during the Roman era, because of the spirited, but {{ultimately}} unsuccessful, defence of their homelands by two native tribes: the Silures and the Ordovices. Roman rule in Wales was a military occupation, save for the southern coastal region of south Wales, east of the Gower Peninsula, {{where there is a}} legacy of Romanisation. The only town in Wales founded by the Romans, Caerwent, is in south east Wales. Both Caerwent and Carmarthen, also in southern Wales, became Roman civitates. Wales had a rich mineral wealth. The Romans used their engineering technology to extract large amounts of gold, copper and lead, as well as modest amounts of some other metals such as zinc and silver. Roman economic development was concentrated in south-eastern Britain, and no significant industries located in Wales. This was largely a matter <b>of</b> <b>circumstance,</b> as Wales had none of the necessary materials in suitable combination, and the forested, mountainous countryside was not amenable to industrialisation. Although Latin became the official language of Wales, the people tended to continue to speak in Brythonic. While Romanisation was far from complete, the upper classes of Wales began to consider themselves Roman, particularly after the ruling of 212 that granted Roman citizenship to all free men throughout the Empire. Further Roman influence came through the spread of Christianity, which gained many followers when Christians were allowed to worship freely; state persecution ceased in the 4thcentury, as a result of Constantine I issuing an edict of toleration in 313.|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I explore an {{alternative}} formulation <b>of</b> the <b>circumstances</b> <b>of</b> justice. The <b>circumstances</b> <b>of</b> justice are {{the circumstances that}} make human cooperation necessary and possible, and because human cooperation is necessary to justice, they make justice both necessary and possible. For constructivists, principles of justice respond to these <b>circumstances.</b> Standard accounts <b>of</b> the <b>circumstances</b> <b>of</b> justice {{can be found in}} Hobbes, Hume, and Rawls, and many contemporary theorists rely on these accounts. My dissertation rejects these standard accounts <b>of</b> the <b>circumstances</b> <b>of</b> justice—on the grounds of exclusion and trust—and defends an alternative account. A core idea of my proposed alternative is that the <b>circumstances</b> <b>of</b> justice must be understood in terms of solidarity. A proper understanding of the role of solidarity in an adequate characterization <b>of</b> the <b>circumstances</b> <b>of</b> justice requires a good grasp of the nature of solidarity itself. To that end I offer a novel account of solidarity which I argue improves existing theories of solidarity. In {{the first part of this}} project I explain the role and importance <b>of</b> the <b>circumstances</b> <b>of</b> justice. I then offer a full description of solidarity and its normative character. In the second half of the project I offer my new account <b>of</b> the <b>circumstances</b> <b>of</b> justice, including an explanation and examples of how broad the scope of this reformulation is. I conclude the project by applying my new account <b>of</b> the <b>circumstances</b> <b>of</b> justice to the problem of climate change, and ask whether we can now construe the coordination of resources between generations as a problem of justice...|$|R

In The Ethics of Ambiguity, de Beauvoir confronts the existentialist dilemma of absolute freedom vs. the constraints <b>of</b> <b>circumstance.</b>|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is, first, to address three recent criticisms of Hume's account <b>of</b> the <b>circumstances</b> <b>of</b> justice, and secondly, to {{consider}} how an account <b>of</b> the <b>circumstances</b> <b>of</b> justice may be deployed in philosophical argument when detached from Hume's own narrow concern with rules of property. Against the criticisms lodged by Brian Barry and Martha Nussbaum, I argue that Hume does not build a conception of justice as mutual advantage into the <b>circumstances</b> <b>of</b> justice. Against the criticism lodged against modern invocations <b>of</b> the <b>circumstances</b> <b>of</b> justice by Gerry Cohen, I argue that any plausible account of deliberative reflection must be at once action-guiding and world-guided. This allows an account <b>of</b> the <b>circumstances</b> <b>of</b> justice-those features of the world no plausible theory of justice can idealize away-to do some justificatory work...|$|R

Thierno Abdourahmane Bah learned from his cousin: Grammar (nahaw), Law (fiqh), theology (Tawhid), as well as other specialties (Fannu, bayan, Tasrif, Maani).
