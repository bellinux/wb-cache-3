5|$|Bookends is {{a concept}} album that explores a life journey from {{childhood}} to old age. Side one of the album marks successive stages in life, the theme serving as bookends to the life cycle. Side two largely consists of unused material for The Graduate soundtrack. Simon's lyrics concern youth, disillusionment, relationships, <b>old</b> <b>age,</b> <b>and</b> mortality. Much of the material was crafted alongside producer John Simon, who joined the recording when Simon suffered from writer's block. The album was recorded gradually over the period of a year, with production speeding up around the later months of 1967.|$|E

5|$|Brennus {{spent the}} {{majority}} of her career in the Mediterranean Squadron, and she served as its flagship early in her career. In 1900, she accidentally rammed and sank the destroyer Framée. As newer battleships were commissioned into the fleet, Brennus was relegated to the Reserve Squadron in the early 1900s. By the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, her <b>old</b> <b>age</b> <b>and</b> poor condition prevented her from seeing action. She was ultimately stricken from the naval register in 1919 and sold for scrap three years later.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo's fame {{within his}} own {{lifetime}} was such that the King of France carried him away like a trophy, and was claimed to have supported him in his <b>old</b> <b>age</b> <b>and</b> held him in his arms as he died. Interest in Leonardo and his work has never diminished. Crowds still queue to see his best-known artworks, T-shirts still bear his most famous drawing, and writers continue to hail him as a genius while speculating about his private life, as well as about what one so intelligent actually believed in.|$|E
5|$|Most of the Germans {{responsible}} for {{the operation of the}} camp were captured and brought to trial. Several were extradited to Yugoslavia and executed. Camp commander Herbert Andorfer and his deputy Edgar Enge were arrested in the 1960s after many years of hiding. Both were given short prison sentences in West Germany and Austria, respectively, though Enge never served any time given his <b>old</b> <b>age</b> <b>and</b> poor health.|$|E
40|$|Our working years {{increasingly}} extend {{into the}} late 60 s and may soon include the 70 s for some people. Thus the question whether work stress has a cumulative effect in <b>older</b> <b>age,</b> <b>and</b> whether <b>older</b> employees are more vulnerable to certain sources of work stress, such as bullying in the work place, is becoming increasingly relevant. We review some of the mechanisms, which translate cumulative stress at work into ill health, particularly in <b>older</b> <b>age,</b> <b>and</b> summarise {{what is known about}} the effect of age-specific stress, taking age-related bullying as an example. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd...|$|R

5|$|O' Horten is a 2007 Norwegian {{language}} film {{directed by}} Bent Hamer. The film's title character Odd Horten is a habit-bound train driver, {{who is about}} to retire. On the day of his retirement he ends up in an unexpected situation, and is forced to reconsider his life. As in other films by Hamer, the themes are loneliness and <b>old</b> <b>age,</b> <b>and</b> the courage to take chances. O' Horten {{has been described as a}} film without a strong plot or a clear chronology.|$|E
5|$|A large, cranky sow {{escapes from}} its herd and attacks the Mistress after {{she tries to}} shoo {{it out of her}} garden. Lad charges between them and battles the sow, but with his <b>old</b> <b>age</b> <b>and</b> blunt fangs he struggles with the fight and is badly injured. Bruce and Wolf return from a forest romp in time to aid him, and the younger dogs are able to easily drive her off. While fleeing, the pig runs {{directly}} into the path of one of the Place's cars, driven by a car thief who is knocked unconscious. Lad's feelings are hurt by the battle being finished by the other dogs and the Mistress' holding him back from joining them at the end, but he quickly forgives her.|$|E
5|$|During {{the initial}} months on board, Vala Mal Doran (Claudia Black) {{repeatedly}} tries to seduce Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks). Daniel finally confronts Vala {{for what he}} believes to be her insincerity, teasing, and mocking of him. Vala's upset reaction makes Daniel realize the honesty of her feelings, and they share a passionate embrace. As the years pass, each team member attempts {{to deal with the}} isolation. General Landry develops a gardening hobby; Carter learns how to play the cello; Daniel continues the translation of Asgard information in the database and develops his relationship with Vala; and Cameron Mitchell (Ben Browder) and Teal'c (Christopher Judge) exercise and train while Mitchell is growing more frustrated and angry. After many years, General Landry succumbs to <b>old</b> <b>age</b> <b>and</b> dies.|$|E

5|$|Most of the Germans {{who were}} {{responsible}} for the operation of the camp were captured and brought to trial. Many of those who had been prominent German officials during the occupation of Serbia, including Turner, Fuchs and Meyszner, were extradited to Yugoslavia by the Allies after the war, where they were executed. Camp commander Andorfer managed to escape {{with the assistance of the}} Roman Catholic Church, which helped him flee to South America. He returned to Austria from Venezuela in the 1960s, and was subsequently apprehended and tried on the minor charge of being an accessory to murder—for which he was sentenced to two-and-a-half years imprisonment. Andorfer's deputy, Enge, was apprehended in the 1960s, and sentenced to one-and-a-half years imprisonment. His sentence was never carried out due to his <b>old</b> <b>age</b> <b>and</b> poor health. German guards suspected of executing Serbian prisoners were never tried, although they served as witnesses in several trials in West Germany.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} was further aggravated {{by the absence}} of a clear successor, made more pressing because of Nerva's <b>old</b> <b>age</b> <b>and</b> sickness. He had no natural children of his own and only distant relatives, who were unsuited for political office. A successor would have to be chosen from among the governors or generals in the Empire and it appears that, by 97, Nerva was considering to adopt Marcus Cornelius Nigrinus Curiatius Maternus, the powerful governor of Syria. This was covertly opposed by those who supported the more popular military commander Marcus Ulpius Traianus, commonly known as Trajan, a general of the armies at the German frontier.|$|E
