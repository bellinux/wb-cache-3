40|$|The growing {{emphasis}} on complexity concerns for <b>ontologies</b> has attracted significant interest {{from both the}} researcher's and the practitioner's communities in modularization techniques {{as a way to}} decrease the complexity of managing huge <b>ontologies.</b> On the other hand, it has been widely pointed out that classical <b>ontologies</b> are not appropriate to deal with imprecise and vague knowledge, which is inherent to several real world domains. In order to handle these types of knowledge, some fuzzy extensions of classical <b>ontologies</b> are presented, yielding fuzzy <b>ontologies.</b> In this paper, we integrate modular <b>ontologies</b> with fuzzy <b>ontologies,</b> i. e.; the notion of modular fuzzy <b>ontologies</b> is presented. Furthermore, we present an infrastructure for the representation of and reasoning with modular fuzzy <b>ontologies</b> based on distributed fuzzy description logics. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|One of {{the main}} hurdles towards a wide {{endorsement}} of <b>ontologies</b> is {{the high cost of}} constructing them. Reuse of existing <b>ontologies</b> offers a much cheaper alternative than building new ones from scratch, yet tools to support such reuse are still in their infancy. However, more <b>ontologies</b> are becoming available on the web, and online libraries for storing and indexing <b>ontologies</b> are increasing in number and demand. Search engines have also started to appear, to facilitate search and retrieval of online <b>ontologies.</b> This paper presents a fresh view on constructing <b>ontologies</b> automatically, by identifying, ranking, and merging fragments of online <b>ontologies...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. There is an {{increasing}} need to interconnect biomedical <b>ontologies.</b> We investigate a simple but promising approach to generate mappings between <b>ontologies</b> by reusing and composing existing mappings across intermediate <b>ontologies.</b> Such an approach is especially promising for highly interconnected <b>ontologies</b> {{such as in the}} life science domain. There may be many <b>ontologies</b> {{that can be used for}} composition so that the problem arises to find the most suitable ones providing the best results. We therefore propose measures and strategies to select the most promising intermediate <b>ontologies</b> for composition. Experimental results for matching anatomy <b>ontologies</b> demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches...|$|R

40|$|<b>Ontologies</b> {{are widely}} used in the {{biomedical}} community, which has built standard reference <b>ontologies</b> for various aspects of medicine. These projects have produced broad descriptions of the medical domain, resulting in large, complex <b>ontologies</b> which {{can be difficult to}} reuse as part of a focused application. We describe four <b>ontologies</b> which we developed to support intelligent reasoning about a particular medical sub-domain. We also describe how concepts in these <b>ontologies</b> can be aligned with standard reference <b>ontologies</b> to promote interoperability...|$|R
40|$|<b>Ontologies</b> {{have become}} an {{important}} tool for representing data in a structured manner.

In this thesis, we present a desktop version of SAMBO, a system for merging <b>ontologies</b> that are represented in the languages OWL and DAML+OIL. The system has been developed in the programming language JAVA with JDK (Java Development Kit) 1. 4. 2.

SAMBO provides a user-friendly graphical interface, which guides the user through the merging process...|$|R

40|$|<b>Ontologies</b> are {{important}} components of web-based applications. While the Web makes {{an increasing number}} of <b>ontologies</b> widely available for applications, how to discover <b>ontologies</b> in the Web becomes a more challenging issue. Existing approaches are mainly based on keywords and metadata information of <b>ontologies,</b> rather than semantic entailments of <b>ontologies.</b> In this paper, we present a Semantic Web engine, called ONTOSEARCH 2, which searches and queries Web <b>ontologies</b> by creating and storing a copy of <b>ontologies</b> in a tractable description logic. ONTOSEARCH 2 allows formal querying of its repository, including both the structures and instances of <b>ontologies,</b> using the SPARQL query language. Furthermore, this paper reports on preliminary, but encouraging, benchmark results which compare ONTOSEARCH 2 ’s response times on a number of queries with those of existing knowledge base management systems...|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- Within {{the last}} years, many <b>ontologies</b> are created and are {{accessible}} over the web. On the other hand, <b>ontologies</b> {{are used in}} many applications to explicit formalization of the conceptualization of the domain, but a given domain can be conceptualized through many different <b>ontologies.</b> Thus multiples <b>ontologies</b> connected by semantic relations emerge as a core question and became an essential issue of interoperability between distributed applications over the web. In this paper, we present a model and methodology for describing <b>ontologies</b> according to different levels of abstraction. The functional level contains generic <b>ontologies</b> and the domain level contains domain <b>ontologies.</b> The latter are described from the former by using a derivation process. The proposed formalism {{is based on an}} algebraic approach and it allows to capture the relations over different described <b>ontologies...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Ontologies</b> {{allow the}} {{abstract}} conceptualisation of domains, but a given domain can be conceptualised through many different <b>ontologies,</b> {{which can be}} problematic when <b>ontologies</b> are used to support knowledge sharing. We present a formal account of <b>ontologies</b> that is intended to support knowledge sharing through precise characterisations of relationships such as compatibility and refinement. We take an algebraic approach, in which <b>ontologies</b> are presented as logical theories. This allows us to characterise relations between <b>ontologies</b> as relations between their classes of models. A major result is cocompleteness of specifications, which supports merging of <b>ontologies</b> across shared sub-ontologies. 1 Introduction Over the last decade <b>ontologies</b> [...] - best characterised as explicit specifications of a conceptualisation of a domain [17] [...] - have become increasingly important {{in the design and}} development of knowledge based systems, and for knowledge representations generally.

Despite (i) the {{recognized}} benefits of using <b>ontologies</b> in semantic EAI initiatives, (ii) {{the benefits of}} using foundational <b>ontologies</b> for promoting meaning negotiation and common understanding, and (iii) {{the importance of the}} semantic integration issue in EAI area, foundational <b>ontologies</b> have not yet be-come widely adopted in EAI initiatives for dealing with semantic conflicts. This has led us to investigate, through a systematic review of the literature, the adop-tion of foundational <b>ontologies</b> in EAI initiatives, with the purpose of under-standing the current role of these <b>ontologies</b> in EAI and identifying gaps for fu-ture research, in which the potential benefits of such <b>ontologies</b> could be ex-plored.
