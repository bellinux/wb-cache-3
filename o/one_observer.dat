5|$|The {{destruction}} of timber continued onto the mainland, prompting <b>one</b> <b>observer</b> to remark that no usable trees were left standing between {{the mouths of}} the Waccasassa and Suwannee rivers. In Williston, nearly a dozen residences were destroyed, killing {{at least one person}} and injuring 15 more. Six prison inmates were killed by a falling tree on a farm near the town, and in total, about 13 people lost their lives in mainland Levy County. Damage throughout the county, including the Cedar Keys, was estimated at $450,000.|$|E
5|$|During 1936 the {{experimental}} system at Bawdsey was tested against {{a variety of}} simulated attacks, along with extensive development of interception theory carried out at RAF Biggin Hill. <b>One</b> <b>observer</b> was Hugh Dowding, initially {{as the director of}} research for the RAF, and later as the commander of RAF Fighter Command. Dowding noted that the CH stations provided so much information that operators had problems relaying it to the pilots, and the pilots had problems understanding it. He addressed this through the creation of what is today known as the Dowding system.|$|E

5|$|A {{wide variety}} of plant {{material}} is also consumed, including the fruit or berries of Ficus species, Leucopogon species, Exocarpos species, a cycad Macrozamia riedlei, a mistletoe Lysiana exocarpi, Astroloma humifusum, A.pinifolium, Myoporum insulare, Enchylaena tomentosa and Coprosma quadrifida. The grey currawong also eats berries of introduced plants such as Pyracantha angustifolia and P.fortuneana, and Cotoneaster species, and crops such as maize, apples, pears, quince, various stone fruit of the genus Prunus, grapes, tomato, passion flowers, and the nectar of gymea lily (Doryanthes excelsa). On Kangaroo Island, the grey currawong {{has been identified as}} the main vector for the spread of bridal creeper (Asparagus asparagoides). Boneseed (Chrysanthemoides monilifera subspecies monilifera), another invasive species readily dispersed in bird droppings, is also consumed by grey currawongs. In Tasmania, A.pinifolium is especially popular, and <b>one</b> <b>observer</b> noted that the normally noisy birds became quiet and sluggish after eating it, prompting him to wonder whether the plant had a narcotic effect on the birds.|$|E
5|$|For a {{fortunate}} few though fortunes {{could be}} won 'with a rapidity only equalled by the princely gains {{of some of}} the adventurers who accompanied Pizarro to Peru', noted <b>one</b> <b>observer.</b> Among the most notable success stories were the six sons of Coatbridge farmer Alexander Baird. The Baird family had become involved in coal mining but opened an iron foundry in order to exploit the new hot blast process of iron smelting invented by James Beaumont Neilson. The Baird's subsequently constructed numerous iron foundries in Coatbridge including the famous Gartsherrie iron works. The waste heap or 'bing' from the Baird's Gartsherrie works was said to be as large as the great pyramid in Egypt. One son, James Baird, was responsible for erecting sixteen blast-furnaces in Coatbridge between 1830 and 1842. Each of the six sons of Alexander Baird was reputed to have become a millionaire.|$|E

25|$|Suppose, for example, that <b>one</b> <b>observer</b> {{examines}} {{the properties of}} a hydrogen atom on Earth, the other—on the Moon (or any other place in the universe), the observer will find that their hydrogen atoms exhibit completely identical properties. Again, if <b>one</b> <b>observer</b> had examined a hydrogen atom today and the other—100 years ago (or {{any other time in}} the past or in the future), the two experiments would again produce completely identical results. The invariance of the properties of a hydrogen atom with respect to the time and place where these properties were investigated is called translation invariance.|$|E
25|$|When {{two people}} look at two {{different}} detectors that scan entangled particles, both observers will enter an indefinite state, as with <b>one</b> <b>observer.</b> These results need not agree – the second observer's mind {{does not have to}} have results that correlate with the first's. When <b>one</b> <b>observer</b> tells the results to the second observer, their two minds cannot communicate and thus will only interact with the other's body, which is still indefinite. When the second observer responds, its body will respond with whatever result agrees with the first observer's mind. This means that both observer's minds will be in a state of the wavefunction that always get the expected results, but individually their results could be different.|$|E

25|$|A {{defining}} {{feature of}} special relativity is {{the replacement of}} the Galilean transformations of Newtonian mechanics with the Lorentz transformations. Time and space cannot be defined separately from each other. Rather space and time are interwoven into a single continuum known as spacetime.

25|$|The {{time lapse}} between two events is not {{invariant}} from <b>one</b> <b>observer</b> to another, but {{is dependent on}} the relative speeds of the observers' reference frames (e.g., the twin paradox which concerns a twin who flies off in a spaceship traveling near the speed of light and returns to discover that his or her twin sibling has aged much more).|$|E
25|$|In some cases, {{the vacuum}} of <b>one</b> <b>observer</b> {{is not even}} in the space of quantum states of the other.

25|$|Some {{philosophers}} follow William of Ockham {{in holding}} that necessity and possibility are defined {{with respect to}} a given point in time and a given matrix of empirical circumstances, and so something that is merely possible from the perspective of <b>one</b> <b>observer</b> may be necessary from the perspective of an omniscient. Some philosophers follow Philo of Alexandria, a philosopher known for his homocentrism, in holding that free will is a feature of a human's soul, and thus that non-human animals lack free will.|$|E
25|$|Any {{principle}} of relativity prescribes a symmetry in natural law: that is, the laws must {{look the same}} to <b>one</b> <b>observer</b> as they do to another. According to a theoretical result called Noether's theorem, any such symmetry will also imply a conservation law alongside. For example, if two observers at different times see the same laws, then a quantity called energy will be conserved. In this light, relativity principles make testable predictions about how nature behaves, and are not just statements about how scientists should write laws.|$|E
