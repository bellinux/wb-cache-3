5|$|In spring 1243, an {{uprising}} ousted Vladislav; Stefan Uroš I, his third brother, {{was put on}} the throne. Scholars have argued that Bulgarian influence had been strong and unpopular, causing <b>opposition</b> <b>that</b> led to Vladislav's deposition after the death of Asen. If he had been alive, Asen might have prevented the coup.|$|E
5|$|The heavy <b>opposition</b> <b>that</b> was {{expected}} never materialized, so the landing forces moved inland rapidly. As fire support from Texass guns {{was no longer}} required, she departed the southern coast of France on the early morning of 17 August. After a stop at Palermo, Sicily, she left the Mediterranean and headed for New York where she arrived on 14 September 1944.|$|E
5|$|To face an <b>opposition</b> <b>that</b> was {{becoming}} uncooperative {{was not what}} Playford has expected, or could satisfactorily handle. Before the effect Dunstan had on Parliament, Playford would meet with Labor leaders to discuss bills, and ensure bipartisan support in the House of Assembly for them; there was little discordance on matters. The belligerents were previously only rural independent members.|$|E

5|$|Inspired by the {{regional}} Arab Spring, Bahrain's Shia majority started large protests against its Sunni rulers in early 2011. The government initially allowed protests following a pre-dawn raid on protesters camped in Pearl Roundabout. A month later it requested security assistance from Saudi Arabia and other GCC countries and declared a three-month state of emergency. The government then launched {{a crackdown on}} the <b>opposition</b> <b>that</b> included conducting thousands of arrests and systematic torture. Almost daily clashes between protesters and security forces led to dozens of deaths. Protests, sometimes staged by opposition parties, were ongoing. More than 80 civilians and 13 policemen have been killed as of March 2014.|$|E
5|$|In Australia, however, {{public opinion}} about the matter was divided with many Australians opposed to the issue on moral grounds, feeling that the {{situation}} was not desperate enough to require such a drastic measure, while others felt it {{necessary in order to}} achieve final victory. The Hughes Labor government decided to hold a plebiscite on the matter and on 28 October 1916 the matter was decided by a narrow margin of 51 per cent to 49 per cent, with the no vote prevailing. Despite the result, the issue split the Labor Party and the pro-conscription prime minister, Billy Hughes, ultimately left the party and joined with members of the <b>opposition</b> <b>that</b> supported conscription to form a new party, known as the Nationalist Party.|$|E

5|$|Aside from non-military {{problems}} facing the junta, it also came into conflict with the Americans over political strategy, most notably as to whether armed force or politics should {{be the focus of}} efforts to end the communist threat to South Vietnam. Minh, the leading generals and Tho, favored a politically oriented solution, feeling that the deposal of Diệm and Nhu had created new possibilities for ending the insurgency of the National Liberation Front, or Viet Cong, mainly through an outreach program. They thought that military force would not be sufficient for Saigon, and that political means were more effective than using American firepower in making up for this. To the junta leaders, the rapid growth of the insurgency in Diệm's final year was due to it being seen as a rallying point and symbol of opposition to Diệm and Nhu, rather than an endorsement of the communists. The senior junta generals believed that with the Ngô brothers dead, the insurgency was now without its major focus of opposition, and therefore, motivation to operate in a vigorous way. To them, most of the insurgents were non-communist, with heavy elements of Cao Đài and Hòa Hảo religious sects or other <b>opposition</b> <b>that</b> had joined because of passionate anti-Diệm sentiment. Minh thus saw the post-Diệm period as an opportunity for grassroots political strengthening to undercut the NLF support base and force the remainder to integrate into mainstream society due to political realities.|$|E
5|$|In 1640 Charles {{attempted}} {{again to}} enforce his authority, opening a second Bishops' War. He recalled the English Parliament, {{known as the}} Short Parliament, but disbanded it after it declined to vote a new subsidy and was critical of his policies. He assembled a poorly provisioned and poorly trained army. The Scots moved south into England, forcing a crossing of the Tyne at Newburn {{to the west of}} Newcastle-upon-Tyne, then occupying the city and eventually most of Northumbria and Durham. This gave them a stranglehold on the vital coal supply to London. Charles was forced to capitulate, agreeing to most of the Covenanter's demands and paying them £830 a month to support their army. This forced him to recall the English Parliament, known as the Long Parliament, which, in exchange for concessions, raised the sum of £200,000 to be paid to the Scots under the Treaty of Ripon. The Scots army returned home triumphant. The king's attempts to raise a force in Ireland to invade Scotland from the west prompted a widespread revolt there and as the English moved to outright <b>opposition</b> <b>that</b> resulted in the outbreak of the English Civil War in 1642, he was facing rebellion in all three of his realms.|$|E
