During the ministry of Clement Attlee, British India became the two independent dominions <b>of</b> <b>India</b> <b>and</b> Pakistan in 1947. George relinquished the title of Emperor <b>of</b> <b>India,</b> <b>and</b> became King <b>of</b> <b>India</b> <b>and</b> King of Pakistan instead. In 1950 he ceased to be King of India when it became a republic within the Commonwealth of Nations and recognised his new title of Head of the Commonwealth; he remained King of Pakistan until his death. Other countries left the Commonwealth, such as Burma in January 1948, Palestine (divided between Israel and the Arab states) in May 1948 and the Republic of Ireland in 1949.|$|E
