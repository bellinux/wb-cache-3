60|$|Now, many {{answers are}} {{being given to}} that {{question}} at the present time. We may take as the extremest opposite to the eternal marriage idea the proposal of Mr. Bernard Shaw, that marriage should be terminable at the instance of either party. You would give due and public notice that your marriage was at an end, {{and it would be}} at an end. This is marriage at its minimum, as the eternal indissoluble marriage is marriage at its maximum, and the only conceivable next step would be to have a marriage makeable by the <b>oral</b> <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> both parties and terminable by the <b>oral</b> <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> either, which would be, indeed, no marriage at all, but an encounter. You might marry a dozen times in that way in a day.... Somewhere between these extremes lies the marriage law of a civilised state. Let us, rather than working down from the eternal marriage of the religious idealists, work up from Mr. Shaw. The former course is, perhaps, inevitable for the legislator, but the latter is much more convenient for our discussion.|$|R
40|$|A notion <b>of</b> {{the implied}} <b>declarations</b> <b>of</b> <b>will</b> is still {{controversial}} {{in the current}} statements of legal doctrine. Therefore an attempt at construction of the reporting {{definition of the term}} seems worthwhile. Interpretation of the sec. 60 of the Civil Code allows to reach a conclusion that the explicit and implied <b>declarations</b> <b>of</b> <b>will</b> cannot be distinguished on the grounds of this regulation. On the other hand, several various concepts <b>of</b> the <b>declarations</b> issued per facta concludentia are presented in the legal science. Opting for anyone of those is of no importance. One can agree that defining implied declarations one way or another is primarily a matter of convention. The above statement however, should not result in renouncing the defined term. It is the author's opiniono that a <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>will</b> can be understood as the implied one if it is issued with a use of sign which aquires its significance only in a defined situational context. A detail interpretation of wording of the sec. 60 of the c. c: "with a reservation of exceptions provided in the Act" is necessary to verify a statement that the cited rule does not allow to differentiate between the implied and explicit <b>declarations</b> <b>of</b> <b>will.</b> Contrary to the common opinion, that phrase, as it seems, cannot be identified with a requirement <b>of</b> keeping <b>declarations</b> <b>of</b> <b>will</b> in a form prascribqd by law.

40|$|The Polish Civil Code (sec. 64) and the Polish Code of Civil Law Procedure {{provide the}} special rules {{in a case}} when one person refuses to make a <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>will.</b> These rules, however, apply mostly to the cases When there have already been an {{obligation}} between the parties to make such declaration. The following typical situations can be distinguished in transfer of land property transactions: 1) a preliminary contract of sale (a donation or another type of contract is not excluded), obliging both parties to concludes specific contract in the future, 2) a final contract of sale of land (or another type of contract) which does not transfer ownership {{of it to the}} buyer. It is however necessary for the both parties to make their final declarations to transfer ownership (sec. 157 § 2 c. c), 3) the obligation arising from another source than a contractual one, i. e. an unjust enrichement, legacy, erection of a building on land by an owner-like possessor etc., 4) revoking of a donation by the donor. In order to transfer ownership of land in those situations, a legal act have to be drawn by the public notary tin a solemn form (a deed). If any party refuses to participate in the legal transaction- the law permits to have its <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>Will</b> replaced by a decision of a court. The party who wants the transfer of land property to be effected may lay an action against the other party. It is a duty of a court in the legal proceedings to establish the existence of the forementioned Obligation to make a <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>will.</b> The final judgement replaces the <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>will</b> <b>of</b> the defendant (sec. 84 c. c, sec. 1047 c. c. l. p.). The author argues that in the transfer of land property, this judgement should generally take place <b>of</b> the <b>declarations</b> <b>of</b> <b>will</b> <b>of</b> both parties (i. e. plaintiff's and defendant's). That solution has the advantage of being the moist suitable in the practice. With the final judgement both parties get the surogate of a deed drawn by a public notary. The transfer of land property is usually effected {{as a result of that}} judgement. In some cases, however, the additional registration of the judgement in the land registry is required.

40|$|According to Family and Guardianship Code (F. G. C.), {{adoption}} is realized {{by means of}} guardianship count decision on demand of am adopter. Unless it is otherwise provided by law, consent of specified persons is indispensable for adoption i. e. : consent of an adoptee when he turned thirteen, consent of his parents, of a guardian or an adopter's spouse if both spouses are not adopting jointly. The consent of 'the said persons as an element of adoption's effectuation {{is characterized by the}} fact that it is not creating the relationship of adoption but consists one of the premises of admissibility of deciding adoption by court. There are numerous question open to discussion related to the consent to adoption as a material premise of an adoption decision. One of those of a general impact for the whole institution of consent to adoption as well as related to the consent's positioning in a construction of adoption's realization is discussed in the article. It is a question of establishing legal character <b>of</b> a <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> consent to adoption. That issue has not yet been satisfactirily clarified in the doctrine and jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. Particularly, the commonly adopted treatment of the consent as a <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>will</b> (legal (transaction) in the understanding of Civil Code (C. C.) must raiseobjections. That view can be /traced to a psychological concept <b>of</b> <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>will</b> according to which the <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>will</b> means as much as manifesting an intention to cause legal consequences. The reason for doubts lies in the nature of;legal transaction an indispensable element of which is a <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> will; the fürst is considered to be a (particular element of civil daw system provided for the legal subjects to form independently binding legal relations. Whereas no results turning into a change of previous legal situation of -the subjects are observed with making a statement of consent to adoption. Consequently it can be advocated that the institution <b>of</b> legal transaction (<b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>will)</b> is not applicable in the system of adoption instituted judicially and admitted by F. G. C, for the reason of inadequacy of its function to the statutorily set role <b>of</b> a <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> consent to adoption. The appraisal <b>of</b> a <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> consent in the light of the newer concept <b>of</b> <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>will</b> as a normative statement instituting an individual norm of behavior is positively speaiking against considering the consent to adoption to be a <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>will.</b> Referring to the theory of conventional acts, which generated the aforementioned concept, it can be maintained that a sense <b>of</b> <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> consent to adoption as a conventional act of legal consequence consists entirely in creating a situation in which a formerly laid down norm becomes applicable ana duties of court in a shape of an adequate reaction to that act would actualize thenselves. The results of study of the C. C. regulation of legal transactions to solve quétions related to consent to adoption prove that it is of little avail what is ia ::onsequence speaking for differentiating consent to adoption from legal transactions. The article focuses on such controvertible questions as application of C. C. provisions to the consent to adoption i. e. defects in a <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>will,</b> consent <b>of</b> -the third party, statutory representation. It can be inferred that, irrespective of its features, a <b>déclaration</b> <b>of</b> consent to adoption evades the C. C. regulation of legal transactions. The authoress advocates that upon a legai qualification <b>of</b> <b>declarations</b> <b>of</b> consent to adoption, one ought to refer to a type of acts in the family law, already distinguished in the doctrine and based on general premises of family law. (Particular features of family relations are taken account of in those acts as. veil as a specific regulation of acts concerning those relations including consent to adoption and departing from the civil law constructions can find its explanation there.

As a result Mexico’s northern border zone or “la frontera norte” has been an important contributor to Mexican growth. The six Mexican states that border the US capture a large and relatively prosperous part of Mexico. By 2013 the six states contained 17  % of Mexico’s population and produced 22.5  % of its GDP.

40|$|U radu se razmatraju pravna sredstva za pobijanje nevaljanih pravnih poslova. Prikazuje se razlika između pravnih poredaka u kojima se pobojne pravne poslove poništava sudskim putem u odnosu na one u kojima se pobijanje provodi jednostranim očitovanjem volje. Na temelju tog prikaza analizira se hrvatsko obvezno pravo, preciznije odredbe Zakona o obveznim odnosima, ali i drugih propisa koji uređuju pobijanje nevaljanih pravnih poslova. Također se upućuje na razliku prema pobijanju pravnih poslova koji su valjani, ali ih se pobija zbog oštećenja vjerovnika (tzv. paulijanske tužbe). Different {{legal systems}} solve {{problems}} of invalid legal transactions in different ways. Differences are particularly emphasized {{in respect of}} so-called avoidable legal transactions. In some legal systems of continental Europe such legal transactions are avoided on the basis <b>of</b> a unilateral <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>will</b> <b>of</b> one contracting parties. In the words of German legal terminology it is Gestaltungsrecht. On the other hand there are legal systems in which invalid legal transactions are avoided by a decision of the court. In such cases, if one party wants to avoid an invalid legal transaction {{it is necessary to}} initiate proceedings before a court. In Croatian law it is generally assumed that avoidance of invalid legal transactions occurs {{on the basis of a}} court decision. Thus, it is necessary to initiate proceedings to avoid such legal transactions. This approach is questionable for several reasons. Unlike the legal regime of fraudulent conveyance that explicitly provides that in order to avoid a legal transaction a lawsuit must be filed in court, the legal regime of invalid legal transaction is silent in this respect. Furthermore, avoidance of invalid legal transactions in its essence is much closer to idea of avoidance on the basis <b>of</b> a unilateral <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>will.</b> However, there are arguments in favour of the mainstream approach, meaning that avoidance must be conducted within proceedings before a court, such as for example grammatical interpretation of the law. Therefore, it would be helpful if law were to be amended in order to clear up this ambiguity in Croatian law. There was an opportunity to do this when the Croatian law of obligations was amended in 2006, and it is unfortunate that the opportunity was missed, because it is not very likely that another one will rise in the near future...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a concept to achieve non-repudiation for natural language conversations by electronically signing continuous, packet-based, digital voice communication (VoIP). Signing a VoIP-based conversation means {{to protect the}} integrity and authenticity of the bidirectional data stream and its temporal sequence which together establish the security context of the communication. The solution is based on chains of hashes and continuously chained electronic signatures. The protection is provided continuously during the ongoing conversations, they are not processed at once like traditional digital documents which could be trivially signed. A possible implementation and necessary protocols are described to apply these concepts to SIP/RTP-based VoIP-communication. This provides {{a high level of}} inherent security and enables PKI-based non-reputable signatures over voice as true <b>declarations</b> <b>of</b> <b>will,</b> without additional witnesses and in principle between unacquainted speakers.
