5|$|The loyalist force {{marched to}} the Hippodrome, where they drove away most of John's supporters. They then entered the palace, where they found scarce {{opposition}} from John's attendants. John was captured after a short chase in the palace and his head was immediately cut <b>off,</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> displayed {{the next morning at}} the Forum of Constantine, while his body was displayed at Blachernae. A similar fate befell many of his supporters that night, while others were captured and tortured to extract the names of all the conspirators. Alexios Mourtzouphlos was likely put in prison for his role in this affair (he is known to have been in prison in 1203), and the two Komnenos brothers, Alexios and David, seem to have fled the capital immediately after the coup's failure.|$|E
5|$|Whilst Valiant {{was under}} construction, Westwood, Baillie went {{bankrupt}} in November 1861 and their shipyard {{was taken over}} by the Thames Ironworks. This delayed her launching by {{about a year and a}} shortage of muzzle-loading guns delayed her completion by nearly five years. Hector, in contrast, served with the Channel Fleet from commissioning until 1867, when she was paid <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> re-armed and to refit. She formed part of the Southern Reserve Fleet between 1868 until 1886 much like Valiants service as the First Reserve guard ship in Southern Ireland after her commissioning, where she remained until 1885. Both ships did little of significance until they were assigned to the Particular Service Squadron, commanded by Admiral Geoffrey Hornby, from June to August 1878 during the Russian war scare during the Russo-Turkish War.|$|E
5|$|After {{the success}} of the three-episode Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons, the {{developers}} of the game, including programmers John Carmack and John Romero, designer Tom Hall, and artist Adrian Carmack, left their jobs at Softdisk to found id Software. After making a prototype game in Dreams to develop new ideas such as gameplay changes, graphical enhancements like parallax scrolling, and artistic improvements, the team worked on making a sequel trilogy of episodes from June to December 1991. During development the last episode was split <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> released as a stand-alone game due to a deal made by id's new president, Mark Rein, with the remaining two episodes produced as a pair titled Commander Keen in Goodbye, Galaxy instead. Aliens, despite being released as the sixth main episode in the series, was developed before the fifth. It did not sell as well as the first trilogy, which was attributed by id to poor marketing and its awkward status as a stand-alone retail game in a series known for groups of shareware episodes. Although another Keen game was planned, during development id Software began work on Wolfenstein 3D, and its success, along with the development of Doom, led id to not develop any further Keen games.|$|E

5|$|From Ancyra, the Abbasid army {{turned to}} Amorium, {{to which they}} laid siege on 1 August. Al-Afshin, Itakh, and Ashinas all took turns assaulting the city with their troops, but the siege was {{fiercely}} contested, even after the Abbasids, informed by a defector, effected a breach in a weak spot of the wall. After two weeks, however, {{taking advantage of a}} short truce for negotiations requested by one of the Byzantine commanders of the breach, the Abbasid army stormed the city. The city was thoroughly plundered and its walls razed, while the populace, numbering into the tens of thousands, was carried <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sold into slavery. According to al-Tabari, al-Mu'tasim now pondered extending his campaign to attack Constantinople, when the conspiracy headed by his nephew, al-Abbas, was uncovered. Al-Mu'tasim was forced to cut short his campaign and return quickly to his realm, without bothering with Theophilos and his forces, encamped in nearby Dorylaion. Taking the direct route from Amorium to the Cilician Gates, both the caliph's army and its prisoners suffered in the march through the arid countryside of central Anatolia. Some captives were so exhausted that they could not move and were executed, whereupon others found the opportunity to escape. In retaliation, al-Mu'tasim, after separating the most prominent among them, executed the rest, some 6,000 in number.|$|E
5|$|HMS Hector {{was laid}} down on 8 March 1861 by Robert Napier and Sons in Govan. She was {{launched}} on 26 September 1861, completed in January 1862, and commissioned on 22 February 1864. She cost £294,000 to build, including a payment of £35,000 to her builders who had underestimated their costs. She {{served with the}} Channel Fleet until 1867, when she was paid <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> re-armed and to refit. She formed part of the Southern Reserve Fleet between 1868 until 1886; during this time her only military activity occurred when she was detailed to service in the Particular Service Squadron {{under the command of}} Admiral Hornsby during the Russian war scare of June to August, 1878. Hector was assigned as Queen Victoria's guard ship nearly every summer during this period when the Queen, and her family, were in residence in Osborne House on the Isle of Wight. She was paid off at Portsmouth in 1886 and remained there, partly dismantled, until 1900 when she briefly became part of the torpedo school HMS Vernon as a store hulk. Hector became the first British warship to have wireless telegraphy installed when she conducted the first trials of the new equipment for the Royal Navy. The ship was sold for scrap in 1905.|$|E
5|$|Standish {{called all}} of the Wessagusset colonists into the stockade for defense. The {{following}} day, several natives including the local chief, Pecksuot, were at Wessagusset. Historical sources give different accounts of the killings. In some manner, four of the natives, including the local chief, {{were in the same}} room as Standish and several of his men. One source, from the 1880s, suggests that it was the natives that arranged to be alone with Standish to allow them to attack the colonist. Others sources state that it was Standish who had invited the natives into the situation on peaceful pretenses. When four of them, including the local chief, were in a room within the village, Standish gave the order to strike, quickly killing Pecksuot with his own knife. Several other natives in the village were attacked next; only one escaped to raise the alarm. As many as five Englishmen were also killed in the brief battle and one native's head was cut <b>off,</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> displayed in Plymouth as a warning to others.|$|E

25|$|Since the 1950s, {{commercial}} {{farming methods}} have been applied to the mopane worm harvests, particularly in South Africa.

25|$|The Andes {{also provide}} a ready source of {{irrigation}} which was historically done in flood plain style. Chilean vineyard owners would dig canals throughout their vineyards and then flood the entire surface area with water allowing some to seep {{into the ground and}} the run <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> funnel away through the canals. This encouraged excessive irrigation and high yields which had a negative effect on quality. During the wine renaissance of the 1980s & 1990s more vineyards converted to drip irrigation system which allowed greater control and helped reduce yields. The soil composition of Chile's vineyards varies from the clay dominated landscapes of Colchagua, which is thus heavily planted with the clay-loving Merlot, to the mixture of loam, limestone and sand found in other regions. In the southern Rapel and parts of Maule, tuffeau soil is present with volcanic soil being found in parts of Curico and Bio-Bio.|$|E
25|$|A {{domestic}} abuse case tests Malick's temper. Suspecting an injured husband of beating his wife, Malick switches his pain-relieving morphine for saline {{to increase his}} suffering. When Penny is killed in a train crash, her brother Oliver (James Anderson) confides in Malick {{that he is not}} a qualified doctor, as he switched his own exam paper with Penny's while they were at university. Malick dissuades Oliver from confessing to Hanssen, and agrees to keep his secret. Hanssen transfers Malick from the AAU to Keller, the hospital's general surgery ward. There, he attempts to ingratiate himself with consultant Ric Griffin (Hugh Quarshie), but discord arises between the two when Ric insinuates that Malick performed a hysterectomy on a drug-addicted mother out of spite rather than medical necessity. Malick also comes into conflict with orthopaedic surgeon Dan Hamilton (Adam Astill) over treatment of a patient, which intensifies when he discovers that Dan has been illegally providing an old friend with steroids.
