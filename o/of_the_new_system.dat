In August {{of the following}} year, the company {{struck a deal with}} IBM to develop a separate operating system called OS/2. Although the two companies successfully developed the first version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>system,</b> the partnership deteriorated due to mounting creative differences.|$|E
5|$|The {{motivation}} {{for the development of}} the SI was the diversity of units that had sprung up within the CGS systems and the lack of coordination between the various disciplines that used them. The CGPM, which was established by the Metre Convention of 1875, brought together many international organisations to not only agree on the definitions and standards <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>system</b> but also agree on the rules for writing and presenting measurements in a standardised manner around the world.|$|E
5|$|To unify all weight systems used by apothecaries, the Irish pharmacopœia of 1850 {{introduced}} a new variant of the apothecaries' system which subdivided a new apothecaries' pound of 12 avoirdupois ounces instead of the troy pound. To allow effective use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>system,</b> new weight pieces were produced. Since an avoirdupois ounce corresponds to 28.35g, the proposed system was {{very similar to that}} in use in Portugal and Spain, and in some locations in Italy. But it would have doubled the value of the avoirdupois drachm (an existing unit, but by then only used for weighing silk). Therefore, it conflicted with other non-standard variations that were based on that nearly obsolete unit.|$|E

5|$|The Dungeons & Dragons Basic Set, {{released}} in 1977, was an introductory {{version of the}} original D geared towards new players and edited by J. Eric Holmes. But in the same year, TSR Hobbies released a completely new and complex version of D, Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD). The Monster Manual, released later that year, became the first supplemental rule book <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>system,</b> and many more followed. The AD rules were not fully compatible {{with those of the}} D Basic Set and as a result, D and AD became distinct product lines. Splitting the game lines created a further rift between Gygax and Arneson; although Arneson received a 10% royalty on sales of all D products, Gygax refused to pay him royalties on AD books, claiming it was a new and different property. In 1979, Arneson filed a lawsuit against TSR; it was eventually settled in March 1981 with the agreement that Arneson would receive a 2.5% royalty on all AD products, giving him a very comfortable six-figure annual income for the next decade.|$|E
5|$|The new European Norm EN144-3:2003 {{introduced}} {{a new type of}} valve, similar to existing 232 bar or 300 bar DIN valves, however, with a metric M26×2 fitting on both the cylinder and the regulator. These are intended to be used for breathing gas with oxygen content above that normally found in natural air in the Earth's atmosphere (i.e. 22–100%). From August 2008, these were required in the European Union for all diving equipment used with nitrox or pure oxygen. The idea behind this new standard is to prevent a rich mixture being filled to a cylinder that is not oxygen clean. However even with use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>system</b> there still remains nothing except human procedural care to ensure that a cylinder with a new valve remains oxygen-clean - which is exactly how the previous system worked.|$|E
