The authors sampled undergraduate students (N = 753, M = 18. 97 years, SD = 2. 11 years) from a Northern California university. In hierarchical regression analyses, higher perceived quality of relationships with <b>older</b> adult family members, higher perceived social support, and lower perceived conflict from relationships with <b>older</b> adults {{was significantly associated with}} positive attitudes toward <b>older</b> adults. Interest in working with <b>older</b> adults was significantly associated with taking courses in aging, providing care to an <b>older</b> adult, and volunteering with <b>older</b> adults. These results suggest that positive relationships with <b>older</b> adults are useful in reducing biases, though student interactions with <b>older</b> adults are key in helping to promote interest in working with <b>older</b> adults...|$|R

He also condemned the governance of Presbyterian missionaries by anyone other than the Presbyterian church.

The New School resented Breckinridge and those who signed the Act and Testimony, and even some in the <b>Old</b> School camp had hoped for a more moderate course. The differences between the <b>Old</b> and New Schools widened over the teachings of Albert Barnes, and the New School members were ejected from the Presbyterian Church in 1837.

The <b>Old</b> Bridge improvements include adding inside shoulders and widening County Routes 516 and 527. A signalized ramp is to be added for access to County Routes 516 and 527. Subsequently, County Route 516's intersection with <b>Old</b> Matawan Road is to be relocated. The project would cost over $28 million and was slated to begin in 2009 and to end in 2010. As of the end of 2009 the large project was put on hold because of the lack of funds and the economic situation. Demolition was completed in 2009 on Marlboro Road, taking down several residential houses and along <b>Old</b> Matawan Road and CR 516 and taking down an <b>old</b> gas station in preparing for the project.

The following section discusses myths surrounding <b>older</b> workers: (1) <b>older</b> workers are less productive; (2) <b>older</b> workers cost more to train; (3) <b>older</b> workers raise the cost of benefits; (4) there is an older/younger worker conflict; (5) <b>older</b> workers prefer to not work; (6) <b>older</b> workers are absent more; (7) <b>older</b> workers have more accidents on the job; (8) <b>older</b> workers leave the job; (9) <b>older</b> workers {{do not want to}} be trained; and (10) <b>older</b> workers lack basic skills. The third section focuses on reasons for the low self-esteem of <b>older</b> workers. The fourth section discusses required skills for a trainer and other topics of interest to trainers: design of learning contracts, time requirements and constraints, print size of materials used by <b>older</b> workers, and the learning environment. The last three sections describe limitations of aging employees: vision, hearing, and physical limitations. Contains 16 references.

In recent years the number of <b>older</b> persons aged 60 years and <b>older</b> is growing worldwide. Declining in birth and mortality rates are said to be the main contributors to this new phenomenon. Life expectancy of general population has also increased, and thus the number of <b>older</b> population in society increased. Although all nations in the world are experiencing the growth of <b>older</b> population, developed countries has a relatively large portion of this population in their population structure.

In particular, it describes the growth of <b>older</b> population globally with particular emphasis on the proportion of <b>older</b> population over the years, distribution of <b>older</b> population, and rate of growth of this <b>older</b> population.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the predictors of independent living outcomes among community–living <b>older</b> women who received informal care. The central hypothesis was that <b>older</b> women’s level of functioning is influenced by their relationship with their informal caregiver. The study attempted to understand the independence of <b>older</b> women through the perspective of both informal caregivers and the <b>older</b> women themselves. The following eight variables were measured: 1) the <b>older</b> women’s independence (dependent variable); 2) the relationship between <b>older</b> women and their informal caregivers (independent variable); 3) roles of both the informal caregiver and <b>older</b> women (independent variable); 4) the <b>older</b> women’s attitudes toward aging (independent variable); 5) the <b>older</b> women’s age identity (independent variable); 6) the <b>older</b> women’s health (control variable); 7) the <b>older</b> women’s level of social support (control variable); and 8) the <b>older</b> women’s level of depression (control variable). The variables were measured {{from the perspective of}} the <b>older</b> woman herself and her informal caregiver. This study used an ecological and developmental framework along with role theory to understand the interaction among the aforementioned variables through a cross-sectional design. The recruited <b>older</b> women participants of this study were receiving ongoing care and personal assistance from two large home care agencies located in Miami, FL. An analysis was conducted through a mixed-methods incorporated into the study design. The present study aimed to contribute to the understanding of how the relationship between <b>older</b> women and their informal caregivers influences <b>older</b> women’s ability to maintain independent outcomes. The primary finding of this study was that there were both positive and negative experiences within the relationship dynamic of <b>older</b> women and their informal caregivers and that this relationship was either unidirectional or bi-directional...|$|R

5|$|Hemimetabolous insects, {{those with}} {{incomplete}} metamorphosis, change gradually by undergoing {{a series of}} molts. An insect molts when it outgrows its exoskeleton, which does not stretch and would otherwise restrict the insect's growth.

After this new epicuticle is secreted, the epidermis releases a mixture of enzymes that digests the endocuticle and thus detaches the <b>old</b> cuticle. When this stage is complete, the insect makes its body swell by taking in a large quantity of water or air, which makes the <b>old</b> cuticle split along predefined weaknesses where the <b>old</b> exocuticle was thinnest.|$|E

In the current study, we investigate {{the extent to which}} national variation in perceptions of <b>older</b> people's competence is systematically related to national variation in the extent to which <b>older</b> people participate in paid and volunteer work. METHOD: We used multilevel regression to analyze data from the European Social Survey and test the relationship between perceptions of <b>older</b> people's competence and <b>older</b> people's participation in paid and volunteer work across 28 countries. We controlled for a number of potentially confounding variables, including life expectancy as well as the gender ratio and average education of the <b>older</b> population in each country. We controlled for the average objective cognitive abilities of the <b>older</b> population in a subsample of 11 countries. RESULTS: Older people were {{perceived as}} more competent in countries in which more <b>older</b> people participated in paid or volunteer work, independent of life expectancy and the average education, gender makeup, and average cognitive abilities of the <b>older</b> population.
