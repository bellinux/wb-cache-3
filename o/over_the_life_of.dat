5|$|The {{advanced}} {{clean car}} rules program {{was made to}} reduce tail pipe emissions. The Air Resources Board approved the program to control emissions for newer models from the year 2017 to 2025. Some of their goals by 2025 are to have more environmentally superior cars to be available in different models and different types of cars. New automobiles will emit 34 percent fewer global warming gases and 75 percent fewer smog-forming emissions. And if fully implemented consumers can save an average of $6,000 <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> the car.|$|E

At least six stores have been open at different times in the town. The only store open in the 21st century opened c.1951 and has run under various owners.|$|E
5|$|Air {{compression}} on {{the outer}} surfaces caused the cabin to heat up during flight. Every surface, such as windows and panels, was warm to the touch {{by the end of}} the flight. Besides engines, the hottest part of the structure of any supersonic aircraft is the nose, due to aerodynamic heating. The engineers used Hiduminium R.R. 58, an aluminium alloy, throughout the aircraft because of its familiarity, cost and ease of construction. The highest temperature that aluminium could sustain <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> the aircraft was , which limited the top speed to Mach 2.02. Concorde went through two cycles of heating and cooling during a flight, first cooling down as it gained altitude, then heating up after going supersonic. The reverse happened when descending and slowing down. This had to be factored into the metallurgical and fatigue modelling. A test rig was built that repeatedly heated up a full-size section of the wing, and then cooled it, and periodically samples of metal were taken for testing. The Concorde airframe was designed for a life of 45,000 flying hours.|$|E

5|$|Although {{it always}} had {{hundreds}} of competitors, Standard Oil gradually gained dominance of oil refining and sales as market share in the United States through horizontal integration, ending up with about 90% of the US market. In the kerosene industry, the company replaced the old distribution system with its own vertical system. It supplied kerosene by tank cars that brought the fuel to local markets, and tank wagons then delivered to retail customers, thus bypassing the existing network of wholesale jobbers. Despite improving the quality and availability of kerosene products while greatly reducing their cost to the public (the price of kerosene dropped by nearly 80% <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> the company), Standard Oil's business practices created intense controversy. Standard's most potent weapons against competitors were underselling, differential pricing, and secret transportation rebates.|$|E
5|$|Flash memory can be {{programmed}} and erased {{only a limited}} number of times. This is often referred to as the maximum number of program/erasecycles (P/Ecycles) it can sustain <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> the flash memory. Single-level cell (SLC) flash, designed for higher performance and longer endurance, can typically operate between 50,000 and 100,000 cycles. , multi-level cell (MLC) flash is designed for lower cost applications and has a greatly reduced cycle count of typically between 3,000 and 5,000. Since 2013, triple-level cell (TLC) flash has been available, with cycle counts dropping to 1,000 program-erase (P/E) cycles. A lower write amplification is more desirable, as it corresponds to a reduced number of P/Ecycles on the flash memory and thereby to an increased SSD life.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, two Michigan businessmen, John Rudzewicz and Brian MacShara, {{entered into}} a {{franchise}} agreement with Burger King to run a restaurant in Detroit, Michigan. After MacShara attended four months of training courses at the regional Burger King training facilities in Michigan and in the Florida headquarters on how to operate and administer a Burger King franchise, {{it was agreed that}} the partners would take over operation of an existing Burger King location in Drayton Plains, Michigan. However, during this time disagreements arose between the partners and Burger King over issues of rent, construction fees, building designs and the assignment of legal liabilities. MacShara and Ruzewicz finally signed their franchise agreement after gaining limited concessions over the issues, with Rudzewicz assuming a 20-year, $1,000,000 financial obligation <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> the contract.|$|E

5|$|The Tennessee Walking Horse Breeders' Association {{was formed}} in 1935, with the name changed to the current Tennessee Walking Horse Breeders' and Exhibitors' Association (TWHBEA) in 1974. The stud book was closed in 1947, meaning that since that date every Tennessee Walker must have both parents {{registered}} {{to be eligible for}} registration. In 1950, the United States Department of Agriculture recognized the Tennessee Walking Horse as a distinct breed. In 2000, the Tennessee Walking Horse was named the official state horse of the US state of Tennessee. It is the third most common breed in Kentucky, behind the Thoroughbred and the American Quarter Horse. As of 2005, 450,000 horses have been registered <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> the TWHBEA, with annual registrations of 13,000â€“15,000 new foals.

5|$|The {{capybara}} and {{the lesser}} capybara {{belong to the}} subfamily Hydrochoerinae along with the rock cavies. The living capybaras and their extinct relatives were previously classified in their own family Hydrochoeridae. Since 2002, molecular phylogenetic studies have recognized a close relationship between Hydrochoerus and Kerodon, the rock cavies, supporting placement of both genera in a subfamily of Caviidae. Paleontological classifications have yet to incorporate this new taxonomy and continue to use Hydrochoeridae for all capybaras, while using Hydrochoerinae for the living genus and its closest fossil relatives, such as Neochoerus. The taxonomy of fossil hydrochoerines is also {{in a state of}} flux. In recent years, the diversity of fossil hydrochoerines has been substantially reduced. This is largely due to the recognition that capybara molar teeth show strong variation in shape <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> an individual. In one instance, material once referred to four genera and seven species on the basis of differences in molar shape is now thought to represent differently aged individuals of a single species, Cardiatherium paranense.|$|E
5|$|The parties {{settled the}} lawsuit on July 25, 2011, and a {{majority}} of players signed union authorization cards. The NFL officially recognized the NFLPA's status as the players' collective bargaining representative on July 30, 2011. The NFL and NFLPA proceeded to negotiate terms for a new collective bargaining agreement, and the agreement became effective after ratification by the players August 4, 2011. Under the agreement, which runs through 2021, revenue sharing, the most contentious issue during the lockout, was re-designed so that the players must receive at least 47% of all revenue in salary for the term of the agreement. Additionally, a limit was placed on the amount of money given to rookies. Fifty million dollars was set aside annually for medical research and approximately $1 billion would be set aside for retired player benefits <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> the agreement.|$|E

5|$|In 1984, Holden {{introduced}} the VK Commodore, with significant styling changes {{from the previous}} VH. The Commodore was next updated in 1986 as the VL, which had new front and rear styling. Controversially, the VL was powered by the 3.0-litre Nissan RB30 six-cylinder engine and had a Nissan-built, electronically controlled four-speed automatic transmission. Holden even went to court in 1984 to stop local motoring magazine Wheels from reporting on the matter. The engine change was necessitated by the legal requirement that all new cars sold in Australia after 1986 had to consume unleaded petrol. Because it was unfeasible to convert the existing six-cylinder engine to run on unleaded fuel, the Nissan engine {{was chosen as the}} best engine available. However, changing exchange rates doubled the cost of the engine and transmission <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> the VL. The decision to opt for a Japanese-made transmission led to the closure of the Woodville, South Australia assembly plant. Confident by the apparent sign of turnaround, GM paid off Holden's mounted losses of A$780million on 19 December 1986. At GM headquarters' request, Holden was then reorganised and recapitalised, separating the engine and car manufacturing divisions in the process. This involved the splitting of Holden into Holden's Motor Company (HMC) and Holden's Engine Company (HEC). For the most part, car bodies were now manufactured at Elizabeth, South Australia, with engines as before, confined to the Fishermans Bend plant in Port Melbourne, Victoria. The engine manufacturing business was successful, building four-cylinder Family II engines for use in cars built overseas. The final phase of the Commodore's recovery strategy involved the 1988 VN, a significantly wider model powered by the American-designed, Australian-assembled 3.8-litre Buick V6 engine.|$|E
5|$|Williams' {{popularity}} {{increased when}} he fought with then Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin over a campaign promise Martin had made {{that would lead}} to a revised Atlantic Accord. Martin proposed an eight-year deal that the province would keep 100 percent of offshore oil revenues, but with an expenditure a cap to keep the province from surpassing the per capita tax revenue of Ontario. Williams, supported by the other provincial leaders, walked out of talks with Martin, saying that cap would cost the provincial government billions of dollars in lost revenue <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> its three oil fields. Williams along with Nova Scotia Premier John Hamm, who also wanted the same deal as Newfoundland and Labrador, met with the Prime Minister on several occasions but a deal between Ottawa and the two provinces could not be reached. Williams raised the temperature on December 23, 2004, when he ordered the removal of all Canadian flags from provincial government buildings. On January 10, 2005, Canadian flags started flying once again in the province, and several weeks later Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia reached a deal with Ottawa. A March opinion poll indicated that support for the Williams government had rebounded to 86 percent.|$|E
