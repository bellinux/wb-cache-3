5|$|Principal filming {{took place}} in Vancouver, British Columbia, with the crash scene being filmed on an old airport space with flat roads. However, other key {{sequences}} occurred in the studio. Because the fight scene between the Winchesters and Azazel at the climax was meant {{to take place in}} a secluded, forest-enclosed cabin, production built the set on a sound stage. Production designer Jerry Wanek felt the set was extremely important, as viewers would become uninterested if the forest looked fake. With Morgan rendered blind by the yellow contact lenses required to depict his character's demonic possession, the production crew placed sandbags <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> help the actor locate his marks.|$|E

Her head is tilted towards him and her eyelids joyfully lowered, while his hand (now broken) is holding hers. Their dress reflect the Hindu customs. He wears the sacred thread across his chest, she the customary jewelry. The other characters shown in the wedding carry items or are shown holding items that typically grace a Hindu wedding. Chandra (moon god), for example, holds a traditionally decorated water vessel (kalash).

5|$|The third {{match on}} the card was a Straight Edge Society pledge vs. hair match, between CM Punk and Rey Mysterio. For this match, the other Straight Edge Society members (Serena and Luke Gallows) were banned from ringside. Early on in the match, Punk threw Mysterio headfirst {{out of the ring}} into the barber chair at ringside. Punk had {{suffered}} a cut to the head prior to the exchange, and while Mysterio was on the floor, the match was halted so that the blood could be cleaned up. While Punk's wound was being attended, he dropkicked Mysterio, who was on the ring apron, and began attacking him <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> restart the match. After Mysterio missed a splash from the top rope, Punk went to pin him, but Mysterio was able to perform a crucifix cradle on Punk for the victory. The other Straight Edge Society members attacked Mysterio after the match, but he was saved by Kane, which allowed Mysterio to handcuff Punk to the ring ropes and shave his head.|$|E
5|$|Through use of {{the land}} trade along the Silk Road and {{maritime}} trade by sail at sea, the Tang were able to gain many new technologies, cultural practices, rare luxury, and contemporary items. From the Middle East, India, Persia, and Central Asia the Tang were able to acquire new ideas in fashion, new types of ceramics, and improved silver-smithing. The Chinese also gradually adopted the foreign concept of stools and chairs as seating, whereas the Chinese beforehand always sat on mats placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> <b>To</b> the Middle East, the Islamic world coveted and purchased in bulk Chinese goods such as silks, lacquerwares, and porcelain wares. Songs, dances, and musical instruments from foreign regions became popular in China during the Tang dynasty. These musical instruments included oboes, flutes, and small lacquered drums from Kucha in the Tarim Basin, and percussion instruments from India such as cymbals. At the court there were nine musical ensembles (expanded from seven in the Sui dynasty) representing music from throughout Asia.|$|E

25|$|Sky {{was born}} in 2009; a {{psychiatrist}} Biryukova saw prescribed her antidepressants while she was pregnant although {{she said she did}} not need them. By then lenders were beginning to foreclose the family's properties and they were in arrears on many of their bills. They had {{to move out of the}} Kirkland home and into the smaller Bellevue residence. Solomon claimed in later court papers that at this time, his wife's psychological problems began to manifest themselves, causing him to begin eating outside and sleeping <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> comply with her obsession with keeping the condominium clean. The board cited the couple several times for violating noise regulations; at one point they awoke their neighbors with vacuuming after 11 p.m. She, in turn, alleged he became controlling and angry.|$|E
25|$|The fire began around 4:30 AM on January 19 {{when most}} {{students}} were asleep. It spread rapidly across three couches {{in the third}} floor lounge and approached temperatures of up to 1500 degrees Fahrenheit (815 degrees Celsius) {{in less than five}} minutes. Though no accelerant was used, the fire burned hot enough to melt the synthetic carpet of the hall, causing severe injuries to many of the students attempting to escape the conflagration by crawling <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> reach the stairs. Most students on the third floor evacuated in the thick smoke using the staircases; a few jumped over 40 feet (12 meters) to the ground. Three students died; Aaron Karol and Frank Caltabilota died of thermal injuries, and John Giunta died due to smoke inhalation. Fifty-six students and firefighters were injured, four seriously enough to require lengthy hospital stays and rehabilitation.|$|E
25|$|Cellos are {{tuned in}} fifths, {{starting}} with C2 (two octaves below middle C), followed by G2, D3, and then A3. It is tuned {{in the same}} intervals as the viola, but an octave lower. Unlike the violin or viola but similar to the double bass, the cello has an endpin that rests <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> support the instrument's weight. The cello is most closely associated with European classical music, and {{has been described as}} the closest sounding instrument to the human voice. The instrument {{is a part of the}} standard orchestra, as part of the string section, and is the bass voice of the string quartet (although many composers give it a melodic role as well), as well as being part of many other chamber groups. A large number of concertos and sonatas have been written for the cello.|$|E

On the July 19 episode of Raw, after being assaulted by The Nexus, Jericho began showing signs of a face turn when he teamed with rivals Edge, John Morrison, R-Truth, Daniel Bryan and Bret Hart in {{a team led by}} John Cena to face The Nexus at SummerSlam. Jericho and Cena bickered over leadership of the team, which led to him and Edge attacking Cena during the SummerSlam match that they won. According to Jericho and Edge, the original plan was to put Barrett over. At the end, Jericho and Edge would have lost to The Nexus. However, Cena insisted on coming back from a DDT <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> defeat Barrett and Gabriel. Jericho said that it was a bad idea, because Barrett was not pushed.|$|E
25|$|By 1951, Krasner {{started her}} first series of collage paintings. To create these images, Krasner pasted cut and torn shapes onto {{all but two}} of the {{large-scale}} color field paintings she created for the Betty Parson's exhibition in 1951. This period marks the time when Krasner stopped working on an easel since she created these works by lying the support <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> <b>To</b> make these images, she would pin the separate pieces to a canvas and modify the composition until she was satisfied. She then would paste the fragments on the canvas and add color with a brush when desired. Most of the collage paintings she created recall plant or organic forms but do not completely resemble a living organism. By using many different materials, she was able to create texture and prevent the image from being entirely flat. The act of tearing and cutting elements for the collage embodies Krasner's expression since these acts are aggressive. She explored contrasts of light and dark colors, hard and soft lines, organic and geometric shapes, and structure and improvisation through these collages. These collage paintings represent Krasner's turn away from nonobjective abstraction. From this period onwards, she created metaphorical and content-laden art which alludes to organic figures or landscapes.|$|E
25|$|The soaring {{temperature}} in Chennai, especially during summer, demands extra care for {{residents of the}} zoo. Fortunately, the {{temperature in}}side the zoo campus {{is a couple of}} degrees lower than outside any time of the year, primarily due to the lush greenery. The park also maintains an exclusive summer management schedule. All animal enclosures have thatched roofs and fresh river sand spread <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> make it cooler for the animals. Water is sprinkled on the sand to provide extra cooling. Roofs of water birds' enclosures are covered with coconut leaves and wet gunny bags. Caves that are exposed directly to the sun are put under a shower twice a day. The enclosure for the king cobra has an air conditioner in order to provide an environment similar to its natural habitat as the species cannot withstand the summer heat. For birds, the topmost part of the cage is covered with jute bags, and water is sprinkled three times a day. Based on the temperature, cucumber, buttermilk, apple and banana are also served to herbivores. The zoo has also set up sprinklers to help animals beat the summer heat and is planning to set up about 20 more sprinklers at the deer safari.|$|E

500|$|Problems during {{production}} sometimes arose. For his scenes as the yellow-eyed demon Azazel {{throughout the}} season, Fredric Lehne wore hard, colored contact lenses that greatly obscured his vision. The production crew placed sandbags <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> help him locate his marks. Lindsey McKeon, who portrayed a Reaper briefly possessed by Azazel in [...] "In My Time of Dying", also experienced the same problem. Her scene—she touches Ackles' forehead—took nine takes to film because she kept missing. Filming for [...] "What Is and What Should Never Be" [...] was interrupted {{in order to}} accommodate the busy Adrianne Palicki. Production shifted to the following episode after five days of filming, and resumed when Palicki became available for the final three days.|$|E

He noted in interviews that his primary heroes and influences were Hank Williams, Jimmie Rodgers, Little Richard, and Col. Harland Sanders, the inventor of Kentucky Fried Chicken. Adkins attributed his desire to perform as a one-man band to these artists, stating {{that when he was}} a child, he assumed the only credited musician in the band must have played all the instruments in the recordings. The first time he saw a guitarist in action, he built a guitar of his own.|$|E
40|$|In {{the course}} of a village-scale trial of {{fenthion}}, carried out in a village near Lagos, Nigeria, 40 % fenthion water-dispersible powder was used at a 3. 75 % concentration.

500|$|Tharani {{described}} the set designing {{for the song}} [...] "Sahana", which was also shot at Ramoji Film City, as [...] "extremely challenging". After listening to the lyrics of the song which speaks of the four traditional calendar seasons, Tharani thought of using a concept titled Living in Seasons, which he used at a symposium held in Japan. For the set's design which depicted the four seasons, Tharani proposed three concepts– a traditional Japanese house, a contemporary house and a futuristic house. Shankar chose the futuristic house concept, which consisted of three domes in the shapes of a square, a circle and a pyramid adjacent to one another. The circular dome had a pathway around it and water falling from a 50 feet high rock, which would seep under the set. Tharani made use of acrylic glass and normal glass with the former being implemented <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> make the dance movements more easier to perform. Construction of the set for the number was completed in 30days.|$|E
500|$|Rihanna {{performed}} [...] "Disturbia" [...] on {{her three}} major tours: Good Girl Gone Bad (2007—09), Last Girl on Earth (2010—11) and the Loud Tour (2011). The song was added on the Good Girl Gone Bad Tour set list during the Australasian {{leg of the}} tour. It was the opening song, performed only after the intro on the tour. Rihanna also performed [...] "Disturbia" [...] on her second major concert tour, Last Girl on Earth Tour. The song was performed as the sixth track, after [...] "Fire Bomb". Rihanna performed a slower ballad remix tempo of the song, surrounded by three big four-legged insect monsters as she crawled <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> escape while singing it. About the performance Lisa Wilton from Calgary Sun commented that: [...] "Rihanna's goth side came out – and by 'goth side' I mean she sang alongside dancers dressed as freaky, giant spiders – during the darker dancefloor anthem, 'Disturbia'." [...] On her Loud Tour, Rihanna performed [...] "Disturbia" [...] as second track, only after the opening song [...] "Only Girl (In the World)". Rihanna performed the song in a brightly colored sequined bikini, while partially been dragging on a moveable floor. Rob Williams from Winnipeg Free Press stated: [...] "Rihanna dropped her blue coat to reveal a jewel- encrusted bikini for 'Disturbia'. It {{was the first of}} numerous costume changes that showed off her fashion sense and plenty of skin." [...] Rihanna performed [...] "Disturbia" [...] at Radio 1's Hackney Weekend on May 24, 2012, as the second song on the set list.|$|E
