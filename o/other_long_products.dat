This paper reviews existing literature on the interface of women, health and forests to highlight conservation opportunities and challenges. Most women in forests are collectors and users of forest species. However, existing conservation efforts, deforestation, poor health services and household responsibilities can intensify health and safety concerns for forest dependent women. Women are likely to bear the strenuous burden of carrying fuelwood (and <b>other</b> forest <b>products)</b> <b>long</b> distances and inhaling smoke while cooking. The burden of unintended childbearing, diseases and cultural issues can compound their health problems. To improve local livelihoods and environments, some organisations have initiated activities that integrate conservation and human health objectives, including family planning. This article provides project examples, where the involvement of women {{has been identified as}} a key component in effectively meeting both conservation and development goals...|$|R

American export trade was dominated by agricultural and <b>other</b> resource <b>products</b> <b>long</b> after the majority of the labor force had shifted out of agriculture. The shift out of agriculture was more rapid among the major trading partners of the United States because the American land area increased in the first half of the nineteenth century and agricultural land increased throughout the century. The rise in agricultural land area and a rapid decline in transport cost increased the supply of U. S. agricultural products to Europe and further displaced European agriculture and encouraged migration from Europe. The existence of the large world market, relatively open to the products of American comparative advantage and with a high price elasticity of demand for American exports, encouraged the expansion of U. S. land, agriculture, capital inflows, immigration, and the western migration of population. ...|$|R

40|$|Environmental {{degradation}} {{promoted by}} the presence of sludge piles in the steam generators of Pressurised Water Reactors (PWR) can pose a threat to their safe and continuous operation. The use of dispersants can reduce the rate at which sludge accumulates. Polyacrylic acid (PAA) is currently the only dispersant used in PWRs. Settling rate tests identified several dispersants with the potential to outperform PAA, notably Hydroxyethylidene- 1, 1 -diphosphonic Acid (HEDP). To estimate the dispersant concentration required during plant operation, optimum concentrations were identified for both PAA and HEDP. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry was used to investigate the thermal stability of HEDP between 230 and 270 oC, revealing that HEDP decomposes more rapidly than PAA. The dominant HEDP decomposition product was shown to be orthophosphate but several <b>other</b> <b>long</b> lived intermediate <b>products</b> were detected. The effect of dispersants on the environmental degradation of grade 316 stainless steel was determined by electrochemical methods and by constant extension rate tests. Rates of general corrosion measured by linear polarisation resistance and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were shown to be very low (on the order 10 - 5 mm/year) under aerated and deaerated conditions both at room temperature and at 70 oC. Corrosion rates were slightly reduced in the presence of PAA and HEDP. Constant extension rate tests demonstrated that neither PAA nor HEDP promote stress corrosion cracking at 250 oC. It was concluded HEDP would not be suitable for use in PWRs due to its rapid thermal degradation rate. The decomposition products were shown to rapidly concentrate in steam generators thereby preventing accurate control of water chemistry. ...|$|R
