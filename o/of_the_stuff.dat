25|$|Similarly, Nystrom noted of the band's live performances: Well, {{it must be}} hard {{sometimes}} for Jonas to sing his heart out with lyrics referring to personal dark and depressive matters {{and at the same}} time also be accused of being a reluctant frontman. I actually think much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> he sings about doesn't go in hand with running around on stage, throwing horns, smiling and firing up the audience. We're not an energetic power metal band. I think the withdrawn and shy aura actually does more justice to the concept of our songs than going wild, but we have some songs mainly on the two last albums that don't really fall into the doom and gloom category, but are still dark. And there the more aggressive approach fits better.|$|E

The popular phrase 'Shannon Noll was robbed of the 2003 Australian Idol title' gained popularity in 2015, with multiple Facebook pages appearing featuring the phrase.

I reckon half of the kids putting together these memes {{need to be on}} my marketing team!' In January 2016 a Facebook page was created titled 'Get Shannon Noll to Groovin' the Moo 2016'. Despite the pages thousands of likes the organisers of Groovin' the Moo didn't reach out to the artist to perform. In June 2016, the 'GATchphrase' for the 2016 GAT (a theme chosen by the VCE students of Victoria to write into their papers to show group protest) was voted to be Shannon Noll was robbed of the 2003 Australia Idol title. An estimated 3,600 took part in this event. Noll is recognisable by his southern cross tattoo, an image of which was highly circulated in internet meme culture.

40|$|AbstractAs {{an effort}} to find a lighter shield, <b>the</b> wood <b>stuffed</b> shield was {{proposed}} in this paper based on the wood properties such as low density, low cost, high yield strength when the strain rate is high.

It was found in all the tests that a perforation with diameter of 2. 0 mm was formed in <b>the</b> rear plate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aluminum triple-wall shield. No perforation but slight deformation was found in <b>the</b> rear plates <b>of</b> both pinewood stuffed shield and Nextel /Kevlar fabric <b>stuffed</b> shield. <b>The</b> height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deformation on <b>the</b> rear plates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pinewood <b>stuffed</b> shield was 1. 99 mmm, and that on <b>the</b> Nextel/Kevlar fabric <b>stuffed</b> shield was 2. 01 mm.

500|$|For the Beatles' seminal 1967 album, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, Starr sang lead vocals on the Lennon–McCartney {{composition}} [...] "With a Little Help from My Friends".

That was the peak for everyone else, but {{for me it was}} a bit like being a session musician ... They more or less direct me in the style I can play." [...] His inability to compose new material led to his input being minimised during recording sessions; he often found himself relegated to adding minor percussion effects to songs by McCartney, Lennon and Harrison. During his down-time Starr worked on his guitar playing; he commented: [...] "I jump into chords that no one seems to get into. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> I write is twelve-bar".|$|E
