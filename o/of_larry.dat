Police soon learn the wadding from a blank was accidentally fired into Todd, and a horrified Reggie faces manslaughter charges. Willow, claiming to have simply been seeking fame as an actress, is released without criminal charges. The episode ends with Logan and Wheeler watching a video <b>of</b> <b>Larry</b> King interviewing Willow on a giant screen in Times Square.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, {{while writing}} for Carol, MacFarlane planned {{to develop the}} Larry shorts into a short film series for MADtv; however, the project was {{abandoned}} because the show did not possess a large enough budget to make any kind of animation. As development continued, the genre gradually shifted to a prime-time series, while the characters <b>of</b> <b>Larry</b> and Steve {{formed the basis for}} Peter and Brian, respectively. During the year, a Hanna-Barbera development executive introduced MacFarlane to alternative comedians Mike Darnell and Leslie Collins in an attempt to get Hanna-Barbera back into the prime-time business. The executives were unimpressed; a year later, MacFarlane contacted Collins at Fox; she arranged a meeting with him and the company executives to create a series based on the characters entitled Family Guy.|$|E

On July 26, Black Lives Matter held a protest in Austin, Texas, to mark the third anniversary of the {{shooting}} death <b>of</b> <b>Larry</b> Jackson Jr. On July 28, Chicago Police Department officers shot Paul O'Neal in the back and killed him following a car chase.

Konstantinov's number has not been issued to any player since he was permanently disabled in a vehicle accident after the 1997 Stanley Cup Finals. Number 99 is also unavailable due to having been retired by the league in honor of Wayne Gretzky.|$|E

Though he had never served as a public official, Perot had experience {{as the head of}} several successful corporations and had been involved in public affairs for the previous three decades. Spawned by the American dissatisfaction with the political system, grassroots organizations sprang up in every state to help Perot achieve ballot access following his announcement. James Stockdale, a retired United States Navy vice admiral, was Perot's vice presidential running mate.|$|E

5|$|The {{basis for}} Family Guy was MacFarlane's thesis film The Life <b>of</b> <b>Larry,</b> created in 1995 {{while he was}} a student at the Rhode Island School of Design. A sequel was {{conceived}} in 1996 called Larry & Steve, which aired in 1997 as a segment of Cartoon Network's World Premiere Toons. Both shorts caught the attention of Fox, who contacted MacFarlane in 1998 to develop a series called Family Guy based on the films. A hand-drawn pilot was created by MacFarlane with a budget of $50,000, which led to the series being accepted for production. It was rated TV-PG-L (TV-14-L on Adult Swim).|$|E
5|$|The cast {{consisted}} {{mostly of}} unknowns, though Isabel Bigley, {{who had just}} originated Sister Sarah Brown in Guys and Dolls, was given the leading role of chorus girl Jeanie. For Larry, the assistant stage manager {{who falls in love}} with Jeanie, they cast Bill Hayes, a well-known stage and television actor. William Tabbert, the original Lt. Joe Cable in South Pacific was considered for the part <b>of</b> <b>Larry,</b> but lost out because he was thought to be too tall to be afraid of Mark Dawson, hired as the towering bully Bob.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} Family Guy was {{conceived}} by MacFarlane in 1995 while studying animation at the Rhode Island School of Design. He created two shorts entitled The Life <b>of</b> <b>Larry</b> and Larry & Steve, {{both of which}} {{played a key role}} in Fox executives' decision to pick up the series in 1998. After two seasons, Fox decided to cancel the show. Despite the cancellation, a third season was produced, after which the series was officially cancelled at the end of 2003. Reruns on Cartoon Network's block Adult Swim drove up interest, and a letter-writing campaign, along with impressive DVD sales, encouraged Fox to bring the show back permanently.|$|E

5|$|The {{family was}} {{conceived}} by MacFarlane after developing two animated films, The Life <b>of</b> <b>Larry</b> and Larry & Steve. MacFarlane redesigned the films' protagonist, Larry, and his dog, Steve, and renamed them Peter and Brian, respectively. MacFarlane pitched a seven-minute pilot to Fox in 1998, {{and the show}} was greenlit and began production. Shortly after the third season of Family Guy had aired in 2002, Fox canceled the series with one episode left unaired. Adult Swim aired that episode in 2003, finishing the series' original run. However, favorable DVD sales and high ratings for syndicated reruns on Adult Swim convinced the network to renew the show in 2004 for a fourth season, which began airing on May 1, 2005.|$|E
5|$|After 1943, {{more of the}} team's {{players were}} drafted into military, and the Yankees ended 1944 in third place, one {{position}} higher than they finished the following season. A group consisting <b>of</b> <b>Larry</b> MacPhail, Dan Topping, and Del Webb bought the Yankees, their stadium, and the franchise's minor league teams for $2,800,000 in 1945. Under the new ownership, Yankee Stadium underwent extensive renovations that included the installation of lights. With the war over {{and the return of}} players from overseas, the Yankees set an MLB single-season home attendance record by attracting 2,265,512 fans in 1946. McCarthy resigned as manager early in the season. The Yankees used two other managers during the year (Bill Dickey and Johnny Neun), and ended 1946 in third place. Catcher Yogi Berra made his Yankees debut that year; in his 18-season career, Berra won the AL MVP Award three times. Bucky Harris was brought in to be the manager, and his 1947 team won the AL pennant and defeated the Dodgers in a seven-game World Series. After the end of the Series, MacPhail sold his share of Yankees ownership to Topping and Webb for $2million.|$|E
5|$|MacFarlane {{received}} {{his high school}} diploma in 1991 from the Kent School. While there, he continued experimenting with animation, and his parents gave him an 8 mm camera. MacFarlane went on to study film, video and animation at the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD), where he earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree. As a student, he had originally intended to work for Disney, but changed his mind upon graduating. At RISD MacFarlane created a series of independent films, eventually meeting future Family Guy cast member Mike Henry, whose brother Patrick was MacFarlane's classmate. During his time at RISD, MacFarlane performed stand-up comedy. In his senior year at RISD MacFarlane created a thesis film titled The Life <b>of</b> <b>Larry,</b> which eventually would become the inspiration for Family Guy. MacFarlane's professor submitted his film to the animation studio Hanna-Barbera, where he was later hired.|$|E

5|$|The play first premiered at The Chestnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia on April 6, 1808. In Barker's {{letter to}} Dunlop, he writes the {{performance}} was {{done as a}} benefit for Mr. Bray (who also {{played the role of}} Walter). However, other sources suggest it was a benefit for a Mrs. Woodham. In any case, {{it is clear that the}} performance was interrupted by an offstage commotion which may have cut the performance short. Mr. Webster, a tenor who played the role <b>of</b> <b>Larry,</b> was an object of public scorn at the time because of his effeminate manner and dress, and audience members rioted in outrage at his participation, causing Barker himself to order the curtain to be dropped. The play was subsequently performed again in Philadelphia on February 1, 1809, although it was advertised for January 25.|$|E
5|$|Weak {{steering}} currents {{allowed for}} Larry to drift westward at about twomph (3km/h) while marginally favorable conditions allowed the storm to strengthen to {{a peak of}} 65mph (105km/h) on October 3. A mid-level ridge forced the storm more to the south-southeast, where after remaining a 60mph (97km/h) storm for three days, Larry made landfall on Paraíso in the Mexican state of Tabasco on October 5. It steadily weakened over land, and degenerated into a remnant low on October 6 while midway through the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. The remnant low turned to the southwest, and reached the eastern Pacific Ocean on the October 7. The remnants <b>of</b> <b>Larry</b> re-organized in the eastern Pacific, with the National Hurricane Center indicating {{for the possibility of}} redevelopment into a tropical depression on October 9. However, the convection diminished, and further development was no longer anticipated.|$|E
