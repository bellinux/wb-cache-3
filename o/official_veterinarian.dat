40|$|In {{recent years}} {{controversial}} discussions arose during major animal disease outbreaks in the EU about the ethical soundness of mass culling. In contrast to numerous publications about ethical issues and laboratory animals/animal experiments, literature concerning ethical deliberations {{in the case}} of mass culling as a means of outbreak control remain scarce. Veterinarians in charge of decision about and implementation of mass culling actions find themselves in an area of conflict in between the officially required animal disease control policy and a public that is increasingly critical.

The Compendium {{committee}} and consultants believe these updates and revisions will aid public health <b>officials,</b> physicians, <b>veterinarians,</b> and the pet bird industry in controlling this disease in birds and in people. The 2006 Compendium provides clearer guidance to veterinary clinicians on selecting diagnostic tests, and a discussion of persistent IFA titers. Wording on sentinel surveillance was added, mentioning that it may have value in high risk settings or to mitigate future liability. Protocols for sentinel surveillance must be individualized and established with advice of an avian veterinarian. To help control this disease and protect public health, the Compendium committee and consultants encourage you to distribute this to health <b>officials,</b> <b>veterinarians,</b> and the pet bird industry in your state and actively promote the document as a standard.

However, the regional laboratory {{of the federal}} state Thuringia in Germany examined diseased wild boars routinely also for the occurrence of organisms. Between 2006 and 2008, only the serovar Choleraesuis was islolated from 24 animals, three strains isolated from domestic pigs were included. In order to detect a possible epidemiological context, the strains of Choleraesuis were characterised by macrorestriction and plasmid analysis, repetitive sequence PCR, antimicrobial testing and determining the biochemical profile. A combination of all methods enabled the identification of five epidemiological groups. Two groups were detected in the same territory but three other discriminative groups were predominant in different regions. Choleraesuis strains of the different epidemiological groups circulate in wild boar populations in the corresponding regions. However, it could be concluded that both natural barriers like mountains and artificial barriers like arterial roads may cause the separation of wild boar populations {{and as a result}} also the respective Choleraesuis organisms.

40|$|This paper aims {{to look at}} a new {{angle of}} EU sports law, namely that of the equestrian sport. In doing so the paper investigates to what extent the horse sport {{including}} the racing industry complies with EU law. Sport has for a long time been recognized as falling within the scope of EU law if connected to economic activity. Nonetheless, some national equestrian and racing federations have special rules that are more favorable to home bred horses or only allow such horses to enter a race or a class. This sounds like clear-cut discrimination from a EU law point of view, but up until now there have been no, or very few, analyses of these issues and towhat extent these special national rules could be justified (for example to safeguard the breeding of national horses which is the common justification put forward by some national racing associations). Another area, which merits attention, is that of travelling with horses (with EU passports) to sports events in the EU. The EU regulation in question requires a health certificate from an <b>official</b> <b>veterinarian</b> but how these rules are applied in practice varies. Hence {{the purpose of this paper}} is to investigate a new area of EU sport law, which seems to have been neglected and remained in the shadow of other sports: that of the European horse world.

40|$|Meat {{inspection}} now {{incorporates a}} more risk-based approach for protecting human health against meat-borne biological hazards. Official post-mortem meat inspection of pigs {{has shifted to}} visual meat inspection. The <b>official</b> <b>veterinarian</b> decides on additional post-mortem inspection procedures, such as incisions and palpations. The decision is based on declarations in the food chain information (FCI), antemortem inspection and post-mortem inspection. However, a smooth slaughter and inspection process is essential. Therefore, one {{should be able to}} assess prior to slaughter which pigs are suitable for visual meat inspection only, and which need more profound inspection procedures. This study evaluates the usability of the FCI provided by pig producers and considered the possibility for risk ranking of incoming slaughter batches according to the previous meat inspection data and the current FCI. Eighty-five slaughter batches comprising 8954 fattening pigs were randomly selected at a slaughterhouse that receives animals from across Finland. The mortality rate, the FCI and the meat inspection results for each batch were obtained. The current FCI alone provided insufficient and inaccurate information for risk ranking purposes for meat inspection. The partial condemnation rate for a batch was best predicted by the partial condemnation rate calculated for all the pigs sent for slaughter from the same holding in the previous year (p < 0. 001) and by prior information on cough declared in the current FCI (p = 0. 02) statement. Training and information to producers are needed to make the FCI reporting procedures more accurate. Historical meat inspection data on pigs slaughtered from the same holdings and well-chosen symptoms/signs for reporting, {{should be included in the}} FCI to facilitate the allocation of pigs for visual inspection. The introduced simple scoring system can be easily used for additional information for directing batches to appropriate meat inspection procedures. To control the main biological public health hazards related to pork, serological surveillance should be done and the information obtained from analyses should be used as part of the FCI.

Taking these fattening data into consideration during <b>official</b> <b>veterinarian</b> Examinations is designed to getting the best possible Information about the flock. Results of the ante mortem examination are to be examined or explained by its origination, {{to be able to}} determine the general health condition of a herd. This Research was done with the goal of tracing possible causes of Fibrinous Serositis, by taking into consideration the Information of the flock of origin as well as the corresponding data at slaughter. In Course of the Study, 48. 000 male Turkeys of the meat hybrids BIG- 6 were observed regularly every four weeks during the fattening and afterwards from the meat inspection. The 10 chosen Turkey feedlots were split into two groups due to occurred cases of Fibrinous Serositis to date. The Living Turkeys were monitored with an examination sheet, which was divided into three sections, called the farm record. In Terms of the operating data, the data of the management and other factors including a clinical examination, there were differences between the herds of Group 1 and Group 2 regarding Stables (Size, etc.) Caretakers, Hygiene (change of clothes, Desinfection, Cleanliness of feeding tins), time between fattening periods, control measure of Alphitobius diaperinus, Concentration of Ammonia in the air, number of animals that died in the fattening and weight of the individual animals. Often it was just one flock that tipped the scale and made the difference to the other group. During the meat inspection, the differences between the surveyed Herds were able to be determined. Differences were found during the following parameters: - Number of animals that died in the fattening - Carcasses unfit for human consumption - Percentage of the carcasses which are unfit in respect to the number of Animals in the origin flock - Percentage of Turkeys displaying Fibrinous Serositis - Number of the Animals with breast blisters The selection that was made in respect to the Fibrinous Serositis was maintained. Summing up the husbandry conditions and taking into consideration the determined code, there is an explicit difference between the two groups. Group 1 has much better results to Fibrinous Serositis than Group 2. Two feedlots whose results differed severely were compared to determine the differences. The following differences were determined, and they should, if necessary, be examined further in future investigations: - distance of Stable to cadaver place - habits of clothes - changing of the caretakers - cleanliness of feeding tins - stocking density This leads to the conclusion, that the meat inspection do confirm the circumstances of fattening. This makes clear, that the Hygienic circumstances of the keeping of the animals is influential. If the abattoir files too many negative reports, an intervention is recommended and regarded helpful. Due to the differences between the groups, it is possible to give parameters, that could be seen as ways to determine the origins of Fibrinous Serositis. The following points are of special interest, taking into consideration the parameters that have shown differences between the two groups: - human caretaking - Hygiene - Time between fattening periods - (Concentration of Ammonia in the air) - Number of animals that died in the fattening It was found out, that the smallest possible differences can "open a window", or cause the spreading of facultative pathogenic micro-organism. The Studies have shown, that the general standard of Hygiene alone cannot be held responsible for Fibrinous Serositis, but that bad hygienic circumstances are perhaps beneficial to the origins of the disease. <br...|$|E

The majority of the sheep production systems was extensive/semi-extensive (74. 5 %). The management practices adopted by the farmers to reduce parasitism were: split young and adult animals (5. 6 %), change pasture after deworm the animals (5. 2 %), use quarantine for incoming animals (2. 3 %), deworm newly arrived sheep (1. 5 %), and have regular technical assistance (31. 9 %). Although 76. 5 % of the farmers medicate the animals, treatments were performed without any major technical criteria, with an average interval of 4. 6 months. The most commonly used drug families were macrocyclic lactones (38. 5 %) and benzimidazoles (24. 9 %). The management practices adopted in Minas Gerais are based on old recommendations and may not return in a good set of strategies to prevent parasite infections. Field observations reinforce the finding where farmers have obtained unsatisfactory results in maintaining the health and productivity level of their enterprises...|$|R

This Compendium updates the 2009 Compendium. Notable {{changes in the}} Compendium are as follows: Human Case Definition: The Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) approved a change to the human case definition effective January 2010. To meet a probable case definition, supportive serology (e. g. C. psittaci antibody titer [Immunoglobulin M, IgM] requires a minimum titer of 1 / 32. The previous definition required a titer of 1 / 16. The new case definition also recognizes polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing as a diagnostic criterion. Laboratory Testing: The Committee reported last year that FOCUS Diagnostics laboratory is no longer manufacturing microimmunofluorescence (MIF) testing kits. However, many private laboratories still have them in inventory. The committee recommends that laboratories be contacted directly to ascertain the testing option...|$|R
40|$|Psittacosis, {{also known}} as parrot fever and ornithosis, is a {{bacterial}} infection of humans that can cause severe pneumonia and other serious health problems. It is caused by Chlamydophila psittaci, formerly known as Chlamydia psittaci. From 2005 through 2009, 66 human cases of psittacosis were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) through the Nationally Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). In general, these cases occur after exposure to infected pet birds, usually cockatiels, parakeets, parrots, and macaws. In birds, C. psittaci infection {{is referred to as}} avian chlamydiosis. Infected birds shed the bacteria through feces and nasal discharges, and humans become infected from exposure to these materials. This Compendium provides information about psittacosis and avian chlamydiosis to public health <b>officials,</b> physicians, <b>veterinarians,</b> the pet bird industry, and others concerned with controlling these diseases and protecting public health. The recommendations in this Compendium provide standardized procedures to control avian chlamydiosis in birds, a vital step to protect human health.

40|$|Certain venues {{encourage}} or {{permit the}} public to be in contact with animals, resulting in millions of human-animal interactions each year. These settings include county or state fairs, petting zoos, animal swap meets, pet stores, feed stores, zoologic institutions, circuses, carnivals, educational farms, livestock-birthing exhibits, educational exhibits at schools and child-care facilities, and wildlife photo opportunities. Although human-animal contact has many benefits, human health problems are associated with these settings, including infectious diseases, exposure to rabies, and injuries. Infectious disease outbreaks {{have been caused by}} Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7, Salmonella species, Cryptosporidium species, Coxiella burnetii, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, ringworm, and other pathogens. Such outbreaks have substantial medical, public health, legal, and economic effects. This report provides recommendations for public health <b>officials,</b> <b>veterinarians,</b> animal venue staff members, animal exhibitors, visitors to animal venues, physicians, and others concerned with minimizing risks associated with animals in public settings. The recommendation to wash hands is the most important for reducing the risk for disease transmission associated with animals in public settings. Other important recommendations are that venues prohibit food in animal areas and include transition areas between animal areas and nonanimal areas, visitors receive information about disease risk and prevention procedures, and animals be properly cared for and managed. These updated 2011 guidelines provide new information on the risks associated with amphibians and with animals in day camp settings, as well as the protective role of zoonotic disease education.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} {{surveillance}} {{is to provide}} timely and relevant information to allow early warning and inform policy makers for rapid response to reduce the spread and mitigate the impact of disease. This practical handbook about surveillance {{is intended to be}} used mainly by Veterinary Services or other Competent Authorities, their staff and experts as a tool for strengthening the design, implementation and evaluation of surveillance systems for diseases of relevance for terrestrial animals in their country. The book reflects the contribution of experts in surveillancemethodology from across the world. Recognising the diversityof animal husbandry and other situations in Member Countries and the dynamic nature of animal health, the document presents a flexible framework for integrating surveillance approaches that meet both national and international needs and that should remain relevant as surveillance evolves to embrace new challenges and opportunities. Veterinary Services complying with OIE standards on quality are a cornerstone for effective passive and active surveillance activities, as well as efficient public-private partnerships between <b>official</b> and private <b>veterinarians</b> and animal owners,hunters and rangers in conservation areas.

40|$|Amber Roegner, 1 Federico Giannitti, 2 Leslie W Woods, 2 Asli Mete, 2 Birgit Puschner 1, 2 1 Department of Molecular Biosciences, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of California, Davis, CA, USA; 2 California Animal Health and Food Safety Laboratory System, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of California, Davis, CA, USA Abstract: Lead {{intoxication}} in livestock {{has historically}} been associated with cattle turned out to pasture and accidental ingestion of lead from drinking crankcase oil, licking grease from machinery, chewing on plumbing or batteries, or drinking water contaminated from leaching materials. Even with the decrease in manufactured items produced with lead, contaminants persist in the landscape and may enter the food supply through animal products. Changing patterns of open range herds moving to new pasture and the increased popularity of urban/suburban backyard chickens or other livestock necessitates public awareness about the clinical signs of lead intoxication, the potential for subclinical animals, public health concerns, particularly for exposure in children, and testing options available. Cases of lead intoxication in livestock demand a thorough case work-up to identify all sources of lead, address subclinical cases, evaluate risk to consumers, and make management suggestions for future prevention. We discuss four recent cases of confirmed lead poisoning in backyard chickens and open range cattle and assess the public health implications therein. Taken {{as a whole and}} considering the potential of the remaining herd or flock to be affected without necessarily showing signs, public health <b>officials</b> and <b>veterinarians</b> should be prepared to advise clients on case work-up and management and prevention considerations. Backyard chickens and cattle may not present for suspected lead poisoning as in several of the cases discussed herein yet may still contain concerning tissue or blood levels. The authors believe increased surveillance through heavy metal screens is crucial to adequately protect public health. Keywords: bovine, diagnosis, plumbism, residue, toxicosis, poultr...|$|R
5000|$|The date of Topsy's demise {{was finally}} set for Sunday, January 4, 1903. The press {{attention}} the event had received brought out an estimated 1500 spectators and 100 press photographers {{as well as}} agents from the ASPCA to inspect the proceedings. Thompson and Dundy allowed 100 spectators into the park although more climbed through the park fence. Many more were on the balconies and roofs of nearby buildings, which were charging admission to see the event. The Electric Tower had been re-rigged with large ropes set up to strangle the elephant, which were inspected by the ASPCA agents {{to make sure they}} conformed to what had been agreed. The details of the electrocution part of the execution were handled by workers from the local power company, Edison Electric Illuminating Company of Brooklyn, under the supervision of chief electrician P. D. Sharkey. They spent the night before stringing power lines from the Coney Island electrical substation nine blocks to the park to carry alternating current they planned to redirect from a much larger plant in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. At Bay Ridge the staff was told to [...] "get an engine ready and clear a feeder and bus to Coney Island Station". [...] Topsy was led out of her pen into the unfinished Luna Park by Carl Goliath, an expert on elephants who formerly worked for animal showman Carl Hagenbeck. Newspaper accounts of the events noted that Topsy refused to cross the bridge over the lagoon, ignoring prodding by Goliath and even bribes of carrots and apples. The owners of Luna Park then tried to get William Alt, who would not watch the killing, to lead Topsy across the bridge, but he declined an offer of $25 to coax her to her death saying he would “not for $1000”. They finally gave up trying to get Topsy across the bridge and decided to [...] "bring death to her". The steam engine, ropes, and the electrical lines were re-rigged to the spot where Topsy stood. The electricians attached copper-lined sandals connected to AC lines to Topsy's right fore foot and left hind foot so the charge would flow through the elephant's body. With chief electrician Sharkey making sure everyone was clear, Topsy was fed carrots laced with 460 grams of potassium cyanide by press agent Charles Murray who then backed away. At 2:45pm Sharkey gave a signal and an electrician on a telephone told the superintendent at Coney Island station nine blocks away to close a switch and Luna Park chief electrician Hugh Thomas closed another one at the park, sending 6,600 volts from Bay Ridge across Topsy's body for 10 seconds, toppling her to the ground. According to at least one contemporary account, she died [...] "without a trumpet or a groan". After Topsy fell, the steam-powered winch tightened two nooses placed around her neck for 10 minutes. At 2:47, Topsy was pronounced dead. An ASPCA <b>official</b> and two <b>veterinarians</b> employed by Thompson and Dundy determined that the electric shock had killed Topsy. During the killing the superintendent of the Coney Island station, Joseph Johansen, became [...] "mixed up in the apparatus" [...] when he threw the switch sending power to the park and was nearly electrocuted. He was knocked out and left with small burns from the power traveling from his right arm to his left leg.|$|R
