Each Link has cameras and over 30 vibration sensors to sense if the kiosk {{has been hit}} by an object. A separate set of sensors also detects if the USB ports are tampered with. If either the vibration sensors or the USB port sensors detect tampering, an alert is displayed at LinkNYC headquarters that the specific part of the Link has been affected. All <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Links</b> have a backup battery power supply that can last for up to 24 hours if a long-term power outage were to occur. This is {{because of what happened}} in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy in 2012, which caused power outages citywide, especially to the city's payphones (which were connected to the municipal power supply of New York City).|$|E
5|$|Since the Links' deployment, {{there have}} been several {{concerns}} about the kiosks' features. Privacy advocates have stated that the data of LinkNYC users can be collected and used to track users' movements throughout the city. There are also concerns with cybercriminals possibly hijacking the Links, or renaming their personal wireless networks to the same name as LinkNYC's network, in order to steal LinkNYC users' data. In addition, prior to September 2016, the tablets <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Links</b> could be used to browse the Internet. In summer 2016, concerns arose about the Link tablets' browsers being used for illicit purposes; despite the implementation of content filters on the kiosks, the illicit activities continued, and the browsers were disabled.|$|E

In this research, the evaluation for performance <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Link</b> REIT would be divided into three scopes. Firstly, <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> REIT would be evaluated by analyzing the indices. Secondly, <b>the</b> attributes <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Link's</b> shopping centres would be evaluated by analyzing <b>the</b> determinants <b>of</b> rental income. Last but not least, customer satisfaction would be evaluated by measuring the service quality based on SERVQUAL instrument. The first two scopes of evaluation would be mainly based on the secondary data.

After collecting and analyzing all data, position impacts <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Link's</b> management was identified to <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> REIT and <b>the</b> attributes <b>of</b> its shopping centres. In contrary on the first two evaluations, customers including both <b>of</b> <b>the</b> visitors and tenants were found dissatisfied to <b>the</b> empathy attributes <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Link's</b> shopping centres. <b>The</b> customer expectation valued greater than the customer perception.

25|$|From its foundation, the Irish Free State was {{embroiled in}} a civil war between nationalists {{supporting}} the Treaty and opponents who supported a republic. The pro-Treaty side, organised as Cumann na nGaedheal emerged victorious from the conflict and won subsequent elections. They formed the government of the state until 1932, when they peacefully handed over power to the anti-Treaty faction in Fianna Fáil, who defeated them in an election. The Irish state, despite its violent beginnings, has remained a liberal democracy throughout its existence.

25|$|Critics {{argued that}} some {{politicians}} supporting the War on Terror {{are motivated by}} reasons other than those they publicly state.

Published reports <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>links</b> began in late December 1998. In January 1999, Newsweek magazine published a story about Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda joining forces to attack U.S. interests in the Gulf Region. ABC News broadcast a story of this link soon after. Polls suggested that a majority of Americans believed that Saddam Hussein was linked to the attacks of September 11, 2001. However, despite shifting public opinion, the Bush Administration believed that there was the possibility of a potential collaboration between al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein's Ba'ath regime following the U.S. led invasion of Afghanistan.|$|E

Defensive trenches and machine gun emplacements had been seen being dug on those hilltops during the previous weeks. Herman wanted his forces to occupy the position before Mexican reinforcements got there. In the frenzy of the unexpected battle, armed Mexican civilians stormed the home of Gen.

25|$|Problems in {{communities}} or cultures, including poverty, unemployment or underemployment, {{lack of social}} cohesion, and migration, {{have been associated with}} the development of mental disorders. Stresses and strains related to socioeconomic position (socioeconomic status (SES) or social class) have been linked to the occurrence of major mental disorders, with a lower or more insecure educational, occupational, economic or social position generally linked to more mental disorders. There have been mixed findings on the nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>links</b> and {{on the extent to which}} pre-existing personal characteristics influence the links. Both personal resources and community factors have been implicated, as well as interactions between individual-level and regional-level income levels. The causal role of different socioeconomic factors may vary by country. Socioeconomic deprivation in neighborhoods can cause worse mental health, even after accounting for genetic factors. In addition, minority ethnic groups, including first or second-generation immigrants, have been found to be at greater risk for developing mental disorders, which has been attributed to various kinds of life insecurities and disadvantages, including racism. The direction of causality is sometimes unclear, and alternative hypotheses such as the Drift Hypothesis sometimes need to be discounted.|$|E
