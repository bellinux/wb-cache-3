25|$|On {{the first}} day of this match at Sophia Gardens, Cardiff, Glamorgan scored runs at nearly six an over as David Hemp (120), Matthew Maynard (105) and Ian Thomas (133) all making centuries. They {{continued}} on the second day, adding 87 for the last three wickets to end with a total of 603, until Cardiff UCCE finally dismissed them - before they were bowled out for 152 in reply, spinner Dean Cosker taking three for 13. However, Glamorgan chose not to enforce the follow-on and elected for more batting practice. By close of play they were 134 for no loss. On the third and final day, Mark Wallace and Jonathan Hughes both completed their centuries, making 117 and 109 (retired hurt) respectively. Glamorgan eventually declared on 381 for 3 after 28 third-day <b>oers,</b> leaving Cardiff UCCE an impossible 833 to win - before Andrew Davies nipped out a wicket after five minutes. After Simon Jones got another, and Cardiff UCCE were 57 for 2, Rhodri Lloyd and Simon Butler got together for three hours, {{until the end of the}} match. When Lloyd was out for 102, Butler was on 104, and the game ended in a draw.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the most}} {{frequently}} cited benefits of <b>OER</b> is their potential to reduce costs. While <b>OER</b> seem well placed to bring down total expenditures, they are not cost-free. New <b>OER</b> can be assembled or simply reused or repurposed from existing open resources. This is a primary strength of <b>OER</b> and, as such, can produce major cost savings. <b>OER</b> need not be created from scratch. On the other hand, there are some costs in the assembly and adaptation process. And some <b>OER</b> must be created and produced originally at some time. While <b>OER</b> must be hosted and disseminated, and some require funding, <b>OER</b> development can take different routes, such as creation, adoption, adaptation and curation.|$|R

40|$|Although {{it is over}} {{a decade}} since the term <b>OER</b> was coined in the 2002 UNESCO’s Forum on the Impact of Open Courseware for Higher Education (Johnstone, 2005), there is still little {{consensus}} on the nature and the added value of <b>OER</b> in a language learning context. As Fred Mulder, UNESCO chair in <b>OER,</b> claims, “OER will need 20 to 30 years to reach its ultimate global realization” (Mulder, 2012). There is a growing interest into the shift from <b>OER</b> to Open Educational Practice (OEP) with the emphasis put on <b>OER</b> uptake in other learning contexts than those for {{which they have been}} originally designed, thus highlighting the dynamics that can occur in <b>OER</b> reuse (Conole, 2013; Weller, 2010). In the CALL field, progress into understanding the potential of OER/OEP for language learning and teaching is made, through scientific events (Eurocall 2012 SIG on <b>OER</b> [URL]) and joint publications (Beaven et al., 2013; Borthwick et al., 2013; Lane et al., 2013, Thomas & Evans, 2014). The symposium addresses the question of multilingualism and <b>OER,</b> by discussing the place of linguistic pluralism in a fast developing <b>OER</b> landscape in which very few languages are dominant (Zourou, 2013). Less used languages due to fewer resources, human and material, compared to dominant languages, face new challenges when situated in the <b>OER</b> scene. More precisely we look at the following issues: 1. Which languages are represented in repositories of <b>OER</b> (ROER) and what kind of subjects do they cover? 2. How multilingual repositories cope with the management of <b>OER</b> in various languages? How is the management (upload, sharing, updates, monitoring) of these resources possible? How do language teachers and learners engage with <b>OER</b> in these repositories? 3. Is <b>OER</b> uptake a far-fetched idea or current practice? What kind of evidence does exist of <b>OER</b> uptake in a language learning/teaching context...|$|R

This work also revealed the role that <b>OER</b> teacher champions play in sharing the benefits of <b>OER</b> with colleagues and supporting the knowledge sharing, collaboration, and use of <b>OER</b> in online <b>OER</b> communities (ISKME, 2008; Petrides & Jimes, 2010; Petrides et al., 2011).|$|R
40|$|Earlier this year, SPARC {{launched}} Connect OER—a {{platform to}} share and discover information about Open Educational Resources (<b>OER)</b> activities at campuses across North America. Through Connect <b>OER,</b> academic libraries create and manage profiles about their institution’s efforts on <b>OER,</b> producing valuable data that we use to populate a searchable directory and produce an annual report. As the first Connect <b>OER</b> Annual Report, this document summarizes insights from the Connect <b>OER</b> pilot, which ran from May - July 2017. The data encompass 65 SPARC member libraries spanning 31 U. S. states and five Canadian provinces {{who participated in the}} pilot. Our analysis provides a snapshot of what is happening on the ground level with <b>OER</b> at this subset of institutions. Our intent is that these insights will help inform SPARC members, the open education community, and the library community at large about current trends, best practices, and the collective impact being achieved through <b>OER</b> at participating institutions. The purpose of the Connect <b>OER</b> pilot was to identify: • Which SPARC member campuses were actively engaging in <b>OER</b> • What role the library—in relation to other campus stakeholders—was playing in these efforts • What institutional resources have been made available to support these efforts • What kinds of activities and partnerships exist on campus • What the overall impact of <b>OER</b> has been at SPARC member campuses As the project transitions out of the pilot, we hope that the Connect <b>OER</b> directory will continue to grow, so that future annual reports can provide insights based on a broader range of institutions across North America. We recognize that the directory will never reach a state of completion since activities are always evolving, but our annual snapshots will provide a meaningful illustration of the reach of the <b>OER</b> movement, and the impact it has for students. Key Inisights 1. Libraries are the most engaged entity on campus in efforts to advance <b>OER</b> 2.

40|$|To correct an {{over-exposure}} {{within an}} image, the over-exposed region (<b>OER)</b> {{must first be}} detected.

However, the results of conventional <b>OER</b> detection methods, which generally use the brightness and color information of each pixel, often deviate from the actual <b>OER</b> perceived by the human eye. To overcome this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel method for detecting the perceived <b>OER</b> more accurately. Based on the observation that recognizing the <b>OER</b> in an image is dependent on the saturation sensitivity of the human visual system (HVS), we detect the <b>OER</b> by thresholding the saturation value of each pixel. Here, a function of the proposed method, which is designed {{based on the results of}} a subjective evaluation on the saturation sensitivity of the HVS, adaptively determines the saturation threshold value using the color and the perceived brightness of each pixel. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method accurately detects the perceived <b>OER,</b> and furthermore, the over-exposure correction can be improved by adopting the proposed <b>OER</b> detection method...|$|R
40|$|India {{appears to}} show a huge {{appetite}} for openness. In 2008 the Indian Government’s National Knowledge Commission (NKC) called for a ‘national econtent and curriculum initiative’ to stimulate the creation, adaptation and utilization of <b>OER</b> by Indian institutions and the leveraging of <b>OER</b> produced outside India. Since then India has gained its own national <b>OER</b> repository – the National Repository of Open Educational Resources (NROER) ([URL] launched in 2013, extending the existing provision of <b>OER</b> offered by repositories such as the Indira Ghandi National Open University (IGNOU) -hosted e-GyanKosh ([URL] Beyond the creation and delivery of content, open educational practices have been promoted by the ever-growing Wikimedia India Chapter and by Creative Commons India, not to mention numerous <b>OER</b> projects seeking to exploit the potential of <b>OER</b> {{in the interests of}} educational inclusion and social justice. Tracking the development of <b>OER</b> in India, Das (2011, p. 14) concludes that ‘Indian <b>OER</b> initiatives serve diverse learning communities and bridge knowledge gaps between privileged and under-privileged communities’. Since 2013 the <b>OER</b> Research Hub (www. oerresearchhub. org) has been conducting collaborative research with the UK Open University-led India-based TESS-India project ([URL] which is developing <b>OER</b> for use in India’s teacher education system. In 2014 this research was broadened to include a pan-India survey of <b>OER</b> use and attitudes to <b>OER</b> and openness. The biggest of its kind ever to have been conducted in India, the survey employs many of the questions developed by the <b>OER</b> Research Hub for use in its <b>OER</b> impact research around the world ([URL] plus further questions designed to be appropriate to Indian educators and learners. Availability in English and Hindi language versions has increased the survey’s reach, as has its being available both online and in hard copy format, thereby avoiding the perpetuation of the digital divide that can occur when online-only surveys are conducted in the developing world. The survey respondents include educators in the K 12, college and higher education sectors, in addition to teacher educators, education managers, NGOs, academics, activists and policy-makers. Topics covered by the survey include understanding of open licensing, attitudes to sharing and actual sharing practices, open resource creation and adaptation, disciplinary differences in the creation and use of <b>OER,</b> selection indicators used when choosing <b>OER,</b> perceptions of the impact of <b>OER</b> on India’s formal and informal learners, cost-savings enjoyed through <b>OER</b> use, and barriers to <b>OER</b> use and re-use experienced by educators and learners. The pan-India survey report will be launched at <b>OER</b> 15 and this paper will share the main survey findings, building an overall picture of attitudes to openness and the use of <b>OER</b> in diverse education sectors across India. These findings will then be compared with data collected by the <b>OER</b> Research Hub elsewhere in the world. The paper concludes by providing recommendations to existing and future <b>OER</b> projects operating in India, arguing that the distinct social, economic and cultural factors impacting on India’s education system demand a unique approach to developing, using and promoting <b>OER</b> for use in the Indian sub-continent. ...|$|R
