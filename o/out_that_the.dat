5|$|Horowitz points <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> film's {{dichotomy}} {{of absolute}} good versus absolute evil glosses {{over the fact}} that most Holocaust perpetrators were ordinary people; the movie does not explore how the average German rationalized their knowledge of or participation in the Holocaust. Author Jason Epstein commented that the movie gives the impression that if people were smart enough or lucky enough, they could survive the Holocaust; this was not actually the case. Spielberg responded to criticism that Schindler's breakdown as he says farewell is too maudlin and even out of character by pointing <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> scene is needed to drive home the sense of loss and to allow the viewer an opportunity to mourn alongside the characters on the screen.|$|E

5|$|In another study, Gregory S.

He also mentioned that Alexander's (1989) formula to calculate speed by bone strength was only partly reliable. He suggests that the formula is overly sensitive to bone length; making long bones artificially weak. He also pointed <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> lowered risk of being wounded in combat may have been worth the risk of Tyrannosaurus falling while running.|$|E

While this was a legitimate interest, the judge said, it was not covered by the environmental laws under which the plaintiffs chose to challenge the project.

He was angered that Hoover refused to call a special legislative session to adopt relief measures after the regular congressional adjourned in early March 1931.
