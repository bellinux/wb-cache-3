My research is focused on the problem of cheques as the method <b>of</b> payment <b>of</b> <b>benefits</b> in practice, extend of usage of this payment method, not only in terms <b>of</b> payment <b>of</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> assistance in material need by the Municipality of Klatovy, but by the other regions of the Czech Republic as well...|$|R

Alprazolam is no longer recommended in Australia for the treatment of panic disorder due to concerns regarding tolerance, dependence, and abuse.

5|$|Even {{prior to}} the cost {{increases}} which plagued the design and construction of the tram, the project has been subject to criticism from the public. Many residents in the neighborhoods under the tram's route object to the tram's presence. The cost increases themselves, and the perceived machinations of public officials, have been controversial.

40|$|The paper {{provides}} an overview <b>of</b> unemployment <b>benefit</b> systems in Central and Eastern Europe during the 1990 s. It describes their institutional features (eligibility, the level and duration <b>of</b> <b>benefits,</b> and special rules), discusses issues arising in their implementation, and examines their performance. Income protection effects, derived from the empirical analysis of household income and expenditures surveys, pertain to the coverage, the average size <b>of</b> <b>benefits</b> in household income, and the targeting <b>of</b> <b>benefits.</b> Efficiency effects, obtained from a literature review, {{are related to the}} effects <b>of</b> <b>benefits</b> on the duration of unemployment spell, restructuring, and overall unemployment and employment rates. The evidence shows that (i) unemployment benefits were progressive; (ii) that, in countries with broad coverage and sizeable share <b>of</b> <b>benefits</b> in household incomes, they strongly reduced poverty; and (iii) that, similar to findings for developed economies, they created work disincentives.

5|$|Management of {{the site}} {{requires}} moderate grazing {{during the summer and}} autumn to help maintain the species diversity. This is because grazing removes each year's new growth which helps stop the site becoming dominated by vigorously growing grasses. Such grasses would allow a buildup of dead organic matter, which together with the increased growth, would reduce the growth of less vigorous species. The overall effect would be a reduction in species diversity, {{which was one of the}} reasons for the SSSI designation. Trampling can be <b>of</b> <b>benefit</b> because it breaks up accumulated dead organic matter.|$|E

Zirconium has a very low and hafnium has a high thermal neutron-capture cross-section. Therefore, zirconium (mostly as zircaloy) is used as cladding of fuel rods in nuclear reactors, while hafnium is used in control rods for nuclear reactors, because each hafnium atom can absorb multiple neutrons.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} prison cells {{are found in}} the Castellania. The cells close to the court rooms hosted new cases and also those {{awaiting}} execution. Several other cells are located {{at the rear of the}} building, and they are surrounded by a courtyard. These cells generally housed inmates who had to serve a short sentence of less than eight days, usually due to unpaid rent or accumulated debts. Other convicts were those who refused to bake bread in Valletta which were jailed for a roughly a week and those found guilty of stealing to eat which were imprisoned up to three months. In some cases, individuals were imprisoned for not observing religious norms, such as eating meat on prohibited days. Prisoners with longer sentences were usually sent to other prisons, usually the Gran Prigione, and if in physical capability were subject to be sent to the galleys. Medical physicians were requested to visit the inmates in the prison when needed for multiple reasons related to their health and examinations. There were attempts to re-criminalize gambling during the late magistracy of Pinto as such activity led to undesirable financial consequences to participants but the widespread practice was instead strictly regulated, on fears that if banned it may be <b>of</b> <b>benefit</b> to the underground community.|$|E

Against Hale's wishes, the Commission called for the abolition <b>of</b> <b>benefit</b> of clergy, and the acquittal of those charged with justified homicide.

5|$|Frequent nosebleeds can be {{prevented}} in part by keeping the nostrils moist, and by applying saline solution, estrogen-containing creams or tranexamic acid; these have few side effects and may have a small degree <b>of</b> <b>benefit.</b> A number of additional modalities {{has been used to}} prevent recurrent bleeding if simple measures are unsuccessful. Medical therapies include oral tranexamic acid and estrogen; the evidence for these is relatively limited, and estrogen is poorly tolerated by men and possibly carries risks of cancer and heart disease in women past the menopause. Nasal coagulation and cauterization may reduce the bleeding from telangiectasias, and is recommended before surgery is considered. However, it is highly recommended to use the least heat and time to prevent septal perforations and excessive trauma to the nasal mucosa that are already susceptible to bleeding. Sclerotherapy is another option to manage the bleeding. This process involves injecting a small amount of an aerated irritant (detergent such as sodium tetradecyl sulfate) directly into the telangiectasias. The detergent causes the vessel to collapse and harden, resulting in scar tissue residue. This is the same procedure used to treat varicose veins and similar disorders.|$|E

5|$|Measures {{to prevent}} {{opportunistic}} infections {{are effective in}} many people with HIV/AIDS. In addition to improving current disease, treatment with antiretrovirals {{reduces the risk of}} developing additional opportunistic infections. Adults and adolescents who are living with HIV (even on anti-retroviral therapy) with no evidence of active tuberculosis in settings with high tuberculosis burden should receive isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT), the tuberculin skin test can be used to help decide if IPT is needed. Vaccination against hepatitis A and B is advised for all people at risk of HIV before they become infected; however it may also be given after infection. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis between four and six weeks of age and ceasing breastfeeding in infants born to HIV positive mothers is recommended in resource limited settings. It is also recommended to prevent PCP when a person's CD4 count is below 200cells/uL and in those who have or have previously had PCP. People with substantial immunosuppression are also advised to receive prophylactic therapy for toxoplasmosis and MAC. Appropriate preventive measures have reduced the rate of these infections by 50% between 1992 and 1997. Influenza vaccination and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine are often recommended in people with HIV/AIDS with some evidence <b>of</b> <b>benefit.</b>|$|E
5|$|No {{definitive}} antidote is available, {{but some}} specific treatments {{have been shown}} to improve survivability. High-dose continuous intravenous penicillin G has been reported to be <b>of</b> <b>benefit,</b> though the exact mechanism is unknown, and trials with cephalosporins show promise. Some evidence indicates intravenous silibinin, an extract from the blessed milk thistle (Silybum marianum), may be beneficial in reducing the effects of death cap poisoning. A long-term clinical trial of intravenous silibinin began in the US in 2010. Silibinin prevents the uptake of amatoxins by liver cells, thereby protecting undamaged liver tissue; it also stimulates DNA-dependent RNA polymerases, leading to an increase in RNA synthesis. According to one report based on a treatment of 60 patients with silibinin, patients who started the drug within 96 hours of ingesting the mushroom and who still had intact kidney function all survived. As of February 2014 supporting research has not yet been published.|$|E
