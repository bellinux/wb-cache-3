25|$|Much of {{the corps}} {{planning}} covered artillery, detailing the guns {{to move forward}} behind the infantry and their new positions. Artillery liaison officers were appointed to infantry units and field guns and howitzers were reserved to engage German counter-attacks. It was laid down that artillery supporting a neighbouring division was to come {{under the command of}} that division. For the first time all artillery was integrated into one plan. Planning for the Battle of Arras showed that command relationships, especially within the artillery (which had evolved a parallel system of command, so that General Officers Commanding, Royal Artillery at corps and division were much more closely integrated) and standardisation, had become more evident between armies, corps and divisions. Analysis and codification of the lessons of the Somme and the process of supplying the armies, made the BEF much less dependent on improvisation. Discussion and dissent between army, corps and division was tolerated, although it was not uniformly evident. Staffs were more experienced and were able to use a formula for set-piece attacks, although the means for a higher tempo of operations had not been achieved, because of the artillery's reliance on <b>observed</b> <b>fire,</b> which took time to complete. The loss of communication with troops once they advanced, still left their commanders ignorant of events when their decisions were most needed.|$|E
500|$|On 10 March 1917, Raven II and the [...] sailed for the Indian Ocean to {{hunt for}} the German Q-ship Wolf. For this mission she carried a Short Baby and two Short 184s. The two ships searched the Laccadive Islands en route to Colombo, Ceylon, which they reached on 2 April. They then searched the Chagos Archipelago and the Maldive Islands and {{returned}} to Colombo. Engine problems forced a Short 184 to make an emergency landing on 21 April in the Maldives; the crew rejoined the ship on 6 May {{after a series of}} adventures that inspired Rudyard Kipling's story [...] "A Flight of Fact". Raven II recovered the floatplane and its aircraft continued to fly search missions from Colombo until 21 May. She then joined a convoy bound for Egypt and arrived back in Port Said on 10 June.

2500|$|The new {{tactic of}} holding the front line with the minimum of men {{increased}} the burden on German artillery, which had to commence firing {{as soon as the}} French or British attacked but the extent of Allied artillery-fire forced the gunners to rely on flares from the front line instead of telephones. A field-gun regiment at the Nurlu–Péronne-Moislains–Templeux-la-Fosse crossroads covered the defences of St Pierre Vaast wood, [...] away, from open positions vulnerable to French shelling. The distance from the wood was too great for <b>observed</b> <b>fire</b> and when shooting from the map, shell dispersion made for a large beaten zone, which was impossible to correct and guaranteed that some shells fell short onto German positions, regardless of careful fire control and gun laying.

2500|$|... and the staffs of the 4th Army Gruppen (corps) {{agreed that}} mobile defence {{was to be}} {{replaced}} by a policy of fighting for every piece of ground. Armin thought that even if counter-attacks failed to recapture ground, the British would keep more troops in the front line and that German infantry casualties were no worse in counter-attacks than under British barrages. On 30 September, the 4th Army issued an operation order for more field artillery bombardments between British attacks and that at least half of the heavy artillery ammunition was to be used for <b>observed</b> <b>fire</b> on infantry positions in captured pill-boxes, command posts, machine-gun nests, on duck board tracks and field railways. Gas bombardments were to be increased on the British front line and artillery emplacements, wind permitting. Pillboxes were to be recaptured, defensive positions improved and the British infantry were to be harassed by patrols and diversionary bombardments. The British were to be compelled by spoiling attacks, to reinforce their forward positions and to counter-attack, during which they could be engaged by the German artillery.|$|E
2500|$|A 4th Army {{operation}} order of 30 September {{pointed out that}} the German position in Flanders was restricted by the local topography, the proximity of the coast and the Dutch frontier, which made local withdrawals impossible.

Gas bombardment was to be increased on forward positions and artillery emplacements, when the wind allowed.

2500|$|Ground holding {{divisions}} were {{reinforced by}} the [...] regiment {{of each of the}} [...] divisions, which were moved up behind each front division into the artillery protective line, which backed on to the forward battle zone, to launch earlier counter-attacks while the British were consolidating. The bulk of the [...] divisions were to be held back and used for a methodical counter-stroke on the next day or the one after and for spoiling attacks between British offensives. These changes were incorporated in a 4th Army operation order of 30 September. Operations to inflict greater losses on British infantry under the instructions of 22 September were to continue, with more bombardment by field artillery and by using {{at least half of the}} heavy artillery's ammunition for <b>observed</b> <b>fire</b> on infantry positions in captured pillboxes, command posts, machine-gun nests, tracks and field railways.
