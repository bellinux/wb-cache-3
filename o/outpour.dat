500|$|Obama was a {{participant}} in the 2014 midterm elections, held at a time where her popularity superseded her husband's {{to such an extent that}} it was theorized that she would receive a much larger <b>outpour</b> of support in campaigning. Reporting her travel to Denver, Colorado, David Lightman wrote that while Democrats did not want President Obama to campaign for them, [...] "the first lady is very popular". In May 2014, Obama was found to have a 61% favorable approval rating from a CNN poll, her husband coming in at 43%. In a video released in July, as part of an effort to encourage voter turnout, she called on voters to be [...] "hungry as you were back in 2008 and 2012". Obama appeared at a fundraiser in Georgia in September for Democratic senate candidate Michelle Nunn. Obama's approach to campaigning in Georgia strayed from discussing current events and instead broadly stressed the importance of registering to vote and turning out during the elections. Obama's infrequent appearances came from her dislike of being away from her children and Washington politics as well as her distaste for the opposition by Republicans to her husband's agenda and her view that Democrats in the U.S. Senate had not sufficiently been supporters of her initiatives to end childhood obesity. Obama raised her profile in October, touring three states in four days. Obama called the elections her husband's [...] "last campaign".|$|E

25|$|The Ochoa Point Member is {{interpreted}} to have accumulated {{as the result}} of continued tidal-flat sedimentation. The lower part of this member appears to have accumulated in the higher mud flat position of the tidal flat environment where periodic desiccation occurred. The upper part of this member is inferred to have accumulated in the deeper, or more seaward part of the tidal-flat environment. At the time that these tidal flats were covered by the initial eruption of the Cardenas Basalt, the eastern grand Canyon region was at or very near sea level. Features found in the lowermost part of the Cardenas Basalt indicate that the basaltic lavas <b>outpoured</b> over unconsolidated sandy and silty Dox sediments at the time they were wet. It is unknown whether these sediments were slightly above or slightly below water level at the time they were buried by lava. The high proportion of altered glass in and the pervasive fracturing (hyaloclastite) of the basal Cardenas Basalt support this interpretation. The high sodium content of the basal Cardenas Basalt indicates spilitization due to reaction with hypersaline water. Hematitic alteration of the sediment that resulted from baking by the lavas is minimal, amounting to a few centimeters or less.|$|R

They never would have such lodgers again, that was quite clear. After-life proved the truth of this melancholy prophecy, and Mrs. Clapp revenged herself for the deterioration of mankind by levying the most savage contributions upon the tea-caddies and legs of mutton of her locataires.

40|$|Extremely long basaltic {{lava flows}} are here {{presented}} and described. The flows originated from the great, polygenetic, fissural Payen Volcanic Complex, in the Andean back-arc volcanic province of Payenia in Argentina. The lava flows <b>outpoured</b> during the Late Quaternary {{from the summit}} rift of a shield volcano representing the first volcanic centre of this complex. One of these flows presents an individual tongue-like shape with a length of 181 km and therefore is the longest known individual Quaternary lava flow on Earth. Leaving the flanks of the volcano this flow reached the Salado river valley at La Pampa and, in its distal portion, maintained its narrow and straight shape without any topographic control over a flat alluvial plain. It has a hawaiite composition with low phenocryst content of prevailing olivine and minor plagioclase. Rare Earth element patterns are typical of Na-alkaline basalts, but incompatible trace element patterns and Sr -Nd isotope ratios, suggest a geodynamic setting transitional to the orogenic one. The flow advanced following the thermally efficient "inflation" mechanism, as demonstrated by a peculiar association of well developed morphological, structural and textural features. The temperature of 1130 - 1160 °C and the viscosity of 3 - 73 Pa*s, calculated by petrochemical data, may be considered, together with a very low cooling rate and a sustained and long lasting effusion rate, the main causes of the extremely long transport system of this flow. Both the extreme length of the flow and the partial lack of topographic control may provide new constraints on the physics of large inflated flows, which constitute the largest volcanic provinces on Earth and probably also on the terrestrial planets...|$|R
40|$|Stromboli volcano erupted {{suddenly}} on 28 December 2002 after a {{long period}} of typically persistent and moderate explosive activity. Lava flows <b>outpoured</b> from the northern wall of the NE crater and descended into the Sciara del Fuoco (SdF). On December 30 th, 2002, two landslides occurred on {{the northern part of the}} SdF, producing a tsunami that caused significant damage. This event led to the upgrading of the ground deformation monitoring system. The new requisite was the real-time detection of the deformation related both to the magma movements within the eruptive feeding system and to potential slope failures of the SdF. To this end, a remotely controlled monitoring system, based both on high-frequency (1 Hz) instantaneous GPS and terrestrial geodetic techniques (manual EDM measurements, transformed in automated terrestrial geodetic measurements) was planned and set up in a few months. During the recorded eruptive phases, the new monitoring system aided the Department of Civil Protection in making decisions related to hazards from landslides and volcanic activity and, more generally, on the evolution of volcanic phenomena throughout the eruption. The measurements carried out on the benchmarks located on the high flank allowed us to make some hypotheses on the dynamics of the craters. In particular, the behaviour of the EDM baselines, showing alternating periods of increase and periods of stop in length variation, could be linked to movements of the magmatic column within the craters. Moreover, the monitoring system gave us the opportunity to observe the effects of an effusive vent opening on February 16 th. The new geodetic network provided, for the first time, useful information on ground deformations due to shallow and very shallow volcanic sources at Stromboli...|$|R
40|$|Death is {{our most}} {{repressed}} consciousness, it inheres our condition as the primordial fear. Perhaps {{it was necessary}} that this angst be repressed in man or he would be hurled against the dark forces of nature. Modern ethos was built on this edifice, where the ′denial of death′ while ′embracing one′s symbolic immortality′ would be worshipped, so this ideology simply overturned and repressed looking into the morass of the inevitable when it finally announced itself. Once this slowly pieced its way into all of life, ′death′ would soon become a terminology in medicine too and assert its position, by giving a push to those directly dealing with the dying {{to shy away from}} its emotional and spiritual affliction. The need to put off death and prolong one′s life would become ever more urgent. Research using psychedelics on the terminally ill which had begun in the 1950 s and 1960 s would coerce into another realm and alter the face of medicine; but the aggression with which it forced itself in the 1960 s would soon be politically maimed, and what remained would be sporadic <b>outpours</b> that trickled its way from European labs and underground boot camps. Now, with the curtain rising, the question has etched itself again, about the use of psychedelic drugs in medicine, particularly psychedelic psychotherapy with the terminally ill. This study is an attempt to philosophically explore death anxiety from its existential context and how something that is innate in our condition cannot be therapeutically cured. Psychedelic use was immutably linked with ancient cultures and only recently has it seen its scientific revival, from which a scientific culture grew around psychedelic therapy. How much of what was threaded in the ritual and spiritual mores can be extricated and be interpreted in our own mechanized language of medicine is the question that nudges many...|$|R
