40|$|In dit boek rapporteren en becommentariëren we de belangrijkste resultaten van het onderzoek naar de evaluatie van de werking van participatieraden en lokale schoolraden in het basis- en secundair onderwijs in Vlaanderen. Dit project werd gefinancierd door het Fonds voor Collectief Fundamenteel Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek (M. I. 93. 10) en gebeurde in opdracht van het Departement Onderwijs van het Ministerie van de Vlaamse Gemeenschap. Een volledig, meer technisch, onderzoeksverslag, inclusief een literatuurstudie, werd door ons en Filip Bally eveneens gepubliceerd onder de titel "De werking van participatieraden en lokale schoolraden. Een evaluatie in het basis- en secundair onderwijs", eveneens bij Garant. Since the Participation Act (23 October 1991), {{free and}} {{municipal}} {{schools have been}} obliged to organise a participatieraad (participation council) chaired by the head, who has to be independent of the factions of the council. The factions represented in the participation council are: the <b>organising</b> <b>authority,</b> the staff, the parents and co-opted representatives of the local community. Moreover, in each school or group of schools, a local school council exists of four members elected by the parents. In addition, four members of local economic, social and cultural organisations are appointed by the parents’ representatives, and three representatives of the pedagogical council (‘pedagogisch college’) are co-opted by the two former groups. This book offers {{the results of the}} first survey about the functioning of these councils. Before the researchers organized a survey among the council members (N = 4, 298), they had conducted 12 case studies on the subject. The main questions answered in this book are: how are the councils composed; are the members of the councils satisfied with the councils and why; how high do the members appreciate the functioning of the councils; what is the influence of the councils on school-based management. nrpages: 131 status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The thesis brings {{together}} Íslendingasögur and srpske junačke pesme, two historically and culturally unrelated heroic literatures, literatures that had, nevertheless, converged upon a similar kind of realism. This feature {{in which they}} diverge from the earlier European epics - Beowulf, Nibelungenlied, La Chanson de Roland, {{is the focal point}} of this study. Rather than examining it solely in terms of verisimilitude and historicism with which it is commonly associated, I am approaching it as an emergent feature (emergent realism) of the non-linear, evolutionary dynamics of their production (i. e. their networked, negotiated authorship), the dynamics I call the distributed author. Although all traditional narratives develop in accordance with this dynamics, their non-linearity is often compromised by Bakhtinian 'centripetal forces' (e. g. centralised state, Church) with an effect of directedness akin to the authorial agency of an individual. The peculiar weakness of such forces in the milieus in which the sagas/Serbian epics grew, encouraged their distributed nature. As a result, they come across as indexes of their own coming into being, preserving, meshing and contrasting the old and the new, the general and the more idiosyncratic perspectives on past events and characters. In so doing they fail to arouse in the recipient the feeling of being addressed and possibly manipulated by an all encompassing <b>organising</b> <b>authority.</b> As a consequence, they also impress as believable. While chapters one and two of this study deal with theoretical and aesthetic implications of the two literatures' distributed authorship and their emergent realism, chapters three and four illustrate the ways in which these are manifested in the rich texture of the past and the complex make-up of the characters. The final chapter summarises major points of the thesis and suggests the poetics of complexity as a term particularly suitable to encapsulate the two literatures' common creative principles.
