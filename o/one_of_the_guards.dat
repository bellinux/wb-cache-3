5|$|According to the Florentine Ambassador, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>guards</b> of the conclave, as of 10 August {{there had}} been three {{unsuccessful}} ballots, favoring Costa and Carafa, but in no way indicating Borja might be chosen. According to Sigismondo de' Conti, papal secretary and chronicler, the vote was unanimous on the fourth ballot, taken {{early in the morning}} on 11 August although Borja had only 15 votes prior to the accessus; other accounts say Borja received all the votes except for his own, which he gave to Carafa.|$|E
5|$|As {{the player}} makes choices {{throughout}} the game, the gameplay's plot is revealed. Besides affecting dialogue and story developments, {{the outcome of}} entire scenes (and in some cases, the outcome of scenes several chapters later) can be manipulated {{to a certain extent}} based on player choices. These choices are typically moral decisions made through Jodie's dialogue options, interventions with various characters, success or failure in her combat scenes, or psychic actions that the player chooses to have Aiden perform. Examples of choice-based outcomes are the chapter titled The Party, where the player is given the choice of unleashing brutal revenge toward a group of bullies or simply running away, and the chapter titled The Embassy, where the player can either engage in psychic information retrieval or can jeopardize the mission by forcing <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>guards</b> to commit suicide. Choices also determine the finale of Beyond: Two Souls, as any number of possible plot endings can be experienced by the player.|$|E

25|$|In Minas Tirith Pippin {{was granted}} an {{audience}} with Denethor, the Steward of Gondor, and Pippin volunteered for service {{out of respect for}} Denethor's son Boromir, who had died trying to defend Merry and Pippin from the Orcs. According to Gandalf, this gesture touched Denethor, who accepted the Hobbit's offer and made him <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Guards</b> of the Citadel. Later, when a despairing Denethor set out to burn his son Faramir and himself alive in Rath Dínen, Pippin rushed to fetch Gandalf, saving Faramir's life.|$|E

The guard was removed and the attack continued. B11 then had to pass under five rows of mines through then uncharted currents. Passing through the minefield took about five hours. After B11 hit Mesûdiye it took eight hours for the submarine to escape initially with any attempt to use the periscope resulting in heavy fire.|$|E
25|$|Meinhof's last {{appearance}} in court was on 4 May 1976 when the defendants requested to {{provide evidence about}} the participation of West Germany in the Vietnam war, claiming {{that this was the}} cause of their radicalization, and making the novel request to be granted the status of prisoners of war (see above). According to Jutta Ditfurth, the last days before Meinhof's death went smoothly. The prisoners (including Meinhof) spent their meeting time (30 minutes, twice per day) discussing various philosophers and political issues. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>guards</b> noted that they were laughing.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Judas Iscariot, {{another of}} Jesus' disciples, having {{receiving}} a bribe of thirty pieces of silver, leads {{a group of}} temple guards to the forest and betrays Jesus (by confirmation of his identity) with a simple kiss on the cheek. As the armed guards move in to arrest Jesus, Peter draws his dagger and slashes off the ear of Malchus, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>guards</b> and a servant of the high priest Caiaphas. Jesus, in turn, heals the ear as he reprimands Peter for his actions. As the disciples flee, the guards secure Jesus, and beat him during the journey to the Sanhedrin.|$|E
500|$|Dio {{included}} Domitia Longina {{among the}} conspirators, but {{in light of}} her attested devotion to Domitian—even years after her husband had died—her involvement in the plot seems highly unlikely.

25|$|Henley Park estate can {{be traced}} back to the Domesday Book, when it was held by Azor, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>guards</b> of Edward the Confessor. The land was later owned by Chertsey Abbey, who leased it to the de Henley family. The estate passed through many hands, {{including}} the English Civil War rebel, John Glynne MP. Later tenants included Lord Pirbright, who entertained King Edward VII, and Sir Owen and Lady Roberts. During World War I, the house was used as an auxiliary hospital, and in the mid 20th century the estate was developed as a factory. It has since been restored to residential use.|$|E
25|$|This story arc {{concentrates}} on the last days and death of Oscar Wilde (who is attended to by his trusted companion Robbie Ross) rather than on Cerebus himself, who appears {{in only a few}} pages. (The title refers to the gothic novel Melmoth the Wanderer by Charles Robert Maturin, a relative of Wilde's. Wilde adopted this alias during this period of his life.) Meanwhile, a catatonic Cerebus, believing Jaka to be dead, spends his days mourning on the patio of a café. In the last few pages of the story, after the main action had concluded, Cerebus overhears a conversation by two Cirinist jailers insulting Jaka. Enraged, Cerebus murders <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>guards</b> and then springs into action.|$|E
25|$|The {{ship was}} patrolled by two {{security}} guards, {{both of whom}} were supposed to patrol independently at least once an hour, or once every two hours later in the night, one being primarily responsible for the visitor pavilion and one for the dock. The guards were required to keep a log of their patrols, but after the fire the relevant page was found to be missing from the book. It was later found, already filled in reporting uneventful patrols of the site up to 7 am in the morning when the guards would have gone off duty. The alarm was raised when <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>guards</b> called the fire brigade; before this the two reported that they had smelled burning plastic and had been investigating to try to determine its source.|$|E

25|$|Despite these problems, 76 men crawled {{through to}} freedom, until at 4:55a.m. on 25 March, the 77thman was spotted {{emerging}} by <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>guards.</b> Those {{already in the}} trees began running, while a New Zealand Squadron Leader Leonard Henry Trent VC who had just reached the tree line stood up and surrendered. The guards {{had no idea where}} the tunnel entrance was, so they began searching the huts, giving men time to burn their fake papers. Hut 104 {{was one of the last}} to be searched, and despite using dogs the guards were unable to find the entrance. Finally, German guard Charlie Pilz crawled back through the tunnel but found himself trapped at the camp end; he began calling for help and the prisoners opened the entrance to let him out, finally revealing its location.|$|E
25|$|The Viet Cong Russian {{roulette}} {{scenes were}} shot in real circumstances, with real rats and mosquitoes, {{as the three}} principals (De Niro, Walken, and Savage) were tied up in bamboo cages erected along the River Kwai. The woman who was given the task of casting the extras in Thailand had much difficulty finding a local to play the vicious-looking individual who runs the game. The first actor hired {{turned out to be}} incapable of slapping De Niro in the face. The caster then found a local Thai man with a particular dislike of Americans, and cast him accordingly. De Niro suggested that Walken be slapped for real by <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>guards</b> without any warning. The reaction on Walken's face was genuine. Producer Deeley has said that Cimino shot the brutal Vietcong Russian roulette scenes brilliantly and more efficiently than any other part of the film.|$|E
25|$|In Europe, William Addis of England is {{believed}} to have produced the first mass produced toothbrush in 1780. In 1770, he had been jailed for causing a riot. While in prison he decided that using a rag with soot and salt on the teeth was ineffective and could be improved. After saving a small bone from a meal, he drilled small holes into the bone and tied into the bone tufts of bristles that he had obtained from <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>guards,</b> passed the tufts of bristle through the holes in the bone and sealed the holes with glue. After his release, he became wealthy after starting a business manufacturing toothbrushes. He died in 1808, bequeathing the business to his eldest son. It remained within family ownership until 1996. Under the name Wisdom Toothbrushes, the company now manufactures 70 million toothbrushes per year in the UK. By 1840 toothbrushes were being mass produced in England, France, Germany, and Japan. Pig bristles were used for cheaper toothbrushes and badger hair for the more expensive ones.|$|E

On <b>the</b> night <b>of</b> July 8, 1945, Private Clarence Bertucci climbed <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>guard</b> towers and {{took aim at}} the tents where the prisoners were sleeping. He fired 250 rounds from a light machine gun and managed to hit some thirty tents in his fifteen-second rampage. By the time a corporal managed to disarm Bertucci, six prisoners were dead and an additional twenty-two were wounded (three would later die of their wounds).|$|R
25|$|In 624 Abu Bakr was {{involved}} in the first battle between the Muslims and the Quraysh of Mecca, known as the Battle of Badr, but did not fight, instead acting as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>guards</b> of Muhammad's tent. In 625 he participated in the Battle of Uhud which ended in a rout by the majority of the Muslims. Before the battle begun, Abu Bakr's son Abdu'l-Rahman ibn Abu Bakr, who was still non-Muslim and was fighting {{from the side of the}} Quraysh, came forward and threw down a challenge for a duel. Abu Bakr accepted the challenge but was stopped by Muhammad. His son later converted to Islam and gained fame during the Muslim conquest of Syria as a fierce warrior. In the second phase of the battle, Khalid ibn al-Walid’s cavalry attacked the Muslims from behind, changing a Muslim victory to defeat. Many Muslim warriors fled from the battlefield due to fear or to plunder the spoils of war. So did Abu Bakr, however, he was among the first to return according to few Sunni Hadith. Ali Ibn Abi Talib, Talhah and a few other Muslims remained guarding Muhammad from the attacks of the Quraysh soldiers, majority of Shia and many Sunni Hadith agree to this. Criticisms of his lacklustre military achievements in comparison with the extremely accomplished Ali should be put into context: Abu Bakr was a middle aged man during these battles, was not a soldier but a merchant by trade, and had never seen battle before – it may thus be unfair to directly compare him with Ali in this regard.|$|E
25|$|After being cautioned by the Oba {{about his}} late night movements, Prince Aderopo visits the village bar, where he meets his {{childhood}} friends, Banji (Femi Adebayo) and Tawa (Kehinde Bankole); the trio discuss the coming independence and their pasts. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>guards</b> assigned {{to protect the}} prince deserts his post {{to spend some time}} with his lover, close to a stream. Afonja and Danladi question the traditional priest, Baba Ifa (Ifayemi Elebuibon) on their way out of the bar; he responds to their questions proverbially and says that the killer will continue to kill until he is satisfied. The next day, the dead body of the lover of the guard who fled his post is discovered. Danladi orders the arrest of Baba Ifa, which Afonja outrightly refuses to carry out; he is thus suspended from his job and replaced by his deputy, Corporal Omolodun (Fabian Adeoye Lojede). Corporal Omolodun, however, is eventually killed by the serial killer after trailing him along the bush-path, following the discovery of another body, this time of an Igbo girl. The girl's father, a farmer Okafor (Kanayo O. Kanayo), along with his tribesmen, capture a travelling Northerner, claiming that he is responsible for the death of his daughter. The accused man is taken into custody by the police, but still maintains his innocence. Danladi informs his superiors that he will be closing the case, since he has found the killer. As he is about to transfer the Northerner away from Akote, Okafor throws a machete at him, piercing his heart. Even with his dying breath, the man insists he didn't kill the girl. Okafor, who repeatedly affirms his actions as doing what a real man would do, is taken into custody. At night, the officers gather to celebrate the Inspector's impending departure following the presumed victory over the killer. Dandali is persuaded into drinking against his will. On his way out he hears someone whistle a tune he was earlier told by the Northerner to be from the killer. The killer approaches him but he is too drunk to identify the face, and is assaulted by the killer.|$|E
