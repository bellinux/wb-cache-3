40|$|Changes in {{metabolic}} clearance rate (MCR) and production rate (PR) of estradiol- 17 i 3 (E 2) and testosterone (T) were evaluated in crossbred boars averaging 35 ± 1, 91 ± 3, 118 ± 4 and 177 ± 6 kg at 80, 160, 260 and 560 days of age, respectively. A comparison of E 2 and T MCR determined in blood or plasma {{was made in}} castrate and intact boars at 180 days of age. In the two experiments. estimates of MCR of E 2 and T were consistently greater (22. 0 and 23. 8 %) in blood than in plasma. These differences were not influenced by age of boar or castration. The MCR (l’day. kg BW) for E 2 and T in plasma was greater (P< 0. 05) for 80 -day-old prepuberal boars than the three groups of <b>older</b> <b>boars.</b> Production rates of E 2 and T were lower in boars at 80 days of age than in <b>older</b> <b>boars.</b> Thus, {{a reduction in the}} MCR and an increase in PR of E 2 and T in the boar are involved in the increased concentrations of circulating steroids associated with puberal development. Difference in MCR, determined in blood and plasma for both E 2 and T, suggests that the contribution of the cellular component of blood to MCR studies in pigs should not be ignored...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Semen was {{harvested}} in two stages from boars aged 3, 4 and 7 years. In {{the first stage}} semen was collected at 2 and 3 day intervals {{and in the second}} stage after 7 days. The quality of ejaculates collected twice a week increases with boar age from 3 to 4 years. After 4 years ejaculate quality is reduced. Semen collected once a week has a higher concentration and the spermatozoa an increased motility. Sperm motility is remarkable especially in boars aged 5 and 7 years. A decrease in collection frequency does not alter the dynamic of ejaculate volume and the 4 years <b>old</b> <b>boars</b> are still the most valuable, independent of frequency. The boars’ usage for semen collection can be prolonged if the animals maintain their reproductive ability...|$|R

The next day Mr. Skipwith, with two natives, went out to reconnoitre, and soon returned at full speed, saying that the natives were crossing the river.

60|$|Her information, however, did {{not extend}} far back into antiquity. She could throw no light upon {{the history of the}} Boar's Head from the time that Dame Quickly espoused the valiant Pistol until the great fire of London when it was {{unfortunately}} burnt down. It was soon rebuilt, and continued to flourish under the old name and sign, until a dying landlord, struck with remorse for double scores, bad measures, and other iniquities which are incident to the sinful race of publicans, endeavored to make his peace with Heaven by bequeathing the tavern to St. Michael's Church, Crooked Lane, toward the supporting of a chaplain. For some time the vestry meetings were regularly held there, but it was observed that the <b>old</b> <b>Boar</b> never held up his head under church government. He gradually declined, and finally gave his last gasp about thirty years since. The tavern was then turned into shops; but she informed me that a picture of it was still preserved in St. Michael's Church, which stood just in the rear. To get a sight of this picture was now my determination; so, having informed myself of the abode of the sexton, I took my leave of the venerable chronicler of Eastcheap, my visit having doubtless raised greatly her opinion of her legendary lore and furnished an important incident in the history of her life.|$|E
60|$|To {{this she}} {{answered}} {{there were other}} sorts, and she had seen one with her own eyes. She had gone one day alone to the next bay, and, perhaps, got too near {{the margin of the}} bad place. The boughs of the high bush overshadowed her from the cant of the hill, but she herself was outside on a flat place, very stony and growing full of young mummy-apples four and five feet high. It was a dark day in the rainy season, and now there came squalls that tore off the leaves and sent them flying, and now it was all still as in a house. It was in one of these still times that a whole gang of birds and flying foxes came pegging out of the bush like creatures frightened. Presently after she heard a rustle nearer hand, and saw, coming out of the margin of the trees, among the mummy-apples, the appearance of a lean grey <b>old</b> <b>boar.</b> It seemed to think as it came, like a person; and all of a sudden, as she looked at it coming, she was aware it was no boar but a thing that was a man with a man’s thoughts. At that she ran, and the pig after her, and as the pig ran it holla’d aloud, so that the place rang with it.|$|E
6000|$|The {{males of}} some few quadrupeds possess organs or parts {{developed}} solely {{as a means}} of defence against the attacks of other males. Some kinds of deer use, as we have seen, the upper branches of their horns chiefly or exclusively for defending themselves; and the Oryx antelope, as I am informed by Mr. Bartlett, fences most skilfully with his long, gently curved horns; but these are likewise used as organs of offence. The same observer remarks that rhinoceroses in fighting, parry each other's sidelong blows with their horns, which clatter loudly together, as do the tusks of boars. Although wild boars fight desperately, they seldom, according to Brehm, receive fatal wounds, as the blows fall on each other's tusks, or on the layer of gristly skin covering the shoulder, called by the German hunters, the shield; and here we have a part specially modified for defence. With boars in the prime of life (Fig. 65) the tusks in the lower jaw are used for fighting, but they become in old age, as Brehm states, so much curved inwards and upwards over the snout that they can no longer be used in this way. They may, however, still serve, and even more effectively, {{as a means of}} defence. In compensation for the loss of the lower tusks as weapons of offence, those in the upper jaw, which always project a little laterally, increase in old age so much in length and curve so much upwards that they can be used for attack. Nevertheless, an <b>old</b> <b>boar</b> is not so dangerous to man as one at the age of six or seven years. (39. Brehm, 'Thierleben,' B. ii. ss. 729-732.) ...|$|E
40|$|Huntington's disease (HD) is an {{inherited}} autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder {{caused by an}} unstable expansion of the CAG repeat sequence within the huntingtin gene. Huntingtin associates with ubiquitin-proteasome system that ensures degradation of particular proteins including β-catenin which is an important molecule whose equilibrated degradation {{is necessary for the}} proper functioning of the Wnt signaling pathway. The binding of β-catenin to the destruction complex is altered in HD, leading to the toxic stabilization of β-catenin. The main goal of my thesis was to determine whether the accumulation of β-catenin due to the presence of mutant huntingtin is also characteristic of Liběchov minipigs, a large animal model of Huntington's disease stably expressing N-truncated human mutant huntingtin. Using immunoblot and specific antibodies, we have revealed age-dependent accumulation of mutant huntingtin in transgenic minipigs. Unlike endogenous huntingtin, no decrease of the level of mutant huntingtin was observed in the striatum of transgenic animals. Surprisingly, this was followed by a decrease of phosphorylated β-catenin. Nevertheless, our results demostrate the accumulation of β-catenin in mesenchymal stem cells isolated from the <b>oldest</b> <b>boars</b> during ontogenesis.

40|$|Studies were {{conducted}} on 190 ejaculates collected from 16 Large White Polish boars, 7 - 8 months old. In order to examine spermatozoa morphology, an ejaculate sample was taken from boar monthly microscopic slides were prepared. In each preparation morphometric measurements were taken of fifteen randomly selected spermatozoa, using a computer image analysis software (Screen Measurement v. 4. 1), to determine basic sperm dimensions and morphology parameters. Moreover, evaluation of frequency of spermatozoa morphological abnormalities was made. It was found that boar age was associated with sperm dimensions and shape. As <b>boars</b> grew <b>older,</b> sperm length, width and head area increased. However, young boars, under 11 months old, had slightly longer spermatozoa than <b>older</b> <b>boars,</b> {{in terms of both}} the length of the whole spermatozoon and the length of the flagellum. The spermatozoa’s morphological build indicators show that boars aged 16 months approx possess semen that is characterised by an elongated head. This assertion is based on the proportions between the head’s width and its length. This proportion proved to be smaller when compared to that present in the sperm of boars over the age of 17 months (P ≤ 0. 01) ...|$|R

The boars were positioned in lateral recumbency and lidocaine (200 mg total) was injected into the testicle and scrotal skin. Castration of a single testicle was performed on two occasions. Sedation and reaction (to positioning and surgery) scores, pulse rate, respiratory rate, haemoglobin oxygen saturation, body temperature, arterial blood gas parameters and the times to immobility and then recovery were recorded. Atipamezole was administered if spontaneous recovery was not evident within 60 min of sedative administration. Data were compared with either a paired-sample t-test or a Wilcoxon-Signed Rank Test. There was no difference in sedation score, body temperature, respiratory rate and haemoglobin oxygen saturation between MDB and MDM. Mild hypoxaemia was noted in both groups. There was less reaction to castration after MDB. The pulse rate was higher after MDM sedation. The times to immobility and then recovery were similar.

Ejaculates of > 200 x 10 (6) sperm/ml and 85 % total motile sperm were extended to 30 x 10 (6) sperm/ml, stored at 17 - 18 °C and used within 12 - 24 h for artificial insemination (AI) of 2062 multiparous sows. After 24 h of storage, aliquots of diluted semen were assessed for sperm progressive motility (SPM), incidence of sperm chromatin instability (SCI), proportion of live morphologically normal sperm (LMNS) and head morphometry of LMNS. The results showed that young boars had higher percentages of SCI and lower proportions of LMNS than those of the mature (p < 0. 05) and old (p < 0. 001) boars, respectively.

40|$|The aim of {{our study}} was to {{describe}} the morphological changes in the boar testes affected with hypozincaemia that was induced by zinc-deficient feed (barley meal). Our experiment was carried out on eight (n= 8) 8 -month <b>old</b> <b>boars</b> of Slovak large white breed. For 100 days the animals were fed only barley meal and had free access to drinking water. Before inclusion in the experiment, all animals were examined for serum zinc level by the method of atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Zinc serum levels in boars determined before the experiment reached 20. 10 ± 1. 72 μM. After 100 days of feeding barley meal the zinc level was 8. 97 ± 1. 65 μM which indicated hypozincaemia. By day 20 after parenteral application of Zindep inj. (Biotika, SR), the level of zinc increased to 22. 13 ± 1. 45 μM and by 60 d it showed again a slight decrease to 18. 46 ± 1. 056 μM.
