She flirted because it was fun to flirt and wore a one-piece bathing suit because she had a good figure... she was conscious that the things she did were the things she had always wanted to do.

25|$|Obedience versus disobedience is a {{constant}} theme of the work. Obedience ties in the Jordan crossing, the defeat of Jericho and Ai, circumcision and Passover, and the public display and reading of the Law. Disobedience appears {{in the story of}} Achan (stoned for violating the herem command), the Gibeonites, and the altar built by the Transjordan tribes. Joshua's two final addresses challenge the Israel of the future (the readers of the story) to obey the most important command <b>of</b> <b>all,</b> <b>to</b> worship Yahweh and no other gods. Joshua thus illustrates the central Deuteronomistic message, that obedience leads to success and disobedience to ruin.|$|E
25|$|His {{method was}} the {{deduction}} of {{the propriety of}} certain actions from the consideration of the character and position of rational agents in the universe. He argues that all {{that we see in}} nature is framed so as to avoid and reject what is dangerous to the integrity of its constitution; that the human race would be an anomaly in the world had it not for end its conservation in its best estate; that benevolence <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>to</b> all is what in a rational view of the creation is alone accordant with its general plan; that various peculiarities of man's body indicate that he has been made to co-operate with his fellow men and to maintain society; and that certain faculties of his mind show the common good to be more essentially connected with his perfection than any pursuit of private advantage. The whole course of his reasoning proceeds on, and is pervaded by, the principle of final causes.|$|E
25|$|For we {{all agree}} that the most {{excellent}} man should rule, i.e., the supreme by nature, and that the law rules and alone is authoritative; but the law is a kind of intelligence, i.e. a discourse based on intelligence. And again, what standard do we have, what criterion of good things, that is more precise than the intelligent man? For all that this man will choose, if the choice is based on his knowledge, are good things and their contraries are bad. And since everybody chooses most of all what conforms to their own proper dispositions (a just man choosing to live justly, a man with bravery to live bravely, likewise a self-controlled man to live with self-control), {{it is clear that the}} intelligent man will choose most <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>to</b> be intelligent; for this is the function of that capacity. Hence it's evident that, according to the most authoritative judgment, intelligence is supreme among goods.|$|E

25|$|It {{was only}} in 1855 that the idea was raised of {{founding}} a school specifically {{for the education of}} sons of ministers like the Methodist Church in England had at Kingswood School in Bath. Funds were raised with significant amounts coming from the US and England. The original site for the school was to be in Portadown but the location was changed, first <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>to</b> Dublin. Land was acquired in Dublin but proceedings stalled. Several prominent Belfast Methodists began a campaign to have the school built in Belfast. The Methodist Conference allotted the remaining £2000 left from the purchase of the Dublin site to Belfast so long as they could raise £8000 extra with the added proviso that no building could take place until they had raised £10,000. A last attempt was made 1863 for the building to take place in Portadown but this failed. The necessary money had been raised by 1864 to satisfy the Conference’s stipulations but it was held that £10,000 would not be sufficient. Further fundraising missions were made to the United States and England in 1866. These were led by Robinson Scott, the Rev Robert Wallace and William McArthur. Wallace would die on this mission in Cincinnati from Cholera. However an additional £10,000 was raised. Several subsequent missions took place to fund building work.|$|E

500|$|In Scotland, James' Catholicism {{was less}} {{important}} than his rights as the Stuart heir to the Scottish throne. His unpopularity in England meant in 1681 {{he was sent to}} Edinburgh as Lord High Commissioner where he was warmly received. In August, the Scottish Parliament passed the Succession Act confirming the divine right of kings, the rights of the natural heir 'regardless of religion,' the duty <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>to</b> swear allegiance to that king and the independence of the Scottish Crown. It went beyond ensuring James's succession to the Scottish throne by stating the aim was also to make his exclusion from the English throne impossible without '...the fatall and dreadfull consequences of a civil war.' Using the Scottish Parliament to bypass resistance in the English House of Commons was a policy continued by James.|$|E
500|$|The {{figure of}} Third, {{seated on the}} highest throne in the hall, {{responds}} {{that there will be}} many good places to live, but also many bad ones. Third states that the best place to be is Gimlé in the heavens, where a place exists called Okolnir that houses a hall called Brimir—where one can find plenty to drink. Third describes a hall made of red gold located in Niðafjöll called Sindri, where [...] "good and virtuous men will live." [...] Third further relates an unnamed hall in Náströnd, the beaches of the dead, that he describes as a large repugnant hall facing north that is built from the spines of snakes, and resembles [...] "a house with walls woven from branches;" [...] the heads of the snakes face the inside of the house and spew so much venom that rivers of it flow throughout the hall, in which oath breakers and murderers must wade. Third here quotes Völuspá stanzas 38 to 39, with the insertion of original prose stating that the worst place <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>to</b> be is in Hvergelmir, followed by a quote from Völuspá to highlight that the dragon Níðhöggr harasses the corpses of the dead there.|$|E

The overall [...] section from Paw Paw to Battle Creek was dedicated on December 7, 1959. By the middle of 1960, US12 followed the I-94 freeway from Coloma to Watervliet and from Paw Paw to {{the east side of}} Jackson. It was also routed along the freeway from the west side of Ann Arbor into Detroit, where it followed {{the southern end of the}} Lodge Freeway. By the middle of 1961, the Watervliet–Paw Paw and Jackson–Ann Arbor freeway gaps were completed, and the freeway was extended westward to Stevensville; By the end of the year, I-94/US12 extended all the way to New Buffalo.
