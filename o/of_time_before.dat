5|$|Before {{the start}} of the 2004 season, Millennium Force's seat belts were {{modified}} because of an incident on the Bizarro roller coaster at Six Flags New England. The new seat belts were shorter and some riders had difficulties with them. The roller coaster's layout was repainted over a three-year period <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> <b>before</b> the 2011, 2012 and 2013 season. In 2012, the park added a new LED lighting system.|$|E

5|$|He claimed similar phallic {{triplets}} {{for several}} other texts. However, {{in the majority}} of texts glyph 76 is not common, and Fischer proposed that these were a later, more developed stage of the script, where the creation chants had been abbreviated to X Y Z and omit the phallus. He concluded that 85% of the rongorongo corpus consisted of such creation chants, and that {{it was only a matter}} <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>before</b> rongorongo would be fully deciphered.|$|E

According to The Tribune, it was the highest grossing Tamil film at that point <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>before</b> being surpassed by another Rajinikanth film, Chandramukhi (2005), although Rediff stated in 2014 that Padayappa record was surpassed by Ghilli (2004).|$|E

5|$|After Richard's death, King John of England {{failed to}} {{effectively}} defend Normandy against Philip's ongoing campaigns between 1202 and 1204. Château de Falaise fell to Philip's forces, {{as well as}} castles from Mortain to Pontorson while Philip simultaneously besieged Rouen, which capitulated to French forces on 24June 1204, effectively ending Norman independence. Philip laid siege to Château Gaillard, which was captured after a long siege from September 1203 to March 1204. As Philip continued the siege throughout the winter and King John {{made no attempt to}} relieve the castle, {{it was only a matter}} <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>before</b> the castellan was forced to capitulate. The main source for the siege is Philippidos, a poem by William the Breton, Philip's chaplain. As a result, modern scholars have paid little attention to the fate of the civilians of Les Andelys during the siege.|$|E
5|$|As Liquid, in REX, battles Snake, Gray Fox appears, destroys REX's radome, and is killed. Snake destroys REX and defeats Liquid, then escapes with Meryl or Otacon via an {{underground}} tunnel, pursued by Liquid in a Jeep. After their vehicles crash, Liquid pulls {{a gun on}} Snake but dies from FoxDie. Colonel Campbell, briefly ousted from command, calls off a nuclear strike to destroy evidence of the operation, and has Snake registered as killed in action to stop the US government searching for him. Naomi Hunter, who injected Snake with the FoxDie virus, tells him that he has an indeterminate amount <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>before</b> it kills him. Ocelot calls the U.S. President; he was a double agent whose mission was to steal Baker's disk of Metal Gear specifications.|$|E
5|$|As Petty gets {{further into}} his investigation, Rost's answers become more evasive. Petty {{suspects}} that Eric actually kills women for his snuff films, a suspicion further exacerbated when Rost {{says that he}} will relay Petty's contact information to the women instead of giving their contact information to Petty. It is not clear at the film's end whether Rost's films are actual snuff in the fictional subplot's context. However, {{it is known that}} he spies on them for a long period <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>before</b> asking them to participate.|$|E

5|$|At this point, relief {{arrived from}} an {{unexpected}} quarter—Maple Leafs owner Conn Smythe. The Depression had already forced three teams to either shut down outright or suspend operations never to return. Additionally, the New York Americans had been wards {{of the league}} since 1936, and it {{was considered to be}} only a matter <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>before</b> they folded (they eventually did, in 1942). Smythe {{did not want to see}} the Canadiens fold, and suggested that the Arena Company hire the Maple Leafs' former coach, Dick Irvin. Irvin was a proven winner, having led the Maple Leafs to seven finals and one Cup in nine years. The Arena Company readily accepted Smythe's suggestion, and turned to Irvin to lead the once-proud team's revitalization.|$|E
5|$|In February 2007, amidst {{speculation}} about his post-UN future, the Indian press reported that Tharoor might be inducted into Council of Ministers of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh as Minister of State for External Affairs. In the same month, an American gossip blog reported that Tharoor was {{a finalist for}} the position of dean of the USC Annenberg School for Communication in Los Angeles, but he withdrew his name from consideration at the final stage. Instead, Tharoor became chairman of Dubai-based Afras Ventures, which established the Afras Academy for Business Communication (AABC) in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India, the city in which he would go on to win two parliamentary elections. He also spoke around the world about India and Kerala, where he spent increasing amounts <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>before</b> moving for good to India in October 2008.|$|E

Toby points out to Jim {{that it is not}} fair to tell Pam that he needs an indeterminate amount <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>before</b> Athlead pays off for the family; Pam vents to Nellie that Jim is always making unilateral decisions involving her and they each agree they are not leaving Philly for Scranton or vice versa. The Halperts leave the office looking sad and awkward together.|$|E

Anderson proposed to Jovovich in 2003, but the two separated for a period <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>before</b> becoming a couple again. On November 3, 2007, Jovovich gave birth to their first child, daughter Ever Gabo. The child was born at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California. Their second child, daughter Dashiel Edan, was born on April 1, 2015.|$|E
5|$|Much more ancient {{than the}} {{upstream}} mountains are the exotic terranes of the Klamath Mountains to the west. Not until plate tectonics separated North America from Europe and North Africa {{and pushed it}} westward did the continent acquire, bit by bit, what became the Pacific Northwest, including Oregon. The Klamath Mountains consist of multiple terranes—former volcanic islands and coral reefs and bits of subduction zones, mantle, and seafloor—that merged offshore over vast stretches <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>before</b> colliding with North America as a single block about 150 to 130million years ago. Much of the Rogue River watershed, including the Rogue River canyon, the Kalmiopsis Wilderness, the Illinois River basin, and Mount Ashland, are composed of exotic terranes.|$|E
5|$|NBN {{was one of}} many {{stations}} {{opposed to}} aggregation, and offered an alternative by opening up a second station which it would operate for a period <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>before</b> selling it. This proposal was however rejected, and aggregation occurred on 31 December 1991, with NBN acquiring Nine Network affiliation. Following aggregation, the station's coverage expanded to cover all of northern New South Wales, whilst concurrently programming extended to twenty-four hours in a day, in stereophonic sound. In 1994, NBN Television's logo was updated to a pseudo-Nine logo, similar to fellow affiliate WIN Television.|$|E

5|$|SpiceJet {{began the}} same Mysore–Bangalore–Chennai route in January 2013. The airline {{suspended}} the service in July 2014 {{because of low}} passenger traffic. After speaking with local stakeholders and members of government, SpiceJet returned to Mysore for brief periods <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>before</b> finally cancelling all services in October of the same year. Service returned {{with the arrival of}} Air India Regional in September 2015; the operation was subsidised by the state government. The airline's Bangalore flights had extremely low passenger loads, which some passengers attributed to the inconvenient timings. Air India ended the service two months later when the subsidy arrangement expired.|$|E
5|$|The Olympic Charter {{requires}} that an athlete {{be a national}} {{of the country for}} which they compete. Dual nationals may compete for either country, as long as three years have passed since the competitor competed for the former country. However, if the NOCs and IF involved agree, then the IOC Executive Board may reduce or cancel this period. This waiting period exists only for athletes who previously competed for one nation and want to compete for another. If an athlete gains a new or second nationality, then they do not need to wait any designated amount <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>before</b> participating for the new or second nation. The IOC is only concerned with issues of citizenship and nationality after individual nations have granted citizenship to athletes.|$|E
5|$|The Ordinances {{were never}} again reissued, and {{therefore}} hold no permanent {{position in the}} legal history of England {{in the way that}} Magna Carta, for instance, does. The criticism has been against the conservative focus of the barons' role in national politics, ignoring the ascendancy of the commons. Yet the document, and the movement behind it, reflected new political developments in its emphasis on how assent was to be obtained by the barons in parliament. It was only a matter <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>before</b> it was generally acknowledged that the Commons were an integral part of that institution.|$|E
