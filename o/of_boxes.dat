5|$|BoxBoy! is {{a puzzle}} {{platform}} video {{game in which}} players control a square-shaped character named Qbby. The goal {{of the game is}} to guide Qbby through a series of obstacle-filled stages that are divided into sets called worlds. Each world is focussed on a particular gameplay theme; for example one world introduces stages that contain deadly lasers, and another introduces cranes for transporting Qbby around. The central gameplay mechanic is Qbby's ability to create boxes and make use of them to clear the obstacles. Boxes are created one at a time as a connected string and the maximum number <b>of</b> <b>boxes</b> in a string varies between each stage. Qbby can detach the string <b>of</b> <b>boxes</b> then push it to different positions. The boxes can be used to overcome obstacles, such as creating a bridge to pass bottomless pits or building staircases to reach higher platforms. Additionally, Qbby can keep the string <b>of</b> <b>boxes</b> attached to his body. He may then use the boxes as a shield to block hazards such as deadly lasers. He is also able to grapple onto ledges and pull himself up by retracting through the boxes. Creating a new string <b>of</b> <b>boxes</b> causes the previous string to disappear. If Qbby dies, he will respawn at a nearby checkpoint.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, {{a sequel}} titled BoxBoxBoy! was {{released}} for the Nintendo 3DS, allowing Qbby to create two sets <b>of</b> <b>boxes</b> at a time. The game was announced and released in Japan on January 6, 2016, {{and in other}} terrorities on June 30, 2016. A third game, titled Bye-Bye BoxBoy!, was released 2017. The game adds new kinds <b>of</b> <b>boxes,</b> such as explosive bombs and rocket propelled boxes, as well as box children {{that need to be}} escorted safely through levels. A physical compilation of all three games, titled , was also released in Japan the same day. The compilation also included a soundtrack CD featuring the music from all three games, as well as a Qbby Amiibo figure, the latter of which can be used with Goodbye! BoxBoy!.|$|E
5|$|Boxes play a {{prominent}} role in Crash Bandicoot: Warped and can be broken with all of Crash's techniques. Boxes contain helpful items or can augment Crash's mobility. Check Point boxes allow the player to return to a specific point in the stage upon losing a life. TNT Boxes explode after a three-second fuse when jumped on, while Nitro Boxes explode upon any physical contact. All of the Nitro Boxes in a level can be detonated at once if a green-colored box with an exclamation point (!) on it is touched; contact with this box is necessary in obtaining the level's Gem, as Nitro Boxes count towards the total number <b>of</b> <b>boxes</b> broken in the level.|$|E

5|$|Completing stages rewards {{the player}} with medals {{that can be}} spent on {{challenge}} stages, music, and costumes for Qbby. Additional medals can be earned by collecting crowns found on each stage, which must be collected before a certain number <b>of</b> <b>boxes</b> are used. The game makes use of the Nintendo 3DS' Play Coin feature; Play Coins {{can be used to}} request hints to the puzzle solutions. BoxBoy! features a black and white monochrome graphical style. The game features a minimal story, in which Qbby meets two additional characters, Qucy and Qudy, after progressing through certain worlds.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} attested {{examples of}} mathematical calculations {{date to the}} predynastic Naqada period, and show a fully developed numeral system. The importance of mathematics to an educated Egyptian is suggested by a New Kingdom fictional letter in which the writer proposes a scholarly competition between himself and another scribe regarding everyday calculation tasks such as accounting of land, labor, and grain. Texts such as the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus and the Moscow Mathematical Papyrus show that the ancient Egyptians could perform the four basic mathematical operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—use fractions, compute the volumes <b>of</b> <b>boxes</b> and pyramids, and calculate the surface areas of rectangles, triangles, and circles. They understood basic concepts of algebra and geometry, and could solve simple sets of simultaneous equations.|$|E
5|$|Ann {{comes to}} Leslie's house, and finds it full of stacks <b>of</b> <b>boxes,</b> papers and garbage. When they find {{themselves}} unable to clean it, Leslie calls Maria Portlesman (Bonita Friedericy), who teaches cleaning courses at the recreation center. She declines payment and hints she would prefer preferential treatment when Leslie cuts the classes, despite Leslie's assurance this will not happen. When Leslie realizes she has not prepared any food for the party, she calls a culinary teacher from the recreation center. Later, at the party, Andy complains about Justin to April (Aubrey Plaza), who makes Andy happy when she proposes putting chewed up gum in Justin's pockets. Eventually, Tom's ex-wife Wendy (Jama Williamson) arrives. Tom expresses anger that Leslie invited her, especially because Ron is romantically interested in her. When Ron impresses Wendy by eating a hot red pepper, Tom attempts to eat a bigger one, but has {{to run to the}} bathroom in pain immediately. When Justin starts yawning, a worried Leslie calls in other recreation center teachers to make the party more interesting, including a belly-dancer, a fencer, a cartoonist and an origami teacher.|$|E

40|$|This article uses Oates’s {{distinction}} between drama {{and what is}} real to explore the culture <b>of</b> <b>boxing</b> and its continuing, if contradictory, appeal through different cultural forms. Boxing poses a cultural dilemma and raises questions about how something so apparently brutal retains its hold on contemporary culture. The material properties <b>of</b> <b>boxing</b> invoke the senses and prioritize corporeal, enfleshed engagement. Oates also applies the notion of authenticity to men’s boxing. Thus {{the focus of this}} article is upon the capacities <b>of</b> <b>boxing</b> and its affects and the particularities of the event <b>of</b> <b>boxing</b> which make its dramas real, wherever they are enacted, as well as the forces in play which create particular versions of masculinity which are enmeshed with the affects <b>of</b> <b>boxing...</b>|$|R
5|$|Back in Scranton, Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) and Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) {{are both}} trying to sell girl scout cookies for their daughters. When Toby's {{requests}} clash with Darryl's, Darryl tells him they need their own sections of the office to sell {{to in order to}} not interfere with each other. Darryl takes accounting while Toby gets every other section. Darryl asks for accounting because Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) buys more cookies than everyone else put together. Toby eventually realizes Darryl's plan and the two end up fighting over who sells Kevin cookies, with Kevin coming up with absurd competition ideas. After doing a song and dance for Kevin, Kevin still can not make up his mind, so Darryl and Toby contemplate giving up until Kevin mentions he plans to buy hundreds <b>of</b> <b>boxes</b> of cookies, at which point continue the competition. They finally give up for good when Kevin wants to ride them like a pony, citing they still want to maintain their dignity and will not go beyond the limit to what they would do for their daughters. When they walk away, Kevin says he will doing any absurd thing for them to continue, kissing Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) to prove it, but they still refuse.|$|E
