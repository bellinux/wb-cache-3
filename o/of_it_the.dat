Increasingly, joint ventures and partnerships have been formed between and among domestic and foreign LCS firms to maximize cash flow as well as share the risks and rewards of program development. In this regard, the U. S. Army's transformation vision is being closely watched as the worldwide LCS Industry seeks to capitalize on this potentially lucrative initiative.

The team tested various languages, but became aware of another studio, Rebel Boat Rocker, which was receiving attention for its use of the Java language. Speaking to that studio's lead programmer Billy Zelsnak, Nihilistic decided to experiment with Java, having little prior knowledge <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> <b>The</b> language successfully integrated into the NOD engine without problems, providing a standardized and freely distributable scripting engine.

It's a quagmire if you go that far and try to take over Iraq. The other thing was casualties. Everyone was impressed with the fact we were able to do our job with as few casualties as we had. But for the 146 Americans killed in action, and for their families—it wasn't a cheap war.
