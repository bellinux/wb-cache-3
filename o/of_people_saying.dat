500|$|Tintin in the Congo was serialised {{under the}} French title of Tintin au Congo in Le Petit Vingtième from 5 May 1930 to 11 June 1931; it was {{syndicated}} to the French Catholic newspaper Cœurs Vaillants. Drawn {{in black and}} white, it followed the same formula employed in Land of the Soviets, remaining [...] "essentially plotless" [...] according to Michael Farr, and consisting of largely unrelated events that Hergé improvised each week. Hergé later commented {{on the process of}} writing these early adventures, stating, [...] "The [...] came out on Wednesday evening, and I often didn't have a clue on Wednesday morning how I was going to get Tintin out of the predicament I had put him in the previous week." [...] The strip's visual style was similar to that of Land of the Soviets. In the first instalment of Tintin in the Congo, Hergé featured Quick and Flupke, two young boys from Brussels whom he had recently introduced in another Le Petit Vingtième comic strip, in the crowd <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>saying</b> goodbye to Tintin.|$|E
500|$|Remarking on the band's {{goals for}} the [...] "Paranoid Android" [...] music video, Yorke said that, [...] "When {{it came time to}} make the video for that song, we had lots <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>saying,</b> 'Yeah, great, we can have another video like [...] "Street Spirit", all moody and black and dark. Well, no. We had really good fun doing this song, so the video should make you laugh. I mean, it should be sick, too." [...] Magnus Carlsson, Swedish creator of the {{animated}} series Robin, was commissioned by the band to make the video. Radiohead were fans of the show, and connected with the Robin character; Jonny Greenwood described him as [...] "affectionate" [...] and [...] "vulnerable", while Yorke admitted that he found Robin [...] "quite the vulnerable character, but he's also violently cynical and quite tough and would always get up again." [...] At first Carlsson sought to work on a video for [...] "No Surprises" [...] and was uncertain as to how to approach [...] "Paranoid Android". Eventually he devised a scenario to the band's liking after he locked himself in his office for over 12 hours to stare out of the window, while listening to the song on repeat while jotting down visual ideas. As Carlsson did not have access to the lyrics at the time, the concept for the video was based entirely on the song's sound. According to Yorke, the band [...] "deliberately didn't send Magnus the lyrics" [...] because they [...] "didn't want [...] to be too literal." ...|$|E
500|$|Hendrix {{was not as}} {{confident}} {{a singer}} as he was a guitarist, and because he strongly disliked anyone watching him sing he asked the engineers at Olympic to construct a privacy barrier {{between him and the}} control room. This created problems when the studio lights were low, and the engineers were unable to see him, making his visual cues and prompts difficult to communicate. As was the case at De Lane Lea, Hendrix's penchant for using multiple amplifiers at extreme volume drew criticism and complaints from the people living and working near to the studio. Olympic tape operator George Chkiantz recalled: [...] "Sometimes, it got so loud we'd turn the [...] monitors off and there was really very little difference." [...] Chkiantz noted that reactions to Hendrix's music were not always positive: [...] "I seem to recall a lot of musicians, a lot <b>of</b> <b>people,</b> <b>saying,</b> 'I can't see what all the fuss is about myself', or 'I don't know how you listen to all that noise; I'd be scared to work with him'... Chas was convinced that he was on to something. Not everyone was convinced that Chas was right." [...] Another issue that complicated the sessions were the large number of female fans who would show up at the studio wanting to watch the Experience record. As a habit, Hendrix would indiscriminately tell people where they would be on any given day, which led to large groups of fans following him everywhere. Olympic employees were tasked with keeping them under control and at a safe distance so as to not unduly burden the recording process. Chkiantz commented: [...] "It was extraordinary. I worked with the Stones. I worked with the Beatles. I worked with Led Zeppelin. I was not as jumpy; it was not as difficult as with Hendrix. It was something of an open house. Hendrix was not difficult at all, but I personally would have preferred not to have loads of girls lurking in the woodwork." ...|$|E

2500|$|But, {{subsequent}} {{studies showed}} {{that the number of}} genetic markers used and the number of samples (<b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>saying</b> Cohen) were not big enough. [...] The last study, conducted in 2009 by Hammer and Behar et al., says 20 of the 21 Cohen haplogroups have no single common haplogroup; five haplogroups comprise 79.5% of all haplogroups of Cohen. Among these first 5 haplogroups, J-P58 * (or J1E) accounts for 46.1% of Cohen and the second major haplogroup, J-M410 or J2am accounts for 14.4%. Hammer and Behar have redefined an extended MHC haplotype as determined by a set of 12 markers and having as [...] "background" [...] haplogroup determining the most important lines J1E (46.1%). This haplotype is absent among non-Jews in 2099 analyzed in the study. It appeared there would be a 3000 ± 1000 years. This study nevertheless confirms that the current Cohen lineage descended from a small number of paternal ancestors.|$|E
