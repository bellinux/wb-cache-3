40|$|Accepted 13 Jun 2014. The {{wrapping}} and unwrapping of the nucleosome, {{which is}} a fundamental packing unit of chromatin, {{are tied to the}} regulation of gene expression. The accessibility of DNA within nucleosomes is controlled not only by chromatin-remodeling molecules, but also by chemical modifications of histones and DNA. Understanding the structural changes of a nucleosome during epigenetic modifications is a key to unravel the mechanisms of gene regulation. Here, we reconstituted nucleosomes using methylcytosine- or hydroxymethylcytosine-substituted DNA, and analyzed their morphological features by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Our results indicate that cytosine methylation induces <b>overwrapping</b> of the DNA around the histone octamer, whereas cytosine hydroxymethylation has a lesser effect on the <b>overwrapping</b> of the DNA. These results suggest that two types of DNA modification yield different wrapping states of nucleosomes, which may contribute to the compaction and relaxation of the chromatin structure...|$|E

The search for hazards {{in the home}} and the postmortem investigation provided an insight into the possible mechanism of death. Instead of a diagnosis of simultaneous sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), the infants were determined to be victims of a combination of several environmental factors that led suddenly to death. Strong circumstancial evidence of nonnatural (accidental) death included sublethal levels of carbon monoxide (CO), <b>overwrapping,</b> and mechanical obstruction of upper airways. The literature concerning the phenomenon of simultaneous twin death is also reviewed. The simultaneous death of infant twins is a phenomenon that still evokes controversy and suspicion. The unusual nature of this curious occurence challenges the medical examiner, Police Departments, and society to determine the cause and manner of death.

40|$|Since the 1990 s, {{there has}} been an {{increasing}} trend to repair corroded or eroded pipelines, conveying oil, gas or water, by using fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) composites. This relatively new repair technique involves wrapping the corroded part of the pipeline with a so-called FRP <b>overwrap.</b> FRP materials are lightweight, have high relative strength and do not corrode, making them an effective repair solution. The viability of this repair technique has been proved by the numerous research programs which have been performed. However, most of the literature regarding the design of FRP <b>overwraps</b> does only consider a static internal pressure. In this thesis, the behaviour of steel pipelines, repaired with FRP <b>overwraps,</b> subjected to water hammer conditions, has been investigated. Water hammer is the occurrence of pressure waves in the conveyed liquid, due to abrupt changes to steady flow conditions, for example the rapid closure of a valve. An approximate dynamic model, describing the radial vibration of steel pipes with a FRP <b>overwrap,</b> due to water hammer conditions, has been derived. The model is based on the theory of thin-walled cylinders, and the laminate stiffness matrix for a FRP laminate. In order to take the steel pipe into account, the laminate stiffness matrix was modified. Basic water hammer theory was used to find the magnitude and velocity of the water hammer-induced pressure wave. These properties defined the exciting load in the dynamic analysis of the repaired pipe wall. The derived governing equation was solved analytically by applying boundary conditions and utilising the properties of Fourier series. This resulted in series expressions for the radial deflection and the pipe wall stresses, as functions of the distance from the valve, and time since valve closure. The model was also implemented on representative examples, with two different FRP materials; E-Glass/Epoxy and T 300 / 5208 Carbon/Epoxy, and the influence of the thickness of the FRP <b>overwrap</b> was investigated. For both these materials, the model predicted the maximum radial deflection, due to the water hammer, to decrease if the <b>overwrap</b> was thin, and increase if the <b>overwrap</b> was thick. The reason was found to be that the natural frequency of the pipe is significantly altered when a thick FRP <b>overwrap</b> is applied, because of its low density, compared to the steel pipe. As the FRP <b>overwrap</b> gets thicker, the water hammer-induced vibration approaches a state of resonance, increasing the amplitude of the vibration. The rate, at which the amplitude increases, with respect to the thickness of the <b>overwrap,</b> will depend on the density and stiffness of the FRP material. The increased amplitude nevertheless causes an increased maximum radial deflection, and thereby increased stresses. During the design of a FRP <b>overwrap</b> for a pipe which is susceptible to water hammer conditions, it will therefore be important to ensure that the changed natural frequency does not lead to unacceptable stresses...|$|R

To investigate their utility in this application, aluminum rings were <b>overwrapped</b> with thermoset/CNT yarn composite and their mechanical properties measured. CNT composite <b>overwrap</b> characteristics such as processing method, CNT/resin ratio, and applied tension during CNT yarn winding were varied to determine their effects on the mechanical performance of the CNT composite <b>overwrapped</b> Al rings (CCOARs). Mechanical properties of the CCOARs were measured under static and cyclic loads at room, elevated, and cryogenic temperatures to evaluate their mechanical performance relative to bare Al rings. At room temperature, the breaking load of CCOARs with a 10. 8 % additional weight due to the CNT yarn/thermoset <b>overwrap</b> increased by over 200 % compared to the bare Al ring.

Twenty patients, 17 Bedouin and three Jews, were diagnosed with HSES. The annual incidence of HSES for infants under the age of 1 year was 5 : 10, 000 for Bedouins and 0. 6 : 10, 000 for Jews. Patients ranged in age from 6 to 32 weeks and arrived at the hospital late at night or early morning (2 : 00 am to 11 : 00 am), during the winter or early spring (November to April). All were healthy before admission, with short prodromal symptoms of upper respiratory tract or gastrointestinal infection noted in 10 cases. Most infants had markedly high body temperature on arrival. A history of <b>overwrapping</b> and/or excessive heating was obtained in four of 20 infants. Bacteriological and virological cultures were negative in all infants. One infant died and neurological sequelae were observed in all survivors. The high prevalence of hyperpyrexia during sleep in the presence of negative microbiological results with no evidence of excessive heating, and the high incidence of HSES among a closed and culturally isolated society known to have a high incidence of congenital malformations, may support previous assumptions that HSES results from hyperpyrexia, originating in most cases from a 'physiological' heat induced trigger, which starts and peaks during the night in previously healthy infants who are genetically susceptible...|$|E

The goal of this research is to examine the potential of Raman spectroscopy as a method of condition assessment for carbon fiber composite materials. Carbon fiber composites are used in high performance situations such as <b>overwrapping</b> of composite over-wrapped pressure vessels (COPVs) in aerospace applications and hydrogen and natural-gas transportation systems. The composites will play a larger role in the future due to the materials high strength to mass ratio. There are currently limited nondestructive evaluation (NDE) technologies to evaluate these composite materials in-situ. NDE technologies will be critical for analyzing environmentally caused degradation that can reduce strength and service life of the materials. Variations in elastic strain in the composite material can manifest from degradation or damage, and can be analyzed using Raman spectroscopy. The characterization of active Raman bands and the strain sensitivity of these bands for commercially available carbon fibers are reported. Additionally carbon fiber/epoxy matrix strands and burst COPV samples are investigated. These results indicate that Raman spectroscopy has some ability to make strain measurements in commercially available carbon fibers. Such measurements have the potential {{to be used as a}} tool for NDE in inspections and reliability assessment of carbon fiber composite materials...|$|E

Reduction of spoilage in produce was attempted by means of chemical and. physical agents {{as well as a}} combination of both. The first phase of the work consisted of an evaluation of a number of chemical compounds with respect to their effectiveness in reducing post-harvest spoilage. The second part dealt with an evaluation of several transparent films applied to raw produce as wrappers and their effect on the keeping quality of the plant material until consumed. Finally combinations of surface disinfection and <b>overwrapping</b> were evaluated for effectiveness against raw produce spoilage. 1.

No segundo, os floretes foram colocados em embalagens de filmes de polietileno de baixa densidade (PEBD), poliolefínicos coextrusados (PD  941 e Clysar) e de policloreto de vinila, PVC esticável de 12 e 20 mm, envolvendo bandejas de poliestireno expandido mantidos a 5 ºC. Análises físicas, químicas, físico-químicas, microbiológicas e sensoriais foram realizadas. No terceiro, folhas de rúculas foram colocadas em embalagens de filme de polietileno de baixa densidade (PEBD), laminado de polipropileno/polietileno (PP/PE), poliolefínicos coextrusados (PD  900 e Clysar) e de policloreto de vinila, PVC esticável de 20 mm, envolvendo bandejas de poliestireno expandido e armazenados a 5 ºC. Análises físicas, químicas, físico-químicas, microbiológicas e sensoriais foram realizadas. As taxas respiratórias das couves-flores inteiras e minimamente processadas foram iguais em quaisquer das temperaturas estudadas e sempre decrescentes até o 16 º dia. A 1 º e a 5 ºC, tiveram a mesma taxa respiratória, diferindo das mantidas a 11 ºC. Na faixa de 1 º a 11 ºC, o Q 10 foi o mesmo para floretes e couves-flores; 2, 1 e 2, 2, respectivamente. Comportamento distinto tiveram as rúculas inteiras e as folhas soltas, pois, a 1 ºC e a 5 ºC, as taxas respiratórias foram significativamente iguais. A 11 ºC, a partir do 4 º dia, as folhas soltas começaram a apresentar taxas de respiração superiores às das inteiras, chegando a ser o dobro nos 14 º e 16 º dias de armazenamento. O Q 10 médio para as rúculas inteiras situou-se ao redor de 3, 54 e para as folhas soltas, 5, 74, na faixa de 1 º a 11 ºC. Não foi detectada produção de etileno. As embalagens para floretes de couves-flores tiveram pouca ou nenhuma influência em seu pH, acidez, ºBrix, luminosidade, croma, Hue e firmeza. A embalagem PD  941 foi a melhor por manter uma atmosfera modificada próxima à da recomendada para couves-flores (2 - 3 % O 2 e CO 2 < 5 %) e permitir menores perdas de vitamina C e melhores notas para vários atributos sensoriais de qualidade. Todas as embalagens mantiveram níveis de coliformes totais, bolores e leveduras bem abaixo dos limites permitidos pela Legislação Brasileira. As folhas de rúculas apresentaram níveis de coliformes totais ao redor de 10 5 UFC/g de produto no 10 º dia a 5 ºC, tornando-as impróprias para o consumo. Nestes 10 dias, as embalagens de PEBD e PP/PE se destacaram em relação às outras por reterem melhor a vitamina C e a coloração verde das folhas, por alcançarem melhores valores para sólidos solúveis, firmeza, presença de odor estranho, qualidade geral das folhas, deterioração e murchamento.

This work {{aimed at}} evaluating {{the effects of}} temperature on the metabolism of minimally processed and intact cauliflowers and salad rockets, and of different packaging materials {{on the quality of}} cauliflower florets and loose salad rocket minimally processed leaves. In the first experiment, intact cauliflowers, florets, intact salad rockets and loose salad rocket leaves were held at 1 º, 5 º and 11 ºC and their respiration rates, ethylene production and temperature quotients (Q 10) determined. In the second experiment, the florets were packed in low density polyethylene film (PEBD), co-extruded polyolefins (PD  941 and Clysar AFG) and in 12 and 20 mm polyvinyl chloride (PVC) <b>overwrapping</b> expanded polystyrene trays, and maintained at 5 ºC/ 85 - 95 % relative humidity for 14 days. In the third experiment, loose salad rocket leaves were held under the same conditions in bags of low density polyethylene film (PEBD), laminated polypropylene/polyethylene film (PP/PE), co-extruded polyolefins, PD  900 and Clysar HP and in expanded polystyrene trays overwrapped with 20 mm polyvinyl chloride (PVC). In the second and third experiments, physical, chemical, physical-chemical, microbiological and sensory analyses were performed. The respiration rates of both intact and fresh-cut cauliflowers declined over the 16 -day period and were significantly the same at all temperatures studied. At 1 º and 5 ºC the respiration rates were the same but differed from those (cauliflower and florets) at 11 ºC. From 1 º to 11 ºC, the Q 10 for the cauliflowers was 2. 2 and for the florets, 2. 1. In contrast, the intact and fresh-cut salad rocket respiration rates were the same at 1 º and 5 ºC. At 11 ºC, the fresh-cut salad rocket showed higher respiration rates than the intact ones as from the 4 th day. By the end of the experiment (14 th and 16 th days) the respiration rates of the fresh-cut salad rockets were twice those of the intact salad rockets, whose Q 10 was about 3. 45 from 1 ° to 11 °C as compared to 5. 74 for the fresh cut product. No ethylene production was detected by any sample at any temperature. The packaging materials had little or no effect on pH, titratable acidity, soluble solids, luminosity, chroma, hue and firmness of the florets at 5 ºC. PD  941 seemed to be the best packaging for florets, maintaining the atmosphere closest to that recommended for intact cauliflower (2 - 3 %O 2, CO 2 < 5 %), showing the lowest vitamin C losses and the best scores for several of the quality attributes. In general, all the packaging materials kept the yeast and mold counts low and the total coliform counts far below the maximum values permitted by the Brazilian Legislation, during 14 days at 5 ºC, except for fresh-cut salad rocket leaves, which presented 10 5 CFU/g total coliforms by the 10 th day, being inappropriate for consumption. For 10 day periods, PEBD and PP/PE were the best packaging materials for green color and vitamin C retention, higher soluble solids, firmness, lack of off-odors, overall quality, decay and shriveling.

No segundo, foram avaliados os aspectos microbiológicos após o corte e no 10 º dia, de dois tratamentos (uma e duas sanitizações), em rabanete minimamente processado mantido a 5 ºC (± 1 ºC) e 90 % (± 5 %) UR. As contagens de bactérias psicrotróficas no tratamento com duas sanitizações mantiveram-se abaixo do limite aceitável; no tratamento com uma sanitização obteve-se, no 10 º dia de armazenamento, 5, 8 x 106 UFC/g, limite máximo recomendado. Não foi detectada presença de coliformes totais e Salmonella. No terceiro experimento, estudaram-se dois tipos de corte (rodelas e retalhos) e três temperaturas de armazenamento (1, 5 e 10 ºC), por 10 dias, analisando-se taxa respiratória, produção de etileno e parâmetros físico-químicos. Após 12 horas do processamento obteve-se, nas raízes em retalhos, 0, 14, 0, 38 e 0, 70 µL C 2 H 4 kg- 1 h- 1 a 1, 5 e 10 ºC, respectivamente. No 10 º dia, as raízes inteiras a 1 ºC apresentaram a menor taxa respiratória (5, 72 mL CO 2 kg- 1 h- 1) e as raízes em retalhos a 10 ºC, a maior taxa (26, 71 mL CO 2 kg- 1 h- 1). Essas, também, apresentaram um decréscimo no teor de vitamina C. No quarto experimento, avaliaram-se embalagens de filme de PVC (14 e 17 µm de espessura) envolvendo bandejas de poliestireno expandido; filmes plásticos de polietileno de baixa densidade (PEBD) com 20 µm; e embalagens de tereftalato de polietileno (PET), mantidas a 5 ºC (± 1 ºC) e 90 % (± 5 %) UR por 10 dias, sendo realizadas análises de O 2, CO 2 e físicoquímicas. O teor de equilíbrio de O 2 nas embalagens de PVC foi de 12 e 11 % para as espessuras 14 e 17 µm, respectivamente. O PEBD apresentou concentrações muito baixas de O 2 (0, 08 % no 8 º dia), tendo como conseqüência processos fermentativos. Entre o 2 º e 10 º dia, o nível de CO 2 no interior da embalagem de PVC com 14 µm variou de 3, 43 a 2, 43 %; na PET de 1, 78 a 4 % e no PEBD de 12 a 15, 2 %. Os valores de luminosidade (L*), decresceram no decorrer do experimento, indicando escurecimento do produto. No quinto experimento foram estudados antioxidantes (ácido cítrico e ascórbico) em rabanete minimamente processado mantido a 5 ºC (± 1 ºC) e 90 % (± 5 %) UR por 10 dias, avaliando-se taxa respiratória e análises físico-químicas. O tratamento com ácido ascórbico apresentou a maior taxa respiratória nas 4 primeiras horas após o processamento. No 10 º dia, obteve-se 34, 18; 30, 54; 21, 31 e 2, 22 mL CO 2 kg- 1 h- 1 nos tratamentos com ácido ascórbico, ácido cítrico + ácido ascórbico, controle e ácido cítrico, respectivamente. Os valores de L*, de maneira geral, foram decrescendo ao longo do armazenamento. Os valores de a* mostraram que os tratamentos com ácido cítrico conferiram uma coloração fortemente avermelhada às raízes. Nenhum dos tratamentos evitou o escurecimento do rabanete minimamente processado. This {{research was}} carried out with the objective to determine the physicochemical, physiological and microbiological alterations associated to the fresh cutting of radish. Five experiments were evaluated. In the first, respiratory rate and ethylene production were evaluated in radishes shredded, and stored at 5 ºC (± 1 ºC) and 90 % (± 5 %) RH during 10 days. In the 10 th day, the fresh cut radishes showed respiratory rate 149 % higher if compared to the whole radishes (70. 35 and 28. 23 mL CO 2 kg- 1 h- 1, respectively). Ethylene production was not detected. In the second experiment, microbiological evaluations after the cut and in the 10 th day, were carried out in fresh cut radishes submitted {{to one or two}} sanitation and stored at 5 ºC (± 1 ºC) and 90 % (± 5 %) RH. The numbers of psychotropic bacteria in the treatment with two sanitations stayed on the acceptable limits. In the treatment with one sanitation it was obtained 5. 8 x 106 CFU/g in the 10 th of storage that is the maximum limit recommended. It was not detected the presence of total coliform and Salmonella. In the third experiment, it was studied two types of cut (slices and shredded) and three storage temperatures (1, 5 and 10 ºC). Respiratory rate, ethylene production and physicochemical parameters were evaluated during 10 days. After 12 hours of the processing, it was obtained 0. 14, 0. 38 and 0. 70 mL CO 2 kg- 1 h- 1 to 1, 5 and 10 ºC, respectively, in the shredded radishes. In the 10 th day, the whole radishes at 1 ºC showed the lower smallest respiratory rate (5. 72 mL CO 2 kg- 1 h- 1), while whole radishes showed the higher rate at 10 ºC (26. 71 mL CO 2 kg- 1 h- 1). Also, in the last treatment it was verified a decrease in the contents of vitamin C. In the fourth experiment were evaluated different types of packages in fresh cut radishes stored at 5 ºC and 90 % RH during 10 days. The packages used were: PVC films with 14 and 17 µm thickness <b>overwrapping</b> expanded polystyrene trays, low density polyethylene film (LDPE) with 20 µm thickness, and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Concentrations of O 2 and CO 2 within package and physicochemical analysis were evaluated. The equilibrium concentration of O 2 in the package of PVC was 12 and 11 % for the 14 and 17 µm thickness, respectively. The LDPE presented very low concentrations of O 2 (0. 08 % on the 8 th day), having as consequence fermentative processes. From 2 nd to 10 th day, the level of CO 2 inside the packing of PVC film with 14 µm changed from 3. 43 to 2. 43 %, in PET from 1. 78 to 4 % and in LDPE from 12 to 15. 2 %. The values of lightness (L*) decreased in all treatments during storage. In the fifth experiment, it were studied the use of antioxidants (citric and ascorbic acid) in fresh cut radishes, stored at 5 ºC and 90 % RH during 10 days. Respiratory rate and physicochemical analysis were evaluated. The treatment with ascorbic acid presented the higher respiratory rate in the first 4 hours after the processing. In the 10 th day, it was obtained 34. 18; 30. 54; 21. 31 and 2. 22 mL CO 2 kg- 1 h- 1 in the treatments with ascorbic acid, citric acid + ascorbic acid, control and citric acid, respectively. The treatments with ascorbic acid showed an increment in TSS content on the 2 nd day of storage. The values of L* decreased during cold storage. The values of the a* showed that treatments with citric acid presented a strongly red coloration in the roots minimally processed. None of the treatments have avoided the browning of the shredded fresh cut radishes cold stored...|$|E
40|$|Composite <b>Overwrapped</b> Pressure Vessels (COPVs) {{are used}} to store gases under high {{pressure}} onboard spacecraft. These are used {{for a variety of}} purposes such as propelling liquid fuel etc, Kevlar, glass, Carbon and other more recent fibers have all been in use to <b>overwrap</b> the vessels. COPVs usually have a thin metallic liner with the primary purpose of containing the gases and prevent any leakage. The liner is <b>overwrapped</b> with filament wound composite such as Kevlar, Carbon or Glass fiber. Although the liner is required to perform in the leak before break mode making the failure a relatively benign mode, the <b>overwrap</b> can fail catastrophically under sustained load due to stress rupture. It is this failure mode that is of major concern as the stored energy of such vessels is often great enough ta cause loss of crew and vehicle. The present paper addresses some of the reliability concerns associated specifically with Kevlar Composite <b>Overwrapped</b> Pressure Vessels. The primary focus of the paper is on how reliability of COPV's are established for the purpose of deciding in general their flight worthiness and continued use. Analytical models based on existing design data will be presented showing how to achieve the required reliability metric {{to the end of a}} specific period of performance. Uncertainties in the design parameters and how they affect reliability and confidence intervals will be addressed as well. Some trade studies showing how reliability changes with time during a program period will be presented...|$|R

40|$|This three-year project (FY 12 - 14) will {{design and}} {{demonstrate}} {{the ability of}} new Magnetic Stress Gages for the measurement of stresses on the inner diameter of a Composite <b>Overwrapped</b> Pressure Vessel <b>overwrap.</b> The sensors are being tested at White Sands Testing Facility (WSTF) where {{the results will be}} correlated with a known nondestructive technique acoustic emission. The gages will be produced utilizing Meandering Winding Magnetometer (MWM) and/or MWM array eddy current technology. The ultimate goal is to utilize this technology for the health monitoring of Composite <b>Overwrapped</b> Pressure Vessels for all future flight programs. The first full-scale pressurization test was performed at WSTF in June 2012. The goals of this test were to determine adaptations of the magnetic stress gauge instrumentation that would be necessary to allow multiple sensors to monitor the vessel's condition simultaneously and to determine how the sensor response changes with sensor selection and orientation. The second full scale pressurization test was performed at WSTF in August 2012. The goals of this test were to monitor the vessel's condition with multiple sensors simultaneously, to determine the viability of the multiplexing units (MUX) for the application, and to determine if the sensor responses in different orientations are repeatable. For both sets of tests the vessel was pressured up to 6, 000 psi to simulate maximum operating pressure. Acoustic events were observed during the first pressurization cycle. This suggested that the extended storage period prior to use of this bottle led to a relaxation of the residual stresses imparted during auto-frettage. The pressurization tests successfully demonstrated the use of multiplexers with multiple MWM arrays to monitor a vessel. It was discovered that depending upon the sensor orientation, the frequencies, and the sense element, the MWM arrays can provide a variety of complementary information about the composite <b>overwrapped</b> pressure vessel load conditions. For example, low frequency measurements can be used to monitor the <b>overwrap</b> thickness and changes associated with pressure level. High frequency data is dominated by the properties of the <b>overwrap,</b> including the fiber orientations and lay-up of the layers...|$|R
