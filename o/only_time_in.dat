This was the <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> the periodical's history that a South American first lady appeared alone on its cover. (In 1951, Eva appeared again with Juan Perón.) However, the 1947 cover story was also the first publication to mention that Eva had been born out of wedlock. In retaliation, the periodical was banned from Argentina for several months.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the custom}} of the times—that {{candidates}} not appear to seek the office—Tyler stayed home throughout the campaign, and made no speeches. Tyler received only 47 electoral votes, from Georgia, South Carolina and Tennessee, in the November 1836 election, trailing both Granger and the Democratic candidate, Richard Mentor Johnson of Kentucky. Harrison was the leading Whig candidate for president, but he lost to Van Buren. The presidential election was settled by the Electoral College, but for the <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> American history, the vice presidential election was decided by the Senate, which selected Johnson over Granger on the first ballot.|$|E

Between 1980 and 1984, the team played in Division 4 before winning promotion back to Division 3.

5|$|Matters {{changed for}} Barber in the 1932 season, when Yorkshire's regular, long serving opening batsman Percy Holmes began to suffer with illness. This left a batting place empty and enabled Barber to play more regularly. Wisden Cricketer's Almanack {{believed}} that he thoroughly deserved {{his place in the}} team as he scored exactly 1,000 runs at an average of 25.64, the first time he reached four figures in a season. He finished fifth in the Yorkshire batting averages, {{the first time he had}} been placed so high. His runs also played a part in Yorkshire winning the County Championship in his first full season. After this breakthrough, Barber steadily improved his total of runs and batting average, helping Yorkshire to win the County Championship twice in 1933 and 1935. In 1933, he scored 1,595 runs at an average of 33.93, and in 1934 he scored 1,927 runs at an average of 40.14. In both seasons he finished fourth in the Yorkshire averages. However, Barber's best season statistically was the following season, 1935, when he achieved his best aggregate of runs and highest average in an English season, passing 2,000 runs in a season for the <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> his career. He scored 2,147 runs at an average of 42.09 and finished third in the Yorkshire averages. These performances earned him selection for the Players against the Gentlemen at Lord's Cricket Ground for the <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> his career, where he scored 61 and 18 not out.|$|E
5|$|Of 234 {{representatives in}} the House, Breckinridge was one of 80 re-elected to the Thirty-third Congress. His {{relative}} seniority, and Pierce's election, increased his influence. He was rumored to have Pierce's backing for Speaker of the House, but he again deferred to Boyd; Maryland's Augustus R. Sollers spoiled Boyd's unanimous election by voting for Breckinridge. Still not given a committee chairmanship, {{he was assigned to}} the Ways and Means Committee, where he secured passage of a bill to cover overspending in fiscal year 1853–1854; it was the <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> his career that he solely managed a bill. His attempts to increase Kentucky's allocation in a rivers and harbors bill were unsuccessful but popular with his Whig constituents.|$|E

5|$|Pierce did not temper {{his rhetoric}} {{after losing the}} nomination. In his final message to Congress, {{delivered}} in December 1856, he vigorously attacked Republicans and abolitionists.

In {{the final days of the}} Pierce administration, Congress passed bills to increase the pay of army officers and to build new naval vessels, also expanding the number of seamen enlisted.
