25|$|The plot {{begins in}} 1992 with an elderly woman, Aliide Truu, {{who lives in}} a remote portion of Estonia. The woman had {{isolated}} herself from the surrounding society and watches the youth of her nation, including her daughter, leaving the countryside for the more urban regions and Finland. One day while looking <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> window, she discovers Zara, the granddaughter of her sister Ingel. Zara had been forced to partake in the sex trade by the Russian Mafia but escaped them. The only guide she had to help her find help, was a photograph from her grandmother with Aliide's name on it. The story then continues with a series of flashbacks which develops the relationship of Aliide and her sister, which hinged upon their competition for the love of Hans Pekk during World War II. The story ends as Aliide begins to reconcile herself with her jealousy of her sister and Zara's redemption from her disenchantment with the world caused by her sexual subjugation.|$|E

6000|$|As for {{my friend}} Bill, {{from being the}} pleasantest and most genial of fellows, he became a morose, misanthropic man. Dr. Franklin has a {{significant}} proverb,--"Silks and satins put <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> fire." [...] Silks and satins--meaning by them the luxuries of housekeeping--often put out not only the parlor fire, but that more sacred flame, the fire of domestic love. It is the greatest possible misery to a man and to his children to be homeless; and many a man has a splendid house, but no home.|$|E

The fire was nice and bright and on one of the side-tables were four very big barmbracks. These barmbracks seemed uncut; but if you went closer you would see that they had been cut into long thick even slices and were ready to be handed round at tea. Maria had cut them herself.|$|E

6000|$|Running {{into the}} bedroom as this fear beset me, I laid hold of my chest of drawers, dragged it into the passage, and threw it down against the door.

You expect they will be sold cheap, and perhaps they may for less than they cost; but, if you have no occasion for them, they must be dear to you. Remember what Poor Richard says: Buy what thou hast no need of, and ere long thou shalt sell thy necessaries. And again, At a great pennyworth pause awhile. He means that perhaps the cheapness is apparent only, and not real; or, the bargain, by straitening thee in thy business, may do thee more harm than good. For in another place he says, Many have been ruined by buying good pennyworths. Again, It is foolish to lay out money in a purchase of repentance; and yet this folly is practiced every day at auctions for want of minding the Almanac.[208] Many for the sake of finery on the back have gone hungry and half-starved their families. Silks and satins, scarlet and velvets, put <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> fire, as Poor Richard says.|$|E

6000|$|What you lay {{yourself}} open to my dear {{in the way}} {{of being}} the object of uncharitable suspicions when you go into the Lodging business I have not the words to tell you, but never was I so dishonourable as to have two keys nor would I willingly think it even of Miss Wozenham lower down {{on the other side of}} the way sincerely hoping that it may not be, though doubtless at the same time money cannot come from nowhere and it is not reason to suppose that Bradshaws put it in for love be it blotty as it may. It is a hardship hurting to the feelings that Lodgers open their minds so wide to the idea that you are trying to get the better of them and shut their minds so close to the idea that they are trying to get the better of you, but as Major Jackman says to me, [...] "I know the ways of this circular world Mrs. Lirriper, and that's one of 'em all round it" [...] and many is the little ruffle in my mind that the Major has smoothed, for he is a clever man who has seen much. Dear dear, thirteen years have passed though it seems but yesterday since I was sitting with my glasses on at the open front parlour window one evening in August (the parlours being then vacant) reading yesterday's paper my eyes for print being poor though still I am thankful to say a long sight at a distance, when I hear a gentleman come posting across the road and up the street in a dreadful rage talking to himself in a fury and d'ing and c'ing somebody. [...] "By George!" [...] says he out loud and clutching his walking-stick, [...] "I'll go to Mrs. Lirriper's. Which is Mrs. Lirriper's?" [...] Then looking round and seeing me he flourishes his hat right off his head as if I had been the queen and he says, [...] "Excuse the intrusion Madam, but pray Madam can you tell me at what number in this street there resides a well-known and much- respected lady by the name of Lirriper?" [...] A little flustered though I must say gratified I took off my glasses and courtesied and said [...] "Sir, Mrs. Lirriper is your humble servant." [...] "Astonishing!" [...] says he. [...] "A million pardons! Madam, may I ask you to have the kindness to direct one of your domestics to open the door to a gentleman in search of apartments, by the name of Jackman?" [...] I had never heard the name but a politer gentleman I never hope to see, for says he, [...] "Madam I am shocked at your opening the door yourself to no worthier a fellow than Jemmy Jackman. After you Madam. I never precede a lady." [...] Then he comes into the parlours and he sniffs, and he says [...] "Hah! These are parlours! Not musty cupboards" [...] he says [...] "but parlours, and no smell of coal-sacks." [...] Now my dear it having been remarked by some inimical to the whole neighbourhood that it always smells of coal-sacks which might prove a drawback to Lodgers if encouraged, I says to the Major gently though firmly that I think he is referring to Arundel or Surrey or Howard but not Norfolk. [...] "Madam" [...] says he [...] "I refer to Wozenham's lower down over the way--Madam you can form no notion what Wozenham's is--Madam it is a vast coal-sack, and Miss Wozenham has the principles and manners of a female heaver--Madam from the manner in which I have heard her mention you I know she has no appreciation of a lady, and from the manner in which she has conducted herself towards me I know she has no appreciation of a gentleman--Madam my name is Jackman--should you require any other reference than what I have already said, I name the Bank of England--perhaps you know it!" [...] Such was the beginning of the Major's occupying the parlours and from that hour to this the same and a most obliging Lodger and punctual in all respects except one irregular which I need not particularly specify, but made up for by his being a protection and at all times ready to fill in the papers of the Assessed Taxes and Juries and that, and once collared a young man with the drawing-room clock under his coat, and once on the parapets with his own hands and blankets put <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> chimney and afterwards attending the summons made a most eloquent speech against the Parish before the magistrates and saved the engine, and ever quite the gentleman though passionate. And certainly Miss Wozenham's detaining the trunks and umbrella was not in a liberal spirit though it may have been according to her rights in law or an act I would myself have stooped to, the Major being so much the gentleman that though he is far from tall he seems almost so when he has his shirt-frill out and his frock-coat on and his hat with the curly brims, and in what service he was I cannot truly tell you my dear whether Militia or Foreign, for I never heard him even name himself as Major but always simple [...] "Jemmy Jackman" [...] and once soon after he came when I felt it my duty to let him know that Miss Wozenham had put it about that he was no Major and I took the liberty of adding [...] "which you are sir" [...] his words were [...] "Madam at any rate I am not a Minor, and sufficient for the day is the evil thereof" [...] which cannot be denied to be the sacred truth, nor yet his military ways of having his boots with only the dirt brushed off taken to him in the front parlour every morning on a clean plate and varnishing them himself with a little sponge and a saucer and a whistle in a whisper so sure as ever his breakfast is ended, and so neat his ways that it never soils his linen which is scrupulous though more in quality than quantity, neither that nor his mustachios which to the best of my belief are done at the same time and which are as black and shining as his boots, his head of hair being a lovely white.|$|E

But late on the night of November 21, 2001, while driving home after 1:00 a.m., former Israeli paratrooper Paul Berman and his wife noticed suspicious activity in the Fentons parking lot. Employees were loading the jukebox and three gelato machines, along with $5,000 in cash, into a U-Haul truck. Berman called the police, who thought everything was normal, but upon coming back to the scene a few minutes later, saw the Creamery had been torched. The interior suffered extensive fire and smoke damage before being extinguished and the three employees involved were arrested on the spot. The day and night supervisors (Fernando Menses and Martha Pena, both 19) confessed to the arson and robbery, and went to prison, and the employee who was a 16-year-old minor served two months in juvenile hall.|$|E
