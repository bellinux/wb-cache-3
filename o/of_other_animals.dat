5|$|Most ferugliotheriids {{come from}} the Late Cretaceous epoch (Campanian–Maastrichtian ages, 84–66 million years ago, or mya) of Argentina, where they may have lived in a marshy or {{seashore}} environment. They coexisted with mammals such as dryolestoids and a variety <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>animals,</b> including dinosaurs. Ferugliotheriids may have been herbivores or omnivores.|$|E
5|$|Bigfin reef squids {{are also}} {{valuable}} sources for squid giant axons used in research in neuroscience and physiology. Unlike axons <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>animals,</b> squid axons are very large. Those of bigfin reef squids can range in diameter from 350 to 560μm (in {{contrast to the}} typical 1μm for humans). In life, these giant axons are used by the squids to coordinate escape jetting behaviour, enabling the squid to contract its muscles {{in a split second}} directly from the brain.|$|E
5|$|Epilepsy {{occurs in}} a number <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>animals</b> {{including}} dogs and cats and {{is the most common}} brain disorder in dogs. It is typically treated with anticonvulsants such as phenobarbital or bromide in dogs and phenobarbital in cats. Imepitoin is also used in dogs. While generalized seizures in horses are fairly easy to diagnose, it may be more difficult in non-generalized seizures and EEGs may be useful.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the remains}} of brain cases found in shell middens are broken {{and many of the}} bones found exhibit cut marks, it is assumed that the sea mink was hunted by Native Americans for food, and {{possibly}} for exchange and ceremonial purposes. One study looking at the remains in shell middens in Penobscot Bay reported that sea mink craniums were intact, more so than that <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>animals</b> found, implying that they were specifically placed there. Males were more often collected than females.|$|E
5|$|The La Colonia Formation {{outcrops}} in north-central Chubut Province, and the mammalian fossils {{come from}} the Mirasol Chico valley. The formation includes fluvial (river), deep-sea, and near-shore deposits, and the mammalian fauna probably comes from an estuary, tidal flat, or coastal plain. The La Colonia Formation also contains dryolestoids, such as Coloniatherium and Reigitherium, {{as well as a}} ferugliotheriid and the putative multituberculate Argentodites. In addition, the La Colonia Formation has yielded fossils of a wide array <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>animals,</b> including crocodiles, plesiosaurs, lungfish (Ceratodus), and dinosaurs (including Carnotaurus).|$|E

5|$|Genetic {{modification}} of animals to study disease. Transgenic animals have specific genes inserted, modified or removed, to mimic specific {{conditions such as}} single gene disorders, such as Huntington's disease. Other models mimic complex, multifactorial diseases with genetic components, such as diabetes, or even transgenic mice that carry the same mutations that occur during the development of cancer. These models allow investigations on {{how and why the}} disease develops, as well as providing ways to develop and test new treatments. The vast majority of these transgenic models of human disease are lines of mice, the mammalian species in which genetic modification is most efficient. Smaller numbers <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>animals</b> are also used, including rats, pigs, sheep, fish, birds, and amphibians.|$|E
5|$|Impala are symbiotically {{related to}} oxpeckers, which feed on ticks from {{those parts of}} the antelope's body which the animal cannot access by itself (such as the ears, neck, eyelids, {{forehead}} and underbelly). The impala is the smallest ungulate with which oxpeckers are associated. In a study it was observed that oxpeckers selectively attended to impala despite the presence <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>animals</b> such as Coke's hartebeest, Grant's gazelle, Thompson's gazelle and topi. A possible explanation for this could be that because the impala inhabits woodlands (which can have a high density of ticks), the impala could have greater mass of ticks per unit area of the body surface. Another study showed that the oxpeckers prefer the ears over other parts of the body, probably because these parts show maximum tick infestation.|$|E

5|$|In Batesian mimicry, a palatable, {{harmless}} prey species {{mimics the}} appearance of another species that is noxious to predators, thus reducing the mimic's risk of attack. This form of mimicry is seen in many insects. The idea behind Batesian mimicry is that predators that have tried to eat the unpalatable species learn to associate its colors and markings with an unpleasant taste. This results in the predator learning to avoid species displaying similar colors and markings, including Batesian mimics. Some species of octopus can mimic a selection <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>animals</b> by changing their skin color, skin pattern and body motion. When a damselfish attacks an octopus, the octopus mimics a banded sea-snake. The model chosen varies with the octopus's predator and habitat. Most of these octopuses use Batesian mimicry, selecting an organism repulsive to predators as a model.|$|E
5|$|Like other otters, the North American {{river otter}} {{lives in a}} holt, or den, {{constructed}} in the burrows <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>animals,</b> or in natural hollows, such as under a log or in river banks. An entrance, which may be under water or above ground, leads to a nest chamber lined with leaves, grass, moss, bark, and hair. Den sites include burrows dug by woodchucks (Marmota monax), red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), nutria (Myocastor coypus), or beaver and muskrat lodges. River otters also may use hollow trees or logs, undercut banks, rock formations, backwater sloughs, and flood debris. The use of den and resting sites is chiefly opportunistic, although locations that provide protection and seclusion are preferred.|$|E
5|$|Other {{studies by}} Taylor find that all {{tetrapods}} appear {{to hold their}} necks at the maximum possible vertical extension when in a normal, alert posture; they argue the same would hold true for sauropods barring any unknown, unique characteristics that set the soft tissue anatomy of their necks apart from that <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>animals.</b> Apatosaurus, like Diplodocus, would have held its neck angled upwards with the head pointing downwards in a resting posture. Kent Stevens and Michael Parrish (1999 and 2005) state Apatosaurus had a great feeding range; its neck could bend into a U-shape laterally. The neck's range of movement would have also allowed the head to feed {{at the level of}} the feet.|$|E

5|$|Species of the suborders Arixeniina and Hemimerina are {{generally}} considered epizoic, or {{living on the}} outside <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>animals,</b> mainly mammals. In the Arixeniina, family Arixeniidae, species of the genus Arixenia are normally found deep in the skin folds and gular pouch of Malaysian hairless bulldog bats (Cheiromeles torquatus), apparently feeding on bats' body or glandular secretions. On the other hand, species in the genus Xeniaria (still of the suborder Arixeniina) are believed to feed on the guano and possibly the guanophilous arthropods in the bat's nest, {{where it has been}} found. Hemimerina includes Araeomerus found in the nest of Long-tailed pouch rats (Beamys), and Hemimerus which are found on Giant Cricetomys rats.|$|E
5|$|A fictionalized memoir set in {{both the}} United States and France during the 1960s American civil rights movement, White Dog focuses on the events that occur after Gary and his then-wife Jean Seberg, an actress and an activist, adopt a {{handsome}} and clearly well-trained German Shepherd dog who comes back to their home with one of their other dogs. At first, the dog, which they name Batka, is an ideal new member of the family: intelligent, devoted, and quickly befriending the couple's assortment <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>animals.</b> To their dismay, they discover that the dog, a former Alabama police dog, was trained to attack black people on sight. Although they are told the dog is {{too old to be}} retrained, they take him to a black dog trainer to try. Instead, the man trains the dog to attack white people, including Gary himself. Gary states that he changed the ending of the American version to be more optimistic.|$|E
5|$|A {{powerful}} and versatile deepwater predator, the short, robust jaws of the kitefin shark {{give it an}} enormously strong bite. It feeds mainly on bony fishes (including deepwater smelts, viperfishes, scaly dragonfishes, barracudinas, greeneyes, lanternfishes, bristlemouths, cod and other gadids, grenadiers, deepwater scorpionfishes, bonito, snake mackerels, deepwater cardinalfishes, and sea toads), but also takes a wide variety <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>animals,</b> including skates, smaller sharks (Galeus, Squalus, Etmopterus and Centrophorus), squid and octopus, crustaceans (amphipods, isopods, shrimp and lobsters), polychaete worms, and siphonophores. Like the related cookiecutter shark, the kitefin shark is also capable of excising chunks of flesh from animals larger than itself, including other sharks and whales. The presence of fast-swimming fishes in its diet suggests the kitefin shark may scavenge, or have some other means of capturing faster prey. In the Mediterranean, bony fishes {{are the most important}} food year-round, with the second-most important prey being sharks in the winter and spring, crustaceans in the summer, and cephalopods in the fall.

5|$|Courville and Percy {{decided to}} test Tarrare's {{capacity}} for food. A meal {{had been prepared}} for 15 labourers near the hospital gates; although generally hospital staff restrained Tarrare {{in the presence of}} food, on this occasion Courville allowed him to reach the table undisturbed. Tarrare ate the entire meal of two large meat pies, plates of grease and salt and four gallons of milk, and then immediately fell asleep; Courville noted that Tarrare's belly became taut and inflated like a large balloon. On another occasion Tarrare was presented with a live cat. He tore the cat's abdomen open with his teeth and drank its blood, and proceeded to eat the entire cat aside from its bones, before vomiting up its fur and skin. Following this, hospital staff offered Tarrare a variety <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>animals</b> including snakes, lizards and puppies, all of which were eaten; he also swallowed an entire eel without chewing, having first crushed its head with his teeth.|$|E
