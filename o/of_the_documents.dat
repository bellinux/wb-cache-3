5|$|By {{the end of}} Henry's reign, Pain had {{witnessed}} over 60 royal charters for the king, spanning a period from around 1115 until 1135. Although Pain witnessed {{a large number of}} royal documents, this activity took place mostly in England, as few <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>documents</b> he witnessed were drawn up while the king was in Normandy. As a reward for his service, Henry gave Pain the lordships of Ewias Lacy and Archenfield, both in Wales.|$|E
5|$|Domniile române... was {{simultaneously}} {{published in}} Bucharest (by Editura Socec), Leipzig (Otto Harrassowitz) and Vienna (Carl Gerold). It was then reprinted {{by the official}} Editura Academiei press, {{under the supervision of}} historian Nicolae Iorga. The encounter was confrontational: Iorga decided to cut out entire passages where, he argued, the author had gone into too much detail. The intervention was unwittingly destructive, as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>documents</b> cited by Filitti, and only by him, have since been destroyed.|$|E

5|$|According to Moyzisch, the German Foreign Office did {{not make}} much use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>documents,</b> because {{officers}} there were divided about their reliability for several reasons. There was {{a steady stream of}} documents, which was highly unusual. Cicero seemed to have used sophisticated photography techniques to create unusually clear images, which raised the question of whether he acted alone. Antipathy between Papen and Ribbentrop added to the ineffective analysis of the intelligence. Aware of the Allied forces attempts to bring Turkey into the war, however, Papen was able to thwart their efforts for a time by threatening to destroy İzmir and Istanbul if Turkey declared war against Germany. Being able to postpone Turkey's alliance with the Allied forces and the use of their airfields, Papen told Ribbentrop that the way was now clear to take the Balkans.|$|E
5|$|By September 1954, the PBHistory {{agents had}} only {{managed to find}} {{a small number of}} top secret documents. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>documents</b> {{gathered}} showed that government officials and communist party leaders had been able to dispose of most of the sensitive material before they left. In the period of uncertain leadership that followed Árbenz's overthrow and preceded Castillo Armas' taking power, a member of one of the ruling juntas had prevented the Comité from searching the homes of private citizens, and from arresting them, which potentially reduced the number of sensitive documents the CIA had access to. Additionally, Castillo Armas stated after taking power that the intelligence information of the army had been completely destroyed.|$|E

He used this to concoct some plausible sounding and incriminating documents for Mậu.

5|$|Immediately {{after his}} coronation, Mindaugas {{transferred}} some lands to the Livonian Order – portions of Samogitia, Nadruva, and Dainava—although his control over these western lands was tenuous. There {{has been much}} discussion among historians as to whether in later years (1255–1261) Mindaugas gave even more lands to the order. The deeds might have been falsified by the order; the case for this scenario is bolstered {{by the fact that}} some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>documents</b> mention lands that were not actually under the control of Mindaugas and by various irregularities in treaty witnesses and seals.|$|E

5|$|Still {{awaiting}} imperial {{permission to}} build in the courtyard, the Perushim wished to rely on an old firman given to the Jews in 1623, which stated {{that there could be}} no objection to them building in their own quarters. Having received a supporting document issued by the Qadi of Jerusalem in March 1824, it was possible for them begin rebuilding the dwellings in the courtyard. In practice, however, construction never materialised as they were unable to exercise their authority over the plot of land. This was apparently due to confrontation with the Arab squatters and the local government's disregard <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>documents</b> proving their ownership of the courtyard.|$|E

Other sources of information on Urse are Domesday Book, which mentions his landholdings in 1086, and a number of chronicles, including William of Malmesbury's Gesta pontificum Anglorum, Florence of Worcester's Chronicon ex chronicis, and Hemming's Cartulary, a mixed chronicle and cartulary from Worcester Cathedral.
