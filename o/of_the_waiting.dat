5|$|An {{interior}} rearrangement {{was completed}} around 1942. The women's {{room for the}} main waiting room was moved from the east side to the west side, with one bay added to the west wing. A new dining area was constructed, occupying one-third <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> room, with its kitchen occupying the former bathroom space. The lunch cafe and staircases were also modified.|$|E
5|$|The main {{building}} designed by Lange is in historicism and was originally built in two stories in brick. A third was {{added in the}} 1950s, some {{with some of the}} original feel being lost in the addition, since it was not stylistically true. In 1965 two annexes were built, one on each side and in two stories. The western was used for offices and the other as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> area—these were both in line with the historicist style. They replaced a cargo expedition and a restaurant building, respectively. In 1995 the bus station was moved from the city center at Leüthenhaven to the central station, and the eastern annex was razed in favor of a postmodernistic glass and concrete building. In addition to the bus station it features and extension <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> area, offices, a restaurant and a parking lot.|$|E
5|$|By this time, {{many of the}} 1970s repairs were {{beginning}} to wear down, and the city put aside its plans for the maritime museum. The New London Railroad Company, fronted by historian Barbara Timken and local businessman Todd O'Donnell, bought the station from the city as the New London Railroad Company in 2002. The pair organized a second full restoration of the station, including a new slate roof, restored brickwork, and restoration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> room to its original configuration. The mezzanine level and basement atrium created in the 1976 renovation were removed. Additionally, mechanical systems were upgraded and various accessibility concerns addressed. The baggage room was restored for Greyhound use. Amtrak and Greyhound rent space from the company for offices and passenger waiting areas.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> {{two types}} of information, waiting duration information (how long consumers will expect to wait) and queuing information (one's position in <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> line), on consumers' reactions to waiting for services. An experimental {{study was conducted to}} examine three different variables: perceived <b>wait</b> duration, acceptability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wait</b> and affective response to <b>the</b> <b>wait,</b> as mediators between <b>the</b> two types <b>of</b> information and service evaluation. Results <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study show that <b>the</b> two types <b>of</b> information do not only reduce <b>the</b> uncertainty <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wait,</b> but also facilitate <b>the</b> reappraisal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wait</b> as more acceptable to consumers. The latter effect also resulted in a cross-over effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two types <b>of</b> information on service evaluation with different lengths of wait...|$|R

50|$|Musically {{inclined}} families {{tended to}} serve as waits, since this was more easily open to them than other musical occupations. The surnames Waite and Wakeman are derived from individuals who worked as waits. Ferdinando Gibbons was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Waits</b> <b>of</b> Cambridge; his sons Edmund, Ellis and Orlando became notable musicians. Some tunes are extant named after <b>the</b> <b>waits</b> <b>of</b> particular towns and cities, e.g. Chester Waits and London <b>Waits.</b> <b>The</b> usual instrument <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>waits</b> was <b>the</b> shawm; its loud and pungent sound suiting it to outdoor playing. They also in some cases played string instruments, and were also sometimes noted for their singing, as at Norwich.|$|R
5|$|On {{arrival at}} the {{terminus}} the mourners would be led either {{to one of the}} dedicated first class waiting rooms (for first and second class funerals) or to the communal third class waiting room. The coffin would be discreetly unloaded from the hearse and sent to the platform level by lift. Those attending first and second class funerals would be permitted to watch the coffins being loaded onto the train if they so wished. (After the relocation to the new London terminus in 1902, some funeral services would be held in a Chapelle Ardente on platform level, for those cases where mourners were unable to make the journey to Brookwood.) Each door <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> train would be labelled with the name of the deceased, to ensure all passengers travelled with the correct funeral party; the names of the deceased being carried on the train would be called in turn, and that person's mourners would board the train.|$|E
5|$|Tite and Cubitt's {{design was}} based around a three storey main building, {{separated}} from the LSWR's main viaduct by a private access road beneath the LNC's twin rail lines, intended to allow mourners to arrive and leave discreetly, and avoid the need for hearses to stop in the public road. The building housed two mortuaries, the LNC's boardroom and funerary workshops, {{and a series of}} separate waiting rooms for those attending first, second and third class funerals. A steam-powered lift carried coffins from the lower floors to the platform level above. Although the original London terminus did not have its own chapel, on some occasions mourners would not be able or willing to make the journey to a ceremony at Brookwood but for personal or religious reasons were unable to hold the funeral service in a London church. On these occasions one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> rooms would be used as a makeshift funeral chapel.|$|E
5|$|The French {{started their}} {{evacuation}} with their pre-conceived notion that few {{would want to}} head south. As knowledge of the migration program spread through the communist-controlled north, thousands of predominantly northern Catholic asylum-seekers descended on the capital Hanoi and the port of Haiphong, {{both of which were}} still in French control. This led to anarchy and confusion as the emigrants fought over limited shelter, food, medicine and places on the ships and planes that were bound for the south. By early August, there were over 200,000evacuees waiting in Hanoi and Haiphong. Initially the ad hoc camps had insufficient sanitation and water quality control, leading to the possibility of outbreaks of disease. Some American representatives said that they were the worst conditions they had seen. The conditions continued to be poor and chaotic after the evacuation got into full swing, and did not improve significantly for a month. There was no organization infrastructure as far as registration or medical records and immunisation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> evacuees. The communists thus sent their propaganda activists through the camps and said that the lack of organisation proved that life for prospective refugees would be even worse in the south, where they would be completely under the control of South Vietnam.|$|E

40|$|The authors {{conduct an}} {{experimental}} study to examine <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> {{two types of}} waiting information - waiting-duration information and queuing information - on consumers' reactions to <b>waits</b> <b>of</b> different lengths. <b>The</b> authors test a model that includes three different constructs - perceived <b>waiting</b> duration, acceptability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wait,</b> and affective response to <b>the</b> <b>wait</b> - as mediators between waiting information and service evaluation. Results show that though acceptability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wait</b> and affective response to <b>the</b> <b>wait</b> have a significant mediating effect on <b>the</b> relationship between <b>waiting</b> information and service evaluation, perceived waiting duration does not. Moreover, neither type of information has significant impact in the short-wait condition, whereas waiting-duration information has greater impact than queuing information in the intermediate-wait condition and a smaller impact in the long-wait condition.

25|$|In the 1990s, {{the current}} Pennsylvania Station was renovated by Amtrak, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, and New Jersey Transit, {{to improve the}} {{appearance}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> and concession areas, sharpen the station information systems (audio and visual) and remove much of the grime. Recalling the erstwhile grandeur of the bygone Penn Station, an old four-sided clock from the original depot was installed at the 34th Street Long Island Rail Road entrance. The walkway from that entrance's escalator also has a mural depicting elements of the old Penn Station's architecture.|$|E
25|$|Enclosed garden patios are {{on either}} side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> room, and {{passengers}} exiting the trains were originally directed through the southern garden.

If there is such an objection, the proposed civil partnership cannot be formed unless the objection is withdrawn or if the registration authority is satisfied that the objection ought not to prevent {{the formation of the}} civil partnership. Provided no objection has been recorded, or any recorded objections have been cleared, the registration authority must issue a civil partnership schedule at the request of either party upon the expiration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> period.

25|$|The {{race was}} wholly {{inspired}} by the very successful 1934 MacRobertson Air Race to celebrate the centenary of the Australian state of Victoria. However, whilst that race was open to all-comers, Schlesinger made the fundamental error of restricting the entry of the Schlesinger Race to British Empire crews and machines only. This led directly to a much smaller entry and only one machine successfully completed the course after many aircraft either failed, crashed or given up. Magazines of the time, such as The Aeroplane and Flight, were suitably scathing. MacRobertson Air Race winner C.W.A. Scott aided by Giles Guthrie won the race in a Percival Vega Gull, {{but it was a}} hollow victory, as most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> spectators at Cape Town had given up and gone home by the time he arrived.|$|E
