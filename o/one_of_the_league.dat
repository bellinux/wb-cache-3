500|$|Upon {{arriving}} in the NBA, Javie developed a reputation early for having a [...] "quick trigger finger", and he {{was believed to be}} <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>league</b> leaders in calling technical fouls during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Reflecting on his early years in the league, Javie told Sports Illustrated in October 2000, [...] "I'd get so mad I'd lose control for two or three minutes, and that's when I would miss calls." [...] Javie developed mentorships with referees Joe Crawford and Jack Madden to assist in the maturation process. [...] Working his debut game with Crawford at the Pontiac Silverdome in Detroit, Michigan, Javie received a grade of 40 points out of 100 by supervisor Darell Garretson. [...] While reviewing game film later at the hotel, Crawford noted errors made throughout the game by himself. [...] As a result of this film study, Javie learned that experienced officials make mistakes and admitting error will improve a referee's ability in the long-term. Ninety minutes after the conclusion of a game, Javie reviews game film. [...] In addition to film review, Madden taught Javie not to lose focus when players and coaches were upset, and to walk away from them rather than becoming angry. [...] Javie credited his mentors for success as a referee saying, [...] "My mentors have made me what I am today. I'm a little part of each of them. It's their success in teaching me." ...|$|E
