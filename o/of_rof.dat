50|$|An {{important}} application <b>of</b> <b>RoF</b> is its use {{to provide}} wireless {{coverage in the}} area where wireless backhaul link is not possible. These zones can be areas inside a structure such as a tunnel, areas behind buildings, Mountainous places or secluded areas such as jungles.|$|E
50|$|Some {{independent}} schools are also present {{just outside the}} borough. Most Chorley children go on to attend the nearby Runshaw College in Leyland. Runshaw College has also expanded into the former administration site <b>of</b> <b>ROF</b> Chorley and is using, amongst others, the main administration building.|$|E
30|$|In addition, a {{systematic}} review (Tsesis et al. 2010) showed {{the lack of}} evidence-based data to support {{the usefulness of the}} current clinical and radiographic evaluation methods for the diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>ROFs.</b> However, there are several clinical studies published in recent years, even though not of the very high level of evidence, to support the AAE’s 2008 statement regarding the alleged pathognomonic combination of a sinus tract and a deep probing defect for the diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>ROFs.</b>|$|R
30|$|ROFs {{are fairly}} common (Yoshino et al. 2015), with a {{reported}} prevalence of 11 % {{up to more}} than 30 % of extracted endodontically treated teeth (Tsesis et al. 2010 a; Rosen et al. 2012). In a recent study, Yoshino et al. 2015 evaluated the prevalence <b>of</b> <b>ROFs</b> as the main reason for the extraction of the permanent teeth. They evaluated a total of 736 teeth from 24 different clinics that were extracted from 626 patients during a 6 -month period. Of these teeth, a total of 233 teeth were extracted as a result <b>of</b> <b>ROFs</b> (31.7 %).|$|R
50|$|The Royal Arsenal {{designed}} many <b>of</b> the <b>ROFs</b> and {{was also}} the agent {{for the construction of}} all <b>of</b> the Rifles <b>ROFs,</b> the Medium Machine ROF and the Small Arms Ammunition <b>ROFs.</b> The Ministry <b>of</b> Supply, the Ministry of Works and two other private companies were agents for the construction <b>of</b> the remaining <b>ROFs.</b>|$|R

50|$|Approval for the {{construction}} <b>of</b> <b>ROF</b> Ranskill was given was granted in 1940; and it was built with the Ministry of Works acting as Agents. It was designed, as an almost self-contained, explosive factory producing Cordite, with its own acids plant. It {{was connected to the}} national railway network, with its own private sidings.|$|E
50|$|The sale <b>of</b> <b>ROF</b> Leeds to Vickers plc and {{closure of}} the Royal Small Arms Factory (RSAF), Enfield, both had their effects on the site: RO Leeds, causing a {{considerable}} amount of vehicle and vehicle-related work to come to Nottingham; and RSAF Enfield, causing the Small Arms Facility in South Shop to be created.|$|E
50|$|The {{small number}} <b>of</b> <b>ROFs</b> {{involved}} in nuclear weapons production, ROF Burghfield and ROF Cardiff, {{were removed from}} ROF management and did not pass over to Royal Ordnance upon privatisation. They were transferred to the control of AWRE; which later became the Atomic Weapons Establishment.|$|R
30|$|It is {{fundamental}} {{to understand that this}} extended definition <b>of</b> <b>ROFs</b> as a complication of RCTs does not imply that ROFs necessarily occur {{as a direct result of}} a practitioner’s procedural error (Hofer et al. 2000). While a procedural error can lead to complications, not every complication is associated with a procedural error, and some complications may occur even when all procedures were performed adequately (Tsesis et al. 2015; Hofer et al. 2000; Angelos 2009). Since ROFs appear in teeth with either poor or good quality RCTs, ROFs must be considered as a potential complication, not necessarily a direct result of a practitioner procedural error (Tsesis et al. 2015). Therefore, this extended definition better elucidates both clinical and medico-legal aspects <b>of</b> <b>ROFs</b> (Tsesis et al. 2015; Tsesis et al. 2010 a; Rosen et al. 2012).|$|R
40|$|We study {{limitations}} of polynomials computed by depth two circuits built over read-once formulas (ROFs). In particular, 1. We prove an exponential lower {{bound for the}} sum <b>of</b> <b>ROFs</b> computing the 2 n-variate polynomial in VP defined by Raz and Yehudayoff [CC, 2009]. 2. We obtain an exponential lower bound {{on the size of}} arithmetic circuits computing sum of products <b>of</b> restricted <b>ROFs</b> <b>of</b> unbounded depth computing the permanent of an n by n matrix. The restriction is on the number of variables with + gates as a parent in a proper sub formula <b>of</b> the <b>ROF</b> to be bounded by sqrt(n). Additionally, we restrict the product fan in to be bounded by a sub linear function. This proves an exponential lower bound for a subclass of possibly non-multilinear formulas of unbounded depth computing the permanent polynomial. 3. We also show an exponential lower bound for the above model against a polynomial in VP. 4. Finally we observe that the techniques developed yield an exponential lower bound on the size of sums of products of syntactically multilinear arithmetic circuits computing a product of variable disjoint linear forms where the bottom sum gate and product gates at the second level have fan in bounded by a sub linear function. Our proof techniques are built on the measure developed by Kumar et al. [ICALP 2013] and are based on a non-trivial analysis <b>of</b> <b>ROFs</b> under random partitions. Further, our results exhibit strengths and provide more insight into the lower bound techniques introduced by Raz [STOC 2004]...|$|R

The CTL realization of the majority gates used in the ROF architecture allows the filter rank and the window size to be user-programmable, using a much smaller silicon area...|$|R
5000|$|The new ROFs {{were to be}} {{built in}} areas {{regarded}} as [...] "relatively safe", which until 1940 meant from Bristol in the south and then west of a line that ran from (roughly) Weston-super-Mare in Somerset northwards to Haltwhistle, Northumberland; and then northwestwards to Linlithgow in Scotland. The South, South East and East of England were regarded as [...] "dangerous" [...] and the Midlands area, including Birmingham as [...] "unsafe". This definition of [...] "safe" [...] area was later changed, and in 1940 ignored in the case <b>of</b> <b>ROF</b> Chorley.|$|E
50|$|In April 1936, 900 acre {{of land in}} Waterton was compulsorily purchased. The site chosen was {{farmland}} next to the Great Western Railway South Wales Main Line, {{which offered}} additional benefits. Located on what was a reclaimed marshland, a persistent local {{legend has it that}} the resultant dampness often resulted in the area being covered in a light mist or fog, which further protected it from bombing. Even if so, the drainage of the marshes caused the mist to cease. Further acreage was purchased in Brackla, leading to the development <b>of</b> <b>ROF</b> 11 and ROF 41.|$|E
5000|$|Production of cordite ceased in 1945, {{at the end}} of World War II, but {{the site}} {{retained}} by the ROF organisation until 1975 on a [...] "care and maintenance" [...] basis, firstly under the administration <b>of</b> <b>ROF</b> Bishopton and in the latter years by ROF Bridgwater. Cocroft notes that an RDX plant was installed there sometime in the 1950s. The production plant at ROF Ranskill was broken up from 1975 with useful spares for (presumably) the RDX plant being sent to ROF Bridgwater before the site was handed over to what was to later to become the Defence Estates for disposal.|$|E
30|$|Hayashi et al. 2004 {{described}} the treatment <b>of</b> <b>ROFs</b> using a replantation procedure that included repair with dentin-bonded resin. They found that 18 of 26 cases were retained and remained functional after 4 to 76  months. They {{also reported that}} the treatment of teeth with fractures spreading more than two thirds the length from the cervical portion towards the apex, as well as posterior teeth, was significantly less successful (Hayashi et al. 2004).|$|R
30|$|The {{etiology}} <b>of</b> <b>ROFs</b> in endodontically treated teeth {{is complex}} {{due to its}} multifactorial nature (Tamse et al. 2015). There are predisposing factors to ROFs and contributing ones. Some of the predisposing factors are the specific anatomy of the susceptible roots, the biochemical changes in the root dentin in the endodontically treated tooth, {{and the loss of}} healthy tooth substance as a result of caries and trauma before the endodontic procedures had been initiated (Tamse et al. 2015).|$|R

50|$|Over the years, {{the posters}} <b>of</b> <b>RoF</b> have {{developed}} their own patois with words and phrases such as 'lollers', 'alan', 'orla', 'everybody cheered', 'growler', 'heh', 'bloata', and 'nuffink' assuming special meaning. Terms such as 'norty', 'filf', 'leetle', 'horn', 'hmong', 'mongtard', 'ghey' and 'wood' (and its rhetorical or sometimes genuinely inquisitive counterpart, 'wood u') are also common parlance. Moving somewhat nearer the boundaries, oblique references to seeing you next Tuesday mushroomed {{to the point where}} RoF's administrators were forced to launch their own lexical counter-offensive, resulting in phrases like 'ladypart' and 'kittens' unexpectedly and automatically peppering general discussion. RoF terminology is complemented by the ability to present text in italics, bold or even miniature font. The expression *throws sandwich* is used to highlight a poster's weight issues.|$|E
50|$|The First World War, like in many locations, brought {{death to}} the young men of the village, but the Second World War brought greater effect. With the {{development}} <b>of</b> <b>ROF</b> Bridgend, a Royal Ordnance Factory, ROF Cardiff was opened in 1940 to take the explosives from Bridgend and produce tank, anti-tank and field guns. Air defences against paratroopers were placed in nearby fields, but this was strengthened in 1941 when the Royal Air Force established both a RAF Regiment base and a glider training facility. In 1943 the United States Army began using the facilities to hold troops and undertake local training, including basic flight in Tiger Cubs. The Americans left in June 1944 as the Allies prepared for D-Day. In 1987 ROF Cardiff became an Atomic Weapons Establishment. It closed down in February 1997.|$|E
5000|$|During the Second World War, {{those not}} within the {{colliery}} industry, and hence in reserved employment, could find similar work at ROF Hirwaun, which was actually sited within Rhigos parish. Developed by Royal Ordnance Factory and the Ministry of War from 1942 as an offshoot <b>of</b> <b>ROF</b> Newport, it was an engineering ROF producing [...]303 cartridge cases for Lee-Enfield rifles, and 9mm cartridge cases, which were then shipped to be filled at a Filling ROF. Having built three new roads and associated bungalows to house the workers, all raw materials were shipped in via the former Vale of Neath Railway by the Great Western Railway, using the sidings of the former Tir Herbert brickworks. Day-workers would alight at Rhigos railway station, beyond which were built additional sidings to house the railway carriages that were shipping workers to the site {{from all over the}} South Wales valleys. The site of the ROF was discovered by the German military, who ordered a single air raid by the Nazi Luftwaffe in 1943. At the end of the war, the site was abandoned, and the factory was only demolished in the late 1960s.|$|E

30|$|Since {{almost all}} ROFs {{have a history}} of root canal {{treatments}} (RCTs) (Tsesis et al. 2015; Cuoghi et al. 2010; Tsesis et al. 2010 a; Garcia-Guerrero et al. 2017; Rosen et al. 2016), it seems clear that there must be an association between RCTs and the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>ROFs</b> (Cuoghi et al. 2010; Tsesis et al. 2010 a). Thus, based on the nature of these fractures, a new extended definition was recently suggested as following: “a complication of root canal treatment, characterized by a complete or incomplete fracture initiated from the root at any level, usually directed buccolingually” (Tsesis et al. 2015).|$|R
50|$|The {{village is}} built {{on the site of}} a former British Army supply depot. According to Ministry of Defence (MoD) files, the site was {{originally}} constructed in 1940 (finished September 1942) by Holloway Brothers, and was an Agency Filling Factory run by Lever Brothers/Unilever as No.10 Royal Ordnance Factory (10 ROF). At that time, it was known as the Queniborough Depot, since that was the closest village to it. It began production in March/April 1942. The aerial photograph reveals its former road layout. According to English Heritage's reference work Dangerous Energy, it was operating Groups 8-10 <b>of</b> <b>ROF</b> filling types (High Explosives received, mixed, and put into bombs and warheads). By 1944, it was temporarily occupied by the War Office. A report of 1951 has it designated as 78 COSD (Command Ordnance Sub Depot). It was decommissioned in 1959, and subsequently bought for housing development by Jelson Homes. This development began in 1962. There were two enormous shell storage bunkers that could not be demolished, and these were earthed over and landscaped. They became known locally as the 'Mound', and are now part of the adjacent playing fields. These were opened to the public as part of the Queen's Silver Jubilee celebrations in 1977, and there is a plaque near Long Furrow noting this fact.|$|E
