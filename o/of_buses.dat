5|$|Although the 1920s saw {{a slight}} growth in traffic, the network's {{expansion}} {{slowed to a}} halt. Private motoring had arrived {{to put an end}} to its monopoly. The rising power <b>of</b> <b>buses</b> and trolleybuses, the Great Depression in France, and above all the Second World War that ravaged Rouen and Normandy, condemned the tramway to death. The last trams stopped running in 1953, after seventy-six years of service. However, in 1994, a new Rouen tramway came to the Norman capital.|$|E
5|$|Edinburgh Corporation Tramways {{ran from}} 1871 until 16 November 1956. After that date, public {{transport}} consisted <b>of</b> <b>buses</b> and a limited network of commuter rail lines. Towards {{the end of}} the 20th century, there was revived interest in trams and networks were introduced in Birmingham, Croydon, Manchester, Nottingham and Sheffield.|$|E

CART buses transport more than 1.3million travelers annually.|$|E
5|$|In May 2017, the High Street {{was made}} one-way for traffic heading towards Saltford and Bath with all Bristol-bound {{diverted}} along Ashton Way.

5|$|In the 1930s the city's {{transportation}} system {{was marred by}} violent protests. Transit workers wanted to unionize, and with the main company's management against any effort to change Omaha's reputation as a non-unionized city. After the introduction <b>of</b> <b>buses</b> in the early 1950s, streetcars were closed down, {{and in the last}} years of the decade the city began construction on its components in the Interstate Highway System.|$|E

5|$|Near {{the end of}} 1982, Ontario Minister of Transportation and Communications James W. Snow {{announced}} the launching of GO-ALRT (Advanced Light Rail Transit), an interregional light rail transit program providing $2.6 billion (1980 dollars) of infrastructure. Although this plan {{did not come to}} fruition, certain key objectives from it were established in other ways: additional stations were built, all-day service to Whitby and Burlington was established and networks <b>of</b> <b>buses</b> and trains interconnected the network.|$|E
5|$|There {{were reports}} of a mass robbery at a fan party in Rio de Janeiro and of fans setting fire to Brazilian flags {{in the streets of}} São Paulo even before the match was over. A number <b>of</b> <b>buses</b> were burned across São Paulo and an {{electronics}} store looted.|$|E
5|$|After the 1960s, lack of {{investment}} led to local {{services and the}} station becoming increasingly run down. By the early 1980s, Marylebone was under serious threat of closure. In 1983, British Rail chairman Peter Parker commissioned a report into the possibility of converting Marylebone into a 'high-speed bus way', whereby Marylebone would be converted into a coach station. The tracks between Marylebone, Harrow-on-the-Hill and South Ruislip would have closed, and {{been converted into a}} road for the exclusive use <b>of</b> <b>buses</b> and coaches. British Rail services via High Wycombe would have been diverted into Paddington, and the Aylesbury services would have been taken over by London Underground on an extended Metropolitan line, and then routed to Baker Street.|$|E
25|$|London {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} major users <b>of</b> low-floor <b>buses.</b> From 2000, the mainstay <b>of</b> fleet, double-decker <b>buses,</b> were augmented with a fleet <b>of</b> articulated <b>buses,</b> rising to a peak fleet size of 393 Mercedes-Benz Citaros. These were introduced to help replace the AEC Routemaster, as well as to cope with an increased capacity. A small fleet <b>of</b> hybrid <b>buses</b> was also introduced.|$|R

5|$|After the {{evacuation}} signal was given, the buses began {{to pick up}} passengers and head to the DAO Compound. The system worked so efficiently that the buses {{were able to make}} three return journeys rather than the expected one. The biggest problem occurred when the ARVN guarding the main gate at Tan Son Nhut refused to allow the last convoy <b>of</b> <b>buses</b> into the DAO Compound at about 17:45. As this was happening, a firefight between two ARVN units broke out and caught the rearmost buses in the crossfire, disabling two of the vehicles. Eventually the ARVN commander controlling the gates agreed to permit the remaining buses to enter the compound. General Carey's threat to use the AH-1J SeaCobra helicopter gunships flying overhead may {{have played a role in}} the ARVN commander's decision.|$|E
5|$|By {{the morning}} of 29 April it was {{estimated}} that approximately 10,000 people had gathered around the Embassy, while some 2,500 evacuees were in the Embassy and consular compounds. The crowds prevented the use <b>of</b> <b>buses</b> for transporting evacuees from the Embassy to the DAO Compound for evacuation and the Embassy gates were closed to prevent the crowd from surging through. Eligible evacuees now had to make themselves known to the Marine guards or Embassy staff manning the walls and were then lifted over the walls and into the Embassy compound. Among those arriving at the Embassy were Dr Phan Quang Dan, former Deputy Prime Minister and Minister responsible for social welfare and refugee resettlement, and Lieutenant-General Dang Van Quang.|$|E
5|$|SR-202 {{serves as}} the {{eastbound}} ramp from SR-201 onto Interstate I-80, because at its intersection with I-80, the SR-201 (which is the southern terminus of SR-202) traffic only has the option to continue on I-80 westbound, and {{does not have an}} offramp to eastbound I-80. Traffic on SR-202 has increased 12% between 2002 and 2007, with a daily average of 735cars per day using SR-202 in 2007, compared to 475cars per day in 2002. Half of the traffic on SR-202 consists <b>of</b> <b>buses</b> and trucks.|$|E
40|$|The year 1975 {{has seen}} a rising {{opposition}} to busing for school integration. Advocates <b>of</b> <b>busing</b> are placed {{in the position of}} defending the initiation and continuation <b>of</b> <b>busing.</b> Those opposed to busing can have their opposition widely accepted despite the complete lack of analysis of the consequences. Historical injustices against Blacks and minorities are widely known, but much of the public seems unaware of or unconcerned about present injustices and the official acts of discrimination which are still perpetuated...|$|R

5|$|To {{prepare for}} Olympic visitors, Beijing's {{transportation}} infrastructure was expanded. Beijing's airport underwent a major renovation {{with the addition}} of the new Terminal 3, designed by architect Norman Foster. Within the city itself, Beijing's subway was doubled in capacity and length, {{with the addition of}} 7 lines and 80 stations to the previously existing 4 lines and 64 stations. Included in this expansion was a new link connecting to the city's airport. A fleet of thousands <b>of</b> <b>buses,</b> minibuses, and official cars transported spectators, athletes, and officials between venues.|$|E
5|$|Only a {{very small}} {{proportion}} of the population in the USSR owned cars. Because of the widespread lack of any mode of private transport, most Soviet citizens travelled via public transport. Due to a relative shortage of cars and good-quality roads, the Soviet people travelled twice as much by bus, train and rapid transit as people in the First World. Soviet bus-transport, throughout most {{of the history of the}} Soviet Union, was controlled either by the regional or the republican branches of the Ministry of Transport. Since rail transit systems were more environmental and consumed little fuel, Soviet planners concentrated their efforts in constructing electricity-driven, rather than fuel-consuming transport. In the mid-1980s the government initiated a programme for compressed-gas energy for buses. By 1988 only 1.2 percent <b>of</b> <b>buses</b> used gas energy, while 30 percent used diesel. Soviet bus-enterprises ran a deficit for the first time in their history by the mid-to-late 1980s.|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 95 - 97) Analyzes critically {{the various}} psychological, social, legal, and political aspects <b>of</b> the <b>busing</b> controversy. An attempt {{is made to}} gain an overview and understanding <b>of</b> the impact <b>busing</b> has had on public education in the United States. This study was made by reviewing and analyzing the literature and research studies on busing. Pupil transportation has long {{played a major role}} in the education of American children. It was the direct outgrowth of the movement toward school consolidation. It offered better education to children who would have been deprived of such opportunities. It is only in the context of school desegregation that busing has become an issue of emotion and controversy. In a review of the legal and political aspects <b>of</b> <b>busing</b> it was noted that the Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education in 1954 set the stage for busing as a tool for desecrating schools. Numerous other court decisions have reinforced the findings in the Brown case. The use <b>of</b> <b>busing</b> has sometimes been deemed necessary to implement these decisions. Busing has become a political issue, with government officials on both sides of the political spectrum becoming immersed in the battle. In reviewing the research on desegregation and busing, several communities have been compared with Berkeley, California and Kalamazoo, Michigan studied in detail. Berkeley, with strong school leadership, succeeded in drawing up a workable plan for <b>Busing</b> <b>of</b> integration, while Kalamazoo did not foresee the need for change of old segregation patterns in their schools until forced to do so by pressures from the black community and orders form the court. It was noted in the discussion of the psychological implications <b>of</b> <b>busing</b> that a pattern of fears and myths had become fixed in the public???s minds. Many social scientists refuted these fears and gave evidence that both majority and minority pupils made achievement gains in integrated schools, and that white pupils??? achievement did not suffer when they were transported to black school. Often, it is white parent???s attitude of racial superiority which made integration difficult. A psychiatrist who studied the problem <b>of</b> <b>busing</b> intensively stated that he never saw children become sick or emotionally disturbed because they were bused; that the experience <b>of</b> <b>busing</b> was physically, psychologically and educationally neutral. Strong leadership in education, politics, law and social sciences is needed if this problem <b>of</b> <b>busing</b> is to be solved constructively...|$|R

5|$|The London Transport Museum is in a Victorian {{iron and}} glass {{building}} {{on the east side}} of the market square. It was designed as a dedicated flower market by William Rogers of William Cubitt and Company in 1871, and was first occupied by the museum in 1980. Previously the transport collection had been held at Syon Park and Clapham. The first parts of the collection were brought together at the beginning of the 20th century by the London General Omnibus Company (LGOC) when it began to preserve buses being retired from service. After the LGOC was taken over by the London Electric Railway (LER), the collection was expanded to include rail vehicles. It continued to expand after the LER became part of the London Passenger Transport Board in the 1930s and as the organisation passed through various successor bodies up to TfL, London's transport authority since 2000. The Covent Garden building has on display many examples <b>of</b> <b>buses,</b> trams, trolleybuses and rail vehicles from the 19th and 20th centuries as well as artefacts and exhibits related to the operation and marketing of passenger services and the impact that the developing transport network has had on the city and its population.|$|E
5|$|The guide-wheel, which {{protrudes}} {{just ahead of}} the front wheels, is {{the most important part of}} the bus when travelling on the O-Bahn. It is connected directly to the steering mechanism, and steers the bus by running along the raised edge of the track. While it is not strictly necessary for drivers to hold the steering wheel when travelling on the O-Bahn because of the guide-wheel, safety procedures require the driver to be alert to their circumstances at all times. A rumble strip before stations is a reminder that they need to resume control. The guide-wheel is the most delicate part of the system and is designed to snap off upon sharp impact; before the O-Bahn was in place, a number <b>of</b> <b>buses</b> were fitted with guide-wheels for their ordinary routes to test their durability. Drivers were forced to be more cautious on their normal trips after numerous guide-wheel-to-kerb impacts.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} several {{proposals}} to reduce congestion on Oxford Street. Horse-drawn vehicles were banned in 1931, and traffic signals were installed in the same year. To alleviate congestion and help traffic flow <b>of</b> <b>buses,</b> most of Oxford Street is designated a bus lane during peak daytime hours, when private vehicles are banned. It is only open to buses, taxis and two-wheeled vehicles between 7:00am and 7:00pm on all days except Sundays. The ban was introduced experimentally in June 1972. It was considered a success, with an estimated increase of £250,000 in retail sales. In 2009, a new diagonal crossing opened at Oxford Circus, allowing pedestrians to cross from one corner of Oxford Street to the opposite corner without having to cross the road twice or use the pedestrian underpass. This doubles the pedestrian capacity at the junction.|$|E
