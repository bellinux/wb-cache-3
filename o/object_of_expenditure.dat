40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedMBA Professional ReportA basic principle of fiscal {{law is the}} identification of an <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>expenditure</b> as either an investment or expense; the identification then determines the proper appropriation and means through which the item is acquired. Part of the decision logic for an investment/expense determination is whether the items are centrally managed. The policies and practices surrounding central management of items varies across military departments and sometimes varies within a military department. This report documents various processes, as they exist today, and chronicles changes that occurred recently in the U. S. Air Force. Analyzing those processes indicates unclear policy direction, which leads to nonstandard implementation and problems with compliance. The presence of centralized information technology seems to lessen confusion and aid standardization of practices.

40|$|This thesis traces {{operations}} of destruction in visual cultures, describing these operations as they manifest in films and visual art practices. Beginning with Georges Bataille’s general economy of energy, {{as it appears}} in The Accursed Share, this thesis deploys {{the concept of the}} simulacrum to argue that the {{operations of}} destructions in visual cultures produce particular forms of sovereign experience. It argues that while the <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>expenditure</b> can only be unique to each site of sovereign experience, appearance of an operation of destruction that produces the possibility of that sovereign experience remains consistent. Bataille’s sovereignty cannot be specified in relation to either the individual or the universal, because, as Bataille demonstrates, sites of sovereign expenditure are temporally, materially and culturally specific, unable to be repeated without differentiation, and unable to be expressed fully after the fact. In order to argue this position, I deploy Bataille’s economics of destruction which operates within the specific realm of visual cultural theory. Orientations derived from Bataille’s work are positioned alongside the work of other theorists, and in particular, Pierre Klossowski and Gilles Deleuze, to produce a unique theoretical basis for the operation of art in culture. The thesis offers a theoretical development in the problem of representation in Bataille’s work {{in the form of the}} simulacrum after Gilles Deleuze’s Logic of Sense. Each chapter is paired with another in a conceptual inversion that locates destructions in film, screen media and visual art practices. The thesis engages with operations of destruction in architecture, human extinction, identity and communication (through the performance of the artist and community in film), the physicality of destruction in the body and in sexuality, and finally, the order of destruction in the apparent dematerialisation of the image in digital culture...|$|E
40|$|Understanding {{the impact}} of colleges and {{universities}} has long been of interest to higher education administrators and public officials. Several approaches used to examine this issue are summarized. Studies of economic impact are reviewed which estimate the effects of the expenditures of institutions, their students, employees and visitors upon local income, sales, employment and tax revenues and are contrasted with the present study. ^ The principle research question is whether the presence of institutions of higher education, examined by type and by control and by major <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>expenditure,</b> have an effect upon the economic welfare of the counties where they are located, as measured by the level of per capita income in those counties. Neoclassical regional economic theory is used to develop a model. In a cross-sectional analysis of U. S. counties, 1987 demographic and economic data are merged with 1987 higher education expenditure, employment and enrollment data in a national data base of county-level data. ^ Ordinary least squares regression analysis is used to determine if the presence of higher education institutions is a cause of higher mean levels of per capita income in counties where they are located. Parameters are estimated for a national model and for each of four U. S. economic regions. ^ The study finds that the presence of students depresses the reported level of per capita income in counties, especially those with four-year institutions. The effect of institutions upon economic welfare is positive, however, due to the positive effect of expenditures on research. The presence of private four-year institutions has the most positive impact upon county-level per capita income. ^ The Northeast region has the highest density of counties with higher education institutions and, when compared with other regions, experiences the greatest positive impact of higher education upon county-level per capita income. ^ Dichotomous variables representing urban and rural areas and public and private expenditures found that higher education in urban areas is a positive influence upon per capita income and that both public and private expenditures are positive and statistically significant in understanding inter county differences in per capita income. ^ Whereas research expenditures of four-year institutions positively impact the level of per capita income, while {{the impact of}} two-year institutions is negative, instruction expenditures of two-year colleges are positive and statistically significant in explaining inter county differences in the level of business volume as measured by the level of per capita sales. ...|$|E

The <b>object</b> <b>of</b> this dissertation is to determine the approach by our courts to apportionment <b>of</b> <b>expenditure</b> in terms <b>of</b> section 11 (a) read with section 23 (g) of the Income Tax Act No 58 of 1962. A single expenditure incurred for more than one purpose poses a problem when deduction <b>of</b> such an <b>expenditure,</b> is sought by a taxpayer. The problem that ttie courts have always encountered when dealing with the deductibility <b>of</b> <b>expenditure</b> incurred for a dual purpose, {{is that there is no}} provision in the Income Tax Act that directs what to do when faced with such a problem. The courts have always chosen apportionment <b>of</b> <b>expenditure</b> as a solution to the deductibility <b>of</b> <b>expenditure</b> incurred for more than one purpose, one such purpose being for tax purposes and the other being for non tax purposes. Apportionment <b>of</b> <b>expenditure</b> is used as a device to allocate part <b>of</b> the <b>expenditure,</b> which was incurred to produce income, as taxable expenditure, and another part <b>of</b> that <b>expenditure</b> which was incurred to produce non-taxable income, as non-deductible expenditure. This dissertation seeks to find out whether courts do take into consideration the provisions of the Income Tax Act applicable to the deduction <b>of</b> <b>expenditure</b> when called upon to make a decision on a particular case. The South African Revenue Services use apportionment <b>of</b> <b>expenditure</b> where it deems appropriate and the courts have never opposed it. The Legislature, which is responsible for the enactment of the act, seems to be happy to lie low, and allow the courts to dominate in handling the disputes that arise as a result <b>of</b> <b>expenditure</b> incurred with a dual purpose. It has been suggested that whilst the Income Tax Act does not provide any direction in situations where the deductibility <b>of</b> dual purposes <b>expenditure</b> is in dispute, apportionment is implied in the terms of section 11 (a) read with section 23 (g) of the Income Tax Act no 58 of 1962. The main aim of this research is to establish whether the path taken by the courts is the correct one in terms of section 11 (a) and section 23 (g) of the Income Tax Act no 58 of 1962. It is hoped that this work will be of assistance to both The South African Revenue Services and the taxpayers at large in terms of understanding that the courts are within the bounds of the Act...|$|R

Framing theory holds that information about a problem presented in different ways will be perceived as a different problem by decision-makers. Using framing theory as a theoretical basis, a laboratory experiment was conducted, where groups using budgets differently framed budget documents deliberated over an identical budget scenario.
