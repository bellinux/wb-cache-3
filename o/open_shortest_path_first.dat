30|$|To date, {{there are}} a number of green TE approaches. However, they do not {{consider}} LSPs. We briefly summarize a few key works. A modification of the <b>Open</b> <b>Short</b> <b>Path</b> <b>First</b> (OSPF) algorithm [35] is presented by Cianfrani et al. in [36]. They propose Energy-Aware Routing (EAR), whereby links that are not part of the <b>shortest</b> <b>path</b> tree (SPT) calculated by each router are switched off. In a different work, the authors of [12] formulated a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem to maximize the total power savings while minimizing the overall maximum link utilization (MLU). The main ideas are to select candidate paths with the minimum number of hops, shorter than the network diameter, or meet end-to-end delay constraints. In [37], the authors consider the problem of scheduling deadline constrained flows and their routing in a data center. Specifically, they formulated a convex optimization problem where the decision variables are to determine the transmission rate of a flow and its route such that a network’s total energy expenditure is minimized. A key constraint is that the rate assigned to a flow must ensure all its data is transmitted within a given deadline.|$|R
40|$|Currently, {{the service}} {{provider}} network capacity utilization is low {{due to the}} shortest multipath based routing protocols <b>Opens</b> <b>Shortest</b> <b>Path</b> <b>First</b> (OSPF) and Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System (ISIS). Due to inefficient routing approach, certain paths can be overloaded and link capacity is required while alternative paths are unused. The overall network has to be dimensioned with higher link bandwidth requirements introducing additional line, linecard, routing engine and overall solution cos. This paper provides improved Congestion Aware Multipath Routing (CAMRv 2) algorithm overview. The new network routing algorithm allows higher throughput, network load-balancing and stability to ensure lower congestion and data drop on critical links. The algorithm discovers unused network resources and dynamically adapts to the actual traffic load and displacement. The focus in this paper is on new parameters for path computation performance improvement. Additionally, detailed IPv 6 source routing CAMRv 2 implementation for parallel coexistence with present networks is presented. Finally, the new routing algorithm is simulated in several scenarios over aggregation network. The result of simulations have proved better performance and resource utilization of the proposed algorithm in sparse aggregation network in terms of load-balancing between uplinks to the core networ...|$|R

40|$|The {{two most}} {{prominent}} link state routing protocols used for intra-domain routing are the <b>Open</b> <b>Shortest</b> <b>Paths</b> <b>First</b> (OSPF) and Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) protocols. For different topologies and weight changes these protocols are easily updated {{to adjust the}} path between source and destination. However, it is computationally hard to obtain link weights that optimize network performance for a given topology and traffic situation. Furthermore, {{it is even more}} difficult to take into account, variations and uncertainty in the traffic demands. In this paper we study search heuristics for determining a set of OSPF/IS-IS link weights to optimize performance of the network for uncertain traffic demands. Robust routing is the capacity of dealing effectively with the variation from nominal operating conditions of routing. The common approach in robust routing is finding a path that minimizes the worst case scenario. The search heuristics combines the network performance and cost function which deviates from the robust weight settings using an objective function. We consider link load and inter-domain traffic uncertainties and compare their performance with the optimal solution. To evaluate the search heuristics we will first consider small network topologies then we will take larger network topologies with different traffic demands. The results show that for hop count link weight setting the search heuristic does not show any progress. However, for a random weight setting the search heuristic shows better result and the maximum utilization of the link load traffic uncertainty can be improved as close to the optimum. Given different traffic demand and random start weights the search heuristics perform close to optimal for inter-domain traffic uncertainty...|$|R

40|$|Mobile ad hoc network (MANET) {{is a new}} {{opportunity}} for mobile networking using intelligent mobile terminals. However, the widely used <b>shortest</b> <b>path</b> <b>first</b> based routing algorithm leads to various network utilization problems. Mobile terminals have limited power, hence, power saving should be considered when terminals serve as intermediate nodes in MANET. Furthermore, ad hoc routing table calculation is distributed among all network terminals. Therefore, {{we also need to}} construct stable paths with longer lifetime {{in order to reduce the}} communication overhead introduced by route reconstruction. A less evenly distributed traffic exhausts power on the nodes in the center of the network and leads to <b>shorter</b> <b>path</b> lifetime. Such a network deployment is not fair for the internal nodes. The above problems exist for all routing protocols especially proactive routing protocols based on <b>shortest</b> <b>path</b> <b>first</b> algorithm OLSR. In this paper we study the MANET network utilization in term of load distribution and path lifetime. Our careful simulation results demonstrate that the standard <b>shortest</b> <b>path</b> <b>first</b> algorithm leads to worse load balancing and reduced path lifetime compared to our proposal. When the most unstable network topology is considered, our proposal achieves better network utilization by reducing the peak transmission per node by 15 % and the standard deviation of transmission per node by 50 %. The average lifetime for established paths is doubled under the most unstable topology. © 2012 IEEE...|$|R

30|$|As {{noted in}} Section 1, {{there are many}} studies on {{increasing}} LSP acceptance rates by minimizing interference between LSPs.

MCSPF aims to select LSPs that satisfy bandwidth and end-to-end delay constraints while maximizing LSP acceptance rates. In [50], the authors present a modification to the Wang-Crowcroft (WC) algorithm [51] in an effort to increase LSP acceptance rates by taking into account the order of arriving LSP requests. The resulting Wang-Crowcroft with Sorting (WCS) algorithm improves upon WC by reordering LSP requests according to their bandwidth and delay requirements. De Oliveira et al.
