30|$|Factors which {{determine}} the stiffness of a fixator construct depend on its two main constituents: the device material and configuration {{on one hand}} and the pins on the other. Fixator rigidity is directly proportion to pin stiffness that is increased by: firstly improving material properties; secondly by increasing pin diameter—but not to exceed one-third of the bone diameter—and thirdly a decreased pin <b>offset</b> (the free <b>bending</b> length of pins which is the distance between the bone surface and the external pin clamp). Other pin factors that add to fixator rigidity are increased pin spread (length of the fractured bone involved in fixation), increased pin numbers and levels and lastly, increased pin divergent angle in the axial plane [7, 11, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25]. Considering the aforementioned factors, the design of the external fixator used in this study can be considered as a modification of the Catagni and Cattaneo module in 1986 [11, 12] but where the distal rings are replaced by femoral arches.|$|R

For shear offsets << 1 mu m, typical of plate thickness << 100 mu m, local temperature rises are insignificant.

A detailed study of 3 D models compared to experimental data {{is followed by a}} parametric study of different shell modelling techniques. These are evaluated and compared with industry semi-empirical equations. The evaluated 3 D models were found to match the experimental values with good precision. Simulations based on these types of 3 D models may replace experimental tests. Two different modelling techniques were also evaluated for use in load distribution models.

Further improvement of one of the models was made through a modification scale factor. Finally, the same modelling technique was verified using the NASTRAN solver. To summarize, it is concluded that: • Detailed 3 D-models with material properties defined from stress-strain curves correspond well to experiments and simulations may replace actual flexibility tests. • At mid-surface modelling of the connecting parts, beam elements with a circular cross section as a connector between shell elements is an easy and accurate modelling technique, with the only data input of bolt material and dimension. • Using connector elements is accurate only if the connecting parts are modelled in the same plane, i. e. with no <b>offset.</b> Secondary <b>bending</b> due to <b>offset</b> should only be accounted for once and only once throughout the analysis, and it is already included in the flexibility input...|$|R

40|$|In the GPS radio {{occultation}} technique, the atmospheric excess phase (AEP) {{can be used}} to derive the refractivity, which is an important quantity in numerical weather prediction. The AEP is conventionally estimated based on GPS double-difference or single-difference techniques. These two techniques, however, rely on the reference data in the data processing, increasing the complexity of computation. In this study, an undifferenced (ND) processing strategy is proposed to estimate the AEP. To begin with, we use PANDA (Positioning and Navigation Data Analyst) software to perform the precise orbit determination (POD) for the purpose of acquiring the position and velocity of the mass centre of the COSMIC (The Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere and Climate) satellites and the corresponding receiver clock <b>offset.</b> The <b>bending</b> angles, refractivity and dry temperature profiles are derived from the estimated AEP using Radio Occultation Processing Package (ROPP) software. The ND method is validated by the COSMIC products in typical rising and setting occultation events. Results indicate that rms (root mean square) errors of relative refractivity differences between undifferenced and atmospheric profiles (atmPrf) provided by UCAR/CDAAC (University Corporation for Atmospheric Research/COSMIC Data Analysis and Archive Centre) are better than 4 and 3  % in rising and setting occultation events respectively. In addition, we also compare the relative refractivity bias between ND-derived methods and atmPrf profiles of globally distributed 200 COSMIC occultation events on 12 December 2013. The statistical results indicate that the average rms relative refractivity deviation between ND-derived and COSMIC profiles is better than 2  % in the rising occultation event and better than 1. 7  % in the setting occultation event. Moreover, the observed COSMIC refractivity profiles from ND processing strategy are further validated using European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) analysis data, and the results indicate that the undifferenced method reduces the noise level on the excess phase paths in the lower troposphere compared to the single-difference processing strategy...|$|R
40|$|Tibetan Plateau {{in western}} Sichuan Province, China, {{is one of}} the world's most active faults, having {{produced}} at least 8 earthquakes of M ≥ 7 since 1725 on a 350 -km-long segment of the fault. In the more limited 150 -km long northern segment including Luhuo and Daofu, 5 earthquakes of M ≥ 6. 9 have occurred during the past 100 years alone, with well documented overlapping surface ruptures. Some of these events were remarkably similar in magnitude and location to earlier historic events, suggesting that the characteristic earthquake model may apply here. No obvious geometric segmentation characterizes the smoothly curving Luhuo-Daofu sector, although its ends are marked by major left-stepping en echelon offsets that have also been the terminating points of individual earthquake ruptures. Minor en echelon <b>offsets</b> and <b>bends</b> within this segment are associated with local vertical relief, and one 9 ° bend is located close to the epicenter of the 1973 Luhuo earthquake (M = 7. 6). In the southern sector of the Xianshuihe fault, south of Qianning, the faults splits into several branches, one of which broke over its entire 27 -km length during the 1955 Kangding earthquake (M = 7. 5). The main fault near Kangding is characterized by a series of restraining and releasing bends, associated with corresponding topography, and these bends {{may be related to the}} fact that this southern segment of the fault seems to be characterized by infrequent great earthquakes (e. g., M = 7 - 3 / 4 in 1786) rather than by more frequent moderate earthquakes (M = ± 7) such as those that characterize the straighter and more continuous Luhuo-Daofu sector to the north. Continuing creep has been documented along some segments of the fault, and this, together with its high degree of activity, superb high-altitude exposures, and other unique attributes, make the Xianshuihe fault one of the most promising sites in the world for earthquake-prediction, hazard-evaluation, and segmentation studies...|$|R

The large size of the space components being considered for construction will require that these cranes have a reach on the order of 100 meters. A space crane constructed from an erectable four-longeron truss beam with 19 5 -sq-m truss bays is considered. This concept was selected to be compatible with the Space Station truss. This truss is hinged at three locations along its bottom edge and attached at one end to a rotary joint cantilevered to the assembly depot's main truss structure. The crane's boom sections are rotated by extensible longeron actuators located along the top edge of the beam. To achieve maximum position maneuvering capability for the crane requires that the individual sections be capable of rotating 180 degrees about the hinge point. This can only be accomplished by offsetting the hinges from the longeron axes. Since <b>offset</b> hinges introduce <b>bending</b> moments in the truss members, an analysis of the effect of hinge offsets on the load-carrying capacity of the structure is required.

This main shock {{was followed by}} an extensive aftershock sequence, with 55 events of M_L ≧ 3. 0 during July 1986. The epicenters of the main shock and aftershocks are located at {{the northern end of}} the San Diego Trough-Bahia Soledad fault zone (SDT-BS) where it changes strike from northwest to a more westerly direction through a left <b>offset</b> or a <b>bend</b> in the fault. The northwest-striking SDT-BS is one of three strike-slip fault systems that constitute the offshore Agua Blanca fault system. The spatial distribution of the aftershocks indicates a unilateral 7 - to 9 -km long rupture to the east-southeast away from the epicenter of the main shock. The focal mechanism of the main shock also has an east-southeast striking and south-dipping plane with mostly reverse movement on it. Focal mechanisms of the M_L ≧ 3. 0 aftershocks show both reverse and strike-slip movement. The reverse focal mechanisms indicate that this sequence may have occurred on a thrust fault that provides for a left stepping <b>offset</b> or a <b>bend</b> in the San Diego Trough fault as movement is transferred to the west along the Santa Cruz-Catalina Island escarpment. Some of the aftershocks that are located to the southeast of the main shock and have strike-slip focal mechanisms suggest activation of the northwest-trending San Diego Trough fault. A stress inversion of the focal mechanism data shows that the maximum principal stress determined from the focal mechanisms of the main shock and 22 aftershocks that occurred within 36 hours of the main shock has an azimuth of S 30 °W plunging 18 °. The maximum principal stress determined from 30 aftershocks that occurred from 15 July to 2 October 1986 has an azimuth of S 20 °W, plunging 18 °. The φ-values (the measure of the relative sizes of the principal stresses) are approximately 0. 07 and 0. 1, respectively, indicating that the intermediate and minimum principal stress are of similar magnitude. The results of the stress inversion, and the focal mechanisms that showed reverse faulting, suggest that the Inner Continental Borderland offshore from Oceanside is not currently a pure-strike-slip tectonic regime but rather a strike-slip mixed with reverse faulting regime. When the 52 aftershock focal mechanisms are divided into four groups and the stress inversion is repeated, the change in stress can be described as a progressive counter-clockwise rotation of 14 ° of the orientation of the maximum principal stress to a more southerly direction, with the greatest change in stress orientation observed shortly after the main shock. The abundance of aftershocks {{may be related to the}} large temporal variation in stress orientation that, in turn, may have resulted from the small stress drop of the main shock...|$|R

Most of the current robotic fi sh generate bending motion using rotary motors that implies at least one mechanical conversion of the motion. We seek a solution that directly bends the fi n and, at the same time, is able to exploit the magneto-mechanical properties of the fi n material. This strong fi n–actuator coupling blends the actuator and the body of the robot, allowing cross optimization of the system’s elements. We study a simplifi ed model of an elastic element, a spring–mass system representing a fl exible fi n, subjected to nonlinear forcing, emulating magnetic interaction. The dynamics of the system is studied under unforced and periodic forcing conditions. The analysis is focused on the limit cycles present in the system, which allows the periodic bending of the fi n and the generation of thrust. The frequency, maximum amplitude and center of the periodic orbits (<b>offset</b> of the <b>bending)</b> depend directly on the stiffness of the fi n and the intensity of the forcing; we use this dependency to sketch a simple parameter controller.

The a-Si:H/c-Si interface, while central to the technology, is still not fully understood in terms of transport and recombination across this nanoscale region, especially concerning the role of the different localized tail and defect states in the a-Si:H and at the a-Si:H/c-Si interface and of the band <b>offsets</b> and band <b>bending</b> induced by the heterostructure potential and the large doping, respectively. For instance, a consistent microscopic picture of transport and recombination processes with treatment of thermal and tunneling mechanisms on equal footing is lacking. On the other hand, there are new SHJ device architectures like thin wafers with light trapping structures [1] or interdigitated back contact (IBC) cells [2], which define additional requirements for the modelling approach concerning the integration of 3 D optical and electrical simulations. This paper provides an overview over our current efforts {{in the creation of a}} multi-scale and multi-physics framework to deal with the challenges encountered in the simulation of SHJ solar cells...|$|R
