5|$|Bragging, boasting, or mocking: speech which either only honors <b>oneself</b> or dishonors others.|$|E
5|$|Human {{beings are}} seen as a {{microcosm}} of the universe, and for example comprise the Wu Xing in form of the zang-fu organs. As a consequence, it is believed that deeper understanding of the universe can be achieved by understanding <b>oneself.</b>|$|E
5|$|Pramāda (carelessness and laxity of conduct) – This third {{cause of}} bondage {{consists}} of absentmindedness, lack of enthusiasm towards acquiring merit and spiritual growth, and improper actions of mind, body and speech without any regard to <b>oneself</b> or others.|$|E
5|$|Responsibility: the {{willingness}} to accept <b>oneself</b> {{as the source of}} outcomes in life – whether welcome or unwelcome – rather than blaming others for them.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability to}} {{camouflage}} <b>oneself</b> provides a survival {{advantage in the}} constant struggle between predators and prey. Natural selection has produced {{a wide variety of}} methods of survival in the oceans.|$|E
5|$|The {{silver birch}} is Finland's {{national}} tree. Leafy, fragrant boughs of silver birch (called vihta or vasta) {{are used to}} gently beat <b>oneself</b> in the Finnish sauna culture.|$|E
5|$|A {{recurrent}} {{and important}} element of Taoism are rituals, exercises and substances aiming at aligning <b>oneself</b> spiritually with cosmic forces, at undertaking ecstatic spiritual journeys, or at improving physical health and thereby extending one's life, ideally {{to the point of}} immortality. Enlightened and immortal beings are referred to as xian.|$|E
5|$|A. Your Duty to Self: {{describes}} {{the self as}} the center of the universe, with a call to learn about one's inner nature. Admonishes the reader to develop every faculty in a balanced way, establish one's autonomy, and to devote <b>oneself</b> to the service of one's own True Will.|$|E
5|$|B. Your Duty to Others: An admonishment to {{eliminate}} the illusion of separateness between <b>oneself</b> and all others, to fight when necessary, to avoid interfering with the Wills of others, to enlighten others when needed, and to worship the divine nature of all other beings.|$|E
5|$|Because not all local cults of Isis held mystery rites, not all her devotees {{would have}} {{undergone}} initiation. Nevertheless, both Apuleius's story and Plutarch's On Isis and Osiris suggest that initiation was {{considered part of}} the larger process of joining the cult and dedicating <b>oneself</b> to the goddess.|$|E
5|$|Current {{research}} suggests that the rates of self-harm are much higher among young people with the average age of onset between 14 and 24. The earliest reported incidents of self-harm are in children between 5 and 7 years old. In the UK in 2008 rates of self-harm in young people could be as high as 33%. In addition there appears to be an increased risk of self-harm in college students than among the general population. In a study of undergraduate students in the US, 9.8% of the students surveyed indicated that they had purposefully cut or burned themselves on at least one occasion in the past. When the definition of self-harm was expanded to include head-banging, scratching <b>oneself,</b> and hitting <b>oneself</b> along with cutting and burning, 32% of the sample said they had done this. In Ireland, a study found that instances of hospital-treated self-harm were much higher in city and urban districts, than in rural settings. The CASE (Child & Adolescent Self-harm in Europe) study suggests that the life-time risk of self-injury is ~1:7 for women and ~1:25 for men.|$|E
5|$|I am solidly {{confident}} no European {{has ever}} seen this rail alive, for that requires such a degree of toughening and such demands on <b>oneself</b> as I cannot so easily attribute to others. Habroptila is shielded by the awful thorns of the sago swamps... In this thorn wilderness, I walked barefoot and half-naked for weeks.|$|E
5|$|K. P. A. C. Lalitha, {{who would}} later play notable {{characters}} in many of Gopalakrishnan's films, played a small role as a prostitute in Swayamvaram. Noted Malayalam writer and journalist Vaikom Chandrasekharan Nair played a newspaper editor in the film. Gopalakrishnan praised him for his performance, expressing the difficulties of performing as <b>oneself</b> onscreen.|$|E
5|$|Matangi {{is one of}} the Mahavidyas, ten Tantric goddesses and {{a ferocious}} aspect of Devi, the Hindu Divine Mother. She is {{considered}} to be the Tantric form of Sarasvati, the goddess of music and learning. Like Sarasvati, Matangi governs speech, music, knowledge and the arts. Her worship is prescribed to acquire supernatural powers, especially gaining control over enemies, attracting people to <b>oneself,</b> acquiring mastery over the arts and gaining supreme knowledge.|$|E
5|$|Star Wars: Jedi Arena is a 2D {{overhead}} shooter {{video game}} developed {{and published by}} Parker Brothers in 1983 for the Atari 2600. It is the first Star Wars video game to feature lightsaber action. The goal of the game, based on one scene in the original Star Wars film, is {{to take out the}} opponent with the Seeker ball while defending <b>oneself</b> from incoming laser blasts using one's lightsaber.|$|E
5|$|The Assistance of Counsel Clause includes, as {{relevant}} here, {{at least six}} distinct rights: the right to counsel of choice, the right to appointed counsel, the right not to be constructively denied counsel, the right to conflict-free counsel, the effective assistance of counsel, {{and the right to}} represent <b>oneself</b> pro se.|$|E
5|$|The text {{suggests}} variations to the Saguna meditation, such as perceiving {{the union}} of a golden disc with four-faced golden Purusha, imagining a lustrous inner self inside <b>oneself</b> and then oneness with it, and other variations. Verses 9.43–44 state that the inner self, whether meditated upon as Nirguna or Saguna, is one and the same.|$|E
5|$|Ahimsa {{is one of}} the {{cardinal}} virtues and an important tenet of Jainism, Hinduism, and Buddhism. Ahimsa is a multidimensional concept, inspired by the premise that all living beings have the spark of the divine spiritual energy; therefore, to hurt another being is to hurt <b>oneself.</b> Ahimsa has also been related to the notion that any violence has karmic consequences. While ancient scholars of Hinduism pioneered and over time perfected the principles of Ahimsa, the concept reached an extraordinary status in the ethical philosophy of Jainism. Most popularly, Mahatma Gandhi strongly believed in the principle of ahimsa.|$|E
5|$|Following his defeat, McCain {{returned}} to the Senate amid varying views about what role he might play there. In mid-November 2008 he met with President-elect Obama, and the two discussed issues they had commonality on. Around the same time, McCain indicated {{that he intended to}} run for re-election to his Senate seat in 2010. As the inauguration neared, Obama consulted with McCain on a variety of matters, to an extent rarely seen between a president-elect and his defeated rival, and President Obama's inauguration speech contained an allusion to McCain's theme of finding a purpose greater than <b>oneself.</b>|$|E
5|$|Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic is a 2006 graphic memoir by the American {{cartoonist}} Alison Bechdel, {{author of}} the comic strip Dykes to Watch Out For. It chronicles the author's childhood and youth in rural Pennsylvania, United States, focusing on her complex relationship with her father. The book addresses themes of sexual orientation, gender roles, suicide, emotional abuse, dysfunctional family life, {{and the role of}} literature in understanding <b>oneself</b> and one's family. Writing and illustrating Fun Home took seven years, in part because of Bechdel's laborious artistic process, which includes photographing herself in poses for each human figure.|$|E
5|$|It was {{the grandest}} sight I ever experienced, {{to look out}} of the {{lighthouse}} on a very stormy day, and see <b>oneself</b> hanging, as it were, over the ocean, surrounded on three sides by a fearful chasm in which the air was so thickly crowded with birds as to produce {{the appearance of a}} heavy snowstorm, whilst the cries of these myriads, mingled with the roar of the ocean and the howling of the tremendous gusts of wind coming up from below as if forced through a blast pipe, made it almost impossible to hear a person speak.|$|E
5|$|No fasts or rituals {{to purify}} <b>oneself</b> before worship—typical of Hindu worship—are {{prescribed}} for Matangi worship. Anyone can use any mantra for worship, {{even though he}} is not initiated or considered unfit for worshipping any other deity. A thousand-name hymn from the Nanayavarta-tantra and a hundred-name hymn from the Rudradamala are dedicated to the goddess. The reciting of the Sanskrit alphabet, the chanting of mantras, the reading aloud of the scriptures, and performance of music and dance are also described as constituting acts of her worship.|$|E
5|$|Nonviolent Communication (abbreviated NVC, {{also called}} Compassionate Communication or Collaborative Communication) is a {{communication}} process developed by Marshall Rosenberg {{beginning in the}} 1960s. It focuses on three aspects of communication: self-empathy (defined as a deep and compassionate awareness of one's own inner experience), empathy (defined as {{an understanding of the}} heart in which we see the beauty in the other person), and honest self-expression (defined as expressing <b>oneself</b> authentically {{in a way that is}} likely to inspire compassion in others).|$|E
5|$|Sexuality is an {{important}} part of each person's identity, although some people might have no interest in sex. Sexuality has biological, psychological, emotional, spiritual, social, and cultural aspects. It involves not only sexual behaviors but relationships, self-image, sex drive, reproduction, sexual orientation, and gender expression. Each person's sexuality is influenced by lifelong socialization, in which factors such as religious and cultural background play a part, and is expressed in self-esteem and the beliefs one holds about <b>oneself</b> (identifying as a woman, or as an attractive person).|$|E
5|$|Some {{women were}} able {{to arrive at the}} {{recruiting}} station in a man's suit, deny ever having been in love with another woman, and be easily inducted. Sexual activity, however, was forbidden, and blue discharge was almost certain if one identified <b>oneself</b> as a lesbian. As women found each other, they formed into tight groups on base, socialized at service clubs, and began to use code words. Historian Allan Bérubé documented that homosexuals in the armed forces either consciously or subconsciously refused to identify themselves as homosexual or lesbian, and also never spoke about others' orientation.|$|E
5|$|Symeon often {{taught that}} all {{followers}} of Christ {{could have the}} direct experience of God, or theoria, just as the early church fathers experienced and taught. In that context he frequently described his own experiences of God as divine light. He preached to his monks {{that the way to}} God's grace was through a life of simplicity, asceticism, sanctity, and contemplation, which was also the doctrine of the hermits and monks known as the Desert Fathers. In addition, Symeon placed great emphasis on putting <b>oneself</b> under the complete guidance of a spiritual father.|$|E
5|$|The Rover {{section is}} open to any young adults {{between the ages of}} 18 and 30. The Rover {{programme}} focuses on their motto of 'Service', which has 3 aspects - service to the community, service to the Scout Movement and service to <b>oneself.</b> Rovers are not necessarily adult leaders of Scout Troops, although there is often some overlap. The Rover section has historically been open to young men and women, even prior to Cubbing and Scouting being opened to girls.|$|E
5|$|The mirror neuron system (MNS) theory hypothesizes that {{alterations}} to {{the development}} of the MNS interfere with imitation and lead to Asperger's core feature of social impairment. For example, one study found that activation is delayed in the core circuit for imitation in individuals with AS. This theory maps well to social cognition theories like the theory of mind, which hypothesizes that autistic behavior arises from impairments in ascribing mental states to <b>oneself</b> and others, or hyper-systemizing, which hypothesizes that autistic individuals can systematize internal operation to handle internal events but are less effective at empathizing by handling events generated by other agents.|$|E
5|$|Utmost {{necessity}} may {{be invoked}} where an interest {{protected by the}} Criminal Code (such as right to property or right to life) is endangered. An example of necessity would be a defense against a raging dog (unless the dog was directly sent by the owner, which would be case of necessary defense). The necessity may be invoked only in case of imminent danger and only {{if there is no}} other way of avoiding it (subsidiarity), such as locking <b>oneself</b> behind a fence or calling the police. Also, the consequence of the necessity must be less serious than the consequence of the endangering act (proportionality).|$|E
5|$|Besides the Mahavidya Bagalamukhi, Matangi is {{the other}} Mahavidya, whose worship is {{primarily}} prescribed to acquire supernatural powers. A hymn in the Maha-bhagavata Purana asks her grace to control one's foes, while the Tantrasara says that recitation of her mantra, meditation on her form and her ritual worship gives one to the power to control people and make them attracted to <b>oneself.</b> Her devotees, especially Tantric sadhakas, are regarded to have transcend the pollution by offering her left-over or partially eaten food (Ucchishta) and thus overcome their ego. Worship of Matangi is described to allow her devotee to face the forbidden and transcend pollution, leading him to salvation or allowing him to gain supernatural powers for worldly goals. The Purashcharyarnava describes pleasing the goddess would result in her answering all the devotee's queries by whispering in her ear.|$|E
5|$|Despite renewed {{interest}} from Camacho, then coach of Osasuna, Pablo moved to England, where {{he signed a}} three-year deal with West Bromwich Albion, newly returned to the Premier League, to begin on 1 July 2010 when his contract with Atlético expired. He made his debut on {{the opening day of}} the season, partnering Gabriel Tamaș in central defence as Albion lost 6–0 at Chelsea, and scored his first goal ten days later, in a 2–0 win at League One (third-tier) club Leyton Orient in the League Cup. He was used sporadically, making only ten Premier League appearances, of which just two came in 2011. Teammate Jonas Olsson suggested that it took at least a season to accustom <b>oneself</b> to English football, especially for someone who spoke little English when he first arrived.|$|E
5|$|For {{the most}} part, Germans {{accepted}} the Nuremberg Laws, partly because Nazi propaganda had successfully swayed public opinion towards the general belief that Jews were a separate race, {{but also because}} to oppose the regime meant leaving <b>oneself</b> open to harassment or arrest by the Gestapo. Citizens were relieved that the antisemitic violence ceased after the laws were passed. Non-Jews gradually stopped socialising with Jews or shopping in Jewish-owned stores. Wholesalers who continued to serve Jewish merchants were marched through the streets with placards around their necks proclaiming them as traitors. The Communist party and some elements of the Catholic Church were critical of the laws. Concerned that international opinion would be adversely swayed by the new laws, the Interior Ministry did not actively enforce them until after the 1936 Summer Olympics, held in Berlin that August.|$|E
5|$|Grunge became commercially {{successful}} in the early 1990s, due to releases such as Nirvana's Nevermind, Pearl Jam's Ten, Soundgarden's Superunknown, Alice in Chains' Dirt and Stone Temple Pilots' Core. The success of these bands boosted the popularity of alternative rock and made grunge the most popular form of rock music at the time. Although most grunge bands had disbanded or faded from view by the late 1990s, they influenced modern rock music, as their lyrics brought socially conscious issues into pop culture and added introspection and an exploration {{of what it means}} to be true to <b>oneself.</b> Grunge was also an influence on subsequent genres such as post-grunge (a derivative of grunge) and nu metal.|$|E
5|$|In Star Wars: Jedi Arena, two Jedi Knights, one {{blue and}} one red, {{face each other}} during lightsaber training. Player one is blue; the red Jedi is either a human- or {{computer-controlled}} opponent. The player controls his or her lightsaber with the paddle controller, defending <b>oneself</b> from the laser blasts coming from the Seeker ball, fired by the opponent. The Seeker will regularly turn wild and fire laser blasts randomly. The objective {{of the game is}} to fire laser blasts from the Seeker at the opponent's shield and finally directly at the opponent by aiming in the direction that the lightsaber is pointing. The game has four difficulty levels, changing the Seeker's speed; on the highest level, the Seeker is invisible. The game ends when one player has received three direct hits, and the winner becomes a Jedi Master.|$|E
5|$|Leon Czolgosz {{was born}} in Detroit, Michigan, in 1873, the son of Polish immigrants. The Czolgosz family moved several times as Paul Czolgosz, Leon's father, sought work {{throughout}} the Midwest. As an adult, Leon Czolgosz worked in a Cleveland factory until {{he lost his job}} in a labor dispute in 1893. Thereafter, he worked irregularly and attended political and religious meetings, trying to understand the reasons for the economic turmoil of the Panic of 1893. In so doing, he became interested in anarchism. By 1901, this movement was feared in the United States—New York's highest court had ruled that the act of identifying <b>oneself</b> as an anarchist {{in front of an audience}} was a breach of the peace. Anarchists had taken a toll in Europe by assassinating or attempting assassinations of a half-dozen officials and members of royal houses, and had been blamed for the 1886 Haymarket bombing in Chicago.|$|E
