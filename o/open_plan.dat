The MyCoast project is an attempt to transfer the Dutch experiences with <b>open</b> <b>planning</b> processes to Bulgaria. The project aims to involve stakeholders in the development of a vision and strategy for a more sustainable Black Sea coastal zone. Our research revealed that the MyCoast project approach appeared to be completely new for the Bulgarian stakeholders involved and that several preconditions for success had yet to be met. The paper therefore concludes with some recommendations to enhance the opportunities for more <b>open</b> <b>planning</b> approaches in Bulgaria and other countries...|$|R

A small case of cooperative prototyping is used for examining in how far this notion of openness can be made fruitful for the design of computer systems.

40|$|<b>Open</b> space <b>planning</b> {{has been}} present within the United States {{for over a}} century. Traditionally, <b>open</b> space <b>planning</b> efforts tend to focus more {{exclusively}} on either socially-based (e. g., recreational, scenic, or park planning) or ecologically-based (e. g., preserves, habitat networks or more general conservation planning) planning efforts. This separation of ecological and social frameworks in <b>open</b> space <b>planning</b> is reinforced by a persistent cultural model, where community and conservation are seen as opposing forces instead of partners. While recent <b>open</b> space <b>planning</b> efforts have begun to integrate social and ecological frameworks into one plan, {{the majority of our}} knowledge on integrated <b>open</b> space <b>planning</b> comes from individual case studies. Thus, a synthesized toolbox for how to practice this planning field is lacking. Given this lack of synthesized knowledge of integrated <b>open</b> space <b>planning,</b> an exploratory effort was undertaken to begin to view this newer planning field through a comprehensive lens. The goal of this research was to identify the state of integrated <b>open</b> space <b>planning</b> and begin to assess whether this state was leading toward 2 ̆ 2 landscape integrity, 2 ̆ 2 which suggests that healthy social and ecological systems must function together to be sustainable. Framed within an adapted Pressure-State-Response framework, this thesis employed mixed methods and multiple perspectives to engender a holistic framework that identifies the pressures, state of, and potential responses surrounding integrated <b>open</b> space <b>planning.</b> Pressures synthesized from practice and theory include key barriers and facilitators to achieving integration. For the first time, the state of integrated <b>open</b> space <b>planning</b> has been identified from a synthesis of thirty planning processes, practices, and tools utilized in this new planning field. This framework provides planners with a framework upon which sharing and communication can now take place regarding how integrated <b>open</b> space <b>planning</b> can be institutionalized. Finally, this understanding of the pressures and state reveals potential responses for this newer planning field, including the need for increased collaboration to build this new field of <b>open</b> space <b>planning</b> into a mainstream planning field and increased research into bridging the gaps between theory and practice identified through this thesis. This study found two integrated <b>open</b> space <b>planning</b> models and a breadth of literature supporting a movement away from the community versus conservation dichotomy. While this movement is not yet mainstream, both paradigm shifts and the rapidly changing landscapes in which we live are reinforcing this trend. With the expanded view and holistic framework illustrated by this research, planners are afforded a similar language upon which they can discuss the tools and processes central to integrated <b>open</b> space <b>planning...</b>|$|R
500|$|After World War II, Functionalism drew on {{trends in}} American Modernism with its {{irregular}} ground plans, flat roofs, <b>open</b> <b>plan</b> interiors and glass facades.

500|$|Working {{within this}} brief, they {{selected}} a triangular cross-section {{of the tower}} because it lent [...] "itself to <b>open</b> <b>plan</b> office layouts" [...] by allowing natural light to reach {{most parts of the}} working floors. Also, the stepped front of the building maximised the number of corner offices on each floor. The eastern and northern sides of the building are slip-formed concrete shear walls, and have fewer windows. These sides house the services of the building, including the lift shafts and stairwells. Some difficulty was encountered in the design stage with how to execute the diagonal slopes forming the top of these walls alongside the top five floors of the building, since a standard concrete pour was not possible. Instead, reinforced concrete panels were prefabricated elsewhere and subsequently attached to the structure.|$|E

500|$|The second {{series of}} Inside No. 9 was filmed {{from the end}} of 2014 into early 2015. [...] "Nana's Party" [...] was filmed in January, and was the final episode of the second series to be filmed.

A new one was thus added. The executive producer Adam Tandy suggested that deckhouse would be preferable to shed, as the latter term suggested the site of something awful. Scenes in a bedroom used the room mostly as the production team found it. The room featured a number of books not seen on-screen, which reminded Shearsmith of a script (in the end not used for Inside No. 9 second series) of an episode set in a library. The front room had a buffet, including a prawn ring; by the third day of filming, this had begun to smell, and needed to be removed.|$|E

The interior shots of the psychiatric hospital were filmed in a disused building owned by Riverview Hospital in [...] Coquitlam, and marked {{the first time that the}} crew met with producer R. W. Goodwin. The episode's final warehouse scene was filmed in a document warehouse belonging to the headquarters of the Canadian television network Knowledge. An office in the same building was also used for the boardroom meeting at the beginning of the episode. The scenes involving the Smoking Man required special permission to be filmed, in order to allow for actor William B. Davis to smoke in a public building. All of the interior shots of the FBI headquarters were filmed in the main newsroom of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, as the production crew found that the <b>open</b> <b>plan</b> offices they wished to represent no longer existed, having typically been converted into cubicles. However, it was found that working around the CBC's broadcast schedule was too unwieldy, and later episodes of the series replicated the location on a sound stage. The forest scenes were shot on location in Lynn Valley, in the Lower Seymour Conservation Reserve—formerly known as the Seymour Demonstration Forest. The crew spent $9,000 building wooden pathways for equipment, cast and crew to move easily through the area. Additional scenes were filmed at the headquarters for BC Hydro; whilst Scully's apartment was represented by a location used only in this episode and the third episode, [...] "Squeeze"—use of this location was discontinued once it became apparent that most reverse angles would show a large car park across the street.|$|E
