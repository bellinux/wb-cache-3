25|$|Under {{the control}} of Hinchcliffe and Holmes, who took over from the {{beginning}} of the twelfth season, Doctor Who became a much darker programme, with the pair being heavily influenced by Hammer Films' successful horror film productions and other gothic influences. Their era achieved the highest viewing figures (average ratings for Hinchcliffe's 3years were over 1million higher than the average for any <b>other</b> <b>producer)</b> and is frequently praised by fans as a highly successful one, with many serials from that period remaining fan favourites. However, the BBC received complaints from Mary Whitehouse of the National Viewers' and Listeners' Association, that the programme was unfit for children and could traumatise them. While the BBC publicly defended the programme, after three seasons Hinchcliffe was moved on to the adult police thriller series Target in 1977, and his replacement, Graham Williams, was specifically instructed to lighten the tone of the storylines.|$|E
25|$|Nathan-Turner {{had thought}} that he too would finally be leaving the series, but with no <b>other</b> <b>producer</b> {{available}} or {{willing to take on}} the series, he was instructed to remain. As a BBC staff producer, he {{had little choice but to}} either accept this or resign from the Corporation's staff. Not having expected to be producing season twenty-four, Nathan-Turner was left with little time to prepare, hiring inexperienced Andrew Cartmel as script editor on the advice of a friend who had run a BBC Drama Script Unit course that Cartmel had attended, and casting little-known Scottish actor Sylvester McCoy as the Seventh Doctor. In his first season, McCoy, a comedy actor, portrayed the character with a degree of clown-like humour, but Cartmel's influence soon changed that. The Seventh Doctor developed into a darker figure than any of his earlier incarnations, manipulating people like chess pieces and always seeming to be playing a deeper game than he ever let on.|$|E
500|$|The {{subject of}} the Nanking Massacre entered Chang's life again almost two decades later when she learned of {{producers}} who had completed documentary films about it. One of the producers was Shao Tzuping, who helped produce Magee's Testament, a film that contains footage of the Nanking Massacre itself, shot by the missionary John Magee. The <b>other</b> <b>producer</b> was Nancy Tong, who, together with Christine Choy, produced and co-directed In The Name of the Emperor, a film containing {{a series of interviews}} with Chinese, American, and Japanese citizens. [...] Chang began talking to Shao and Tong, and soon she was connected to a network of activists who felt the need to document and publicize the Nanking Massacre.|$|E

2500|$|Most critics {{praised the}} show, {{especially}} the score. However, {{the public and}} some critics received the show coolly. [...] A number felt the show took too many liberties {{in the use of}} racial slurs. When the show closed, Livent had filed for bankruptcy protection (Chapter 11). [...] Lincoln Center was the <b>other</b> <b>producer</b> solely responsible for covering the weekly running costs.|$|E
2500|$|The {{failures}} put {{her father}} temporarily out of business, and as no <b>other</b> <b>producer</b> {{invited her to}} star in musical comedy, she turned instead to music hall Variety shows. The Times later wrote {{that this was the}} first step in a new career as [...] "a comedienne specializing in cameo character sketches". After an early variety engagement in Manchester, the critic of The Manchester Guardian wrote of her [...] "pleasant voice and much charm of manner" [...] in sketches and songs: [...] "one may express a preference for Miss Courtneidge as the hospital sister, presented with all the bright graciousness which properly belongs to the character, over her more elaborate representation of the Flying Corps 'knut'." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1947, Wray {{was again}} {{approached}} by Lewton, then at Paramount Pictures, {{to write the}} screenplay {{about the life of}} Lucrezia Borgia that they had discussed before she left RKO. [...] Most of what is known about this project is found in chronicles of Lewton's career where, with minor variations, the authors suggest that the project initially belonged to some <b>other</b> <b>producer,</b> that Wray’s script (A Mask for Lucrezia) was abandoned or the project was cancelled, and that Lewton got permission to rework Wray's [...] "unused" [...] script, but that somehow “the project slipped out of his hands.” [...] This account does not align with Wray's history and appears to be based on a cover story for actions taken by Paramount {{in the early days of}} the Hollywood blacklist.|$|E

2500|$|The {{show was}} nearly {{complete}} {{in the fall}} of 1956, but almost everyone on the creative team needed to fulfill other commitments first. Robbins was involved with Bells Are Ringing, then Bernstein with Candide, and in January 1957 A Clearing in the Woods, Laurents' latest play, opened and quickly closed. When a backers' audition failed to raise any money for West Side Story late in the spring of 1957, only two months before the show was to begin rehearsals, producer Cheryl Crawford pulled out of the project. Every <b>other</b> <b>producer</b> had already turned down the show, deeming it too dark and depressing. Bernstein was despondent, but Sondheim convinced his friend Hal Prince, who was in Boston overseeing the out-of-town tryout of the new George Abbott musical New Girl in Town, to read the script. He liked it but decided to ask Abbott, his longtime mentor, for his opinion, and Abbott advised him to turn it down. Prince, aware that Abbott was the primary reason New Girl was in trouble, decided to ignore him, and he and his producing partner Robert Griffith flew to New York to hear the score. In his memoirs, Prince recalled, [...] "Sondheim and Bernstein sat at the piano playing through the music, and soon I was singing along with them." ...|$|E
