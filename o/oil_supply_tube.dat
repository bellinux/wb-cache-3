40|$|Face {{turning of}} optical {{surfaces}} on precision lathes needs high precision tool height adjustment, {{which may be}} a difficult and time-consuming task. In this paper we present a new tool adjustment mechanism based on varying the bearing gap height of the hydrostatic bearings present in precision lathe slides. Slide height variation is realised by influencing the flow to the bearing chambers. This is obtained by adding adjustable restrictions into the <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> <b>tubes.</b> The bearing stiffness change is limited and stays high in comparison with other machine elements. The realised system has a fine adjustment range of 20 urn, a resolution better than 0. 1 µm and a repeatability error lower than 0. 1 µm...|$|R

30|$|Figure  4 {{reveals a}} {{noticeable}} {{difference in the}} effect of <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shocks on real exchange rates across various quantiles. The sequence of the estimated coefficients can express the structure of <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shocks on real exchange rates. Panel A reveals the shock structure of <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> on <b>oil</b> exporting countries. The structure of shock tends to be inverse S-shaped. Unlike the median quantile, in the lower and upper quantiles, the estimated coefficient on the <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shock variables tends to be statistically distinguishable from zero. This implies that for significant US dollar depreciations, the shock is mostly negative, whereas for significant US dollar appreciations it is mostly positive. This pattern is clearly apparent for Canada, Norway and the United Kingdom. However, for Mexico, the shock structure of <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> tends to be inverse U-shaped. In both the lower and upper quantiles, the <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shocks have negative and statistically significant impacts on its real exchange rate. The structure of <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shocks on real exchange rates in oil-importing countries {{is shown in the}} Panel B. These shock structures tend to be U-shaped in most cases. At the lower quantiles, <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shocks have positive and statistically significant effects on both Japan and the European Union. However, at the upper quantiles, only for Japan are the <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shocks positive and statistically significant. Overall, the effects of <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shocks on real exchange rates have heterogeneous impacts on different countries and across various quantiles. In particular, for significant US dollar depreciation and appreciation, the impact of <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shocks on exchange rates is significantly distinguishable from zero.|$|R
40|$|World <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> {{disruptions}} lead to U. S. economic losses. Because oil is fungible in {{an integrated}} world oil market, increased oil consumption, whether from domestic or imported sources, increases the economic losses associated with <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> disruptions. Nevertheless, increased U. S. oil production expands stable <b>supplies</b> and dampens <b>oil</b> price shocks, whereas increased U. S. oil imports boosts the share of world <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> that comes from unstable producers and exacerbates oil price shocks. Some of the economic losses associated with <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> disruptions—gross domestic product losses and some transfers abroad—are externalities that can be quantified as oil security premiums. To estimate such premiums for domestic and imported oil, we take into account projected world oil market conditions, probable <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> disruptions, the market response to <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> disruptions, and the resulting U. S. economic losses. Our estimates quantify the security externalities associated with increased oil use, which derive from the expected U.

30|$|For a {{significant}} US dollar depreciation (at lower quantiles), the extreme impacts of <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> and demand shocks on exchange rates {{are shown in}} Table  4. For oil-exporting countries, the estimated coefficients on <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shock variables are negative and statistically significant for Canada, Mexico and the UK at the 0.01 quantile, and for Norway at the 0.05 quantile. While for oil-importing countries, <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shocks only have positive and significant impacts on exchange rate returns in the EU. These results can be easily explained. The <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shocks possibly reflect the discovery of new oil fields, better extraction technologies or a decline in OPEC’s control over the <b>oil</b> <b>supply.</b> Following an <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shock that alters the oil balance, the real exchange rate moves to ensure an offsetting adjustment in the non-oil trade balance in order to stabilize net foreign assets. Therefore, a positive <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shock has negative impacts (US dollar depreciation) on exchange rate returns in oil-exporting countries while having positive impacts (US dollar appreciation) in oil-importing countries.|$|R

40|$|The {{competing}} strategies between OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) and non-OPEC producers {{make the}} <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> market a complex system, and thus, {{it is very}} difficult to model and to make predictions. In this paper, we combine the macro-model based on game theory and micro-model to propose a new approach for forecasting <b>oil</b> <b>supply.</b> We take into account the microscopic behaviour in the clearing market and also use the game relationships to adjust <b>oil</b> <b>supplies</b> in our approach. For the supply model, we analyse and consider the different behaviour of non-OPEC and OPEC producers. According to our analysis, limiting the <b>oil</b> <b>supply,</b> and thus maintaining oil price, is the best strategy for OPEC in the low-price scenario, while the rising supply is the best strategy in the high-price scenario. No matter what the oil price is, the dominant strategy for non-OPEC producers is to increase their <b>oil</b> <b>supply.</b> In the high-price scenario, OPEC will try to deplete non-OPEC’s share in the <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> market, which is to OPEC’s advantage...|$|R

30|$|The {{identifying}} restrictions underlying Eq. (3) first {{imply that}} the <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> does not respond to oil demand or oil price shocks contemporaneously. This can be interpreted this way for the following reason: {{because of the high}} costs of changing production in the short run, oil producers are reluctant to change their output immediately following changes in demand. Secondly, oil demand changes in impact following an <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shock but not an oil price shock. This restriction is in line with the sluggish adjustment of global real economic activity due to movements in oil prices. Finally, the real oil price is assumed to respond to <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> and demand shocks within the month. This assumption is plausible, as any exogenous changes in crude <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> or the real economy are immediately reflected in oil prices.|$|R

40|$|Using a Time-Varying Parameters Bayesian Vector Autoregression model, we {{investigate}} how the dynamic effects of <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shocks on the US economy {{have changed over}} time. In contrast to previous studies, we identify <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shocks with sign restrictions which are derived from a simple supply and demand model of the global oil market. First, we find a remarkable structural change in the oil market itself, i. e. a typical <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shock {{is characterized by a}} much smaller impact on world oil production and a greater effect on the real price of crude oil over time. A steepening of the oil demand curve is the only possible explanation for this stylized fact. Accordingly, similar physical disturbances in oil production now have a significantly higher leverage effect on oil prices resulting in a stronger impact on real GDP and consumer prices. Second, we document that the contribution of <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shocks to fluctuations in the real price of oil has decreased considerably over time, implying that current oil price fluctuations are more demand driven. Third, <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> disturbances seem to have played a significant but non-exclusive role in the 1974 / 75 and early 1990 s recessions but were of minor importance in the 1980 / 81 and millennium slowdowns.
