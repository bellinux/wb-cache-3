40|$|For {{performing}} the availability {{accounting of the}} furnace for steel in the steel-making industry, {{it is necessary to}} know the availability <b>of</b> <b>steels</b> <b>and</b> scales, and the availability for scale formation.

5|$|Dreyfuss {{announced}} that unlike established wooden ballparks {{such as the}} Polo Grounds, he would build a three-tiered stadium out <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> <b>and</b> concrete to increase longevity—the {{first of its kind}} in the nation. Charles Wellford Leavitt, Jr. was contracted to design the stadium's grandstand. A civil engineer, Leavitt had founded an engineering and landscape architecture firm in 1897. He had gained experience in steel and concrete constructs while designing the Belmont and Saratoga racetracks. Based on Dreyfuss' architectural requirements, Leavitt presented a plan for Forbes Field—the only ballpark he would design. Pirates' manager Fred Clarke also had input into the stadium's design, giving groundskeepers advice on the field, in addition to designing and patenting a device to spread and remove a canvas tarpaulin over the infield in case of rain.|$|E

This government-funded and -operated factory was built at Hillington starting in June 1939 with workers moving into the premises in October, one month after the outbreak of war. The factory was fully occupied by September 1940. A housing crisis also occurred at Glasgow where Hives again asked the Air Ministry to step in.|$|E

5|$|The {{reduction}} of sulphur emissions {{had been an}} important factor since the station was in the design stages, as {{it was one of}} the main worries of those who protested the construction of the station. The London Power Company began developing an experimental technique for washing the flue gases in 1925. It used water and alkaline sprays over scrubbers <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> <b>and</b> timber in the flue ducts. The gases were subject to continuous washing, and with the presence of the catalyst iron oxide, sulphur dioxide was converted into sulphuric acid. Battersea Power Station was one of the first commercial applications of this technique in the world. This method of washing was stopped in the B Station in the 1960s, when it was discovered that the discharge of these products into the Thames was more harmful to the river than the gases would be to the atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|The {{industry}} {{has come under}} threat, both from {{a decline in the}} number of ships scrapped annually – down from 70–80 to about 20 – and because of environmental and work safety concerns. There have been complaints that journalists and human rights activists are being barred from the ship breaking yards. The ship breaking industry is purportedly damaging the local ecology as well, taking a toll on the fish population and soil quality. A survey conducted by students of the Institute of Marine Science of Chittagong University in 2007 revealed that the soil of the locality is polluted by heavy metals including mercury (0.5 to 2.7ppm), lead (0.5 to 21.8ppm), chromium (220ppm), cadmium (0.3 to 2.9ppm), iron (2.6 to 5.6ppm), calcium (5.2 to 23.2ppm) and magnesium (6.5 to 10.57ppm). Safety standards in the industry are low; between 1995 and 2005, 150 workers were killed and 576 were maimed or injured. The main causes of death were fire or explosion, suffocation and inhaling CO2. These old ships also contain hazardous substances like asbestos, lead paint, heavy metals and PCBs. The workers are paid US$1.75 a day and have little access to medical treatment. Among the workers, 41% of are aged between 18 and 22 years, and many are reported to be as young as 10 years of age. There have also been allegations of large quantities <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> <b>and</b> non-ferrous items, such as bronze, aluminum, copper, and bronze-amalgam recovered from ship breaking being smuggled out of Bangladesh. There also are reports of pirates targeting tugboats pulling ships in.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: By mean of {{potential}} energy various principles,the governing differential equations <b>of</b> the <b>steel</b> <b>and</b> concrete composite girder in considering relative slips between <b>steel</b> girders <b>and</b> concrete slabs and shear lag {{effects of the}} flanges and the concrete slab are derived. The equations are solved by Galerkin method. It is shown from the calculating example that the proposed method not only is easy to calculate, but also has high convergent speed. Introdution The <b>steel</b> <b>and</b> concrete composite structure is a new-type structure based on <b>steel</b> structure <b>and</b> reinforced concrete structure. The <b>steel</b> <b>and</b> concrete composite girder is the most useful composite structure. In the action of load, the shear lag effect will produce in the flange <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> girder <b>and</b> concrete slab of the composite structure. Since the shear connector between <b>steel</b> girder <b>and</b> concrete slab has some flexiblity, there is slip on the composite surface <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> girder <b>and</b> concrete slab. Therefore the influence of slips and shear lags should be considered {{for the purpose of}} analysing the mechanical behaviour of the structrue reliably.
