50|$|The {{market for}} men's pantyhose has {{continued}} to grow steadily since 1999. While ActivSkin, the leading seller of male <b>pantyhose</b> <b>and</b> <b>tights,</b> does not release specific sales data, they now sell to customers worldwide in 76 countries and have reported growth each year since their inception. An important component of that growth is continued expansion of public awareness of this phenomenon. On March 14, 2012, Forbes magazine indicated that mantyhose {{could be the next}} billion dollar undergarment idea.|$|R
5000|$|In American English, the {{difference}} between <b>pantyhose</b> <b>and</b> <b>tights</b> is determined in {{the weight of the}} yarn used and the thickness to which the garment is knitted. Generally, anything up to 40 denier in the leg or overall is known as <b>pantyhose</b> <b>and</b> anything over can be classified as tights, as for example 'running tights' and 'cycling tights'. In the United Kingdom, the word [...] "tights" [...] is used in all cases when referring to <b>pantyhose,</b> <b>and</b> [...] "leggings" [...] for footless tights of heavier, normally opaque material. Tights can be sheer yet solid in colour, whereas leggings are almost or absolute opaque, not sheer. Thus the almost opaque tights are not suited as pants.|$|R
50|$|To manage public {{relations}} and serve as spokesman for issues related to men's pantyhose in the U.S. media, GLS hired Steve Newman in 2009. The company expects to reach a tipping point {{in the near future}} with respect to public perception and growth of the male <b>pantyhose</b> <b>and</b> <b>tights</b> trend. As an addition to the constantly expanding family of men's legwear manufacturers, there is another producer in Eastern Europe called Tim Legwear that is testing the local market with men's <b>tights</b> <b>and</b> leggings. Men's <b>tights</b> also account for 2-3% of the business of Italian legwear designer Emilio Cavallini.|$|R
50|$|The {{increased}} {{popularity of}} higher hemlines in women's clothing {{has resulted in}} increased and increasing exposure of legs. Initially, the shortened dresses {{were associated with the}} popularity of legwear which continued to cover the legs wholly or in part, such as socks and stockings. The introduction of the miniskirt and the microskirt saw a change to <b>pantyhose</b> or <b>tights</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> leggings. However, there has been an increasing trend towards women not wearing any legwear with short dresses and skirts, and high hemlines, except on formal occasions.|$|R

5000|$|The {{slipperiness}} and smoothness {{of sheer}} <b>pantyhose</b> <b>and</b> stockings also makes women's low cut court shoes slip off more easily.

50|$|This {{used to be}} {{the case}} but in the UK, local {{authorities}} accept clean, dry textiles along with other recyclables. This is both at recycling centres and curb-side collections.

There are several internet sites which explain ways of reusing pantyhose (laddered or otherwise).|$|R

The sculptures were made from everyday objects like <b>pantyhose,</b> <b>and</b> parts were filled with sand. The finished sculptures often evoked on the forms of sagging breasts and testicles. For her, the use of pantyhose as a material reflected the elasticity of the human body.|$|R

5000|$|The most {{compelling}} {{work on the}} program was [...] "Mercy," [...] a new solo for Kramer that examined - with both humor and poignancy - the increasing violence against women. Kramer began the dance dressed in only a bra <b>and</b> <b>pantyhose,</b> <b>and</b> in a reverse striptease, slowly added other undergarments, some clutched between her teeth, others wrapped around her head and legs [...] Women, Kramer appeared to say, are trapped {{in a web of}} society's own images and expectations. As the dance ended and the mournful score grew in intensity, Kramer appeared visibly moved by her own performance. It was a powerful and intimate moment." [...] --Andrew Dreyfus, The Boston Herald, June 2, 1993.|$|R
