5|$|In 1845, Arago {{suggested}} to Fizeau and Foucault that {{they attempt to}} measure the speed of light. Sometime in 1849, however, {{it appears that the}} two had a falling out, and they parted ways pursuing separate means of performing this experiment. In 1848−49, Fizeau used, not a rotating mirror, but a toothed wheel apparatus to perform an absolute measurement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> light in air. In 1850, Fizeau and Foucault both used rotating mirror devices to perform relative measures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> light in air versus water. Foucault used a scaled-up version of the rotating mirror apparatus to perform an absolute measurement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> light in 1862. Subsequent experiments performed by Marie Alfred Cornu in 1872–76 and by Albert A. Michelson in 1877–1931 used improved versions of the toothed wheel and rotating mirror experiments to make steadily more accurate estimates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> light.|$|E

5|$|The first {{quantitative}} estimate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> {{light was}} made in 1676 by Rømer (see Rømer's determination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> light). From the observation that the periods of Jupiter's innermost moon Io appeared to be shorter when the Earth was approaching Jupiter than when receding from it, he concluded that light travels at a finite speed, and estimated that it takes light 22 minutes to cross the diameter of Earth's orbit. Christiaan Huygens combined this estimate with an estimate for {{the diameter of the}} Earth's orbit to obtain an estimate of speed of light of , 26% lower than the actual value.|$|E

5|$|Among animals, {{there exists}} a single known example of an {{apparently}} freely-rotating structure, though it is used for digestion rather than propulsion: the crystalline style of certain bivalves and gastropods. The style consists of a transparent glycoprotein rod which is continuously formed in a cilia-lined sac and extends into the stomach. The cilia rotate the rod, so that it becomes wrapped in strands of mucus. As the rod slowly dissolves in the stomach, it releases digestive enzymes. Estimates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> rotation of the style in vivo vary significantly, and it is unclear if the style is rotated continuously or intermittently.|$|E

5|$|At this time, the {{efficacy}} of the Chapman–Jouguet model was still in doubt, and it was the subject of studies by John von Neumann at the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study. Kistiakowsky realized that the deviations from hydrodynamic theory were the result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> the chemical reactions themselves. To control the reaction, calculations down to the microsecond level were needed. Section 8 was drawn into the investigation of shaped charges, whose mechanism was explained by Taylor and James Tuck in 1943.|$|E
5|$|If a photon {{did have}} non-zero mass, {{there would be}} other effects as well. Coulomb's law would be {{modified}} and the electromagnetic field would have an extra physical degree of freedom. These effects yield more sensitive experimental probes of the photon mass than the frequency dependence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> light. If Coulomb's law is not exactly valid, then {{that would allow the}} presence of an electric field to exist within a hollow conductor when it is subjected to an external electric field. This thus allows one to test Coulomb's law to very high precision. A null result of such an experiment has set a limit of m ≲ 10−14eV/c2.|$|E

5|$|In 1850 and in 1862, Léon Foucault made {{improved}} determinations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> light substituting {{a rotating}} mirror for Fizeau's toothed wheel. (Figure2) The apparatus involves light from slit S reflecting off a rotating mirror R, forming {{an image of}} the slit on the distant stationary mirror M, which is then reflected back to reform {{an image of the}} original slit. If mirror R is stationary, then the slit image will reform at S regardless of the mirror's tilt. The situation is different, however, if R is in rapid rotation.|$|E
5|$|In 1889 {{there was}} no {{generally}} accepted theory regarding the nature of light but by 1960 the wavelength of specific light spectra could give a more accurate and reproducible value than a prototype metre. In that year the prototype metre {{was replaced by a}} formal definition that defines the metre in terms of the wavelength of specified light spectra. By 1983 it was accepted that the speed of light in vacuum was constant and that this constant provided a more reproducible procedure for measuring length. Therefore, the metre was redefined in terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> light. These definitions give a much better reproducibility and also allow anyone, anywhere with a suitably equipped laboratory, to make a standard metre.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 20th century much {{progress}} was made in increasing the accuracy of measurements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> light, first by cavity resonance techniques and later by laser interferometer techniques. These were aided by new, more precise, definitions of the metre and second. In 1950, Louis Essen determined the speed as , using cavity resonance. This value was adopted by the 12th General Assembly of the Radio-Scientific Union in 1957. In 1960, the metre was redefined in terms of the wavelength of a particular spectral line of krypton-86, and, in 1967, the second was redefined in terms of the hyperfine transition frequency of the ground state of caesium-133.|$|E

However, these jets are not moving at speeds in excess <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> light: the apparent superluminal motion is a projection effect caused by objects moving near {{the speed of light}} and approaching Earth at a small angle to the line of sight: since the light which was emitted when the jet was farther away took longer to reach the Earth, the time between two successive observations corresponds to a longer time between the instants at which the light rays were emitted.|$|E

5|$|Until {{the early}} modern period, it was not known whether light {{travelled}} instantaneously or at a very fast finite speed. The first extant recorded examination of this subject was in ancient Greece. The ancient Greeks, Muslim scholars, and classical European scientists long debated this until Rømer provided the first calculation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> light. Einstein's Theory of Special Relativity concluded that {{the speed of light}} is constant regardless of one's frame of reference.

40|$|Local {{preconditioning}} for Eulerian-Eulerian gas-solid flow calculations with variable {{gas density}} is investigated. <b>The</b> performance <b>of</b> simultaneous solution algorithms for low-Mach calculations is {{strongly related to}} preconditioning. The gas-solid drag source terms are at <b>the</b> origin <b>of</b> a solid volume fraction and frequency dependency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mixture <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> sound [1]. Whereas <b>the</b> solid volume fraction dependency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mixture <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> sound is straightforward to account for in the gas-solid preconditioner, {{this is not the}} case with the frequency dependency, the frequency not being an extra calculation variable. The preconditioners used so far in the gas-solid flow literature do not account for or eliminate <b>the</b> frequency dependency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mixture <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> sound and transfer <b>the</b> problem to <b>the</b> numerical <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> sound. Not accounting for <b>the</b> frequency dependency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mixture <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> sound in <b>the</b> gas-solid preconditioner results, however, in drastic convergence slow down [2, 3], even when a fully implicit treatment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drag source terms is taken. Possible approaches to account for <b>the</b> frequency dependency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mixture <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> sound in <b>the</b> gas-solid preconditioner are investigated. It is shown that the gas-solid preconditioner does not need to remove <b>the</b> frequency dependency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mixture <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> sound, but should account for it and be scaled according to <b>the</b> mixture <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> sound at <b>the</b> highest frequency calculated, that is <b>the</b> filter frequency mixture <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> sound, which logically depends on the local mesh resolution.
