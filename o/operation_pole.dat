As part of <b>Operation</b> <b>Pole</b> Star in February, 1943, the 311th, along with three other rifle divisions, three rifle brigades, and a tank brigade, attacked the defenses of the German 96th Infantry Division in the sector south of Smerdynia.

40|$|Pole phase {{modulated}} (PPM) multiphase {{induction motor}} (IM) drives for applications like ship propulsion starts with high <b>pole</b> mode of <b>operation</b> to provide high starting torque required and then switch over to low <b>pole</b> mode of <b>operation</b> for steady run with high speeds. The {{performance of the}} nine phase PPM IM drive in case of nine phase four <b>pole</b> <b>operation</b> is inherently good due to high phase number even with a two level inverter. In case of high <b>pole</b> mode of <b>operation</b> (3 phase 12 pole) of the PPM IM drive the torque ripple is not within the acceptable range of safe limits, which brings in the need of multilevel voltage excitation to achieve better performance. Conventional multilevel inverters for nine phase IM suffers with problems such as capacitor voltage balancing issues and considerably high device count. In case of three phase twelve <b>pole</b> <b>operation</b> of the PPM IM drive each phase voltage {{is the sum of}} voltage across the three equal voltage profile coils (EVPC). In This paper the advantage of EVPC is exploited to generate a multilevel voltage across each phase using phase shifted carrier PWM keeping the device count same as 2 level nine phase inverter. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is shown by FEA simulation in ANSYS Maxwell and simplorer environment. Significant reduction in torque ripple magnitude and increase in torque ripple frequency is observed in case of 3 phase 12 <b>pole</b> <b>operation...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} a new method of {{adapting}} the Orthogonal Block Adaptive Line Enhancer (OBALE) is proposed {{based on the}} least-mean square class of algorithms.

The adaptive algorithm {{is derived from the}} Normalised LMS and the Recursive LMS algorithms for the orthogonal block filter. Stability monitoring is required to ensure the adaptive poles do not move outside the unit circle but this is shown to be very simple, adding just two extra <b>operations</b> per <b>pole</b> to the algorithm.

50|$|The South <b>Pole</b> <b>operation</b> base is {{designed}} to house a large international team of engineers and scientists.

When completed and activated, these mega-thrusters would serve to literally move the Earth more than 400,000 kilometers out of its orbit in 100 days until it was safely out of range of both the approaching star Gorath and its devastating gravity well, and then move the Earth back into its proper orbit once the danger had completely passed.|$|R
30|$|Fault {{direction}} estimation during SPT condition using {{positive sequence}} components can be possible. However, during single <b>pole</b> <b>operation</b> in applications with line-side potential, eventual corruption of polarizing quantity can occur if the input voltage {{to the memory}} circuit is corrupted. Invalid memory polarization may cause directional element malfunction. For this reason, the positive sequence voltage input to the polarizing memory is generally eliminated when the voltage is distorted [29]. To overcome from this problem a positive sequence current based approach is proposed in this paper. The method requires only current information measured at relay location {{to decide whether the}} fault is in forward side or reverse side. The performance of the method is independent of CT location.|$|R

The MPM has shown promise {{in the field of}} adjustable speed drives for large machines and in the field of wind energy electrical generation. The operation of MPM relies on the interaction between the two fields produced by the two stator windings through the intermediate action of a specially designed rotor (nested-cage or reluctance rotor). The machine theory is described from a physical aspect rather than mathematical derivations. A simple representation is also presented, from which the machine d–q model can be readily deduced.
