Based on these criteria, it then assesses the performance of Hopfield networks and Associative Memory systems and identifies their operational limitations. This leads to the introduction of Randomized Internal Representations, a novel class of neural network systems which stores information in a fully distributed way yet is capable of encoding and utilizing context.

To study driving {{performance}} {{in people with}} homonymous hemianopia (HH) assessed in the official on-road test of practical fitness to drive by the Dutch driver's licensing authority (CBR). METHODS. Data were collected from a cohort (January 2010 -July 2012) of all people with HH following the official relicensure trajectory at Royal Dutch Visio and the CBR in the Netherlands. Driving performance during the official on-road tests of practical fitness to drive was scored by professional experts on practical fitness to drive, using the visual impairments protocol and a standardized scoring of visual, tactical and operational aspects. Age ranged from 27 to 72 years (mean = 52, SD = 11. 7) and time since onset of the visual field defect ranged from 6 to 41 months (mean = 15, SD = 7. 5). RESULTS. Fourteen (54 %) participants were judged as fit to drive. Besides poor visual scanning during driving, specific tactical, and <b>operational</b> <b>weaknesses</b> were observed in people with HH that were evaluated as unfit to drive. Results suggest that judgement on practical fitness to drive cannot be based on solely the visual field size.

40|$|Why do the {{humanitarian}} principles, {{human rights and}} other aims espoused by NGOs apparently fail to influence the reality of assistance delivery, whilst reality does not dint these objectives. Drawing on literature concerning assistance, the political economy {{in which it is}} given, and psychological dimensions of regulation, I investigate the nature and function of objectives stated by aid providers. I argue that whereas discourse is manoeuvred to approve whatever NGOs undertake, the assistance delivered is so far from its objectives as to question what guidance they offer and their strategic merit. Additionally, the NGOs' approach disregards failure by allowing <b>operational</b> <b>weaknesses</b> to blame or discredit others, rather than being acknowledged to reflect on interventions. This screens assistance from evaluation or reform, whilst overlooking on-going suffering. My methodology combines an analysis of donor and NGO policy-making with an empirical investigation of how people are given, or excluded from, assistance. I find that aid agencies maximise returns on a politically constructed morality. Where these are high, as in the cases of Sierra Leone and Rwanda, a consensus of sorts is reached between aid providers and governments, and some people benefit from assistance. The consensus, though, marginalises opposition groups and people in their territory. In the Democratic Republic of Congo and southern Sudan, no consensus emerged and the contexts offered nothing to aid providers; most people received no genuine help. In all countries, NGOs deemed political and military activity illegitimate, thereby forestalling dialogue and limiting their perception of the situation; these factors cast doubt on the sincerity of the interventions. I conclude that people in countries at war are not 'breaking the rules' of assistance - as assistance is not meaningfully 'ruled' by rights or principles - they are more fundamentally 'not playing the game'...|$|R
40|$|The {{thesis is}} an evaluative {{case study in}} the interpretive {{paradigm}} of five-years of collaboration between three universities; one Belarusian, one British and one French. The collaboration, funded by the European Union's 'TEMPUS' programme, was intended to strengthen institutional mangement at the Belarusian host university following its foundation in 1992. The research proceeded responsively, adapting to circumstances and conditions as it sought to remain relevant and use appropriate research tools to progress with the enquiry. Eventually four phases were completed including {{the production of a}} thick description Case Record which was referred (0 constantly in dialogue with informants in the phases of the research. The analysis of the case considers the relevance of the standard project cycle management blueprint by examining the formal project cycle in the light of rich contextual information and reflecting upon the project's outcomes (planned and achieved) and the activities performed. Insight into the social psychology of intemational cooperation is also offered by the case study, drawing from and building upon theories of project management across cultures. The study shows that many of the by-products of the collaboration planned in the original project description were of doubtful relevance and were transitory or superficial although some changes tumed out to have long-term sustainability. The findings challenge perceptions of good practice at project. institution and programme level, which others may relate to their own experience. Of particular importance, the research established that the project cycle itself introduced <b>operational</b> <b>weaknesses</b> and imposed limitations which prejudiced team and individual effectiveness.

30|$|Another {{reason for}} the usage of test cases is the {{recognition}} that real data from a specific system is likely sensitive to critical infrastructure security (Committee on Increasing National Resilience to Hazards and Disasters and Committee on Science Engineering and Public Policy 2012; Department of Homeland Security 2013; Haimes et al. 2008; The White House: Office of the Press Secretary 2013). The security and economic prosperity of daily life depend on functional transportation and power systems. On the power system side, specific system data which {{may be used to}} conduct reliability studies and pinpoint <b>operational</b> <b>weaknesses</b> in the power grid may also be subsequently used nefariously by unauthorized personnel. The usage of generic test cases allows the development of reliability methods in the power systems field without sharing sensitive information. On the transportation system side, specific system data (i.e. GIS data) is inevitably available to support commercial and personal daily activity. As a result, much transportation system research uses specific system data. Developing methods in transportation system resilience are able to pinpoint the transportation system artifacts that have the greatest impact on system vulnerability when eliminated (Albert et al. 2000; Farid 2015 d; 2014; Harary and Hayes 1993; Holme et al. 2002; Ip and Wang 2011; Najjar and Gaudiot 1990; Rosenkrantz et al. 2009; Salles and Marino 2011; Whitson and Ramirez-Marquez 2009). That said, one must distinguish between the data necessary to support public activity (i.e. maps) and the detailed data (i.e. capacities, traffic patterns) required to conduct accurate and dynamic resilience studies. While the former can remain publicly available, the latter can remain proprietary; thus motivating the development of standardized test cases. Ultimately, these reliability and resilience concerns must be given even greater attention when studying the transportation-electricity nexus as a combination of two critical infrastructures. For example, Hurricane Sandy demonstrated that emergency preparedness and evacuation capability in the greater New York City area depended on both an operational power grid and a fully functional (electrified) public transportation system (Anonymous-DOE 2013; Committee on Increasing National Resilience to Hazards and Disasters and Committee on Science Engineering and Public Policy 2012; Department of Homeland Security 2013; Marcacci 2013; TheWhite House: Office of the Press Secretary 2013).|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this thesis identifies {{the need to develop}} a strategy specially designed to improve the operational performance of functional layouts. The traditional approach has been to replace functional layouts with product-oriented layouts such as cellular manufacturing or flow lines. However, conditions exist in some functionally organised factories that prevent changes to the factory layout being made. In such cases, a number of tactics, operational strategies and concepts were identified which are capable of addressing the <b>operational</b> <b>weaknesses</b> of functional layouts. These include lean, agile and virtual cellular manufacturing. It was these concepts, which influenced {{the development of a new}} manufacturing strategy for functional layouts called virtual groups. Virtual groups are groups of machines with the potential to form physical manufacturing cells. This potential is limited by the difficulty of moving machines and shortages in the number of machines available to populate manufacturing cells. Virtual groups are virtual° because although they are considered as manufacturing cells, the constituent machines are physically dispersed throughout the factory. There are two key aspects of virtual groups. The first is the opportunity to replace the focus on °processes° with a focus on products'. This is achieved by replacing process managers with group managers who are responsible for the production of products rather than the management of processes, to whom all the production resources required to produce a family of parts/products are assigned. The second aspect is the assignment of the most appropriate production strategy to each virtual group. This presents the opportunity to target the production capabilities and management policies that will best address the market conditions in which the products will compete. Other benefits of virtual groups are expected to include lower WIP, improved quality, on-time delivery and reduced throughput times. Also {{presented in this}} thesis is the development of a new methodology for the formation of virtual groups called enhanced production flow analysis. Enhanced production flow analysis has been developed to identify virtual groups of machines and families of parts, which each virtual group is responsible for producing. Initially it was believed that elements of J. L Burbidge's production flow analysis could be used to form virtual groups however the first trial of the methodology showed that to identify the most appropriate virtual groups some enhancements were required, particularly to the method for forming modules. The ability of enhanced production flow analysis to form virtual groups was successfully tested through the use of two data sets collected from two different Pirelli factories. In both cases, opportunities were identified to form lean process-oriented virtual groups and agile product-oriented virtual groups. The formation of process-oriented virtual groups is not ideal, as some of the machines will continue to be managed in a functionally organised group. However, their existence signals the relevance of virtual groups over cellular manufacturing...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION Health data in low- {{and middle-income}} {{countries}} are often inconsistent and of poor quality, or simply non-existent. This impedes {{the ability of}} countries themselves {{and the international community}} to arrive at a precise understanding of national burden of disease patterns. The sophisticated statistical modeling and projection methods used internationally to compensate for missing country data cannot provide more than ‘best estimates,’ with no possibility of verifying their outputs. The result is continuing unnecessary morbidity and mortality, often in children under five years of age, as data deficiency translates into insufficient information to guide policy and technical interventions, and to enable prioritization in resource dissemination. This research therefore aims to assess {{the quality and quantity of}} data available at country level for the purpose of estimating the burden of disease. It highlights the frequently weak and fragmented nature of what data is present, together with capacity deficiencies at both institutional and individual level to gather, analyse and interpret health and related data. A particular focus is placed on assessing the burden of disease attributable to environmental risk factors, specifically for unsafe water, sanitation and hygiene, together with those elements of malnutrition deriving directly from these factors. Combining these two sets of risk factors to derive estimates of their burden of disease at country level is a new approach and not yet undertaken by countries. METHODS Case-study is the central method used. Two country cases (Uganda and Mozambique) were selected by convenience sampling as WHO missions on related topics were taking place at this time. Detailed information on institutional and individual data understanding and capacity was obtained through semi-structured interviews. Extensive evaluation or assessment of existing data and internationally applied methodologies has also been carried out to demonstrate the extent and impact of the present data weakness and paucity that form the rationale for carrying out this work. Other cases have been used to demonstrate the synthesis of water, sanitation and hygiene statistics and methods with those of malnutrition. RESULTS Enabling a move from globally generated estimates based on limited national data in which country users have little confidence, to better quality and reliable statistics based on stronger national data is the root of this study. Having clarified the health impacts of data deficiency, its principal contribution is the development and testing of a tool to overcome these deficiencies, offering country users a way to radically improve their national data systems. A prototype National Burden of Disease (NBD) Toolkit had earlier been developed by WHO but had <b>operational</b> <b>weaknesses</b> and hence poor uptake by countries. Moving from problem analysis to problem solving, this study has devised a method of linking the various spreadsheets comprising the NBD, creating a logical, simplified, and systematic interface between its elements and thereby making it easier and more appealing to the user. The tool, with its user-friendly interface, can thus now become a suitable support to national-level burden of disease estimation work, and contribute to creating further awareness of the value of timely data and their role in health development. DISCUSSION The present scope of work with the tool and interface fills a pressing gap, yet is limited. Further testing in a wider range of countries in different geographic regions is needed. Nonetheless, the initial results and growing uptake give confidence that this and similar future approaches will fall on fertile ground. As country-level institutions become more accustomed to using tools of this kind to fill long-standing data gaps and quality issues, it can be anticipated that they will feel greater confidence in their own data, reduced reliance on internationally-generated estimates and projections that are frequently not well understood, and an increased sense of ownership over the national process. CONCLUSION Greater capacity and confidence in the domain of data management will feed directly into health research and improvements in health planning and interventions. Key among these are improvements in access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene – an area in which data are notoriously elusive. As the world now moves towards a revised global framework for development goals and targets after 2015, a stronger and more effective evidence base is more critical than ever...|$|R
40|$|Snook, Taylor, and Bennell (Applied Cognitive Psychology, 2004 vol. 18, pp. 105 - 121) {{have carried}} out some elegant, but rather simple-minded experiments, which demonstrate, unsurprisingly, {{that people can}} employ limited {{geometrical}} principles in a sensible way. Having drawn these principles from a literature on the geographical patterns found in criminal behaviour, Snook et al. suggest that most people could geographically profile crimes {{without the need for}} much training or assistance from commercially available geographic profiling software. Rossmo (Applied Cognitive Psychology, 2005 vol. 19, pp. 651 - 654) challenges this suggestion by claiming that the experiments ignore the practical limits to the application of geometrical principles derived from criminals' spatial behaviour. These challenges are more appropriately construed as sources of error in the modelling of criminal behavioural geography than as <b>operational</b> constraints. Current <b>weaknesses</b> in the modelling of criminal actions show the need for a deeper understanding of offenders' decision processes. This debate also draws attention to the need for research on how investigators can actually make use of decision support systems derived from studies of criminal behaviour. Geographic profiling is not a distinct process but a set of hypotheses about patterns in criminal cognitions and actions. These hypotheses are worthy of further development and test rather than being left in the realm of detective hunch and conjecture. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
40|$|In most European states, large {{stretches}} of forest are public property. In Austria, 15 {{percent of the}} country's forests belong {{to the federal government}} (Austrian Federal Forests, ÖBF), and another 3 percent {{are in the hands of}} provinces and communities. Public ownership of forests has its roots in history, but is difficult to justify in economic terms. The society's interest in preserving the welfare (i. e., protective and recreational) function of the forest is assured by the forestry law, which, for 150 years, has set strict standards for forest management, and open access to forests for the public was first granted 25 years ago. ÖBF was a federally operated enterprise until 1997. State enterprises are usually less efficient than their privately owned counterparts, the consequence of limited decision-making powers, rigid and strictly regulated workflows and a wage system not affected by the economic success or failure of an operation. The <b>operational</b> and managerial <b>weaknesses</b> suffered by ÖBF were to be overcome by turning it into a public limited company (under sole federal ownership).

These included; huge and unattainable foreign debts, excessive budget deficits, huge contractual payment arrears, poor construction performance, corruption and pressure from international financial institutions forced the government to become committed to the reform of public procurement which culminated in the passage of the Public Procurement Act 2003 (Act 663). Public Procurement is the process by which government purchases goods, works and services using public funds. The Public Procurement Act 2003 (Act 663) was enacted as an act of Parliament to provide for public procurement in Ghana. This has a direct impact on the successful delivery of government projects and public services, sound public financial management by achieving value for money in government expenditure, reducing corruption and encouraging private sector growth and investment...|$|R
40|$|Original {{scientific}} paper Strategic planning {{which focuses}} on transport is based fundamentally on adjusting {{to changes in the}} <b>operational</b> environment. Strengths, <b>Weaknesses,</b> Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) analysis is a commonly used tool for analyzing both the internal and external environments in order to attain a systematic approach and support for a decision-making situation. In this study, we show how some weaknesses of SWOT analysis can be avoided and how it can be elaborated upon in order to provide a more comprehensive decision support. The research was based on expert interviews, which were structured according to the principles of value-focused thinking and SWOT analysis. FA'WOT is a hybrid method combining the well known SWOT analysis and the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP). This paper presents modification of the Saaty-s scale, in which fuzzy numbers have been used for determining weight values of criteria and alternatives. Unlike the papers describing the procedure of fuzzification of the AHP/ANP method, the method described here takes into account the level of uncertainty of the decision maker. After application of the AHP/ANP method in this way, the values of the functions criteria for each considered alternative are obtained. Certain values of the level of certainty are corresponding to the obtained values of the functions criteria. It is possible to generate various sets of the values of criterion functions. Using this procedure it is possible to identify and rank the factors affecting the functioning of a system. FAHP’s connection to SWOT yields analytically determined priorities for the factors included in SWO...|$|R
40|$|Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) are {{susceptible}} {{to a variety of}} attacks that threaten their operation and the provided services. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) may act as defensive mechanisms, since they monitor network activities in order to detect malicious actions performed by intruders, and then initiate the appropriate countermeasures. IDS for MANETs have attracted much attention recently and thus, there are many publications that propose new IDS solutions or improvements to the existing. This paper evaluates and compares the most prominent IDS architectures for MANETs. IDS architectures are defined as the operational structures of IDSs. For each IDS, the architecture and the related functionality are briefly presented and analyzed focusing on both the <b>operational</b> strengths and <b>weaknesses.</b> Moreover, methods/techniques that have been proposed to improve the performance and the provided security services of those are evaluated and their shortcomings or weaknesses are presented. A comparison of the studied IDS architectures is carried out using a set of critical evaluation metrics, which derive from: (i) the deployment, architectural, and operational characteristics of MANETs; (ii) the special requirements of intrusion detection in MANETs; and (iii) the carried analysis that reveals the most important strengths and weaknesses of the existing IDS architectures. The evaluation metrics of the IDSs are divided into two groups: the first one is related to performance and the second to security. Finally, based on the carried evaluation and comparison a set of design features and principles are presented, which have to be addressed and satisfied in future research of designing and implementing IDSs for MANETs...|$|R
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "While repayments, dividends, and interest from institutions participating in the Capital Purchase Program (CPP) have exceeded the programs original investment disbursements, the number of missed payments has increased {{over the life of}} the program. As of January 31, 2012, the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) had received $ 211. 5 billion from its CPP investments, exceeding the $ 204. 9 billion it had disbursed. Of that amount, $ 16. 7 billion remains outstanding, and most of these investments were concentrated in a relatively small number of institutions. In particular, as of January 31, 2012, 25 institutions accounted for $ 11. 2 billion, or 67 percent, of outstanding investments. As of November 30, 2011, Treasury estimated that CPP would have a lifetime income of $ 13. 5 billion after all institutions exited the program. As of January 31, 2012, 341 institutions had exited CPP, almost half by repaying CPP with funds from other federal programs. Institutions continue to exit CPP, but the number of institutions missing scheduled dividend or interest payments has increased. For example, as of November 30, 2011, the number of institutions that had missed their quarterly payments rose to 158, a marked increase from 8 in February 2009, even though CPP had fewer participants. The number of CPP institutions designated as problem banksthat is, demonstrating financial, <b>operational,</b> or managerial <b>weaknesses</b> that threatened their continued financial viabilityalso rose from 47 in December 2009 to 130 in December 2011. Institutions that continue to miss payments and problem institutions may have difficulty ever fully repaying their CPP investments. ...|$|R
30|$|Commercialization of the steam-assisted gravity {{drainage}} (SAGD) process has made recovery of heavy oil/bitumen {{possible in a}} number of reservoirs hindered by hydrocarbon immobility. However, the economics of this process are highly sensitive to the efficiency of steam creation, delivery, and use, with a successful and unsuccessful SAGD well pair often separated by how effectively thermal inefficiencies can be mitigated in the flow profiles of steam injection and/or in emulsion recovery. To improve flow profiles, Albertan SAGD completions have experimented with the addition of flow control devices (FCDs). These completion tools have historically been used to regulate liquid inflow across long producing laterals, adding a variable pressure drop along the lateral to improve the conformance of hydrocarbon production and delay water breakthrough; within SAGD completions, FCDs find novel use to force a more even flow distribution of steam in the injector and a thermally dependent inflow profile in the producer to maximize recovery of heavy oil/bitumen. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of different FCD designs, discussing their respective methods of regulation, the fluid-adaptive behavior of “autonomous” FCDs, <b>operational</b> strengths and <b>weaknesses</b> of different commercial offerings, and suggestions on how to use existing pressure loss models for FCDs and apply them to the non-traditional application of regulating SAGD flow profiles, both for equipment sizing and estimation of pressure loss/flow rates across the device. From this work, it is proposed that use of autonomous FCDs in the production lateral are of greater value than use of flow control in the injector; however maximum benefits are achieved by coupling simple orifice-style FCDs in the injector lateral with autonomous, large flow path (non-orifice) FCDs capable of controlling steam flash events in the production well.|$|R
40|$|Studies {{on local}} {{governmental}} financial conditions {{are focused on}} developing tools for detecting and avoiding potential financial problems. These studies are confined mostly in self-governed local government entities in the western world. This research seeks to measure financial conditions of local government organisations in Bangladesh. Municipalities, {{one of the two}} types of urban local government, {{play an important role in}} providing a range of services and carrying out certain socioeconomic objectives in Bangladesh. Using financial data from a representative sample of 72 municipalities, this research measures and compares municipal financial conditions of local government municipalities in Bangladesh. A composite index of eleven indicators was developed under four dimensions, viz., short term solvency, budgetary solvency, service level solvency and long term solvency by following the relevant literature on local government financial conditions as well as keeping consistency with data availability. This composite index was applied to measure the financial conditions of the three classes (Class I, II and III) of municipalities in Bangladesh for a period 2007 to 2015. Results obtained indicate that there are differences across these three types of municipalities in their overall financial conditions as well as in their short term, long term and service level solvencies. The index measure explains the financial and <b>operational</b> strengths and <b>weaknesses</b> of municipalities, a clear understanding of which is necessary for improving their performance on sustainable basis. The result of this research is likely to have implications for devising policies for making municipalities more effective organizations. While, the findings will help municipal management to focus their operations to improve their financial and service performance, policy makers at the central level will find it as a useful tool in devising policies for equitable distribution of resources among municipal organizations...|$|R
