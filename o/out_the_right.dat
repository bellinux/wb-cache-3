Though, the truck builders and off-road fans use it to find <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> wheel diameter, that will fit right into the wheel wells. For the US vehicles, the wheel wells capacity is measured in inches, so when the outer tire diameter is calculated, it is normally compared with the wheel well index. This is done {{in order to prevent}} tire from rubbing against control arms and fenders.|$|E

In season 3 the boys were required to choose one girl to be safe and the girls were required to save a boy, the boys saved Lindi and the girls chose Reece because they were the most attractive in their opinions. In season 5, Darci and Aric were selected to sit out. They were then each allowed to save one other person (of the same gender). Darci chose Kelsey, Aric chose Alex.|$|E
25|$|Charles K. Kao and George A. Hockham of the British company Standard Telephones and Cables (STC) {{were the}} first, in 1965, {{to promote the}} idea that the {{attenuation}} in optical fibers could be reduced below 20 decibels per kilometer (dB/km), making fibers a practical communication medium. They proposed that the attenuation in fibers available at the time was caused by impurities that could be removed, rather than by fundamental physical effects such as scattering. They correctly and systematically theorized the light-loss properties for optical fiber, and pointed <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> material to use for such fibers— silica glass with high purity. This discovery earned Kao the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.|$|E

25|$|Instead, {{they spent}} {{about two years}} on {{developing}} {{out the rest of}} the characters, gameplay balance, and graphics. Characters were generally added to the game for one of three reasons: to introduce a new gameplay mechanic or balance gameplay, to incorporate a new character design created by their artistic team, or to help support Overwatchs narrative. In addition to character balance, the development team needed to find ways to balance the characters with the various maps, wanting to provide areas across the maps for each character to have an area where they could be effective. The number of characters in the game was not fixed; though released with 21 different heroes, Kaplan stated the team played around with various goals, potentially as high as 40 unique heroes and across six different classes. Kaplan knew they had to have more than nine heroes as to separate themselves from Team Fortress 2, which featured nine distinct classes. Kaplan credits Jeff Goodman, a veteran designer in Blizzard, for figuring <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> number of heroes, classes, and balance between the characters. Keller noted that as the cast starting approaching about 15 characters, the team started to worry that there were too many for players to learn and may dilute the experience, but they strived to assure both uniqueness and balance across the slate of Heroes. The team felt the game was ready for release in November 2015 after adding the last two characters, Mei and D.Va, to the roster.|$|E
25|$|Included in that haul {{was one of}} {{the most}} famous caughts-and-bowled ever taken. Ulyett sent down a {{straight}} half-volley to Bonnor, who drove at it with all his considerable might and got it right out of the middle of the bat. The ball flew back towards the bowler with a resounding crack. It seemed to Ulyett barely to have left his hand—yet already it was flying back to him at what seemed like the speed of light. He had no time to judge it but held <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> hand instinctively, and the leather stuck, right in the middle of his palm. With the sound of Bonnor's stroke still echoing about the ground, many eyes in the gallery were looking for the area near the boundary where they thought that the ball would land. The eyes of George Giffen, the non-striker, were among the wanderers, and he was certain that everyone else must be looking for it, too: indeed, a segment of the crowd, in panic, had even opened up a space in the ring in anticipation of the ball’s descent. Giffen reckoned it to have been a very mighty drive indeed—but he could not see where it had gone. When, finally, his and other eyes were diverted back towards the pitch, they noticed Ulyett celebrating and Bonnor was departing. It soon dawned on them that Ulyett had taken the catch. Although Ulyett felt no pain in the centre of his hand, there was definitely a fair amount of it on the outside. Bonnor looked at him disgustedly, thinking it almost immoral to have done such a thing, and he walked off gloomily. The England players gathered around Ulyett in wonderment. They seemed to the Wisden correspondent to be curious as to what kind of man this was—although they were also keen to congratulate him on his evasion of impending danger. The looks on the faces of Allan Steel and Alfred Lyttelton would stay with Wisdens man for a long time. WG Grace and Lord Harris both told Ulyett that he was foolish to have attempted to take the catch: had it hit his wrist or arm instead, that bone would surely have snapped. Giffen believed that this {{was one of the}} finest catches that he had ever seen, and, although on the team which it had adversely affected, he definitely appreciated it.|$|E
500|$|The {{voice for}} Satan, {{provided}} by Parker, {{was inspired by}} the voice of the Pinhead character at the ending of the 1988 horror film, , when Pinhead emotionally recalls his old life, when he was a good person. The animators went through several sketch drafts for Satan because, in Parker's words, [...] "There's so many ways to go with him and we couldn't figure <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> one for a long time". The large and muscular look of the character stemmed {{from the fact that the}} script called for Satan to massively outweigh Jesus, and that look has persisted for the character throughout the rest of the series.|$|E

500|$|The tenth and {{eleventh}} filming {{days were}} spent shooting {{the scenes of}} McGarrett and Danny assaulting Hesse's freighter. The fight scene between McGarrett and Hesse were shot with the portraying actors. Stunt doubles were on hand, but the production staff found they were not needed in the fight scenes until both characters fell into a boat below or the sea. The first [...] "Book 'em, Danno" [...] line was filmed several times as the staff wanted to pick <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> version. Some of the last scenes to be shot were the cold open scenes. Three days were spent on those scenes, and were filmed at Kualoa Ranch. In one scene of the episode, McGarrett goes to the garage of his father's house and unravels a Mercury Marquis. The car was in fact used on the original show and was on loan to the production staff by its owner, who was the stand-in for Jack Lord, who played the original McGarrett.|$|E
500|$|Stukov {{is later}} mysteriously revived by a Zerg cerebrate {{to make use}} of him for its own deeds. He is first observed, {{apparently}} infested, by pirates raiding a secret science facility in the bonus mission [...] "Deception", a facility that Stukov subsequently destroys. Stukov later appears in another bonus map, [...] "Mercenaries II", in which he hires several mercenary groups to destroy some of his adversaries. In the StarCraft 64 secret mission [...] "Resurrection", Artanis sends a task force headed by Raynor to inject Stukov with an experimental serum; the serum reverses the infestation effects and leaves Stukov healthy, albeit embittered. However, the Protoss cure would prove only temporary, and once Stukov was turned over to the Moebious Foundation for research purposes, the scientists re-infested him in an attempt to replicate the cure, without success. Creative director Andy Chambers regards the resurrection as an experiment by the Zerg, while Metzen notes that Stukov's resurrection had [...] "really interesting hooks". Blizzard's former producer Bill Roper hoped that Stukov's storyline will be developed further, noting that the character would only be reintroduced if Blizzard can [...] "figure <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> way to do it".|$|E
500|$|However, the Minister for Law {{said the}} Government {{was of the}} opinion that as the right to vote is an implied right in the Constitution, it was {{unnecessary}} for the Constitution to be amended to expressly mention the right. Articles 65 and 66 of the Constitution would be entrenched once Article 5(2A) is brought into force. That Article, which has remained in abeyance since it was introduced in 1991, provides that a bill that seeks to amend, among other things, Article 65 or 66, must be supported at a national referendum by not less than two-thirds of the votes cast, unless the President consents to the amendment. Shanmugam went on to state that the concerns of the 1966 Constitutional Commission were now moot, as Singapore had since experienced ten general elections with a 95% voter turnout each time. Therefore, it could be assumed that the idea and experience of voting were deeply ingrained in Singaporean voters. Furthermore, some countries choose to draft their constitutions in great detail while others, like Singapore, set out a basic philosophy. He noted that countries such as North Korea and Myanmar were among those that had set <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to vote within their constitutions. Shanmugam concluded that what was fundamental to protecting the right to vote was a Government committed to the rule of law.|$|E
