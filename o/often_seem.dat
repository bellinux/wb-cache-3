5|$|As {{genres of}} popular literature, science fiction and fantasy <b>often</b> <b>seem</b> more {{constrained}} than non-genre literature by their conventions of characterisation {{and the effects}} that these conventions have on depictions of sexuality and gender. Science fiction in particular has traditionally been a puritanical genre oriented toward a male readership. Sex is often linked to disgust in SF and horror, and plots based on sexual relationships have mainly been avoided in genre fantasy narratives. On the other hand, science fiction and fantasy can also provide more freedom than realistic literature to imagine alternatives to the default assumptions of heterosexuality and masculinity that permeate many cultures. Homosexuality is now an accepted and common feature of science fiction and fantasy literature, its prevalence due {{to the influence of}} lesbian-feminist and gay liberation movements.|$|E
25|$|Group pursuers {{hunt with}} a {{collection}} of conspecifics. Group pursuit is usually seen in species of relatively high sociality; in vertebrates, individuals <b>often</b> <b>seem</b> to have defined roles in pursuit.|$|E
25|$|Open {{portions}} <b>often</b> <b>seem</b> {{to reflect}} {{the beginning of a}} new topic or a major subdivision within a biblical book, while closed portions seem to reflect smaller units or minor subdivisions.|$|E
5000|$|He {{was a man}} [...] "of deep humility, yet so polemical that he <b>often</b> <b>seemed</b> biased".|$|R

5000|$|Adding {{capital inflow}} {{controls}} to prudential measures <b>often</b> <b>seems</b> {{to have little}} additional effect on credit growth.|$|R
25|$|Mana is {{a second}} year student from class 2-C and Leo's classmate. She comes from Kansai. Her school grades are bad. Her friends <b>often</b> <b>seem</b> to have {{difficulty}} with her because she cannot read the atmosphere of a place.|$|E
25|$|The {{details of}} these sacred events differ greatly from one text {{to another and}} <b>often</b> <b>seem</b> contradictory. Egyptian myths are {{primarily}} metaphorical, translating the essence and behavior of deities into terms that humans can understand. Each variant of a myth represents a different symbolic perspective, enriching the Egyptians' understanding of the gods and the world.|$|E
25|$|To {{people from}} outside the region the {{differences}} between Mak'em and Geordie accents <b>often</b> <b>seem</b> marginal, {{but there are many}} notable differences. There is even a small but noticeable difference in pronunciation between the accents of North and South Sunderland (for example, the word something in North Sunderland is often contracted to summik whereas a South Sunderland speaker may often prefer summat).|$|E

25|$|Quantum {{mechanics}} cannot {{easily be}} reconciled with everyday language and observation. Its interpretation has <b>often</b> <b>seemed</b> counter-intuitive to physicists, including its inventors.|$|R
25|$|Whiteread's casts <b>often</b> <b>seem</b> to emphasise {{the fact}} that the objects they {{represent}} are not themselves there, and critics have often regarded her work to be redolent of death and absence. Given this, it is perhaps not surprising that she was asked by Austrian authorities to create a work in remembrance of Austrian Jews killed during the Holocaust. Due to political sensitivities and bureaucracy the process, from commission to unveiling, took five years.|$|E
25|$|Australian actress Simone McAullay {{was cast}} as local hotelkeeper Becca Fisher, with whom Mark Latimer has an adulterous affair. Chibnall had long envisioned Becca as an Australian, {{which made her}} an {{outsider}} in the Broadchurch community. He also relied on the common assumption that Australians <b>often</b> <b>seem</b> bolder than most British, which gave the character license to say things others might not. McAullay received the first two scripts from her agent, and a short written sketch of the Dorset setting. She videotaped an audition {{at her home in}} Sydney, and sent it to Chibnall.|$|E
25|$|Pindar's poetic {{style is}} very distinctive, {{even when the}} peculiarities of the genre are set aside. The odes {{typically}} feature a grand and arresting opening, often with an architectural metaphor or a resounding invocation to a place or goddess. He makes rich use of decorative language and florid compound adjectives. Sentences are compressed {{to the point of}} obscurity, unusual words and periphrases give the language an esoteric quality, and transitions in meaning <b>often</b> <b>seem</b> erratic, the images seem to burst outit is a style that sometimes baffles but also makes his poetry vivid and unforgettable.|$|E
6000|$|... "Unfortunately, mine <b>often</b> <b>seems</b> {{to suffer}} from sterility. It has been {{subjected}} to stimulating influences here, and I'll miss them on the other side." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, but I don't! It <b>often</b> <b>seems</b> like a {{very hard}} and dismal place, and I croak over my trials like an ungrateful raven." ...|$|R
5000|$|Captain of the Cygnus. He <b>often</b> <b>seems</b> {{unreliable}} and doesn't {{stand out}} much, but he gives precise orders based on sharp judgment when it counts.|$|R
25|$|The {{most common}} method applied in pseudoscientific {{language}} comparisons is to search {{two or more}} languages for words that seem similar in their sound and meaning. While similarities of this kind <b>often</b> <b>seem</b> convincing to laypersons, linguistic scientists consider this kind of comparison to be unreliable for two primary reasons. First, the method applied is not well-defined: the criterion of similarity is subjective and thus not subject to verification or falsification, which {{is contrary to the}} principles of the scientific method. Second, the large size of all languages' vocabulary and a relatively limited inventory of articulated sounds used by most languages makes it easy to find coincidentally similar words between languages.|$|E
25|$|Recruitment is {{the number}} of new young fish that enter a {{population}} in a given year. The size of fish populations can fluctuate by orders of magnitude over time, and five to 10-fold variations in abundance are usual. This variability applies across time spans ranging from a year to hundreds of years. Year to year fluctuations in the abundance of short lived forage fish can be nearly as great as the fluctuations that occur over decades or centuries. This suggests that fluctuations in reproductive and recruitment success are prime factors behind fluctuations in abundance. Annual fluctuations <b>often</b> <b>seem</b> random, and recruitment success often has a poor relationship to adult stock levels and fishing effort. This makes prediction difficult.|$|E
25|$|Some extant {{examples}} {{suggest that}} in antiquity Cupid and Psyche could have a religious or mystical meaning. Rings bearing their likeness, several of which come from Roman Britain, may have served an amuletic purpose. Engraved gems from Britain represent spiritual torment {{with the image of}} Cupid torching a butterfly. The two are also depicted in high relief in mass-produced Roman domestic plaster wares from 1st-2nd centuries AD found in excavations at Greco-Bactrian merchant settlements on the ancient Silk Road at Begram in Afghanistan (see gallery below). The allegorical pairing depicts perfection of human love in integrated embrace of body and soul ('psyche' Greek for butterfly symbol for transcendent immortal life after death). On sarcophagi, the couple <b>often</b> <b>seem</b> to represent an allegory of love overcoming death.|$|E

25|$|The {{equivalent}} to Nazi Germany, ruled by King Mezentio, who {{is analogous to}} Adolf Hitler. Algarve was defeated in the Six Years' War a generation ago, which was analogous to World War I, and forced to sign the humiliating Treaty of Tartus. Mezentio and his generals have spent much time and energy in preparing for a revenge on all their foes - especially the Kaunians. Located {{in the center of}} the continent, Algarve's people are characterized as red-headed and green-eyed, given to flamboyancy in word and gesture, and its males exhibit manifest macho behavior. Their typical dress includes kilts. To their enemies, Algarvians <b>often</b> <b>seem</b> arrogant and overbearing, and their conduct amply earns them the hatred of those who had the misfortune to live under their rule. While capable of great cruelty, Algarvians can also be quite generous on occasion; they doff their hats (sometimes literally) to an enemy whose conduct earned their grudging respect; and the same cultural traits which make them seem insufferably arrogant in victory also enable them to face adversity - even the certainty of imminent death - with admirable courage and fortitude. Algarvian names are drawn from Italian.|$|E
500|$|The faeders are {{sometimes}} mounted by independent or satellite males, but are as often [...] "on top" [...] in homosexual mountings as the ruffed males, suggesting that their true identity is {{known by the}} other males. Females never mount males. Females <b>often</b> <b>seem</b> to prefer mating with faeders to copulation with normal males, and normal males also copulate with faeders (and vice versa) relatively more often than with females. The homosexual copulations may attract females to the lek, like the presence of satellite males.|$|E
500|$|In the 1984 Broadway {{production}} of The Three Musketeers at The Broadway Theatre, Taylor played Porthos, {{one of the}} three title characters. After fifteen preview performances, the show ran just nine times before closing. Frank Rich wrote that the musketeers were [...] "professionally played" [...] by Taylor and his co-stars Brent Spiner and Chuck Wagner but felt the three had [...] "little dialogue and <b>often</b> <b>seem</b> like interchangeable stand-ins for the Three Stooges." [...] A similar view was held by William B. Collins of the Philadelphia Inquirer who said they [...] "speak as in one voice and behave like comedians who have been stranded without good material." ...|$|E
5000|$|Harry's {{behavior}} is naive, endearing, and bizarre. Somehow, this mental condition gives him an inexplicable sex appeal {{for women and}} makes him the only Solomon with any talent in the arts - Harry <b>often</b> <b>seems</b> to have a knack for all fine arts, including music and theater. He is consistently shown as being a very talented painter, especially as a portraitist and caricaturist. He <b>often</b> <b>seems</b> like the [...] "wise fool" [...] of folk narratives - the one everyone calls stupid who ends up knowing what is really important.|$|R
60|$|A woman without magnanimity, without generosity, {{who has no}} love, {{and whom}} a man loves, is a terrible antagonist. To give up or to fight <b>often</b> <b>seems</b> equally impossible.|$|R

500|$|Ludo Rocher {{says that}} [...] "descriptions of [...] as siddhi-buddhi-samanvita 'accompanied by, {{followed}} by siddhi and buddhi.' <b>often</b> <b>seem</b> to mean {{no more than}} that, when [...] is present, siddhi 'success' and buddhi 'wisdom' are not far behind. [...] Such {{may well have been}} the original conception, of which the marriage was a later development." [...] In verse 49a of the Ganesha Purana version of the Ganesha Sahasranama, one of Ganesha's names is Ŗddhisiddhipravardhana ("Enhancer of material and spiritual success"). The Matsya Purana identifies [...] as the [...] "owner" [...] of Riddhi (prosperity) and Buddhi (wisdom). In discussing the northern Indian sources, Cohen remarks: ...|$|E
500|$|The {{change of}} focus from the PC {{platform}} to console systems has been criticized, {{due to the}} concessions required to adapt games to the altered interfaces and control systems, {{as well as a}} need to appeal to a wider demographic. Developer Josh Sawyer lamented the decline of high-profile computer-exclusive RPGs, and claimed that the collapse of Troika Games meant that there were [...] "no pure CRPG developers left", outside of small companies like Spiderweb Software. According to Matt Barton, [...] "successful CRPGs of modern times <b>often</b> <b>seem</b> more like action adventures or first-person shooters than anything ever released by Origin." [...] Other criticisms include the increasing emphasis on video quality and voiceovers, and their effect on development budgets and the amount and quality of dialogue offered.|$|E
500|$|Charles Rosen, who unraveled {{this unique}} {{borrowing}} of a Beethovenian structure in Schubert's A major Sonata, has {{also referred to}} Schubert's departure from the former's style in this instance: [...] "Schubert moves with great ease within the form which Beethoven created. He has, however, considerably loosened what held it together, and stretched its ligaments unmercifully... the correspondence of part to whole has been considerably altered by Schubert, and explains why his large movements <b>often</b> <b>seem</b> so long, since they are being produced with forms originally intended for shorter pieces. Some of the excitement naturally goes out of these forms when they are so extended, but this is even a condition of the unforced melodic flow of Schubert's music". Rosen adds, however, that [...] "with the finale of the A major Sonata Schubert produced a work that is unquestionably greater than its model".|$|E
5000|$|The Nobel Prize-winning {{economist}} Joseph E. Stiglitz, says: [...] "the {{reason that}} the invisible hand <b>often</b> <b>seems</b> invisible {{is that it is}} often not there." [...] Stiglitz explains his position: ...|$|R
