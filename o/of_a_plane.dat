40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{discusses}} {{the case study}} and comparison <b>of</b> productivity <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Conventional <b>Planer</b> with automated <b>planer,</b> there is <b>an</b> attempt to develop a electro-pneumatic circuit for <b>a</b> <b>planing</b> operation using <b>a</b> <b>planer,</b> which makes the operation semiautomatic producing <b>a</b> <b>plane</b> and flat surface. The movements <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>planer</b> namely, reciprocating motion of the table, the crosswise movement of the tool head across the cross-rail and the clamping of the component on the table are being automated using pneumatic components namely, pneumatic cylinders, pneumatic DCV‟S, FCV‟S and electrical and electronic devices. The electro-pneumatic circuit developed, simulated and executed is interfaced with PLC...|$|R

5|$|By solving Apollonius' problem {{repeatedly}} {{to find the}} inscribed circle, the interstices between mutually tangential circles can be filled arbitrarily finely, forming an Apollonian gasket, {{also known as a}} Leibniz packing or an Apollonian packing. This gasket is a fractal, being self-similar and having a dimension d that is not known exactly but is roughly 1.3, which is higher than that of a regular (or rectifiable) curve (d = 1) but less than that <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>plane</b> (d = 2). The Apollonian gasket was first described by Gottfried Leibniz in the 17th century, and is a curved precursor of the 20th-century Sierpiński triangle. The Apollonian gasket also has deep connections to other fields of mathematics; for example, it is the limit set of Kleinian groups.|$|E
5|$|For surfaces, the {{generalization}} from the geometry <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>plane</b> –a flat surface– {{to that of}} a general curved surface had been described in the early 19th century by Carl Friedrich Gauss. This description had in turn been generalized to higher-dimensional spaces in a mathematical formalism introduced by Bernhard Riemann in the 1850s. With the help of Riemannian geometry, Einstein formulated a geometric description of gravity in which Minkowski's spacetime is replaced by distorted, curved spacetime, just as curved surfaces are a generalization of ordinary plane surfaces. Embedding Diagrams are used to illustrate curved spacetime in educational contexts.|$|E
5|$|In a medium, light {{usually does}} not {{propagate}} {{at a speed}} equal to c; further, different types of light wave will travel at different speeds. The speed at which the individual crests and troughs <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>plane</b> wave (a wave filling the whole space, with only one frequency) propagate is called the phase velocityvp. An actual physical signal with a finite extent (a pulse of light) travels at a different speed. The largest part of the pulse travels at the group velocityvg, and its earliest part travels at the front velocityvf.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the changes}} made shortly after 9/11 was the colour scheme of the police cars; the {{original}} colour scheme of blue with white stripes specifically resembled that of the New York City Police Department. It was changed to black-and-white designs common among several police departments in the United States, such as Los Angeles and San Francisco. Other changes include altering the flight path <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>plane</b> to avoid appearing to fly into or behind a skyscraper, removing a mission referencing terrorists, {{as well as some}} changes to pedestrian dialogue and talk radio.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>plane</b> accident that killed Sloan and Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh), Torres {{is forced to}} make the decision to have Alex Karev amputate Robbins's left leg to keep her alive, which puts strains on their relationship. The hospital is sued and eventually found guilty of negligence. Each victim, including Robbins, Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), and Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) must receive $15 million of compensation, which leads the hospital to a near bankruptcy as the insurances refuse to pay. These doctors and Torres buy the hospital {{with the help of the}} Harper-Avery Foundation to prevent it from closing, and each become members of the new directing board. Everything seems to go well for Arizona and Callie, until a big storm hits the hospital now named after Mark Sloan and Lexie Grey. In the last episode of the ninth season, Arizona cheats on Callie with Dr. Lauren Boswell (Hilarie Burton). Callie soon discovers Arizona's infidelity by seeing her wedding ring pinned to Dr. Boswell's scrub top. In {{the aftermath}} of discovery, both Callie and Arizona share their feelings and it is revealed that Arizona does not forgive Callie for making the call to amputate her leg. Callie is heartbroken and Arizona states that Callie lost nothing in the crash, to which Callie responds that she, apparently, lost Arizona.|$|E
5|$|The video {{consists}} of multiple scenes with Carey and (now husband) Cannon, who plays her love interest. This is shown along with various behind-the-scenes footage of Carey at various promotional {{events in the}} United Kingdom. The video begins with grainy footage <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>plane</b> landing in the Bahamas, with Carey and Cannon exiting the aircraft with her dog. Throughout the video, scenes of Carey laying on a sofa, writing lyrics and tearing, {{as well as the}} singer in a darkened stage are shown. Several behind-the-scenes clips of Carey promoting the album in the United Kingdom are shown, as she arrives at a CD signing, and connects with fans. Following the signing, Carey is shown at a fashion show, as well as modelling in several outfits. Other scenes that intermingle are of Carey looking out of her hotel suite window in London, as well as candles being put out. During the second verse, the couple is seen spending time together on the island, spending time with friends at a small gathering at the pool, as well as moments of Carey modeling for her bikini photo shoot for the June issue of Vibe. The video's final segment is of Carey performing the song at a concert in a large theatre, while several photos are sporadically shown. Photographs of several of Carey's deceased friends and family members are shown, including her dog, Jack, her father Alfred Roy, her grandmother, David Cole, Luciano Pavarotti, Ol' Dirty Bastard, and Luther Vandross, all of whom Carey had collaborated with during her career. Critics complimented the inclusion of the photos with both Pavarotti and Vandross, and considered it Carey's way of honoring them. The music video peaked at #4 on Billboard's Hot Videoclip Tracks chart.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the archetypal}} {{toolpath}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>planer</b> is linear, helical cutting {{can be accomplished}} by coupling the table's linear motion to simultaneous rotation. The helical planing idea is similar to both helical milling and single-point screw cutting.|$|R
