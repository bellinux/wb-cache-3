5|$|According to Njal's Saga, Óspak was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> {{opposite}} King Sigtrygg Silkbeard. Óspak {{went through}} the entire battle on this wing, and was sorely wounded and lost both his sons before Sigtrygg fled. However, that Óspak engaged Sigtrygg contradicts the historical opinion that Sigtrygg did not actually {{take part in the}} battle but was instead holding the garrison in reserve in Dublin.|$|E
50|$|The Romans posted {{their troops}} in their {{traditional}} manner, with <b>the</b> cavalry <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> and <b>the</b> infantry in the center. The combined Roman and Iberian horse was placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right <b>wing,</b> with <b>the</b> allied Italian horse <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left <b>wing.</b> <b>The</b> infantry line had <b>the</b> Italian troops <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> next to <b>the</b> cavalry, and the Roman legions were posted in the center. The Roman camp was guarded by the Iberian infantry and 2,000 Roman/Italian troops.|$|R
50|$|The male has a black face, {{throat and}} upper breast. The female has a darker crown, grey cheek patches and small dark spots <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings,</b> and lacks <b>the</b> black {{markings}} of the male. The northern race griseopectus has black spots <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> and grey central underparts in both sexes.|$|R

5|$|Having {{the largest}} wing-area-to-body-weight ratio of any bird, {{frigatebirds}} are essentially aerial. This {{allows them to}} soar continuously and only rarely flap their wings. One great frigatebird, being tracked by satellite in the Indian Ocean, stayed aloft for two months. They can fly higher than 4,000 meters in freezing conditions. Like swifts {{they are able to}} spend the night <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wing,</b> but they will also return to an island to roost on trees or cliffs. Field observations in the Mozambique Channel found that great frigatebirds could remain <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> for up to 12 days while foraging. Highly adept, they use their forked tails for steering during flight and make strong deep wing-beats, though not suited to flying by sustained flapping. Frigatebirds bathe and clean themselves in flight by flying low and splashing at the water surface before preening and scratching afterwards. Conversely, frigatebirds do not swim and with their short legs cannot walk well or take off from the sea easily.|$|E
5|$|Henry left Monaco in January 1999, {{one year}} before his {{intimate}} and closest teammate David Trezeguet, and moved to Italian Serie A club Juventus for £10.5million. He played <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wing,</b> but he was ineffective against the Serie A defensive discipline in a position uncharacteristic for him, and scored just three goals in 16 appearances.|$|E
5|$|Juvenile {{birds of}} both sexes have less {{extensive}} blue on their faces, the coloration not extending past the eye. The upperparts resemble those of the adult female. Both sexes have the white wing-stripe, which disappears with maturity in males. The immature male has a red patch <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> and may also have an orange wash on the belly.|$|E

5|$|Manchester City {{returned}} to the First Division for the 1966–67 season, and Young remained a key player. Before Manchester City's game against Leeds United, Leeds manager Don Revie, known for his meticulous scouting of opposition teams, identified Young as a particular threat in a Grandstand interview. Operating mainly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wing,</b> Young scored less frequently {{than in the previous}} season, with 7 goals in 45 appearances.|$|E
5|$|One {{of the few}} {{groups that}} were never thought to be piscivores are the anurognathids; these were instead thought to be nocturnal, aerial insectivores, a view still {{maintained}} today. With highly flexible joints <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> finger, a broad, triangular wing shape, large eyes and short tail, these pterosaurs were analogous to some of today's insectivorous bats, being capable of high manoeuvrability at relatively low speeds.|$|E
5|$|Pratincoles have short legs, {{very long}} pointed wings and long forked tails. Their most unusual feature for birds classed as waders {{is that they}} {{typically}} hunt their insect prey <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> like swallows, although they can also feed on the ground. Their short bills are an adaptation to aerial feeding.|$|E

5|$|Six {{subspecies}} {{are currently}} recognised, characterised principally by differences {{in size and}} plumage. There is a steady change to the birds' morphology and size the further south they are encountered, with lighter and more greyish plumage, larger body size, and a shorter bill. Southerly populations also show more white plumage in the tail, with less whiteness <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wing.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Oxford English Dictionary derives {{the word}} straightforwardly from Old English butorflēoge, butter-fly; similar names in Old Dutch and Old High German {{show that the}} name is ancient.

5|$|The jacamars {{are near}} {{passerine}} birds from tropical South America {{with a range}} that extends up to Mexico.

5|$|The sunset moth {{is black}} with {{iridescent}} red, {{blue and green}} markings. There is a fringe of white scales <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> edges, wider on the hindwings.

Pattern variations are common, and the moth is often partly asymmetrical; {{one of the factors}} causing this is temperature shock during the pupal stage.|$|E
