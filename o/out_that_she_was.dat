John Winston Lennon {{was born}} on 9 October 1940, on the second-floor ward of the Oxford Street Maternity Hospital in Liverpool, supposedly during a German air raid in World War II, {{although it has been}} confirmed there was no air raid on this date. Alf first saw his son that November when he returned from working as a merchant seaman on troop transports during World War II.

He occasionally went back to Liverpool, but did not stay long before he was sent off on another ship. The cheques to Julia stopped when he went absent without leave in 1943. Neither Julia nor the Merchant Navy knew of his whereabouts.

500|$|The {{only member}} of the group born in Skagen, Anna Ancher (1859–1935), was the {{daughter}} of Erik Brøndum, the owner of the grocery shop and guest house which later became Brøndums Hotel.
