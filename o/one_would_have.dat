5|$|The opening was a placid Nimzo-Indian Defence, {{and after}} 17...Ba4 {{the game was}} even (Filip). After a series of piece exchanges the {{position}} in the diagram was reached after 29.b5. It {{appeared to be a}} dead-drawn ending, and no <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been remotely surprised if the players had agreed to a draw here.|$|E
5|$|In Hinduism, {{suicide is}} {{generally}} frowned upon {{and is considered}} equally sinful as murdering another in contemporary Hindu society. Hindu Scriptures state that one who dies by suicide will {{become part of the}} spirit world, wandering earth until the time <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> otherwise died, had one not taken one's own life. However, Hinduism accepts a man's right to end one's life through the non-violent practice of fasting to death, termed Prayopavesa. But Prayopavesa is strictly restricted to people who have no desire or ambition left, and no responsibilities remaining in this life. Jainism has a similar practice named Santhara. Sati, or self-immolation by widows, was prevalent in Hindu society during the Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} {{legislative}} session of Bradley's term, 75 bills were filed, including {{a ban on}} the manufacture and sale of cigarettes, a measure to make carrying a concealed weapon a felony, and a bill banning gambling at racetracks and church fairs. Competing measures affecting pool halls were introduced – <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> lifted most of the restrictions on their operation while another would have banned them altogether. Bradley added an anti-lynching law to the legislative agenda. However, none of these bills were acted on; {{the vast majority of the}} Assembly's attention during the session was focused on the election of a U.S. Senator.|$|E

60|$|There was {{a general}} laugh, but no <b>one</b> <b>would</b> accept the challenge--which Brixton had not heard--though he heard the laugh that followed.

5|$|It has {{not been}} said of any people on the earth that the moon was {{observed}} that night such {{that it could be}} stated that it was not split. Even if this had been reported from many different places, so that <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to exclude the possibility that all agreed upon a lie, yet, we would not accept this as proof to the contrary, for the moon is not seen in the same way by different people... An eclipse is visible in one country but not in the other one; in one place it is total, in the other one only partial.|$|E
5|$|There {{was also}} much {{speculation}} {{at the time}} in the Adelaide and Melbourne press on why the lifeboats had not been launched earlier. Survivor James Fitzgerald pointed out in his recollection that, had the lifeboats been filled to capacity, no <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> survived the severe weather conditions experienced. He also commented that passenger vessels were not required to carry enough lifeboats, concluding that there were insufficient places for all Gothenburgs passengers and crew. It was not until RMS Titanic sank some 37 years later in 1912, that it was made compulsory for all British registered ships to carry sufficient lifeboats for everyone on board.|$|E
5|$|A {{major reason}} for this is economy. A single wooden tablet {{presented}} a limited space for writing, so it was in the interest of scribes to transcribe information efficiently, while still maintaining legibility and aesthetic quality. The ‘grafting’ system described above achieves this in an elegant manner. Another reason may be secrecy. Assuming that literacy was restricted to elites and professional navigators, it was in their interest to prevent their notation from being read too easily. This may explain why a given star can be represented by multiple glyphs. It also helps explain the combination system outlined above -- while basic characters can be read without difficulty, <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to master the entire set of basic characters before recognizing the components of combined glyphs. In this way, the meaning would be opaque to anyone without proper training.|$|E

5|$|The design {{specifications}} were completed in February 1945, and contracts were let {{to build the}} components. Three different plants were used so that no <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{a copy of the}} complete design. The gun and breech were made by the Naval Gun Factory in Washington, D.C.; the target case and some other components were by the Naval Ordnance Plant in Center Line, Michigan; and the tail fairing and mounting brackets by the Expert Tool and Die Company in Detroit, Michigan. The bomb, except for the uranium payload, was ready at the beginning of May 1945. The uranium-235 projectile was completed on 15 June, and the target on 24 July. The target and bomb pre-assemblies (partly assembled bombs without the fissile components) left Hunters Point Naval Shipyard, California, on 16 July aboard the heavy cruiser , arriving on 26 July. The target inserts followed by air on 30 July.|$|E

25|$|Besides narrow {{meaning of}} karma as the {{reaction}} or suffering being due to karma {{of their past}} lives and that <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to transmigrate to another body in their next life, it is often used in the broader sense as action or reaction.|$|E
25|$|The whole pattern can {{be shifted}} up by three courses, so {{that instead of}} a D-major scale <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> a G-major scale, and so on.

25|$|A {{refinement}} of this method, known as importance sampling in statistics, involves sampling the points randomly, but more frequently where the integrand is large. To do this precisely <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to {{already know the}} integral, but one can approximate the integral by an integral of a similar function or use adaptive routines such as stratified sampling, recursive stratified sampling, adaptive umbrella sampling or the VEGAS algorithm.|$|E
25|$|The most absurd {{part of this}} absurd fraud (at least, to English eyes) is one which, oddly enough, has {{received}} comparatively little comment.

25|$|Bar-Yosef et al. (1992) {{suggested}} that the cranium was deliberately removed sometime after the ligaments that attached it to the spine had decomposed.

25|$|In {{an attempt}} to abolish blood feud (that was quite common at that time), “RP” narrowed its “usage” and limited the number of avengers to the closest {{relatives}} of the dead. If there were no avengers on the victim’s side, the killer had to pay a fine (called “vyra”) in favour of the knyaz’ and partial compensation to the relatives of the victim (the killer’s community had to help him pay his fine). If a woman were killed, <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to pay half of the regular fine (called “poluvir’ye”, half of “vyra”).|$|E

Certainly, the additions of Hans-Peter Briegel in midfield and of Danish striker Preben Elkjær to an attack that already featured the wing play of Pietro Fanna, the creative abilities of Antonio Di Gennaro and the scoring touch of Giuseppe Galderisi were to prove crucial.|$|E
