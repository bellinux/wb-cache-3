5|$|For her thirteenth {{birthday}} on 12 June 1942, Frank {{received a}} book she had shown {{her father in}} a shop window a few days earlier. Although it was an autograph book, bound with red-and-white checkered cloth and with a small lock on the front, Frank decided she would {{use it as a}} diary, and she began writing in it almost immediately. In her entry dated 20 June 1942, she lists many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>restrictions</b> placed upon the lives of the Dutch Jewish population.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} {{legislative}} session of Bradley's term, 75 bills were filed, including {{a ban on}} the manufacture and sale of cigarettes, a measure to make carrying a concealed weapon a felony, and a bill banning gambling at racetracks and church fairs. Competing measures affecting pool halls were introduced – one would have lifted most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>restrictions</b> on their operation while another would have banned them altogether. Bradley added an anti-lynching law to the legislative agenda. However, none of these bills were acted on; {{the vast majority of the}} Assembly's attention during the session was focused on the election of a U.S. Senator.|$|E
5|$|After {{a winter}} filled with Indian attacks, {{including}} one which claimed {{the life of}} Shelby's younger brother Evan Shelby III, Kentucky militia units won some minor victories over the Indians in early 1794. In spring the response to Wayne's call for troops was more enthusiastic; 1,600 volunteers mustered at Fort Greenville and were hastily trained. By August, 1794, Wayne was on the offensive against the Indians and dealt them a decisive blow at the August 20, 1794 Battle of Fallen Timbers. This victory, and the ensuing Treaty of Greenville, secured the territory, and although Shelby {{did not agree with}} some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>restrictions</b> placed upon western settlers by this treaty, he abided by its terms and enforced those that were under his jurisdiction.|$|E

5|$|Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>restrictions</b> {{that the}} Defence Act (1903) placed upon {{deploying}} {{units of the}} Citizens Force overseas, following the outbreak of World War I, the Australian government decided to raise an all volunteer force for overseas service. This force {{was known as the}} Australian Imperial Force (AIF). Initially, the AIF was to consist of only one infantry division, but following the despatch of the 1st Division in late 1914 further units were raised and these were eventually organised to form the 2nd Division. As part of the 2nd Division, the 27th Battalion was formed on 16 March 1915 at Ascot Park Camp, Adelaide, from recruits drawn mainly from South Australia, who had originally been allocated to the 24th Battalion. After a period of basic training, the battalion embarked for the Middle East on the troopship HMAT A2 Geelong on 31 May 1915, arriving there on 6 July.|$|E
5|$|Britain's hold on Gibraltar was {{reconfirmed}} in 1729 by the Treaty of Seville, which satisfied neither side; the Spanish {{had wanted}} Gibraltar returned, while the British disliked the continuation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>restrictions</b> {{imposed by the}} Treaty of Utrecht. Spain responded the following year by constructing a line of fortifications across {{the upper end of}} the peninsula, cutting off Gibraltar from its hinterland. The fortifications, known to the British as the Spanish Lines, and to Spain as La Línea de Contravalación (the Lines of Contravallation), were later to give their name to the modern town of La Línea de la Concepción. Gibraltar was effectively blockaded by land but was able to rely on trade with Morocco for food and other supplies.|$|E
5|$|The {{contrasting}} {{geography of}} Northern England is reflected its literature. On the one hand, the wild moors and lakes have inspired generations of Romantic authors: {{the poetry of}} William Wordsworth and the novels of the Brontë sisters {{are perhaps the most}} famous examples of writing inspired by these elemental forces. Classics of children's literature such as The Railway Children (1906), The Secret Garden (1911) and Swallows and Amazons (1930) portray these largely untouched landscapes as worlds of adventure and transformation where their protagonists can break free <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>restrictions</b> of society. Modern poets such as the former Poet Laureate Ted Hughes and Oxford Professor of Poetry Simon Armitage have found inspiration in the Northern countryside, producing works that take advantage of the sounds and rhythms of Northern English dialects.|$|E

5|$|The life of {{the college}} was {{disrupted}} by the English Civil War. Leoline Jenkins, who became principal after the war in 1661, put the college on a more stable financial footing. Little happened at the college during the 18th century, and the 19th century saw a decline in numbers and academic standards. Reforms of Oxford University after two Royal Commissions {{in the latter half}} of the 19th century led to removal of many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>restrictions</b> placed on the college's fellowships and scholarships, such that the college ceased to be predominantly full of Welsh students and academics. Students' academic achievements rose in the early 20th century as fellows were appointed to teach in new subjects. Women were first admitted in 1974 and now form a large part of the undergraduate population.|$|E
5|$|Unlike many English, Flood and Grattan {{were also}} proponents of Catholic emancipation, and under their {{leadership}} the Irish Parliament overturned a number <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>restrictions</b> {{on the rights}} of Catholics, although they continued to be unable to vote or hold elected offices. When the French Revolution broke out in the early 1790s, Catholics and middle-class Protestants united to form the Society of United Irishmen. They successfully extracted additional rights, although there was some Protestant resistance to the idea of full Catholic suffrage due to their overwhelming numerical majority. The more radical elements favouring Irish independence found a leader in Theobald Wolfe Tone, who went to France for support from the revolutionaries there that led to an aborted attempt to invade Ireland in 1796. The failed invasion led the government of the Earl of Camden to round up leaders of the United Irishmen and attempt to disarm the Catholic populace. Use of these tactics was made possible in part by the passage of an Insurrection Act, giving the administration broad police powers, and also by the suspension of habeas corpus in October 1796.|$|E
5|$|First {{reported}} in 2003, {{the idea of}} using a form of the Atkins diet to treat epilepsy came about after parents and patients discovered that the induction phase of the Atkins diet controlled seizures. The ketogenic diet team at Johns Hopkins Hospital modified the Atkins diet by removing the aim of achieving weight loss, extending the induction phase indefinitely, and specifically encouraging fat consumption. Compared with the ketogenic diet, the modified Atkins diet (MAD) places no limit on calories or protein, and the lower overall ketogenic ratio (approximately 1:1) {{does not need to be}} consistently maintained by all meals of the day. The MAD does not begin with a fast or with a stay in hospital and requires less dietitian support than the ketogenic diet. Carbohydrates are initially limited to 10g per day in children or 20g per day in adults, and are increased to 20–30g per day after a month or so, depending on the effect on seizure control or tolerance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>restrictions.</b> Like the ketogenic diet, the MAD requires vitamin and mineral supplements and children are carefully and periodically monitored at outpatient clinics.|$|E
