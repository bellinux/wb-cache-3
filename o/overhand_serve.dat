25|$|Serving is the act {{of putting}} the ball into play by {{striking}} it with the hand or arm from behind the rear court boundary. Serving can {{take the form of}} an underhand serve, <b>overhand</b> <b>serve</b> or a jump serve. The underhand and overhand serves are similar on the beach and indoors, with the exception that on the beach the wind often has a significant effect on the trajectory of the ball. Although the serve can be used as an offensive weapon, most rallies are won by the receiving team, as they have the first attack opportunity.|$|E

50|$|A spongy ball {{measuring}} 2.5 in {{in diameter}} is used. The ball can be <b>served</b> <b>overhand.</b> The ball is struck with a paddle that extends 18 in and {{which may have}} up to 87 holes measuring no more than 3/8 in in diameter to improve its aerodynamics.|$|R
5000|$|Jump serve: an <b>overhand</b> <b>serve</b> {{where the}} ball is first tossed high in the air, then the player makes a timed {{approach}} and jumps {{to make contact with}} the ball, hitting it with much pace and topspin. This is the most popular serve amongst college and professional teams.|$|E
5000|$|Topspin: an <b>overhand</b> <b>serve</b> {{where the}} player tosses the ball high and hits {{it with a}} wrist snap, giving it topspin which causes it to drop faster than it would {{otherwise}} and helps maintain a straight flight path. Topspin serves are generally hit hard and aimed at a specific returner {{or part of the}} court. Standing topspin serves are rarely used above the high school level of play.|$|E
5000|$|Jump float: an <b>overhand</b> <b>serve</b> {{where the}} ball is tossed high enough that the player may jump before hitting it {{similarly}} to a standing float serve. The ball is tossed lower than a topspin jump serve, but contact is still made while in the air. This serve is becoming more popular amongst college and professional players {{because it has a}} certain unpredictability in its flight pattern. It is the only serve where the server's feet can go over the inline.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to survey the {{relationship}} between decrease in range of motion and learning of a new sport skill in people who had experience of weight training. This research was conducted using pre-test, three acquisition test, retention test and transfer test, with two experimental (n= 18 weightlifters) and controlgroups (n= 20 non-weightlifters). Data was collected by universal gonimeter and American Alliance for Health Physical Education, Recreation and Dance (AHHPERD) <b>overhand</b> volleyball <b>serve.</b> All of participants had the same schedule program with 120 trials (40 trials in 3 sessions).

40|$|Previous {{research}} highlighted {{that early}} visual information has {{a key role}} in ball sports, as its correct interpretation fosters accurate predictions concerning the ball motion [1, 2]. Other studies revealed that auditory information can provide important cues in various sport situations [3, 4]. The present study combines these two lines of research with the aim to investigate the role of early auditory and visual information in anticipating volleyball serves. To this purpose, several <b>overhand</b> <b>serves</b> were audio- and video-recorded {{from the perspective of a}} defence player. The recordings were edited to create two kinds of stimuli – auditory and visual –lasting 1250 ms (1000 ms before the hand-ball impact and 250 ms after it). 36 participants were recruited for the experiment: 22 were novices to volleyball, while 14 were amateur volleyball players. Their task was to predict the landing zone of the serves – i. e. near the net, in the middle of the court, or near its end – relying either on the auditory information (Audio condition) or on the visual information (Video condition). A within subjects design was used, with the two conditions carried out in a counterbalanced order among participants. As concerns response accuracy, an independent samples t-test revealed no significant difference between the two groups of participants. As a consequence, the comparison between the two experimental conditions was conducted without making a distinction between novices and experts; in this regard, a one sample t-test highlighted that participants were significantly more accurate in the Audio condition than in the Video condition. As concerns response times, no significant difference was observed neither between groups, nor between conditions. These outcomes suggest that the early auditory information associated with volleyball serves would provide more salient cues than the respective visual information for predicting the landing zone of the serves themselves. Future studies should further investigate in this direction, considering also other sport situations, to better understand the contribution of auditory and visual information in anticipating the ball motion; future developments in this field would be useful from both a research perspective and an applied one.

The serviceman is not allowed to <b>serve</b> <b>overhand</b> though, and spiking is not allowed on a third touch. Traditional Volleyball teams play in local, state, provincial, regional, national, and even international tournaments every year. From Dar es Salaam and Nairobi to Karachi and especially the U.K., the game is growing at rapid rates. In fact, more youth are now playing traditional volleyball than ever before. The hope is that someday this version of volleyball can be played at the Asian Games or even the Olympics.|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} how certain mental training techniques affected skill acquisition {{and performance of}} a sports skill (<b>overhand</b> volleyball <b>serve).</b> The uniqueness {{of the study was}} the particular population - twelve recreational athletes (versus elite athletes) with mean age of 43. 8. The subjects were divided into two groups with measures taken on three different occasions - pre-test, mid-test and post-test. Group 1 received the Mental Training Program (MT) and engaged in physical practice {{during the first half of}} the experiment, while Group 2 engaged in physical practice only. Group 2 then added the M. T. Program while Group 1 continued to practice physically. The M. T. Program focussed on relaxation, mental modelling of elite olympic volleyball players, and imagery. At the pre-test, subjects were given an Imagery Ability Questionnaire to assess whether they were high or low imagers. Five different tasks were performed to obtain both qualitative and quantitative data for analysis. Quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrated both statistical and practical significance for an increase in knowledge, in addition to a performance increase in the skill. This was a positive beginning to new and exciting research involving recreational rather than elite athletes, and the impact mental training techniques have on this population (mean age = 43. 8). Results are discussed with relevance to the effect on research that these findings have in terms of adults learning a new sport skill, improving performance of that newly acquired skill and the positive impact that mental training techniques have on them...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the impact of giving {{students}} specific assessment criteria in the first part of a badminton unit on the response rates of students with various skill levels. This study also investigated whether setting and stating specific assessment criteria in the beginning of an activity unit increased student achievement and learning throughout the course of instruction. Participants of this study consisted of a purposeful sample of 12 female physical education students from an Indiana high school participating in a badminton unit. Data was collected during a 10 -day badminton unit on two more-skilled, two average-skilled, and two less-skilled students in each of two classes. One of these classes received specific assessment criteria in the first part of the badminton unit, while the other class received the specific assessment criteria at the end of the same badminton unit. The participants' response rates for each forehand, backhand, <b>overhand,</b> and <b>serve</b> badminton hit attempted were coded as correct successful, incorrect successful, correct unsuccessful, or incorrect unsuccessful. Participant data was graphed, including a 3 -day baseline, and compared between the control group and experimental group. Research findings revealed that participants in the experimental group, who received specific assessment criteria in the first part of the badminton unit, had a higher quality of response rates throughout the unit than participants of similar skill level in the control group, who did not receive the specific assessment criteria unit the end of the same unit. The results of this study suggest that student response rates increase throughout a unit when specific assessment criteria is given at the beginning of the unit for students of more-, average-, and less-skill levels. This study concludes that physical educators may increase student achievement and learning throughout an instructional unit by setting and stating specific assessment criteria at the beginning of an instructional unit. Increased student response rates mean greater time spent on task and improved skill development. School of Physical EducationThesis (M. S. ...|$|R
5000|$|Chapman's {{ability to}} force his opponents to play {{every inch of}} the court starts with his {{precision}} defense, which in turn starts with his extraordinary return of serve. Serving and returning serve usually determines who wins a handball game. Having the serve is a big advantage: only the server can score, he has the ball in his hand in the frontcourt with his opponent behind him in the backcourt, and he can pick his shot. The contemporary power player typically serves low drives along the walls trying for an ace or a weak return. However, drive serves are risky because if they are not precise they can rebound off the backwall toward center court and offer an offensive opportunity. Like any player, Chapman welcomes offensive opportunities, but his real advantage is his ability to defend all but the very best drive serves by punching them to the ceiling, and thereby completely neutralizing the server's advantage and forcing his opponent into the ceiling game he excels at. To compliment his extraordinary return game, when Chapman is serving he typically chooses low risk serves, usually either a lob <b>serve</b> or an <b>overhand</b> three-wall drive <b>serve,</b> both of which tend to force his opponents into a ceiling game (at best), and that's what Chapman wants because his precision ceiling game usually results in an offensive opportunity for him long before he gives one to his opponent.|$|R
