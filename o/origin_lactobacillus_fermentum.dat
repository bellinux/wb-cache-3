The identity of culture {{was based on the}} characteristics of Lactobacilli as presented in the Bergey’s Manual of Determinative Bacteriology using Gram Staining, Motility, Triple Sugar Iron and Fermentation of different carbon sources. Based on the criteria <b>Lactobacillus</b> <b>fermentum</b> tolerated on Inhibitory substances, Temperature and agitation were identified and tested for probiotic use for chickens. <b>Lactobacillus</b> <b>fermentum</b> shows antimicrobial activity and shows the similar effects to antibiotic in the feed. It could be a suitable strain as a probiotic feed for chickens...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{was carried out}} to study the effect of lactic acid bacteria (<b>Lactobacillus</b> <b>fermentum,</b> <b>Lactobacillus</b> brevis and Lactobacillus amylovorus) starter on traditional fermentation of sorghum flour (variety dabar). Results obtained indicated that fermentation time was reduced from 19 - 6 h albeit the final pH was reduced to 3. 47. The addition of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to the previous starter further reduced sorghum fermentation time to only 4 h and the final pH was 3. 75...|$|R
40|$|Lactic acid {{bacteria}} (LAB) {{have the}} potential to degrade intestinal oxalate and this is increasingly being studied as a promising probiotic solution to manage kidney stone disease. In this study, oxalate degrading LAB were isolated from human faeces and south Indian fermented foods, subsequently assessed for potential probiotic property in vitro and in vivo. Based on preliminary characteristics, 251 out of 673 bacterial isolates were identified as LAB. A total of 17 strains were found to degrade oxalate significantly between 40. 38 % and 62. 90 % and were subjected to acid and bile tolerance test. Among them, nine strains exhibited considerable tolerance up to pH 3. 0 and at 0. 3 % bile. These were identified as <b>Lactobacillus</b> <b>fermentum</b> and <b>Lactobacillus</b> salivarius using 16 S rDNA sequencing. Three strains, <b>Lactobacillus</b> <b>fermentum</b> TY 5, <b>Lactobacillus</b> <b>fermentum</b> AB 1, and Lactobacillus salivarius AB 11, exhibited good adhesion to HT- 29 cells and strong antimicrobial activity. They also conferred resistance to kanamycin, rifampicin, and ampicillin, but were sensitive to chloramphenicol and erythromycin. The faecal recovery rate of these strains was observed as 15. 16 % (TY 5), 6. 71 % (AB 1), and 9. 3 % (AB 11) which indicates the colonization ability. In conclusion, three efficient oxalate degrading LAB were identified and their safety assessments suggest that they may serve as good probiotic candidates for preventing hyperoxaluria...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to examine the temperature tolerance of bacterial cells and their viability after storage in the food matrix. Though probiotics are sensitive to temperature, encapsulation was used to protect the cells from various stress tolerance like temperature. For the present study <b>Lactobacillus</b> <b>fermentum</b> NCIM 2156 and Lactobacillus plantarum NCIM 2083 were selected. The bacterial cells were exposed at different temperature for different time intervals in water or oil bath, then their survivability was checked by spread plate method using MRS agar. The CFU/ml was calculated for <b>Lactobacillus</b> <b>fermentum</b> NCIM 2156 and Lactobacillus plantarum NCIM 2083 after incubation for 48 hrs at 37 °C. It was observed that <b>Lactobacillus</b> <b>fermentum</b> NCIM 2156 and Lactobacillus plantarum NCIM 2083 could tolerate up to 90 °C for 1 min and 100 °C for 30 sec, respectively as free cells. Lactobacillus plantarum NCIM 2083 was encapsulated using alginate (3 %) and the tolerance of encapsulated cells was studied. It was found that encapsulation could enhance the temperature tolerance of Lactobacillus plantarum NCIM 2083 up to 130 °C for 2 min. Lactobacillus plantarum NCIM 2083 as free cells was incorporated in the orange peel jelly and their viability was checked. Synbiotic microcapsules were stored in health mix (Horlicks) for two weeks and the viability of cells in food matrix was checked after 2 weeks...|$|R
