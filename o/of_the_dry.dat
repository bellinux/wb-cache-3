5|$|As {{a result}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dry</b> climate, timber—a main {{component}} in building earthquake-resistant homes—is scarce in Qayen; homes are instead constructed of adobe. The {{inhabitants of the}} poverty-stricken region rely on subsistence farming, raising livestock and crops such as wheat and saffron. When the earthquake struck, much {{of the population was}} already working in the fields; for the most part, these people survived. Many of those treated for injuries were found to be undernourished.|$|E
5|$|Carbohydrates make up {{the bulk}} of the fruit bodies, {{comprising}} 9.23% of the fresh weight (see table), and 65.4% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dry</b> weight. The carbohydrate component contains the monosaccharides glucose, mannitol and α,α-trehalose, the polysaccharide glycogen, and the water-insoluble structural polysaccharide chitin, which accounts for up to 80–90% of dry matter in mushroom cell walls. Chitin, hemicellulose, and pectin-like carbohydrates—all indigestible by humans—contribute to the nutritionally desirable high proportion of insoluble fibre in B.edulis.|$|E
40|$|A {{numerical}} {{study is}} carried out to investigate <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> multistage <b>drying</b> regimes on <b>the</b> <b>drying</b> kinematics <b>of</b> a porous material. In particular <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> varying <b>the</b> conditions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drying</b> medium are studied. <b>The</b> <b>drying</b> model for <b>the</b> solid is developed based on the continuum approach. A series <b>of</b> simulations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drying</b> behaviour <b>of</b> a rectangular brick with varying temperature, heat transfer coefficient and relative humidity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drying</b> medium are undertaken. It is found that <b>the</b> total <b>drying</b> time is mainly dependent on <b>the</b> relative humidity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drying</b> medium. Also condensation is predicted on <b>the</b> surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brick, with <b>the</b> quantity <b>of</b> condensation being directly linked to the relative humidity and temperature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drying</b> medium. Overall it is concluded that multistage drying regimes are useful in reducing <b>the</b> overall <b>drying</b> time whilst avoiding detrimental shrinkage during <b>the</b> constant <b>drying</b> period...|$|R

5|$|Both {{species are}} omnivorous, eating fruit, flowers, buds, insect excretions, tree gums, large insects, spiders, frogs, chameleons, snakes, small birds, and eggs. Coquerel's giant mouse lemur {{is thought to}} opportunistically prey on mouse lemurs after an {{individual}} was found with a half-eaten gray mouse lemur (M.murinus) in a trap. During June and July, at the peak <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dry</b> season, this species relies on sugary excretions from the larvae of hemipteran and cochineal insects as well as tree gums. The sugary excretions are obtained by either licking them {{from the back of}} the insect or collecting the crystallized sugars that accumulate beneath the insect colony. During this time of year, feeding on insect secretions can account for 60% of feeding activity. In contrast, the northern giant mouse lemur relies on cashew fruits during the dry season.|$|E
5|$|Certain genera of gram-positive bacteria, such as Bacillus, Clostridium, Sporohalobacter, Anaerobacter, and Heliobacterium, {{can form}} highly resistant, dormant {{structures}} called endospores.

Endospores have a central core of cytoplasm containing DNA and ribosomes surrounded by a cortex layer and protected by an impermeable and rigid coat.

Two ribs and a belly-rib showed signs of breaking and healing. One adult specimen had a left lower jaw showing a puncture wound and both healed and unhealed bite marks.

5|$|In {{comparison}} to the well-preserved rocks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dry,</b> {{central part of the}} Andes, the record that defines the southern sector is poorly preserved. Remnants of Miocene and Quaternary eruptions within the central part are clearly preserved in the rock record. Ash flow sheets constitute as much as 40percent of the area's total erupted material, suggesting that pyroclastic eruptions were rather important during this time. By examining the eruption rate of individual volcanoes, Hildreth et al. concluded that similar amounts of ash-flow volcanism took place in the southern sector as well. Their study established that in particular silicic ash was missing from the record, and concluded that erosion had probably disrupted deposition of volcaniclastic rock.|$|E
5|$|Mantises are preyed on by {{vertebrates}} such as frogs, lizards, and birds, and by invertebrates such as spiders and ants. Generally, mantises {{protect themselves}} by camouflage, most species being cryptically colored to resemble foliage or other backgrounds, both to avoid predators and to better snare their prey. Those that live on uniformly colored surfaces such as bare earth or tree bark are dorsoventrally flattened {{so as to}} eliminate shadows that might reveal their presence. The species from different families called flower mantises are aggressive mimics: they resemble flowers convincingly enough to attract prey that come to collect pollen and nectar. Some species in Africa and Australia are able to turn black after a molt towards the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dry</b> season; {{at this time of}} year, bush fires occur and this coloration enables them to blend in with the fire-ravaged landscape (fire melanism).|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Faced with <b>the</b> {{importance}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drying</b> in <b>the</b> post-harvest phase <b>of</b> {{coffee and}} its influence in <b>the</b> final quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> product, the current study had <b>the</b> aim <b>of</b> evaluating <b>the</b> kinetics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drying</b> in different temperatures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drying</b> air for a low temperature at dew point of fruits of arabic coffee (Coffea arabica) <b>dry</b> processed. <b>The</b> cherries were manually picked and submitted to hydraulic separation.
