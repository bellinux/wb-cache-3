60|$|But {{most potent}} in his {{education}} was <b>the</b> cuff <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>master's</b> hand, <b>the</b> censure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>master's</b> voice.

They had hurt only <b>the</b> flesh <b>of</b> him; beneath <b>the</b> flesh the spirit had still raged, splendid and invincible. But with <b>the</b> <b>master</b> <b>the</b> cuff was always too light to hurt the flesh. Yet it went deeper.

5|$|Arson {{investigators}} testified as to {{how they}} had located the origin and cause of the house fire, stressing that the multiple unconnected, small fires they had found in the home's basement were evidence of the fire having been set purposely and that char patterns on the house's floors were evidence of a liquid accelerant having been used to start the fire. The living room floor had contained the most significant amount of accelerant, and the trail of accelerant had ended at the door <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>master</b> bedroom, which had been open while the fire burned. The state of the bedroom door contradicted Green's prior testimony to investigators that her bedroom door had been closed and she had only opened it briefly to look into the hallway.|$|E

5|$|Several of {{the large}} runestones in Scandinavia notify of an inheritance, such as the Hillersjö stone, which {{explains}} how a lady came to inherit the property of not only her children but also her grandchildren and the Högby Runestone, which tells that a girl was the sole heir {{after the death of}} all her uncles. They are important proprietary documents from a time when legal decisions were not yet put to paper. One interpretation of the Tune Runestone from Østfold suggests that the long runic inscription deals with the funeral ale in honor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>master</b> of a household and that it declares three daughters to be the rightful heirs. It is dated to the 5th century and is, consequently, the oldest legal document from Scandinavia that addresses a female's right to inheritance.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after the}} Master Apartments' opening, the {{building}} and the institute both experienced monetary deficits, with the building going into foreclosure in 1932. Two years later, Horch had his tax-exempt corporation, Master Institute of United Arts, Inc., become the building's landlord, with receivership ending the next year in 1935. Soon after, the Horch and Roerich families dissolved their partnership due to disagreements, and the Roeriches unsuccessfully sued Horch to regain control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> Apartments.
