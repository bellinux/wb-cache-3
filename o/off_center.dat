On chromatic marimbas, the accidentals (black keys) can also be played on {{the space between the}} front edge of the bar and its node (the place where the string goes through the bar) if necessary. Playing on the node produces a sonically weak tone, and the technique is only used when the player or composer is looking for a muted sound from the instrument.|$|E

25|$|The Civilian Conservation Corps {{built the}} guard station {{residence}} in 1938. It is rectangular one-story, wood-frame structures with gabled roof. The structure rests of a concrete foundation. There is an interior stone chimney <b>off</b> <b>center</b> {{from the roof}} ridge. The exterior walls are horizontal clapboard with vertical board and batten covering the gable ends. Windows are either a nine or twelve pane light sash type. The main front window {{is a group of}} three twelve pane windows set below a front gabled bay. A garage with hinged two-leaf doors is built into one end of the structure.|$|E
25|$|The state {{legislature}} added SR-48 {{to the state}} highway system in 1927, connecting Bingham with SR-1 (US-91, now US-89) at Midvale Junction. In order to serve the planned I-15 interchange at 7200 South, SR-48 was moved in 1965 to turn north <b>off</b> <b>Center</b> Street onto Holden and Main Streets in Midvale and then east on 7200 South to US-89. As the city of Bingham de-annexed land, a short extension was made at the west end to the new city limits in 1968, but this and more was abandoned in 1973 to allow the Kennecott Copper Corporation to relocate its guard station. An overlap with SR-68 in West Jordan was added in 2000, rerouting SR-48 to turn north at SR-68 and then east on 7000 South to the former alignment at Main Street in Midvale.|$|E
25|$|Many {{collectors}} long {{thought the}} blue plane portion was printed first, {{thus it was}} actually the red frames that were inverted. However, research by noted philatelic authors Henry Goodkind and George Amick shows this to be incorrect; in fact, the frames were printed first {{and it is the}} planes that are upside down. In examples where the plane is so far <b>off</b> <b>center</b> that it overlaps the frames, {{it can be seen that}} the blue ink used to print the plane lies atop the red ink used to print the frames. The Smithsonian's National Postal Museum offers two explanations for how this might have occurred: either a sheet of printed frames was placed in the press upside down for the printing of the plane; or the printing plate used to print the planes was mounted inverted within the printing press.|$|E

25|$|Using the {{printing}} technique employed with the Bureau triangle issues of 1894, the paper used to print the Washington-Franklin issues was first dampened so that printing ink would be absorbed more thoroughly and evenly. However, {{this resulted in}} paper shrinkage when the sheets of stamps dried, causing the rows of stamps to be drawn closer together. As the flat printing plates for this issue had individual stamp impressions spaced 2mm apart the resulting dried sheet would leave stamps spaced about 1½ mm apart, making {{it very difficult to}} line up rows of perforations accurately between the rows of stamps. Many sheets were issued with perforations somewhat <b>off</b> <b>center,</b> while roughly 20% of the sheets emerged with perforations so off-center that they were deemed unsalable and had to be destroyed. Paper shrinkage would lead the Bureau to try various approaches to the problem in the following issues. Finding well-centered stamps with wide margins in any denomination in this early issue is a challenge for the collector and well centered examples command prices that far exceed average catalog values.|$|E
500|$|The black hennin is long, {{truncated}} {{and relatively}} plain [...] with a transparent veil which falls {{around the back}} of her neck, resting briefly on her shoulder. Probably it was kept relatively unadorned so as not to distract from the [...] necklace. Her costume is mostly black or brown, with a wide but high neckline and white fur lined hems on the sleeves. Portinari has dark eyes, a strong nose, full lips and a pointed chin. Her visible hand, folded in prayer but unrealistically <b>off</b> <b>center,</b> wears what looks like a jeweled ring. The dark sleeves of her dress contain red or rouge velvet-like cloth tightened by a white belt. Her hair is shaved back to achieve the high forehead and sculptural look fashionable at the time.|$|E
500|$|The statue was {{examined}} {{in great detail}} by French and American engineers {{as part of the}} planning for its centennial in 1986. In 1982, it was announced that the statue was in need of considerable restoration. Careful study had revealed that the right arm had been improperly attached to the main structure. It was swaying more and more when strong winds blew and there was a significant risk of structural failure. In addition, the head had been installed [...] <b>off</b> <b>center,</b> and one of the rays was wearing a hole in the right arm when the statue moved in the wind. The armature structure was badly corroded, and about two percent of the exterior plates needed to be replaced. Although problems with the armature had been recognized as early as 1936, when cast iron replacements for some of the bars had been installed, much of the corrosion had been hidden by layers of paint applied over the years.|$|E

Its single entrance is <b>off</b> <b>centered</b> on the southern side, and has two small windows. Next to this wooden shed is a small corrugated metal shed. Its walls and roof are of corrugated metal, with the roof being shed-style sloping towards the ditch.|$|R

500|$|To {{simulate}} {{the police officer}} falling in the opening scene, the special effects department had the stunt double fall 52feet onto an 18x24feet airbag, which they referred to as [...] "old-fashioned" [...] because they used the airbag rather than wires. Trevor Jones, the stuntman doing the scene, commented during shooting that his fall had a small margin of error, {{because of the small}} airbag and cement walls surrounding the area, [...] "if you land <b>off</b> <b>center</b> maybe three or four feet, then you're going to get pitched in that direction". To aid Jones, a large X was placed on the airbag. A scene later in the episode involves a car fleeing through a garage door, only to hit a concrete wall, flip over, and burst into flames. To create the scene, the crew used two externally identical cars; one was drivable, and the other was a shell of car, and was hooked to a cable rig. After taking a week to get everything set up, the crew used a nitrogen cannon to launch the second, undrivable car through the garage door via wires.|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} of the series, Martin called them as the [...] "most {{entertaining}} characters" [...] of the series and [...] "one of anime's liveliest and most entertaining couples". He described their constant glee as infectious and their [...] "bizarre logic" [...] as priceless. He felt that their presence [...] "elevates the series from merely {{a very good one}} to a truly exceptional one." [...] He believes that they always [...] "make the most of their screen time", noting how every one of their actions [...] "give an entirely new twist to the events otherwise playing out normally." [...] Carl Kimlinger, also from ANN, adds that [...] "the things those two can do to a well-laid plan are simply appalling." [...] Davey Jones of Active Anime felt the pair was the [...] "highlight of the story" [...] and should have their own series. Chris Beveridge from Mania Entertainment described the two as [...] "very <b>off</b> <b>center</b> in a colorful and fun way" [...] and believed they stood out from the large cast because they were [...] "far more outgoing." [...] He felt that the connections they make {{with the rest of the}} cast [...] "are fun to watch and there's only a kind of elegance to it". Beveridge commented that [...] "when this pair comes on the screen, [...] can’t help but smile" [...] and that he [...] "enjoy all of the scenes that involve [...] because they bring such a lighthearted aspect to the show that’s definitely needed to break up the more intense scenes." [...] DVD Talk's Todd Douglass felt that Isaac and Miria are [...] "the uplifting and energetic component of [...] show," [...] feeling that it is entertaining to see how they influenced the events. Nick Hartel, also from DVD Talk, believed that it would be cruel not to mention them. He described them to be filled with [...] "a maniac energy, often brought to a screeching halt by melodramatic breakdowns over trivial occurrences or bold assumptions." [...] Although he admit they seem to have to place in the series at first, he notes that their interactions with other characters [...] "causes a drastic shift in tone." [...] He comments that as the plot progresses, the pair [...] "become a bright spot as storylines take dark turns and serve as a reminder of the goodness that makes up the vast majority of the world." [...] Daryl Surat of the Anime World Order Podcast and quest Mike Toole believed that out of every other character in the ensemble cast, the pair are the [...] "default protagonists" [...] simply because they meet every other character. They also felt that if ignorance is bliss, they are the happiest people [...] "in the world" [...] because they are [...] "that stupid". The two characters were compared to Bonnie and Clyde, but the reviewers felt that were more like Blue Falcon and Dynomutt, characters from the animated series Dynomutt, Dog Wonder. Even if the events become grim, the reviewers could not help but smile as Isaac and Miria appear. ANN columnist Erin Finnegan described Isaac and Miria as [...] " [...] a couple of completely loveable weirdoes". She agreed that the subplot revolving around them [...] "takes some of the edge off the dark moments." [...] Amanda Tarbet of SequentialTart.com drew parallels between the duo and the trickster god archetype. She compared them to the kitsune of Japanese folklore, which are portrayed [...] "as tricksters, but also as nurturing characters such as guardians and friends". She felt that Isaac and Miria [...] "represent this duality perfectly." [...] Tarbet also described them as part Bonnie and Clyde and part Rodgers and Hammerstein.|$|E

[...] In this configuration, the tanker retains its articulated boom, but has a hose/drogue {{at the end of}} it instead of the usual nozzle. [...] The tanker boom operator holds the boom in a static position, while the receiver aircraft then flies the probe into the basket. [...] Unlike the soft canvas basket used in most drogue systems, the adapter units use a steel basket, grimly known as the “iron maiden” by naval aviators because of its unforgiving nature. [...] Soft drogues can be contacted slightly <b>off</b> <b>center,</b> wherein the probe is guided into the hose receptacle by the canvas drogue. [...] The metal drogue, when contacted even slightly <b>off</b> <b>center,</b> will pivot out of place, potentially “slapping” the aircraft’s fuselage and causing damage.|$|E
