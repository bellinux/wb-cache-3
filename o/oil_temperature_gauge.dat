2500|$|In 1981, {{there was}} only one {{powerplant}} available, a [...] engine that, like the L-48 base engine the previous year, produced the , but was now designated the L81. The motor was certified in all states and available with manual or automatic transmissions. Chrome air cleaner lids and cast magnesium valve covers dressed up all engines. The stainless steel exhaust manifolds and computer control system introduced on the [...] California engines the previous year were now standard, as was an auxiliary electric engine cooling fan. This, the last C3 available with a manual transmission, so equipped, had a published 0-60mph in 8.1seconds. This model year was the first corvette to use a fiberglass rear leaf spring, now a Corvette trademark. The spring saved thirty-six pounds, but was limited to base suspensions with automatic transmission. When equipped with Delco's brand new optional ETR (Electronically Tuned Receiver) radio with a digital clock, the quartz analog instrument panel clock was replaced with an <b>oil</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>gauge.</b> The cast aluminum wheels, optional since ’76, were now ordered on 90 percent of the cars at a cost of $428. New options included a power adjustable driver’s seat and power remote outside mirrors.

5000|$|In 2008, Roock {{announced}} its newest limited edition, tuner Porsches, the RST 600 LM and RST 650. The 600 LM {{was designed to}} commemorate Roock Racing's win at the 1996 24 Hours of Le Mans. [...] The RST 600 LM and RST 650 included upgraded turbochargers, titanium exhaust systems, and an upgraded ECU good for over 600 horsepower and at least 611 lb-ft torque. Performance numbers were a claimed 3.1 second sprint to 60 mph and a top end of 211 mph. Roock also added a carbon fiber clutch, expertly tuned suspension, and massive 380mm drilled and vented brakes. Inside, the RST's Roock RST got carbon fiber trim, <b>oil</b> and <b>temperature</b> <b>gauges,</b> and custom seats with four point harnesses. Finally, subtle exterior modifications were added including a new front splitter, rear diffuser, rear spoiler, and lightweight aluminum racing wheels.|$|R

50|$|The {{interior}} of the 320is was identical {{to that of other}} 3 Series models, except an M3 instrument cluster (which features an <b>oil</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>gauge</b> instead of a fuel economy gauge) was used. The 320is was sold for three years, with 1206 sedans and 2542 coupes being produced.|$|E
50|$|All 914 LE cars {{featured}} {{a specially designed}} front spoiler and negative side stripes. Additionally, all Limited Editions were equipped with front and rear anti sway bars, dual horns, leather covered steering wheel, driving lights, painted rear roll bar trim (as opposed to vinyl clad), and a center console with an <b>oil</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>gauge,</b> clock, and voltmeter.|$|E
5|$|Standard gear {{includes}} climate control, Blaupunkt sound, cruise control, full trip computer, rear park assist, {{traction control}} system, Electronic Stability Control, power mirrors and windows.

The carpets remain dark as in the Holden Calais V-Series. The Senator Signature also offers a number of options such as a roof mounted DVD player, front park assist, rain sensing wipers and door entry lamps. Satellite navigation will become available as an option in the near future.|$|R
50|$|For 1991 and onwards, the M30 {{received}} only minor improvements. If the exterior driver's side door {{handle of the}} coupe was pulled while the doors were locked, the keyhole would illuminate and the interior dome light would come on. There was also an available central locking switch placed next to the Sonar Suspension II adjuster, {{although it is not}} known whether this was a standard feature or option for 1991-1992 models. Main gauge cluster text was changed to match the rest of the Infiniti lineup, and engine <b>oil</b> <b>temperature</b> and fuel <b>gauges</b> were switched around. The speedometer was also changed to an electric-type, as opposed to the cable-type used on the 1990 model.|$|R
25|$|The 1965 Chevrolet Chevy II and Nova were {{updated with}} cleaner {{front-end}} styling {{courtesy of a}} fresh full-width grille with new integrated headlight bezels. Parking lights moved down to the deep-section bumper, and sedans gained a new roofline. Taillight and backup lights were restyled, as was the rear cove. The 1965 Chevy II came in entry-level 100 form or as the posher Nova 400, each in three body styles. The Nova Super Sport came as a Sport Coupe only, and its production dipped to just 9,100 cars. Super Sports had a new brushed-chrome console with floor-mounted four-speed manual transmission or Powerglide automatic, but a column-mounted three-speed manual remained standard. Bucket seats wore textured vinyl trim, and the dashboard held ammeter, <b>oil</b> pressure, and <b>temperature</b> <b>gauges.</b>|$|R

50|$|Outside, {{the car was}} {{identical}} to the 308 GTB/GTS, save for metric sized wheels of a slightly different design, fitted with Michelin TRX radial tyres—Michelin XWX on 16-inch wheels were optional. Inside, the clock and <b>oil</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>gauge</b> were moved to the centre console; there were also a new black steering wheel with three perforated spokes, and seats of a different pattern.|$|E
50|$|The {{strictly}} four-seater interior had Recaro sports {{seats with}} strong side bolsters for {{front and rear}} passengers. 3 extra dials - an <b>oil</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>gauge,</b> stopwatch and voltmeter - {{were included in the}} centre console. The 190 E 2.3-16 was available in only two colours, Blue-Black metallic (Pearl Black in the US), and Smoke Silver. The 2.5-16 added Almandine Red and Astral Silver.|$|E
50|$|Inside {{the cabin}} the padded vinyl {{dashboard}} was characterised by a concave horizontal fascia, finished in grey anti-glare crackle-effect paint. Four round instruments were inset in the fascia {{in front of}} the driver. The larger diameter inner pair were tachometer and speedometer; the outer ones were smaller combination instruments, the left hand one holding oil pressure and fuel level gauges, the right hand one <b>oil</b> and water <b>temperature</b> <b>gauges.</b> The steering wheel was non-dished, with three aluminium spokes, a thin bakelite rim and a centre horn button. Vinyl-covered seats with cloth centres and a fully carpeted floor were standard, while leather upholstery was an extra-cost option.After initially marketing it as a four-seater, Alfa Romeo soon changed its definition of the car to a more realistic 2+2.|$|R
50|$|A {{new version}} of the Giulietta Berlina debuted at the Frankfurt Motor Show in 1959. Mechanical changes were limited to {{shifting}} the fuel pump from the cylinder head to a lower position below the distributor, and moving the previously exposed fuel filler cap from the tail to the right rear wing, under a flap. The bodywork showed a revised front end, with more rounded wings, recessed head lights, and new grilles with chrome frames and two horizontal bars. The rear also showed changes, with new larger tail lights on vestigial fins, which replaced the earlier rounded rear wings. The interior was much more organized and upholstered in new cloth material; the redesigned dashboard included a strip speedometer flanked by two round bezels, that on the T.I. housed a tachometer and <b>oil</b> and water <b>temperature</b> <b>gauges.</b> The T.I. also received a front side repeater mounted in a small spear, unlike the Normale which kept the earlier small round lamp with no decorations. During 1959 the type designation for all models was changed from 750 and 753 to 101.|$|R
5000|$|The car debuted at a meet in Bakersfield, California on March 4, 1966. Driven by Joe Schubeck, the Hurst Hairy Olds {{began as}} a fully trimmed and later {{upholstered}} Oldsmobile 442 in body in white (BIW) form. Hurst installed {{not one but two}} 425 in³ (7 L) Oldsmobile engines and Toronado transaxles both front and rear; a pair of drag parachutes were mounted in the stock taillight positions and four-wheel disc brakes were fitted as well. Two engines meant two of virtually everything in the cockpit related to the operation of the car, including two cable-operated shifters, two tachometers, two sets of <b>oil</b> pressure and <b>temperature</b> <b>gauges</b> and even two accelerator pedals. Additional power was provided via a Cragar Equipment-modified 6-71 GMC supercharger atop each engine, each burning a blend of nitromethane and alcohol. Weight was reduced through the use of aluminum body components and Plexiglas windows. The result was a 2400-horsepower, four-wheel-drive exhibition drag racer which smoked its front and rear tires {{down the length of the}} race track with times in the eleven-second range.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} had {{a different}} look to the standard Z3, including makeing the sport package M-version steering wheel standard on the M and including different instrumentation such as an <b>oil</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>gauge.</b> Finally, the car was available in M-specific colors which were not released for the regular Z3, {{at least in the}} early production years (not counting BMW's Individual program).|$|E
50|$|In 1994 a five speed 600 SuperSport and a five speed 600 Monster appeared. It was the {{original}} specification motor and gearbox, with all the improvements of contemporary models added. The 750 SuperSport was updated with twin 320 mm front discs, and a steel swing arm. The 900 SuperSport and SuperLight received uprated Showa forks, and in 1995, an <b>oil</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>gauge</b> {{was added to the}} instruments.|$|E

40|$|The {{market for}} heavy duty engines is {{constantly}} requiring engines {{that should be}} more and more powerful, while still maintaining low fuel consumption. As a result of increasing engine power, the engine and coolant temperature increases as well due to insufficient cooling performance (because of design issues, cost etc.). Also, emission legislations, both current and future, require more and more measures to be taken by engine manufacturers. One way of meeting the legislations is the use of cooled EGR (Exhaust Gas Recirculation), which also lead to increased coolant temperatures. Both these factors also naturally lead to increased engine oil temperatures, the consequences of which are not thoroughly investigated. This thesis project aims to investigate effects of high temperatures on engine oil degradation, with focus on the greatest degradation process: oxidation. To do this several engine runs have been performed on a 310 hp engine with EGR to see what happens to the engine oil in a real engine when exposed to high temperatures. During the tests oil samples have been taken and analysed for important parameters. As a complement to these engine tests some laboratory oxidation testing have also been performed, to be able to compare engine test data with laboratory tests. One goal of the project was to try to formulate an empirical oxidation model, which would be able to predict oil oxidation levels in an engine, given any running parameters. This model was {{to be based on the}} results of the engine tests and oil analysis. This goal was not achieved though, as it showed that the engine tests were too short to show any good tendencies in oil oxidation. It was therefore decided that further and longer engine tests were to be made, but these did not fit into the timeframe of this project. However, an embryo of an oxidation model has been presented, and suggestions for further development have been made. Another goal was to clarify where and to what extent the engine oil is exposed to high temperatures in an engine, and to discuss what can be done to improve the situation. Whether or not a dedicated <b>oil</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>gauge</b> in production engines is needed, and where that would be mounted, is discussed. This has been done based on the results of the engine and laboratory testing. One interesting finding is that increasing the flow to the piston cooling system does not seem to improve anything for the oil; instead the oil consumption as well as oil oxidation seems to be able to increase. Another conclusion is that using a sump <b>oil</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>gauge</b> as a standard part of the new engine generation might be a good idea, since it has been shown that high engine oil temperatures in the sump have great negative effects on engine oil oxidation, and that the oil temperature in the sump is behaving quite irregularly in relation to other oil temperatures. To support the work in this project a thorough literature survey was undertaken including various SAE and other technical papers, books and Scania reports. Based on these facts the procedures behind engine oil oxidation on a chemical level have been investigated, among other things. For confidentiality reasons this report has been edited in such a way that absolute values of measured parameters have been removed. Where possible, these values have been replaced by percentages of normal values. Marknaden för tunga motorer kräver ständigt motorer som är starkare och starkare, men som ändå behåller en låg bränsleförbrukning. Ett resultat av att göra motorer starkare är att motoroch kylvattentemperaturer ökar, på grund av otillräcklig kylning (på grund av konstruktionsmässiga skäl, kostnader och dylikt). Dessutom kräver nuvarande och framtida emmissionslagstiftning att fler och fler åtgärder vidtas av motortillverkare världen över. Ett sätt att tillmötesgå lagkraven är användandet av kyld EGR (Exhaust Gas Recirculation), vilket också leder till ökade kylvattentemperaturer. Båda dessa faktorer leder också till ökade motoroljetemperaturer, med följder som ej är grundligt utredda. Detta examensarbete syftar till att utreda följderna av höga temperaturer på motoroljedegradering, med inriktning mot den grövsta degraderingsprocessen: oxidation. För att göra detta har ett antal motortest utförts på en 310 hk motor med EGR för att se vad som händer med motoroljan när den utsätts för höga temperaturer. Under dessa tester har oljeprover tagits för analys av viktiga oxidationsparametrar. Som ett komplement till dessa motorprover har även oxidationstester utförts i oljelaboratorium, för att kunna jämföra motortestdata med laboratorietestdata. Ett mål med detta projekt har varit att försöka formulera en empirisk oxidationsmodell, som skulle kunna förutsäga oljeoxidationsnivåer i en motor, givet godtyckliga driftsparametrar. Denna modell skulle baseras på resultaten från motor- och labbtesterna. Detta mål uppnåddes inte dock, då det visade sig att motorproverna var för korta för att visa några tydliga tendenser i oljeoxidation. Det beslutades därför att ytterliggare och längre motorprov skulle köras, men dessa rymdes tyvärr inte inom tidsramen för detta examensarbete. Ett embryo till en oxidationsmodell har ändå föreslagits, och förslag för vidareutveckling av denna har presenterats. Ett annat mål med projektet var att klargöra var och i vilken utsträckning motoroljan utsätts för höga temperaturer i en motor, samt att diskutera vad som kan göras för att förbättra situationen. Huruvida en dedikerad temperaturgivare för motoroljetemperatur går att motivera i produktionsmotorer, och vart denna i så fall skulle sitta, diskuteras. Detta har gjorts med grund i resultaten från motor- och labbproverna. En intressant slutsats är att ökat flöde til...|$|E

25|$|At Lindbergh's request, {{the large}} main and forward fuel tanks {{were placed in}} the forward section of the fuselage, in front of the pilot, with the oil tank acting as a firewall. This {{arrangement}} improved the center of gravity and reduced the risk of the pilot being crushed to death between the main tank and the engine {{in the event of a}} crash. This design decision meant that there could be no front windshield, and that forward visibility would be limited to the side windows. This did not concern Lindbergh as he was used to flying in the rear cockpit of mail planes with mail bags in the front. When he wanted to see forward, he would slightly yaw the aircraft and look out the side. To provide some forward vision as a precaution against hitting ship masts, trees, or structures while flying at low altitude, a Ryan employee who had served in the submarine service installed a periscope which Lindbergh helped design. It is unclear whether the periscope was used during the flight. The instrument panel housed fuel pressure, <b>oil</b> pressure and <b>temperature</b> <b>gauges,</b> a clock, altimeter, tachometer, airspeed indicator, bank and turn indicator, and a liquid magnetic compass. The main compass was mounted behind Lindbergh in the cockpit, and he read it using the mirror from a women's makeup case which was mounted to the ceiling using chewing gum. Lindbergh also installed a newly developed Earth Inductor Compass made by the Pioneer Instrument Company which allowed him to more accurately navigate while taking account of the magnetic declination of the earth.
