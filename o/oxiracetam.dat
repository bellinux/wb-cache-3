50|$|<b>Oxiracetam</b> acts {{also as a}} {{positive}} allosteric modulator of the AMPA receptors. The major metabolites of <b>Oxiracetam</b> include: beta-hydroxy-2-pyrrolidone, N-aminoacetyl-GABOB, GABOB (beta-hydroxy-GABA) and glycine. Thus its metabolic route is exactly parallel to that of piracetam, aniracetam, phenylpiracetam, and all {{other members of the}} -racetam family, and also pyroglutamic acid.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Oxiracetam</b> (ISF 2522) is a {{nootropic}} drug of the racetam {{family and}} very mild stimulant. [...] Several {{studies suggest that}} the substance is safe even when high doses are consumed {{for a long period of}} time. [...] However, the mechanism of action of the racetam drug family is still a matter of research. <b>Oxiracetam</b> is not approved by Food and Drug Administration for any medical use in the United States.|$|E
50|$|<b>Oxiracetam</b> is well absorbed {{from the}} {{gastrointestinal}} tract with a bioavailability of 56-82%.Peak serum levels are reached within {{one to three}} hours after a single 800 mg or 2000 mg oral dose, with the maximal serum concentration reaching between 19-31 µg/ml at these doses.Oxiracetam is mainly cleared renally and approximately 84% is excreted unchanged in the urine.The half-life of <b>oxiracetam</b> in healthy individuals is about 8 hours, whereas it is 10-68 hours in patients with renal impairment.There is some penetration of the blood-brain barrier with brain concentrations reaching 5.3% {{of those in the}} blood (measured one hour after a single 2000 mg intravenous dose).Clearance rates range from 9 to 95 ml/min and steady-state concentrations when 800 mg is given twice daily range from 60 µM to 530 µM.The highest brain concentrations of <b>oxiracetam</b> are found in the septum pellucidum, followed by the hippocampus, the cerebral cortex and with the lowest concentrations in the striatum after a 200 mg/kg oral dose given to rats. <b>Oxiracetam</b> may be quantitated in plasma, serum or urine by liquid chromatography with one of several different detection techniques.|$|E
50|$|Racetams are a {{class of}} drugs that share a {{pyrrolidone}} nucleus. Some, such as piracetam, are considered nootropics. Some such as <b>oxiracetam</b> and phenylpiracetam are also stimulants. Others such as levetiracetam and seletracetam are anticonvulsants.|$|E
50|$|Research shows <b>oxiracetam</b> {{improves}} hippocampally-mediated learning {{performance by}} increasing membrane-bound protein kinase C (PKC). When compared to control mice, oxiracetam-treated DBA mice demonstrated {{a significant increase}} in spatial learning performance as determined by the Morris water navigation task. This increase in performance was correlated to an increase in membrane-bound PKC.|$|E
5000|$|There {{has been}} effort put into {{investigating}} the possible use of <b>oxiracetam</b> as a medication to attenuate {{the symptoms of}} dementia. [...] However, no convincing results were obtained from studies where patients suffering from Alzheimer's dementia or organic solvent abuse were given 800 mg of the drug orally twice daily.|$|E
50|$|Racetams, such as piracetam, <b>oxiracetam,</b> and aniracetam, are {{structurally}} similar compounds, {{which are}} often marketed as cognitive enhancers and sold over-the-counter. Racetams are {{often referred to as}} nootropics, but this property of the drug class is not well established. The racetams have poorly understood mechanisms of action; however, piracetam and aniracetam are known to act as positive allosteric modulators of AMPA receptors and appear to modulate cholinergic systems.|$|E
50|$|The proven {{effects of}} the drug are limited to {{beneficial}} effects that lead to higher scores in tests for logical performance, attention, concentration, memory and spatial orientation. These tests were performed on patients with mild to moderate dementia and ADHD, and the doses were 800-2400 mg orally twice a day for one to six months. Improvement has also been seen in patients with exogenic post-concussion syndrome, organic brain syndromes and other dementias. According to V. Gallai et al, <b>oxiracetam</b> {{is more effective than}} piracetam for this purpose.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{pharmacokinetics}} of <b>oxiracetam</b> and its degraded substance (4 -hydroxy- 2 -oxo- 1 -pyrrolidine acetic acid, HOPAA) after {{oral and}} intravenous administration in rats were studied using an established UPLC-MS/MS method. Three groups of rats after an overnight fasted received 10  g/kg (n =  6) <b>oxiracetam</b> suspensions orally, and 2  g/kg (n =  6) normal or degraded <b>oxiracetam</b> injections intravenously via a caudal tail vein, respectively. Before the pharmacokinetic experiment, a simple safety evaluation test {{was conducted on}} the degraded <b>oxiracetam</b> injections containing 16. 16 % HOPAA in mice. There was no mortality by a single intravenous dose of 2  g/kg of degraded <b>oxiracetam</b> injections within two weeks, demonstrating that HOPAA was non-toxic in mice. Following intravenous administration of the normal injections, the plasma concentration-time curves of <b>oxiracetam</b> and HOPAA both showed a rapid elimination phase. The values of t 1 / 2 were 3. 1  ±  1. 5  h for <b>oxiracetam</b> and 0. 8  ±  0. 2  h for HOPAA, and the mean residence times (MRT) were 1. 2  ±  0. 1  h and 0. 8  ±  0. 1  h, respectively. <b>Oxiracetam</b> and HOPAA after intravenous administration of the degraded <b>oxiracetam</b> injections presented elimination patterns similar to those observed in the normal injections. Oral pharmacokinetic results showed that the Tmax was less than 1. 5  h for the two analytes, and both had a longer t 1 / 2 and MRT than those of intravenous administration. Contents of HOPAA in three groups were calculated based on AUC 0 –t values of the two analytes. The quantitative change of HOPAA in vivo was also evaluated by comparing the plasma concentrations of HOPAA and <b>oxiracetam</b> at the same time for every group. Additionally, the values of absolute bioavailability of <b>oxiracetam</b> were about 8. 0 % and 7. 4 % calculated by the normal or degraded <b>oxiracetam</b> injections, which were far less than the value of 75 % reported in literature, indicating the necessity of further study...|$|E
40|$|The in vivo and {{in vitro}} effect of <b>oxiracetam,</b> {{aniracetam}} and alpha-glicerylphosphorylcholine (alphaGPC) on protein kinase C (PKC) activity was studied in rat brain cortex and hippocampus. Administration of <b>oxiracetam</b> and alphaGPC in vivo elicited an early increase of particulate histone-directed PKC activity {{accompanied by a}} decrease of soluble activity and followed {{a few hours later}} by a down regulation of the enzyme. The effect was also observed in vitro when either <b>oxiracetam</b> or alphaGPC were administered at nanomolar concentrations to rat brain cortex slices. Aniracetam had no effect in the cortex but promoted PKC translocation both in vivo and in vitro in the hippocampus. In cortex slices the effect of <b>oxiracetam</b> was antagonized by the addition of AP- 5, an NMDA receptor blocker, but not by CNQX and L-AP 3, antagonists of AMPA and metabotropic glutamate receptors, respectively. Scopolamine also prevented the increase of particulate PKC elicited by <b>oxiracetam</b> in vitro. In the hippocampus the increase of particulate PKC activity was antagonized by AP- 5, CNQX and L-AP 3, indicating participation by both ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors in the action of aniracetam. The data support the hypothesis that PKC activation may be a common mechanism amongst cognition stimulating drugs from different chemical classes...|$|E
40|$|Learning disorders' {{frequency}} {{is relatively}} {{high in the}} school population. In last years several drugs have been proposed, in particular nootropics drugs. Fifteen children (ages 8 years and 2 months to 14 years and 3 months) with learning disabilities were enrolled in this study. They were randomly and blindly assigned to receive either placebo or <b>oxiracetam</b> (30 mg/kg/day) for 6 months. At {{the beginning and end}} of the study neuropsychological and electrophysiological tests were administered. There were no statistically significant differences between placebo and <b>oxiracetam</b> treatment groups with regard to neuropsychological performances and electrophysiological characteristics. Only a small number of subjects (3 patients of <b>oxiracetam</b> treated group and 1 patient of placebo treated group) had significant improvement of cognitive functions and results of electrophysiological features...|$|E
40|$|Micromolar {{concentrations}} of piracetam, aniracetam, and <b>oxiracetam</b> enhanced alpha-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methyl- 4 -isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) -stimulated 45 Ca 2 + influx in primary cultures of cerebellar granule cells. Nootropic drugs increased the efficacy {{but not the}} potency of AMPA and their action persisted {{in the presence of}} the voltage-sensitive calcium channel blocker nifedipine. Potentiation by <b>oxiracetam</b> was specific for AMPA receptor-mediated signal transduction, as the drug changed neither the stimulation of 45 Ca 2 + influx by kainate or N-methyl-D-aspartate nor the activation of inositol phospholipid hydrolysis elicited by quisqualate or (+-) - 1 -aminocyclopentane-trans- 1, 3 -dicarboxylic acid. Piracetam, aniracetam, and <b>oxiracetam</b> increased the maximal density of the specific binding sites for [3 H]AMPA in synaptic membranes from rat cerebral cortex. Taken collectively, these results support the view that nootropic drugs act as positive modulators of AMPA-sensitive glutamate receptors in neurons...|$|E
40|$|Protein Kinase C (PKC) {{activity}} {{was measured in}} soluble and particulate fractions of rat individual brain cortices after in vivo treatment with two cognition enhancers: <b>oxiracetam</b> and alpha-glicerylphosphorylcholine. Both drugs induced an increase (+ 40 - 50 %) of PKC particulate activity at 1 hr after the treatment. The effect was transient; at 5 hours PKC {{activity was}} lower than in controls. The dose response curve to <b>oxiracetam</b> was bell shaped, the increase of PKC being significant at 100 mg/kg. At higher doses the drug induced a decrease in enzyme activity. The increased PKC activity {{may be related to}} the cortical effects of these compounds...|$|E
40|$|A {{pharmacokinetic}} comparison and conformational stability {{study of}} S-oxiracetam (S-ORT) and R-oxiracetam (R-ORT) in beagle dogs {{was used to}} investigate the possible mechanism of different effects of two <b>oxiracetam</b> enantiomers through a random crossover design. After drug administration to beagle dogs, blood samples were collected at different time points for pharmacokinetic analysis using the UPLC-ESI-MS/MS method. Parts of plasma samples were used for conformation transformation studies using a normal phase high performance liquid chromatographic (NP HPLC) method. The study showed that <b>oxiracetam</b> enantiomers maintained their original conformation when administered orally to beagle dogs. Concentrations of S-ORT {{were significantly higher than}} R-ORT 1. 5 and 2 h after administration; the AUC 0 -∞ of S-ORT after oral administration tended to be higher than that of R-ORT, which showed that the different effects between S-ORT and R-ORT may be partly associated with their distinctive absorption at least...|$|E

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the role and}} mechanism of catalpol on neuroprotective effects and memory enhancing effects simultaneously, neuroprotective effects of catalpol were assessed by neurological deficits score, TTC staining, and cerebral blood flow detecting. Morris water maze was employed to investigate its effects on learning and memory and then clarify its possible mechanisms relating the central cholinergic system and BDNF. Edaravone and <b>oxiracetam</b> were used for positive control drugs based on its different action. Results showed that catalpol and edaravone significantly facilitated neurological function recovery, reduced infarction volume, and increased cerebral blood flow in stroke mice. Catalpol and <b>oxiracetam</b> decreased the escape latency significantly and increased the numbers of crossing platform obviously. The levels of ACh, ChAT, and BDNF in catalpol group were increased in a dose-dependent manner, and AChE declined with a U-shaped dose-response curve. Moreover, the levels of muscarinic AChR subtypes M 1 and M 2 in hippocampus were considerably raised by catalpol. These results demonstrated that catalpol may be useful for neuroprotection and memory enhancement, and the mechanism {{may be related to}} the central cholinergic system...|$|E
40|$|Some {{cognition}} enhancers {{were previously}} shown to potently prevent antagonism of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) -evoked release of norepinephrine (NE) brought about in slices of rat hippocampus by kynurenic acid, an endogenous NMDA receptor blocker.

In slices of human neocortex, local application of NMDA evoked release of [3 H]NE; the effect of NMDA was antagonized by several NMDA receptor antagonists, including kynurenic acid. The antagonism of the NMDA-evoked [3 H]NE release produced by 300 mM kynurenate was potently (EC 50, 10 mM) prevented {{by most of the}} nootropics tested, including anirac-etam, <b>oxiracetam,</b> D-cycloserine, and the glutamate analog C...|$|E
40|$|Some {{putative}} cognition enhancers (<b>oxiracetam,</b> aniracetam and D-cycloserine) {{were previously}} shown {{to prevent the}} kynurenic acid antagonism of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) -evoked norepinephrine (NE) release in rat hippocampal slices. This functional in vitro assay was further characterized in the present work. D-Serine, a glutamate coagonist at the NMDA receptor glycine site, concentration-dependently (EC 50. 0. 1 mM) prevented the kynurenate (100 mM) block of the NMDA (100 mM) -evoked [3 H]NE release. L-Serine was ineffective up to 10 mM. The g-aminobutyric acidB (GABAB) receptor antagonist CGP 36742, reported to improve cognitive performance, po-tently prevented the kynurenate antagonism. The activity of CGP 36742 (1 mM) appeared to be unaffected by 10 mM (2) -baclofen, a GABAB receptor agonist; furthermore, CGP 52432...|$|E
40|$|The {{nootropic}} drug, aniracetam, behaves as {{a positive}} modulator of AMPA-sensitive glutamate receptors {{in a variety of}} systems, including intact brain tissue, amphibian oocytes injected with rat brain mRNA, and cultured neurons. In electrophysiological studies, aniracetam both increases the peak amplitude and reduces the rate of decay of the ion current generated by AMPA or quisqualate. In cultured neurons, aniracetam (as well as <b>oxiracetam</b> and piracetam) enhances the stimulation of 45 Ca 2 + influx produced by AMPA but not that produced by kainate or NMDA. In addition, aniracetam (as other nootropic drugs) increases the maximal density of low affinity binding sites for [3 H]AMPA in crude synaptic membranes. Positive modulation of AMPA receptors by aniracetam provides a novel molecular substrate which explains the clinical efficacy of nootropic drugs as memory and cognition enhancers...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} galangal extract on cognitive dysfunction and nerve pathological change in rats with diabetic encephalopathy. Methods: Sixty male SD rats were given high sugar and fat diet except the control group. Fifty days later, the animals were injected with STZ 30 mg/kg through intraperitoneal to establish type 2 diabetes model. Rats were divided into control group, model group, Metformin group, <b>oxiracetam</b> group, galangal extract high and low dose group. After 4 -week administration, Morris water maze was utilized to investigate the effects of different galangal extract on learning and memory ability in rats. After behavioral testing, the blood sugar level was detected. Meanwhile, spectrophotometer {{was used to measure}} the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and maleic dialdehyde (MDA) content of brain tissue. HE staining was used to observe the morphological changes in the hippocampus. Results: Galangal extract can significantly reduce swimming time and swimming distance of diabetic encephalopathy rat model, lower fasting blood glucose while increase body weight. At the same time, SOD activity and MDA content of rat brain were reduced. The morphology of neurons in hippocampus was improved and neuronal nuclear condensation was reduced correspondingly. Conclusions: Galangal extract can significantly improve cognitive ability in diabetic rats, reduce hippocampal pathological changes and have some prevention or treatment effects on of diabetes encephalopath...|$|E
40|$|Many {{theories}} of memory postulate that {{processing of information}} outlasts the learning situation and involves several different physiological substrates. If such physiologically distinct mechanisms or stages of memory do in fact exist, they should be differentially affected by particular experimental manipulations. Accordingly, a selective improvement of the processes underlying short-term memory should be detectable only while the information is encoded in the short-term mode, and a selective influence on long-term memory should be detectable only from the moment when memory {{is based on the}} long-term trace. Our comparative study of the time course {{of the effects of the}} cholinergic agonist arecoline, the gamma-aminobutyric acid type B receptor antagonist CGP 36742, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril, and the nootropic <b>oxiracetam,</b> four substances with completely different primary sites of action, show that the memory-enhancing effects consistently come into evidence no sooner than 16 - 24 h after the learning trial. On the one hand, this finding suggests that all these substances act by way of the same type of mechanism; on the other hand, it demonstrates that the substrate modulated by the compounds forms the basis of memory only after 16 - 24 h. From the observation that animals also show clear signs of retention during the first 16 h [...] i. e., before the effects of the substances are measurable [...] it can be inferred that retention during this time is mediated by other mechanisms that are not influenced by any of the substances...|$|E
