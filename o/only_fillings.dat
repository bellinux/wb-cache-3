40|$|Background. The {{aim of this}} {{retrospective}} study was to compare immediate postoperative pain scores and need for rescue analgesia in children who underwent pulpotomies and restorative treatment and those who underwent restorative treatment only, all under general anaesthesia. Methods. Ninety patients aged {{between 3 and 7}} years who underwent full mouth dental rehabilitation under general anaesthesia were enrolled in the study and reviewed. The experimental group included patients who were treated with at least one pulpotomy, and the control group was treated with dental <b>fillings</b> <b>only.</b> The Wong-Baker FACES scale was used to evaluate self-reported pain and need for rescue analgesia. The data were analysed using the Kruskal-Wallis test, two sample t-tests, chi-square tests, and Pearson’s correlation analysis. Results. Ninety percent of the children experienced postoperative pain in varying degrees of severity. Immediate postoperative pain scores in experimental group were found to be significantly higher than in control group (x 2 = 24. 82, p< 0. 01). In the experimental group, 48 % of the children needed rescue analgesia, compared with only 13 % {{of the children in the}} control group (x 2 = 13. 27, p< 0. 05). Conclusion. Children who underwent pulpotomy treatment had higher postoperative pain scores and greater need for rescue analgesia than control group who underwent <b>only</b> dental <b>fillings...</b>|$|R
5000|$|In 1828, Conrad Van Houten of the Netherlands {{developed}} a mechanical extraction method for extracting the fat from cacao liquor resulting in cacao butter and the partly defatted cacao, a compacted mass of solids {{that could be}} sold as it was [...] "rock cacao" [...] or ground into powder. The processes transformed chocolate from an exclusive luxury to an inexpensive daily snack. A process for making silkier and smoother chocolate called conching was developed in 1879 by Rodolphe Lindt and {{made it easier to}} bake with chocolate, as it amalgamates smoothly and completely with cake batters. Until 1890 to 1900, chocolate recipes were mostly for chocolate drinks, and its presence in cakes was <b>only</b> in <b>fillings</b> and glazes.

5000|$|Limited {{insurance}} coverage: Some dental {{insurance plans}} may provide reimbursement for composite restoration only on front teeth where amalgam restorations would be particularly objectionable on cosmetic grounds. Thus, patients {{may be required}} to pay the entire charge for composite restorations on posterior teeth. For example one dental insurer states that most of their plans will pay for resin (i.e. composite) <b>fillings</b> <b>only</b> [...] "on the teeth where their cosmetic benefit is critical: the six front teeth (incisors and cuspids) and on the facial (cheek side) surfaces of the next two teeth (bicuspids)."

40|$|When electron-electron {{correlations}} are important, it {{is often}} necessary to use exact numerical methods, such as Lanczos diagonalization, to study the full many-body Hamiltonian. Unfortunately, such exact diagonalization methods are restricted to small system sizes. We show that if the Hubbard $U$ term {{is replaced by a}} ``periodic Hubbard" term, the full many body Hamiltonian may be numerically exactly solved, even for very large systems (even $>$ 100 sites), though <b>only</b> for low <b>fillings.</b> However, for half-filled systems and large $U$ this approach is not only no longer exact, it no longer improves extrapolation to larger systems. We discuss how generalized ``randomized variable averaging'' (RVA) or ``phase randomization'' schemes can be reliably employed to improve extrapolation to large system sizes in this regime. This general approach can be combined with any many-body method and is thus of broad interest and applicability. Comment: 6 pages, 3 postscript figures, appende...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} {{stress-strain}} {{analysis of the}} upper central incisor with applied veneer and its variations with proximal fillings and endodontic treatment. The basic materials and veneer types are introduced at the beginning. Next chapter describes the creation of geometric models of a healthy tooth, veneers and fillings. The veneer geometry model {{has been done in}} several variants, taking different thickness values, veneer ranges and used materials into account. A finite element mesh was applied to the models. The computation model was solved using the finite element method using the ANSYS 14. 0 software in the Workbench graphics environment. The results of the analysis show that the composite material is more suitable for veneers placed partially in the dentin - either with proximal fillings or without them. The ceramic material is a better option for endodontic treatment. Veneers located in the enamel are not significantly affected by the choice of material and the ceramic material is more appropriate <b>only</b> when proximal <b>fillings</b> are applied...|$|R
40|$|This {{study on}} the effects of {{particle}} filling and size on the ball load behaviour and power in a dry mill was initiated at the University of the Witwatersrand in 2003. The aim {{of the study was to}} make available a better understanding of the underlying causes in the different power draws that occur in mills when ore particles are being added to the ball load. This mimics the process of filling an industrial grinding mill after a grind out has been performed. Typically after a grind out, the mill operator would refill the mill with ore up to the point where maximum mill power draw is registered. At maximum power draw it is assumed that the void spaces within the ball load are filled with ore particles and that the charge is well mixed. In order to conduct the study an inductive proximity probe was used to measure the dynamics of the load behaviour. This novel technique in measuring load behaviour was chosen due to the fact that the probe could sense the presence of steel balls independent of the presence of particles in the mill. The probe’s response to a load comprised of steel balls <b>only</b> at the <b>fillings</b> of 15 - 45...|$|R
40|$|Using {{numerical}} simulations, {{we investigate}} vortex configurations and pinning in superconductors with honeycomb and kagome pinning arrays. We {{find that a}} variety of novel vortex crystal states can be stabilized at integer and fractional matching field densities. The honeycomb and kagome pinning arrays produce considerably more pronounced commensuration peaks in the critical depinning force than triangular pinning arrays, and also cause additional peaks at noninteger matching fields where a portion of the vortices are located in the large interstitial regions of the pinning lattices. For the honeycomb pinning array, we find matching effects of equal strength at most fillings B/B_ϕ=n/ 2 for n> 2, where n is an integer, in agreement with recent experiments. For kagome pinning arrays, pronounced matching effects generally occur at B/B_ϕ=n/ 3 for n> 3, while for triangular pinning arrays pronounced matching effects are observed <b>only</b> at integer <b>fillings</b> B/B_ϕ=n. At the noninteger matching field peaks in the honeycomb and kagome pinning arrays, the interstitial vortices are arranged in dimer, trimer, and higher order n-mer states that have an overall orientational order. We call these n-mer states "vortex molecular crystals" and "vortex plastic crystals" since they are similar to the states recently observed in colloidal molecular crystal systems. We argue that the vortex molecular crystals have properties in common with certain spin systems such as Ising and n-state Potts models. We show that kagome and honeycomb pinning arrays can be useful for increasing the critical current above that of purely triangular pinning arrays. Comment: 19 pages, 22 postscript figures.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to report on oral, dental and {{prosthetic}} conditions as well as therapeutic measures for temporarily institutionalized geriatric patients. The patients were referred to the dentist since dental problems were observed by the physicians or reported by the patients themselves. This resulted in a selection among the geriatric patients; but they are considered to be representative for this segment of patients exhibiting typical signs of undertreatment. The main problem was the poor retention of the prosthesis, which was associated to insufficient masticatory function and poor nutrition status. Forty-seven percent of the patients were edentulous or had maximally two radicular rests out of function. Altogether 70 % of the maxillary and 51 % of the mandibular jaws exhibited no more teeth. Eighty-nine percent of the patients had a removable denture, and it was observed that maxillary dentures were regularly worn in contrast to mandibular dentures. The partially edentate patients had a mean number of ten teeth, significantly more in the manidublar than maxillary jaw. Treatment consisted mainly in the adaptation and repair of dentures, tooth extractions and <b>fillings.</b> <b>Only</b> few appointments (mostly two) were necessary to improve the dental conditions, resulting in low costs. Patients without dentures or no need for denture repair generated the lowest costs. Slightly more visits were necessary for patients with dementia and musculoskeletal problems. The present findings show that regular maintenance care of institutionalized geriatric patients would limit costs in a long-term perspective, improve the oral situation and reduce the need for invasive treatment...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} to {{evaluate}} the success rate in one-surface ART restorations placed in permanent molars using a glass ionomer cement especially developed for ART in a community with high caries experience; to evaluate the operator influence on its success, post-operative sensitivity and technique acceptance by patients. Prior to placement of the restorations, the Gingival Bleeding Index, Visible Plaque Index, DMFT, dmft indices and treatment needed were assessed. One hundred and fifty five one-surface restorations were placed in permanent molars of school children, according to the WHO ART manual, 1997. After 6 months, the success rate was verified clinically and by slides. At baseline, the mean DMFT was 2. 56 (± 1. 08) and the mean dmft, 2. 53 (± 2. 33). Operators A and B have placed 102 and 53 ART restorations respectively. The mean time of placement was 16 minutes and 25 seconds to operator A and 14 minutes and 43 seconds to operator B. At 6 -month follow up, 152 ART restorations were evaluated and 97. 3 % were assessed to be successful. Two restorations were excluded from the sample because the ART restorations were replaced by amalgam <b>fillings.</b> <b>Only</b> 4 restorations have failed, in which 2 due to caries, 1 due to fistula presence and the other because the restoration was lost. Four patients reported postoperative sensitivity. At this study period, ART treatment seems to be suitable for its purpose. Further evaluations are necessary to the new glass ionomer cements especially developed for ART technique provided good results at 6 -month follow up in a community with high DMFT and dmft indices. The success rate for one-surface cavities in permanent molars was 97. 3 %, and the studied indices seemed to have no influence in this early evolution period...|$|R
40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to {{investigate}} patients attending the dental clinics in the College of Dentistry at King Saud University in Riyadh regarding (I) their knowledge about the restorations they received, and (2) their satisfaction about these dental restorations. Materials and Methods: Self-administered questionnaires were distributed to 300 patients, of which 250 questionnaires were suitable for analysis giving a response rate of 83. 3 %. Results: The results showed that 86. 1 % (n= 210) of the respondents had restorations while 57. 7 % had posterior <b>fillings</b> <b>only.</b> In participants who had fillings, 46 % (n= 115) had amalgam restorations and 33. 2 % had composite restorations. Results of the participants' opinion about the selection of the type of the filling showed that some participants thought it is the dentist only or the patient and the dentist who should detennine the type of the filling material (46. 0 % and 47. 2 % respectively). For the anterior fillings, 60. 7 % preferred white filling. In both anterior and posterior fillings, approximately one third of the participants do not have preference for any type of filling. Data showed that 69. 4 % of the participants are satisfied with their fillings, Almost half of those dissatisfied (47. 5 %) was due to the non-acceptance of the color and/or shape of the tooth.. Postoperative sensitivity constitutes over one third of the subjects' reasons for dissatisfaction about the filling (37. 5 %). Conclusion: Among Saudi patients, there is a deficiency in knowledge about the fillings they received. Majority of the participants were satisfied with the restorations they had. There is need for dental professionals in Saudi Arabia to increase their communication with. their patients with the aim to improve the dental knowledge of these patients. King Saud Universit...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare {{different}} restorative systems for class II cavities with regard to their marginal adaptation in enamel and dentin. To achieve a reduction of polymerisation shrinkage ceramic and composite inserts as well as ceramic and composite inlays in combination with a low viscous luting material were used. The good results which have been shown with ceramic inlay restorations is often attributed to the benefits of their coefficient of thermal expansion and their high modulus of elasticity. The potential of composite material as a substitute for ceramic should be analysed. Methods: In 48 extracted human molars extended modcavities were prepared with a cervical margin located in enamel and dentin. The teeth were filled with directly placed composite fillings, directly placed composite fillings with prefabricated composite inserts, directly placed composite fillings with prefabricated ceramic inserts, directly fabricated composite inlays, ceramic CAD/CIM inlays and CAD/CIM inlays machined from experimentell Polymer Ceramic blocks (n = 8). Replicas of the teeth were made and evaluated at 200 x magnification according to predefined criteria before thermocyling, after thermocycling and after occlusal loading. The interface was investigated between tooth and composite as well as the interface between inlay and composite. Results: In cervical enamel the directly placed composite filling only showed significantly (p &# 61500; 0, 05) more gaps than all other groups. After loading more irregularities were found in the group composite filling only in comparison to all other groups. In dentin the marginal adaptation showed more irregularities than in enamel. Significant differences were found after loading. Composite inserts were inferior to ceramic inserts. With exception of CAD/CIM Polymer Ceramic, inlays showed fewer gaps than other groups. The adhesive bond between Polymer Ceramic inlay and composite resin based cement showed shortcommings. Conclusions: Composite <b>fillings</b> <b>only</b> show more irregularities and gaps than the inlay technique. The use of inserts is able to reduce the effects of polymerisation shrinkage. The adhesive technology is at this point of time able to achieve acceptable marginal adaption even in dentin. In clinical practice the use of adhesive materials must be adopted to the individual situation in order to achieve optimal quality...|$|R
