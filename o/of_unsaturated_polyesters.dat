50|$|Unsaturated polyesters are {{thermosetting}} resins. They {{are generally}} copolymers prepared by polymerizing {{one or more}} diol with saturated and unsaturated dicarboxylic acids (maleic acid, fumaric acid...) or their anhydrides. The double bond <b>of</b> <b>unsaturated</b> <b>polyesters</b> reacts with a vinyl monomer, usually styrene, resulting in a 3-D cross-linked structure. This structure acts as a thermoset. The exothermic cross-linking reaction is initiated through a catalyst, usually an organic peroxide such as methyl ethyl ketone peroxide or benzoyl peroxide.|$|E
5000|$|Unsaturated polyesters are {{condensation}} polymers {{formed by}} the reaction of polyols (also known as polyhydric alcohols), organic compounds with multiple alcohol or hydroxy functional groups, with saturated or unsaturated dibasic acids. Typical polyols used are glycols such as ethylene glycol; acids used are phthalic acid and maleic acid. Water, a by-product of esterification reactions, is continuously removed, driving the reaction to completion. The use <b>of</b> <b>unsaturated</b> <b>polyesters</b> and additives such as styrene lowers the viscosity of the resin. The initially liquid resin is converted to a solid by cross-linking chains. This is done by creating free radicals at unsaturated bonds, which propagate in a chain reaction to other unsaturated bonds in adjacent molecules, linking them in the process. The initial free radicals are induced by adding a compound that easily decomposes into free radicals. This compound is usually and incorrectly known as the catalyst [...] Initiator is the more correct term. Substances used are generally organic peroxides such as benzoyl peroxide or methyl ethyl ketone peroxide.|$|E

40|$|The {{progress}} of the production <b>of</b> <b>unsaturated</b> <b>polyesters,</b> based on various unsaturated and saturated acids and anhydrides in various proportions without added catalyst, was studied by determining {{the amount of water}} produced during the reaction. It was found that the amount of water must be corrected for the propylene glycol, which is also removed from the reaction medium during the polyesterification. The loss of propylene glycol must be reduced, otherwise the stoichiometry of the reaction is changed so that the reaction could not proceed. This loss can be limited if a slow heating program is used during the first stage of the polyesterification. In order to minimize the total time of the polyesterification, the heating rate can be increased after a period experimentally estimated. A mathematical model for the polyesterification based on the production parameters (e. g. the heating program) and on the kinetic parameters is proposed. This model can be used if there is continuous separation and measurement of the water. © 1988...|$|E

40|$|Unsaturated polyesters {{based on}} {{ethylene}} glycol have been synthesized {{using a variety}} of anhydride, saturated and unsaturated dicarboxylic acids and various catalysts. The structure of the polyesters and the effect of the different compositions on the colour of cured polyesters are studied by FTIR, DSC and colorimetry. The structure of cured polyesters greatly depends on the isomerization of maleic acid to fumaric acid during polyesterification. The colour <b>of</b> <b>unsaturated</b> <b>polyesters</b> cured with the most common curing system (MEKP as initiator and CoNp as accelerator) is firstly influenced by the curing accelerator CoNp via the d-d transitions of the transition metal cobalt. Secondly, the composition of the dicarboxylic acids and anhydride used in the polyesterification influences the colour of the polyesters which depends especially on the isomerization of maleic acid. The cured maleate polyesters have more unreacted double bonds and more polar structure {{because of the presence of}} carbonyl groups, compared to the corresponding fumarate polyesters, and this structure affects the colour. The residual catalysts from the polyesterification have minor influence on the colour of cured polyesters. Copyright (C) 2002 Society of Chemical Industry...|$|E

In previous work, we showed the design, modeling and experimental validation of a RD process for synthesis <b>of</b> <b>unsaturated</b> <b>polyesters.</b> The results of our previous work clearly demonstrated that reactive distillation is indeed a very promising alternative for the polyesters synthesis. This study explores the best suitable internals and various feed configurations of a reactive distillation process for unsaturated polyester synthesis. Multi-product simulations were performed to find the operational parameters for producing different grades of polyester in the same equipment. The product transition time during product changeover is determined for various configurations and product grades. The selection criteria for the best configuration are the minimum requirements of volume and energy to produce 100 ktpy polyesters. The results of the rigorous simulations carried out in Aspen Custom Modeler shows that the best configuration has the reactive stripping section as a packed or trayed bubble column, and the reactive rectifying section as a packed column. With respect to the feed configuration, the feeding of monoesters to the RD column significantly intensifies the polyester process as compared to an anhydrous reactant fed to the column.

The degree of reaction of the hydroxyl terminal groups of HO-R-H-PFPE-R-H-OH was monitored by H- 1 -NMR analysis on the fractions collected after sedimentation experiments; amount and composition of the sediment and sedimentation rate were found dependent on both the molecular weight of fluorinated macromer and the method used for polyesterification. The molecular weight of HO-R-H-PFPE-R-H-OH and the reaction conditions had also a strong influence on the final morphology of crosslinked polymers. A very poor interphase adhesion was observed when unreacted HO-R-H-PFPE-R-H-OH was blended with the unsaturated polyester.

In previous work, we performed the conceptual design and modeling of a reactive distillation process for synthesis <b>of</b> <b>unsaturated</b> <b>polyesters.</b> The simulation results of our previous work clearly demonstrated that reactive distillation is a promising alternative for the polyesters synthesis. This paper presents our pilot scale experimental validation work on the proposed RD process for polyester synthesis.

For the first configuration, we demonstrated that mostly monoesters are formed in the RD column, due to the short residence time at pilot scale. Since the combination of a RD column with pre-reactor allows sufficient residence time also at pilot scale, we demonstrated that polyesters are formed in the RD column. The extended rate-based model developed previously was used to simulate the pilot plant RD column. The model adequately predicts and describes the experimental data obtained from the pilot plant.

The molecular structure and composition of the copolyesters was determined by 1 H NMR spectroscopy. The effect of copolymer composition on the physical and thermal properties of these random polyesters were investigated using differential scanning calorimetry. The degree of crystallinity was determined by DSC and wide angle X-ray. The degrees of crystallinity of the saturated and unsaturated copolyesters were generally reduced with respect to poly(butylene succinate), PBS. The melting temperatures of the saturated polyesters were lower, while the melting temperatures of the unsaturated copolyesters were higher than the melting temperature of PBS. The biodegradability of the polyesters was investigated by enzymatic degradation tests. The enzymatic degradation tests were performed in a buffer solution with Candida cylindracea lipase and for the unsaturated polyesters with Rhizopus arrhizus lipase. The extent of biodegradation was quantified as the weight loss of polyester films. Also the surface of the polyester films after degradation was observed using optical microscopy.

Experiments were conducted in different microwave applicators, as CEM Discover, CEM MARS and Sairem INTL, {{as well as with}} conventional heating (oil bath and with an electric heating mantle). The hypothesis was that microwaves can accelerate reaction rates, increase conversion, improve the end product quality and quantity and save energy. Conversion, reaction time, molecular weight and polymer structure, and the quantity of by-products (i. e. water) obtained from different microwave applicatorswere compared with conventional heating. Comparison of power consumption of microwave reactor systems with two different types of applicators, multimode cavity and internal transmission line technology, to conventionally heated reactor was made and presented. Different reaction vessel sizes (1 and 2 liters) were used to investigate whether this can improve the removal of the by-product. The reaction was performed under nitrogen atmosphere or under vacuum at the time when water is produced in order to increase water removal. Different catalysts were tested to discover which catalyst has the best influence on the reaction, and to see, specifically, the difference in performance between microwave heating and conventional heating. Forced cooling of the reactor vessel was used so higher power levels could be applied without increasing the bulk temperature in the reactor.

40|$|Fire {{safety is}} one of the {{greatest}} challenges in public and individual transportation. Especially, the DIN EN 45545 standard for railway demands a very high fire retardance. One of the most commonly used materials for railway applications is the class <b>of</b> <b>unsaturated</b> <b>polyesters</b> (UP). Unfortunately, this widely applicable class of thermosetting composite materials shows only a low fire retardance. Due to the new European standard, UPs are highly jeopardized for further use in railway infrastructure and rolling stock. Today’s UP resins and parts thereof are already fire retardant but in an unsatisfying manner. Commercial materials are filled with a high content of aluminum hydroxide (ATH) or contain halogenated fire retardants. Aim of this work was to use fire retardant monomers to achieve UP resins with high fire retardance. Therefore, phosphorus containing monomers and organic/inorganic hybrid resins from polysilazanes and UPs have been investigated. Three different phosphorus containing monomers (one diacid and two diols) have been investigated in combination with state-of-the-art monomers for UP resins. The phosphorus containing diacid was vinyl phosphonic acid. This acid showed bad condensation properties and the resins a bad performance in terms of processing, glass transition temperature and fire retardance. A derivative from 9, 10 -dihydro- 9 -oxa- 10 -phosphaphenanthrene- 10 -oxide (DOPO) and isobutylbis (hydroxypropyl) phosphine oxide have been investigated as phosphorus containing diols. These compounds were evaluated in terms of condensation, processing (hand lay-up) and material properties. Both compounds achieved very good material properties - especially in combination - but all formulations required ATH as an additional fire retardant filler to reach the highest fire retardance. Four formulations have been identified and developed which fulfill the highest requirement for Maximum Average Rate of Heat Emission (MARHE) in DIN EN 45545 standard and showed much better processing properties than commercially available UP resins. The combination of UPs and polysilazanes aimed to increase the fire retardance of unsaturated polyester resins without fillers for resin transfer molding by forming a ceramic protective layer. Due to their high reactivity against standard UP end groups a chemical modification of the UPs has been necessary to develop an appropriate hybrid resin with good processing properties. Crosslinkable end capping reagents are important to obtain satisfying properties in cured Fiber Reinforced Plastics (FRP). The use of polysilazanes leads to an increase in char formation (formation of ceramic products) as well as smoke suppression and total heat reduction in comparison to standard UP resins. Beneficial for this material is a high mechanical stiffness of the burned FRPs which could be of interest for various applications, especially construction purposes, where residual mechanical properties are necessary...|$|E
30|$|Maleic acid (MA) and {{fumaric acid}} (FA) are very {{important}} chemical intermediates that find applications in nearly every field of industrial chemistry. Maleic acid is an important raw material used in the manufacture <b>of</b> lubricant additives, <b>unsaturated</b> <b>polyester</b> resins, surface coatings, plasticizers, copolymers and agricultural chemicals [1 – 5]. Fumaric acid is naturally present in many plants and its name originates from Fumaria officinalis, a climbing annual plant, from which it was first isolated [6]. It {{is used as a}} food acidulent and as a raw material in the manufacture <b>of</b> <b>unsaturated</b> <b>polyester</b> resins, quick setting inks, furniture lacquers, paper sizing chemicals, and aspartic acid [7, 8].|$|R
40|$|In recent years, a few {{research}} {{studies have been}} published on the blending <b>of</b> <b>unsaturated</b> <b>polyester</b> and phenolic resins {{for the purpose of}} improving the fire properties <b>of</b> <b>unsaturated</b> <b>polyester</b> resins. However, there has been no published study on the cure and strain monitoring <b>of</b> <b>unsaturated</b> polyester/phenolic blends during composite manufacturing. In this study, non-crimp triaxial glass fabric preforms were infused with the unsaturated polyester/phenolic blends, and the strain developments inside the composites were monitored using fibre Bragg grating sensors, as the long and complex curing stages were progressing at different temperatures. Strain-free fibre Bragg grating sensors and also thermocouples were utilised for temperature monitoring and compensation in order to obtain true strain developments and residual strains. The results were associated with a study presenting the cure analyses <b>of</b> <b>unsaturated</b> polyester/phenolic blends. The <b>unsaturated</b> <b>polyester</b> and the phenolics were found to be incompatible and exhibited different curing mechanisms in the blends, which were also observable in the strain development results. This paper has been the first attempt to (i) process these novel resin systems in the vacuum infusion process and (ii) monitor the long, complex and high-temperature cure cycles and the strain developments in the vacuum infusion process using fibre Bragg gratings...|$|R

40|$|<b>Unsaturated</b> <b>polyester</b> is {{traditionally}} produced in a batch wise operating reaction vessel {{connected to a}} distillation unit. An attractive alternative for the synthesis <b>of</b> <b>unsaturated</b> <b>polyester</b> is a reactive distillation. To value such alternative synthesis route reliable process models need to be developed. In this paper, the strategy is described {{for the development of}} the reactive distillation model. Essential parts of the reactive distillation model are kinetic and thermodynamic which are subsequently validated with the experimental data of the traditional batch process such as acid value of the polyester, weight of the distillate and glycol concentration in the distillate. We find that the models predict these important variables reliably. <b>Unsaturated</b> <b>polyester</b> production time is around 12 ¿hours in the traditional batch process. However, the simulation study of the reactive distillation process shows that the total production time <b>of</b> <b>unsaturated</b> <b>polyester</b> in a continuous reactive distillation system is between 1. 5 ¿hours to 2 ¿hours for the same product quality as during batch production. The equilibrium conversion is raised by 7 % compared to the traditional batch process. The model demonstrated that reactive distillation has the potential to intensify the process by factor of 6 to 8 in comparison to the batch reactor...|$|R
