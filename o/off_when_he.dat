5|$|McCain's {{comeback}} plan paid <b>off</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> won the New Hampshire primary on January 8, defeating former Governor of Massachusetts Mitt Romney {{in a close}} contest, to {{once again}} {{become one of the}} front-runners in the race. In mid-January, McCain placed first in the South Carolina primary, narrowly defeating Mike Huckabee. Pundits credited the third-place finisher, Tennessee's former U.S. Senator Fred Thompson, with drawing votes from Huckabee in South Carolina, thereby giving a narrow win to McCain.|$|E
5|$|Dale walks {{alone in}} the fields to cool <b>off</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> comes across a cow that has had its stomach gutted. Realizing the danger, {{he is about to}} head back when a walker attacks him. The group races towards his screams, and Daryl quickly dispatches the walker; Carl realizes it is the walker he found in the swamp. Hershel finds Dale's injures are too severe and he will not survive. The group agrees to euthanize Dale, but Rick himself cannot take the shot. Daryl takes the {{revolver}} and ends Dale's suffering.|$|E
5|$|To {{improve his}} officiating, Bavetta {{refereed}} {{games for the}} New Jersey pro league and Rucker League in Harlem during the off-seasons and studied NBA rulebooks. In 1983, {{he became the first}} referee to undergo rigorous physical training. He ran six to eight miles and took three-hour naps every day. His effort paid <b>off</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> {{emerged as one of the}} best referees. In the 1980s, he was named chief referee, who has the power to approve or overrule calls made by other officials. He was assigned to officiate his first playoff game in 1986.|$|E

5|$|Detective Gordon Eaves (Lewis Fitz-Gerald) {{is sent to}} the Bay. Hugo, who {{is hiding}} at Martha's farm, overhears him and {{recognises}} him as the cop that he and the others paid <b>off</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was involved in the people smuggling racket. Martha makes this aware to Angelo who agrees to go to Martha's farm with Eaves. On the way, Eaves threatens Angelo to go along with his plans. Eaves shoots Hugo and then flees the scene. Hugo is rushed indoors and Martha phones local doctor, Rachel Armstrong (Amy Mathews). Eaves is caught by Angelo, Tony and Charlie Buckton (Esther Anderson). Angelo then arrests both Hugo and Martha. As Angelo is driving them to the police station, he suddenly stops and lets them out. He tells Hugo to punch him {{to make it look like}} he and Martha had overpowered him and escaped. Martha thanks Angelo for letting them leave together. Hugo and Martha use Angelo's police car to escape and they flee the Bay, leaving behind their family and friends.|$|E
5|$|He then {{falls in}} love with Delilah in the valley of Sorek. The Philistines {{approach}} Delilah and induce her with 1,100 silver coins to find the secret of Samson's strength so that they can capture their enemy, but Samson refuses to reveal the secret and teases her, telling her that he will lose his strength if he is bound with fresh bowstrings. She does so while he sleeps, but when he wakes up he snaps the strings. She persists, and he tells her that he can be bound with new ropes. She ties him up with new ropes while he sleeps, and he snaps them, too. She asks again, and he says that he can be bound if his locks are woven into a weaver's loom. She weaves them into a loom, but he simply destroys the entire loom and carries it <b>off</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> wakes.|$|E
5|$|Though Hunt was {{considered}} for the 2004 State of Origin series among other fullbacks, he was ignored for the entire series in favour of Penrith Panthers fullback Rhys Wesser. Hunt's good form in 2006 paid <b>off</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was selected {{to play for the}} Australian team against New Zealand on 5 May as a replacement for the injured Anthony Minichiello. This decision proved controversial, due to his being preferred over the in-form Matt Bowen. That game was Hunt's representative and international debut, and though he performed well, he only played for 50 minutes, making one error and 83 metres in kick returns. However, he was unable to complete the game due to concussion sustained by a blow from Frank Pritchard. He was taken unconscious from the field and played no further part in the match.|$|E

He played for Chirk, before joining Northwich Victoria in 1892. His career took <b>off</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> signed with Manchester City in 1894 and turned professional in January 1895. He captained the team to the club's first major honour, a 1–0 victory over Bolton Wanderers in the 1904 FA Cup Final. He moved to Manchester United in May 1906 after being banned for bribing Aston Villa half-back Alex Leake £10 to lose a match. There he won the league title in 1907–08 and 1910–11, the FA Cup in 1909, as well as two FA Charity Shields. He also helped to set up the Players' Union, which was a fore-runner of the Professional Footballers' Association. He returned to Manchester City in 1921 at the age of 47 and played a further 32 games before retiring in 1924, making him the oldest ever player for City, United and Wales. He later ran the Stretford Road Hotel and helped to coach the short-lived Manchester Central.|$|E

50|$|After being {{punched in}} the nose by Dr. Cox in the {{previous}} episode, Dr. Kelso is now detectable from a distance as he makes a whistling sound <b>when</b> <b>he</b> breathes, and so everyone, particularly Ted, takes advantage by slacking <b>off</b> <b>when</b> <b>he's</b> not around. However, as no one will admit to seeing the incident, Dr. Kelso can't fire Dr. Cox and therefore takes his anger out on him by making him spend his weekend giving prisoners their yearly physicals, forcing him to spend his free time away from his new son, Jack.|$|R

25|$|Steel studied media & film {{studies at}} high school then moved to Sydney to pursue {{full-time}} work in the film industry. Steel's tenacity paid <b>off</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> scored a lighting job on the high-rating ABC program Heartbreak High. This was the break Steel needed, giving him enough technical experience to work behind-the-scenes on bigger projects such as the feature films Doing Time for Patsy Cline, Dark City and Oscar and Lucinda.|$|E
25|$|At a young age, Wetch became {{fascinated with}} gambling, {{so much so}} that his mother {{threatened}} to enter him in Gamblers Anonymous. He pitched coins, played cards, bet on sports, and even on pinball. His other gambling pursuits tapered <b>off</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> discovered a pool table at 13 while playing cards in a friend's basement. Wetch was soon hooked, spending as much time as possible in a local pool room called the Rack & Cue, playing eight ball and nine ball for 20 cents a game or more. He earned free table time by recording high scores on the room's video games.|$|E

25|$|Malla {{made his}} debut for Nepal {{as a member}} of the U-15 cricket team in the year 2005. He then {{represented}} Nepal in ACC U-17 and finally ACC U-19, in the same year. He was named to Nepal U-19s' squad for the 2006 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup, following some impressive performances playing in the junior age levels. His career took <b>off</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> scored 145 runs in six innings, including 46* in the Plate semi-final of the U-19 World cup to beat South Africa U-19s. His reward was a place on the senior squad for the 2006 Intercontinental Cup.|$|E
25|$|Australian {{authorities}} {{alleged that}} as Haneef left Britain he recklessly provided assistance to a terrorist organisation by leaving his relative, Sabeel Ahmed, a SIM card {{and the balance}} of a two-year mobile phone contract to use and pay <b>off</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> left Britain in July 2006. Relatives have said that he left the SIM card behind to save money by not surrendering the remaining value of the contract to the telephone company. The prosecutor claimed the SIM card was found inside the vehicle used in the Glasgow Airport attack. This allegation, central to the case, {{has proved to be}} false and investigating British police officers have concluded that the case is being driven by politics rather than policing.|$|E
25|$|Sutcliffe {{attacked}} Olive Smelt in Halifax in August. Employing {{the same}} modus operandi, he struck {{her from behind}} and used a knife to slash her, this time above her buttocks. Again he was interrupted, and left his victim badly injured but alive. Like Rogulskyj, Smelt suffered emotional scars, including clinical depression. On 27 August, Sutcliffe attacked 14-year-old Tracy Browne in Silsden. He struck her from behind and hit her on the head five times while she was walking along a country lane. He ran <b>off</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> saw the lights of a passing car, leaving his victim requiring brain surgery. Sutcliffe was not convicted of the attack, but confessed to it in 1992.|$|E

He leaves his starch <b>off</b> <b>when</b> <b>he's</b> with them. What's the matter with me, I should like to know? I'm a college man, even though I did go as an exhibitioner.

25|$|Sander {{began his}} musical {{education}} {{at the age of}} seven, studying violin at the Tallinn Music School, followed by terms at the State Choreography School, and the Estonian Music Academy where he majored in piano and conducting.

At the age of nineteen, he and his swing orchestra Modern Fox won a major talent competition in Moscow, launching his career first in the Soviet Union and later in Scandinavia.|$|E
25|$|Gudas {{played in}} the Czech Extraliga with HC Kladno during the 2008–09 season. Gudas was {{selected}} by the Everett Silvertips of the WHL {{in the first round}} of the CHL Import Draft with the 20th pick. Gudas was invited to the Kings training camp after going un-drafted in the 2009 NHL Draft. He would not be offered a contract from the Kings following training camp. He would then join the Everett Silvertips that fall. He would have a strong season with the Silvertips, posting 7 goals, 30 assists, and 151 penalty minutes. The choice to play for the Everett Silvertips would pay <b>off</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was selected by the Tampa Bay Lightning in the 2010 NHL Entry Draft with their 3rd-round draft pick. Gudas would participate in the 2010 Lightning Developmental Camp that ran from 10–14 July.|$|E

During an episode of season 4, Wizard captain Keith Colburn demanded that cameras be turned <b>off</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> got into a heated argument with his brother Monte. The cameras were turned off, but the Colburns neglected to remove their wireless mics and the subsequent exchange was recorded and featured in the episode. Also in season 4, Cornelia Marie Captain Phil Harris asked the cameraman filming him not to tell anyone else about his injuries, for fear it would stall his fishing. Later on, crew member and later acting captain Murray Gamrath, concerned for Phil's well-being, asked a cameraman {{to keep an eye}} on him and to report any problem. During season 5, the camera crew on the Northwestern were requested not to film crew member Jake Anderson being informed of his sister's death, which the camera crew honored.|$|E
