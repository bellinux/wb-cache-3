40|$|Computer {{analysed}} transit of {{a liquid}} bolus containing Tc 99 m (RT) was compared with manometry {{for the detection}} of oesophageal motility disorders in 151 patients with a variety of <b>oesophageal</b> symptoms. <b>Manometry</b> was abnormal in 99 of whom 44 had abnormal RT (sensitivity 44 %); it was normal in 52 of whom 37 had normal RT (specificity 71 %). The commonest manometric abnormalities were non-specific motility disorders characterised by abnormalities of peristaltic amplitude, waveform or baseline. Radionuclide transit was abnormal in only 32 / 77 (42 %) of these. Achalasia, which is characterised by complete aperistalsis, was the least common diagnosis, but all five cases had abnormal RT. Simultaneous manometry and RT in 30 patients showed that the transit of a liquid bolus through the oesophagus is determined by the propagation rather than the form of the peristaltic contraction. Because non-specific motility disorders are common in clinical practice, RT is not a useful screening test for oesophageal dysmotility...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Objectives: SSc is a {{clinically}} heterogeneous and generalized disease, {{characterized by}} {{thickness of the}} connective tissue of the skin and internal organs, such as the digestive tract, impairing gastrointestinal (GI) motility. Our aim is to evaluate retrospectively abnormalities of oesophageal motility, gastric emptying, oro-cecal transit time (OCTT) and small intestine bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) in a large cohort of SSc patients. Methods: Ninety-nine SSc patients {{were included in the}} study. Forty-two patients underwent <b>oesophageal</b> conventional <b>manometry,</b> 45 performed a [13 C]octanoic acid breath test to measure gastric emptying time and all 99 patients performed a lactulose breath test in order to evaluate OCTT and SIBO.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Itopride {{is a new}} prokinetic {{agent that}} {{combines}} antidopaminergic and cholinesterase inhibitory actions. Previous studies suggested that itopride improves heartburn in functional dyspepsia, and decreases oesophageal acid exposure in gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. It remains unclear whether this effect is due to effects of itopride on the lower oesophageal sphincter (LES). AIMS: To {{study the effects of}} itopride on fasting and postprandial LES function in healthy subjects. METHODS: Twelve healthy volunteers (five men; 32. 6 Â± 2. 0 years) underwent three <b>oesophageal</b> sleeve <b>manometry</b> studies after 3 days premedication with itopride 50 mg, itopride 100 mg or placebo t. d. s. Drug was administered after 30 min and a standardized meal was administered after 90 min, with measurements continuing to 120 min postprandially. Throughout the study, 10 wet swallows were administered at 30 -min intervals, and gastrointestinal symptoms were scored on 100 mm visual analogue scales at 15 -min intervals. RESULTS: Lower oesophageal sphincter resting pressures, swallow-induced relaxations and the amplitude or duration of peristaltic contractions were not altered by both doses of itopride, at all time points. Itopride pre-treatment inhibited the meal-induced rise of transient LES relaxations (TLESRs). CONCLUSIONS: Itopride inhibits TLESRs without significantly affecting oesophageal peristaltic function or LES pressure. These observations support further studies with itopride in gastro-oesophageal reflux disease...|$|R

40|$|Recently, {{high-resolution}} <b>oesophageal</b> <b>manometry</b> {{was added}} to the armamentarium of researchers and gastroenterologists.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Baclofen {{decreases}} {{gastro-oesophageal reflux}} episodes in healthy subjects {{by reducing the}} incidence of transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxations. AIM: To investigate the effect of baclofen on reflux symptoms, oesophageal pH and lower <b>oesophageal</b> sphincter <b>manometry</b> in patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. METHODS: A double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-way crossover design was used to study the effect of baclofen on heartburn and regurgitation 3 h after a provocation test meal in 37 patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. Additionally, in 20 of these patients, the effect of baclofen on oesophageal pH, transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxations and basal lower oesophageal sphincter pressure was studied. RESULTS: Baclofen significantly decreased the acid reflux time and the incidence of gastro-oesophageal reflux episodes (8. 3 +/- 8. 8 % vs. 12. 4 +/- 12. 0 %, P = 0. 03 and 10. 9 +/- 7. 3 per 3 h vs. 18. 7 +/- 12. 4 per 3 h). The incidence of transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxations was significantly lower with baclofen than with placebo (15. 1 +/- 6. 4 per 3 h vs. 22. 8 +/- 5. 4 per 3 h, P < 0. 0001). Lower oesophageal sphincter pressure {{and the percentage of}} transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxations associated with reflux were not affected by baclofen. No significant effect on symptom scores was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Baclofen decreases post-prandial acid reflux in patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease by reducing the incidence of transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxations.

40|$|Recent {{combined}} manometric-barostat studies {{demonstrated that}} the oesophageal body exhibits both peristaltic contractions and tone. This study further characterized the neural modulation of tone in the feline oesophageal body. Simultaneous <b>oesophageal</b> barostat and <b>manometry</b> were performed in 20 adult cats under ketamine sedation. Oesophageal tone and peristalsis were assessed in the distal smooth muscle oesophagus. Cholinergic modulation was studied using neostigmine, erythromycin, atropine and vagotomy. Nitrergic regulation was assessed using sildenafil to increase cellular cyclic guanosine monophosphate and the nitric oxide synthase blocker Nomega-nitro-l-arginine (l-NNA). The presence of a tonic contractile activity in the distal oesophageal body was confirmed. Peristaltic contractions proceeded along the oesophageal body over the background tonic contraction. Neostigmine and erythromycin enhanced (20 - 30 %) whereas bilateral vagotomy and atropine strongly decreased oesophageal tone (50 - 60 %). However, l-NNA increased (40 %) and sildenafil decreased oesophageal tone (30 %). Therefore, tonic contractile activity in the oesophageal body is mainly caused by a continuous cholinergic excitatory input. A nitric oxide inhibitory mechanism may have a complementary role in the regulation of oesophageal tone. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|In {{children}} technical {{limitations of}} upper <b>oesophageal</b> sphincter <b>manometry</b> have restricted investigation to the pull through technique under sedation. In {{this study we}} have used an adapted sleeve manometric technique for upper oesophageal sphincter monitoring in unsedated children and determined {{the influence of the}} state of arousal on upper oesophageal sphincter pressure. Twenty six children aged 3 to 42 months (median 17. 5 months), who were referred for evaluation of oesophageal motor function, were studied with dual sleeve manometric assemblies which monitored upper and lower oesophageal sphincter pressures simultaneously. Pharyngeal, oesophageal body, and gastric pressures were also monitored with seven perfused side holes. Recordings were made for four hours after a meal and were technically successful in 24 children. The child's state of arousal was scored every 12 th minute as follows: (A) resting, eyes closed, (B) resting, eyes open, (C) moving but comfortable, (D) restless and uncomfortable, (E) crying. In 67 % of the 12 minute samples the children showed good adaptation to the procedure (arousal states A to C). There was a highly significant difference in upper oesophageal sphincter pressure between each of the arousal states (p less than 0. 0001), being lowest in category A at (mean (SD) 18. 1 (10. 3) mmHg and highest in category D 55. 7 (13. 2) mm Hg. Abrupt changes in the state of arousal were associated with equally abrupt changes in upper oesophageal sphincter pressure. The state of arousal of unsedated children has an important influence on upper oesophageal sphincter pressure. It is essential that this factor is controlled for in any studies of upper oesophageal sphincter tone in children. The sleeve technique is capable of monitoring upper oesophageal sphincter motility for prolonged periods in unsedated children...|$|R
40|$|The {{relative}} {{prevalence of}} abnormalities of coronary flow reserve and oesophageal function was ascertained in 32 syndrome X patients with typical angina chest pain, a positive exercise test, and normal coronary arteries. Coronary flow reserve {{in response to}} a hyperaemic dose of papaverine was measured using an intracoronary Doppler catheter positioned in the left anterior descending coronary artery. An abnormal coronary flow reserve was defined as being < 3. 0. Patients were investigated for <b>oesophageal</b> dysfunction by <b>manometry</b> and 24 -hour pH monitoring. Thirteen patients had an impaired coronary flow reserve (group 1) and 19 patients had a normal flow reserve (group 2).

40|$|Abstract: <b>Oesophageal</b> <b>manometry</b> {{has been}} {{considered}} the "gold standard" test {{for the evaluation of}} oesophageal motility. <b>Oesophageal</b> <b>manometry</b> allows physicians to assess peristalsis by using informations about the shape, amplitude and duration of the oesophageal contraction, but it does not offer direct information about bolus transit through the oesophagus. Recent studies demonstrate that combined impedance-manometry provides important additional information about oesophageal motility as compared to conventional manometry such as: (1) monitoring of bolus transport patterns without the use of radiation, (2) calculation of bolus transit parameters, (3) evaluation of bolus clearance and (4) investigation of the relationships between bolus transit and LES relaxation. These changes could potentially improve diagnostic accuracy of oesophageal motility testing, advancing both clinical and basic research.

Repeat fundoplication for recurrent reflux was performed in two cases during the study. Heartburn and regurgitation were significantly lessened (p < 0. 005), but the incidence of dysphagia was slightly increased. Endoscopy showed six of 21 fundic wraps to be defective.

Of 23 biopsies from the 12 patients, 13 were specialised columnar type, three were junctional type, and seven were fundic type.

Thirty seven patients with confirmed gastro-oesophageal reflux disease who had a Belsey Mark IV antireflux procedure were evaluated preoperatively and three to six months postoperatively including endoscopy, lower <b>oesophageal</b> sphincter <b>manometry,</b> and 24 hour ambulatory pH metry. In 30 of 37 patients the Belsey Mark IV fundoplication was judged successful based on symptom relief and healing of oesophagitis. In these 30 patients percentage reflux for total, upright, and supine time (median and range) decreased significantly (p < 0. 001) from 10. 0 % (2. 7 - 35. 3 %), 10. 8 % (3. 2 - 39. 9 %), and 6. 7 (0. 0 - 33. 0 %) respectively to 0. 5 % (0. 0 - 7. 4 %), 0. 6 % (0. 0 - 13. 7 %), and 0. 1 % (0. 0 - 4. 9 %) after operation. This decrease in reflux time resulted predominantly from a significant (p < 0. 001) {{reduction in the number of}} reflux episodes from 98 (23 - 231) to 14 (0 - 82) postoperatively. Normalisation of total reflux time (upper limit of normal for time with pH below 4 : 4 %) was found in 89 % and normalisation of total and upright and supine reflux in 64 % of successfully operated patients with confirmed abnormal acid reflux before operation. A successful antireflux procedure was associated with significant (p < 0. 001) increases in lower oesophageal sphincter pressure from 7. 8 (0. 6) mm Hg to 14. 5 (0. 7) mm Hg mean (SEM). In seven patients with a failed antireflux operation basal lower oesophageal sphincter pressure did not change significant;y (preoperative value 5. 7 (1. 3) mm Hg; postoperative value 7. 8 (0. 8) mm Hg). In these patients reflux time did not decrease after the operation and remained in the abnormal range in all patients. It is concluded that a successful, in contrast with a failed, Belsey Mark IV fundoplication is associated with significant decreases in total, upright, and supine reflux time. Normalisation of pH metry variables is not a prerequisite for successful antireflux surgery. A surgery.

The patients were divided into three groups according to the percentage of peristaltic activity during conventional manometry: group 1 (n = 21) had 100 % peristalsis; group 2 (n = 29) had 1 - 99 % peristalsis and group 3 (n = 8) were aperistaltic. All the patients in group 3 had achalasia and remained aperistaltic during eating, however, was less than with water swallows in both group 1 (53 % compared with 100 %) and group 2 (49 % compared with 82. 3 %) patients. Synchronous contractions and non-conducted swallows were correspondingly increased during eating. Although there was a significant correlation between the amplitude of peristaltic contractions with water and bread in groups 1 and 2, mean peristaltic amplitudes were less with bread than with water swallows.

Reasons for referral in the 268 first referrals were: dysphagia 50. 4 %, non-cardiac chest pain 23. 1 %, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease 14. 2 %, connective tissue disease 11. 2 %, and 'other' 1. 1 %. Manometry was normal in 49. 3 %, showed achalasia in 17. 9 %, diffuse oesophageal spasm in 13. 4 %, connective tissue disease in 7. 8 %, hypertensive lower oesophageal sphincter in 4. 5 %, nutcracker oesophagus in 2. 6 %, and 'other' in 4. 5 %. A positive diagnosis was significantly more common if dysphagia {{was the reason for}} referral (65. 9 % v 35. 3 %, p < 0. 01). A positive diagnosis was established in 60 % of patients referred with connective tissue disease, 30. 6 % with non-cardiac chest pain, and 21. 1 % with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. A positive diagnosis was significantly more common in connective tissue disease when symptoms were present (85 % v 10 %, p < 0. 05).

In both groups the amplitude of oesophageal contractions were significantly greater after big gulps than little swallows (p less than 0. 01) and this was true for wet (82. 0 v 68. 9 mmHg) and dry swallows (52. 3 v 43. 3 mmHg). For the patients' wet swallows the mean values were 73. 0 and 56. 0 mmHg. Thus, the amplitude of oesophageal peristalsis can be controlled voluntarily. This effect may account {{for some of the}} within subject variation in the amplitude of oesophageal contractions. During <b>oesophageal</b> <b>manometry</b> subjects should be encouraged to standardise the size of their swallows whenever possible. Patients with symptoms related to abnormal oesophageal peristalsis such as dysphagia, heartburn, and chest pain may benefit from biofeedback training...|$|E
40|$|In {{the eyes}} of {{scientific}} researchers, there are various manometric techniques that are useful tools for studying the motility of the gastrointestinal tract. Clinicians, however, regard most of these techniques as toys, either {{because they do not}} lead to clinically relevant results, or because they are too cumbersome in clinical practice. Nevertheless, a number of manometric techniques have reached the status of clinically relevant diagnostic procedure in gastroenterology. Among these, <b>oesophageal</b> <b>manometry</b> is the most important. Not only has conventional <b>oesophageal</b> <b>manometry</b> been added to the diagnostic armamentarium of many hospitals, but also prolonged ambulatory recording of oesophageal pressures (usually combined with pH monitoring). Small intestinal manometry has also gained the status of a diagnostic tool, in particular in patients in whom the existence of pseudo-obstruction syndrome is suspected and in patients in whom total colectomy is considered because of intractable constipation. Sphincter of Oddi manometry is another example of a clinically relevant manometric technique to be used in particular in patients with suspected dyskinesia of the sphincter of Oddi. The value of anorectal manometry may have been overestimated in the past. The most important indication is the exclusion of Hirschsprung disease. The contribution of anorectal manometry to the diagnosis of anismus and to the work-up of patients with faecal incontinence is limite...|$|E
40|$|Left {{ventricular}} {{function and}} oesophageal function (including <b>oesophageal</b> <b>manometry</b> and pH monitoring) were investigated and a psychiatric assessment {{carried out in}} 63 patients with angina pectoris and normal coronary angiograms. Twenty two (35 %) patients had regional abnormalities of left ventricular wall motion (group A). Thirty six (57 %) patients had an oesophageal abnormality (group B); 19 patients had gastro-oesophageal reflux and abnormal oesophageal motility, five had gastro-oesophageal reflux alone, and 12 had abnormal oesophageal motility alone. Only four had regional abnormalities of the left ventricular wall and abnormal oesophageal function. In nine (14 %) patients left ventricular and oesophageal function were normal (group C). Psychiatric morbidity was significantly less common in group A than in groups B and C and was similar in group B and group C. A definite abnormality of left ventricular function, oesophageal function, or psychiatric morbidity is present in {{a high proportion of}} patients with angina pectoris and normal coronary angiograms and in some instances this may lead to specific treatment. If quantitative assessment of left ventricular function is normal, oesophageal investigations should be performed. Endoscopy of the upper gastrointestinal tract may demonstrate oesophageal disease, but, if findings are normal, <b>oesophageal</b> <b>manometry</b> and ambulatory oesophageal pH monitoring (including during treadmill exercise testing) should be carried out...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Rumination is the voluntary, albeit {{subconscious}} {{return of}} gastric contents to the mouth. Currently, rumination syndrome and repetitive belching disorders are considered separate diagnoses, {{as defined by}} Rome III criteria and high-resolution <b>oesophageal</b> <b>manometry</b> (HRM). AIM: To test the hypothesis that these conditions represent a common behavioural response to aversive digestive stimuli and that successful treatment can be directed at both the stimulus and the response. METHODS: Case-note review of consecutive patients with a final diagnosis of behavioural digestive disorders between August 2009 and October 2011. RESULTS: Thirty-five of 46 (76...|$|E
40|$|Effects of {{pancopride}} (5 and 10 mg, intravenously), {{on lower}} oesophageal sphincter pressure (LOESP), were assessed in healthy volunteers {{by means of}} <b>oesophageal</b> <b>manometry.</b> After pancopride 10 mg, the LOESP was higher than placebo and 5 mg pancopride {{but there were no}} differences among the three treatments (P = 0. 42). The areas under the curve were similar without differences, neither with absolute measurements (P = 0. 53) nor after a baseline correction (P = 0. 16). In conclusion, pancopride has no clinically relevant effect on lower oesophageal sphincter pressure...|$|E
40|$|Twenty-three {{patients}} with intractable gastro-oesophageal reflux were treated by insertion of the Angelchik antireflux prosthesis. Good symptomatic relief was achieved in over 80 % of patients reviewed up to 28 months after operation {{and there was}} marked resolution of oesophagitis as seen on endoscopy. <b>Oesophageal</b> <b>manometry</b> and pH studies performed preoperatively and at 3 and 12 months after operation, showed {{a significant increase in}} lower oesophageal sphincter pressure with decreased acid reflux. Some technical problems were encountered, but the prosthesis is potentially a simple and effective means of controlling gastro-oesophageal reflux...|$|E
40|$|Although several {{modalities}} {{are available}} to investigate oesophageal motility disorders, manometry is the gold standard. The procedure is increasingly available in district general hospitals but the clinical utility of this investigation in this setting remains unclear. The aim {{in this study was}} to evaluate the use and outcome of <b>oesophageal</b> <b>manometry</b> in a district general hospital. Data on 100 consecutive <b>oesophageal</b> <b>manometry</b> procedures were analysed, taking into account the referral pattern, indications, and results. The indications were gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (preoperative assessment before fundoplication) (58), dysphagia (28), chest pain (12), and epigastric pain (2). Diagnoses were made using predefined standard criteria and were as follows: normal (41), non-specific motility disorder (NSMD) (38), achalasia (15), diffuse oesophageal spasm (4), and scleroderma (2). Of the 58 patients who had undergone manometry as a preoperative assessment of oesophageal motility, 27 (47 %) were abnormal. Twenty five (43 %) had NSMD and two (3 %) had achalasia. Forty eight of these preoperative cases were combined with 24 hour pH recording, which confirmed acid reflux in 35 (73 %). The experience reported here reflects the published evidence that the use of manometry is changing. It is now more commonly used for assessment before antireflux surgery and for dysphagia, and the use in the assessment of chest pain is declining. The findings confirm the importance of eliminating achalasia before inappropriate antireflux surgery...|$|E
