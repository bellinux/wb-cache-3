5|$|Although quick {{draw and}} hip {{shooting}} {{was an important}} skill in the West, {{only a handful of}} historically known gunslingers were known to be fast, such as Luke Short, John Wesley Hardin, Wild Bill Hickok, Doc Holliday, and Billy the Kid. Shooting a pistol with one hand is normally associated with gunslingers, and is also a standard for them of the era to carry two guns and fire ambidextrously. Capt. Jonathan R. Davis carried two revolvers in his iconic gunfight, while Jesse James himself carried <b>over</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> dozen revolvers in many of his gunfights.|$|E

5|$|Ciomadul {{has been}} active for <b>over</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> million years, with the oldest {{activity}} between 1,000,000 and 750,000 years ago forming lava domes. Older estimates indicate that activity did not start before 250,000 years ago, while more recent research indicated a start of volcanism over 600,000 years ago. Volcanism at Ciomadul consisted mostly of the extrusion of lava domes, their collapse forming block-and-ash flows and subplinian and Vulcanian eruptions.|$|E
5|$|Florida State University receives, in {{addition}} to state funding, financial support from the Florida State University Foundation, an organization which exists solely to manage gifts and donations to the university.

The endowment helps provide scholarships to students of the university, support for long-term university goals and for other specific purposes as designated by the various donors.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, Boston was {{estimated}} to have 667,137 residents (a density of 13,841 persons/sq mile, or 5,344/km2) living in 272,481 housing units— an 8% population increase over 2010. The city is the third most densely populated large U.S. city of <b>over</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> million residents. Some 1.2million persons may be within Boston's boundaries during work hours, {{and as many as}} 2million during special events. This fluctuation of people is caused by hundreds of thousands of suburban residents who travel to the city for work, education, health care, and special events.|$|E

5|$|The Sturmabteilung (SA; Storm Detachment; Brownshirts), {{founded in}} 1921, {{was the first}} {{paramilitary}} wing of the Nazi Party and their initial assignment was to protect Nazi leaders at rallies and assemblies. They also took part in street battles {{against the forces of}} rival political parties and violent actions against Jews and others. By 1934, under Ernst Röhm's leadership the SA had grown to <b>over</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> million members—4.5 million including reserves—at a time when the regular army was still limited to 100,000 men by the Versailles Treaty.|$|E
5|$|The guide's list of {{subscribers}} was {{topped by}} George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and Edmund Randolph {{when the first}} edition appeared in print in 1795. The book proved very popular and remained a staple manual for millers for <b>over</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> century, undergoing several revisions and fifteen printed editions between 1795 and 1860. The book's popularity rested on its detailed practical explanations of mill design and construction, and as the principal guidebook for American milling {{it would not be}} superseded until after the Civil War.|$|E
5|$|William Thomas Beckford {{bought a}} house in Lansdown Crescent in 1822, {{eventually}} buying a further two houses in the crescent to form his residence.

5|$|A {{doctoral}} student of Curie, Marguerite Perey, {{became the first}} woman elected to membership in the Academy– <b>over</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> century later, in 1962. Despite Curie's fame as a scientist working for France, the public's attitude tended toward xenophobia—the same that had led to the Dreyfus affair–which also fueled false speculation that Curie was Jewish. During the French Academy of Sciences elections, she was vilified by the right wing press who criticised her for being a foreigner and an atheist. Her daughter later remarked on the public hypocrisy as the French press often portrayed Curie as an unworthy foreigner when she was nominated for a French honour, but would portray her as a French hero when she received a foreign one such as her Nobel Prizes.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{theories}} prevailing at the time, light traveling through a moving medium would be dragged {{along by the}} medium, so that the measured speed of the light would be a simple sum of its speed through the medium plus {{the speed of the}} medium. Fizeau indeed detected a dragging effect, but the magnitude of the effect that he observed was far lower than expected. His results seemingly supported the partial aether-drag hypothesis of Fresnel, a situation that was disconcerting to most physicists. <b>Over</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> century passed before a satisfactory explanation of Fizeau's unexpected measurement was developed with the advent of Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity. Einstein later pointed out the importance of the experiment for special relativity, in which it corresponds to the relativistic velocity-addition formula when restricted to small velocities.|$|E
5|$|By 1895 Venezuela had had {{a dispute}} with the United Kingdom about the {{territory}} of Guayana Esequiba, which Britain claimed as part of British Guiana and Venezuela saw as Venezuelan territory, for <b>over</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> century. The territorial claims were originally those of the Spanish Empire (inherited by Venezuela after its independence in 1830) and of the Dutch Empire (inherited by the United Kingdom with the acquisition of the Dutch territories of Essequibo, Demerara and Berbice in 1814), having remained unsettled over previous centuries. Over {{the course of the}} nineteenth century the British and Venezuelans had proved no more able to reach an agreement, until matters came to a head in 1895, after seven years of severed diplomatic relations.|$|E
