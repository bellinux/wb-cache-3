40|$|This thesis {{describes}} an actuarial {{structure for the}} practical analysis of motor insurance premium rating. An underlying theme emphasises that judgements are being made taking into account many factors e. g. economical, statistical and technical, therefore {{it is necessary to}} bring into the decision process a group of interested persons. In addition even though data are used to explain the proposed methods, it is the framework which is important and not the omission of some of the data e. g. important rating factors. The basis for premium projecting is discussed together with a critical discussion of various measures of surplus. A new measure is developed referred to as 'proposed to existing' which measures the effect of premium adjustments after taking into account the portfolio distribution. Another theme is to encourage a detailed within-portfolio analysis. An example, using data supplied by an Insurance Company helps to highlight the structure. The analysis commences by sub-dividing the data into important underwriting rating factors. The claim experience is further divided by claim proportions and the three main types of claims cost: accidental damage, third party property damage and third party bodily injury. By sub-dividing the data into multiway cells both exposure and claim numbers become very small, hence statistical modelling is used to smooth the data and to reduce variation. A critical review of past models in respect of claim proportions and accidental damage costs is made. In addition a pragmatic approach to third party bodily injury is carried out. To obtain an <b>office</b> <b>premium</b> the modelled claim experience is combined with economic factors such as inflation and expenses. Details of fitting the additive model by Orthogonal Weighted Least Squares is described. This converts the <b>office</b> <b>premium</b> into a 'points table'. An advantage of this 'points table' is that {{it can be used to}} compare various different sets of assumptions. A brief reference to the competitive market position is then made. An analysis of surplus is developed together with a worked example, which highlights the importance of claim proportions and the level of claims cost. Finally, the last chapter gives a summary of further research work which has been indicated as this thesis has developed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Mini-open {{carpal tunnel}} release has become {{increasingly}} popular {{for the treatment of}} carpal tunnel surgery. The main advantages are shortening recovery time and return-to-work time. However, the risk of neurovascular injury still remains worrisome. Methods In this study, we developed a new retractor (herein called the PSU retractor) modified from the widely used Senn retractor, with the aim of decreasing the risk of neurovascular problems from normal procedure. 3 -Dimensional computer design software (SolidWorks ® <b>Office</b> <b>Premium</b> 2007 SP 3. 1) was used to construct a 3 -D PSU retractor prototype. An amputated arm from a 30 -year-old woman diagnosed as synovial sarcoma at the shoulder was used to test the maximal visual length. A mini-surgical incision was performed at 3 cm distal to the transverse wrist crease and a tiny flexible ruler was inserted through the tunnel beneath the skin to measure the maximal visual length. Results Our new retractor showed significantly better maximal visual length compared to the Senn retractor (47. 7 (8. 1) mm vs. 39. 2 (6. 5) mm). In addition, most assessors expressed a higher satisfaction rate with the PSU retractor than with the Senn retractor (7. 3 (1. 9) vs. 6. 3 (1. 1)). Conclusion In conclusion, we have developed a promising new retractor using a computer design program, which appears to be an improvement on the currently available equipment used for mini-open carpal tunnel surgery. However, further clinical studies are needed to confirm our initial findings. </p...|$|E

Recent research, however, has shown market-responsiveness well beyond one-half mile. We contribute to this literature by evaluating the distance-decay function of office rents in metropolitan Dallas and Denver with respect to light rail transit (LRT) station distance. Using a quadratic transformation of distance we find <b>office</b> rent <b>premiums</b> extending {{in the range of}} two miles away from LRT stations with half the premium dissipating at about two-thirds on one mile and three quarters dissipating at about one mile.

40|$|A {{number of}} studies have {{concluded}} that recent rail transit investments have impacted the form and land use character of American cities far less than their counterparts a century or so ago. This study compares a number of measures of market performance between office submarkets located at selected rail transit stations in Washington, DC and Atlanta, with otherwise similar office submarkets lacking transit service. Comparisons are made over the period between 1978 and 1989. Although there were notable exceptions, the research finds that office projects located at or near transit stations enjoyed a slight <b>office</b> rent <b>premium</b> over their freeway-oriented competitors. In addition, office projects near rail stations tended to be slightly larger, and lease up somewhat more rapidly than office projects at the nonrail control sites. Other comparisons of office market performance tended to be more equivocal. These results suggest that although rail transit service does generate some benefits for the owners of commercial properties near transit stations, such benefits tend to be quite small. ...|$|R

5|$|Before the First World War, {{having seen}} the cavalry feats of mounted Boers during the Second Boer War, Britain {{increased}} its cavalry reserves. Smaller Cleveland Bays were used to carry British troopers, and larger members of the breed pulled artillery; the British War <b>Office</b> offered <b>premiums</b> on Cleveland Bay stallions. Although the First World War was not the cavalry war the British expected, large numbers of horses were used to pull artillery and losses were high. Because the war caused a depletion in stock, in 1920 and 1921, the British society opened a special register for previously unregistered mares of Cleveland Bay type, including some already registered with the Yorkshire Coach Horse (a Cleveland/Thoroughbred cross) registry, after they had passed an inspection that certified them to be of proper breed type. The subsequent foals of these mares were eligible for registration into the main British Cleveland Bay stud book, and were also eligible to compete in competitions reserved for breed members. Some of this progeny was bred and owned by King George V.|$|R

The secondary data obtained from the 2014 and 2015 published financials of the selected ten companies were used to determine the Reinsurance Ceded Ratio (RCR), Return on Asset (ROA), Return on Equity (ROE) as well as the Ratio of Reinsurance Recoverables to Policyholders Surplus (RRPHS). A descriptive research design was employed. The sampling technique adopted was purposive in nature. The study population comprises 56 insurance companies in Nigeria. More so, data collected was analysed using correlation analytical method. The results of this study are quite in line with previous studies and show that reinsurance purchase increases significantly the insurers’ premium income. It is also shown that profitability of the firm is sensitive to change in reinsurance utilisation and has a positive relationship with it. It was established in the study that purchasing reinsurance reduces insurers’ insolvency risk by stabilizing loss experience and increasing capacity. Recommendations were made...|$|R
