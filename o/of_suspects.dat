5|$|A number <b>of</b> <b>suspects</b> {{were arrested}} by the RUC in early August 1975. One of these men, Lance-Corporal Thomas Raymond Crozier (aged 25, a {{painting}} contractor from Lurgan) of C Company, 11th Battalion UDR was charged with the Miami killings.

5|$|A harsh anti-union clampdown {{followed}} the Haymarket incident. There {{was a massive}} outpouring of community and business support for the police and many thousands of dollars were donated to funds for their medical care and to assist their efforts. The entire labor and immigrant community, particularly Germans and Bohemians, came under suspicion. Police raids were carried out on homes and offices of suspected anarchists. Scores <b>of</b> <b>suspects,</b> many only remotely related to the Haymarket affair, were arrested. Casting legal requirements such as search warrants aside, Chicago police squads subjected the labor activists of Chicago to an eight-week shakedown, ransacking their meeting halls and places of business. The emphasis was on the speakers at the Haymarket rally and the newspaper Arbeiter-Zeitung. A small group of anarchists were discovered to {{have been engaged in}} making bombs on the same day as the incident, including round ones like the one used in Haymarket Square.|$|E
5|$|Exton {{submitted}} {{his report}} to Madeleine's Fund in November 2008, but the fund told Exton {{that the report}} and its e-fits had to remain confidential. The relationship between {{the company and the}} fund had soured, in part because of a dispute over fees, and in part because the report was critical of the McCanns and their friends; it suggested that Madeleine may have died in an accident after leaving the apartment herself through its unlocked patio doors. The fund passed the e-fits to the police—the Polícia Judiciária and Leicestershire police had them by October 2009, and Scotland Yard received them when they became involved in August 2011—but did not otherwise release them. Kate McCann did not include them with the other images <b>of</b> <b>suspects</b> in her book, Madeleine (2011), although she suggested that both the Tanner and Smith sightings were crucial.|$|E
5|$|In November, Elizabeth Kloepfer, {{having read}} that young women were now disappearing in towns {{surrounding}} Salt Lake City, called King County police a second time. Detective Randy Hergesheimer of the Major Crimes division interviewed her in detail. By then, Bundy had risen considerably on the King County hierarchy of suspicion, but the Lake Sammamish witness considered most reliable by detectives failed to identify {{him from a}} photo lineup. In December, Kloepfer called the Salt Lake County Sheriff's Office and repeated her suspicions. Bundy's name was added to their list <b>of</b> <b>suspects,</b> {{but at that time}} no credible evidence linked him to the Utah crimes. In January 1975 Bundy returned to Seattle after his final exams and spent a week with Kloepfer, who did not tell him that she had reported him to police on three separate occasions. She made plans to visit him in Salt Lake City in August.|$|E

5|$|In its secret negotiations, the Committee of Public Safety was {{initially}} unable {{to form a}} consensus concerning the jailed deputies, but as some Girondins fled to the provinces and attempted to incite an insurrection, its opinion hardened. By early July, Saint-Just was able to address the Convention with a lengthy report {{in the name of}} the Committee, and his damning attack left no room for any further conciliation. The Girondins' trials must proceed, he said, and any verdicts must be severe. The proceedings dragged on for months, but Brissot and twenty of his allies were eventually condemned and sent to the guillotine on 31 October 1793. Saint-Just used their situation to gain approval for intimidating new laws, culminating in the Law <b>of</b> <b>Suspects</b> (17 September 1793) which gave the Committee vast new powers of arrest and punishment.|$|E
5|$|Coon {{decides to}} rid the town of Mysterion, enlisting the help of Professor Chaos (Butters) and his sidekick General Disarray (Dougie). Unlike the Coon, Professor Chaos and General Disarray have become as {{familiar}} to the residents of South Park as Mysterion. Butters also wants to know the identity of Mysterion but can only narrow the list <b>of</b> <b>suspects</b> to the boys from Mr. Garrison's 4th grade class whose shapes do not differ greatly from that of others. In contrast, he has nearly pinned down Coon's identity to a few fat celebrities, and Cartman. In a scheme to uncover Mysterion's identity, the Coon convinces Professor Chaos to threaten {{the destruction of a}} hospital unless Mysterion reveals his identity. After the Coon plants the TNT and leaves to buy detonators, Mysterion unexpectedly arrives. He points out that this is not Professor Chaos' usual style, and fights Professor Chaos and General Disarray on top of the building. A crowd forms below and cheers on Mysterion as the police take no actions, believing that their bullets are no match for Professor Chaos' aluminum foil armor. Dramatically, the Coon appears to fight on the side of Mysterion, with the hopes that he too will be hailed as a hero. At that point, Professor Chaos and General Disarray run off in defeat. After their victory, the Coon convinces Mysterion to unmask himself by claiming such threats to public safety will continue until Mysterion's secret is revealed.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the most}} well known ACLU successes came in the 1960s, when the ACLU prevailed {{in a string of}} cases {{limiting}} the power of police to gather evidence; in 1961's Mapp v. Ohio, the Supreme court required states to obtain a warrant before searching a person's home. The Gideon v. Wainwright decision in 1963 provided legal representation to indigents. In 1964, the ACLU persuaded the Court, in Escobedo v. Illinois, to permit suspects to have an attorney present during questioning. And, in 1966, Miranda v. Arizona federal decision required police to notify suspects of their constitutional rights, which was later extended to juveniles in the following year's in re Gault (1967) federal ruling. Although many law enforcement officials criticized the ACLU for expanding the rights <b>of</b> <b>suspects,</b> police officers themselves took advantage of the ACLU. For example, when the ACLU represented New York City policemen in their lawsuit which objected to searches of their workplace lockers. In the late 1960s, civilian review boards in New York City and Philadelphia were abolished, over the ACLU's objection.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} reports reveal the numbers <b>of</b> <b>suspects</b> arrested in Brazil and the {{different}} techniques used to torture suspects {{during the process of}} interrogation. A report written in April 16, 1973 to the U.S. Department of State titled “Widespread Arrests And Psychophysical Interrogation Of Suspected Subversive” gave specific details that accounted for what happened in Brazil. According to the report, there had been dramatically increased in arrests in 1973, with a specific week period. The majority <b>of</b> <b>suspects</b> were university students. These students were arrested within several week period in the Rio area. When arrested and interrogated, the suspects were “submitted to the old methods of physical violence, which sometimes cause death.” The increased in number <b>of</b> <b>suspects</b> stemmed from police report, especially on individual who were jailed before.|$|E
