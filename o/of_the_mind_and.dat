5|$|Fodor {{also has}} {{positive}} arguments {{in favour of}} the reality of mental representations in terms of the LOT. He maintains that if language is the expression of thoughts and language is systematic, then thoughts must also be systematic. Fodor draws on the work of Noam Chomsky to both model his theory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>and</b> to refute alternative architectures such as connectionism. Systematicity in natural languages was explained by Chomsky in terms of two more basic concepts: productivity and compositionality.|$|E
5|$|Scully and Doggett consult Chuck Burks, an {{old friend}} of Fox Mulder's, who tells the two that Siddhi mystics could do the things Scully described; the mystics have powers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>and</b> can alter people’s {{perceptions}} of reality. Scully theorizes that a mystic is acting out of revenge since an American plant inadvertently released a gas cloud that killed 118 people in Vishi, outside of Mumbai. One of the victims was the 11-year-old son of a holy man of the beggar caste.|$|E

5|$|Dhumavati is the {{primordial}} darkness and ignorance, from which rises {{the world of}} illusion. She represents the darkness/ignorance before creation and after decay. This ignorance, which obscures the ultimate reality, is necessary because without the realization of this ignorance, true knowledge can not be achieved. Dhumavati also represents yogic sleep (Yoganidra), the pre-creation state of consciousness, {{as well as the}} primal sleep (the Void) in which all creation would dissolve and reach ultimate reality of Brahman. This void is pure consciousness, the cessation of movements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind,</b> <b>and</b> silence. Even Dhumavati's ability to spread disease is also considered positive, as disease punishes the wicked and restores cosmic order. Dhumavati is also associated with the heart or middle region of the body.|$|E

Phrenologists also laid stress on the modularity of mind.|$|E
