40|$|Graduation date: 1970 In situ {{light and}} dark planktonic and benthal respirometers were {{used to measure the}} oxygen {{requirements}} of Yaquina estuary water and benthal deposits. Respirometer devices were constructed so that actual conditions of mixing could be simulated and benthal deposit disturbance would be minimized. A mathematical model of a benthal respirometer was developed and was used to make corrections for respirometer leakage and to conduct oxygen transfer parameter sensitivity studies. The effect of mixing on benthal <b>oxygen</b> <b>uptake</b> was studied by varying the simulated mixing velocities. Studies were made {{to determine the effects of}} scour of bottom material on the salinity of the respirometer water and on the benthal <b>oxygen</b> <b>uptake</b> <b>rates.</b> Plots of various parameters such as benthal <b>oxygen</b> <b>uptake</b> versus dissolved <b>oxygen</b> concentration and respirometer leakage versus time were made to attempt to evaluate relationships that may exist...|$|R
40|$|Domestic {{waste water}} from toilets, showers, garbage grinding, and kitchens was {{characterized}} {{in terms of}} waste concentration and volume in order to formulate four representative synthetic domestic wastes. The synthetic waste formulations were used to simulate concentrated domestic wastes flowing from dwellings whose water use has been reduced {{by the use of}} water saving devices such as low flow toilets and showers. Biological treatment of wastes with Chemical Oxygen Demands (COD) of up to 1500 mg/ 1 using activated sludge was investigated with both bench scale batch and continuous processes. Specific items investigated as functions of waste concentration included substrate removal <b>rates,</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>uptake</b> <b>rates,</b> aeration properties, sludge settling, sludge aeration time, and aeration tank turbulence. Substrate removal rates were not enhanced by increasing domestic waste concentrations although <b>oxygen</b> <b>uptake</b> <b>rates</b> did increase slightly due to possible differences in sludge yield. The minimum sludge aeration time was found to be between 12 and 16 hours per day. Increasing mixing intensity in the aeration tanks reduced sludge settling ability without significantly improving the substrate removal rate. Aeration properties of systems treating wastes at 1500 mg/ 1 COD were found to be inferior to those of systems treating wastes at 750 and 250 mg/ 1 COD. No significant differences were observed between systems treating 250 and 750 mg/I COD wastes. Results indicate that reducing the flow of water from domestic residences reduces treatment costs only so far as that afforded by the reduction in clarifier size and pumping costs...|$|R
40|$|The {{metabolic}} phenotype {{of cancer}} cells is {{reflected by the}} metabolites they consume and by the byproducts they release. Here, we use quantitative, extracellular metabolomic data of the NCI- 60 panel and a novel computational method to generate 120 condition-specific cancer cell line metabolic models. These condition-specific cancer models used distinct metabolic strategies to generate energy and cofactors. The analysis of the models' capability to deal with environmental perturbations revealed three oxotypes, differing {{in the range of}} allowable <b>oxygen</b> <b>uptake</b> <b>rates.</b> Interestingly, models based on metabolomic profiles of melanoma cells were distinguished from other models through their low <b>oxygen</b> <b>uptake</b> <b>rates,</b> which were associated with a glycolytic phenotype. A subset of the melanoma cell models required reductive carboxylation. The analysis of protein and RNA expression levels from the Human Protein Atlas showed that IDH 2, which was an essential gene in the melanoma models, but not IDH 1 protein, was detected in normal skin cell types and melanoma. Moreover, the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL) protein, whose loss is associated with non-hypoxic HIF-stabilization, reductive carboxylation, and promotion of glycolysis, was uniformly absent in melanoma. Thus, the experimental data supported the predicted role of IDH 2 and the absence of VHL protein supported the glycolytic and low oxygen phenotype predicted for melanoma. Taken together, our approach of integrating extracellular metabolomic data with metabolic modeling and the combination of different network interrogation methods allowed insights into the metabolism of cells...|$|R
