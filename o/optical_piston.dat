5000|$|However, {{similar to}} a real engine piston {{moving up and down}} in its cylinder, <b>optical</b> <b>piston</b> values can be changed to bias the {{wavefront}} phase mean value as desired. As phase values can only vary from zero to 2π, then repeat in either direction (termed phase wrapping), changing the piston coefficient changes the zero phase value contour locations across the wavefront. This property is critical to the operation of phase-measuring interferometers, which give not only the magnitude but also the sign ( [...] or [...] ) of a wavefront under test. Piston is physically created in the interferometer by piezoelectric actuators that translate the Fizeau interferometer reference surface along the optical axis by precise fractions of the test wavelength, usually by one quarter of a wavelength. This changes the interferometric fringe patterns and allows direct calculation of the exact wavefront error.|$|E

The system is composed of three sub-systems: a CGH-based optical test tower, delivering a 1. 5 -m collimated beam, for fast simultaneous acquisition of large areas; a stitching interferometer, to calibrate at higher spatial frequencies, on smaller areas; and an <b>optical</b> <b>piston</b> sensor to remove differential piston and tilt between adjacent mirror segments.

We evaluate precisely the energy balance of the crossover. We show that the deformation of the optical potentials induced by the compression of the piston is related to a production of heat which measures the non-adiabatic character of the crossover. This reveals how specific thermodynamic processes can be designed and controlled {{with a high level}} of precision by tailoring the optical landscapes of the piston.

Cophasing implies precise, active control of three degrees of freedom of each individual segment mirror: translation along the <b>optical</b> axis (<b>piston)</b> and rotation about two axes perpendicular to the optical axis (tip-tilt).|$|R

Upon the release from the substrate, the actuators lift off the substrate due to a large built-in bending moment arising from the compressive residual stress in the poly-silicon layer and tensile residual stress in the metal layer.

50|$|Piston and tilt are not {{actually}} true optical aberrations, {{as they do}} not represent or model curvature in the wavefront. Defocus is the lowest order true <b>optical</b> aberration.

40|$|Partially {{premixed}} combustion (PPC) {{is used to}} {{meet the}} increasing demands of emission legislation and to improve fuel efficiency. With gasoline fuels, PPC {{has the advantage of}} a longer premixed duration of the fuel/air mixture, which prevents soot formation. In addition, the overall combustion stability can be increased with a longer ignition delay, providing proper fuel injection strategies. In this work, the effects of multiple injections on the generation of in-cylinder turbulence at a single swirl ratio are investigated. High-speed particle image velocimetry (PIV) is conducted in an optical direct-injection (DI) engine to obtain the turbulence structure during fired conditions. Primary reference fuel (PRF) 70 (30 % n-heptane and 70 % iso-octane) is used as the PPC fuel. In order to maintain the in-cylinder flow as similarly as possible to the flow that would exist in a production engine, the quartz piston retains a realistic bowl geometry. The distortion caused by the complex shape of the <b>optical</b> <b>piston</b> is corrected by an advanced image-dewarping algorithm. The in-cylinder charge motion is evaluated and investigated over a range of crank angles in the compression and expansion strokes {{in order to understand the}} turbulence level, especially the late-cycle turbulence. The results show the spatial and temporal development of the flow-field structures in the piston bowl. The PIV data, obtained in the vertical plan, are used to calculate the ensemble average velocity turbulent kinetic energy (TKE), cycle-resolved turbulence, and mean velocity of the instantaneous fluid motion...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a laser induced fluorescence (LIF) technique to quantify the thickness and spatial distribution of transient liquid fuel films formed as a result of spray–wall interaction. The LIF technique relies on the principle that upon excitation by laser radiation the intensity of the fluorescent signal from a tracer like 3 -pentanone is proportional to the film thickness. A binary solution of 10 % (v/v) of 3 -pentanone in iso-octane is used as a test fuel with a Nd:YAG laser as the excitation light source (utilising the fourth harmonic at wavelength 266 nm) and an intensified CCD camera is used to record the results as fluorescent images. The propagation of the excitation laser beam through the <b>optical</b> <b>piston</b> is carefully controlled by total internal reflection so that only the fuel film is excited and not the airborne droplets above the film, which had been previously shown to induce significant error. Other known sources of error are also carefully minimised. Calibrated temporally resolved benchmark results of a transient spray from a gasoline direct injector impinging on a flat quartz crown under atmospheric conditions are presented, with observations and discussion of the transient development of the fuel film. The calibrated measurements are consistent with previous studies of this event and demonstrate the applicability of the technique particularly for appraisal of CFD predictions. The potential utilisation of the technique under typical elevated ambient conditions is commented upon...|$|E
40|$|Future {{automotive}} fuels {{are expected}} to contain significant quantities of bio-components. This poses a great challenge to the designers of novel low-CO 2 internal combustion engines because biofuels have very different properties to those of most typical hydrocarbons. The current article presents results of firing a direct-injection spark-ignition optical research engine on ethanol and butanol and comparing those to data obtained with gasoline and iso-octane. A multihole injector, located centrally in the combustion chamber, was used with all fuels. Methane was also employed by injecting it into the inlet plenum to provide a benchmark case for well-mixed “homogeneous” charge preparation. The study covered stoichiometric and lean mixtures (λ = 1. 0 and λ = 1. 2), various spark advances (30 – 50 ° CA), a range of engine temperatures (20 – 90 °C), and diverse injection strategies (single and “split” triple). In-cylinder gas sampling at the spark-plug location and at a location on the pent-roof wall was also carried out using a fast flame ionization detector to measure the equivalence ratio of the in-cylinder charge and identify the degree of stratification. Combustion imaging was performed through a full-bore <b>optical</b> <b>piston</b> to study the effect of injection strategy on late burning associated with fuel spray wall impingement. Combustion with single injection was fastest for ethanol throughout 20 – 90 °C, but butanol and methane were just as fast at 90 °C; iso-octane was the slowest and gasoline was between iso-octane and the alcohols. At 20 °C, λ at the spark plug location was 0. 96 – 1. 09, with gasoline exhibiting the largest and iso-octane the lowest value. Ethanol showed the lowest degree of stratification and butanol the largest. At 90 °C, stratification was lower for most fuels, with butanol showing the largest effect. The work output with triple injection was marginally higher for the alcohols and lower for iso-octane and gasoline (than with single injection), but combustion stability was worse for all fuels. Triple injection produced a lower degree of stratification, with leaner λ at the spark plug than single injection. Combustion imaging showed much less luminous late burning with tripe injection. In terms of combustion stability, the alcohols were more robust to changes in fueling (λ = 1. 2) than the liquid hydrocarbons...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Paper {{deals with}} {{examinations}} of properties of {{shape memory alloy}} actuators. Authors describe design of own laboratory stand for obtaining electro-thermo-mecha-nical characteristics of SMA wires (maximum length 900 mm). The stand allows for semi-automatic measurements of voltage and current (supplying the actuator), tem-perature of wire and its extension. Data acquisition and control signals are realized by PC computer. All elements of the measuring system are connected by GPIB network (IEEE 488. 2 standard). Control program for static measurements was written in G language (LabVIEW environment). Temperature is measured using infrared camera Flir A 325. Displacement measurement system contains <b>optical</b> sensor (converting <b>piston</b> movement into series of pulses), pulses counter, PWM signal generator (PWM signal fulfillment is proportional to number of pulses), lowpass filter and buffer conditioning external signal. For dynamic measurements data recording is performed using digital oscilloscope Tektronix MSO 2024 equipped with four separated channels and digital filter. Wide range of examinations of several SMA wires allowed for drawing its exploitative charac-teristic helpful for practical use.

40|$|The high angular {{resolution}} technique of non-redundant masking (NRM) or aperture masking in-terferometry (AMI) has yielded images of faint protoplanetary companions of nearby stars from the ground. AMI on James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) ’s Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectro-graph (NIRISS) {{has a lower}} thermal background than ground-based facilites and does not suffer from atmospheric instability. NIRISS AMI images {{are likely to have}} 90 - 95 % Strehl ratio between 2. 77 and 4. 8 µm. In this paper we quantify factors that limit the raw point source contrast of JWST NRM. We develop an analytic model of the NRM point spread function which includes different <b>optical</b> path delays (<b>pistons)</b> between mask holes and fit the model parameters with image plane data. It enables a straightforward way to exclude bad pixels, is suited to limited fields of view, and can incorporate effects such as intra-pixel sensitivity variations. We simulate various sources of noise to estimate their effect on the standard deviation of closure phase, σCP (a proxy for binary point source contrast). If σCP < 10 − 4 radians — a contrast ratio of 10 magnitudes — young accreting gas giant planets (e. g., in the nearby Taurus star-forming region) could be imaged with JWST NIRISS.

40|$|An {{embedded}} fiber Bragg grating {{was used}} to examine the operating temperature of a small gasoline engine <b>piston.</b> <b>Optical</b> system analyses were conducted to enhance the accuracy and consistency of the measured piston temperature. The goal of the work was to experimentally characterize light transmission through embedded fibers, with the aim of improving the entire measurement system to acquire data as the engine was running. An aspheric collimating lens and a polyimide-buffered fiber Bragg grating were found to create a transmission profile with a much more noticeable Bragg dip, and the optical system was more tolerant to misalignment while maintaining measurement accuracy. A wavelength-agile VCSEL diode laser provided a low-cost means to interrogate the embedded fiber Bragg grating at speeds up to 100 kHz, albeit for a small wavelength domain. Stationary engine measurements successfully determined the piston temperature to be 31. 5 �C. However, irreparable damage was caused to the engine when a small piece of electroplated nickel became loose and wedged between the piston and cylinder wall shortly after initiating motored tests. After verifying the integrity of the embedded FBG, the cylinder was rebored and the piston reinstalled. A modified motoring experiment proved that light coupling was occurring for each engine rotation, and analysis determined the piston temperature to be approximately 56 �C. Due to substantial noise in the photodetector data, it was difficult to qualitatively identify the Bragg wavelength without making assumptions about the expected Bragg dip location...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} ten year the {{mechanical}} power output of car engine increased significantly. This result has been possible especially through new injection systems that brought to an optimization of the combustion (direct injection, common rail) and to an improvement of the turbo charging. Moreover, these technical devices brought to a reduction of the exhaust emissions and an increasing of the engine efficiency. In particular, the specific power is increased from 34 kW/litre of the 1992 to the 63 kW/litre of the 2010. Furthermore, the pressure peaks into the combustion chamber and the fuel injection pressure have been increased to the aim of emission reduction and higher engine efficiency. In this scenario, car manufacturers are following {{the direction of the}} engine downsizing that means to have the same engine power by a lower engine displacement. The downsizing has as main consequence a thermal risks specially for the hot parts of the combustion chamber (exhaust valves, spark plug body and piston) because these parts have an increased high heat load and thermal stress. These temperatures could have as main consequence to the risk for engine damage by irregular combustion due to "surface ignition" by hot spot or by deposit of the combustion chamber. In this paper a method for <b>optical</b> measurement of <b>piston</b> temperature during the fired and unfired operation of an internal combustion engine has been developed. An optical access to the combustion chamber is achieved by an optical element made from sapphire lens that can be located in a special spark plug or other engine parts (injectors, cylinder head). The thermal radiation of the piston observed with this optical element is guided to the detector with optical fibers. As a detector InGaAs-photodiodes are used, which allow a detection of the infrared radiation up to 2. 6 μm. The relation between the signal intensity and piston temperature was determined outside the engine in a calibration unit: the piston was heated up to 400 °C. In the calibration unit the sensor and the piston are arranged in the same geometry as in the combustion chamber. During cool down the thermal radiation is simultaneously measured with the temperature of the piston surface, obtained from a thermocouple. AVL uses optical sensors in spark plugs to investigate combustion phenomena in spark ignited internal combustion engines. In a recent application the measurement of valve temperatures has been demonstrated using these sensors. In this paper the possibility to measure piston temperatures with this measurement system is investigated. For this purpose following tasks have been performed: The measurement range was extended from 400 ° down to 200 ° by selecting appropriate optical materials and detectors. A calibration unit was developed to determine the relation between radiation signal and piston temperature. The piston temperature was measured for different pistons in a single cylinder research engine...|$|R
