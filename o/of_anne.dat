5|$|However, the {{reassessment}} of James {{in the past}} two decades, as an able ruler who extended royal power in Scotland and preserved his kingdoms from war throughout his reign, has been accompanied by a re-evaluation <b>of</b> <b>Anne</b> as an influential political figure and assertive mother, at least {{for as long as the}} royal marriage remained a reality. John Leeds Barroll argues in his cultural biography <b>of</b> <b>Anne</b> that her political interventions in Scotland were more significant, and certainly more troublesome, than previously noticed; and Clare McManus, among other cultural historians, has highlighted Anne's influential role in the Jacobean cultural flowering, not only as a patron of writers and artists but as a performer herself.|$|E
