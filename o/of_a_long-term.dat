5|$|By {{the time}} the AirTrain case appeal was decided in October 2000, two-thirds of the system's viaduct {{structures}} had been constructed already. The system was ready for its first test trains by December 2000. The state spent $75 million to renovate the Howard Beach station, which brought it into ADA compliance and facilitated passengers' transfers {{to and from the}} AirTrain. The new Howard Beach station was completed in May 2001. The Port Authority also contributed $100 million toward the renovation of the Jamaica LIRR station, with the State of New York paying {{for the rest of the}} $387 million project. The purpose of this renovation was, in part, to facilitate AirTrain connections. The renovation of the Jamaica station started in May 2001 upon the completion of the Howard Beach station. By this time, the system's guideway rails were complete and the guideways were being constructed. The first two AirTrain cars were delivered in March 2001 and were undergoing testing at the AirTrain maintenance facility near Lefferts Boulevard. The guideways were completed in August 2001. However, a parking structure, proposed near the Jamaica terminal as part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>long-term</b> plan to redevelop downtown Jamaica, was largely unfunded by 2002, the year the AirTrain was originally supposed to open.|$|E
