40|$|To date barely any {{research}} has investigated {{the influence of}} <b>important</b> <b>others</b> on performance in pressure situations. It was hypothesized that <b>important</b> <b>others</b> can induce choking and facilitation depending on timing. Facilitation was expected when names of <b>important</b> <b>others</b> were primed before skill execution, whereas choking was expected when primed during skill execution. Two experiments were performed to test the hypotheses, using an arithmetic problem solving and a basketball shooting task. While <b>important</b> <b>others</b> were previously thought to facilitate performance, the present research suggests that they can also distract, and thereby harm performance. Moreover, a facilitating effect of close <b>important</b> <b>others</b> was found when individual differences are considered. The mechanism that is proposed is that <b>important</b> <b>others</b> induce distracting goal-directed behaviour, instead of task-directed behaviour.
