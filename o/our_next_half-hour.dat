6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} be,--for the <b>next</b> <b>half-hour.</b> T' postman he bain't stirred from t' ale'us yet. Just {{put it into}} t' box wull ye?" ...|$|R
60|$|And {{she became}} as mute as Anne for the <b>next</b> <b>half-hour,</b> nor did either Raymond or his mother venture on {{starting}} any fresh topic, lest {{there might be}} fresh jarring.|$|R
60|$|Jean {{was both}} right and wrong, for two persons wanted in within the <b>next</b> <b>half-hour,</b> and {{she opened the}} door to both of them. The first to come was Babbie.|$|R
50|$|This round {{was played}} {{in the same way}} as Round 1, except the three highest-scoring players won a prize and a chance to play Trivial Pursuit in the <b>next</b> <b>half-hour</b> show.|$|R
6000|$|... "Maybe it {{will let}} {{up in the}} <b>next</b> <b>half-hour</b> or so," [...] remarked Jack hopefully. [...] "Then, if we strike out for the turnpike, we'll {{be able to get}} down to the Hall in no time." ...|$|R
60|$|On going {{systematically}} over {{yourself for}} about the twentieth time, you discover it in your waistcoat pocket, and for the <b>next</b> <b>half-hour</b> you sit and wonder how you came to miss it on the previous nineteen occasions.|$|R
6000|$|... "We should {{arrive in}} the <b>next</b> <b>half-hour</b> and I'll confess to a keen curiosity about Cyril Jernyngham. He was an amusing and {{eccentric}} scapegrace when I last saw him, though {{that is a very}} long time ago." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{vouchers}} were produced, {{and for the}} <b>next</b> <b>half-hour</b> Mr Fledgeby concentrated his sublime {{attention on}} them. They and the accounts were all found correct, and the books and the papers resumed their places in the bag.|$|R
60|$|It is {{unnecessary}} to dwell more {{particularly on the}} occurrences at the farm-house. The worthy people did what they could to make us comfortable, {{and we were all}} warm in bed, {{in the course of the}} <b>next</b> <b>half-hour.</b>|$|R
60|$|He shuffled {{forward with}} lowered head, while Blake came behind, helping Harding {{as best he}} could. All three long remembered the <b>next</b> <b>half-hour.</b> Once they lost the trail and were seized with despair, but, searching anxiously, they found it again.|$|R
60|$|Exactly what {{happened}} during the <b>next</b> <b>half-hour</b> I am unable to state of my own knowledge, for I had no sooner entered the horn-works than it became necessary to put forth every effort in the saving of my own life.|$|R
60|$|What {{occurred}} within the inner cell of the Conciergerie prison within the <b>next</b> <b>half-hour</b> of that 16th day of Pluviose {{in the year}} II of the Republic is, perhaps, too well known to history to need or bear overfull repetition.|$|R
60|$|For the <b>next</b> <b>half-hour</b> he exerted himself savagely, {{and when}} at last he dropped the handspike, his face was damp with perspiration. He smiled grimly when Laura, who had hauled {{one or two of}} the logs away, came back tapping the plodding oxen.|$|R
6000|$|Basil grew restless, and Isabel said, with a subtile {{interpretation}} of his uneasiness, [...] "I don't {{want anything to}} eat, Basil, but I think I know the weaknesses of men; and you had better go and pass the <b>next</b> <b>half-hour</b> over a plate of something indigestible." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{clock was}} ticking so mercilessly on. It was long past midnight, {{and even the}} Prince of Wales was {{thinking}} of leaving the supper-table. Within the <b>next</b> <b>half-hour</b> the destinies of two brave men would be pitted against one another--the dearly-beloved brother and he, the unknown hero.|$|R
60|$|The colour {{had come}} back to her cheeks. Indeed, she felt marvellously cheerful now and reassured. She knew that Andor would fulfil his share of the bargain, and the heavy cloud of trouble and of terror would be {{permanently}} lifted from her within the <b>next</b> <b>half-hour.</b>|$|R
60|$|She found {{a splendid}} trout, {{a packet of}} tea, and a little bag of self-raising flour, among other sundries, and for the <b>next</b> <b>half-hour</b> she kept Nasmyth busy making flapjacks and frying the trout. Then they sat down to a simple meal, {{and when it was}} over, Nasmyth laughed.|$|R
60|$|With that hearty commendation, {{her father}} left her, {{to see that}} all was safe, and Abby found that another sort of courage was needed to support her through the <b>next</b> <b>half-hour</b> of trial; for her hands were badly burned, {{and each of the}} {{excellent}} relatives suggested a different remedy.|$|R
60|$|He {{passed the}} <b>next</b> <b>half-hour</b> with Torrance amicably, {{and it was}} not until he was {{returning}} to the hall with Clavering that he found an opportunity of expressing himself freely. Torrance, he realized, was an old man, and quite incapable of regarding the question except from his own point of view.|$|R
60|$|He {{spent the}} <b>next</b> <b>half-hour</b> in issuing invitations, and at half-past three every chair was filled by fellow-strikers. Three cans of beer, clay pipes, and a paper of shag {{stood on the}} table. Mr. Benjamin Todd, an obese, fresh-coloured gentleman of middle age, took the easy-chair. Glasses and teacups were filled.|$|R
60|$|With {{that we all}} plied our paddles {{with our}} utmost might. The chase soon became very exciting. Ere long it became evident that the crews of the two canoes were pretty equally matched, for we did not, apparently, {{diminish}} the distance between us by a single inch during the <b>next</b> <b>half-hour.</b>|$|R
60|$|I {{remarked that}} I {{was sure they}} could, and for the <b>next</b> <b>half-hour</b> talked almost without interruption, keeping nothing back and {{explaining}} that I was anxious {{to find someone who}} would finance an expedition to search for this particular plant; as I believed, the only one of its sort that existed in the world.|$|R
60|$|Wheeler {{could take}} a hint, and he crawled away along the heading, while Nasmyth toiled for the <b>next</b> <b>half-hour</b> strenuously at the machine. The {{perspiration}} dripped from him. He gasped as he ripped the handle around; then he let it go suddenly, and his face became softer as {{he picked up the}} letter again.|$|R
6000|$|... "In the barn, I believe. The working oxen {{have to be}} fed. It's very {{probable}} that you will {{see her in the}} <b>next</b> <b>half-hour.</b> As to your other question--you were very sick indeed--pneumonia. Once or twice it seemed a sure thing that you'd slip through our fingers. Where were you coming from when you struck the clearing?" ...|$|R
60|$|This we {{proceeded}} to do. The plots themselves I forget, but I remember {{that at the}} subsequent judging each man selected his own, and became so indignant at the bitter criticism to which it was subjected by the other two, that he tore it up; and, for the <b>next</b> <b>half-hour,</b> we sat and smoked in silence.|$|R
6000|$|Aunt and niece soon {{drifted away}} from each other in the crowd, and for the <b>next</b> <b>half-hour</b> Clara was hard at work, putting in marks and rubbing them out again, and hunting up and down for {{suitable}} pictures. This she found the hardest part of all. [...] "I can't find the one I want!" [...] she exclaimed at last, almost crying with vexation.|$|R
6000|$|A cry {{of despair}} arose from those still {{on board the}} ill-fated [...] "Trident" [...] when this {{catastrophe}} happened. During the <b>next</b> <b>half-hour</b> the rocket apparatus was plied with great success, but {{although most of the}} women and children were saved by it (and by the boat before it was disabled), there were still upwards of fifty men on board the wreck.|$|R
6000|$|A veil might with profit {{be drawn}} over {{the events of}} the <b>next</b> <b>half-hour.</b> Suffice it to say that no such person as [...] "Inspector Brown" [...] was known to Scotland Yard. The {{photograph}} of Jane Finn, which would have been of the utmost value to the police in tracing her, was lost beyond recovery. Once again [...] "Mr. Brown" [...] had triumphed.|$|R
60|$|At {{them they}} went, and soon had two more fish, but the {{disturbance}} created by these {{had the effect}} of frightening the others. At all events, at their third effort their patience was severely tried, for nothing came to their hooks to reward the intense gaze and the nervous readiness to act which marked each boy during the <b>next</b> <b>half-hour</b> or so.|$|R
60|$|Devine {{admitted}} {{that this might}} be advisable, and Saunders, who was a man of action, took the back trail in the <b>next</b> <b>half-hour.</b> He had held his own in one phase of the conflict which it was evident must be fought before the Grenfell Consolidated could be floated, and it was necessary that somebody should go down to despatch the specimens to Weston.|$|R
60|$|Those other friends, as Don Rodrigo gathered, {{continued}} to arrive for the <b>next</b> <b>half-hour,</b> until {{in the end}} {{there must have been}} some twenty of them assembled in that chamber. The mutter of voices had steadily increased, but so confused that no more than odd words, affording no clue to the reason of this gathering, had reached the hidden couple.|$|R
60|$|I {{longed to}} hear Sir James's observations, but his {{provoking}} opposite neighbour began to talk, and I got {{nothing more to}} myself, and I had to spend the <b>next</b> <b>half-hour</b> in showing <b>our</b> grounds to Mrs. Vernon, who admired {{as if she were}} electioneering, and hindered me from knowing what anybody was about, till the people had had their cups of coffee and their carriages had come.|$|R
25|$|At {{approximately}} 4 p.m. on Sunday, Zavistonovičius armed {{himself with}} a Russian hunting rifle IZH-12 and a Czech carbine ZKK-601 with telescopic sight – both weapons were held legally with permit renewed {{less than a year}} prior to the incident. Within the <b>next</b> <b>half-hour,</b> he went to four houses where he killed nine of his neighbours and their relatives, all of them with single shots to the head or chest.|$|R
50|$|Once {{the second}} circuit was turned off, this caused alarms {{due to high}} power flow. Also the Landesbergen-Wehrendorf line {{was very close to}} its limit. Over the <b>next</b> <b>half-hour,</b> the power first went down but then it crept back up. E.ON Netz thought that closing a bus tie would {{decrease}} this a bit; in fact, it had the opposite effect and once this was performed the line tripped out.|$|R
60|$|Then Jessie rose {{to greet}} her hostess. The {{question}} was decided; {{it was too late}} to replace the letter now. She could not remember what they talked about during the <b>next</b> <b>half-hour,</b> but she took her part until Nairn came in, and contrived to have a word with him before leaving. Mrs. Nairn had gone out to give some instructions about supper and, when Evelyn followed her, Jessie turned to Nairn.|$|R
5|$|After the eulogies, {{the three}} {{speakers}} each laid a wreath at the casket, and the Senate Chaplain, the Reverend Barry Black, gave the benediction. Cheney escorted Nancy Reagan to the casket, where {{she said her}} goodbyes. The dignitaries in the room paid their respects during the <b>next</b> <b>half-hour.</b> In a rare instance, {{the doors of the}} Capitol were then opened to the public, who stood in lines stretching many blocks to view the casket.|$|R
