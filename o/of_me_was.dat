[...] However, {{a few days later}} he found Alkan at Érard's, and Niecks writes of their meeting that [...] "his reception <b>of</b> <b>me</b> <b>was</b> not merely polite but most friendly." ...|$|E
500|$|This episode {{marks the}} final {{appearance}} of series regular Michael Muhney, who plays Don Lamb on the show, after his character is bludgeoned {{to death by}} Steve Botando, played by Richard Grieco. Muhney {{did not know about}} his character's death until receiving the script for the episode. This was roughly six weeks before the episode's airing and during filming. Muhney did not know the rationale for killing the character, but when he found out, he stated that [...] "I felt like a piece <b>of</b> <b>me</b> <b>was</b> dying as well." [...] He also stated that he was also heartbroken because he had grown attached to the character over the course of three years playing him. Muhney also expressed surprise over the writing decision.|$|E

500|$|Perry cites Alanis Morissette and her 1995 album Jagged Little Pill as a {{significant}} musical inspiration, and opted to work with Morissette's frequent collaborator Ballard as a result. Perry stated, [...] "Jagged Little Pill was the most perfect female record ever made. There's a song for anyone on that record; I relate to all those songs. They're still so timeless." [...] Additionally, Perry borrows influence from Flaming Red by Patty Griffin and 10 Cent Wings by Jonatha Brooke. Perry intends to become [...] "more of a Joni Mitchell", releasing folk and acoustic music. Perry's autobiographical documentary Katy Perry: Part <b>of</b> <b>Me</b> <b>was</b> largely influenced by [...] She admires Madonna's ability to reinvent herself, saying [...] "I want to evolve like Madonna", and has credited Madonna for inspiring her to make Prism [...] "darker" [...] than her previous material.|$|E
500|$|Finally, on May 19, Giuliani held what The New York Times again {{described}} as [...] "an emotional, riveting news conference" [...] that [...] "reached {{a new level}} of introspection" [...] to announce that he was dropping out of the senate race: [...] "This is not the right time for me to run for office. If it were six months ago or it were a year from now or the timing were a little different, maybe it would be different. But it isn't different and that's the way life is." [...] He added that, [...] "I used to think the core <b>of</b> <b>me</b> <b>was</b> in politics, probably. It isn't. When you feel your mortality and your humanity you realize that, that the core of you is first of all being {{able to take care of}} your health." [...] He said that he would instead devote the remainder of his mayoralty trying to overcome the hostile relations he had with many of the city's minority groups.|$|E
500|$|Jesse Hassenger of PopMatters {{found the}} finale to be [...] "breathlessly paced". However, the writer was also {{dissatisfied}} with the cliffhanger, and hoped that the second season would not increase the series' focus on Veronica's relationships. Hassenger wrote, [...] "so far, the series has eschewed the relationship angst so common in other teen-centric shows; Neptune hearts get broken, yes, but the show never stoops to that will-they-or-won't-they dynamic. Veronica is that rare television character who's too interesting for love triangles." [...] Filip Vukcevic of IGN thought that while {{the resolution of the}} murder was satisfying, it could have been better; [...] "I liked the way everything played out, but I didn't get the Sixth Sense moment I was hoping for. I wanted the season finale to blow my mind, instead all it got out <b>of</b> <b>me</b> <b>was,</b> 'Ah, I see. That's cool.'" [...] Vukcevic wrote that the pace of the season increased exponentially, and was at its best during the final episode. Both reviewers praised Rob Thomas's use of red herrings. Vukcevic felt that [...] "as the finale approaches you are led to believe that the murderer could be any one of several different people - not any easy thing to pull off convincingly. What makes good TV is audience participation. If you feel for a character or are puzzling out a mystery, you're involved. And when you're involved, you're having a good time." [...] Hassenger cited Lianne, Duncan and Logan as the main red herrings.|$|E

2500|$|After {{extensive}} touring {{in support}} of the band's third studio album, Veckatimest (2009), Grizzly Bear undertook a six-month hiatus from band-related activities. Vocalist Ed Droste noted, [...] "There was such a level of exhaustion that I really needed to pretend I wasn't in the band for a little bit. I needed to be back in my life with my friends and my spouse, and live a day-to-day existence {{that had nothing to do}} with music. That was really good for everybody." [...] Vocalist and guitarist Daniel Rossen stated, [...] "Those were strange times. [...] I felt a little bit shell-shocked by the touring experience of Veckatimest and part <b>of</b> <b>me</b> <b>was</b> just wondering if there was some other version of a life that I could have that wasn't as heavily involved in the music industry." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, Monica's fifth studio album The Makings <b>of</b> <b>Me</b> <b>was</b> released. For the {{production}} of the album, the singer had re-teamed with most of her regular contributors and although the final track listing comprised an outweighing slower set of mid-tempo recording and ballads, J Records settled on [...] "Everytime tha Beat Drop," [...] a heavily snap-influenced up-tempo record which had initially been recorded for a So So Def mixtape, to lead the album — against the grain of the singer, who felt that the song did not speak to her core audience and was a poor representation of the album. Upon its release, The Makings of Me failed to reprise the multi-million sales success of previous albums, barley selling 350,000 copies in the United States, and while it produced four single releases, none of them managed to chart or sell noticeably, garnering Monica her least commercially successful project yet.|$|E

2500|$|Commenting on Wellington's record, Newby-Fraser said, [...] "But {{the revelation}} I had was {{watching}} how hard {{she worked for}} it ... {{and it was clear}} she was going to the well. And I am certain she had to leave a little bit of herself out there to get it done. She didn't take a moment to enjoy until she crossed the line. Part <b>of</b> <b>me</b> <b>was</b> gratified by that. I know what she had to do to get it and I hope she realizes it's not that easy. I know it wasn't that easy for her. A race like that takes a piece of herself out there." [...] A year later her coach Dave Scott revealed that she had an upper hamstring injury and that, [...] "Deep down inside, she had a bit of a struggle in 2009." [...] Even though she had broken the long-standing course record, Scott said, [...] "But I knew, and she knew, and I told her in my ever-candid, callous style, that she didn't have her best day." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cooper's dream {{at the end}} of {{the third}} episode, which became a driving plot point in the series's first season and {{ultimately}} held the key to the identity of Laura's murderer, was never scripted. The idea came to Lynch one afternoon after touching the side of a hot car left out in the sun: [...] "I was leaning against a car—the front <b>of</b> <b>me</b> <b>was</b> leaning against this very warm car. My hands were on the roof and the metal was very hot. The Red Room scene leapt into my mind. 'Little Mike' was there, and he was speaking backwards... For the rest of the night I thought only about The Red Room." [...] The footage was originally shot along with the pilot, to be used as the conclusion were it to be released as a feature film. When the series was picked up, Lynch decided to incorporate some of the footage; in the third episode, Cooper, narrating the dream, outlines the shot footage which Lynch did not incorporate, such as Mike shooting Bob and the fact that he is 25 years older when he meets Laura Palmer's spirit.|$|E
2500|$|On 22 November 2012, it was {{reported}} that Tokyo Broadcasting System (TBS) early morning TV show [...] "Asazuba" [...] accidentally displayed Abe's photo alongside a news report about an NHK announcer's arrest for a sex offense.

Abe posted on his public Facebook page [...] "This morning on the TBS show 'Asazuba,' when a newscaster reported on a story regarding the apprehension of a molester, a photo <b>of</b> <b>me</b> <b>was</b> shown. Images of this blunder can now be seen clearly across the Internet, Have the slander campaigns already begun!? If this were merely an accident, it would be proper for the TV station to give me a personal apology, but as yet I haven't heard a single word." [...] The newscaster acknowledged that the incorrect image had been displayed, but merely stated that the photo was [...] "unrelated" [...] and did not refer to the politician by name. Neither Abe nor his office have received any form of apology.|$|E

[...] Timberlake released a statement saying [...] "I am sorry that anyone was offended by the wardrobe malfunction during the halftime performance of the Super Bowl. It was not intentional and is regrettable." [...] However, Timberlake was not required to film a video apology as Jackson was. Timberlake also addressed the incident at the Grammy Awards the following week, which Jackson was banned from attending after being scheduled as a presenter, saying [...] "I know it's been a rough week on everybody. What occurred was unintentional, completely regrettable and I apologize if you guys are offended." [...] Timberlake gave an additional interview at the Grammy event and stated, [...] "All I could say was, 'Oh, my God. Oh, my God,'" [...] Timberlake said. [...] "I looked at her. They brought a towel up on stage. They covered her up. I was completely embarrassed and just walked off the stage as quickly as I could. I'm frustrated at the whole situation. I'm frustrated that my character is being questioned. And {{the fact of the}} matter is, you know, I've had a good year, a really good year, especially with my music." [...] Timberlake later declared, [...] "It was something that went wrong. Then I felt like, I'm going to show everyone that this was something that didn't affect me, and I'm going to show up at the Grammys." [...] He later said he was unable to attend most of the halftime rehearsals due to being on tour in Spain, having only one day to rehearse. While promoting his sophomore album FutureSex/LoveSounds over two years later, Timberlake expressed regret for his behavior, saying, [...] "In my honest opinion now ... I could've handled it better. ... I'm part of a community that consider themselves artists. And if there was something I could have done in her defense that was more than I realized then, I would have. But the other half <b>of</b> <b>me</b> <b>was</b> like, 'Wow. We still haven't found the weapons of mass destruction and everybody cares about this!'" [...] He added, [...] "I probably got 10 percent of the blame, and that says something about society ... I think that America's harsher on women. And I think that America is, you know, unfairly harsh on ethnic people." ...|$|E
