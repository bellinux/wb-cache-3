5|$|The commonness and {{centrality}} {{of wine in}} daily life in biblical times is apparent from its many positive and negative metaphorical uses throughout the Bible. Positively, for example, wine {{is used as a}} symbol <b>of</b> <b>abundance,</b> and of physical blessing. Negatively, wine is personified as a mocker and beer a brawler, and drinking a cup of strong wine to the dregs and getting drunk are sometimes presented as a symbol of God's judgment and wrath.|$|E
5|$|The {{specific}} epithet oregonense {{derives from}} the name Oregon and the Latin suffix -ense (relating to), in reference to western Oregon being its central region <b>of</b> <b>abundance.</b> The fungus {{is commonly known as}} the Oregon white truffle. Truffle authority James Trappe initially intended to name the species as a variety of Tuber gibbosum (i.e., as Tuber gibbosum var. oregonense) before molecular analysis revealed that genetic differences warranted distinction at the species level.|$|E
5|$|The thrifty gene {{hypothesis}} postulates that, due to dietary scarcity during human evolution, {{people are}} prone to obesity. Their ability {{to take advantage of}} rare periods <b>of</b> <b>abundance</b> by storing energy as fat would be advantageous during times of varying food availability, and individuals with greater adipose reserves {{would be more likely to}} survive famine. This tendency to store fat, however, would be maladaptive in societies with stable food supplies. This theory has received various criticisms, and other evolutionarily-based theories such as the drifty gene hypothesis and the thrifty phenotype hypothesis have also been proposed.|$|E

5|$|Uranium is a {{naturally}} occurring element {{that can be}} found in low levels within all rock, soil, and water. Uranium is the 51st element in order <b>of</b> <b>abundance</b> in the Earth's crust. Uranium is also the highest-numbered element to be found naturally in significant quantities on Earth and is almost always found combined with other elements. The decay of uranium, thorium, and potassium-40 in the Earth's mantle is thought to be the main source of heat that keeps the outer core liquid and drives mantle convection, which in turn drives plate tectonics.|$|E
5|$|All of the {{discovered}} {{alkali metals}} occur in nature as their compounds: in order <b>of</b> <b>abundance,</b> sodium {{is the most}} abundant, followed by potassium, lithium, rubidium, caesium, and finally francium, which is very rare due to its extremely high radioactivity; francium occurs only in the minutest traces in nature as an intermediate step in some obscure side branches of the natural decay chains. Experiments have been conducted to attempt the synthesis of ununennium (Uue), {{which is likely to}} be the next member of the group, but they have all met with failure. However, ununennium may not be an alkali metal due to relativistic effects, which are predicted to have a large influence on the chemical properties of superheavy elements; even if it does turn out to be an alkali metal, it is predicted to have some differences in physical and chemical properties from its lighter homologues.|$|E
5|$|Kubera is the Buddhist Vaiśravaṇa or Jambhala, and the Japanese Bishamon. The Buddhist Vaisravana, {{like the}} Hindu Kubera, is the reagent of the North, a Loka-pala and the Lord of Yakshas. He {{is one of}} the Four Heavenly Kings, each {{associated}} with a cardinal direction. In Buddhist legends, Kubera is also equated with Pañcika, whose wife Hariti is the symbol <b>of</b> <b>abundance.</b> The iconography of Kubera and Pancika is so similar that in certain cases, A. Getty comments, it is extremely difficult to distinguish between Pancika and Kubera. The Japanese Bishamon, also known as Tamon-Ten, {{is one of the}} Jūni-Ten (十二天), a group of 12 Hindu deities adopted in Buddhism as guardian deities (deva or ten) who are found in or around Buddhist shrines. The Juni-Ten group of twelve deities were created by adding four deities to the older grouping of Happou-Ten, the eight guardians of the directions. Bishamon rules over the north, like his Hindu counterpart Kubera.|$|E

5|$|The {{half-life}} of the longest-lived isotope of neptunium, 237Np, is negligible {{compared to}} the age of the Earth. Thus neptunium is present in nature in negligible amounts produced as intermediate decay products of other isotopes. Traces of plutonium in uranium minerals were first found in 1942, and the more systematic results on 239Pu are summarized in the table (no other plutonium isotopes could be detected in those samples). The upper limit <b>of</b> <b>abundance</b> of the longest-living isotope of plutonium, 244Pu, is 3%. Plutonium could not be detected in samples of lunar soil.

5|$|The least weasel feeds {{predominantly}} on mouse-like rodents, including mice, hamsters, gerbils and others. It {{usually does}} not attack adult hamsters and rats. Frogs, fish, small birds and bird eggs are rarely eaten. It {{can deal with}} adult pikas and gerbils, but usually cannot overcome brown rats and sousliks. Exceptional cases are known of least weasels killing prey far larger than themselves, such as capercaillie, hazel hen and hares. In England, a favoured prey item is the field vole (Microtus agrestis). These have fluctuations in population size, and in years <b>of</b> <b>abundance</b> may form up to 54% of the weasel's diet. In years of scarcity, birds form {{a greater proportion of}} the diet and female least weasels may fail to breed.|$|E
