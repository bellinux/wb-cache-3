40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to analyze the spatial-temporal dynamic status of Scotia-Fundy herring stocks in NAFO {{divisions}} 4 WX in the Bay of Fundy region and the Scotian Shelf. This thesis uses an alternative method to examine the dynamic in-season status of fish movement {{in space and time}} over the fishing season. Two models are presented based on Bayesian uncertainty statistical theory. A working computer decision model is developed to estimate the weekly stock abundance by area. A simulation model is developed to examine the strategic plan of the fishery. A visualized computer application tool, MapTest has been developed to implement the above two models. This application uses OLE (<b>object</b> <b>linked</b> <b>and</b> <b>embedded)</b> techniques to present fishing data on a GIS (geographic information system) mapping system <b>and</b> <b>link</b> <b>and</b> <b>embed</b> to a Visual Basic application. Using MapTest, fishery scientists can estimate the stock abundance based on the available catch data and simulate the impact of alternative catch scenarios. This thesis used the MapTest application to analyze the catch and estimated abundance of the five spawning areas in the 4 WX herring fishery and processed three estimated caches year analyses. The computer application developed and illustrated here provides valuable information to assist decision makers in managing the fishery in real on a spatial-temporal basis throughout the fishing year...|$|R

[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] In the present study, two CFH were designed in combination with ethical problem-solving guidelines. Two types of <b>links,</b> <b>embedded</b> <b>links</b> <b>and</b> question <b>links,</b> were used to foster crisscrossing navigation of the CFH and enhance performance in problem solving in engineering ethics. The main {{purpose of the study was}} two-fold: (a) Determine if the two types of <b>links,</b> question <b>and</b> <b>embedded,</b> differ significantly in promoting students' engineering ethical problem solving performance and on usage of website; (b) Determine if epistemological beliefs and moral judgment influence students' engineering ethical problem solving performance. Results indicated there were significant differences in ethical problem solving performance between the two groups who used two CFH. The question <b>link</b> <b>and</b> <b>embedded</b> <b>link</b> groups used the three cases similarly, however, question links were more frequently used than the <b>embedded</b> <b>links,</b> <b>and</b> in the question link group, a significantly larger number of participants used the question links. The influence of the use of question <b>links</b> <b>and</b> <b>embedded</b> <b>links</b> on participants' performance was different as well. Results also indicated that epistemological development was not a significant predictor for ethical problem solving performance in the two groups; while participants' moral reasoning skills did not influence ethical problem solving performance in the question link group, for the embedded link group, both P scores and N 2 scores were significant predictors for total case analysis scores...|$|R
