5|$|Avenged is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film is a melodrama focusing on John Warren, a young clerk, who is struck by a taxi cab while crossing the street. The chauffeur who struck him, Allen, decides to flee as a crowd gathers around John. Allen ditches his taxi <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>country</b> road and takes a train, successfully escaping. Six years later, the poor, ill and crippled John has become a timekeeper in a mining town. John's wife, who has taken care of him, sickens and dies. Allen, unaware of John's identity, attempts to comfort him and listens to John's story. After learning Allen wrecked his life, John attempts to shoot him, but the specter of his wife stays his hand. John goes to her grave, forgives Allen, and dies. No cast or production credits are known for this film. Released on October 7, 1910, the film was a distinct departure from other Thanhouser releases and was sharply criticized by reviewers. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, Amway {{purchased}} WHN in New York, giving Mutual {{a second}} major-market owned-and-operated station. <b>On</b> <b>a</b> <b>Country</b> Road, a music show hosted by WHN's Lee Arnold, was introduced and given national distribution. At {{the beginning of}} the year, Mutual had begun airing Mutual Radio Theater, formerly Sears Radio Theater, which it had just picked up. A number of well-regarded dramas were produced as part of the anthology series. In 1981, Mutual launched Dick Clark's National Music Survey, a three-hour-long weekly program combining music and interviews. Despite these developments and the fact that its satellite network was now fully on line, Amway was making little if any profit out of Mutual. The network's corporate parent began backing out of the radio business. Mutual Radio Theater, the network's last ever original dramatic series, aired its final show on December 19, 1981. In November 1983, Amway sold off Mutual's WCFL to Statewide Broadcasting. A year later, a deal was struck for the sale of WHN to Doubleday Broadcasting.|$|E

5|$|Stage Struck is an American silent short drama film {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film focuses <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>country</b> girl who joins a traveling production after the company performs in her home town. She runs away from her home to join them and is hired, but the hard life soon takes it toll and she is unable to continue on with them. A traveling sales man buys her a ticket home and she goes home to her father. Several weeks later she receives a letter offering her a position in a New York theater production and a letter requesting her marriage from the salesman. She decides to accept his offer and become his wife. The film was released on March 3, 1911 and was met with good reviews, but the film's intended daydream sequence was not understood by critics. The film is presumed lost.|$|E

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} reducing inflation volatility {{and the impact of}} enhancing financial institutions on economic welfare. First, an empirical analysis of the impact of inflation, inflation volatility, and financial institutions <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>country’s</b> sovereign debt rating is undertaken. Using a sample of 37 developed and developing countries over the period 1989 - 2006, the study estimates a non-linear rating regression that interacts inflation volatility with an index for financial institutions developed in this paper using principal component analysis. The results suggest that reducing inflation volatility can have a statistically and economically significant positive effect <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>country’s</b> sovereign debt rating. The results also show that improving financial institutions has a statistically and economically significant positive direct and indirect effect <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>country’s</b> sovereign debt rating. These empirical results are then used to calibrate the neoclassical one-sector growth model of Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1995) in order to quantify the welfare implications under two policy scenarios; 1) a one standard deviation decrease in inflation volatility and 2) a one standard deviation increase in the level of financial institutions...|$|R

The Belgian government in exile was wary of declaring war <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>country</b> whose royal family had dynastic links with its own, though this attitude changed after it became known that Italian aircraft based in occupied Belgium were attacking Britain and when an Italian submarine sank a Belgian cargo ship.
