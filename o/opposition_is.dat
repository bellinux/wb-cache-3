5|$|In {{the first}} episode, it is {{revealed}} that Pauline, aged 40, is {{pregnant with her}} third child. The character's pregnancy quickly became a prominent storyline within the series. Pauline, against her mother's <b>opposition,</b> <b>is</b> determined to keep the baby. The storyline was used to spread a public message on the increased risk of genetic defects in late pregnancies, with Pauline undergoing amniocentesis tests. The storyline culminates {{with the birth of}} the serial's first baby, Martin, in July 1985.|$|E

Jack's only other <b>opposition</b> <b>is</b> Devon, who has returned from the west coast, only now with a fiancée {{who happens to be}} Kathy Geiss (Marceline Hugot), Don's daughter. Upon returning, Devon, who is secretly gay, finds out from Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) about Jack's secret heart attack.

5|$|This is a List of Canadian Leaders of the Opposition. The Leader of the <b>Opposition</b> <b>is</b> {{usually the}} leader of the party with the second-most seats in the Canadian House of Commons, known as Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition. He or she is {{entitled}} to the same levels of pay and protection as a Cabinet Minister, and is often made a member of the Canadian Privy Council, generally the only non-government member of the House of Commons afforded that privilege.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{publication}} of the White Paper, the Project for the Sustainable Development of Heathrow ('Project Heathrow' for short) was set up to examine how expansion at Heathrow could best be accomplished within the constraints of the stringent environmental limits the White Paper required. A provisional assessment indicates that increased usage of the existing runways could be realised without increasing the number of people affected by noise if 'mixed mode' operations (the simultaneous use of both runways for arrivals and departures) are phased in gradually as noisier aircraft are retired. Indications ahead of the Project Heathrow environmental assessment indicate that increased noise and deterioration in air quality are likely to significantly constrain traffic using a new third runway. These issues are to be addressed as part of a three-month consultation beginning in December 2007, and considerable <b>opposition</b> <b>is</b> being mobilised against the expansion of Heathrow.|$|E

5|$|The GRC scheme {{has also}} been criticized for raising the bar for the {{opposition}} in elections. First, opposition parties may find it harder to find competent candidates, including minority candidates, to form teams to contest GRCs. Goh Chok Tong has acknowledged that the GRC scheme benefits the PAP as they can put together stronger teams. With the GRC system the threshold for votes for the <b>opposition</b> <b>is</b> also increased, and opposition parties {{have to take a}} gamble and commit huge proportions of their resources to contest GRCs. Each candidate in a GRC is required to deposit a sum equal to 8% of the total allowances payable to an MP in the calendar year preceding the election, rounded to the nearest S$500. At the 2011 general election, the deposit was $16,000. Unsuccessful candidates have their deposits forfeited if they do not receive at least one-eighth {{of the total number of}} votes polled in the GRC. Critics have noted that the number of walkovers has generally increased since the introduction of GRCs. To date, only one opposition party, the Workers' Party, has won a GRC: Aljunied, in the 2011 general election.|$|E
25|$|Inadmissible oppositions and oppositions {{which are}} deemed {{not to have}} been filed are not substantively {{examined}} (no examination on the merits). An opposition can only be rejected as inadmissible if the opposition has been first deemed to have been filed, and, if it is deemed to have been filed, the opposition exists, even if later the <b>opposition</b> <b>is</b> rejected as inadmissible. If an <b>opposition</b> <b>is</b> deemed {{not to have been}} filed, an already paid opposition fee is refunded. In contrast, if an <b>opposition</b> <b>is</b> rejected as inadmissible, an already paid opposition fee is not refunded.|$|E

25|$|Before {{starting}} the substantive {{examination of the}} opposition, the Opposition Division examines whether the opposition must be considered as filed ("Is there an opposition?") and whether it is admissible ("Is the opposition admissible?"). The Opposition Division may find that the <b>opposition</b> <b>is</b> not deemed to have been filed, for instance because the opposition fee has not been paid within the nine-month opposition period, because the notice of <b>opposition</b> <b>is</b> not signed or because the notice is not in an accepted language.|$|E

25|$|Problematic point(s):, linguistically speaking, {{these do}} not {{constitute}} an actual compound (because the meaning is not institutionalized), {{so there is no}} sound reason for writing them in one word. In addition, the normal alternative for writing in one word is writing with hyphens, rather than writing separately, so this <b>opposition</b> <b>is</b> unusual in Hungarian orthography.|$|E
25|$|The Australian Electoral Survey that is {{conducted}} following all elections by the Australian National University {{has found that}} support for a republic has remained reasonably static since 1987 at around 60%, if the type of republic {{is not part of}} the question.
