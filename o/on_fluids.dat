25|$|The {{mouthparts}} {{of insects}} that feed <b>on</b> <b>fluids</b> are modified {{in various ways}} to form a tube through which liquid can be drawn into the mouth and usually another through which saliva passes. The muscles of the cibarium or pharynx are strongly developed to form a pump. In nonbiting flies, the mandibles are absent and other structures are reduced; the labial palps have become modified to form the labellum, and the maxillary palps are present, although sometimes short. In Brachycera, the labellum is especially prominent and used for sponging liquid or semiliquid food. The labella are a complex structure consisting of many grooves, called pseudotrachea, which sops up liquids. Salivary secretions from the labella assist in dissolving and collecting food particles {{so they can be}} more easily taken up by the pseudotracheae; this is thought to occur by capillary action. The liquid food is then drawn up from the pseudotracheae through the food channel into the esophagus.|$|E

50|$|Pascalization, bridgmanization, high {{pressure}} processing (HPP) or high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) processing {{is a method}} of preserving and sterilizing food, in which a product is processed under very {{high pressure}}, leading to the inactivation of certain microorganisms and enzymes in the food. The technique was named after Blaise Pascal, a French scientist of the 17th century whose work included detailing the effects of pressure <b>on</b> <b>fluids.</b> During pascalization, more than 50,000 {{pounds per square inch}} (340 MPa, 3.4 kbar) may be applied for around fifteen minutes, leading to the inactivation of yeast, mold, and bacteria. Pascalization is also known as bridgmanization, named for physicist Percy Williams Bridgman.|$|E

5000|$|A mix of oil {{and water}} is pumped {{constantly}} into a cone-shaped separating apparatus at an angle, which creates a spinning vortex. The filtration {{is a result of}} the force balance that occurs <b>on</b> <b>fluids</b> in a vortex. High-density liquids will move to the outside, along with any contaminant, displacing the lower-density liquids to the inside (center of rotation). Water, being the more dense liquid, sits on the outside and is removed through a discharge outlet. Any segregated oil can now safely be recovered through a suction orifice at the center. The process will continue to function in this fashion as long as sufficient oil is added to maintain coverage of the suction orifice.|$|E

5000|$|Flies in {{the family}} Sarcophagidae (from the Greek σάρκο sarco- = flesh, φάγε phage = eating; the same roots as the word [...] "sarcophagus") are {{commonly}} known as flesh flies. They differ from most flies in that they are ovoviviparous, opportunistically depositing hatched or hatching maggots instead of eggs on carrion, dung, decaying material, or open wounds of mammals, hence their common name. Some flesh fly larvae are internal parasites of other insects such as Orthoptera, and some, in particular the Miltogramminae, are kleptoparasites of solitary Hymenoptera. The adults mostly feed <b>on</b> <b>fluids</b> from animal bodies, nectar, sweet foods, fluids from animal waste and other organic substances. Juveniles need protein to develop and may be laid on carrion, dung or sweet plant foods (including fruit, nuts, and artificial foodstuffs).|$|E
