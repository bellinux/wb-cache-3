5|$|Rodin was a naturalist, less {{concerned}} with monumental expression than with character and emotion. Departing with centuries of tradition, {{he turned away from}} the idealism of the Greeks, and the decorative beauty of the Baroque and neo-Baroque movements. His sculpture emphasized the individual and the concreteness of flesh, and suggested emotion through detailed, textured surfaces, and the interplay <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>and</b> <b>shadow.</b> To a greater degree than his contemporaries, Rodin believed that an individual's character was revealed by his physical features.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} early days of Sicilian Baroque, the first {{buildings}} of the new neoclassical era were often copies or hybrids of the two styles. The Palazzo Ducezio (Illustration 19) was begun in 1746, and the ground floor with arcades creating play <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>and</b> <b>shadow</b> is pure Baroque. However, when a few years later the upper floor was added, despite the use of Baroque broken pediments above the windows, the neoclassical French influence is very pronounced, highlighted by the central curved bay. The Sicilian Baroque was gradually and slowly being superseded by French neoclassicism.|$|E

5|$|The {{unblemished}} musculature of {{the central}} figure waving to the rescue ship {{is reminiscent of the}} Neoclassical, however the naturalism <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>and</b> <b>shadow,</b> the authenticity of the desperation shown by the survivors and the emotional character of the composition differentiate it from Neoclassical austerity. It was a further departure from the religious or classical themes of earlier works because it depicted contemporary events with ordinary and unheroic figures. Both the choice of subject matter and the heightened manner in which the dramatic moment is depicted are typical of Romantic painting—strong indications {{of the extent to which}} Géricault had moved from the prevalent Neoclassical movement.|$|E
5|$|Both {{inside and}} outside battle, characters' {{relationships}} can be developed through interactions {{on and off the}} battlefield. As the strength of their relationships grow, certain abilities in battle are also strengthened. A feature introduced in Genealogy of the Holy War and used in later titles was an aspect of relationships. A man and woman who fall in love will have a child, and that child will inherit certain skills and stats from them. One of the recurring features in the series is permanent death, a function in which units defeated in battle are permanently removed {{from the rest of the}} game with very few exceptions (the main character, a character pivotal to the main story). Up until Fire Emblem: New Mystery of the Emblem: Heroes <b>of</b> <b>Light</b> <b>and</b> <b>Shadow,</b> there was no option to disable permanent death. In New Mystery of the Emblem, a new Casual Mode was added, in which characters that died were revived at the end of a battle. Fates also added Phoenix Mode, in which characters slain during one turn are revived on the player's next turn. Another inclusion from Fates includes 'My Castle', a customisable castle that serves as the player's base of operations throughout the game.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{similarities}} between the Hellenistic wall paintings at Delos and the First Style of Pompeii, Joyce contends that the differences in Delian and Pompeian mosaics are the deliberate product of artistic preference rather than the result of ignorance of each other's traditions. These differences include the widespread use of opus signinum at Pompeii, with only four known examples at Delos; the use of opus sectile at Pompeii and its complete absence at Delos; the prevalent use of polychrome patterns and intricate, three-dimensional figured designs in Delian mosaics versus two-dimensional designs at Pompeii, which at best utilize two colors. Complex three-dimensional figured mosaics using polychrome designs to achieve the illusion <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>and</b> <b>shadow</b> weren't produced at Pompeii until the Pompeian Second Style of wall painting (80-20 BC) and are considered an adoption from Hellenistic art trends. While lead strips were used in Hellenistic mosaics of Delos, Athens, and Pella (Greece), Pergamon (Turkey), Callatis (Romania), Alexandria (Egypt), and Chersonesus (the Crimean peninsula), they are absent in Western Mediterranean mosaics of Malta, Sicily, and the Italian peninsula. Westgate affirms that Hellenistic mosaics can be divided into two broad categories: eastern and western, based on their different styles and production techniques.|$|E

25|$|The strict {{constructive}} ordering {{that had}} become so pronounced in Metzinger's pre-1920 Cubist works continued throughout the subsequent decades, in the careful positioning of form, color, {{and in the way}} in which Metzinger delicately assimilates the union of figure and background, <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>and</b> <b>shadow.</b> This can be seen in many figures: From the division (in two) of the model's features emerges a subtle profile view—resulting from a free and mobile perspective used by Metzinger to some extent as early as 1908 to constitute the image of a whole—one that includes the fourth dimension.|$|E
25|$|Le Chahut is a {{conspicuous}} example of Seurat’s pointillist technique. The modulation <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>and</b> <b>shadow</b> throughout {{the work is}} obtained {{by the use of}} small dots of color juxtaposed side by side while alternating in both intensity and concentrations. The dots are meant to fuse {{in the eye of the}} viewer to create the impression of mixed colors when observed from a distance. While the Impressionists had focused their attention on the harmony of colors based on similar or related hues (only partially separated), the Neo-Impressionists harmony had been based on contrasting hues, pitted one against the other; resulting in a vibrating mélange optique (the optical mixture in the observer's eye).|$|E
25|$|While Gude was a student, two {{different}} trends in landscaping were developing at the Academy: a romantic trend and a classical trend. The romanticists depicted wild, untamed wildernesses with dark forests, soaring peaks, and rushing water {{to capture the}} terrifying and overpowering aspects of nature. They used rich, saturated colors with strong contrast <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>and</b> <b>shadow.</b> The classicists {{were more interested in}} recreating landscapes from the heroic or mythical past and often set them in the midst of religious or historical events. The classicists focused on lines and clarity in their compositions. It was through Achenbach — Gude's first teacher upon arriving in Düsseldorf — that he was exposed to the romanticist tradition, while it was through his classes with and later time teaching for Schirmer that he was exposed to the classicist traditions.|$|E

25|$|Kollwitz's {{second major}} cycle of works was the Peasant War, which, subject to many {{preliminary}} drawings and discarded ideas in lithography, occupied her from 1902 to 1908. The German Peasants' War was a violent revolution {{which took place}} in Southern Germany {{in the early years of}} the Reformation, beginning in 1525; peasants who had been treated as slaves took arms against feudal lords and the church. As was The Weavers, this subject, too, might have been suggested by a Hauptmann drama, Florian Geyer. However, the initial source of Kollwitz's interest dated to her youth, when she and her brother Konrad playfully imagined themselves as barricade fighters in a revolution. The artist identified with the character of Black Anna, a woman cited as a protagonist in the uprising. When completed, the Peasant War consisted of pieces in etching, aquatint, and soft ground: Plowing, Raped, Sharpening the Scythe, Arming in the Vault, Outbreak, After the Battle (which, eerily premonitory, features a mother searching through corpses in the night, looking for her son), and The Prisoners. In all, the works were technically more impressive than those of The Weavers, owing to their greater size and dramatic command <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>and</b> <b>shadow.</b> They are Kollwitz's highest achievements as an etcher.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with the}} {{influences}} of the Pompeii and Herculaneum excavations, several other factors came together to popularize neoclassical dress. Starting in the early 1790s, Emma Hamilton began her performances of attitudes, something that was considered by contemporaries as entirely new. These attitudes were based loosely on the ancient practice of pantomime, though Emma’s performances lacked masks and musical accompaniment. Her performances created a fusion between art and nature; art came alive and her body became a type of art. As an aid to her performances of tragic mythological and historical figures, Emma wore the clothing á la grecque that would become popular in mainstream France in the coming years. A simple light colored chemise made from thin, flowing material was worn and gathered with a narrow ribbon under the breasts. Simple cashmere shawls were used as headdresses or to give more fullness to the drapery of the chemise. They also helped to prevent broken lines in the performance so that the outstretched arms were always connected with the body, escalating the effect of fluid movement, and oftentimes, a cape or a cloak was worn to emphasize {{the lines of the}} body in certain poses. This highlighted the continuity of surface of line and form {{in the body of the}} performer to emphasize the unity, simplicity, and continuously flowing movement from one part of the body to the next. The hair was worn in a natural, loose, and flowing fashion. All of these properties blended together to allow an extensive play <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>and</b> <b>shadow</b> to reveal and accent certain parts of the body during the performance, while covering others. Emma was highly capable in her attitudes, and the influence of her dress spread from Naples to Paris as wealthy Parisians took the Grand Tour.|$|E

[...] The painting features one of the first examples of Monet's use of colored shadows, which would later become associated with the Impressionist movement. Monet and the Impressionists used colored shadows to represent the actual, changing conditions <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>and</b> <b>shadow</b> as seen in nature, challenging the academic convention of painting shadows black. This subjective theory of color perception was introduced to the art world through the works of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Michel Eugène Chevreul earlier in the century.|$|E
500|$|In 1893, Krøyer {{included}} Marie in Roses, {{in which}} she is shown relaxing in the garden at Madam Bendsen's house. The original title is Roser.

The painting is interesting in that its treatment <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>and</b> <b>shadow</b> shows how Krøyer had been influenced by the French Impressionists while he was in Paris. [...] Marie, framed by the overhanging roses, is shown reading a newspaper; to her left is another empty deckchair which was probably where Krøyer would have sat.

500|$|Prior to Galileo's {{construction}} of {{his version of}} a telescope, Thomas Harriot, an English mathematician and explorer, had already used what he dubbed a [...] "perspective tube" [...] to observe the moon.

While not being the only one to observe the moon through a telescope, Galileo was the first to deduce the cause of the uneven waning as light occlusion from lunar mountains and craters. In his study, he also made topographical charts, estimating the heights of the mountains. The moon was not what was long thought to have been a translucent and perfect sphere, as Aristotle claimed, and hardly the first [...] "planet", an [...] "eternal pearl to magnificently ascend into the heavenly empyrian", as put forth by Dante.|$|E
