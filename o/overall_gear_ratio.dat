5000|$|The <b>overall</b> <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> of {{a simple}} {{planetary}} gearset can be calculated using the following two equations, representing the sun-planet and planet-ring interactions respectively: ...|$|E
50|$|The most {{fundamental}} meaning {{is that of}} an <b>overall</b> <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> between engine and wheels, such that the car is over-geared, and cannot reach its potential top speed, i.e. the car could travel faster if it were in a lower gear, with the engine turning at higher RPM.|$|E
50|$|In a {{sequence}} of gears chained together, the ratio depends only {{on the number of}} teeth on the first and last gear. The intermediate gears, regardless of their size, do not alter the <b>overall</b> <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> of the chain. However, the addition of each intermediate gear reverses the direction of rotation of the final gear.|$|E
5000|$|Brazilian {{versions}} of the XR 200R were introduced in 1992 and remained on production until 2001 for the domestic market and at least until 2015 for export, always fitted with the 2-valve engine, electric start and front disc brake. At least in Australia, the Brazilian-made model was rebadged CTX200 and fitted with a [...] "cheater sprocket" [...] to get an <b>overall</b> lower <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> more suitable {{to the needs of}} agricultural operators and is not roadworthy (however their owners can apply for conditional registration which allows for a limited usage of public roads).|$|R
50|$|One of {{the main}} needs for a {{transmission}} is to match {{the speed of the}} engine to the speed of the locomotive, so that the engine can work in its useful operating speed range. All locomotives need to deliver high torque from zero rail speed for startup. The <b>overall</b> range of <b>gear</b> <b>ratios</b> required from the transmission thus depends on the maximum speed of the train. The narrower the power band of the engine, the more precise control of gearbox ratio is required, either by using a continuously variable transmission or a discrete ratio transmission with more ratios.|$|R
25|$|Even {{though the}} {{final drive ratio}} for {{vehicles}} equipped with the 7-speed automatic has been (numerically) reduced from 3.69 to 3.36, the new 7-speed automatic has much lower first through fourth <b>gear</b> <b>overall</b> <b>ratios</b> than the old 5-speed automatic and the 6-speed manual in the 6MT cars (which retain the old 3.69 final drive ratio). Giving it closer <b>gear</b> <b>ratios</b> in all <b>gears,</b> to match engine rpm better with power demand, brings better acceleration while overdrive ratios in 6th and 7th gears reduces highway cruising rpm and improves fuel mileage. The new 7-speed automatic retains the Drive Sport (DS) shift mode and Downshift Rev Matching (DRM) feature of the previous 5-speed automatic. Paddle shifters are standard on G37S models equipped with the 7-speed automatic. The new engine/transmission combo did add some weight the car (3,590lb. for the G37 vs. 3,508 for the G35 in identical trim).|$|R
50|$|An {{idler gear}} {{does not affect}} the gear ratio between the input and output shafts. Note that in a {{sequence}} of gears chained together, the ratio depends only on the number of teeth on the first and last gear. The intermediate gears, regardless of their size, do not alter the <b>overall</b> <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> of the chain. But, of course, the addition of each intermediate gear reverses the direction of rotation of the final gear.|$|E
50|$|The gear {{relies on}} the inter-meshing {{of a number of}} thin disks. By varying their separation, the {{effective}} radius of one disk varies, thus changing the <b>overall</b> <b>gear</b> <b>ratio.</b> This varying-radius principle is shared by a number of other variator mechanisms. An advantage of the Beier is {{that a large number of}} disks may be stacked on a common shaft, thus increasing its torque capacity for only a small increase in overall length.|$|E
50|$|In North America the Hilux saw {{the use of}} four-wheel drive. It had a solid {{front axle}} and leaf suspension. The body saw a {{redesign}} that included single round headlights and a less complex body. This new 4WD setup featured a gear driven RF1A transfer case. This transfer case is unique in that its low-range reduction portion can be replicated, using what some refer to as a dual or triple transfer case. This results in a much lower <b>overall</b> <b>gear</b> <b>ratio.</b> It was the first Hilux available with an automatic transmission.|$|E
50|$|The Rohloff Speedhub is an {{epicyclic}} internal {{hub gear}} for bicycles, developed and patented by Rohloff AG. It has been manufactured and marketed by that company since 1998. The Speedhub 500/14 has 14 equally spaced sequential non-overlapping <b>gear</b> <b>ratios</b> {{operated by a}} single twistgrip. The <b>overall</b> <b>gear</b> range is 526%, meaning the highest gear is 5.26 times {{as high as the}} lowest gear. Individual gear shifts when shifting up give an increase of about 13.6% (equivalent to a decrease of about 12.0% when shifting down).|$|R

40|$|The {{creation}} of molecular machines {{has been one}} of the goals of modern nanotechnology for a few decades. Such machines can be assembled from small molecules, as well as DNA. Of particular interest are mechanically interlocked nanoconstructs – catenanes and rotaxanes. These structures offer developments such as nanoswitches and rotational motors. DNA nanotechnology has produced numerous systems that consist of catenanes that could perform programmable switching and stimuli-responsive behaviour, as well as switching between stations in a semi-autonomous, rotary, motor-like behaviour. Energy transduction and the speed of such Brownian ratchet motors are negligible when compared to natural enzymatic activity. Bridging the gap between enzymology and structural DNA nanotechnology, we propose a method to assemble and operate a prototype system of fully complementary interlocked ssDNA rings that can roll against each other as a pair of <b>gears</b> with a <b>ratio</b> 1 : 2. The directionality and force is proposed to be generated by a strand-displacing polymerase enzyme performing a rolling circle amplification reaction on one of the members of this catenane, generating torque. Computer modelling of this system using oxDNA script package has been carried out, enabling both the topological visualisation and structural inquiry into the system prior to experimental development. Variations to the system such as changing the <b>overall</b> size, <b>gearing</b> <b>ratio</b> and developments towards integration into larger assemblies have also been described and are discussed in detail. Several experimental assembly strategies are described, together with experimental evidence of their outcomes. A method for operation of the single-stranded DNA catenane as a pair of continuously rolling gears has been investigated using strand displacing polymerases. Applications and suggestions for future developments is provided, addressing integration into complex systems. Additional methods of assembly and operation are discussed and compared...|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of bicycle chains, it is {{possible}} to modify the <b>overall</b> <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> of the chain drive by varying the diameter (and therefore, the tooth count) of the sprockets {{on each side of the}} chain. This is the basis of derailleur gears. A multi-speed bicycle, by providing two or three different-sized driving sprockets and up to 11 (as of 2014) different-sized driven sprockets, allows up to 33 different gear ratios. The resulting lower gear ratios make the bike easier to pedal up hills while the higher gear ratios make the bike more powerful to pedal on flats and downhills. In a similar way, manually changing the sprockets on a motorcycle can change the characteristics of acceleration and top speed by modifying the final drive gear ratio.|$|E
50|$|In {{this most}} common CVT system, {{there are two}} V-belt pulleys that are split {{perpendicular}} to their axes of rotation, with a V-belt running between them. The gear ratio is changed by moving the two sheaves of one pulley closer together and the two sheaves of the other pulley farther apart. The V-shaped {{cross section of the}} belt causes it to ride higher on one pulley and lower on the other. This changes the effective diameters of both pulleys, which changes the <b>overall</b> <b>gear</b> <b>ratio.</b> As the distance between the pulleys and the length of the belt does not change both pulleys must be adjusted (one bigger, the other smaller) simultaneously {{in order to maintain the}} proper amount of tension on the belt. Simple CVTs combining a centrifugal drive pulley with a spring loaded driven pulley often use belt tension to effect the conforming adjustments in the driven pulley. The V-belt needs to be very stiff in the pulley's axial direction in order to make only short radial movements while sliding in and out of the pulleys.|$|E
50|$|The tzero is a {{handmade}} electric {{sports car}} {{designed and built}} in very limited numbers by the U.S. company AC Propulsion. The tzero {{was based on the}} Piontek Sportech kit car, which consists of a fiberglass body built over a reinforced steel space frame with double wishbone independent suspension and rack and pinion steering. AC Propulsion added the AC-150 drivetrain, a single-speed electric system with an <b>overall</b> <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> of 9:1. Launched in January 1997, only three prototypes were built and plans for commercial production were dropped in mid-2003. The name comes from t0, the mathematical symbol for a starting point in time. Due to high production costs, AC Propulsion ceased to produce the tzero. Only three were built, one of which is owned by the company itself, one by Gruber Power Services, a company that specializes in Tesla Roadster repair, and one privately. The drivetrain, however, was used in many other vehicles. Because the car recharges its batteries when the throttle is released — slowing sharply as energy is recaptured — it can be driven hard using only the accelerator pedal. Also, if the car detects a turn with more than half a g-force (5 m/s²), it eases the rear-wheel regenerative braking to prevent slides.|$|E
50|$|In {{the series}} transmission, the 1st <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> is 4.73 {{times that of}} the 5th <b>gear</b> <b>ratio,</b> while in the {{close-ratio}} transmission the 1st <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> is 3.76 {{times that of the}} 5th <b>gear</b> <b>ratio.</b> Given that both transmissions have 5 gears, this is indicative of the latter transmission having <b>gear</b> <b>ratios</b> spaced closer together; hence, its being a close-ratio transmission.|$|R
5000|$|One way {{to create}} a {{close-ratio}} transmission is to install more gears into the transmission without altering the lowest and highest <b>gear</b> <b>ratios.</b> In this manner, some six-speed transmissions available in consumer vehicles are labelled as [...] "close-ratio". Again, the defining issue is the <b>overall</b> spacing of <b>gears</b> between 1st {{and in this case}} 6th gear.|$|R
50|$|<b>Gear</b> <b>ratios</b> {{for this}} transmission.Final drivesThe C59/7A-FE {{may also have}} {{different}} <b>gear</b> <b>ratios.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{simplest}} transmissions, {{often called}} gearboxes to reflect their simplicity (although complex systems are also called gearboxes in the vernacular), provide gear reduction (or, more rarely, {{an increase in}} speed), sometimes {{in conjunction with a}} right-angle change in direction of the shaft (typically in helicopters, see picture). These are often used on PTO-powered agricultural equipment, since the axial PTO shaft is at odds with the usual need for the driven shaft, which is either vertical (as with rotary mowers), or horizontally extending {{from one side of the}} implement to another (as with manure spreaders, flail mowers, and forage wagons). More complex equipment, such as silage choppers and snowblowers, have drives with outputs in more than one direction.The gearbox in a wind turbine converts the slow, high-torque rotation of the turbine into much faster rotation of the electrical generator. These are much larger and more complicated than the PTO gearboxes in farm equipment. They weigh several tons and typically contain three stages to achieve an <b>overall</b> <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> from 40:1 to over 100:1, depending on the size of the turbine. (For aerodynamic and structural reasons, larger turbines have to turn more slowly, but the generators all have to rotate at similar speeds of several thousand rpm.) The first stage of the gearbox is usually a planetary gear, for compactness, and to distribute the enormous torque of the turbine over more teeth of the low-speed shaft. Durability of these gearboxes has been a serious problem for a long time.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{performance}} capability of the Extendable Stiff Arm Manipulator (ESAM) {{it was necessary to}} increase the <b>overall</b> <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> by a factor of approximately four. This is accomplished with minimum effect to existing hardware by the interposition of a planetary gear transmission between the respective drive motors and the harmonic drive transmissions. The engineering analysis in support of this design approach and the subsequent no-load test results are reported...|$|E
40|$|Space-compatible {{cryogenic}} valves are {{now required}} to operate between room and liquid helium temperatures. A remotely controllable cryogenic valve is described, {{which is made}} of bellows-type stainless steel and is operated by a miniature dc motor with integral gearset (485 : 1) at a nominal voltage of 28 Vdc. The power transmission provides a further reduction of 7. 2 : 1 to give an <b>overall</b> <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> of nearly 3500 : 1, assuring reliability of operation at low temperatures. Valve performance (leak rate) data are presented at LN 2, LHe, and SfHe temperatures at delivered torques of 18, 27, 31, and 35 N-m. At a closing torque of 31 N-m, a leak rate of 0. 028 scc/sec was achieved at 2 K, while at a torque of 18 N-m the leak rate at 300 K was less than 3 x 10 to the - 9 th scc/sec...|$|E
25|$|On {{a bicycle}} {{with only one}} gear change {{mechanism}} (e.g. rear hub only or rear derailleur only), the number of possible <b>gear</b> <b>ratios</b> {{is the same as}} the number of usable <b>gear</b> <b>ratios,</b> which is also the same as the number of distinct <b>gear</b> <b>ratios.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Most hybrid, touring, mountain, {{and racing}} {{bicycles}} {{are equipped with}} both front and rear derailleurs. [...] There are a few <b>gear</b> <b>ratios</b> which have a straight chain path, {{but most of the}} <b>gear</b> <b>ratios</b> will have the chain running at an angle. [...] The use of two derailleurs generally results in some duplicate or near duplicate <b>gear</b> <b>ratios,</b> so that the number of distinct <b>gear</b> <b>ratios</b> is typically around two-thirds of the number of advertised <b>gear</b> <b>ratios.</b> The more common configurations have specific names [...] which are usually related to the relative step sizes between the front chainrings and the rear cogset.|$|R
50|$|A high <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> {{occurs when}} the {{contraction}} velocity of the whole muscle {{is much greater than}} that of an individual muscle fiber, resulting in a <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> that is greater than 1. A high <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> will result in low force, high velocity contractions of the entire muscle. The angle of pennation will increase during contraction accompanied by an increase in thickness. Thickness is defined as the area between the aponeuroses of the muscle. A low <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> {{occurs when the}} contraction velocity of the whole muscle and individual fibers is approximately the same, resulting in a <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> of 1. Conditions resulting in a low <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> include high force and low velocity contraction of the whole muscle. The pennation angle typically shows little variation. The muscle thickness will decrease.|$|R
25|$|A single-speed bicycle {{is a type}} of bicycle with {{a single}} <b>gear</b> <b>ratio.</b> These {{bicycles}} are without derailleur gears, hub gearing or other methods for varying the <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> of the bicycle. Adult single-speed bicycles typically have a <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> of between 55 and 75 gear inches, depending on the rider and the anticipated usage.|$|R
2500|$|Segmented musculature, like pennate muscle, has fibers aligned at {{an angle}} and due to this feature of design, when muscle fibers {{increase}} in angle {{with respect to the}} medial axis, along with the direction and amount of muscle bulging, the Architectural <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> increases. A variable <b>gear</b> <b>ratio,</b> based upon different anatomical position, loading and movement conditions, has since been dubbed spatially varying <b>gear</b> <b>ratio.</b> The occurrence of spatially varying <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> gives rise to a new insight of muscle biology; “inhomogenous muscle mechanics.” ...|$|R
30|$|We {{conducted}} {{series of}} experiments and obtained quantitative results about the shoulder joint contact force for lever propulsion on three different <b>gear</b> <b>ratios</b> of the lever propulsion mechanism. These results were also compared with the experimental results from a handrim propulsion test. For our trials we developed a special mechatronic wheelchair simulator that allowed simulation of different <b>gear</b> <b>ratios</b> of the lever propulsion mechanism. Further, we examined {{the effect of the}} <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> of lever-propulsion mechanism on the shoulder joint contact force. For that purpose, we also conducted {{series of experiments}} where the <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> was varied from 1.5 to 1 and 1 / 1.5. Experimental results showed that shoulder joint contact force during lever propulsion mechanism with <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> 1 / 1.5 was up to 70  % lower than the shoulder joint contact force during handrim propulsion. Although this study was limited to three <b>gear</b> <b>ratios</b> of the propulsion mechanism, it evidences the positive effect of the lever propulsion mechanisms with <b>gear</b> <b>ratio.</b> Our plan is to conduct further lever-propulsion experiments for different <b>gear</b> <b>ratios</b> and target speeds. In the future, we also intend to expand the initial results obtained within this study by making new tests with a bigger number of participants, including wheelchair users.|$|R
25|$|In pennate muscles, {{segments}} {{with higher}} pennation angles put out less force per shortening muscle fiber. Therefore, the architectural <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> of a pennate muscle {{is higher than}} the architectural <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> of spindle like muscles (e.g. fusiform). A smaller fiber length neutralizes this higher architectural <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> if the muscle fibers must be squeezed into the same space.|$|R
50|$|Normally, {{worm gears}} provide a <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> of 14:1. Versions with an 18:1 <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> also exist, trading better {{accuracy}} in fine tuning against slower initial string winding.|$|R
2500|$|On some bicycles, {{there is}} only one gear and the <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> is fixed. Many {{contemporary}} bicycles have multiple gears and thus multiple <b>gear</b> <b>ratios.</b> A shifting mechanism allows selection of the appropriate <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> for efficiency or comfort under the prevailing circumstances: for example, it may be comfortable to use a high gear when cycling downhill, a medium gear when cycling on a flat road, and a low gear when cycling uphill. [...] Different <b>gear</b> <b>ratios</b> and <b>gear</b> ranges are appropriate for different people and styles of cycling.|$|R
5000|$|There {{is also a}} {{transmission}} called a torque converter, or CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission). The torque converter is essentially an automatic transmission that changes <b>gear</b> <b>ratios</b> according to {{the speed of the}} engine. When the engine is at low RPMs, the <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> is at 1:x, depending on the ratio the torque converter has (This allows for more lower end torque). As the speed rises, the <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> changes to 1:1. As the higher end RPMs are reached, the <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> reaches X:1, which allows for a higher top speed.|$|R
25|$|Architectural <b>gear</b> <b>ratio,</b> {{also called}} {{anatomical}} <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> (AGR) is {{a feature of}} pennate muscle defined by the ratio between the longitudinal strain of the muscle and muscle fiber strain.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{ascertain}} if <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> selection would have an effect on peak power and time to peak power production in elite Bicycle Motocross (BMX) cyclists. Eight male elite BMX riders volunteered for the study. Each rider performed three, 10 -s maximal sprints on an Olympic standard indoor BMX track. The riders' bicycles were fitted with a portable SRM power meter. Each rider performed the three sprints using <b>gear</b> <b>ratios</b> of 41 / 16, 43 / 16 and 45 / 16 tooth. The results from the 41 / 16 and 45 / 16 <b>gear</b> <b>ratios</b> were compared to the current standard 43 / 16 <b>gear</b> <b>ratio.</b> Statistically, significant differences were found between the <b>gear</b> <b>ratios</b> for peak power (F(2, 14) [*]=[*] 6. 448; p[*]=[*]. 010) and peak torque (F(2, 14) [*]=[*] 4. 777; p[*]=[*]. 026), but no significant difference was found for time to peak power (F(2, 14) [*]=[*] 0. 200; p[*]=[*]. 821). When comparing <b>gear</b> <b>ratios,</b> the results showed a 45 / 16 <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> elicited the highest peak power, 1658 [*]±[*] 221  W, compared to 1436 [*]±[*] 129  W and 1380 [*]±[*] 56  W, for the 43 / 16 and 41 / 16 ratios, respectively. The time to peak power showed a 41 / 16 tooth <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> attained peak power in - 0. 01  s and a 45 / 16 in 0. 22  s compared to the 43 / 16. The findings of this study suggest that <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> choice has a significant effect on peak power production, though time to peak power output is not significantly affected. Therefore, selecting a higher <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> results in riders attaining higher power outputs without reducing their start time...|$|R

40|$|In {{the area}} of {{universal}} gear reducers, standard does not prescribe relations between load capacity, <b>gear</b> <b>ratios</b> and axis heights. Therefore, larger load capacity of some gear reducers manufacturers has advantage for lower <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> and, vice versa, smaller load capacity of the gearbox achieves higher values of <b>gear</b> <b>ratio.</b> However, there are some manufacturers who produce gear reducers with smaller or larger load capacity for higher or lower <b>gear</b> <b>ratio,</b> within the same axis height.
