5|$|Although Walker {{continued}} Census-related activities, {{he began}} to lecture <b>on</b> <b>political</b> economy as well as establishing a new general course of study (Course IX) emphasizing economics, history, law, English, and modern languages.

Walker {{emphasized the importance of}} faculty governance by regularly attending their meetings and seeking their advice on major decisions.|$|E

5|$|Commentators {{attributed}} the mismanagement behind Enron’s fall {{to a variety}} of ethical and political-economic causes. Ethical explanations centered on executive greed and hubris, a lack of corporate social responsibility, situation ethics, and get-it-done business pragmatism. Political-economic explanations cited post-1970s deregulation, and inadequate staff and funding for regulatory oversight. A more libertarian analysis maintained that Enron’s collapse resulted from the company’s reliance <b>on</b> <b>political</b> lobbying, rent-seeking, and the gaming of regulations.|$|E

The visual attracted critical attention from media commentators, who discussed the possible inspirations for the women and the setting.

5|$|Evans {{sought to}} promote a form of nativist, Protestant nationalism. In {{addition}} to his white supremacist ideology, he fiercely condemned Catholicism, unionism, and communism, which were associated with recent immigrants from eastern and southern Europe. He argued that Jews formed a non-American culture and resisted assimilation, although he denied being an anti-Semite. Historians credit Evans with refocusing the Klan <b>on</b> <b>political</b> activities and recruiting outside the Southern United States; the Klan grew most in the Midwest and industrial cities. However, they note that the political influence and membership gains he sought were transitory. Some commentators argue that Evans was more focused on money and power than any particular ideology.|$|E

5|$|He {{spend much}} of his fortune <b>on</b> <b>political</b> activism, and was nearly {{bankrupt}} {{by the time of}} his death. In February 1790, despite his objections, he was pressured, through general public demand, into reelection for a second (yearly) term of office as the mayor of Warsaw. It is likely that major reasons he preferred not to have been elected were his ailing business operations and his worsening health. He led his last public debate on 31 April 1790, and withdrew from politics afterward. He died on 4 October 1790 in Warsaw. He was buried in St. John's Archcathedral, and his large funeral was paid for by the City of Warsaw.|$|E

Rio Branco was a heavy smoker, and he would daily smoke up to thirty Cuban cigars specially imported for him from Havana. Until July 1880, he was still making appearances in Parliament to deliver speeches, but after that date he no longer attended. Rio Branco still kept a close watch <b>on</b> <b>political</b> developments, however, and continued to appear at meetings of the Council of State. He had already retired from teaching in 1877.|$|E

In recent years, events where Griffin has been invited to participate in public debates or political discussions have proven controversial and often resulted in protests and cancellations.|$|E
