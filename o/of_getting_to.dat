5|$|By mid-morning, it was {{apparent}} that the failure of the New Zealanders to advance their section of the front exposed the left flank of the neighbouring 3rd Australian Division, which had secured its first objective and was pushing on to its second. Likewise, on the New Zealand Division's left, the 9th (Scottish) Division had managed to reach its final objective. Godley issued new instructions to the New Zealand Division; abandoning any hope <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> the Green Line, it was to push on to the Blue Line in an attack timed for 3:00pm. However, by the early afternoon the flanking Scots had been pushed back while the Australians had failed to make further gains and were withdrawing due to enfilade gunfire on the flanks. Braithwaite, warned by his battalion commanders that capturing the Blue Line was impossible, twice pushed Russell for a cancellation of the attack. Russell's initial response was to instruct the Rifle Brigade to continue, but shortly before the attack was to begin, it was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|If {{the player}} follows Gail, they go after an unknown man, but end up losing him. Rick then tells Regina that Tom's dead. If the player follows Rick, they come across Tom, badly injured and near death. Rick takes {{him to the}} medical room, however a Velociraptor attacks them, but Tom sacrifices himself to kill it and save Rick. Later, Regina and the team manage to locate Kirk and {{apprehend}} him. As they are preparing to leave via helicopter, the T. rex returns and destroys the helicopter, forcing them to flee back into the base while Kirk manages to escape. Regina and Rick flee into the facility and locate keys to a watercraft, but find a vortex in the way <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> it. Rick speculates this is the spacetime distortion that brought the dinosaurs back. The two split up to find an alternate route off the island, and Regina ends up being held at gunpoint by Dr. Kirk. He is about to kill her when the gun is shot {{out of his hand}} by Gail, and they arrest him again.|$|E

25|$|According to the 2006 census, {{the most}} common way <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> work from Ashfield was by car (46%) {{followed}} by train (41%).

25|$|The sixth {{congregation}} {{was scheduled}} for that evening.

25|$|With {{distribution}} packaging, one vital packaging development {{consideration is}} {{to determine if a}} packaged-product is likely to be damaged in the process <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> the final customer.

If a product is damaged during this process, then the package has failed to accomplish a primary objective and the customer will either return the product or be unlikely to purchase the product altogether.|$|E

25|$|In {{the next}} season, Brighton pushed hard for promotion, but Coppell {{received}} {{a job offer}} from Reading, which he accepted, despite the Seagulls topping the Division Two table. Coppell cited the apparent lack of progress on the Falmer stadium project, which was {{a major factor in}} his decision to join the club. Without a modern stadium, Coppell felt Brighton had little chance <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> the Premier League, which was where Coppell wanted to be managing. Reading had recently completed the Madejski Stadium, making them an ideal employer.|$|E
25|$|FWTA also {{operates}} a vanpool/carpool service. A vanpool/carpool {{is a group}} of at least seven people who share the costs <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> and from work. These individuals usually live and work near each other. Monthly fares will vary, depending on the origination point of the van and the daily miles involved. Riders pay only for the portion of the trip they use. For instance, if the service picks up riders in different counties, it's possible for some riders to pay more than others.|$|E
25|$|The Ronde, in {{its first}} decades, {{followed}} the general rule that each racer was responsible for his own problems. Help from others was banned and riders carried spare tyres looped round their shoulders to cope with punctures. It could take {{two or three minutes}} to change and inflate a tyre, longer if it was cold or there were other problems. Tyres weighed around 500g (compared to currently around 200g). A rim or any other part of the bike that broke spelled the end of the race and still left the rider with the problem <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> the finish.|$|E

25|$|The Mount Lowe Railway opened officially on July 4, 1893. Folks amassed {{themselves}} at the remote Mountain Junction. Up to this point {{there was only one}} means of public transportation from the valleys below to the hillside community of Altadena. It was the Los Angeles Terminal Railway which by this time was running from Terminal Island in San Pedro to Mountain Junction. The trains ran twice a day and, at that, very irregularly, so the only sure means <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> Altadena on time was by your own horse and buggy. This lack of transportation coupled with Lowe’s inability to establish any at all would be in part the downfall of the railway.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1968, WMATA polling {{suggested}} that citizens of Maryland and Virginia strongly supported Metro. After all, these people desperately needed a quick, efficient way <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> their jobs in the District of Columbia. Eager {{to find some way}} to break ground and begin the construction of the subway system, WMATA asked voters in the two states to approve construction bonds for the subway. They overwhelming did so in November 1968, with 72 percent of voters in favor. Natcher also agreed in the fall of 1968 to release funds for architectural plans, engineering design, and land acquisition (but not construction) of Metro, and Metro broke ground in December 1969. But as Natcher continued to withhold construction funds through 1971, citizens of Maryland and Virginia began to think that the money they had invested in Metro would be wasted. Soon, political pressure was building on members of Congress from these two states to stop Natcher and move ahead with Metro.|$|E
25|$|Sun-Ray Cinema, {{formerly}} the 5 Points Theatre and Riverside Theatre, opened in 1927. It {{was the first}} theater equipped to show talking pictures in Florida and the third nationally. It {{is located in the}} Five Points section of town and was renamed the Five Points Theater in 1949. The Florida Theatre, opened in 1927, is located in downtown Jacksonville and is one of only four remaining high-style movie palaces built in Florida during the Mediterranean Revival architectural boom of the 1920s. Since that time, Jacksonville has been chosen by a number of film and television studios for on-location shooting. Notable motion pictures that have been partially or completely shot in Jacksonville since the silent film era include Creature from the Black Lagoon (1954), The New Adventures of Pippi Longstocking (1988), Brenda Starr (1989), G.I. Jane (1997), The Devil's Advocate (1997), Ride (1998), Why Do Fools Fall In Love (1998), Forces of Nature (1999), Tigerland (2000), Sunshine State (2002), Basic (2003), The Manchurian Candidate (2004), Lonely Hearts (2006), Moving McAllister (2007), The Year <b>of</b> <b>Getting</b> <b>to</b> Know Us (2008), The Ramen Girl and Like Dandelion Dust.|$|E

Staying at the Rodeway Inn motel in adjacent Springfield, they moved an old piano from the lobby into McGill's room, which became known as [...] "party central." [...] James Widdoes ("Hoover") remembers, [...] "It was like freshman orientation. There was a lot <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> know each other and calling each other by our character names." [...] This tactic encouraged the actors playing the Deltas to separate themselves from the actors playing the Omegas, helping generate authentic animosity between them on camera. Belushi and his wife Judy rented a house in south Eugene in order to keep him away from alcohol and drugs; she remained in Oregon while he commuted to New York City for Saturday Night Live.|$|E
500|$|When Arsène Wenger joined Arsenal in October 1996, he {{attempted}} to organise an extra training session at the club's University College London Union (UCLU) Shenley Sports grounds, for the benefit <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> know his players.

A few weeks after, a fire partially burnt down the training centre, costing £50,000 in damages. Arsenal temporarily rehoused their training base to Sopwell House Hotel in St Albans. Wenger, dismayed by the arrangement, campaigned for a purpose-built, Arsenal-owned ground that housed the latest training equipment.

So, maybe it'll only sell a million singles and reach No. 2", giving the song three-and-a-half stars. Daryl Addison of Great American Country praised the song, saying that [...] "even with heavy thematic elements, the songs impressively maintain a pop/crossover shine and accessible sound, courtesy of Carrie's pristine voice and modern delivery." [...] Writing for Country Universe, Kevin Coyne gave the song an A, complimenting the singer's versatility, saying that [...] "it's a credit to her ambition as an artist.
