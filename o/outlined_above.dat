5|$|Another related {{spurious}} generation {{method is}} the slight modulation {{due to the}} GRR <b>outlined</b> <b>above.</b> The amplitude of these spurs is low for large N and their frequency is generally too low to be detectable but they may cause issues for some applications.|$|E
5|$|Neurological {{evaluations}} to {{help determine}} the degree of impairment are performed initially and repeatedly {{in the early stages}} of treatment; this determines the rate of improvement or deterioration and informs treatment and prognosis.

5|$|Committees {{have two}} types of members: full members and {{participating}} members. In the case of standing committees, full members are the six <b>outlined</b> <b>above.</b> In addition, however, any Senator may arrange for the Senate to agree to their being made a participating member of the committee. This gives them {{the same rights as}} full members, with the important exception of being unable to vote on motions in private meetings of the committees.|$|E
5|$|A {{major reason}} for this is economy. A single wooden tablet {{presented}} a limited space for writing, so it was in the interest of scribes to transcribe information efficiently, while still maintaining legibility and aesthetic quality. The ‘grafting’ system described above achieves this in an elegant manner. Another reason may be secrecy. Assuming that literacy was restricted to elites and professional navigators, it was in their interest to prevent their notation from being read too easily. This may explain why a given star can be represented by multiple glyphs. It also helps explain the combination system <b>outlined</b> <b>above</b> -- while basic characters can be read without difficulty, one would have to master the entire set of basic characters before recognizing the components of combined glyphs. In this way, the meaning would be opaque to anyone without proper training.|$|E
5|$|There {{is also a}} {{considerable}} variety of treatments for alleged attachment disorders diagnosed on the controversial alternative basis <b>outlined</b> <b>above,</b> popularly known as attachment therapy. These therapies {{have little or no}} evidence base and vary from talking or play therapies to more extreme forms of physical and coercive techniques, of which the best known are holding therapy, rebirthing, rage-reduction and the Evergreen model. In general these therapies are aimed at adopted or fostered children with a view to creating attachment in these children to their new caregivers. Critics maintain these therapies are not based on an accepted version of attachment theory. The theoretical base is broadly a combination of regression and catharsis, accompanied by parenting methods which emphasise obedience and parental control. These therapies concentrate on changing the child rather than the caregiver. An estimated six children have died {{as a consequence of the}} more coercive forms of such treatments and the application of the accompanying parenting techniques.|$|E

5|$|In late 945, Tuzun died. His death {{weakened}} the Abbasid government's {{ability to maintain}} its independence against the rising power of the Buyids, who under Ahmad ibn Buya had already consolidated control over Fars and Kerman, and secured {{the cooperation of the}} Barids. Al-Mustakfi's secretary, Ibn Shirzad, tried to confront the Buyids by calling upon Nasir al-Dawla, but Ahmad advanced on Baghdad with his troops, and in January 946 he obtained his appointment as amir al-umara with the honorific Mu'izz al-Dawla ("Strengthener of the State"). To secure their position, the Buyids immediately marched against the Hamdanids. Nasir al-Dawla countered by marching down the eastern bank of the Tigris river and blockading Baghdad. In the end, however, the Buyids defeated the Hamdanids in battle and forced Nasir al-Dawla to retire to Ukbara. From there, Nasir al-Dawla began negotiations with the Buyids, aiming to secure recognition of Hamdanid control over the Jazira, Syria and even Egypt as tributaries of the Caliphate, with the boundary between Buyid and Hamdanid spheres placed at Tikrit. Negotiations were disrupted by a rebellion among the Hamdanids' Turkish troops, but Mu'izz al-Dawla, who for the moment preferred a stable Hamdanid state to anarchy on his northern border, helped Nasir al-Dawla suppress it. The peace was agreed on the terms <b>outlined</b> <b>above,</b> and was affirmed by one of Nasir al-Dawla's sons being taken as a hostage to Baghdad.|$|E

50|$|In the <b>outline</b> <b>above</b> the {{processor}} processes {{parts of a}} single instruction at a time. Computer programs could be executed faster if multiple instructions were processed simultaneously. This is what superscalar processors achieve, by replicating functional units such as ALUs. The replication of functional units was only made possible when the die area of a single-issue processor no longer stretched the limits {{of what could be}} reliably manufactured. By the late 1980s, superscalar designs started to enter the market place.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of the consensus conference of the Canadian Association of Thoracic Surgeons (CATS) was to define the scope of thoracic surgery practice in Canada, to develop standards of practice, to define training and resource requirements {{for the practice of}} thoracic surgery in Canada and to determine appropriate waiting times for thoracic surgery care. A meeting of the CATS membership was held in September 2001 to address issues facing thoracic surgeons practising in Canada. The discussion was facilitated by an expert panel of surgeons and supplemented by a survey. At the end of the meeting, consensus was reached by the membership regarding the issues <b>outline</b> <b>above...</b>|$|R

25|$|A major {{exception}} to the general rule <b>outlined</b> <b>above</b> is exemplified by mycoheterotrophic plants that utilize ectomycorrhizas for their carbon needs. These plants, from the subfamily Monotropoideae, exhibit high specificity for the EcM fungi they parasitize, although different monotrope species target a rather wide array of fungal lineages.|$|E
50|$|This simple storyline {{is hidden}} in multiple, often {{conflicting}} layers, leaving {{the audience with}} doubts what part to believe (and some may even doubt the <b>outline</b> <b>above).</b> Like the beginning of Stoppard's play, the first scene is revealed to be the play the couple is rehearsing, with the additional twist that this play-in-a-play is about an audition and an affair between a director and an actress. The entire first half {{turns out to be}} a wistful version of how Matthew would have liked to expose the affair of his wife, as told to his therapist Frank (whose role can be played by a man or woman).|$|R

30|$|When {{considering}} {{this issue in}} more detail {{it becomes clear that}} signification and document modeling in all discussion related to electronic publishing up to now have basically been coined on the information model prevailing in the empirical sciences. In this model, scientific research as the core activity is completely dissociated from the publication process. Only once ‘research’ has yielded ‘results’ these in turn are ‘packaged’ in discourse and published (typically as a journal article): in this extremely robust and not very complex ‘container’ model of scientific publishing it is perfectly sufficient to remain on ‘emulation level’ as <b>outline</b> <b>above,</b> since the publishing stage is not at the core of scientific work, anyway.|$|R
