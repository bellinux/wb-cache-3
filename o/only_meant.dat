5|$|US-62 was realigned for a {{third time}} on September 4, 1961. This routing was <b>only</b> <b>meant</b> to be temporary, {{following}} Agnew, Exchange, and Reno Avenues to downtown. This change was followed up by the September 4, 1963 rerouting, which put US-62 onto its present-day routing (though I-240 did not exist yet, and I-44 still ended at I-35).|$|E
5|$|As for the BIA's assurance, the Court that <b>only</b> <b>meant</b> {{that the}} {{termination}} act did not terminate the claim, {{not that the}} statute of limitations would not begin to run. Because the Court of Appeals had only held that the statute of limitation did not apply, not that it would not bar the claim if it applied, and the District Court had held the claim barred, the Court remanded to the Court of Appeals to pass on that conclusion of the District Court.|$|E
5|$|Rothschild {{featured}} {{an illustration}} of the Guadeloupe amazon in his 1907 book Extinct Birds by the Dutch artist John Gerrard Keulemans, based on the early descriptions. In 1916, the American ornithologist Robert Ridgway criticised the illustration for differing from Du Tertre's description; Du Tertre supposedly <b>only</b> <b>meant</b> that the proximal primary feathers were yellow, whereas all the covert feathers are yellow in the illustration, apart from a red edge, and the head and underparts are slate.|$|E
50|$|The clay {{animation}} video {{used was}} <b>only</b> ever <b>meant</b> for a showreel, thus one verse was {{cut out of}} the song on the music video.|$|R

5|$|This {{assessment}} was left unchanged for decades, as few players {{at the highest}} level used the Budapest Gambit and information about games from lesser players could not easily be found. During that time, various responses were developed against the 4.Bf4 line; these included 4...g5, invented by István Abonyi, further developed by the masters Bakonyi and Drimer. The master Kaposztas showed that even when White succeeded in his positional plan, it <b>only</b> <b>meant</b> for Black a worse endgame with drawish tendencies. Two pawn sacrifices were also introduced in the variation with 6.Nbd2 (still in the 4.Bf4 line), based on pawn pushes d7–d6 or f7–f6 and a quick attack against b2.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of 4 consists of mid-tempo pieces, {{but unlike the}} filler that might have occupied this pacing on previous albums, many of this album’s greatest strengths lie in this realm. Perhaps best exemplifying this spirit is the André 3000 and Kanye West assisted, 'Party' in which Beyoncé relaxes into a beat that, while {{not be easy to}} grind to, still works perfectly as a party anthem. Beyoncé reminds us that a party is not <b>only</b> <b>meant</b> for dancing. It is a place where you go to enjoy the company of others and oftentimes, that involves real human conversation and interaction. Echoing this sentiment, André’s verse is tranquilized from his customarily rapid-fire delivery to a drawl more reminiscent of Lil’ Wayne than his traditional work with Outkast. 'Party' like much of 4, is a conversation, and André 3000 wants to be heard.|$|E
25|$|Betty White was <b>only</b> <b>meant</b> {{to appear}} in the pilot of the show but was asked to stay on for the entire series. She {{reportedly}} earned $75,000 per episode for the series.|$|E

25|$|Fourth, UNBRO {{assisted}} civilians <b>only.</b> This <b>meant</b> that UNBRO {{expected the}} camps {{to be free}} of military influence of any kind, and that no military activity was to take place in or through UNBRO camps at any time.|$|R
50|$|A {{total of}} 22 aircraft, two prototypes and series {{production}} of <b>only</b> 20 <b>meant</b> the Ikarus 214 was not widely used, flight testing having {{revealed that the}} 214 could not {{meet the requirements of}} a light twin-engine bomber.|$|R
25|$|Young's modulus {{can vary}} {{somewhat}} due {{to differences in}} sample composition and test method. The rate of deformation has the greatest impact on the data collected, especially in polymers. The values here are approximate and <b>only</b> <b>meant</b> for relative comparison.|$|E
25|$|This process uses {{multiple}} diamond-plated, barrel-shaped {{tools to}} finish a bore. The tool has a single layer of diamonds bonded to the tool, with about half of each diamond exposed. These special tools are made to a specific diameter and are <b>only</b> <b>meant</b> {{to open up the}} hole to that size.|$|E
25|$|Soon after, Blair's {{warehouse}} {{apartment is}} blown {{up by the}} drug lab next door, and Jim invites Blair {{to stay with him}} at his loft apartment at 852 Prospect Ave., apartment 307. Blair temporarily brings with him Larry the Ape, the subject of a short-term sociology study. Although the arrangement is <b>only</b> <b>meant</b> to last a week, Blair stays for years.|$|E

50|$|The fifth {{pool was}} small, with only 4 fencers. This <b>meant</b> <b>only</b> one, Langevin, was eliminated.|$|R
25|$|Griffin's {{division}} and the V Corps artillery under Colonel and Brevet Brigadier General Charles S. Wainwright, {{which had to}} carry their four guns forward through the mud, finally stopped the Confederate advance short of crossing Gravelly Run. The Confederates fell back about 400 yards from the run when they met the fire from Griffin and Wainwright, although historian Ed Bearss states that the Confederates <b>only</b> <b>meant</b> to make a forced reconnaissance at the run, not to cross it.|$|E
25|$|Riviére {{refuses to}} quit and orders a Brazilian pilot (William Gargan) {{to take the}} mail to Rio, but the pilot's wife (Myrna Loy) pleads with him not to go. Despite the dangers, the night mail is {{delivered}} on time. The pilot despairs that his flight <b>only</b> <b>meant</b> that someone in Paris can get a postcard on Tuesday instead of Thursday, but its real value is proven when the serum is also delivered and a child is saved.|$|E
25|$|At the time, {{the players}} ascended a podium {{to receive their}} medals and then {{lined up on the}} ice for the playing of the {{national}} anthem, as the podium was <b>only</b> <b>meant</b> to accommodate one person. Only the team captains remained on the podium for the duration. After the completion of the anthem, Eruzione motioned for his teammates to join him on the podium. Today, podiums are not used for ice hockey; the teams line up on their respective bluelines after the final game.|$|E

5000|$|With its 5 ft {{diameter}} {{driving wheels}} this sixth of the BR standard designs was clearly biased towards freight working. An axle-loading of <b>only</b> [...] <b>meant</b> its route availability was virtually unrestricted. Batches were allocated to every BR region except the Western.|$|R

25|$|The {{appearance}} of the crown of thorns in art, notably upon the head of Christ in representations of the Crucifixion or the subject Ecce Homo arises after the time of St. Louis and {{the building of the}} Sainte-Chapelle. The Catholic Encyclopedia reported that some archaeologists had professed to discover a figure of the crown of thorns in the circle which sometimes surrounds the chi-rho emblem on early Christian sarcophagi, but the compilers considered that it seemed to be quite as probable that this was <b>only</b> <b>meant</b> for a laurel wreath.|$|E
25|$|In later interviews, however, Mutalibov {{would go}} on to condemn the Armenians, {{claiming}} that they blatantly misinterpreted his words. He also denied ever accusing the Popular Front of Azerbaijan of having anything to do with these events, saying that he <b>only</b> <b>meant</b> that the PFA took advantage of the situation to focus the popular resentment on him. Mutalibov stated that after the massacre he called the speaker of the Supreme Soviet of NKAO Artur Mkrtchyan, and the latter assured him that the people of Khojaly were given a corridor to escape, and he only referred to Mkrtchyan's words, without making any assertions as to whether the corridor actually existed.|$|E
25|$|In 2015 the Chinese {{government}} {{reacted to}} these complaints and incidents by prescribing {{a set of}} standardized routines for all dancers to follow, claiming they would be culturally unifying and healthier. The move was met with widespread criticism. Some Chinese complained that it did nothing to address the noise issues; others said the dancers {{should be free to}} choose their own routines. The real problem, yet others said, was not only the lack of better places for the dancing but the lack of other social opportunities for the women. The government soon clarified that the routines it created and promoted were <b>only</b> <b>meant</b> to be healthy alternatives to existing ones and were not required.|$|E
50|$|Each Commonwealth Games Association sent {{up to two}} athletes per event, {{including}} one relay team. The age of participating athletes was limited to 16- and 17-year-olds <b>only.</b> This <b>meant</b> that for 2011 athletes must have been born in 1994 or 1995 to be eligible to take part.|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{did they}} mean, then? They could <b>only</b> have <b>meant</b> to delay us. And {{why should they}} wish to delay us? What could it matter to them if we gave our message {{an hour or two}} sooner or an hour or two later? It could not matter." ...|$|R

25|$|Enslaved {{women on}} {{plantations}} were often {{given the same}} work as men. Slaveholders often put slave women to work alongside men in the grueling atmosphere of the fields but were aware of ways to exploit them with regards to their gender as well. Choosing between the two was regularly a matter of expediency for the owners. In both small and large estates women were heavily involved in fieldwork, {{and the chance to}} be exempted in favor of domestic work was a privilege. Their roles in reproduction were still emphasized by owners, but often childbirth <b>only</b> <b>meant</b> that the physical demands of the field were forced to coexist with the emotional and physical pull of parenthood.|$|E
25|$|During the 1999 season BAR {{announced}} that Honda was to supply them with engines beginning in 2000. The Honda deal not <b>only</b> <b>meant</b> they would supply engines but that Honda staff {{would work with}} the team at their Brackley base. Honda had planned to enter Formula One as a factory team, but relented. It {{was the first time}} Honda had been directly involved in Formula One since 1992. BAR did not have exclusive use of Honda engines, though, as Jordan Grand Prix were using Mugen Honda units. The following year Jordan were given factory Honda engines, but the engine manufacturers could not supply two teams forever. This prompted a battle between BAR and Jordan for the use of Honda engines in the long term.|$|E
25|$|The regular {{competition}} {{began in}} the 1965–66, named the Shell Shield (after sponsors Royal Dutch Shell), and the five teams that had contested the 1961 knock-out competed in a round-robin league, with two home matches and two away matches for each team. This format and name remained until 1981–82, when the Combined Islands were split by the West Indies Cricket Board, but that <b>only</b> <b>meant</b> that the season was lengthened to five games a team. Barbados won most of the early tournaments, with nine titles of a possible 14 from 1965–66 to 1979–80, before the Combined Islands won their first title in 1980–81 after four runners-up spots in the preceding six seasons – becoming {{the last of the}} five teams to win a title.|$|E
