Pilots can connect using their flight simulator and the built-in pilot client, IvAp. All pilots and ATC thereby interact on a dedicated, one-world server environment that tries to simulate world-wide air traffic on an [...] "as real as it gets" [...] basis.While the largest part of IVAO's active membership is based in Europe, new divisions are continually being created to spread the network coverage world-wide.|$|E

[...] The organization has achieved notability for its very high level of participation and realism, that has seen it in use as part of Federal Aviation Administration funded research projects. This notability resulted in the organization being featured on the front page of The Wall Street Journal in 2006.
