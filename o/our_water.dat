25|$|Opposition to the {{agreement}} has been centered with two main groups: Protect <b>Our</b> <b>Water</b> and Environmental Rights (POWER), an environmental organization, and local farmers from the Imperial Valley. POWER has argued for traditional methods of water conservation, such as reuse and recycling in urban areas {{in place of a}} transfer of water from the Salton Sea. The salinity of the lake has increased substantially, and conservationists argue that this has damaged the surrounding ecosystem. Restoration efforts have been championed by local politicians, as the Salton Sea is prominent for being the largest man-made lake in California.|$|E

That year, very few fish had returned to the Stanislaus to spawn; in an editorial for MyMotherLode, Mark Truppner wrote: [...] "Biologists estimate that it will affect the offspring of about 29 steelhead trout in the Stanislaus River – a few hundred smolts [...] almost all of which will be eaten by predators long before they reach the ocean.

60|$|Regarding {{the winter}} abode of the swordfish, {{conjecture}} is useless. I have already discussed this question at length {{with reference to}} the menhaden and mackerel. With the swordfish the conditions are very different. The former are known to spawn in <b>our</b> <b>waters,</b> and the schools of young ones follow the old ones in toward the shores. The latter do not spawn in <b>our</b> <b>waters.</b> We cannot well believe that they hibernate, nor is the hypothesis of a sojourn in the middle strata of mid-ocean exactly tenable. Perhaps they migrate to some distant region, where they spawn. But then the spawning-time of this species in the Mediterranean, as is related in a subsequent paragraph, appears to occur in the summer months, at the very time when the swordfish are most abundant in <b>our</b> own <b>waters,</b> apparently feeling no responsibility for the perpetuation of their species.|$|R

500|$|MPC {{additionally}} {{worked on}} the disappearing waterfall that serves as Jennifer's grave when she is killed {{at the beginning of}} the film. They transformed the mysterious waterfall into a whirlpool. [...] "We came up with an approach that we thought would work because we had a lot of confidence in <b>our</b> <b>water</b> sims", stated Nordby. [...] "The waterfall appears both as a day and night shot, so we had to integrate with the water. And the night shots play a pivotal role in the film, and we do a huge crane over." [...] They could not lock it to a pan or to a tilt and filming the shots was difficult due to the actual base of the waterfall being out of reach. Nordby said, [...] "I eventually lowered down a shot—a ton of reference of the area because I knew we'd have to do some digi-matte work to recreate the basin that the whirlpool ends up in." [...] They soon realized that there was an insufficient amount of churning and foam to read as real as the location. The CG Supervisor, Pete Dionne, presented a different idea. [...] "He grabbed chunks of that river and tialing it so that it had a nice stretch of birds' eye point of view of the water that existed on the location in the lighting situation we were trying to match", stated Nordby. [...] "And then he projected that onto a whirlpool of animated sprites and had similar enough texture to the actual water that existed there, but pulled control into lighting it and could add depth mainly to the center of it." [...] Dealing with [...] "very shallow" [...] water, the team had to take extra care when filming the scenes.|$|E

Brad Jennings, a tentative supporter of the agreement, notes that [...] "There are things most agree on: The Salton Sea must be saved. No matter how you feel about water transfers you know that a dead Sea would be an environmental disaster for us. And <b>our</b> <b>water</b> rights and water allotment must be protected.
