5|$|At {{the inauguration}} of its new {{assembly}} line, the 767's <b>order</b> <b>backlog</b> numbered approximately 50, only enough for production to last until 2013. Despite the reduced backlog, Boeing officials expressed optimism that additional orders would be forthcoming. On February 24, 2011, the USAF announced its selection of the KC-767 Advanced Tanker, an upgraded variant of the KC-767, for its KC-X fleet renewal program. The selection followed two rounds of tanker competition between Boeing and Airbus parent EADS, and came eight years after the USAF's original 2003 announcement of its plan to lease KC-767s. The tanker order encompassed 179 aircraft and was expected to sustain 767 production past 2013.|$|E
5|$|On July 27, 2016, in its {{quarterly}} {{report to the}} Securities and Exchange Commission, Boeing discussed the potential termination of 747 production due to insufficient demand and market for the aircraft. With a firm <b>order</b> <b>backlog</b> of 21 aircraft and a production rate of six per year, program accounting {{has been reduced to}} 1,555 aircraft, and the 747 line could be closed {{in the third quarter of}} 2019. In October 2016, UPS Airlines ordered 14 -8Fs to add capacity, along with 14 options, which doubles its official backlog of 15 – including some to refractory airlines – and could extend production by two more years.|$|E

Most of the chemical plants are located in Ramat Hovav, the Haifa Bay area and near the Dead Sea. Israel Chemicals is one of largest fertilizer and chemical companies in Israel and its subsidiary, the Dead Sea Works in Sdom is the world's fourth largest producer and supplier of potash products. The company also produces other products such as magnesium chloride, industrial salts, de-icers, bath salts, table salt, and raw materials for the cosmetic industry. One of the country's largest employers is Israel Aerospace Industries which produces mainly aviation, space, and defense products. In 2017 the company had an <b>order</b> <b>backlog</b> of 11.4 billion US dollars.

The good <b>order</b> <b>backlog</b> also created problems and risks. After 1915 raw material availability became worse {{and the prices}} increased due to the war. The situation worsened in 1917, when strikes, rioting and general disorder increased in many Finnish cities. The workers in Finland demanded working day {{to be limited to}} eight hours; when unruly and armed Russian soldiers joined to support the Finnish workers in April, the employers' association agreed the demands. This calmed down the environment for the summer, but new troubles followed in the autumn. The atmosphere became restless and the company managers were threatened. The Russian Provisional Government was overthrown in the October Revolution and in middle of November a general strike emerged in Finland. Although the strike lasted only for some days, workload was reduced because the Russian military did not place new orders in the chaotic situation and also getting the payment for the ongoing repairs became uncertain. Also the high inflation of the Russian ruble ate the viability.|$|E

500|$|From 2003, {{the demand}} for new ships started to grow, {{resulting}} in 2007 in a record breaking <b>order</b> <b>backlog</b> for shipyards, exceeding their capacity with rising newbuilding prices as a result. This resulted in a glut of ships when demand dropped due to a weakened global economy and dramatically reduced demand in the United States. The charter rate for very large crude carriers, which carry two million barrels of oil, had peaked at $309,601 per day in 2007, and has dropped, as of 2012, to $7,085 per day, far below the operating costs of these ships. [...] As a result, several tanker operators laid up their ships. Prices rose significantly in 2015 and early 2016, but delivery of new tankers was projected to keep prices in check.|$|E

2500|$|Overall {{demand for}} the 747-8 {{turned out to be}} below Boeing's initial {{projections}} as well, which led to several reductions in production rate.

40|$|We empirically {{examine the}} {{association}} between downstream firms’, i. e., customers’ capital market information quality, and the operating performance of upstream firms, i. e., suppliers.

We hypothesize and find a positive association between customers’ capital market information quality and suppliers’ operating performance measured by the DuPont profitability ratios. The association is stronger for suppliers with higher sales volatility, no <b>order</b> <b>backlogs,</b> customers who are less dependent on their input, and shorter business relation with customers. Collectively, the results suggest that the quality of information provided by the customers to the capital market has a spillover effect in the input market, i. e., helps the suppliers improve their performance...|$|R

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the growth of {{production}} planning in the Dutch Hoogovens Steel Company.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis analyzes whether {{the quality of}} earnings concept can be usefully employed in the security analysis of defense contractors. Background is provided by an extensive {{review of the literature}} relevant to quality of earnings. Since the quality of earnings concept is very subjective, specific quantitative measures of quality of earnings are developed and used in a statistical analysis to validate the variables as explanatory predictors of a firm's price earnings (P/E) ratio. The statistical techniques employed include Pearson's Product Moment Correlation, Spearman's Rank Order Correlation, stepwise regression and other multiple linear regression models. Results of the study suggest that there are significant relationships between several hypothesized quality of earnings variables and a firm's P/E ratio. The statistically significant variables in the final regression models explain between 67. 8 % and 76. 6 % of the variation in the P/E ratio. The evidence indicates that variables related to cash flow, degree of government business, <b>order</b> <b>backlogs</b> and earnings stability reflect aspects of a firm's quality of earnings.

The Avolon paper found that the effect of the Neo and Max models on the value of their predecessors will be limited by the sheer number of current-generation craft in use today and the high portion of the global aircraft fleet approaching retirement. The authors predict that sharper rises in passenger numbers in developing countries will fuel demand for both Neo and Max models, but also, importantly, current-generation aircraft as airlines seek to add capacity but find themselves at the end of long lines for the new models.

40|$|Proceedings Paper (for Acquisition Research Program) The U. S. {{aerospace}} {{and defense}} industry (ADI) is largely dependent on its U. S. government defense customer. Because of the vital yet specialized {{nature of that}} market, {{the health of the}} ADI should be assessed periodically to enable government and industry leaders to understand clearly how and to what extent changes to its capacities and capabilities can be forecast and incorporated in their policy deliberations for better decisions. It is widely assumed that changes in defense spending will affect ADI market health, but in fact, our research indicates that although true for four decades after 1950, the comfortable predictive connection between ADI equity valuations and defense spending underwent changes with the shift in ADI industry structure for the largest companies in the 1990 s, and can challenge interpretation even at present. The role of large company <b>order</b> <b>backlogs</b> appears to significantly mediate the modern predictive relationship. The analysis used the ADI market health indexes by NDBI, indexes which are based on a representative industry sample of 97 companies divided by assets sizes for the entire 1950 '' 2012 interval.

40|$|Random walks {{have been}} used {{extensively}} within operations research models such as inventory systems and single-server queues to estimate performance measures. In this paper, we use sample-path analysis to express the steady-state probability of a one-sided regulated random walk to increase and be above a threshold, {{referred to as the}} last-come-first-serve (LCFS) backlog probability. We approximate the LCFS backlog probability under mild assumptions on the distribution of the random walk’s steps and provide its exact expression when the steps are exponentially distributed, and a closed-form approximation when the steps are normally distributed. In our numerical experiments, the average relative gap between the approximated LCFS backlog probabilities and their simulated values is 5. 13 %. We further show that the LCFS backlog probability is an upper bound on the loss probability—the probability that a two-sided regulated random walk is at a boundary. This bound is tighter than the backlog probability—the probability that a random walk ever crosses a threshold— that also bounds the loss probability. In an inventory application, we demonstrate that using the LCFS backlog probability rather than the backlog probability reduces the inventory level required to satisfy a service-level constraint on the percentage of <b>orders</b> <b>backlogged.</b> In our examples, this reduction leads to cost savings of 31 % on average.

40|$|A {{supplier}} has {{a periodic}} review inventory system that provides several lead-time options to its customers. The inventory {{replenishment lead time}} is a multiple of the inventory review cycle. Customers are classified into two groups: short lead-time customers requiring the product immediately and long lead-time customers who allow the supplier the flexibility to deliver immediately or in the next cycle. We consider an inventory-commitment problem, in which the supplier allocates its on-hand inventory to these two groups of customers. When inventory runs out, the supplier <b>backlog</b> <b>orders</b> to future cycles. Therefore, the supplier faces two problems: how the onhand inventories are allocated between two classes of customers and how the <b>backlogged</b> <b>orders</b> are cleared when replenishments arrive? We consider the former as an inventory-commitment problem, and resolve the latter with priority rules. We formulate the inventory commitment decision as a dynamic programming problem, and study three priority rules in clearing backlogs.
