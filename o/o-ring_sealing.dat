This paper describes both the hardware and the software used to gather data as well as the methods developed to analyze the data. The RSRM is assembled from four casting segments. Each of the field joints between these segments is sealed with three o-rings. These o-rings are critical for the proper operation of the motor. After launch the booster segments are recovered and reused. As part of the refurbishment process the <b>o-ring</b> <b>sealing</b> surfaces are inspected for any irregularities. The system developed uses a combination of commercial and customized hardware and software. The system uses two computer systems in a real time environment to control a laser, an XYZ precision table, and case rotation and position information. The system is capable of inspecting both the tang end and the clevis end of the RSRM field joint. The o-ring grooves and flat sealing surfaces are inspected...|$|E

40|$|The {{space shuttle}} Challenger {{accident}} investigation {{focused on the}} failure of a tang-clevis joint on the right solid rocket motor. The existence of relative motion between the inner arm of the clevis and the <b>O-ring</b> <b>sealing</b> surface on the tang has been identified as a potential contributor to this failure. This motion can cause the O-rings to become unseated and therefore lose their sealing capability. Finite element structural analyses have been performed to predict both deflections and stresses in the joint under the primary, pressure loading condition. These analyses have demonstrated the difficulty of accurately predicting the structural behavior of the tang-clevis joint. Stresses {{in the vicinity of the}} connecting pins, obtained from elastic analyses, considerably exceed the material yield allowables indicating that inelastic analyses are probably necessary. Two modifications have been proposed to control the relative motion between the inner clevis arm and the tang at the <b>O-ring</b> <b>sealing</b> surface. One modification, referred to as the capture feature, uses additional material on the inside of the tang to restrict motion of the inner clevis arm. The other modification uses external stiffening rings above and below the joint to control the local bending in the shell near the joint. Both of these modifications are shown to be effective in controlling the relative motion in the joint...|$|E

40|$|Experimental {{validation}} of analytical model. The {{objective of this}} study was to validate existing analytical models of the friction force and leakage for <b>O-ring</b> <b>seals</b> at high pressure, where high pressure is defined as 2000 psi. A set of three pistons with 9, 6, and 4 mm bore were used in this experiment. Each piston had a single <b>O-ring</b> <b>seal</b> located in the cap end. To validate the friction force model, the force efficiency was measured by exerting a load on a piston and collecting pressure, load, and displacement measurements during constant piston descent. To validate the leakage model, a static leakage test was performed by measuring the displacement of the piston after being exposed to a constant load for an extended amount of time. Results indicated that the friction force efficiency model was valid for a range of pressures between 500 and 2000 psi, which indicates that the model for O-ring friction holds at high pressure. Results from the leakage test showed that the piston moved close to 600 microns during the first 12 hours of testing and did not move for the remaining 36 hours. This indicates that <b>O-ring</b> <b>seals</b> are leak-free, so the volumetric efficiency can be approximated to be 100 %.

Limited seal leakage testing is performed on full-sized rocket motor segment seals, a pre-Challenger short stack, providing comparison of bore seals to test specimen bore and face seals.

40|$|Large {{solid rocket}} motors, as {{found on the}} Space Shuttle, are {{fabricated}} in segments for manufacturing considerations, bolted together, and sealed using conventional Viton <b>O-ring</b> <b>seals.</b> Similarly the nine large solid rocket motor nozzles are assembled from several different segments, bolted together, and sealed at six joint locations using conventional <b>O-ring</b> <b>seals.</b> The 5500 F combustion gases are generally kept a safe distance away from the seals by thick layers of phenolic or rubber insulation. Joint-fill compounds, including RTV (room temperature vulcanized compound) and polysulfide filler, are used to fill the joints in the insulation to prevent a direct flow-path to the O-rings. Normally these two stages of protection are enough to prevent a direct flow-path of the 900 -psi hot gases from reaching the temperature-sensitive <b>O-ring</b> <b>seals.</b> However, in the current design 1 out of 15 Space Shuttle solid rocket motors experience hot gas effects on the Joint 6 wiper (sacrificial) O-rings. Also worrisome {{is the fact that}} joints have experienced heat effects on materials between the RTV and the O-rings, and in two cases O-rings have experienced heat effects. These conditions lead to extensive reviews of the post-flight conditions as part of the effort to monitor flight safety. We have developed a braided carbon fiber thermal barrier to replace the joint fill compounds in the Space Shuttle solid rocket motor nozzles to reduce the incoming 5500 F combustion gas temperature and permit only cool (approximately 100 F) gas to reach the temperature-sensitive <b>O-ring</b> <b>seals.</b> Implementation of this thermal barrier provides more robust, consistent operation with shorter turn around times between Shuttle launches...|$|R
