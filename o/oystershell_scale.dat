50|$|Over {{one hundred}} and fifty host plant species are known for the <b>oystershell</b> <b>scale</b> {{including}} members of the families Aceraceae, Betulaceae, Caprifoliaceae, Celastraceae, Elaeagnaceae, Grossulariaceae, Hydrangeaceae, Juglandaceae, Oleaceae, Pyrolaceae, Rosaceae, Salicaceae and Tiliaceae. Apart from forest trees and ornamentals, the <b>oystershell</b> <b>scale</b> is a pest of apples, pears, plums, peaches, apricots, mulberries and currants. It infests trunks and branches but is not found on leaves. Heavy infestations can kill branches and even cause trees to die.|$|E
50|$|Lepidosaphes ulmi {{also known}} as apple mussel scale or <b>oystershell</b> <b>scale</b> is a scale insect that is a pest of trees and woody plants. The small insects attach {{themselves}} to bark and cause injury by sucking the tree's sap; this metabolic drain on the plant may kill a branch or the entire tree.|$|E
5|$|This {{nuthatch}} is omnivorous, eating {{insects and}} seeds. It places large food {{items such as}} acorns or hickory nuts in crevices in tree trunks, and then hammers them open with its strong beak; surplus seeds are cached under loose bark or crevices of trees. The diet in winter may be nearly 70% seeds, but in summer it is mainly insects. The insects consumed by the white-breasted nuthatch include caterpillars, ants, and pest species such as pine weevils, <b>oystershell</b> and other <b>scale</b> insects, and jumping plant lice. This bird will occasionally feed on the ground, and readily visits feeding stations for nuts, suet and sunflower seeds, the last of which it often takes away to store. The white-breasted nuthatch was also observed visiting raccoon latrines {{in order to find}} seeds.|$|R
50|$|Aphytis mytilaspidis was {{introduced}} into Mauritius in 1983 {{in an attempt}} to control Melanaspis glomerata on sugar cane but did not become established. In California, this wasp has been used successfully to control fig scale (Lepidosaphes conchiformis). In Mediterranean areas it is used against <b>oystershell</b> <b>scale</b> (Lepidosaphes ulmi) and in many countries against pine needle scale (Phenacaspis pinifoliae) and aspidistra scale (Pinnaspis aspidistrae).|$|E
50|$|The {{crawlers}} {{are vulnerable}} {{to a number of}} pesticides but adult oystershell scales are protected by their waxy scales which repel water. Use of horticultural oils may overcome this problem but control is still difficult. In gardens, trunks and branches may be scrubbed and heavily infested wood pruned out and removed. In some parts of the world, populations are controlled to a certain extent by the <b>oystershell</b> <b>scale</b> parasitoid, Aphytis mytilaspidis and the ladybird Chilocorus bipustulatus.|$|E
50|$|The adult female <b>oystershell</b> <b>scale</b> {{is up to}} four millimetres long, elongated, {{tapering}} to a {{point at}} the posterior end and often slightly curved, somewhat resembling a mussel shell. The upper side is a banded, brown, waxy scale and the underside is cream coloured. There are no eyes or legs and the short antennae have only a single segment. The mandibles are lengthened into a stylet adapted for sucking sap. The female lays about one hundred oval white eggs, retaining them under her body, and then dies. Her scale darkens in colour and stays in place, protecting the eggs over the winter. They can survive temperatures as low as -32 Â°C. They hatch in the spring at {{about the time the}} host plant's buds are bursting. The crawlers are tiny and disperse on the host, each one looking for a suitable protected site with thin bark in which to settle, remaining in that place permanently after sinking the stylet into the host plant's vascular tissues. The crawler moults twice before becoming an adult female, forming a protective scale from larval exuviae and secretions. Some crawlers may develop into males. These undergo four moults and the adult males have eyes, three pairs of legs, one pair of wings, a head and a body divided into a thorax and abdomen. Not all colonies produce males and bisexual and parthenogenetic populations are known.|$|E
40|$|The <b>oystershell</b> <b>scale</b> {{belongs to}} a group of insects called the armored scales. The adult insect is {{enclosed}} in a shell made up of its own shed skins and waxy secretions. Under this covering is a sac-like animal that is quite different in appearance from most insects. It has no legs, eyes, or antennae...|$|E
40|$|The {{control of}} apple pests In Nova Scotia has {{developed}} into an arduous and expensive process [ [...] . ] The {{study of the}} effects of the spray program on the natural control of <b>oystershell</b> <b>scale</b> which forms the basis of this thesis is in turn a part of the whole general ecological approach to the study of orchard pests in Nova Scotia. During the course of these experiments it became very evident that time and space are two very important factors to be considered in the investigation of orchard insect problems. The spray program which has been followed in an orchard in the years before an experiment is started has an important conditioning effect on the experiment. This can only be overcome by using the experimental materials on the same trees for several years in succession. Single row plots are limited in long term studies by the differential ability of the various species to migrate from one plot to another. The importance of the failure to consider the over-all effect of a spray program is illustrated by the advocation of elemental sulphur sprays for commercial orchards on the sole basis of their fungicidal value without relation to their effects on all other organisms As a result of these investigations it is now known that sulphur sprays inhibit natural control of <b>oystershell</b> <b>scale</b> while bordeaux mixture, Fermate or no spray at all will allow natural control agents to eliminate <b>oystershell</b> <b>scale...</b>|$|E

40|$|Anumber of {{brands of}} tar washes and a home-made {{emulsion}} of American creosote oil were investigated as regards their constitution, effects on insects and toxicity to trees. The chemical constitution as regards distillation range, acid content, {{and types of}} washes are briefly discussed. At the proper dilutions these emulsions seem to be effective against rosy aphis, <b>oystershell</b> <b>scale,</b> San Jose scale, and pear psylla; also, they were reasonably efficient against the eye-spot bud moth. They {{did not seem to}} give any control against plum curculio, apple seed chalcid, apple leafroller, pomaria leafhopper of the apple, and had only a slight effect upon apple red bugs. While no permanent injury was observed to apple trees, mixtures containing more than 8 per cent of tar oils were generally quite destructive to swelling buds even tho they had not reached the silver-tip stage. Mixtures containing less than 8 per cent tar oils varied in destructiveness to buds according to dilution and variety of apple, but in no instance was the damage severe as regards the set of fruit. A 4 per cent mixture did not injure the swollen buds of pear or peach in limited tests. Mixtures o...|$|E
