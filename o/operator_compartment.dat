40|$|Previous {{work in our}} laboratory(1) had demonstrat-ed {{that most}} rhesus monkeys refrained form {{operating}} a device for securing food if this caused another monkey to suffer an electric shock. The present experiments were designed to investigate some of the determinants of this "altruistic " behavior. EXPERIMENTAL METHOD A 5 X 5 X 2 ft. masonite and plexiglass box was divided in the middle by a half-silvered screen that blocked vision only from the right (stimulus) to the left (<b>operator)</b> <b>compartment.</b> The latter was equipped with red and blue signal lights, two chains suspended from ceiling microswitches, a food tube and a water cup; the right compartment was bare except for floor and wall grids attached to a Grason-Stadler E 6070 B constant cur-rent shock source and scrambler. Eight male and 7 female feral rhesus monkeys (Os) were separately trained in the <b>operator</b> <b>compartment</b> to secure a 0. 7 gm. pellet of food by pulling one chain {{in response to a}} red light and the other chain to a blue one, each of 5 sec. duration and occurring in random order at irregular intervals ranging from a mean of 15 sec.; this training was continued until the responses were 90 % correct with less than 20 unsignalled reactions in 2 con-secutive sessions. A "stimulous animal " (SA) was then placed in the right compartment for 3 sessions while the O continued to feed on signal; however, on the 4 th day one of the chanins was programmed also to administer a 3 sec., 5 ma high-frequency shock to the SA. Each O was run with a given SA until, again in 2 consecutive sessions, either (i), the O selected the non-shoc...|$|E
40|$|The U. S. Bureau of Mines is {{developing}} a computer model to analyze the human factors aspect of mining machine operator compartments. The model {{will be used as}} a research tool and as a design aid. It will have the capability to perform the following: simulated anthropometric or reach assessment, visibility analysis, illumination analysis, structural analysis of the protective canopy, operator fatigue analysis, and computation of an ingress-egress rating. The model will make extensive use of graphics to simplify data input and output. Two dimensional orthographic projections of the machine and its <b>operator</b> <b>compartment</b> are digitized and the data rebuilt into a three dimensional representation of the mining machine. Anthropometric data from either an individual or any size population may be used. The model is intended for use by equipment manufacturers and mining companies during initial design work on new machines. In addition to its use in machine design, the model should prove helpful as an accident investigation tool and for determining the effects of machine modifications made in the field on the critical areas of visibility and control reach ability...|$|E
40|$|A new machine {{system has}} been {{developed}} and evaluated for holing soil in large polybag operation at oil palm nursery to overcome the labor shortage problem especially during transplanting oil palmseedling process from pre-nursery to the main nursery. Currently, as reported by Pebrian et;al (2014), holing soil in large polybag using manual system by cylindrical borer during transplanting oil palm seedling consumed higher demand human energy and havebeen identified as the factor of tiredness among the worker in oil palm nursery. Faculty Plantation and Agrotechnology (FPA) Team Research have been developed new machine holing soil to overcome these problem. The machine system consist of main chasis, <b>operator</b> <b>compartment</b> {{and a pair of}} drilling unit (150 mm) with powered by 11 HP (8. 25 KW) diesel engine. The performance of the machine have been evaluated and compared with published journal by manual system in term of production capacity and human energy expenditure while the comparison of cost production made based on the interviews from oil palm nursery producer. The mechanized system showed the average of production capacity of 256 bag per man per hours or increasing 49. 21 % compared to manual system. Reduction of human energy expenditure and cost production with 4. 35 kcal per min per man or 38. 70 % and RM 0. 02 per bag was obtained by mechanized system against manual system operated using cylindrical core borer. In short, the new mechanized system has great potential to overcome the limitation of labor shortage and increasing the productivity in oil palm nursery plantation...|$|E

The A.S.39 had a unique crew configuration with the observer accommodated in the nose with clear-vision windows on three sides and the pilot's compartment raised to allow passage to the radio <b>operator's</b> <b>compartment.</b> Four small 130 hp Pobjoy Niagara V seven-cylinder air-cooled radial engines were mounted on the wings. This maximized propwash over the wing giving extra lift at low speed. The wings could be folded for storage when used on an aircraft carrier.|$|R
50|$|The earlier S.55 carried its {{empennage}} {{on a pair}} of open, flat, triangular girders {{constructed from}} tubes, one from each hull. The S.63 used a similar arrangement, allowing its single, unusually wide hull to be short. Its bottom had a shallow, concave V-section and a single step. Lateral stability on the water was provided by outward-leaning, V-bottomed floats mounted a little outside the centre-section. The original bomber version had derensive ring-mounted machine gun positions in the nose and behind the trailing edge. A forward entrance led to the pilots' side-by-side open cockpit, offset to the left and ahead of the wing leading edge. The airliner conversion separated the pilots into two symmetrically positioned, enclosed cockpits and introduced a windowed 3 × 3 m passenger cabin behind the cockpit which seated ten. Behind it there was a space for luggage and a wireless <b>operator's</b> <b>compartment</b> with access to the engines.|$|R
50|$|The early RDF {{developments}} in Canada {{were at the}} Radio Section of the National Research Council of Canada. Using commercial components and with essentially no further assistance from Britain, John Tasker Henderson led a team in developing the Night Watchman, a surface-warning system for the Royal Canadian Navy to protect {{the entrance to the}} Halifax Harbour. Successfully tested in July 1940, this set operated at 200 MHz (1.5 m), had a 1 kW output with a pulse length of 0.5 μs, and used a relatively small, fixed antenna. This was followed by a ship-borne set designated Surface Warning 1st Canadian (SW1C) with the antenna hand-rotated {{through the use of a}} Chevrolet steering wheel in the <b>operator's</b> <b>compartment.</b> The SW1C was first tested at sea in mid-May 1941, but the performance was so poor compared to the Royal Navy's Model 271 ship-borne radar that the Royal Canadian Navy eventually adopted the British 271 in place of the SW1C.|$|R
5000|$|On 30 September 1951, while {{returning}} from a prearranged tryst with a girlfriend in Seattle, Eastwood was in the radar <b>operator's</b> <b>compartment</b> of an Douglas AD-1Q dive bomber that crashed into the Pacific Ocean off the Point Reyes Peninsula near San Francisco. The aircraft had departed from Sand Point Naval Air Station near Seattle, bound for northern California. During the flight, the rear door would not stay closed, the oxygen system proved inoperable, and the navigation systems and intercom failed. Eventually, during the late afternoon, the plane ran out of fuel and the pilot was forced to ditch the aircraft in the sea several miles off Point Reyes. Both Eastwood and the pilot were uninjured and Eastwood was able to swim to shore using a life raft. He later reflected on his thoughts during the crash, [...] "I thought I might die.

General Safety • Operators should be trained by a knowledgeable person prior to operating a skid steer loader. This should include reading/understanding the owner’s manual, operational safety, and demonstration of safe operation under anticipated conditions (e. g., terrain, load, etc.). • Never by-pass or disable the safety devices. • Before operating, clear the work area of by-standers and acquaint yourself with surrounding hazards (e. g., electrical lines, low clearance, uneven terrain, ramp edges, etc.). • Consult EHS to determine if hearing protective devices are warranted while operating the equipment...|$|R
50|$|The B-25 Mitchell is a {{twin engine}} medium bomber and the B-25 had two Wright R-2600-13 Double Cyclone fourteen-cylinder {{air-cooled}} radials, rated at 1700 hp each for takeoff and 1500 hp at 2400 rpm. Equipped with Holley 1685HA carburetors or Bendix Stromberg carburetors. The B-25 {{is named after}} General Billy Mitchell {{and is the only}} American military aircraft named after a specific person. The B-25 can be flown by a six-person crew. The B-25 has multiple turrets. The plane has one in the front or also known as the bombardier’s compartment and there is also another turret known as the upper turret. Then there is another turret that is in the radio <b>operator's</b> <b>compartment</b> and the gunner is known as the waist gunner. Then the last turret is in the tail and the gunner is known as the tail gunner. Another important bit of information is that each turret had at least two 50 caliber machine guns and each gun ammo capacity was from three hundred to four hundred rounds. Also this plane can deliver up to 4,000 pounds (1800 kg) of bombs and some could carry 8 × 5 in (127 mm) high velocity aircraft rockets.|$|R
40|$|The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has {{observed}} that many control rooms and <b>operator</b> <b>compartments</b> in the U. S. mining industry {{do not have}} filtration systems capable of maintaining low dust concentrations in these areas. In this study at a mineral processing plant, to reduce respirable dust concentrations in a control room that had no cleaning system for intake air, a filtration and pressurization system originally designed for enclosed cabs was modified and installed. This system was composed of two filtering units: one to filter outside air and one to filter and recirculate the air inside the control room. Eighty-seven percent of submicrometer particles were reduced by the system under static conditions. This means that greater than 87 percent of respirable dust particles should be reduced as the particle-size distribution of respirable dust particles is {{greater than that of}} submicrometer particles, and filtration systems usually are more efficient in capturing the larger particles. A positive pressure near 0. 02 inches of water gauge was produced, which is an important component of an effective system and minimizes the entry of particles, such as dust, into the room. The intake airflow was around 118 cfm, greater than the airflow suggested by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) for acceptable indoor air quality. After one year, the loading of the filter caused the airflow to decrease to 80 cfm, which still produces acceptable indoor air quality. Due to the loading of the filters, the reduction efficiency for submicrometer particles under static conditions increased to 94 percent from 87 percent.

40|$|Standup {{forklift}} trucks are extensively used primarily for material handling in high density warehouses. These forklifts {{over the years}} have been involved in severe accidents causing injuries and taking lives of the operator and that of people on the floor. The major accidents involving these trucks are tip-over, off the dock accidents, compartment intrusions and under the rack injuries. The objective of the work is to analyze the accident data and to provide a conceptual design to ensure safety of the operator riding the standup {{forklift trucks}}. The operator is assumed to be safe when retained within the compartment {{similar to that of the}} safe space environment of a sit down forklift truck or tractors. Thus a door on the standup forklift would provide a safer compartment. This design would help in preventing severe injuries to the operator in case of any accidents. The important criterion of this design is to provide a door with latch and slide mechanism to ensure easy egress and ingress of the <b>operator.</b> The <b>compartment</b> is designed ergonomically for 95 th percentile industrial male population. The accident data is studied by performing statistical and failure analysis. Weibull plots are fitted for life time distribution data and are found to be of increasing rate.

40|$|THESIS 9253 Since {{metabolic}} pathways {{constitute a}} complex system, a mathematical description, even a structural one, must be simplified. Yet, the model must be sufficiently general {{so that it}} will encompass the system that is to be represented. An approach is presented for representing metabolic reaction systems. It uses simple object bipartite graphs, with event operators (mediators of events) representing one species and non-operators (the non-mediators in events) the other. Edge colours describe relations between the two species and shared objects connect events together. The operators (e. g., enzymes) are integral components of the system interacting with the non-operators (e. g., substrates). This facilitates inclusion of receptors and transporters (operators), and effectors (non-operators) in the same model. A membrane <b>operator</b> separates two <b>compartments</b> and mediates the transport of compounds between them. Furthermore, enclosing a sequence of events between two membrane operators represents compartmentalisation of that sequence. Extended operators can include additional information such as the species and chromosome. Non-enzymatic reactions are included in the model by treating the activation energy as the operator. An operator in one event may be a non-operator in another, and vice versa. This is useful for addressing conceptual issues such as representing an enzyme as substrate (e. g., phosphorylation) or a metabolite (e. g., cyclic AMP) as mediator in a signal transduction pathway...|$|R
