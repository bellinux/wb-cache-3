5|$|After Wollstonecraft's death, her widower {{published}} a Memoir (1798) of her life, revealing her unorthodox lifestyle, which inadvertently destroyed her reputation {{for almost a}} century. However, with the emergence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>feminist</b> movement {{at the turn of}} the twentieth century, Wollstonecraft's advocacy of women's equality and critiques of conventional femininity became increasingly important. Today Wollstonecraft is regarded as one of the founding feminist philosophers, and feminists often cite both her life and work as important influences.|$|E
5|$|Durkheim, Marx, and the German theorist Max Weber (1864–1920) are {{typically}} {{cited as the}} three principal architects of sociology. Herbert Spencer, William Graham Sumner, Lester F. Ward, W. E. B. Du Bois, Vilfredo Pareto, Alexis de Tocqueville, Werner Sombart, Thorstein Veblen, Ferdinand Tönnies, Georg Simmel and Karl Mannheim are often included on academic curricula as founding theorists. Curricula also may include Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Marianne Weber and Friedrich Engels as founders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>feminist</b> tradition in sociology. Each key figure {{is associated with a}} particular theoretical perspective and orientation.|$|E
5|$|Feminist {{views on}} {{sexuality}} vary, and have differed by historical period and by cultural context. Feminist attitudes to female sexuality {{have taken a}} few different directions. Matters such as the sex industry, sexual representation in the media, and issues regarding consent to sex under conditions of male dominance have been particularly controversial among feminists. This debate has culminated in the late 1970s and the 1980s, in {{what came to be}} known as the feminist sex wars, which pitted anti-pornography feminism against sex-positive feminism, and parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>feminist</b> movement were deeply divided by these debates. Feminists have taken a variety of positions on different aspects of the sexual revolution from the 1960s and 70s. Over the course of the 1970s, a large number of influential women accepted lesbian and bisexual women as part of feminism.|$|E

5|$|Mary Shelley {{was born}} as Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin in Somers Town, London, in 1797. She {{was the second}} child <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>feminist</b> philosopher, educator, and writer Mary Wollstonecraft, and the first child of the philosopher, novelist, and {{journalist}} William Godwin. Wollstonecraft died of puerperal fever shortly after Mary was born. Godwin was left to bring up Mary, along with her older half-sister, Fanny Imlay, Wollstonecraft's child by the American speculator Gilbert Imlay. A year after Wollstonecraft's death, Godwin published his Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1798), which he intended as a sincere and compassionate tribute. However, because the Memoirs revealed Wollstonecraft's affairs and her illegitimate child, they were seen as shocking. Mary Godwin read these memoirs and her mother's books, and was brought up to cherish her mother's memory.|$|E
5|$|Pro-{{feminism}} is {{the support}} of feminism without implying that the supporter is a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>feminist</b> movement. The term is most often used in reference to men who are actively supportive of feminism. The activities of pro-feminist men's groups include anti-violence work with boys and young men in schools, offering sexual harassment workshops in workplaces, running community education campaigns, and counselling male perpetrators of violence. Pro-feminist men also {{may be involved in}} men's health, activism against pornography including anti-pornography legislation, men's studies, and the development of gender equity curricula in schools. This work is sometimes in collaboration with feminists and women's services, such as domestic violence and rape crisis centres.|$|E

Logan (Jason Dohring) requests that Veronica stop looking into the serial rapist case, but she denies and they fight. The Hearst board of trustees is going {{to decide whether or not}} to shut down the fraternities, but an important member, Selma Rose, goes missing in the middle of the party. Dean O’Dell (Ed Begley, Jr.) immediately believes that she’s gone missing, asking Veronica and Keith to help. Veronica speaks to one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>feminist</b> Lilith House girls, while Keith speaks to Selma’s husband. Veronica poses as a reporter to get news from Sheriff Lamb (Michael Muhney) on the case. Veronica speaks to Dick (Ryan Hansen), who says that Chip Diller had a Roman numeral easter egg implanted in his anus, and Veronica suspects the Lilith House girls.|$|E

25|$|Atwood, who was {{surrounded}} by the intellectual dialogue of the female faculty members at Victoria College, often portrays female characters dominated by patriarchy in her novels. She also sheds light on women's social oppression as a result from patriarchal ideology. Still, Atwood denies that The Edible Woman, published in 1969 and coinciding with the early second wave <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>feminist</b> movement, for example, is feminist, and claims that she wrote it four years before the movement. Atwood believes that the feminist label can only be applied to writers who consciously work within the framework <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>feminist</b> movement.|$|E
