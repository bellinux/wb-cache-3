Under {{pressure of the}} attention from the program, Van der Sloot voluntarily checked into a psychiatric clinic before departing for Thailand. He moved to Muang Ake, a suburb of Bangkok, to study business at Rangsit University, but dropped <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>bought</b> Sawadee Cup, a restaurant next to the campus that served sandwiches and pizza.|$|E
25|$|After coming west in 1909 as a hired-hand {{with the}} Regina Capitals {{to compete against}} the New Westminster Salmonbellies in their {{challenge}} for the Minto Cup, playing as a defenceman, Lalonde then decided to remain in British Columbia when Vancouver Lacrosse Club president Con Jones offered him a fortune of a contract rumoured {{in the range of}} $3,500 (or $72,000 in modern currency); this was more than double what he was earning with the Montréal Nationals the previous season. To compete against that perennial powerhouse squad of legends and hated rivals, New Westminster Salmonbellies, Con Jones went <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>bought</b> the best player in Canada that money could buy: Newsy Lalonde.|$|E
500|$|In 2005 Black {{released}} Drinkin' Songs and Other Logic. [...] Black {{chose the}} title of the album to limit himself to simple topics in his past. He explained: [...] "I went <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>bought</b> all the music I grew up on that I didn't already have and spent three months listening to only that. Only stuff from before I started making records, so it was pre-1989—Waylon, Willie, Buck Owens, Haggard, Don Williams, Jim Croce. And what I discovered was a simplicity in song that I had moved away from. It was quite an emotional journey because these were all the songs that moved me and inspired me to do what I've been doing ever since." ...|$|E

500|$|In a December 2012 interview, Winkelman {{expressed}} some regret {{about what}} had happened. [...] "I'm not {{proud of the way}} this club came to exist, and I am totally prepared to be the villain of the piece, but I can't put the genie back in the bottle," [...] he said. [...] "Do I think it was right? No. Do I think it was a great thing that happened to Wimbledon? No... I don’t feel in the right over the way this club was born. But I don’t think I could live with myself if I hadn't gone <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>bought</b> the club when it was hours away from liquidation. It was about to be completely finito... What happened was my fault, and I have to take responsibility for it. But I don’t see why my players, staff and our young supporter base should be forced to carry the can and live with the nastiness, it's nothing to do with them." ...|$|E
500|$|Scott and Charlene had {{problems}} {{during their first}} 12 months together and they broke up several times. One such break-up occurred after Charlene's mother thought she should date other boys, while Scott had to repeat his final year of school without her. Scott was initially unsure how to win Charlene back, but after speaking with his grandmother, Helen (Anne Haddy), who mentioned that her husband gave her a friendship ring, Scott went <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>bought</b> one for Charlene. While they were enjoying a barbecue at Charlene's caravan by Lassiter's lake, the couple argued about Charlene spending time with Warren Murphy (Ben Mendelsohn) and Scott decided to leave. When Charlene started to go after Scott, she found herself trapped by a fire that had been accidentally started by Greg Davis (Alex Papps). Greg had been storing petrol under the caravan and spilled it as he was removing the cans, causing the petrol to head towards the still burning barbecue. Scott rescued [...] "a terrified" [...] Charlene from the flames, but an explosion threw them both {{to the ground and}} Charlene was knocked unconscious.|$|E
500|$|Although {{a gifted}} {{engineer}} Brindley had {{no formal education}} and rarely, if ever, committed his designs to paper. When questioned by the parliamentary committee about {{the composition of the}} puddle he frequently referred to in his evidence, he had a mass of clay brought into the committee room. He then formed the clay into a trough and showed how it would only form a watertight seal if it had been worked with water to form puddle. [...] "Thus it is" [...] said Brindley [...] "that I form a watertight-trunk to carry water over rivers and valleys wherever they cross the path of the canal." [...] Later, when asked to produce a drawing of the bridge or aqueduct he proposed to build, he replied that he had no representation of it on paper but would demonstrate his intention by use of a model. He then went <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>bought</b> a large round of Cheshire cheese, which he divided into two equal halves saying [...] "Here is my model". Then, to the amusement of the committee, he used the two halves of cheese to represent the semicircular arches and laid a long, rectangular object over the top to demonstrate the position of the river flowing under the aqueduct and the canal flowing over it.|$|E

500|$|Steve Kloves was {{selected}} to write the screenplay. He described adapting the book as [...] "tough", as it did not [...] "lend itself to adaptation {{as well as the}} next two books." [...] Kloves often received synopses of books proposed as film adaptations from Warner Bros., which he [...] "almost never read", but Harry Potter jumped out at him. He went <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>bought</b> the book, and became an instant fan of the series. When speaking to Warner Bros., he stated that the film had to be British, and had to be true to the characters. Kloves was nervous when he first met Rowling as he did not want her to think he was going to [...] " [...] her baby." [...] Rowling admitted that she [...] "was really ready to hate this Steve Kloves," [...] but recalled her initial meeting with him: [...] "The first time I met him, he said to me, 'You know who my favourite character is?' And I thought, You're gonna say Ron. I know you're gonna say Ron. But he said 'Hermione.' And I just kind of melted." [...] Rowling received a large amount of creative control, an arrangement that Columbus did not mind.|$|E

2500|$|Hoppus and {{his girlfriend}} at this time lived in a {{basement}} apartment, barely scraping together funds to pay rent. With money in savings, Hoppus went <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>bought</b> his first professional equipment: a new amp and bass cabinet. He came home {{and his girlfriend}} proceeded to argue with him, angry that he spent money on something they did not need. [...] "I just kept telling her {{that this was what}} mattered to me, this was my life," [...] Hoppus recalled. She demanded he make a choice between the band and her, which resulted in Hoppus leaving the band shortly after formation. Shortly thereafter, DeLonge told Hoppus he had borrowed a four track recorder from a friend and was preparing to record a demo tape, which prompted Hoppus to break up with his girlfriend and return to the band. Flyswatter—a combination of original songs and punk covers—was recorded in Raynor's bedroom and landed the band their first shows. Three more demos were recorded over the course of 1993 and the band began performing its irreverent live show at local all-ages venue SOMA, which alerted local independent label Cargo Music. Cargo signed the band on a trial basis, and Hoppus was the only member to sign the contract, as DeLonge was at work at the time and Raynor was still a minor. During this time, Hoppus lived at home in San Diego at his mother's, where the band would prepare cassette demos and the entire family would fold cassette inserts. Raynor, whose parents moved to Reno, Nevada, stayed with Hoppus in summer 1994.|$|E

Lord kept this particular Hammond C3 {{until his retirement}} from the band in 2002, when he passed it to successor Don Airey. That instrument was retired from stage use a few years later, as it had become [...] "pretty knackered" [...] according to Airey.|$|R
5000|$|I {{used to play}} a Guild {{custom built}} guitar and the airline lost it on our first American tour in '64 or '65. ... I {{had to get a}} {{replacement}} quick. I went into a store and they didn't have anything I liked. I saw this dusty old guitar case and I said [...] "What have you got in there?" [...] he said [...] "Oh, that's just some silly old guitar." [...] He got it <b>out</b> <b>and</b> I <b>bought</b> it for about $60.|$|R

6000|$|... "I can't be rude to a woman," [...] {{said the}} steward, with a melancholy smile; [...] "if I could, {{my life would}} ha' been very different. She's always {{stepping}} across to ask my advice about Teddy, or something o' that sort. All last week she kept borrowing my frying-pan, so at last by way of letting 'er see I didn't like it I went <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>bought</b> 'er one for herself. What's the result? Instead o' being offended she went <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>bought</b> me a couple o' neck-ties. When I didn't wear 'em she pretended it was because I didn't like the colour, and she went and bought two more. I'm wearing one now." ...|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1980s the Albions {{servicing}} {{on the route}} were aging and needed replacements. However, no other suitable single-deckers in the KMB fleet were available at that time. KMB turned to its double deckers, but again none was suitable for the steep inclination of the route. so KMB fitted a Cummins LT10 280 hp engine and a manual decelerator into a 9.7m MCW Metrobus. The solution worked <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> KMB <b>bought</b> eight more 9.7m MCW Metrobuses (M81-M88) with special air-drawing fans to serve Route 51 with special limitation of 3 standing passengers for the safety issues.|$|R

In the early 1880s Wilhelm's grandson, Christian Thams {{returned}} from Switzerland and took over the running of the mining company. He realised that to make money from mining, he had to purchase the largest mine of the all, but didn't succeed until 1896 when it no longer was feasible to manually pump <b>out</b> the water, <b>and</b> <b>bought</b> Løkken Mine.|$|R

Finally, when I was sixteen, I left home. I just went <b>out</b> the door <b>and</b> <b>bought</b> my own house."

6000|$|Devine laughed. [...] "It's quite easy. You {{have just}} about sense enough to worry anybody, or you wouldn't have dumped that ore into the Dayspring, and worked {{off one of}} the richest mines in the {{province}} on to me. Well, when I saw you meant to strike me on the Canopus, I just let you get to work because it suited me. I figured it would keep you busy while I took <b>out</b> timber-rights <b>and</b> <b>bought</b> up land round the Dayspring. Nobody believed in Allonby, and I got what I wanted at quite a reasonable figure. I'm holding the mine and everything worth while now. There's nothing left for you, and I guess it would be wiser to get hold of a man of your own weight next time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{exactly what}} I did," [...] John agreed, smiling. [...] "I had a {{sovereign}} {{in my pocket}} when I had <b>bought</b> my ticket; <b>and</b> by the time I had paid for my dinner on the train, and tipped the men--well, I hadn't a great deal left to go shopping with. I stayed at the St. Pancras Hotel, and telephoned to my solicitor before I got up this morning to have him send me some money. The joke of it was," [...] he went on, joining in the girls' laughter, [...] "that Mr. Appleton has been worrying me for months {{to come up and}} talk over reinvestments, and take control of the money my uncle left me; and when I came at last, I arrived like a pauper.

60|$|Though he {{was some}} years my senior, {{we were about}} the same size--if any thing, I was larger than he; so, with a little stretching, a shirt, vest, and pantaloons were soon found to suit.

60|$|There was {{a little}} haggling over the terms; for {{it would have been}} {{altogether}} contrary, to Indian usages, to have agreed to any price without demur.
