5|$|Scotland Yard {{suspected}} Martin {{of having}} separately killed two men from south London: financial adviser Timothy MacDowall and accountant William Shackel. In Mexico, Martin had discussed {{with his wife}} about going scuba diving with MacDowall, who was taking scuba lessons while <b>on</b> <b>holiday</b> on an island off Belize. MacDowall disappeared in Belize in early 1995 but police could not conclusively match him to body parts later found in that country; the only suspicious activity they uncovered was the transfer of £21,000 from MacDowall's bank account to an account in San Francisco under Martin's name. MacDowall {{is believed to have}} been murdered as he slept and his remains thrown into a crocodile-infested river. Martin refused to be interviewed by Scotland Yard while he was on death row in Changi Prison, thus whether he killed MacDowall remains unconfirmed. Shackel was reported missing while <b>on</b> <b>holiday</b> in Cancún, Mexico. Police reports said that Martin was in Cancún the day Shackel cashed traveller's cheques worth £4,000, after which he disappeared.|$|E

5|$|He was bailed {{from the}} police station on 13 September, after which he went <b>on</b> <b>holiday</b> to Saint-Tropez. Before leaving England, he {{returned}} to the farmhouse, gaining entry by the downstairs bathroom window. He said he did this because he had left his keys in London and needed some papers from the house for the trip to France; he entered through the window rather than borrow keys from the farm's housekeeper who lived nearby. When he returned to England on 29 September, he was re-arrested and charged with the murders.|$|E

The drama focused on a British married couple, whose son goes missing while they are <b>on</b> <b>holiday</b> in France, and the subsequent years of enquiry trying to find answers {{as to what happened}} to their son and why. Incidentally, Nesbitt and Karyo had appeared previously together in the Martin Sheen film The Way (2010).|$|E
5|$|In April 2013, Sutton met Kevin Spacey's filmmaker-in-residence Grigorij Richters while rehearsing {{as part of}} {{the drummer}} group for the opening {{ceremony}} of the 2013 UEFA Champions League final at Wembley Stadium.

30|$|In our experiments, {{we prefer}} to add {{improvements}} based on the VLAD method because VLAD is compact and extensible. T-embedding and democratic aggregation [21] method achieves 0.756 (mAP) <b>on</b> <b>Holidays</b> in our experiment, which {{is better than the}} result of SDEVLAD. Hence, we also attempted the combination of SDE with T-embedding descriptors. Our SDE further increases the result of T-embedding [21] <b>on</b> <b>Holidays</b> to 0.763 (mAP) and shows considerable compatibility. Compared with SDEVLAD, T-embedding [21] achieves better results <b>on</b> <b>Holidays</b> and Oxford. However, the computation of T-embedding [21] is complicated. And T-embedding did not obtain a satisfying result when reduced to 128 -dimensional compared with SDEVLAD in [21].|$|R

5|$|In February 1959, formal {{authority}} for beginning construction was granted. However, while Menzies was <b>on</b> <b>holiday,</b> some {{officials from the}} Department of Treasury convinced ministers to withhold money needed for the lake, so {{the start of the}} construction was delayed. Once it started, progress was fast. At its peak, the number of people physically working on the construction in the lakes was between 400 and 500. John Overall, the Commissioner of the NCDC, promised Menzies that the work would be finished within four years, and he succeeded, despite the Prime Minister's scepticism. Equipment was quickly requisitioned.|$|E

5|$|Pink Floyd {{had already}} experimented with filming outside {{the context of}} a {{standard}} rock concert, including an hour-long performance in KQED TV studios in April 1970.
