40|$|BACKGROUND: RNA {{interference}} (RNAi) is {{an effective}} tool to examine the function of individual genes. Carboxylesterases (CarE, EC 3. 1. 1. 1) are known to play significant roles in the metabolism of xenobiotic compounds in many insect species. Previous studies in our laboratory found that CarE expression was up-regulated in Aphis gossypii (Glover) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) adults of both <b>omethoate</b> and malathion resistant strains, indicating the potential involvement of CarE in organophosphorus (OP) insecticide resistance. Functional analysis (RNAi) is therefore warranted to investigate the role of CarE in A. gossypii to OPs resistance. RESULT: CarE expression in <b>omethoate</b> resistant individuals of Aphis gossypii was dramatically suppressed following ingestion of dsRNA-CarE. The highest knockdown efficiency (33 %) was observed at 72 h after feeding when dsRNA-CarE concentration was 100 ng/µL. The CarE activities from the CarE knockdown aphids {{were consistent with the}} correspondingly significant reduction in CarE expression. The CarE activity in the individuals of control aphids was concentrated in the range of 650 - 900 mOD/per/min, while in the individuals of dsRNA-CarE-fed aphids, the CarE activity was concentrated in the range of 500 - 800 mOD/per/min. In vitro inhibition experiments also demonstrated that total CarE activity in the CarE knockdown aphids decreased significantly as compared to control aphids. Bioassay results of aphids fed dsRNA-CarE indicated that suppression of CarE expression increased susceptibility to <b>omethoate</b> in individuals of the resistant aphid strains. CONCLUSION: The results of this study not only suggest that ingestion of dsRNA through artificial diet could be exploited for functional genomic studies in cotton aphids, but also indicate that CarE can be considered as a major target of organophosphorus insecticide (OPs) resistance in A. gossypii. Further, our results suggest that the CarE would be a propitious target for OPs resistant aphid control, and insect-resistant transgenic plants may be obtained through plant RNAi-mediated silencing of insect CarE expression...|$|E

The valley of Zendan is located in Arhab Destrict, Sana’a Governorate, Yemen. The valley is about 50 km north-east of Sana’a city and this geographical area is a large producer of Qat (Catha edulis Forsk); the plant which {{most of the people in}} the country chew. In this study the valley divided into three stations, each station contained three treated substations and three control substations. The control substations selected from the farms, which are historically free from pesticides. Due care has been taken to insure that the treated sub-stations were from the closest area to the control substations. The average use of Dimethoate 40 % E. C is 1 - 2 ml/L water. The treatment replication was 1 - 3 times within the period of 2 - 3 weeks. In this study also, we analyzed the total concentration of Dimethoate, and its metabolite; <b>Omethoate</b> in the soil layer of 0 - 15 cm.

Research was conducted to investigate the influence of organophosphorus pesticide concentration, exposure duration and temperature on the amount of chemical permeating the gloves. <b>Omethoate,</b> an organophosphorus pesticide typically used in horticulture and home gardens, was investigated. American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) permeation cells were used to test gloves used by South Australian ambulance workers; neoprene gloves (0. 07 mm thickness) and nitrile gloves (0. 11 mm thickness), individually and in combination.

40|$|Organophosphorus (OP) {{pesticide}} toxicity is {{a global}} health problem. Respiratory failure due to neuromuscular transmission dysfunction accounts for about 300, 000 deaths annually in rural Asia. However, the clinical manifestation is complex, and {{described in terms of}} acute, intermediate, and chronic syndromes. The underlying mechanism of toxicity is still unclear. OP pesticides contain inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), for example dimethoate, emulsified in an organic solvent, typically cyclohexanone. A hypothesized mechanism is initial excitotoxicity through inhibition of acetylcholinesterase followed by failure of neuromuscular synaptic transmission. I tested this electrophysiologically in vitro by measuring properties of spontaneous miniature endplate potentials (MEPPs) and evoked endplate potentials (EPPs) in isolated sciatic nerve/flexor digitorum brevis muscles from mice, bathed in HEPES-buffered mammalian physiological saline (MPS). Muscle action potentials were abolished with μ-conotoxin (2 μM). First, we tested the effects of plasma taken from Göttingen minipigs instilled orally (isofluorane anaesthesia) with a formulated pesticide (2. 5 ml/kg) whose active ingredient is dimethoate dissolved in cyclohexanone. This plasma abolished evoked synaptic transmission and increased spontaneous MEPP frequency within 60 - 180 minutes of bath application. However plasma from minipigs instilled with dimethoate alone produced no failure of transmission. Plasma contained either pesticide or dimethoate significantly increased the half decay time of EPPs. However, pesticide-plasma also contained the metabolites <b>omethoate</b> (100 μM) and cyclohexanol (5 mM). We found that bath application of <b>omethoate</b> alone caused a potent dose-dependent increase in EPP decay time. Cyclohexanol (5 mM) also increased EPP decay time but it also decreased both the excitability of axons and MEPP amplitude. In combination, <b>omethoate</b> and cyclohexanol produced greater disruption of neuromuscular transmission than either dimethoate or cyclohexanone, alone or in combination and this was particularly evident in isometric tension recordings, in which prolonged after-contraction and slow relaxation were observed during and immediately following tetanic stiumuation in the presence of <b>omethoate</b> and cyclohexanol. Voltage-clamp recordings of endplate currents (EPC) partially supported the EPP observations. Surprisingly, cyclohexanol-treated preparations showed no significant increase in EPC and MEPC decay time. However, there was some evidence of activity-dependent decline in MEPC amplitude in cyclohexanol while quantal content in these preparations showed evidence of an increase suggesting a homeostatic response in evoked transmitter release with cyclohexanol treatment. Analysis of presynaptic currents in cyclohexanol treated preparations also revealed preliminary evidence of sensitivity to cyclohexanol compared to control preparations. Finally, I tested the effects NMJ transmission of 24 hr exposure to OP pesticide and its metabolites using a novel organ culture system, utilising a mouse mutant (WldS) with a slow nerve degeneration phenotype. After incubation of 24 hrs with MPS + pesticides and metabolites, these muscles showed significant reduction in function (response to nerve stimuli with EPP/action potential ± MEPPs) compared to control cultures. Together, the data indicate that failure of neuromuscular transmission by pesticide-plasma cannot be explained solely by dimethoate-mediated inhibition of acetylcholinesterase. Rather, a combination of metabolic breakdown products exerts potent, harmful presynaptic and postsynaptic effects. Either blocking the metabolic conversion of the constituents of OP pesticides, or transiently blocking their effects on receptors may therefore be an effective strategy for treatment of OP pesticide toxicity...|$|E

This paper summarises recent research on 17 OP insecticides in the River Wuchuan, an important catchment in China, by determining their concentrations in water, soil, sediment and plants by gas chromatography with flame photometric detection (GC-FPD). The concentrations of the total OP insecticides ranged from 92. 77 to 229 ng l(- 1) in river water, 1. 61 to 9. 93 ng g(- 1) dry weight in soil, 1. 24 to 7. 56 ng g(- 1) dry weight in sediment and 75. 28 to 326 ng g(- 1) dry weight in plants. There was a relatively high abundance of methamidophos, dichlorvos, malathion, <b>omethoate</b> and dimethoate in all water, soil, sediment and plant samples.

Using single factor experiment and orthogonal experiment, the conditions of best cleaning effect were flour water concentration for 3. 5 g per 500 mL water, soaking time for 17 min, soaking temperature for 32 ℃, and the pesticide removal rate reached to 83 %. A good linear range was obtained between 0. 8 ~ 32. 0 μg/mL, and the linear equation was Y = 0. 011 X- 0. 005 with correlation coefficient of 0. 9955, the limit of detection was 0. 8 μg/mL. Conclusion It is effective to reduce pesticide residues on the fruits and vegetables by using flour water, and the method is simple, convenient and cheap, and suitable for use in daily life...|$|E
40|$|A method {{based on}} liquid {{chromatography}} (LC) -mass spectrometry (MS) /MS {{was developed for}} sensitive determination {{of a number of}} less gas chromatography (GC) -amenable organophosphorus pesticides (OPs; acephate, methamidophos, monocrotophos, <b>omethoate,</b> oxydemeton-methyl and vamidothion) in cabbage and grapes. For extraction, several solvents were evaluated with respect to the possibility of direct injection, matrix-induced suppression or enhancement of response, and extraction efficiency. Overall, ethyl acetate was the most favourable solvent for extraction, although a solvent switch was required. For some pesticide/matrix combinations, reconstitution of the residue after evaporation required special attention. Extracts were analysed on a C 18 column with polar endcapping. The pesticides were ionised using atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation on a tandem mass spectrometer in multiple reaction monitoring mode. The final method is straightforward and involves extraction with ethyl acetate and a solvent switch to 0. 1 % acetic acid/water without further cleanup. The method was validated at the 0. 01 and 0. 5 mg/kg level, for both cabbage and grapes. Recoveries were between 80 and 101 % with R. S. D. < 11 % (n= 5). The limit of quantification was 0. 01 mg/kg and limits of detection were between 0. 001 and 0. 004 mg/kg. © 2003 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|It was {{demonstrated}} that {{four out of}} six of the very polar organophosphorus pesticides (OPs), i. e. acephate, methamidophos, monocrotophos, <b>omethoate,</b> oxydemeton-methyl and vamidothion, could not be extracted from water using commonly available SPE cartridges. In addition, GC analysis on all six compounds {{was found to be}} troublesome due to their polar and thermolabile character. This initiated the development of an alternative highly sensitive and selective method for the determination of the above mentioned very polar OPs in water, based on LC-MS. Large volume (1 ml) water samples were directly injected onto an RP 18 HPLC column with a polar endcapping. The latter was essential for obtaining retention and maintaining column performance under 100 % aqueous conditions during the sampling. The compounds were ionized using atmospheric pressure chemical ionization and detected on a tandem mass spectrometer operated in multiple reaction-monitoring mode. The detection limits were in the range of 0. 01 - 0. 03 μg/l. Compared to conventional GC methods, the developed LC-MS procedure is very straightforward, fast and more reliable. This application demonstrates the applicability of LC-MS for analysis of polar OPs in surface, ground and drinking water, as a more favourable alternative to GC. © 2001 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|This study {{concerns}} {{the first attempt}} to prepare molecularly imprinted polymers for the selective recognition of dimethoate using an iniferter polymerization technique (Inif-MIP). The synthesized polymers were fully characterized. SEM micrographs show a large accessibility to the binding sites with a significant improvement in MIP morphology. Inif-MIPs displayed high adsorption capacity (Q = 5. 3 mg g 1). The selectivity of this imprinting system was also assessed by means of cross-selectivity assays and the results obtained show that Inif-MIP displays a high selectivity for dimethoate, whereas some structural analogues (<b>omethoate,</b> malathion and methidathion) are poorly retained (6. 3 – 28. 7 %) or not retained at all (fenthion). Inif-MISPE methodology was implemented by packing Inif-MIPs particles into a Solid Phase Extraction (SPE) cartridge and the loading, washing and eluting steps were optimized. The suitability of this sample preparation technique was demonstrated, as concentrations of dimethoate close to the tolerated maximum residue limits in the olive oil samples could be satisfactorily analyzed with good precision and accuracy. Some remarkable characteristics, like the sorbent reusability (at least 20 cycles without the lost of selectivity), low solvent consumption, reduced sample handling and, moreover higher recovery rates reaching 88 % could be ascribed to the Inif-MISPE methodology...|$|E
40|$|Dimethoate (DMT), a {{commonly}} used organophosphorus pesticide, {{is of great}} concern because of its toxicity and potentially harmful effects on water sources. The elimination of DMT {{as well as the}} toxicity and persistence of the byproducts formed during DMT degradation is most important for the safety of drinking water. This study first determined the reaction kinetics of DMT with free chlorine (FC) under typical water treatment conditions. The reaction between DMT and FC proceeded rapidly, exhibiting first-order with respect to each reactant. The degradation of DMT by FC was highly pH dependent, and the pseudofirst-order rate constant decreased obviously from 0. 13 to 0. 02 s(- 1) with an increase in pH from 7. 0 to 8. 3. Bromide ion accelerated the reaction by acting as a catalyst, and the accelerated reaction rate was linearly proportional to the bromide concentration. As a ubiquitous component in natural waters, humic acid also increased the reaction rate. However, the presence of ammonium inhibited the degradation of DMT due to its rapid converting FC to chloramines. <b>Omethoate</b> (OMT) was identified as an important byproduct of DMT chlorination, but only accounted for ca. 28 % of the DMT degraded; and other two organic byproducts were also identified. The acute toxicity of DMT solution increased after treatment with FC due to the formation of more toxic byproducts (e. g. OMT). (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The {{screening}} of suitable insecticides {{is a key}} factor in successfully applying trunk injection technology to ornamental plants. In this study, six chemical pesticides were selected and injected into the trunks of Osmanthus fragrans to control the nettle caterpillar, Latoia lepida (Lepidoptera: Limacodidae), using a no-pressure injection system. The absorption rate of the insecticides, the leaf loss due to insect damage, and the mortality and frass amount of L. lepida larvae were evaluated after 77 and 429 days. The results showed that 4 % imidacloprid + carbosulfan and 21 % abamectin + imidacloprid + <b>omethoate</b> had the fastest conductivity and were completely absorbed into the trunkswithin 14 days; however, the efficiencies of these insecticides in controlling L. lepidawere extremely low. Additionally, the treatment 10 % emamectin benzoate + clothianidin and 2. 5 % emamectin benzoate was almost completely absorbed within 30 days and exhibited a longer duration of insecticide efficiency (> 80 % mortality) in the upper and lower leaves of the canopy. Treatment with these insecticides also resulted in significantly lower leaf loss and frass amounts. We conclude that emamectin benzoate and emamectin benzoate + clothianidin have a rapid uptake into O. fragrans, and are effective as insecticides over long durations. Hence, they may be a suitable control option for L. lepida in O. fragrans plants...|$|E
40|$|The Water Framework Directive 60 / 2000 /EG (WFD) {{requires}} Environmental Quality Standards (EQS) for polluting substances. Member States {{have to set}} {{objectives for}} individual surface water bodies (Article 4 WFD). The transitional period for Directive 2006 / 11 /EC ended in 2013. Therefore, revision, adoption {{and implementation of the}} EQS for the substances on the "Indicative list of main pollutants" (see Annex VIII WFD) is needed to assess the status of the surface waters. In this context, the Federal Environmental Agency (UBA) initiated a project to update the environmental quality standards (EQS) for 10 pollutants (pollutants specific for river basin according to Ordinance on the Protection of Surface Waters (OGewV)) and to compile suggestions for environmental quality standards for 20 new chemicals. The searched data were documented data sheets according to the "Guidance Document No. 27 : Technical Guidance for Deriving Environmental Quality Standards" (EC, 2011). The derivation of EQS for the matrices to be considered was performed in accordance with the rules as laid down in the "Guidance Document No. 27 ". Within this project EQS proposals were derived for the following 30 substances: 2. 4 -D, arsenic, bezafibrate, carbamazepin, carbendazim, chloroacetic acid, chromium, dibutyltin, dimethoate, dimoxystrobin, epichlorhydrin, erythromycin, flufenacet, flurtamone, imidacloprid, copper, metoprolol, monobutyltin cation, monolinuron, nicosulfuron, <b>omethoate,</b> triphenyl phosphate, phoxim, roxithromycin, sulcotrione, sulfamethoxazole, tetrabutyltin, triclosan, uranium, zinc...|$|E
40|$|Surface-enhanced Raman {{scattering}} (SERS) spectra {{are presented}} and analyzed for two important organophosphate pesticides, dimethoate (DMT) and <b>omethoate</b> (OMT). Very detailed SERS spectra {{were obtained by}} aggregated Ag hydrosols, both in aqueous suspension and dried on a glass substrate. The SERS and ordinary Raman spectra of DMT do not resemble each other, suggesting that a chemical reaction immediately occurs when DMT is adsorbed onto the metal surface. We propose that the reaction product is OMT, which is the oxygen analog of DMT, {{on the basis of}} the Raman and SERS spectra of OMT. Further support is derived from the calculated Raman spectra of DMT and OMT. Minor wavenumber and intensity differences that are observed between the SERS spectra of DMT reaction product and those of OMT could be related to different metal/adsorbate interaction modes. The results can be useful in the development of new analytical methods for the determination of pesticide residues in food. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
