The {{trouble is that}} there is no one near me who cares whether I ever do any more work <b>or</b> <b>not...</b> <b>I</b> feel the artist in me is dying and the dying is an agony... only one's self knows the craving and the best part in one is aching unsatisfied.|$|E
5|$|I {{asked him}} not {{to go into that}} field, that you were going there. He laughed at the idea of being {{restricted}} to any locality and said he intended to go whether I aided him <b>or</b> <b>not.</b> <b>I</b> was anxious to secure the cooperation of such a worker as an honor to my corps. I could not be responsible for the field he selected in as much as I pay him no salary and a portion of his expenses. You will see therefore that while it is not a pleasant thing to work in competition with others it seems almost a necessity. You can sympathize.|$|E

I decided to make myself a good case history of such a human being and it meant that I could not be judge of what was valid to put in <b>or</b> <b>not.</b> <b>I</b> must put everything in, so I started a very rigorous record.|$|E

Many were willing to give him advice but he felt the decision was ultimately his own. Individuals fear making a decision because of external opposition but this need not stop one from making a decision so long as one has the capacity to learn through experience whether the decision was a good decision for one's self.|$|R

And I think therefore taking all those circumstances in view... I think it is quite conceivable that they did go for the summit... I certainly would love to think that they actually reached the summit of Everest. I think it is a lovely thought and I think it is something, you know, gut emotion, yes I would love them to have got there.

[...] His turn in Desperate Hours as antagonist showed a darker Morse. He later starred in The Indian Runner and The Crossing Guard.

Killebrew said that his first home run in the Majors was his favorite, coming off Billy Hoeft at Griffith Stadium. He said of it, [...] "Frank House was the catcher. When I came to the plate, he said, 'Kid, we're going to throw you a fastball.' I didn't know whether to believe him <b>or</b> <b>not.</b> <b>I</b> hit it out. It was one of the longest home runs I ever hit. As I crossed the plate, House said, 'That's the last time I ever tell you what pitch is coming'." ...|$|E
500|$|Poe {{claimed he}} wrote [...] "Al Aaraaf" [...] {{before he was}} 15 years old, though he would later adapt his claim. A few {{passages}} from the poem were first published in the May 19, 1829, issue of the Baltimore Gazette signed [...] "Marlow". Poe first offered the complete poem to publishers Carey, Lea & Carey in Philadelphia around May 1829. He wrote to them, [...] "If the poem is published, succeed <b>or</b> <b>not,</b> <b>I</b> am 'irrecoverably a poet.' But to your opinion I leave it". He met with Isaac Lea, {{who was willing to}} publish it so long as they were protected against any loss. Poe asked his foster-father John Allan to subsidize the printing but, not supportive of Poe's literary pursuits, he refused. By July 28, Poe wrote to the publishers asking for the return of his manuscript because, as he said, he had [...] "made a better disposition of my poems than I had any right to expect".|$|E
500|$|She met a young poet, Nikolay Gumilev, on Christmas Eve in 1903. Gumilev, {{encouraged}} her to write and pursued her intensely, making numerous marriage proposals starting in 1905. At 17 years old, in his journal Sirius, she published her first poem which could be translated as [...] "On his hand you may see many glittering rings", (1907) signing it [...] "Anna G." [...] She soon became known in St Petersburg's artistic circles, regularly giving public readings. That year, she wrote unenthusiastically to a friend, “He has loved me for three years now, and I {{believe that it is}} my fate to be his wife. Whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>I</b> love him, I do not know, {{but it seems to me}} that I do.” [...] She married Gumilev in Kiev in April 1910; however, none of Akhmatova’s family attended the wedding. The couple honeymooned in Paris, and there she met and befriended the Italian artist Amedeo Modigliani.|$|E
40|$|Finding {{the right}} {{name for a}} {{specimen}} involves two major issues. First, {{there is the question}} of nomenclature-what names are appropriate designations for species?

Secondly, {{there is the question of}} systematics - are these two forms different enough to deserve recognition as separate species, genera, etc. ...|$|R

500|$|Cope {{took his}} sinking {{fortunes}} in stride. In writing to Osborn about the articles, {{he laughed at}} the outcome, saying, [...] "It will now rest largely with you whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>I</b> am {{supposed to be a}} liar and am actuated by jealousy and disappointment. I think Marsh is impaled on the horns of Monoclonius sphenocerus." [...] Cope was well aware of his enemies and was carefree enough to name a species after a combination of [...] "Cope" [...] and [...] "hater", Anisonchus cophater. Through his years of financial hardship, he was able to continue publishing papers—his most productive years were 1884 and 1885, with 79 and 62 papers published, respectively. The 1880s marked the publication of two of the best-known fossil taxa described by Cope: the pelycosaur Edaphosaurus in 1882 and the early dinosaur Coelophysis in 1889. In 1889, he succeeded Leidy, who had died the previous year, as professor of zoology at the University of Pennsylvania. The small yearly stipend was enough for Cope's family to move back into one of the townhouses he had been forced to relinquish earlier.|$|E

[...] "Something New" [...] was released on 16 November 2012 by Polydor Records through digital download, serving as the official Children in Need 2012 single. When asked about how she felt with the group being back together and the reception from the public, Walsh said, [...] "I'm kind of flattered people actually care if we come back <b>or</b> <b>not.</b> <b>I</b> think we are all quite proud that we made enough of an impact {{to be able to}} a comeback." ...|$|E
