25|$|James Harmon Brown and Barbara Esensten, {{new head}} {{writers of the}} series, were {{reluctant}} to state whether or not Havins would be departing the soap opera. In their interview with TV Guide, the two remained ambiguous about the matter, though hinting at a recast. Barbara Esensten commented:It’s <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> will probably lose her, and it certainly isn’t our choice. However, we’re still writing the show as if she’s not leaving. If we should have to recast Babe, we’ll help the actor take over the part by writing specifically for the new actor like what we did with the Greenlee recast. We saw some little things in Sabine Singh (Greenlee), so we wrote for her accordingly, but you get into real trouble when you completely change the character for a recast. Luckily, Jim and I don’t have any trouble separating the actor from a character because the latter is really paramount in our eyes.|$|E
500|$|... "Pretty Much Dead Already" [...] {{was written}} by Scott M. Gimple and {{directed}} by Michelle MacLaren. It features recurring appearances from Lauren Cohan, Scott Wilson, IronE Singleton, Madison Lintz, Emily Kinney, Jane McNeill, James Allen McCune, and Amber Chaney. Following the initial broadcast of the previous installment, [...] "Secrets", writer Robert Kirkman teased the following episode [...] "Pretty Much Dead Already". He stated: [...] "There's {{a lot of big}} stuff <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> will be wrapping up to a certain extent. In the writers' room we were fully aware that we were coming up on this hiatus, so we definitely wrote to it. I {{think people are going to}} be a little shocked." ...|$|E
500|$|The show, {{entitled}} Keeping Up With the Kardashians, premiered on October 14, 2007. The reality series {{centers around}} {{the members of the}} Kardashian-Jenner blended family, focusing on the sisters Kourtney, Kim and Khloé. Most episodes have very similar structure: the family [...] "show off their privileged lifestyle and maybe get into one or two minor family squabbles before ultimately wrapping things up with a monologue that reinforces the importance of family," [...] as noted by Caroline Siede of Quartz. Harriet Ryan and Adam Tschorn of the Los Angeles Times described the reality series as a: [...] "Hollywood version of The Brady Bunch -- the harmless high jinks of a loving blended family against a backdrop of wealth and famous connections". Kim Kardashian described the beginning of filming the show, [...] "When we first started , we came together as a family and said, 'If we're going to do this reality show, we're going to be 100 percent who we really are.'". She further commented on the show's authenticity by saying that the network [...] "has never once put anything <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> haven't approved of or accepted". The series was renewed for a second season one month after its premiere due to high ratings. Seacrest described the show's success: [...] "At the heart of the seriesdespite the catfights and endless sarcasmis a family that truly loves and supports one another [...] The familiar dynamics of this family make them one Hollywood bunch that is sure to entertain." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{series was}} {{confirmed}} cancelled in June 2017 by Gay on twitter, ironically {{two days after}} the premiere of the Black Panther movie, with their last issue released in March 2017. Marvel stated no official reason for the cancellation, however, feminist tech site The Mary Sue pointed to the connection between Marvel's knock against [...] "diversity titles" [...] and the Marvel VP David Gabriel's statement that [...] "people didn’t want any more diversity. They didn’t want female characters <b>out</b> <b>there.</b> <b>That’s</b> what <b>we</b> heard, whether <b>we</b> believe <b>that</b> or not. I don’t know that that’s really true, but <b>that’s</b> what <b>we</b> saw in sales.” ...|$|R

But {{we got a lot}} of good feedback to the album. We were playing live every night and being onstage (was) very renewing for us..." ...|$|R
5000|$|Chloe Bennet {{appears as}} a series regular in the live-action series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. playing a {{character}} called Skye, a computer hacker recruited into S.H.I.E.L.D. by Phil Coulson. In the show's second season, the character's birth name is revealed to be Daisy Johnson and she gains superpowers. By {{the end of the}} third season, she adopts the [...] "Quake" [...] moniker. Executive producer Maurissa Tancharoen confirmed the character is an adaptation of Daisy Johnson, as well as an Inhuman. On making Daisy an Inhuman for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, executive producer Jed Whedon said, [...] "We’ve created a different origin for her... We merged those two ideas together also because there are such rabid fans <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>that</b> if <b>we</b> stick to original story points from the comics, they will smell story points from miles away. Those two factors led us to coming up with a different notion of how she got her powers." ...|$|R

Han Purple was first synthesized over 2,500 years ago, but we have only recently discovered how exotic its magnetic behavior is.

6000|$|... "I do mean it. I'm Josephine Draper. Your {{mother and}} I {{went to school}} together, and we were as much as sisters to each other until she got married. Then she went away, {{and after a few}} years I lost trace of her. I didn't even know she was dead. Poor Mary! Well, my duty is plain--that's one comfort--my duty and my pleasure, too. Your sister is coming out to Dalesboro to stay with me. Yes, and you are too, for the whole summer. You needn't say you're not, because you are. I've said so. There's room at Fir Cottage for you both. Yes, Fir Cottage--I guess you've heard your mother speak of that. There's her old room <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> always slept in when she came to stay all night with me. It's all ready for you. What's that? You can't afford to lose your place here? Bless your heart, child, you won't lose it! The owner of this store is my nephew, and he'll do {{considerable}} to oblige me, as well he might, seeing as I brought him up. To think that Mary Carvell's daughter has been in his store for three years, and me never suspecting it! And I might never have found you out at all if you hadn't been so patient with that woman. If you'd sassed her back, I'd have thought she deserved it and wouldn't have blamed you a mite, but I wouldn't have bothered coming to talk to you either. Well, well well! Poor child, don't cry. You just pick up and go home. I'll make it all right with Tom. You're pretty near played out yourself, I can see that. But a summer in Fir Cottage, with plenty of cream and eggs and my cookery, will soon make another girl of you. Don't you dare to thank me. It's a privilege {{to be able to do}} something for Mary Carvell's girls. I just loved Mary." ...|$|E
60|$|MY DEAR SIR:--Since {{you spoke}} to me {{yesterday}} about General J. H. Lane, of Kansas, I have been reflecting upon the subject, and have concluded <b>that</b> <b>we</b> need the service of such a man <b>out</b> <b>there</b> at once; <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had better appoint him a brigadier-general of volunteers to-day, and send him off with such authority to raise a force (I think two regiments better than three, but as to this I am not particular) as you think will get him into actual work quickest. Tell him, when he starts, to put it through not to be writing or telegraphing back here, but put it through.|$|R
5000|$|Roth's first work, Goodbye, Columbus, {{featured}} his irreverent {{humor of}} the life of middle-class Jewish Americans, and was met by controversy among reviewers, who were highly polarized in their judgments; one reviewer criticized it as infused with a sense of self-loathing. In response, Roth, in his 1963 essay [...] "Writing About Jews" [...] (collected in Reading Myself and Others), maintained that he wanted to explore the conflict between the call to Jewish solidarity and his desire to be free to question the values and morals of middle-class Jewish Americans uncertain of their identities in an era of cultural assimilation and upward social mobility:The cry 'Watch out for the goyim!' at times seems more the expression of an unconscious wish than of a warning: Oh <b>that</b> they were <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> so <b>that</b> <b>we</b> could be together here! A rumor of persecution, a taste of exile, might even bring with it the old world of feelings and habits—something to replace the new world of social accessibility and moral indifference, the world which tempts all our promiscuous instincts, and where one cannot always figure out what a Jew is that a Christian is not.|$|R
30|$|The {{constructed}} applications {{prove that}} even such low recognition {{results can be}} useful in particular tasks. Still, it is important to find methods for improving the recognition rates. Ideally, a lyrics recognition system should be trained on singing material. We lack a large enough database with monophonic recordings, but we do have at our disposal plenty of polyphonic material. One approach could be using vocals separated from polyphonic music for training of the models. Also, considering <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are millions of songs <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> <b>we</b> know <b>that</b> <b>we</b> only selected a small amount of information to build the word language model. A better selection of the vocabulary can be obtained by using more text {{in the construction of the}} language model.|$|R

50|$|There's the Central Universe, {{and seven}} {{circuits}} of that Universe that are what {{are referred to}} as Local Universes. The scope of the functions and purposes of each and the whole is enormous. I will just say that one of the functions of our universe, one of the seven circuits, is primarily for what we know as “life.” We function as energy/consciousness on multiple levels of this universe simultaneously. We are here in slowed-down 'solid matter' density, and we also exist in higher energy frequency wavelengths at the same time, experiencing outside of time/space. You may understand this as different levels of dreams, where you can re-connect with yourself in another form you don't readily recognize, but feel a very strange familiarity with, and a desire to be with that form at all times because of the content of the dream. Regardless, the universe is infinite in space because space is just one aspect of density, whereas there are infinite other aspects of density that are not confined to three dimensions. The purpose of “life” in three dimensions is simply to experience, teach/learn, and evolve onto higher aspects of self. The ultimate goal is returning to the source after many and different experiences in higher dimensional realities, mostly in the service of others as others higher in reality have helped you on your way upward. That's the universe. And there's a lot of other planets and stars and strange stuff <b>out</b> <b>there</b> too <b>that</b> <b>we</b> haven't been able to fly to and check out. Maybe one day. Turn on some Tom Waits and go skate. Step right up.|$|R

5000|$|The band {{decided to}} rewrite the whole album {{following}} Taylor's departure. Fourteen songs had been completed for Reportage but according to Simon Le Bon: [...] "When {{we sat down and}} listened to what we had done on our own, we didn’t feel we had a lead track, so we got in touch with Timbaland, who was the only producer <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> knew we all liked." ...|$|E
