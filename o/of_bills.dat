40|$|The {{concept and}} types <b>of</b> <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> {{exchange}} The topic of this thesis is "The concept and types <b>of</b> <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> exchange". The reason for choosing this topic {{has been my}} interest in <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> exchange law, which was awaken by my own experience with a <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> exchange {{on one hand and}} by the gripping seminars of subject called "Bills of Exchanges", which is taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences of the Charles University in Prague, on the other hand. The aim of the thesis is to characterize the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> exchange and promissory note, to define their basic characteristics, to explain, what kind of them exist and to analyze their basic requirements. The thesis is composed of six chapters. The first chapter discusses the history <b>of</b> <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> exchange and promissory note. It is divided into three sections that deal with the origin and both national and international development <b>of</b> <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> exchange law. The second chapter is devoted to the current legislation <b>of</b> <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> exchange law. It introduces the sources <b>of</b> <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> exchange law and relations between them and the most specific characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> exchange law, which is rigor cambialis. The third chapter, which consists of three sections, defines the concept <b>of</b> <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> exchange and promissory note, provides a list of their features and the most [...] ...|$|R

This law was finally approved on 23 February 2009, introduced as a package <b>of</b> <b>bills</b> known as the Decreto Maroni. In the same year she signed a campaign against homophobia in Italy, with television spots, images on magazines and wall attachments on cities. She also proposed a bill against homophobia, in which homophobia was considered as an aggravating circumstance in bullying events. This bill was next refused by the Parliament.|$|E

5|$|Slaughter's unpopularity led to {{the demise}} of many of his proposals, {{regardless}} of their merits.

Slaughter further proposed a reform of the penal system and recommended internal improvements, including the creation of a state library. These measures were also rejected.|$|E

5|$|The 1846 {{session of}} Parliament {{experienced}} a snowstorm <b>of</b> <b>bills</b> for new railways; {{many of these}} threatened to encroach on the GPK area of influence and abstract business; several schemes were promoted by the Caledonian Railway or its allies; in self-defence the GPK itself promoted numerous schemes—in fact 25 branches {{as well as a}} bill nominally by the K to authorise the modernisation works—to head off some of the encroachment.|$|E
5|$|These {{reforms were}} also {{significant}} {{in that they}} gave to Senate committees the role of examining the budget (what {{is referred to as}} the estimates process or estimates hearings), which had hitherto been confined to the Senate and its committee of the whole. The role of the committees was enhanced by three subsequent developments. First, in 1982 the Scrutiny <b>of</b> <b>Bills</b> Committee was established, which, in examining all bills, played a role that complemented that of the examination of all delegated legislation by the Regulations and Ordinances Committee. Second, in 1989 the Senate adopted procedures for the systematic referral <b>of</b> <b>bills</b> to committees, increasing the level of legislative scrutiny taking place within parliament. Third, in 1993, the committees adopted a more extensive procedure for consideration of the budget, creating a second opportunity each year for Senators to follow up issues identified during the initial budget estimates hearings. These second hearings are referred to as supplementary budget estimates. Though the committee system was restructured in 1994, 2006 and again in 2009, the range of functions has remained essentially the same.|$|E
5|$|Under modern {{constitutional}} conventions, {{the sovereign}} acts {{on the advice}} of his or her ministers. Since these ministers most often enjoy the support of parliament and obtain the passage <b>of</b> <b>bills,</b> it is improbable that they would advise the sovereign to withhold assent. Hence, in modern practice, royal assent is always granted; a refusal to do so would be appropriate only in an emergency requiring the use of the monarch's reserve powers.|$|E

50|$|When the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading {{is used as}} a {{document}} of title, it is particularly related to the case of buyer. When the buyer is entitled to received goods from the carrier, <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading in this case performs as document of title for the goods. There are two types <b>of</b> <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading that can perform as document of title. They are straight <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading and order <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading. Straight <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading is a <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading issued to a named consignee that is not negotiable. In this case, the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading should be directed only to one specific consignee indicated on the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading. Order <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading is the opposite from a straight <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading and there is no specific or named consignee. Therefore, an order <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading can be negotiated to a third party.|$|R
5|$|A Non-constituency Member of Parliament (NCMP) is {{a member}} of a Singaporean {{opposition}} political party who, according to the Constitution and Parliamentary Elections Act, is declared to have been elected a Member of the Parliament of Singapore despite having lost in a general election by virtue of having been one of the best-performing losers. NCMPs enjoy most of the privileges of ordinary Members of Parliament. They are, however, not allowed to vote on several types <b>of</b> <b>bills</b> such as bills to amend the Constitution and motions of no confidence in the Government. An election candidate who has been offered an NCMP seat may decline to take it up.|$|E
5|$|After his inauguration, Obama {{announced}} {{to a joint}} session of Congress in February 2009 his intent to work with Congress to construct a plan for healthcare reform. By July, a series <b>of</b> <b>bills</b> were approved by committees within the House of Representatives. On the Senate side, from June to September, the Senate Finance Committee held a series of 31 meetings to develop a healthcare reform bill. This group—in particular, Democrats Max Baucus, Jeff Bingaman and Kent Conrad, along with Republicans Mike Enzi, Chuck Grassley and Olympia Snowe—met for more than 60 hours, and the principles that they discussed, in conjunction with the other committees, became the foundation of the Senate healthcare reform bill.|$|E
5|$|As {{one of the}} two {{principal}} common law courts along with the Common Pleas, the King's Bench's jurisdiction and caseload was significantly challenged by the rise of the Court of Chancery and equitable doctrines in the 15th and 16th centuries. To recover, the King's Bench undertook a scheme of revolutionary reform, creating less expensive, faster and more versatile types of pleading in the form <b>of</b> <b>bills</b> as opposed to the more traditional writs. Although not immediately stemming the tide, in the long term it helped the King's Bench not only recover but increase its workload. While there was a steep decline in business from 1460 to 1540, as the new reforms began to take effect the King's Bench's business was significantly boosted; between 1560 and 1640, it rose tenfold.|$|E

As weeks passed with no definite news, the Marstrand directors assumed that the vessel was lost, either through foundering or barratry, and claimed insurance. They had already received sums totalling £2,400 from the underwriters, when they were surprised by the arrival <b>of</b> <b>bills</b> from Corcubión, together with the news that Girl Pat had sailed from the port on 24 April, her destination unknown.|$|E

Hoping to stop the annexation by reforming the government, Burgers introduced scores <b>of</b> <b>bills</b> and revisions to a bewildered volksraad, which opposed them all but then passed them, heightening the general mood of discord and confusion.

40|$|Resumé The concept <b>of</b> <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> {{exchange}} and promissory note The {{purpose of the}} thesis is to describe institutes <b>of</b> <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> {{exchange and}} promissory note and other important institutes of law related to the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> exchange. The thesis is separated into several parts, in the first chapter I use general characteristic of negotiable instruments for the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> exchange. In the second chapter I briefly discuss relations <b>of</b> the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> exchange, {{because we have to}} pay attention not only to the essentials but also to other terms <b>of</b> drawing the <b>bill.</b> In the third chapter I deal with the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> exchange and promissory note and their essentials. The difference between the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> exchange and the promissory note is an unconditional order to pay a determinate sum of money by drawer to drawee, which is characteristic for the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> exchange; whereas the promissory note is characterized by an unconditional promise to pay a determinate sum of money by drawer. The rest of essentials, except for the name of drawee logically, are the same. These essential are the term "bill of exchange" incorporated in the body <b>of</b> the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> exchange in the same language as a text <b>of</b> the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> exchange, maturity, place of payment, name of payee, place and date <b>of</b> drawing a <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> exchange and signature of drawer.

5|$|The Constitution of the Republic of Singapore Tribunal was {{established}} in 1994 pursuant to Article 100 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore. Article 100 provides a mechanism for the President of Singapore, acting {{on the advice of}} the Singapore Cabinet, to refer to the Tribunal for its opinion any question as to the effect of any provision of the Constitution which has arisen or appears to likely to arise. Questions referred to the Tribunal may concern the validity of enacted laws or <b>of</b> <b>bills</b> that have not yet been passed by Parliament.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} the Senate's {{committees}} varies and {{has been the subject}} of debate. The work of the committees is frequently more consensual and less partisan than activity in the parliamentary chambers, and unanimous committee reports that agree recommendations across party lines are not uncommon. As a result, these recommendations may contribute to subsequent government policy announcements and occasionally to changes in government actions. The work of the regulations and ordinances committee has led to revisions of subordinate legislation in significant respects. Committee scrutiny <b>of</b> <b>bills</b> has contributed to them being amended or withdrawn. The impact of committees on legislation overall has however been described as 'rather limited', particularly as the committees that review bills are controlled by a government majority.|$|E
5|$|During the state's early history, vetoes were seldom {{employed}} by governors primarily {{because they were}} seen as only symbolic since the General Assembly could override them with only a simple majority. Governor James Whitcomb {{was the first to}} make significant use of the power and vetoed a record of fifteen bills during a single legislative session. Roger Branigin, who presided over a hostile legislature, made the most total vetoes of any governor, returning a total of one hundred bills to the assembly. Despite the fact that vetoes are easily overridden, only around ten percent of vetoed bills are overridden. During the 1970s, for example, 117 bills were vetoed, but only eleven were overridden. Observers and historians attribute this to the short length of legislative sessions, which often do not allow enough time for a large number <b>of</b> <b>bills</b> to pass through both houses twice. Another factor is that legislators of the same party as the governor typically refuse to override his veto, even in cases where they supported the bill originally.|$|E
