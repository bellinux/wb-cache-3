One, a soldier named Michael Harding, was killed early in the battle but [...] "it did not daunt <b>or</b> <b>check</b> the others, but on the contrary animated them to seek revenge". Cockburn's initial impressions were positive; he observed that the new recruits were [...] "getting on astonishingly" [...] and were [...] "really fine fellows".

2500|$|The {{first edition}} was printed by Mathias Clavijo in Seville in 1615; that is, {{two years after}} Torquemada had {{returned}} to Mexico, so his presence in Seville can only have been to select and arrange matters with the printer, and not to oversee the actual printing <b>or</b> <b>check</b> the galley-proofs. [...] León-Portilla suggests these arrangements (including the choice of type and the layout) might have taken weeks at most, giving Torquemada time to visit Madrid and {{other places in the}} land of his birth. That no doubt explains how it happened that the first edition lacked two passages present in the manuscript, as well as words from some of the chapter headings, and contained countless other mistakes which the printer of the second edition noted but did not specify in his Proemio. Despite the blemishes which marred the body of the first edition, the printer of the second edition was unstinting in his praise of the analytic indices which, he said, greatly enriched the text. [...] According to a modern commentator, expressing also the hope that similar works would not omit a scientific apparatus of this kind, [...] "their usefulness and erudition are formidable".|$|E

Guralnick adds [...] "The Colonel joked that they looked like a bunch of old men, but the Memphis Mafia had become almost as well known around town as Frank Sinatra's Rat Pack" [...] and that Elvis and his guys were all [...] "living on speed and tranqs." [...] For Joe Esposito, [...] "it was a party like you wouldn't believe. Go to a different show every night, then pick up a bunch of women afterwards, go party the next night. Go to the lounges, see Fats Domino, Della Reese, Jackie Wilson, the Four Aces, the Dominoes – all the old acts.
