Clips are shown from footage of earthquake-torn Haiti, a suffering post-Katrina New Orleans, and Bieber himself visiting sick children in hospital beds. More scenes feature military soldiers being reunited with their families, and homes being possessed because families cannot pay mortgage. The video is intercut with scenes of Bieber performing. Like the song itself, the video also includes religious undertones, including the video {{ending with the}} quote, [...] "God speaks {{in the silence of}} the heart. Listening is the beginning of prayer." [...] Bill Lamb of About.com likened the video to the saying, [...] "There are times when putting pictures to the words does indeed make a song more powerful than simply listening to the track." [...] Calling the video [...] "outstanding for the holiday season" [...] Lamb said the theme of [...] "bringing hope and joy into the lives of others" [...] related to [...] "the celebrations that bring all <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>together</b> in hope for a brighter future for our world." ...|$|E
500|$|In April 2012, Aguilera {{confirmed}} {{that she and}} Green had worked on a new track entitled [...] "Make the World Move" [...] and described it as [...] "positive" [...] and [...] "full of life." [...] Regarding the collaboration, she said: [...] "I'm just excited to share the stage with Cee Lo because we both get off on production and dancers and having all of those fun elements about being on stage and being a performer... So the two <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>together</b> joining forces {{is going to be}} huge!" [...] When asked if [...] "Make the World Move" [...] would be released as a single, Aguilera replied saying that she was not sure about what would be done with the song. In an interview with MTV News in November, Aguilera explained how she felt the song would be suited to Green as she felt a male vocal contribution was needed, saying: [...] "I got to collaborate with my good buddy Cee Lo... There was a part for a potential male vocal on the chorus, and I just heard immediately Cee Lo's voice on it, his signature Cee Lo, and it was fun collaborating with him and having him on my record and us joining forces together." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{scene in}} which Susan, Lynette, and Gabrielle comfort Bree at the {{hospital}} was the last scene of the season involving the four principal characters. Teri Hatcher commented: [...] "It was a heavy scene. There was a very genuine and deeply felt recognition that all four <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>together</b> as a team appreciated the ride we'd had this season and were grateful that we'd survived it together." [...] An extension of the scene, in which the women discuss Susan's discovery of Martha Huber's journal, was cut for time, though it was aired on Good Morning America on May 23, 2005, {{one day after the}} episode's broadcast, and was included on the first season DVD set. The death of one housewife's husband was confirmed prior to the episode's broadcast. Steven Culp was not surprised when his character was killed off, stating [...] "I had a sneaking suspicion someone was going to go." [...] Producer and writer Kevin Murphy explained the reasoning for killing off the Rex character: [...] "As we neared the end of season 1, our plan was that each woman would enter a new life chapter. Gabrielle would learn to function without Carlos, Susan and Mike would build their relationship, Lynette would go back to work, and Bree would become a single woman. We either had to have Rex divorce her or die." [...] Cherry named the {{scene in which}} Bree finishes her spring cleaning before mourning the death of her husband as one of his top three favorites of the season, stating: [...] "It was one of the favorite things I wrote because it was so true to her character. She had to finish the cleaning she started, and she comes in and everything’s perfect." [...] A scene between Gabrielle and John was also cut for time.|$|E

Though web-based applications can calculate h-indices, Peterson had to check for misspelt or duplicated names.|$|R
500|$|In the {{conclusion}} of the segment Bender stated, [...] "The big climactic cave sequence was hugely complex, and although it's very scary that this really terrifying thing is happening to our characters, {{at the end of the}} day I think the emotion from what we are experiencing is hopefully going to be the shock that people will stay with," [...] referring to Hodor's implied death. In an interview with Kristian Nairn (Hodor), he described filming the scene, [...] "It was a really heavy day — you’ve got these 100-mile-per-hour winds being blown into your face with false snow. I was really holding the door — there were like eight people pushing from the other side and I was really holding them back. It’s definitely Method acting. It was a very intense day but one of the nice things was they let Isaac wrap me. He got to come over and say [...] "Mr. Nairn, that’s a wrap." [...] It was very emotional. It’s always been a little group <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>together</b> and it felt like our little group was breaking up." [...] Ellie Kendrick (Meera Reed) spoke about the filming of her part of the sequence, saying [...] "A lot of what's happening in that scene, in Meera's head, comes down to adrenaline. There's just no way she can stop and consider logically what's happening. If you have an army of the undead chasing after you, you're only going to be thinking one thing: [...] "Run!" [...] It was interesting, having the challenge of creating that adrenaline and fear and sadness of Hodor, but not being able to process it at all. Having to recreate that feeling of immediacy, in a stuffy studio at 4 p.m. on a Thursday when you've been filming the same scene for a couple of days, it was difficult. But it was an exciting challenge, to constantly inject the energy those characters must be feeling in that moment." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} to publicise the DVD release of The Meaning of Life, Cleese said a further reunion was unlikely. [...] "It is absolutely impossible to get even a majority <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>together</b> in a room, and I'm not joking," [...] Cleese said. He said that the problem was one of busyness rather than one of bad feelings. A sketch appears on the same DVD spoofing the impossibility of a full reunion, bringing the members [...] "together" [...] in a deliberately unconvincing fashion with modern bluescreen/greenscreen techniques.|$|E
2500|$|Ensembles {{develop a}} close {{intimacy}} of shared musical experience. [...] "It {{is on the}} concert stage where the moments of true intimacy occur", writes Steinhardt. [...] "When a performance is in progress, all four <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>together</b> enter a zone of magic somewhere between our music stands and become a conduit, messenger, and missionary... It is an experience too personal to talk about and yet it colors {{every aspect of our}} relationship, every good-natured musical confrontation, all the professional gossip, the latest viola joke." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Now we're in {{the soup}} for certain! If one <b>of</b> <b>us</b> makes the littlest kind of move that villainous old Professor will pounce down.

5000|$|It's very Julian; it took {{a little}} while to make it an End of Fashion song. But the two <b>of</b> <b>us</b> working <b>together</b> allowed <b>us</b> both to explore outside our usual genres. I love co-writing for this very reason. Justin Burford ...|$|R
60|$|I've been {{worrying}} about poor Tad Warren's wife, bunch <b>of</b> <b>us</b> got <b>together</b> {{and made up}} a purse for her. Nothing more pathetic than these poor little women that poke down the cocktails to keep excited {{and then go to}} pieces.|$|R
60|$|So {{we started}} away, the four <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>together.</b> Presently, however, Arthur and Isobel drew away in front. Allan, {{with a little}} grunt, stopped to light his pipe.|$|E

60|$|We did get {{the thing}} up at last, the two <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>together.</b> We fixed it, not exactly upside down—more {{sideways}} like—and we tied {{it up to}} the mast with the painter, which we cut off for the purpose.|$|E

5000|$|When {{the three}} <b>of</b> <b>us</b> Rob Pike, got started, {{it was pure}} research.

6000|$|The {{light of}} a strange {{excitement}} came in Herrick's face.

6000|$|... "Very well. I don't {{think that}} it will make any difference, for the rope is strong enough to hold the three <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>together.</b> However, here goes. We may as well leave our coatees behind us. They might get us into difficulties, if we took them." ...|$|E

2500|$|Snyder {{has also}} commented [...] "The term Beat is better {{used for a}} smaller group of writers ... the {{immediate}} group around Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac, plus Gregory Corso and a few others.
