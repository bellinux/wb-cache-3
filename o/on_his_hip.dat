5|$|In 1999, while {{pitching}} on a wet mound in Cleveland, Shuey {{injured his}} right hip. Over {{the next several}} seasons, he had multiple surgeries <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>hip,</b> including repairing a torn labrum and removing bone spurs. He finished the 1999 season with an 8–5 record, a 3.53 ERA, and six saves. His eight wins tied for the most among Cleveland's relief pitchers. In 2000, new Indians' manager Charlie Manuel indicated the Indians would attempt to shift Shuey into the closer role. When Shuey spent time {{on the disabled list}}, Steve Karsay served as the Indians' closer. He again spent time on the disabled list in 2001 with a strained elbow ligament.|$|E

25|$|In August 2002, Keane {{was fined}} £150,000 by Sir Alex Ferguson and {{suspended}} for three matches for elbowing Sunderland's Jason McAteer, {{and this was}} compounded by an added five-match suspension for the controversial comments about Håland. Keane used the break to undergo an operation <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>hip,</b> which had caused him to take painkillers for a year beforehand. Despite early fears that the injury was career-threatening, and suggestions of a future hip-replacement from his surgeon, {{he was back in}} the United team by December.|$|E
25|$|Masks {{may also}} {{indicate}} a culture's ideal of feminine beauty. The masks of Punu of Gabon have highly arched eyebrows, almost almond-shaped {{eyes and a}} narrow chin. The raised strip running {{from both sides of}} the nose to the ears represent jewellery. Dark black hairstyle, tops the mask off. The whiteness of the face represent the whiteness and beauty of the spirit world. Only men wear the masks and perform the dances with high stilts despite the masks representing women. One of the most beautiful representations of female beauty is the Idia's Mask of Benin in present-day Edo State of Nigeria. It is believed to have been commissioned by a king of Benin in memory of his mother. To honor his dead mother, the king wore the mask <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>hip</b> during special ceremonies.|$|E
25|$|Although Honner {{took the}} {{decision}} to disband the 39th Battalion hard, six days after he was appointed to command of the 2/14th Battalion, having been asked for personally by Brigadier Ivan Dougherty, commander of the 21st Brigade of which the 2/14th was a part. Honner subsequently led the 2/14th early in the campaign in the Ramu–Markham Valley before being seriously wounded by a gunshot to his hip after leaving the battalion's main defensive perimeter to conduct a reconnaissance during the advance on Dumpu. After being evacuated to Australia, Honner had surgery <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>hip</b> during which a metal plate was inserted into it. In early 1944, after being deemed only fit for duties of an administrative nature, he was posted as General Staff Officer Grade 1, Directorate of Military Training, G Branch, at Land Headquarters in Melbourne, where {{he worked on the}} creation of training manuals. In late 1944 Honner's medical classification was downgraded further as his hip injury worsened, and as a result in January 1945, he was discharged.|$|E

25|$|Graham {{returned}} to the WWF one more time in June 1986, now as a fan favorite. After a few appearances, it was diagnosed in August that he required a hip replacement. The footage of Graham's hip replacement surgery was shown on WWF TV on September 27 {{as a means of}} promoting his comeback. He returned in mid-1987 and worked a heavy schedule from mid July to late October, feuding with Harley Race and Butch Reed. However, the strain <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>hip</b> as well as his ankles also deteriorating proved to be too much. In Syracuse on October 27, the One Man Gang supposedly retired him from active competition permanently with a running splash on the concrete floor after Graham's win over Reed. In this incident, aired on the November 14, 1987 episode of Superstars, Don Muraco came to Graham's aid, and Graham subsequently became Muraco's manager. Graham's last wrestling match, also against Butch Reed and at 44 years of age, actually took place on November 7, 1987, in St Louis, Missouri. Over the next year, in between bouts of surgery, Graham worked for the WWF as a commentator.|$|E
25|$|Marshall {{was traded}} to the Chicago Bears on March 13, 2012, for one third round draft pick in 2012 and a future one in 2013, reuniting him with former Bronco {{teammate}} Jay Cutler leading to a career year for Marshall. In his Bears debut against the Indianapolis Colts, Marshall caught 9 passes for 119 yards, which was the twentieth time he surpassed one hundred yards in his career. He also caught a 3-yard touchdown pass, as the Bears would go on to win 41–21. After the Bears win over the Detroit Lions in Week 7, Marshall was fined $10,500 for wearing orange cleats. In Week 12 against the Minnesota Vikings, Marshall recorded 12 catches for 92 yards, and passed the 1,000 yards receiving mark in a season for the sixth time in his career, making Marshall the first Bears receiver to accomplish the feat since Marty Booker in 2002. Two weeks later against the Vikings, Marshall recorded ten catches for 160 yards, passing Booker's single season reception mark with a total of 101 receptions. In Week 16 against the Arizona Cardinals, Marshall broke Marcus Robinson's single-season franchise record for receiving yards set in 1999. On December 26, Marshall was named to the 2013 Pro Bowl, making him the second Bears receiver to be named to the game since Dick Gordon in 1971, with the first being Booker in 2002. However, Marshall did not play in the game due to having an arthroscopic procedure <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>hip,</b> and was replaced by Larry Fitzgerald. Marshall finished the season with 118 receptions, 89 catches more than the next Bears receiver (Earl Bennett), which tied with New England Patriots receiver Wes Welker for second, behind Detroit Lions' Calvin Johnson, and third in receiving yards with 1,508, behind Houston's Andre Johnson and Calvin Johnson.|$|E
500|$|An {{unrestricted}} free agent following the 2004 playoffs, Bure {{did not play}} anywhere in 2004–05 as the entire NHL season was canceled due to a labour dispute. He signed a one-year contract with the Los Angeles Kings for the 2005–06 season when the league resumed operations. He never played a regular season game for the Kings. [...] A back injury suffered during the pre-season, initially just described as [...] "soreness", {{kept him out of}} the regular lineup. The injury ultimately required surgery, and a second surgery <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>hip</b> caused Bure to miss the entire season. At the age of 31, he opted to retire following the surgeries.|$|E

500|$|Omar J. Gonzalez {{was born}} in Puerto Rico. His father was a Korean War veteran. He enlisted in the US Army in July 1997 when he was 25, and {{discharged}} in 2003 after completing his six-year service period. Gonzalez re-enlisted in July 2005, and was deployed to the Iraq War from October 2006 until January 2008. Gonzalez received several medals for marksmanship and conduct during his service. He married Samantha Bell in 2006, however, they separated in 2010 and were divorced in July 2014. According to Bell, after returning from Iraq, Gonzalez carried a handgun <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>hip</b> at all times, and also kept several rifles and shotguns behind the doors in their house.|$|E

500|$|For the 1989 season, Thome was {{assigned}} to the Gulf Coast League Indians, a minor league affiliate of the Cleveland Indians. He finished the year with a [...]237 batting average, no home runs, and 22 runs batted in (RBIs). After his rookie season, he met [...] "hitting guru" [...] Charlie Manuel, who later became his manager and mentor. Unlike most Indians staff, Manuel saw potential in Thome and worked hard with him, particularly <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>hip</b> motion while swinging the bat. Thome later said, [...] " [...] saw something in me I didn't." [...] During this work, Manuel suggested to Thome that he point his bat out to center field before the pitch to relax himself like Roy Hobbs did when batting in the baseball film The Natural. The work paid off; in 1990, Thome hit [...]340 and totaled 16 home runs and 50 RBIs playing at both the Rookie and Class A levels of the minor leagues. Thome spent most of the 1991 season splitting time between Double-A and Triple-A where, in combination, he hit [...]319 with 7 home runs and 73 RBIs.|$|E

500|$|The current {{coat of arms}} {{consists}} of numerous traditional heraldic attributes. The shield is party per fess argent and gules; that is, split horizontally in two with a red lower half and silver upper half. Its lower half contains two golden sheaves of wheat on a red background; this design represents Albany's agricultural past. The upper half, which has a silver background, depicts a beaver gnawing at the stump of a fallen tree. This scene represents Beverwyck's former fur trade, which was vital {{to the development of}} Albany. One supporter can be seen {{on each side of the}} shield. The man on the left is a European-descended farmer dressed in simple clothes; he is supporting the shield with his left hand. His right hand rests <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>hip</b> and a sickle hangs from his waist; this references Albany's former agricultural society. The man on the right is an American Indian dressed in a loin cloth and wearing moccasins and a quiver. He supports the shield with his right hand and holds a bow over his left shoulder. The two men supporting the shield together represent the cooperation between white immigrants and Indians in the early development of the city, which would not have existed without the Indian fur trade. The men stand on a scroll displaying the motto Assiduity, meaning [...] "the quality of acting with constant and careful attention". The torse is argent and gules, following the pattern of the shield. The crest is a sloop under full sail facing left, [...] "denoting Albany's supremacy at the head of the sloop navigation of the Hudson River". The coat of arms represents the [...] "symbols of industry and its rewards to man and beast on land and sea". At the time of Albany's bicentennial (1886), it was believed that only New York City and Albany possessed arms charged on a shield upheld by supporters.|$|E

2500|$|Some of the {{apparently}} unfinished passages were intended as revisions to a previous conception: {{the body was}} originally turned farther to the viewer's right, with Rembrandt's arm raised {{so that he would}} be portrayed painting on a canvas {{at the edge of the}} picture while holding additional brushes in his left hand. The subsequent alterations, including the repainting of his left hand <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>hip,</b> reduced the animation of the figure and increased its sense of monumentality. [...] The most richly elaborated areas are the background and head, with the latter constructed of many nuanced colors, thickly painted, and imparting a dynamic realism. In contrast to the impasted areas are the eye sockets, painted with subtle glazes, one eye in shadow and the effect enigmatic.|$|E
