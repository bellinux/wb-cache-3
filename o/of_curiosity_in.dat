25|$|After recuperating until 1802, {{she decided}} to re-enlist, rejoining the 9th Dragoons, now garrisoned in Paris, as a gentleman volunteer. The memoirs claim that she was accorded many of the {{privileges}} of an officer, and she found herself an object <b>of</b> <b>curiosity</b> <b>in</b> fashionable society, culminating in a dinner invitation with Napoleon, now First Consul of the Republic. For ten days, she became an attendant to Josephine, but she {{found it hard to}} adapt to the informal idleness of the Château de Saint-Cloud, so she returned to her regiment in the Paris garrison until 1805, when Marshal Augereau recruited her as a uniformed aide-de-camp for his wife, who, like her, enjoyed both riding and shooting – a more conducive household than Saint-Cloud. The basic outline is confirmed by the appearance of her stipend at St-Cloud in Napoleon's accounts in 1804, and by the eyewitness memoirs of Marbot, which vouch for her role with Augereau, and summarize her previous biography up to her departure from Saint-Cloud. In 1805, she was also proposed (albeit unsuccessfully) for the Napoleonic army's gallantry medal, the Légion d'honneur.|$|E

60|$|The great {{museum at}} Naples {{is one of}} the most {{wonderful}} collections <b>of</b> <b>curiosities</b> <b>in</b> the world. It is contained in an immense building, which is divided into numerous galleries and halls, each of which is devoted to some special department of art.|$|R
50|$|George Bullock {{was born}} in Birmingham, where his mother ran an {{exhibition}} of wax models in the late 1790s. His brother, William Bullock, opened a museum <b>of</b> <b>curiosities</b> <b>in</b> the city in 1800. He moved it to Liverpool the next year, and George went with him.|$|R
500|$|The {{chapters}} {{are written}} {{so that they}} could be read as lectures. Though several reviewers referred to them as essays, Gopnik made the distinction between an essay, which is written to be read silently, and a lecture, which is meant to be spoken and keeps some of the rhythm of speech. Gopnik purposefully tried [...] "to keep them as conversational as possible [...] they lack the polish of his New Yorker essays". The lectures' conversational tone, with both common and arcane references, was meant to appeal to a [...] "middlebrow" [...] audience; they were designed to be [...] "profound and significant" [...] but not academic. The reviewer in The Observer described the writing as [...] "designed to maintain a constant flame <b>of</b> <b>curiosity</b> <b>in</b> a lecture room shut against the cold".|$|E
2500|$|The Princess chose her {{dressing}} style based {{on both the}} Royal Family's demands and popular modern styles in Britain, and developed her personal trend of fashion. While on diplomatic trips, her numerous clothes and attire were chosen to match the destination countries' costumes, and while off-duty she used to wear loose jackets and jumpers. [...] "She was always very thoughtful about how her clothes would be interpreted, {{it was something that}} really mattered to her," [...] stated Anna Harvey, a former editor of Vogue and the Princess's fashion mentor. David Sassoon, one of the designers who worked with Diana, believed that she had [...] "broken the rules" [...] with trying new styles. Diana chose not to practice some of the royal methods for clothing including putting aside the tradition of wearing gloves as she believed it would prevent direct connection with the people she met, such as those affected by serious diseases like AIDS patients. She used to wear certain types of ensembles and clothes at charity events which would also match the mentality of the people she would meet, for instance wearing colourful dresses and [...] "jangling jewels" [...] so she could easily play with children at hospitals. According to Donatella Versace who had closely worked with the Princess alongside her brother, Diana's interest and sense <b>of</b> <b>curiosity</b> <b>in</b> fashion grew significantly after her separation from Charles. Versace also points out that [...] " [...] think that anyone, before or after her, has done for fashion what Diana did." ...|$|E

6000|$|I went {{often to}} look at the {{collection}} <b>of</b> <b>curiosities</b> <b>in</b> Heidelberg Castle, and one day I surprised the keeper of it with my German.

60|$|The Prince, who now {{realised}} {{what his}} heedlessness had done, cursed too late his spirit <b>of</b> <b>curiosity.</b> <b>In</b> his despair he wandered {{on over the}} heath, never looking where he put his feet, and full of sorrowful thoughts. At last he saw a light in the distance, which came from a miserable-looking little hut.|$|E
60|$|It {{seemed as}} if the mysterious picture still held a thrall upon me. I thought also that our host's eye was turned on me with an air <b>of</b> <b>curiosity.</b> <b>In</b> short, I was {{conscious}} that I was the hero of the night, and felt as if every one might read it in my looks.|$|E

60|$|When {{he reached}} the Smiling Pool there sat Great-Grandfather Frog on his big green lily pad as usual. There was a hungry look in his big goggly eyes, for it was so early that no foolish, green flies had come his way yet. But Peter Rabbit was too full <b>of</b> <b>curiosity</b> <b>in</b> Mr. Toad's affairs to notice this.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course, the Treasury took up {{the case}} and subpoenaed Mr. Morton as a witness, so that gentleman--if he wished to hush the matter up, or had been in any way terrorised into a promise of doing so--gained nothing by his refusal, except an {{additional}} amount <b>of</b> <b>curiosity</b> <b>in</b> the public mind and further sensation around the mysterious case.|$|E
60|$|She {{knocked the}} ash from her cigarette. She was looking {{directly}} at him, and he fancied {{that there was a}} gleam <b>of</b> <b>curiosity</b> <b>in</b> her beautiful eyes. There was certainly a little more abandon about her attitude. She was leaning back in a corner of her high-backed chair, and her gown, although it lacked the daring of Lady Cynthia's, seemed to rest about her like a cloud of blue-grey smoke.|$|E

25|$|The next oldest {{piece of}} adinkra textile was sent in 1825 from the Elmina Castle {{to the royal}} cabinet <b>of</b> <b>curiosities</b> <b>in</b> The Hague, in {{response}} to an assignment from Major F. Last, who was appointed temporary Commander of Dutch Gold Coast. He probably had the cloth commissioned for William I of the Netherlands, which would explain why the Coat of arms of the Netherlands is in the centre. The other motifs are typical of the older adinkras. It is now on display in the National Museum of Ethnology in Leiden.|$|R
60|$|The old man also evinced a {{considerable}} amount <b>of</b> <b>curiosity</b> <b>in</b> regard to Manuela, and made one or two attempts to engage her in conversation, but on being informed by Pedro that she belonged to a tribe living half-way between his hunting-grounds and the regions of Patagonia, and {{that she did not}} understand his dialect at all, he forbore to question her, and satisfied himself with simply gazing.|$|E
60|$|The {{girl looked}} at their visitor, {{and for the first}} time there was a measure <b>of</b> <b>curiosity</b> <b>in</b> her earnest gaze. Tavernake was, in his way, good enough to look upon. He was well-built, his {{shoulders}} and physique all spoke of strength. His features were firmly cut, although his general expression was gloomy. But for a certain moroseness, an uncouthness which he seemed to cultivate, he might even have been deemed good-looking.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very fair, thank you," [...] Philip {{answered}} a little vaguely.

50|$|He was {{the author}} of De mirabilibus mundi ('The wonders of the world') which circulatedboth under the title Collectanea rerum memorabilium ('Collection of Curiosities'), and Polyhistor; but the latter title was favoured by the author. The work is indeed a {{description}} <b>of</b> <b>curiosities</b> <b>in</b> a chorographical framework. Adventus, to whom it is dedicated, is identified with Oclatinius Adventus, consul 218. It contains a short description of the ancient world, with remarks on historical, social, religious and natural history questions. The greater part is taken from Pliny's Natural History and the geography of Pomponius Mela.|$|R
