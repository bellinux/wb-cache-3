The school's demographics make it important to provide as much education as possible to students wishing to enter the workforce directly after high school. CTE programs provide the experience and education to qualify for additional college level vocational courses. CTE {{is vital to the}} 60% of students who do not seek further education at a 4-year university level. Most schools in California are currently phasing out CTE programs due to the state switching funding mechanisms to a program called Local Control. This means moneys that were set aside specifically for CTE programs by the state are now going into the school district's general fund, allowing the school to spend the money as it sees fit. Most schools like neighboring Willits High School are phasing out CTE and using the money to solve their budget problems. Fortunately, Ukiah's local business <b>owners,</b> <b>Superintendent</b> Debra Kubin, and Ukiah High School Principal Gordon Oslund are strong supporters of CTE programs. Their CTE programs are not only staying, but are in some categories expanding to accommodate larger numbers of students. Ukiah high school offers the following CTE courses: ...|$|E

Mines were more dangerous as they were dug deeper; it was increasingly recognized that poor working conditions as well as longer hours could be correlated with poor health.

He graduated from Tokyo Imperial University in 1895, and then had been concerned with many civil works in various Japanese towns. After he retired, {{he went back to}} his hometown, Abiko, and was active. One of the activities was organization of Teganuma-Aijima-readjustment of arable land-union. On the other hand, he constructed own earthen store house. He has tried to use the frontier technologies and materials being different from the past in this construction, however it was similar to the past to look at. For example, he used concrete for foundation work and adopted new waterproof materials for the wall. The documents of construction are preserved, and this earthen storehouse, about 80 years old, is in existence beautifully...|$|R
