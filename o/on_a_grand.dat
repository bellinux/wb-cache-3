5|$|Speer {{joined the}} Nazi Party in 1931, {{launching}} {{himself on a}} political and governmental career which lasted fourteen years. His architectural skills made him increasingly prominent within the Party and he {{became a member of}} Hitler's inner circle. Hitler instructed him to design and construct structures including the Reich Chancellery and the Zeppelinfeld stadium in Nuremberg where Party rallies were held. Speer also made plans to reconstruct Berlin <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> scale, with huge buildings, wide boulevards, and a reorganized transportation system.|$|E
5|$|The late 18th {{and early}} 19th centuries {{were marked by}} the {{establishment}} of tropical botanical gardens {{as a tool of}} colonial expansion (for trade and commerce and, secondarily, science) mainly by the British and Dutch, in India, South-east Asia and the Caribbean. This was also the time of Sir Joseph Banks's botanical collections during Captain James Cook's circumnavigations of the planet and his explorations of Oceania, which formed the last phase of plant introduction <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> scale.|$|E
5|$|The modern Regent Street is {{the result}} of this redevelopment. No {{original}} structures survive except south of Oxford Circus for some Nash-designed sewers. The current design {{is an example of the}} Beaux Arts approach to urban design: an assembly of separate buildings <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> scale, designed to harmonise and produce an impressive overall effect. Strict rules governed the reconstruction. Each block had to be designed with a continuous unifying street façade and finished in Portland stone. The first redevelopment was Regent House, just south of Oxford Circus. The stylistic tone for the rebuilding was set by Sir Reginald Blomfield's Quadrant.|$|E

5|$|Access to {{the central}} island {{occurred}} over a drawbridge, through a pair of gatehouses on the eastern side. Caerphilly Castle's Inner East Gatehouse, based on the gatehouse built at Tonbridge in the 1250s, reinforced a trend in gatehouse design across England and Wales. Sometimes termed a keep-gatehouse, the fortification had both exterior and interior defences, enabling it to be defended even if {{the perimeter of the}} castle was breached. Two huge towers flanked the gatehouse on either side of an entrance that was protected by portcullises and murder-holes. The substantial size of the gatehouse allowed it to be used for accommodation as well as defence and it was comfortably equipped <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> scale, probably {{for the use of the}} castle constable and his family. Another pair of gatehouses protected the west side.|$|E
5|$|After a slow start, {{in early}} 1942, Cascade {{began to take}} effect. As early as May, Axis {{intelligence}} began to overestimate Allied strength by nearly 30%. In July the operation expanded. Clarke introduced more and more fictitious divisions {{and by the end}} of the year the Germans had accepted many of them as real formations. By 1944, when the operation was superseded, it had completely fooled the enemy. Cascade was a major success for Clarke; it supported most of the subsequent major deceptions for the remainder of the war (by providing established fictional units) and proved that deception <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> scale was a realistic strategy.|$|E
5|$|As {{time went}} by, Matilda {{directed}} {{more of her}} attention to the Cistercian order, This order was very fashionable in England and Normandy during the period, and was dedicated to the Virgin Mary, a figure of particular importance to Matilda. She had close links to the Cistercian Mortemer Abbey in Normandy, and drew on the house for a supply of monks when she supported the foundation of nearby La Valasse. She encouraged the Cistercians to build at Mortemer <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> scale, with guest houses to accommodate a range of visitors of all ranks, and may have played a part in selecting the paintings for the monastic chapels.|$|E

5|$|Emily Sartain (March 17, 1841 – June 17, 1927) was an American {{painter and}} engraver. She {{was the first}} woman in Europe and the United States to {{practice}} the art of mezzotint engraving, and the only woman to win a gold medal at the 1876 World Fair in Philadelphia. Sartain became a nationally recognized art educator and was the director of the Philadelphia School of Design for Women from 1866 to 1920. Her father, John Sartain, and three of her brothers, William, Henry and Samuel were artists. Before she entered the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and studied abroad, her father took her <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Grand</b> Tour of Europe. She helped found the New Century Club for working and professional women, and the professional women's art clubs, The Plastic Club and The Three Arts Club.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the restored churches seen today falls in the period between 1745 and 1770 and {{is characterized by the}} use of locally available natural materials like wood, used in the carved columns, pulpits and sets of drawers. Artistic adornments were added even after the Jesuits’ expulsion in 1767, until around 1830. Some of the altars are covered in gold. Often the walls of the mission churches were made of adobe, the same material that had been used for the houses of the natives. In San Rafael de Velasco and San Miguel de Velasco, mica also was used on the walls, giving them an iridescent effect. The {{construction of}} the church in San José de Chiquitos is an exception: inspired by an unknown baroque model, it has a stone façade. The only other example where stone was used <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> scale is in the construction of San Juan Bautista, although only the ruins of a tower remain.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{strategy of}} Heraclius, {{to destroy the}} Muslim troops in Syria, needed a rapid and quick deployment, but the commanders on the ground never displayed these qualities. Ironically, on the field at Yarmouk, Khalid carried out on a small tactical scale what Heraclius had planned <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> strategic scale: by rapidly deploying and manoeuvering his forces, Khalid was able to temporarily concentrate sufficient forces at specific locations on the field to defeat the larger Byzantine army in detail. Vahan {{was never able to}} make his numerical superiority count, perhaps because of the unfavorable terrain that prevented large-scale deployment. However, at no point did Vahan attempt to concentrate a superior force to achieve a critical breakthrough. Although he was on the offensive 5 days out of the six, his battle line remained remarkably static. This all stands {{in stark contrast to the}} very successful offensive plan that Khalid carried out on the final day, when he reorganised virtually all his cavalry and committed them to a grand manoeuvre that won the battle.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> {{similar pattern}} <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>grander</b> scale {{was seen in}} Barnet where Henry Tubbs built Nether Court in 1883. This was {{ultimately}} to become the clubhouse of Finchley Golf Club in 1929 after his death.|$|R

5|$|The third Marquess of Bute, again called John, {{inherited}} {{the title and}} castle in 1848. He was then {{less than a year}} old, and as he grew up he came to despise the existing castle, believing that it represented a mediocre, half-hearted example of the Gothic style. Bute engaged the architect William Burges, to undertake the remodelling of the castle. The two shared a passion in medieval Gothic Revivalism and this, combined with Bute's huge financial resources, enabled Burges to rebuild the property <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> scale. Burges brought with him almost of all of the team that had supported him on earlier projects, including John Starling Chapple, William Frame and Horatio Lonsdale. Burges's contribution, in particular his research into the history of the castle and his architectural imagination, was critical to the transformation.|$|E
5|$|When {{this was}} {{effected}} in 1090, John {{became the first}} Bishop of Bath, and St Peter's was raised to cathedral status. As the roles of bishop and abbot had been combined, the monastery became a priory, run by its prior. With the elevation of the abbey to cathedral status, {{it was felt that}} a larger, more up-to-date building was required. John of Tours planned a new cathedral <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> scale, dedicated to Saint Peter and Saint Paul, but only the ambulatory was complete when he died in December 1122. He was buried in the cathedral. The most renowned scholar monk based in the abbey was Adelard of Bath; after his various travels he was back in the monastery by 1106.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{interior}} design of Norfolk House was {{to define the}} London town house for the next century. The floor plan {{was based on an}} adaptation of one of the secondary wings he had built at Holkham Hall. A circuit of reception rooms centred <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> staircase, with the staircase hall replacing the Italian traditional inner courtyard or two-storey hall. This arrangement of salons allowed guests at large parties to circulate, having been received {{at the head of the}} staircase, without doubling back on arriving guests. The second advantage was that while each room had access to the next, it also had access to the central stairs, thus allowing only one or two rooms to be used at a time for smaller functions. Previously, guests in London houses had had to reach the principal salon through a long enfilade of minor reception rooms. In this square and compact way, Brettingham came close to recreating the layout of an original Palladian Villa. He transformed what Andrea Palladio had conceived as a country retreat into a London mansion appropriate for the lifestyle of the British aristocracy, with its reversal of the usual Italian domestic pattern of a large palazzo in town, and a smaller villa in the country. As happened so often in Brettingham's career, Robert Adam later developed this design concept further, and was credited with its success. However, Brettingham's plan for Norfolk House was to serve as the prototype for many London mansions over the next few decades.|$|E

5|$|Most pre-race {{analyses}} identified Ivan Basso, Cadel Evans, and Carlos Sastre as {{the major}} favorites to win the overall classification, with Evans perhaps the consensus pick. Basso and Sastre had both ridden the Giro in 2009 and come away finishing in the top five. Sastre also won two difficult mountain stages in the race's final week, and was noted as a rider who gets stronger as a race goes along, making the Giro's very climbing-intensive third week possibly sit in his favor. Evans had finished <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Grand</b> Tour podium {{in each of the}} past three seasons, including in the most recent three-week event, the 2009 Vuelta a España. He also entered the race as the reigning world cycling champion and had had a successful 2010 season to date, with a win in La Flèche Wallonne and a podium finish in the Tirreno–Adriatico. Neither Basso nor Sastre had raced much in the 2010 season prior to the Giro. Other riders named as contenders included Bradley Wiggins, former Giro winners Damiano Cunego and Stefano Garzelli, Alexander Vinokourov, Marzio Bruseghin, Christian Vande Velde, Domenico Pozzovivo, David Moncoutié, and Michele Scarponi. Race director Angelo Zomegnan also named Basso, Evans, and Sastre as his three favorites, and included Wiggins and Linus Gerdemann as possible darkhorses.|$|E
