5|$|With Twitter, it wasn't {{clear what}} it was. They {{called it a}} social network, they called it microblogging, {{but it was hard}} to define, because it didn't replace anything. There was this path of {{discovery}} with something like that, where over time you figure <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> Twitter actually changed from what we thought it was in the beginning, which we described as status updates and a social utility. It is that, in part, but the insight we eventually came to was Twitter was really more of an information network than it is a social network.|$|E

500|$|... "Thirty Minutes Over Tokyo" [...] {{is one of}} two episodes {{that never}} aired in Japan (the other being season 11 episode [...] "Little Big Mom"). [...] The {{reasoning}} behind this was that a scene in the episode, which shows Homer throwing Akihito, the current emperor of Japan, into a box filled with sumo thongs, was considered disrespectful. There was also a rumor that Sanrio objected to the portrayal of the Hello Kitty factory featured briefly in the episode.

500|$|The album {{features}} aggressive multi-tracking of D'Angelo's voice, {{a technique}} {{similar to the}} production of Sly & the Family Stone's There's a Riot Goin' On (1971) and Marvin Gaye's Let's Get It On (1973). The multi-tracking on Voodoo significantly affected the clarity of D'Angelo's vocals. In Voodoos liner notes, Saul Williams wrote of its heavy use of multi-tracking, stating [...] "You might respond, 'Lyrics? Yo, I can't even understand half the shit that D'Angelo be saying. That nigga sounds like Bobby McFerrin on opium'. And I'd say, 'You're right. Neither can I. But I am drawn to figure <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> that he's saying. His vocal collaging intrigues me'". Music writers have also noted the production style and sound of Voodoo as reminiscent of the sound of the P-Funk opus Mothership Connection (1975), Gaye's downtempo disco-soul record I Want You (1976), and Miles Davis's jazz fusion works In a Silent Way (1969) and Bitches Brew (1970).|$|E

[...] Considered a spoof of television clip shows, the episode is seen drawing attention to prevailing televisual conventions and reminds viewers that The Simpsons itself participates actively in that same cultural legacy.|$|E

2500|$|Jimmy [...] was an {{education}} for me, {{as he was}} for most people who {{came in contact with}} him. ... taught me about art and developed my taste, but I didn't begin to understand about making work until later with Yvonne Rainer. [...] From her I found <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> to be an artist [...] a person who makes choices and stands behind them. [...] Then, from working with Trisha Brown in the Grand Union, I learned how to edit, how to boil a thing down to its essence. Jimmy's approach was much more whimsical. His way of working led you [...] or led me at any rate [...] to accept any idea as valid simply because I'd thought of it. [...] I thought of it and I kept it, and what came next was what I thought of next. [...] I don't believe Jimmy meant to absolve me of all responsibility for my work, but I got the impression that wild intuitive guessing was all I had to do to make art. [...] I never threw anything away. [...] I remember distinctly Jimmy's saying, [...] "If you don't like it now, you can get to like it. [...] If you can't get to like it, who says you have to like it?" [...] The point of it was to demystify art and free the artist from the limitations of his own taste. [...] There was a great sense of liberation that stemmed from John Cage's championing of this philosophy, and Jimmy, among others, was establishing alternatives to the kind of teaching that had dominated modern-dance composition up until then.|$|E
