5000|$|Process thought {{describes}} {{truth as}} [...] "movement" [...] {{in and through}} substance (Hegelian truth), rather than substances as fixed concepts or [...] "things" [...] (Aristotelian truth). Since Whitehead, process thought is distinguished from Hegel in that it describes entities that arise or coalesce in becoming, rather than being simply dialectically determined from prior posited determinates. These entities {{are referred to as}} complexes of occasions of experience. It is also distinguished in being not necessarily conflictual or oppositional in <b>operation.</b> <b>Process</b> may be integrative, destructive or both together, allowing for aspects of interdependence, influence, and confluence, and addressing coherence in universal as well as particular developments, i.e., those aspects not befitting Hegel's system. Additionally, instances of determinate occasions of experience, while always ephemeral, are nonetheless seen as important to define the type and continuity of those occasions of experience that flow from or relate to them.|$|E
5000|$|The {{main issue}} of the trial was the {{definition}} of [...] "operating an aircraft." [...] In {{order to get a}} conviction, the state had to prove the pilots were in control of the plane while under the influence of alcohol. The prosecution contended that the pilots were operating the aircraft from the moment they assumed responsibility for the plane. An America West operations manager testified that Cloyd signed a dispatch release accepting responsibility for the Airbus. When they arrived on the plane, prosecutors said, Cloyd and Hughes began several steps to complete the <b>operation</b> <b>process.</b> Hughes performed several safety checks and received clearance to input flight directives. The prosecution also heavily stressed Cloyd and Hughes' blood alcohol levels, which were taken nearly three hours after they arrived at the airport and over seven hours after they had their last drink. One state witness even suggested that at the time they arrived on the plane, the pilots may have had blood alcohol levels as high as 0.15.|$|E

It has defined the engine configuration and performances. This work {{was completed by}} issue of technical proposal. On {{the basis of this}} work RKK «Energia» has issued specification for RD-0126 engine development that was presented in two variants:Engine RD0126 - with a traditional Laval nozzle chamber, and RD0126Э with an expansion-deflection nozzle and ring throat (chief designer V. Grokhov, lead designer - I. Liplyavy).Engine RD0126Э has the following advantages as compared to traditional LREs:equal length, but higher vacuum Isp;lighter weight with the same Isp;possibility to obtain higher hydrogen temperature in cooling channels, which allows to use it as working medium for TPA turbine rotation;possibility of engine ground testing performed under high-altitude conditions without gas-dynamic tube. In 1998, test bench chamber with ring throat was tested. 5 sea level fire tests were performed that confirmed combustion products flow without boundary layer separation within high-altitude nozzle, which makes engine development considerably simpler.

50|$|Reliability of {{semiconductors}} is kept high {{through several}} methods. Cleanrooms control impurities,process control controls processing, and burn-in (short term operation at extremes) and probe and test reduce escapes. Probe (wafer prober) tests the semiconductor die, prior to packaging, via micro-probes connected to test equipment. Wafer testing tests the packaged device, often pre-, and post burn-in {{for a set}} of parameters that assure <b>operation.</b> <b>Process</b> and design weaknesses are identified by applying a set of stress tests in the qualification phase of the semiconductors before their market introduction e. g. according to the AEC Q100 and Q101 stress qualifications. Parts Average Testing is a statistical method for recognizing and quarantining semiconductor die that have a higher probability of reliability failures. This technique identifies characteristics that are within specification but outside of a normal distribution for that population as at-risk outliers not suitable for high reliability applications. Tester-based Parts Average Testing varieties include Parametric Parts Average Testing (P-PAT) and Geographical Parts Average Testing (G-PAT), among others. Inline Parts Average Testing (I-PAT) uses data from production process control inspection and metrology to perform the outlier recognition function.|$|E
5000|$|This {{proposal}} {{intended to}} combine {{a number of}} innovative transport options into one trip (hence 'Experience'), while still cutting the travelling time to the Sound by about one hour each way (previous hopes of longer savings seem unlikely to be realised). In Queenstown travellers would have boarded 25-m catamarans capable of carrying up to 240 people. These would cross Lake Wakatipu to the south-western shore, 20 km away. There, passengers would travel up the mountain on an existing back-country road, using specially constructed all-terrain coaches on balloon tyres (to reduce impact on the road). Arriving at the Kiwi Burn swing bridge terminal, tourists will continue on a mechanical (as opposed to maglev) monorail travelling 35 minutes through high country and native bush for a distance of 41 km, {{which would be the}} longest monorail connection in the world, before joining up with a bus park and ride facility on the existing road to Milford Sound north of Te Anau. Three passing loops along the line would allow four trains to run, at speeds of up to 90 km/h. Kiwi Burns Saddle, the highest point of the journey, is 675 m above sea level, and the higher-altitude section of the rail would be heated to prevent snow-buildup in winter. Each monorail train would seat 160 passengers, consisting of 16 articulated 2.6 m wide sections totalling 66 m in length. Only one train would be constructed initially. The proposal, which would cost up to NZ$132 million, would have to achieve around 220,000 two-way passengers per year to be viable. Compared to the Milford Dart project, the backers, Infinity Investment Group, believed that they would have an easier time achieving consents, as the proposal does not touch upon any National Parks, and the construction and <b>operation</b> <b>process</b> was considered to be very ecologically sustainable, {{such as the use of}} comparatively small piles for the monorail which will be bored and placed from a working vehicle moving forward on the rail being constructed, thus making construction roads unnecessary. Originally it was hoped that the consent process would start in mid 2007, with commercial operations beginning in 2011. That, however, did not happen. In October 2013 it was reported that the New Zealand Conservation Minister was supportive of the project." [...] On 29 May 2014, the Conservation Minister Nick Smith rejected the proposal saying the $240 million plan [...] "does not stack up either economically or environmentally." ...|$|E
40|$|The {{problems}} {{presented in}} this article deal with <b>operation</b> <b>process</b> control in complex systems of technological object operation. Making appropriate control decisions directly influences the possibility of correct and effective carrying out of tasks assigned to the system. The paper presents a method of determining the optimal strategy for control of technological object <b>operation</b> <b>process</b> on the basis of genetic algorithm. In the presented method, determining of optimal strategy for control of technological object <b>operation</b> <b>process</b> involves the choice of a sequence of control decisions made in individual states of the modeled <b>operation</b> <b>process.</b> The method involves a choice, out of the possible decision options, of the best strategy for <b>operation</b> <b>process</b> control for which the function constituting the evaluation criterion has extreme value.
