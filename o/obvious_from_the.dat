5|$|A {{detailed}} re-assessment of the taphonomy by palaeontologist Martin Sander of the University of Bonn, Germany, {{found that}} the mud-miring hypothesis first suggested by Fraas is true: animals above a certain body weight sank into the mud, which was further liquefied by their attempts to free themselves. Sander's scenario, similar to that proposed for the famous Rancho La Brea Tar Pits, {{is the only one}} explaining all taphonomic data. The degree of completeness of the carcasses was not influenced by transport, which is <b>obvious</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> lack of indications for transport before burial, but rather by how much the dead animals were scavenged. Juveniles of Plateosaurus and other taxa of herbivores were too light to sink into the mud or managed to extract themselves, and were thus not preserved. Similarly, scavenging theropods were not trapped due to their lower body weights, combined with proportionally larger feet. There is no indication of herding, or of catastrophic burial of such a herd, or catastrophic accumulation of animals that previously died isolated elsewhere.|$|E

25|$|The {{field of}} {{numerical}} analysis predates {{the invention of}} modern computers by many centuries. Linear interpolation was already in use more than 2000 years ago. Many great mathematicians of the past were preoccupied by numerical analysis, as is <b>obvious</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> names of important algorithms like Newton's method, Lagrange interpolation polynomial, Gaussian elimination, or Euler's method.|$|E

25|$|Although the {{analytical}} index is usually hard to evaluate directly, {{it is at}} least obviously an integer. The topological index is by definition a rational number, but it is usually not at all <b>obvious</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> definition that it is also integral. So the Atiyah–Singer index theorem implies some deep integrality properties, as it implies that the topological index is integral.|$|E
25|$|A lasting {{consequence}} of Burr's {{role in the}} election of 1800 was the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which changed {{the way in which}} vice presidents were chosen. As was <b>obvious</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 1800 election, the situation could easily arise where the vice president, as the defeated presidential candidate, could not work well with the president. The Twelfth Amendment required that votes be cast separately for president and vice president.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} regimen is 2HRE/7HR, {{for which}} there is excellent clinical trial evidence. The 1994 US CDC guidelines for tuberculosis erroneously cite Slutkin as evidence that a nine-month regimen using only isoniazid and rifampicin is acceptable, but almost all of the patients in that study received ethambutol for the first two to three months (although this is not <b>obvious</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> abstract of that article). This mistake was rectified in the 2003 guidelines.|$|E

25|$|It {{is worth}} noting that the spinor Lie {{derivative}} is independent of the metric, and hence also of the connection. This is not <b>obvious</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> right-hand side of Kosmann's local expression, as the right-hand side seems to depend on the metric through the spin connection (covariant derivative), the dualisation of vector fields (lowering of the indices) and the Clifford multiplication on the spinor bundle. Such is not the case: the quantities on the right-hand side of Kosmann's local expression combine so as to make all metric and connection dependent terms cancel.|$|E
25|$|Most {{promoting}} pieces {{promote to}} a piece {{that exists in the}} initial setup of the board. However, such a promoted piece cannot then promote a second time as its namesake does. For example, a lion promotes to a furious fiend. However, while an eastern barbarian promotes to a lion on its first capturing move, it does not further promote to a furious fiend on its second. Rather, it remains a lion {{for the rest of the}} game. This should be <b>obvious</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> game pieces, which only have two sides.|$|E
25|$|Mohenjo-daro had no {{series of}} city walls, but was {{fortified}} with guard towers {{to the west}} of the main settlement, and defensive fortifications to the south. Considering these fortifications and the structure of other major Indus valley cities like Harappa, it is postulated that Mohenjo-daro was an administrative center. Both Harappa and Mohenjo-daro share relatively the same architectural layout, and were generally not heavily fortified like other Indus Valley sites. It is <b>obvious</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> identical city layouts of all Indus sites that there was some kind of political or administrative centrality, but the extent and functioning of an administrative center remains unclear.|$|E

25|$|While {{initially}} {{the idea of}} ordering two similar but technically different series of ships for the same purpose was to gain operational experience for the future arctic freighters, shortly after the deal was made public the shipyards approached Sudoimport {{to agree on a}} uniform design. Not only was running two parallel development projects wasting effort and resources for the shipyards, but constructing a single type of ships instead of two would bring savings to the customer in form of reduced maintenance and spare part costs. Wärtsilä's design was chosen as the standard for further development since it was ahead in the production schedule. However, despite the co-operative measures some dissimilarities between the ships built by Wärtsilä and Valmet remained, resulting in the crews considering of them as separate types of ships as the differences were most <b>obvious</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> operator's point of view.|$|E
25|$|Grigg intercepted and {{ran back}} briefly towards his own line to link with his colleagues and to clear the onrushing Scots...

Ella gave Campese room and Tuynman hung about waiting to play his part. Campese drew the last serious defender to him, flicked the ball to Tuynman and moved into place for the return. It worked like a dream and there was Campese with half the pitch to run and only John Beattie near him. Beattie did well to stay the same three metres behind Campese as they hurtled down the touchline, {{but there was never}} a doubt that Campese would score...Campese's effort won the try-of-the-tour award from the brewers.|$|E
25|$|Out {{of reach}} of its parish, the church {{deteriorated}} year by year. By {{the end of the}} 1970s, it became <b>obvious</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> West Berlin side of the Havel that the building was in substantial danger. The tin surface of the roof had become fragmented. Some edges of the nave were settled by plants. Some people in West Berlin started a campaign to stop the decay of the church. A great deal of the merit for the preservation of the building is due to Richard von Weizsäcker, at that time Mayor of West Berlin. By protracted negotiations with the responsible Protestant church body, the Evangelical Church in Berlin-Brandenburg and the authorities of the GDR and through the promise of sharing the costs, he won the agreement of the East German section of Berlin-Brandenburg's Protestant church to organize the restoration of the exterior of the building. At the beginning of the works in 1984, the sculptures of the Twelve Apostles were saved and stored. Other wooden furnishings, such as the twelve corbels and the gallery, still in evidence in pictures taken in 1981, were lost.|$|E

25|$|The first Etruscan King of Rome, Tarquinius Priscus, succeeded king Ancus Marcius. It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that Rome had been conquered by the Etruscans, but this is unlikely. The city was located in an easily defensible position, and its rapid growth attracted {{people from all over the}} region. The city's liberal policy of extending citizenship probably created an opportunity for a skillful leader to gain the throne. The reign of the first four kings was distinct from that of the last three. The first kings were elected. Between the reigns of the final three kings, however, the monarchy became hereditary, and thus the Senate became subordinated to the king. The fact that the monarchy became hereditary is <b>obvious</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> kinship among those three kings, as well as from the lack of interregna. The fact that the auspices did not revert to the Senate upon the deaths of those kings constituted a serious erosion of the Senate's authority, because it prevented the Senate from electing a monarch of its choosing. This violation of the Senate's sovereignty, rather than an intolerable tyranny, was probably what led the patricians in the Senate to overthrow the last king. The king may have sought the support of the plebeians, but the plebeians were no doubt exhausted from their continued military service and from their forced labor in the construction of public works, and were probably also embittered by their lack of political power. Therefore, they did not come to the aide of either the king or the Senate.|$|E
