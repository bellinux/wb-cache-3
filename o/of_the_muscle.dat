5|$|Muscle {{cells have}} another {{specialized}} function of smooth ER. The ER membrane pumps calcium ions from the cytosol into the cisternal space.

5|$|The {{diagnosis}} is usually made on electromyography (EMG), {{which is one}} of the standard tests in the investigation of otherwise unexplained muscle weakness. This involves the insertion of small needles into the nerves supplying several muscles, administering small electrical impulses through these needles, and measuring the electrical response <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> in question. Two EMG investigations can be characteristic in LEMS: compound motor action potentials (CMAPs) and single-fiber examination.|$|E

5|$|Damage to {{skeletal}} muscle may take various forms. Crush and other physical injuries cause damage to muscle cells directly or interfere with blood supply, while non-physical causes interfere with muscle cell metabolism. When damaged, muscle tissue rapidly fills with fluid from the bloodstream, including sodium ions. The swelling itself {{may lead to}} destruction of muscle cells, but those cells that survive are subject to various disruptions that lead to rise in intracellular calcium ions; the accumulation of calcium outside the sarcoplasmic reticulum leads to continuous muscle contraction and depletion of ATP, the main carrier {{of energy in the}} cell. ATP depletion can itself lead to uncontrolled calcium influx. The persistent contraction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> cell leads to breakdown of intracellular proteins and disintegration of the cell.|$|E
5|$|The {{size of a}} {{synthesized}} protein can {{be measured}} {{by the number of}} amino acids it contains and by its total molecular mass, which is normally reported in units of daltons (synonymous with atomic mass units), or the derivative unit kilodalton (kDa). The average size of protein increases from Archaea, Bacteria to Eukaryote (283, 311, 438 residues and 31, 34, 49 kDa respecitvely) due bigger number of protein domains constituting proteins in higher organisms. For instance, yeast proteins are on average 466 amino acids long and 53 kDa in mass. The largest known proteins are the titins, a component <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> sarcomere, with a molecular mass of almost 3,000 kDa and a total length of almost 27,000 amino acids.|$|E

5|$|He {{concluded}} that the caudofemoralis muscles which link the tail bones and the upper leg bones could have assisted Tyrannosaurus in leg retraction and enhanced its running ability, agility and balance. The caudofemoralis muscle {{would have been a}} key muscle in femoral retraction; pulling back the leg at the femur. The study also found that theropod skeletons such as those of Tyrannosaurus had adaptations (such as elevated transverse processes in the tail vertebrae) to enable the growth of larger tail muscles and that Tyrannosaurus's tail muscle mass may have been underestimated by over 25 percent and perhaps as much as 45 percent. The caudofemoralis muscle was found to comprise 58 percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> mass in the tail of Tyrannosaurus. Tyrannosaurus also had the largest absolute and relative caudofemoralis muscle mass out of the three extinct organisms in the study. This is because Tyrannosaurus also had additional adaptations to enable large tail muscles; the elongation of its tail's hemal arches. According to Persons, the increase in tail muscle mass would have moved the center of mass closer to the hindquarters and hips which would have lessened the strain on the leg muscles to support its weight; improving its overall balance and agility. This would also have made the animal less front-heavy, thus reducing rotational inertia. Persons also notes that the tail is also rich in tendons and septa which could have been stores of elastic energy, and thereby improved locomotive efficiency. Persons adds that this means non-avian theropods actually had broader tails than previously depicted, as broad or broader laterally than dorsoventrally near the base.|$|E
