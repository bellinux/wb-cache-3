5|$|A leat {{from this}} stretch was created at {{around the time}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> the canal to provide water for the Twyford Mead water meadows. Farming of the water meadows {{continued}} until around 1930, after {{the closure of the}} navigation itself. It was a labour-intensive method of land management, but the controlled flooding of the meadows, with the deposition of silt from the water, enabled the land to produce two crops of hay per year, as well as grazing for sheep and cattle. Demonstrations of the techniques used to flood the meadows are still carried out occasionally.|$|E

The evening ranged across all musical types from popular to classical.|$|E
5|$|In 1855, {{the road}} from Marcellus to Camillus along the Nine Mile Creek route was {{improved}} by the Camillus and Marcellus Plank Road Company, which was first chartered in 1853 and authorized to collect tolls from travelers using the road. The improvement of the road led to it becoming a stagecoach route {{in the middle of}} the 19th century. The former plank road alignment in the village of Marcellus (North Street) and the southward continuation along Cherry Street (now South Street) was paved in 1911 as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> a new state highway that would pass through the town.|$|E

5|$|In 1927, Route 3 was legislated {{along the}} Paterson Plank Road portion of present-day Route 120. It was {{eventually}} designated {{along the entire}} portion of current Route 120. In 1953, Route 3 was moved to its current freeway alignment, replacing Route S3, and a portion of Route 20 was designated to run from current Route 3 north to Paterson Plank Road while Paterson Plank Road {{was removed from the}} state highway system. The portion of Paterson Plank Road that lost its state highway status in 1953 gained it back in 1972, when it became an extension of Route 20 as a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> the Meadowlands Sports Complex. As this route was not connected to the mainline of Route 20, it was designated Route 120 by the 1990s. As a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> American Dream Meadowlands, the interchange between Route 3 and Route 120 was improved. An overpass between eastbound Route 3 and northbound Route 120 was completed in 2009 and a flyover from southbound Route 120 to eastbound Route 3 was completed in 2010.|$|E
