40|$|We {{present a}} {{proof of concept}} that machine {{learning}} techniques {{can be used to}} predict the properties of CNOHF energetic molecules from their molecular structures. We focus on a small but diverse dataset consisting of 109 molecular structures spread across ten compound classes. Up until now, candidate molecules for energetic materials have been screened using predictions from expensive quantum simulations and thermochemical codes. We present a comprehensive comparison of machine learning models and several molecular featurization methods - sum <b>over</b> <b>bonds,</b> custom descriptors, Coulomb matrices, Bag of Bonds, and fingerprints. The best featurization was sum <b>over</b> <b>bonds</b> (bond counting), and the best model was kernel ridge regression. Despite having a small data set, we obtain acceptable errors and Pearson correlations for the prediction of detonation pressure, detonation velocity, explosive energy, heat of formation, density, and other properties out of sample. By including another dataset with 309 additional molecules in our training we show how the error can be pushed lower, although the convergence with number of molecules is slow. Our work paves the way for future applications of machine learning in this domain, including automated lead generation and interpreting machine learning models to obtain novel chemical insights.

We relate this premium to the underlying sources of liquidity supply and demand. On the supply side, we find that arbitrageurs faced low direct costs but high frictions, and that the largest premium coincided with a high price charged by market makers to carry new positions. On the demand side, we find that those investors in more distress or with more active trading strategies demanded the notes relatively more as the premium grew...|$|R

40|$|We {{decompose}} {{the term}} structure of expected equity returns into (1) the real short rate, (2) {{a premium for}} holding real long-term bonds, or the real duration premium, the excess returns of nominal long-term <b>bonds</b> <b>over</b> real <b>bonds</b> which reflects (3) expected inflation and (4) inflation risk, and (5) a real cashflow risk premium, which is the excess return of equity <b>over</b> nominal <b>bonds.</b> All of these risk premiums vary over time. The shape of the unconditional nominal and real bond yield curves are upward sloping due to increasing duration and inflation risk premiums. The average term structures of expected equity returns and equity risk premiums, in contrast, are downward sloping due to the decreasing effect of short-term expected inflation, or trend inflation, across horizons. Around 70 % of the variation of expected equity returns at the 10 -year horizon is due to variation in the output gap and trend inflation. ...|$|R
