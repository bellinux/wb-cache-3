25|$|The strap can be {{adjusted}} to suit the diver's head. Too loose may not provide an effective seal and the mask may dislodge easily, and too tight may result in discomfort or pain.

25|$|Standard {{maintenance}} is to rinse {{inside and out}} with clean, fresh water after each day's use, and allow to dry out of direct sunlight before storage.

40|$|Abstract: Introduction Aiming {{to achieve}} a {{simplified}} ventral hernia repair, a proprietary shaped mesh was experimentally tested in the porcine model. The mesh is structured with a large central body and radiating <b>straps.</b> <b>The</b> friction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>straps</b> passing through <b>the</b> tissues are hypothesized to be adequate to maintain the mesh in place during tissue ingrowth, avoiding classic point fixation while ensuring a wide coverage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> abdomen. Methods The mesh, having 6 radial straps, was placed using a sublay preperitoneal technique in 4 pigs. All straps were passed laterally through the abdominal wall and exteriorized from <b>the</b> skin. <b>The</b> <b>straps</b> were trimmed at <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> skin, allowing the stumps to recoil into the subcutaneous space. The animal were euthanized at 1 and 4 months to determine <b>the</b> integration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>straps.</b> Results Macroscopically all 24 straps were firmly incorporated within the abdominal wall. The tension free placement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mesh by using <b>the</b> <b>straps</b> was effective. <b>The</b> friction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>straps</b> passing through <b>the</b> tissues was adequate to keep the mesh well orientated. No dislocation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> implants was observed. <b>The</b> <b>strap</b> system also allowed a broader coverage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> abdominal wall, far beyond the wound opening. Conclusions The described arm system <b>of</b> <b>the</b> described implant seems {{to be effective in}} eliminating point fixation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mesh. The fixation arms seemed to have ensured the mesh stayed orientated in all animals. A very wide lateral mesh placement was accomplished, assuring sufficient defect overlap when shrinkage occurs...|$|R

2500|$|Video game {{web site}} IGN {{reported}} that the strap tends to break under heavy use, which would potentially send the Wii Remote flying in various directions. [...] also sometimes requires the Wii Remote to be dropped, which would cause problems {{in the event of}} a strap failure. In response, Nintendo has posted guidelines on proper use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>strap</b> and the Wii Remote. On December 8, 2006, units with thicker straps began to appear in some areas of the world. On December 15, 2006, Nintendo denied reports of a Wii wrist strap recall. While Nintendo refuted claims that three million straps had been recalled, it provided replacement wrist straps free of charge for users who have broken theirs. However, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission has become involved in the [...] "replacement program". The old [...] diameter strap is replaced by a larger, [...] diameter version. Nintendo's online [...] allows owners to receive up to four free straps when a Wii serial number and shipping details are provided.|$|E

40|$|Complex {{protrusions}} {{and surface}} indentations on spacecraft equipment alter exposure environments by casting shadows, producing reflections and scattering incident atomic oxygen flux and UV radiation. A computer model {{is being developed}} to predict these effects. The model accounts for any arbitrary shape, size, orientation, or curvature of exposed objects. LDEF offers {{a unique opportunity to}} compare model prediction with observations. For this purpose, a study is underway on twelve of LDEF's copper grounding straps. These straps were exposed at various angles from the ram vector during the LDEF flight. Microenvironment variables include shadowing and reflections from clamps and fasteners, and varying exposure caused by bending <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>straps.</b> Strap measurements include optical properties, surface film composition by ESCA, and film thickness measurements by optical interference techniques. <b>The</b> features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> microenvironment model and the analytical methods used to examine <b>the</b> <b>straps</b> are discussed.

40|$|In <b>the</b> {{representative}} embodiment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> invention disclosed, a load limiting, {{energy absorbing}} net is arranged to overlay a normally-covered vent opening in <b>the</b> rear bulkhead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> space orbiter vehicle.

By arranging these stitches to be successively torn away at a load below <b>the</b> <b>strap</b> strength in response to forces acting on the retainers that are less than <b>the</b> combined strength <b>of</b> <b>the</b> retainers, this tearing action serves as a predictable compact energy absorber for safely halting the cover plate as the retainers are extended as the net is deployed.

40|$|A {{finite element}} model of a {{fracture}} test specimen is developed using the STAGS com-puter code (STructural Analysis <b>of</b> General Shells). <b>The</b> test specimen was an internally pressurized, aluminum cylindrical shell reinforced with two externally bonded aluminum tear straps around its circumference.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{fretting}} fatigue behaviour of pin-loaded carbon-fibre-reinforced polymer (CFRP) straps studied as models for rigging systems in sailing yachts, for suspenders of arch bridges and for pendent cables in cranes. Eight straps were subjected to an ultimate tensile strength test. In total, 26 straps were subjected to a fretting fatigue test, of which ten did not fail. An S–N curve was generated for a load ratio R of 0. 1 and a frequency f of 10 Hz, showing a fatigue limit stress <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>straps</b> around <b>the</b> matrix fatigue limit, corresponding to 46 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> straps’ ultimate tensile strength (σUTS). The fatigue limit was defined as 3 million load cycles (N = 3 × 106), but tests were even conducted up to N = 11. 09 × 106. Catastrophic failure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>straps</b> was initiated in their vertex areas. Investigations on the residual strength and stiffness properties <b>of</b> <b>straps</b> tested around <b>the</b> fatigue limit stress (for N ≥ 1 × 106) showed little influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fatigue loading on these properties.
