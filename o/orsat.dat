DAS predicted that an uncontrolled reentry of the EUVE spacecraft would result in a total casualty area of 12. 41 sq m, which exceeds the 8 sq m limit set in the NASA standards and implies a potential human casualty risk of approximately 1 in 5300.

40|$|Reentry {{analysis}} {{is essential to}} understanding {{the consequences of the}} full life cycle of a spacecraft. Since reentry is a key factor in spacecraft development, NASA and ESA have separately developed tools to assess the survivability of objects during reentry. Criteria such as debris casualty area and impact energy are particularly important to understanding the risks posed to people on Earth. Therefore, NASA and ESA have undertaken a series of comparison studies of their respective reentry codes for verification and improvements in accuracy. The NASA Object Reentry Survival Analysis Tool (<b>ORSAT)</b> and the ESA Spacecraft Atmospheric Reentry and Aerothermal Breakup (SCARAB) reentry analysis tools serve as standard codes for reentry survivability assessment of satellites. These programs predict whether an object will demise during reentry and calculate the debris casualty area of objects determined to survive, establishing the reentry risk posed to the Earth's population by surviving debris. A series of test cases have been studied for comparison and the most recent uses "Testsat," a conceptual satellite composed of generic parts, defined to use numerous simple shapes and various materials for a better comparison of the predictions of these two codes. This study is an improvement on the others in this series because of increased consistency in modeling techniques and variables. The overall comparison demonstrated that the two codes arrive at similar results. Either most objects modeled resulted in close agreement between the two codes, or if the difference was significant, the variance could be explained as a case of semantics in the model definitions.

NASA's orbital debris engineering model, ORDEM, represents the current and near-term Earth orbital debris population from the largest spacecraft to the smallest debris in a manner which permits spacecraft engineers and experimenters to estimate the frequency and velocity with which a satellite may be struck by debris of different sizes. Using expanded databases and a new program design, ORDEM 2000 provides a more accurate environment definition combined with a much broader array of output products in comparison with its predecessor, ORDEM 96. Studies of the potential long-term space debris environment are now conducted with EVOLVE 4. 0, which incorporates significant advances in debris characterization and breakup modeling. An adjunct to EVOLVE 4. 0, GEO EVOLVE has been created to examine debris issues near the geosynchronous orbital regime.

40|$|Pijarist Francesco Maria Appendini (1768 - 1837) proveo je gotovo pola stoljeća kao nastavnik u dubrovačkom Kolegiju pijarista/skolopa. Svoje retoričko umijeće pokazao je i na javnim skupovima, poput sastanaka Domoljubnog društva kojemu se pridružio još kao mladić, nedugo po dolasku u Dubrovnik, ili istupa s propovjedaonice. Pohvalni govor na ispraćaju kneza Orsata Gozze u katedrali u ljeto 1798. omogućio mu je da pred najuglednijim domaćim slušateljstvom oprezno pozove na reformu dubrovačkog društva, barem u domeni pedagoškog rada, oslanjajući se na engleski racionalizam. Iako Appendinijevi prijedlozi nisu bespogovorno prihvaćeni, ipak su i protivnici poput satiričara Junija Restija cije nili iznesena stajališta i isticali važnost engleske kulture. Time njegova politička retorika postaje značajno sredstvo za prenošenje poruke, uz pedagoški, spisateljski i dušebrižnički rad. Piarist Francesco Maria Appendini (1768 - 1837) {{spent almost}} fifty {{years as a}} teacher at the Piarist/Scolope Collegium in Dubrovnik. His enthusiasm for Latin rhetoric was also {{recognised}} outside the classroom walls as he delivered sermons in church and in public. As member of the Patriotic Society (Società patriotica), which gathered young patricians interested in social reforms {{under the influence of the}} French Enlightenment and English Rationalism, he advocated for the reform of the Ragusan school system and for the education of the local children abroad, at certain Italian schools in particular. The seeds of this idea he found in the treatise Some Thoughts Concerning Education written by John Locke, which he tried to adjust to the specific circumstances in Dubrovnik. Unlike Locke, Appendini did not incline towards radical social changes, as he believed that patrician children were the only ones to inherit their fathers and assume power when the time came, and rescue the state from the crisis. His disposition towards English culture has earned Appendini a rightful position among the educated Ragusans who were known to learn English and acquire professional and literary books even though they did not always share his views. Thus Junije Resti, the satirist, rejected the proposal for the children to study abroad and mocked the habits of his fellow-citizens in blindly following foreign customs. Since Appendini and Resti knew each other well, upon the request of the latter’s widow Appendini wrote an extensive introduction to a collection of Resti’s satires, printed in Padua in 1816, in which he spoke highly of Resti’s life-long learning and continuous advancement in law, languages, philosophy and sciences, believing it to be the only right path towards true statesmanship. Similar views Appendini had stated some twenty years earlier, in June 1798, while addressing the highest representatives of the Ragusan state and Church during the funeral ceremony of <b>Orsat</b> Gozze, the last Ragusan rector who died on duty. Privileged to have been chosen to deliver the oration in rector’s honour, Appendini decided to ascribe all Gozze’s achievements to his profound learning and individual striving that brought him firm character and broad knowledge. Graced by the glory of his forefathers, who, “from the very foundation of the city”, worked to the benefit of Dubrovnik, Rector <b>Orsat</b> Gozze in Appendini’s eyes had become a symbol of a responsible statesman and rational man. These achievements he owed most directly to his study of the treatises on law, philosophy, theology and natural philosophy written mostly by English, German or Dutch authors (Francis Bacon, John Locke, Johann Wolf, Pieter van Musschenbroek, Willem Jacob ‘s Gravesande), with special reference to an Italian Guido Grandi and Euclid, ancient mathematician. Sadly, Appendini failed to mention any of Gozze’s concrete works inspired by these treatises, nor did he refer to his contributions to the state, if any. He only praised Gozze’s interest in art and his valuable art collection, acquired during his visits to the Apennine Peninsula. Appendini took advantage of the occasion to render his political views and to repeat the message on the necessity to invest into the school system and culture as a pledge for the future, in which new generations would eradicate nepotism and corruption as the greatest social evils. An insight into archival sources provides a more complete but also more objective picture of <b>Orsat</b> Gozze. A caring husband and good brother, in a marriage with no offspring he designated his wife Mara as universal heir, on condition that she provided for his sisters in the convent and a brother who had been promised life rent. Apparently, Gozze did not manage to resolve an old and ongoing dispute with his cousins over property which snowballed because of his father’s imprudent decision, but finally ended in settlement only a few years upon the Republic’s fall. The establishment of the French and later Austrian rule had no impact on Appendini’s position at the Ragusan Collegium. His social status remained intact, which prompted his former students to accuse him of opportunism. This accusation we discard as unjust, because he persevered in his advocation of the investments in schooling, acquisition of new knowledge and opening towards new cultures as basis of the development of an individual as well as the society that rests upon him. That is the core of Appendini’s political theory...|$|E

Rather it was to lay the foundation for future work along the same lines but with more complex situations should the techniques prove satisfactory. With reference to the study of a two-dimensional jet normal to a moving stream, and for the limited number of variables involved, it may be stated The penetration of a two-dimensional jet normal to a moving stream {{is a function of the}} jet density and velocity, the moving stream density and velocity, the distance downstream of the jet and the diameter of an equivalent area circle. The diffusion of a two-dimensional jet normal to a moving stream depends on the distance from the wall containing the jet orifice, the distance downstream of the jet, the jet velocity and the moving stream velocity.

40|$|NASA's Debris Assessment Software (DAS) {{has been}} {{substantially}} revised and expanded. DAS {{is designed to}} assist NASA programs in performing orbital debris assessments, as described in NASA s Guidelines and Assessment Procedures for Limiting Orbital Debris. The extensive upgrade of DAS was undertaken to reflect changes in the debris mitigation guidelines, to incorporate recommendations from DAS users, and {{to take advantage of}} recent software capabilities for greater user utility. DAS 2. 0 includes an updated environment model and enhanced orbital propagators and reentry-survivability models. The ORDEM 96 debris environment model has been replaced by ORDEM 2000 in DAS 2. 0, which is also designed to accept anticipated revisions to the environment definition. Numerous upgrades have also been applied to the assessment of human casualty potential due to reentering debris. Routines derived from the Object Reentry Survival Analysis Tool, Version 6 (<b>ORSAT</b> 6), determine which objects are assessed to survive reentry, and the resulting risk of human casualty is calculated directly based upon the orbital inclination and a future world population database. When evaluating reentry risks, the user may enter up to 200 unique hardware components for each launched object, in up to four nested levels. This last feature allows the software to more accurately model components that are exposed below the initial breakup altitude. The new DAS 2. 0 provides an updated set of tools for users to assess their mission s compliance with the NASA Safety Standard and does so with a clear and easy-to-understand interface. The new native Microsoft Windows graphical user interface (GUI) is a vast improvement over the previous DOS-based interface. In the new version, functions are more-clearly laid out, and the GUI includes the standard Windows-style Help functions. The underlying routines within the DAS code are also improved...|$|E

Speaking of Dalmatian medals, one ought to mention two of the great names of the Renaissance, who excelled in the art of the medal: Paolo de Ragusa and Francesco Laurana. Several famous Dalmatians who lived abroad in the 16 th c. were depicted on medals: Jacobus Banisius, Francesco Niconizio and Antonio Veranzio. One of the earliest Dalmatian medals is the one made in 1600 for the Procuratori dell 2 ̆ 7 Area di S. Simeone in Zadar. There is also a medal struck {{on the occasion of the}} liberation of Castelnuovo (Hercegnovi) in 1687. The Scuola Dalmata in Venice also hat its own small silver medals depicting S. George and S. Tripone. The numerous Dalmatian magistrates 2 ̆ 7 medals from the 17 th and 18 th c. are usually of little artistic value, having been made by local gold or silversmiths, according to the wishes of the local nobility, who wanted to honour a departing provveditore generale or conte (various provveditori generali of Dalmatia and Albania, podesta of Poreč, counts of Korčula, Split, Šibenik and Zadar, provveditori of Imotski, Makarska and Sinj). Speaking about medals of the ancient Republic of Dubrovnik one ought to mention that only trace left there by Paolo de Ragusio are the delicate copper follari. Matteo de 2 ̆ 7 Pasti made a medal of Timoteo Maffei, the archbishop of Ragusa. Three 16 th c. Ragusan patricians: Giovanni Nale-Nalješković, Domenico Ragnina and Luca Cerva-Crijević were depicted on medals. A medal by St. Urbain was dedicated to Giorgio Baglivi, a Ragusan surgeon. The first medal was struck in Dubrovnik on the occasion of the reconstruction of St. Blaise 2 ̆ 7 s church in 1707. In 1771 the relics of St. Stephen King of Hungary were presented by the Ragusan Senate to Emperor Joseph Il. and Empress Maria Theresia; the event was marked by a medal. The other two remarkable medals of Dubrovnik were the one to commemorate the death of the rector <b>Orsat</b> Gozze Gučetić, 1798; Gioacchino Hamerani 2 ̆ 7 s 1803 Luigi Alvise Mozzi medal. Napoleon Bonaparte 2 ̆ 7 s Marshal Marmont dissolved the government of the reverend and feeble Republic of Ragusa on January 31. 1808. Napoleon 2 ̆ 7 s massive numismatic propaganda was very well organized. An entire team of artists worked for Napoleon in Paris, but there were also many medallists elsewhere producing medals, in order to celebrate his victories, thus for instance the 1806 medal commemorating the conquests of Dalmatia, of Istria, and of Illyricum. Several of the Dalmatian Napoleonic medals have not been attributed to any of the known medallists, thus for instance the rare Zaratine Lycaeum medal from 1809. A more rudely made medal was presented by the inhabitants of Sinj to Pierre Bouillerot, a French surgeon, in 1811. During the first Austrian rule, in 1801 a decoration by I. N. Wirt was distributed, with the bust of Emperor Franc is II. on the obverse and the inscription DALMATAE BEN EMERENTI/ 1801 on the reverse. One of the earliest Austrian medals struck for Dalmatia was the Zara tine medal of 1804 by Luigi Ferrari, which commemorated the Dalmatian nobility paying respect to Emperor Franc is II. (1792 - 1806 - 1 835), represented by Count Peter von Goess, Governor of Dalmatia between 1802 and 1805. One should not forget the most popular of all medals: the saints 2 ̆ 7 medals and tokens, which were struck, cast or engraved in very large quantities and were cheap and therefore accessible to the masses of pilgrims. The most popular were those of Madonna of Trsat, made chiefly after 1715, when the Madonna was solemnly crowned...|$|E
