40|$|BACKGROUND: Many {{of these}} therapies have been {{compared}} against placebos, {{but have not}} been directly compared against each other. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of several commonly used drugs for AIS directly or indirectly. METHODS: A systematic literature review was performed to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published prior to April 2013 for AIS therapies. The primary outcome measures were the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores and the clinical effective rate. A fixed-effects meta-analysis and meta-regression are performed; lastly, performed a mixed treatment comparison was performed through the Bayesian methods. RESULTS: Outcome of efficacy of therapies for acute ischemic stroke are as followed: All of the therapies mentioned above yielded results a more effective result than placebo, Sodium <b>ozagrel</b> (RR 3. 86, 95 %CI 3. 18 - 4. 61); Sodium <b>ozagrel</b> + edaravone (RR 9. 60, 95 %CI 7. 04 - 13. 06); Edaravone (RR 4. 07, 95 %CI 3. 30 - 5. 01); Edaravone + Kininogenase (RR 15. 33, 95 %CI 10. 03 - 23. 05). The significant difference in efficacy between edaravone monotherapy and Sodium <b>ozagrel</b> + edaravone was evident (RR 0. 43, 95 %CI 0. 08 - 0. 61) and was also significant between efficacy of edaravone + Kininogenase and Sodium <b>ozagrel</b> (RR 4. 00, 95 %CI 2. 47 - 6. 24). The differences between the risk and benefit were not significant when comparing Sodium <b>ozagrel</b> and edaravone or edaravone + Kininogenase and Sodium <b>ozagrel</b> + Edaravone for AIS. Outcome of the defect of neurological function: Placebo served {{a significant difference in}} treating the defects of neurological function compared with Sodium <b>ozagrel</b> (WMD = - 3. 11, 95 %CI - 4. 43 to - 1. 79), Sodium <b>ozagrel</b> + edaravone (WMD = - 6. 25, 95 %CI - 7. 96 to - 4. 54) and Edaravone + Kininogenase (WMD =  - 3. 47, 95 %CI - 5. 73 to - 1. 21).

We {{examined the}} effects of <b>ozagrel,</b> a selective thromboxane A 2 (TXA 2) synthase inhibitor, on liver injury induced by APAP overdose in mice. Methods Hepatotoxicity was induced to ICR male mice by an intraperitoneal injection with APAP (330 mg/kg). The effects of <b>ozagrel</b> (200 mg/kg) treatment 30 min after the APAP injection were evaluated with mortality, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and hepatic changes, including histopathology, DNA fragmentation, mRNA expression and total glutathione contents. The impact of <b>ozagrel</b> (0. 001 - 1 mg/mL) on cytochrome P 450 2 E 1 (CYP 2 E 1) activity in mouse hepatic microsome was examined. RLC- 16 cells, a rat hepatocytes cell line, were exposed to 0. 25 mM N-acetyl -p- benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), a hepatotoxic metabolite of APAP. In this model, the cytoprotective effects of <b>ozagrel</b> (1 – 100 muM) were evaluated by the WST- 1 cell viability assay. Results Ozagel treatment significantly attenuated higher mortality, elevated serum alanine aminotransferase levels, excessive hepatic centrilobular necrosis, hemorrhaging and DNA fragmentation, as well as increase in plasma 2, 3 -dinor thromboxane B 2 levels induced by APAP injection. <b>Ozagrel</b> also inhibited the hepatic expression of cell death-related mRNAs induced by APAP, such as jun oncogene, FBJ osteosarcoma oncogene (fos) and C/EBP homologous protein (chop), but did not suppress B-cell lymphoma 2 -like protein 11 (bim) expression and hepatic total glutathione depletion. These results show <b>ozagrel</b> can inhibit not all hepatic changes but can reduce the hepatic necrosis. <b>Ozagrel</b> had little impact on CYP 2 E 1 activity involving the NAPQI production. In addition, <b>ozagrel</b> significantly attenuated cell injury induced by NAPQI in RLC- 16. Conclusions We demonstrate that the TXA 2 synthase inhibitor, <b>ozagrel,</b> dramatically alleviates liver injury induced by APAP in mice, and suggest that it is a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of APAP-induced liver injury. </p...|$|E

Rats were treated with a single dose of minocycline or <b>ozagrel</b> at 30 min before stroke. A middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was made at 30 min after drug administration and reperftision was done. The rats were subjected to a neurobehavioral test at days 1, 3 and 7 after MCAO. The cerebral ischemic volume was quantified by MetaMorph imaging software after TTC staining. The neuronal cell survival and astrocytes expansion were assessed by the NeuN and GFAP immunohistofluorescence staining. Apoptosis was detected by the TUNEL assay. We statistically analyzed and compared the results with each other. Mino and SO groups had neuroprotective effect and showed a better behavioral performance of adhesive removal and treadmill test at 7 days after stroke. Mino and SO groups also showed a smaller infarct volume than control group at 7 days after stroke. Immunohistofluorescence staining showed a higher number of NeuN positive cells, lower activated astrocytes in GFAP and a lower apoptosis in TUNEL staining. This study showed that single doses of minocycline and <b>ozagrel</b> prior to stroke had neuroprotective effects. These agents will be useful not only in post-stroke therapy but also in stroke prevention in several cerebrovascular procedures like carotid endarterectomy, bypass procedure, endovascular angioplasty, thromboembolectomy or thrombolysis.

Out of 120 study patients, forty each were randomized into placebo, montelukast, and <b>ozagrel</b> groups. After the first dose of the drug or placebo was administered, {{peak expiratory flow rate}} (PEFR), number of rescue medications and also vital signs were noted at 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, 48 h, and at discharge. In addition, same recordings were done on the morning (8 a. m. – 10 a. m.) following admission.

40|$|Background Antiplatelet {{aggregation}} {{treatment has}} become a regular treatment of ischemic stroke. The affirmation of antiplatelet therapy is mainly derived from patients with clinical use, which can not provide the laboratory indexes for evaluation of a recognized accuracy. Studies have confirmed {{that the degree of}} platelet activation is associated with atherosclerosis and ischemic stroke, and recognized that both CD 62 p (α-platelet granule membrane glycoprotein) and CD 63 (lysosomal membrane glycoprotein) were important indexes of platelet activation. This study aims to explore the differences of efficacy between combined use of clopidogrel and <b>ozagrel</b> sodium and monotherapy by aspirin in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke by investigating the expression of CD 62 p and CD 63. Methods Flow cytometry was employed to detect CD 62 p and CD 63 expression on circulating platelet in patients with ischemic stroke and normal control group. The positive rate of CD 62 p and CD 63 was detected in patients with ischemic stroke who were treated with aspirin 0. 15 g (single drug therapy) and clopidogrel 75 mg + <b>ozagrel</b> sodium 80 mg (combination therapy) before and after one and two weeks' treatment. National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores were measured in patients with ischemic stroke {{at the same time in}} three periods respectively to evaluate the improvement of neural function. Results Platelet CD 62 p and CD 63 positive expression rate in ischemic stroke group were higher than normal control group before treatment (P = 0. 001, 0. 032). CD 62 p and CD 63 positive expression rate and NIHSS score were measured at different times, and the differences were statistically significant (F = 56. 693, P = 0. 000; F = 21. 544, P = 0. 000; F = 216. 271, P = 0. 000, respectively). Compared with before treatment, CD 62 p and CD 63 positive expression rate and NIHSS score decreased significantly after treatment (P = 0. 000, for all), but the differences between aspirin group and combination group were not statistically significant (P > 0. 05, for all). There was no interaction between the treatment groups and measuring time with CD 62 p and CD 63 positive expression rate (F = 1. 403, P = 0. 250; F = 2. 830, P = 0. 063), while there was interaction between treatment groups and measuring time with NIHSS score (F = 4. 518, P = 0. 013). Conclusion Antiplatelet drug treatment of acute ischemic stroke is effective. The curative effect of combined treatment (clopidogrel and <b>ozagrel</b> sodium) is not superior to aspirin alone.

Lymphocyte blastogenesis and interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) production from peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated by PHA and Candida antigen in intractable asthmatics was significantly suppressed dose-dependently by OKY- 046. The neutrophil chemotactic factor (NCF) and eosinophil chemotactic factor (ECF) from peripheral blood nomonuclear cells stimulated by Candida antigen in intractable asthmatics tended to be suppressed by OKY- 046.

40|$|ABSTRACTTo {{elucidate}} {{the mechanisms of}} cationic protein-induced airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), the airway response to methacholine, and the concentrations of thromboxane B 2 (TXB 2) and 6 -keto-PGF 1 α in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of guinea-pigs were measured after inhalation of poly-L-lysine (P-L-L). The airway responsiveness (AR) was evaluated by specific airway resistance. The inhalation of P-L-L significantly enhanced AR to methacholine, and increased TXB 2 and 6 -keto-PGF 1 α in the BALF. The enhanced AR and the increase of TXB 2 and 6 -keto-PGF 1 α were both significantly inhibited by pretreatment with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH; anionic protein; 10 mg/mL for 6 min inhalation). Furthermore, thromboxane (TX) synthase inhibitor (<b>ozagrel),</b> thromboxane A 2 (TXA 2) receptor antagonist (ONO- 3708), and bradykinin B 2 receptor antagonist (BBRA; Nα-adamantaneacetyl-D-Arg [Hyp 3, Thi 5, 8, D-Phe 7]-bradykinin) inhibited the cation-induced AHR.

CONCLUSION: In skeletal muscle venules, increases in intraluminal flow elicit production of constrictor TxA(2), in addition to the dilator NO and PGI(2) /PGE(2), with an overall effect of limited dilation. These mediators are likely to have important roles in the multiple feedback regulation of wall shear stress in venules during changes in blood flow velocity and/or viscosity...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{evidence}} and present consensus {{as well as}} the future direction of thrombolytic and antithrombotic therapies for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke were reviewed. Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA; alteplase) has recently been approved in Japan to use in patients with ischemic stroke within 3 hours of onset. In order to improve the efficacy and maximize the safety, attempts have recently been made to select patients on the basis of perfusion/diffusion mismatch on magnetic resonance imaging, use of third generation t-PAs, and concomitant use of transcranial Doppler or clot retrieval device. Neither unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight heparin, or heparinoid has been proven to improve long-term outcome, while anticoagulant therapy appears to be indicated for the treatment of patients with atherothrombotic stroke, progressing stroke, basilar artery thrombosis, cardioembolic stroke at high risk of early recurrence, coagulopathy including antiphospholipid antibody and Trousseau 2 ̆ 7 s syndrome, and intracranial arterial dissection. The thrombin inhibitor argatroban is recommended for the treatment of atherothrombotic stroke within 48 hours of onset. Among antiplatelet agents, aspirin is recommended in patients with ischemic stroke within 48 hours of onset, although the long-term efficacy is modest. The thromboxane synthetase inhibitor <b>ozagrel</b> is also recommended in the Japanese guideline. A trial of the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor abciximab has been discontinued because of safety concerns. Many clinical trials of dual antiplatelet therapy are ongoing in patients with acute ischemic stroke...|$|E

Sodium <b>ozagrel</b> (SO) prevents platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction in the cerebral ischemia. It {{plays an important role}} in the prevention of brain damage induced by cerebral ischemia/reperfusion. Recently, many animal studies have suggested that the Panax ginseng (PG) has neuroprotective effects in the ischemic brain. In this study, we assessed the neuroprotective effects that come from a combination therapy of SO and PG in rat models with middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Animals with MCAO were assigned randomly to one of the following four groups: (1) control (Con) group, (2) SO group (3 mg/kg, intravenously), (3) PG group (200 mg/kg, oral feeding), and (4) SO + PG group. The rats were subjected to a neurobehavior test including adhesive removal test and rotarod test at 1, 3, 7, 10, and 15 days after MCAO. The cerebral ischemic volume was quantified by Metamorph imaging software after 2 - 3 - 5 -triphenyltetrazolium (TTC) staining. The neuronal cell survival and astrocytes expansion were assessed by immunohistofluorescence staining. In the adhesive removal test, the rats of PG or SO + PG group showed significantly better performance than those of the control group (Con: 88. 1 ± 24. 8, PG: 43. 6 ± 11, SO + PG...|$|E
40|$|Background/Aims: ICCs are the {{pacemaker}} cells {{responsible for}} slow waves in gastrointestinal (GI) smooth muscle, and generate periodic pacemaker potentials in current-clamp mode. Methods: The effects of menthol on the pacemaker potentials of cultured interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs) from mouse small intestine were studied using the whole cell patch clamp technique. Results: Menthol (1 - 10 μM) {{was found to}} induce membrane potential depolarization in a concentration-dependent manner. The effects of various TRP channel antagonists were examined to investigate the receptors involved. The addition of the TRPM 8 antagonist, AMTB, did not block menthol-induced membrane potential depolarizations, but TRPA 1 antagonists (A 967079 or HC- 030031) blocked the effects of menthol, as did intracellular GDPβS. Furthermore, external and internal Ca 2 + levels were found to depolarize menthol-induced membrane potentials, whereas external Na+ was not. Y- 27632 (a Rho kinase inhibitor), SC- 560 (a selective COX 1 inhibitor), NS- 398 (a selective COX 2 inhibitor), <b>ozagrel</b> (a thromboxane A 2 synthase inhibitor) and SQ- 29548 (highly selective thromboxane receptor antagonist) were used to investigate the involvements of Rho-kinase, cyclooxygenase (COX), and the thromboxane pathway in menthol-induced membrane potential depolarizations, and all inhibitors were found to block the effect of menthol. Conclusions: These results suggest that menthol-induced membrane potential depolarizations occur in a G-protein-, Ca 2 +-, Rho-kinase-, COX-, and thromboxane A 2 -dependent manner via TRPA 1 receptor in cultured ICCs in murine small intestine. The study shows ICCs are targeted by menthol and that this interaction can affect intestinal motility...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{effect of}} {{antiplatelet}} agents {{for the treatment}} of acute stroke is less certain than that {{for the treatment of}} acute myocardial ischemia. In this study, we investigated whether antiplatelet agents (aspirin, clopidogrel, and <b>ozagrel)</b> demonstrated a favorable effect on functional outcome and cognitive status 3 months poststroke. Methods: We randomly selected 24 hospitals from five different regions in China. Patients without recurrent stroke were recruited and neurological and neuropsychological examinations were performed on these patients at 3 months poststroke. Each patient was diagnosed as having favorable or poor functional outcome and normal cognition or cognitive impairment. Multivariate logistic regression analyses adjusted for sex, age, education, and neurological deficit at stroke onset were performed to examine whether antiplatelet agents exhibited a favorable effect on functional outcome and cognitive status at 3 months poststroke. Results: Of the 518 eligible patients (aged 45 – 86 years, mean 63. 01  ±  9. 99 years), 167 (32. 2 %) were female. On the basis of univariate analysis, there were significant associations between functional outcome (p =  0. 048) and cognitive status (p =  0. 026) at 3 months poststroke and the use of antiplatelet agents in acute ischemic stroke. The adjusted odds ratio for favorable functional outcome was 1. 81 (95 % confidence interval: 1. 09 – 2. 99) and for normal cognition 1. 67 (95 % confidence interval: 1. 02 – 2. 74). Conclusion: The use of antiplatelet agents in acute ischemic stroke may have a favorable effect on functional outcome and cognitive status in patients at 3 months poststroke...|$|E
40|$|Angiotensin II induces endothelial {{dysfunction}} {{by reducing}} NO availability and increasing reactive oxygen species. We assessed whether cyclooxygenase (COX) - 1 or COX- 2 {{participate in the}} angiotensin II-induced endothelial dysfunction in murine mesenteric small arteries and examined the role of reduced nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate-dependent reactive oxygen species production. Mice received angiotensin II (600 ng/kg per minute, SC), saline (controls), angiotensin II + apocynin (reduced nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase inhibitor, 2. 5 mg/day), or apocynin alone for 2 weeks. Endothelial function of mesenteric arteries was assessed by pressurized myograph. In controls, acetylcholine-induced relaxation was inhibited by NG-monomethyl-L-arginine and unaffected by DFU (COX- 2 inhibitor), SC- 560 (COX- 1 inhibitor), or ascorbic acid. In angiotensin II-infused animals, the attenuated response to acetylcholine was less sensitive to NG-monomethyl-L-arginine, unaffected by DFU, and enhanced by SC- 560 and, similarly, by SQ- 29548, a thromboxane-prostanoid receptor antagonist. Moreover, response to acetylcholine was unchanged by <b>ozagrel,</b> a thromboxane synthase inhibitor, and normalized by ascorbic acid. Apocynin prevented the angiotensin II-induced vascular dysfunctions. In angiotensin II-infused mice, RT-PCR analysis showed a significant COX- 2 downregulation, whereas COX- 1 expression was upregulated. These changes were unaffected by apocynin. Modulation of COX isoform by angiotensin II was also documented by immunohistochemistry. In small mesenteric vessels, the reduced NO availability and oxidant excess, which characterize endothelial dysfunction secondary to angiotensin II, {{are associated with a}} reduced COX- 2 and an increased COX- 1 function and expression. Angiotensin II causes an oxidative stress-independent COX- 1 overexpression, whereas angiotensin II-mediated oxidant excess production stimulates COX- 1 activity to produce a contracting prostanoid endowed with agonist activity on thromboxane-prostanoid receptors...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{examined}} whether substance P (SP) and SP methyl ester (SPME), a selective NK 1 agonist, cause biphasic responses consisting of endothelium-dependent relaxation (EDR) and contraction (EDC) in precontracted rabbit intrapulmonary arteries. In arteries contracted with PGF 2 α (2 × 10 − 6 [*]M), SP {{as well as}} SPME caused only EDR at low concentration (10 − 9 [*]M) and EDR followed by EDC at higher concentrations, indicating the involvement of NK 1 receptors. The SP (10 − 8 [*]M) -induced EDR was abolished in arteries moderately contracted by PGF 2 α (5 × 10 − 7 [*]M) and the EDC in arteries maximally contracted by PGF 2 α (10 − 5 [*]M), indicating that EDR and EDC are inversely dependent on preexisting tone. Indomethacin (10 − 8 – 10 − 6 [*]M), a cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, and <b>ozagrel</b> (10 − 8 – 10 − 6 [*]M), a TXA 2 synthetase inhibitor attenuated the EDC in the SPME (10 − 7 [*]M) -induced biphasic response and markedly potentiated the EDR. AA- 861 (10 − 8 – 10 − 6 [*]M), a 5 -lipoxygenase inhibitor, {{did not affect the}} EDR or EDC. L-NG-nitro-arginine methyl ester (10 − 5 – 10 − 4 [*]M), a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, attenuated the EDR and slightly potentiated the EDC. CP- 99994 (10 − 10 – 10 − 8 [*]M), an NK 1 antagonist, attenuated the EDC and potentiated the EDR in the SPME (10 − 7 [*]M) -induced biphasic response, while the NK 2 antagonist SR- 48968 (10 − 9 – 10 − 7 [*]M) had no effect. CP- 99994 attenuated the SPME (10 − 7 [*]M) -induced EDC under EDR-blockade {{to a greater extent than}} the EDR under EDC-blockade, indicating that CP- 99994 enhanced the EDR component by preferential inhibition of the EDC component. In conclusion, NK 1 agonists caused a biphasic endothelium-dependent response (EDR and EDC) in submaximally precontracted intrapulmonary arteries. The EDC and EDR mediated by NK 1 receptors may play physiological and/or pathophysiological roles in modulation of vascular tone...|$|E

The neuronal cell survival and astrocytes expansion were assessed by immunohistofluorescence staining. In the adhesive removal test, the rats of PG or SO + PG group showed significantly better performance than those of the control group (Con: 88. 1 ± 24. 8, PG: 43. 6 ± 11, SO + PG: 11. 8 ± 7, P <. 05). Notably, the combination therapy group (SO + PG) showed better performance than the SO group alone (SO: 56 ± 12, SO + PG: 11. 8 ± 7, P <. 05). In TTC staining for infarct volume, cerebral ischemic areas were also significantly reduced in the PG group and SO + PG group (Con: 219 ± 32, PG: 117 ± 8, SO + PG: 99 ± 11, P <. 05). Immunohistofluorescence staining results showed that the group which received SO + PG group therapy had neuron cells in the normal range. They also had a low number of astrocytes and apoptotic cells compared with the control or SO group in the peri-infarction area. During astrocytes staining, compared to the SO + PG group, the PG group showed only minor differences in the number of NeuN-positive cells and quantitative analysis of infarct volume. In conclusion, these studies showed that in MCAO rat models, the combination therapy with SO and PG may provide better neuroprotective effects such as higher neuronal cell survival and inhibition of astrocytes expansion than monotherapy with SO alone...|$|E
