25|$|This {{technique}} {{is much more}} efficient than the naïve brute-force search algorithm, which considers all 648=248= 281,474,976,710,656 possible blind placements of eight queens, and then filters these to remove all placements that place two queens either on the same square (leaving only 64!/56!= 178,462,987,637,760 possible placements) or in mutually attacking positions. This very poor algorithm will, among other things, produce the same results over and <b>over</b> <b>again</b> <b>in</b> all the different permutations of the assignments of the eight queens, as well as repeating the same computations {{over and over again}} for the different sub-sets of each solution. A better brute-force algorithm places a single queen on each row, leading to only 88=224= 16,777,216 blind placements.|$|E
25|$|If a nazirite fails in {{fulfilling}} {{these three}} obligations {{there may be}} consequences. All {{or part of the}} person's time as a nazirite may need to be repeated. Furthermore, the person may be obligated to bring sacrifices. Whether a nazirite has to repeat time as a nazirite depends on what part of the nazirite vow was transgressed. A nazirite who becomes defiled by a corpse is obligated to start the entire nazirite period <b>over</b> <b>again.</b> <b>In</b> the Mishna, Queen Helena vowed to be a nazirite for seven years, but became defiled near the end of each of two of her first nazirite periods, forcing her to twice start over. She was a nazirite for a total of 21 years. Nazirites who shave their hair are obligated to redo the last 30 days of the nazirite period. However, if the nazirite drinks wine, the nazirite period continues as normal.|$|E

25|$|The word waswās in waswāsi l-ḫannās {{means the}} one who whispers over and over again, and waswasa means to whisper into someone's heart an evil {{suggestion}} over and <b>over</b> <b>again</b> <b>in</b> such a way or ways that {{the one who}} is being inspired may not feel that the whisperer is whispering an evil suggestion into his heart. Waswasa by itself suggests repetition just as zalzala contains the meaning of repetitive movement. Since man is not tempted by just one attempt but effort has to be made over and over again to seduce and tempt him, such an attempt is called waswasa and the tempter waswās. As for the word ḫannās, it is derived from ḫunus, which means to hide after appearing and to retreat after coming into view. Since ḫannās is the intensive form, it would imply the one who behaves thus very frequently. Thus when once he fails in his attempt to whisper evil, he withdraws, then he again returns to make the second and the third and the next attempt over and over again.|$|E
25|$|Authorized by the Pacific Railway Act of 1862 {{and heavily}} {{backed by the}} federal government, the first transcontinental {{railroad}} {{was the culmination of}} a decades-long movement to build such a line {{and was one of the}} crowning achievements of the presidency of Abraham Lincoln, completed four years after his death. The building of the railroad required enormous feats of engineering and labor in the crossing of plains and high mountains by the Union Pacific Railroad (UP) and Central Pacific Railroad, the two federally chartered enterprises that built the line westward and eastward respectively. The building of the railroad was motivated in part to bind the Union together during the strife of the American Civil War. It substantially accelerated the populating of the West by white homesteaders, led to rapid cultivation of new farm lands. The Central Pacific and the Southern Pacific Railroad combined operations in 1870 and formally merged in 1885; the Union Pacific originally bought the Southern Pacific in 1901 and was forced to divest it in 1913, but took it <b>over</b> <b>again</b> <b>in</b> 1996.|$|E
25|$|Once {{they left}} home these armies and fleets {{had to be}} supplied, not only with food and {{clothing}} for the men but also forage for the horses which gave them mobility and were fitting to their Station. Yet if armies of the seventh and eighth centuries were accompanied by servants and a supply train of lesser free men, Alfred found these arrangements insufficient to defeat the Vikings. One of his reforms, if {{he was responsible for}} them, was to divide his military resources into three. One part manned the burhs and found the permanent garrisons which would make it impossible for the Danes to overrun Wessex, although they would also take to the field when extra soldiers were needed. The remaining two would take it in turns to serve. They were allocated a fixed term of Service and brought the necessary provisions with them. This arrangement did not always function perfectly. On one occasion a division on Service went home in the middle of blockading a Danish army on Thorney Island, its provisions consumed and its term expired, before the king came to relieve them. This method of division and rotation remained in force right up to 1066. In 917, when armies from Wessex and Mercia were in the field from early April until November, one division went home and another took <b>over.</b> <b>Again,</b> <b>in</b> 1052 when Edward's fleet was waiting at Sandwich to intercept Godwine's return, the ships returned to London to take on new earls and crews. The importance of supply, vital to military success, was appreciated even if it was taken for granted and features only incidentally in the sources.|$|E

Adrian Hanauer, then-owner of the United Soccer League's (USL) Sounders (formerly the APSL Sounders), was in discussions with MLS about an estimated payment of $1million to secure rights to a Seattle franchise for 2006.

500|$|As Voltaire himself {{described}} it, {{the purpose}} of Candide was to [...] "bring amusement to {{a small number of}} men of wit". The author achieves this goal by combining his sharp wit with a fun parody of the classic adventure-romance plot. Candide is confronted with horrible events described in painstaking detail so often that it becomes humorous. Literary theorist Frances K. Barasch described Voltaire's matter-of-fact narrative as treating topics such as mass death [...] "as coolly as a weather report". The fast-paced and improbable plot—in which characters narrowly escape death repeatedly, for instance—allows for compounding tragedies to befall the same characters over and <b>over</b> <b>again.</b> <b>In</b> the end, Candide is primarily, as described by Voltaire's biographer Ian Davidson, [...] "short, light, rapid and humorous".|$|E

500|$|Following {{the death}} of Pyott, {{ownership}} of the navigation was bought by James D'Arcy, by then married to the widow of one of Pyott's sons. There were still mortgages of £4,666 outstanding, all of them owned by members of Pyott's family, on which interest had to be paid. He appears to have leased the tolls to the proprietors, according to a local newspaper report of the time, and then to Edward Knapp, before taking <b>over</b> <b>again</b> <b>in</b> 1794. Around 1802, the navigation was carrying [...] of freight, of which [...] were coal and culm, [...] were salt, [...] tons were chalk, and the remaining [...] tons were made up of other goods. The average annual income was quoted as £3,735, but this probably included freight charges as well as tolls, since D'Arcy managed both. He operated four barges.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} premiered on October 9, 2009 on CMT. Peter Gicas of E! thought the video was [...] "sweet" [...] and said, [...] "And while the visuals here—Taylor walking {{in and out}} of various {{animated}} scenes—are certainly nice to look at, they nevertheless {{take a back seat to}} the country star's cuteness." [...] Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly graded the video a B.

Jocelyn Vena of MTV wrote, [...] "Taylor Swift is 'Fifteen' all <b>over</b> <b>again</b> <b>in</b> the new music video for her song of the same name."

Shortly afterwards, more than 18 hours too late, the South Vietnamese hit Ap Bac with an artillery barrage. The artillery rounds killed another five South Vietnamese soldiers and wounded 14 others. Vann, who had made key decisions in the early phases of the battle, blamed the South Vietnamese for the debacle. [...] "It was a miserable damn performance, just like it always is. These people won't listen. They {{make the same mistake}} over and <b>over</b> <b>again</b> <b>in</b> the same way". According to Moyar (2008), in blaming the South Vietnamese, Vann wanted to conceal the Americans' flawed intelligence and poor leadership.

500|$|The {{cinematic}} experience {{itself is}} {{the main focus of}} the film, {{but there is also a}} central theme of emptiness. Noé describes the film's subject as [...] "the sentimentality of mammals and the shimmering vacuity of the human experience." [...] The dramaturgy after Oscar has been shot is loosely based on The Tibetan Book of the Dead, and ends with the spirit's search for a way to reincarnate. The director, who opposes all religious beliefs, says that [...] "the whole movie is a dream of someone who read The Tibetan Book of the Dead, and heard about it before being [...] It's not the story of someone who dies, flies and is reincarnated, it's the story of someone who is stoned when he gets shot and who has an intonation of his own dream." [...] Noé describes the ending of the film as Oscar's recollection of [...] "the most traumatic moment of his life – his own birth". The director also leaves open the possibility that Oscar's life starts <b>over</b> <b>again</b> <b>in</b> an endless loop, due to the human brain's perception of time.|$|E
500|$|Ripken {{was drafted}} by the Baltimore Orioles {{in the second round}} of the 1978 Major League Baseball draft 48th overall. Despite a story written by SABR, Ripken was {{selected}} with the Orioles' predetermined draft pick, not through a forfeited pick from the Boston Red Sox after the Sox selected Dick Drago in the 1977 re-entry draft. The Orioles would select catcher Cecil Whitehead with the pick they received from Boston two picks after Ripken. On deciding to go straight from high school to the professional level, he said, [...] "When the colleges started coming around, Dad and I talked about mostly whether I was going to pursue a career in baseball. If I had the ability, the feeling was to get on with it, and if it didn't work out, start <b>over</b> <b>again</b> <b>in</b> college at 25 or 26." [...] Ripken played both pitcher and shortstop in high school; in fact, the Orioles were the only team not just interested in his pitching ability. The Orioles decided to start him playing shortstop in the minor leagues, deciding it would be easier for him to transition back to pitching if necessary than it would be for him to start hitting again.|$|E
500|$|The film {{received}} positive {{reviews in}} trade publications. The Moving Picture World review said. [...] "Probably {{the story of}} Rip Van Winkle as told by Washington Irving {{will always be a}} delight. Surely the Rip Van Winkle, as depicted by the late Joseph Jefferson, will linger long in the memory of those fortunate enough to have seen it. Unquestionably, however, the third in the list of delights is this film from Thanhouser which tells the story <b>over</b> <b>again</b> <b>in</b> {{much the same way that}} Jefferson told it. The Rip of Jefferson and the Rip of Irving are two different versions, though both do substantially the same things. ... It is a good piece of work from every standpoint. The actors have entered into the spirit of the story and have depicted it with close adherence to the facts as they are related in the original. The stage manager understood what was required to make the background appear natural, while the photographer handled the camera with full knowledge of the requirements." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror reviewer also agreed and commended the film by stating, [...] "The Thanhouser Company has done very well with this old legend, paying particular attention to details. ... The acting is exceptionally good for a story representing that era of time, and the adaption is very clear to the spectator." ...|$|E

500|$|Feldman has {{admitted}} in several interviews {{that he has}} been the victim of people who email him to explain psychiatric symptoms, only to divulge eventually that they created it all to fool a doctor. For prolonged cases, he states the impetus for such behavior is the [...] "longing for nurturing, sympathy, care and concern that they feel unable to get in appropriate ways," [...] and that the admiration of forum members is a strong motivator to continue. As manipulation is integral to most cases, the need to control others to feel as if the perpetrator is in control {{of his or her own}} life is apparent, as is the pre-existence of underlying personality disorders. Many people who present factitious disorders crave sympathy and support because it was notably absent in childhood. In a story published in The Village Voice in 2001, a woman recovering from factitious disorder remembered her drive to create conditions that did not exist: [...] "When I'd do something to attract the paramedics and police, I got an adrenaline rush. I believe I got addicted to it. At the time, it didn't occur to me I was hurting anyone but myself." [...] A psychologist who was a member of the support group for premature infants stated in The New York Times article, [...] "People who do this need something. I wonder if it's a metaphor for some other loss she experienced and is playing over and <b>over</b> <b>again</b> <b>in</b> different shapes." ...|$|E
500|$|Benjamin Champney was {{a master}} at {{painting}} water and is known for warm autumn colors. William F.

George McConnell (18521929) was known for the velvety pastel look of his paintings. Edward Hill often created a canopy-like depiction of trees to frame and accentuate {{the focus of a}} painting, a technique that gave many of his works a feeling of intimacy and solitude. [...] Many of the works of Samuel Lancaster Gerry (18131891) included dogs, people on horseback, and women and men in red clothing.

Sylvester Phelps Hodgdon (18301906) painted at the extremes of the day – sunrise and sunset scenes – and often in Franconia Notch.
