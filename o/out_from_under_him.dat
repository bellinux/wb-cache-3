5|$|Almost {{a decade}} of peace ended with the {{outbreak}} of the Seven Years' War in Europe. Crillon resumed active service with the Army of Germany (Reichsarmee) in 1757, when he first served in a separate corps commanded by the Prince of Soubise on the frontiers of Saxony and then joined the French Grand Army. He defended the city of Weißenfels in October 1757, commanding four imperial battalions and 17 companies of French grenadiers. He executed a retreat, but on 5 November he was injured when he had his horse shot <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>him</b> at the Battle of Rossbach.|$|E
5|$|On March 3, 1873, {{the state}} {{legislature}} passed a bill re-enfranchising ex-Confederates, {{to the delight of}} much of the state population and the concern of the Minstrels. The legislature called a special election in November to replace 33 members, mostly Minstrels, who had left for patronage jobs in the Baxter government. Baxter refused to let the Minstrels manipulate the election, declaring that free, honest elections would be held during his term. With the help of the newly re-enfranchised voters, conservative Democrats swept the election and gained a small majority in the legislature. Baxter was about to erode his Republican base <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Ross began a 90-day {{furlough}} on March 13, 1865, he {{had participated in}} 135 engagements with the enemy and his horse had been shot <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>him</b> five times, yet he had escaped serious injury. With his leave approved, Ross hurried home to Texas to visit the wife {{he had not seen}} in two years. While at home, the Confederate Army began its surrender. He had not rejoined his regiment when it surrendered in Jackson, Mississippi, on May 14, 1865. Because he was not present at the surrender, Ross did not receive a parole protecting him from arrest. As a Confederate Army officer over the rank of colonel, Ross was also exempted from President Andrew Johnson's amnesty proclamation of May 29, 1865. To prevent his arrest and the confiscation of his property, on August 4, 1865, Ross applied for a special pardon for his treason against the United States. Johnson personally approved Ross's application on October 22, 1866, but Ross did not receive and formally accept the pardon until July 1867.|$|E
5000|$|A vote {{is taken}} {{on whether the}} men should be hanged or taken back to face justice in the town. Of the group, only five {{are opposed to the}} hanging, Tetley's son Gerald among them. When sunrise approaches, the {{condemned}} men are placed upon their horses with nooses around their necks. Tetley orders three people including his son to tend to the horses. When the command is given, Gerald balks and the horse simply walks <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> Martin, leaving <b>him</b> to slowly strangle until he is shot [...] In anger, Tetley pistol whips his son to the ground.|$|R
60|$|Good it was, they agreed, that Hell's Spawn should break {{trail for}} his master across the last divide, {{and the court}} was adjourned {{down to the river}} bank, where a big spruce tree stood by itself. Slackwater Charley put a hangman's knot in the end of a hauling-line, and the noose was slipped over Leclere's head and pulled tight around his neck. His hands were tied behind his back, and he was {{assisted}} {{to the top of a}} cracker box. Then the running end of the line was passed over an over-hanging branch, drawn taut, and made fast. To kick the box <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> would leave <b>him</b> dancing on the air.|$|R
60|$|The {{three of}} us set to work with all our might, Poulsson making great holes in the ground at every stroke, Polly Ann {{scraping}} at the dirt with the gourd. Two {{feet below the surface}} we struck the edge of the lowest log, and then it was Poulsson who got into the hole with his hunting knife--perspiring, muttering to himself, working as one possessed with a fury, while we scraped <b>out</b> the dirt <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>him.</b> At length, after what seemed an age of staring at his legs, the ground caved on him, and he would have smothered if we had not dragged him out by the heels, sputtering and all powdered brown. But there was the daylight under the log.|$|R
5|$|General Alfred T. Torbert was {{commander}} of the union cavalry. The 2nd West Virginia Cavalry {{was part of the}} 2nd Brigade (commanded by Colonel Powell), which was part of the 2nd Cavalry Division (commanded by General Averell). Powell's brigade was positioned on the northwest side of the battlefield between brigades led by Colonel James Schoonmaker and Colonel George Custer. During the battle, Powell sent the 2nd West Virginia Cavalry to the flank and rear of Confederate cavalry consisting of Virginians led by Colonel William H. F. Payne, which was facing Custer's brigade. Powell also sent the 3rd West Virginia Cavalry toward Payne's left flank. The 2nd West Virginia Cavalry had been newly armed with 7-shot carbines, and found them very effective against an enemy that was driven from the area in panic. During this time, Confederate General Fitzhugh Lee's horse was shot <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>him,</b> but Lee escaped on another horse.|$|E
5|$|He {{successfully}} {{defended his}} championship belt at , defeating former Shooto Middleweight Champion Hayato Sakurai via TKO due to strikes at 3:01 {{of the fourth}} round. In {{the first round of}} the fight, Hughes spent all the time either clinching Sakurai up against the fence, or ripping his feet <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>him.</b> In round 2, Sakurai landed a right hand that sent Hughes to the mat; despite this, Matt won the round by spending three minutes hitting Sakurai with elbows from the top position. At the start of the third round, Hughes quickly slammed Sakurai to the ground, again staying three minutes on top. He looked too strong for Sakurai. Hughes finished the bout in the 4th round, by taking down Sakurai and transitioning to full mount. After one minute of ground-and-pound onslaught, the contest was over as Sakurai had no answer for the champion.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1863, the XII Corps was {{transferred}} to the West to reinforce the Union forces besieged at Chattanooga. At the Battle of Wauhatchie, during a surprise night attack by the Confederate forces, Greene was wounded in the face, with his jaw crushed and some teeth carried away. Subsequent surgery was not able to correct his condition and he suffered from the effects of his wound {{for the rest of his}} life. After six weeks of medical leave, he was assigned to light court-martial duty until January 1865, when he was sent to join Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman's army in North Carolina. Initially Greene voluntarily served on the staff of Maj. Gen. Jacob D. Cox participating in the battle at Kinston, where he had his horse shot <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>him.</b> At the very end of the war Greene was in command of the 3rd Brigade in Absalom Baird's 3rd Division, XIV Corps, and participated in the capture of Raleigh and the pursuit of Gen. Joseph E. Johnston's army until its surrender.|$|E
25|$|The Federals broke {{southwest}} {{past the}} Skinner house and Mount Zion Church. For his part, Forbes attempted to rally his men, {{getting them to}} reform {{a line in the}} woods southwest of the pike. In the woods the two forces collided in fierce close range fighting. The Federals drew their sabers but found them ineffective against the Rangers pistol fire. In the close quarter fighting, Forbes encountered Mosby and attempted to stab him with his saber. Ranger Thomas Richards jumped in front of the blade, taking it in the shoulder and saving his commander. Mosby emptied his pistol, shooting <b>out</b> Forbes' horse <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>him</b> throwing him to the ground. Forbes quickly surrendered and the Federal resistance finally gave way. The Federals broke pell-mell into retreat with the Rangers in pursuit for several miles.|$|R

5|$|Prior to the campaigning {{season of}} 1864, Cleburne became engaged to Susan Tarleton of Mobile, Alabama. Their {{marriage}} {{was never to}} be, as Cleburne was killed during an ill-conceived assault (which he opposed) on Union fortifications at the Battle of Franklin, just south of Nashville, Tennessee, on November 30, 1864. He was last seen advancing on foot toward the Union line with his sword raised, after his horse was shot <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>him.</b> Accounts later {{said that he was}} found just inside the Federal line and his body carried back to an aid station along the Columbia Turnpike. Confederate war records indicate he died of a shot to the abdomen, or possibly a bullet that went through his heart. When Confederates found his body, he had been picked clean of any valuable items, including his sword, boots and pocket watch.|$|E
5|$|McKinley and his {{regiment}} {{moved to}} the Shenandoah Valley as the armies broke from winter quarters to resume hostilities. Crook's corps was attached to Major General David Hunter's Army of the Shenandoah and soon back in contact with Confederate forces, capturing Lexington, Virginia, on June 11. They continued south toward Lynchburg, tearing up railroad track as they advanced. Hunter believed the troops at Lynchburg were too powerful, however, and the brigade returned to West Virginia. Before the army could make another attempt, Confederate General Jubal Early's raid into Maryland forced their recall to the north. Early's army surprised them at Kernstown on July 24, where McKinley {{came under heavy fire}} and the army was defeated. Retreating into Maryland, the army was reorganized again: Major General Philip Sheridan replaced Hunter, and McKinley, who had been promoted to captain after the battle, was transferred to General Crook's staff. By August, Early was retreating south in the valley, with Sheridan's army in pursuit. They fended off a Confederate assault at Berryville, where McKinley had a horse shot <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>him,</b> and advanced to Opequon Creek, where they broke the enemy lines and pursued them farther south. They followed up the victory with another at Fisher's Hill on September 22, and were engaged once more at Cedar Creek on October 19. After initially falling back from the Confederate advance, McKinley helped to rally the troops and turn the tide of the battle.|$|E
5|$|The Confederate assault, {{despite its}} shortcomings, was ferocious, causing {{some of the}} {{numerous}} inexperienced Union soldiers in Grant's new army to flee to the river for safety. Others fought well, but were forced to withdraw under strong pressure from the Confederates, and attempted to form new defensive lines. Many Union regiments fragmented entirely; the companies and sections that remained on the field attached themselves to other commands. Sherman, who had been negligent in preparing for an attack, became {{one of its most}} important elements. He appeared everywhere along his lines, inspiring his raw recruits to resist the initial assaults, despite the staggering losses on both sides. Sherman received two minor wounds and had three horses shot <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>him.</b> Historian James M. McPherson cites the battle as the turning point of Sherman's life, helping him {{to become one of the}} North's premier generals. Sherman's division bore the brunt of the initial attack. Despite heavy fire on their position and their left flank crumbling, Sherman's men fought stubbornly, but the Union troops slowly lost ground and fell back to a position behind Shiloh Church. McClernand's division temporarily stabilized the position. Overall, however, Johnston's forces made steady progress until noon, rolling up Union positions one by one. As the Confederates advanced, many threw away their flintlock muskets and grabbed rifles dropped by the fleeing Union troops.|$|E

5|$|On September 16, {{while on}} patrol west of Philadelphia, Pulaski spotted {{significant}} British forces {{moving toward the}} Continental position. Upon being informed by Pulaski, Washington prepared for a battle, but the encounter {{was interrupted by a}} major storm before either side was organized. On October 4, Pulaski took part in the Battle of Germantown. He spent the winter of 1777 to 1778 with most of the army at Valley Forge. Pulaski argued that the military operations should continue through the winter, but this idea was rejected by the general staff. In turn, he focused on reorganizing the cavalry force, mostly stationed in Trenton. While at Trenton his assistance was requested by General Anthony Wayne, whom Washington had dispatched on a foraging expedition into southern New Jersey. Wayne was in danger of encountering a much larger British force sent to oppose his movements. Pulaski and 50 cavalry rode south to Burlington, where they skirmished with British sentries on February 28. After this minor encounter the British commander, Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Stirling, was apparently convinced that he was facing a much larger force than expected, and prepared to withdraw his troops across the Delaware River into Pennsylvania at Cooper's Ferry (present-day Gloucester City). Pulaski and Wayne joined forces to attack Stirling's position on February 29 while he awaited suitable weather conditions to cross. In the resulting skirmish (which only involved a few hundred men out of the larger forces on either side), Pulaski's horse was shot <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>him</b> and a few of his cavalry were wounded.|$|E
25|$|In October of {{that year}} he fought at the Battle of Perryville. Later in 1862 he fought at the Battle of Murfreesboro where he was wounded. Kelly {{commanded}} a large brigade of men at Chickamauga consisting of the 5th Kentucky, 58th North Carolina, 63rd Virginia, and the 65th Georgia Infantry Regiments. He lost 300 men at Chickamauga within the one hour. Also during the battle while leading his troops Kelly had a horse shot <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
25|$|As {{commanding}} officer of the third-rate HMS Excellent, West served {{off the coast of}} Catalonia and landed with a naval brigade with orders to help defend Rosas which was under attack from some 5,000 French troops in an action during the Napoleonic Wars.

25|$|Warren {{was correct}} to be {{concerned}} about his right flank. As the Union men advanced, Brig. Gen. Romeyn B. Ayres's brigade had to take cover in a gully to avoid the enfilading fire. The brigade of Brig. Gen. Joseph J. Bartlett made better progress to Ayres's left and overran the position of Brig. Gen. John M. Jones, who was killed. However, since Ayres's men were unable to advance, Bartlett's right flank was now exposed to attack and his brigade was forced to flee back across the clearing. Bartlett's horse was shot <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>him</b> and he barely escaped capture.|$|E
25|$|Promoted to {{commander}} on 7 September 1795, West became {{commanding officer}} of the sloop HMS Diligence on the West Indies Station in December 1795. He was promoted to captain on 15 November 1796 {{and went on to}} be {{commanding officer of}} the sixth-rate HMS Tourterelle also on the West Indies Station. He became commanding officer of the third-rate HMS Utrecht at Chatham in March 1801 and commanding officer of the third-rate HMS Excellent in January 1807. In HMS Excellent he served off the coast of Catalonia and landed with a naval brigade with orders to help defend Rosas which was under attack from some 5,000 French troops in an action in November 1808 during the Napoleonic Wars. He took 250 of his ship's men and rescued a group migueletes (Catalan mercenaries) who were are risk of losing their lives, but not before having his own horse shot <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
25|$|Ross {{was present}} at the Siege of Ciudad Rodrigo in January 1812, the Siege of Badajoz in April 1812 and at the Battle of Salamanca in July 1812. After the Battle of Vitoria in June 1813, Ross's guns were {{continually}} with the most advanced troops, and they captured the sole remaining piece of artillery held by the French troops. He was rewarded with promotion to lieutenant colonel on 3 July 1813. In July 1813, Ross also took part in the Battle of the Pyrenees, which was followed by actions at Bidassoa in October 1813 and Nivelle in November 1813. During the Battle of the Nive in December 1813, Ross had his horse shot <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>him,</b> but he was unharmed and in April 1814 he fought at the Battle of Bayonne. Following these military successes, he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath on 4 January 1815. During the Hundred Days, Ross was engaged at the Battle of Waterloo in June 1815, and although half his guns were disabled, the remainder took part in the pursuit of the French. He was awarded the Russian Order of St. Anna, 2nd Class on 8 October 1815.|$|E

25|$|The torrid scoring pace slowed {{during much}} of the third quarter, as both teams began to assert {{themselves}} on the defensive side of the ball. But late in the quarter, a 12-yard punt return by Cowboys receiver Butch Johnson gave Dallas good field position on their 42-yard line. The Cowboys subsequently drove down to the Steelers 10-yard line, mostly with Dorsett's rushing. Then on third down with less than three minutes remaining in the period, Staubach spotted 38-year-old reserve tight end Jackie Smith wide open in the end zone and threw him the ball. Head coach Tom Landry said Staubach tried to throw the ball soft when he saw how wide open Smith was and that it came in low, and that when Smith tried to stop, his feet seemed to come <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>him.</b> Jackie Smith states that it was still a catchable ball and that he should have made the play. Instead, Smith dropped the pass and the Cowboys had to settle for a field goal from kicker Rafael Septién, cutting their deficit to 21–17. Though Smith played 16 years in the league and is now enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, he is perhaps best known for this dropped touchdown, particularly in a championship game that was ultimately decided by four points.|$|E
