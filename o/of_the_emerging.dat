5|$|A radical {{strategy}} for avoiding predators which may otherwise kill {{a large majority}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>emerging</b> young of a population is to emerge very rarely, at irregular intervals. This strategy is seen in dramatic form in the periodical cicadas, which emerge at intervals of 13 or 17 years. Predators with a life-cycle of {{one or a few}} years are unable to reproduce rapidly enough in response to such an emergence, so predator satiation is a likely evolutionary explanation for the cicadas' unusual life-cycle, though not the only one. Predators may still feast on the emerging cicadas, but are unable to consume more than a fraction of the brief surfeit of prey.|$|E
5|$|Despite early success, the series, {{along with}} the overall rhythm game genre, {{suffered}} from poor sales starting in 2009.

5|$|During the 2nd century AD Irish {{influence}} {{was at work}} in the region and by the 6th century the kingdom of Dál Riata was established. Unlike the P-Celtic speaking Brythons, these Gaels spoke a form of Gaelic that still survives in the Hebrides. Through the efforts of Saint Ninian and others Christianity slowly supplanted Druidism. Dál Riata flourished from the time of Fergus Mór in the late fifth century until the Viking incursions that commenced in the late eighth century. Islands close to the shores of modern Ayrshire would have remained part of the Kingdom of Strathclyde during this period, whilst the main islands became part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>emerging</b> Kingdom of Alba founded by Kenneth MacAlpin (Cináed mac Ailpín).|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1940s, {{in the face}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>emerging</b> Cold War scenario, the RAF came to {{recognise}} that it would urgently require the development and procurement of fighters equipped with features such as swept wings. By this time, it had also become apparent that newly developed jet propulsion would form the future of fighter aircraft development. Many companies were quick to devise their own designs to harness this means of propulsion. Hawker Aviation's chief designer, Sydney Camm, had proposed the Hawker P.1040 for the RAF, but the demonstrator failed to interest them. Further modifications to the basic design resulted in the Hawker Sea Hawk carrier-based fighter. However, the Sea Hawk possessed a straight wing and was powered by the Rolls-Royce Nene turbojet engine, both features that rapidly became obsolete.|$|E

40|$|We have {{investigated}} <b>the</b> dynamic response <b>of</b> a coronal helmet streamer {{to the emergence}} from below of a current with its magnetic field in a direction opposite to the overlying streamer field. Once <b>the</b> <b>emerging</b> current moves into <b>the</b> closed region <b>of</b> <b>the</b> streamer, a current sheet forms between <b>the</b> <b>emerging</b> field and <b>the</b> streamer field, because the preexisting field and <b>the</b> newly <b>emerging</b> field have opposite polarities. Thus magnetic reconnection will occur at <b>the</b> flanks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>emerged</b> structure where <b>the</b> current density is maximum. If <b>the</b> <b>emerging</b> current is large enough, the energy contained in the current and the reconnection will promptly disrupt the streamer. If <b>the</b> <b>emerging</b> current is small, the streamer will experience a stage of slow evolution. In this stage, slow magnetic reconnection occurring at <b>the</b> flanks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>emerged</b> structure leads to <b>the</b> degeneration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>emerged</b> current to a neutral point. Above this point, a new magnetic bubble will form. The resulting configuration resembles an inverse-polarity prominence. Depending on the initial input energy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> current, the resulting structure will either remain in situ, forming a quasi-static structure, or move upward, forming a coronal transient similar to coronal jets. The numerical method used in this paper {{can be used to}} construct helmet streamers containing a detached magnetic structure in their closed field region. The quasi-static solution may serve as a preevent corona for studying coronal mass ejection initiation...|$|R

5|$|Jocelin (or Jocelyn) (died 1199) was a twelfth-century Cistercian monk and cleric {{who became}} the fourth Abbot of Melrose before {{becoming}} Bishop of Glasgow, Scotland. He was probably born in the 1130s, and in his teenage years became a monk of Melrose Abbey.

5|$|L'Orfeo is, in Redlich's analysis, {{the product}} of two musical epochs. It {{combines}} elements of the traditional madrigal style of the 16th century with those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>emerging</b> Florentine mode, in particular the use of recitative and monodic singing as developed by the Camerata and their successors. In this new style, the text dominates the music; while sinfonias and instrumental ritornelli illustrate the action, the audience's attention is always drawn primarily to the words. The singers are required {{to do more than}} produce pleasant vocal sounds; they must represent their characters in depth and convey appropriate emotions.|$|E

5|$|Roddenberry {{intended}} {{the show to}} have a progressive political agenda reflective <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>emerging</b> counter-culture of the youth movement, though he was not fully forthcoming to the networks about this. He wanted Star Trek to show humanity what it might develop into, if it would learn from {{the lessons of the}} past, most specifically by ending violence. An extreme example is the alien species, the Vulcans, who had a violent past but learned to control their emotions. Roddenberry also gave Star Trek an anti-war message and depicted the United Federation of Planets as an ideal, optimistic version of the United Nations. His efforts were opposed by the network because of concerns over marketability, e.g., they opposed Roddenberry's insistence that Enterprise have a racially diverse crew.|$|E
5|$|With the {{disintegration}} of the Vijayanagara Empire in the late 16th and early 17th centuries, the centres of Kannada literature moved to the courts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>emerging</b> independent kingdoms, the Kingdom of Mysore and the Keladi Nayakas. Writers in these courts, many of whom were Veerashaiva by faith, were not only adept in Kannada but often also in Sanskrit and/or Telugu. Two such writers were Kalale Nanjaraja and Kempe Gowda, the founder of Bangalore. This multi-linguality was perhaps a lingering legacy of the cosmopolitan Vijayanagara literary culture and the emerging social responsibilities of the Veerashaiva monastic order which no longer confined itself to a Kannada only audience, but rather sought to spread its influence across southern India.|$|E

5|$|Although Etty painted {{many private}} portraits {{of his friends}} and acquaintances, he {{produced}} very few publicly exhibited portraits, fewer than 30 of which were shown during his lifetime. Portraiture was seen as a vulgar and generally worthless form of painting throughout much of the 19th century, and portrait painters continued to be disparaged as a greedy and unimaginative group who survived by feeding the vanity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>emerging</b> middle class. Other than Preparing for a Fancy Dress Ball, critics generally disliked his portraits, preferring his history paintings in spite of reservations over his depictions of nudity. Preparing for a Fancy Dress Ball did, however, serve as an indication that Etty could successfully paint works as commissions for the English elite, boosting his status and leading to further commissions. Etty died in November 1849 and soon fell from fashion; by the late 19th century the cost of all his paintings had fallen below their original prices. Charlotte Williams-Wynn became a noted letter writer and diarist; Mary Williams-Wynn married Member of Parliament James Milnes Gaskell. Both Charlotte and Mary died in April 1869.|$|E

The speeches he and Sașa Pană gave on the occasion, published by Orizont journal, were noted for condoning official positions of the PCF and the Romanian Communist Party, and are credited by Irina Livezeanu with causing a rift between Tzara and young Romanian avant-gardists such as Victor Brauner and Gherasim Luca (who rejected communism and were alarmed by the Iron Curtain having fallen over Europe). In September of the same year, he was present at the conference of the pro-communist International Union of Students (where he was a guest of the French-based Union of Communist Students, and met with similar organizations from Romania and other countries).|$|E
5|$|Horses, {{originally}} {{acquired from}} Spanish New Mexico, spread widely via native trade networks, reaching the Shoshone of the Snake River Plain by 1700. The Nez Perce, Cayuse, and Flathead people acquired their first horses around 1730. Along with horses came aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>emerging</b> plains culture, such as equestrian and horse training skills, greatly increased mobility, hunting efficiency, trade over long distances, intensified warfare, the linking {{of wealth and}} prestige to horses and war, {{and the rise of}} large and powerful tribal confederacies. The Nez Perce and Cayuse kept large herds and made annual long-distance trips to the Great Plains for bison hunting, adopted the plains culture to a significant degree, and became the main conduit through which horses and the plains culture diffused into the Columbia River region. Other peoples acquired horses and aspects of the plains culture unevenly. The Yakama, Umatilla, Palus, Spokane, and Coeur d'Alene maintained sizable herds of horses and adopted some of the plains cultural characteristics, but fishing and fish-related economies remained important. Less affected groups included the Molala, Klickitat, Wenatchi, Okanagan, and Sinkiuse-Columbia peoples, who owned small numbers of horses and adopted few plains culture features. Some groups remained essentially unaffected, such as the Sanpoil and Nespelem people, whose culture remained centered on fishing.|$|E
