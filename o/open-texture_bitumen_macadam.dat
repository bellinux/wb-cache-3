40|$|Understanding the {{deformation}} behaviour of asphaltic mixtures in {{flexible pavement}} relies, to some extent, on {{the understanding of}} their volumetric behaviour. Also, for an accurate simulation of the deformation behaviour of asphaltic mixtures by constitutive models, this behaviour needs to be considered and taken into account. In this research, the volumetric behaviour of asphaltic mixtures under uniaxial and triaixal creep tests has been investigated. Two types of asphaltic mixtures used in the UK pavements, namely a gap graded Hot Rolled Asphalt (HRA 30 / 10) and a continuously graded Dense <b>Bitumen</b> <b>Macadam</b> (10 mm DBM), both made with the same 70 / 100 penetration grade bitumen, have been selected. The radial and axial strains of cylindrical specimens under various test conditions have been measured and the volumetric and shear strain have been calculated. The variation of the volumetric strain is found to increase linearly with the shear strain with {{the slope of the}} line dependent on the temperature and type of mixture and independent of the deviator and confining stress levels...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a comparison between}} an indirect tensile fatigue method and the currently preferred European standard two-point bending, trapezoidal fatigue test. A study was undertaken using both tests to determine the fatigue properties of a standard UK asphalt mixture at two temperatures of 10 and 30 °C. The fatigue life, in addition to using the traditional 90 % reduction in initial stiffness, was also computed using a fatigue failure point based on the transition between the quasi-stationary phase (associated with a uniform stiffness decrease {{and the development of}} micro-cracks) and the failure phase (associated with localised crack propagation). This fatigue failure point, determined by taking the peak of the product of loading cycles and stiffness versus loading cycles, was also converted into an alternative form used to determine the fatigue failure point for the indirect tensile fatigue test. Separate fatigue relationships were produced for the four combinations of test method and temperature based on the phenomenological initial tensile strain versus fatigue life relationship. Although the indirect tensile fatigue test produced shorter fatigue lives compared to the two-point bending fatigue test, it was also possible to combine all four fatigue relationships to produce one unique fatigue function for the 20 mm dense <b>bitumen</b> <b>macadam</b> asphalt mixture...|$|R
50|$|The {{main and}} {{longitudinal}} girders {{have been designed}} as welded lattice steel members of sufficient depth to incorporate the access walkways. In addition to transferring the roof load to the columns these girders also have the 'V' strain insulators attached to them. The side framing of the building as well as carrying the wall cladding also supports the wall bushings and provides anchorage for the strainer connections between the turbine house and the switch house. The switch house was designed so as to fit in the architectural treatment of the Power Station as a whole. The plastic-coated aluminium cladding is therefore coloured black on {{the north and south}} faces of the building and gold on the east and west. The roof line of the switch house is designed to blend with the 'saw tooth' effect on the turbine house roof. Construction work began in the severely cold winter of 1962/63. The cold weather was turned to advantage as the clay subsoil which is generally unmanageable when wet was frozen solid. Excavation went on uninterrupted on drainage branches during this period. The wet mix base was next introduced over all the site. The object of the wet mix was to apply a firm layer for the construction to be carried on even when subsoil clay was wet. Construction traffic also tended to compact the wet mix therefore improving it as a base for the final topcoat of <b>bitumen</b> <b>macadam.</b>|$|R

A comprehensive literature review was conducted with literature related to both local an international context to determine the road deterioration factors, road defects, rate of deterioration [...] . etc both locally and foreign countries. Moreover, the literature review was accompanied with the road condition surveys where sophisticated equipments were used in developed countries while manual data collection methods were used in developing countries like ours. In achieving the above objectives, a suitable surface condition survey form was developed. Surface condition survey form was accompanied with road surface information, road geometry, sand sealing history and road deformations. Traffic data and sand sealing history were obtained from Provincial Road Development Authority (PRDA) and the rest was obtained by field observations. Data collection was carried out in selected <b>Bitumen</b> penetration <b>macadam</b> roads for about nine months. Cracks, potholes, edge defects, depressions, corrugations are the significant road defects observed in the field. Traffic, age, road geometry, weather, drainage, construction quality as well construction material, maintenance policy play the major role as road deteriorate agents. Potholes and cracks were mainly considered in the field observations of road deformations. The data was analysed by usingthe statistical softwares SPSS and SAS. Category data was used for data analysis and statistical tests were carried out to check the significance of the road deterioration agents. It was found that both potholes and cracks were having significant relationship with age as well as traffic...|$|R
40|$|A modern road {{pavement}} {{is a highly}} complex structure. Paving materials can exhibit non-linear and time dependent material properties whilst subjected to complicated three-dimensional loading conditions that are functions of the specific construction of each pavement. Nevertheless, empirical or linear elastic techniques, which cannot fully describe such factors, are often used in road engineering to assess pavement deterioration. An alternative approach {{is the use of}} finite element techniques, incorporating more complex constitutive models, to describe the response of asphalts and other paving materials. This thesis is concerned with the experimental determination of the model parameters necessary for the characterisation of two UK asphalt mixtures, for use in a dynamic plasticity based constitutive model to simulate paving material response. The constitutive model is under development at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, where it will be implemented in a three-dimensional finite element code. The thesis describes the constitutive framework for the material response model. It also details the experimental work and numerical verification undertaken in the study to enable the determination of the basic model parameters required to describe a 10 mm dense <b>bitumen</b> <b>macadam</b> and 30 / 10 hot rolled asphalt mixture, for use in the constitutive model. The characterisation of the mixtures has been undertaken through a series of quasi-static uniaxial compression and tension tests, which due to the significant influence of strain rate and temperature on the response of the asphaltic materials, were undertaken over a range of displacement rates and temperatures. Through specification of key model parameters as functions of material strength, temperature and strain rate, and the development of relationships describing the hardening and softening characteristic of the mixtures, the constitutive model has been successfully utilised to simulate the temperature and rate dependent stress-strain response of the asphalt mixtures to compressive loads...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} cope with the {{ever-increasing}} traffic loading and to minimise the cost of road construction and maintenance, several road trials of high modulus base (HMB) materials containing a 15 penetration grade bitumen (known as HMB 15) have been carried out in the UK since 1990 s. It has been showed that, although HMB 15 behaved in a similar way to conventional dense <b>bitumen</b> <b>Macadam</b> with a cost saving of approximately 25 %, its long-term durability (aging and moisture damage) is still a major concern of researchers as considerable deteriorations have been commonly observed during the ongoing investigations on cored samples from the sites (either with or without traffic loading). The aim of this paper was to quantitatively show the relationship between aging properties of HMB 15 and its binder film thickness (binder content), so that an optimum binder content could be determined. In order to achieve this, 5 groups of cylindrical HMB 15 specimens with different binder contents (3. 5 %, 4 %, 4. 5 %, 5 % and 5. 5 %) were fabricated and subjected to SHRP long-term oven aging test (at 85 oC for 5 days), their mechanical properties both before and after aging simulation were tested using indirect tensile stiffness modulus (ITSM) tests. In addition, binders were recovered at different aging stages and their rheological characteristics were investigated with dynamic shear rheometer (DSR) tests. Based on these, aging indices of different groups were calculated and their mathematical relationship with binder film thicknesses was regressed. The results showed that the aging properties of HMB 15 mixtures were significantly affected by their binder film thicknesses. However, regression analysis between aging indices and binder film thicknesses indicated that, as the binder film becomes thicker than 9. 5 μm, the change of aging indices with film thicknesses becomes minor and therefore, a film thickness of approximately 9. 5 μm was recommended for HMB 15 mixtures...|$|R
40|$|Strength {{development}} in Cold-Emulsion Reclaimed Asphalt Pavements is gradual and largely {{dependent on the}} rate at which curing proceeds. Its early life strength is therefore low and presents a major challenge in material specification for mechanistic pavement design. The solution has been to subject a sample of the mixture {{to be used in the}} pavement to accelerated laboratory curing to the attainment of Equilibrium Moisture Content (EMC) condition. Fatigue and Stiffness parameters of the mix along with the chemical properties of the binder can be determined from the cured samples and results incorporated into the pavement design process. The emphasis is in the choice of a laboratory curing protocol that adequately simulates expected curing trends in the field. Protocols in popular use employ steady state curing temperatures to predict long term behaviour of Reclaimed Asphalt Pavements. This project set out to investigate the likely effects of seasonal variations and diurnal cycles in ambient temperatures on the engineering properties of Reclaimed Asphalt and the incorporated binders. To simulate the above phenomena, a predictive model was adopted in computation of high and low temperature peaks that can be expected in two pavements, one in the tropics and the other in a temperate region. The resulting sets of temperatures were used to cyclically cure Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement cores that were manufactured by artificially aging Dense <b>Bitumen</b> <b>Macadam</b> (DBM) in the laboratory and mixing it with a cationic bitumen emulsion. Another set of cores were subjected to steady temperatures as is the current practice. This acted as a control for the two cyclic temperatures under study. Use was made of a suite of tests available in the Nottingham Asphalt Tester (NAT) to determine stiffness and fatigue properties of the mix under the three treatments. Bitumen binders recovered at the end of curing was tested for penetration, softening point temperatures and percentage of Asphaltenes. The findings pointed at a likelihood of severe treatment of asphalt samples by the existing laboratory curing protocols. Curing at a steady temperature led to a lower fatigue life, over estimation of early life strength and underestimation of long term strength of the cold asphalt. Low penetration values, high softening point temperatures and high percentages of Asphaltenes in bitumen from the cured samples attest to severe aging of the samples...|$|R
40|$|Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used material in the construction of asphalt pavements. Approximately 650 million tonnes of asphalts for road pavements were produced, worldwide, in 2014. However, the HMA industry is responsible for a substantial consumption of energy, the creation of health and safety issues and has a negative impact on the environment. These shortcomings initiated substantial discussion within the industry with the aim to develop more environmental friendly, sustainable and economic pavement materials. These have resulted in the development of cold bitumen emulsion mixtures (CBEMs). However, to date, low early life stiffness, a slower rate of curing, the length of time necessary to achieve full strength, high air void contents and the presence of moisture in these mixtures have prevented them from being fully embraced by pavement authorities. This led to them being considered inferior to HMA {{because of a lack of}} essential mechanical properties. Currently, the use of CBEMs in pavement construction is limited to low traffic road surface course, reinstatement works and footways. Because of this, the development of CBEMs with high early strength and minimal time delay requirements before structural loading, would be considered as a breakthrough in CBEM research. This research aims to develop a novel, fast-curing and environmentally friendly, cold binder course emulsion asphalt (CBCEA) for heavily trafficked roads. The new CBCEA mixture comprises the same gradation as conventional dense <b>bitumen</b> <b>macadam</b> (DBM) mixtures which are normally used as a binder course and base in road pavements in the UK. The new CBCEA incorporates a new cementitious material, alkali activated binary blended cement filler (ABBCF), made from Paper Making Sludge Ash (PMSA) and a Fluid Catalytic Cracking Catalysts Residue (FC 3 R) activated by a waste NaOH solution (W-NaOH). Incorporation of the PMSA and FC 3 R was achieved through the replacement of conventional limestone filler (LF), while W-NaOH replaced the pre-water necessary to wet the aggregate in the CBCEA. It was found that the glass phases of the new filler particles were broken and reacted with Ca(OH) 2 creating C-S-H gel through the hydration process. This results in a very high early strength and improved mechanical properties. Balanced oxide compositions, within the new filler, were identified as responsible for an enhanced hydration reaction. A laboratory programme of testing measured the stiffness modulus, conducted at 1, 3, 7, 14, 28, 90 and 180 days. Susceptibility to temperature, wheel track testing to establish rutting resistance, fatigue resistance measured by a four-point beam bending test, fracture resistance testing via semi-circular bending tests, moisture damage resistance and ageing tests were successfully performed. Advanced techniques for microstructure assessment, i. e. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), were used to provide scientific data to provide a deeper understanding of the microstructure and internal composition. An environmental investigation was performed using a Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) test. The new ABBCF mixture offers a significant improvement in stiffness modulus compared to HMA and the reference cold binder course mixture containing conventional limestone filler (LF). Target stiffness, according to British and European standards, can be surpassed after less than one day of curing. The new ABBCF mixture offers a stiffness modulus which is 27 times better than the LF mixture after 3 days. This will overcome restrictions caused by the length of time required to achieve acceptable stiffness by traditional CBEMs. More remarkably, the new ABBCF mixture is 78 % better than mixtures treated with Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) in terms of ITSM after 3 days. Furthermore, the impact of a rise in temperature on stiffness modulus from 5 to 45 °C, was much larger in LF and both HMA mixtures in comparison to ABBCF, revealing the potential to use these mixes in severe conditions, both hot and cold weathers. ABBCF mixtures displayed considerably reduced susceptibility to permanent deformation, demonstrating the potential advantage of using this material on heavily trafficked roads. Fatigue resistance was noticeably improved by the use of ABBCF in comparison to the reference LF and HMAs. Improved water sensitivity for progressive hydration with the new ABBCF was also established resulting in an enhanced long ageing performance meaning that these mixtures can be considered durable. SEM observation and XRD analysis confirmed the formation of hydration products at various curing times. The concentration of heavy metals in the samples incorporating ABBCF was observed to be less than the regulatory levels determined for hazardous materials. Microwave treatment has proven to be an effective technique to reduce the air void contents of the ABBCF mixture and achieve acceptable levels of porosity. Finally, achieving the aim of the current research will theoretically increase the application of such mixtures and allow them to be used as structural pavement materials. On a further positive note, the inclusion of waste and by-product materials in CBEMs results in more sustainable practice and eliminates disposal problems...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focused on}} the review and {{background}} theory of previous studies on fatigue failure criteria, experimental work and results’ analysis. Several techniques are used for testing fatigue performance for both hot mix asphalt (HMA) and fine aggregate matrix (FAM), such as two-, three- and four-point bending, indirect tension and uniaxial tests. In recent years, a new technique has been introduced using the Dynamic Shear Rheometer (DSR). This technique is based on applying a sinusoidal deformation or loading onto small cylindrical samples, 12 mm diameter and 50 mm height, and the response is analysed to obtain phase angle and deformation data under any given circumstances, such as temperature, frequency, etc. The DSR is limited to test bitumen and fine aggregates matrix FAM samples only; nevertheless, no research efforts have been found that use a DSR to study the performance of full HMA samples. In this work, a successful trial was proposed using a DSR for fatigue testing of HMA under controlled strain and stress modes. Two types of aggregates, limestone and granite with two binder grades, 40 / 60 and 160 / 220, were employed to prepare four different mixes of hot rolled asphalt (HRA) and dense <b>bitumen</b> <b>macadam</b> (DBM). A technical procedure was adopted to prepare the DSR samples (12 mm in diameter and 50 mm in height) and a statistical procedure based on histograms and modes for the bulk density of the DSR samples was used to select the samples {{to be tested for}} fatigue. An approach was developed based on sweep strain/stress amplitude to arrive at a suitable strain and stress amplitude at the damage region {{to be used in the}} fatigue test. A new fatigue index (FIR) parameter was derived from the dissipated pseudo-strain energy for the stress-pseudo-strain relationship to be used for evaluating fatigue performance. Results showed that there is a plateau value for FIR which can be used to evaluate fatigue performance, and this value increases when the normalised shear modulus decreases to less than 0. 35 and 0. 20 for strain and stress test modes respectively. In addition, the FIR results were in agreement with the results from other reliable approaches that have been used for evaluating fatigue performance, such as the energy ratio (ER) and the traditional approach (TA). A two-point bending (2 PB) test for trapezoidal samples was used to verify the DSR technique using FIR, TA and ER approaches; the analysis of results revealed the same conclusions as the DSR technique. The variance in the results of the tested samples was studied using error bars in terms of standard of error for all approaches in both techniques: DSR and 2 PB. This variance analysis revealed that FIR has low variation in comparison with the TA and ER approaches in both test techniques. A computational model based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) was used in this work for developing models to predict the fatigue performance of hot mix asphalt (HMA). The fatigue performance was defined according to the criteria of the TA, ER and FIR approaches. The results revealed an excellent correlation between the predicted and experimental data. Bias analysis for ANN models involving average error, intercept and slope showed that the strain test mode was more accurate than the stress test mode. A fracture mechanistic approach was also used to evaluate the fracture performance of HMA tested in DSR. A simple fracture model was developed based on a modified Paris’ law and fatigue test parameters represented by relaxation test coefficient (m) and the dissipated pseudo-strain energy to calculate an internal damage parameter, namely the fracture damage index (FIc). The analysis of the results for FIc was in agreement with the FIR, ER and TA approaches; also, it showed better performance analysis in terms of variation than the TA and ER approaches. The fracture model, FIc, was used as a base for developing a model for predicting fatigue life of HMA in terms of number of cycles for strain and stress test modes. The bias analysis revealed that the strain model’s prediction accuracy was better than that of the stress model. Hysteretic behaviour represents the nonlinear relationship of the stress–strain response for HMA under cyclic loading during fatigue testing. In this regard, a successful trial introduced for modelling the hysteresis loops using Bouc-Wen model for HMA samples tested for fatigue under controlled strain mode using DSR. The nonlinear least squares algorithm was used to estimate the seven parameters for the Bouc-Wen model using experimental results for hysteresis loops of the HMA samples tested in DSR; these parameters control the shape and slope of the degraded hysteresis loops. The outcome of this work confirmed that there is a good agreement between the modelled and experimental hysteresis loops. Due to the variation in the fatigue performance of HMA samples as a result of their properties, the Bouc-Wen model was not able to fully simulate the degradation for different samples when there were changes in the parameters. To improve the Bouc-Wen model’s simulation performance, an ANN technique was used to develop models to predict its parameters; this technique improved the Bouc-Wen model’s performance in Phase I, while its performance in Phase II-III was still poor, despite the degradation simulation being clear. This work revealed the feasibility of using the DSR technique in evaluating the fatigue performance of full HMA according to the developed approaches for preparing and selecting DSR samples and performing fatigue tests. In addition, the work confirmed that limestone has a better fatigue performance for both HRA and DBM mixes than granite. On the other hand, the theoretical part included developing several models based on an ANN and constitutive equations showed the efficiency of these models in predicting the fatigue life of HMA samples tested in the DSR...|$|R
40|$|The primary work {{reported}} in this thesis is concerned mainly {{with the effects of}} different mixing methods and RAP materials on homogeneity and mechanical properties of hot recycled asphalt mixtures. The recycled asphalt mixture conforms to the requirement of BS 4987 - 1 (2005) for dense <b>bitumen</b> <b>macadam</b> size 10 mm (DBM 10 mm). The proportion of RAP in the recycled mixture is 40 %. RAP materials are artificially aged and processed in the laboratory to prevent the variability of RAP gradation, bitumen content, and the origin. Laboratory RAP is also used to assure that every single RAP particle is an agglomerate of RAP aggregate and binder. The mixing procedures include Black Rock (BR), Complete Blending (CB), the SHRP procedure, and a newly developed field simulation method (FS). The primary difference between these methods is the mixing mechanism. The BR case implies the situation in which there is completely no interaction between RAP and virgin binder. On the contrary, RAP and virgin binder are fully interacted in the CB case. The mixing procedures for BR and CB cases conform to those for conventional asphalt mixtures. However, the bitumen for BR case is pure virgin bitumen. In addition, the bitumen for CB is the blend between RAP and virgin binder. The RAP/virgin binder proportion is 4 / 6. In the SHRP method, RAP is preheated at 110 oC for two hours before being mixed with virgin aggregate and binder for 2 minutes at 130 oC. In the FS method on the contrary, the mixing procedure duplicates what occurs in the asphalt mixing plant. RAP is mixed with superheated virgin aggregate (215 oC) for different durations before this combination is blended with virgin bitumen for 2 minutes at 130 oC. The RAP/superheated virgin aggregate mixing duration starts from short mixing time where RAP still exists at approximately original size and gradually increases until the change in RAP lump size is insignificant. Depending on the size of RAP used, RAP/superheated virgin aggregate mixing duration varies from 1 to 8 minutes. The homogeneity of hot recycled asphalt mixture is examined by using virgin binder with a different colour from that of RAP binder. The colour of virgin binder is obtained by mixing clear binder (Shell Mexphalt C 160 / 220 Pen) with iron oxide pigment. The proportion of pigment is 10 % by weight of the binder making this binder red. The use of virgin binder with different colour from that of RAP binder helps to clearly differentiate the locations of RAP and virgin materials. Surfaces of slices cut from compacted recycled specimens are photographed by digital camera. The analysis of these surfaces in vertical order allows the locations of RAP material to be qualitatively identified in a 3 D manner. Stiffness modulus values of samples for homogeneity assessment are also determined by indirect tensile stiffness test. The stiffness test is carried out in four directions along the circumference of each specimen with 45 o angular increments. The experimental results show that the stiffness measurement in four directions can indicate the heterogeneity of recycled mixture. The variation in stiffness values in different measured directions will be substantial for heterogeneous mixtures and minor in the case where recycled mixtures are homogeneous. The results indicate there are mutual relations between mixing effort, homogeneity, and stiffness values of recycled asphalt mixtures. The longer mixing time will enhance the homogeneity and reduce the variation in stiffness values of recycled mixture. In addition, as more RAP and virgin binder are incorporated, the stiffness values of recycled mixture generally increase once the mixing time is extended. As the clear binder is dyed red by 10 % by weight of iron oxide, the proportion of the pigment certainly alters the flow characteristic of binder. This might affect the mixing process and rejuvenating effect between virgin and aged binder. Therefore, the effects of mixing methods and RAP sizes on mechanical performance of hot recycled asphalt mixtures are further investigated using normal straight run bitumen 160 / 220 Pen as virgin binder. The assessment indicators include stiffness modulus, resistance to fatigue damage, and resistance to permanent deformation. The experimental results indicate that the conventional laboratory mixing method (SHRP) tends to overestimate the mechanical properties of recycled asphalt mixture. The long RAP preheating time that never exists in the industry coincidentally enhances the reaction between RAP and virgin binder. The long RAP preheating time also slightly alters the properties of RAP binder. For the FS method, the increase in mixing duration significantly improves the homogeneity level of recycled mixtures. The homogeneity level is also substantially affected by the size of RAP material. For the same mixing effort, the mixtures comprised of small RAP are generally more homogeneous than those made from larger RAP. The more homogeneous the mixture, the more interaction between RAP and virgin binder. Therefore, recycled mixtures become stiffer and have better resistance to permanent deformation and fatigue failure. A slightly linear increase in stiffness can result in an exponential increase in fatigue life of the recycled mixture. The mechanical properties including stiffness modulus, resistance to fatigue damage, and resistance to permanent deformation of hot recycled asphalt mixtures are not {{similar to those of the}} BR or CB mixtures, even at the favourable condition where RAP is preheated for 2 hours at 110 oC in the SHRP method and 8 minutes mixing duration in the FS method. This implies that RAP does not act as Black Rock. In addition, the assumption that RAP and virgin binder are fully blended also never exists in the recycled asphalt production process.
