5|$|A {{total of}} 104 athletes won medals for their NOCs, but the athletes from Norway and Finland stood out and {{dominated}} the Games, winning 17 and 11 medals, respectively. The United States and Great Britain {{tied for third}} place in the count of total medals, with four each. Athletes from 10 of the 16 participating NOCs won at least one medal; eight won at least one gold medal. Many of the athletes who won these medals had already returned to their home countries {{by the time the}} medals were awarded, on 5 February, and <b>other</b> <b>participants</b> from their countries had to take the medals to the winning athletes.|$|E

5|$|Because the {{pay-per-view}} {{focused on}} the tournament, few major feuds were highlighted. Aside from Owen Hart, the tournament did not figure prominently into the future storylines {{of any of the}} <b>other</b> <b>participants.</b> The qualifying match between the 1–2–3 Kid and Adam Bomb did, however, help advance a storyline. Bomb and Kwang, both managed by Harvey Wippleman, began feuding shortly after King of the Ring when Wippleman and Kwang turned on Bomb. Bomb began wrestling as a face as a result. Their feud did not end with a major blow off match, however. Instead, it was quietly resolved in a dark match prior to the SummerSlam 1994 broadcast.|$|E
5|$|Colonel Harvey's {{account of}} the smoke-filled room had Harding being sent for {{in the early morning}} hours, to be {{informed}} by Harvey that the Ohioan would be the candidate. Harvey stated he asked if there was anything in Harding's background that might harm his candidacy, to which the senator, who had had at least one extramarital affair, replied there was not. Harding biographer Charles W. Murray noted that there is no evidence besides Harvey's word that Harding went to the Hays suite that night, and that <b>other</b> <b>participants</b> denied that Harding was there. Harding was so uncertain of victory that he filed for re-election to the Senate, though Daugherty continued to urge delegates to support him.|$|E

5|$|Morgan's {{department}} always faced financial {{struggles in}} an era before much federal research funding was available. To raise funds, Morgan provided food service educational courses to teachers, nurses and <b>other</b> <b>participants.</b> These classes ultimately weakened the department's reputation at the university, as school officials viewed the training as vocational and considered it to be beneath {{the standards of the}} university. Because of this, Morgan was prohibited from accepting industry funding for research and the university provided her with very little space to conduct her research work. Adding to the difficulty of the situation was the fact that university officials had previously criticized Morgan for maintaining academic standards that were too high for a home economics program.|$|E
5|$|Research by the Glasgow Media Group {{indicates}} that coverage of Sinn Féin by the BBC before the ban was minimal. In 1988 Sinn Féin was only heard or {{seen on television}} 93 times, had only 17 of the 633 formal BBC interviews as compared to 121 interviews with the Conservative Party and 172 with the Royal Ulster Constabulary and the civil service, and were never interviewed in the studio like many <b>other</b> <b>participants.</b> However, after the ban there was a steep decline in coverage of Sinn Féin and Republican views, with television appearances being reduced to 34 times in the following year, and the delays and uncertainties caused by ambiguities, voice-overs and subtitles often led to coverage and films being dropped entirely.|$|E
5|$|Several {{individuals}} have consistently scored highly and/or earned medals on the IMO: As of July 2015 Zhuo Qun Song (Canada) {{is the most}} successful participant with five gold medals (including one perfect score in 2015) and one bronze medal. Reid Barton (United States) was the first participant to win a gold medal four times (1998-2001). Barton {{is also one of}} only eight four-time Putnam Fellow (2001–04). Christian Reiher (Germany), Lisa Sauermann (Germany), Teodor von Burg (Serbia), and Nipun Pitimanaaree (Thailand) are the only <b>other</b> <b>participants</b> to have won four gold medals (2000–03, 2008–11, 2009–12, 2010–13, and 2011–14 respectively); Reiher also received a bronze medal (1999), Sauermann a silver medal (2007), von Burg a silver medal (2008) and a bronze medal (2007), and Pitimanaaree a silver medal (2009). Wolfgang Burmeister (East Germany), Martin Härterich (West Germany), Iurie Boreico (Moldova), and Lim Jeck (Singapore) are the only <b>other</b> <b>participants</b> besides Reiher, Sauermann, von Burg, and Pitimanaaree to win five medals with at least three of them gold. Ciprian Manolescu (Romania) managed to write a perfect paper (42 points) for gold medal more times than anybody else {{in the history of the}} competition, doing it all three times he participated in the IMO (1995, 1996, 1997). Manolescu is also a three-time Putnam Fellow (1997, 1998, 2000). Eugenia Malinnikova (Soviet Union) is the highest-scoring female contestant in IMO history. She has 3 gold medals in IMO 1989 (41 points), IMO 1990 (42) and IMO 1991 (42), missing only 1 point in 1989 to precede Manolescu's achievement.|$|E

5|$|A counterattack to {{take back}} the {{airfield}} and Point 107 was organised for the following day at Hargest's headquarters. He was exhausted and had to take a quick nap before a conference to work out detailed plans for the counter-attack, much to the disgust of some of the <b>other</b> <b>participants.</b> Afterwards, he became pessimistic of the chances of success and unsuccessfully sought to have the attack called off. The attack did fail but Hargest, still well behind the frontlines, mistakenly believed it to be going well until he found that his brigade had returned to their starting positions. His pessimism began to affect Puttick, who asked Freyberg to allow the 5th Infantry Brigade to withdraw, which it duly did. This began an eventual retreat and evacuation from Crete on 31 May, with Hargest flying out for Egypt by seaplane, his brigade following by sea.|$|E

The second, a shorter-term one, is to have 24 nations from three continents participate at next year's canoe sprint world championships in Poznań. Besides the medalists from this year's world championships being from Italy, the United States, Canada, Brazil and France, <b>other</b> <b>participants</b> included Great Britain and Portugal. The process to include paddleability into the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil began on 1 October 2009 and approval was reached on 16 July 2010.|$|E
5|$|In around 1770 {{the neoclassical}} {{architect}} Robert Adam designed Pulteney Bridge, a three-arched bridge spanning the River Avon. He used as his prototype an original, but unused, design by Andrea Palladio for the Rialto Bridge in Venice. Adam also submitted {{plans for the}} new Assembly Rooms but these were rejected as too costly. John Wood, the Younger raised funding {{for the construction of}} the Assembly Rooms by the use of a Tontine, an investment plan that is named after the Neapolitan banker Lorenzo de Tonti, who is credited with inventing it in France in 1653. It combines features of a group annuity and a lottery. Each subscriber pays an agreed sum into the fund, and thereafter receives an annuity. As members die, their shares devolve to the <b>other</b> <b>participants,</b> and so the value of each annuity increases. On the death of the last member, the scheme is wound up. Construction started in 1769 and was completed in 1771, when a grand opening was held.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to his usually conciliatory nature, Crittenden was drawn into a disagreement between congressmen Jonathan Cilley and William J. Graves that ended in a duel. On {{the floor of the}} House, Cilley had attacked the integrity of Whig newspaper editor James Watson Webb. Webb demanded a retraction of Cilley's comments through his friend, Congressman Graves. When Cilley refused to receive the communication from Graves, Graves charged that Cilley was questioning Webb's honor and challenged him to a duel. Graves, accompanied by Kentucky Congressman Richard Menefee and Virginia Congressman Richard Wise asked Crittenden to serve as a second for Graves in the duel; Crittenden initially protested, but finally agreed. After two misses by both combatants, Cilley was killed on the third exchange. The House proposed the expulsion of Graves and the censure of the <b>other</b> <b>participants</b> (excluding Crittenden, who was a senator and not subject to House censure). The resolutions of expulsion and censure were eventually tabled, but Crittenden personally felt the sting of what he considered an indirect censure and later regretted his actions.|$|E

5|$|On January 8, 1902, Philip Primrose married Lily Deane (June 3, 1877 – March 15, 1966). She was the {{daughter}} of Superintendent Richard Burton Deane of the North-West Mounted Police. Deane had served with the NWMP during the Riel Rebellion of 1885, tasked with guarding Riel and 50 <b>other</b> <b>participants</b> of the uprising in their prison cells. The Primroses had four children: Phyllis Jessie (1902–1975), Neil (1904–1904), Neil Philip (1905–1991), and Sybil E. (c. 1909–1946). His oldest son, Neil Philip was a lawyer, practicing in Vegreville and Edmonton. After being created a King's Counsel in 1951, Neil served as a Judge with the Supreme Court of Alberta in its Trial Division. One of his grandchildren, John Nairn Primrose won trap shooting championships at the Commonwealth Games in 1974 and 1978 respectively, and, in 1981, was appointed {{as a member of the}} Order of Canada.|$|E
5|$|Reïna-Flor Okori, at age 36, was {{the only}} Equatoguinean female competitor. She had {{previously}} competed at the previous three Summer Games but with the French Olympic team. She was notable for being the flag bearer for the opening and closing ceremonies. Okori qualified for the Games via a wildcard because she had not recorded a qualifying standard time for her event, the women's 100 metres hurdles. She spent time training in Equatorial Guinea and France preparing for the Games. In an interview before the Games Okori said she aimed to reach {{the final stage of}} her event and earn Equatorial Guinea's first Olympic gold medal. She was due to compete in the contest's sixth heat on 16 August alongside seven <b>other</b> <b>participants</b> but was unable to start the event because of a ruptured popliteal cyst.|$|E
5|$|Sometime {{after the}} December 1920 hearing {{requested}} by the ANA, {{the chairman of the}} U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, Charles Moore, became aware of the proposed congressional action, and decided to investigate. Moore, together with Commission member and Buffalo nickel designer James Earle Fraser, met with Mint Director Baker on May 26, 1921, and they agreed that it would be appropriate to hold a design competition for the proposed dollar, {{under the auspices of the}} Commission. This was formalized on July 26 with the Commission's written recommendation to the Mint that a competition, open only to invited sculptors, be used to select designs. The winner of the competition was to receive $1,500 prize money, while all <b>other</b> <b>participants</b> would be given $100. On July 28, President Harding issued Executive Order 3524, requiring that coin designs be submitted to the Commission before approval by the Treasury Secretary. In early September, following the failure of the bill, Baker contacted Moore, putting the matter aside pending congressional action.|$|E
