25|$|On curves the <b>outer</b> <b>rail</b> {{may be at}} {{a higher}} level than the inner rail. This is called {{superelevation}} or cant. This reduces the forces tending to displace the track and makes for a more comfortable ride for standing livestock and standing or seated passengers. A given amount of superelevation is most effective over a limited range of speeds.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1960s Merseyrail {{was being}} {{designed}} with an <b>outer</b> <b>rail</b> loop that circled the city. [...] The proposal {{was to use}} the former Cheshire Lines Committee's North Liverpool Extension Line route through the eastern suburbs of Liverpool and the north south crossrail Northern Line that runs under the city centre to form the complete Outer Loop.|$|E
2500|$|All {{electrical}} equipment was shipped from the US, including power system plant equipment. A power station was {{built at the}} Shore Road pumping station and was designed, anticipating extension of the electrification to the Wirral Railway, although this was not to occur until 1938. The conductor rails were fed direct, without any distribution. Four rail 600V DC electrification was installed, the positive <b>outer</b> <b>rail</b> set [...] from the running rail. The new multiple units had British wooden bodies on US bogies; 24 motor cars and 33 trailer cars were provided and trains were initially 2-car or 4-car sets. The driving positions controlled all the motors on the train by the means of a low voltage control signal.|$|E
50|$|Märklin {{measured}} the gauge as {{the distance between}} the centers of the two <b>outer</b> <b>rails,</b> rather than {{the distance between the}} <b>outer</b> <b>rails</b> themselves. Lionel's standard gauge is allegedly the result of Lionel's misreading these standards, as are the variances in O gauge between the United States and Europe.|$|R
50|$|The Märklin {{system is}} the {{technique}} of using a third rail concealed in the roadbed with only small studs protruding through the ties of the track. The two <b>outer</b> <b>rails</b> are connected electrically. This provides the simplified wiring enjoyed by larger gauges—such as for reverse loops—without seriously detracting from the realism of the track because {{only two of the}} rails are visible. Because the two <b>outer</b> <b>rails</b> are not electrically isolated from each other, however, some do not consider Märklin's system to be a true three-rail system. However, older sections of 'M-Track' do have an actual conductor rail rather than studs. This older system is compatible with newer trains, although the reduced clearance for the pick-up shoe can sometimes cause running difficulties.|$|R
50|$|Although most three-rail systems {{ties the}} two <b>outer</b> <b>rails</b> {{together}} electrically, some manufacturers wire all three rails independently. GarGraves is a North American manufacturer of O gauge three-rail track {{with all of}} its rails insulated. Trix Express is a European manufacturer of three-rail track who insulates all three rails.|$|R
2500|$|Construction started, {{the tunnels}} through central London being {{expanded}} and realigned and the stations lengthened, but it proved impossible to modify Wood Lane station to take 8-car trains {{and a new}} station at White City was authorised in 1938. The line was converted to the London Underground four-rail electrification system in 1940. The positive <b>outer</b> <b>rail</b> is [...] higher than on other lines, because even after reconstruction work the tunnels are slightly smaller. Most of the tunnels for the extensions {{to the east of}} London had been built by 1940, but work slowed due to the outbreak of the Second World War until eventually suspended in June. The unused tunnels between Leytonstone and Newbury Park were equipped by the Plessey Company as an aircraft components factory, opening in March 1942 and employing 2000 people. Elsewhere, people used underground stations as night shelters during air raids. The unopened Bethnal Green station had space for 10,000 people. In March 1943, 173 people died there when a woman entering the shelter fell {{at the bottom of the}} steps and those following fell on top of her.|$|E
60|$|For an instant, Lucy looked incoherently {{from one}} to the other. But both she and Pierre now {{mechanically}} again seized Isabel's frantic arms, as they were again thrown over the <b>outer</b> <b>rail</b> of the boat. They dragged her back; they spoke to her; they soothed her; but though less vehement, Isabel still looked deeply distrustfully at Lucy, and deeply reproachfully at Pierre.|$|E
6000|$|... "He was {{cut down}} by an engine, sir. No man in England knew his work better. But somehow {{he was not}} clear of the <b>outer</b> <b>rail.</b> It was just at broad day. He had struck the light, and had the lamp in his hand. As the engine {{came out of the}} tunnel, his back was towards her, and she cut him down. That man drove her, and was showing how it happened. Show the gentleman, Tom." ...|$|E
50|$|In {{allowing}} railway {{tracks of}} different gauges {{to share the}} same alignment, costs can be reduced, and infrastructure shared, e.g. platforms, bridges and tunnels etc. Dual gauge can replace two separate tracks by sharing one common running rail {{and one of the}} two other <b>outer</b> <b>rails</b> which determine the gauge.|$|R

5000|$|Parts of the [...] gauge track {{were built}} as dual gauge track, with the <b>outer</b> <b>rails</b> gauged to {{standard}} gauge; {{other parts of}} the site were only served by standard gauge track. Some 120 mi of mixed or purely standard gauge track existed by 1918. [...] Some [...] narrow gauge track existed at the site.|$|R
60|$|Higher {{even than}} the most {{gigantic}} wind-wheels hung this crow's nest, a clear thousand feet above the roofs, a little disc-shaped speck on a spear of metallic filigree, cable stayed. To its summit Graham was drawn in a little wire-hung cradle. Halfway down the frail-seeming stem was a light gallery about which hung a cluster of tubes--minute they looked from above--rotating slowly on the ring of its <b>outer</b> <b>rail.</b> These were the specula, en rapport with the wind-vane keeper's mirrors, in one of which Ostrog had shown him the coming of his rule. His Japanese attendant ascended before him and they spent nearly an hour asking and answering questions.|$|E

25|$|The Hartley Road section {{completed}} {{what was}} known the “Boulevard Circle” and circular services commenced 30 July. Cars from Nottingham Road ran round the inner rails (Radford and Lenton) and thence back to Nottingham Road, and the St Ann’s Well Road cars ran round the <b>outer</b> <b>rails</b> (Lenton and Radford), returning to St Ann’s Well Road. Both operated on a six-minute frequency.|$|R
50|$|The {{third rail}} {{has also been}} used to {{automate}} and animate layouts. An accessory, such as a railway signal, can be wired to a section of track that has had one of its <b>outer</b> <b>rails</b> insulated (not grounded), either at the factory or by a hobbyist. A passing train then grounds the insulated rail, completing the circuit and causing the accessory to operate.|$|R
50|$|A key {{advantage}} for three-rail track is reverse loops, {{where a train}} enters a loop through a turnout and then exits through the same turnout in order to change the train's direction. With two-rail track, when the track reverses on itself, this causes a short circuit. With three-rail track, because the center rail remains constant and the <b>outer</b> <b>rails</b> are electrically identical, this causes no problems.|$|R
50|$|The {{maximum value}} of cant (the {{height of the}} <b>outer</b> <b>rail</b> above the inner rail) for a {{standard}} gauge railway is about 150 mm. For high-speed railways in Europe, maximum cant is 180 mm (when slow freight trains are not allowed).|$|E
50|$|In curved track, it {{is usually}} {{designed}} to raise the <b>outer</b> <b>rail,</b> providing a banked turn, thus allowing trains to maneuver through the curve at higher speeds than would otherwise be possible if the surface was flat or level. It also helps a train steer around a curve, keeping the wheel flanges from pressing the rails, minimizing friction and wear. The measurement {{of the difference in}} elevation between the <b>outer</b> <b>rail</b> and the inner rail is called cant in most countries. Sometime the cant is measured in term of angle instead of height difference. In the United States, it is measured in height difference and called crosslevel, even for the curved track.|$|E
50|$|The {{underground}} Mersey Railway {{started an}} electric service on 3 May 1903, electrified by British Westinghouse Electric with equipment from the US. A four-rail DC system was installed, {{with a positive}} <b>outer</b> <b>rail</b> and a negative return rail between the running rails.|$|E
50|$|His work {{influenced}} the future orthopedic practices of Lewis A. Sayre, Charles Fayette Taylor and Edward Hickling Bradford. He {{was a member}} of local medical societies of New York City and was an honorarily elected member of the then newly formed American Orthopedic Association in 1895. In addition, he may have once suggested to railroad engineers to elevate the <b>outer</b> <b>rails</b> of curved sections of rail lines.|$|R
50|$|Early toy trains {{used two}} metal rail tracks like most real trains. However, {{manufacturers}} quickly found that using a center rail for electric {{power and the}} two <b>outer</b> <b>rails</b> for common or ground made electrical contact much more reliable and less prone to short circuits. Three rail contact also negates the need for insulated wheels, an important consideration before plastics became widely available. Most scales and gauges that predate HO scale used three rails for electric operation.|$|R
50|$|After {{departing from}} the loading station, the ride makes a 180-degree turn {{traveling}} {{over the line}} queue and onto the lift hill. After ascending 175 ft, the train enters a short drop and then ascends an additional 15 ft to a maximum height of 190 ft before dropping 215 ft. Each car on the train spins on its own independent axis 360 degrees forward or backward, which is being controlled by the <b>outer</b> <b>rails</b> of the track.|$|R
5000|$|... "This {{accident}} {{was caused by}} failure of Engineman Wescott of train № 33 to be governed by automatic and interlocking signal indications, which resulted in train № 33 taking the diverging route at {{a high rate of}} speed and being derailed due to the <b>outer</b> <b>rail</b> of the curve giving way." ...|$|E
50|$|In 1887, {{the broad}} gauge rollingstock of the Launceston and Western Railway {{consisted}} of 14 passenger carriages, 4 horse boxes and 84 goods vehicles. A proposal {{to take up}} the <b>outer</b> <b>rail</b> was examined and it was decided that greater economy of operation would be achieved. The last broad gauge train ran on 20 August 1888.|$|E
50|$|The West Section - The {{existing}} Merseyrail Electrics Northern Line from Sandhills in {{the north}} (later Aintree on the Ormskirk branch) to Hunts Cross. This section includes the most expensive part of the <b>Outer</b> <b>Rail</b> Loop - the Link Line tunnel under Liverpool city centre - and the reopened and electrified line from Liverpool Central to Hunts Cross.|$|E
50|$|The switch {{consists}} of the pair of linked tapering rails, known as points (switch rails or point blades), lying between the diverging <b>outer</b> <b>rails</b> (the stock rails). These points can be moved laterally into one of two positions to direct a train coming from the point blades toward the straight path or the diverging path. A train moving from the narrow end toward the point blades (i.e. it will be directed {{to one of the}} two paths depending on the position of the points) is said to be executing a facing-point movement.|$|R
50|$|They had one {{peculiarity}} which {{arose from}} their outside frames and counterweights. In {{places where the}} D&RG's standard gauge system met the narrow gauge system, the railroad operated dual gauge trackage, with three rails, so that standard gauge equipment ran on the <b>outer</b> two <b>rails</b> and three foot gauge equipment ran {{on one of the}} <b>outer</b> <b>rails</b> and a third rail, inside the other two. Since the narrow gauge equipment was much lighter than the standard gauge, the inner rail was generally lighter and, therefore, not as tall as the standard gauge rails. In the case of the D&RGW, the difference was ⅞ inch (22 mm). Because the counterweights were outside the frames, they ended up directly over the standard gauge rail, with a clearance of only about ⅝ inch (16 mm). When the shop crews trued up the drivers periodically, they had to be very careful not to go too far.|$|R
25|$|The Underground uses a {{relatively}} uncommon four rail system of electrification. Two standard gauge rails are the running rails; the <b>outer</b> third <b>rail</b> carries positive current at +420VDC {{and the inner}} fourth rail is the negative return at –210VDC, giving a supply voltage of 630VDC.|$|R

50|$|Although {{powers were}} {{obtained}} {{to build this}} line under the 1975 Merseyside Metropolitan Railway Act, construction was postponed due to the financial cutbacks and political opposition that also halted the <b>Outer</b> <b>Rail</b> Loop project. The east of Liverpool has suffered in many aspects ever since. An {{attempt was made to}} revive the project in the mid-1980s but it was found to be not financially viable.|$|E
50|$|In 1906, the Lionel {{electric}} trains {{became the}} first model trains to use a third rail to power the locomotive. Lionel track uses a third rail in the center, while the two <b>outer</b> <b>rails</b> are electrically connected together. This solved the problem two-rail model trains have when the track is arranged to loop back on itself, as ordinarily this causes a short-circuit. (Even if the loop was gapped, the locomotive would create a short and stop as it crossed the gaps.) Lionel electric trains also operate on alternating current. The use of alternating current means that a Lionel locomotive cannot be reversed by changing polarity; instead, the locomotive sequences among several states (forward, neutral, backward, for example) each time it is started.|$|R
50|$|The Sd.Kfz. 11/2 was a {{chemical}} decontamination vehicle {{fitted with a}} 70 kg capacity spreader and space for eight barrels of decontamination chemicals. This left room for only three crewmen. The barrels were stowed on platforms over the tracks with foldable <b>outer</b> <b>rails.</b> According to a reliable report the medium vehicle carries 760 kg of bleach; a strip 1.7 m wide and 1.4 kilometers (just over a mile) long can be decontaminated by using a density of 300 g of bleach per square meter. The density at which the vehicle distributes decontaminant is independent of the vehicle speed, the maximum potential density is 600 g per square meter. In addition to this, each vehicle carries 16 decontamination canisters, each holding 22 lb of decontaminant, for use by hand on isolated areas.|$|R
2500|$|Lionel's {{earliest}} trains were {{larger than}} the sizes commonly available today, running on two-rail tracks with the rails 2inches apart. In 1906, Lionel began offering a three-rail track that simplified wiring of reverse loops and accessories. Its <b>outer</b> <b>rails</b> were 2inches apart, which did not match any of the existing standards that other manufacturers had been using since 1891. Whether this was an accidental misreading of Märklin's 2 gauge specifications or an intentional incompatibility is unclear, but Lionel marketed this non-standard track as [...] "The Standard of the World," [...] and soon adopted the name in its catalogs as Standard Gauge and trademarked the name. When other U.S. companies began using Lionel's standard, they usually called it wide gauge. Starting in 1915, Lionel followed most of its U.S. competitors and adopted the smaller O gauge standard for its budget-level trains.|$|R
