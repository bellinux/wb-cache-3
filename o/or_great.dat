5|$|Aristotle, {{and nearly}} all Western {{scholars}} after him until the 18th century, believed that creatures were arranged in a graded scale of perfection rising from plants on up to humans: the scala naturae <b>or</b> <b>Great</b> Chain of Being. Aristotle's successor at the Lyceum, Theophrastus, wrote a series of books on botany—the History of Plants—which survived {{as the most important}} contribution of antiquity to botany, even into the Middle Ages. Many of Theophrastus' names survive into modern times, such as carpos for fruit, and pericarpion for seed vessel. Dioscorides wrote a pioneering and encyclopaedic pharmacopoeia, De Materia Medica, incorporating descriptions of some 600 plants and their uses in medicine.

40|$|AbstractPurpose: The Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study (ACAS) {{showed that}} carotid endarterectomy reduces stroke risk in symptom-free {{patients}} with 60 % <b>or</b> <b>greater</b> {{internal carotid artery}} (ICA) stenosis. This will surely lead {{to the performance of}} an increased number of screening duplex examinations. Assuming that positive study results will lead to arteriography or endarterectomy and keeping in mind the modest benefit for prophylactic endarterectomy demonstrated by ACAS (absolute risk reduction for ipsilateral stroke of 5. 8 % at 5 years), duplex criteria for 60 % <b>or</b> <b>greater</b> ICA stenosis must have high positive predictive values (PPV). Determining criteria for 60 % <b>or</b> <b>greater</b> stenosis, which emphasized high accuracy and PPV, forms the basis for this study. Methods: Stenoses detected by angiography in 352 ICAs were blindly compared with those detected by duplex scanning. Duplex criteria were determined for highest overall accuracy in detection of 60 % <b>or</b> <b>greater</b> ICA stenosis and for 95 % <b>or</b> <b>greater</b> PPV. Results: Maximal accuracy for detection of 60 % <b>or</b> <b>greater</b> stenosis was 90 %. This was achieved by the combination of a peak systolic velocity of 260 cm/sec <b>or</b> <b>greater</b> and an end diastolic velocity of 70 cm/sec <b>or</b> <b>greater</b> (sensitivity 84 %, specificity 94 %, PPV 92 %). The 95 % PPV for 60 % <b>or</b> <b>greater</b> stenosis results from combining peak systolic velocity of 290 cm/sec <b>or</b> <b>greater</b> and end diastolic velocity of 80 cm/sec <b>or</b> <b>greater.</b> Conclusions: With use of these criteria duplex scanning accurately detects with high PPVs the threshold level of ICA stenosis defined in ACAS as receiving stroke reduction benefit from prophylactic carotid endarterectomy. These criteria should be useful for carotid artery screening and minimizing unneeded intervention. (J VASC SURG 1995; 21 : 989 - 94. ...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{aim of this}} {{retrospective}} {{study was to determine}} optimal duplex sonographic criteria for use in our institution for diagnosing severe carotid stenoses and to correlate those findings with angiographic measurements obtained by the European Carotid Surgery Trial (ECST), North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET), and Common Carotid (CC) methods of grading carotid stenoses. METHODS: We analyzed the angiographic data using the ECST, NASCET, and CC methods and compared the results with the duplex sonographic findings. We then calculated the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy of the duplex sonographic method. Taking these parameters into account, the optimal intrastenotic peak systolic velocity (PSV) and end diastolic velocity (EDV) were derived for diagnosing severe stenoses according to the 3 angiographic methods. RESULTS: Optimal PSV and EDV values for diagnosing a 70 % <b>or</b> <b>greater</b> stenosis in our laboratory were as follows: with the NASCET method of angiographic grading of stenoses, PSV 220 cm/second <b>or</b> <b>greater</b> and EDV 80 cm/second <b>or</b> <b>greater,</b> and with the ECST and CC methods, PSV 190 cm/second <b>or</b> <b>greater,</b> and EDV 65 cm/second <b>or</b> <b>greater.</b> The optimal PSV and EDV for diagnosing a stenosis of 80 % <b>or</b> <b>greater</b> with the ECST grading method were 215 cm/second <b>or</b> <b>greater</b> and 90 cm/second <b>or</b> <b>greater,</b> respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Duplex sonography is a sensitive and accurate tool for evaluating severe carotid stenoses. Optimal PSVs and EDVs vary according to the angiographic method used to grade the stenosis. They are similar for stenoses 70 % <b>or</b> <b>greater</b> with the NASCET method and for stenoses 80 % <b>or</b> <b>greater</b> with the ECST method...|$|R

It is thought to originate from an amphidiploid hybrid of D. rotundifolia and D. linearis, meaning that a sterile hybrid between these two species doubled its chromosomes to produce fertile progeny which stabilized into the current D. anglica.|$|E

His system had eleven grades, arranged according to the potentiality of each being, expressed in their form at birth. The highest animals gave birth to warm and wet creatures alive, the lowest bore theirs cold, dry, and in thick eggs. The system was based on Aristotle's interpretation of the four elements in his On Generation and Corruption: Fire (hot and dry); Air (hot and wet); Water (cold and wet); and Earth (cold and dry). These are arranged from the most energetic to the least, so the warm, wet young raised in a womb with a placenta were higher on the scale than the cold, dry, nearly mineral eggs of birds. However, Aristotle is careful never to insist that a group fits perfectly in the scale; he knows animals have many combinations of attributes, and that placements are approximate.|$|E
