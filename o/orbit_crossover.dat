40|$|We derive {{models for}} the global shape and {{topography}} of Mercury from limb images obtained by the MESSENGER spacecraft during flybys and from <b>orbit.</b> <b>Crossover</b> heights of 225 individual limb profiles were adjusted by least-squares techniques to establish a rigid global topographic network. Mercury is confirmed to possess an equatorial ellipticity and a polar oblateness. Several large impact basins and craters can be identified in the topographic model, including one basin that was earlier proposed but unconfirmed. Comparisons with absolute height data from laser altimetry indicate that the limb model appears to overestimate planetary radius by ~ 900 m on average. Limb profiles and local digital terrain models derived from stereo-photogrammetry show good agreement...|$|E
30|$|In {{the paper}} at hand the {{integral}} method {{used to determine}} Swarm Level- 2 FAC is explained in detail, contrary to Ritter and Lühr (2006) {{that focused on the}} description of the curl-B method. The integral method was selected above the curl-B solution, because the requirements concerning the geometry of the four measurement points needed for the calculation of the current density is less stringent. The integration area spanned by the quad points doesn’t necessarily need to be rectangular, while the two components of spatial derivatives in the curl-B approach have to be orthogonal. The integral method also avoids a division by vanishing cross-track horizontal distances near the <b>orbit</b> <b>crossover</b> points. In the curl-B technique with its horizontal gradients this might lead to unrealistically high current density values in this region.|$|E
30|$|For the {{estimation}} of the radial current density a regular quad of measurement points is most suitable. The proper choice of these quads is vital {{for the quality of}} the current density. The distance of the quad points in along-track direction should be comparable, at least in the most interesting regions, with the longitudinal separation, dy, of the orbits. This separation is ~ 150 km at the equator, decreasing at high latitudes and it vanishes near the geographic poles (dy ~ 150 km cos (lat)). Hence the time between along-track quad points was chosen 5 sec corresponding to ~ 40 km. To avoid collision at the <b>orbit</b> <b>crossovers,</b> the satellites pass the equator with a time separation of 5 – 10 s. This time separation Δt is taken into account when selecting the readings of symmetric quad points.|$|R
50|$|Dickins {{oversaw the}} {{building}} of a classical record division, with a full repertoire of major works by such established names as Nikolaus Harnoncourt, Daniel Barenboim and José Carreras. He was also the guiding force in the William <b>Orbit</b> classical <b>crossover</b> album, Pieces in a Modern Style. There was major cross-over success with Górecki's Third Symphony, The Three Tenors in Los Angeles, and Agnus Dei (The Choir of New College, Oxford).|$|R
40|$|A {{new model}} is {{provided}} for estimating maritime near-surface wind speeds (U 10) from satellite altimeter backscatter data during high wind conditions. The model is built using coincident satellite scatterometer and altimeter observations obtained from QuikSCAT and Jason satellite <b>orbit</b> <b>crossovers</b> in 2008 and 2009. The new wind measurements are linear with inverse radar backscatter levels, a result {{close to the}} earlier altimeter high wind speed model of Young (1993). By design, the model only applies for wind speeds above 18 m s− 1. Above this level, standard altimeter wind speed algorithms are not reliable and typically underestimate the true value. Simple rules for applying the new model to the present-day suite of satellite altimeters (Jason- 1, Jason- 2, and Envisat RA- 2) are provided, with a key objective being provision of enhanced data for near-real-time forecast and warning applications surrounding gale to hurricane force wind events. Model limitations and strengths are discussed and highlight the valuable 5 -km spatial resolution sea state and wind speed altimeter information that can complement other data sources included in forecast guidance and air–sea interaction studies...|$|R
40|$|OAPA NASA's Ice, Cloud, {{and land}} Elevation Satellite (ICESat), which {{operated}} between 2003 and 2009, {{made the first}} satellite-based global lidar measurement of earth's ice sheet elevations, sea-ice thickness, and vegetation canopy structure. The primary instrument on ICESat was the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS), which measured {{the distance from the}} spacecraft to the earth's surface via the roundtrip travel time of individual laser pulses. GLAS utilized pulsed lasers and a direct detection receiver consisting of a silicon avalanche photodiode and a waveform digitizer. Early in the mission, the peak power of the received signal from snow and ice surfaces was found to span a wider dynamic range than anticipated, often exceeding the linear dynamic range of the GLAS 1064 -nm detector assembly. The resulting saturation of the receiver distorted the recorded signal and resulted in range biases as large as $~ $ 50 cm for ice- and snow-covered surfaces. We developed a correction for this ''saturation range bias'' based on laboratory tests using a spare flight detector, and refined the correction by comparing GLAS elevation estimates with those derived from Global Positioning System surveys over the calibration site at the salar de Uyuni, Bolivia. Applying the saturation correction largely eliminated the range bias due to receiver saturation for affected ICESat measurements over Uyuni and significantly reduced the discrepancies at <b>orbit</b> <b>crossovers</b> located on flat regions of the Antarctic ice sheet...|$|R
40|$|The work {{described}} in this thesis concerns the application of radar altimetry, collected from the ERS- 1 and TOPEX/POSEIDON missions, to precise satellite orbits computed at Aston University. The data is analysed in a long arc fashion to determine range biases, time tag biases, sea surface topographies and to assess the radial accuracy of the generated <b>orbits</b> through <b>crossover</b> analysis. A sea surface variability study is carried out for the North Sea using repeat altimeter profiles from ERS- 1 and TOPEX/POSEIDON in order to verify two local U. K. models for ocean tide and storm surge effects. An on-side technique over the English Channel is performed to compute the ERS- 1, TOPEX and POSEIDON altimeter range biases by {{using a combination of}} altimetry, precise orbits determined by short arc methods, tide gauge data, GPS measurements, geoid, ocean tide and storm surge models. The remaining part of the thesis presents some techniques for the short arc correction of long arc orbits. Validation of this model is achieved by way of comparison with actual SEASAT short arcs. Simulations are performed for the ERS- 1 microwave tracking system, PRARE, using the range data to determine time dependent orbit corrections. Finally, a brief chapter is devoted to the recovery of errors in station coordinates by the use of multiple short arcs...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} the {{stationary}} dynamics in classical Sinai billiard (SB) corresponding to the unit cell of the periodic Lorentz gas (LG) formed by square lattice of length L and dispersing circles of radius R placed {{in the center of}} unit cell. Dynamic correlation effects for classical particles, initially distributed by random way, are considered within the scope of deterministic and stochastic descriptions. A temporal analysis of elastic reflections from the SB square walls and circle obstacles is given for distinct geometries in terms of the wall-collision and the circle-collision distributions. Late-time steady dynamic regimes are explicit in the diffusion exponent z(R), which plays a role of the order-disorder crossover dynamical parameter. The ballistic (z 0 = 1) ordered motion in the square lattice (R = 0) switches to the superdiffusion regime with z 1 = 1. 5, which is geometry-independent when R < L √ 2 / 4. This observed universal dynamics is shown to arise from long-distance particle jumps along the diagonal and nondiagonal Bleher cor- 1 ridors in the LG with the infinite horizon geometry. In the corresponding SB, this universal regime is caused by the long-time wall-collision memory effects attributed to the bouncing-ball <b>orbits.</b> The <b>crossover</b> nonuniversal behavior with 1. 5 < z < 2 is due to geometry with L √ 2 / 4 ≤ R < L/ 2, when only the nondiagonal corridors remain open. All the free-motion corridors are closed in LG with finite horizon (R ≥ L/ 2) and the interplay between square and circle geometries results in the chaotic dynamics ensured by the normal Brownian diffusion (z 2 = 2) and by the normal Gaussian distribution of collisions.
