5|$|Restoring the {{primitive}} scene {{is not done}} easily nor can it be done completely. Some species are extinct. Given time, an eastern hardwood forest can be regrown to maturity but the chestnut will be missing and so will the roar of pigeon wings. The colorful drapanid finches {{are not to be}} heard again in the lowland forests of Hawaii, nor will the jack-hammer of the ivory-bill ring in southern swamps. The wolf and grizzly bear cannot readily be reintroduced into ranching communities, and the factor of human use of the parks is subject only to regulation, not elimination. Exotic plants, animals, and diseases are here to stay. All these limitations we fully realize. Yet, if the goal cannot be fully achieved it can be approached. A reasonable illusion of primitive America could be recreated, using the utmost in skill, judgment, and ecologic sensitivity. This in <b>our</b> <b>opinion</b> should be the objective of every national park and monument.|$|E

25|$|One {{interpretation}} {{follows the}} insights of the renowned Augustinian scholar, Fr. Fulbert Cayré (1884–1971), who holds to an Augustinian definition of the charism: the Assumption was born of Augustinian inspiration as evidenced, among other things, by its name, its rule, the institute it founded (Les Etudes augustiniennes), the number of references to St. Augustine in the founder’s writings (he once wrote that the City of God should be for the Assumption “a kind of second revelation”), and the many Assumptionist authors in the Augustinian tradition (Cayré, Edgar Bourque, Marcel Neusch, Goulven Madec, Ernest Fortin, George Folliet, Rémi Munsch, etc.). This interpretation, strongly founded on the facts, bears witness to the debt Assumption owes to Augustine. Still, in <b>our</b> <b>opinion,</b> Augustine remains second to d’Alzon himself.|$|E

The agency requested that Shulgin turn over his license for violating the license's terms, and he was fined $25,000 for possession of anonymous samples sent to him for quality testing. In the 15 years preceding the publication of PIHKAL, two announced and scheduled reviews failed to find any irregularities. Richard Meyer, spokesman for DEA's San Francisco Field Division, has stated that, [...] "It is <b>our</b> <b>opinion</b> that those books are pretty much cookbooks on how to make illegal drugs.

In addition to baseball writers, a number of other figures made their views on the topic known, including football broadcasters Troy Aikman and Terry Bradshaw, basketball reporter Stephen A.

The public figure doctrine was thus expressly rejected by the Court. Thean J. said: [...] "Such criticisms or attacks must, in <b>our</b> <b>opinion,</b> respect the bounds set by the law of defamation, and we do not accept that the publication of false and defamatory allegations, {{even in the absence of}} actual malice on the part of the publisher, should be allowed to pass with impunity." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{negotiations}} {{on the future of}} Rhodesia Douglas-Home was less successful. He was instrumental in persuading the rebel leader, Ian Smith, to accept proposals for a transition to African majority rule. Douglas-Home set up an independent commission chaired by a senior British judge, Lord Pearce, to investigate how acceptable the proposals were to majority opinion in Rhodesia. After extensive fieldwork throughout Rhodesia, the commission reported, [...] "We are satisfied on our evidence that the proposals are acceptable to the great majority of Europeans. We are equally satisfied... that the majority of Africans rejected the proposals. In <b>our</b> <b>opinion</b> the people of Rhodesia as a whole do not regard the proposals as acceptable as a basis for independence." [...] To Douglas-Home's disappointment there was no resolution, and Rhodesia remained a rebel regime long after he left office.|$|E
500|$|The Naval Chronicle declared: We cannot {{sufficiently}} express <b>our</b> <b>opinion</b> of the coolness, intrepidity, and skill, {{with which}} the Commander of this Fleet, unaccustomed as he was {{to the practice of}} naval engagements, provided against every emergency, and prepared his plans, either for attack or defence, as the manoeuvres of the French Admiral might render it expedient for him to adopt either the one of the other. His conduct was worthy of the experience and science of our most approved and veteran Admirals, while the ardour and promptitude with which his orders were obeyed and his plans executed by the several Captains under his command, may have been rivalled, but can scarcely be exceeded in the most renowned of our naval exploits. Dance received £5,000 from the Bombay Insurance Company (approximately £338,000 in present-day terms), a pension of £500 a year (approximately £34,000 a year in present-day terms), plate worth 200 guineas from the Honourable East India Company, a ceremonial sword worth £100, and a silver vase.|$|E

500|$|During {{the play}} on Monday, a short ball from Larwood {{fractured}} Bert Oldfield's skull, although Bodyline tactics {{were not being}} used at the time. The Australian Board of Control contacted the MCC managers Warner and Palairet asking them to arrange for the team to cease the use of Bodyline, but they replied the captain was solely {{in charge of the}} playing side of the tour. On the Wednesday of the game, the Australian Board sent a cable to the MCC which stated [...] "Bodyline bowling has assumed such proportions as to menace {{the best interests of the}} game, making protection of the body by the batsman the main consideration. This is causing intensely bitter feeling between the players, as well as injury. In <b>our</b> <b>opinion</b> it is unsportsmanlike.

[...] After England's victory in the match, Jardine went to the Australian dressing room but had the door closed in his face. Speaking to his team, Jardine offered to end the use of the tactics if the players opposed them, but they unanimously voted to continue. The report in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack stated it was probably the most unpleasant match ever played.|$|E
500|$|John Aikin, in {{a review}} for the April 1796 Monthly Review, claimed, [...] "We were sorry to observer, {{in the preface to}} this work, certain facts stated in order to display the extreme rapidity with which it was written.

Is it possible that a person of classical education have so slight an opinion of (perhaps) the most arduous effort of human invention, as to suffer the fervour and confidence of youth to hurry him in such a manner through a design which may fix the reputation of a whole life?" [...] The review continued: [...] "To proceed to the execution of the design: we do not hesitate to declare <b>our</b> <b>opinion</b> that the poetical powers displayed in it are of a very superior kind, and such as, if not wasted in premature and negligent exertions, promise a rich harvest of future excellence. Conceptions more lofty and daring, sentiments more commanding, and language more energetic than some of the best passages in this poem afford, will not easily be found:—nor does scarcely any part of it sink to languor; as the glow of feeling and genius animates the whole." ...|$|E
500|$|In May 1955 Khrushchev led a Soviet {{delegation}} to the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade {{with the aim of}} rehabilitating Tito, a move which encouraged reformist and dissident trends in Eastern Europe. The Albanian government had received a letter two days before the Soviet delegation was to leave Moscow: in it, the Soviets requested that the Albanians approve a statement drawn up by Khrushchev {{in the name of the}} Information Bureau even though he had not convened it. The move was refused by the Albanians [...] "on the grounds that there had been no change in the line of the Yugoslav leadership since it had been condemned by the 1948 resolution of communist and workers' parties represented on the Bureau." [...] On May 25 the Central Committee of the Party of Labour sent a letter to its Soviet counterpart stating among other things that, [...] "In <b>our</b> <b>opinion</b> such a hasty (and ill-considered) decision on an issue of great importance and of principle" [...] was conducted [...] "without first making a profound analysis together with all the parties interested in this issue." [...] With only Albania among the Eastern Bloc states opposing Khrushchev's move, the Soviets succeeded in unilaterally rehabilitating Tito's standing within the international communist movement and apologized for past Soviet activities in relation to Yugoslavia.|$|E

500|$|A major {{sticking}} point over NHL participation {{has been the}} insurance of players; for the 2014 Winter Olympics, the IOC paid around US$7 million to insure NHL players participating in the Games. In April 2016, the IOC announced that beginning in 2018, {{it would no longer}} cover accommodations, insurance, or travel for NHL players in the Olympics, prompting the IIHF to ask for support from national ice hockey associations and National Olympic Committees to help cover costs; Matti Nurminen of the Finnish Ice Hockey Association argued that it was the responsibility of the event's organizer to cover costs, and that [...] "In <b>our</b> <b>opinion,</b> the same party should pay the bills, and that’s not us. All the countries replied to the IIHF that they are not willing to pay for the insurance or the travel {{or any of the other}} expenses that are related to having the NHL players participate in Pyeongchang." [...] The New York Times felt that the removal of this financial support would put NHL participation at Pyeongchang in jeopardy, noting the already-strenuous relationship between the NHL and the IOC; Gary Bettman noted that the NHL does not profit from their presence, adding that [...] "in fact, we kind of disappear for two weeks because historically the IOC hasn't even let us join in promoting our participation in the Olympics." ...|$|E
500|$|The Great Hall is {{the central}} part of Bramall Hall. As with typical great halls in the Middle Ages, this would have been the room where the {{business}} of the house, estate and its villagers was conducted as well as a communal eating room for the household. It was originally an open-roofed, single-storey building, with a fireplace situated {{in the middle of the}} floor. It was probably first built around the end of the 14th century when the Davenports became lords of the manor. Towards the end of the 16th century, the Great Hall was substantially rebuilt, and the Withdrawing Room was created above it. A long gallery was also added as a third storey. The history of the gallery is uncertain; it was intact in 1790 but was taken down before 1819, because it was believed to be unsafe. A similar gallery was built at Little Moreton Hall, and it is still intact, causing the lower storeys to buckle under the weight. The Great Hall has a bay window with leaded windows, common throughout the building. William Harrison Ainsworth wrote about a right of way through the Great Hall, in his 1834 novel Rookwood. He described how a traveller could pass through the Great Hall, and be entertained and sometimes refreshed. He described Bramall as [...] " [...] best specimen of its class... its class, in <b>our</b> <b>opinion,</b> is the best... to be met with in Cheshire". No evidence exists for any such right of way. According to another tale, food from the buttery hatch was given to the poor who congregated outside.|$|E
