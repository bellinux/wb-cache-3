5|$|A Deshasthas {{marriage}} ceremony includes many elements <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>traditional</b> Marathi Hindu wedding ceremony. It consists of seemant poojan on the wedding eve. The dharmic wedding includes the antarpat ceremony {{followed by the}} vedic ceremony which involves the bridegroom and the bride walking around the sacred fire seven times to complete the marriage. Modern urban wedding ceremonies conclude with an evening reception. A Deshastha woman becomes part of her husband's family after marriage and adopts the gotra {{as well as the}} traditions of her husband's family.|$|E

5|$|A nearby {{mountain}} {{was named}} Jabal ad-Dik ("Mount of the Rooster") because <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>traditional</b> story. According to the tradition, a Jew {{that lived in}} Jifna had visited Jerusalem during the Passion. Seeing Jesus rise from the dead, the man immediately converted and told his wife what he saw. His wife refused to believe him unless the rooster she had just killed {{would come back to}} life. Instantly, the rooster flew away towards the mountain. The story was recited in some monasteries on Holy Thursday together with other biblical readings.|$|E
5|$|Around the mid-1980s, German and Japanese representatives {{decided to}} rebuild the old Japanese embassy in Berlin from 1938. Its remains had {{remained}} unused after the building was largely destroyed during World War II. In addition to the original complex, several changes and additions were made until 2000, like moving the main entrance to the Hiroshima Street, which was named in honour of the Japanese city, and the creation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>traditional</b> Japanese Garden.|$|E
5|$|Banton {{was already}} {{inhabited}} during pre-colonial times as proven by ancient artefacts such as wooden coffins and skeletal remains {{found in the}} island's caves in 1936 {{by a team of}} researchers from the National Museum of the Philippines. Among the artefacts was the Banton Cloth, a piece <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>traditional</b> burial cloth found in one of the wooden coffins. It is estimated to be 400 years old, making it the earliest known warp ikat (tie-resist dyeing) textile in the Philippines and Southeast Asia. These artifacts are now preserved at the National Museum of Anthropology in Manila.|$|E

5|$|Gameplay is turn-based, {{with each}} team moving in sequence, which is {{determined}} randomly, across two-dimensional terrain. During a single turn, a team can only move {{one of their}} worms (unless an item that allows the team to select their worm is used). Worms can walk and jump, as well as (when the proper items are available) swing by rope, parachute, teleport, and bungee. The objective <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>traditional</b> match is to defeat all opposing teams by killing their worms, although in the campaign some missions have other objectives such as collecting a specific crate.|$|E
5|$|More <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>traditional</b> rivalry due to {{the large}} amount of Kiwi internationals Melbourne has fielded in their history. Matches between the two clubs are {{normally}} close and low scoring, with the overall head to head (as of 2016) slightly in Melbourne's favour (37 clashes, Storm 19-Warriors 16 & 2 draws). These two sides played an annual ANZAC Day clash each year between 2009–2014. For 2015 it was played earlier in April before moving back to ANZAC Day for 2016.|$|E
5|$|Nativity scenes {{have not}} escaped controversy. A life-sized {{scene in the}} United Kingdom {{featuring}} waxworks celebrities provoked outrage in 2004, and, in Spain, a city council forbade the exhibition <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>traditional</b> toilet humor character in a public nativity scene. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) indicates that animals in living displays lack proper care and suffer abuse. In the United States, nativity scenes on public lands and in public buildings have provoked court challenges, and the prankish theft of ceramic or plastic nativity figurines from outdoor displays has become commonplace.|$|E

5|$|The film's {{plot was}} {{inspired}} by a similar incident in which Johnson discovered a gun and a bone in his backyard. Instead <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>traditional</b> script, he and Swanberg wrote an outline that summarized the plot but included no dialogue. They cast the film mainly by contacting their friends and other actors who they knew had enjoyed their previous work. It was filmed over 15 days in Los Angeles County, California. Swanberg dedicated the film to filmmaker Paul Mazursky.|$|E

On July 11, 2005, the show premiered in its new studio, NEP Studio 52, at 733 11th Avenue, a few blocks west of its former location.|$|E

5|$|The {{success of}} the film led to a proposed, but unrealized, American dramedy series that was in {{contention}} to air for the 2007–08 television season on Fox. It was to be produced by Fox Television Studios, with the premise adjusted for the confines <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>traditional</b> half-hour or one-hour dramedy with a single camera set-up. However, it never reached the point of even producing a pilot episode.|$|E
5|$|Despite being a {{continuous}} oval bowl, {{each side of}} the stadium is named in the manner <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>traditional</b> football ground. All sides were initially named by compass direction (North Stand and South Stand for the ends, East Stand and West Stand for the sides). In February 2004, after a vote by fans, the West Stand was renamed the Colin Bell Stand in honour of the former player. The vote was almost cancelled (and the stand instead named after Joe Mercer) due to suspicions it had been hijacked by rival fans who wished to dub the renamed stand The Bell End. However, core supporters of the club made it clear they still wished the stand named after their hero. The East Stand is unofficially known by fans as the Kippax as a tribute to the very vocal east stand at the club's Maine Road ground.|$|E
5|$|In large cities, a {{majority}} of working people and students eat their lunch at a corporate or school cafeteria, which normally serve complete meals as described above; it is not usual for students to bring their own lunch food. For companies that do not operate a cafeteria, it is mandatory for white-collar workers to be given lunch vouchers {{as part of their}} employee benefits. These can be used in most restaurants, supermarkets and traiteurs; however, workers having lunch in this way typically do not eat all three dishes <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>traditional</b> lunch due to price and time constraints. In smaller cities and towns, some working people leave their workplaces to return home for lunch. Also, an alternative, especially among blue-collar workers, eating sandwiches followed with a dessert; both dishes can be found ready-made at bakeries and supermarkets for budget prices.|$|E

5|$|In the {{tradition}} of many of her royal Merina predecessors, the queen ruled from the royal Rova compound in Antananarivo. Between 1839 and 1842, Jean Laborde built the queen a new residence called Manjakamiadana, which became the largest structure on the Rova grounds. The residence was made entirely from wood and bore most of the features <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>traditional</b> home of the Merina andriana (aristocratic class), including a central pillar (andry) to support the roof. In other ways it showcased distinctly European innovations, as it contained three floors entirely surrounded by wooden verandas and incorporated dormers in the shingled roof. The palace would eventually be encased in stone in 1867 by James Cameron of the London Missionary Society {{during the reign of}} Ranavalona II. The original wooden palace of Ranavalona and virtually all other structures of the historic Rova compound were destroyed in a 1995 fire, leaving only the stone shell to mark where her palace had once stood.|$|E
5|$|Jan Smuts {{was born}} in 1870, the second son <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>traditional</b> Boer farming family. By rural tradition, the eldest son {{would be the only}} child to receive a full formal {{education}}; however, on the death of his elder brother in 1882, 12-year-old Jan was sent to school for the first time. After four years of education he had made exceptional progress, gaining admission to study at Victoria College in Stellenbosch. He graduated in 1891 with first-class honours in Literature and Science. With this strong academic background, he applied for, and won, the Ebden scholarship for overseas study, electing to read Law at Christ's College, Cambridge. After further academic success, and the recipient of many prestigious academic awards, he graduated in 1894 with double First-class honours. After graduating, Smuts passed the examinations for the Inns of Court, entering the Middle Temple. In 1895, despite the prospect of a bright future in the United Kingdom, the homesick Smuts returned to South Africa.|$|E
5|$|Lydford Castle {{does not}} seem to be {{primarily}} designed to have a military function, although in 1199 when King John succeeded to the throne he had the castle garrisoned and expensively equipped to prevent any potential unrest breaking out in the region. The castle lacked the usual military features of the time, such as external gatehouses, and its design seems to have been intended to evoke the authority <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>traditional</b> defensive fortification rather than to resist an actual attack. Instead, as well as helping to deal with the wider problems in 1195, the castle appears to have been built with the intention of enforcing the stannary and forest law in Devon. It is possible that the Crown originally intended that the castle took over the stannary law across the whole of Cornwall and Devon, although in practice its role extended only to governing the Devon stannaries.|$|E
