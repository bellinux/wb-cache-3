5|$|A set of {{elements}} under two binary <b>operations,</b> + and −, {{is called a}} Euclidean domain if it forms a commutative ring R and, roughly speaking, if a generalized Euclidean algorithm can be performed on them. The two <b>operations</b> of such a ring need not be the addition and multiplication of ordinary arithmetic; rather, they can be more general, such as the <b>operations</b> of a mathematical group or monoid. Nevertheless, these general <b>operations</b> should respect many of the laws governing ordinary arithmetic, such as commutativity, associativity and distributivity.|$|E

The battalion commenced <b>operations</b> in late June 1965 and initially focussed on defeating the Viet Cong's wet season offensive. During this time US 173rd Brigade, including 1 RAR, conducted a number of <b>operations</b> into War Zone D—a major communist base area at the junction of Phuoc Long, Long Khanh, Bien Hoa and Binh Duong provinces—as {{well as in the}} Iron Triangle in November.|$|E

5|$|Continuous U.S. {{air support}} for Barrel Roll <b>operations</b> was {{provided}} by the aircraft of the 602nd and 606th Special <b>Operations</b> Squadrons, elements of the 56th Air Commando Wing (as of 8 April 1967 the 56th Special <b>Operations</b> Wing), based at Nakhon Phanom Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand. On 25 October 1967, they were joined by the 22nd Special <b>Operations</b> Squadron. Pre-planned airstrikes in the Barrel Roll area were rare. Until 1968, most U.S. jet fighter-bomber sorties only occurred when aircraft were returning to Thailand from Rolling Thunder missions carrying unexpended ordnance loads. They would then be directed to targets in northeastern Laos.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the rapid}} pace of <b>operations,</b> deployment, and redeployment, {{coordination}} of artillery units and their fires became a worrisome quandary during the <b>operations.</b> This was made even more problematic by the confusion generated {{by the lack of}} adequate communications systems between the rapidly advancing units. The joint nature of the operation added another level of complexity to the already overstretched communications network. Regardless, due to the ability of U.S. logisticians to innovate and improvise, supplies of food, water, ammunition, and spare parts arrived at their destinations without any shortages hampering combat <b>operations</b> and the communications system, although complicated, functioned well enough during the short duration of U.S. <b>operations.</b>|$|E

5|$|In November 1940 Air Marshal Sholto Douglas became Air Officer Commanding (AOC) RAF Fighter Command. On 8 December 1940 a {{directive}} from the Air Staff called for Sector Offensive Sweeps. It ordered hit-and-run <b>operations</b> over Belgium and France. The <b>operations</b> {{were to be}} conducted by three squadrons to harass German air defences. On 10 January 1941 Circus attacks were initiated by sending small bomber formations protected by large numbers of fighters. The escalation of offensive <b>operations</b> throughout 1941 was designed to draw up the Luftwaffe as Douglas' Command took an increasingly offensive stance. These <b>operations</b> {{became known as the}} Circus offensive. Trafford Leigh-Mallory, AOC 11 Group, penned <b>Operations</b> Instruction No. 7, which he had written on 16 February. Leigh-Mallory outlined six distinct <b>operations</b> for day fighters: Ramrod (bomber escort with primary goal the destruction of the target); Fighter Ramrod (The same goal where fighters escorted ground-attack fighters); Roadstead (Bomber escort and anti-shipping operations); Fighter Roadstead (the same operation as Roadstead but without bombers) along with Rhubarb (poor weather ground attack operation) and Circus <b>operations</b> (see glossary).|$|E
