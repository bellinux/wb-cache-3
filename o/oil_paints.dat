25|$|Giovanni Bellini (c. 1430 – 26 November 1516) was an Italian Renaissance painter, {{probably}} {{the best known of}} the Bellini family of Venetian painters. His father was Jacopo Bellini, his brother was Gentile Bellini (who was more highly regarded than Giovanni during his lifetime, although the reverse is true today), and his brother-in-law was Andrea Mantegna. He was considered to have revolutionized Venetian painting, moving it towards a more sensuous and colouristic style. Through the use of clear, slow-drying <b>oil</b> <b>paints,</b> Giovanni created deep, rich tints and detailed shadings. His sumptuous coloring and fluent, atmospheric landscapes had a great effect on the Venetian painting school, especially on his pupils Giorgione and Titian.|$|E
25|$|Poppyseed oil {{has been}} used for {{painting}} for at least 1500 years—one of the oldest known oil paintings, found in caves of Afghanistan and dated to AD 650, was likely drawn using poppyseed oil. It is most often found in white paints, and as a varnish. Painters prepared poppyseed oil by hand until the late 19th century, when <b>oil</b> <b>paints</b> became available prepared in tubes. While poppyseed oil does not cause as much yellowish tinting of paints as linseed oil, it dries slower and is less durable than linseed oil because the fat responsible for the yellowing also provides durability. Perilla oil, which causes yellow tinting even more than linseed, is even more durable than linseed.|$|E

500|$|The South Georgia boat {{party could}} expect to meet hurricane-force winds and waves—the notorious Cape Horn Rollers—measuring from trough to crest as much as [...] Shackleton {{therefore}} selected the heaviest and strongest of the three boats, the [...] long James Caird. It had been built as a whaleboat in London to Worsley's orders, designed on the [...] "double-ended" [...] principle pioneered by Norwegian shipbuilder Colin Archer. Shackleton asked the expedition's carpenter, Harry McNish, if he could make the vessel more seaworthy. Using improvised tools and materials, McNish raised the boat's sides and built a makeshift deck of wood and canvas, sealing his work with <b>oil</b> <b>paints,</b> lamp wick, and seal blood. The craft was strengthened by having the mast of the Dudley Docker lashed inside, {{along the length of}} her keel. She was then fitted as a ketch, with a mainmast and a mizzenmast, rigged to carry lug sails and a jib. The weight of the boat was increased by the addition of approximately 1 long ton (1,016kg) of ballast, to lessen the risk of capsizing in the high seas that Shackleton knew they would encounter.|$|E

2500|$|The {{distinctive}} background view across Lake Geneva to the Le Môle peak in The Miraculous Draught of Fishes by Konrad Witz (1444) {{is often}} cited as the first Western rural landscape to show a specific scene. The landscape studies by Dürer clearly represent actual scenes, which can be identified in many cases, and were at least partly made on the spot; the drawings by Fra Bartolomeo also seem clearly sketched from nature. Dürer's finished works seem generally to use invented landscapes, although the spectacular bird's-eye view in his engraving Nemesis shows an actual view in the Alps, with additional elements. Several landscapists {{are known to have}} made drawings and watercolour sketches from nature, but the evidence for early oil painting being done outside is limited.
