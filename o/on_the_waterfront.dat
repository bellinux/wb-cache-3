5|$|A {{number of}} notable sculptures {{can be seen}} in the city. In {{addition}} to The Little Mermaid <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>waterfront,</b> there are two historic equestrian statues in the city centre: Jacques Saly's Frederik V on Horseback (1771) in Amalienborg Square and the statue of Christian V on Kongens Nytorv created by Abraham-César Lamoureux in 1688 who was inspired by the statue of Louis XIII in Paris.

5|$|In {{addition}} to his film and television career, Morse has continued to appear on stage. For his performance in the 1997 Off-Broadway production of Paula Vogel's Pulitzer Prize-winning drama How I Learned to Drive, he received an Obie Award, a Drama League Award, a Drama Desk Award, and a Lucille Lortel Award. That same year, he played Father Barry in the play adaptation of <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>Waterfront.</b> The play ran for only eight performances. From 2007 to 2008, Morse appeared on Broadway in Conor McPherson's play The Seafarer.|$|E
5|$|Motor {{traffic in}} the city grew {{significantly}} and in 1972 the trams were replaced by buses. From the 1960s, on the initiative of the young architect Jan Gehl, pedestrian streets and cycle tracks were created in the city centre. Activity in the port of Copenhagen declined with {{the closure of the}} Holmen naval base. Copenhagen Airport underwent considerable expansion, becoming a hub for the Nordic countries. In the 1990s, large-scale housing developments were realized in the harbour area and in the west of Amager. The national library's Black Diamond building <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>waterfront</b> was completed in 1999.|$|E

5|$|On 5 August 1583, an English Sea Dog, Sir Humphrey Gilbert {{claimed the}} area as England's first {{overseas}} colony under Royal Charter of Queen Elizabeth I. There was no permanent population, however, and Gilbert was lost at sea during his return voyage, thereby ending any immediate plans for settlement. The Newfoundland National War Memorial is <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>waterfront</b> in St. John's, at the purported site of Gilbert's landing and proclamation.|$|E
5|$|The Henry Art Gallery {{opened in}} 1927, {{the first public}} art museum in Washington. The Seattle Art Museum (SAM) opened in 1933; SAM opened a museum {{downtown}} in 1991 (expanded and reopened 2007); since 1991, the 1933 building has been SAM's Seattle Asian Art Museum (SAAM). SAM also operates the Olympic Sculpture Park (opened 2007) <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>waterfront</b> north of the downtown piers. The Frye Art Museum is a free museum on First Hill.|$|E
5|$|The Odeon Cinema {{was opened}} 2 June 1952 and, was later rebranded {{in the early}} 21st century as the Forum cinema. Its owners, however, {{struggled}} to meet tough competition from the Cineworld Cinemas group, which opened a 10 screen multiplex <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>waterfront</b> centre in St. Helier on reclaimed land in December 2002 and the Odeon closed its doors in late 2008. The Odeon is now a listed building.|$|E

5|$|With {{the economy}} {{so focused on}} one crop, Mobile's {{fortunes}} were always tied to those of cotton, and the city weathered many financial crises. Mobile slaveholders owned relatively few slaves compared to planters in the upland plantation areas, but many households had domestic slaves, and many other slaves worked <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>waterfront</b> and on riverboats. The last slaves to enter the United States from the African trade were brought to Mobile on the slave ship Clotilde. Among them was Cudjoe Lewis, who in the 1920s was the last survivor of the slave trade.|$|E
5|$|In March 1939, Robertson was {{appointed}} {{commander of the}} 7th Military District, which encompassed the Northern Territory. It was his first command since the First World War. He was promoted to the temporary rank of colonel in August 1939, and this became substantive in November. The job involved cooperation with the Royal Australian Navy and Royal Australian Air Force, and the administration of a company of regular soldiers known as the Darwin Mobile Force. After the Second World War began in September 1939, Robertson became responsible for supplying the 7th Military District's quota of volunteers for the Second Australian Imperial Force (AIF). A strike <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>waterfront</b> saw Robertson committing troops to help unload cargo.|$|E
5|$|Notable films {{topping the}} American Film Institute's AFI 100 list include Orson Welles's Citizen Kane (1941), which is {{frequently}} {{cited as the}} greatest film of all time, Casablanca (1942), The Godfather (1972), Gone with the Wind (1939), Lawrence of Arabia (1962), The Wizard of Oz (1939), The Graduate (1967), <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>Waterfront</b> (1954), Schindler's List (1993), Singin' in the Rain (1952), It's a Wonderful Life (1946) and Sunset Boulevard (1950).

5|$|The District of Columbia {{government}} {{responded by}} threatening to veto any further Metro subway construction unless construction of the Green Line was made Metro's highest priority. Twenty-four hours of intense discussions later, Metro agreed to the District government's wishes. Construction began <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Waterfront</b> Station, and the station was largely complete by January 1981. Once complete, the station was used for storage. By December 1980, Metro was still predicting that the Green Line to Anacostia would open in July 1986. But in January 1981, Metro admitted that the line would not open until at least 1990 because of funding constraints. Two months later, Metro estimated {{the cost of building}} the Green Line from U Street NW to Anacostia at $175 million.|$|E
5|$|Norfolk's {{city leaders}} began a long push to revive its urban core. While Granby Street {{underwent}} decline, Norfolk city leaders focused <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>waterfront</b> and its collection of decaying piers and warehouses. Many obsolete shipping and warehousing facilities were demolished. In their place, planners {{created a new}} boulevard, Waterside Drive, along which many of the high-rise buildings in Norfolk's skyline have been erected. In 1983, the city and The Rouse Company developed the Waterside festival marketplace to attract people back to the waterfront and catalyze further downtown redevelopment. Other facilities opened in the ensuing years, including the Harbor Park baseball stadium, home of the Norfolk Tides Triple-A minor league baseball team. In 1995, the park was named the finest facility in minor league baseball by Baseball America. Norfolk's efforts to revitalize its downtown have attracted acclaim from economic development and urban planning circles throughout the country. Downtown's rising fortunes helped to expand the city's revenues and allowed the city to direct attention to other neighborhoods.|$|E
25|$|Fares {{are paid}} upon {{entering}} when traveling eastbound (southbound <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Waterfront</b> Line) and upon leaving when traveling westbound (northbound <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Waterfront</b> Line). Fares are collected {{on board the}} train except at Tower City Station, where they are collected at faregates entering or leaving the station. Certain other stations, notably those <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Waterfront</b> Line, have facilities for collecting fares, but those facilities are not used except during special events, such as during Cleveland Browns games at West 3rd Street Station.|$|E
