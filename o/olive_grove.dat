40|$|We {{compared}} species richness, species composition, {{density and}} biomass of earthworm communities in organically and conventionally managed <b>olive</b> <b>groves</b> in central Greece. Earthworm biomass and density {{was significantly higher}} (p< 0. 05) in organic <b>olive</b> <b>groves</b> than in conventional <b>olive</b> <b>groves.</b> The highest species richness was recorded in the organic <b>olive</b> <b>groves.</b> Six species were recorded in total: Octodrilus complanatus, O. croaticus, Dendrobaena byblica, D. veneta, Aporrectodea caliginosa, and Microscolex phosphoreus. Only four of these were found in conventional <b>olive</b> <b>groves,</b> where D. veneta and M phosphoreus were absent. The most abundant species were O. complanatus, D. veneta, and D. byblica...|$|R
40|$|Earthworms {{can be used}} as bioindicators of soil {{management}} as they are easy to classify and very sensitive to changes of both physical and chemical soil parameters. The aim of this work was to study relations between earthworm species (richness and density) and the physicochemical soil properties such as pH, organic matter, soil moisture, and texture (percentages of sand, silt, and clay) under different farming practices (organic and conventional) in <b>olive</b> <b>groves</b> in central Greece. The data revealed significantly greater values of earthworm species richness, density, soil organic matter, and moisture in the organic <b>olive</b> <b>groves</b> than in the conventional ones. Furthermore, total earthworm density was positively correlated to earthworm Shannon diversity index, soil moisture, organic matter, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in organic <b>olive</b> <b>groves.</b> However, total earthworm density was negatively correlated to soil pH and silt in conventional <b>olive</b> <b>groves.</b> It can be concluded that species richness and density of earthworms in <b>olive</b> <b>groves</b> can be considered as sensitive indicators of management practices...|$|R

5|$|At this point, the Greeks of Laconia and Arcadia, {{under the}} {{leadership}} of a certain Michael, tried to stop the Franks at the <b>olive</b> <b>grove</b> of Kountouras in northeastern Messenia. Modern scholars have traditionally identified this Michael with Michael I Komnenos Doukas, founder of the Despotate of Epirus, but this identification has been questioned more recently by Raymond-Joseph Loenertz, as the fragile nature of his control over Epirus would have made a departure to aid the Moreote Greeks a major and unlikely gamble.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, a Crusader {{force of}} between 500 and 700 knights {{under the command}} of William of Champlitte and Geoffrey I of Villehardouin {{advanced}} into the Peloponnese to deal with Byzantine resistance. In the <b>Olive</b> <b>Grove</b> of Kountouras in Messenia, they confronted an army of around 5,000 Peloponnesian Greeks {{under the command of}} a certain Michael. In the ensuing battle, the Crusaders emerged victorious, forcing the Byzantines to retreat and crushing resistance in the Peloponnese. This battle {{paved the way for the}} foundation of the Principality of Achaea.|$|E
5|$|The exact {{location}} of the <b>olive</b> <b>grove</b> of Kountouras in Messenia is unknown; the Greek version of the Chronicle records, apart from the owner's name (Kountouras or the variant form Koundouron), a location name Kepeskianous (Κηπησκιάνους), while a variant form is recorded as Kapsikia (Καψικία). Efforts {{have been made to}} identify the locality, with some linking it with the modern village of Kapsia west of Mantinea in Arcadia, but this is too far from the reported area of the battle based on the sources, and furthermore olive trees do not grow in the region.|$|E

40|$|In {{southern}} Italy, {{the olive}} oil sector {{is an important part}} of the primary sector and its development requires support from research to ensure its sustainability. This work proposes the first step for set up a decision support system (DSS) for establishing mechanisation in agricultural operations for different <b>olive</b> <b>groves.</b> To contribute to this goal researches have been carried out to test the ability of remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) to map <b>olive</b> <b>groves</b> and their agronomic characteristics. In detail, this study aimed to classify <b>olives</b> <b>grove</b> areas in terms of agronomic suitability and detect horticultural characteristics of <b>olive</b> <b>groves</b> in order to develop a fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making method for managing mechanical harvesting and pruning. The detection and interpretation of horticultural traits was conducted on two different <b>olive</b> <b>groves</b> areas of Sicily. Results demonstrate that fuzzy technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution can be a useful decision-making tool combined with the automatable methodology for data acquisition.

5|$|After the Vichy French {{defeat in}} Syria, the 2/2nd Pioneer Battalion was {{relocated}} to Tripoli, Lebanon where it headquartered itself in an <b>olive</b> <b>grove</b> while carrying out training and garrison duties {{over the next}} four months. During November, the battalion was moved to Qatana in Syria, but with the entry of Japan into the war in late 1941, the 1st Australian Corps including the 6th and 7th Divisions were directed to move to the Netherlands East Indies for service in the Pacific theatre. In January 1942, Peeler was among the men of the 2/2nd Pioneer Battalion who embarked aboard HMT Orcades for Sumatra but later diverted to Java. He was promoted to Warrant Officer Class II during this time.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 13 May 1915, Blamey, in his {{capacity}} as 1st Division intelligence officer, led a patrol consisting of himself, Sergeant J. H. Will and Bombardier A. A. Orchard, behind the Turkish lines in an effort to locate the <b>Olive</b> <b>Grove</b> guns that had been harassing the beach. Near Pine Ridge, an enemy party of eight Turks approached; when one of them went to bayonet Orchard, Blamey shot the Turk with his revolver. In the action that followed, six Turks were killed. He withdrew his patrol back to the Australian lines without locating the guns. For this action, he was mentioned in despatches.|$|E
5|$|Michael's domain in Epirus {{became a}} refuge and centre of {{resistance}} of the Greeks against the Latin Crusaders. At about the same time, according to some modern scholars, he may have led the abortive Greek resistance to the Crusaders in the Peloponnese, which was crushed at the Battle of the <b>Olive</b> <b>Grove</b> of Kountouras; according to other views, he may have led a campaign there between 1207 and 1209. In order to avoid invasion and buy time to consolidate his position in Epirus, Michael soon entered into negotiations with Pope Innocent III, and concluded treaties with the Latin Empire and the Republic of Venice. In the meantime, his rule received a boost in legitimacy when he ransomed the deposed Alexios III from captivity. According to later chroniclers, Alexios III conferred the hereditary rule of Epirus to Michael and his descendants.|$|E

It lends itself better to alternating use, but in intensive <b>olive</b> <b>groves</b> this can be amended with different forms of land management (manuring, irrigation and pruning).|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the impact of}} two predominant management types (mowing vs. tilling) in <b>olive</b> <b>groves</b> on plant diversity, we have surveyed <b>olive</b> <b>groves</b> at ten localities in the surroundings of Šibenik (Dalmatia, Croatia). Among the surveyed groves, 12 were managed by tilling and 11 were managed by mowing. Altogether 323 taxa from 207 genera and 58 families were recorded. The families with the highest numbers of taxa were Fabaceae, Poaceae, Cichoriaceae and Asteraceae. Mowed <b>olive</b> <b>groves</b> were significantly richer in flora (280 taxa) {{in relation to the}} tilled ones (181 taxa), with 138 taxa in common to the both management types. An analysis of the life forms showed the domination of therophytes (54. 18 %) and the phytogeographycal analysis showed that the most frequent floral element was Mediterranean (46. 13 %). Mowed <b>olive</b> <b>groves</b> almost exclusively contained endemic and endangered species while the invasive alien plant taxa were recorded mostly in the tilled <b>olive</b> <b>groves.</b> Mowing seems as much better management practice {{from the standpoint of the}} nature conservation. Based on its floristic composition and richness, tillage seems to completely remove the nursing effect that <b>olive</b> <b>groves</b> can provide for the dry grasslands listed in the Annex I of the Habitat Directive, which are otherwise, in open spaces without grazing exposed to disappearing through the process of secondary succession...|$|R
5|$|The 28th Brigade, 7th (Meerut) Division {{advanced}} from Beit Lid at 21:30 on {{an overnight}} march towards Masudiye Station and Sebustiye. They {{arrived at the}} 'Anebta road near Ramin at 01:30, and by 03:00 had advanced to capture the Masudiye Station along with an engine and 16 carriages, before continuing towards Sebustiye. During this march, a strong rearguard {{in the ruins of}} Samaria was attacked by the 51st and 53rd Sikhs. After working their way through an <b>olive</b> <b>grove</b> on the northwest side of the Central Powers' rearguard position, they attacked from the flank, with a platoon of 51st Sikhs gaining the crest from the southwest. The garrison of 181 German (or Ottoman) soldiers was captured with eight light and heavy machine guns. More than 400 sick were found in a hospital nearby.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} night hours of 24 October 2001, during the Second Intifada, the Israeli Army (IDF) {{launched}} an incursion into Beit Rima in {{what became the}} first major Israeli military raid into Palestinian-controlled territory, according to Human Rights Watch (HRW). The IDF stated {{the intent of the}} raid was to capture the alleged killers of Israeli Tourism Minister Rehavam Ze'evi, who was shot dead by members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) in retaliation for Israel's assassination of the party's leader Mustafa Zibri (Abu Ali Mustafa) in August. About 50 people from Beit Rima were detained and brought to the Israeli settlement of Halamish for interrogation. Most were released before the day's end, but eleven men remained in Israeli custody, two of whom Israel alleged to be directly involved in Ze'evi's assassination. In the course of the raid, Israeli forces killed six Palestinians, including three members of the Palestinian National Security Forces and two officers from the Civil Police, and wounded seven others. The Palestinian authorities in Beit Rima stated they had not received prior warning from the IDF and their slain men had been resting in an <b>olive</b> <b>grove</b> near the local police station, while Israeli military officials stated all those killed had either fired on Israeli forces or approached them threateningly and all were members of various armed groups. The HRW stated that the Red Crescent was prevented from treating the injured men until 7:00 am, a delay that resulted in the death of two of the police officers. Israeli forces also demolished three homes in the town, alleging that they belonged to family members of Ze'evi's killers.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} Michael's {{establishment}} in Epirus is obscure. The hagiography of St. Theodora of Arta, {{written in the}} late 13th century, maintains that Alexios III had appointed Michael as governor in the Peloponnese and a certain Senachereim, who was Michael's relative by marriage (they both had married first cousins from the Melissenos family), as governor of the Theme of Nicopolis in Epirus. When the local inhabitants rose in revolt against him, Senachereim called upon Michael for aid. Michael rushed to Nicopolis, but not before the locals had killed Senachereim. After that, Michael, himself widowed, took Senachereim's widow as his wife and succeeded him as governor. Although generally regarded as inaccurate due to the many errors it contains, {{this part of the}} hagiography is at least partially corroborated by Villehardouin's account that he married the daughter of a local magnate. It is certain that Michael was never appointed governor of the Peloponnese, but the hagiography's reference to the peninsula has led to suggestions by modern scholars that he is to be identified with the Michael who led the Peloponnesian Greeks in the Battle of the <b>Olive</b> <b>Grove</b> of Kountouras against the Crusaders, in the summer of 1205. This commonly held identification has been questioned by more recent research by the historian Raymond-Joseph Loenertz, who suggests that Michael leaving Epirus, which still was not securely under his control, to go on campaign in the Peloponnese would have been extremely unlikely as it would leave Epirus open to attack by Boniface. Loenertz does however consider that Michael may indeed have led another expedition into the Peloponnese a few years later, in 1207–09 (see below).|$|E
