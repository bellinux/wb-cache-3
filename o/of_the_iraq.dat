5|$|As the {{disaster}} in New Orleans intensified, critics charged that Bush was misrepresenting his administration's role {{in what they}} saw as a flawed response. Leaders attacked Bush for having appointed apparently incompetent leaders to positions of power at FEMA, notably Michael D. Brown; it was also argued that the federal response was limited as a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraq</b> War and Bush himself did not act upon warnings of floods. Bush responded to mounting criticism by accepting full responsibility for the federal government's failures in its handling of the emergency. It has been argued that with Katrina, Bush passed a political tipping point from which he would not recover.|$|E

50|$|After <b>the</b> {{nationalisation}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> IPC, <b>Iraq's</b> oil revenue {{increased from}} 219 million ID in 1972 to 1.7 billion ID in 1974, 3.7 billion ID in 1978 and 8.9 billion ID in 1980: by over 40 times {{in less than}} a decade. With <b>the</b> success <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Iranian revolution, <b>Iraq</b> became <b>the</b> second-largest oil exporter in the world. The increase in oil exports rejuvenated the country's economy; nearly all economic indices increased to unprecedented levels. From 1970 to 1980, Iraq's economy grew by 11.7 percent. During <b>the</b> Iran-Iraq War <b>Iraq's</b> oil-exporting capabilities decreased, and the price for oil decreased simultaneously. <b>The</b> growth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1970s was not sustainable. The economy was dependent on high oil prices and Iraq's oil-exporting capabilities; once oil was out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> picture, <b>Iraq's</b> growth would decrease dramatically (even more so during a war).|$|R
5|$|President Bush's legacy {{continues}} to develop today. Supporters credit Bush's counterterrorism policies with preventing another major terrorist attack from {{occurring in the}} US after 9/11 and also praise individual policies such as the Medicare prescription drug benefit and the AIDS relief program known as PEPFAR. Critics often point to his handling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraq</b> War, specifically the failure to find weapons of mass destruction, that were the main rationale behind the initial invasion—as well as his handling of tax policy, Hurricane Katrina, climate change and the 2008 financial crisis—as proof that George W. Bush was unfit to be president.|$|E
5|$|Saeed {{was called}} {{up from the}} Iraq {{national}} under-17 football team to the reserves team <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraq</b> national under-20 football team, where he first participated in the 1975 AFC Youth Championship, in which Iraq shared the title with Iran after they had a goalless match in the final. In the 1976 edition, Saeed was called up by the team's new manager, Miodgard Stankovic, {{to be part of}} the first eleven, scoring four goals in Iraq's first match, against Sri Lanka, and becoming the top goalscorer of the tournament with 7 goals. Iraq was knocked out in the quarterfinal, against North Korea.|$|E

5|$|After the 1976 Gulf Cup of Nations the {{managerial}} staff was changed and the Iraq Football Association assigned the Croatian manager, Lenko Grčić, {{as the new}} manager <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraq</b> national football team, Saeed was called up to the national team, {{for the first time}} in his career, at the age of 18. He made his debut on 5 September 1976 in a friendly match against Saudi Arabia where they drew 0–0. He continued to play in the youth team because the manager, Miodgard Stankovic, was Yugoslavian, reaching an understanding with Grčić. Iraq achieved the 1977 AFC Youth Championship where Saeed scored the winning goal in the final, from a diving header in the 90th minute, against Iran in a 4–3 victory in Tehran. Saeed was also the top goalscorer of this edition with 9 goals, scoring his first national hat-trick against Afghanistan in Iraq's 5–1 win. The same team represented Iraq in the first edition of the FIFA World Youth Championship in 1977 where they lost 3–1 to the Soviet Union, won 5–1 over Austria with Saeed scoring a hat-trick, and lost 4–0 to Paraguay which knocked them out of the competition.|$|E
5|$|As Saeed was {{the vice}} {{president}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraq</b> Football Association, which was headed by Uday Hussein, in the 1990s, there were many controversies about him being a Ba'athist and a Saddamist. He was also accused of being of a Palestinian descent, torturing players, giving positions to Tikritis. Accusations also went to say that Saeed was Uday's representative in robbing Kuwaitis in the 1991 Gulf War. Documents were put on the internet by some news agencies that suggest that Saeed, Najeh Humoud and Moayad Al-Badri worked for the Iraqi Intelligence Service in 2002 by gathering information on their targets. The documents included Saeed gathering information about Al-Badri when he was staying in Saudi Arabia before joining them himself. They also show {{the approval of the}} Personal Secretary of Former President Saddam Hussein, Abid Hamid Mahmud, of paying Saeed $50,000 after completing his mission and him signing on receiving $25,000. One of the documents showed him and Al-Badri executing a mission to monitor an alleged Israeli spy in Syria and showed him arresting Yahya Alwan before travelling to Saudi Arabia.|$|E
5|$|At {{the launch}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraq</b> War dozens of 12-member Special Forces teams {{infiltrated}} southern and western Iraq {{to hunt for}} Scud missiles and pinpoint bombing targets. Scores of Navy SEALs seized oil terminals and pumping stations on the southern coast. Air Force combat controllers flew combat missions in MC-130H Combat Talon IIs and established austere desert airstrips to begin the flow of soldiers and supplies deep into Iraq. It {{was a far cry}} from the Persian Gulf war of 1991, where Special Operations forces were kept largely on the sidelines. But it would not be a replay of Afghanistan, where Army Special Forces and Navy SEALs led the fighting. After their star turn in Afghanistan, many special operators were disappointed to play a supporting role in Iraq. Many special operators felt restricted by cautious commanders. From that point, USSOCOM has since killed or captured hundreds of insurgents and Al-Qaeda terrorists. It has conducted several foreign internal defense missions successfully training the Iraqi security forces.|$|E
