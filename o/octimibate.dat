40|$|We {{determined}} {{the effects of}} two prostacyclin agonists (<b>octimibate</b> and BMY 42393) on the progression of the fatty streak in vivo and on macrophage function in vitro. Hamsters were fed chow plus 0. 05 % cholesterol and 10 % coconut oil. Control hamsters were compared with animals receiving either <b>octimibate</b> (10 or 30 nig/kg per day) or BMY 42393 (30 mg/kg per day). After 10 weeks of treatment, <b>octimibate</b> decreased plasma total cholesterol and triglycerides by 43 % and 32 %, respectively. Neither agonist affected blood pressure or heart rate. Lesion-prone aortic arches were stained with hematoxylin and oil red O and examined en face. Compared with controls, <b>octimibate</b> and BMY 42393 on average decreased mononuclear cells attached to the luminal surface by 44 % and reduced subendothelial macrophage-foam cell number by 56 %, foam cell size by 38 %, and fatty streak area by 63 %. Since <b>octimibate</b> is a putative inhibitor of acyl coenzyme A cholesterol acyltransferase, we studied the effect of both agents on cholesteryl ester metabolism in murine macrophages. At 10 yu. M, <b>octimibate</b> and BMY 42393 decreased cholesteryl ester accumulation in macrophages by 90 % and 41 %, respectively. <b>Octimibate</b> inhibited cholesteryl ester synthesis by 96 % and increased the rate of cholesteryl ester degradation by 52 %. Both prostacyclin agonists reduced macrophage scavenger receptor-mediated uptake of acetylated low density lipoprotein by 24 - 66 % and increased cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels. <b>Octimibate</b> an...|$|E
40|$|<b>Octimibate</b> {{inhibited}} ADP- and collagen-induced platelet aggre-gation in human, {{rabbit and}} rat platelet-rich plasma. Washed human platelets treated with <b>octimibate</b> had elevated cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels and cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity. When whole platelets were incubated with radiolabeled phos-phate, <b>octimibate</b> produced {{an increase in}} the phosphorylation of platelet proteins with relative molecular weights of 22, 26, 50 and 80 kilodaltons. This pattern of protein phosphorylation is identical to that observed when the platelets were treated with forskolin, phosphodiesterase inhibitors or other compounds that elevate platelet CAMP levels. <b>Octimibate</b> also inhibited the rise in intracellular Ca caused by thrombin, as measured using Fura- 2 -loaded platelets, which is consistent with octimibate’s ability to elevate platelet cAMP levels. When isolated platelet plasm...|$|E
40|$|Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) {{cells were}} transiently {{transfected}} with the mouse prostacyclin (mIP) receptor to examine IP agonist-mediated stimulation of [3 H]-cyclic AMP and [3 H]-inositol phosphate production. The prostacyclin analogues, cicaprost, iloprost, carbacyclin and prostaglandin E 1, stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity with EC 50 values of 5, 6, 25 and 95 [*]nM, respectively. These IP agonists also stimulated the phospholipase C pathway with 10 [*]–[*] 40 [*]fold lower potency than stimulation of adenylyl cyclase. The non-prostanoid prostacyclin mimetics, <b>octimibate,</b> BMY[*] 42393 and BMY[*] 45778, also stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity, with EC 50 values of 219, 166 and 398 [*]nM, respectively, {{but failed to}} stimulate [3 H]-inositol phosphate production. <b>Octimibate,</b> BMY[*] 42393 and BMY[*] 45778 inhibited iloprost-stimulated [3 H]-inositol phosphate production in a non-competitive manner. Activation of the endogenously-expressed P 2 purinergic receptor by ATP led {{to an increase in}} [3 H]-inositol phosphate production which was inhibited by the non-prostanoid prostacyclin mimetics in non-transfected CHO cells. Prostacyclin analogues and other prostanoid receptor ligands failed to inhibit ATP-stimulated [3 H]-inositol phosphate production. A comparison between the IP receptor-specific non-prostanoid ONO- 1310 and the structurally-related EP 3 receptor-specific agonist ONO-AP- 324, indicated that the inhibitory effect of non-prostanoids was specific for those compounds known to activate IP receptors. The non-prostanoid prostacyclin mimetics also inhibited phospholipase C activity when stimulated by constitutively-active mutant GαqRC, Gα 14 RC and Gα 16 QL transiently expressed in CHO cells. These drugs did not inhibit adenylyl cyclase activity when stimulated by the constitutively-active mutant GαsQL. These results suggest that non-prostanoid prostacyclin mimetics can specifically inhibit [3 H]-inositol phosphate production by targeting Gq/ 11 and/or phospholipase C in CHO cells, and that this effect is independent of IP receptors...|$|E
