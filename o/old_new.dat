5|$|Asher {{broke off}} the {{engagement}} in early 1968, after {{coming back from}} an acting assignment in Bristol to find McCartney in bed with another woman, Francie Schwartz. McCartney and Asher later attempted to mend their relationship, but finally broke up in July1968. Asher has consistently refused to publicly discuss {{that part of her}} life. Schwartz, a twenty three year <b>old</b> <b>New</b> York scriptwriter, had travelled to London trying to interest Apple Corps in a film script. Schwartz was then asked by McCartney to move into his Cavendish Avenue house, and was given a job working for Derek Taylor at Apple, which was then based in Wigmore Street, London. She attended many sessions during the recording of the White Album, and was living with McCartney when Lennon and Yoko Ono were also invited to live there. Shortly after, Schwartz sold the story of her time at Cavendish Avenue to Rolling Stone magazine.|$|E
5|$|In the {{original}} plan for the U.S. Highway System, as approved by the Bureau of Public Roads in November 1926, US7 was defined as beginning in New York City and designated on the alignment of NY22 to Amenia, where it shifted northeast into Sharon, Connecticut to use <b>old</b> <b>New</b> England Route4 through Massachusetts and Vermont {{all the way to}} the Canadian border. Apparently New York State did not approve this plan, and by mid-1927 the official route log published by AASHO (now known as AASHTO) had been amended so that the southern end of US7 began in Norwalk, Connecticut instead.|$|E

40|$|Private {{provision}} for retirement in New Zealand is {{made on a}} voluntary basis without tax concessions or other direct concessions to encourage savings. It enables individuals to enhance their standard of living above that provided by New Zealand Superannuation and potentially maintain their living standards in retirement at the level experienced during their working lives. This report examines the adequacy of private income provision in retirement within the context of working-life asset accumulation and living standards outcomes. The report considers the living standards of the current cohort of <b>older</b> <b>New</b> Zealanders in terms of whether minimum adequate living standards have been achieved and whether pre-retirement living standards have been maintained in retirement. Income and other factors that contribute to the living standards experienced by <b>older</b> <b>New</b> Zealanders are also discussed. The outlook for future cohorts of <b>older</b> <b>New</b> Zealanders is then examined based on emerging trends for <b>older</b> <b>New</b> Zealanders and the factors found to contribute to variation in living standards...|$|R
