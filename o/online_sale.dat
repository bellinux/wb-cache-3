5|$|LOCOG faced further {{criticism}} for how it handled {{the sale of}} tickets for the wheelchair areas within venues. In May 2012 the <b>online</b> <b>sale</b> of tickets for wheelchair areas {{was replaced by a}} dedicated telephone hotline. Organisers were criticised for their use of an 0844 revenue share number for this hotline, and for neglecting to mention on its ticketing website that calls would be charged by the minute. Former sports minister Gerry Sutcliffe viewed this as discrimination against wheelchair users, and called upon LOCOG to compensate those who had used the hotline. LOCOG denied that it was receiving additional profits from the phone line, and claimed that a dedicated line was being used to allow customers to receive a service tailored to their individual accessibility needs.|$|E

This is the first work that characterizes the distribution of book sales in France and that analyzes the dynamic interactions between physical and <b>online</b> <b>sales</b> of books in new state. We first show that the distributions of sales are different between <b>online</b> and physical <b>sales.</b> The is evidence of a long tail for <b>online</b> <b>sales,</b> {{not only in terms}} of catalogues, but also in terms of volume of sales. Secondly, for  58 % of the  20 % of books that belong to the best selling list on both platforms, we observe temporal shifts between the time a given book enters the best selling list in physical stores and online. Finally, we show that sales in independent bookstores have a positive effect on <b>online</b> <b>sales,</b> while <b>online</b> <b>sales</b> only have a marginal effect on sales in physical stores.

40|$|According {{to the new}} {{measurement}} of launching online distribution channels of tobacco enterprises in China, this paper investigates the tobacco firm’s pricing decisions on the supply chain which consists of two manufacturers and one retailer under three dual-channel structures. Three dual-channel structures include no online channel, only one online channel by one manufacture, and two online channels by two manufacturers. We apply the Stackelberg game to analyze the equilibrium pricing strategies under different structures and try to explore the necessity and advantages of launching <b>online</b> <b>sales</b> channels. The results demonstrate that the substitutability of a product has significant impact on introducing <b>online</b> <b>sales</b> channels, and the online dual-channel structure could result in less profit for manufacturers compared to the traditional retail channel structure; and thus, a dual-channel structure with <b>online</b> <b>sales</b> {{is not the best}} strategy for traditional manufacturers. Moreover, when the product is less substitutable, the effect of the tobacco control on the <b>online</b> <b>sales</b> channel is inferior to the traditional channels and vice versa...|$|R
