40|$|A {{survey was}} carried out in the Central-east Alps to {{investigate}} on the features and {{on the use of the}} tractor in forestry. A total of 156 tractors belonging to 96 forest enterprises were checked. Only one forest tractor was found, the <b>other</b> were all <b>agricultural</b> <b>tractors,</b> more or less adapted for forest operations. 	One third of the tractors is utilised in different activities: a part from the forest operations, they are used in agricultural operations, in road maintenance, mainly during winter time, and in transportation of goods. 	Two third of the tractors are used basically for forest operations and they belong to enterprises each of them owns more than one tractor. In this context crawler tractors are used too. These tractors perform only forest job and for these reason they can be considered as monovalent machinery. However all the tractors but one are adapted <b>agricultural</b> <b>tractors.</b> The main reason is connected to the cost of the <b>agricultural</b> <b>tractor,</b> that is cheaper than a forest one, and to the performance that is not so different under Alpine working conditions. 	Taking into an account the information from the survey it seems convenient to address the research efforts toward the adaptation of the existing tractors, emphasising especially the ergonomic and safety features. In such a way it could be possible to manage the machinery cost, maintaining or at least reducing its incidence on the total cost of forest operations...|$|R

The vehicles were submitted for trial in 1935 and were approved however design refinements for mass production were continued until 1937 when mass production began.|$|R

40|$|An <b>agricultural</b> <b>tractor</b> {{represents}} the basic machine that can perform {{most of the}} mechanized works in farmlands using auxiliary equipment that may be attached. Farmland mechanized works at present are carried out with a low fuel consumption and limited operating time because of the development level reached currently by agricultural machinery. Both the <b>agricultural</b> <b>tractors</b> {{as well as the}} auxiliary equipments have undergone a continuous development over time, aimed mainly on engine power increase in order to enable entrainment of greater equipments with result in land works time decrease. This paper performs a functional description for the hydraulic suspension mechanism that can be part of <b>agricultural</b> <b>tractors</b> by means of which coupling of auxiliary equipments it is possible. The suspension mechanism it is positioned generally at the rear side, but also at the front side of the tractor.

40|$|There {{are several}} methods to {{dimension}} concrete slabs due to vehicle loads, {{most of them}} based on Westergaard theory. These methods {{have been developed for}} industrial vehicles (cars, trucks and forklifts). Considering agricultural buildings one of the most used vehicles is the <b>agricultural</b> <b>tractor</b> whose characteristics (tires of great dimensions but with a reduced contact surface) are different to those of the industrial vehicles. The goal of this research was to analyze the applicability of the finite element method (FEM) to estimate the stresses generated on the concrete slabs considering the loads transmitted by <b>agricultural</b> <b>tractors.</b> To achieve this objective, the effect of the loads transmitted by the rear axle tires of three <b>agricultural</b> <b>tractors</b> has been considered. In parallel, the same study has been carried out using the Westergaard theory. As a preliminary step, to validate the FEM, a numerical analysis has been made to obtain the stresses generated on a concrete slab considering three forklifts. The numerical analysis results have been compared with those obtained by mean of validated methods (Portland Cement Association) and the classical theory of Westergaard. For each <b>agricultural</b> <b>tractor,</b> the actual geometry of the contact surface of tires has been measured on a concrete slab and discretized by the FEM. As a result of the research process developed, it is possible to conclude that the FEM is a valid tool to analyze the tensions generated by the loads transmitted by the tires of <b>agricultural</b> <b>tractors</b> on concrete floors supported on the ground...|$|R
