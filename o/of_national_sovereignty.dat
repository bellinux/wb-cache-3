5|$|The Outer Space Treaty {{provides}} the basic framework for international space law. It covers the legal use of outer space by nation states, and includes in its definition of outer space the Moon and other celestial bodies. The treaty states that outer space is free for all nation states {{to explore and}} {{is not subject to}} claims <b>of</b> <b>national</b> <b>sovereignty.</b> It also prohibits the deployment of nuclear weapons in outer space. The treaty was passed by the United Nations General Assembly in 1963 and signed in 1967 by the USSR, the United States of America and the United Kingdom. As of January 1, 2008 the treaty has been ratified by 98 states and signed by an additional 27 states.|$|E

25|$|There was a {{significant}} impact on the Chinese economy after the incident. Foreign loans to China were suspended by the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, and foreign governments; tourism revenue decreased from US$2.2billion to US$1.8billion; foreign direct investment commitments were cancelled and there was a rise in defense spending from 8.6% in 1986, to 15.5% in 1990, reversing a previous 10 year decline. Chinese Premier Li Peng visited the United Nations Security Council on January 31, 1992, and argued that the economic and arms embargoes on China were a violation <b>of</b> <b>national</b> <b>sovereignty.</b>|$|E

40|$|Ever Closer Union” is {{frequently}} {{seen as an}} almost metaphysical aspiration with little political substance; or alternatively as a categorical imperative for the creation a “European Super-State”. Brendan Donnelly, {{who took part in}} the LSE Commission on the Future of Britain in Europe on the matter, writes that instead the phrase is best thought of as neither a cloudy aspiration, nor a detailed commitment, but rather a factual description of a process enshrined in the European Treaties. This process entails incremental sharing <b>of</b> <b>national</b> <b>sovereignties</b> between the member states, monitored and reinforced by independent EU institutions...|$|R

Vichaichan was immediately condemned by a council of high officials (convened by Si Suriyawongse), a resolution was written accusing the Prince of seeking foreign intervention in an internal dispute at the expense <b>of</b> <b>national</b> <b>sovereignty</b> and royal authority. Chulalongkorn intervened before the document could be passed, by suggesting simply that they should try to invite the Front Palace to return instead. Vichaichan refused reconciliation and remained in the British Consulate with the support of both the British and French representatives.|$|E
25|$|De Gaulle had {{not been}} {{instrumental}} in setting up the new organization and, from the start, he opposed efforts by fellow EEC member countries to move toward some form of political integration that, in de Gaulle's thinking, would impinge on the sovereignty of France, both internally and externally. To counter those supranational tendencies that he disparaged, he put forward in 1961 the so-called Fouchet Plan that maintained all decision-making powers {{in the hands of}} governments, reducing the projected European parliamentary assembly to a mere consultative assembly. As expected, the plan was rejected by France's partners. In July 1965 de Gaulle provoked a major six-month crisis when he ordered the boycott of EEC institutions (see Empty chair crisis below) until his demands – the withdrawal of a European Commission proposal to reinforce the community institutions to the detriment <b>of</b> <b>national</b> <b>sovereignty,</b> and the acceptance of France's proposal regarding the financing of the newly established Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) – were met with the Luxembourg compromise.|$|E

25|$|It was {{prepared}} by the Grand National Assembly that was elected both as a Constitutional Convention and as an acting Parliament on April 23, 1920, following the de facto collapse of the Ottoman Empire {{in the aftermath of}} the First World War. Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, who would later become the first president of the Republic of Turkey in 1923, was the major driving force behind the preparation of a Constitution that derived its sovereignty from the nation and not from the Sultan, the absolute monarch of the Ottoman Empire. The National Assembly convened with the purpose of writing a would prepare the ground for the proclamation of a Republic and consecrate the principle <b>of</b> <b>national</b> <b>sovereignty.</b> This Constitution would also serve as the legal basis for the Turkish War of Independence during 1919-1923, since it would refute the principles of the Treaty of Sèvres of 1918 signed by the Ottoman Empire, by which a great majority of the Empire's territory would have to be ceded to the Entente powers that had won the First World War.|$|E
500|$|Whereas all of {{the above}} {{measures}} were broadly popular, across most of the political spectrum, the same was not true of the proposal to amend Article 32. [...] Said article had not been amended in the overhaul of 1868, and its text had remained unchanged since the original constitution of 1848, stating unequivocally that all sovereignty resided in the person of the Grand Duchess. [...] For some, particularly those that resented the close relations between Marie-Adélaïde and the German royalty, the idea <b>of</b> <b>national</b> <b>sovereignty</b> residing in such a person was unacceptable. [...] The Chamber of Deputies voted to review Article 32, but Kauffmann refused to allow it, seeing the redefinition of the source <b>of</b> <b>national</b> <b>sovereignty</b> as covert republicanism.|$|E
500|$|There is no {{definite}} boundary where {{outer space}} begins. However, the Kármán line, {{at an altitude}} of [...] above sea level, is conventionally used as the start of outer space in space treaties and for aerospace records keeping. The framework for international space law was established by the Outer Space Treaty, which entered into force on 10 October 1967. This treaty precludes any claims <b>of</b> <b>national</b> <b>sovereignty</b> and permits all states to freely explore outer space. Despite the drafting of UN resolutions for the peaceful uses of outer space, anti-satellite weapons have been tested in Earth orbit.|$|E

500|$|Fighting their War on Drugs, the U.S. {{government}} {{hoped to}} stem the cocaine trade by preventing the production of coca; they pressured the Bolivian government to eradicate it, sending troops to Bolivia to aid the operation. Bolivian troops would burn coca crops {{and in many cases}} beat up coca growers who challenged them. Angered by this, Evo returned to cocalero campaigning; like many comrades, he refused the US$2,500 compensation offered by the government for each acre of coca he eradicated. Deeply embedded in Bolivian culture, the campesinos had an ancestral relationship with coca {{and did not want to}} lose their most profitable means of subsistence. For them, it was an issue <b>of</b> <b>national</b> <b>sovereignty,</b> with the U.S. viewed as imperalists; activists regularly proclaimed [...] "Long live coca! Death to the Yankees!"

5000|$|The Diffusion of English Paradigm, {{which is}} a {{dominant}} position {{not only in the}} Anglo-American world but also in the former British colonies in Asia and Africa, is characterized by theoretical orientations such as capitalism, science and technology, modernization, monolingualism, ideological globalization and internationalization, transnationalization, Americanization, the homogenization of the world culture, and linguistic, cultural, and media imperialism. In contrast, an alternative theoretical orientation critical of the Diffusion of English Paradigm is what I call the [...] "Ecology of Language Paradigm."
