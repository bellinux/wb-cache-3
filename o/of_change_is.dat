5|$|The {{direction}} {{and intensity of}} the dipole change over time. Over {{the last two centuries}} the dipole strength has been decreasing {{at a rate of about}} 6.3% per century. At this rate of decrease, the field would be negligible in about 1600 years. However, this strength is about average for the last 7 thousand years, and the current rate <b>of</b> <b>change</b> <b>is</b> not unusual.|$|E
5|$|Adaptation {{may cause}} either the gain {{of a new}} feature, or the loss of an ancestral feature. An example that shows both types <b>of</b> <b>change</b> <b>is</b> {{bacterial}} adaptation to antibiotic selection, with genetic changes causing antibiotic resistance by both modifying {{the target of the}} drug, or increasing the activity of transporters that pump the drug out of the cell. Other striking examples are the bacteria Escherichia coli evolving the ability to use citric acid as a nutrient in a long-term laboratory experiment, Flavobacterium evolving a novel enzyme that allows these bacteria to grow on the by-products of nylon manufacturing, and the soil bacterium Sphingobium evolving an entirely new metabolic pathway that degrades the synthetic pesticide pentachlorophenol. An interesting but still controversial idea is that some adaptations might increase the ability of organisms to generate genetic diversity and adapt by natural selection (increasing organisms' evolvability).|$|E

25|$|More recent {{research}} has found that human populations over the past 50,000 years have changed from dark-skinned to light-skinned and vice versa. Only 100–200 generations ago, the ancestors of most people living today likely also resided in a different place and had a different skin color. According to Nina Jablonski, darkly pigmented modern populations in South India and Sri Lanka are an example of this, having redarkened after their ancestors migrated down from areas much farther north. Scientists originally believed that such shifts in pigmentation occurred relatively slowly. However, researchers have since observed that changes in skin coloration can happen in as little as 100 generations (~2,500 years), with no intermarriage required. The speed <b>of</b> <b>change</b> <b>is</b> also affected by clothing, which tends to slow it down.|$|E

500|$|Here, permittance is Heaviside's {{term for}} capacitance. [...] He {{did not like}} any term that {{suggested}} that a capacitor was a container for holding charge. [...] He rejected the terms capacity (capacitance) and capacious (capacitive) and their inverses incapacity and incapacious. [...] The terms current in his time for a capacitor were condenser (suggesting that the [...] "electric fluid" [...] could be condensed out) and leyden after the Leyden jar, an early form of capacitor, also suggesting some sort of storage. [...] Heaviside preferred the analogy of a mechanical spring under compression, hence his preference for terms that suggested a property of a spring. [...] This preference {{was a result of}} Heaviside following James Clerk Maxwell's view of electric current, or at least, Heaviside's interpretation of it. [...] In this view, electric current is a flow caused by the electromotive force and is the analogue of velocity caused by a mechanical force. [...] At the capacitor, this current causes a [...] "displacement" [...] whose rate <b>of</b> <b>change</b> <b>is</b> equal to the current. [...] The displacement is viewed as an electric strain, like a mechanical strain in a compressed spring. [...] The existence of a flow of physical charge is denied, as is the buildup of charge on the capacitor plates. [...] This is replaced with the concept of divergence of the displacement field at the plates, which is numerically equal to the charge collected on the plates in the charge flow view.|$|E
