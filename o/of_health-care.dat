Nine GPs were interviewed regarding the provision <b>of</b> mental <b>health-care</b> services. Analysis <b>of</b> the interviews indicated a number of themes including the benefits of the new Medicare policy in increasing accessibility of psychologists, GPs' frustrations with the bureaucracy surrounding the use of this policy, GPs' knowledge about the specific skills and training of psychologists, and the importance of GPs' matching patients and clinicians.
