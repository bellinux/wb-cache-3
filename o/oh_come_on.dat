But not Jonathan Creek, where characterisation has never been done in anything but the broadest brush strokes. Both Caroline Quentin and Julia Sawalha have previously filled the generic role of Creek's pushy, inquisitive partner pretty much interchangeably. Smith was no different. Ten minutes in and we'd forgotten she was anyone new." [...] In contrast, Mark Wright, reviewing the episode for The Stage, praised Smith's {{performance as}} Joey, deeming her to be [...] "a much more satisfying sidekick" [...] than Julia Sawalha's Carla Borrego. He enjoyed the on-screen relationship between the two lead actors, writing that: [...] "it’s the interplay between Davies and Smith that makes this really special." [...] Scotland on Sundays Chitra Ramaswamy discussed the nostalgia invoked by the series' return, alongside The Royle Family, Blackadder and Shooting Stars—other major shows which returned for 2008 Christmas specials. Ramaswamy wrote: [...] "all the comforting, well kent faces are back to soothe us through these dismal times. In a culture that {{is becoming more and more}} risk-averse, it's the oldies but goodies that we trust." [...] Sian Brewis for the Leicester Mercury also considered this nostalgia angle, but concluded that: [...] "Jonathan Creek is the sort of auld acquaintance you’re happy to see once a year – any more than that, you feel, and his mannerisms would start to grate." [...] She deemed the episode: [...] "Less a blast from the past as a shuffling [...] "excuse me". Conversely, Anne Pickles for the News and Star wrote that a one-off special was not enough, and [...] "what we really wanted was a brand new series". Pickles said of the episode: [...] "It’s the gentle, facially expressive, deeply sceptical, somehow slightly daft performance of Davies as Creek that makes this sleuthing drama such a glory.

40|$|Operando X-ray {{absorption}} spectroscopy (XAS) {{has been used}} to study the adsorbates and structural changes and their dependence on potential, existing during the ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) on carbon-supported Pt, PtRu, and PtSn anode catalysts. Conventional EXAFS was applied to identify nanoparticle structure and particle size. The Delta mu-XANES technique was used to investigate adsorbed species with potential. On pure Pt, an overall increase in Delta mu amplitude exists under EOR compared to that existing during the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). This increased amplitude was attributed mainly to the C- 1 species on the surface during the EOR; these C- 1 species and CO become oxidized when <b>O(H)</b> <b>come</b> down <b>on</b> the surface. On PtRu catalysts, the O(H) formation and C-species oxidation begins at lower potentials compared to Pt. The ligand effect from oxidized RuOx islands is operative in PtRu and responsible for the performance enhancement. On PtSn, we observe O(H) at nearly all potentials, which may be explained by a very strong ligand effect involving SnOx. The operand Delta mu and EXAFS results enable the determination of relative active surface areas, particle structure, and adsorbate coverages with potential of C species, OH, and O providing new insights into the role of OH in the EOR...|$|R
