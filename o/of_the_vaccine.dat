5|$|It is {{the most}} widely used vaccine worldwide, with more than 90% of all {{children}} being vaccinated. The immunity it induces decreases after about ten years. As tuberculosis is uncommon in most of Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States, BCG is administered to only those people at high risk. Part of the reasoning against the use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vaccine</b> is that it makes the tuberculin skin test falsely positive, reducing the test's use in screening. A number of new vaccines are currently in development.|$|E
5|$|Salk's vaccine {{was then}} {{used in a}} test called the Francis Field Trial, led by Thomas Francis, the largest medical {{experiment}} in history at that time. The test began with approximately 4,000 children at Franklin Sherman Elementary School in McLean, Virginia, and would eventually involve 1.8 million children, in 44 states from Maine to California. By {{the conclusion of the}} study, roughly 440,000 received one or more injections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vaccine,</b> about 210,000 children received a placebo, consisting of harmless culture media, and 1.2 million children received no vaccination and served as a control group, who would then be observed to see if any contracted polio.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of the TgPVR mouse has {{had a profound effect}} on oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) production. Previously, monitoring the safety of OPV had to be performed using monkeys, because only primates are susceptible to the virus. In 1999, the World Health Organization approved the use of the TgPVR mouse as an alternative method of assessing the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vaccine</b> against poliovirus type-3. In 2000, the mouse model was approved for tests of vaccines against type-1 and type-2 poliovirus.|$|E

5|$|After Spike recovers {{and has a}} final {{talk with}} Rashid, he and Elektra are {{captured}} by Cherious Medical, who want to suppress all knowledge of the nanomachines' existence. The two escape from Cherious Medical, grabbing the newly produced vaccine on the way. In turn, Faye escapes after Vincent goes to trigger {{an attack on the}} city that will eventually kill everyone on Mars. After the group reunites, it is determined that Vincent will spread the nanomachines by exploding the giant jack-o'-lantern balloons used in the Halloween parade: Jet has a troop of old aircraft spread the antibodies over the city while Faye heads for the weather control center and causes it to rain on the city, aiding the spread <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vaccine.</b> Spike and Elektra separately head to confront Vincent. Spike arrives first and the two battle to a standstill, then the nanomachines are released and Spike is temporarily weakened by them. As Vincent prepares to kill him, Elektra arrives and shoots Vincent. Having wanted to die since Titan, Vincent does not defend himself and thanks Elektra for their time together before dying.|$|E

The colonists had kept secret a secondary characteristic of the black oil—that those infected with it for prolonged periods would gestate a new colonist lifeform, killing the host. Upon discovering this, the Syndicate vowed to work more closely with the colonists {{in the hope of}} being spared this fate, while only the Well-Manicured Man wished to continue working on a vaccination for resistance. This rejection led to his betrayal of the Syndicate, and to him committing suicide by car bomb before his duplicity was discovered.|$|E
5|$|Oral {{polio vaccine}} (OPV) is an {{attenuated}} vaccine, {{produced by the}} passage of the virus through non-human cells at a sub-physiological temperature, which produces spontaneous mutations in the viral genome. Oral polio vaccines were developed by several groups, one of which was led by Albert Sabin. Other groups, led by Hilary Koprowski and H.R. Cox, developed their own attenuated vaccine strains. In 1958, the National Institutes of Health created a special committee on live polio vaccines. The various vaccines were carefully evaluated for their ability to induce immunity to polio, while retaining a low incidence of neuropathogenicity in monkeys. Large-scale clinical trials performed in the Soviet Union in late 1950s to early 1960s by Mikhail Chumakov and his colleagues demonstrated safety and high efficacy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vaccine.</b> Based on these results, the Sabin strains were chosen for worldwide distribution.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, the World Health Organisation (WHO) {{recommended}} that rotavirus vaccine {{be included in}} all national immunisation programmes. The incidence and severity of rotavirus infections has declined significantly in countries that have acted on this recommendation. A 2014 review of available clinical trial data from countries routinely using rotavirus vaccines in their national immunisation programs found that rotavirus vaccines have reduced rotavirus hospitalisations by 49-92 percent and all cause diarrhoea hospitalisations by 17-55 percent. In Mexico, which in 2006 {{was among the first}} countries in the world to introduce rotavirus vaccine, diarrhoeal disease death rates dropped during the 2009 rotavirus season by more than 65 percent among children age two and under. In Nicaragua, which in 2006 became the first developing country to introduce a rotavirus vaccine, severe rotavirus infections were reduced by 40 percent and emergency room visits by a half. In the United States, rotavirus vaccination since 2006 has led to drops in rotavirus-related hospitalisations by as much as 86 percent. The vaccines may also have prevented illness in non-vaccinated children by limiting the number of circulating infections. In developing countries in Africa and Asia, where the majority of rotavirus deaths occur, a large number of safety and efficacy trials as well as recent post-introduction impact and effectiveness studies of Rotarix and RotaTeq have found that vaccines dramatically reduced severe disease among infants. In September 2013, the vaccine was offered to all children in the UK, aged between two and three months, and it is expected to halve the cases of severe infection and reduce the number of children admitted to hospital because of the infection by 70 percent. In Europe, hospitalisation rates following infection by rotavirus have decreased by 65% to 84% following the introduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vaccine.</b>|$|E

40|$|Objective:: To check <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vaccines</b> on <b>the</b> {{hematopoietic system}} {{and weight of}} mice after immunization. Methods:: The study {{was done with the}} Expanded Programme on Immunization <b>vaccines</b> donated by <b>the</b> Ministries <b>of</b> Health of Abia and Imo States <b>of</b> Nigeria. <b>The</b> <b>vaccines</b> were {{collected}} from the cold-chain stores and transported in <b>vaccine</b> carriers to <b>the</b> cold-chain facility in Nnamdi Azikiwe University Teaching Hospital within 3 hours of collection. They were used to immunize a total <b>of</b> 160 mice. <b>The</b> Ethics Committee <b>of</b> Nnamdi Azikiwe University Teaching Hospital, Nnewi of Anambra State, Nigeria approved the protocol. Results:: Mice body weight changes test showed that the mice all had increased body weight at Days 3 and 7 post-immunization and none died during the 7 d post-immunization observation. The percentage weight gains <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mice compared with the control were 69 %, 70 %, 64 %, 63 %, 65 % and 68 % for oral polio vaccine, diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus, bacillus Calmette–Guérin, measles, yellow fever and hepatitis B vaccines respectively collected from Imo State. The mice immunized with oral polio vaccine, pentavalent, bacillus Calmette–Guérin, measles, yellow fever and hepatitis B vaccines collected from Abia State had 123 %, 114 %, 121 %, 116 %, 142 % and 119 % weight gain respectively compared with the control. Leukocytosis promoting toxicity test showed that none <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vaccines</b> was able to induce proliferation of leukocytes up to ten folds.
