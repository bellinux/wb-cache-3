5|$|Chesma (Russian: Чесма, {{sometimes}} transliterated as Tchesma) was {{the second}} ship <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>s</b> built for the Imperial Russian Navy in the 1880s. When the ship was completed she proved to be very overweight which meant that much of her waterline armor belt was submerged. Russian companies could not produce the most advanced armour and machinery desired by the Naval General Staff, so they were imported from the United Kingdom and Belgium. Chesma spent her career {{as part of the}} Black Sea Fleet.|$|E

5|$|France was {{the last}} ship <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>s,</b> the first dreadnoughts built for the French Navy. She was {{completed}} just before World War I {{as part of the}} 1911 naval building programme. She spent the war in the Mediterranean, covering the Otranto Barrage in the Adriatic. France, accompanied by her sister ship , was sent to the Black Sea in 1919 to oppose the Bolsheviks during the Russian Civil War. Her crew briefly mutinied in April 1919 from a combination of war-weariness, Communist sympathizers in the crew and difficult conditions. The mutiny and general lack of morale among her crew caused her to return to France later that month. Striking an uncharted rock off the French coast in 1922, she foundered four hours later.|$|E
5|$|HMS Audacious was {{the lead}} ship <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>s</b> built for the Royal Navy in the late 1860s. They were {{designed}} as second-class ironclads suitable for use on foreign stations and the ship spent the bulk of her career on the China Station. She was decommissioned in 1894 and hulked in 1902 {{for use as a}} training ship. The ship was towed to Scapa Flow after the beginning of the First World War {{to be used as a}} receiving ship and then to Rosyth after the war ended. Audacious was sold for scrap in 1929.|$|E
5|$|HMS Swordfish was {{developed}} to meet a requirement of Royal Navy's Submarine Committee for a large submarine capable of operating with the fleet at a surfaced speed of 20 knots. Most of the earlier British submarines had been single-hulled vessels built by Vickers, and the Navy was interested in evaluating other designs. Captain Roger Keyes, Inspecting Captain of Submarines, had previously served as naval attaché in Italy and had kept abreast of Italian submarine developments, which notably included double-hulled submarines designed by Cesare Laurenti of Fiat-San Giorgio. Three boats <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>S</b> class were ordered first and Laurenti was invited to submit a design to meet the RN requirement.|$|E

5|$|Kalinin {{was one of}} the Project 26bis2 cruisers, {{the third}} pair <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>s.</b> She was larger and had a more {{powerful}} anti-aircraft armament than her half-sisters. She was assembled at the newly constructed Shipyard 199, Komsomolsk-on-Amur, from components built at the Shipyard 198 (Marti South) in Nikolayev. She was laid down on 12 August 1938, launched from drydock on 8 May 1942 and was completed on 31 December 1942 after being towed down the Amur River to Vladivostok. Her construction was prolonged by late deliveries from western factories. For example, her propellers had to be shipped from Leningrad after it had been surrounded by the Germans and her propeller shafts had to be removed from the Barrikada factory in Stalingrad in 1942 before it was destroyed by the Germans.|$|E

5|$|The Admiral-class battlecruisers were {{intended}} as improved versions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>s,</b> but were recast as battlecruisers after Admiral John Jellicoe, {{commander of the}} Grand Fleet, saw no real need for more battleships. A number of German battlecruisers had been laid down that were superior to {{the bulk of the}} Grand Fleet's battlecruisers so the design was revised to counter these. The class was going to consist of , Anson, Howe, and Rodney—all names of famous Admirals—but the latter three ships were suspended as the material and labour required to complete them was needed for higher-priority merchantmen and escort vessels. Their designs were updated to incorporate the lessons from the Battle of Jutland, but the Admiralty eventually decided that it was better to begin again with a clean-slate design so they were cancelled in 1919.|$|E

5|$|The O-class battlecruisers were {{designed}} in 1937 {{to supplement the}} s then planned for the new German fleet.
