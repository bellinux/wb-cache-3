5000|$|Computer Addiction can be {{described}} as the excessive or compulsive use of the computer which persists despite serious negative consequences for personal, social, or occupational function. Another clear conceptualization is made by Block, who stated that [...] "Conceptually, the diagnosis is a compulsive-impulsive spectrum disorder that involves online and/or <b>offline</b> computer <b>usage</b> and consists of at least three subtypes: excessive gaming, sexual preoccupations, and e-mail/text messaging". While it was expected that this new type of addiction would find a place under the compulsive disorders in the DSM-5, the current edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, it is still counted as an unofficial disorder. The concept of computer addiction is broadly divided in two types, namely offline computer addiction and online computer addiction. The term offline computer addiction is normally used when speaking about excessive gaming behavior, which can be practiced both offline and online. Online computer addiction, also known as Internet addiction, gets more attention in general from scientific research than offline computer addiction, mainly because most cases of computer addiction are related to the excessive use of the Internet.|$|R

More specifically, we constructed a model that surveyed the <b>offline</b> and online <b>usage</b> of prepaid e-cash, debit cards, credit cards and cash. User perceptions of the attractiveness of e-cash and various traditional payment means were also empirically assessed.

User perceptions of offline purchases with a payment technology had significant and positive effects on the corresponding online usage perceptions. The effects of our research model are contingent on the income level of users. Our findings have significant implications, as they could help shed light on why consumers abandon their shopping carts and do not complete their transactions, which could potentially play a significant role when it comes to designing applications targeting sspecific consumer segments.

40|$|In web {{recommender}} systems, clustering is done <b>offline</b> {{to extract}} <b>usage</b> patterns and a successful recommendation highly {{depends on the}} quality of this clustering solution. In these types of applications, data to be clustered {{is in the form of}} user sessions which are sequences of web pages visited by the user. Sequence clustering is one of the important tools to work with this type of data. One way to represent sequence data is through weighted, undirected graphs where each sequence is a vertex and the pairwise similarities between the user sessions are the edges. Through this representation, the problem becomes equivalent to graph partitioning which is NP-complete and is best approached using multiple objectives. Hence it is suitable to use multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEA) to solve it. The main focus of this paper is to determine an effective MOEA to cluster sequence data.

40|$|Abstract. Quantitative {{verification}} is {{an established}} automated technique that can ensure predictability and dependability of software systems which exhibit probabilistic behaviour. Since <b>offline</b> <b>usage</b> of quantitative verification is infeasible for large-scale complex systems that continuously {{adapt to the}} changing environment, quantitative runtime verification was proposed as an alternative. Using an illustrative case study of communicating, distributed probabilistic processes, we formulate the problem of quantitative steering, a runtime technique that involves system monitoring, prediction of future errors, and enforcement of system’s behaviour away from the error states. We consider a communicationbased variant of steering where enforcement is achieved by modifying the contents of communication channels. Our approach is based on stochastic games, where one player is the system and the other players {{assume the role of}} the controller, and hence steering reduces to finding a controller strategy that meets the given quantitative goal. We discuss the solution to the quantitative steering problem and its extensions inspired by complex real-world scenarios. ...|$|E

This includes support for sequential interaction, multimedia input and output, asynchronous messaging and a universally familiar numeric keypad. However, we argue that the WWW as currently conceived may be an inappropriate model for delivering mobile information services in this context. We highlight a number of tensions we have observed between the traditional web model, and the design synergies that we have uncovered. To demonstrate an alternative framework, we describe CAM — a platform for delivering mobile information services in the rural developing world. Supporting scripted execution, media-driven, tangible interaction {{as well as an}} <b>offline</b> <b>usage</b> model, CAM is uniquely adapted both to rural accessibility requirements and the inherent capabilities of mobile phones.

A MoC defines how tight two people can work together and how much {{the rest of the group}} can demand to know about a programmer. Different MoCs are ordered in a spectrum from single user's <b>offline</b> <b>usage</b> up to concurrent editing of the same source code. Special emphasis is put on balancing gains and efforts that are related to a specific MoC. The second part of the paper presents how MoCs are implemented in the distributed co-operative software development environment TUKAN.

The energy deposited by the particles in TileCal is read out by approximately 10, 000 channels. The signal provided by the readout electronics for each channel is digitized at 40 MHz and its amplitude is estimated by an optimal filtering algorithm. The increase of LHC luminosity leads to signal pile-up that deforms the signal of interest and compromises the amplitude estimation performance. This work presents the proposed algorithm for energy estimation during LHC Run 2. The method is based on the same approach used during LHC Run 1, namely the Optimal Filter (OF). The only difference is that the signal baseline (pedestal) will be subtracted from the received digitized samples, while in Run 1 this quantity was estimated on an event-by-event basis. The pedestal value is estimated through special calibration runs and it is stored in a data base for online and <b>offline</b> <b>usage.</b> Additionally, the background covariance matrix will also be used for the computation of the OF weights for high occupancy channels.

40|$|Purpose – Although the {{influence}} of using multiple channels on customer behavior has been investigated, most of this {{research has focused on}} channel behavior within a single company. Customers however frequently have access to multiple providers amongst which they can choose to allocate their spending in a category. Prior research therefore has neglected to understand what happens when a multichannel customer also chooses to conduct business with multiple companies. This research investigates the moderating influence of both multichannel and multicompany usage on the impact that customer satisfaction has on share of wallet (SOW). Design/methodology/approach - The data used in the analyses was collected as part of both survey and transactional data of 802 households of a large financial services provider. Within class regression models were employed to test the moderating effects of different segments that were identified based on multichannel-multicompany customer differences. Findings – The findings confirm that using multiple channels has an overall positive moderating impact on the satisfaction – SOW link and that customer satisfaction matters more when the customer adopts multiple channels; online channel usage in addition to <b>offline</b> <b>usage.</b> Furthermore, this effect is even more pronounced for customers that transact with multiple providers. That is, the group of customers that use both the company’s and competitors’ offline and online channels reveal a higher satisfaction - SOW association than the group of customers that only adopted the offline channel with the company and competitor. Research limitations/implications – The limitation is that this research examines a single industry. The results however clearly show the need for future research to account for both multichannel and multicompany differences to fully understand the effect of customer satisfaction on share of wallet. Originality/value – There are two major differences of the paper compared to what has already been done in the literature: (1) It examines the impact of both multichannel and multicompany usage, which has never been investigated before; (2) It examines the moderating impact of these variables on the satisfaction - behavior link / relationship as opposed to the direct effect on satisfaction or behavior separately or in isolation. This research also provides important managerial guidance on the need to capture customers’ multicompany preferences and how to more efficiently allocate budgets in creating satisfaction with the goal of ensuring higher share of spending by taking on a more targeted approach.

40|$|As {{early as}} 1887 the German Agriculture Society (Deutsche Landwirtschafts-Gesellschaft DLG) {{carried out the}} first {{examination}} of food with a competition. Since the DLG was refounded in 1954 it has continued to pursue its goal {{to improve the quality}} standard of German food. The stated objective of the voluntary quality competitions for meat products, ready-to-serve meals, frozen food and delicacies, to support manufacturing and sales of highquality products, is realized by a comparative sensory analysis. Up to now, participants of the DLG Quality Competitions receive standardized expert?s reports about the condition of the product tested and any imperfections noted, but give no indication in which way these could be improved. In order for food producers to take remedial action and to further improve the quality of meat products with more definitive advice, the German Agriculture Society together with the Institute of Food Hygiene at the "Freie Universität Berlin" has suggested the development of the programme summarised below. This body of work describes the experience gained in developing the programme and documents the final results. The "Information Programme for addressing imperfections in the production of sausages" has been developed to be a multimedia compendium of "sausage technology". For each of the approximately 160 imperfections listed in DLG?s examination regulations, suggestions to remedy any imperfections in the manufacturing process are offered. This multimedia textbook was conceived for the instruction at universities, universities for applied science, vocational schools, and technical training centres, but also as a practical help for the butcher?s trade and for the meat product?s industry. The following issues have been experienced during the creation of this programme: 1. As there are approximately 160 individually mentioned imperfections listed in DLG?s examination regulations for sausages, these were assigned individual chapters. The entire text contains approximately 150 printed pages. 2. Searching for and finding information has been laid out as simply and as userfriendly as possible by a page with search function and a clear indication of search results. 3. Associated errors in sausage production are listed in entirity and hyperlinked with each other, {{in such a way that}} you can read through them in sequence. 4. Technical terms are also integrated into the text with hyperlinks to their definition, and indeed a complete dictionary of all technical terms. This "Encyclopedia of Terms" amounts to 12 printed pages. 5. The examination regulations of DLG valid at present, which have been included in the textbook, give an insight into the process of the quality examinations of DLG. 6. In order to interest as wide a group of users as possible with and elicit a good response, and taking into account current development within the IT community, programming of this multimedia textbook has been performed in such a way (in HTML and JavaScript) to allow for both online and <b>offline</b> <b>usage</b> by Internet and CD-ROM. As the target group stretches from butcher?s apprentices, through students and food technologists to butchers, in the entire programme a simple, easily comprehensible language without acronyms and abbreviations has been used.
