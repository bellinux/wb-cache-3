5|$|The routing of VT17 varies greatly on <b>opposite</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bristol town center. West of Bristol, {{the route}} passes through {{generally}} level terrain and connects multiple communities. East of Bristol, VT17 is more mountainous and more rural in nature.|$|E
5|$|A ship {{received}} {{by a pair}} of induction coils hung on <b>opposite</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ship, and fed through an amplifier into a headset (see diagram, below). By switching between coils, the relative strength of the signal on each side could be compared. The ship maintained a course parallel to the cable by maneuvering to keep the signal strength constant.|$|E
5|$|A {{resolution}} to this apparent inconsistency {{is offered by}} inflationary theory in which a homogeneous and isotropic scalar energy field dominates the universe at some very early period (before baryogenesis). During inflation, the universe undergoes exponential expansion, and the particle horizon expands much more rapidly than previously assumed, so that regions presently on <b>opposite</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> observable universe are well inside each other's particle horizon. The observed isotropy of the CMB then follows {{from the fact that}} this larger region was in causal contact before the beginning of inflation.|$|E

5|$|De Lacy {{witnessed}} charters of the Empress in 1141. During {{the later}} 1140s, de Lacy {{was able to}} recover many of his father's Welsh marcher lands, {{and one of his}} efforts at Ludlow was later embroidered in the medieval romance Fouke le Fitz Waryn. He and Miles of Gloucester were claimants to many of the same lands, and during Stephen's reign were generally on <b>opposite</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> succession dispute. In June 1153, de Lacy was in the company of Matilda's son, Henry fitzEmpress, who became King Henry II of England in 1154.|$|E
5|$|In 1851 the Florida Legislature {{voted to}} {{establish}} two seminaries {{of higher education}} on <b>opposite</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Suwannee River. Francis W. Eppes and other city leaders established an all-male academy called the Florida Institute in Tallahassee as a legislative inducement to locate the West Florida Seminary in Tallahassee. The East Florida Seminary opened in Ocala in 1853, closed in 1861, and reopened in Gainesville in 1866. The East Florida Seminary is the institution to which the modern University of Florida traces its foundation.|$|E
5|$|The Continental Divide of North America runs diagonally {{through the}} southwestern {{part of the}} park. The divide is a {{topographic}} feature that separates Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean water drainages. About {{one third of the}} park lies {{on the west side of}} the divide. The origins of the Yellowstone and Snake Rivers are near each other but on <b>opposite</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> divide. As a result, the waters of the Snake River flow to the Pacific Ocean, while those of the Yellowstone find their way to the Atlantic Ocean via the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E

5|$|The {{arrival of}} the French in the south {{threatened}} existing trade links that Carolina colonists had established into the interior, creating tension among all three powers. France and Spain, allies in this conflict, had been on <b>opposite</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> recently ended Nine Years' War. Conflicting territorial claims between Carolina and Florida south of the Savannah River were overlaid by animosity over religious divisions between the Roman Catholic Spanish and the Protestant English along the coast.|$|E

5|$|The second arc is {{the story}} of Larc and Sierra—brother and sister dragoons who serve {{different}} dragon masters and fight on <b>opposite</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same war for power. Larc serves the dragon Drakonis, who wants to kill the other three dragons so that he can rule the world. Larc blackmails the game's protagonist to help him in this quest. Sierra, a dragoon for Vadise the White Dragon, wants to stop Drakonis without hurting her brother Larc. In the end, Drakonis is defeated again and banished to the underworld, and Larc is killed.|$|E

5|$|A {{pendulum}} hangs straight downwards in a symmetrical gravitational field. However, if {{a sufficiently}} large mass {{such as a}} mountain is nearby, its gravitational attraction should pull the pendulum's plumb-bob slightly out of true. The change in plumb-line angle against a known objectsuch as a starcould be carefully measured on <b>opposite</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mountain. If {{the mass of the}} mountain could be independently established from a determination of its volume and an estimate of the mean density of its rocks, then these values could be extrapolated to provide the mean density of the Earth, and by extension, its mass.|$|E
5|$|Because a Leslie speaker modifies {{as well as}} amplifies the sound, {{the output}} cannot simply be {{connected}} to a larger PA system if the volume onstage from the built-in amplifier is too quiet. This is particularly problematic for an older Leslie like the 122 or 147, which only has a 40 watt RMS power amplifier. Instead, microphones are placed around the Leslie, and the output from these {{is connected to the}} PA. A typical setup for onstage miking is to use two microphones placed on <b>opposite</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> horn and a single microphone on the drum.|$|E
5|$|Having {{ensured that}} {{sufficient}} tissue {{has been removed}} to allow the desired fusion of the skin, the circumciser pulls together the <b>opposite</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> labia majora, ensuring that the raw edges where the skin has been removed are well approximated. The wound is now ready to be stitched or for thorns to be applied. If a needle and thread are being used, close tight sutures will be placed {{to ensure that a}} flap of skin covers the vulva and extends from the mons veneris to the perineum, and which, after the wound heals, will form a bridge of scar tissue that will totally occlude the vaginal introitus.|$|E

5|$|Lépine {{sat for a}} time in {{the office}} of the {{registrar}} on the second floor. He was seen rummaging through a plastic bag and did not speak to anyone, even when a staff member asked if she could help him. He left the office and was subsequently seen in other parts of the building before entering a second floor mechanical engineering class of about sixty students at about 5:10p.m. After approaching the student giving a presentation, he asked everyone to stop everything and ordered the women and men to <b>opposite</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> classroom. No one moved at first, believing it to be a joke until he fired a shot into the ceiling.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 2003, {{the tournament}} format was a Limit Hold'em tournament, but in 2004, No-Limit Hold'em became the standard. The 2006 tournament, with 1,232 entrants, {{was the largest}} field ever for the event. Since its inception, with the {{exception}} of 2008, the Casino Employees event has started {{on the first day of}} the WSOP. Much of the drama encountered at the Casino Championship often involves informal rivaliries between dealers and proposition players. Proposition players are people hired to play poker, with their own money, at casinos to get games started or to ensure that they do not die out. Thus, while both the prop and dealer are casino employees, they sit on <b>opposite</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> table.|$|E
5|$|After Aornos, Alexander {{crossed the}} Indus and fought and won an epic battle against King Porus, who ruled a region lying between the Hydaspes and the Acesines (Chenab), {{in what is}} now the Punjab, in the Battle of the Hydaspes in 326BC. Alexander was {{impressed}} by Porus' bravery, and made him an ally. He appointed Porus as satrap, and added to Porus' territory land that he did not previously own, towards the south-east, up to the Hyphasis (Beas). Choosing a local helped him control these lands so distant from Greece. Alexander founded two cities on <b>opposite</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hydaspes river, naming one Bucephala, in honour of his horse, who died around this time. The other was Nicaea (Victory), thought to be located at the site of modern-day Mong, Punjab.|$|E

5|$|As {{the weather}} synoptics of the {{northern}} Pacific Ocean transitioned into a late-fall to early winter-type pattern, convection from the monsoon trough extended {{to the east of}} the International Date Line. During late November, a westerly disturbance developed into twin troughs on <b>opposite</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> equator; the one in the Southern Hemisphere ultimately developed into Tropical Cyclone Pam, while the one in the Northern Hemisphere formed into an area of convection about 2000km (1240mi) southwest of Hawaii. The disturbance gradually organized as it drifted north-northeastward, and on November 28 it developed into Tropical Depression Five-C about 465km (290mi) west-northwest of Palmyra Atoll. Operationally, the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) did not begin issuing warnings on the system until December 2.|$|E
5|$|Capella {{is closer}} to the north {{celestial}} pole than any other first magnitude star. Its northern declination is such that it is actually invisible south of latitude 44°S—this includes southernmost New Zealand, Argentina and Chile as well as the Falkland Islands. Conversely it is circumpolar north of 44°N: for the whole of the United Kingdom, Canada and the northernmost United States, the star never sets. Capella and Vega are on <b>opposite</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pole, at about the same distance from it, such that an imaginary line between the two stars will nearly pass through Polaris. Visible halfway between the Belt of Orion and Polaris, Capella is at its highest in the night sky at midnight in early December and is regarded as a prominent star of the winter sky in the northern hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{repeated}} efforts, the French Navy {{failed to}} reinforce and resupply the garrison, as their ships were intercepted and defeated either in European waters {{or in the}} Caribbean itself. The British had intercepted {{a number of these}} messages, and launched a series of successful invasions during 1809, until Guadeloupe was the only French colony remaining. A British expeditionary force landed on 28 January 1810, and found that much of the island's militia garrison had deserted. Advancing from two landing beaches on <b>opposite</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> island, they were able to rapidly push inland. It was not until they reached Beaupère–St. Louis Ridge outside the capital Basse-Terre that the expeditionary force faced strong opposition, but in a battle lasting for most of 3 February, the French were defeated and driven back. The island's commander, Jean Augustin Ernouf, began surrender negotiations the following day.|$|E
