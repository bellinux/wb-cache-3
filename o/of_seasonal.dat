40|$|Abstract. In the Ocean, the {{seasonal}} cycle is the mode that couples climate forcing to ecosystem response in production, diversity and carbon export. A better characterisation <b>of</b> the ecosystem’s <b>seasonal</b> cycle therefore addresses an important gap {{in our ability}} to estimate the sensitivity of the biological pump to climate change. In this study, the regional charac-teristics <b>of</b> the <b>seasonal</b> cycle <b>of</b> phytoplankton biomass in the Southern Ocean are examined in terms of the timing of the bloom initiation, its amplitude, regional scale variabil-ity and the importance <b>of</b> the climatological <b>seasonal</b> cycle in explaining the overall variance. The seasonal cycle was consequently defined into four broad zonal regions; the sub-tropical zone (STZ), the transition zone (TZ), the Antarctic circumpolar zone (ACZ) and the marginal ice zone (MIZ). Defining the Southern Ocean according to the characteristics <b>of</b> its <b>seasonal</b> cycle provides a more dynamic understanding of ocean productivity based on underlying physical drivers rather than climatological biomass. The response of the biol-ogy to the underlying physics <b>of</b> the different <b>seasonal</b> zones resulted in an additional classification of four regions based on the extent <b>of</b> inter-annual <b>seasonal</b> phase locking and the magnitude <b>of</b> the integrated <b>seasonal</b> biomass. This regional-isation contributes towards an improved understanding of the regional differences in the sensitivity of the Southern Oceans ecosystem to climate forcing, potentially allowing more ro-bust predictions of the effects of long term climate trends. ...|$|R

5|$|Pigments are {{coloured}} chemicals (such as melanin) {{in animal}} tissues. For example, the Arctic fox has a white coat in winter (containing little pigment), and a brown coat in summer (containing more pigment), an example <b>of</b> <b>seasonal</b> camouflage (a polyphenism). Many animals, including mammals, birds, and amphibians, {{are unable to}} synthesize most of the pigments that colour their fur or feathers, other than the brown or black melanins that give many mammals their earth tones. For example, the bright yellow of an American goldfinch, the startling orange of a juvenile red-spotted newt, the deep red of a cardinal and the pink of a flamingo are all produced by carotenoid pigments synthesized by plants. In {{the case of the}} flamingo, the bird eats pink shrimps, which are themselves unable to synthesize carotenoids. The shrimps derive their body colour from microscopic red algae, which like most plants are able to create their own pigments, including both carotenoids and (green) chlorophyll. Animals that eat green plants do not become green, however, as chlorophyll does not survive digestion.|$|E

In 1997 Grand Forks suffered the most damage of any major city in the Red River Valley. During the height of the flooding, a major fire destroyed eleven buildings in the downtown area. The government began developing a new levee system to protect the city, which was completed ten years later.

40|$|We explore {{implications}} for modeling and noise analysis <b>of</b> stochastic <b>seasonal</b> processes <b>of</b> climatic origin in geodetic time series. Seasonal signals are generally modeled as sinusoids with annual periods (and harmonics thereof), each with constant amplitude and phase. However, environmental noise that underlies the seasonal signal in geodetic time series has a reddened {{power spectral density}} (PSD). We investigate {{the form of the}} PSD of a time series having a stochastic seasonal component and find that for frequencies greater than the nominal seasonal frequency, the PSD of the time series reflects the PSD <b>of</b> the <b>seasonal</b> amplitudes. For example, if the PSD <b>of</b> the <b>seasonal</b> amplitudes can be expressed as an inverse power law, then the PSD of the time series will behave as an inverse power law for high frequencies. Stochastic seasonal variability will also induce a peak near the nominal seasonal frequency in addition to that <b>of</b> the mean <b>seasonal</b> signal and will be relatively flat below this frequency. It is therefore possible that some of the noise in Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) time series reported by others may be associated with neglecting the stochastic component <b>of</b> the <b>seasonal</b> signal. We use a GNSS time series from site ZIMM as an example to demonstrate the existence <b>of</b> a variable <b>seasonal</b> signal (without attributing its cause), and we use an example Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) time series from Alaska to demonstrate that use <b>of</b> a nonstochastic <b>seasonal</b> model can {{have a significant impact on}} the value and uncertainty of time-variable rates estimated from the time serie...|$|R

As ethanol fuel economy is lower than gasoline because of ethanol's energy content is close to 34% less per unit volume than gasoline, flex cars running on ethanol get a lower mileage than when running on pure gasoline. However, this effect is partially offset by the usually lower price per liter of ethanol fuel. As a rule of thumb, Brazilian consumers are frequently advised by the media to use more alcohol than gasoline in their mix only when ethanol prices are 30% lower or more than gasoline, as ethanol price fluctuates heavily depending on the result <b>of</b> <b>seasonal</b> sugar cane harvests.|$|E
5|$|When {{the last}} glacial period ended, the hunter gatherers of the Palaeolithic period {{followed}} the animal herds {{across the land}} between continental Europe and Britain.

Until about 6,000BC, Mesolithic people appear to have exploited their environment as they found it. As communities came {{to rely on a}} smaller territorial range and as population levels increased, attempts began to be made to modify or control the natural world.

5|$|Attempts {{to catalog}} Atlantic hurricanes {{in the first}} half of the 19th century began as early as 1855, when Andrés Poey {{compiled}} information on just over 400 tropical cyclones from 1493 to 1855. However, Poey listed only three of the five or more hurricanes that developed in 1850. In his 1963 book, Early American Hurricanes, 1492–1870, weather researcher David M. Ludlum discusses, in greater detail, three significant tropical cyclones that impacted the United States in 1850. Unusually, all three heavily impacted the northeastern states; Ludlum compares the season to 1954, in which three major tropical systems impacted the Eastern Seaboard. More traditional hurricane targets, such as Florida, were spared the brunt <b>of</b> <b>seasonal</b> tropical cyclone activity in 1850, while the atmosphere farther north was abnormally tropical. Newark, New Jersey, had its warmest—and one of its rainiest—summers on record at the time, owing to frequent nearby hurricanes and the influx of tropical air. Meteorological reports pertaining to the season were largely lost in a Smithsonian Institution fire in 1856, limiting what is known about hurricane activity in 1850. As the season falls outside the scope of the Atlantic hurricane database (1851 onward) and its associated reanalysis project, records are regarded as incomplete. Extant accounts of the storms in 1850 are chiefly based on private weather records and press reports, and only approximate storm tracks are known.|$|E
