5000|$|According to the Handbook of Texas, {{the area}} was settled around 1880, but {{it is likely that}} no {{distinct}} community formed until 1883, when the tracks of the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway were extended through the area.

5000|$|McGuffey {{became a}} [...] "roving" [...] {{teacher at the}} age of 14, {{beginning}} with 48 students in a one-room school in Calcutta, Ohio and at a seminary in the town of Poland, Ohio. The size of the class was just one of several challenges which the young McGuffey faced. In many <b>one-teacher</b> <b>schools,</b> students' ages varied from six to 21. McGuffey often worked 11 hours a day, six days a week, in a succession of frontier schools, primarily in the state of Kentucky. Students brought their own books, most frequently the Bible, since few textbooks existed.|$|R
50|$|The first schools {{started to}} appear during the 1830s {{throughout}} the state, {{in the form}} of <b>one-teacher</b> <b>schools.</b> The oldest government-sponsored education institution in Western Australia, Guildford Colonial School (now Guildford Primary School), was founded at the Swan River Colony in 1833, and consisted of several premises in the townsite before a purpose built school was constructed in 1870. From the 1850s schools became more common around Western Australia, with many of the teachers being sourced from educated convicts who had obtained their ticket of leave. Initially there were no official qualifications required to teach, only that a teacher be literate, and many schools were run by nuns or single women.|$|R

40|$|Transactional {{strategies}} instruction {{underline the}} importance of an interactive environment for student’s learning within the school context. Such discussion involves teaching of cognitive processes in {{coming to terms with}} the text within a group situation and stimulates interpretative dialogues that prompt students’ inferential comprehension. This study aims to compare and describe the text processing strategies taking place in multi-grade and single-grade Greek Primary Schools in Modern Greek Language studies. Both text extending and text focused discussion take place, yet children’s participation during interactive discussion is considerably low. No differences were found between multi-grade and single-grade schools. Significant differences were found between <b>one-teacher’s</b> <b>schools</b> and two-teachers’ schools which, it appears, were due to the teaching style of the particular teachers, rather than the type of school...|$|R

40|$|Master of EducationThis {{thesis is}} an oral history {{study of the}} lives of six women who taught in oneteacher schools in Victoria in the 1930 s and 1940 s. Much has been written about women {{teachers}} in the nineteenth century, but {{there seems to be a}} dearth of literature on twentieth century women. In much of the literature examined, female teachers who taught in <b>one-teacher</b> <b>schools</b> at the turn of the century were depicted as disadvantaged in many ways. They experienced difficulties with accommodation, loneliness and low salaries. They were often inadequately educated themselves and those who wanted to make a career out of teaching suffered because of their isolation from professional development and opportunities to further their own education. The women interviewed for this study taught in schools in different parts of Victoria during the 1930 s and 1940 s. Their names were obtained from friends and colleagues. They are a small group, but their experiences are important and can help us to understand the history of the teaching profession more generally. These women are aged between seventy-eight and ninety-one. Their memories are fragmentary but they are very clear on some aspects of their teaching lives. They exhibit the reticence of earlier generations of women teachers who believed it was bad manners to `rain on the parade'. These women, in general, gave positive accounts of their time teaching in <b>one-teacher</b> <b>schools.</b> They enjoyed the authority that came with being in charge. They talked about being a respected member of the community; some married locals and settled into the community. Their accommodation was more convivial than that of their sisters in the nineteenth century and most women talked about becoming life-long friends with the families who boarded them. These women felt there was a lack of choice of career - they could either be teachers or nurses - and their careers were cut short by the marriage bar. All these women had to resign on marriage, and those who returned to teaching were re-employed and exploited as temporary teachers on a lower rate of pay. Nevertheless, equal pay was not an issue for these women and they accepted four-fifths the male salary as `how it was'. Overall, these women retold positive aspects of their lives in <b>one-teacher</b> <b>schools</b> and the meaning of teaching in their lives. They were proud of their careers although it was accepted that most women would become wives and mothers. These are stories of women who received great personal satisfaction from teaching and who took enormous pride in their work. Those who returned to teaching some time after their marriage, spoke of the fulfilment gained from resuming their chosen career. Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|R
