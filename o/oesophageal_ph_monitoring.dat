40|$|BACKGROUND—Monitoring {{oesophageal}} pH conventionally detects "acid reflux" (pH {{less than}} 4). The pH of the gastric contents determines {{whether or not}} reflux can be detected.  AIM—To monitor gastric and oesophageal pH simultaneously {{in order to determine}} the effect of milk feeds on gastric pH and how this would influence interpretation of the oesophageal pH record.  METHODS—Milk fed infants for whom <b>oesophageal</b> <b>pH</b> <b>monitoring</b> was requested underwent simultaneous gastric and <b>oesophageal</b> <b>pH</b> <b>monitoring</b> using a dual channel pH probe.  RESULTS—Twenty of 24 records were technically satisfactory. Mean reflux index was 1. 0 %, range 0. 0 - 4. 0 %. Gastric pH was less than 4 for 24. 5 % (range 0. 6 - 69. 1 %) of the total time. The average time the gastric pH was greater than 4 after feeds was 130 minutes (range 29 - 212 minutes). The corrected reflux index (limited to the time the gastric pH was less than 4) was 2. 6 % (range 0. 0 - 11. 0 %).  CONCLUSION—The pH of the gastric contents may be greater than 4 for prolonged intervals, during which <b>oesophageal</b> <b>pH</b> <b>monitoring</b> using current criteria cannot detect reflux nor correlate it with clinical events. A low reflux index may reflect prolonged buffering of gastric acidity rather than the absence of reflux. ...|$|E

40|$|Acid reflux and/or oesophagitis may be {{responsible}} for inconsolable crying in infants. We evaluated prospectively the presence of acid reflux disease, oesophagitis and the accuracy of pH monitoring in the prediction of oesophagitis in a population of irritable infants. A 24 -h <b>oesophageal</b> <b>pH</b> <b>monitoring</b> with a glass electrode and an upper gastro-intestinal tract endoscopy with grasp biopsies were performed in 60 irritable infants, aged 1 to 6 months, not responding to cow's milk elimination. The 24 -h <b>oesophageal</b> <b>pH</b> <b>monitoring</b> was considered abnormal in 40 / 60 (66 %) babies and histological oesophagitis was present in 26 / 60 (43 %). In the infants with histological oesophagitis, the reflux index (% of the investigation time with a pH 5 % in 18 / 26 (69 %). Histology of the oesophagus was normal in 22 of the 40 (55 %) infants with an abnormal pH monitoring. The mean reflux index in the group with oesophagitis (12. 20 %) was significantly higher than in the group with normal histology (8. 74) (P = 0. 036), although there was an important overlap. The sensitivity and specificity to predict oesophagitis with a reflux index of 5. 0 % or more was 69. 2 and 35. 3, respectively. There was not a reflux index which could be related to a clinically useful sensitivity and specificity to predict oesophagitis. Conclusion: Acid gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and/or histological oesophagitis were diagnosed in 66 % and 43 % of irritable infants, respectively. There was no relation between symptoms and abnormal pH metry or oesophagitis; however, the reflux index does not accurately predict oesophagitis and normal histology does not accurately exclude acid gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. <b>Oesophageal</b> <b>pH</b> <b>monitoring</b> and endoscopy provide additional information. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

40|$|Effect of Helicobacter pylori {{eradication}} on oesophageal peristalsis, lower oesophageal sphincter {{pressure and}} 3 -hour postprandial pH monitoring. INTRODUCTION Helicobacter pylori (Hp) {{has been shown}} to be an aetiological factor in gastrointestinal diseases such as gastritis, peptic ulcer, mucosa- associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma and gastric cancer. Eradication of Hp infection has been recommended to prevent and/or to treat these diseases. Despite the reports that reduced acid secretion related to H. pylori corpus gastritis might protect from reflux oesophagitis and reports of reflux oesophagitis occurring after H. pylori eradication, the pathogenesis and possible relationship of Hp infection with reflux oesophagitis remains controversial. MATERIALS AND METHODS We evaluated oesophageal function amongst Hp infected Greek patients before and after Hp eradication and compared these results to Hp negative Greek patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GORD). We introduced the 3 -hour postprandial <b>oesophageal</b> <b>pH</b> <b>monitoring</b> as a more flexible and well tolerable test to evaluate the presence of GORD in this group of patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between Hp infection and reflux oesophagitis.

40|$|OBJECTIVES—Oesophageal <b>pH</b> <b>monitoring</b> is {{the gold}} {{standard}} technique {{for the detection of}} gastro-oesophageal reflux in adults and children.

In 16 patients with symptomatic gastro-oesophageal reflux, cisapride 10 mg orally and placebo were studied on separate days according to identical protocols. Cisapride and placebo were given 30 minutes before a standard meal. Each study day was preceded by corresponding three day oral loading of cisapride (10 mg tds) or placebo.

Twenty four hour ambulatory <b>oesophageal</b> <b>pH</b> <b>monitoring</b> was performed in 26 patients with Barrett's columnar lined lower oesophagus and combined with 24 hour ambulatory gastric pH monitoring in 16. Ten of the 26 with Barrett's columnar lined lower oesophagus had complications including stricture (eight), deep ulceration (one), and carcinoma (one). Oesophageal acid exposure (% time 0. 05).

The predominant bile acids detected were cholic, taurocholic, and glycocholic acids but there was a significantly greater proportion of secondary bile acids, deoxycholic and taurodeoxycholic acids, in patients with erosive oesophagitis and Barrett's oesophagus/stricture. Although bile acid reflux episodes occurred at variable pH, a temporal relation existed between reflux of taurine conjugates and oesophageal acid exposure (r= 0. 58, p= 0. 009).  CONCLUSION—Toxic secondary bile acid fractions have been detected in patients with extensive mucosal damage.

40|$|SUMMARY Distal <b>oesophageal</b> <b>pH</b> was <b>monitored</b> {{for three}} hours after a {{standard}} meal in 10 young healthy subjects without symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux. Episodes of reflux occurred in nine of these subjects; and, in five, oesophageaJ pH was less than 5 for between 11 and 75 % of the first postprandial hour. Intermittent incompetence of the lower oesophageal sphincter after food must, therefore, {{be regarded as a}} normal phenomenon. The method described would be suitable for the evaluation of agents believed to weaken or to strengthen the lower oesophageal sphincter. Repeated exposure of oesophageal mucosa to gastric contents may lead to reflux oesophagitis, especially if exposure is prolonged because of poor oesophageal emptying, or if gastric contents are unusually noxious. A prerequisite for the development ofgastro-oesophageal reflux is incompetence of the lower oesophageal sphincter, the control of which remains poorly understood, despite intensive study. Though it is often tacitly assumed that the normal lower oesophageal sphincter provides an effective barrier to reflux at all times except during eructation and vomiting, this assumption has received little investi-gation. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether or not the normal lower oesophageal sphinc-ter remains continuously competent under physio-logical conditions, and thereby to provide a more solid basis for the definition of incompetence of the lower oesophageal sphincter; and to devise a test applicable to the investigation of physiological and pharmacological influences upon its competence...|$|R

Method: pH monitoring using a glass electrode and an antimony electrode was performed in 60 distressed infants, aged between 1 and 6 months. An upper endoscopy with oesophageal biopsies was also performed in all infants. Results: A reflux index (percentage of the total time with pH 5 % with the glass electrode in 18 / 26 children with histological oesophagitis and with the antimony electrode in 10 / 26 children with histological oesophagitis. Histology of the oesophagus was normal in 22 / 40 children with abnormal pH monitoring. With the glass electrode, the mean reflux index in the group with oesophagitis was significantly higher than in the group with normal histology, although there was an important overlap. With the antimony electrode, the mean reflux indices in the groups with and without oesophagitis were not different. Regarding normal/abnormal, there was discordance in 35 % of the pH studies. No reflux index could be related to a clinically useful sensitivity and specificity to predict oesophagitis.

40|$|Background—Both {{acid and}} {{duodenal}} contents {{are thought to}} be responsible for the mucosal damage in Barrett's oesophagus, a condition often treated medically. However, {{little is known about the}} effect of omeprazole on duodenogastric reflux (DGR) and duodenogastro-oesophageal reflux (DGOR).  Aims—To study the effect of omeprazole 20 mg twice daily on DGR and DGOR, using the technique of ambulatory bilirubin monitoring.  Methods—Twenty three patients with Barrett's oesophagus underwent manometry followed by 24 hour <b>oesophageal</b> and gastric <b>pH</b> <b>monitoring.</b> In conjunction with <b>pH</b> <b>monitoring,</b> 11 patients (group 1) underwent oesophageal bilirubin monitoring and 12 patients (group 2) underwent gastric bilirubin monitoring, both before and during treatment with omeprazole 20 mg twice daily.  Results—In both groups there was a significant reduction in oesophageal acid (pH< 4) reflux (p< 0. 005) and a significant increase in the time gastric pH was above 4 (p< 0. 005). In group 1, median total oesophageal bilirubin exposure was significantly reduced from 28. 9 % to 2. 4 % (p< 0. 005). In group 2, median total gastric bilirubin exposure was significantly reduced from 24. 9 % to 7. 2 % (p< 0. 005).  Conclusions—Treatment of Barrett's oesophagus with omeprazole 20 mg twice daily results in a notable reduction in the exposure of the oesophagus to both acid and duodenal contents.

40|$|In {{this study}} 24 hour <b>oesophageal</b> <b>pH</b> and {{pressure}} <b>monitoring</b> {{was used to}} assess oesophageal motility and acid clearance in 27 patients with reflux oesophagitis (Savary-Miller grades I-IV), before and after healing of oesophagitis. After the first 24 hour study patients were treated with omeprazole 40 mg for 8 - 24 weeks. After endoscopically verified healing and withdrawing omeprazole for four days 24 hour monitoring was repeated. A total of 106, 630 pressure events was analysed. No significant differences were found for any of the motility variables, especially the number and the type of contractions, the peristaltic amplitude, duration, and propagation velocity did not show any changes. Separate analysis of motility variables before and after healing in the low and high grade oesophagitis groups yielded similar results. Oesophageal motor response to reflux was investigated by analysis of all contractions occurring in the two minute period after the onset of each reflux episode. Both motor response and oesophageal acid exposure (% time pH < 4, number of reflux episodes) did not change after healing of oesophagitis, thus implying that acid clearance remained unchanged.

METHODS: Combined 24 -h <b>oesophageal</b> impedance and <b>pH</b> <b>monitoring</b> was performed in 10 functional dyspepsia patients and 10 controls. Analysis of the impedance-pH signals included incidence of air swallows, belching, acid and non-acid reflux. RESULTS: The incidence of air swallows in functional dyspepsia patients were significantly higher compared with controls (153 +/- 15 vs. 79 +/- 10, P < 0. 001), while the incidence of liquid-only swallows were not significantly increased. The proportions of gas-containing reflux episodes (belches) and non-acid reflux episodes in functional dyspepsia patients were significantly higher when compared with controls (66. 4 vs. 44. 4 %, P = 0. 04 and 70. 1 vs. 45. 9 %, P = 0. 009, respectively). CONCLUSION: Patients with functional dyspepsia swallow air more frequently than controls and this is {{associated with an increased}} incidence of non-acid gaseous gastro-oesophageal reflu...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the clearance of gastric acid from the oesophagus in ambulant patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux. Eighteen patients with proved reflux disease were studied, nine with (group 1) and nine without (group 2) endoscopic oesophagitis. <b>Oesophageal</b> pressure and <b>pH</b> were recorded over 24 hours. Pressures were measured by a probe with five sensors: a 5 cm long sensor in the lower oesophageal sphincter, three sensors {{in the body of}} the oesophagus, and one at the pharynx to detect swallowing. <b>Oesophageal</b> <b>pH</b> was <b>monitored</b> 5 cm above the lower oesophageal sphincter. Manometric activities were classified as either peristaltic or ineffective. The latter included simultaneous, non-transmitted, and low amplitude peristaltic contractions. A reflux episode was defined as starting when pH fell to less than 4 and ending when the pH rose to 5. When the rise to pH 5 took place in three or more discrete steps after motor responses to gastro-oesophageal reflux, the pH steps were labelled as initial change (I), middle changes (M), and last change (L). A total of 595 episodes of gastro-oesophageal reflux and 1626 associated motor events were analysed. Of these, 1331 (81. 9 %) were classed as primary peristaltic activity, 174 (10. 7 %) as primary ineffective activity, 46 (2. 8 %) as secondary peristaltic activity, and 75 (4. 6 %) as secondary ineffective activity. There were no significant differences in initial change (p > 0. 05), middle changes (p > 0. 05), and last change (p > 0. 05) between group 1 and group 2. In all patients, the successive changes of pH in response to motor activity were significantly different (p = 0. 0001) between initial, middle, and last changes. Last change was significantly higher when compared with initial (p= 0. 001) and middle changes (p< 0. 001). Primary oesophageal peristalsis was the most frequent motor response to gastro-oesophageal reflux. The last motor activity during reflux showed the greatest change in pH...|$|R
40|$|Although the {{aetiology}} of Barrett's oesophagus or columnar line oesophagus (CLO), remains unknown, {{bile reflux}} has been implicated {{as a factor}} in its pathogenesis. This study aimed to detect alkaline reflux in gastro-oesophageal reflux patients using dual probe <b>pH</b> <b>monitoring.</b> Thirty patients with histologically diagnosed CLO, 15 age and sex matched patients with oesophagitis (grade 1 - 3), and 15 healthy volunteers were studied by dual probe, 18 hour <b>pH</b> <b>monitoring</b> and analysis of the bile acid content of oesophageal refluxate. Total acid exposure and acid exposure in the upright and supine postures were greater in CLO subjects than in oesophagitis patients and controls. Furthermore, the number of reflux episodes lasting more than five minutes and the duration of the longest reflux episode were significantly greater in the CLO subjects than the oesophagitis and control subjects. Nine subjects with CLO and oesophagitis, however, were not identified as refluxers, although six had a bile acid concentration in their oesophageal aspirate higher than the 95 th centile value of the controls. There was no correlation between the <b>oesophageal</b> <b>pH</b> and the bile acid contents of refluxate. It is concluded that dual probe <b>pH</b> <b>monitoring</b> is not useful in detecting alkaline refluxers. <b>pH</b> <b>monitoring,</b> although the only subjective test available to identify acid refluxers, is not a sufficiently sensitive test with which to define alkaline reflux...|$|R
