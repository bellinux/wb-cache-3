He initially called this project [...] "Lucerne-in-Quebec;" [...] subsequently {{came to be known}} as the Seigniory Club. Despite the 1929 Wall Street Crash of 1929, work on the planned wilderness retreat began, as planned, in early 1930. [...] The economic uncertainty did not delay the project, unlike many others, perhaps because the presidents of the Canadian Pacific Railway, the National Bank of Canada, the Bank of Montreal and the Royal Bank of Canada respectively, not to mention the Premier of Quebec, were all club directors. A special spur from the nearby CPR line had to be built to allow for the transport of red cedar logs and other supplies to the site. The Scandinavian log construction project was supervised by Finnish master-builder, Victor Nymark and construction manager Harold Landry Furst. Construction and woodworking teams worked in <b>overlapping</b> <b>shifts</b> around the clock using electric lighting at night.

5000|$|The first Hazelwood High School was {{completed}} in 1954, located at 1865 Dunn Road in unincorporated North St. Louis County; this area is also known locally as Spanish Lake. The building is still in use as a school - Hazelwood East Middle School. During the early 1960s, as farmland became subdivisions, more {{students enrolled in the}} district and a new high school was needed; the second Hazelwood High School was established in 1966 to deal with the rapid growth of the Hazelwood School District during that time. The first year it held 2515 students who were in the 10th to 12th grades. It was the only high school in the district and it quickly became overcrowded as the [...] "baby boomers" [...] reached high school age. By the mid 1970s, the Central designator appeared in the school's name, followed by East and West, indicating from which portion of the district students lived. The rapid growth of the district proved too much even for a building of Hazelwood's size, however, and in 1974, the school was forced to split the student body into two shifts, with one shift attending from 6:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m., and one from 1:05 p.m. to 7:05 p.m. Later, <b>overlapping</b> <b>shifts</b> were used with a one-hour stating time change because they could not get 100% of the students in nor out of the building at one time. In 1977, with the opening of two more high schools Hazelwood East High School and Hazelwood West High School, Hazelwood Central returned to a conventional day schedule.|$|E

In the allocation of nurses to ward shifts, forward planning is widely acknowledged to be essential, {{but the majority of}} efforts in this highly constrained area rely on manual techniques. Health service policy is being driven increasingly towards maximum efficiency and accountability, resulting in the need for more accurate long-term planning. This paper discusses an approach to this problem, using a strategy of distributing and devolving the computational effort required. In the pre-processing stage, the staff to be rostered are treated as semi-autonomous agents, each with individual responsibility for their initial assignment, and communication with a global constraint solving (CLP) agent. This has proved to be intuitive to build and effective in use. 1. 0 Work allocation planning Health service provision sets itself rigorous standards in terms of the care it gives to its clients, along with its efficient management.

40|$|This thesis aims to {{investigate}} grammatical metaphor in Vietnamese translations of English official documentation. Building on Halliday’s notion of grammatical metaphor and linguistic theories of translation shift, the thesis situates its {{argument in the}} broader context of translation theory and explores the various representations of grammatical metaphor in relation to Catford’s translation shifts. It adopts a corpus approach with the compilation of a 200, 000 -word English-Vietnamese parallel corpus, and focuses specifically on the translation of nominalisations formed with the suffixes ATION and MENT. The thesis draws on the Vietnamese translations to provide insights into metaphorical modes of expression via nominalisations-as-grammatical metaphor in official texts. The findings reveal {{the various types of}} metaphorical meanings embedded in nominalised forms. The identification of this range of metaphorical realisations can be interpreted along a cline from being more verb-like and denoting the Act category, to being more noun-like and denoting the Result category, or stretching along the cline and denoting the Process or Activity indicated in the verbal stem. 	 The thesis supports the argument that several strategies which previous researchers have posited as universals are adopted in translating for adequate equivalence in metaphorisation. Some of these strategies like explicitation and simplification are found to be more powerful and more frequently used than others, and there are more explicitating and simplifying shifts in lexical rather than in syntactic or stylistic terms. Literal translation, though not commonly recognised as a translation universal, is found to be the most prevalent approach in the Vietnamese translation of ATION and MENT nominals in official texts. The thesis claims that the adoption of particular translation strategies generates corresponding translation shifts, and it is found that explicitation and simplification often entail shifts in level and in rank, and shifts in class often occur with shifts in structure. The findings reveal that shifts do not occur singly, but are often intertwined, and <b>overlapping</b> <b>shifts</b> are common in the Vietnamese translation. The thesis also proposes a graded continuum to justify congruence-incongruence shifts, and finally develops taxonomies of possible translation shifts involved in translating English N-GMs into Vietnamese. The findings are hoped to reveal several implications for the teaching about translation and for the practice of translating...|$|E

The general scaling based method supports any scaling value providing the user/application with the ability to control ROI and background qualities, but it limits the choice of the ROI shape and needs ROI shape coding. In this paper, we propose a novel ROI coding method named Bitplane <b>Overlap</b> <b>Shift</b> (BOShift). The proposed BOShift is compatible with the JPEG 2000 standard and it supports both arbitrary scaling values and arbitrary ROI shapes, without shape coding.

40|$|Abstract—We build a {{data-driven}} hierarchical inference {{model to}} predict wireless link quality between a mobile {{unmanned aerial vehicle}} (UAV) and ground nodes. Clustering, sparse feature extraction, and non-linear pooling are combined to improve Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification when a limited training set does not comprehensively characterize data varia-tions. Our approach first learns two layers of dictionaries by clustering packet reception data. These dictionaries are used to perform sparse feature extraction, which expresses link state vectors first {{in terms of a}} few prominent local patterns, or features, and then in terms of co-occurring features along the flight path. In order to tolerate artifacts like small positional shifts in field-collected data, we pool large magnitude features among <b>overlapping</b> <b>shifted</b> patches within windows. Together, these techniques transform raw link measurements into stable feature vectors that capture environmental effects driven by radio range limitations, antenna pattern variations, line-of-sight occlusions, etc. Link outage prediction is implemented by an SVM that assigns a common label to feature vectors immediately preceding gaps of successive packet losses; predictions are then fed to an adaptive link layer protocol that adjusts forward error correction rates, or queues packets during outages to prevent TCP timeout. In our harsh target environment, links are unstable and temporary outages common, so baseline TCP connections achieve only minimal throughput. However, connections under our predictive protocol temporarily hold packets that would otherwise be lost on unavailable links, and react quickly when the UAV link is restored, increasing overall channel utilization.

This dissertation examines specific phenomena that illustrate a unique {{aspect of the}} role of patient activism in shaping the practice of medicine. Each chapter focuses on a specific example. The four examples are the rise of Morgellons disease, activism by sufferers of chronic Lyme disease, research subject activism, and the use of patients to market Paxil for social phobia. I use these examples to examine various shifts of power that have occurred in medicine over the last few decades. These shifts can be generally divided into two types: a shift in power from physicians to patients and an <b>overlapping</b> <b>shift</b> in power from professional medicine to various corporate entities. In the past thirty years, patients have taken more and more control over their own medical care. Over this same time period the pharmaceutical industry became a highly profitable business, increasing its economic and political power and research has become more commercialized. The older fee-for-service model of medical practice has been replaced with a corporate model and the influence of professional medical bodies has waned. Each of the shifts documented here has its own moral story, but together they also point to larger trends in medicine that have important moral consequences. In the conclusion I point to four different points of tension for ethics: a shift in the locus of moral expertise, the changing physician-patient relationship, ambiguity in the goals of medicine, and the role of bioethicists as watchdogs for patients...|$|R

To investigate {{the manner in}} which the gag-initiated polyproteins of the mouse mammary tumor virus are produced, we determined the nucleotide sequence of a 1. 8 -kilobase DNA fragment that spans the region between gag and pol in the C 3 H strain of mouse mammary tumor virus. The sequence reveals three overlapping open reading frames: the first encodes products of gag (p 27 gag and p 14 gag); the second encodes a protein domain of unknown function (termed X) that is highly related to a similarly positioned sequence in simian type D retroviruses and the viral protease (pro); and the third encodes the reverse transcriptase. The reading frames are organized to permit uninterrupted readthrough from gag to pol if ribosomal frameshifts occur in the - 1 direction within each of the two overlapping regions, one of which is 16 nucleotides in length and the other 13 nucleotides. Cell-free translation of RNA containing these overlap regions shows that fusion of the reading frames by ribosomal frameshifting occurs efficiently: about one-fourth of the ribosomes traversing the gag-X/pro overlap and one-tenth traversing the X/pro-pol <b>overlap</b> <b>shift</b> frames, generating gag-related polyproteins in ratios similar to those observed in vivo.

Currently, mamar of banana managed by {{communities}} Ethnic Timor (East Nusa Tenggara) is the mixed cropping pattern, in which banana plants dominate the vegetation. Besides its function {{as one of}} the traditional peasant food barn, mamar also serves as a source of livestock feed. The raise of livestock is not integrated in the area of mamar. The dependence of farmers to obtain food, feed, and cash (ready money) on mamar is very high. However, it is not followed by structuring the mamar according to the agronomic management principles, so the function of mamar as barns for food sustainability could hardly be more functional. Whereas, the age of mamar is too old (more than 100 years) and without structuring, so it may become no longer productive. In order to make it more productive, the mamar requires structuring in cultivation system by using the various types of existing plants according to the recommended system of cultivation pattern, for example, alley cropping, intercropping, and alternating cropping, based on soil condition. In those cultivation systems, banana plants serve as the main plants dominating the mamar; seasonal crops and fodder grass serve as alley crops and are cultivated under intercropping and alternating cropping in an integrated and <b>overlapping</b> <b>shift</b> with livestock cultivation. The structuring mamar through space use patterns will not cause competition among plant species in the use of light and nutrients.
