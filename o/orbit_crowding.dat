40|$|The role of <b>orbit</b> <b>crowding</b> and cloud-cloud {{collisions}} in {{the formation}} of GMCs and their organization in global spiral structure is investigated. Both N-body simulations of the cloud system and a detailed analysis of individual particle orbits are used to develop a conceptual understanding of how individual clouds participate in the collective density response. Detailed comparisons are made between a representative cloud-particle simulation in which the cloud particles collide inelastically with one another and give birth to and subsequently interact with young star associations and stripped down simulations in which the cloud particles are allowed to follow ballistic orbits in the absence of cloud-cloud collisions or any star formation processes. <b>Orbit</b> <b>crowding</b> is then related to the behavior of individual particle trajectories in the galactic potential field.

The inner CO component is partially coincident with a region of highly polarized radio continuum emission which precedes the H-alpha spiral arm by 15 - 25 arcsec, indicating that it lies on or just downstream from a shock front.

40|$|Observational {{evidence}} is presented for the compression of molecular {{gas in the}} interface between colliding GMCs, and it is proposed {{that this is the}} dominant mode for high-mass star formation in the Galaxy. For a sample of 94 GMCs associated with high-luminosity radio H II regions, the efficiency of OB star formation decreases significantly with increasing cloud mass over the observed mass range. It is concluded that star formation is generally not stimulated by an internal mechanism. The formation of OB stars by cloud-cloud collisions is suggested by the observed quadratic dependence of the Galactic H II region distribution on the local density of H 2.

40|$|A {{review of}} {{gravitational}} and hydrodynamical processes during formation of clusters {{and evolution of}} galaxies is given. Early, at the advent of N-body computer simulations, the importance of tidal fields in galaxy encounters has been recognized. <b>Orbits</b> are <b>crowded</b> due to tides along spiral arms, where the star formation is enhanced. Low relative velocity encounters lead to galaxy mergers. The central dominating galaxies in future clusters form before the clusters in a merging process in galaxy groups. Galaxy clusters are composed in a hierarchical scenario due to relaxation processes between galaxies and galaxy groups. As soon as the overall cluster gravitational potential is built, high speed galaxy versus galaxy encounters start to play a role. These harassment events gradually thicken and shorten spiral galaxy disks leading {{to the formation of}} S 0 galaxies and ellipticals. Another aspect of the high speed motion in the hot and diluted Intracluster Medium (ICM) is the ram pressure exerted on the Interstellar Matter (ISM) leading to stripping of the ISM from parent spirals. The combinations of tides and ram pressure stripping efficiently removes the gas from spirals, quenching the star formation in galactic disks, while triggering it in the tidal arms and at the leading edge of gaseous disk. Gas stripping from disks transports the metals to the ICM. In some cases, the gas extracted from the galactic disks becomes self-gravitating forming tidal dwarf galaxies.

40|$|We present high {{resolution}} (3 ′ ′ – 5 ′ ′) observations of CO(J= 1 − 0) and HCN(J= 1 − 0) emission from the circumnuclear star forming {{ring in the}} barred spiral galaxy NGC 6951, a host of a type- 2 Seyfert nucleus, using the Nobeyama Millimeter Array and the Nobeyama 45 m telescope. We find that {{the distribution of the}} HCN emission is different from that of CO in the circumnuclear region of NGC 6951; it is confirmed that CO emission is dominated by “twin peaks ” morphology with two spiral arms, which are connected to the dust lanes, as reported by Kenney et al. (1992). On the other hand, although the HCN emission also shows a twin peaks morphology, the HCN peaks are spatially shifted downstream compared with the CO peaks. Most of the HCN emission is associated with the circumnuclear ring, where vigorous star formation occurs. The HCN to CO integrated intensity ratio in the brightness temperature scale, R HCN/CO, is also enhanced in the star forming ring. The peak value of the R HCN/CO is about 0. 16 – 0. 18, which is comparable to the R HCN/CO in the starburst regions of NGC 253 and M 82. Consequently, the HCN emission spatially correlates better with the massive star forming regions than the CO emission in the circumnuclear region of NGC 6951. The formation mechanism of dense molecular gas has been investigated. No significant enhancement of R HCN/CO is observed at the CO peaks, which are interpreted as x 1 /x 2 <b>orbit</b> <b>crowding</b> regions.

We {{study the}} effect of large scale {{dynamics}} on the molecular composition of the dense interstellar medium during the transition between diffuse to dense clouds. Methods. We followed the formation of dense clouds (on sub-parsec scales) through {{the dynamics of the}} interstellar medium at galac- tic scales. We used results from smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations from which we extracted physical parameters that are used as inputs for our full gas-grain chemical model.

Results. We show that depending on the physical history of each SPH particle, the molecular composition of the modeled dense clouds presents a high dispersion in the computed abundances even if the local physical properties are similar. We find that carbon chains are the most affected species and show that these differences are directly connected to differences in (1) the electronic fraction, (2) the C/O ratio, and (3) the local physical conditions. We argue that differences in the dynamical evolution of the gas that formed dense clouds could account for the molecular diversity observed between and within these clouds. Conclusions.

Satellite design is well {{developed for the}} common Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and Geosynchronous Orbit (GEO) and Highly Elliptical Orbits (HEO), i. e., Molniya, cases; Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) satellite design {{is a relatively new}} venture. MEO is roughly defined as being altitudes above LEO and below GEO. A primary concern, and a major reason for the delay in exploiting the MEO altitudes, has been the expected radiation environment and corresponding satellite degradation anticipated to occur at MEO altitudes. The presence of the Van Allen belts, a major source of radiation, along with the suitability of GEO and LEO orbits, has conventionally discouraged satellite placement in MEO. As conventional Earth <b>orbits</b> become increasingly <b>crowded,</b> MEO will become further populated. This thesis investigates the major sources of radiation (geomagnetically trapped particles, solar particle events and galactic cosmic radiation) with respect to specific Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) designated MEO (altitudes between 3, 000 nautical miles (nmi) and 9, 000 nmi; inclination angle of 15 degrees). The contribution of each of these components to the total radiation experienced in MEO and the effects of the expected radiation on a representative spacecraft are analyzed in comparison to a baseline LEO orbit of 400 nmi and 70 degrees inclination. Dose depth curves are calculated for several configurations, and show that weight gains from necessary expected shielding are not extreme.

40|$|A new deep HI {{survey of}} the galaxy Messier 33 is presented, based on {{observations}} obtained at the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory. We observe a perturbed outer gas distribution and kinematics in M 33, and confirm the disk warping as a significant kinematical twist of the major axis of the velocity field, though no strong tilt is measured, in agreement with previous work. Evidence for a new low brightness HI component with anomalous velocity is reported. It harbours a large velocity scatter, as its kinematics both exceeds and lags {{the rotation of the}} disk, and leaks in the forbidden velocity zone of apparent counter-rotation. The observations also reveal wide and multiple peak HI profiles which can be partly explained by <b>crowded</b> <b>orbits</b> in the framework of the warp model. Asymmetric motions are identified in the velocity field, as possible signatures of a lopsided potential and the warp. The mass distribution modeling of the hybrid Halpha-HI rotation curve favours a cuspy dark matter halo with a concentration in disagreement with the LambdaCDM dark halo mass-concentration relationship. The total mass enclosed in 23 kpc is 8 10 ^ 10 Msol, of which 11 % are stars and gas. At the virial radius of the cuspy halo, the resulting total mass is 5 10 ^ 11 Msol, but with a baryonic mass fraction of 2 % only.

40|$|We have {{examined}} the ratio between the integrated luminosity of massive young stellar objects detected by the Red MSX Source (RMS) survey and the mass of molecular clouds in the Galactic Ring Survey (GRS) region, {{as a function of}} Galactocentric radius. The results indicate that 60 - 80 per cent of the observed increases in the star formation rate density associated with spiral-arm features are due to source crowding within the arms. Of the remainder, most of the increase in the inner Sagittarius arm is due to an enhancement in the simple star formation efficiency, i. e. in the number of RMS sources per unit molecular gas mass. In the inner Perseus arm, the residual increase is due to a higher than average mean source luminosity, which implies a top-heavy initial mass function, and this is entirely due to the presence, in the GRS region, of the W 49 star-forming complex, which appears to be exceptional in its nature. The results also suggest that {{there is little or no}} increase in the star formation efficiency on kiloparsec scales in the Scutum tangent region which includes W 43.

40|$|The Galactic {{distributions}} of HI, H 2, and HII regions are reviewed {{in order to}} elucidate the high mass star formation occurring in galactic spiral arms and in active galactic nuclei. Comparison of the large scale {{distributions of}} H 2 gas and radio HII regions reveals {{that the rate of}} formation of OB stars depends on (n sub H 2) sup 1. 9 where (n sub H 2) is the local mean density of H 2 averaged over 300 pc scale lengths. In addition the efficiency of high mass star formation is a decreasing function of cloud mass in the range 200, 000 to 3, 000, 000 solar mass. These results suggest that high mass star formation in the galactic disk is initiated by cloud-cloud collisions which are more frequent in the spiral arms due to <b>orbit</b> <b>crowding.</b> Cloud-cloud collisions may also be responsible for high rates of OB star formation in interacting galaxies and galactic nuclei. Based on analysis of the Infrared Astronomy Satellite (IRAS) and CO data for selected GMCs in the Galaxy, the ratio L sub IR/M sub H 2 can be as high as 30 solar luminosity/solar mass for GMCs associated with HII regions.

Our 3. ′ ′ 9 × 3. ′ ′ 6 resolution CO observations reveal a perturbed distribution and the kinematics of molecular {{gas in the}} center of NGC 5033; we find the characteristic gaseous features that are widely observed in barred spiral galaxies, such as two bright CO peaks near the center (separated by ∼ 3 ′ ′ or 270 pc from the nucleus), two offset ridges of CO emission emanating from the CO peaks, and a CO ring (with a radius of ∼ 14 ′ ′ or 1. 3 kpc). Doublepeaked velocity profiles are also evident near the two CO peaks, implying that these CO peaks are <b>orbit</b> <b>crowding</b> zones in a barred/oval potential. Although NIR data only give an upper limit of the possible bar lengths, due to a large inclination of the NGC 5033 disk (i = 68 ◦), our CO data clearly suggests the presence of a small (the semi-major axis of about 12 ′ ′ – 15 ′ ′ or 1. 1 – 1. 4 kpc) nuclear bar (or oval structure) {{in the center of}} the “non-barred ” galaxy NGC 5033.

Molecular clouds in the spiral arms arise through a combination of compression of the ISM by the spiral shock and <b>orbit</b> <b>crowding.</b> These results highlight that local self-gravity is not required to form molecular clouds. Self-shielding provides a sharp transition density, below which gas is essentially atomic, and above which the molecular gas fraction is > 0. 001. The timescale for gas to move between these regimes is very rapid ( 50 %). Although our calculations are unable to resolve turbulent motions on scales smaller than the spiral arm and do not include self-gravity. True cloud formation timescales are therefore expected to be even shorter. The mass budget of the disc is dominated by cold gas residing in the spiral arms. Between 50 and 75 % of this gas is in the atomic phase. When this gas leaves the spiral arm and drops below the self-shielding limit it is heated by the galactic radiation field. Consequently, most of the volume in the interarm regions is filled with warm atomic gas. However, some cold spurs and clumps can survive in interarm regions for periods comparable to the interarm passage timescale. Altogether between 7 and 40 % of the gas in our disc is molecular, depending on the surface density of the calculation, with approximately 20 % molecular for a surface density comparable to the solar neighbourhood.

Nine distinguishable structures are described: the standard Northern Arm, Eastern Arm, Bar, Western Arc, and five additional, coherently-moving patches of gas. From this analysis, the Northern Arm appears not limited, as usually thought, to the bright, narrow North-South lane seen on intensity images, but it instead consists of a weak, continuous, triangular-shaped surface, drawn out into a narrow stream in the vicinity of Sgr A* where it shows a strong velocity gradient, and a bright western rim. The Eastern Arm is split into three components. We also report extinction of some interstellar structures by others, providing information on their relative position along the line of sight.

40|$|Abstract. Star {{formation}} is enhanced in spiral arms {{because of a}} combination of <b>orbit</b> <b>crowding,</b> cloud collisions, and gravitational instabilities. The characteristic mass for the instability is 10 7 M ⊙ in gas and 10 5 M ⊙ in stars, and the morphology is the familiar beads on a string with 1 - 2 kpc separation. Similar instabilities occur in resonance rings and tidal tails. Sequential triggering from stellar pressure occurs in two ways. For short times and near distances, it occurs in the bright rims and dense knots that lag behind during cloud dispersal. For long times, it occurs in swept-up shells and along the periphery of cleared regions. The first case should be common but difficult to disentangle from independent star formation in the same cloud. The second case has a causality condition and a collapse condition and is often easy to recognize. Turbulent triggering produces a hierarchy of dense cloudy structure and an associated hierarchy of young star positions. There should also be a correlation between the duration of star formation {{and the size of the}} region that is analogous to the size-linewidth relation in the gas. The cosmological context is provided by observations of star formation in high redshift galaxies. Sequential and turbulent triggering is not yet observable, but gravitational instabilities are, and they show a scale up from local instabilities by a factor of ∼ 3 in size and ∼ 100 in mass. This is most easily explained as the result of an increase in the ISM turbulent speed by a factor of ∼ 5.

40|$|Minor mergers {{frequently}} {{occur between}} giant and gas-rich low mass galaxies and can provide {{significant amounts of}} interstellar matter to refuel star formation and power AGN in the giant systems. Major starbursts and/or AGN result when fresh gas is transported and compressed in the central regions of the giant galaxy. This is the situation in NGC 1614, whose molecular medium we explore at half arcsecond angular resolution through our observations of 12 CO(2 - 1) emission using the SMA. We compare our maps with optical and Pa alpha, HST and high angular resolution radio continuum images to study the relationships between dense molecular gas and the starburst region. The most intense CO emission occurs in a partial ring with ~ 230 pc radius around the center, with an extension to the north-west into the dust lane that contains diffuse molecular gas. We resolve 10 GMAs in the ring which has an integrated molecular mass of ~ 8 x 10 ^ 8 M_sun. Our observations filter out {{a large part of}} the CO(1 - 0) emission mapped at shorter spacings, indicating that most of the molecular gas is diffuse and that GMAs only exist near and within the circumnuclear ring. The molecular ring is uneven with most of the mass on the western side, which also contains GMAs extending into a pronounced tidal dust lane. The spatial and kinematic patterns suggest that the northwest extension of the ring is a cosmic umbilical cord that is feeding molecular gas associated with the dust lane and tidal debris into the nuclear ring. The astrophysical process for producing a ring structure is not fully understood, but the presence of numerous GMAs suggests an <b>orbit</b> <b>crowding</b> or resonance phenomenon. There is some evidence that star formation is progressing radially outwards within the ring, indicating that a self-triggering mechanism may also affect these processes.

40|$|Abstract. Integral field {{spectroscopy}} of {{the inner}} region of the Galactic Center, over a field of roughly 40 ′ ′ × 40 ′ ′ was obtained at 2. 06 µm (Hei) and 2. 16 µm (Brackett-γ) using BEAR, an imaging Fourier Transform Spectrometer, at spectral resolutions respectively of 52. 9 km s − 1 and 21. 3 km s − 1, and a spatial resolution of ≃ 0. 5 ′ ′. The {{analysis of the data}} was focused on the kinematics of the gas flows, traditionally called the “Minispiral”, concentrated in the neighborhood of the central black hole, Sgr A ⋆. From the decomposition into several velocity components (up to four) of the line profile extracted at each point of the field, velocity features were identified. Nine distinguishable structures are described: the standard Northern Arm, Eastern Arm, Bar, Western Arc, and five additional, coherently-moving patches of gas. From this analysis, the Northern Arm appears not limited, as usually thought, to the bright, narrow North-South lane seen on intensity images, but it instead consists of a weak, continuous, triangular-shaped surface, drawn out into a narrow stream in the vicinity of Sgr A ⋆ where it shows a strong velocity gradient, and a bright western rim. The Eastern Arm is split into three components. An Eastern Cavity proposed on radio maps is not confirmed, but a new interstellar feature is detected just east of its position, the Eastern Bridge, that seems to be a newly identified flow. We also report extinction of some interstellar structures by others, providing information on their relative position along the line of sight. A system of Keplerian orbits can be fitted to most of the Northern Arm, and the bright rim of this feature can be interpreted in terms of line-of-sight <b>orbit</b> <b>crowding</b> caused by the warping of the flowing surface at the western edge facing Sgr A ⋆. These results lead to a new picture of the gas structures in Sgr A West, in which large-scal...|$|E
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 14 - 16, 1980 / Bahia Hotel, San Diego, CaliforniaThe NASA LeRC 30 / 20 GHz Satellite Communications Program is {{developing}} a number of technologies to reduce satellite orbit/spectrum crowding and prevent saturation of our domestic United States Communications capabilities in the 1990 to 2000 decade. Developing the basic hardware technology to operate at 30 and 20 GHz provides 2. 5 GHz of new communications bandwidth. This 2. 5 GHz additional communications bandwidth is not the primary benefit of the program, however. Rain losses are severe at 30 and 20 GHz, and innovative techniques are required for systems which are both reliable and economic. Techniques being developed include large satellite antennas with simultaneous multiple fixed and multiple scanning beam capabilities. These provide high antenna gain to increase communications margin and frequency reuse capability through beam isolation, while providing complete coverage of the United States. Effective communication bandwidths from a single satellite location can reach ten's of gigahertz, with the communication capacity tailored to match the very nonuniform geographic demand pattern. Satellite onboard processing consisting of demodulation, adaptive forward-error-correction (FEC) decoding and coding, routing {{of hundreds of thousands}} of channels to thousands of terminals, and remodulation with independently optimized uplink and downlink modulation structures is being developed. The onboard processing reduces the scanning antenna requirements, allows more effective frequency reuse, and increases the rain margins by adoptively using system margins to support terminals currently experiencing rain. All of the functions described can be performed with reasonable satellite weight, thermal, and power impacts by using large scale integration (LSI) to implement the digital data processor. By designing the onboard processor with parallel internal structure, the hardware can be made extremely reliable (high level redundancy) and the number of LSI chip types required is relatively small. The antenna and onboard processing techniques are readily adaptable to C-band and Kuband, as well as Ka-band. Deployable antennas may be required at the lower bands, but precision deployable antenna designs are available and the feed structures scale directly. Frequency reuse of all three commercial communication bands should greatly ease the <b>orbit</b> <b>crowding</b> problems now being experienced in C-band, and should allow United States domestic communications to accommodate any desired expansion in the next two decades...|$|E
40|$|High {{resolution}} near-infrared {{images of}} the type 1 Seyfert galaxy NGC 7469 have been obtained to probe its dusty nuclear environment. Direct J, H, and K images are relatively featureless, but residual images created by subtracting a smooth model based on best-fitting elliptical isophotes reveal a tight inner spiral whose high surface-brightness portions correspond to a previously detected 3 sec (1 kpc) diameter ring of radio continuum emission. The inner infrared spiral arms extended approximately equal to 4 sec NW and SE from the nucleus, and the NW arm joins up with large-scale spiral structure visible in the R band. The residual images also show a bar-like structure aligned with the brightest infrared/radio hotspots at PA approximately equal to 50 deg. Three infrared hotspots are detected which align remarkably well with 6 cm radio continuum sources. The near-infrared ring and the hotspots are visible in the residual images, and in a high-resolution direct K-band image restored to an effective resolution of 0. 65 sec (FWHM) using the Richardson-Lucy algorithm. The infrared hotspots have luminosities of nuL(sub nu) (2. 2 micrometer(s)) approximately equal to 10 (exp 8) solar luminosity (M(sub k) approximately equal to - 16 mag), suggesting they are either giant H II regions or individual supernovae. The two brightest regions {{may be associated with}} enhanced star formation triggered by <b>orbit</b> <b>crowding</b> of gas where spiral arms emerge from an inner bar. Narrowband (delta lambda/lambda approximately 1. 5 %) imaging in the 3. 28 micrometer(s) dust emission feature and surrounding continuum confirms the 3 sec diameter 3. 28 micrometer(s) emission region detected previously using multiaperture photometry. The extended polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission is slightly elongated and aligned with published 1 O III 1 line emission and 12. 5 micrometer(s) continuum emission, apparently tracing the starburst. The presence of approximately equal to 25 % of the total 3. 28 micrometer(s) PAH emission within R less than 1 sec demonstrates that a starburst within the central few hundred parsecs must supply a significant fraction of the infrared continuum from the nucleus, and there is apparently sufficient shielding material between the starburst and the active galactic nucleus (AGN) to preserve the PAHs along our line of sight to the nucleus...|$|E
40|$|NOTE: Text or symbols not renderable {{in plain}} ASCII are {{indicated}} by [ [...] . ]. Abstract is included in. pdf document. A study is presented {{of the relationship}} between the density wave, molecular gas and star formation in the molecule-rich, grand-design spiral galaxy M 51. An interferometric map of CO emission covering most of the disk of M 51 at 8 " resolution is presented. A narrow, two-arm spiral pattern is seen in the molecular gas. Streaming motions indicating the presence of a density wave can clearly be seen. Giant Molecular Associations (GMAs) of typical mass 3 x 10 [superscript 7] M[ [...] . ], first reported by Vogel, Kulkarni and Scoville, are seen in abundance along the arms. The virial theorem indicates that these GMAs are roughly gravitationally bound. A few unbound GMAs are also seen between the arms. There is evidence that these interarm GMAs form in a secondary compression of the density wave. Substructure in the GMAs is indicated by their CO spectra, which typically reveal a few discrete velocity components. Higher (2. 5 ") resolution maps of a small area south of the nucleus of M 51 reveal patchy substructure along the southern molecular spiral arm and in the GMAs. The above-mentioned streaming motions are confirmed at this resolution. The one-dimensional velocity dispersion along the arms at this resolution is roughly 10 km s[superscript - 1]. A more careful virial analysis confirms that the on-arm GMAs are bound while the interarm GMAs are unbound. The on-arm GMAs are shown to be stable against galactic tidal forces, while the interarm GMAs are close to the point of marginal stability. Along the spiral arm in this map, the detailed agreement between CO and Hα luminosity is poor. There are several possible explanations for this. Two consequences of star formation on the state of the ISM of M 51 are discussed. Using the new, 8 "-resolution VLA map of 21 -cm emission, we find much new evidence in support of the idea of Tilanus and Allen that the HI is predominantly a product of dissociation in star-forming regions. The possibility is suggested that HI emission may be used as an indicator of star formation efficiency in molecule-rich galaxies. IRAS pointed observations of M 51 are used to probe the origins of the infrared emission. Two independent tests indicate that a substantial fraction of the infrared emission originates in a cirrus component, and not due to dust heating by star-forming regions. One consequence of the existence of the cirrus component is that infrared emission cannot be used in a straightforward way to test the hypothesis of the triggering of star formation by a density wave. A kinematic study of the old-disk stars, and the molecular, neutral and ionized gas is presented. The old-disk stars, since they comprise most of the mass of the galaxy, trace the underlying gravitational perturbation. Long-slit spectroscopy of the absorption lines provides some evidence for radial streaming motions in the massive old-disk population. The amplitude of the motion at 85 " from the nucleus is greater than that expected from linear density wave theory. A possible explanation from nonlinear theory is given. Long-slit spectroscopy of the [ [...] . ] and [NII] lines, along with kinematic information from our CO map and the high-resolution VLA map of 21 -cm emission, clearly reveal streaming motions in the molecular, neutral and ionized gas. These motions are compared with the predictions of nonlinear density wave models. A quantitative analysis of possible GMA formation mechanisms, which draws on our morphological and kinematic observations of the molecular gas, is presented. Gravitational instability and collisional agglomeration are both viable mechanisms for GMA formation on the arms. The interarm gas is close to the point of marginal stability, and the postulated secondary compression of the density wave may be sufficient to cause either weak instabilities in the gas, or low-level <b>orbit</b> <b>crowding,</b> thereby explaining the unbound interarm GMAs. The relationship between GMA formation and the triggering of star formation is briefly addressed. Problems with the conclusion that the on-arm GMAs are gravitationally bound are discussed. Disruption of bound on-arm GMAs must be rapid since they are confined to narrow spiral arms. Although the arguments are by no means conclusive, the input power of star formation is a plausible mechanism for GMA disruption. ...|$|E
