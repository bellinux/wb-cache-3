50|$|Payloads in the HRF-1 {{can operate}} {{independently}} {{regardless of their}} cooling and power needs and flight schedule. The HRF power converter delivers 120V of direct current (DC) power from the utility <b>outlet</b> <b>panel</b> to the rack and converts it to 28 Vdc for distribution to the payloads. Payload computer and video operations can be conducted from the ground or on the space station. The crew performs periodic checks of all connections and hardware and performs payload operations as needed.|$|E
50|$|Contractor's Special hybrid - Dodge {{announced}} a hybrid {{version of the}} Ram, dubbed the Contractor's Special, in 2003. However, the schedule for delivery slipped as Dodge {{backed away from the}} vehicle. The hybrid Ram was available only for fleet purchasers (if at all) and did not enter mass production. It offered an AC electrical <b>outlet</b> <b>panel</b> for running an entire job site worth of power tools, but the through-the-road method of balancing the gas engine and electric motor reportedly did not work as desired. Dodge has announced that it would use a hybrid transmission developed jointly with General Motors and BMW.|$|E

40|$|The {{electrical}} power system developed for the International Space Station represents the largest space-based power system ever designed and, consequently, has driven some key technology aspects and operational challenges. The full U. S. -built system consists of a 160 -Volt dc primary network, and a more tightly regulated 120 -Volt dc secondary network. Additionally, the U. S. system interfaces with the 28 -Volt system in the Russian segment. The international nature of the Station has resulted in modular converters, switchgear, <b>outlet</b> <b>panels,</b> and other components being built by different countries, with the associated interface challenges. This paper provides details of the architecture and unique hardware developed for the Space Station, and examines the opportunities it provides for further long-term space power technology development, such as concentrating solar arrays and flywheel energy storage systems...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Flattening {{household}} {{electricity demand}} reduces generation costs, since costs are disproportionately affected by peak demands. While {{the vast majority}} of household electrical loads are interactive and have little scheduling flexibility (TVs, microwaves, etc.), a substantial fraction of home energy use derives from background loads with some, albeit limited, flexibility. Examples of such devices include A/Cs, refrigerators, and dehumidifiers. In this paper, we study {{the extent to which a}} home is able to transparently flatten its electricity demand by scheduling only background loads with such flexibility. We propose a Least Slack First (LSF) scheduling algorithm for household loads, inspired by the well-known Earliest Deadline First algorithm. We then integrate the algorithm into Smart-Cap, a system we have built for monitoring and controlling electric loads in homes. To evaluate LSF, we collected power data at <b>outlets,</b> <b>panels,</b> and switches from a real home for 82 days. We use this data to drive simulations, as well as experiment with a real testbed implementation that uses similar background loads as our home. Our results indicate that LSF is most useful during peak usage periods that exhibit “peaky” behavior, where power deviates frequently and significantly from the average. For example, LSF decreases the average deviation from the mean power by over 20 % across all 4 -hour periods where the deviation is at least 400 watts. I...|$|R

40|$|The role of PLUTO (Plug-in Port UTilization Officer) and {{the growth}} of the International Space Station (ISS) have {{exceeded}} the capabilities of the current tool PiP (Plug-in Plan). Its users (crew and flight controllers) have expressed an interest in a new, easy-to-use tool with a higher level of interactivity and functionality that is not bound by the limitations of Excel. The PiP Tool assists crewmembers and ground controllers in making real-time decisions concerning the safety and compatibility of hardware plugged into the UOPs (Utility <b>Outlet</b> <b>Panels)</b> onboard the ISS. The PiP Tool also provides a reference to the current configuration of the hardware plugged in to the UOPs, and enables the PLUTO and crew to test Plug-in locations for constraint violations (such as cable connector mismatches or amp limit violations), to see the amps and volts for an end item, {{to see whether or not}} the end item uses 1553 data, and the cable length between the outlet and the end item. As new equipment is flown or returned, the database can be updated appropriately as needed. The current tool is a macroheavy Excel spreadsheet with its own database and reporting functionality. The new tool captures the capabilities of the original tool, ports them to new software, defines a new dataset, and compensates for ever-growing unique constraints associated with the Plug-in Plan. New constraints were designed into the tool, and updates to existing constraints were added to provide more flexibility and customizability. In addition, there is an option to associate a "Flag" with each device that will let the user know there is a unique constraint associated with it when they use it. This helps improve the safety and efficiency of real-time calls by limiting the amount of "corporate knowledge" overhead that has to be trained and learned through use. The tool helps save time by automating previous manual processes, such as calculating connector types and deciding which cables are required and in what order...|$|R
50|$|In {{comparison}} to other Dance charts, It's a valid observation {{to note that}} American commercial radio's definition of dance music is marginal and this {{is reflected in the}} chart's content. Since the 2011 adjustment, the chart was composed largely of remixed pop and urban songs and less Dance tracks, eschewing material that is dance music and/or by dance artists in its original form, moving away from its original mission to feature true Dance hits. However, by 2012, the influx of EDM songs in the mix shows and the addition of 2 more Dance <b>outlets</b> on the <b>panel</b> has once again increased the Dance content on the chart with less remixed Pop and R&B tracks being played.|$|R
40|$|Results are {{presented}} of an analysis which compares the performance predictions of a thermal {{model of a}} multi-panel modular radiator system with thermal vacuum test data. Comparisons between measured and predicted individual <b>panel</b> <b>outlet</b> temperatures and pressure drops and system outlet temperatures have been made over {{the full range of}} heat loads, environments and plumbing arrangements expected for the shuttle radiators. Both two sided and one sided radiation have been included. The model predictions show excellent agreement with the test data for the maximum design conditions of high load and hot environment. Predictions under minimum design conditions of low load-cold environments indicate good agreement with the measured data, but evaluation of low load predictions should consider the possibility of parallel flow instabilities due to main system freezing. Performance predictions under intermediate conditions in which the majority of the flow is not in either the main or prime system are adequate although model improvements in this area may be desired. The primary modeling objective of providing an analytical technique for performance predictions of a multi-panel radiator system under the design conditions has been met...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Purpose – The {{organic product}} market can be {{considered}} as an emerging market. Since the 1990 s it has experienced rapid growth, and supermarket chains have become the sales channel with the largest market share and are the main driver for further growth. However, different supermarket retail groups have very different strategies concerning the marketing of organic products. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to gain insight into the different strategies of retailers who are active in the organic product market and to explain the drivers which may underlie them. Design/methodology/approach – The strategies of the three most important Belgian retailers that market organic products, and in particular organic beef, are analyzed. Data were collected through interviews with the retailers' staff and through observations in retail <b>outlets.</b> Also, GfK-household <b>panel</b> data which recorded all purchases of 3, 000 Belgian households and a postal survey with 529 respondents were used as data sources. Findings – The different strategies used by retailers to market organic foods are associated with the overall characteristics and marketing strategies of the retail groups. Some retail groups have clear “first mover” advantages from engaging in the organic product line, while for others an adaptive strategy is more appropriate. Research limitations/implications – The insights from this paper will help the understanding and facilitate the development of future strategies for organic and other high-value or premium products, which will be of interest to researchers and stakeholders who are active in these markets. Practical implications – The retail sector is not a single homogeneous block, but instead consists of retailers who pursue quite different strategies. This concept may have major implications for the future development of high-value markets. Originality/value – Existing relevant theories were applied to the adoption of the organic product line, a segment in the portfolio of retailers that is becoming more important. The empirical material collected sheds new light on the drivers behind retail strategies...|$|R
