25|$|In April 1960, {{a review}} of minutes from the inquiry found {{inconsistencies}} and possibly a fraudulent document in Gibli's <b>original</b> <b>testimony</b> that seemed to support Lavon's account of events. During this time, it came to light that Elad (the Israeli agent running Operation Susannah in Egypt) had committed perjury during the original inquiry. Elad was also suspected of betraying the group to Egyptian authorities, though the charges were never proven. He was eventually sentenced to a jail term of 10 years for trying to sell Israeli documents to the Egyptians in an unrelated matter. Ben-Gurion scheduled closed hearings with a new board of inquiry chaired by Haim Cohn, a supreme court justice.|$|E
25|$|Rushmore {{continued}} {{as a reporter}} for the Mexico Intelligencer. On January 12, 1931, Rushmore witnessed the lynching of Raymond Gunn in Maryville, Missouri. The African American suspect was seized from the local sheriff and doused with gasoline atop a roof and set aflame, while several thousands watched. The event made an indelible mark on the 17-year-old, who, even {{at the height of his}} anti-communist career, would maintain Gunn's complete innocence. The Communist Party USA in Kansas City organized an anti-lynch committee led by Abner Berry, a party organizer in Harlem during the 1940s. Rushmore was impressed by the bravery and anti-racist stance of the communists. Through the committee, Rushmore met Jack Conroy, editor of The Anvil, a communist literary magazine. Conroy encouraged Rushmore's literary ambitions by suggesting he submit short stories. By April 1935 Rushmore had become an associate editor of the magazine. Later that year, Rushmore joined the Young Communist League USA in St Louis, despite having neither a technical knowledge of Marxist philosophy nor its history. This lifelong ignorance would hamper his authority as a professional communist and anti-communist as critics would question his qualifications on the subject. He organized farmers in the Dakotas and Iowa, then Conroy sent him to New York City in May 1935, where he attended the American Writers Congress. There he was asked to join the editorial staff of the Young Worker, the organ of the Young Communist League. Taking advantage of his perceived all-American background, the CPUSA rapidly promoted Rushmore. All staff members of the Young Worker were assigned to a political unit of the Young Communist League. Rushmore belonged to the Harlem unit, where he met Ruby Bates, a recent recruit to the League. Bates was one of the two plaintiffs of the Scottsboro Boys case, who later tried to recant her <b>original</b> <b>testimony</b> during the Patterson trial.|$|E

50|$|The papal process {{started by}} Pope Clement V, to {{investigate}} both the Order {{as a whole}} and its members individually found virtually no knights guilty of heresy outside France. Fifty-four knights were executed in France by French authorities as relapsed heretics after denying their <b>original</b> <b>testimonies</b> before the papal commission; these executions were motivated by Philip's desire to prevent Templars from mounting an effective defence of the Order. It failed miserably, as many members testified against the charges of heresy in the ensuing papal investigation.|$|R

[...] In October, when the report appeared with six pages cut from the testimony, The White House stated that the changes were made due to concerns regarding the accuracy of the science.

500|$|Musicians and {{scholars}} including Laurel Fay and Richard Taruskin contest the authenticity and debate {{the significance of}} Testimony, alleging that Volkov compiled it {{from a combination of}} recycled articles, gossip, and possibly some information direct from the composer. Fay documents these allegations in her 2002 article 'Volkov's Testimony reconsidered', showing that the only pages of the <b>original</b> <b>Testimony</b> manuscript that Shostakovich had signed and verified are word-for-word reproductions of earlier interviews given by the composer, none of which are controversial. (Against this, it has been pointed out by Allan B. Ho and Dmitry Feofanov that {{at least two of the}} signed pages contain controversial material: for instance, [...] "on the first page of chapter 3, where [...] notes that the plaque that reads 'In this house lived [...] Meyerhold' should also say 'And in this house his wife was brutally murdered'.")

40|$|Without {{mentioning}} {{the name of}} the author, the well-known Natural and Moral History of the Indies by the Jesuit scholar José de Acosta was included in Vol. 9 - originally the last one - of the Latin and German versions of Theodore de Bry's finely illustrated Collectiones peregrinationum in Indiam occidentalem, together with fourteen new drawings. This collection of accounts of voyages and travels has been analyzed thus far as just a collection of illustrations, neglecting the texts accompanying them and emphasizing the ideological dimension of De Bry's work. In this essay I'll try a novel approach.

2500|$|In 2009, the Supreme Court of the United States {{ordered the}} U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia to {{consider}} whether new evidence [...] "that {{could not have been}} obtained at the time of trial clearly establishes [...] innocence". The evidentiary hearing was held in June 2010. The defense presented affidavits from seven of the nine trial witnesses whose <b>original</b> <b>testimony</b> had identified Davis as the murderer, but who it contended had changed or recanted their previous testimony. Some of these writings disavowed parts of prior testimony, or implicated Sylvester [...] "Redd" [...] Coles, who Davis contended was the actual triggerman. The state presented witnesses, including the police investigators and original prosecutors, who described a careful investigation of the crime, without any coercion. Davis did not call some of the witnesses who had supposedly recanted, despite their presence in the courthouse; accordingly their affidavits were given little weight by the judge. Evidence that Coles had confessed to the killing was excluded as hearsay because Coles was not subpoenaed by the defense to rebut it.|$|E
2500|$|On July 16, 2007, the Georgia State Board of Pardons and Paroles {{granted a}} ninety-day stay of {{execution}} {{in order to allow}} the evaluation of evidence presented, including the doubts about Davis's guilt. The stay was superseded by the August 2007 decision of the Georgia Supreme Court to grant Davis' application for discretionary appeal from the denial of his Extraordinary Motion for a New Trial. Defense lawyers requested a new trial based on statements of mistaken identity. On March 17, 2008, the Georgia Supreme Court denied the appeal by a 4–3 majority. The majority wrote that the recanting witnesses [...] "have merely stated they now do not feel able to identify the shooter", that the trial testimony could not be ignored, and that they [...] "in fact, favor that <b>original</b> <b>testimony</b> over the new." [...] In dissent, the Chief Justice wrote that [...] "if recantation testimony, either alone or supported by other evidence, shows convincingly that prior trial testimony was false, it simply defies all logic and morality to hold that it must be disregarded categorically".|$|E
2500|$|In {{their own}} {{investigation}} {{which ended in}} 2005, the Institute of National Remembrance analysed documents and testimonies of the 1949 show trial, and interviewed a total of 169 persons. Among the individuals questioned by the IPN were families of victims as well as former soldiers of the 3rd Brigade of NZW. The IPN investigation established that the <b>original</b> <b>testimony</b> by Prokop Iwacik had no grounds in reality {{because he could not}} have been there; his own son testified that Iwacik went into hiding for three days. The subsequent description of terrific murders in Puchały Stare contradicted one of the key tenets of forensic science; the fracturing of bones was produced by bullets and not by blows as alleged. It was Iwacik who claimed that ethnic Belarusian carriers were singled out for the execution in Puchały, but according to statement by Michał T. the carriers were selected for the exchange based on quality of their horse-drawn carriages alone. Among the many child witness reports collected by the IPN there were also testimonies confirming that local farmers were among the assailants. Maria K. from Zanie testified that her mother was killed by a man from a neighbouring village, known to her brother.|$|E

30|$|Among {{the past}} Himalayan earthquakes, the Bihar–Nepal, January 15, 1934, earthquake, with a death toll {{of more than}} 8000 people in Nepal and 7000 in India, deeply traumatized the population. In Nepal, several <b>original</b> <b>testimonies</b> were {{collected}} by Brahma Shumsher Rana, a Nepalese army “major general” responsible for the rescue and reconstruction operations (see Additional file 1). Some of these testimonies as well as key scientific information are compiled in his 1936 book, “Mahabukhampa”—“Great Earthquake” in nepali (Rana 1935). It has been partially complemented by the observations made during the three trips organized through the meizoseismal zone in eastern Nepal and Ganges basin (Dunn et al. 1939). A systematic macroseismic data collection was concomitantly organized in India. Indeed, the collection of questionnaires prepared by the Geological Survey of India and sent through the government of Bihar and Orissa were {{a major source of}} information in terms of macroseismic effects (e.g., Dunn et al. 1939). These macroseismic surveys resulted in a vast accumulation of data, including death toll and damages, consigned in Rana (1935) and Dunn et al. (1939), compiled and further analyzed in review studies (Pandey and Molnar 1988). However, information on the fatality rates was lacking due to limited availability of any individual and housing census {{at the time of the}} event. This lack limited exploitation of the data collected in terms of hazard estimation.|$|R

MacArthur's Second Front: Censorship and Propaganda in the Gulf War (Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 1992), and came to wide public attention when an Op-ed by MacArthur was published in The New York Times. This prompted a reexamination by Amnesty International, which had originally promoted an account alleging even greater numbers of babies torn from incubators than the <b>original</b> fake <b>testimony.</b> After finding {{no evidence to support}} it, the organization issued a retraction.

6000|$|The English Chronicle, {{our third}} authority, was first {{compiled}} {{at the court}} of Ælfred, four and a-half centuries after the Conquest; and so its value as <b>original</b> <b>testimony</b> is very slight. Its earlier portions are mainly condensed from Bæda; but it contains a few fragments of traditional information from some other unknown sources. These fragments, however, refer chiefly to Kent, Sussex, and the older parts of Wessex, where we {{have reason to believe}} that the Teutonic colonisation was exceptionally thorough; and they tell us nothing about Yorkshire, Lincolnshire, and East Anglia, where we find at the present day so large a proportion of the population possessing an unmistakably Celtic physique. The Chronicle undoubtedly describes the conflict in the south as sharp and bloody; and in spite of the mythical character of the names and events, it is probable that in this respect it rightly preserves the popular memory of the conquest, and its general nature. In Kent, [...] "the Welsh fled the English like fire;" [...] and Hengest and Æsc, in a single battle, slew 4,000 men. In Sussex, Ælle and Cissa killed or drove out the natives in the western rapes on their first landing, and afterwards massacred every Briton at Anderida. In Wessex, in the first struggle, [...] "Cerdic and Cynric offslew a British king whose name was Natanleod, and 5,000 men with him." [...] And so the dismal annals of rapine and slaughter run on from year to year, with simple, unquestioning conciseness, showing us, at least, the manner in which the later English believed their forefathers had acquired the land. Moreover, these frightful details accord well enough with the vague generalities of Gildas, from which, however, they may very possibly have been manufactured. Yet even the Chronicle nowhere speaks of absolute extermination: that idea has been wholly read into its words, not directly inferred from them. A great deal has been made of the massacre at Pevensey; but we hear nothing of similar massacres at the great Roman cities–at London, at York, at Verulam, at Bath, at Cirencester, which would surely have attracted more attention than a small outlying fortress like Anderida. Even the Teutonic champions themselves admit that some, at least, of the Celts were incorporated into the English community. [...] "The women," [...] says Mr. Freeman, [...] "would, doubtless, be largely spared;" [...] while as to the men, he observes, [...] "we may be sure that death, emigration, or personal slavery were the only alternatives which the vanquished found at the hands of our fathers." [...] But there is a vast gulf, from the ethnological point of view, between exterminating a nation and enslaving it.[2] ...|$|E

40|$|The {{contamination}} of blood products by HIV {{in the early}} 1980 s resulted in thousands of deaths among people with hemophilia in the United States and elsewhere. In the US, industry, government, physicians, and advocacy groups were implicated in this tragedy. In response to pleas {{from members of the}} US hemophilia community, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) of the National Academy of Science convened a public hearing to identify the institutional determinants of the HIV/AIDS epidemic among US hemophilia patients. The resulting IOM Report (1995) established a narrative of the crisis and indicated necessary improvements to the management of the US blood supply. The Report, however, failed to address the hemophilia community's demands for accountability and retribution. In this paper we explore the moral and social dimensions of this tragedy through narrative analysis of the <b>original</b> <b>testimonies</b> of hemophilia sufferers, interviews with some patients and their families, and a re-examination of the text of the IOM Report itself. We examine the process by which this crisis was addressed [...] through the discourses of science and law [...] and how it was ultimately framed as a failure of management and oversight rather than a moral failure of the for-profit health-care system. Thus, while the Report and its aftermath demonstrate powerfully how testimonials of suffering can influence public policy, by not addressing what is at stake for the victims [...] failure to protect patients in an era of increasingly commodified health care [...] it led to an exculpatory solution that obfuscated the moral dimensions of suffering.

40|$|Mount Etna on {{the east}} side of the island of Sicily is one of the most active volcanoes in the world. According to the {{reported}} <b>original</b> <b>testimonies,</b> Mount Etna erupted lava about two hundred times thus far. The first known eruption took place in 475 BC, and some very strong eruptions occurred in modern times, as well, during 20 th and at the beginning of 21 st centuries. Etna is often mentioned in many Greco-Roman legends. Due to the fact that there is constant vapor coming out of its crater and because of the relatively frequent and terrifying eruptions during its long history, Mount Etna could also serve as a suitable figure of speech. This abstract contains two such examples from the rich and diverse Byzantine literature, first from the beginning of the 11 th century, and second from the second half of the 12 th century. The first example is about the Saint Stephen the Younger who perished in 767 as an avid defender of icons. His hagiography, written by Stephen, deacon of St. Sofia, describes how the Iconoclastic Emperor Leo III (717 – 741), taking a stand against the cult of icons, was erupting fire and sulfur from his angry heart like Mount Etna. In the second example, the commemorative speech by Eustathius of Thessalonike dedicated to the Emperor Manuel I Komnenos (1143 – 1180), Roger II of Sicily (1130 – 1154), great enemy of the Byzantine Empire, was compared to a dragon who threatened to shoot the flame of his anger and rage higher than the crater of Mount Etna. In both examples, the Byzantine men of letters very craftily and effectively used the comparisons of the two monarchs with the volcano in Sicily...|$|R
40|$|In the Catalogue of Strong Italian Earthquakes, all testimonies {{relating}} to {{effects on the}} environment have been systematically analysed, geo-referenced and filed. This complex work of research and organisation has been conducted according to two main perspectives: the historical and the geological point of view. As regards the historical point of view, {{on the one hand}} the elements of complexity have been highlighted relative to data which, particularly before the seventeenth century, had been produced within cognitive and cultural contexts which are now extremely remote and beyond naturalistic logic. On the other hand, from the seventeenth century, the growing attention of the cultural élite of the era towards environmental phenomena (now being seen within a naturalistic perspective), favoured the gradual enhancement of the corpus of information, also as regards the quality of the data. 2053 effects of earthquakes on the environment are listed in the CFTI 3, classified into five categories which are in turn divided into other descriptive typologies. Many examples are also provided with the purpose of outlining the specific problems concerning the available data. As regards the geological point of view, the effects described in historical sources may be divided into two categories: the effects related to shaking, and the effects which may be due directly to the seismogenic source, generally with less territorial impact but of considerable scientific interest. Reference is also made to the various attempts to codify the environmental effects of earthquakes within the traditional macroseismic scales, although it is acknowledged that this operation is fraught with ambiguities.
