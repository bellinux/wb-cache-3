50|$|Stafford did not inherit {{properties}} {{which would}} have ensured his financial independence, and according to Dockray <b>his</b> elder <b>brother,</b> the Duke of Buckingham, did not endow him with lands {{which would have}} guaranteed him an income. It was thus perhaps for financial reasons that Stafford became one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>brother's</b> retained councillors and assisted with {{the management of the}} extensive Stafford estates. In 1500 Stafford oversaw a survey <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>brother's</b> properties in the Welsh Marches, Thornbury, and Bedminster, in 1502 he assisted with an audit <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>brother's</b> Gloucestershire estates, and from about 1500 to 1521 he served as steward, and for most of that time also as sheriff, <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>brother's</b> Welsh lordships.|$|R

50|$|Gaius' social {{reforms were}} far wider {{reaching}} than those <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>brother</b> Tiberius. Perhaps {{motivated by the}} fate <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>brother,</b> some <b>of</b> <b>his</b> earliest reforms dealt with the judiciary system. He set up two initial measures, {{the first of which}} prohibited a magistrate who had been deposed by the people from holding office a second time. Gaius's second bill established {{the right of the people}} to prosecute any magistrate who had exiled citizens without a trial. These decisions were a direct response to the Senate's actions in the aftermath <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>brother</b> Tiberius's murder.|$|R

Chauncey distributed <b>his</b> <b>brother’s</b> money, totaling $1,500,000 to various charities, mostly in the New York area.|$|R

5|$|Gediminas' origins are unclear, {{but recent}} {{research}} suggests that Skalmantas, an otherwise unknown historical figure, was Gediminas' grandfather or father and {{could be considered the}} dynasty's founder. Because none <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>brothers</b> or sisters had known heirs, Gediminas, who sired at least twelve children, had the advantage in establishing sovereignty over his siblings. Known for his diplomatic skills, Gediminas arranged his children's marriages to suit the goals of his foreign policy: his sons consolidated Lithuanian power within the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, while his daughters established or strengthened alliances with the rulers of areas in modern-day Russia, Ukraine and Poland.|$|E
