The {{connection}} between the father–son pairs of Stari Badnjak–Mladi Božić and Nikola's Dad–Nikola is corroborated by the fact that, in many East Slavic regions, practices characteristic for Christmas have been transferred to the Feast of Saint Nicholas. There is, however, an inversion in the comparison between these two pairs. In the former pair, the first stems from the mythical dragon, and the second from the dragon fighter, while in the latter pair it is vice versa. This inversion explains, by Uspensky, the fact that in some areas Nikola's Dad is celebrated on the day after his son's feast, rather than on the eve <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> In <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> the [...] "dragon" [...] (Nikola) comes before the [...] "dragon fighter" [...] (Nikola's Dad), {{as is the case with}} Stari Badnjak and Mladi Božić.|$|R

40|$|This {{article is}} based on {{fieldwork}} conducted in southern Chad on the recent adoption of female circumcision. In Myabé, a village with a population of about 1, 000, girls were first circumcised around 1980. Residents describe female circumcision and their experiences <b>of</b> <b>it</b> in <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> contrast sharply with popular notions of what female circumcision means and how it is practiced, and with the descriptions and interpretations available in the medical, public health, and anthropological literatures. In making sense of these find-ings, the author questions the reasons for the hegemony of the “standard tale ” and argues for the need to allow a plurality of stories and experiences of female circumcision to emerge. There is a story about female circumcision.

40|$|This thesis investigates how {{teachers}} from different disciplines understand and implement education {{for sustainable development}} in their teaching. A nationwide questionnaire {{study was conducted with}} 3229 upper secondary school teachers representing 224 schools in Sweden. The concept of sustainable development is complex and research has shown that teachers exhibit uncertainties in their understanding <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> and <b>that</b> the <b>way</b> they conceptualize sustainable development can have consequences for how they incorporate it into their teaching. Previous research has emphasized that Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) should promote interdisciplinary and holistic learning rather than traditional subject-based learning. This is in accordance with the Swedish curriculum, which emphasizes that all teachers in all subjects should integrate education for sustainable development. The teachers in the study were grouped into four disciplines; science-, social science-, language-, and vocational/esthetical-practical teachers.   The results showed that there were many subject-bound barriers to successful implementation of  ESD. Teachers were influenced by their subject tradition in: 1) how they understand sustainable development, 2) which teaching methods they use, 3) which barriers they experience, and 4) which teaching tradition they work within. Because <b>of</b> these differences <b>it</b> is important to adjust any further training of teachers according to their discipline. This study highlights the need for improved teacher education and further training of in-service teachers; more than 70 % of the teachers stated that they need such training. It also highlights the issue how strong subject-bound traditions make it difficult to implement general goals of the curricula such as sustainable development...|$|R
40|$|Innovation and Creativity {{issues are}} {{at the top of the}} European agenda and this offers design {{activity}} several opportunities to strengthen its role as an engine for innovation processes. But, at the same time, Innovation and Creativity are transversal to numerous other disciplines, from management to social sciences: this poses a serious threat to design since its role in product innovation is not easy to demonstrate. At Politecnico di Milano, from January 2006 until January 2008, was conducted a research project called “New conceptual models and new tools for the design driven innovation in the global economy”: in this project took part the three disciplinary key areas related to the New Product Development process (Marketing, Engineer and Design), represented by Indaco (Industrial Design, Art and COmunication) Department, to which the author belongs, and Mechanical Engineer Department, both of Politecnico di Milano, and the Business School of Bocconi University. The first step of the research project aimed at answering the following question: how is it possible to explain in concrete terms the contribution of design to product innovation? In order to do it, we decided to use a phenomenological approach, meaning to observe product innovation as a phenomenon with the aim of reaching a deeper understanding <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> <b>It</b> has <b>that</b> <b>way</b> emerged <b>that</b> a design-driven innovation process can have three possible levers (form, mode of use and technology) and four possible results (aesthetical, of use, typological and meaning innovation). In this paper, levers and results will be defined in detail, trying to emphasize both the peculiarity of each one and the relationships among them...|$|R

40|$|Magister Artium (Development Studies) - MA(DVS) Within the {{discourse}} of community development, the expression 'capacity development' stands out. Its common usage has somehow rendered it almost insignificant {{given the fact that}} those who use it tend to think <b>of</b> <b>it</b> in <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> hardly can be considered as having singular meaning. To be precise, there is no consensus as to its meanings; yet, it has not stopped its usage. The implication is that capacity development as a concept remains complex and has the tendency to erect difficulty in the attempt to operationalize it and apply it in evaluating development initiatives. However, this study presents an operational definition of capacity development in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria; levels of capacity development as well as dimensions used to evaluate on-going development projects/ policies in the region. The research method used to gather data was mixed. Quantitative method was more convenient due to the topography of the study area. However, qualitative method was introduced and utilized to guarantee the validity, authenticity and reliability of data collected. Mapping and an observation of government agencies/ organizations involved in capacity development in the study area (the Niger Delta region, by extension); questionnaires that spoke of practices supportive of capacity development in the region as well as resources available to Southern Ijaw LGA for capacity development; focused group discussions and in depth interviews that drew attention to factors affecting capacity development at all levels; individual, institutional and societal etc. these tools were means that efficiently helped in assessing the extent to which capacity development has been operationalized in post conflict Niger delta...|$|R
40|$|To {{contend that}} Schumann "viewed the {{construction}} of musical meaning as an interactive process" is, first of all, to suggest that Schumann sets himself apart from his contemporaries in this endeavor-that he is unusual in this regard. This in itself should raise suspicions. But <b>that's</b> the least <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> It doesn't take much imagination to suppose that a composer (Schumann, if you like) might anticipate that his works will elicit a response, and {{that the act of}} responding will constitute in some cases a critical act, even a performerly one. But Ferris wishes us to believe that Schumann composed as though the meaning of his works were a function of some "interactive process," by which must be meant a collaborative dialogue engaging any number of interlocutors with Schumann's text, and all that such a text implies of some shadowy authorial presence. However we think to parse such interactivity in our own minds, {{it would be helpful to}} allow that if there is something of significance to be heard in Schumann's Eichendorff Liederkreis, this significance must be immanent in all hearings <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> and <b>that</b> the <b>way</b> in which we construe the music is a function of what is signified. The subjectivity, it seems to me, resides in the music, even as it sets off sympathetic vibrations in those who must contend with it. I think I know what Ferris is getting at. Schumann's cycle, in tune with much Romantic music, intones hermeneutical riddles. To engage the riddling means less to solve a mystery than to apprehend something of its obscure complexity: not to dissolve an ambiguity, but to take some pleasure in the discomfort <b>that</b> <b>it</b> arouses. For Ferris, this "interactive process" means to insinuate a compositional strategy. As a critical strategy, as a way of contending with the dialogics of text and reader" such "interactivity" makes some sense. For the composer, it is hollow...|$|R
