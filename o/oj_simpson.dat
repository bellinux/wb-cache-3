5|$|Gatski {{was elected}} to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1985 as part of a class that {{included}} Joe Namath, Pete Rozelle, <b>O.J.</b> <b>Simpson,</b> and Roger Staubach. Gatski said he had not expected to make it into the hall. He had not played for 28 years when he was selected by an old-timers committee. Two decades later, Marshall University retired Gatski's number 72 during a homecoming game against the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Gatski was the first and remains the only Marshall football player to be so honored.|$|E
5|$|Less than threeweeks {{before the}} game, USC Trojan Reggie Bush won the Heisman trophy—since vacated—ahead of secondplace {{finisher}} Vince Young. Bush had the secondhighest number of firstplace votes in Heisman history (behind <b>O.J.</b> <b>Simpson)</b> {{and the highest}} percentage of firstplace votes, while Young had a record number of secondplace votes. Bush's 933-point margin of victory was the 17thhighest {{in the history of the}} Heisman voting. The thirdfinalist was USC's Matt Leinart, who won the Heisman trophy in 2004.

5|$|During the mid-1990s, {{television}} critics praised Jennings for {{his insistence}} on not letting the <b>O.J.</b> <b>Simpson</b> murder case swamp the newscast. Instead, Jennings devoted his energies to covering the War in Bosnia and Herzegovina, anchoring three hour-long prime time specials {{on the subject}} and one Saturday-morning special aimed at children. ABC dedicated more time to covering the conflict than any other network from 1992 to 1996. Jennings received the Goldsmith Career Award for Excellence in Journalism from the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, in large part for his passion for the story. Jennings was also credited for raising the profile in the U.S. of another international story, the 1995 Quebec referendum. The Canadian press in particular raved about his in-depth coverage of the issue, {{and he was the}} only anchor to broadcast from Canada {{on the eve of the}} referendum.|$|E
5|$|The Buccaneers scored {{their first}} points, {{but were not}} able to score enough to win, despite {{statistically}} outperforming the Buffalo Bills in most phases of the game. The Buccaneers had only three Dave Green field goals to show for seven possessions inside the Bills’ 22-yard line. <b>O.J.</b> <b>Simpson,</b> who would rush for a season total of 1,503 yards, was held to only 39 yards on twenty carries. The Bills, the highest-scoring team in recent years, were 1 of 12 in third-down conversions, and were surpassed in yardage, first downs, rushing average, and number of total plays. Buffalo took the lead on Bob Chandler’s 58-yard reception of a tipped pass. The Buccaneers’ 338 yards of offense, a great improvement over their previous two games, coincided with coach McKay’s relenting to Steve Spurrier’s demands that he be able to call his own plays. Spurrier suffered a bone chip in his throwing hand that made his status questionable for the next week’s game.|$|E
5|$|The Patriots and the Bills {{were both}} charter {{members of the}} AFL, and even competed {{with each other in}} an AFL playoff game. They have {{remained}} divisional rivals since the NFL-AFL merger. Prior to the rise of Tom Brady, the two teams shared a mellow, yet occasionally competitive rivalry, featuring highlights from players such as <b>O.J.</b> <b>Simpson,</b> Steve Grogan, Joe Ferguson, Jim Kelly, and Drew Bledsoe. However, Brady has dominated the Bills ever since taking over as the Patriots' franchise quarterback, holding a 26-3 regular season record over them. Though Patriots fans usually feel apathetic towards the Bills, Bills fans have come to despise the Patriots more than any other rival. The rivalry has remained somewhat intense in recent years with multiple players having played for both teams, the Bills usually giving their all when playing the Patriots, and the presence of Rex Ryan, who coached both the Bills and Jets and was known for his trash-talk.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, Fox premiered the TV movie The <b>O.J.</b> <b>Simpson</b> Story.

25|$|The purple {{top tube}} {{became an issue}} in the <b>O.J.</b> <b>Simpson</b> murder case when the defense alleged that small {{droplets}} of blood found at the crime scene contained the preservative EDTA.

25|$|Tommie Smith and John Carlos held {{up their}} leather glove-clad fists at the awards {{ceremony}} of the 1968 Summer Olympics. Their actions {{were intended to}} symbolize Black Power. They were banned from the Olympics for life {{as a result of}} the incident. Yet another of the more infamous episodes involving a leather glove came during the 1995 <b>O.J.</b> <b>Simpson</b> murder case in which Simpson demonstrated that the glove purportedly used in the alleged murder was too small to fit his hand.|$|E
25|$|The defense {{tried to}} {{convince}} the jury that Simpson was not physically capable of carrying out the murders, saying that Goldman was a fit young man who put up a fierce struggle against his assailant. Simpson was a 46-year-old former professional football player with chronic arthritis. He had scars on his knees from old football injuries. But Clark produced into evidence an exercise video that Simpson made {{a few months before}} the murders titled <b>O.J.</b> <b>Simpson</b> Minimum Maintenance: Fitness For Men, which showed that, despite some physical conditions and limitations, Simpson was anything but frail.|$|E
25|$|By the early/mid-1990s, some of McTavish's {{storytelling}} received {{criticism for}} being gimmick-driven (i.e. multiple dual roles, bomb plots). Reports soon surfaced that Behr and McTavish were having conflicts about storylines {{and the direction}} of the series. After the <b>O.J.</b> <b>Simpson</b> trial preempted daytime television programs throughout late 1994 and into 1995, many soaps saw their ratings decline, and All My Children was no different. When Megan McTavish was fired from her head writing post in the spring, former head writer Lorraine Broderick was tapped by Behr to lead the team once again.|$|E
25|$|Dershowitz was {{involved}} in several legal cases and is a commentator on the Arab–Israeli conflict. As a criminal appellate lawyer, he won 13 of the 15 murder and attempted murder cases he handled, and has represented a series of celebrity clients, including Mike Tyson, Patty Hearst, and Jim Bakker. His most notable cases include his role in 1984 in overturning the conviction of Claus von Bülow for the attempted murder of his wife, Sunny, and as the appellate adviser for the defense in the <b>O.J.</b> <b>Simpson</b> murder trial in 1995.|$|E
25|$|The 1967 USC vs. UCLA {{football}} game {{was one of}} the historically significant {{football game}}s of the 20th century. It matched No. 4 USC with <b>O.J.</b> <b>Simpson</b> against No. 1 UCLA with Gary Beban for the Conference Championship, National Championship, and Heisman Trophy on the line for Beban or Simpson. USC won 21–20 and went on to defeat Indiana in the Rose Bowl and win the national championship. Despite Simpson's sensational performance in this game and accumulating 1,543 rushing yards for the season, Beban won the Heisman Trophy. Simpson won the trophy the following year.|$|E
25|$|The program {{entered a}} new golden age upon the arrival of head coach John McKay (1960–1975). During this period the Trojans {{produced}} two Heisman Trophy winners (Mike Garrett and <b>O.J.</b> <b>Simpson)</b> and won four national championships (1962, 1967, 1972 and 1974). McKay's influence continued even after he departed for the NFL when an assistant coach, John Robinson (1976–1982), took over as head coach. Under Robinson, USC won another national championship in 1978 (shared with Alabama; ironically, USC defeated Alabama, 24–14, that same season) and two more players won the Heisman Trophy (Charles White and Marcus Allen).|$|E
25|$|Artist Arnold Friberg was {{commissioned}} by Chevrolet to paint a series commemorating the 100th anniversary of American intercollegiate football in 1969. He created four paintings, each representing major turning points in the intercollegiate game. Painting No. four was titled <b>O.J.</b> <b>Simpson</b> Breaks for Daylight and captures a moment in this famous Game of The Century. These paintings were used during the 1969 Chevrolet advertising campaign and {{were among the most}} demanding and exciting pieces Mr. Friberg had done. These paintings were such a success that they were taken on tour and shown at universities throughout the country.|$|E
25|$|A {{few weeks}} before the game, USC's Reggie Bush won the Heisman Trophy (since vacated in 2010) ahead of second-place {{finisher}} Vince Young. Bush had the second-highest number of first place votes in Heisman history (behind <b>O.J.</b> <b>Simpson)</b> and the highest percentage of first-place votes, while Young had a record number of second-place votes. Bush's 933-point margin of victory was the 17th highest in Heisman voting history. The other finalist was USC's Matt Leinart, who had won the Heisman trophy in 2004. This meant that the Rose Bowl would mark the first time that two Heisman-trophy winners had ever played in the same backfield.|$|E
25|$|He {{received}} his first national exposure for his daily roundup of the <b>O.J.</b> <b>Simpson</b> trial. After that, {{he continued to}} host his regular show on WLS (AM). Eventually he teamed up with Garry Meier to cohost the highly successful Roe & Garry Show. In 2004, amid an impasse in contract negotiations with the station, Meier did not renew his contract with WLS. Roe then became the sole host of the show, which also featured Jim Johnson and Christina Filiaggi. Many praise Roe Conn for having {{a good sense of}} humor and for being skilled at articulating his thoughts. In the spring 2006 ratings period, The Roe Conn Show became Chicago’s most listened-to radio talk show among adults.|$|E
25|$|In early 1994 Kelvin MacKenzie, {{former editor}} of The Sun newspaper, was {{appointed}} managing director of BSkyB, Sky News's parent company at the time. MacKenzie's proposed changes to Sky News led to clashes with CEO Sam Chisholm {{and the head of}} Sky News, Ian Frykberg, who protested at what they saw as an attempt to take the channel's news values downmarket. The most ferocious battle occurred when Mackenzie wanted Sky News to run an interview with Lady Bienvenida Buck. Frykberg refused to air the interview and resigned shortly afterwards. The interview was broadcast on Sky One. MacKenzie announced his resignation in August 1994, but not before Sky News had transmitted live pictures of the freeway chase of <b>OJ</b> <b>Simpson</b> white Bronco on 17 June 1994 bringing US helicopter journalism to the UK.|$|E
25|$|The CIB hired renowned {{forensic}} scientist Henry Lee ({{forensic scientist}}) {{to examine the}} physical evidence. Dr. Henry Lee was famous for defending <b>O.J.</b> <b>Simpson</b> {{in the murder of}} his wife and lover, and helped acquit Simpson based on the LAPD's lack of professionalism and possibility of planted evidence at the murder site. Dr. Henry Lee and his team of Americans had previously established the belly wound was in fact a gunshot wound, and then claimed the windshield hole had been struck from the outside based on the lack of windshield powder outside the jeep. Despite widespread speculation that the casings were planted on the street, Lee expressed no concern regarding the origin of the evidence even though the casings had been found some 3½ hours after the incident occurred and street cleaning had cleaned up the firecracker debris. Dr. Lee was also not critical of the local police and National Security Bureau's inability to secure the scene of the incident afterwards until the casings were found.|$|E
500|$|The {{season was}} defined by <b>O.J.</b> <b>Simpson.</b> [...] The fifth-year running back became the first player in NFL history to rush for 2,000yards in a season. Behind Simpson's record-setting season, the Bills set an NFL record for most team rushing yards in a 14-game season, with 3,088 and {{averaged}} 5.1 yards per carry, higher than every Super Bowl championship team in all of league history. [...] Simpson was returning from his best professional season, in which he earned his first All-Pro recognition and first rushing title. In addition to establishing a then-record for single-season rushing yardage, with 2,003, Simpson established the single-season record for rushing yards gained per game (143.1 yards per game on 23.7 rushes per game, an average of six yards per carry), which still stands. The explosive offense centered on <b>O.J.</b> <b>Simpson</b> was nicknamed the [...] "Electric Company" [...] {{for its ability to}} turn on [...] "The Juice" [...] (i.e. [...] "O.J." [...] Simpson) ...|$|E
500|$|The Electric Company {{were the}} {{offensive}} line of the Buffalo Bills during the mid-1970s that helped running back <b>O.J.</b> <b>Simpson</b> establish numerous National Football League (NFL) all-time records and earn numerous statistical titles.
