5|$|Scientists will {{probably}} never be certain <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>largest</b> <b>and</b> smallest dinosaurs to have ever existed.

Few of the specimens that are recovered are complete skeletons, and impressions of skin and other soft tissues are rare. Rebuilding a complete skeleton by comparing the size and morphology of bones to those of similar, better-known species is an inexact art, and reconstructing the muscles and other organs of the living animal is, at best, a process of educated guesswork.|$|E
