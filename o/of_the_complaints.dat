5|$|A {{study by}} the Hong Kong-based Political and Economic Risk Consultancy, {{released}} in 2012, ranked and rated Indian bureaucracy as the worst in Asia with a 9.21 rating out of 10. According to the study, India's inefficient and corrupt bureaucracy was responsible for most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>complaints</b> that business executive have about the country. A paper prepared in 2012 by the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions states that corruption is prevalent at all levels in civil services and it is institutionalised.|$|E
5|$|New {{legislation}} {{stopped the}} TMB from investigating anonymous complaints concerning physicians {{as of the}} fall of 2011. The change was seen as a victory by physicians rights groups, who said that it would promote accountability in the investigations of physicians. Other groups worried that the new law would discourage the reporting of legitimate complaints against physicians. The board received 6,849 complaints in 2010; four percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>complaints</b> were submitted anonymously.|$|E
5|$|Influential {{players and}} journalists belittled the 1894 match {{both before and}} after it took place. Lasker's {{difficulty}} in getting backing may have been caused by hostile pre-match comments from Gunsberg and Leopold Hoffer, who had long been a bitter enemy of Steinitz. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>complaints</b> was that Lasker had never played the other two members of the top four, Siegbert Tarrasch and Mikhail Chigorin – although Tarrasch had rejected a challenge from Lasker in 1892, publicly telling him to go and win an international tournament first. After the match, some commentators, notably Tarrasch, said Lasker had won mainly because Steinitz was old (58 in 1894).|$|E
5|$|Mitchell and Galle sent an {{anonymous}} <b>complaint</b> to <b>the</b> TMB detailing their concerns with Arafiles's care of nine patients in 2008 and 2009. The letter {{said that the}} nurses feared losing their jobs if their identities were revealed in connection with <b>the</b> <b>complaint.</b> Arafiles became aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>complaint</b> and spoke to Winkler County Sheriff Robert Roberts, alleging that <b>the</b> <b>complaint</b> amounted to harassment. The TMB issued a copy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>complaint</b> to Roberts {{with the understanding that}} it would only be used to investigate criminal activity by Arafiles. Roberts sent <b>the</b> <b>complaint</b> to Arafiles and to WCMH administrator Stan Wiley.

5|$|Ruby and Sapphire {{received}} mostly positive reviews, though {{critics were}} divided in their {{assessment of the}} games, especially on the gameplay and graphics. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>complaints</b> focused {{on the fact that}} the gameplay had not changed much since previous generations, and the connectivity issues revolving around the past generations. With the popularity of Pokémon waning at the time, the games sold less than previous generations. However, they were still critical and commercial successes; with around 16 million copies sold according to IGN, they are the best-selling games for the Game Boy Advance.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} of Kingdom Hearts II {{is similar}} to the action RPG and hack and slash gameplay of the first Kingdom Hearts game, though developers made an effort to address some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>complaints</b> with the previous game. The player directly controls Sora from a third-person camera angle, though first-person perspective is available via Select button. Most of the gameplay occurs on interconnected field maps where battles take place. The game is driven by a linear progression from one story event to the next, usually told via cutscenes, though there are numerous side-quests available that provide bonuses to characters.|$|E
5|$|While these {{guns were}} {{considered}} an improvement by the Navy over {{that of the}} South Carolinas, their placement remained problematic as even in calm water, they were extremely wet and thus difficult to man. The forward guns were moved into the superstructure after sea trials. The casemate-mounted secondary armament was one deck below the main deck and provided the majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>complaints</b> from shipping water from the forward positions and breaking {{the flow of the}} bow wave imparting extra drag on the design.|$|E

5|$|Despite the support, {{the state}} caved to some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>complaints</b> of the opposition, {{resulting}} in a delay of the project. By November1963, the state told Caroline officials that the design of bridges along NY330 required changing to new state highway standards. The state began working also on assessing property values of the land required for the new position. They stated that unless the state budget could not afford it, the project would begin the process in 1964. Patience ran thin by February1964 with the Caroline town officials, who demanded progress from the state, who stated that the project could not move forward until there was funding. By November1964, the state admitted nothing would happen until at least 1965, two years behind schedule. This time, the construction would be delayed due to delays in acquiring land and personnel.|$|E
5|$|Preckwinkle {{chairs the}} ward organization, the Fourth Ward Democratic Organization, {{which was one}} of sixteen Chicago Democratic ward {{organizations}} named in a complaint filed on August 31, 2005 with the Illinois State Board of Elections by the Cook County Republican Party charging that Democratic Party ward organizations are illegally housed in City-funded neighborhood ward offices. Taxpayers fund aldermanic service centers, which are open to the public. State law prohibits the use of public funds by any candidate for political or campaign purposes. The complaint against Preckwinkle's ward organization was one of nine that a Hearing Officer appointed by the Board recommended proceed to the next step of the hearing process, an Open Preliminary Hearing. On October 17, 2005, at a regularly scheduled meeting of the Board of Elections, the Board entered an executive session and voted, in a 4–4 tie, along strict party lines, failing to adopt the recommendation of the Hearing Officer, and ordered the complaints dismissed. The complaint against Preckwinkle's ward organization was one of eight that the Cook County Republican Party appealed {{all the way to the}} Supreme Court of Illinois. On January 23, 2009, the Illinois Supreme Court unanimously ordered the Illinois appellate court to conduct a judicial review of the Board's dismissals <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>complaints.</b>|$|E
5|$|Word that Lewis was {{developing}} his own {{solutions to the}} minimum range problem reached the AI team at St Athan some time in early 1940. Bowen was extremely upset. He had become used {{to the way the}} researchers had been put into an ill-advised attempt at production but now Rowe was directly removing them from the research effort as well. Tizard heard <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>complaints</b> and visited Dundee in an attempt to smooth them over, which evidently failed. On 29 March 1940 a memo from Watt's DCD office announced a reorganization of the Airborne Group. Gerald Touch would move to the RAE to help develop production, installation and maintenance procedures for the Mk. IV, several other members would disperse to RAF airfields to help train the ground and air crews directly on the units, {{while the rest of the}} team, including Lovell and Hodgkin, would re-join the main radar research teams in Dundee. Bowen was notably left out of the reorganization; his involvement in AI ended. In late July, Bowen was invited to join the Tizard Mission, which left for the US in August 1940.|$|E
