5|$|In {{the final}} two episodes, it is {{revealed}} that Wirt and Greg are actually two boys from the modern era. Wirt and Greg's strange appearance {{stems from the fact}} that the night they entered the Unknown was Halloween. Wirt, attempting to take back an embarrassing poetry tape he made for a girl he likes, had followed her to a graveyard scary story gathering before a police officer scared him and Greg into jumping over the cemetery's garden wall. On the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> they landed on train tracks where Greg was almost hit by a train. Wirt pushed them both off a hill into a lake/river in an attempt to save him, knocking them both unconscious in the process and sending them to a Limbo-like realm between life and death.|$|E

25|$|Brockie {{was killed}} at Ypres in 1915, but a {{simmering}} controversy broke out between Churchill and Haldane {{until his death}} in 1950 as to the exact events of that night. Haldane claimed that the party had again agreed to defer their escape, but that Churchill had then gone over the wall by himself. Churchill's account describes him waiting behind the wall {{for more than an hour}} for the others to join him, and then a discussion between them through the wall, where the others told him the sentry was suspicious and they could not escape. Haldane agreed a conversation took place, but not how Churchill had come to be on the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> while they had not.|$|E
25|$|The Southport Gates {{were built}} {{in place of the}} old Puerta de África in the lower section of the wall. Deadman's Cemetery used to be located on the inner (north) side of the wall, above the Southport Gates with some of the headstones dating back to 1738. In 1798 Southport Ditch Cemetery (later renamed Trafalgar Cemetery in honour of the Battle of Trafalgar) was consecrated, a small {{graveyard}} on the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> from Deadman's Cemetery. Many of the tombstones are those of victims of the 1804, 1813 and 1814 yellow fever epidemics. Trafalgar Cemetery fell into disuse after 1814. In 1929 Deadman's Cemetery became part of St. Jago's Barracks and was turned into a ball alley and rifle range, with the headstones relocated to Trafalgar Cemetery in 1932 and embedded into one of the walls.|$|E

500|$|John Heisman, {{now head}} coach of Georgia Tech (also undefeated), {{challenged}} Warner to a post-season game. Warner declined and the game was postponed until the following season, giving Tech the 1917 national championship (the first for any Southern school). On November 23, 1918 the two teams played at Pittsburgh. At the stadium where the game was to be played, the locker rooms were next to each other, with only a thin wall separating the two teams prior to the game. Heisman was first to begin an inspirational speech and {{it was said that}} he passionately described both heroes of Ancient Greece as well as the tragedy of a soldier found in his armor among the ruins of Pompeii. Because of Georgia Tech's players silence the speech was crystal clear on the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> Upon its finish Warner smiled and quietly told his players [...] "Okay, boys. There's the speech. Now go out and knock them off." [...] Pittsburgh defeated Georgia Tech 32–0.|$|E
500|$|In this {{restoration}} {{the entire}} crossing was strengthened by bracing it behind the dome and securing {{it to the}} superstructure of the building. [...] The roofs, which had not been replaced since 1913, were rebuilt with plywood diaphragms, 30,000 new red clay tiles were installed, and the stones from the decorative arches were reinserted. [...] The wing of the damaged angel was restored; Stanford University hired William Kreysler and Associates {{to create a new}} backing system to secure this angel and three other mosaic angels {{to the base of the}} dome. [...] The renovators found a piece of the original mosaic from the vestibule wall, which had a Chi Rho design, in the foundation, and inserted it into the Communion Table in the chancel, linking the current building with the pre-1906 church. [...] The Victorian chandeliers were repaired and rewired, and the transept balconies, which had been closed for twenty years because they were declared unsafe, were reopened, after the false doors on the south side of each balcony were replaced by emergency exits and connected to existing staircases on the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> [...] Stanford Memorial Church was rededicated by chaplain Robert C.

2500|$|Despite the {{reliance}} on flying stunts and their inherent danger, the one near-tragedy occurred on the ground when a stunt went wrong. Stuntman Ken Buckle inadvertently turned the throttle to full on a runaway motorbike and sidecar, launching himself through the retaining wall on the sloped Brookley racing track and crashing into the adjoining cesspool, off-camera. Thinking quickly, the special effects man on the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> saw the motorbike hurtling towards him and set off the accompanying explosion, creating a realistic waterspout. Lucky to escape with only facial bruises and a dislocated collarbone, {{as he struggled to}} his feet, Buckle apologised for having messed up, but the shot [...] "was in the can".|$|E
