5|$|As {{a member}} of the Saint Petersburg music scene, Prokofiev {{developed}} a reputation as a musical rebel, while getting praise for his original compositions, which he performed himself <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>piano.</b> In 1909, he graduated from his class in composition with unimpressive marks. He continued at the Conservatory, studying piano under Anna Yesipova and continuing his conducting lessons under Tcherepnin.|$|E

The album also included orchestral arrangements of the songs by Sir James MacMillan and others.|$|E

50|$|Jane Carr's daughter, Charlotte Donaldson-Hudson, {{the great}} granddaughter of Charles Donaldson-Hudson talked about Noël Coward writing {{the song and}} playing it <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>pianos</b> at her mother's flat in a BBC radio {{broadcast}} from 4 May 2011, about the festival of Britain.

5|$|Jarre {{was raised}} in Lyon by his mother and grandparents, and trained <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>piano.</b> From an early age, he was {{introduced}} {{to a variety of}} art forms, including those of street performers, jazz musicians, and the artist Pierre Soulages. He played guitar in a band, but his musical style was perhaps most heavily influenced by Pierre Schaeffer, a pioneer of musique concrète at the Groupe de Recherches Musicales.|$|E
5|$|Like the Colosseum, {{the three}} façades have a {{different}} order of architecture on each floor: Doric on the ground level, then Ionic <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>piano</b> nobile and finishing with Corinthian on the upper floor, {{the style of the}} building thus becoming progressively more ornate as it rises.|$|E
5|$|Mendelssohn was renowned {{during his}} {{lifetime}} as a keyboard performer, both <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>piano</b> and on the organ.

50|$|The third {{movement}} is a passacaglia based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>piano's</b> opening eight-bar bass line, which {{is derived from}} the first theme of the Pantoum. The cello joins next, followed by the violin. While the melody is passed between the three instruments, the movement builds singlemindedly to a powerful climax, then dies away.|$|R
5|$|The first notable {{musician}} {{to use the}} Mellotron was variety pianist Geoff Unwin, who {{was specifically}} hired by Robinson in 1962 to promote {{the use of the}} instrument. He toured with a Mk II Mellotron and made numerous appearances on television and radio. Unwin claimed that the automatic backing tracks on the Mk II's left hand keyboard allowed him to provide more accomplished performances than his own basic skills <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>piano</b> could provide.|$|E
5|$|While Smith {{tends to}} write the lyrics and chords, song writing overall is a {{collaborative}} effort. The song writing starts with Smith <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>piano</b> or acoustic guitar where he records them and sends them to the other band members where the song is turned into a full 'Editors song'. Smith {{has said that he}} purposely makes the lyrics ambiguous so people can draw their own conclusions.|$|E
5|$|Mulgrew Miller {{was born}} in Greenwood, Mississippi, to parents who had been raised on plantations. He had three {{brothers}} and four sisters. His family was not musical, {{but they had a}} piano, which no-one in the house could play. Miller, however, played tunes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>piano</b> from the age of six, playing by ear. He had piano lessons from the age of eight. As a child, he played blues and rhythm and blues for dances, and gospel music in a church. His family was Methodist, but he played in churches of various denominations. His principal influence on piano at this stage was Ramsey Lewis.|$|E

5|$|Terry-Thomas, {{along with}} his Stars in Battledress unit, {{travelled}} through Britain and Europe on a tour that lasted several months. After the tour, and with his demobilisation approaching, he took compassionate leave {{in order to have}} free time while still receiving army pay. During his absence he went {{on a tour of the}} UK organised by George Black, accompanied <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>piano</b> by a former colonel, Harry Sutcliffe. Terry-Thomas finished the war as a sergeant, and was finally demobbed on 1 April 1946.|$|E
5|$|The Circus {{consists}} of three long, curved terraces designed by the elder John Wood to form a circular space or theatre intended for civic functions and games. The games give {{a clue to the}} design, the inspiration behind which was the Colosseum in Rome. Like the Colosseum, the three façades have a different order of architecture on each floor: Doric on the ground level, then Ionic <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>piano</b> nobile, and finishing with Corinthian on the upper floor, the style of the building thus becoming progressively more ornate as it rises. Wood never lived to see his unique example of town planning completed as he died five days after personally laying the foundation stone on 18 May 1754.|$|E
5|$|The {{plans for}} Holkham {{were of a}} large central block of two floors only, {{containing}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>piano</b> nobile level a series of symmetrically balanced state rooms situated around two courtyards. No hint of these courtyards is given externally; they are intended for lighting rather than recreation or architectural value. This great central block is flanked by four smaller, rectangular blocks, or wings, and at each corners {{is linked to the}} main house not by long colonnadesas would have been the norm in Palladian architecturebut by short two-storey wings of only one bay.|$|E

50|$|The {{piece is}} in 6/4 time, {{with a key}} {{signature}} of G major and a tempo marking andantino grazioso. The slow cello melody is accompanied by almost constant broken chord figurations <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>pianos.</b> When performed as a separate movement, not {{in the context of}} The Carnival, The Swan is frequently played with accompaniment on only one piano.|$|R

5|$|The principal, or South façade, is 344feet (104.9m) {{in length}} (from {{each of the}} {{flanking}} wings to the other), its austerity relieved <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>piano</b> nobile level only by a great six-columned portico. Each end of the central block is terminated by a slight projection, containing a Venetian window surmounted by a single storey square tower and capped roof, similar to those employed by Inigo Jones at Wilton House nearly a century earlier. A near identical portico was designed by Inigo Jones and Isaac de Caus for the Palladian front at Wilton, but this was never executed.|$|E
5|$|There {{are four}} {{versions}} of the video. The full, long version is one minute longer than the Making the Video version, while the cut version omits the scenes in which she leaves the airport and is sleepy and in which she fills out the questionnaire. The short version begins with Stefani practicing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>piano</b> and her finding the watch just seconds after that. Her being billed is not shown in this version, so the video ends with the Harajuku Girls laughing at her performance.|$|E
5|$|As in {{the rest}} of Italy, the finest and most {{decorated}} rooms were those <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>piano</b> nobile, reserved for guests and entertaining. Entered formally from the external Baroque double staircase, these rooms consisted of a suite of large and small salons, with one very large salon being the principal room of the house, often used as a ballroom. Sometimes the guest bedrooms were sited here too, {{but by the end of}} the 18th century they were more often on a secondary floor above. If decorated during the Baroque era, the rooms would be profusely ornamented. Walls were frequently mirrored, the mirrors inset into gilded frames in the walls, often alternating with paintings similarly framed, while moulded nymphs and shepherdesses decorated the spaces between. Ceilings were high and frescoed, and from the ceiling hung huge coloured chandeliers of Murano glass, while further light came from gilded sconces flanking the mirrors adorning the walls. One of the most notable rooms in this style is the Gallery of Mirrors in Palermo's Palazzo Valguarnera-Gangi (Illustration 17). This room with its frescoed ceiling by Gaspare Fumagalli is, however, one of the few Baroque rooms in this Baroque palazzo, which was (from 1750) extended and transformed by its owner Marianna Valguarnera, mostly in the later neoclassical style.|$|E
