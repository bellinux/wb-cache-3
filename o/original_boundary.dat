25|$|It was {{originally}} {{administered by the}} Municipal Borough of Barnes, with the adjacent Richmond Cemetery being administered by the Municipal Borough of Richmond (Surrey). Since 1965, when both boroughs joined the Municipal Borough of Twickenham to form the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames, the two cemeteries have been administered by Richmond upon Thames London Borough Council. The entrance to the cemetery is set back from the road along an avenue flanked by trees and behind a pair of brick gate piers; an entrance described at resembling {{the entrance to a}} country house. An air-raid shelter was built near the entrance during the Second World War.

25|$|East Sheen Cemetery, {{originally}} {{known as}} Barnes Cemetery, is a cemetery on Sheen Road in East Sheen in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames, England. The cemetery opened in 1906 {{on what was}} previously woodland {{in a rural area}} of Surrey. Originally, only half the site was given over for burials while the other half was maintained as a nursery before it was converted in the 1930s and the whole site was renamed East Sheen Cemetery. It is today contiguous with Richmond Cemetery, though the <b>original</b> <b>boundary</b> is marked by a hedge. The cemetery's chapel is used for services by both sites, as Richmond Cemetery's chapel is no longer in use as such. The chapel was built in 1906 in the Gothic revival style by local architect Reginald Rowell, who was himself later buried in the cemetery.|$|E
25|$|The ward {{boundaries}} {{were reviewed}} in 2000 {{and resulted in}} two notable changes to Beeston's western boundary. In the northwest, Beeston Cemetery and the residential streets immediately surrounding it (to the south of Derby Road) such as Coniston Road and Windermere Road, {{as well as the}} Nuseryman pub and the eastern part of Beeston Fields Golf Course, were transferred to the Bramcote ward. Beeston did however gain some territory from Chilwell, including residential streets such as Park Road, Grove Avenue and Cumberland Avenue, as well as Central College and the small industrial area between Holly Lane and Wilmot Lane. The <b>original</b> <b>boundary</b> between the old Beeston and Chilwell parishes can still be identified by the change in road name {{at the site of the}} Hop Pole pub, from Chilwell Road (on the Beeston side) to High Road (on the Chilwell side).|$|E
25|$|The Pakistan-India {{boundary}} continues irregularly southward {{for about}} 1,280 kilometers, following {{the line of}} the 1947 Radcliffe Award, named for Sir Cyril Radcliffe, the head of the British boundary commission on the division of the Punjabs of Pakistan and in united Bengal of India into Pakistan's Eastern wing of Mashriqi-Pakistan on 13 August 1947. Although this boundary with India referring only to present-day Pakistan and not aimed at formerly East Pakistan borders except only all three governments claiming the status of the district of Firozpur and Pathankot between Pakistan and India. It remains another unresolved issue although it is not formally disputed; passions still run very high indeed {{on both sides of the}} international border. Many had expected the <b>original</b> <b>boundary</b> line to run farther to the west, thereby ceding the Lahore region to India, possibly granting them all of Gujranwala Division: Sialkot, Narowal, Gujrat, districts and Sheikhupura, Okara, Kasur districts of Lahore Division; and others had expected the line to run much farther east, possibly granting them control of Delhi, the imperial capital of the Mughal Empire including an east Punjab state for Sikhs of their own to govern.|$|E

500|$|The {{remains of}} the Caludon estate are today located in Wyken, a {{suburban}} area {{to the east of}} Coventry city centre. However, until portions of it were sold off in the 19th century, the estate was much more expansive. The estate was historically a detached part of St. Michael's parish, but was transferred to Wyken in 1884, which in turn was absorbed into the City of Coventry in 1928. The <b>original</b> <b>boundary</b> of the estate ran from Sowe Bridge (now known as Clifford Bridge, [...] ) over the River Sowe in the south-east to high ground near Stoke Heath in the north-west.|$|E
500|$|As the {{railroad}} age evolved, business-oriented Southerners {{saw that a}} railroad linking the South with the Pacific Coast would expand trade opportunities. [...] They thought the topography of the southern portion of the <b>original</b> <b>boundary</b> line to the Mexican Cession (future states of California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, western Colorado) of 1848 was too mountainous to allow a direct route. Projected southern railroad routes tended to veer to the north as they proceeded eastward, which would favor connections with northern railroads and ultimately favor northern seaports. Southerners saw that to avoid the mountains, a route with a southeastern terminus might need to swing south into what was still Mexican territory.|$|E

Saville, Inc., dated September 15, 1926. In 1928, Virginia Weddell requested that a two-story porch be added to expand the master bedroom suite and to build a second-floor sunroom. This was constructed in January 1932 by the contracting firm of Claiborne and Taylor, and was designed again by Henry Morse using Briar Hill sandstone. Further developments {{were made in the}} 1930s. On May 29, 1935, a shipment of Cotswold Stone Roofing Slate arrived from England. Thicker, heavier and lighter in color than Virginia Buckingham Slate, the Cotswold slate was used to emphasize the height of the steep roof. On April 14, 1936, an adjacent [...] lot was purchased to accommodate an expansive landscape plan.|$|E
2500|$|When {{contemporary}} records {{begin in}} the 5th century, there is a thriving community of farmers and fishermen in existence {{in the vicinity of}} Cornmarket and High Street.

Located on a prominent ridge overlooking the River Liffey (previously known as the Ruirthech, [...] "running swiftly"), this settlement was easily defended and ideally situated to take advantage of the ford, which lay just 100 metres away.|$|E
