50|$|Tests for {{osteochondroma}} {{can also}} identify {{diseases such as}} secondary peripheral chondrosarcoma and Multiple <b>osteochondromatosis.</b> In large, secondary chondrosarcoma arises {{at the site of}} osteochondroma due to increased thickness of the cartilage cap indicating potential malignant transformation. The symptoms of multiple <b>osteochondromatosis</b> are similar to solitary osteochondroma, but they are often more severe. Painless bumps can arise at the site of tumor and pain and other discomforts can also take place if pressure is put on the soft tissues, nerves, or blood vessels. Dysplasia Epiphysealis Hemimelica (DEH) or Trevor's disease and metachondromatosis (MC) are considered differential diagnosis of both solitary and hereditary osteochondromas. DEH is described as a type of over growth at one or more epiphyses. Similar to osteochondroma, DEH is diagnosed prior to 15 years of age and the growth of lesions end at puberty, when the growth plates close. Metachondromatosis is a rare disorder that exhibit symptoms of both multiple osteochondromas and enchondromas in children and is also inherited in autosomal dominant mode.|$|E

40|$|Osteopoikilosis {{presents}} as round or ovoid sclerotic lesions with {{an appearance}} like enostosis on pathology. Synovial <b>osteochondromatosis</b> occurs due to cartilaginous metaplasia with synovial villous proliferation with calcified nodules in proximity to joints. A case of osteopoikilosis associated with synovial <b>osteochondromatosis</b> is described. Intraosseus and juxta osseus sclerotic bone lesions were identified on radiographs and computed tomography {{in a patient}} with knee pain.

40|$|Synovial <b>osteochondromatosis</b> of {{the distal}} radioulnar joint {{is a rare}} entity with only 14 cases {{reported}} in the literature. Malignant transformation of synovial <b>osteochondromatosis</b> is the most worrisome complication of the disease. It has been described in joints such as the hip and knee but never for the distal radioulnar joint. We report a case of synovial <b>osteochondromatosis</b> of the distal radioulnar joint which presented with radiographic features which were worrisome for malignant transformation and required a comprehensive preoperative workup.

30|$|Synovial <b>osteochondromatosis</b> is an {{idiopathic}} benign chondral and/or osseous metaplasia of the synovia. Its exact aetiology {{remains unknown}} and it presents loose {{bodies in the}} synovial cavity [31] (Fig.  18). Although standard radiographs can show radiopaque calcifications and intra-articular loose bodies, MRI is the imaging technique of choice in the accurate assessment of synovial <b>osteochondromatosis.</b>|$|E
40|$|Synovial <b>osteochondromatosis</b> {{of the hip}} is a rare condition, and the {{surgical}} treatment approach for this condition requires complete removal of loose bodies combined with synovectomy. While these, procedures are generally accepted as the optimal treatment method, this is still controversial topic. Recent studies have reported that open surgical procedures remain acceptable for synovial <b>osteochondromatosis</b> of the hip. These procedures include the dislocation of the femoral head, and complications such as femoral head necrosis and bursitis or great trochanter non-union due to trochanteric osteotomy have been reported. The present study reports a modified technique for surgical dislocation through a Z-shaped capsular incision without trochanteric flip osteotomy {{for the treatment of}} synovial <b>osteochondromatosis</b> of the hip...|$|E
40|$|Arthroscopic {{excision}} of synovial <b>osteochondromatosis</b> {{of the hip}} is commonly performed. However, when the lesion extends to the extra-articular space of the hip joint, excision using arthroscopy becomes difficult. Although surgical dislocation of the hip with a trochanteric flip osteotomy is commonly used, manual access to the inferomedial portion of the acetabulum remains difficult. In this case report, we describe arthroscopic resection followed by open surgery using an anterior approach with or without surgical dislocation to excise a synovial <b>osteochondromatosis</b> of the hip that had extended to the extra-articular space and formed a herniation sac. Excision was completed without complications. An anterior approach with or without surgical dislocation {{should be considered as}} a surgical option for the treatment of a massive synovial <b>osteochondromatosis</b> of the hip joint...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACTObjective: The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to show the results achieved in the treatment of hip <b>osteochondromatosis</b> by arthroscopy. Methods: Six patients submitted to hip arthroscopy for synovial <b>osteochondromatosis</b> have been assessed for pre- and postoperative function and pain. The time of preoperative complaint ranged from nine to 48 months, in an average of 28. 2 months and the follow-up ranged from eight to 25 months (mean: 17. 1 months). Mean age was 45. 1 years, with four female patients (66. 6 %) and the right side affected in five cases (83. 3 %). Results: Concerning the results according to Byrd-modified Harris' criteria, the mean score evolved from 54. 1 to 90. 4, and the mean score on the face expressions scale for pain assessment ranged from 1. 7 to 5. 1.

40|$|AbstractSynovial <b>osteochondromatosis</b> is {{a benign}} proliferative {{disorder}} with metaplasia of the synovial membrane {{that affects the}} fibroblasts of the synovial joints, tendons and bursae.

The objective {{of this article was}} to report a case of synovial <b>osteochondromatosis</b> of the elbow in a patient aged 32, basketball athlete, in which surgical treatment was chosen because of the pain and functional limitation and stage of disease with multiple loose bodies. Patient 32, male, presented with pain and limitation of motion of the elbow. The range of passive motion was 100 ° of flexion and 30 ° extension. The range of active motion was 40 – 90 °. Magnetic resonance observed many loose bodies mainly in the posterior compartment in the olecranon fossa plus some chondral lesions in the capitellum. The arthroscopic treatment was chosen with two anteriors portals (medial and lateral) and two posterior portals (standard posterior and posterolateral) for easing loose bodies and osteoplasty of the olecranon fossa. The visual analog scale pain was 9 – 3 and its arc of active motion was 110 ° to − 20 ° of flexion and extension. On a scale of performance from Mayo Clinic patients was 65 points preoperatively to 90 postoperatively with 9 months follow-up and the patient was satisfied with the treatment outcome.

40|$|Primary {{synovial}} <b>osteochondromatosis</b> is {{an unusual}} condition, which generally involves otherwise normal joints.

We report a case with the clinical findings, radiographic features, surgical and histological data of primary subacromial-subdeltoid bursa synovitis. X-ray radiographs of the right glenohumeral joint as well as CT and MRI of the right shoulder zone were performed. A soft tissue mass around the lateral margin of the proximal humerus without evidence of any calcification/ ossification or erosion of the adjacent cortex was detected on both X-Rays and CT images.

Materials and Methods: Radiographs and MR images of 15 patients with idiopathic synovial <b>osteochondromatosis</b> of the hip were assessed.
