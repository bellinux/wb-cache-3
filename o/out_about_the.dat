5|$|According {{to his own}} account, {{the idea}} for writing Dreamtime first came to Duerr {{when he was in}} New Mexico in the summer of 1963. He had spent the day visiting the Puye Cliff Dwellings and was {{returning}} to the Albuquerque Greyhound Bus Station, where he met a Tewa Native yerbatero (herbalist) buying a cup of coffee, and struck up a conversation. Duerr asked the yerbatero if he could help him find a Native family living in one of the pueblos north of Santa Fe with whom he could stay, to conduct anthropological research into the nightly dances {{that took place in the}} subterranean kivas. The Native told him that if he wanted to find <b>out</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> dances in the kivas, then he should go to the Pueblo of Our Lady of the Angels and study at the University of California.

5|$|After {{returning}} to England, Spurr {{worked as a}} journalist.

For the American side of the story, he interviewed US naval commanders and personnel involved in the sinking of Yamato.

Shahid Kapoor played both Charlie and Guddu, twin brothers with speech impediments; Charlie has a lisp and Guddu stammers. The producers did not want them to look like caricatures, so Kapoor prepared for both roles by meeting and interacting with speech therapists and people with these impediments. According to Kapoor, the producers wanted to find <b>out</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> medical reasons for the impediments and their mental effects. They met specialists and thoroughly researched stammering and lisping. Kapoor said that each role had its own challenges. Charlie's physique was very different from Kapoor's and it took him nearly a year to change the look of his body. He found changing from one character to the other difficult.|$|E
