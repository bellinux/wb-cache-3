5|$|The Palmyrenes were pagans and worshiped {{a number}} of Semitic gods, with Bel {{at the head of}} their pantheon. Zenobia {{accommodated}} Christians and Jews, and ancient sources made many claims about the queen's beliefs; Manichaeist sources alleged that Zenobia was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>own.</b> It is more likely, however, that Zenobia tolerated all cults in an effort to attract support from groups marginalized by Rome.|$|E

At the same time, the Kitaki crime family hires him to defend <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>own,</b> Wocky Kitaki, in a murder trial concerning the death of Dr. Pal Meraktis.

5|$|Although many Canadians {{have come}} to view Brock as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>own,</b> Brock never really felt at home in Canada. On the whole, he viewed {{the country as a}} backwater, and earnestly wished to return to Europe to fight against Napoleon. Brock mistrusted the Canadian colonists, many of whom he {{suspected}} of being American sympathizers, and he was reluctant to arm them indiscriminately to help defend the colonies. He favoured expansion of volunteer forces which could be trained and supervised, as well as the use of British regulars and Tecumseh's warriors.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of a}} large {{attack on}} the Thanh Hóa Bridge on 3 April, the VPAF first {{appeared}} with two flights of four MiG-17s launched from Noi Bai airbase and shot down an F-8 Crusader for the cost of <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> aircraft written off when it landed on a river bed after running short of fuel. A repeat the next day resulted in a classic dogfight with F-100 Super Sabres and F-105s fighting with more MiG-17s. In total, the USAF lost eleven aircraft to air and ground forces, while the VPAF lost three of their fighters.|$|E
50|$|By {{the time}} of the Renaissance, most European monarchs had either {{acquired}} an existing order of chivalry, or created new <b>ones</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>own,</b> to reward loyal civilian and especially military officials. Such orders remained out of reach to the general public, however, as being of noble rank or birth was usually a prerequisite to being admitted.|$|R

5|$|Having {{regained the}} ball, Wake Forest {{answered}} Georgia Tech's drive with <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>own.</b> Several Wake running backs rushed with the ball, {{but it was}} Wake Forest quarterback Riley Skinner who advanced the ball the most. He completed a 24-yard pass to Willie Idlette, then an eight-yard toss to Nate Morton. Inside Tech territory, Wake's offense stumbled. Skinner was sacked by a Tech defender, and kicker Sam Swank was sent into the game to attempt a 45-yard field goal. Swank's kick was no good, and with 7:26 remaining in the second quarter, Georgia Tech still had a 30 lead.|$|E
5|$|Heavy rains fell {{during the}} night of September 5-6 and mud slowed all wheeled and tracked {{vehicles}} in the withdrawal. The 1st Battalion completed its withdrawal without opposition. During its night march west, the 3rd Battalion column was joined several times by groups of North Korean soldiers who apparently thought it was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> columns moving south. They were made prisoners and taken along in the withdrawal. Nearing Waegwan at dawn, the battalion column was taken under North Korean mortar and T-34 tank fire after daybreak and sustained 18 casualties.|$|E

5|$|On 14 September, the {{squadron}} began flying missions to escort B-24 Liberator bombers. The Japanese had 200 aircraft at Kahili Airfield and Balalae Island, opposed by only 50 aircraft from the U.S. squadrons in the area. The {{first couple of}} missions that {{the squadron}} undertook were relatively quiet but, on 16 September, VMF-214 was attacked {{by a group of}} 35 Japanese A6M Zeros. The squadron repelled the strike, destroying 11 Japanese aircraft for the loss of only <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>own.</b> Several costly engagements with the strong Japanese forces in the area followed. Bolt did not score any victories during this time, but was promoted to first lieutenant that month.|$|E
50|$|The Orion is also {{notable for}} the use of its own {{high-level}} business language, NEBULA. Nebula was created because of Ferranti's perception that the COBOL standard of 1960 was not sufficiently powerful for their machines, notably as COBOL was developed in the context of decimal, character-oriented batch processing, while Orion was a binary word-oriented multiprogramming system. NEBULA adapted many of COBOL's basic concepts, adding new <b>ones</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>own.</b> NEBULA was later ported to the Atlas as well.|$|R

5|$|On Oa, the Guardians tell Sinestro that Parallax was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> {{until he}} desired {{to control the}} yellow essence of fear, only to become corrupted. Arguing {{that the way to}} fight fear is with fear itself, Sinestro {{requests}} that the Guardians forge a ring of the same yellow power, preparing to concede Earth's destruction to Parallax in order to protect Oa. Jordan appears and tries to convince the Guardians that fear will turn the users evil if its power is used, but they reject his pleas, and he returns to Earth to try to defeat Parallax on his own.|$|E
5|$|Several astronomers, {{including}} Alan Hale, {{claimed the}} object was simply an 8.5-magnitude star, SAO141894, which did not appear on Shramek's computer program because the user preferences were set incorrectly. Later, Art Bell even claimed to have obtained {{an image of the}} object from an anonymous astrophysicist who was about to confirm its discovery. However, astronomers Olivier Hainaut and David J. Tholen of the University of Hawaii stated that the alleged photo was an altered copy of <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> comet images.|$|E
5|$|Some {{animals are}} capable of {{autotomy}} (self-amputation), shedding <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> appendages in a last-ditch attempt to elude a predator's grasp or to distract the predator and thereby allow escape. The lost body part may be regenerated later. Certain sea slugs discard stinging papillae; arthropods such as crabs can sacrifice a claw, which can be regrown over several successive moults; among vertebrates, many geckos and other lizards shed their tails when attacked: the tail goes on writhing for a while, distracting the predator, and giving the lizard time to escape; a smaller tail slowly regrows.|$|E
50|$|During the 1970s {{to early}} 1990s, {{the term was}} used to {{describe}} state owned and funded technical schools that offered both vocational and higher education.

Northern Illinois' next drive lasted only one play, a fumble by Jordan Lynch that was returned by Kent State defender Zack Hitchens for a touchdown. After Cortez made the extra point, the game was tied at 27. The Huskies got back on track by scoring a touchdown, a 9-yard run by Lynch, but the Golden Flashes responded with <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>own,</b> a 19-yard pass from Keith to Tim Erjavec.

50|$|Lafayette {{also sold}} {{a variety of}} {{electronic}} musical equipment made by different manufacturers. There were solid-body and hollow-body electric guitars, probably made by Teisco or Harmony.

40|$|The {{judicial}} branch, by exercising judicial review, {{can replace}} public policies with <b>ones</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> creation. To test {{the hypothesis that}} judicial policymaking is desirable only when courts possess high capacity and necessity, I propose an original model incorporating six variables: generalism, bi-polarity, minimalism, legitimization, structural impediments, and public support. Applying the model to a comparative case study of court-sanctioned affirmative action policies in higher education and K- 12 public schools, I find {{that a lack of}} structural impediments and bi-polarity limits the desirability of judicial race-based remedies in education. Courts must restrain themselves when engaging in such policymaking...|$|R
