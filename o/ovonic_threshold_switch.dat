The contrasting features associated with the amorphous and crystalline phases are exploited for use in phase change memory (PCM) devices. The phase change memories are considered as potential candidates to replace the conventional flash memories due to their low energy consumption and scalability.

A previously developed map for phase change materials is expanded and improved for OTS materials. Selected materials from different areas of the map, belonging to binary Ge-Te and Si-Te systems, are explored. Several routes, including Si doping and reduction of Te amount, are used to increase the crystallization temperature. Selector devices, with areas as small as 55 x 55 nm(2), were electrically assessed. Sub-threshold conduction models, based on Poole-Frenkel conduction mechanism, are applied to fresh samples in order to extract as-processed material parameters, such as trap height and density of defects, tailoring of which could be an important element for designing a suitable OTS material.

30|$|Resistive random-access memory (RRAM) {{is one of}} the {{promising}} candidates for the next-generation non-volatile memory technology due to its fast switching speed [1, 2], low-power consumption [3 – 8], multilevel capability [9 – 15], high scalability [16 – 20], and 3 D stacking ability [21 – 25]. These properties are especially suitable for storage class memory (SCM) which can fill the performance gap between dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) as a main memory and solid-state-drive (SSD) as a storage memory. Even though RRAM device has made much progress in the past years [1 – 25], there remains, however, a major disadvantage: sneak current through neighboring cells occurs in a high-density cross-point array [26]. The memory device with the selector component should provide nonlinear current–voltage (I–V) characteristics to overcome this problem [26 – 35]. Until now, various devices with nonlinear concepts such as complementary resistive switching (CRS) [26], tunnel barrier [27 – 33], Ag-based <b>threshold</b> <b>switching</b> [34], diode-type selector [35, 36], <b>ovonic</b> <b>threshold</b> <b>switching</b> (OTS) [37, 38], and metal-insulator-transition (MIT) [39 – 43] have been reported. VOx as one of the typical MIT materials could be widely used in potential applications as optical and electrical switching component [40 – 42]. SiO 2 is widely used as a passivation layer in the semiconductor industry. Moreover, Si-rich SiOx (x[*]<[*] 2) {{can be used as a}} resistance change layer in RRAM [44 – 55]. SiOx can be preferred over many other materials in terms of compatibility with CMOS processes and low cost. SiOx-based RRAM devices have been reported to act as a mediator of the role of conducting bridges simply by using electrodes such as Cu and Ag with high diffusivity [44 – 47]. In another case, memory switching is induced by the valence change effect inside the SiOx layer, which can be explained by generation of oxygen vacancies or proton exchange model [48 – 55]. In the unipolar switching where a set operation precedes a reset, it is sensitive to the ambient atmosphere. The switching performance in the air is significantly degraded [48 – 53]. On the other hand, filamentary switching without backward-scan effects shows typical unipolar and bipolar switching in various SiOx-based RRAM devices [52 – 54].|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{a new type}} of <b>threshold</b> <b>switching</b> devices, which is based on a purely electronic phenomena. These <b>threshold</b> <b>switches</b> are polarity independent and switch abruptly from a high resistive state to a low resistive state at a threshold voltage. The device stays in this low resistive state as long as a high voltage drops over the device. When the voltage is reduced, the low resistive state is lost and the device switches back to the initial high resistive state. This makes these <b>threshold</b> <b>switches</b> highly interesting as selector elements for resistive switching memory concepts, based on device arrays, which are the prerequisite for new applications like logic-in-memory concepts. The <b>threshold</b> <b>switching</b> considered here is based on a combination of a Poole–Frenkel conduction mechanism and Joule heating.

40|$|Chalcogenide {{glasses are}} widely used in phase-change {{nonvolatile}} memories and in optical recording media {{for their ability to}} rapidly change their structure to crystalline, thus obtaining different electrical resistance and optical reflectivity. Chalcogenide glasses universally display <b>threshold</b> <b>switching,</b> that is a sudden, reversible transition from a high-resistivity state to a low-resistivity state observed in the current-voltage I-V characteristic. Since <b>threshold</b> <b>switching</b> controls the operating voltage and speed of phase-change memories, the predictability of the switching voltage, current, and speed is of critical importance for selecting the proper chalcogenide material for memory applications. Although <b>threshold</b> <b>switching</b> has long been recognized to be an electronic process with an intimate relation to localized states, its detailed physical mechanism is still not clear. In this work, <b>threshold</b> <b>switching</b> is explained by the field-induced energy increase in electrons in their hopping transport, moderated by the energy relaxation due to phonon-electron interaction. The energy increase leads to an enhancement of conductivity and a collapse of the electric field within the amorphous chalcogenide layer, accounting for the observed negative differential resistance at <b>switching.</b> <b>Threshold</b> <b>switching</b> is found to obey to a constant electrical-power condition.

30|$|This letter {{presents}} dual functions including selector {{and memory}} switching in a V/SiOx/AlOy/p++Si {{resistive memory device}} by simply controlling compliance current limit (CCL). Unidirectional <b>threshold</b> <b>switching</b> is observed after a positive forming with low CCL of 1  μA. The shifts to the V-electrode side of the oxygen form the VOx layer, where the <b>threshold</b> <b>switching</b> {{can be explained by}} the metal-insulation-transition phenomenon. For higher CCL (30  μA) applied to the device, a bipolar memory switching is obtained, which is attributed to formation and rupture of the conducting filament in SiOy layer. 1.5 -nm-thick AlOy layer with high thermal conductivity plays an important role in lowering the off-current for memory and <b>threshold</b> <b>switching.</b> Through the temperature dependence, high-energy barrier (0.463  eV) in the LRS is confirmed, which can cause nonlinearity in a low-resistance state.

Patients in 87 of these trials entered continuation treatment for up to 1 year. Antidepressant response and the occurrence of subthreshold brief hypomania (emergence of brief hypomania [at least 1 but = 7 days] or mania) were blindly assessed by using clinician-rated daily reports of mood-associated dysfunction on the National Institute of Mental Health Life Chart Method.

Their system includes {{the use of a}} transistor in 1T1R or 1TNR architecture. Crossbar started producing samples at SMIC on the 40nm process in 2017. The Ag filament diameter has been visualized on the scale of tens of nanometers.|$|R

Phase change switching {{is based on the}} reversible change between crystalline and amorphous states of a material and in many chalcogenides this change of state takes place in nanoseconds...|$|R
