5|$|In {{the final}} decades of this era many plebeians grew poorer. The long {{military}} campaigns had forced citizens {{to leave their}} farms to fight, while their farms fell into disrepair. The landed aristocracy began buying bankrupted farms at discounted prices. As commodity prices fell, many farmers could no longer operate their farms at a profit. The result was the ultimate bankruptcy of countless farmers. Masses of unemployed plebeians soon began to flood into Rome, and thus {{into the ranks of}} the legislative assemblies. Their poverty usually led them to vote for the candidate who offered them the most. A new culture <b>of</b> <b>dependency</b> was emerging, in which citizens would look to any populist leader for relief.|$|E
5|$|The second epoch saw the reigns of {{the last}} three legendary kings. The second epoch was more {{consequential}} than was the first, which was in part due to the significant degree of territorial expansion which occurred during this period. Regardless of how true these legends were, it is likely that, as the legends suggest, a series of conquests did occur during the late monarchy. As a result of these conquests, it became necessary to determine what was to be done with the conquered people. Often, individuals whose towns had been conquered remained in those towns, while other such individuals came to Rome. To acquire legal and economic standing, these newcomers adopted a condition <b>of</b> <b>dependency</b> toward either a Patrician family, or toward the king. Eventually, the individuals who were dependents of the king were released from their state <b>of</b> <b>dependency,</b> and became the first Plebeians. As Rome grew, it needed more soldiers to continue its conquests. When the Plebeians were released from their dependency, they were released from their Curia. When this occurred, while they were no longer required to serve in the army, they also lost their political and economic standing. To bring these new Plebeians back into the army, the Patricians were forced to make concessions. While it is not known exactly what concessions were made, {{the fact that they were}} not granted any political power set the stage for what history knows as the Conflict of the Orders.|$|E
5|$|The {{stability}} of the IPK is crucial because the kilogram underpins much of the SI system of measurement as it is currently defined and structured. For instance, the newton {{is defined as the}} force necessary to accelerate one kilogram at one metre per second squared. If the mass of the IPK were to change slightly, so too must the newton by a proportional degree. In turn, the pascal, the SI unit of pressure, is defined in terms of the newton. This chain <b>of</b> <b>dependency</b> follows to many other SI units of measure. For instance, the joule, the SI unit of energy, is defined as that expended when a force of one newton acts through one metre. Next to be affected is the SI unit of power, the watt, which is one joule per second. The ampere too is defined relative to the newton, and ultimately, the kilogram.|$|E

5|$|Abu Nuwar {{became a}} vociferous critic of British aid to Jordan, viewing it {{as a form}} <b>of</b> <b>dependency</b> on Jordan's former colonial ruler, and of Glubb Pasha, the {{influential}} British officer {{in charge of the}} Arab Legion who was derided by Arab nationalists as a symbol of lingering British colonialism in Jordan. When Abdullah I was assassinated in 1951, Glubb and Prime Minister Tawfik Abu al-Huda's government discussed preventing Abdullah's son and heir apparent, Emir Talal, a sympathizer of the Free Officers, from being enthroned; Talal had been checked into a mental institution in Switzerland, but many Free Officers believed the British were fabricating Talal's mental illness to keep him out of Jordan. In response, Abu Nuwar sought to install Talal on the throne by force, and to that end he appealed for support from the Free Officers and sent Awni Hannun, a Jordanian military doctor, to bring Talal to Jordan. However, Hannun was forbidden from meeting Talal due to visitation restrictions and was dismissed by Glubb for alleged incitement against British interests. Nonetheless, Talal was enthroned, and Abu Nuwar subsequently urged him to dismiss Glubb. The latter feared Abu Nuwar's efforts posed a threat to British interests in Jordan, and thus directed Abu al-Huda's government to effectively exile Abu Nuwar from the country. The government complied, dispatching Abu Nuwar to Paris to serve as Jordan's military attaché in September 1952. Talal was later dethroned by parliamentary decision {{on the basis of his}} mental incapacity.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} this era, Rome {{had become}} full of {{unemployed}} Plebeians. They then began filling the ranks of the assemblies, {{and the fact that they}} were no longer away from Rome made it easier for them to vote. In the principle legislative assembly, the Plebeian Council, any individual voted in the Tribe that his ancestors had belonged to. Thus, most of these newly unemployed Plebeians belonged to one of the thirty-one rural Tribes, rather than one of the four urban Tribes, and the unemployed Plebeians soon acquired so much political power that the Plebeian Council became highly populist. These Plebeians were often angry with the aristocracy, which further exacerbated the class tensions. Their economic state usually led them to vote for the candidate who offered the most for them, or at least for the candidate whose games or whose bribes were the most magnificent. The fact that they were usually uninformed as to the issues before them didn't matter, because they usually sold their votes to the highest bidder anyway. Bribery became such a problem that major reforms were ultimately passed, in particular the requirement that all votes be by secret ballot. A new culture <b>of</b> <b>dependency</b> was emerging, which would look to any populist leader for relief.|$|E

40|$|Feature {{dependencies}} {{have very}} strong implications on the configurations in a software product line.

Therapy involves first exploring the stressors that lead to panic episodes, then probing the psychodynamics of the conflicts underlying panic disorder and the defense mechanisms {{that contribute to the}} attacks, with attention to transference and separation anxiety issues implicated in the therapist-patient relationship.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} attribute dependencies in {{data that}} involve grades, {{such as a}} grade to which an object is red or a grade to which two objects are similar. We thus extend the classical agenda by allowing graded, or fuzzy, attributes instead of Boolean attributes in case of attribute implications, and allowing approximate match based on degrees of similarity instead of exact match in case <b>of</b> functional <b>dependencies.</b> In a sense, we move from bivalence, inherently present in the now-available theories <b>of</b> <b>dependencies,</b> to a more flexible setting that involves grades. Such a shift has far-reaching consequences. We argue that a reasonable theory <b>of</b> <b>dependencies</b> may be developed by making use of mathematical fuzzy logic. Namely, the theory <b>of</b> <b>dependencies</b> is then based on a solid logic calculus {{the same way the}} classical dependencies are based on classical logic. For instance, rather than handling degrees of similarity in an ad hoc manner, we consistently treat them as truth values, the same way as true (match) and false (mismatch) are treated in classical theories. In addition, several notions intuitively embraced in the presence of grades, such as a degree of validity of a particular dependence or a degree of entailment, naturally emerge and receive a conceptually clean treatment in the presented approach. In the paper, we discuss motivations, provide basic notions of syntax and semantics, and develop basic results which include entailment <b>of</b> <b>dependencies,</b> associated closure structures, a logic <b>of</b> <b>dependencies</b> with two versions of completeness theorem, results and algorithms regarding complete non-redundant sets <b>of</b> <b>dependencies,</b> relationship to and a possible reductionist interface to classical dependencies, and relationship to functional dependencies over domains with similarity...|$|R

In order to make functional recovery gains, right hemisphere stroke survivors should receive rehabilitation services, so patients with anosognosia should be encouraged to seek out additional treatment.

Patients with smaller lesions often recover faster from anosognosia than patients with larger lesions resulting in anosognosia (Hier et al., 1983).|$|E

25|$|In 1969, Gerwitz {{discussed}} how {{mother and child}} could provide each other with positive reinforcement experiences through their mutual attention and therefore learn to stay close together; this explanation would make it unnecessary to posit innate human characteristics fostering attachment. Learning theory saw attachment as a remnant <b>of</b> <b>dependency</b> {{and the quality of}} attachment as merely a response to the caregivers cues. Behaviourists saw behaviours such as crying as a random activity that meant nothing until reinforced by a caregivers response therefore frequent responses would result in more crying. To attachment theorists, crying is an inborn attachment behaviour to which the caregiver must respond if the infant is to develop emotional security. Conscientious responses produce security which enhances autonomy and results in less crying. Ainsworth's research in Baltimore supported the attachment theorists view. In the last decade, behaviour analysts have constructed models of attachment based on the importance of contingent relationships. These behaviour analytic models have received some support from research and meta-analytic reviews.|$|E
25|$|The {{distinction}} between dependency- and constituency-based grammars derives {{in large part}} from the initial division of the clause. The constituency relation derives from an initial binary division, whereby the clause is split into a subject noun phrase (NP) and a predicate verb phrase (VP). This division is certainly present in the basic analysis of the clause that we find in the works of, for instance, Leonard Bloomfield and Noam Chomsky. Tesnière, however, argued vehemently against this binary division, preferring instead to position the verb as {{the root of all}} clause structure. Tesnière's stance was that the subject-predicate division stems from term logic and has no place in linguistics. The importance of this distinction is that if one acknowledges the initial subject-predicate division in syntax as something real, then one is likely to go down the path of constituency grammar, whereas if one rejects this division, then the only alternative is to position the verb as the root of all structure, which means one has chosen the path <b>of</b> <b>dependency</b> grammar.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1800s Viveiros de Castro noted an {{increase}} in violations of female honor within Brazil {{at the turn of}} the century. Women were expanding their roles throughout society which many believed opened doors for women to be taken advantage of and seduced. Viveiros de Castro believed that women's working in factories was a threat to society and morality. Men believed that the new change in opinion amongst women contributed to this new susceptibility. Many men believed that women believed they were freer than they actually were, and because of this the actions of women led them to lose honor because of their lack <b>of</b> <b>dependency</b> on the male gender. The new century had changed the image of how women were historically perceived and portrayed. Certain individuals, a judge by the name of Nelson Hungria (quoted in Sueann Caulfield's book) specifically, labeled a woman's reserved role as the source of her honor which was lost once she branched out into society losing this reserved quality attributed to women. Because women chose to leave the traditional role of being the homemaker they lost the characterization of being innocent and some assumed they were engaging sexual activities.|$|E
