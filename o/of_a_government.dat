5|$|Governments {{do not use}} {{the terms}} profit and loss to {{describe}} the net results of their operations. The difference between revenues and expenditures during a year is either a surplus or a deficit. Since making a profit is not the purpose <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>government,</b> a significant surplus generally means a choice between tax cuts or spending increases. A significant deficit will result in spending cuts or borrowing. Ideally, surpluses and deficits should be small.|$|E

40|$|Have {{government}} debt levels reached dangerous levels? Certainly, for some countries, the data would suggest so. However, {{this paper will}} argue that for many governments, the amount of explicit debt on their balance sheets seriously understates the magnitude of their future fiscal obligations. This clearly emerges from the assessment of many analysts {{on the size of}} the prospective fiscal obligations associated with aging populations. But this point is further reinforced if one examines the range of other fiscal risk exposures <b>of</b> <b>governments.</b> Thus, <b>an</b> examination <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>government’s</b> explicit debt should only be the starting point for assessing the sustainability <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>government’s</b> fiscal position. ...|$|R

5|$|A further {{delay in}} {{construction}} {{was announced in}} 1951, when labour and materials were restricted because <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>government</b> rearmament drive. Work to complete the quadrangle, including a hall, kitchen and the library tower, began in 1955 {{at a cost of}} £200,000. This money was donated to the college by the Nuffield Foundation upon Lord Nuffield's recommendation. Until it was required for books, the fellows of the college used the upper floor as a Senior Common Room. The tower was completed in 1956, and the college as a whole (without the institute on the site opposite, which is now used as a car park) was finished in 1960. Work was still under way when the college was incorporated by royal charter in 1958, thereby becoming a self-governing entity. The charter was presented to the college by the Duke of Edinburgh on 6June 1958, at the first lunch to be served in the hall.|$|E

In the aftermath, questions are raised over M's ability to run the Secret Service, and she becomes the subject <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>government</b> review over her handling of the situation. The Service itself is attacked, prompting Bond's return to London. His presence assists MI6's investigation in uncovering a lead, and Bond is sent to Shanghai and Macau {{in pursuit of a}} mercenary named Patrice. There, he establishes a connection to Raoul Silva, a former MI6 agent who was captured and tortured by Chinese agents. Blaming M for his imprisonment, he sets in motion a plan to ruin her reputation before murdering her. Bond saves M and attempts to lure Silva into a trap, and while he is successful in repelling Silva's assault, M is mortally wounded. Bond returns to active duty under the command of the new M, Gareth Mallory.|$|E

5|$|Belgium gained its {{independence}} from the United Netherlands in 1830 and was established as a popular and constitutional monarchy under a bicameral parliamentary democracy. A liberal Constitution was written in 1831 which codified the responsibilities and restrictions imposed on the monarch.

Which responsibility would take precedence if they became incompatible was left ambiguous and this uncertainty would {{lie at the heart of}} the Royal Question. The first king, Leopold I, accepted the terms of the Constitution but attempted to use its ambiguities to subtly increase his own powers. This was continued by his successors, although with little real success.|$|E
