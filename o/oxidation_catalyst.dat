25|$|Scientists are {{now turning}} to {{nanotechnology}} {{in an attempt}} to develop diesel engines with cleaner exhaust fumes. Platinum is currently used as the diesel engine catalyst in these engines. The catalyst is what cleans the exhaust fume particles. First a reduction catalyst is employed to take nitrogen atoms from NOx molecules in order to free oxygen. Next the <b>oxidation</b> <b>catalyst</b> oxidizes the hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide to form carbon dioxide and water. Platinum is used in both the reduction and the oxidation catalysts. Using platinum though, is inefficient in that it is expensive and unsustainable. Danish company InnovationsFonden invested DKK 15 million in a search for new catalyst substitutes using nanotechnology. The goal of the project, launched in the autumn of 2014, is to maximize surface area and minimize the amount of material required. Objects tend to minimize their surface energy; two drops of water, for example, will join to form one drop and decrease surface area. If the catalyst's surface area that is exposed to the exhaust fumes is maximized, efficiency of the catalyst is maximized. The team working on this project aims to create nanoparticles that will not merge. Every time the surface is optimized, material is saved. Thus, creating these nanoparticles will increase the effectiveness of the resulting diesel engine catalyst—in turn leading to cleaner exhaust fumes—and will decrease cost. If successful, the team hopes to reduce platinum use by 25%.|$|E

40|$|The primary {{applications}} for ambient temperature carbon monoxide (CO) <b>oxidation</b> <b>catalysts</b> include emergency breathing masks and confined volume life support systems, {{such as those}} employed on the Shuttle. While Hopcalite is typically used in emergency breathing masks for terrestrial applications, in the 1970 s, NASA selected a 2 % platinum (Pt) on carbon for use on the Shuttle since it is more active and also more tolerant to water vapor. In the last 10 - 15 years there have been significant advances in ambient temperature CO <b>oxidation</b> <b>catalysts.</b> Langley Research Center developed a monolithic catalyst for ambient temperature CO oxidation operating under stoichiometric conditions for closed loop carbon dioxide (CO 2) laser applications which is also advertised as having the potential to oxidize formaldehyde (HCHO) at ambient temperatures. In the last decade it has been discovered that appropriate sized nano-particles of gold are highly active for CO oxidation, even at sub-ambient temperatures, {{and as a result}} there has been a wealth of data reported in the literature relating to ambient/low temperature CO oxidation. In the shorter term missions where CO concentrations are typically controlled via ambient temperature <b>oxidation</b> <b>catalysts,</b> formaldehyde is also a contaminant of concern, and requires specially treated carbons such as Calgon Formasorb as untreated activated carbon has effectively no HCHO capacity.

These emissions concern exhaust-gas particulate emissions, as well as particulate emissions caused by tyre wear, wear of brake linings and wear of road surface. Another particulate emission source is dust caused by moving traffic. In addition to emission factors also size distribution and chemical composition of road traffic related particulates were investigated. Besides the effect of technical measures like <b>oxidation</b> <b>catalysts</b> and particulate traps were also discussed.
