By 1875 the line was carrying around 40,000gallons (180,000l; 48,000USgal) of milk each year. Delivery of linseed cake to the dairy farms and of coal to the area's buildings were also important uses of the line. The line also began to carry large quantities <b>of</b> <b>manure</b> from London to the area's farms, carrying 3,200tons (3,300t) in 1872. As {{it was the only}} physical link between the Tramway and the national railway network, almost all of this traffic passed through Quainton Road station.|$|E
5|$|By 1901 Adelaide's horse trams {{were seen}} by the public as a blot on the city's image. With a {{population}} of 162,000 the slow speed of the trams, and the lines subsequent low traffic capacity, made them inadequate for public transport needs. The unsealed roads the horses required became quagmires in winter and sources of dust in summer. The 10pounds <b>of</b> <b>manure</b> each horse left behind daily, was also not well regarded. Under these various pressures the government negotiated to purchase the horse tramway companies. A 28 March 1906 newspaper notice announced {{that the government had}} purchased all of the city tramways for £280,000. Bill No.913, passed 22 December 1906, created the Municipal Tramways Trust (MTT) with the authority to build new and purchase existing tramways.|$|E
40|$|Manures are an {{inevitable}} consequence of livestock in agriculture. They represent a valuable source of nutrients, including nitrogen (N), phosphorus and potassium. The industrial production of fertilisers containing these elements {{is associated with}} finite resources and this alone justifies a proper recycling <b>of</b> <b>manures.</b> The N fertiliser replacement value (NFRV) <b>of</b> <b>manures</b> is still insufficiently appreciated and exploited. Mineral fertiliser N supplementation is thus unnecessarily large, to the potential detriment of the environment. The present paper reviews methods to correctly assess the NFRV <b>of</b> <b>manures</b> and presents measures to increase the NFRV. When proper attention {{is given to the}} composition <b>of</b> <b>manures</b> and decisions on rates, timing and application methods are made accordingly, the relative NFRV <b>of</b> <b>manures</b> could rise from the present 20 - 50 percent to 80 percent. This could lead to a further reduction of mineral N fertiliser use, N surpluses and pollution. Under these conditions, 'manure', 'precision farming' and 'environment' should no longer be a contradiction in term...|$|R

In Philadelphia, as the rich moved west of 7th Street, the poor moved into the upper class' former homes, which were converted into tenements and boarding houses. Many small row houses crowded alleyways and small streets, and these areas were filthy, filled with garbage and the smell <b>of</b> <b>manure</b> from animal pens. During the 1840s and 1850s, hundreds died each year in Philadelphia and the surrounding districts from diseases such as malaria, smallpox, tuberculosis, and cholera, related to poor sanitation and diseases brought by immigrants; the poor suffered the most fatalities. Small rowhouses and tenement housing were constructed south of South Street.|$|E

Nutrient inputs can be chemical inorganic fertilizers, manure, green manure, compost and mined minerals.

Manure is used either by holding livestock where the feed crop is growing, such as in managed intensive rotational grazing, or by spreading either dry or liquid formulations <b>of</b> <b>manure</b> on cropland or pastures.|$|E

25|$|The {{advantages}} <b>of</b> <b>manure</b> {{treatment are}} {{a reduction in}} the amount <b>of</b> <b>manure</b> that needs to be transported and applied to crops, as well as reduced soil compaction. Nutrients are reduced as well, meaning that less cropland is needed for manure to be spread upon. Manure treatment can also reduce the risk of human health and biosecurity risks by reducing the amount of pathogens present in manure. Undiluted animal manure or slurry is one hundred times more concentrated than domestic sewage, and can carry an intestinal parasite, Cryptosporidium, which is difficult to detect but can be passed to humans. Silage liquor (from fermented wet grass) is even stronger than slurry, with a low pH and very high biological oxygen demand. With a low pH, silage liquor can be highly corrosive; it can attack synthetic materials, causing damage to storage equipment, and leading to accidental spillage. All of these advantages can be optimized by using the right manure management system on the right farm based on the resources that are available.|$|E

40|$|In modern {{sustainable}} agriculture, {{green manuring}} is increasingly emphasized for a reasonable land use management. However, the expansion <b>of</b> green <b>manure</b> {{is affected by}} a range of factors, such as soil geophysical properties and human intervention. This paper proposes an approach of spatial modelling to understand the mechanisms that influence green manure expansion and map the future distribution <b>of</b> green <b>manure</b> intercropped in the orchards in the Pinggu District, Beijing, China. We firstly classified the orchards into five grades according to a land productivity evaluation, and then considered two strategies for implementing green manure. Two scenarios were designed to represent the strategies: prioritizing low-productivity orchards to promote green manure intercropping (scenario 1) and prioritizing high-productivity orchards to promote green manure intercropping (scenario 2). The spatial expansion <b>of</b> green <b>manure</b> for 2020 was simulated at a resolution of a 100 × 100 m grid in the CLUE-S (the Conversion of Land Use and its Effects at the Small Region Extent) model. The two strategies led to quite different spatial patterns <b>of</b> green <b>manure,</b> although they were applied to the same areas. As a result, the spatial pattern <b>of</b> green <b>manuring</b> <b>of</b> scenario 1 was more concentrated than that of scenario 2. To summarize, the modelled outcomes identified the driving factors that affect green manure expansion at a grid scale, whereas the implementing strategies directly determined the spatial arrangements <b>of</b> green <b>manuring</b> at a regional scale. Therefore, we argue that {{the assessment of the}} driving factors and the prediction of the future distribution <b>of</b> green <b>manuring</b> are crucial for informing an extensive use <b>of</b> green <b>manure...</b>|$|R

25|$|In a {{concentrated}} animal feeding operation (CAFO), {{it is considered}} normal for {{a large number of}} animals to continuously occupy a very small area. The aisles that animals use to move around are consequently constantly coated with a moist layer <b>of</b> <b>manure</b> and urine from the many animals, leading to ailments such as foot rot due to the constant wet exposure. The manure and urine is usually just scraped off into gutters below slatted surfaces, and the surfaces and gutters are rarely washed completely clean, so molds, bacteria, and insects can grow and thrive in the potentially infectious waste. Feeding areas in a CAFO are also rarely stripped bare and washed with a disinfectant, as this would reduce the time available for animals to eat continuously, so molds and bacteria are also able to become established where the animals eat. The close confinement and lack of general environmental cleanliness leads to easier spread of infection and increased sickness, requiring the regular feeding of antibiotics to keep the confined animals healthy but which also leads to antibiotic resistance for bacteria constantly present in the CAFO.|$|E
