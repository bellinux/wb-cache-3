5|$|At an {{editorial}} meeting of Jyllands-Posten ("The Jutland Post", Denmark's largest daily newspaper) on 19 September, reporter Stig <b>Olesen</b> mooted {{the idea of}} asking {{the members of the}} newspaper illustrators union if {{they would be willing to}} draw Muhammad. This would be an experiment to see the degree to which professional illustrators felt threatened. Flemming Rose, culture editor, was interested in the idea and wrote to the 42 members of the union asking them to draw their interpretations of Muhammad.|$|E

25|$|In the 2015 general {{election}} held on 18 June 2015, the party won 7.5% of the vote, and 13 {{seats in the}} Folketing. In its most successful constituency, Gentofte Municipality, a well-off suburb of Copenhague, it even scored 17.5 %, while on Bornholm its share of votes was only 4 %. Initially, the party {{did not participate in}} Lars Løkke Rasmussen's Venstre minority cabinet but lent its parliamentary support to the government. In late-November 2016 however, it joined a three-party centre-right coalition government alongside Venstre and the Conservative People's Party, Løkke Rasmussen's third cabinet. Party leader Anders Samuelsen was appointed foreign minister, while Simon Emil Ammitzbøll took the post of minister for the economy and interior. Additional cabinet members of Liberal Alliance are Merete Riisager (education), Mette Bock (culture), Ole Birk <b>Olesen</b> (transport) and Thyra Frank (elder affairs).|$|E
500|$|The society's newsletter, Friendship and Freedom, was {{the first}} gay-interest {{publication}} in the United States. However, few Society members were willing to receive mailings of the newsletter, fearing that postal inspectors would deem the publication obscene under the [...] Comstock Act. Indeed, all gay-interest publications were deemed obscene until 1958, when the Supreme Court ruled in One, Inc. v. <b>Olesen</b> that publishing homosexual content did not mean the content was automatically obscene. Two issues of Friendship and Freedom were written and produced, entirely by Gerber. No copies of the newsletter are known to exist.|$|E

They also recorded their Creation 2005 set for a live DVD to be released with their upcoming album.

2500|$|The Savvidy vacuum is a {{model of}} the QCD vacuum which at a basic level is a {{statement}} that it cannot be the conventional Fock vacuum empty of particles and fields. In 1977, George Savvidy showed that the QCD vacuum with zero field strength is unstable, and decays into a state with a calculable non vanishing value of the field. Since condensates are scalar, it seems like a good first approximation that the vacuum contains some non-zero but homogeneous field which gives rise to these condensates. However, Stanley Mandelstam showed that a homogeneous vacuum field is also unstable. [...] The instability of a homogeneous gluon field was argued by Niels Kjær Nielsen and Poul <b>Olesen</b> in their 1978 paper. These arguments suggest that the scalar condensates are an effective long-distance description of the vacuum, and at short distances, below the QCD scale, the vacuum may have structure.|$|E
2500|$|When {{initially}} discovered, Dendrogrammas {{relationships were}} unclear. The two purported species were assigned their own genus, Dendrogramma, and family, Dendrogrammatidae; and the researchers even considered {{putting them in}} their own phylum. As they put it, however, [...] "we refrain from erecting such a high-level taxon for the time being, because new material is needed to resolve many pertinent outstanding questions." [...] The lead scientist of the identification effort, Jørgen <b>Olesen</b> of the University of Copenhagen, suggested that they represent [...] "an early branch on the tree of life, with similarities to the 600 million-year-old extinct Ediacara fauna." [...] At least three genera of Ediacarans—Albumares, Anfesta, and Rugoconites—share similarities with Dendrogramma; all three appear to have possessed a disc with an internal network of forking channels. This possibility generated considerable excitement: Simon Conway Morris of the University of Cambridge stated that the discovery is [...] "a very interesting surprise, and it poses {{lots and lots of}} questions." [...] He noted the [...] "most intriguing similarity to certain Ediacaran forms," [...] but cautioned that [...] "the similarities are exactly that. They are intriguing rather than compelling." [...] Genetic identification was not possible with the original specimens, as they were preserved with formaldehyde and alcohol, a method that does not preserve nucleic acids.|$|E
