25|$|Vegetables {{that were}} {{commonly}} eaten included squash, leeks, garlic and onions, black radishes, net or muskmelons (sometimes misidentified as the cucumber) and watermelons. Other vegetables played a minor {{role in the}} diet of the ancient Israelites. Field greens and root plants were generally not cultivated and were gathered seasonally when they grew in the wild. Leafy plants included dandelion greens and the young leaves of the <b>orach</b> plant.|$|E
25|$|The four {{strands of}} the tzitzit are passed through holes near {{the four corners}} of the garment (Shulchan Aruch <b>Orach</b> Chaim 11:9-11:15) that are {{farthest}} apart (10:1). Four tzitzyot are passed through each hole (11:12-13), and the two groups of four ends are double-knotted to each other {{at the edge of the}} garment near the hole (11:14,15). One of the four tzitzit is made longer than the others (11:4); the long end of that one is wound around the other seven ends and double-knotted; this is done repeatedly so as to make a total of five double knots separated by four sections of winding, with a total length of at least four inches, leaving free-hanging ends that are twice that long (11:14).|$|E
25|$|Maimonides (12th century), in his Mishneh Torah, {{says that}} the {{restrictions}} as to the eating of meat and the drinking of wine refer only to the last meal before fasting on the Eighth Day of Av, if taken after noon, but before noon anything may be eaten (Hilchoth Ta'anith 5:8). Rabbi Moses of Coucy (13th century) wrote {{that it is the}} universal custom to refrain from meat and wine during the whole day preceding the Ninth of Av (Sefer Mitzvoth ha-Gadol, Venice ed, Laws of Tishah B'Av, 249b). Rabbi Joseph Caro (16th century) says some are accustomed to abstain from meat and wine {{from the beginning of the}} week in which the Ninth Day of Av falls; and still others abstain throughout the three weeks from the Seventeenth of Tammuz (Shulkhan Arukh, <b>Orach</b> Chayim 551).|$|E
25|$|The Aruch HaShulchan {{is often}} quoted {{alongside}} the Mishnah Berurah, a work partially composed earlier by Rabbi Yisrael Meir Kagan (the Chafetz Chaim). The Aruch Hashulchan was composed and printed serially starting with Choshen Mishpat (prior to the printing of the Mishna Berurah) and {{the section on}} <b>Orach</b> Chayim published afterwards. Indeed, the Aruch HaShulchan refers {{in a number of}} places to the Mishnah Berurah. Due to the latter's popularity in the Haredi world, the Mishnah Berurah is often considered authoritative over Aruch HaShulchan by Haredim. However, many people (including Rabbi Yosef Eliyahu Henkin and Rabbi Yehuda Pearl) have famously held that the Aruch HaShulchan is more authoritative, since its author was the rabbi of a community, and since it was printed after the Mishnah Berurah. Also, Aruch HaShulchan has a much wider scope than the Mishnah Berurah.|$|E
25|$|In 1935 Frumer {{spent four}} months visiting Palestine. In 1938 he {{published}} his second work, ארץ צבי (Eretz Tzvi) (the title being {{another name for}} the Land of Israel and a play on his own name), a book of responsa concerning practical laws in the Shulchan Aruch, section <b>Orach</b> Chaim. This work included his responses to queries from such Torah luminaries as the Gerrer Rebbe. It has been noted for its unique approach to halacha, using non-halakhic and kabbalistic sources to solve halachic problems, and is still widely quoted to this day. Frumer also produced an anonymous pamphlet titled עיקרי דיני תפילה (Main Laws of Prayer), which was widely read in prewar Poland. At the second Siyum HaShas in Yeshivas Chachmei Lublin in June 1938, Frumer initiated the Mishnah Yomit worldwide daily study program, as a complement to the Daf Yomi daily Talmud study program.|$|E
25|$|A {{far more}} {{comprehensive}} approbation {{was given by}} Rabbi Aaron Chorin of Arad. Chorin was a well-known maverick; Samet noted that unlike many colleagues who harbored maskilic sympathies, he did not keep his to himself. Since a rabbinic tribunal had him recant in 1806, under the pain of being declared a heretic and have his beard shaved, he clashed repeatedly with other decisors, adopting glaringly lenient positions. His only patron was Rabbi Moses Münz of Óbuda. When hearing of Liebermann's lettres, Münz warned Chorin to steer clear from the controversy, yet the latter ignored him. The rabbi of Arad composed a long, enthusiastic responsa, in which he fervently supported reform efforts, stating that he long regarded the noise and disorder in synagogues a great ill. While recommending they teach their sons the Holy Tongue, he noted that legal sources were quite clear on the permissibility of vernacular liturgy. He also allowed Sephardi pronunciation and separate prayer gatherings. Regarding the organ, he cited the same arguments that Samun and Recanati evoked. He also turned to two minority opinions mentioned in <b>Orach</b> Chayim 338:2 and 339:3, that sanctioned music on the Sabbath.|$|E
500|$|A Sanskrit {{name for}} Betelgeuse is ārdrā [...] "the moist one", eponymous of the Ardra lunar mansion in Hindu astrology. The Rigvedic God of storms Rudra {{presided over the}} star; this {{association}} was linked by 19th-century star enthusiast [...] to Orion's stormy nature. The constellations in Macedonian folklore represented agricultural items and animals, reflecting their village way of life. To them, Betelgeuse was <b>Orach</b> [...] "the ploughman", alongside the rest of Orion which depicted a plough with oxen. The rising of Betelgeuse at around 3am in late summer and autumn signified the time for village men {{to go to the}} fields and plough. To the Inuit, the appearance of Betelgeuse and Bellatrix high in the southern sky after sunset marked the beginning of spring and lengthening days in late February and early March. The two stars were known as Akuttujuuk [...] "those (two) placed far apart", referring to the distance between them, mainly to people from North Baffin Island and Melville Peninsula.|$|E
