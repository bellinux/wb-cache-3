5|$|While {{the events}} at <b>observation</b> <b>post</b> 4 were unfolding, the Iraqi 5th Mechanized Division crossed the Saudi border near <b>observation</b> <b>post</b> 1. A Company of the 2nd Light Infantry Armored Battalion, which was {{screening}} the Iraqi unit, reported {{a column of}} 60–100 BMPs. The column was engaged by Coalition A-10s and Harrier jump jets. This was then followed by another column with an estimated 29 tanks. One of the column's T-62 tanks was engaged by an anti-tank missile and destroyed. Coalition air support, provided by A-10s and F-16s, engaged the Iraqi drive through <b>observation</b> <b>post</b> 1 and ultimately repulsed the attack back over the Kuwaiti border. Aircraft continued to engage the columns throughout the night, until the next morning. Another column of Iraqi tanks, approaching <b>observation</b> <b>post</b> 2, were engaged by aircraft and also repulsed that night.|$|E

5|$|The Iraqi {{offensive}} {{began on}} the night of 29 January, when approximately 2,000 soldiers in several hundred armored fighting vehicles moved south. The Gulf War's first ground engagement was near <b>observation</b> <b>post</b> 4, built on the Al-Zabr police building. Elements of the Iraqi 6th Armored Brigade, ordered to take the heights above Al-Zabr, engaged Coalition units at Al-Zabr. At 20:00 hours, U.S. Marines at the <b>observation</b> <b>post,</b> who had noticed large groups of armored vehicles through their night vision devices, attempted to talk to battalion headquarters but received no response. Contact was not established until 20:30 hours, which prompted Task Force Shepard to respond to the threat. Coalition soldiers at <b>observation</b> <b>post</b> 4 opened fire on the Iraqi column, but this largely ineffective fire drew a heavy Iraqi response which forced the company to retire south, by order of its commanding officer.|$|E
50|$|These 'garden shed' style <b>observation</b> <b>posts</b> were {{eventually}} replaced by more substantial brick-built structures, protected by sandbags, which {{due to their}} often having been constructed by Observer Corps personnel themselves meant that no two <b>posts</b> were identical. <b>Observation</b> <b>posts</b> were located in open playing fields, hilltops or cliff edges and, particularly in urban areas, on the rooftops of public buildings and factories. Purpose-built <b>observation</b> <b>posts</b> introduced later were usually two-storey structures, constructed of brick or concrete with an open-topped observation platform above a small crew rest area. (These 1940s-era posts are sometimes incorrectly referred to as 'Orlit' posts; a term correctly associated with 1950s-era, pre-cast concrete aircraft <b>observation</b> <b>posts,</b> manufactured by Orlit Ltd).|$|R

5|$|It re-opened {{during the}} Second World War as an Emergency Landing Ground, RAF Penshurst. As well as serving in this role, it was mainly used by Air <b>Observation</b> <b>Post</b> (AOP) squadrons of the Royal Air Force. The {{airfield}} finally closed in May 1946.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the Arab contingent was led by General Khaled bin Sultan. The forces around Khafji were organized into the Joint Forces Command-East, while Joint Forces Command-North defended the border between <b>observation</b> <b>post</b> 1 and the Kuwaiti-Iraqi border.|$|E

5|$|In August 1941 an {{artillery}} unit {{was formed to}} attack Italian forts more effectively. Initially it used a QF 4.5-inch howitzer carried on a 10-ton Mack NR 4 truck, with an accompanying light tank as an armoured <b>observation</b> <b>post.</b> However, these were {{handed over to the}} Free French at Kufra. The unit was then issued a 25 pounder portee. The LRDG successfully attacked and captured the fort at El Gtafia using the gun, but later the truck had to be abandoned and the experiment ended.|$|E
5|$|New Jersey {{provided}} artillery {{support for}} a major air and surface strike on Wonsan 1 May, as 7th Fleet planes both attacked the enemy and spotted for the battleship. She knocked out eleven Communist shore guns that day, and four days later destroyed the key <b>observation</b> <b>post</b> {{on the island of}} Hodo Pando, commanding the harbor. Two days later Kalmagak at Wonsan was her target.|$|E
5|$|Stanley Warren {{was born}} in England in 1917. He was talented in art from young and was a {{religious}} man. Stanley was employed as a commercial designer producing poster ads with the Grenada organisation before the war. In January 1940, he enlisted in the army to join the fight against Nazi Germany and was posted to the Royal Regiment of Artillery as an <b>Observation</b> <b>Post</b> Assistant. His responsibilities included having to make quick drawings of panoramas used to plot targets for the guns.|$|E

They destroyed {{much of the}} U.S. heavy munitions, broke through American lines, and entered the main base before being repelled by artillery and aircraft. The United States claimed to have killed at least 21 Taliban fighters {{for the loss of}} nine U.S. soldiers killed and 27 wounded, and four Afghan National Army (ANA) soldiers wounded.|$|E
5|$|The {{roof of the}} fort, {{accessed}} via {{steps up}} from the open battery, was altered substantially {{during the first half}} of the 20th century to accommodate new guns and other structures. These include emplacements for 5.5-inch and 6-inch guns as well as 12-pdrs, searchlight positions, shelters, an <b>observation</b> <b>post,</b> a fire control building, a machine-gun parapet on the north caponier and a Royal Navy monitoring station.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his work, Johnston himself {{has become part of}} the history of volcanic eruptions. With Harry Glicken, he is one of two volcanologists from the United States to die in a volcanic eruption. Glicken was being mentored by Johnston, who relieved Glicken of his watch at the ColdwaterII <b>observation</b> <b>post</b> 13 hours before Mount St. Helens erupted. Glicken died in 1991, eleven years later, when a pyroclastic flow overran him and several others at Mount Unzen in Japan. Despite the deaths of other volcanologists in later eruptions at Mount Unzen and Galeras, prediction methods similar to Johnston's allowed scientists to convince residents of settlements near the Mount Pinatubo volcano to evacuate, preventing thousands of deaths.|$|E

5|$|Many USGS {{scientists}} {{worked on}} the team monitoring the volcano, but it was graduate student Harry Glicken who had been manning the ColdwaterII <b>observation</b> <b>post</b> for the {{two and a half}} weeks immediately preceding the eruption. The evening before the eruption he was scheduled to be relieved by USGS geologist Don Swanson in order to visit the graduate school at the University of California. Swanson, however, wanted to meet with a German graduate student who was returning to Germany on May 18. Two days before the eruption, Swanson ran into Johnston in the hallway and asked him to take his place. Johnston hesitantly agreed to man the base for one day. That Saturday, the day before the eruption took place, Johnston ascended the mountain and went on a patrol of the volcano with geologist Carolyn Driedger. Tremors shook the mountain. Driedger was supposed to camp on one of the ridges overlooking the volcano that night, but Johnston told her to head home and said that he would stay on the volcano alone. While at ColdwaterII, Johnston was to observe the volcano for any further signs of an eruption. Just prior to his departure, at 7p.m. on the evening of May 17, 13½ hours before the eruption, Glicken took the famous photograph of Johnston sitting by the <b>observation</b> <b>post</b> trailer with a notebook on his lap, smiling.|$|E
5|$|New Jersey {{returned}} to the key task of direct support to troops at Kosong 7 June. On her first mission, she completely destroyed two gun positions, an <b>observation</b> <b>post,</b> and their supporting trenches, then stood by on call for further aid. She then sailed back to Wonsan for a day-long bombardment 24 June, aimed at guns placed in caves. The results were excellent, with eight direct hits on three caves, one cave demolished, and four others closed. Next day she {{returned to}} troop support at Kosong, her assignment until 10 July, aside from necessary withdrawal for replenishment.|$|E
5|$|Soon thereafter, {{a number}} of A-10 ground-attack {{aircraft}} arrived but {{found it difficult to}} pinpoint enemy targets and began dropping flares to illuminate the zone. One of these flares landed on a friendly vehicle, and although the vehicle radioed in its position, it was hit by an AGM-65 Maverick air-to-ground missile that killed the entire crew except for the driver. Following the incident, the company was withdrawn and the remaining vehicles reorganized into another nearby company. With <b>observation</b> <b>post</b> 4 cleared, the Iraqi 6th Armored Brigade withdrew over the border to Al-Wafrah under heavy fire from Coalition aircraft. Coalition forces had lost 11 troops to friendly fire and none to enemy action.|$|E

5|$|Storm {{warnings}} {{were issued}} from Savannah, Georgia to Fort Pierce, Florida {{subsequent to the}} discovery of the hurricane. The National Weather Bureau advised all small craft to remain at port and recommended residents in the northern Bahamas to take immediate precautions. On Grand Bahama, the threat of Hurricane Able resulted in a construction crew to evacuate further inland; the crew was constructing an <b>observation</b> <b>post</b> for guiding long-range missiles from Cape Canaveral. Fishermen on dozens of boats left the open ocean for safety on two Bahamian islands, while two airplanes safely rode out the hurricane. Small craft warnings and storm warnings were later issued from North Carolina through New England.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{remained}} armed, Deal was adapted by Sir John Norris and Lord Carrington during the 18th and 19th centuries {{to form a}} more suitable private house for the castle's captain, which was by now an honorary position. In 1904, the War Office concluded that the castle no longer had any value either as a defensive site or as a barracks, and it was {{opened to the public}} when the captain was not in residence. Early in the Second World War, the captain's quarters were destroyed by German bombing, forcing Deal's captain, William Birdwood, to move to Hampton Court Palace, and the castle became an <b>observation</b> <b>post</b> for an artillery battery placed along the shore line. The castle was not brought back into use as a residence and was restored by the government during the 1950s to form a tourist attraction. In the 21st century, Deal Castle is operated by English Heritage, receiving 25,256 visitors in 2008.|$|E
5|$|At Monte Cassino the {{historic}} abbey overlooked Allied positions below. Ground commanders were sure the monastery {{was being used}} by the Germans as an <b>observation</b> <b>post.</b> Lieutenant-General Bernard C. Freyberg, commander of the New Zealand Corps preparing for a new assault on the mountain, had repeatedly requested that the abbey be bombed. Taking advantage of the German practice of not giving away their positions by firing on small planes, Devers and Eaker flew low over the monastery, and saw what they believed to be a radio aerial and enemy soldiers moving in and out. Wilson reluctantly agreed to its bombing. On 15 February Devers watched waves of American bombers level the monastery with Alexander, Clark, Freyberg and Eaker. But follow-up attacks that day, and over the next eight days, failed to take the position, much less break the Gustav Line. Devers visited Anzio on 16 February, and agreed with Alexander that Lucas should be relieved. Clark did so on 22 February.|$|E
