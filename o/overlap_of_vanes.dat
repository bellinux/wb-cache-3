40|$|A {{new method}} for {{reducing}} large-scale mixing noise from dual-stream jets is presented. The principle is {{reduction of the}} convective Mach number of turbulent eddies that produce intense downward sound radiation. In a jet representing the coaxial exhaust of a turbofan engine, this is achieved by tilting downward, by a few degrees, the bypass (secondary) plume relative to the core (primary) plume. The misalignment of the two flows creates a thick low-speed secondary core {{on the underside of}} the high-speed primary flow. The secondary core reduces the convective Mach number of primary eddies, thus hindering their ability to generate sound that travels to the downward acoustic far field. Tilting of the bypass stream is possible by means of fixed or variable vanes installed near the exit of the bypass duct. Subscale aeroacoustic experiments simulated the exhaust flow of a turbofan engine with bypass ratio 6. 0. Deflection of the bypass stream resulted in suppression of the peak overall sound pressure level by 4. 5 dB and the effective perceived noise level by 2. 8 dB. For the nozzle configuration used, the thrust loss is estimated at around 0. 5 % with the vanes activated and 0. 15 % with the vanes deactivated.

40|$|The {{presence}} of capillary flow {{can be a}} benefit or a hindrance in many applications. The existence of capillary flow in gaps in low-gravity environments is of special interest {{for the design of}} propellant management devices (PMD). The first generation <b>of</b> the <b>Vane</b> Gap Experiment gave experimental results in low-gravity for a rectangular vane in an elliptical cylinder. This study looks at the design of a third generation <b>of</b> <b>Vane</b> Gap Experiment by looking at the existence of capillary flow and the static liquid-interface solutions for a tapered vane placed in an elliptical cylinder. The vane in this study can be rotated to change the orientation <b>of</b> the <b>vane</b> to the cylinder wall and to change the size of the gap between the vane and the cylinder wall. Surface Evolver is used to obtain the results in this thesis. ^ Baseline cases (cases without rotation axis offset {{from the center of the}} ellipse) where the base width <b>of</b> the <b>vane</b> and its taper are varied, offset cases where the axis of orientation is not at the center of the cylinder but is at the center <b>of</b> the <b>vane,</b> and flipped cases which flip the vane studied in the offset cases from top to bottom so that the narrow end <b>of</b> the <b>vane</b> is immersed in the liquid are looked at. This thesis shows that as the vane orientation changes the height to which the liquid climbs the gap also changes. At certain vane rotation angles the gap size between the vane and the cylinder wall is small enough for the liquid to climb to the top <b>of</b> the <b>vane.</b> Depending on whether the wide end <b>of</b> the <b>vane</b> or the narrow end <b>of</b> the <b>vane</b> is immersed in the liquid, what the initial gap size is, and what the vane taper is, the liquid will climb to the top <b>of</b> the <b>vane</b> or will stop before it gets to the top.
