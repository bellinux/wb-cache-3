5|$|Rather than {{overlaying}} songs <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>soundtrack,</b> or {{employing a}} score, The Wire primarily uses pieces {{of music that}} emanate from a source within the scene, such as a jukebox or car radio. This kind of music is known as diegetic or source cue. This practice is rarely breached, notably for the end-of-season montages and occasionally with a brief overlap of the closing theme and the final shot.|$|E
