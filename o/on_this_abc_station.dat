50|$|WTXL has {{traditionally}} been a distant runner up in the ratings to longtime dominant WCTV. WTWC {{has never been a}} contender in the market because its two attempts to air local newscasts were both unsuccessful. The second news department operated by that station was ultimately shuttered due to poor viewership and budget cuts. Throughout the duration of the operational outsourcing agreement between WTXL and WTWC, <b>this</b> <b>ABC</b> <b>station</b> produced some limited newscast programming on WTWC.|$|R

50|$|In December 2007, {{the news}} {{departments}} of WYTV and WKBN physically merged. As a result, over forty personnel at WYTV and six at WKBN were laid-off. Under the shared services agreement, the senior station partner began producing newscasts <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>ABC</b> affiliate from a secondary {{set at the}} Sunset Boulevard studios. A previous plan calling for WYTV to build satellite streetside studios in Downtown Youngstown were abandoned due to the consolidation.

50|$|Thames {{is often}} quoted {{as a prime}} example of a good {{commercial}} public-service broadcaster with shows covering all aspects of the spectrum and the largest producer in the network. Its shows achieved massive audiences and are still remembered many years later. This is sometimes attributed to the culture of the company, which could be claimed to be a continuation of that at <b>ABC.</b> <b>This</b> <b>station</b> was more highly regarded by the ITA (amongst others) than Rediffusion whose programming was seen as downmarket and whose management-style was viewed as high-handed. The two companies allowed Thames independence (although in later years there were accusations that they both treated the company as a cash cow).|$|R
