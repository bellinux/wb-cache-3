40|$|<b>The</b> {{molecular}} properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scrapie <b>agent</b> {{were investigated}} by subjecting partially purified preparations to electrophoresis on agarose gels. When electrophoresis was performed {{at room temperature}} in <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> sodium dodecyl sulfate (NaDodSO 4), most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> recoverable <b>agent</b> was found at <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gel, consistent with previous studies indicating aggregation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>agent</b> upon exposure to elevated temperatures. In addition, less than 5 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>agent</b> applied to <b>the</b> gel was found after electrophoresis, even though the study was performed with a low concentration of NaDodSO 4 (0. 1 %). Further studies on <b>the</b> inactivation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>agent</b> by NaDodSO 4 suggest that this may be, in part, a function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> NaDodSO 4 : protein ratio in the sample. In contrast, sodium N-lauroyl sarcosinate (Sarkosyl) did not inactivate <b>the</b> <b>agent</b> in concentrations as high as 5 % (wt/vol). Virtually all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> infectivity could be recovered after electrophoresis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>agent</b> into 0. 6 % agarose gels at 4 degrees C in <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> 0. 2 % Sarkosyl. Digestion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> preparations with micrococcal nuclease and proteinase K prior to Sarkosyl electrophoresis caused a substantial portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>agent</b> to migrate ahead of DNA fragments of 1 x 10 (6) daltons. <b>The</b> behavior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scrapie <b>agent</b> in electrophoretic gels is consistent with earlier studies showing that <b>the</b> monomeric form <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>agent</b> has a sedimentation coefficient of {{less than or equal}} to 40 S.

40|$|Research on {{embodied}} conversational agent interfaces {{has produced}} widely divergent results.

40|$|From an {{external}} perspective, cognitive agent {{behavior can be}} described by specifying (temporal) correlations of a certain complexity between stimuli (input states) and (re) actions (output states) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>agent.</b> From an internal perspective <b>the</b> <b>agent’s</b> dynamics can be characterized by direct (causal) temporal relations between internal and mental states <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>agent.</b> <b>The</b> latter type <b>of</b> specifications can be represented in a relatively simple, executable format, which enables different types <b>of</b> analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>agent’s</b> behavior.

Furthermore, by applying verification techniques, automated analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> consequences <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>agent’s</b> behavior can be carried out.

40|$|This paper studies how renegotiation and {{information}} persistence shape long-term contracts in principal-agent relationships. Truthful contracts that are renegotiation-proof, {{according to a}} concept tailored to account for persistence in <b>the</b> <b>agent’s</b> type, are characterized by their sensitivity to <b>the</b> reports <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>agent.</b> <b>The</b> sensitivity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> optimal renegotiation-proof contract is increasing in information persistence and in <b>the</b> discount rate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>agent,</b> and causes immiserization.

25|$|The {{breach of}} secrecy around Bentley's {{defection}} foiled a year-long attempt by the FBI to have her act as a double agent.

Some 250 FBI agents were assigned to the Bentley case, following up the leads she had provided and, through phone tap, surveillance and mail openings, investigating people she had named.
