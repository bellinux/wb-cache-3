40|$|The {{regeneration}} <b>of</b> <b>alien</b> {{and indigenous}} vegetation in various post-fire environments, following the extensive January 2000 wildfires on the Cape Peninsula, South Africa, is described. The effects of dry season wildfire burning <b>of</b> standing <b>alien</b> plants and stacks <b>of</b> mechanically cleared, <b>alien</b> plant material, on post-fire seed banks and vegetation recovery, are presented. These are {{compared to the}} effects of wildfire burning on adjacent stands of un-invaded Sandstone Fynbos (previously known as Mountain Fynbos) vegetation and to that on cleared areas surrounding wildfire burnt stacks. The effects of stacking and controlled burning of slash <b>of</b> cleared <b>alien</b> plant material on regeneration potential, under cool weather conditions, are also reported. Seed banks and regeneration were linked to pre-fire vegetation characteristics, fire intensity and, in particular, to the management <b>of</b> <b>alien</b> plants. Large volumes of either standing or stacked alien woody plant biomass impact negatively upon post-wildfire seed banks and upon the recruitment of indigenous fynbos vegetation. Heat damage, associated with stacks <b>of</b> woody <b>alien</b> biomass, kills all seeds to a soil depth of at least 0. 15 m. In contrast, the controlled winter burning <b>of</b> stacks <b>of</b> <b>alien</b> material results in large scale localised germination <b>of</b> <b>alien</b> seeds. Both persistent indigenous seed banks and the seed <b>of</b> <b>alien</b> invasive species are present in the burnt disturbed areas surrounding stacks <b>of</b> <b>alien</b> slash burnt in wildfires.

5|$|Heinlein {{draws an}} analogy between the human {{society in the}} novel, which is well-to-do but needs to be {{vigilant}} against the imperialist threat of the Arachnids, and U.S. society of the 1950s. Reviewers {{have suggested that the}} Arachnids are Heinlein's analogue for communists. Traits used to support this include the communal nature of the Arachnids, which makes them capable of a much higher degree of coordination than the humans. Bug society is once explicitly described as communist, and is moreover depicted as communist by nature; this has been read as implying that those with a different political ideology are analogous to alien beings. The related motifs of alien invasion, of being patriotic to one's people, and personal sacrifice during war, are present, as are other aspects of U.S. popular culture of the 1950s. Commentators have argued that Heinlein's portrayal <b>of</b> <b>aliens,</b> as well as being a reference to people in communist countries, invokes the trope of a return to the frontier. The concept of the frontier includes a social-Darwinist argument of constantly fighting for survival, even at the expense of indigenous people or, in the case of Starship Troopers, <b>of</b> <b>aliens.</b> Heinlein suggests that without territorial expansion involving violent conquest of other races, humans would be destroyed. Scholar Jamie King has stated that Heinlein does not address the question of what the military government and Federal Service would do in peacetime, and argues that Heinlein has set up a society designed to be continuously at war, and to keep expanding its territory.|$|E
40|$|The spatial {{distribution}} <b>of</b> <b>alien</b> species richness often correlates positively with native species richness, and reflects {{the role of}} human density and activity, and primary productivity and habitat heterogeneity, in facilitating the establishment and spread <b>of</b> <b>alien</b> species. Here, we investigate {{the relationship between the}} {{spatial distribution}} <b>of</b> <b>alien</b> bird species, human density, and anthropogenic and natural environmental conditions. Next, we examined the relationship between the spatial distribution <b>of</b> <b>alien</b> bird species and native bird species richness. We examined alien species richness as a response variable, using correlative analyses that take spatial autocorrelation into account. Further, each alien bird species was examined as a response variable, using logistic regression procedures based on binary presence–absence data. A combination of human density and natural habitat heterogeneity best explained the spatial distribution <b>of</b> <b>alien</b> species richness. This contrasts with the results for individual alien species and with previous studies on other non-native taxa showing the importance of primary productivity and anthropogenic habitat modification as explanatory variables. In general, native species richness is an important correlate of the spatial distribution <b>of</b> <b>alien</b> species richness and individual alien species, with alien species being more similar to common species than to rare species...|$|R

40|$|Developing generalisations of {{invasive}} species {{is an important}} part of invasion biology. However, trends and generalisations from one part of the world may not necessarily hold elsewhere. We present the first inventory and analysis <b>of</b> all Hymenoptera <b>alien</b> to New Zealand, and compare patterns from New Zealand with those previously published from Europe (DAISIE). Between the two regions there was broad correlation between families with the highest number <b>of</b> <b>alien</b> species (Braconidae, Encyrtidae, Pteromalidae, Eulophidae, Formicidae, Aphelinidae). However, major differences also existed. The number <b>of</b> species <b>alien</b> to New Zealand is higher than for Europe (334 vs 286), and major differences include: i) the much lower proportion of intentionally released species in New Zealand (21 % vs 63 % in Europe); and ii) the greater proportion of unintentionally introduced parasitoids in New Zealand (71. 2 % vs 22. 6 %). The disharmonic 'island' nature of New Zealand is shown, as a high proportion of families (36 %) have no native representatives, and alien species also represent > 10 % of the native fauna for many other families. A much larger proportion <b>of</b> <b>alien</b> species are found in urban areas in New Zealand (60 %) compared to Europe (~ 30 %), and higher numbers <b>of</b> <b>alien</b> species were present earlier in New Zealand (especially < 1950). Differences in the origins <b>of</b> <b>alien</b> species were also apparent. Unlike Europe, the New Zealand data reveals a change in the origins <b>of</b> <b>alien</b> species over time, with an increasing dominance <b>of</b> <b>alien</b> species from Australasia (a regional neighbour) during the past 25 years.

40|$|The article {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} <b>of</b> <b>alien</b> species in local floras of the Voronezh region Nature Reserve Fund. The Voronezh Region {{is located on the}} border of the forest-steppe and steppe zones. 16 Model Protected Areas (PAs), having a different conservation status and a various size, have been chosen for the analysis. The article attempts to assess: a) the degree of biological contamination of PAs that protect forest-steppe and steppe ecosystems; b) features <b>of</b> the <b>alien</b> fractions <b>of</b> the PAs' flora of various categories. The characteristics of PAs with respect to the possibilities and conditions for the invasion <b>of</b> <b>alien</b> species <b>of</b> vascular plants are given. The <b>alien</b> fraction <b>of</b> the PAs' flora comprises 262 taxa: 255 species, 5 hybrids, 1 subspecies and 1 variety, referring to 178 genera and 66 families. For the typological analysis, alien species were divided into groups in accordance with the time of the invasion, the way of invasion and the naturalisation level. The average proportion of invasive species in PAs floras is 11. 1 % (in different local floras it varies from 4. 4 % to 16. 8 %). When considering stable flora elements only (excluding ephemerophytes and colonophytes), then the PAs' local flora contamination ratio will make the average of 6. 1 % (from 3. 5 % to 8. 9 %). The largest number <b>of</b> <b>alien</b> species is noted in the floras of state reserves and state nature sanctuaries, regional PAs are characterised by a smaller proportion <b>of</b> <b>alien</b> plants. The analysis of the ways <b>of</b> <b>alien</b> species' invasion has shown that human activity on introduction of plants makes an important contribution to the replenishment <b>of</b> the <b>alien</b> flora in protected areas: 31. 7 % <b>of</b> <b>alien</b> species had left the cultivation area, 15 % were deliberately planted in the PAs. Transformer plants are of the greatest coenotic significance, out <b>of</b> 19 such <b>alien</b> species 11 are xenophytes, the other 8 species are ergasiophytes. The conclusion is made about the necessity to move from the monitoring <b>of</b> <b>alien</b> species to practical work on managing the process <b>of</b> <b>alien</b> plant invasion in state reserves...|$|R
40|$|Aim To {{provide the}} first {{comparative}} overview {{on the current}} numbers <b>of</b> <b>alien</b> species that invade representative European terrestrial and freshwater habitats {{for a range of}} taxonomic groups. Location Europe. Methods Numbers <b>of</b> naturalized <b>alien</b> species <b>of</b> plants, insects, herptiles, birds and mammals occurring in 10 habitats defined according to the European Nature Information System (EUNIS) were obtained from 115 regional data sets. Only species introduced after ad 1500 were considered. Data were analysed by ANCOVA and regression trees to assess whether differences exist among taxonomic groups in terms of their habitat affinity, and whether the pattern <b>of</b> occurrence <b>of</b> <b>alien</b> species in European habitats interacts with macroecological factors such as insu- larity, latitude or area. Results The highest numbers <b>of</b> <b>alien</b> plant and insect species were found in human-made, urban or cultivated habitats; if controlled for habitat area in the region, wetland and riparian habitats appeared to support relatively high numbers <b>of</b> <b>alien</b> plant species too. Invasions by vertebrates were more evenly distributed among habitats, with aquatic and riparian, woodland and cultivated land most invaded. Mires, bogs and fens, grassland, heathland and scrub were generally less invaded. Habitat and taxonomic group explained most variation in the proportions <b>of</b> <b>alien</b> species occurring in individual habitats related to the total number <b>of</b> <b>alien</b> species in a region, and the basic pattern determined by these factors was fine-tuned by geographical variables, namely by the mainland–island contrast and latitude, and differed among taxonomic groups. Main conclusions There are two ecologically distinct groups <b>of</b> <b>alien</b> species (plants and insects versus vertebrates) with strikingly different habitat affinities. Invasions by these two contrasting groups are complementary in terms of habitat use, which makes an overall assessment of habitat invasions in Europe possible. Since numbers of naturalized species in habitats are correlated among taxa within these two groups, the data collected for one group of vertebrates, for example, could be used to estimate the habitat-specific numbers <b>of</b> <b>alien</b> species for other vertebrate groups with reasonable precision, and {{the same holds true for}} insects and plants.
