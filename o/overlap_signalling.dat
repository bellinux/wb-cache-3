In this work, a simulation under MATLAB is implemented to illustrate the concept of <b>overlapping</b> <b>signals.</b> We propose an approach for resolving <b>overlapping</b> <b>signals</b> based on Fourier transform and inverse Fourier transform. The proposed approach is tested under MATLAB, and the simulation results validate the effectiveness and {{the accuracy of the}} proposed approach. The approach is developed using Gerchberg superresolution technique to cope with signals with low signal-to-noise ratio. For practical work, an echo shape determination is required to apply the proposed technique. The experimental results show accurate localization of multiple targets...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} CRESM, a novel collision resolution {{method for}} decoding collided packets in random-access wireless networks. In a collision, <b>overlapping</b> <b>signals</b> from several sources are received simultaneously at a receiver. CRESM exploits symbol misalignment among the <b>overlapping</b> <b>signals</b> {{to recover the}} individual packets. CRESM can be adopted in 802. 11 networks without modification of the transmitter design; only a simple DSP technique is needed at the receiver to decode the <b>overlapping</b> <b>signals.</b> Our simulations indicate that CRESM has better BER performance than the simplistic Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) technique that treats interference as noise, for almost all SNR regimes. The implication of CRESM for random-access networking is significant: in general, using CRESM to resolve collisions of up to n packets, network throughput can be boosted by more than n times if the transmitters are allowed to transmit more aggressively in the MAC protocol.

However, the inverse filtering approach {{is shown to}} be useful for resolving <b>overlapping</b> <b>signals,</b> identical or otherwise, of unknown waveshapes. Digital inverse filter design based on autocorrelation formulation of linear prediction is known to perform optimum spectral flattening of the input signal for which the filter is designed.

40|$|Conceptually, {{this paper}} {{discusses}} strategies of digital satellite communication networks {{for a very}} large number of low density traffic stations. These stations can be either aeronautical, land mobile, or maritime. The techniques can be applied to international, domestic, regional, and special purpose satellite networks. The applications can be commercial, scientific, military, emergency, navigational or educational. The key strategy is the use of a non-orthogonal access method, which tolerates <b>overlapping</b> <b>signals.</b> With n being either time or frequency partitions, and with a single <b>overlapping</b> <b>signal</b> allowed, a low cost mobile satellite system can be designed with n squared (n squared + n + 1) number of terminals...|$|R

30|$|A {{plethora of}} {{advanced}} signal processing mechanisms aim at reducing or eliminating potential interferences[20 – 22] has been proposed. SIC[20] decodes a relatively stronger <b>signal</b> from <b>overlapped</b> <b>signals</b> and then distracts a weaker signal by subtracting the stronger <b>signal</b> from the <b>overlapped</b> <b>signals.</b> This mechanism requires complex symbol level signal manipulation. Similarly, ZigZag[23] requires signal manipulation {{to recover the}} signal from the collided frames. It does not increase the wireless capacity but only reduces the number of retransmissions similar to PPR[24]. On the other hand, IAC[21], SAM[22], CSMA/CN[25] support concurrent transmissions by the interference alignment and interference cancellation using multiple signal streams obtainable in MIMO environments. It is worthwhile noting that our proposal, DOMCT, targets single antenna systems.|$|R

40|$|The nuclear {{disaster}} {{that occurred in}} Chernobyl in 1986 offered the unique opportunity to study the molecular genetics of one human tumor type, papillary carcinoma of the thyroid gland, associated with a specific etiology. We have analyzed RET rearrangements in post-Chernobyl papillary thyroid carcinomas (n = 29), follicular thyroid adenomas (n = 2), and follicular thyroid carcinoma (n = 1) by interphase {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH) analysis on paraffin-embedded tissue sections. Paraffin sections were microdissected before use to ensure that only tumor was present. Cell nuclei were scored for the presence of a split FISH signal (separated red and green signal) in addition to an <b>overlapping</b> <b>signal.</b> Only cells with either two <b>overlapping</b> <b>signals</b> or one split and one <b>overlapping</b> <b>signal</b> were counted to ensure that only complete cell nuclei had been scored. In total, 23 of 32 cases (72 %) showed RET rearrangements diagnosed by FISH interphase analysis. In all cases, the tumors were composed of a mixture of cells with and without ret rearrangement on FISH. In some cases, this distribution was clearly nonrandom because clustering of rearranged cells was detected within the same tumor nodule. Accordingly, only 31 % of the cases positive for rearrangement on FISH also scored positive using RT-PCR. These findings suggest that because RET/PTC rearrangements are not present in a majority of tumor cells, either a fraction of post-Chernobyl papillary thyroid tumors are of multiclonal origin, or ret rearrangement is a later, subclonal event...|$|R

Channel 4 provides at least grade B signal coverage to all of Rhode Island, and city-grade coverage within Providence itself as well as Fall River and New Bedford. At the time, the FCC normally did not allow common ownership of two stations with <b>overlapping</b> <b>signals,</b> and would not even consider a waiver for stations with <b>overlapping</b> city-grade <b>signals.</b> In 1996, WBZ-TV became the first former Group W station to drop the classic Group W font.|$|R
40|$|For the <b>overlapped</b> <b>signal</b> {{and unknown}} {{longitudinal}} velocity leading to difficulty in measuring {{the thickness of}} thin layers, a method based on ultrasonic reflection coefficient amplitude spectrum (URCAS) matching analysis technique was proposed to characterize thickness and ultrasonic longitudinal velocity of thin layered structure simultaneously.

30|$|As in [14], we {{have used}} for training, development, and testing up to eight {{sessions}} of audio data with isolated acoustic events. Each session was recorded with all the six T-shaped microphone arrays (24 microphones). The <b>overlapped</b> <b>signals</b> of the database were generated adding those AE signals recorded {{in the room with}} a speech signal, also recorded in the room for a single speaker from all the 24 microphones. To do that, for each AE instance, a segment with the same length was extracted from the speech signal starting from a random position and added to the AE signal. The mean power of speech was made equivalent to the mean power of the overlapping AE. That addition of signals produces an increment of the background noise level, since it is included twice in the overlapped signals; however, going from isolated to <b>overlapped</b> <b>signals,</b> the SNR reduction is slight: from 18.7 to 17.5  dB. The average duration of the events is 500  ms, and the reverberation time of the room is around 450  ms. Signals were recorded at 44.1  kHz sampling frequency and further converted to 16  kHz.|$|R
40|$|Stochastic bigraphical {{reactive}} systems (SBRS) is {{a recent}} formalism for modelling systems that evolve in time and space. However, the underlying spatial model is based on sets of trees and thus cannot represent spatial locations that are shared among several entities in a simple or intuitive way.

40|$|Background: Mussels of {{the genus}} Mytilus present morphologically similar karyotypes that are presumably conserved. The absence of {{chromosome}} painting probes in bivalves makes difficult verifying this hypothesis. In this context, we comparatively mapped ribosomal RNA and histone gene families on the chromosomes of Mytilus edulis, M. galloprovincialis, M. trossulus and M. californianus by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). Results: Major rRNA, core and linker histone gene clusters mapped to different chromosome pairs in the four taxa. In contrast, minor rRNA gene clusters showed a different behavior. In all Mytilus two of the 5 S rDNA clusters mapped to the same chromosome pair {{and one of them}} showed <b>overlapping</b> <b>signals</b> with those corresponding to one of the histone H 1 gene clusters.
