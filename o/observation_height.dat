The four variables, carrier gas flow rate, pump speed, plasma <b>observation</b> <b>height</b> and plasma power were regarded as factors in the optimization process. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) and a p-value significance level of 0. 05 followed by the Pareto chart of standardized main and interaction effects {{were used to assess}} the significance of the factors on the response, i. e. platinum intensity. The main effects of carrier gas flow rate and plasma power and the interaction effect of carrier gas flow rate and plasma power were found to be statistically significant. The procedure was optimized using contour maps and response surface methodology. Plasma <b>observation</b> <b>height</b> and pump speed were found to have an insignificant effect on the platinum intensity. The recommended optimized procedure comprised the following levels for the variables: carrier gas flow rate of 0. 70 L/Min and plasma power of 1400 W.

The {{published}} {{article is}} copyrighted by American Meteorological Society {{and can be}} found at: [URL] investigation of nocturnal intermittent turbulence during the Cooperative Atmosphere Surface Exchange Study in 1999 (CASES- 99) revealed three turbulence regimes at each observation height: 1) regime 1, a weak turbulence regime when the wind speed is less than a threshold value; 2) regime 2, a strong turbulence regime when the wind speed exceeds the threshold value; and 3) regime 3, a moderate turbulence regime when top-down turbulence sporadically bursts into the otherwise weak turbulence regime. For regime 1, the strength of small turbulence eddies is correlated with local shear and weakly related to local stratification. For regime 2, the turbulence strength increases systematically with wind speed as a result of turbulence generation by the bulk shear, which scales with the <b>observation</b> <b>height.</b> The threshold wind speed marks the transition above which the boundary layer approaches near-neutral conditions, where the turbulent mixing substantially reduces the stratification and temperature fluctuations. The preference of the turbulence regimes during CASES- 99 is closely related to the existence and the strength of low-level jets. Because of the different roles of the bulk and local shear with regard to turbulence generation under different wind conditions, the relationship between turbulence strength and the local gradient Richardson number varies for the different turbulence regimes. Turbulence intermittency at any <b>observation</b> <b>height</b> was categorized in three ways: turbulence magnitude oscillations between regimes 1 and 2 as wind speed varies back and forth across its threshold value, episodic turbulence enhancements within regime 1 as a result of local instability, and downbursts of turbulence in regime 3...|$|E

These products are either produced in the ENVISAT Payload Data Segment as operational products or by science institutes as scientific products or value-added products. Operational processing occurs in two steps – level 0 - 1 b and level 1 b- 2. In both steps different timescales may apply – near-realtime, fast delivery or offline. Level 0 - 1 b processing generates geolocated and calibrated radiances from the raw atmospheric measurements, as well as from measurements for calibration and instrument monitoring. The algorithms convert measured signals into calibrated radiances. Therefore a sequence of calibration steps has to be applied starting with correcting the memory effect and non-linearity and ending with applying the radiometric instrument response.

In this study, a novel setup is proposed for {{the investigation of the}} probe effects. A hollow graphite tube was used as a stand-in for the DSI sample probe to exert probe effects on the plasma. Laser-ablated testing elements (Fe, Zn and Mg) were introduced separately into the central channel of the plasma via the hollow graphite tube for measurement of plasma excitation temperature and electron number density. A relatively low Ar carrier gas flow rate (0. 42 L min- 1) was used to minimize perturbation to the plasma due to the gas flow. The study shows that the extent of reduction in plasma excitation temperature and electron number density increases with probe insertion position at all <b>observation</b> <b>heights.</b> In addition, the probe effects strongly depend on the relative distance of the observation position to the tip of the probe. The probe effects are the strongest near the tip of the probe and reduce at observation positions further away from the tip.
