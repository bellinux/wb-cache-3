In healthy volunteers, the time to first perception (control task: 617 +/- 174 s vs stress task: 561 +/- 162 s), discomfort (control task: 969 +/- 158 s vs stress task: 940 +/- 151 s) or pain (control task: 1393 +/- 122 s vs stress task: 1366 +/- 121 s) did not differ significantly between both measurements. In GORD patients, no significant differences between both measurements were found either in time to first perception (control task: 63 +/- 26 s vs stress task: 43 +/- 15 s), discomfort (control task: 153 +/- 44 s vs stress task: 249 +/- 62 s) or pain (control task: 558 +/- 139 s vs stress task: 633 +/- 118 s). Systolic blood pressure rose significantly during the stress task in both the healthy volunteers (6 +/- 1 mmHg) and the GORD patients (9 +/- 2 mmHg).

This study examined the relation between these three parameters in patients referred for pH monitoring with unexplained chest pain or heartburn. Fifty consecutive patients were studied - nine with non-cardiac chest pain and 41 with a history of heartburn.

40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that radiofrequency energy delivery at the gastroesophageal junction (the Stretta procedure) induces symptom relief in gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), although improvement of acid exposure on pH monitoring was usually limited. A role for decreased esophageal sensitivity has been suggested. Our aim was to evaluate the influence of Stretta on symptoms, acid exposure, and sensitivity to esophageal <b>acid</b> <b>perfusion</b> in GERD. Thirteen patients with established proton pump inhibitor (PPI) -dependent GERD (three males; mean age, 51 +/- 10 years) participated in the study. Before and 6 months after the procedure symptom score, pH monitoring and Bernstein <b>acid</b> <b>perfusion</b> <b>test</b> were performed. The latter was done by infusing HCl (pH 0. 1) at a rate of 6 ml/min 15 cm proximal to the gastroesophageal junction for a maximum of 30 min or until the patients experienced heartburn. Results were compared by Student's t-test. Stretta procedure time was 51 +/- 4 min and no complications occurred. After 6 months, the symptom score was significantly improved (12. 5 +/- 2. 0 to 7. 5 +/- 2. 1; P< 0. 05), seven patients no longer needed daily PPI, and acid exposure was significantly decreased (11. 6 %+/- 1. 6 % to 8. 5 %+/- 1. 8 % of time pH< 4; P< 0. 05). The time needed to induce heartburn during <b>acid</b> <b>perfusion</b> decreased from 9. 5 +/- 2. 3 to 18. 1 +/- 3. 4 min (P= 0. 01), and five patients became insensitive to 30 -min <b>acid</b> <b>perfusion,</b> versus none at baseline (P= 0. 04).

The 24 hour pH and pressure recording correlated spontaneous chest pain attacks with abnormal motility or gastro-oesophageal reflux in 19 patients (38 %). Fourteen of these patients also had at least one positive provocation test. Therefore, 24 hour pH and pressure recordings are only slightly better than a set of provocation tests in identifying the oesophagus as the cause of chest pain (10 % diagnostic gain).

40|$|Acid reflux episodes {{that extend}} to the {{proximal}} esophagus {{are more likely to}} be perceived. This suggests that the proximal esophagus is more sensitive to acid than the distal esophagus, which could be caused by impaired mucosal integrity in the proximal esophagus. Our aim was to explore sensitivity to acid and mucosal integrity in different segments of the esophagus. We used a prospective observational study, including 12 patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). After stopping acid secretion-inhibiting medication, two procedures were performed: an <b>acid</b> <b>perfusion</b> <b>test</b> and an upper endoscopy with electrical tissue impedance spectroscopy and esophageal biopsies. Proximal and distal sensitivity to acid and tissue impedance were measured in vivo, and mucosal permeability and epithelial intercellular spaces at different esophageal levels were measured in vitro. Mean lag time to heartburn perception was much shorter after proximal <b>acid</b> <b>perfusion</b> (0. 8 min) than after distal <b>acid</b> <b>perfusion</b> (3. 9 min) (P = 0. 02). Median in vivo tissue impedance was significantly lower in the distal esophagus (4, 563 Ω·m) compared with the proximal esophagus (8, 170 Ω·m) (P = 0. 002). Transepithelial permeability, as measured by the median fluorescein flux was significantly higher in the distal (2, 051 nmol·cm(- 2) ·h(- 1)) than in the proximal segment (368 nmol·cm(- 2) ·h(- 1)) (P = 0. 033). Intercellular space ratio and maximum heartburn intensity were not significantly different between the proximal and distal esophagus. In GERD patients off acid secretion-inhibiting medication, acid exposure in the proximal segment of the esophagus provokes symptoms earlier than acid exposure in the distal esophagus, whereas mucosal integrity is impaired more in the distal esophagus.

The etiology of the heartburn sensation in FH patients is unknown. In patients with reflux disease, esophageal hypersensitivity seems associated with impaired mucosal integrity.

MethodsIn this prospective experimental study, we performed an <b>acid</b> <b>perfusion</b> <b>test</b> and upper endoscopy with biopsies in 12 patients with NERD and nine patients with FH.

In this prospective experimental study, 12 patients with nonerosive reflux disease, 12 patients with esophagitis grade A or B, and 11 healthy control subjects underwent an <b>acid</b> <b>perfusion</b> <b>test</b> and upper endoscopy. Mucosal integrity was measured during endoscopy by electrical tissue impedance spectroscopy and biopsy specimens were analyzed in Ussing chambers for transepithelial electrical resistance, transepithelial permeability and gene expression of tight junction proteins and filaggrin. Patients with nonerosive reflux disease and esophagitis were more sensitive to <b>acid</b> <b>perfusion</b> compared with control subjects, having a shorter time to perception of heartburn and higher perceived intensity of heartburn. In reflux patients, enhanced acid sensitivity was associated with impairment of in vivo and vitro esophageal mucosal integrity.

Although no significant differences in the expression of tight junction proteins were found in biopsies among patient groups, mucosal integrity parameters in reflux patients correlated negatively with the expression of filaggrin.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis concerns neurophysiology and pharmacology of the oesophageal afferent pathways involved in oesophago-pharyngeal reflexes and oesophageal nociception. Disturbances of reflexes governing contractile and relaxation responses of the upper oesophageal sphincter (DOS) {{are likely to be}} implicated in the pathophysiology of conditions involving excessive oesophago-pharyngeal regurgitation, impaired oesophageal clearance, and an abnormal belch reflex. Visceral hypersensitivity, a heightened perception of gastrointestinal sensation is frequently observed in functional gastrointestinal disorders and provides compelling evidence that it {{plays an important role in}} the pathogenesis of functional heartburn and non-erosive reflux disease. The work in this thesis explores the neurophysiology, pharmacology and pathophysiology of oesophago-DOS reflexes in humans by experimentally inducing DOS relaxations in healthy controls and patients with reflux laryngitis, and by recording DOS motor responses during spontaneous oesophago-pharyngeal regurgitation. Nociception was assessed by measuring oesophageal sensitivity to electrical stimulation and <b>oesophageal</b> <b>acid</b> <b>perfusion</b> in healthy controls, which was then compared with several heartburn populations (functional heartburn, erosive and non-erosive reflux disease). Additional studies were performed to evaluate the potential role of intraluminal impedance in defining antegrade bolus flow through the pharyngo-oesophageal segment during swallowing as a prelude to the adaptation of the technique to find a more accurate method for the detection of oesophago-pharyngeal regurgitation. The main findings from this work are as follows. 1) Mucosal lignocaine-sensitive afferents mediate the distension-induced oesophago-DOS relaxation reflex and lignocaine insensitive, presumably muscular mechanoceptors, mediate the distension-induced oesophago-DOS contractile reflex. The latter reflex is also upregulated by oesophageal acidification indicative of a possible protective mechanism. 2) Prolonged studies in patients with proven oesophago-pharyngeal regurgitation demonstrated that the most common mechanism of oesophago-pharyngeal regurgitation is a transient, non-swallow related, relaxation of the DOS. 3) Experimental evaluation of the oesophago-DOS relaxation reflex revealed that it is upregulated in patients with reflux laryngitis, suggesting that the aberrant afferent signalling in the oesophagus may be a contributory factor mediating oesophago-pharyngeal regurgitation. 4) Measurement of oesophageal sensory thresholds in response to electrical stimulation and <b>acid</b> <b>perfusion</b> revealed that all patients, irrespective of the presence or absence of mucosal injury, exhibit acid-induced hypersensitisation. 5) The viscro-somatic referral pattern of acid- and electrically-induced chest pain is increased in patients with functional heartburn and non-erosive reflux disease.

40|$|Aims: To {{test the}} {{usefulness}} of upper gastrointestinal investigations {{and quality of life}} assessment in Chinese patients with non-cardiac chest pain. Methods: Seventy-eight consecutive patients with noncardiac chest pain underwent upper endoscopy. Eight patients had upper gastrointestinal pathology (10 %). The remaining 70 patients received <b>acid</b> <b>perfusion</b> <b>test,</b> <b>oesophageal</b> manometry and 24 -h ambulatory oesophageal pH (n = 65) /manometry (n = 61), and the results were compared with those of healthy controls (n = 20). Symptoms and quality of life (SF- 36) were assessed by standard validated questionnaire. Results: Significant acid reflux symptoms were present in five (5 / 70. 7 %) patients. Abnormal 24 -h oesophageal pH, indicating gastro-oesophageal reflux, was found in 19 (19 / 65, 29 %) patients. The percentage of simultaneous contractions was higher and the percentage peristalsis was lower in patients with non-cardiac chest pain when compared with normal subjects by 24 -h ambulatory manometry. Patients with non-cardiac chest pain had a lower SF- 36 score when compared to controls. Conclusions: Typical acid reflux symptoms are uncommon in Chinese patients with non-cardiac chest pain, but abnormal 24 -h pH results, indicating gastro-oesophageal reflux, were found in 29 % of patients.

40|$|Background: Patients with Barrett's {{esophagus}} (BE) {{usually have}} severe gastroesophageal reflux. However, {{they often have}} surprisingly few reflux symptoms. We hypothesized that BE patients are less sensitive to acid than gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) patients without Barrett {{and that this is}} due to an unusual preservation of mucosal integrity of the squamous epithelium prohibiting transepithelial acid diffusion. Methods: We prospectively analyzed esophageal sensitivity and esophageal mucosal integrity in GERD patients with and without BE and healthy subjects. An <b>acid</b> <b>perfusion</b> <b>test</b> was performed and mucosal integrity was assessed in vivo by electrical tissue impedance spectroscopy and ex vivo by Ussing chamber experiments with biopsy specimens. Key Results: Gastroesophageal reflux disease patients with BE were less sensitive to acid than GERD patients without BE, but more sensitive to acid than healthy controls (time to perception Barrett's 14. 0 minutes, GERD 4. 6 minutes, controls 17. 5 minutes). However, extracellular impedance (6. 2 and 5. 7 vs 8. 4 x 10 (3) /m) and transepithelial resistance (94. 0 and 89 vs 118 /cm(2)) was similar in BE and GERD patients and significantly lower than in healthy subjects.

40|$|Background—Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) plays a {{major role}} in the {{development}} of Barrett’s oesophagus. However, it has yet to be elucidated what factors determine the length of Barrett’s mucosa in each individual patient. Aims—To determine if there is a correla-tion between <b>oesophageal</b> <b>acid</b> exposure and the length of Barrett’s mucosa. We also compared the extent of <b>oesophageal</b> <b>acid</b> exposure between patients with short segment (SSBE) and long segment (LSBE) Barrett’s oesophagus. Methods—Twenty seven patients with Barrett’s oesophagus were recruited pro-spectively into the study from the outpa-tient gastroenterology clinic at the Southern Arizona VA Health Care Sys-tem. Diagnosis of Barrett’s oesophagus and its anatomical characteristics were determined during upper endoscopy. Am-bulatory 24 hour oesophageal pH moni-toring assessed the extent of <b>oesophageal</b> <b>acid</b> exposure. Results—There was a significant correla-tion between per cent total time pH less than 4 and length of Barrett’s mucosa (r= 0. 6234, p= 0. 0005). In addition, there was a significant correlation between per cent upright and supine time pH less than 4 and length of Barrett’s mucosa (r= 0. 5847, p= 0. 0014 and r= 0. 6265 p= 0. 0006, respectively). Patients with SSBE had significantly less <b>oesophageal</b> <b>acid</b> exposure than patients with LSBE, in terms of both per cent total time and per cent supine time pH less than 4 (p< 0. 05). Conclusions—The length of Barrett’s mu-cosa correlated with the duration of <b>oesophageal</b> <b>acid</b> exposure. Patients with LSBE experienced significantly more <b>oesophageal</b> <b>acid</b> exposure than patients with SSBE. Duration of <b>oesophageal</b> <b>acid</b> exposure appears to be an important con-tributing factor in determining the length of Barrett’s mucosa. (Gut 2001; 48 : 310 – 313...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. There is an {{increased}} prevalence of gastrooesophageal reflux and symptoms in obese patients. Information about the proximal stomach in obese patients with reflux is lacking. Gastric volume and compliance are similar between obese and lean subjects. To study the proximal stomach function and perception in obese patients with normal or abnormal <b>oesophageal</b> <b>acid</b> exposure, thirty-one obese patients, with normal or abnormal <b>oesophageal</b> <b>acid</b> exposure, underwent medical evaluation of oesophageal and gastrointestinal symptoms by a questionnaire and measurement of proximal stomach function and perception by an electronic barostat and a standardized questionnaire. Nineteen obese patients had abnormal <b>oesophageal</b> <b>acid</b> exposure. The {{percentage of total}} time with pH < 4 is {{significantly related to the}} presence of hiatal hernia, the oesophageal intensity-frequency symptom score and gender, i. e. higher percentage in men. The perception cumulative score was significantly different between patients with normal and abnormal <b>oesophageal</b> <b>acid</b> exposure after adjusting for covariates (gender, body mass index, age, minimal distending pressure, gastric tone and gastric compliance). Gastric tone and compliance were significantly related to the perception cumulative score. In conclusion, patients with abnormal <b>oesophageal</b> <b>acid</b> exposure have increased gastric perception. A significant relation among gastric tone, gastric compliance and upper gastrointestinal sensations was shown...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the hypothesis that impaired oesophageal peristalsis was associated with delayed <b>oesophageal</b> clearance of <b>acid</b> in patients with progressive systemic sclerosis (PSS), {{some of whom are}} thought to have impaired <b>oesophageal</b> sensitivity to <b>acid.</b> Sixteen patients with PSS had: (a) oesophageal manometry and endoscopy; (b) <b>acid</b> <b>perfusion</b> of the oesophagus with simultaneous measurement of intraoesophageal pH during perfusion and for the next 10 minutes; (c) 22 hour monitoring of intraoesophageal pH; and (d) an evaluation of reflux symptoms during and after perfusion and during overnight pH monitoring. By oesophageal manometry, eight patients had normal peristalsis and eight patients had impaired peristalsis. Oesophageal endoscopy was unremarkable in patients with normal peristalsis, whereas all patients with impaired peristalsis had oesophagitis. The time needed to clear the oesophagus of perfused acid was shorter (p < 0. 01) in patients with normal peristalsis and acid clearance time was significantly correlated (p < 0. 01) with acid exposure time during overnight pH monitoring. During and after oesophageal perfusion, the nature, duration, and severity of symptoms did not differ between the groups, but overnight symptoms lasted longer (p < 0. 05) in patients with impaired peristalsis. It is concluded that in PSS: (1) Impaired oesophageal motility delayed the clearance of acid and increased the exposure time to acid. (2) Acid clearance time is a useful parameter of impaired oesophageal motor function. The assessment of acid clearance time can be used as an alternative to overnight pH monitoring, to assess the impairment of <b>oesophageal</b> <b>acid</b> clearance. (3) <b>Oesophageal</b> sensitivity to <b>acid</b> was preserved in patients with impaired peristalsis and oesophagitis. (4) Reflux symptoms lasted longer in patients with prolonged <b>oesophageal</b> <b>acid</b> exposure but were still reported for {{a small fraction of the}} total acid exposure time. Thus, reflux symptoms reflect poorly prolonged exposure of the oesophagus to acid and are not a reliable guide to acid injury of the oesophagus in PSS...|$|R
40|$|The {{relation}} between symptom severity in {{gastro-oesophageal reflux disease}} (GORD) and quantitated <b>oesophageal</b> <b>acid</b> reflux is variable. Furthermore, when <b>oesophageal</b> <b>acid</b> exposure lies within the conventional normal range, {{the cause of the}} symptoms is unknown. This prospective study evaluated 24 hour ambulatory oesophageal pH profiles in relation to objective symptom scores in 100 dyspeptic patients who were free from ulcer and gall stones. Twenty patients had raised <b>oesophageal</b> <b>acid</b> exposure and reflux symptoms consistent with GORD, and 80 had oesophageal pH profiles within the conventional normal range. Forty four of the 80 had severe or moderate reflux symptoms and were classified as having reflux like functional dyspepsia (RFD); 36 had minimal or absent reflux symptoms, and were categorised as having non-reflux dyspepsia (NFD). While oesophageal pH profiles lay within the conventional normal range in both functional dyspepsia subgroups, patients with RFD had consistently greater acid exposure values as follows: mean (SEM) total <b>oesophageal</b> <b>acid</b> exposure time, RFD 16. 2 (2. 56) min v NFD 9. 05 (2. 0) min (p < 0. 03); percentage of time with pH < 4, RFD 1. 4 (0. 2) v NFD 0. 8 (0. 2) (p < 0. 03); DeMeester scores, RFD 12. 8 (0. 5) v NFD 11. 4 (0. 4) (p < 0. 03). The RFD group had a pain/reflux event correlation of 23. 8 (5. 3) % v 8. 1 (3. 7) % for the NFD group (p < 0. 01). This study shows that patients with RFD have <b>oesophageal</b> <b>acid</b> exposure that lies below the diagnostic threshold for GORD, but exceeds that of patients with NFD. The high pain/reflux event correlation in RFD, suggests that subthreshold <b>oesophageal</b> <b>acid</b> exposure may be associated with troublesome reflux symptoms...|$|R
40|$|Using 24 hour pH {{monitoring}} as {{a reference}} standard, {{the usefulness of the}} <b>acid</b> <b>perfusion</b> (AP) <b>test</b> in predicting gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) was assessed in 71 non-cardiac chest pain (NCCP) patients and 23 endoscopic oesophagitis patients. Of the 71 NCCP patients, 35 had a positive AP test (of whom 20 had an abnormal 24 hour pH) and 36 had a negative AP test (of whom 14 had an abnormal 24 hour pH study). Thus, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of the AP test in this group was 59 %, 59 %, 57 %, and 61 %, respectively. The corresponding values in the oesophagitis group were 85 %, 67 %, 94 %, and 40 %. In the NCCP group when heartburn alone was used as the positive criterion the PPV rose to 74 %. When chest pain with or without heartburn was used, however, the PPV dropped to 38 %. A 'symptom index' was used to define the number of chest pain episodes that were caused by acid reflux. Only 48 % of AP test positive patients had demonstrable acid mediated chest pain. In the NCCP population with a normal oesophageal examination (1) AP test reproduction of chest pain is poorly predictive of GORD; (2) AP test reproduction of heartburn is more predictive of GORD but does not ensure that the chest pain is caused by GORD; (3) a negative AP test does not exclude GORD and (4) only 48 % of AP test positive patients have demonstrable acid mediated chest pain. The ambulatory 24 hour pH test may have rendered the AP test obsolete in the assessment of GORD as the cause of NCCP...|$|R
