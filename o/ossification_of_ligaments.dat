The commonly accepted Resnick and Niwayama classification criteria for the spine require flowing osteophytes over four vertebral bodies and in addition the preservation of the intervertebral disc space [74].

40|$|AbstractObjective Vitamin A {{derivatives}} {{are widely}} used therapeutic agents {{for the treatment of}} dermatological and rheumatological disorders. Long-standing administration of these drugs, in turn, causes skeletal changes including <b>ossification</b> <b>of</b> <b>ligaments,</b> premature fusion of epiphyses and abnormalities of modeling. Recent in vitro experiments have further suggested that retinoid treatment of cultured chondrocytes may cause apoptotic cell death. The present study aims to address detailed cartilage changes associated with in vivo administration of vitamin A derivatives. Methods Retinyl acetate was administrated to experimental mice, C 3 H-Heston, for more than 12 months. Modified morphometry on the articular cartilage and fluorescent labeling of the subchondral bone were carried out to address the changes in the articular cartilage and subchondral bone. In order to address the detailed chondrocytes phenotypes, electron microscopy was carried out. Since findings of these studies suggested that biological properties of the cartilage matrix might be altered, the present study also immunolocalized functional matrix molecules, type I collagen and osteoblast-stimulating factor- 1 (OSF- 1). Results Histomorphometry demonstrated that retinoid administration lead to progressive atrophy of the articular cartilage with concomitant proliferation of subchondral bone. Furthermore, detailed light and electron microscopy suggested that the subchondral bone proliferates into the degenerating cartilage. The affected articular cartilage also resembled that of osteoarthritis in terms of ectopic type I collagen production. Furthermore, the affected articular cartilage produced a developmentally regulated matrix molecule, osteoblast-stimulating factor- 1 (OSF- 1) that is normally expressed in both the fetal cartilage and the epiphyseal growth plate cartilage but not in the articular cartilage. Conclusion The present results indicate that the systemic retinoid administration may alter the biological properties of the articular cartilage.

40|$|Introduction: Ectopic <b>ossification</b> <b>of</b> {{the spinal}} <b>ligaments</b> is not {{uncommon}} in patients with Vitamin D-resistant rickets (VDRR), but the long-term consequences of this condition have not been reported. Presentation of case: The case was a 65 -year-old female with VDRR who reported progressive weakness of the upper extremities, difficulty walking, neck pain, and numbness in the left arm. Imaging studies demonstrated cord compression with ectopic ossification at {{the rim of the}} occipital bone and OPLL at C 1 level. Ankylosis of the whole spine below the C 2 vertebra was also noted with preserved mobility only at the craniovertebral junction. Discussion: Our report showed that ectopic <b>ossification</b> <b>of</b> the spinal <b>ligament</b> can result in ankylosis of the entire spine in patients with VDRR. In such patients, the segments with remaining mobility are considered to be at high risk of developing myelopathy due to increased stress at the junction.

40|$|Abstract Introduction A girl {{presented}} with achondroplasia manifested as mild knee pain associated with stiffness of her back. A skeletal survey showed enchondroma-like metaphyseal dysplasia and <b>ossification</b> <b>of</b> the spinal <b>ligaments.</b> Magnetic resonance imaging {{of the spine}} further clarified the pathological composites. Case presentation A 7 -year-old girl {{presented with}} the classical phenotypic features of achondroplasia. Radiographic documentation showed the co-existence of metaphyseal enchondromatosis and development of spinal bony ankylosis. Magnetic resonance imaging showed extensive <b>ossification</b> <b>of</b> the anterior and posterior spinal ligaments. Additional features revealed by magnetic resonance imaging included calcification of the peripheral vertebral bodies associated with anterior end-plate irregularities. Conclusion Enchondromas are metabolically active and may continue to grow and evolve throughout the patient's lifetime; thus, progressive calcification {{over a period of}} years is not unusual. <b>Ossification</b> <b>of</b> the spinal <b>ligaments</b> has a specific site of predilection and often occurs in combination with senile ankylosing vertebral hyperostosis. Nevertheless, <b>ossification</b> <b>of</b> the spinal <b>ligaments</b> has been encountered in children with syndromic malformation complex. It is a multifactorial disease in which complex genetic and environmental factors interact, potentially leading to chronic pressure on the spinal cord and nerve roots with subsequent development of myeloradiculopathy. Our patient presented with a combination of achondroplasia, enchondroma-like metaphyseal dysplasia and calcification <b>of</b> the spinal <b>ligaments.</b> We suggest that the development of heterotopic bone formation along the spinal ligaments had occurred through an abnormal ossified enchondral mechanism. We postulate that <b>ossification</b> <b>of</b> the spinal <b>ligaments</b> and metaphyseal enchondromatous changes are related to each other and represent impaired terminal differentiation of chondrocytes in this particular case. Standard radiographic examination showed spinal bony ankylosis only. The pathological composites of the vertebrae have been clarified using scanning technology. Extensive spinal ligament ossification associated with calcification of the peripheral vertebral bodies and anterior end-plate irregularities were notable. We report what may be a novel spinal and extraspinal malformation complex in a girl with achondroplasia. </p...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE. Using Zucker fatty rats as {{an animal}} model, we {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of ethane- 1 -hydroxy- 1, 1 -diphosphonate on <b>ossification</b> <b>of</b> the posterior longitudinal ligament by histopathologically investigating the prodromal, early, and advanced stages <b>of</b> <b>ossification</b> <b>of</b> the spinal <b>ligaments.</b> METHODS. 73 Zucker fatty rats were allocated to the ethane- 1 -hydroxy- 1, 1 -diphosphonate group (n= 33) and the control group (n= 40). The former group was fed ethane- 1 -hydroxy- 1, 1 -diphosphonate daily. The feed was given starting 2 months after birth and continued until the rats were killed at 3 to 18 months later. Chemical analysis of the blood, radiographic tests, and histopathological examination were then conducted for both groups. RESULTS. The results showed that <b>ossification</b> <b>of</b> the spinal <b>ligaments</b> involved excessive cartilage cell proliferation around areas affected by enthesitis; enlargement of the fibrocartilage tissue layer; <b>ligament</b> thickening; calcification <b>of</b> the matrix around the cartilage cells; and <b>ossification</b> <b>of</b> the spinal <b>ligaments</b> through enchondral ossification. Radiographic examinations showed that osteoproliferation in vertebral bodies in rats receiving ethane- 1 -hydroxy- 1, 1 -diphosphonate was generally suppressed compared with controls, whereas histopathological examinations found no clear difference in cartilage cell proliferation in areas affected by enthesitis between the two groups, indicating the absence of calcification or osteo-proliferation in areas affected by enthesitis for the rats receiving ethane- 1 -hydroxy- 1, 1 -diphosphonate. CONCLUSION. Ethane- 1 -hydroxy- 1, 1 -diphosphonate is effective in suppressing progressive ligament ossification...|$|R

We proceeded to calculate the stress on the supraspinous ligament on the plane model and to discuss causative factors <b>of</b> <b>ossification</b> <b>of</b> the spinal <b>ligaments</b> from the view point of biomechanical factors.

We hypothesized that hyperglycemia, as a typical characteristic of diabetes, is closely associated with <b>ligament</b> hypertrophy in <b>ossification</b> <b>of</b> posterior longitudinal <b>ligament.</b> In this in vitro study, we investigated the effect of high glucose on collagen synthesis and transforming growth factor-β 1 (TGF-β 1) production using cells isolated from rat cervical posterior longitudinal ligament.

The increase was inhibited in the presence of anti-TGF-β 1 antibodies. Production of TGF-β 1 by the cells was also increased significantly by high glucose concentration. Exogenous application of TGF-β 1 was confirmed to increase collagen synthesis of the cells.
