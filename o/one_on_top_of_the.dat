25|$|Shoelaces are {{typically}} tied {{off at the}} top of the shoe using a simple bow knot. Besides securing the shoe, this also takes up the length of shoelace exposed after tightening. The common bow consists of two half-knots tied <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other, with the second half-knot looped in order to allow quick untying. When required, the knot can be readily loosened by pulling one or both of the loose ends.|$|E

Only four of his other 1960s films were released in the U.S.: Massacre Time (as The Brute and the Beast in 1968), The Man Who Killed Billy the Kid (as I'll Kill Him and Return Alone in 1968), Una sull'altra (as <b>One</b> <b>on</b> <b>Top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Other in 1973) and Beatrice Cenci (as Conspiracy of Torture, in 1976).|$|E

Starting in the 1970s SP had cab air conditioning on all new locomotives and the unit is visible on the cab roof. Southern Pacific placed large snowplows on the pilots of their {{road switcher}}s for the heavy snowfall on Donner Pass. Many Southern Pacific road switchers had a Nathan-AirChime model P3 or P5 air horn with chords distinct to Southern Pacific locomotives in the western states.|$|E

25|$|The {{ceremonial}} centers {{were always}} built to be visible. The pyramids {{were meant to}} {{stand out from the}} rest of the city, to represent its gods and their powers. Another characteristic feature of the ceremonial centers is historic layers. All of the ceremonial edifices were built in various phases, <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other, to the point that what we now see is usually the last stage of construction. Ultimately, the ceremonial centers were the architectural translation of the identity of each city, as represented by the veneration of their gods and masters. Stelae were common public monuments throughout Mesoamerica, and served to commemorate notable successes, events and dates associated with the rulers and nobility of the various sites.|$|E
25|$|Building of Boca Juniors' current stadium {{began in}} 1938, under the {{supervision}} of Engineer José L. Delpini. Boca played its home matches in the Ferro Carril Oeste ground in Caballito until it was completed in May 25, 1940. A third level was added in 1953, originating then its nickname La Bombonera ('The Chocolate Box'). The stand opposite the Casa Amarilla railway platforms remained mostly undeveloped until 1996, when it was upgraded with new balconies and quite expensive VIP boxes. Three sides of the Bombonera are thus made up of traditional sloping stadium stands, but the fourth side was built vertically, with several seating areas stacked <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other, the only way that makes it stand into the club premises.|$|E
25|$|People try to {{stay awake}} and eat toshikoshisoba, noodles to be eaten at midnight. People also visit Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines. Traditionally three are visited. This is called sansha-mairi. In the Imperial Palace at dawn on the 1st, the Emperor {{performs}} the rite of shihōhai (worship of the four-quarters), in which he offers prayers {{for the well-being of}} the nation. On January 2 the public is allowed to enter the inner palace grounds; the only other day this is possible is the Emperor's birthday (December 23). On the 2nd and 3rd days acquaintances visit one another to extend greetings (nenshi) and sip otoso (a spiced rice wine). Some games played at New Year's are karuta (a card game), hanetsuki (similar to badminton), tako age (kiteflying), and komamawashi (spinning tops). These games are played to bring more luck for the year. Exchanging New Year's greeting cards (similar to Christmas Cards) is another important Japanese custom. Also special allowances are given to children, which are called otoshidama. They also decorate their entrances with kagami mochi (two mochi rice balls placed <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other, with a tangerine on top), and kadomatsu (pine tree decorations).|$|E

Into the upper part they made two subsidiary rooms, <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other, and another, the topmost room, [...] from the ground, was for the lanterns.

Some of the benches were simply planks put on top of empty nail kegs. There was no elevated platform, as the ceiling was only eight feet high. Initially there was no pulpit. Frank Bartleman, an early participant in the revival, recalled that [...] "Brother Seymour generally sat behind two empty shoe boxes, <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other.

500|$|Busch {{felt his}} {{painting}} skills could {{not compete with}} those of the Dutch masters. He regarded few of his paintings as finished, often stacking them <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other in damp corners of his studio, where they stuck together. If the pile of paintings became too high, he burnt some in his garden. Since only a few remaining pictures are dated, categorizing them is difficult. His doubts regarding his skills are expressed in his choice of materials. His ground was usually chosen carelessly. Sometimes he used uneven cardboard or poorly-prepared spruce-wood boards. One exception is a portrait of Johanna Kessler, on a canvas support measuring [...] by , one of his largest paintings. Most of his works, even landscapes, are small. As Busch used poor grounds and colours, most are heavily darkened and have an almost monochrome effect.|$|E

Evans and Aspinall's duties were to drive the van while on tour, and {{to set up and}} test the equipment. Mal's telephone engineering experience was valuable in setting up and maintaining the electrical equipment. The Beatles were being driven back to Liverpool from London by Evans through heavy fog on 21 January 1963, when the windscreen was hit by a pebble and crazed over, so Evans had to break a large hole in it to see the road ahead. This was in winter, so the group had to lie <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other in the back with a bottle of whisky and try to stay warm in the freezing temperatures; something McCartney later referred to as a [...] "Beatle sandwich".|$|E
500|$|Yui Ehara, {{designer}} of the DS Lite and DSi's original casing, had to redesign the revised case. He advocated changing the six speaker apertures, as their circular perforations were redundant {{to the rest of}} the handheld's interface. He believed that this alteration also signaled a clearer distinction between the DSi and its predecessors while keeping the unit [...] "neat" [...] and [...] "simple". Ehara hoped the DSi's added features would not interfere with his desired iconic image of the Nintendo DS product line: two rectangles, <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other, with each half containing another rectangle inside. This model was publicly revealed at the October 2008 Nintendo Conference in Tokyo, along with its Japanese price and release date. While the DS product line's worldwide yearly sales figures consistently surpassed those of its primary market rival, Sony's PlayStation Portable, demand for it in Japan was decreasing; Nintendo's launch of the DSi was intended to stimulate sales. The company was less concerned with releasing the DSi in other territories, where DS Lite market demand remained high.|$|E

In total, sixteen songs failed to reach number one with Record Retailer but topped the NME chart. In 1969, after the BMRB chart was introduced, four songs topped the NME but not the BMRB chart. Notable discrepancies include [...] "19th Nervous Breakdown" [...] which reached number one on the NME, Disc, and Melody Maker charts, topped the BBC's Pick of the Pops aggregated chart and was announced as number <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>Top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pops; however, because it did not reach number one on the Record Retailer chart it is omitted from the Official Chart Company's canon.
