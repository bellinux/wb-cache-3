40|$|Background: Although closed {{reduction}} and percutaneous pinning is accepted as {{the treatment of}} choice for displaced supracondylar fracture of the humerus, there are some debates on the pinning techniques, period of immobilization, elbow range of motion (ROM) exercise, and perceptions on the restoration of elbow ROM. This {{study was to investigate}} the consensus and different perspectives on the treatment of supracondylar fractures of the humerus in children. Methods: A questionnaire was designed for this study, which included the choice of pinning technique, methods of elbow motion, and perception on the restoration of elbow ROM. Seventy-six <b>orthopedic</b> <b>surgeons</b> {{agreed to participate in the}} study and survey was performed by a direct interview manner in the annual meetings of Korean Pediatric Orthopedic Association and Korean Society for Surgery of the Hand. There were 17 pediatric <b>orthopedic</b> <b>surgeons,</b> 48 hand surgeons, and 11 general <b>orthopedic</b> <b>surgeons.</b> Results: Ninety-six percent of the <b>orthopedic</b> <b>surgeons</b> agreed that closed {{reduction and}} percutaneous pinning was the treatment of choice for the displaced supracondylar fracture of the humerus in children. They showed significant difference in the choice of pin entry (lateral vs. crossed pinning, p = 0. 017) between the three groups of <b>orthopedic</b> <b>surgeons,</b> but no signifi cant difference was found in the number of pins, all favoring 2 pins over 3 pins. Most of the <b>orthopedic</b> <b>surgeons</b> used a removable splint during the ROM exercise period. Hand <b>surgeons</b> and general <b>orthopedic</b> <b>surgeons</b> tended to be more concerned about elbow stiffness after supracondylar fracture than pediatric <b>orthopedic</b> <b>surgeons,</b> and favored gentle passive ROM exercise as elbow motion.

5|$|During the May 21, 2001 {{episode of}} Raw Is War, he {{suffered}} a legitimate and career-threatening injury. In the night's main event, he and Austin were defending the WWF Tag Team Championship against Chris Jericho and Chris Benoit. At one point, Jericho had Austin trapped in the Walls of Jericho and Triple H ran in to break it up, but just as he did, {{he suffered a}} tear in his left quadriceps muscle, causing it to come completely off the bone. Despite his inability to place any weight on his leg, Triple H was able to complete the match. He even allowed Jericho {{to put him in}} the Walls of Jericho, a move that places considerable stress on the quadriceps. The tear required an operation, which was performed by <b>orthopedic</b> <b>surgeon</b> Dr. James Andrews. This injury brought an abrupt end to the McMahon-Helmsley Era, as the rigorous rehabilitation process kept Triple H out of action for over eight months, completely missing The Invasion storyline.|$|E
5|$|Emerging {{technologies}} such as X-rays gave physicians new diagnostic tools, revealing the intervertebral disc {{as a source for}} back pain in some cases. In 1938, <b>orthopedic</b> <b>surgeon</b> Joseph S. Barr reported on cases of disc-related sciatica improved or cured with back surgery. As a result of this work, in the 1940s, the vertebral disc model of low back pain took over, dominating the literature through the 1980s, aiding further by the rise of new imaging {{technologies such}} as CT and MRI. The discussion subsided as research showed disc problems to be a relatively uncommon cause of the pain. Since then, physicians have come to realize that it is unlikely that a specific cause for low back pain can be identified in many cases and question the need to find one at all as most of the time symptoms resolve within 6 to 12 weeks regardless of treatment.|$|E

5|$|During a {{match with}} Mr. Kennedy on the October 1, 2007 episode of Raw, Cena {{suffered}} a legitimate torn pectoral muscle while executing a hip toss. Though finishing the match and {{taking part in}} the scripted attack by Orton after the match, surgery the following day found that his pectoralis major muscle was torn completely from the bone, estimating at the time to require seven months to a year of rehabilitation. As a result, Cena was stripped of the title by Mr. McMahon on the next night's episode of ECW, ending what was the longest WWE Championship reign in over 19 years. Cena's surgery was performed by <b>orthopedic</b> <b>surgeon</b> James Andrews at St. Vincent's Hospital in Birmingham, Alabama. Two weeks later in a video update on WWE.com, Dr. Andrews and Cena's physical trainer both said that he was several weeks ahead of where he was expected to be in his rehabilitation at that time.

40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: To {{determine}} {{the knowledge of}} Brazilian <b>Orthopedic</b> <b>Surgeons</b> on the costs of orthopedic surgical devices used in surgical implants. Methods: A questionnaire was applied to Brazilian <b>Orthopedic</b> <b>Surgeons</b> during the 46 th Brazilian Congress on Orthopedics and Traumatology. Results: Two hundred and one <b>Orthopedic</b> <b>Surgeons</b> completely filled out the questionnaire. The difference between the average prices estimated by the surgeons and the average prices {{provided by the supplier}} companies was 47. 1 %. No {{differences were found between the}} orthopedic specialists and other subspecialties on the prices indicated for specific orthopedic implants. However, differences were found among <b>orthopedic</b> <b>surgeons</b> who received visits from representatives of implant companies and those who did not receive those visits on prices indicated for shaver and radiofrequency device. Correlation was found between length of orthopedic experience and prices indicated for shaver and interference screw, and higher the experience time the lower the price indicated by Surgeons for these materials. Conclusion: The knowledge of Brazilian <b>Orthopedic</b> <b>Surgeons</b> on the costs of orthopedic implants is precarious. Reduction of cost of orthopedics materials depends on a more effective communication and interaction between doctors, hospitals and supplier companies with solid orientation programs and awareness for physicians about their importance in this scenario.

40|$|Introduction: The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} the knowledge levels of <b>orthopedic</b> <b>surgeons</b> working in Turkey about the uses and possible risks of fluoroscopy and assess methods for preventing radiation damage. 				 					Methods: A questionnaire with a total of 12 questions was sent to 1121 <b>orthopedic</b> <b>surgeons</b> working in Turkey. The questionnaire evaluated participants’ knowledge about the uses and risks of fluoroscopy and methods for preventing damage. One thousand and twenty-four <b>orthopedic</b> <b>surgeons</b> were found to be suitable for inclusion in the study. The effects of fluoroscopy on patients were not assessed in our study. 				 					Results: The data obtained were statistically evaluated. Of the surveyed surgeons, 313 (30 %) had used fluoroscopy in over 50 % of their operations. The average number of fluoroscopy shots per case was 54. 5. A lead apron was the most commonly used (88 %) protection from the harmful effects of radiation. Fluoroscopy shots were performed with the help of operating room personnel (86 %). A dosimeter was used 5 % of the time. 				 					Conclusion: According to the survey results, the need for fluoroscopy was very high in orthopedic surgery. However, <b>orthopedic</b> <b>surgeons</b> have inadequate knowledge about the uses and risks of fluoroscopy and methods for preventing damage. Therefore, we believe that training on this topic should be provided to all <b>orthopedic</b> <b>surgeons...</b>|$|R
