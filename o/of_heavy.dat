5|$|One of the {{by-products}} at Rjukan was {{the production}} <b>of</b> <b>heavy</b> water—a key component in nuclear weapons, and {{necessary for the}} Germany designs as a moderator. The hydrogen plant at Vemork was the first mass producer <b>of</b> <b>heavy</b> water, and in 1939 IG Farben, who owned 25% of Norsk Hydro at the time, asked to import five liters <b>of</b> <b>heavy</b> water, but was denied {{due to lack of}} an export license. In 1939–40 production at Vemork was 20 kilograms, by 1942 production had increased to five kilograms per day.|$|E
5|$|The {{properties}} <b>of</b> <b>heavy</b> {{water had}} been discovered in 1932 by Harold Urey. In 1933, Leif Tronstad and Jomar Brun, the head of Norsk Hydro Rjukan, created a plan for industrial production <b>of</b> <b>heavy</b> water in Norway. As Norsk Hydro were already producing ammonia for nitrogen fertilizer, Tronstad and Brun had realized that large amounts of electrolyzed water were available. Tronstad was paid by Norsk Hydro as a consultant. Already in 1934, Norsk Hydro had opened a plant near the power station at Vemork. This was the world's first plant for industrial mass production <b>of</b> <b>heavy</b> water. Both French and German scientists expressed interest in the project.|$|E

5|$|Copper-bearing {{material}} was smelted to produce black copper, containing impurities such as lead, tin and zinc.

5|$|Early 20th-century weight limits were enacted {{to protect}} dirt and gravel roads from {{damage caused by}} the solid wheels <b>of</b> <b>heavy</b> trucks. As time passed, truck weight limits focused {{primarily}} on gross weight limits (which had no prescribed limits on length). By 1974, bridges received special protection from increasing truck weight limits. The bridge formula law was enacted by the U.S. Congress to limit the weight-to-length ratio <b>of</b> <b>heavy</b> trucks, and to protect roads and bridges from {{the damage caused by}} the concentrated weight of shorter trucks. The formula effectively lowers the legal weight limit for shorter trucks, preventing them from causing premature deterioration of bridges and highway infrastructure.|$|E

5|$|Heavy metals can degrade air, water, {{and soil}} quality, and {{subsequently}} cause health issues in plants, animals, and people, {{when they become}} concentrated {{as a result of}} industrial activities. Common sources <b>of</b> <b>heavy</b> metals in this context include mining and industrial wastes; vehicle emissions; lead-acid batteries; fertilisers; paints; and treated timber; aging water supply infrastructure; and microplastics floating in the world's oceans. Recent examples <b>of</b> <b>heavy</b> metal contamination and health risks include the occurrence of Minamata disease, in Japan (1932–1968; lawsuits ongoing as of 2016); the Bento Rodrigues dam disaster in Brazil, and high levels of lead in drinking water supplied to the residents of Flint, Michigan, in the north-east of the United States.|$|E
30|$|The {{processes}} of solution in, and exsolution from, formation water influence the component content {{of natural gas}} by contrasting the relative contents of components before the natural gas dissolves in water and those after exsolving from water under different conditions of high temperatures and pressures. Compared with the composition of original natural gas, the relative content of methane and nitrogen increased after the natural gas dissolved in water. The increase of nitrogen content exceeds that of methane, but the content of ethane, propane, pentane etc reduced. At the same temperature and with pressure increasing the content of methane increased and that <b>of</b> <b>heavier</b> hydrocarbons reduced. At the same pressure the content of methane increased quickly from 90 °C to 120 °C, and the content <b>of</b> <b>heavier</b> hydrocarbons reduced. But at even higher temperatures, the increase of methane slowed down and the content <b>of</b> <b>heavier</b> hydrocarbons increased slightly. At the same temperature and different pressures, heavier hydrocarbons reduced much more with increasing carbon atom number, while with temperature increasing the content difference <b>of</b> <b>heavier</b> hydrocarbons reduced. Therefore, {{the influence of the}} solution and exsolution should be considered {{in the study of the}} migration and accumulation mechanism of natural gas.|$|R
