5|$|Although {{conclusive}} evidence might be wanting either way for whether Hebrew Law allowed for impalement, or just hanging, the Neo-Assyrian method of impalement {{as seen in}} the carvings could, perhaps, equally easily be seen as a form <b>of</b> <b>hanging</b> upon a pole, rather than focusing upon the stake's actual penetration of the body.|$|E
5|$|Although the Act of Parliament {{defining}} {{high treason}} {{remains on the}} United Kingdom's statute books, during {{a long period of}} 19th-century legal reform the sentence <b>of</b> <b>hanging,</b> drawing, and quartering was changed to drawing, hanging until dead, and posthumous beheading and quartering, before being abolished in England in 1870. The death penalty for treason was abolished in 1998.|$|E

The Elz creates a series <b>of</b> <b>hanging</b> valleys which {{challenge}} the passage of large bodies of troops; the rainy weather further complicated the passage through the Elz valley. The area around Riegel am Kaiserstuhl is noted for its loess and narrow transition points, which greatly influenced the battle.|$|E

5|$|From 10 September to 10 October Morrissey {{starred in}} Hangmen by Martin McDonagh, at the Royal Court Theatre.

5|$|In their 2004 {{study of}} lynching, Peter Ehrenhaus and A. Susan Owen compare the lynching to a blood sacrifice, arguing Waco {{residents}} {{felt a sense}} of collective righteousness after Washington's death, as they saw him as the presence of evil in the community. Bernstein compares the public brutality of the lynch mob to the medieval English practice <b>of</b> <b>hanging,</b> drawing, and quartering people convicted of high treason.|$|E

A lead plaque on the nave wall, removed from the tower roof in 1859, has {{a picture of a}} ship from Nelson's time scratched on it. The mill that was recorded in the Domesday Book, Church Mills, was located close to the ford and closed down around 1912.|$|E

5|$|The {{theme of}} cities {{continued}} into 1944 when another batch of four, Nos. 6249–6252, was built without streamlining. The cost of these locomotives averaged £11,664 each. A follow-up batch of three locomotives (Nos. 6253–6255) {{was built in}} 1946 and this batch attracted an inflationary average cost of £15,460 each. The problem <b>of</b> <b>hanging</b> smoke was addressed and smoke deflectors were now incorporated into the design.|$|E
5|$|Harrison Ainsworth, in his 1842 novel Guy Fawkes, {{wrote about}} the local story that the Gunpowder Plot of 1605 was planned by Guy Fawkes and Robert Catesby in Ordsall Hall's Star Chamber. Guy Fawkes is {{supposed}} to have escaped capture by the king's soldiers by way of an underground tunnel from Ordsall Hall to an inn at the cathedral end <b>of</b> <b>Hanging</b> Bridge, at the northern end of present-day Deansgate. There is no firm supporting evidence, but the Radclyffes were prominent Roman Catholics and were acquainted with the Catesby family. The legend is remembered {{in the name of the}} modern road that runs to the east of the hall, Guy Fawkes Street.|$|E
5|$|Murasaki {{became a}} popular subject of {{paintings}} and illustrations highlighting {{her as a}} virtuous woman and poet. She is often shown at her desk in Ishimyama Temple, staring at the moon for inspiration. Tosa Mitsuoki made her the subject <b>of</b> <b>hanging</b> scrolls in the 17th century. The Tale of Genji became a favorite subject of Japanese ukiyo-e artists for centuries with artists such as Hiroshige, Kiyonaga, and Utamaro illustrating various editions of the novel. While early Genji art was considered symbolic of court culture, {{by the middle of}} the Edo period the mass-produced ukiyo-e prints made the illustrations accessible for the samurai classes and commoners.|$|E

5|$|On the east, {{the first}} {{impression}} is all of rock. The long strath of Grisedale runs north-eastward to Ullswater, cutting off a series <b>of</b> <b>hanging</b> valleys which fall from the Helvellyn range. To the south east of Nethermost Pike, below the summit of High Crag, is Ruthwaite Cove. Surrounded by crag on three sides, this corrie contains Hard Tarn, a small pool on a rock shelf. This {{is one of the}} most difficult mountain tarns to locate, and its black algal bed and clear water combine to give the false impression of great depth. Ruthwaite Cove is now the site of Ruthwaite Lodge, a climbing hut. It was formerly the setting for more industrial activity, with the remains of several underground mines and some shallow open workings visible near the Lodge.|$|E
5|$|Passenger staterooms {{have largely}} {{deteriorated}} {{because they were}} framed in perishable softwoods like teak and pine, leaving a warren <b>of</b> <b>hanging</b> electrical wire, light fixtures and debris interspersed with more durable items like brass bed frames, light fixtures, and marble-topped washstands. Woodwork with attachments like doorknobs, drawer-pulls or push-plates survive in better condition {{because of the small}} electric charge emitted by metal which repels fish and other harmful organisms. On the whole hardwoods like mahogany, the material for most stateroom furnishings, is more resistant to decay. Lavatories and bathrooms within the passenger quarters survive because they were framed in steel.|$|E
5|$|After {{the rest}} day, play resumed in poor visibility, with {{frequent}} interruptions due to rain and bad light. England's batsmen progressed steadily as Australia struggled in Lindwall's absence, which forced his fellow bowlers {{to bear a}} greater workload. Hutton made 74 and Compton batted through the entire day to be unbeaten on 154, with England one run ahead {{at the close of}} play, on 345/6. Compton's innings in the difficult conditions was highly praised and his team still had a chance <b>of</b> <b>hanging</b> on for a draw if the lower order could bat for {{a large part of the}} final day. The next day, Australia prised out the remaining wickets and England were dismissed for 441, with Compton out for 184 after falling on his stumps. Miller and Johnston had both taken four wickets. Australia then made the 98 runs required for victory with the loss of two wickets; opener Sid Barnes made his second half-century for the match in the pursuit.|$|E

50|$|The {{mechanism}} of the injury is forcible hyperextension of the head, usually with distraction of the neck. Traditionally this would occur during judicial hanging, when the noose was placed below the condemned subject's chin. When the subject was dropped, the head would be forced into hyperextension by {{the full weight of}} the body, a sufficient force to cause the fracture. However, despite its long association with judicial <b>hangings,</b> one study <b>of</b> a series <b>of</b> such <b>hangings</b> showed that only a small minority <b>of</b> <b>hangings</b> produced a hangman's fracture.|$|R
5|$|Roberts' riding {{style in}} which he forced the motorcycle's rear wheel to break {{traction}} to steer around a corner, essentially riding on paved surfaces {{as if they were}} dirt tracks, changed the way Grand Prix motorcycles were ridden. From 1983 to 1999, every 500cc world championship was won by a rider with a dirt track racing background. Roberts' cornering method <b>of</b> <b>hanging</b> off the motorcycles with his knee extended forced him to use duct tape as knee pads, and eventually led to the introduction of purpose-built knee pucks used by all motorcycle road racers today. His battles with the Grand Prix establishment eventually led to the adoption of stricter safety standards for Grand Prix race organizers. He {{was one of the first}} riders to challenge the FIM over the way they treated competitors and helped improve prize money as well as the professionalism of the sport. It was not until Roberts planned his rival race series in 1980 that the FIM was forced to change the way in which they dealt with motorcycle racers.|$|E
