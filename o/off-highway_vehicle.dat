500|$|The parkway {{begins at}} an {{incomplete}} interchange with I-215 in extreme northern Salt Lake County near the Jordan River <b>Off-Highway</b> <b>Vehicle</b> State Recreation Area. The interchange allows motorists from the Interstate to transfer onto Legacy Parkway and travelers to access I-215 southbound. After about , Legacy Parkway enters Davis County, and heads northerly with two lanes {{in each direction}} through semi-rural Woods Cross. The parkway then turns northeasterly and back north again, meeting 500South at a diamond interchange, which also provides a connection to Redwood Road (SR-68). The eastern border of the Legacy Nature Preserve is formed by the parkway as it travels north. In West Bountiful, the parkway curves to the northeast as it follows the contour of the wetlands which lie {{on the western side}} of the road. Before reverting to its original northerly direction, the route intersects Parrish Lane (SR-105) at another diamond interchange. Past the intersection, Union Pacific and Utah Transit Authority (FrontRunner) railroad tracks run between the parkway and I-15 to the east. For the remainder of the parkway's length, I-15 is located approximately [...] east. Upon entering Farmington, the parkway gains one lane in each direction and terminates at a triple-junction with I-15, SR-225 and U.S. Route89 west of Lagoon.
