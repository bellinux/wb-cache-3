John Hughlings Jackson described {{the function of}} the motor cortex by watching the progression of epileptic seizures through the body. Carl Wernicke described a region associated with language comprehension and production. Korbinian Brodmann divided regions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> based on the appearance of cells. By 1950, Sherrington, Papez, and MacLean had identified many of the brainstem and limbic system functions. The capacity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> to re-organise and change with age, and a recognised critical development period, were attributed to neuroplasticity, pioneered by Margaret Kennard, who experimented on monkeys during the 1930-40s.|$|E
5|$|Research has disproved {{some common}} misconceptions about the brain. These include both {{ancient and modern}} myths.

5|$|The {{blood in}} the deep part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> drains, through a venous plexus into the {{cavernous}} sinus at the front, and the superior and inferior petrosal sinuses at the sides, and the inferior sagittal sinus at the back. Blood drains from the outer brain into the large superior saggital sinus, which rests in the midline on top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain.</b> Blood from here joins with blood from the straight sinus at the confluence of sinuses.|$|E
5|$|The {{cerebrum}} has a contralateral organisation {{with each}} hemisphere <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> interacting primarily with {{one half of}} the body: the left side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> interacts with {{the right side of the}} body, and vice versa. The developmental cause for this is uncertain. Motor connections from the brain to the spinal cord, and sensory connections from the spinal cord to the brain, both cross sides in the brainstem. Visual input follows a more complex rule: the optic nerves from the two eyes come together at a point called the optic chiasm, and half of the fibres from each nerve split off to join the other. The result is that connections from the left half of the retina, in both eyes, go to the left side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain,</b> whereas connections from the right half of the retina go to the right side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain.</b> Because each half of the retina receives light coming from the opposite half of the visual field, the functional consequence is that visual input from the left side of the world goes to the right side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain,</b> and vice versa. Thus, the right side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> receives somatosensory input from the left side of the body, and visual input from the left side of the visual field.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} type (60%) of {{seizures}} are convulsive. Of these, one-third begin as generalized seizures from the start, affecting both hemispheres <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain.</b> Two-thirds begin as focal seizures (which affect one hemisphere <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain)</b> which may then progress to generalized seizures. The remaining 40% of seizures are non-convulsive. An example of this type is the absence seizure, which presents as a decreased level of consciousness and usually lasts about 10 seconds.|$|E
5|$|The {{study of}} the anatomy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> is neuroanatomy, while the study of its {{function}} is neuroscience. A number of techniques are used to study the brain. Specimens from other animals, which may be examined microscopically, have traditionally provided much information. Medical imaging technologies such as functional neuroimaging, and electroencephalography (EEG) recordings are important in studying the brain. The medical history of people with brain injury has provided insight into the function of each part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain.</b>|$|E

5|$|The veins <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain,</b> {{both the}} {{superficial}} veins {{and the deep}} venous system, empty into the dural venous sinuses, which carry blood back to the jugular vein and thence to the heart. In cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, blood clots usually form both in the veins <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> and the venous sinuses. The thrombosis of the veins themselves causes venous infarction—damage to brain tissue due to a congested and therefore insufficient blood supply. This results in cerebral edema (both vasogenic and cytotoxic edema), and leads to small petechial haemorrhages that may merge into large haematomas. Thrombosis of the sinuses is the main mechanism behind the increase in intracranial pressure due to decreased resorption of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The condition {{does not lead to}} hydrocephalus, however, because there is no difference in pressure between various parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{sample of}} CSF {{can be taken}} via lumbar puncture.
