25|$|The way {{in which}} the beam profile of a laser beam changes as it propagates is {{determined}} by diffraction. When the entire emitted beam has a planar, spatially coherent wave front, it approximates Gaussian beam profile and has the lowest divergence for a given diameter. The smaller the <b>output</b> <b>beam,</b> the quicker it diverges. It is possible to reduce the divergence of a laser beam by first expanding it with one convex lens, and then collimating it with a second convex lens whose focal point is coincident with that of the first lens. The resulting beam has a larger diameter, and hence a lower divergence.|$|E
25|$|Their {{principal}} {{feature is}} the ability to remotely control the movement and characteristics of the <b>output</b> <b>beam</b> of light. This is achieved by either moving a mirror which reflects the beam, or by moving the entire fixture, which can pan and tilt by means of a motorized yoke. Usually they also contain other controls to shape, texture and color the light, such as gobo or dichroic wheels. This ability to precisely, and repeatedly set the position of the fixture allows one light to perform many functions, lighting multiple different areas in different ways. They can also move 'live' (with the lamp on), to achieve many of the effects used in modern productions.|$|E

2500|$|IR-visible sum {{frequency}} generation spectroscopy uses two laser beams that spatially and temporally overlap at a {{surface of a}} material or the interface between two media.

In the case of broadband spectrometers, one laser (typically the visible laser) is kept at a fixed narrow wavelength, and the other laser produces a spectrally broad beam. These laser beams again overlap at the interface being studied, but can cover a wider range of resonances at once than a spectrometer operating in scanning mode and hence spectra can be acquired much faster, allowing the ability to perform time-resolved measurements with interfacial sensitivity [...]|$|E
