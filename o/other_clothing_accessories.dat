50|$|Traditionally, bead {{embroidery}} {{has been}} used on clothing and decorative textiles. It {{may be used in}} jewelry with the addition of structural supports such as bracelet bands. <b>Other</b> <b>clothing</b> <b>accessories</b> such as belt buckles and handbags can be embroidered with beads, and household items such as pillows or boxes may be embellished with bead embroidery. When used with hard surfaces, bead patterns are measured and planned with seam allowances and attached after embroidery by means of glue or epoxy.|$|E
50|$|Vegetable tanning uses tannins (a {{class of}} {{polyphenol}} astringent chemicals), which occur naturally in the bark and leaves of many plants. Tannins bind to the collagen proteins in the hide and coat them, {{causing them to}} become less water-soluble and more resistant to bacterial attack. The process also causes the hide to become more flexible. The primary barks processed in bark mills and used in modern times are chestnut, oak, redoul, tanoak, hemlock, quebracho, mangrove, wattle (acacia; see catechol), and myrobalans from Terminalia spp., such as Terminalia chebula. Hides are stretched on frames and immersed for several weeks in vats of increasing concentrations of tannin. Vegetable-tanned hide is not very flexible and is used for luggage, furniture, footwear, belts, and <b>other</b> <b>clothing</b> <b>accessories.</b>|$|E

50|$|In {{the late}} '90s, the company {{changed its name}} to Anchor Blue because they had marketed, distributed, and sold their own line of jeans (for both men and women) and <b>other</b> <b>clothing</b> and <b>accessories</b> in their stores but wanted the chain's name to reflect their own name brand. Up until that time, Miller's Outpost (and {{subsequently}} Anchor Blue Clothing Company) were also selling brand names from some of their competitors in the apparel industry. Levi's, Menace, Mecca, and other name brands were also sold but later dropped when Anchor Blue decided to exclusively sell its own Anchor Blue fashion line. During the years that it was known as Miller's Outpost, the retail chain marketed and sold their own urbanwear line, Steel Wing, and their own activewear line.

In 2016, PETA Asia Pacific shocked customers with a fake pop-up shop in Bangkok called The Leather Work, which seemed to specialize in [...] "luxury" [...] leather bags, shoes, and <b>other</b> <b>clothing</b> and <b>accessories.</b> Inside the items, though, were {{what appeared to be}} the gory flesh, sinews, beating hearts, and blood of animals slaughtered for such items. According to the Asian Correspondent, the stunt caused shoppers to jump back and gasp in horror. PETA claims [...] "to have found workers in crocodile farms 'sawing open reptile's necks while the animals are still alive'" [...] and that [...] "snakes and lizards are cruelly 'nailed to trees' or 'decapitated' before being 'skinned alive.'" ...|$|R
5000|$|As a textile, lacebark is {{soft and}} may be readily dyed or stained. In 1883, the French naturalist Félix-Archimède Pouchet wrote that lacebark was [...] "as fine as our muslin and even takes {{its place in the}} toilet of our ladies". Veils, shawls, dresses, aprons, caps, collars, frills, slippers, purses, and <b>other</b> <b>clothing</b> and <b>accessories</b> have been made of the fiber, mainly in the period from the late 17th to the late 19th centuries. There is {{evidence}} that it was routinely used in clothing worn by people from all ranks of society in Jamaica. The survival of a number of objects that are well over a hundred years old testifies to lacebark's durability as a material. Collections with lacebark items include the Pitt Rivers Museum and Victoria and Albert Museum (U.K.), the Field Museum (U.S.), the Museum of Vancouver (Canada), and the Institute of Jamaica in Kingston. At least two monarchs of Great Britain have been given lacebark clothing: King Charles II, who received a cravat and ruffles of lacebark from Sir Thomas Lynch, then governor of Jamaica, and Queen Victoria, who was presented with a lacebark dress at the 1851 Great Exhibition.|$|R
50|$|Ethical vegans avoid {{clothing}} that incorporates silk, wool (including lambswool, shearling, cashmere, angora, mohair, {{and a number}} of other fine wools), fur, feathers, pearls, animal-derived dyes, or leather, snakeskin, or any other kind of skin or animal product. Most leather clothing is made from cows' and calves' skins, but the skin of sheep, goats, horses and pigs is also used. Less common skins include those from kangaroos, elephants, zebras, seals, crocodile and deer. Vegans regard the purchase of leather, particularly from cows, as financial support for the meat industry. Ethical vegans wear shoes, belts, jackets, handbags and <b>other</b> <b>clothing</b> items and <b>accessories</b> made of non-animal-derived materials, such as hemp, linen, cotton, canvas, polyester, synthetic leather (pleather), rubber, or vinyl. Ethical silk alternatives include bamboo and viscose. Leather alternatives can come from materials such as cork, piña (from pineapples), and mushroom leather.|$|R

40|$|In today’s world, fashion {{designers}} help create billions of dresses, suits, shoes, and <b>other</b> <b>clothing</b> and <b>accessories</b> purchased every year by customers around the world. They study fashion trends, sketch designs of <b>clothing</b> and <b>accessories,</b> select colors and fabrics, and oversee the final production of their designs. With {{the advent of}} computers and low storage costs, designers rely {{on the use of}} mass computer storage to help them store and manage their designs for future retrievals. The stored designs will be retrieved from time to time so that designers could retrieve them for stimulation of new ideas in their new designs. When the number of stored images grows, searching for a desired piece of design work is likely to be time- consuming and painstaking. Without proper computer-assisted search mechanism, such a search will not be definitely easy. Thus, a huge collection of images containing different designs pattern and textures of certain fashion designs demands for efficient search system. Of all the visual contents identifiable from a design, texture is considered to be the commonest visual attribute that aids in image retrieval. Common approaches for texture-based image retrievals are largely centered around frequency-based models, which are notably suffered from the problem of poor retrieval accuracy. In this paper, a novel approach for texture-based image retrieval has been proposed. This approach, known as Spectral Density Analysis, or SDA for short, is based on the idea of dividing an image into nine equally sized partitions where the spectral density of each partition is computed to be used to aid in the image retrieval process. Benchmarked using the popular performance measurement technique, Recall and Precision, adopting the SDA technique for retrieving images based on their texture contents has produced remarkable retrieval accuracy, almost three times more accurate over any other frequency -based models...|$|R
