40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} for the {{sampling and analysis}} of <b>o-tolidine</b> (119937), based on a method successfully used for benzidine (92875). Air is drawn through a two stage sampler consisting of a high efficiency fiber filter and a silica gel bed which collects o- tolidine and its salts. The filter and sorbent sections of the sampler are transferred to stoppered tubes and the <b>o-tolidine</b> is desorbed. A triethylamine/methyl-alcohol solution is injected into a high pressure liquid chromatograph. Peak readings are obtained and compared with a standard calibration curve. This method can detect 0. 15 to 6. 5 micrograms of benzidine per sample (3 to 130 micrograms per cubic meter for a 50 liter air sample) using 0. 5 milliliters of desorbing solution and a 10 microliter injection into the liquid chromatograph. The authors suggest that the range of detection for <b>o-tolidine</b> should be similar to that for benzidine.

40|$|The {{identification}} of M. tuberculosis depends {{primarily on the}} niacin production test. Runyon and others (1959) described a method based on the observations of Konno (1956) using aniline as the reagent.

Tumors developed in 60 - 78 % of the rats, mainly in the skin and its related structures, that is, in the large sebaceous glands (Zymbal's and preputial) and mam-mary glands. Biochemical studies showed that subcutaneously administered OT accumulated chieRy in Zymbal's gland, which probably explains the induction of tumors in this organ. Subcutaneous implantation of pellets of OT caused subcutaneous sarcomas in 2 of 68 rats and hepatocellular carcinomas in 4. This erfect was not observed when OT was administered as an oil suspension. These experiments showed that OT is an active car-cinogenic agent with a resorptive erfect.

40|$|A {{method was}} {{developed}} to determine in urine microgram quantities of hemoglobin, based {{on its ability to}} catalyze peroxide oxidation of <b>o-tolidine.</b> It was recognized that urine contains potent inhibitors to the reaction. These inhibitors are of two classes: 1. high molecular weight (non-dialyzable) and 2. low molecular weight. The latter group contains substances such as uric acid and ascorbic acid. In order to measure micro amounts of hemoglobin in urine, it is necessary to separate it from some of the inhibitors by gel filtration through, Sephadex G. 50 -Some of the peroxidase-like activity is lost during the gel filtration unless haptoglobin is added to the urine before filtration. This is a loss in activity but not in protein.

If you are the author or principal advisor of this work and would like to request open access for it, please contact us at open-help@bu. edu. Thank you. In any forensic investigation {{it is important to consider}} sample preservation. Oftentimes trace quantities of biological materials are found at crime scenes. The usual practice among forensic analysts is to take one sample of a suspected biological stain for presumptive testing, another for confirmatory testing and if both these results are positive, take a third portion for DNA analysis. This works well when sufficient sample is available, however, when trace quantities of sample are present at crime scenes, sample preservation becomes of importance. Thus, this study attempts to develop a procedure where presumptive, confirmatory and DNA analysis could be carried out on a single portion of the sample. In this study four different presumptive reagents – phenolphthalein, <b>o-tolidine,</b> 3, 3 ’, 5, 5 ’- tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) and luminol – were used and their effects on the ABAcard® Hematrace® immunochromatographic membrane test and subsequent DNA analysis were studied. In order to develop the method for one-sample analysis, the lowest volume of blood that gave sufficient quantity of DNA was determined by extracting different volumes (20, 10, 5, 2. 5 and 1. 25 μL) of whole blood. Additionally, different volumes of blood mixed with ABAcard® Hematrace® buffer were extracted. From this preliminary work it was determined that 1. 25 μL of whole blood yielded sufficient DNA quantity even when mixed with the ABAcard® Hematrace® buffer. Bloodstains of 1. 25 μL were then prepared and the one-sample analysis was carried out. The method developed was most successful when luminol was used as the presumptive reagent. For the bloodstains treated with the other three presumptive reagents (phenolphthalein, <b>o-tolidine</b> and TMB), a decrease in DNA yield was detected. This decrease was attributed to the inability of the Qiagen® QIAmp® column to adsorb the DNA after exposure to the chemical reagents and to the insolubility of the bloodstain in ABAcard® Hematrace® buffer following the addition of presumptive blood test reagents. Extraction of DNA from the ABAcard® Hematrace® immunochromatographic membrane was also carried out using the Qiagen® QIAmp® DNA investigator kit; no DNA was obtained from the membranes on which 150 μL of a dilute blood sample had been applied. This suggests that either the extraction method used was not capable of extracting the minute quantities of DNA that might be present on the membrane or there were insufficient white blood cells deposited on the membrane during the testing process. Thus, a one-sample procedure was successfully developed for bloodstains treated with luminol. A loss/reduction of DNA was observed for the samples previously exposed to phenolphthalein, <b>o-tolidine</b> and TMB due to the incapability of the reagents to work with silicon-based extraction chemistries. Further experimentation is needed to develop a similar procedure to be used with such presumptive testing reagents. Alternatively, a procedure can be developed that utilizes two samples: one for presumptive testing and another for confirmatory and subsequent DNA analysis, since it was observed that only the presumptive reagents, and not the ABAcard® Hematrace® buffer, interfered with DNA analysis. 2031 - 01 - 0...|$|E

Three lots of water were used for comparative tests: 1. Chlorine-free distilled water. 2. Chlorine-contaminated distilled water, containing approxi-mately 1. 0 part per million free chlorine. 3. Chlorine water prepared by bubbling chlorine gas into distilled water, then adjusted by dilution to approximately 100 p. p. m. of free chlorine. This was used to accentuate any slight effect of chlorine. These three lots of water were used in the preparation of dilute working standards or for the initial dilution of specimens. Unles...|$|E
40|$|A simple, accurate, {{automated}} {{method for}} {{the determination of}} glucose in plasma, urine, and spinal fluid, which does not require dialysis or protein-free filtrates is presented. Only unusually high uric acid levels in the plasma interfere with tile procedure described. THE DETERMINATION of glucose by the glucose oxidase-peroxidase system has been simplified by Hill and Kessler (2) {{with the use of}} an automated system first described by Skeggs (1). Wincy and Marks (3) have also developed a method using <b>o-tolidine</b> in the automated system. These procedures require a large quantity of sample and use of a dialyzer to separate the protein before color development. The direct micro glucose oxidase manual method developed by Kingsley and Getchell (4) for the determination of glucose in plasma without protein removal or dialysis has been adapted for use with the present AutoAnalyzer equipment. * In all of the methods aboe, glucose oxidase promotes the oxidation of glucose by molecular oxgen to gluconic acid and hydrogen perox-ide. The hydrogen peroxide formed is used to oxidize o-dianisidine to an amber color in the presence of peroxidase (Fig. 1). The o-dianisi-dine dye has been combined with the enzyme mixture to give only one reagent to mix with the plasma as it passes through the automated system. Several drops of Tween 20 are added to the reaction mixtur...|$|E
40|$|A {{quantitative}} assessment {{was performed to}} estimate the cancer risk to individuals wearing garment and footwear coloured with azo dyes. Basically, the risk assessment consists of both {{a comparison of the}} (estimated) level of aromatic amines which, during the wearing of garment and footwear, enters the body, and the acceptable limits as set for the chronic exposure to these amines. The following aspects were taken into account in the risk assessment: 1) the chance that garments and footwear contain azo dyes and amines, 2) the frequency with which garment and footwear is worn, 3) the fraction of garment and footwear which comes into contact with the skin, 4) the level of amines in garment and footwear, 5) the leaching of azo dyes and amines from garment and footwear with sweat, 6) the absorption of azo dyes and amines through the skin and 7) the acceptable limits set for the chronic exposure to aromatic amines. The "Negligible Risk Level" (NRL), lifelong exposure leading to one extra case of cancer in one million exposed persons and the "Maximal Permissible Risk Level (MPRL) ", lifelong exposure leading to one extra case of cancer in 10, 000 exposed persons) were taken for these last limits. In a quantitative risk assessment performed for 6 garment pieces, 2 pieces of textile footwear and 2 pieces of leather footwear, benzidine, <b>o-tolidine,</b> o-dianisidine and 2, 4 -toluenedimine were detected in all the samples. In all cases wearing garments and footwear containing these products led to an exposure of amines exceeding the NRL. The calculated exposure even exceeded the MPRL in three garment pieces...|$|E
40|$|Basidiomycetous fungi, Ganoderma lucidum MDU- 7 and Ganoderma sp. kk- 02 {{secreted}} multiple laccase isozymes under diverse growth condition. Aromatic {{compounds and}} metal salts {{were also found}} to regulate the differential expression of laccase isozymes from both the Ganoderma sp. Laccase isozymes induced {{in the presence of}} copper from G. lucidum MDU- 7 were purified by gel-based (native-PAGE) purification method. The purity of laccase isozymes was checked by zymogram and SDS-PAGE. The SDS-PAGE of purified proteins confirmed the multimeric nature of laccase isozymes. The molecular mass of isozymes was found to be in the range of 40 – 66 kDa. Further, the purified laccase isozymes and their peptides were confirmed with the help of MALDI-TOF peptide fingerprinting. The biochemical characterization of laccase isozymes viz. Glac L 2, Glac L 3, Glac L 4, and Glac L 5 have shown the optimum temperature in the range of 30 °– 45 °C and pH 3. 0. The Km values of all the laccase isozymes determined for guaiacol were (96 – 281 μM), ABTS (15 – 83 μM) and <b>O-tolidine</b> (78 – 724 μM). Further, laccase isozymes from G. lucidum whole genome were studied using bioinformatics tools. The molecular modeling and docking of laccase isozymes with different substrates showed a significant binding affinity, which further validates our experimental results. Interestingly, copper induced laccase of 40 U/ml in culture medium was found to significantly induce cotton callogenesis. Interestingly, all the laccase isozymes were found to have an antioxidative role and therefore capable in free radicals scavenging during callogenesis. This is the first detailed study on the biochemical characterization of all the laccase isozymes purified by a gel-based novel method...|$|E
40|$|A new {{conjugated}} aromatic poly (azomethine) {{has been}} prepared by polycondensation of <b>o-Tolidine,</b> 4 -Aminophenyl disulfide and 2 -Aminophenyl disulfide with terephthaldehyde. Methods and techniques used for {{characterization of the}} polymers included powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and FT-IR and Van der Pauw conductivity measurements. The crystallinity of the polymers was studied by XRD. The polymers were doped with 5 % I 2 and mixed with HCl or H 2 SO 4, and their conductivities were determined by the Van der Pauw technique. A comparative study of the electrical conductivities of polyazomethines and those of their corresponding polymers was performed. Certain diimine and diimine metal complexes have been of interest to chemists due to their broad chemical and biochemical applications. There has been a vital engagement in the chemistry of compounds containing O, N; O, S; N, N; N, S and S, S donor atoms owing to the industrial, antitumor, antiviral and antimalarial activity of the complexes derived from them. The disulfide group is well recognized as a potential binding site for metal ions in biological systems due to the high affinity to attract heavy metals. Lately, investigations have been focused towards an understanding of reactions of metals with ligands containing the disulfide group. We have succeeded in the synthesis of nine complexes that {{have been shown to}} be conductive. All the polymers present amorphous behavior in XRD. Most of the iii polyazomethine known has a lower solubility, which we confirmed for all the polymers. Thermal gravimetric analysis and FT-IR were studied to prove that polymers syntheses. Electrical conductivity measurements were performed by using Van der Pauw technique and the conductivity after doping was enhanced from 10 - 12 to 10 - 4 S cm- 1...|$|E
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{addresses the}} understudied {{area of the}} research and development of hydrogen bonded metal-organic complexes featuring the alkaline earth metals magnesium and calcium. This work presents the crystal structures and thermal behaviour of a series of metal-organic and organic crystalline complexes synthesised from metal salts and pyridine carboxylic, dicarboxylic acid and chloranilic acid ligands, characterised primarily by X-ray diffraction. Chapter 1 introduces crystal engineering, intermolecular interactions, and functional crystalline materials, followed by a literature review addressing metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), hydrogen bonded metal-organic complexes, magnesium MOFs and alkaline earth metal complexes synthesised from pyridine carboxylic, dicarboxylic and tricarboxylic acid and chloranilic acid. Chapter 2 outlines the theory of the techniques used to analyse the synthesised materials, focusing on single crystal X-ray diffraction, followed by Chapter 3 which documents the sample preparation and the experimental details. Chapter 4 describes the crystal structures of fourteen coordination complexes synthesised from magnesium and calcium salts and the three isomers of pyridine carboxylic acid. This work was carried out in order to identify structural trends such as the most common coordination geometries of the metal centres, {{the ways in which the}} ligands coordinate and any recurring hydrogen bonding motifs. Chapter 5 discusses attempts to synthesise an alkaline earth metal analogue of a metal-containing ‘metalloligand’ of the formula M(C 7 H 4 NO 4) 2 (H 2 O) 2, in which the metal (M) is N,O-chelated by pyridine- 2 -carboxylate- 4 -carboxylic acid, and the subsequent combination of these materials with the diamines <b>o-tolidine</b> and m-xylylenediamine. This chapter also reports the structure of a magnesium coordination complex resulting from a hydrothermal reaction, and the subsequent transformation of this complex to a new crystal structure which contains the doubly deprotonated magnesium analogue of the originally targeted ‘metalloligand’. Chapter 6 describes the crystal structures of three complexes synthesised from pyridine carboxylic acids and chloranilic acid, and the complex resulting from the combination of one of these organic ‘supramolecular ligands’ with a copper salt. Finally, two new calcium-chloranilate coordination polymers are reported, one of which has an interesting anionic 3 D structure...|$|E
