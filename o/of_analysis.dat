5|$|A phylogenetic {{analysis}} of various eastern Asian and eastern North American disjunct Suillus species revealed that S.sibiricus forms a well-supported clade with S.americanus and S.umbonatus; these relationships are corroborated by a previous analysis (1996), which used a larger sampling of Suillus species to determine taxonomic {{relationships in the}} genus. Within this clade, S.umbonatus and U.S. S.sibiricus can {{be separated from the}} rest of the group. However, the phylogenetic relationships among the tested isolates determined from different methods <b>of</b> <b>analysis</b> are not always consistent and could not be established with confidence. In general, there is little phylogenetic divergence detected in this clade.|$|E

5|$|Fields {{serve as}} {{foundational}} notions in several mathematical domains. This includes different branches <b>of</b> <b>analysis,</b> {{which are based}} on fields with additional structure. Basic theorems in analysis hinge on the structural properties of the field of real numbers. Most importantly for algebraic purposes, any field may be used as the scalars for a vector space, which is the standard general context for linear algebra. Number fields, the siblings of the field of rational numbers, are studied in depth in number theory. Function fields can help describe properties of geometric objects.|$|E

Historians and commentators conclude that Rommel remains an ambiguous figure, not easily definable either inside or outside the myth.|$|E
