5|$|Although both Pi Vell and Pi Jove are officially protected, {{they are}} easily {{accessible}} {{in an isolated}} wooded area, and therefore vulnerable to vandalism as well as natural hazards such as lightning and wildfire.

5|$|Supporters of {{evolution}} have argued in response that no scientist's claims {{are treated as}} sacrosanct, {{as shown by the}} aspects of Darwin's theory that have been rejected or revised by scientists <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> form first neo-Darwinism and later the modern evolutionary synthesis. The claim that evolution relies on faith is likewise rejected on the grounds that evolution has strong supporting evidence, and therefore does not require faith.|$|E
5|$|A {{report by}} an amateur radio {{operator}} {{who claimed to}} have received a faint SOS signal from Star Dust initially raised hopes that there might have been survivors, but all subsequent attempts <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> find the vanished flight failed. In the absence of any hard evidence, numerous theories arose —including rumours of sabotage (compounded by the later disappearance of two other aircraft also belonging to British South American Airways); speculation that the flight might have been blown up to destroy diplomatic documents being carried by passenger Paul Simpson; or even the suggestion that Star Dust might have been taken or destroyed by a UFO (an idea fuelled by unresolved questions about the flight's final Morse code message).|$|E

5|$|Amarillo has no {{passenger}} rail service but remains {{an important part}} of the rail freight system. The BNSF Railway complex in Amarillo continues to serve a heavy daily traffic load, approximately 100–110 trains per day. The Union Pacific Railroad also sends substantial shipments to or through Amarillo. In addition to intermodal and general goods, a big portion of rail shipments involve grains and coal. There have been various proposals <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> add passenger service. One, the Caprock Chief, would have seen daily service as part of a Fort Worth, Texas—Denver, Colorado service, but it failed to gain traction.|$|E
5|$|Davies's Merthyr {{constituency}} {{included the}} mining village of Aberfan, situated {{a few miles}} south of Merthyr Tydfil. On the mountainsides above the village, colliery waste had been dumped <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> form large spoil tips. Shortly after 9:00 am on Friday 21 October 1966 one of these tips collapsed, sending {{thousands of tons of}} semi-liquid waste hurtling towards Aberfan. The point of impact was Pantglas Junior School, where morning lessons were beginning. The school was half buried; inside, 109 children and 5 teachers were killed. A further 7 children and 23 adults lost their lives outside the school, in the streets or adjoining houses. In the immediate aftermath, Davies visited and consoled the bereaved families in Aberfan, and the following day he led a party which included the Duke of Edinburgh {{on a tour of the}} disaster site.|$|E
5|$|In 1552 Mercator {{moved from}} Leuven to Duisburg in the Duchy of Cleves. He never gave {{his reasons for}} the move but several factors may have been involved: not having been born in Brabant he could never be a full citizen of Leuven; Catholic {{intolerance}} of religious dissidents in the Low Countries was becoming ever more aggressive and a man suspected of heresy once would never be trusted; the Erasmian constitution and the religious tolerance of Cleves must have appeared attractive; {{there was to be}} a new university in Duisburg and teachers would be required. He was not alone; <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> come many more would flee from the oppressive Catholicism of Brabant and Flanders to tolerant cities such as Duisburg.|$|E

5|$|In {{conjunction}} with the Office of Mission and Ministry, Global Outreach (GO!) operates as a cultural immersion and service program where students learn about various issues of social, economic, political, and environmental injustice while living a simple lifestyle that fosters communal and spiritual growth. Teams consist of approximately 10 students, one student leader, and one chaperone to live, work, and learn with partnering organizations. Building on the Jesuit tenets of Men and Women for Others, Magis, and Contemplatives in Action, GO! has grown <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> include more than 30 projects throughout the United States and countries in Asia, Africa, Europe, and Latin America. GO!'s roots stretch back to the 1950s, when Fordham students were participating in various service and immersion projects.

5|$|The Reed & Smith group (which {{acquired}} New Taplow Mill in 1950) {{became one}} of the biggest papermakers in the UK. A Fourdrinier machine was installed in 1892 and continued to make paper at Higher Kings until about 1972. A new machine was built in 1956 to make blue sugar bags and other products, and has been modified <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> make different grades of paper and card. St Regis acquired Higher Kings in the early 1980s and since then the mill has diversified into making a wide range of recycled coloured papers and boards.

5|$|The {{base of the}} Conn Smythe Trophy {{has been}} {{expanded}} twice <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> accommodate more winners. Although the 16 nameplates on the original base tier were filled up after , a new tier was not added until the 1983-84 season. Following the 2000 Stanley Cup Finals, the 20 nameplates on the new tier were filled up, so the first nine winners' nameplates were moved up to the remaining three sides of the foundation tier, with the remaining nameplates shifted accordingly to keep the winners in chronological order. Due to the cancellation of the 2004-05 season, the trophy wasn't filled up again until , after which a new tier was added, making room for 24 more names.|$|E
5|$|The town of Siliguri, {{the start}} of the railway route, was {{connected}} with Calcutta (now Kolkata) via railway in 1878, while the additional journey to Darjeeling required the use of tongas (horse-driven carts) along a dust track. On the recommendations of a committee appointed by Sir Ashley Eden, work on the railroad began in 1879 and was completed by July 1881. The line underwent several improvements such as making gradients more gradual <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> increase manoeuvrability. By 1909–1910, the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway was carrying roughly 174,000 passengers and 47,000 tons of goods annually.|$|E

5|$|When the US Highway System {{was formed}} on November 11, 1926, US141 ran from Milwaukee to Green Bay, and one {{segment of the}} modern highway in Michigan was {{originally}} designated US102. This other designation was decommissioned in 1928 when US141 was extended north from Green Bay into Michigan. Michigan has rebuilt the highway in stages <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> smooth out sharp curves in the routing. Since the 1960s, the section south of Green Bay has {{been converted into a}} freeway in segments. US141 has ended southeast of Green Bay in Bellevue since the 1980s—the southern freeway segment was redesignated as I-43. The section north of Abrams, Wisconsin, was converted to a freeway in the opening years of the 21st century, with an additional divided-highway section opening a few years later.|$|E
