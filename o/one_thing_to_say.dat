5|$|It is <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that a bird has a {{property}} right in its nest, {{or that a}} wolf has {{a property}} right in its den – specific bits of territory used exclusively by one animal family. But the habitat that animals need to survive extends far beyond such specific and exclusive bits of territory – animals often need to fly or roam over vast territories shared by many other animals. Protecting a bird’s nest is of little help if the nearby watering holes are polluted, or if tall buildings block its flight path. It’s not clear how ideas of property rights can help here.|$|E
25|$|Speaking {{before the}} opening of the Ordinary Synod of Bishops on the Family in October 2015, McAleese {{ridiculed}} the concept of 300 elderly celibates coming together to discuss family questions. Addressing a meeting of the Global Network of Rainbow (LGBT) Catholics {{on the eve of the}} Vatican’s Synod on the Family, former president McAleese said: “In the days when I was president, we had workshops on various issues and if I wanted to look at an issue, I would consult the experts... But look at the Synod, I have to ask the question: If I wanted expertise on the family, I honestly cannot say that the first thing that would come into my mind would be to call together 300 celibate males who, as far we know, have never raised a child...“Let me repeat a question I asked last year when I saw the Vatican’s lengthy pre-Synod questionnaire, namely how many of these men have ever changed a child’s nappy? For me that is a very important question because it is <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that we all grew up in families, we had mothers, we had fathers but it is a very different thing to raise a gay child, a very different thing to live daily in a relationship and to police the relationships between children and the world.” Acknowledging that the Synod will doubtless be considering the Catholic Church's pastoral approach to homosexuals, McAleese described herself as “cynical” about the outcome of the forthcoming three week consultation.|$|E
2500|$|Hernán Rivera Letelier, a {{well known}} Chilean writer and former miner, {{wrote an article}} for the Spanish {{newspaper}} El País offering advice to the miners: [...] "I hope that the avalanche of lights and cameras and flashes that is rushing towards you is a light one. It's true that you've survived a long season in hell, but, when all's said and done, it was a hell you knew. What's heading your way, now, comrades, is a hell that you have not experienced at all: the hell of the show, the alienating hell of TV sets. I've only got <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> to you, my friends: grab hold of your family. Don't let them go, don't let them out of your sight, don't waste them. Hold on to them as you hung on to the capsule that brought you out. It's {{the only way to}} survive this media deluge that's raining down on you." ...|$|E

60|$|Speaking of {{ceiling with}} cedar, I have <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> more <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> We Americans {{have a country}} abounding in {{beautiful}} timber, of whose beauties we know nothing, {{on account of the}} pernicious and stupid habit of covering it with white paint.|$|R

2500|$|The {{historian}} Steven Kale discounts {{the entire}} theory that Madame Geoffrin (and salonnières in general) {{played a significant}} role in the Enlightenment. Kale examines the differences in the roles of men and women in the public sphere before and after 1789. He states, [...] "There is no reason to contradict the widely held view that the salon was a feminist space insofar as it was more often than not presided over by a woman who gave it tone and structure." [...] However, he states, [...] "But it is <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that the presence of a woman is a distinguishing feature of salons and another to argue that female dominance set them apart from other institutions of elite sociability." [...] He adamantly believes that, [...] "Salonnières generally exercised no political power outside their role in the formation of public opinion, and salons were not centers of political intrigue. Kale states, [...] "Salonnières were engaged in a common social practice, the goal of which was not to achieve for women a role in public affairs but to serve the public needs of men, whether intellectuals or politicians, who had the power to determine the limits of women's public participation." [...] Kale rejects the notion that Geoffrin held any semblance of power; his argument debases the long-held idea that the female-run salons were, [...] "institutions of democratic sociability." [...] Instead, he bases much of his critics of earlier historians on the idea that salonnières such as Madame Geoffrin reaffirmed the aristocratic institutions of the Old Regime. He writes, [...] "The genius of salons, and of salonnières, lay in their ability to maintain a delicate balance between exclusivity and openness, between [...] "inclusions and exclusions", so that the aristocracy could have both a means of producing social cohesion and a vehicle for the dissemination of traits meant to characterize a wider society of elites undergoing redefinition." [...] Therefore, Kale visualizes Geoffrin's salon as confirming the aristocratic conception of the social and political conception of the social and political role of women in the Old Regime.|$|E

6000|$|... "It's <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> she's an impostor {{behind her}} back, {{and another thing}} to prove it to her face," [...] remarked the nurse. She put her hand as she spoke into her apron pocket, and, with a {{significant}} look at her mistress, silently produced a second letter.|$|E
6000|$|... "Were you {{addressing}} me, sir?"

6000|$|... "I {{have just}} <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> Mary," [...] said the parson, {{as he walked}} up and down the {{platform}} with her at Westbury; [...] "you are to remember that, whatever happens, there is always a home for you at Bullhampton when you choose to come to it. I am not speaking of the Privets now, but of the Vicarage." ...|$|E
6000|$|That, then, was all--yes, all! He {{turned out}} the little lamp, and groped towards the hearth.

Ah! well, sooner or later, all men had <b>to</b> <b>say</b> good-bye <b>to</b> that. All men--all men! ...|$|R
6000|$|After this {{there was}} a pause, and there arose {{conversation}} about other things, and a cigar was smoked. Then Tregear returned once more to the subject. [...] "There is <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> I wish <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about it all." ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Jerome {{was obliged}} to rest {{contented}} with this promise, and rode home sorrowfully, reproaching himself with not having said <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> he meant <b>to</b> <b>say</b> when setting out, and with having 'clean forgot' the arguments he had intended to quote from Mr. Stickney.|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{got only}} <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> I don't {{deserve to be}} helped; and I don't {{question}} or complain of my punishment; it is just, it ought to have happened.

Am I punished by miracle? or how can anyone but Philip and myself know I gave him a tiny coin {{in the middle of}} the sea?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Even as {{a private}} {{individual}} I have said more than I intended," [...] he replied. [...] "I have only <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{about the war in}} public, and that is that we are winning, that we must win, that our national existence depends upon winning, and that we shall go on until we do win.

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Honora. [...] "I {{do not say}} I am not to blame. I was a fool. My {{standards}} were false. In {{spite of the fact}} that my aunt and uncle are the most unworldly people that ever lived--perhaps because of it--I knew nothing of the values of life.

6000|$|... "Every word of it, Anne," [...] he answered. [...] "Please don't {{misunderstand}} {{the reason}} of my coming.

60|$|She {{turned and}} began to walk up the drive. Hanging {{over the top of the}} gate like a wet sock, Lord Dawlish watched her go. The {{interview}} was over, and he could not think of <b>one</b> single <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> Her white dress made a patch of light in the shadows. She moved slowly, as if weighed down by sad thoughts, like one who, as Luella Delia Philpotts beautifully puts it, paces with measured step behind the coffin of a murdered heart. The bend of the drive hid her from his sight.|$|R
6000|$|... "There's <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> I wish <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> you, Daggett, before Dr. Sage comes in.

6000|$|... "'You!' he said. 'What {{have you}} got to {{complain}} of?--you've only 'ad to watch. I'm it,' he says, 'but that's neither here nor there,' he says.

60|$|It was <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{we would}} forage, and {{quite another to}} do it. There were {{provisions}} in abundance in the British camp; but no possibility that we lads could come upon them, either by begging or by stealing, while our only chance lay in finding some of the villagers who were {{able and willing to}} minister to hungry boys without questioning whether they were for the king or the colonies.|$|E
6000|$|... "One may {{be obliged}} {{to give way to}} an {{occasional}} necessity," [...] said Deronda. [...] "But it is <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> 'In this particular case I am forced to put on this foolscap and grin,' and another to buy a pocket foolscap and practice myself in grinning. I can't see any real public expediency that does not keep an ideal before it which makes a limit of deviation from the direct path. But if I were to set up for a public man I might mistake my success for public expediency." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Eh bien, vicomte,” {{says the}} young prince, {{who was a}} boy, and a French boy, “il ne nous reste qu’une chose à faire:” he placed his sword upon the table, and {{the fingers of his}} two hands upon his breast:—“We have <b>one</b> more <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> do,” <b>says</b> he; “you do not divine it?” He {{stretched}} out his arms:—“Embrassons nous!” ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. MacGlue's answer {{disappointed}} me. He {{had never}} asked, {{and had never}} heard, whether the writing had remained or not. He had told me all that he knew, and he had but <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> more <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> {{and that was in}} the nature of a remark with a moral attached to it. [...] "There's a marvelous resemblance, Mr. Germaine, between your story and Bruce's story. The main difference, as I see it, is this. The passenger's appointment proved to be the salvation of a whole ship's company. I very much doubt whether the lady's appointment will prove to be the salvation of You." ...|$|R
5000|$|We have <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> further <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> {{and that}} is We heartily {{recommend}} Union and a Good Agreement between you our Brethren.

6000|$|... 'I {{have only}} <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> {{and it is}} this,' began Nan soberly, though her eyes sparkled {{with a mixture of}} fun and earnestness. 'I want to ask every boy of you what you really think on this subject. Dan and Emil have seen the world and ought to know their own minds. Tom and Nat have had five {{examples}} before them for years. Demi is ours and we are proud of him. So is Rob.

6000|$|But it is <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> Darwinically, {{that every}} detail {{observed}} in an animal's structure is {{of use to}} it, or has been of use to its ancestors; and quite another to affirm, teleologically, that every detail of an animal's structure has been created for its benefit. On the former hypothesis, for example, {{the teeth of the}} foetal Balæna have a meaning; on the latter, none. So far as we are aware, there is not a phrase in the [...] "Origin of Species," [...] inconsistent with Professor Kölliker's position, that [...] "varieties arise irrespectively of the notion of purpose, or of utility, according to general laws of Nature, and may be either useful, or hurtful, or indifferent." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Were it at {{any other}} funeral, I would not be present, Miles," [...] she said, the tremour of her voice sensibly increasing; [...] "but I cannot divest myself {{of the idea that}} the spirit of Grace will be {{hovering}} near; that the presence of her more than sister will be acceptable. Whatever the Providence of God may have ordered for the dear departed, I know it will be grateful to myself to join in the prayers of the church--besides, I am not altogether without the womanly feeling of wishing to watch over the form of Grace while it remains above ground. And now, Miles, brother, friend, Grace's brother, or by whatever endearing term I may address you," [...] added Lucy, rising, coming to my side of the table, and taking my hand. [...] "I have <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that I alone can say, for it would never suggest itself as necessary to my dear father." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Father John, I've only <b>one</b> more <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> and you'll {{answer me}} {{that as a}} priest and a Christian.

Now, Father John, if this unfortunate girl, whom I'm {{ready and willing to}} help, has done anything really wrong, you would not be the means of bringing her into the house with my own dear girls! Have you, Father John, told me all you know about her attachment to this man?" ...|$|R
60|$|There was {{something}} inexpressibly sacred about it, yet {{she found herself}} tongue-tied. Instead of the <b>one</b> definite <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> a muddle of ideas fluttered in her brain. After all, could he understand? Was there not a difference which prevented him from comprehending the motives which, for her, were impelling? For all her harking back to the primitive and stout defence of its sanity and truth, did his native philosophy give him the same code which she drew from her acquired philosophy? Then she stood aside and regarded herself and the queries she put, and drew apart from them, for they breathed of treason.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hay-making {{makes you}} ever so much handsomer," [...] she said; [...] "you {{look as if}} you had been on a {{yachting}} cruise.
