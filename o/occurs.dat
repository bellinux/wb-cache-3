A hurricane is a storm that <b>occurs</b> in the Atlantic Ocean and northeastern Pacific Ocean, a typhoon <b>occurs</b> in the northwestern Pacific Ocean, and a cyclone <b>occurs</b> in the south Pacific or Indian Ocean.|$|E
5|$|An Atlantic {{hurricane}} or {{tropical storm}} is a tropical cyclone that {{forms in the}} Atlantic Ocean, usually in the summer or fall. A hurricane differs from a cyclone or typhoon only {{on the basis of}} location. A hurricane is a storm that <b>occurs</b> in the Atlantic Ocean and northeastern Pacific Ocean, a typhoon <b>occurs</b> in the northwestern Pacific Ocean, and a cyclone <b>occurs</b> in the south Pacific or Indian Ocean.|$|E
5|$|Assembly – Following the structure-mediated {{self-assembly}} of {{the virus}} particles, some modification of the proteins often <b>occurs.</b> In viruses such as HIV, this modification (sometimes called maturation) <b>occurs</b> after the virus has been released from the host cell.|$|E

5|$|B.brownii <b>occurs</b> {{naturally}} only in two population clusters between Albany and the Stirling Range {{in southwest}} Western Australia. In the Stirling Range it <b>occurs</b> among heath on rocky mountain slopes; further south it <b>occurs</b> among jarrah woodland in shallow nutrient-poor sand. It is rare and endangered {{in its natural}} habitat, with all major populations currently threatened by Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback, a disease to which the species is highly susceptible. Other threats include loss of habitat, commercial exploitation and changes to the fire regime.|$|E
5|$|Cobalt in {{compound}} form <b>occurs</b> as a {{minor component}} of copper and nickel minerals. It is the major metallic component in combination with sulfur and arsenic in the sulfidic cobaltite (CoAsS), safflorite (CoAs2), glaucodot ((Co,Fe)AsS), and skutterudite (CoAs3) minerals. The mineral cattierite is similar to pyrite and <b>occurs</b> together with vaesite in the copper deposits of the Katanga Province. Upon contact with the atmosphere, weathering <b>occurs</b> and the sulfide minerals oxidize to form pink erythrite ("cobalt glance": Co3(AsO4)2·8H2O) and spherocobaltite (CoCO3).|$|E
5|$|Color {{morphism}} <b>occurs</b> in the species. A near-black melanistic form <b>occurs</b> regularly. Jaguars with melanism appear entirely black, {{although their}} spots are still visible on close examination.|$|E
40|$|Data from 548 {{reported}} {{accidents involving}} white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and vehicles in Lynchburg {{during the years}} 1987 - 1991 were summarized. A majority (54. 4 %) <b>occurred</b> in the months October, November and December with 25. 9 % <b>occurring</b> in November. While accidents <b>occurred</b> at all hours, most (50 %) <b>occurred</b> between 1700 and 0100 hrs.; about 12 % <b>occurred</b> between 0600 and 0900 hrs. Accidents <b>occurred</b> on all {{days of the week}} (range 12. 8 % to 17. 0 %) and were not higher on work days. Adverse weather did not seem to he a factor increasing collisions; 80 % of collisions <b>occurred</b> in clear weather. Most (75 %) accidents <b>occurred</b> in dark conditions; 50 % <b>occurred</b> on lighted highways. Accidents resulted in 9 human injuries and 1 human fatality...|$|R

25|$|Early PTS <b>occur</b> {{at least}} once in about 4 or 5% of people hospitalized with TBI, and late PTS <b>occur</b> at some point in 5% of them. Of the {{seizures}} that <b>occur</b> within the first week of trauma, about half <b>occur</b> within the first 24 hours. In children, early seizures are more likely to <b>occur</b> within an hour and a day of injury than in adults. Of the seizures that <b>occur</b> within the first four weeks of head trauma, about 10% <b>occur</b> after the first week. Late seizures <b>occur</b> at the highest rate in the first few weeks after injury. About 40% of late seizures start within six months of injury, and 50% start within a year.|$|R

5|$|Like other requiem sharks, {{the nervous}} shark is viviparous: once the embryos exhaust their initial supply of yolk, they are {{provisioned}} {{by the mother}} through a placental connection formed from the depleted yolk sac. Adult females have a single functional ovary, on the right, and two functional uteruses. The male bites {{at the sides of}} the female as a prelude to mating. After mating, the female stores the sperm for approximately four weeks prior to fertilization. In Darwin Harbor, mating <b>occurs</b> from January to March and birthing <b>occurs</b> in October and November following a gestation period of eight to nine months. In Shark Bay, mating <b>occurs</b> from late October to early November and birthing <b>occurs</b> around the same time the following year, following a gestation period of 11 months; this slower development likely reflects the cooler temperatures of Shark Bay.|$|E
5|$|Offshore {{volcanism}} also <b>occurs</b> in Chile. Intraplate volcanism {{generated from}} the Easter and Juan Fernández hotspots has formed many Chilean islands, including Isla Salas y Gómez, Easter Island, and the Juan Fernández Islands. Underwater volcanism <b>occurs</b> due to seafloor spreading along the Chile Ridge.|$|E

25|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{consonant}} clusters can <b>occur</b> in Crow. All consonants except for /h/ can be geminated. Voiced labials and dentals (phonemic m and n, allophones b, m, w and d, n, l) are resistant to clustering. Because they only <b>occur</b> intervocallically, l and w do not <b>occur</b> in clusters. The plosive allophones b and d only <b>occur</b> in clusters as the second consonant and only at morpheme boundaries. The nasal allophones m and n can only <b>occur</b> with each other {{with the exception of}} nm, or <b>occur</b> with h at a morpheme boundary. Clusters in general <b>occur</b> at morphemic boundaries.|$|R
30|$|Applying the {{semantic}} modeling technique, {{after the first}} syntactic analysis we have obtained an initial list of 24, 000 nouns reduced to 5600 using the frequency based filter. Successively, the result of {{the semantic}} analysis gives the following categorization: 265 terms in emergency (e.g. hurricane <b>occurring</b> 2753 times), 75 in evacuation (e.g. home <b>occurring</b> 95 times), 23 in media (e.g. internet <b>occurring</b> 15 times), 1079 in hashtags (e.g. #sandy <b>occurring</b> 1207 times), 159 in time (e.g. day <b>occurring</b> 131 times), 179 in place (e.g. nyc <b>occurring</b> 327 times), and 3804 in general (e.g. apocalypse <b>occurring</b> 191 times).|$|R

5|$|Progression from TB {{infection}} to overt TB disease <b>occurs</b> {{when the}} bacilli overcome {{the immune system}} defenses and begin to multiply. In primary TB disease (some 1–5% of cases), this <b>occurs</b> soon after the initial infection. However, {{in the majority of}} cases, a latent infection <b>occurs</b> with no obvious symptoms. These dormant bacilli produce active tuberculosis in 5–10% of these latent cases, often many years after infection.|$|E

5|$|The Tenerife {{subspecies}} <b>occurs</b> in {{the mountain}} region previously occupied by laurisilva, but now dominated by tree heaths. It is common only in that habitat, becoming rare in pine forest, where it <b>occurs</b> only where tree-heath is also available.|$|E
5|$|The {{extent to}} which cryovolcanism really <b>occurs</b> is a subject of some debate, as water, being denser than ice by about 8%, has {{difficulty}} erupting under normal circumstances. At Enceladus, it appears that cryovolcanism <b>occurs</b> because water-filled cracks are periodically exposed to vacuum, the cracks being opened and closed by tidal stresses.|$|E
