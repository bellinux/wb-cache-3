5|$|BART {{was one of}} {{the first}} U.S. systems of any size to be {{substantially}} automated. Routing and dispatching of trains, and adjustments for schedule recovery are controlled by a combination of computer and human supervision at BART's Operations Control Center (OCC) and headquarters at the Kaiser Center in Downtown Oakland. Station-to-station train movement, including speed control and maintenance of separation between successive trains, is entirely automatic under normal operation, the operator's routine responsibilities being issuing announcements, closing the doors after stations stops, and monitoring the track ahead for hazards. In unusual circumstances the <b>operator</b> <b>controls</b> the train manually at reduced speed.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} approach was {{the development of}} the ADS or armoured suit, which isolates the diver from the pressure at depth, at the cost of mechanical complexity and limited dexterity. The technology first became practicable in the middle 20th century. Isolation of the diver from the environment was taken further by the development of remotely operated underwater vehicles in the late 20th century, where the <b>operator</b> <b>controls</b> the ROV from the surface, and autonomous underwater vehicles, which dispense with an operator altogether. All of these modes are still in use and each has a range of applications where it has advantages over the others, though diving bells have largely been relegated to a means of transport for surface supplied divers. In some cases combinations are particularly effective, such as the simultaneous use of surface orientated or saturation surface supplied diving equipment and work or observation class remotely operated vehicles.|$|E
500|$|Also by 1867, {{codes for}} Q (...) and Z (...) {{were added to}} the one-needle code, but not, apparently, for J. [...] However, codes for Q (...) , Z (...) , and J (...) are marked on the plates of later needle telegraphs, {{together}} with six-unit codes for number shift (...) and letter shift (...) [...] [...] Numerous compound codes were added for <b>operator</b> <b>controls</b> such as wait and repeat. [...] These compounds are similar to the prosigns found in Morse code where the two characters are run together without a character gap. [...] The two-needle number shift and letter shift codes are also compounds, which is the reason they have been written with an overbar.|$|E
40|$|Disclosed are {{methods and}} {{apparatuses}} provided for modifying {{the effect of}} an <b>operator</b> <b>controlled</b> input device on an interactive device to encourage the self-regulation {{of at least one}} physiological activity by a person different than the operator. The interactive device comprises a display area which depicts images and apparatus for receiving at least one input from the <b>operator</b> <b>controlled</b> input device to thus permit the <b>operator</b> to <b>control</b> and interact with {{at least some of the}} depicted images. One effect modification comprises measurement of the physiological activity of a person different from the operator, while modifying the ability of the <b>operator</b> to <b>control</b> and interact with at least some of the depicted images by modifying the input from the <b>operator</b> <b>controlled</b> input device in response to changes in the measured physiological signal...|$|R

2500|$|As in {{the rest}} of the farm tractor industry, the mid through late 1930s was the time when Allis-Chalmers's {{tractors}} went from [...] "unstyled" [...] to [...] "styled". The major manufacturers hired industrial designers (in Allis's case, Brooks Stevens) to style their tractors with streamlined sheet metal (and in some cases revised <b>operator</b> <b>controls</b> with better usability). In 1938, the WC was styled and was given a larger radiator and tires.|$|E
2500|$|An {{airbrush}} {{works by}} passing {{a stream of}} fast moving (compressed) air through a venturi, which creates a local reduction in air pressure (suction) that allows paint to be pulled from an interconnected reservoir at normal atmospheric pressure. The high velocity of the air atomizes the paint into very tiny droplets as it blows past a very fine paint-metering component. [...] The paint is carried onto paper or other surfaces. The <b>operator</b> <b>controls</b> the amount of paint using a variable trigger which opens {{more or less a}} very fine tapered needle that is the control element of the paint-metering component. An extremely fine degree of atomization is what allows an artist to create such smooth blending effects using the airbrush.|$|E
2500|$|An {{alternative}} approach was {{the development of}} the [...] "single atmosphere" [...] or armoured suit, which isolates the diver from the pressure at depth, at the cost of great mechanical complexity and limited dexterity. The technology first became practicable in the middle 20th century. Isolation of the diver from the environment was taken further by the development of remotely operated underwater vehicles in the late 20th century, where the <b>operator</b> <b>controls</b> the ROV from the surface, and autonomous underwater vehicles, which dispense with an operator altogether.

30|$|In an experiment, <b>operators</b> <b>controlled</b> {{a mobile}} robot by {{steering}} to trace reference lines. However, in our construction machine, <b>operators</b> <b>control</b> {{on the basis}} of a work plan without a detailed reference trajectory. Operators have common actions, e.g., excavation and manipulation of a hoist arm. Operators change these actions according to the work target, habitual actions, and work progress. In particular, in teleoperation, it is difficult for <b>operators</b> to <b>control</b> the tip of a construction machine in three-dimensional space without perspective.|$|R
2500|$|The {{most notable}} changes were the {{addition}} of the McDonnell Douglas Advanced Aerial Refueling Boom (AARB) and additional fuel tanks located in the baggage compartments below the main deck. The extra tanks increase the KC-10's fuel capacity to 356,000lb (161,478kg), nearly doubling the KC-135's capacity. The KC-10 has both a centerline refueling boom — unique in that it sports a control surface system at its aft end that differs from the V-tail design used on previous tankers — and a drogue-and-hose system on the starboard side of the rear fuselage. The KC-10 boom operator is located {{in the rear of the}} aircraft with a wide window for monitoring refueling. The <b>operator</b> <b>controls</b> refueling operations through a digital fly-by wire system. Unlike the KC-135, the KC-10's hose-and-drogue system allows refueling of Navy, Marine Corps, and most allied aircraft, all in one mission. The final twenty KC-10s produced included wing-mounted pods for added refueling locations. In addition to its tanking role, the KC-10 can carry a complement 75 personnel with 146,000lb (66,225kg) of cargo, or 170,000lb (77,110kg) in an all-cargo configuration. [...] The KC-10 has a side cargo door for loading and unloading cargo. [...] Handling equipment is required to raise and lower loads to the cargo opening.|$|E

40|$|Two {{alternative}} work {{designs are}} identified for operators of stand-alone advanced manufacturing technology (AMT). In {{the case of}} specialist <b>control,</b> <b>operators</b> are limited to running and monitoring the technology, with operating problems handled by specialists, such as engineers. In the case of <b>operator</b> <b>control,</b> <b>operators</b> are given much broader responsibilities and deal directly {{with the majority of}} operating problems encountered. The hypothesis that <b>operator</b> <b>control</b> would promote better performance and psychological well-being than would specialist control (which is more prevalent) was tested in a longitudinal field study involving work redesign for operators of computer-controlled assembly machines. Change from specialist to <b>operator</b> <b>control</b> reduced downtime, especially for high-variance systems, and was associated with greater intrinsic job satisfaction and less perceived work pressure. The implications of these findings for both small and large-scale applications of AMT are discussed...|$|R
50|$|Competitors {{were put}} on two-team alliances in the {{qualification}} matches. The competitors could place their robot anywhere on {{their side of the}} field. Each match had a 20-second autonomous period. During the autonomous period each robot's program could drive autonomously to score points without human control.

Most machines also have video cameras set up to enable the operator to monitor activities in the jacking shaft and at the separation plant. The <b>operator</b> <b>controls</b> the MTBM and the jacking frame from the safety of the control room which is usually situated on the surface, next to the jacking shaft.|$|E
