(Orange is Nishikawa's favourite colour.) , an album track from coordinate, {{was used as an}} insert song to Gundam SEED. The album mix of [...] "THUNDERBIRD", originally from the force, was also included on this album. Later that year, Nishikawa became the first artist to be signed under Tofu Records, and coordinate was the first album released by Tofu. The Tofu release of coordinate also included [...] "HEART OF SWORD ~Yoake Mae~" [...] as a bonus track. Nishikawa made his debut North American performance at Otakon in August 2003, to a massive audience who filled both the ballroom and <b>overflow</b> <b>room</b> (an exhibition hall) of the Baltimore Convention Center to their entirety.|$|E
2500|$|The annual shareholders' meeting, {{held at the}} First Chicago Center in Chicago on February 21, was {{described}} by the press as [...] "turbulent." [...] On February 20, the union obtained a court order requiring International Harvester to set up closed-circuit television facilities so members of the UAW and other shareholders could observe the meeting. The <b>overflow</b> <b>room</b> was at a hotel several blocks away. But when the meeting opened with about 200 seats still empty, McCardell delayed proceedings for an hour as 175 UAW members were brought from the hotel to the First Chicago Center. The UAW bitterly attacked McCardell throughout the proceedings. Cletus Williams, chairman of the UAW's negotiating committee, accused McCardell of manipulating the shareholders' meeting so that many UAW members didn't know they could attend {{until it was too}} late. Despite the rancorous shareholders' meeting, bargainers resumed talks that same day. IH once more altered its overtime proposal, suggesting that employees be required to work up to 14 Saturdays a year and establishing a voluntary pool of part-time workers to fill in shifts when not enough full-time workers volunteered to work a particular Saturday shift. But the company withdrew its proposal when the union declared its opposition.|$|E

But such as glanced across the passage into the <b>overflow</b> <b>room</b> seemed to think it now the {{possession}} solely of the pioneers of the movement. At any rate, they made no show of joining them; and after Miss Lynde and Jeff had looked at {{the pictures on the}} walls and the photographs on the mantel of the room where they found themselves, they sat down on chairs fronting the open door and the door of the room they had left. The window-seat would have been more to Jeff's mind, and he had proposed it, but the girl seemed not to have heard him; she took the deep easy-chair {{in full view of the}} company opposite, and left him to pull up a chair beside her.|$|E
50|$|Goss battled {{a series}} of brain tumours for 17 years, {{undergoing}} four operations to remove them. He died aged 63 {{at his home in}} Brisbane on 10 November 2014, with his wife and children present. Instead of a state funeral, a private funeral was held, and a public memorial service was organized by the family at the Queensland Gallery of Modern Art. Over a thousand mourners attended the service, some accommodated in <b>overflow</b> <b>rooms.</b>|$|R
50|$|The church {{attendance}} eventually grew {{to the point}} that six worship services plus a youth service were not enough to accommodate the people or meet their needs. With a sanctuary capacity of 7,000, over 8,000 active members attempted to fill the church each week. While everybody was welcomed, the church was required to comply with legal Fire Marshall codes. Unfortunately, hundreds of people each week were turned away, due to lack of parking or seating space in the sanctuary and <b>overflow</b> <b>rooms</b> provided with televised feed.|$|R
40|$|What does it {{mean for}} humans to desire human-like {{relationships}} with robots? What kind of sovereignty do we want to have over our trash? These two seemingly unrelated questions melded together exquisitely during Patricia Yaeger’s talk “Luminous Trash: Throwaway Robots in Blade Runner, the Terminators, A. I. and Wall•E. ” Yaeger directed her audiences’ eyes towards robots as trash, and in doing so, linked together present and future possibilities for re-thinking automated relationships, technological power, and wasteful consumption. Yaeger, the Henry Simmons Frieze Collegiate Professor of English and Women’s Studies at the University of Michigan, spoke to an <b>overflowing</b> <b>room</b> about our fascination with robots and trash, both of whom—or of which, depending on your comfort level with anthropomorphizing non-human subjects—highlight tensions between our desires and their limits...|$|R

50|$|The {{board meeting}} {{regarding}} {{the closure of}} Jones was held at 4 PM. The school district opened an <b>overflow</b> <b>room</b> due to {{the large number of}} people attending; people in the <b>overflow</b> <b>room</b> saw the meeting through a television. During this meeting, Manuel Rodriguez, a board member, introduced the modified motion to convert Jones. The audience had a positive reception when Rodriguez stated that Jones would remain open, but it had a negative reception when he revealed the terms. Board member Rhonda Skillern-Jones, formerly a member of the Houston City Council, stated that there were not enough board votes to keep Jones as a comprehensive high school, so the conversion was politically necessary. Members of the public criticized the loss of the athletic programs at Jones. Texas House of Representatives member Borris Miles also argued that the compromise was politically feasible while keeping Jones as a zoned school was not.|$|E
50|$|The {{guest house}} and kitchen {{associated}} with the Clover Hill Tavern was originally constructed around 1819.

50|$|The {{church has}} two Sunday morning services, a Wednesday night prayer meeting, {{extensive}} Sunday school, and midweek Christian training programs. Other meetings are held throughout the week. Dr. Stanley typically preaches at both Sunday morning services. The newly renovated sanctuary seats 3,000, excluding the <b>overflow</b> <b>room.</b> In {{addition to the}} sanctuary, the church building includes a chapel, a theater, a large youth facility (including a coffee shop, a rock climbing wall, and a gym), dining facilities, a bookstore, rotunda and other spaces typical of megachurches. The church is a theologically conservative congregation, and Dr. Stanley has longtime links to Jerry Falwell, Pat Robertson, Jim Bakker, Bill Bright and others in both evangelical and Baptist circles.|$|E
50|$|In the mid-1970s, {{the town}} {{acquired}} the convent and school building that had since been forsaken. Sometime {{later it was}} converted into a cultural and social centre for the community. The Homeland Museum mentioned above was given a home on the top floor. The “Altenstube” {{on the ground floor}} affords senior citizens a social venue. Also found in the building are the local chapter of the Bavarian Red Cross and a daycare centre. In the basement, a youth centre has been set up. For a time, the old classrooms were even once again used as such when the neighbouring elementary school needed <b>overflow</b> <b>room</b> to handle great numbers of pupils who were threatening to burst the school’s seams.However, most of the building nowadays is used as a kindergarten, together with a newly built building in the former park nearby.|$|E
50|$|The church {{building}} {{was established by}} televangelist W. V. Grant as the Eagles Nest Family Church. It {{is located in the}} Oak Cliff area of Dallas right next to Dallas Baptist University.After Grant was convicted of tax evasion in 1996 he sold the facility to T. D. Jakes, a fellow televangelist, who renamed it and relaunched it as The Potter's House.Jakes had moved from West Virginia with 50 families, who formed the nucleus of the new congregation.To handle expansion, the church built a 191000 sq ft sanctuary at a cost of $45 million, paying off the debt in four years.The auditorium was completed in August 2000 and features cascade seating, a large stage, a choir loft that can seat 450 and a state-of-the-art audio-visual system.The sanctuary seats about 7,600 people and is also used for non-church events such as graduations, concerts and corporate presentations.By 2000 Jakes was holding three services every Sunday, with attendance of over 23,000 in the sanctuary and the <b>overflow</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E

50|$|As Christian Life Center began {{experiencing}} {{exponential growth}} - four Sunday services, lines forming at 4:00am, and <b>overflow</b> <b>rooms</b> filled to capacity, the ministry was quickly outgrowing its home on Linden Boulevard. The {{need for a}} larger facility was evident and in 1995 a vacant lot adjacent to Starrett City was purchased and construction followed immediately. On December 31, 2000, {{under the leadership of}} Bernard, Christian Cultural Center took its new name and moved into its new home. The 6.5-acre (26,000 m2) sanctuary and conference center also includes a chapel, bookstore, television production facilities and state of the art youth center. Christian Cultural Center, one of the largest independent churches in the United States, exemplifies a new paradigm in the worship experience. Bernard remains a highly sought after speaker, teacher and community leader. He has traveled extensively throughout the United States and internationally addressing religious organizations, businessmen and political dignitaries.Future expansion and development is anticipated on a 4.5-acre (18,000 m2) of land adjacent to the current CCC campus.|$|R
5000|$|NASA {{introduced}} the astronauts in Washington on April 9, 1959.

5000|$|On November 21, 2011, {{members of}} Occupy Charlottesville {{expressed}} {{their intention to}} continue the occupation to Charlottesville City Council. Many asked for the City to suspend the 11 pm curfew. Over 100 supporters packed the chambers in what Councilor David Brown called the best-attended meeting in his eight years on the board. An <b>overflow</b> <b>room</b> was opened for people who could not fit into the council chambers. About 60 people spoke to City Council regarding Occupy Charlottesville, a handful of them against its continued presence. Councilor response followed the public comments portion of the meeting. During this response portion of the meeting Councilor Szakos stated that she [...] "thinks that free speech doesn't expire at 11 o'clock. It doesn't expire at Thanksgiving." [...] Szakos was the sole councilor in favor of allowing the occupation to continue in Lee Park despite complaints by {{some members of the}} neighborhood. The rest of the council was in favor of the continuation of Occupy Charlottesville, albeit not in Lee Park. A desire was expressed to move the occupation to a new location, approved by the local city government. Mayor Dave Norris expressed his desire to find an alternative location for the occupiers other than a [...] "neighborhood park". Although he expressed general support for the movement, he was resolved to end the Lee Park encampment.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the fall}} of 2007, the number of {{students}} registering for 3.091 reached 570 students, over half the freshman class. The largest lecture hall available on campus seats 566 students, enough to amply house the class. Sadoway much preferred teaching in one of the smaller lecture halls, seating only 450; as such, the Institute had to take the unprecedented step of streaming digital video of the lecture into an <b>overflow</b> <b>room</b> to accommodate all the students interested in taking the course. In contrast, most classes at MIT are relatively small with approximately 60% of classes at MIT having fewer than 20 students. The popularity of this course has reached outside of the MIT campus {{as a result of the}} MIT OpenCourseWare initiative. This is seen in a comment by Bill Gates who told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer [...] "... Everybody should watch chemistry lectures -- they're far better than you think. Don Sadoway, MIT -- best chemistry lessons anywhere. Unbelievable".Sadoway's lectures often included the history of science, especially with respect to the Nobel Prize. Sadoway gave out [...] "library assignments" [...] in which he asked students to research Nobel Prize-winning papers. He began his lectures by playing music, which has some connection with the lecture's material. He ended his lectures with five minutes of culturally relevant material, such as automotive exhaust processing or forensic examination of paintings.|$|E

50|$|In Reza v. Pearce, 806 F.3d 497 (9th Cir. 2015), Arizona State Senator Russell Pearce {{had ordered}} Salvador Reza {{barred from the}} Arizona Senate building, {{allegedly}} because Reza disrupted Senate proceedings, and Pearce feared {{that he would do}} so in the future. Reza was then arrested when he later tried to enter the Senate building to meet with a State Senator. Smith, writing for a divided panel, reversed the district court’s grant of summary judgment to Pearce, holding that when disputed facts were resolved in Reza’s favor, as required on a motion for summary judgment, Pearce’s conduct violated clearly established First Amendment law. While Pearce believed that Reza had been at least clapping loudly in the <b>overflow</b> <b>room</b> during the debate on the Omnibus Immigration Bill, the responsible officer clearly told Pearce that {{there was no reason to}} remove any audience members from the building, the hearing continued without interruption, and it was not until two days after the hearing that Pearce ordered Reza barred from the building. Smith held that in those circumstances, a blanket ban from the building clearly exceeded the bounds of reasonableness established by the case law. Conversely, Smith held that the district court did not err in granting the arresting officers’ motion to dismiss on qualified immunity grounds, because they were complying with a facially-valid order from Senator Pearce. Pearce’s petition for rehearing en banc failed, and after further consultation with the Arizona Attorney General’s Office, Pearce later filed a notice that he did not intend to pursue Supreme Court review.|$|E

5000|$|The matrix mixer {{is useful}} for {{performance}} spaces with multiple loudspeaker zones such as main left and right loudspeaker arrays, a center loudspeaker cluster or array, under-balcony speakers for the rear seating area, stage-lip loudspeakers for the front seats, <b>overflow</b> <b>rooms,</b> green rooms, the foyer, and broadcast or live streaming to distant audiences. If there is no separate monitor mixer with its own operator, the matrix mixer {{could be used to}} send a different blend to stage monitors or sidefill loudspeakers. However, such a use of the matrix is limited by the likelihood that the musicians on stage would be disturbed by any changes made to the channel levels by the front of house operator. It is usually better to supply stage monitors with signal obtained from pre-fader auxiliary sends. Listeners outside of the main performance space will not hear amplified instruments such as electric guitar as well as those inside, so the matrix output going to their location would typically contain more of the amplified instruments. Also, the matrix may be used to send a different blend to any recording devices, especially a blend that is optimized for stereo playback whereas the live sound for the performance space may be presented in mono. The matrix mixer may be used to combine the main mix with audience ambiance microphones to obtain a more [...] "live" [...] blend for the recording mix.|$|R

40|$|In the {{aftermath}} of a potentially demoralizing 2008 electoral defeat, when the Republican Party seemed widely discredited, the emergence of theTea Party provided conservative activists with a new identity funded by Republican business elites and reinforced by a network of conservative media sources. Untethered from recent GOP baggage and policy specifics, the Tea Party energized disgruntled white middle-class conservatives and garnered widespread attention, despite stagnant or declining favorability ratings among the general public. As participant observation and interviews withMassachusetts activists reveal, Tea Partiers are not mono-lithically hostile toward government; they distinguish between programs perceived as going to hard-working contributors to US society like themselves and “handouts ” perceived as going to unworthy or freeloading people. During 2010, Tea Party activism reshaped many GOP primaries and enhanced voter turnout, but achieved a mixed record in the November general election.
