The prototype {{was presented to the}} Archives of the Republic in June and on December 10, 1799, the prototype was formally ratified as the kilogramme des Archives (Kilogram of the Archives) and the kilogram was defined as being equal to its mass. This standard stood for the next 90 years.|$|E
5|$|A {{persistent}} myth of {{more recent}} origin {{is that of}} the Glastonbury Zodiac, a purported astrological zodiac of gargantuan proportions said to have been carved into the land along ancient hedgerows and trackways, in which the Tor forms part of the figure representing Aquarius. The theory was first put forward in 1927 by Katherine Maltwood, an artist with an interest in the occult, who thought the zodiac was constructed approximately 5,000 years ago. But {{the vast majority of the}} land said by Maltwood to be covered by the zodiac was under several feet <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>at</b> the proposed time of its construction, and many of the features such as field boundaries and roads are recent.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} {{coherence}} was only {{introduced into the}} metric system {{in the third quarter}} of the 19th century; in its original form the metric system was non-coherent—in particular the litre was 0.001m3 and the are (from which the hectare derives) was 100m2. However the units of mass and length were related to each other through the physical properties of water, the gram having been designed as being the mass of one cubic centimetre <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>at</b> its freezing point.|$|E

5|$|Balaenids rely {{on their}} huge heads, {{as opposed to the}} rorquals' throat pleats, to feed effectively. This feeding {{behavior}} allows them to grow very big and bulky, without the necessity for a streamlined body. They have callosities, unlike other whales, {{with the exception of the}} bowhead whale. Rorquals have a higher proportion of muscle tissue and tend to be negatively buoyant, whereas right whales have a higher proportion of blubber and are positively buoyant. Gray whales are easily distinguished from other extant cetaceans by their sleet-gray color, dorsal ridges (knuckles on the back), and their gray-white scars left from parasites. As with the rorquals, their throat pleats increase the capacity of their throats, allowing them to filter larger volumes <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>at</b> once. Gray whales are bottom-feeders, meaning they sift through sand to get their food. They usually turn on their sides, scoop up sediment into their mouths and filter out benthic creatures like amphipods, which leave noticeable marks on their heads.|$|E
5|$|Most of the gyromitrin must {{be removed}} to render false morels edible. The {{recommended}} procedure involves either first drying and then boiling the mushrooms, or boiling the fresh mushrooms directly. To prepare fresh mushroom {{it is recommended that}} they are cut into small pieces and parboiled twice in copious amounts <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> <b>at</b> least three parts water to one part chopped mushrooms, for at least five minutes, after each boiling the mushroom should be rinsed thoroughly in clean water. Each round of parboiling reduces the gyromitrin contents to a tenth. The gyromitrin is leached into the water where it will remain, therefore the parboiling water must be discarded and replaced with fresh water after each round of boiling. Drying the mushrooms can also reduce the concentration of gyromitrin; ten days of open air desiccation leads to the loss of 90% of gyromitrin. However it is still recommended that the mushroom be boiled after drying.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} routes towards Syria from Iraq, one was via Daumat-ul-Jandal (Now known as Skaka) {{and the other}} was through Mesopotamia passing though Raqqa. Since the Muslim forces in Syria were in need of urgent reinforcement, Khalid avoided the {{conventional}} route to Syria via Daumat-ul-Jandal because it was a long and would take weeks to reach Syria. He also avoided the Mesopotamian route {{because of the presence of}} Roman garrisons in northern Syria and Mesopotamia. Engaging them at the time when Muslim armies were being outflanked in Syria, was also ruled out since it would mean fighting on two fronts. Khalid selected a rather shorter route to Syria which unconventionally passed though the Syrian Desert. He marched his army though the desert, where traditions tells that his soldiers marched for two days without a single drop of water, before reaching a pre-decided water source at an oasis. Khalid is said to have solved the water shortage issue using a Bedouin method. Camels were made to drink water after intentionally denying them water for a lengthy time period, encouraging the camels to drink a lot <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>at</b> one time. Camels have the ability to store water in their stomach which in turn could be obtained by slaughtering them when necessary. Muslim troops rode entirely on camels and this method became an effective one for the Muslim army.|$|E
