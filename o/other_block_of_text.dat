These oriented blocks can be used for languages in a different orientation from the rest of the document, or simply if one needs to orient the text for layout purposes.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{an extension of}} the KIM semantic annotation, indexing, and retrieval platform called CORE (Co-Occurrence and Ranking of Entities). It enables timeline analysis and a novel search interface named CORE Search. The idea and its advantages to the traditional key-word search are explained along with the environment, technical description and use case scenarios. The essence of the approach is a specific indexing, performed on the basis of semantic annotation <b>of</b> <b>text</b> with respect to named entities and keyphrases. These entities form a reduced dimension feature space, where the documents are characterized by the occurrence of the entities. Documents (or <b>other</b> <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>text)</b> are considered contexts; document sets (or corpora) represent compound contexts. The frequency of occurrence of an entity in a context indicates its level of association with it, which can also be considered as “popularity”. The frequency of co-occurrence of entities is evidence of the existence and strength of an associative relationship between them, although the exact relation type might not be known and this can be used for rich metadata extraction. The dates of the documents are used to provide temporal extent to the context space and allow for analysis of trends of popularity or of association. Central for the implementation is a relational database with full-text indexing, where occurrence information can be managed efficiently. It allows for hybrid queries involving both CORE statistics and standard keyword search. Although it is a relatively new extension of KIM, CORE DB was already proven to scale to 10 6 entities, having 10 8 occurrences in 10 6 documents. It is efficient enough to allow instant timeline generation and incremental (as-youtype...|$|R
