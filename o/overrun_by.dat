5|$|By mid-1790, Habsburg Austria {{ended its}} {{war with the}} Ottoman Empire and {{prepared}} to suppress the Brabant revolutionaries. The new Holy Roman Emperor, Leopold II, a liberal like his predecessor, proposed an amnesty for the rebels. After a Statist army was overcome at the Battle of Falmagne, the territory was quickly <b>overrun</b> <b>by</b> Imperial forces, and the revolution was defeated by December. The Austrian reestablishment was short-lived, however, and the territory was soon <b>overrun</b> <b>by</b> the French during the French Revolutionary Wars.|$|E

Stephen granted Vidin to Jacob Svetoslav who accepted his suzerainty.|$|E
5|$|A lack of {{preparation}} for the disaster contributed to the high death toll. Armero had been built on an alluvial fan that had been <b>overrun</b> <b>by</b> historic mudflows; authorities had ignored a hazard-zone map that showed the potential damage to the town from lahars. Residents stayed inside their dwellings to avoid the falling ash, as local officials had instructed them to do, not thinking {{that they might be}} buried by the mudflows.|$|E

5|$|Written by Stephen Gallagher, this {{script was}} {{submitted}} in late 1982 but rejected by Saward {{on grounds of}} cost. The four-part story would involve the Doctor, Tegan and Turlough testing a Reality Simulator. This simulator projects a graveyard world <b>overrun</b> <b>by</b> the Vodyani who soon {{find a way out}} of the virtual reality and into the real world.|$|E
5|$|After Romania {{joined the}} war {{on the side of}} the Triple Entente in August and was quickly <b>overrun</b> <b>by</b> the Central Powers, the Russian efforts in the Black Sea in the second half of 1916 were focused in the west. Because German {{submarines}} never really accomplished all that much in the Black Sea, the February 1917 resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare led the Germans to temporarily abandon the Black Sea in lieu of the more target-rich Mediterranean. UB-14s whereabouts and activities during the latter half of 1916 and the first few months of 1917 are unreported in sources.|$|E

Shane denies the accusations and threatens to shoot Dale should he make any more.|$|E

Unlike the raiders featured in the base game, the raiders of Nuka-World are much more disciplined and organised, with each gang following a different ideology.|$|E

He broke the Leningrad Blockade by organising {{the construction of a}} supply route and a pipeline on the bottom of Lake Ladoga. Kosygin was a candidate member of the Politburo from 1946 to 1949, and became a full member toward the end of Joseph Stalin's rule; he lost his seat in 1952.

5|$|Many {{theories}} have been advanced {{in way of}} explanation for decline of the Roman Empire, and many dates given for its fall, from the onset of its decline in the 3rd century to the fall of Constantinople in 1453. Militarily, however, the Empire finally fell after first being <b>overrun</b> <b>by</b> various non-Roman peoples and then having its heart in Italy seized by Germanic troops in a revolt. The historicity and exact dates are uncertain, and some historians do not consider that the Empire fell at this point.|$|E
5|$|On 29 August 1942, {{during the}} Battle of Isurava, Kingsbury {{was one of}} the few {{survivors}} of a platoon that had been <b>overrun</b> <b>by</b> the Japanese. He immediately volunteered to join a different platoon, which had been ordered to counter-attack. Rushing forward and firing his Bren gun from the hip, he cleared a path through the enemy and inflicted several casualties. Kingsbury was then seen to fall, shot by a Japanese sniper and killed instantly. His actions, which delayed the Japanese long enough for the Australians to fortify their positions, were instrumental in saving his battalion's headquarters and he was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross as a result.|$|E

50|$|The {{first phase}} of Gemini {{instrumentation}} development did not run smoothly; schedules slipped by several years, and budgets sometimes <b>overran</b> <b>by</b> {{as much as a}} factor of two. In 2003 the instrument-development process was re-analysed in the Aspen report; for example, an incentive program was introduced where instrument developers were guaranteed substantial allocations of telescope time if they delivered the instrument on time and lose it as the instrument is delayed.|$|R
