5|$|The <b>olfactory</b> <b>nerve</b> (I) {{conveys the}} sense of smell.|$|E
5|$|The {{sense of}} smell is {{generated}} by receptor cells in the epithelium of the olfactory mucosa in the nasal cavity. This information passes through a relatively permeable part of the skull to the <b>olfactory</b> <b>nerve.</b> This nerve transmits to the neural circuitry of the olfactory bulb from where information is passed to the olfactory cortex.|$|E
5|$|CSF {{returns to}} the {{vascular}} system by entering the dural venous sinuses via arachnoid granulations. These are outpouchings of the arachnoid mater into the venous sinuses around the brain, with valves to ensure one-way drainage. This occurs because of a pressure difference between the arachnoid mater and venous sinuses. CSF has also been seen to drain into lymphatic vessels, particularly those surrounding the nose via drainage along the <b>olfactory</b> <b>nerve</b> through the cribriform plate. The pathway and extent are currently not known, but may involve CSF flow along some cranial nerves and be more prominent in the neonate. CSF turns over {{at a rate of}} three to four times a day. CSF has also been seen to be reabsorbed through the sheathes of cranial and spinal nerve sheathes, and through the ependyma.|$|E

40|$|Streptococcus pneumoniae cause {{considerable}} {{morbidity and}} mortality, with persistent neurological sequelae, particularly {{in young children}} and the elderly. It is widely assumed that carriage occurs through direct mucosal colonization from the environment whereas meningitis results from invasion from the blood. However, the results of published studies can be interpreted that pneumococci may enter the brain directly from the nasal cavity by axonal transport through <b>olfactory</b> <b>nerves.</b> This hypothesis is based on findings that (i) teichoic acid of the pneumococcal cell wall interact with gangliosides (GLS), (ii) the interaction of GLS with cholera toxin leads to axonal transport through the <b>olfactory</b> <b>nerves</b> into the brain, and (iii) viruses enter the brain through axonal transport into <b>olfactory</b> <b>nerves.</b> After nasal inoculation, we observe high numbers of pneumococci in nasal washes and the <b>olfactory</b> <b>nerves</b> and epithelium. Significant numbers of pneumococci also infected the olfactory bulbs, brain, and the trigeminal ganglia. The absence of bacteremia in this model makes it unlikely that the bacteria entered the brain from the blood stream. Recovery of colony-forming units from the brain, lungs, <b>olfactory</b> <b>nerves,</b> and epithelium and nasal washes was inhibited by incubating pneumococci with GLS before nasal inoculation. These findings, confirmed by PCR and immunohistochemistry, support a GLS-mediated process of infection and are consistent with pneumococci reaching the brain through retrograde axonal transport...|$|R

25|$|The {{nasal septum}} is {{composed}} of the quadrangular cartilage, the vomer bone (the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone), aspects of the premaxilla, and the palatine bones. Each lateral nasal wall contains three pairs of turbinates (nasal conchae), which are small, thin, shell-form bones: (i) the superior concha, (ii) the middle concha, and (iii) the inferior concha, which are the bony framework of the turbinates. Lateral to the turbinates is the medial wall of the maxillary sinus. Inferior to the nasal conchae (turbinates) is the meatus space, with names that correspond to the turbinates, e.g. superior turbinate, superior meatus, et alii. The internal roof of the nose is composed by the horizontal, perforated cribriform plate (of the ethmoid bone) through which pass sensory filaments of the <b>olfactory</b> <b>nerve</b> (Cranial nerve I); finally, below and behind (posteroinferior) the cribriform plate, sloping down at an angle, is the bony face of the sphenoid sinus.|$|E
500|$|The <b>olfactory</b> <b>nerve</b> (I), {{actually}} {{composed of}} many small separate nerve fibers, passes through perforations in the cribiform plate {{part of the}} ethmoid bone. [...] These fibers terminate in {{the upper part of}} the nasal cavity and function to convey impulses containing information about odors to the brain.|$|E
60|$|There {{are those}} who believe that the lower orders are {{specially}} endowed by nature with better <b>olfactory</b> <b>nerves</b> than man, but it is merely a matter of development.|$|R
50|$|The {{peripheral}} {{olfactory system}} consists mainly of the nostrils, ethmoid bone, nasal cavity, and the olfactory epithelium (layers of thin tissue covered in mucus {{that line the}} nasal cavity). The primary components of the layers of epithelial tissue are the mucous membranes, olfactory glands, <b>olfactory</b> neurons, and <b>nerve</b> fibers of the <b>olfactory</b> <b>nerves.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{terminal}} <b>nerves,</b> <b>olfactory</b> <b>nerves</b> (I) and optic nerves (II) {{emerge from}} the cerebrum or forebrain, and the remaining ten pairs arise from the brainstem, which is {{the lower part of}} the brain.|$|R
500|$|Most typically, {{humans are}} {{considered}} to have twelve pairs of cranial nerves (I–XII). They are: the <b>olfactory</b> <b>nerve</b> (I), the optic nerve (II), oculomotor nerve (III), trochlear nerve (IV), trigeminal nerve (V), abducens nerve (VI), facial nerve (VII), vestibulocochlear nerve (VIII), glossopharyngeal nerve (IX), vagus nerve (X), accessory nerve (XI), and hypoglossal nerve (XII). (There may be a thirteenth cranial nerve, the terminal nerve (nerve O or N), which is very small and {{may or may not}} be functional in humans) ...|$|E
500|$|Damage to the <b>olfactory</b> <b>nerve</b> (I) {{can cause}} an {{inability}} to smell (anosmia), a distortion {{in the sense of}} smell (parosmia), or a distortion or lack of taste. If there is suspicion of a change in the sense of smell, each nostril is tested with substances of known odors such as coffee or soap. [...] Intensely smelling substances, for example ammonia, may lead to the activation of pain receptors (nociceptors) of the trigeminal nerve that are located in the nasal cavity and this can confound olfactory testing.|$|E
500|$|Cranial nerves are {{generally}} named {{according to their}} structure or function. For example, the <b>olfactory</b> <b>nerve</b> (I) supplies smell, and the facial nerve (VII) supplies motor innervation to the face. Because Latin was the lingua franca (common language) {{of the study of}} Anatomy when the nerves were first documented, recorded, and discussed, many nerves maintain Latin or Greek names, including the trochlear nerve (IV), named according to its structure, as it supplies a muscle that attaches to a pulley (...) [...] The trigeminal nerve (V) is named in accordance with its three components ( [...] meaning s), and the vagus nerve (X) is named for its wandering course (...) [...]|$|E

6000|$|In such a mammal as a Beaver (Fig. 29), a line ('a b'.) {{drawn through}} the bones, termed basioccipital, basisphenoid, and presphenoid, is very long in {{proportion}} to the extreme length of the cavity which contains the cerebral hemispheres ('g h'.). The plane of the occipital foramen ('b c'.) forms a slightly acute angle with this 'basicranial axis,' while the plane of the tentorium ('i T'.) is inclined at rather more than 90 degrees to the 'basicranial axis'; and so is the plane of the perforated plate ('a d'.), by which the filaments of the <b>olfactory</b> <b>nerve</b> leave the skull.

6000|$|Mr. Smith's {{estimate}} {{of the number of}} dogs in this country at 7,000,000 is a [...] "conservative" [...] one, it must be confessed, and can hardly have been based on observations by moonlight in a suburban village; his {{estimate of}} the effective strength of the average dog at 500 pounds is probably about right, as will be attested by any intelligent boy who in campaigns against orchards has experienced detention by the Cerberi of the places. Taking his own figures Mr. Smith calculates that {{we have in this country}} 3,500,000,000 pounds of [...] "idle dog power." [...] But this statement is more ingenious than ingenuous; it gives, as doubtless it was intended to give, the impression that we have only idle dogs, whereas of all mundane forces the domestic dog is most easily stirred to action. His expense of energy in pursuit of the harmless, necessary flea, for example, is prodigious; and he is not infrequently seen in chase of his own tail, with an activity scarcely inferior. If there is anything worth while in accepted theories of the conversion and conservation of force these gigantic energies are by no means wasted; they appear as heat, light and electricity, modifying climate, reducing gas bills and assisting in propulsion of street cars. Even in baying the moon and insulting visitors and bypassers the dog releases a certain amount of vibratory force which through various mutations of its wave-length, may do its part in cooking a steak or gratifying the <b>olfactory</b> <b>nerve</b> by throwing fresh perfume on the violet. Evidently the commercial advantages of deposing the dog from the position of Exalted Personage and subduing him to that of Motor would not be all clear gain. He would no longer have the spirit to send, Whitmanwise, his barbarous but beneficent yawp over the housetops, nor the leisure to throw off vast quantities of energy by centrifugal efforts at the conquest of his tail. As to the fleas, he would accept them with apathetic satisfaction as preventives of thought upon his fallen fortunes.|$|E
5000|$|Lesions to the <b>olfactory</b> <b>nerve</b> {{can occur}} because of [...] "blunt trauma", such as coup-contra-coup damage, meningitis, and {{tumors of the}} frontal lobe of the brain. These {{injuries}} often lead to a reduced ability to taste and smell. Lesions of the <b>olfactory</b> <b>nerve</b> do {{not lead to a}} reduced ability to sense pain from the nasal epithelium. This is because pain from the nasal epithelium is not carried to the central nervous system by the <b>olfactory</b> <b>nerve</b> - it is carried to the central nervous system by the trigeminal nerve.|$|E

We hypothesized that cultured OECs {{would be able to}} mount a biologically significant response to bacteria and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). The response of OECs to Escherichia coli (E. coli) and various PAMPs was compared to that of Schwann cells (SCs), astrocytes (ACs), and microglia (MG).

50|$|Through the nose, {{smell is}} induced when {{olfactory}} receptor cells are stimulated by volatile chemicals. The olfactory receptor cells, {{otherwise known as}} the primary olfactory neurons, are in the neuroepithilium.

The information received by the olfactory receptors is transmitted by the <b>olfactory</b> <b>nerves</b> to the <b>olfactory</b> bulb through the cribriform plate. In the <b>olfactory</b> bulb, <b>olfactory</b> <b>nerves</b> make synaptic contact with dendrites of mitral and tufted cells. Efferent neurons of the olfactory bulb become the fibers that form the olfactory tracts, which is directly under the frontal lobes in the brain.
