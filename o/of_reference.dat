40|$|Collections <b>of</b> <b>references</b> are an {{important}} part of scientific and scholarly work. For many people, collections <b>of</b> <b>references</b> are the most advanced form of formal knowledge representation they are using.

50|$|The {{mechanism}} <b>of</b> <b>references,</b> if varying in implementation, is {{a fundamental}} programming language feature common to nearly all modern programming languages.

40|$|In each of 41 {{research}} {{journals in}} the physical, life, {{and social sciences}} there is a linear relationship between the average number <b>of</b> <b>references</b> and the normalized paper lengths. For most of the journals in a given field, the relationship is the same within statistical errors. For papers of average lengths in different sciences the average number <b>of</b> <b>references</b> is the same within ± 17 %. Because papers of average lengths in various sciences have the same number <b>of</b> <b>references,</b> we conclude that the citation counts to them can be inter-compared within that accuracy. However, review journals are different: after scanning 18 review journals we found that those papers average twice the number <b>of</b> <b>references</b> as research papers of the same lengths. ...|$|R

5|$|In addition, {{to ensure}} that the number of SMCs kept pace with the {{increase}} in voters and hence the number of MPs, the EBRC's terms <b>of</b> <b>reference</b> would state that there should be at least 12 SMCs. The rationale given for these changes was that the GRC scheme would work better and the link between voters and their MPs would be strengthened. In the 2011 general election, SMCs returned to Parliament 12 MPs and 15 GRCs a total of 75 MPs.|$|E

5|$|The Imperial War Museum {{originated}} {{during the}} First World War in 1917 as the National War Museum committee, {{formed by the}} British government to record the war effort and sacrifice of Britain and her Empire. The museum opened in 1920, by which point it had been renamed the Imperial War Museum. With {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War, the museum's terms <b>of</b> <b>reference</b> were enlarged to include the conflict. The museum's terms <b>of</b> <b>reference</b> was broadened again in 1953 to include all modern conflicts in which British or Commonwealth forces were engaged. The effect of these expansions of remit was to cause the museum's collections to expand enormously, to the point that many parts of the collection, especially those of aircraft, vehicles and artillery, could not be effectively stored or exhibited. Although the museum's south London home (a nineteenth-century building in Southwark which was previously the Bethlem Royal Hospital) had been extended in 1966, {{by the end of the}} decade the museum was seeking additional space.|$|E

The Interim Committee was not specifically charged with making recommendations on the military use of nuclear weapons but the composition of the committee and the close relationship between the wartime use of nuclear weapons and post-war policies regarding them inevitably led to the Interim Committee's involvement.|$|E
