25|$|Packard soon {{developed}} this basic premise into a manuscript titled The Adventures <b>of</b> <b>You</b> <b>on</b> Sugar Cane Island. He {{set out in}} 1970 to find a publisher but was rejected by nine publishing companies, causing him to shelve the idea. In 1975, {{he was able to}} convince Ray Montgomery, co-owner of Vermont Crossroads Press, to publish the book and it sold 8,000 copies, a large amount for a small local publishing house. The series was later marketed to Pocket Books, where it also sold well, but Montgomery believed that it would sell better if a bigger publisher could be found. After some discussion, Montgomery was able to make a contract for the series with Bantam Books. Packard and Montgomery were selected to write books for the series, including the contracting out of titles to additional authors.|$|E

2500|$|During the 1970s, WHFS would {{broadcast}} {{music that}} other FM Rock stations normally overlooked, including cuts {{as long as}} 20 minutes. Artists like Frank Zappa, Yes, Genesis, Roxy Music and other non-commercial artists of the time were the normal format. If The Beatles were ever played, their more obscure tracks like Tomorrow Never Knows or Blue Jay Way were used instead of familiar tracks like Hey Jude or Lady Madonna. Once the station played all of Revolution 9. The station made a policy of never playing a [...] "hit" [...] and broke with precedent by leaving the playlists strictly up to the DJs. Once in a while the DJs would, as a joke, throw in a Top 40 hit just to throw the listeners off. Sometimes, late at night, the DJ might announce [...] "and now we'll repeat that for those <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>on</b> drugs," [...] and immediately replay the last song. It furthered the careers of then-undiscovered stars Bruce Springsteen, George Thorogood and Emmylou Harris, who sometimes {{showed up at the}} studio. WHFS played the records of many local groups as well, including The Nighthawks, The Slickee Boys, Black Market Baby, The Diversions, Tru Fax & the Insaniacs, Bad Brains and Root Boy Slim and the Sex Change Band." ...|$|E
