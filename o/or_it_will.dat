25|$|If {{struck by}} an opponent's shinai, this {{technique}} sweeps up their shinai in a rising-slide motion, {{with the right}} (ura) or left (omote) side of the shinai. Then strike {{in the direction of}} their shinai, or at the suki resulting from their composure's collapse. This technique needs to be smooth. That is, don't separate the rising-slide motion and the upward-sweeping motion <b>or</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> not be successful. Valid strikes include: men-suriage-men, kote-suriage-men, men-suriage-do, kote-suriage-kote, and tsuki-suriage-men.|$|E
25|$|Frequently, {{building}} additions {{will not}} be strongly connected to the existing structure, but simply placed adjacent to it, with only minor continuity in flooring, siding, and roofing. As a result, the addition may have a different resonant period than the original structure, and they may easily detach from one another. The relative motion will then cause the two parts to collide, causing severe structural damage. Seismic modification will either tie the two building components rigidly together so that they behave as a single mass <b>or</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> employ dampers to expend the energy from relative motion, with appropriate allowance for this motion, such as increased spacing and sliding bridges between sections.|$|E

25|$|If {{a single}} photon is emitted into the entry port of the {{apparatus}} at the lower-left corner, it immediately encounters a beam-splitter. Because {{of the equal}} probabilities for transmission or reflection the photon will either continue straight ahead, be reflected by the mirror at the lower-right corner, and be detected by the detector {{at the top of}} the apparatus, <b>or</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be reflected by the beam-splitter, strike the mirror in the upper-left corner, and emerge into the detector at the right edge of the apparatus. Observing that photons show up in equal numbers at the two detectors, experimenters generally say that each photon has behaved as a particle from the time of its emission to the time of its detection, has traveled by either one path or the other, and further affirm that its wave nature has not been exhibited.|$|E
25|$|The {{specific}} myelin damage {{resulting from}} B12 deficiency, {{even in the}} presence of adequate folate and methionine, is more specifically and clearly a vitamin deficiency problem. It has been connected to B12 most directly by reactions related to MUT, which is absolutely required to convert methylmalonyl coenzyme A into succinyl coenzyme A. Failure of this second reaction to occur results in elevated levels of MMA, a myelin destabilizer. Excessive MMA will prevent normal fatty acid synthesis, <b>or</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be incorporated into fatty acids itself rather than normal malonic acid. If this abnormal fatty acid subsequently is incorporated into myelin, the resulting myelin will be too fragile, and demyelination will occur. Although the precise mechanism or mechanisms are not known with certainty, the result is subacute combined degeneration of the central nervous system and spinal cord. Whatever the cause, it is known that B12 deficiency causes neuropathies, even if folic acid is present in good supply, and therefore anemia is not present.|$|E
25|$|Jimmy {{manages to}} swerve and drives off while the Viperox chase after them. Helicopters fly over head and fire at flying Viperox. Stark is annoyed {{that they are}} losing, when Lord Azlok storms in and tries to get the truth of where the Doctor is. The Doctor and Seruba have escaped the vault and drive a Jeep to the base, where they see that it's under heavy attack. The Doctor is worried about getting in until Jimmy and Cassie show up with the TARDIS. The TARDIS materialises in the room in Area 51 where Rivesh is dying. In the nick of time, Seruba revives Rivesh. The Doctor asks for the device to be {{activated}} and Rivesh relishes the thought of killing the Viperox. However, the Doctor warns him not to detonate it, <b>or</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> completely wipe the Viperox out. Rivesh remains adamant on revenge, but the Doctor reinstates his beliefs and tells him that no-one should {{have the power to}} exterminate an entire species. Rivesh returns the favour of his revival and trusts the Doctor with the device. The Doctor uses his sonic screwdriver on it and then he rushes into the TARDIS and grabs a cable. At that moment, Azlok holds Jimmy hostage {{at the entrance to the}} TARDIS, threatening to kill him if the Doctor detonates it. The Doctor says he isn't going to set it off and explains that one day the Viperox will become a peace-loving race. Azlok dismisses this as madness and advances, but the Doctor connects a cable from the TARDIS console to the device and unleashes a deafening soundwave that affects all the Viperox in the area: the Doctor then orders the Viperox to leave Earth and never return. A furious Azlok vows that the Doctor's time will come, though the Doctor dismisses the warning of his impending death, before Azlok and the rest of the Viperox retreat and flee from Earth. After the attack, Stark thanks the Doctor and Seruba and Rivesh leave in their ship. The Doctor leaves the weapon with Stark in case the Viperox ever return, and Stark warns them to keep quiet about the events. The Doctor suggests that Cassie and Jimmy clear up the Viperox mess. As the TARDIS departs, Cassie and Jimmy hold hands.|$|E

500|$|Whitman {{opposed the}} {{extension}} of slavery in the United States and supported the Wilmot Proviso. At first he was opposed to abolitionism, believing the movement did more harm than good. In 1846, he wrote that the abolitionists had, in fact, slowed the advancement of their cause by their [...] " [...] and officiousness". [...] His main concern was that their methods disrupted the democratic process, as did the refusal of the Southern states to put {{the interests of the}} nation as a whole above their own. In 1856, in his unpublished The Eighteenth Presidency, addressing the men of the South, he wrote [...] "you are either to abolish slavery <b>or</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> abolish you". Whitman also subscribed to the widespread opinion that even free African-Americans should not vote and was concerned at the increasing number of African-Americans in the legislature. Whitman shared the racial prejudices of his time and place and thought of black people as [...] "servile, shiftless, ignorant, and given to stealing, although he would remember individual blacks of his youth in positive terms".|$|E

According to Griffiths, [...] "the principal flute is caught {{as if in a}} hall of mirrors, its line imitated in what the other flutes play, and then in the contributions of the larger ensemble." [...] The title of the work is a quotation from André Breton’s L’Amour fou: [...] "convulsive beauty will be erotic-veiled, exploding-fixed, magic-circumstantial, <b>or</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> not be."

At noon, on September 16, 1920, a terrorist bomb exploded in front of the bank, injuring 400 and killing 38. Shortly before the bomb went off, a warning note was placed in a mailbox at the corner of Cedar Street and Broadway. The warning read: [...] "Remember we will not tolerate any longer. Free the political prisoners <b>or</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be sure death for all of you. American Anarchists Fighters."
