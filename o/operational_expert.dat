40|$|The {{number of}} {{designed}} knowledge based systems largely exceeds {{the number of}} <b>operational</b> <b>expert</b> systems. One {{of the main reasons}} for this is that knowledge bases still suffer from major difficulties to represent, organize, validate and manage knowledge in an appropriate manner. Research has shown that decision tables can offer a solution in many of these problem areas. However, as the number of actions and conditions contained in the knowledge increase, decision tables quickly become very large and complex. Such large and complex decision tables nullify the advantage of a good overview and suffer from the same flaws as large and unstructured sets of data. More especially the maintenance of a large decision table can lead to redundancy and conflicting information due to update anomalies In this paper a structuring process is proposed equivalent to normalization rules in relational database design, based on the correspondence between functional dependencies in database design and logical implication.

In this paper we define and formalize the task of automatically determining an expert profile of a person from a heterogeneous corpus made up of a large organization’s intranet. We propose multiple models for addressing the topical profiling task. Our main methods build on ideas from information retrieval, while refinements bring in filtering (allowing an area into a person’s profile only if she is among the top ranking experts in the area). An evaluation based on the W 3 C-corpus made available by TREC, shows significant improvements of the refined methods over the baseline. We apply our profiling algorithms to significantly enhance the performance of a state-ofthe-art expert finding algorithm and to help users of an <b>operational</b> <b>expert</b> search system find the person they would contact, given a specific problem, topic or information need.

40|$|Spacecraft {{analysts in}} the {{spacecraft}} control {{center for the}} Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) satellite are currently utilizing a fault-isolation expert system developed {{to assist in the}} isolation and correction of faults in the communications link. This system, the communication link expert assistance resource (CLEAR), monitors real time spacecraft and ground systems performance parameters in search of configuration discrepancies and communications link problems. If such a discrepancy or problem is isolated, CLEAR alerts the analyst and provides advice on how to resolve the problem swiftly and effectively. The CLEAR system is the first real time expert system {{to be used in the}} operational environment of a satellite control center at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. Clear has not only demonstrated the utility and potential of an expert system in the demanding environment of a satellite control center, but also has revealed many of the pitfalls and deficiencies of development of expert systems. One of the lessons learned from this and other initial expert system projects is that prototypes can often be developed quite rapidly, but <b>operational</b> <b>expert</b> systems require considerable effort. Development is generally a slow, tedious process that typically requires the special skills of trained programmers. Due to the success of CLEAR and several other systems in the control center domain, a large number of expert systems will certainly be developed to support control center operations during the early 1990 's. To facilitate the development of these systems, a project was initiated to develop an integrated, domain-specific tool, the generic spacecraft analyst assistent (GenSAA), that alows the spacecraft analysts to rapidly create simple expert systems themselves. By providing a highly graphical point-and-select method of system development, GenSAA allows the analyst to utilize and/or modify previously developed rule bases and system components; thus, facilitating software reuse and reducing development time and effort...|$|E

Simulations also indicated that this impact could be mitigated by pre-planning pop-up flights prior to departure, using their take-off time estimates. This will, however, only be beneficial when these estimates are sufficiently accurate. With currently achievable accuracies, and using currently available systems, it is better to discard these estimates in the context of extended arrival management. Control & Simulatio...|$|R

40|$|The {{socio-economic}} impact of mass movements for {{our society is}} {{getting more and more}} serious. The loss of lives and economic losses are now ten times greater than they were {{at the beginning of the}} decade. In the hope of reducing these impacts, it is essential to adopt a preventive policy that will encourage mapping of mass movement susceptibility level (MMSL) in critical zones. However, this task is complex and only experts using present techniques can provide satisfactory results. To make possible the production of these maps by a larger number of individuals, we have developed an expert system called EXPERIM that uses remote sensing data and geographic information systems to facilitate the complex tasks without requiring the user to be highly competent in this field of study. This thesis presents the results obtained from a complete strategy developed for a region surrounding Cochabamba, Bolivia. The <b>operational</b> <b>expert</b> system prototype will soon be integrated within the watershed management program directed by the local executing organisation PROMIC. The knowledge acquisition and its expression in concrete terms constitute the principal axis of this research, while the results obtained are the heart of the EXPERIM expert system. These strategic steps aim to establish a knowledge base of data and rules that describe field conditions for each MMSL. We have been able to extract this information by using binary discriminant analysis of a MMSL map produced by an expert for a pilot zone called Cuenca Taquiäna, which is geoecologically representative of the 38 neighbouring watersheds. Using this technique, we were able to establish a sensitivity model that recreates the expert's map with a success rate of 89 % and 78 % when two or three MMS levels are used. Based on a detailed analysis of the susceptibility model it was evident that stability conditions are the result of the topographic, geologic and geomorphologic environments. The level of susceptibility was found to be independent of the vegetation condition. In order to apply the model to the surrounding watersheds, we integrated remotely sensed data within the spatial database to map the presence/absence of five essential geoecological units required by the susceptibility model. This was done using a hierarchical classification method. Three sensors were evaluated: Landsat, SPOT and RADARSAT. In the elaboration of this specific step, we evaluated the most efficient spectral band combinations within each image and between images for each of the five geoecological units. For each of the land cover types, the analysis shows that LANDSAT constitutes the most powerful sensor to map these units and that image fusion does not provide significantly better results when compared to the extra amount of work that this requires. Using remote sensing data instead of field data or airphotograph interpretation in watersheds where only topographic data are available decreases the level of accuracy by less than 10 %...|$|E

40|$|This study investigates global career {{self-management}} {{behaviors of}} staff in an international governmental organization (IGO). The literature on global careers argues that individuals should maximize their career capital, operationalized in the intelligent careers (IC) concept as competencies, social networks, and motivations of persons related to their careers. The IC concept implies that career capital is transferable and argues that IC components are interrelated and self-reinforcing. We explored these assumptions through {{a case study in}} a United Nations (UN) organization. Using the IC framework we undertook 29 semi-structured interviews with international assignees, HR, and <b>operational</b> <b>experts</b> and conducted one focus group discussion with seven staffing coordinators. We found that the UN organization had high barriers to career capital transfer between head office and field stations. Therefore, the IGO staff experienced conflicting demands in terms of their career capital behaviors. Many staff did not focus on maximizing their career-relevant capabilities or social networks. Instead, they pursued international careers that intentionally sacrificed internal career progression in favor of their humanitarian aid duties. The research adds to the insights of the global careers literature and refines our understanding of the relationship of the organizational center to its foreign affiliates. The findings expose potentially contradictory behavioral implications of elements of the IC concept and call for a context-sensitive refinement.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedOver the years wargames {{have been used}} by decision makers and <b>operational</b> <b>experts</b> to gain insight into not only how an operation could expect to unfold, but also in unveiling gaps in capabilities of a plan or concept of operation. While most of these games focus on war, the Peace Game focuses on helping planners gain insight as to how Security Force Assistance (SFA) and Security Cooperation (SC) operations may unfold. The Peace Game attempts to model population behavior in a specific region. In the past, movement of the masses has been used as an indicator of regional stability. This thesis concentrates on assessing the migration algorithm within the Peace Game. While the current algorithm does a satisfactory job of simulating migration, it can be made better. The suggested improvements in the Peace Game focus on three models (two types of models). There are two regression models; one that models population deaths over time and another that models displaced persons over time. The third model is roughly based on a compounding interest model. This model is known as the Population Attrition Model (PAM) and is applied to both deaths and displaced persons. All of the models are grounded in an analysis of historical data from over 40 conflicts. All of the models are an improvement in simulating the reality of population migration in regions of conflict.

This is in part due to the expectation that communication quality between the ground and exploration crews will be more limited and delayed.
