5|$|In {{addition}} to the repeating A or N modulation signal, each transmitting station would also transmit its two-letter Morse code identifier once every thirty seconds for positive identification. The station identification would be sent twice: first on the N pair of transmitters, then on the A, to ensure coverage in all quadrants. Also, in some installations local weather conditions were periodically broadcast in voice over the range frequency, preempting the navigational signals, but eventually this was done <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>central</b> fifth tower.|$|E

5|$|Maunsell was {{appointed}} CME {{of the newly}} formed Southern Railway in 1923, and inherited the 1920 SECR order for ten Kclass locomotives. The order was still outstanding in 1924, {{although most of the}} component parts had been made. On 14 January 1925, Maunsell ordered No.790 to be overhauled and trialled <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Central</b> section. As the locomotive proved suitable for the operating conditions of this section, the Southern Railway's Locomotive Committee proceeded with the assembly of the Kclass parts using outside contractors. Nine sets of parts (Nos. A791A799) were conveyed to Armstrong Whitworth for assembly and the finished locomotives delivered in May and June 1925. These were dual-fitted with vacuum and Westinghouse (air) brakes for use with the former London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LBSCR) rolling stock <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Central</b> section. Other differences from the prototype included the relocation of the regulator to the dome and an increase in superheater area. The tenth set of parts was retained by Ashford and used for the first member of the K1class later that year.|$|E
