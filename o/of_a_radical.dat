5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1770s, Johnson {{had become}} an {{established}} publisher. Writers—particularly Dissenters—sought him out, and his home started to become the centre <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>radical</b> and stimulating intellectual milieu. Because he was willing to publish multiple opinions on issues, he was respected as a publisher by writers from across the political spectrum. Johnson published many Unitarian works, but he also issued works criticizing them; although he was an abolitionist, he also published works arguing in favour of the slave trade; he supported inoculation, but he also published works critical of the practice.|$|E
5|$|In clitoridectomy, the {{clitoris}} may {{be removed}} as part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>radical</b> vulvectomy to treat cancer such as vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia; however, modern treatments favor more conservative approaches, as invasive surgery can have psychosexual consequences. Clitoridectomy more often involves {{parts of the}} clitoris being partially or completely removed during FGM, which may be additionally known as female circumcision or female genital cutting (FGC). Removing the glans of the clitoris {{does not mean that}} the whole structure is lost, since the clitoris reaches deep into the genitals.|$|E
5|$|The son <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>radical</b> public {{speaker and}} orator, Grimshaw's early campaigns were centred on the {{improvement}} of working conditions for the mill-workers {{in the village of}} Royton and enforcement of the Factory Acts. He was an outspoken critic of the Whig Party and an advocate of the Chartist movement, in particular of their anti-Whig alliance with the Tory Party. Strikes among mill-workers began to break out during the early 1850s and Grimshaw was one of the leaders, along with George Cowell, of the strike in Preston in 1853. The strikers were fruitless in their demands for a ten per cent wage increase, and Grimshaw found himself with no further role in the workers' unions. He and his fellow conspirators were charged with conspiring to prevent people working in the mills, although the charges were later dropped.|$|E

25|$|Stephenson's first novel, The Big U, {{published}} in 1984, was a satirical take on life at American Megaversity, a vast, bland and alienating research university beset by chaotic riots.

Neither novel attracted much critical attention on first publication, but showcased concerns that Stephenson would further develop {{in his later}} work.|$|E

25|$|This {{committee}} was originally concerned with investigating pro-German sentiments in the American liquor industry. After World War I ended in November 1918 and the German threat lessened, the committee began investigating Bolshevism, which had {{appeared as a}} threat during the First Red Scare after the Russian Revolution in 1917. The committee's hearing into Bolshevik propaganda, conducted February 11 to March 10, 1919, had a decisive role in constructing an image <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>radical</b> threat to the United States during the first Red Scare.|$|E
25|$|Plasma {{contains}} many {{species such as}} ions, free radicals and electrons, so {{it is important to}} look at what contributes to the polymerization process most. The first suggested process by Westwood et al. was that of a cationic polymerization, since in a direct current system polymerization occurs mainly on the cathode. However, more investigation has led to the belief that the mechanism is more <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>radical</b> polymerization process, since radicals tend to be trapped in the films, and termination can be overcome by reinitiation of oligomers. Other kinetic studies also appear to support this theory.|$|E
25|$|After the {{conservative}} interlude of the Francis and Kerferd governments, Berry assumed {{leadership of the}} liberals and became Premier and Treasurer in August 1875. But the liberal majority in the Assembly was unreliable, and in October the government's budget was defeated and Berry resigned. He asked the Governor, Sir George Bowen, for a dissolution, but was refused. He then campaigned across the colony {{in opposition to the}} third McCulloch government. At the May 1877 election, with the powerful backing of the Melbourne Age under David Syme, he won a huge liberal majority in the Assembly and returned to office at the head <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>radical</b> ministry.|$|E
