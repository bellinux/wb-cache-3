5|$|Reference is {{the notion}} that a word symbolizes or stands in for an object, action, <b>or</b> <b>event.</b> Words {{consistently}} stand for their referents, even if referents are not physically present in context.|$|E
5|$|The {{function}} of adverbs is {{to modify the}} action <b>or</b> <b>event</b> described by the verb by providing additional information about {{the manner in which}} it occurs. Many adverbs are derived from adjectives with the suffix -ly, but not all, and many speakers tend to omit the suffix in the most commonly used adverbs. For example, in the phrase the woman walked quickly the adverb quickly derived from the adjective quick describes the woman's way of walking. Some commonly used adjectives have irregular adverbial forms, such as good which has the adverbial form well.|$|E

5|$|Also, then 32 year-old San Luis Obispo-born swimmer Virginia Farmer {{represented}} American Samoa at the Beijing Olympics. Farmer was {{the only}} American Samoan in her event. Additionally, prior to Beijing, she had not participated in any Olympic games <b>or</b> <b>event.</b> The preliminary round for the event took place on August 15, and Virginia Farmer participated in the fourth heat. She finished the race in 28.82seconds, ranking third behind Swaziland's Senele Dlamini (28.70seconds) and ahead of Bolivia's Katerine Moreno (29.05seconds). The leader of Virginia's heat was Mozambique's Ximene Gomes (28.15seconds). Out of the 92 participating athletes, Farmer ranked 62nd. She also did not progress to later rounds.|$|E
5|$|In all {{games from}} the second onwards, the player will gain access {{to a series of}} (predominantly 8-bit) minigames, {{sometimes}} randomly after death, as in the second game, and sometimes once the player has completed a specific task. These minigames usually tell a story <b>or</b> <b>event</b> relevant to the game's lore, although mostly presented in a cryptic way. For example, minigames in Five Nights at Freddy's 2 are speculated to portray the homicidal incidents previously mentioned in the games. Minigames in Five Nights at Freddy's 4 tell the story of a character, possibly the player character, who dies in a tragic accident.|$|E
5|$|Ricardo Chambers {{represented}} Jamaica in the men's 400meters dash. Born in Trelawny Parish on Jamaica's northern shores, Chambers attended Florida State University and {{competed in}} Beijing {{at the age}} of 23 both in this event and in the men's 4 x 400meters relay. The sprinter had not previously competed in any Olympic games <b>or</b> <b>event.</b> The qualification round of the event took place on August 17; Ricardo Chambers participated in the fourth heat, finishing his race in 45.22seconds. He placed third ahead of Dominica's Erison Hurtault (46.10seconds) but behind Great Britain's Martyn Rooney (45.00seconds) and Australia's Sean Wroe (45.17seconds). Out of the 55 finishing athletes, Chambers tied the United States' David Neville for 13th place. He progressed to the semifinals, which took place on August 19.|$|E

5|$|Ricardo Lynch {{represented}} Jamaica as its sole cyclist at the Beijing Olympics. Born in 1984, Lynch was 23 {{years old}} at the time of his participation in Beijing, representing the Caribbean island in the men's keirin event. He had not previously competed in any Olympic games <b>or</b> <b>event.</b> Having not initially qualified for the event, Lynch was given a second chance in the third heat of the August 15 repechage round against three other cyclists. He ranked third between the Ukraine's second place finalist Andrii Vynokurov and Russia's fourth place finalist Sergey Polynskiy. The heat leader, Kiyofumi Nagai of Japan, won the repechage heat and advanced to the next round. Lynch did not progress.|$|E
5|$|Track {{and field}} events {{are divided into}} three broad categories: track events, field events, and {{combined}} events. The majority of athletes tend to specialise in just one event (<b>or</b> <b>event</b> type) {{with the aim of}} perfecting their performances, although the aim of combined events athletes is to become proficient in a number of disciplines. Track events involve running on a track over a specified distances and—in the case of the hurdling and steeplechase events—obstacles may be placed on the track. There are also relay races in which teams of athletes run and pass on a baton to their team member {{at the end of a}} certain distance.|$|E
5|$|Commemorations are for {{individuals}} or events {{which have been}} noteworthy {{in the life of}} the Church and in the history of Lutheranism in particular. These days do not take precedence over any other festival day, and if there is a conflict between a commemoration and a festival of any other rank, the commemoration is generally transferred to the next open weekday. If a commemoration falls on a Sunday where the color of the day is green, the collect for which that individual <b>or</b> <b>event</b> belong to could be said before the daily collect/prayer of the day or in place of it. For example, if September 13 fell on a Sunday and there was a desire to commemorate St. John Chrysostom, the pastor would recite the common of theologians and then the prayer of the day or the common of theologians on its own. The person may also be mentioned by name in the prayers of the faithful in addition to recitation of the applicable collect. Finally, their lives might be summarized or their teachings related to the day's lessons in some way.|$|E

5|$|Mu {{waves are}} thought to be {{indicative}} of an infant’s developing ability to imitate. This is important because the ability to imitate plays a vital {{role in the development of}} motor skills, tool use, and understanding causal information through social interaction. Mimicking is integral in the development of social skills and understanding nonverbal cues. Causal relationships can be made through social learning without requiring experience firsthand. In action execution, mu waves are present in both infants and adults before and after the execution of a motor task and its accompanying desynchronization. While executing a goal-oriented action, however, infants exhibit a higher degree of desynchronization than do adults. Just as with an action execution, during action observation infants’ mu waves not only show a desynchronization, but show a desynchronization greater in degree than the one evidenced in adults. This tendency for changes in degree of desynchronization, rather than actual changes in frequency, becomes the measure for mu wave development throughout adulthood, although the most changes take place during the first year of life. Understanding the mechanisms that are shared between action perception and execution in the earliest years of life has implications for language development. Learning and understanding through social interaction comes from imitating movements as well as vowel sounds. Sharing the experience of attending to an object <b>or</b> <b>event</b> with another person can be a powerful force in the development of language.|$|E
25|$|If event <b>or</b> <b>event</b> chain {{occurs during}} the course of a project, it may require some {{mitigation}} effort. In some cases, mitigation plans can be generated. Mitigation plans are an activity or group of activities (small schedule) that augment the project schedule if a certain event occurs. The solution is to assign the mitigation plan to an event <b>or</b> <b>event</b> chain. These small schedules will be triggered when an event chain occurs. The same mitigation plan can be used for different events.|$|E
