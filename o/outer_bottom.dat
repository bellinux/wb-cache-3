2500|$|However, {{the crew}} was alarmed by the thunder-like sound of the waves {{slamming}} against her flat bottom. Reed and Vogak wrote that at times {{it sounded as if}} the ship had hit a hard rock. Around 10 a.m. of the next day the hull cracked, the space between inner and <b>outer</b> <b>bottoms</b> was flooded, and Vogak rushed his ship to a safe anchorage in Ferrol. The divers discovered a five-meter-long dent and numerous cracks in the fore segment of the hull which were ultimately blamed on waves. Popov concurred and admitted his failure [...] "to foresee the effects of shallow draft". He wrote that the damage had dual mechanism: first, when the flat pontoon pitched above the waves, gravity subjected it to an enormous stress, bending the whole structure down. Next, as it plummeted down, the flat bottom hit water head-on, rupturing the rivets and tearing off the crossbeams. Reed noted that the radial framing pattern chosen by the designers resulted in a strong center section and inadequately weak extremities, and that any experienced shipbuilder should have discovered this weakness in advance.|$|R

40|$|Indonesian {{mangosteen}} is prospective {{product to}} be exported to Europe, Middle East, East Asia such asTaiwan,Hong Kong,Singapore, andJapan. Indonesian exported commodities increase significantly {{from year to}} year, but the increasing volume was not followed by improvement in production {{and quality of the}} fruit.   Mangosteen has symmetrical branches which form dense canopy that protect sun radiation intensity to penetrate, and it keeps the radiation intensity remain below normal of its need. Most of harvested mangosteen plants owned by the community were not managed properly. It cause the production and quality of the fruit below standard. The research aims at : (1) knowing  the position of the buds and fruit at various branch within the canopy, (2) collecting information about distribution of production and quality of the fruit.        The research was done on September 2003 to May 2004 at the center of mangosteen fruit production inWest Java, i. e. Sub district of Wanayasa, District of Purwakarta.   The research was done on randomized complete block design which consist of nine sectors of branches with seven replications. The nine sectors are : sector 1 (inner bottom canopy), sector 2 (center bottom canopy), sector 3 (<b>outer</b> <b>bottom</b> canopy), sector 4 (inner middle canopy), sector 5 (center middle canopy), sector 6 (outer middle canopy), sector 7 (inner top canopy), sector 8 (center top canopy), sector 9 (outer top canopy).

Sector 6 (outer middle canopy), produce more vegetative branches. Dense canopy structure of upper branches has protect inner and bottom canopy from light availability. At average, the quality of the fruit are below standard. In Wanayasa, only 0. 6 - 0. 7 % of the fruit meet the quality of Super SNI which produced especially on sector 4 and sector 5.

40|$|Simulation {{methods can}} be used for meeting both the new stealth {{initiatives}} for surface ship silencing, and the stringent limits on acceptable hull vibration. Additionally, interior noise concerns must be considered due to habitability and operational readiness. The pursuit of innovative ship designs, utilization of new materials, and the increasingly demanding performance requirements, dictate a more broadly focused thrust for addressing noise and vibration issues due to multiple sources of excitation during the design process. This expanded technical view also requires that the types of tools utilized for these assessments also improve and that they can provide results within a short enough time that can affect the design cycle. An Energy Finite Element Analysis (EFEA) formulation has been developed for computing efficiently the vibration of complex vehicles and the associated radiated noise at frequencies beyond the limits of conventional finite element methods. In this paper, the main theoretical aspects of the EFEA will be presented first.

40|$|Up to 60 % {{of storage}} tanks in {{operation}} have uneven {{settlement of the}} <b>outer</b> <b>bottom</b> contour, which often leads to accidents. Russian and foreign regulatory documents have different requirements for strain limits of metal structures. There is an increasing need for harmonizing regulatory documents. The {{aim of this study}} is to theoretically justify and to assess the possibility of applying the U. S. standards for specifying the allowable settlement of storage tanks used in Russia. The allowable uneven settlement was calculated for a vertical steel tank (VST- 20000) according to API- 653, a standard of the American Petroleum Institute. The calculated allowable settlement levels were compared with those established by Russian standards. Based on the finite element method, the uneven settlement development process of a storage tank was modeled. Stress-strain state parameters of tank structures were obtained at the critical levels established in API- 653. Relationships of maximum equivalent stresses in VST metal structures to the vertical settlement component for settlement zones of 6 to 72 m in length were determined. When the uneven settlement zone is 6 m in length, the limit state is found to be caused by 30 -mm vertical settlement, while stresses in the wall exceed 330 MPa. When the uneven settlement zone is 36 m in length, stresses reach the yield point only at 100 -mm vertical settlement...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{intricate}} buckling patterns which can form when a viscous drop impacts {{a much lower}} viscosity miscible pool. The drop enters the pool by its impact inertia, flattens, and sinks by its own weight while stretching into a hemispheric bowl. Upward motion along the <b>outer</b> <b>bottom</b> surface of this bowl produces a vortical boundary layer which separates along its top and rolls up into a vortex ring. The vorticity is therefore produced in a fundamentally different way than for a drop impacting a pool of the same liquid. The vortex ring subsequently advects into the bowl, thereby stretching the drop liquid into ever thinner sheets, reaching the micron level. The rotating motion around the vortex pulls in folds to form multiple windings of double-walled toroidal viscous sheets. The axisymmetric velocity field thereby stretches the drop liquid into progressively finer sheets, which are susceptible to both axial and azimuthal compression-induced buckling. The azimuthal buckling of the sheets tends to occur {{on the inner side}} of the vortex ring, while their folds can be stretched and straightened on the outside edge. We characterize the total stretching from high-speed video imaging and use particle image velocimetry to track the formation and evolution of the vortex ring. The total interfacial area between the drop and the pool liquid can grow over 40 -fold during the first 50 ms after impact. Increasing pool viscosity shows entrapment of a large bubble on top of the drop, while lowering the drop viscosity produces intricate buckled shapes, appearing at the earliest stage and being promoted by the crater motions. We also present an image collage of the most intriguing and convoluted structures observed. Finally, a simple point-vortex model reproduces some features from the experiments and shows variable stretching along the wrapping sheets...|$|E
