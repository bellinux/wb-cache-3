These numbers were modeled from an arthropod as pre-motor elements in the motor control system. They were located in the abdominal region. Synapses are known as gaps between neurons which facilitate the spread of a message via neurotransmitters that may excite or depress the subsequent neuron through a complex cascade of electrochemical events. For the interneurons exhibiting one-way signaling, they would receive an excitatory stimulus, experimentally, and the post-synaptic cell was given an inhibitory signal. The interaction between the two cells was modulatory in which the pre-synaptic cell with the initial excitatory signal would mediate the postsynaptic cell even after being inhibited.

This paper presents {{for the first time}} simulations of the January South American climate using a limited area model; previous similar studies simulated only the July climate. The goal {{of this study was to}} examine the capability of the CSIRO Mk 2 - DARLAM nested modeling system for simulating the climate in the South American region. Further, it was desired to investigate whether the higher resolution of DARLAM improves the simulated climate over various subregions, compared with the GCM and observations. With this purpose, a representative set of variables was analyzed and statistically compared. Overall, the fields simulated by the nesting system provide a better representation of the South American climate than the GCM. In particular, significant improvements are found in the nested model climatology for near-surface temperature and mean sea level pressure. Comparison of the January and July simulations shows a better wintertime performance.

40|$|International audienceSouth-eastern France {{is prone}} to heavy rain events during the autumn. For these extreme {{precipitation}} events, the Mediterranean Sea fuels the atmospheric boundary layer in heat and moisture and sometimes contributes to flooding, owing to the large swell and waves produced in these situations. The {{aim of this study}} is to examine how the severe atmospheric conditions over the sea associated with these events alter the ocean mixed layer, and what feedback the ocean contributes to the precipitation events. To address these questions, a high-resolution air-sea coupled system is developed between the atmospheric MESO-NH model and a one-dimensional ocean model. It is applied for short range (24 h) and high-resolution (2 - 3 km) simulations of three representative torrential rainfall events: 12 - 13 November 1999 (Aude case), 8 - 9 September 2002 (Gard case) and 3 December 2003 (Hérault case). In those meteorological situations characterized by moderate to intense low-level winds, the Mediterranean Sea globally loses energy, to the benefit of the convective precipitating systems. The result is an overall decrease of the thermal content all along the simulation of the events. Significant cooling and deepening of the ocean mixed layer are found in the areas of intense low-level winds. A notable result of the study concerns the impact of the torrential rainfall on the ocean mixed layer. The most important disturbances of the ocean mixed layer are indeed found underneath the heavy precipitation. The salt content is decreased all along the ocean mixed layer depth, but more significantly in the first ten metres near the air-sea interface, with the formation of a salt barrier. By performing both two-way and one-way coupled simulations, it is found that the interactive coupling tends to moderate both the atmospheric and ocean responses compared with the <b>one-way</b> <b>mode.</b> The differences between the two-way and one-way coupled simulations are, however, found to be relatively small considering the atmospheric short-range forecast...|$|E
40|$|To find {{a better}} {{confidence}} region is always of interest in statistics. One way to find better confidence regions is to uniformly improve coverage probability over the usual confidence region while maintaining the same volume. Thus, the classical spherical confidence regions for the mean vector of a multivariate normal distribution have been improved by changing the point estimator for the parameterIn 1961, James and Stein found a shrinkage estimator having total mean square error, TMSE, smaller {{than that of the}} usual estimator. In 1982, Casella and Hwang gave an analytical proof of the dominance of the confidence sphere which uses the James Stein estimator as its center over the usual confidence sphere centered at the sample mean vector. This opened up new possibilities in multiple comparisonsThis dissertation will focus on simultaneous confidence intervals for treatment means and for the differences between treatment means and the mean of a control in one-way and two-way Analysis of Variance, ANOVA, studies. We make use of Stein-type shrinkage estimators as centers to improve the simultaneous coverage of those confidence intervals. The main obstacle to an analytic study is that the rectangular confidence regions are not rotation invariant like the spherical confidence regions Therefore, we primarily use simulation to show dominance of the rectangular confidence intervals centered around a shrinkage estimator over the usual rectangular confidence regions centered about the sample means. For the one-way ANOVA model, our simulation results indicate that our confidence procedure has higher coverage probability than the usual confidence procedure if the number of means is sufficiently large. We develop a lower bound for the coverage probability of our rectangular confidence region which is a decreasing function of the shrinkage constant for the estimator used as center and use this bound to prove that the rectangular confidence intervals centered around a shrinkage estimator have coverage probability uniformly exceeding that of the usual rectangular confidence regions up to an arbitrarily small epsilon when the number of means is sufficiently large. We show that these intervals have strictly greater coverage probability when all the parameters are zero, and that the coverage probability of the two procedures converge to one another when {{at least one of the}} parameters becomes arbitrarily largeTo check the reliability of our simulations for the one-way ANOVA model, we use numerical integration to calculate the coverage probability for the rectangular confidence regions. Gaussian quadrature making use of Hermite polynomials is used to approximate the coverage probability of our rectangular confidence regions for n= 2, 3, 4. The difference in results between numerical integration and simulations is negligible. However, numerical integration yields values slightly higher than the simulationsA similar approach is applied to develop improved simultaneous confidence intervals for the comparison of treatment means with the mean of a control. We again develop a lower bound for the coverage probability of our confidence procedure and prove results similar to those that we proved for the one-way ANOVA model. We also apply our approach to develop improved simultaneous confidence intervals for the cell means for a two-way ANOVA model.

Amongst other things, the model explains {{the reason for the}} resonant enhancement of the photonic bandgap, which turns out {{to be related to the}} Purcell effect. An extension of this band theoretical approach is then used to study dark-state polaritons in -type atomic media. The second class of unconventional photonic crystal consists of two dimensional photonic crystals that break time-reversal symmetry due to a magneto-optic effect. The band theory for such systems involves topological quantities known as "Chern numbers", which give rise to the phenomenon of disorder-immune <b>one-way</b> edge <b>modes.</b> I describe a system in which time reversal symmetry is broken strongly enough for experimental observation of the <b>one-way</b> edge <b>modes.</b> In addition to numerical studies of this photonic crystal, I develop an analytical effective theory, based on the symmetry of the lattice, that accurately describes its bandstructure. by Y.

The paper analyses a situation of <b>one-way</b> integration <b>mode</b> and information flow and outlines an existing gap in SMEs management approach. In order to succeed on international markets, it is needed to build up a network of awareness and information exchange between major actors such as SMEs, public and business support institutions, academia and other players. The article relates the key attributes of factors directly connected to SMEs and integration as well as concentrates on how SME could benefit from a closer regional economic integration through information exchange...|$|R
