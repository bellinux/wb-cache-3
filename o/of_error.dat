The theory applied for this paper is Error Analysis, Perspectives on Second Language Acquisition (1974) edited by Jack C. Richards. The data of the analysis of this paper are taken from the compositions by the students of SMKN 2 Tegallalang.

5|$|In two years, a {{very precise}} map, drawn on six sheets at a 1/200,000 scale, was produced. In March 1829, {{a base of}} 3,500 meters had been traced in the Argolis, from one angle at the ruins of Tiryns to an angle of a house in ruins {{in the village of}} Aria.

Pierre Peytier and Puillon-Boblaye proceeded to perform numerous verifications on the base and on the rulers used. The margin <b>of</b> <b>error</b> was thus reduced to 1 meter for every 15 kilometers. The longitude and latitude of the base point at Tiryns were read and checked, so that again the margin <b>of</b> <b>error</b> was reduced as far as possible to an estimated 0.2 seconds. 134 geodesic stations were set up on the peninsula’s mountains, as well as on Aegina, Hydra and Nafplion.
