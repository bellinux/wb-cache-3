These factors will govern the quantity and type of dialogue that can take place. The question of whether contact is physical or through electromagnetic signals will also govern the magnitude of the long-term {{implications of}} contact.

25|$|Concepts from {{information}} theory such as redundancy and code control {{have been used}} by semioticians such as Umberto Eco and Ferruccio Rossi-Landi to explain ideology as a form of message transmission whereby a dominant social class emits its message by using signs that exhibit a high degree of redundancy such that only <b>one</b> <b>message</b> is decoded among a selection of competing ones.|$|E
25|$|The {{auditory}} {{findings are}} further concretized by research on shadowing tasks (Cherry, 1966). These tasks involve two distinct auditory messages presented simultaneously to both ears. <b>One</b> <b>message</b> {{in one ear}} {{is supposed to be}} shadowed (repeated) while the other message in the other ear is supposed to be ignored. Participants generally perform well at repeating familiar messages in the attended channel. However, when there was a significant change in frequency in the message in the unattended channel, it was detected; moreover, when their names were presented in the unattended channel, they noticed that as well. These shadowing tasks reinforce the idea that the gap between knowledge and experience is explained by our innate perceptual capacities that enhance our experience and optimize our knowledge gained from our environment.|$|E
25|$|The Germans were {{helped in}} their escape {{by the failure}} of the British Admiralty in London to pass on seven {{critical}} radio intercepts obtained by naval intelligence indicating the true position, course and intentions of the High Seas Fleet during the night. <b>One</b> <b>message</b> was transmitted to Jellicoe at 23:15 that accurately reported the German fleet's course and speed as of 21:14. However, the erroneous signal from earlier in the day that reported the German fleet still in port, and an intelligence signal received at 22:45 giving another unlikely position for the German fleet, had reduced his confidence in intelligence reports. Had the other messages been forwarded, which confirmed the information received at 23:15, or had British ships reported accurately sightings and engagements with German destroyers, cruisers and battleships, then Jellicoe could have altered course to intercept Scheer at the Horns Reef. The unsent intercepted messages had been duly filed by the junior officer left on duty that night, who failed to appreciate their significance. By the time Jellicoe finally learned of Scheer's whereabouts at 04:15, the German fleet was too far away to catch and {{it was clear that the}} battle could no longer be resumed.|$|E

25|$|By 1941, U.S. signals intelligence, {{through the}} Army's Signal Intelligence Service and the Office of Naval Intelligence's OP-20-G, had intercepted and decrypted {{considerable}} Japanese diplomatic and naval cipher traffic, though nothing actually carrying significant information about Japanese military plans in 1940-41. Decryption {{and distribution of}} this intelligence, including such decrypts as were available, was capricious and sporadic, some {{of which can be}} accounted for by lack of resources and manpower. At best, the information available to decision makers in Washington was fragmentary, contradictory, or poorly distributed, and was almost entirely raw, without supporting analysis. It was thus, incompletely understood. Nothing in it pointed directly to an attack at Pearl Harbor, and a lack of awareness of Imperial Navy capabilities led to a widespread underlying belief Pearl Harbor was not a possible attack target. Only <b>one</b> <b>message</b> from the Hawaiian Japanese consulate (sent on 6 December), in a low level consular cipher, included mention of an attack at Pearl; it was not decrypted until 8 December. While the Japanese Diplomatic codes (Purple code) could be read, the current version (JN-25C) of the Japanese Naval code (JN-25) which had replaced JN-25B on 4 December 1941 could not be read until May 1942.|$|E

500|$|Because {{the people}} and {{locations}} used in the film are real but are carefully selected and edited, the film creates a [...] "friction" [...] between [...] documentary reality and narrative fiction. [...] This balancing act between the real and the imaginary has drawn comparisons to neorealist works {{such as those of}} Iranian directors Abbas Kiarostami and Mohsen Makhmalbaf, and Zhang has openly acknowledged the influence of Kiarostami in this film. Zhang Xiaoling of the University of Nottingham argues that Zhang Yimou used the documentary perspective in order to suggest that the story is an accurate reflection of most rural areas in China, while Shelly Kraicer believes that his [...] "simultaneous presentation of seemingly opposing messages" [...] is a powerful artistic method in of itself, and that it allows Zhang to circumvent censors by guaranteeing that the movie will include at least <b>one</b> <b>message</b> that they like. Jean-Michel Frodon of Le Monde maintains that the film was produced [...] "in the shadow of two superpowers" [...] and needed to make compromises with each.|$|E

500|$|In a September 1995 {{speech before}} the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, Clinton argued very forcefully against {{practices}} that abused {{women around the}} world and in the People's Republic of China itself, declaring that [...] "it is no longer acceptable to discuss women's rights as separate from human rights". Delegates from over 180countries heard her say: [...] "If there is <b>one</b> <b>message</b> that echoes forth from this conference, let it be that human rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights, once and for all." [...] In doing so, she resisted both internal administration and Chinese pressure to soften her remarks. The speech became a key moment in the empowerment of women and years later {{women around the world}} would recite Clinton's key phrases. She {{was one of the most}} prominent international figures during the late 1990s to speak out against the treatment of Afghan women by the Taliban. She helped create Vital Voices, an international initiative sponsored by the U.S. to encourage the participation of women in the political processes of their countries. It and Clinton's own visits encouraged women to make themselves heard in the Northern Ireland peace process.|$|E

Frank Spotnitz considered [...] "Milagro" [...] to have been an [...] "underappreciated" [...] episode. For this reason, it was later included on the X-Files Essentials DVD compilation, along with seven other episodes. Scully's portrayal in the episode was given special attention. Stegall noted that [...] "if 'Milagro' has <b>one</b> <b>message</b> about perception, it is shown in Scully, who is seen through everyone's eyes (Mulder, Padgett, even Naciamento) but her own. Ultimately, we can't know which ones of these portraits of her character are 'right'. Maybe none of them are. It's a bravura performance from Gillian Anderson, well matched by Duchovny's low-key Mulder, acting on his instincts.". Handlen argued that the episode reduces Scully [...] "to a victim waiting to find out which handsome man will rescue her." [...] Elyce Rae Helford, in her book Fantasy Girls: Gender in the New Universe of Science Fiction and Fantasy Television, accused the show of [...] "reinforc the stereotype [...] of independent women as lonely, neurotic, and nostalgic for sexual attention from men." [...] Anderson herself felt that the character needed to [...] "loosen up". She was once approached by a fan who applauded Scully as the [...] "epitome of womanhood" [...] because she is a character who [...] "not only can kick ass but she [...] works with Mulder without jumping him." [...] Anderson, in return jokingly replied, [...] "So the epitome of womanhood is sexual restraint? [...] I don't think so." [...] The episode was particularly analyzed by fans of the show, and the fact that Scully was almost seduced provoked [...] "lively internet discussion".|$|E

2500|$|A {{siege of}} Khartoum by the Mahdist forces {{commanded}} by the Mahdi himself started on 18 March 1884. Initially, {{the siege of}} Khartoum was more in nature a blockade rather than a true siege as the Mahdi's forces lacked the strength to wage a proper siege, for example only cutting the telegraphy lines in April 1884. The British had decided to abandon the Sudan, {{but it was clear}} that Gordon had other plans, and the public increasingly called for a relief expedition. Gordon's last telegrams were clearly meant for the British public with <b>one</b> <b>message</b> addressed to Baring reading: [...] "You state your intention of not sending any relief force up here to Berber...I shall hold on here as long as I can, and if I can suppress the rebellion, I shall do so.

2500|$|Many of the {{critiques of}} the Venona {{translations}} {{have been based}} on specific cases. [...] The Schneirs' critique of the Venona documents was based on their decades of work on the case of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg. [...] Another critique of the Venona translations came from the late Rutgers University law professor John Lowenthal, who as a law student worked as a volunteer for Alger Hiss's defense team, and later wrote extensively on the Hiss case. [...] Lowenthal's critique focused on <b>one</b> <b>message</b> (Venona 1822 KGB Washington-Moscow 30 March 1945), in which the comments identified the covername 'Ales' as [...] "probably Alger Hiss." [...] Lowenthal raised a number of objections to this identification, rejecting it as [...] "a conclusion psychologically motivated and politically correct but factually wrong." [...] Lowenthal's article led to an extended debates on the 'Ales' message, and even prompted the NSA to declassify the original Russian text. Currently Venona 1822 is the only message for which the complete decrypted Russian text has been published.|$|E
