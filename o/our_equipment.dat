500|$|Desert Mounted Corps' 5th Cavalry Division {{which was}} to lead the corps advance, was {{concentrated}} north-west of Sarona, [...] from the front, with the 4th Cavalry Division waiting in orange groves east of Sarona, [...] from the front. The Australian Mounted Division was located near Ramle and Ludd (Lydda) [...] from the front line. These divisions and their horses were camouflaged from aircraft, in olive and orange groves, where the irrigation channels were used to water the horses. James Calderwood Jones with the Lowland Brigade, Royal Field Artillery Ammunition Column, described the scene at 21:00 on 18 September 1918 in his diary: [...] "What a mass of horses & transport. Stand–to all night, lie down with <b>our</b> <b>equipment</b> on ... horses being hooked–up to the wagons." ...|$|E
500|$|The Santa Fe National Forest's rocky {{terrain and}} steep {{inclines}} proved difficult for conventional camera equipment—such as cranes and dollies—which resulted {{in much of}} the film's scenes being shot by the camera operators, who were rigged to aerial ski lifts above the action. [...] "The location we picked was on top of the ski area above 12,000 feet in Santa Fe, and the high altitude made it extremely physically demanding", Schleissler explained. [...] "All <b>our</b> <b>equipment</b> had to be hand-carried into some of our remote locations, which meant we had to limit ourselves to the bare minimum...No one ever hiked to the set empty-handed, including our producers. It was one big team effort that made us a close film family." ...|$|E
500|$|While holidaying in London after Marquee Moons completion, Verlaine {{saw that}} Television {{had been put}} on NMEs front cover and called Elektra's press department, who {{encouraged}} Television to capitalize on their success there with {{a tour of the}} UK. However, the label had already organized for the band to perform on Peter Gabriel's American tour as a supporting act. Television played small theatres and some larger club venues, and received more mainstream exposure, but were not well received by Gabriel's middle-American, progressive rock audiences and found the tour unnerving. In May, the band embarked on a highly successful theatre tour in the UK and were enthusiastically received by audiences. Verlaine said that it was refreshing to perform at large theatres after having played clubs for four years. He nonetheless felt that the tour's supporting act, Blondie, did not suit their show because they were too different artistically, even though both groups had emerged from the music scene at CBGB. Blondie guitarist Chris Stein said Television were [...] "so competitive" [...] and unaccommodating on the tour and that they did not treat it like a joint effort. He recalled one show where [...] "all <b>our</b> <b>equipment</b> was shoved up at the [...] Apollo and we had like three feet of room so that [...] could stand still in this vast space." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{officers}} {{suggested to}} pile up earth to form small hills and replenish their equipment. However, Lü Meng disagreed, [...] "It'll take several days to build the hills and replenish <b>our</b> <b>equipment.</b> By then, the enemy would have reinforced their defences and their relief forces would have arrived, and we can't defeat them. The rainwater has flowed in, and the water level will subside if we linger on for days. By then, it'll {{be very difficult for}} our ships to retreat and we may be in danger. As of now, I observe that the fortress's defences are weak, so we can achieve victory if we attack it from all directions when our army's morale is still high. We can retreat via the water route after that. That's the way to secure total victory." [...] Sun Quan heeded Lü Meng's suggestion.|$|E

Turkish border patrol officers are reported to have deliberately overlooked those entering Syria, upon payment of a small bribe. A report by Sky News exposed documents showing that passports of foreign Islamists wanting to join ISIL by crossing into Syria had been stamped by the Turkish government.

According to Deep Purple's lead vocalist, David Coverdale, [...] "Apparently, a young Aussie band had jumped onstage, plugged into our gear and started playing! Well, all hell broke loose, from what I was told. Our roadies (big buggers to a man) wrestled with the young band {{to get them off}} <b>our</b> <b>equipment</b> and off the stage. Chaos and frolics ensued". Jim Keays performed his solo concept album The Boy from the Stars. Keays and his band were reportedly the only act to have been paid for their appearance, having arranged an outside sponsorship. Later in the year, Deep Purple planned a tour for 1976 and after the Australian Musicians Union [...] "made it clear ... that the proposed tour of Deep Purple could lead to considerable unrest" [...] the UK band placed money into a fund so that artists appearing at Sunbury '75 were paid the full musician's rate.|$|E

2500|$|The band entered Jackson Browne's private {{recording}} studio named Groovemasters in January 2006, after Panunzio had suggested {{it would be}} a suitable recording location. New Found Glory strove to achieve a [...] "clean kind of classic guitar sound" [...] when recording, using a Vox AC30 amp on almost the entire record. The amp, known for its [...] "jangly" [...] high-end sound, was used with several classic guitars in the studio including a Fender Tele, Les Paul, Gibson 335-S and a Rickenbacker. Gilbert enthused that, [...] "It sounds huge. When you put our old records on and our new record, there's actually less guitars on our new album, but it sounds bigger." [...] Jordan Pundik likewise accounted; [...] "he [...] brought this classic vibe to it, especially with the tones he got. We learned we don't have to double-up 15 Mesa cabinets and make it all distorted to make it sound big." [...] Pundik also spoke of the band's desire to challenge themselves musically; [...] "Usually with every record we think, 'We’ve got to put the fast punk song on it or people won't like it', but this wasn't anything like that." [...] He did admit that around thirty songs were written, including some fast-paced songs, but were excluded as, [...] "(they) didn't really fit." [...] Steve Klein, the band's principal lyricist and rhythm guitarist, also praised Panunzio for helping the band bring new elements to their sound. Describing the sessions as [...] "best recording experience ever", he added, [...] "It's this empty mansion where we were able to set up all <b>our</b> <b>equipment,</b> we just woke up and wrote songs. We were really relaxed and able to set our own pace. Everything about the record is way more classic rock sounding because Thom has done a bunch of classic rock records like Tom Petty and Bruce Springsteen and Ozzy, and {{the list goes on and}} on. He kind of brought this different element to our band. This disc is less guitar driven and more melody driven, more than any other of our records." ...|$|E
