50|$|A {{duplexer}} is {{an electronic}} device that allows bi-directional (duplex) communication over a single path. In radar and radio communications systems, it isolates the receiver from the transmitter while permitting {{them to share}} a common antenna. Most radio repeater systems include a duplexer. Duplexers can be based on frequency (often a waveguide filter), polarization (such as an <b>orthomode</b> <b>transducer),</b> or timing (as is typical in radar).|$|E

The antenna feed is usually {{considered}} to be all the components between the beam-shaping part of the antenna and the receiver's first amplifier (called the RF front end, the LNB or LNA). For a transmitting antenna, the feed consists of everything after the last power amplifier, and might include an antenna tuner unit and impedance matching sections at the antenna. In a radar or satellite communications antenna the feed might consist of a feed horn, <b>orthomode</b> <b>transducer,</b> polarizer, frequency diplexer, waveguide, waveguide switches, rotary joint, etc.|$|E
50|$|An <b>orthomode</b> <b>transducer</b> (OMT) is a {{waveguide}} component. It {{is commonly}} referred to as a polarisation duplexer. Orthomode transducers serve either to combine or to separate two orthogonally polarized microwave signal paths. One of the paths forms the uplink, which is transmitted over the same waveguide as the received signal path, or downlink path. Such a device may be part of a VSAT antenna feed or a terrestrial microwave radio feed; for example, OMTs are often used with a feed horn to isolate orthogonal polarizations of a signal and to transfer transmit and receive signals to different ports.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} measurement results of different waveguide hardware designed for an antenna feed system intended for polarimetry applications in the Ka-band (26 – 36 GHz). The proposed structure, based on a square-waveguide polarizer followed by an <b>orthomode</b> <b>transducer,</b> represents {{an alternative to the}} classical setups using septum polarizers, improving their achievements in terms of bandwidth. Due to the low polarization levels and the relatively large polar foregrounds to be detected, the subsystems must exhibit a great performance, minimizing cross-polarization effects and leaks between signal components.

50|$|An ortho-mode {{transducer}} is also {{a component}} commonly found on high capacity terrestrial microwave radio links. In this arrangement, two parabolic reflector dishes operate in a point to point microwave radio path (4 GHz to 85 GHz) with four radios, two mounted on each end. On each dish a T-shaped ortho-mode transducer is mounted {{at the rear of}} the feed, separating the signal from the feed into two separate radios, one operating in the horizontal polarity, and the other in the vertical polarity. This arrangement is used to increase the aggregate data throughput between two dishes on a point to point microwave path, or for fault-tolerance redundancy. Certain types of outdoor microwave radios have integrated <b>orthomode</b> <b>transducers</b> and operate in both polarities from a single radio unit, performing cross-polarization interference cancellation (XPIC) within the radio unit itself.|$|R

The receiver has four pixels arranged in a dual-beam and dual polarized configuration. Orthogonal polarizations are combined in waveguide-based <b>orthomode</b> <b>transducers.</b> Beam-switching at 1 kHz on the sky is achieved using a fast Faraday rotation polarization switch and a wire-grid to interchange the reflected and transmitted beams to each receiver. This ultra-wide-band receiver typically achieves noise temperatures < 50K between 75-110 GHz. The Redshift Search Receiver has exceptional baseline stability {{because it does not}} involve mechanical moving parts, therefore being well-suited to the detection of redshifted transitions of the CO ladder from star-forming galaxies at cosmological distances. An innovative wide-band analog autocorrelator system which covers the full 38 GHz with 31 MHz (100 km/s at 90 GHz) resolution serves as the backed spectrometer.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} a cross-polarized {{multi-channel}} W-band radar for contactless velocity measurement of turbulent flows (pneumatically conveyed dust or gas) in industrial pipes is presented. The system {{is based on}} three linear modulated FMCW radar channels with separate RX/TX, which are fed into wideband <b>orthomode</b> <b>transducers.</b> For maximum SNR each channel has two focused dielectric lens antennas resulting in a narrow beam through the fluid at three different locations with known spacing. The reflectors are implemented by means of wideband trans-polarizing reflectors. This allows high precision cross-polarization (HV,VH) time-of-flight measurements through the pipe to the fixed position targets with reduced influence of the not trans-polarized pipe's window reflections. The flow velocity is extracted by correlating the time-delay between the flowing vortexes as they travel past the three radar beams, by use of an FPGA with real-time processing capabilities.

40|$|The Atacama Cosmology Telescope Polarimeter (ACTPol) is a {{polarization}} sensitive {{upgrade to}} the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, located at {{an elevation of}} 5190 m on Cerro Toco in Chile. ACTPol uses transition edge sensor bolometers coupled to <b>orthomode</b> <b>transducers</b> to measure both the temperature and polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Calibration of the detector angles is a critical step in producing polarization maps of the CMB. Polarization angle offsets in the detector calibration can cause leakage in polarization from E to B modes and induce a spurious signal in the EB and TB cross correlations, which eliminates our ability to measure potential cosmological sources of EB and TB signals, such as cosmic birefringence. We calibrate the ACTPol detector angles by ray tracing the designed detector angle through the entire optical chain to determine the projection of each detector angle on the sky. The distribution of calibrated detector polarization angles are consistent with a global offset angle from zero {{when compared to the}} EB-nulling offset angle, the angle required to null the EB cross-correlation power spectrum. We present the optical modeling process. The detector angles can be cross checked through observations of known polarized sources, whether this be a galactic source or a laboratory reference standard. To cross check the ACTPol detector angles, we use a thin film polarization grid placed in front of the receiver of the telescope, between the receiver and the secondary reflector. Making use of a rapidly rotating half-wave plate (HWP) mount we spin the polarizing grid at a constant speed, polarizing and rotating the incoming atmospheric signal. The resulting sinusoidal signal is used to determine the detector angles. The optical modeling calibration was shown to be consistent with a global offset angle of zero when compared to EB nulling in the first ACTPol results {{and will continue to be}} a part of our calibration implementation. The first array of detectors for Advanced ACTPol, the next generation upgrade to ACTPol, will be deployed in 2016. We plan to continue using both techniques and compare them to astrophysical source measurements for the Advanced ACTPol polarization calibration...|$|R
