5|$|After adolescence, most {{physical}} training for males {{was of a}} military nature. The Campus Martius originally was an exercise field where young men developed the skills of horsemanship and warfare. Hunting was also considered an appropriate pastime. According to Plutarch, conservative Romans disapproved of Greek-style athletics that promoted a fine body for its <b>own</b> <b>sake,</b> and condemned Nero's efforts to encourage gymnastic games in the Greek manner.|$|E
5|$|In conclusion, {{the insistence}} of ahimsa {{is not so much}} about non-injury to others as it is about non-injury and spiritual welfare of the self. The {{ultimate}} rationale of ahimsa is fundamentally about karmic results of the hiṃsā on self rather than the concern about the well being of other beings for its <b>own</b> <b>sake.</b>|$|E
40|$|Roy W. Perrett {{argues that}} the Hindu sage, like the western moral saint, seems precluded from {{pursuing}} non-moral ends for their <b>own</b> <b>sakes.</b> If he is precluded from pursuing non-moral ends for their <b>own</b> <b>sakes,</b> then he is precluded from pursuing non-moral virtues, interests, activities, relationships, and so on for their <b>own</b> <b>sakes.</b> A life devoid of every such pursuit seems deficient. Hence, the Hindu sage seems to forsake the good life. In response, I adapt a reply that Vanessa Carbonell offers {{in the context of}} the moral saint. The Hindu sage might pursue non-moral virtues, interests, activities, relationships, and so on for their <b>own</b> <b>sakes,</b> so long as his motivation to pursue moksa is read de re rather than de dicto. Indeed, this reply is more convincing in the case of the Hindu sage than it is in the case of the moral saint...|$|R

5|$|Sculptural {{fragments}} to Rodin were autonomous works, and {{he considered}} them {{the essence of}} his artistic statement. His fragments– perhaps lacking arms, legs, or a head– took sculpture further from its traditional role of portraying likenesses, and into a realm where forms existed for their <b>own</b> <b>sake.</b> Notable examples are The Walking Man, Meditation without Arms, and Iris, Messenger of the Gods.|$|E
5|$|This {{dedication}} to reading and study might, in another boy, have been {{nothing more than}} a reaction to the impending examinations — but not in Jan's case. What made this particular episode revealing was that the books found under his bedclothes were largely unconnected with his studies. In Riebeek West he developed a lifelong habit, that of reading avidly outside the prescribed curriculum, seeking knowledge for its <b>own</b> <b>sake.</b>|$|E
5|$|After the {{completion}} of the rough draft, he wrote a volume of four chapters, Qur'an al-Majid, which served as an introduction for the tafsir. Darwaza stresses a close connection between the Quran and the biography of the Muhammad (sira) and states that the Quran fully reflects various stages between the Quran and the career of Muhammad. He also emphasizes that both the angels and the jinn are spoken in the Quran not for their <b>own</b> <b>sake,</b> but to reinforce Muhammad's missions and goals.|$|E

5|$|Sri Lankan Tamil society values {{education}} highly, for its <b>own</b> <b>sake</b> {{as well as}} for {{the opportunities}} it provides. The kings of the Aryacakravarti dynasty were historically patrons of literature and education. Temple schools and traditional gurukulam classes on verandahs (known as Thinnai Pallikoodam in Tamil) spread basic education in religion and in languages such as Tamil and Sanskrit to the upper classes. The Portuguese introduced western-style education after their conquest of the Jaffna kingdom in 1619. The Jesuits opened churches and seminaries, but the Dutch destroyed them and opened their own schools attached to Dutch Reformed churches when they took over Tamil-speaking regions of Sri Lanka.|$|E
5|$|Tara {{finds her}} {{strength}} in Shiv, a wiser and more experienced counterpart. The two start {{spending most of}} their spare time together coping with their grief, despite being completely opposite in nature. Shiv takes Tara to the temple, and she takes him shopping. Rajat's doctor, Nirupam Malhotra (Rajat Kapoor), tells Tara that Rajat has a hematoma in his brain and an operation might help him recover, but it carries the risk of partial paralysis. Tara is torn, as she believes Rajat {{would not want to}} take the risk, and seeks advice from Shiv. He is already at loggerheads with Dr. Malhotra, dismissing him as a pawn of the hospital board and the insurance companies who only care about making money and not the patients. Tara and Shiv get into a heated argument. Shiv lashes out angrily at Tara for not giving Rajat a chance at life. Tara retorts that she is a realist, and dismisses Shiv for being selfish and making his wife go through pain for his <b>own</b> <b>sake.</b>|$|E
5|$|The nomenklatura {{political}} elite developed. It comprised leaders, administrators and managers within {{the ruling party}} structure, in all branches of central and local government and in institutions of all kinds. The nomenklatura members were appointed by the party and exercised political control in all spheres of public life, for example economic development, industry management or education. For the party, the privileged nomenklatura layer was maintained to assure the proper placement {{of people who were}} ideologically reliable and otherwise qualified, but the revisionist dissidents Jacek Kuroń and Karol Modzelewski later described this system as a class dictatorship of central political bureaucracy for its <b>own</b> <b>sake.</b> The Polish public widely approved the many social undertakings of the communist government, including family apartment construction, child care, worker vacation and resorts, health care and full employment policies, but the special privileges granted nomenklatura and the security services were resented.|$|E

25|$|At {{the other}} end of the Orthodox continuum, some Modern Orthodox Jews {{understand}} Hirsch in the sense of Torah Umadda, meaning a synthesis of Torah knowledge and secular knowledge - each for its <b>own</b> <b>sake</b> (this view is propagated in several articles in Tradition: A Journal of Orthodox Thought, published by the Rabbinical Council of America). In this view, Hirsch thought that it was permissible, and even productive, for Jews to learn Gentile philosophy, music, art, literature, and ethics for their <b>own</b> <b>sake.</b>|$|E
