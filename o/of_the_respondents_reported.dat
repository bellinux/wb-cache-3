For example, {{in a survey of}} 148 high school graduates in North Carolina in 1989 the graduates were given a definition of sexual harassment and asked if they had experienced sexual harassment during their high school years. 43% reported inappropriate comments, looks, or gestures by a teacher, 17.5% reported sexual touching, and 13.5% indicated that they have had sexual intercourse with a teacher. In another study college students were asked to recall if they or other students had experienced sexual harassment by high school teachers. 6.5% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>respondents</b> <b>reported</b> having personally experienced sexually inappropriate attention from high school teachers. Furthermore, more than 33% said that they knew of a sexual relationship between a high school student and a teacher.|$|E
2500|$|When {{compared}} with the general population, homosexuality and bisexuality are over-represented in the furry fandom by about a factor of 10. Of the US population, about 1.8% of persons self-identify as bisexual and 1.7% as homosexual according to a 2011 study from scholars at UCLA. In contrast, according to four different surveys 14–25% of the fandom members report homosexuality, 37–52% bisexuality, 28–51% heterosexuality, and 3–8% other forms of alternative sexual relationships. Approximately half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>respondents</b> <b>reported</b> being in a relationship, of which 76% were {{in a relationship with}} another member of furry fandom. Examples of sexual aspects within furry fandom include erotic art and furry-themed cybersex.

40|$|Objective: To assess <b>the</b> {{prevalence}} <b>of</b> {{child abuse}} among {{high school students}} in Curacao. Methods: A questionnaire survey among high school students up to 17 years of age was conducted. The questionnaire was based on existing literature and validated questionnaires. The questionnaire used was analysed and adapted to the situation in Curacao by a panel of experts on child abuse. The primary objective was to gain insight into the incidence, prevalence and various forms of child abuse among students in Curacao. Five forms of child abuse are distinguished in the literature: physical abuse, emotional abuse, sexual abuse, neglect and exploitation. Furthermore, <b>the</b> degree <b>of</b> confidence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> students in general practitioners (GPs) as care providers in <b>the</b> field <b>of</b> child abuse was explored. Results: Questionnaires from 545 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 628 <b>respondents</b> were included. In total, 43 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>respondents</b> had ever-experienced an event which could be defined as (a form of) child abuse. More than one-third <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>respondents</b> <b>reporting</b> child abuse ever had an experience that could be interpreted as physical abuse. More than 15 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>respondents</b> <b>reporting</b> child abuse had experienced sexual abuse. Girls experienced significantly more sexual abuse than boys. Emotional abuse in the last year was experienced by 3 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>respondents.</b> One per cent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>respondents</b> ever-experienced neglect. According to most respondents, GPs were not seen as care providers in cases of child abuse; they believed that GPs were mainly to be consulted for illnesses or physical symptoms and not for forms of child abuse. Conclusion: <b>The</b> prevalence <b>of</b> ever-having-experienced a form of child abuse is estimated at 431 per 1000 students. Child abuse, particularly physical abuse, is common in Curacao, and is probably comparable to other surrounding countries. General practitioners were not seen as care providers in identifying and reporting cases of child abuse according to most respondents...|$|R

The strongest predictor to emerge in <b>the</b> multivariate analyses <b>of</b> resistance was timing of assault: respondents assaulted only in childhood were less likely to resist than either respondents assaulted only in adulthood, or respondents assaulted in both phases.

Treatment for an acoustic neuroma may damage the facial nerve - either with surgery or radiation. It is usually possible, however, to preserve some degree of facial function even in cases where the nerve is extensively involved. For those with partial nerve regeneration, in whom some facial weakness remains, non-surgical facial rehabilitation therapies also may be beneficial.|$|E
