5|$|Patients <b>often</b> <b>ask</b> if {{they need}} to have special safety {{precautions}} around family and friends after receiving brachytherapy. If temporary brachytherapy is used, no radioactive sources remain in the body after treatment. Therefore, there is no radiation risk to friends or family from being in close proximity with them.|$|E
5|$|The inaugural {{season of}} Homicide {{established}} a realistic visual style that would remain largely intact throughout {{the duration of}} the series. Among the stylistic elements were the near-constant movement with hand-held Super 16 cameras to give the show a naturalistic documentary look and an editing style involving jump cuts that was unusual for television at the time. Wayne Ewing had used Super 16 cameras while filming promotional material for Toys, and that format allowed Homicide producers to film cheaply and with a smaller crew, giving them more time to focus on the actor's performances. While filming, Levinson said he would simply allow the actors to perform while he switched back and forth between them with the hand-held camera instead of filming carefully planned shots and individual scenes from multiple angles. Levinson said the camera and editing style was partially inspired by the Jean-Luc Godard film Breathless (1960), which he would <b>often</b> <b>ask</b> his directors to watch before filming Homicide episodes.|$|E

5|$|In 1989, {{at the age}} of 18, Chen began {{attending}} school as a grade one student at the Elementary School for the Blind in Linyi city. In 1994, he enrolled at the Qingdao High School for the Blind, where he studied until 1998. He had already begun developing an interest in law, and would <b>often</b> <b>ask</b> his brothers to read legal texts to him. He earned a position at the Nanjing University of Traditional Chinese Medicine in 1998 but because his family was poor, they had to borrow $340 to cover tuition costs. They still fell short of the required $400 and university authorities reportedly had to be pleaded with before allowing Chen to enroll. He studied in Nanjing from 1998 to 2001, specializing in acupuncture and massage—the only programs available to the blind. Chen also audited legal courses, gaining a sufficient understanding of the law to allow him to aid his fellow villagers when they sought his assistance. After graduation he returned to his home region and found a job as a masseur in the hospital of Yinan County.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} known texts <b>often</b> <b>ask</b> for ascetics to be {{in complete}} solitude, identifying the isolation of soul and non-soul.

25|$|The show's {{unprecedented}} {{access to}} police departments has generated some controversy because such access is not typically given to traditional local news media. Moreover, {{the show has}} been criticized for putting witnesses in danger by revealing their faces and their voices on a nationally televised program and for not being sensitive to what might happen to them in the form of retaliation. In response to such criticism, witnesses <b>often</b> <b>ask</b> producers to have their faces blurred out and voices changed or to speak off camera.|$|E
25|$|The {{object of}} The Guide to Science was to present answers to over 2000 {{questions}} about common phenomena.

Brewer intended that his book should be intelligible to a child, since children might <b>often</b> <b>ask</b> the questions he was seeking to answer, but without being so foolish as to offend the scientific.|$|E

25|$|After {{creating}} Yūko, Clamp {{believed her}} character was so interesting {{she could be}} the only main character in the series. However, they then wondered it would more interesting if they created another character who, like Yūko, would also be connected with the spirits and across the story would see Yūko's life and <b>often</b> <b>ask</b> her about the supernatural events. They compared Yūko and Watanuki with Doraemon and Nobita Nobi, respectively, from the manga series Doraemon. Unlike Yūko, Watanuki's personality and design were not difficult to write and illustrate. He {{was based on a}} real beautician who has not been identified by the authors.|$|E
25|$|These exorcists, or ahletan hsaya, {{are said}} to possess powers that can fend away or {{challenge}} these evil demons. These exorcists were often seen as very holy, {{because they had to}} be to combat troublesome spirits. They attempt exorcisms by giving the nat offerings. As an interesting overlap with Buddhism, exorcisms can be performed by holding the Buddha up to the possessed person, in an effort to have the Nat flee. If the exorcist cannot banish this spirit alone, they <b>often</b> <b>ask</b> for the assistance of the nat-kadaw. Sorcerers, or weikzas also harnessed the power of these nats through many complex rituals, to gain their own supernatural powers.|$|E
25|$|Keane {{initially}} found life in Nottingham difficult due to {{the long}} periods away from his family, and he would <b>often</b> <b>ask</b> the club for a few days' home leave in order to return to Cork. Keane expressed his gratitude at Clough's generosity when considering his requests, as it helped him get through his early days at the club. Keane's first games at Forest came in the Under-21s team during a pre-season tournament in the Netherlands. In the final against Haarlem, he scored the winning penalty in a shootout to decide the competition, and he was soon playing regularly for the reserve team. His professional league debut came against Liverpool {{at the start of}} the 1990–91 season, and the resulting performance encouraged Clough to use him more and more as the season progressed.|$|E

25|$|A {{major element}} of {{strategy}} in these sports is {{the condition of}} the ball. Since bowling in cricket has more variations (such as bounce, swing, seam movement, off-spin, leg-spin and so on), {{the condition of the}} ball also affects play to a great degree. In Test cricket, the same ball must be used for at least 80 overs unless it is lost, damaged or illegally modified at which point it must be replaced with a used ball in a similar condition. After the 80 overs, obtaining a new ball is at the discretion of the fielding captain – who will <b>often</b> <b>ask</b> for a new ball immediately, since a new ball is harder, smoother, bounces higher and has an intact seam, which produces greater conventional swing. But when a captain feels that a spin bowling attack {{is more likely to be}} successful, he will persist with the old ball, which is rougher and better grips the surface as well the bowler's fingers. In baseball the ball is replaced numerous times during a game to ensure it is in optimum condition.|$|E

500|$|Larry Carbone, a {{laboratory}} animal veterinarian, writes that, in his experience, IACUCs take their work very seriously {{regardless of the}} species involved, though the use of non-human primates always raises {{what he calls a}} [...] "red flag of special concern". A study published in Science magazine in July 2001 confirmed the low reliability of IACUC reviews of animal experiments. Funded by the National Science Foundation, the three-year study found that animal-use committees that do not know the specifics of the university and personnel do not make the same approval decisions as those made by animal-use committees that do know the university and personnel. Specifically, blinded committees more <b>often</b> <b>ask</b> for more information rather than approving studies.|$|E

Most of the current performers work part-time while attending college, and all are certified Scuba divers. [...] They wear fabric tails and perform aquatic ballet (while holding their breath) for an audience in an underwater stage with glass walls.

500|$|The {{memory of}} her father {{apparently}} motivated Maria Amélia's dedication to her education.

[...] She was never quite {{able to cope with}} her father's death and it deeply touched her. Maria Amélia remarked after she saw a garden where Pedro planted a sycamore: [...] "A profound sadness invaded me when contemplating these trees, which had survived my father and probably shall survive all of us. It is an image of human fragility. Man is the most frail of all beings; he dies, while the objects which were seemingly created for his use, endure the centuries!...
