6000|$|MR CHAIRMAN:--Some {{if not all}} {{the gentlemen}} {{on the other side}} of the House who have {{addressed}} the committee within the last two days have spoken rather complainingly, if I have rightly understood them, of the vote given a week or ten days ago declaring that the war with Mexico was unnecessarily and unconstitutionally commenced by the President. I admit that such a vote should not be given in mere party wantonness, and that the one given is justly censurable if it have no other or better foundation. I am one of those who joined in that vote; and I did so under my best impression of the truth of the case. How I got this impression, and how it may possibly be remedied, I will now try to show. When the war began, it was my opinion that all those who because of knowing too little, or because of knowing too much, could not conscientiously approve the conduct of the President in the beginning of it should nevertheless, as good citizens and patriots, remain silent on that point, at least till the war should be ended. Some leading Democrats, including ex-President Van Buren, have taken this same view, as I understand them; and I adhered to it and acted upon it, until since I took my seat here; and I think I should still adhere to it were it not that the President and his friends will not allow it to be so. Besides the continual effort of the President to argue every silent vote given for supplies into an indorsement of the justice and wisdom of his conduct; besides that singularly candid paragraph in his late message in which he tells us that Congress with great unanimity had declared that [...] "by the act of the Republic of Mexico, a state of war exists between that government and the United States," [...] when the same journals that informed him of this also informed him that when that declaration stood disconnected from the question of supplies sixty-seven in the House, and not fourteen merely, voted against it; besides this open attempt to prove by telling the truth what he could not prove by telling the whole truth-demanding of all who will not submit to be misrepresented, in justice to themselves, to speak out, besides all this, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>colleagues</b> [Mr. Richardson] at a very early day in the session brought in a set of resolutions expressly indorsing the original justice of the war on the part of the President. Upon these resolutions when they shall be put on their passage I shall be compelled to vote; so that I cannot be silent if I would. Seeing this, I went about preparing myself to give the vote understandingly when it should come. I carefully examined the President's message, to ascertain what he himself had said and proved upon the point. The result of this examination was to make the impression that, taking for true all the President states as facts, he falls far short of proving his justification; and that the President would have gone further with his proof if it had not been for the small matter that the truth would not permit him. Under the impression thus made I gave the vote before mentioned. I propose now to give concisely the process of the examination I made, and how I reached the conclusion I did. The President, in his first war message of May, 1846, declares that the soil was ours on which hostilities were commenced by Mexico, and he repeats that declaration almost in the same language in each successive annual message, thus showing that he deems that point a highly essential one. In the importance of that point I entirely agree with the President. To my judgment it is the very point upon which he should be justified, or condemned. In his message of December, 1846, it seems to have occurred to him, as is certainly true, that title-ownership-to soil or anything else is not a simple fact, but is a conclusion following on one or more simple facts; and that it was incumbent upon him to present the facts from which he concluded the soil was ours on which the first blood of the war was shed.|$|E

At the time, it reminded me a little of naughty schoolboys, playing a nasty game on their stern headmaster.

After being teased with this over many years, I offer the following response: we measure parameters in an attempt to explain natural phenomena. What tools do we require to do this? Leaving aside desirable personality characteristics such as enthusiasm, curiosity, insight and open-mindedness, which are all essential for good science, the greatest ‘gift’ I received was to be instructed during my university days and in my early career in software programming. I truly believe that the ability to write software code frees us to translate thoughts into practice, or, in silico experimentation. Hardware developments, at least in this field, tend to be expensive and on a much grander scale than can often be undertaken in the university physics laboratory or hospital department. But software development, as a form of experimentation, knows no such bounds. My own software skills could never be classified as ‘professional’; however, a large number of patient scans have been processed or analysed with novel software that I have written, and many <b>of</b> <b>my</b> publications are based on exploring software solutions to medical problems.

I have never read his history, and I speak of it only at second hand; but I had read, before I met him, his novel of 'Archy Moore, or The White Slave', which left an indelible impression of his imaginative verity upon me. The impression is still so deep that after the lapse of nearly forty years since I saw the book, I have no misgiving in speaking {{of it as a}} powerful piece of realism.

I fancy it did not lack recognition in its time, altogether, for I used to see it in Italian and French translations on the bookstalls. I believe neither his history nor his novel brought the author more gain than fame. He had worn himself out on a newspaper when he got his appointment at Trieste, and I saw him {{in the shadow of the}} cloud that was wholly to darken him before he died.

I would suggest the same approach be used to address the illegal manufac-ture of crystal meth. It is clear that the manufacturing process is widely known. Is there any chemical used in the production of crystal meth that could be made subject to licensing if it were purchased in large quantities...|$|R
40|$|My {{work on the}} Conflict Tactics Scales (CTS) {{grew out}} of a mix of motivations that has been with me for a lifetime. First was a {{humanitarian}} concern, and in this case, a desire to contribute to reducing violence. The earliest manifestation was a 1953 article on suicide and homicide (Straus & Straus, 1953). The concern with reducing violence lay dormant until revulsion with the Vietnam war, the rising violent crime rates, and the feminist campaign against rape and wife-beating led me to study corporal punishment by parents (Straus, 1971), family violence in general (Straus, 1973), and violence against women (Straus, 1976). The second influence was a predilection for research others regard as impractical or sometimes as “crazy. ” Before the publication of the CTS, few believed {{it would be possible to}} knock on the door of a random sample of households and be able to obtain data on violent acts between members <b>of</b> the household. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> most respected <b>colleagues</b> explicitly cautioned me that the national survey on family violence I was planning would not work because “you can’t get this kind of information in a survey. ” The third influence was a commitment to the scientific method, including the belie...|$|R
40|$|The 17 th International Congress of Arachnology {{was held}} in São Pedro Brazil between 5 and 10 August. It was the largest {{gathering}} of arachnologists ever held. The congress attracted about 320 persons from 34 countries. There were 5 plenary talks, 7 symposia (each with up to a half-dozen talks), 115 short oral presentations and 259 posters. Because of {{the large number of}} talks, there were usually 2, sometimes 3, concurrent sessions. As usual, spider topics dominated the sessions. However, rather than the usual half-dozen or fewer harvestmen-workers, there were close to 40. The vast majority of these came from Brazilian universities and research institutions. More than half were students. The number of female arachnologists is increasing. About half of the new students were female. Three Canadians attended the congress; Wayne Maddison of the University of British Columbia, Maxim Larrivée of McGill University, and myself. About 50 people attended my presentation on the harvestmen of Canada. It was well received. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> Brazilian <b>colleagues</b> lamented how unfortunate we were in having less than 50 species in Canada compared with the more than 600 from Brazil! As usual I was able to renew acquaintances with old colleagues and meet new ones. A Mexican colleague is looking at reanalyzing some <b>of</b> <b>my</b> data on Togwoteeus biceps for a possible new publication on sexual differences. An American colleague will be sending me some specimens from Eastern North America to help me identify species with which I am not that familiar. I solicited help from two American colleagues to get behavioural data on an eastern species that overwinters in mines and caves, similar to the one I studied in western North America. In general the conference increased <b>my</b> knowledge <b>of</b> arachnids and renewed my enthusiasm for finishing my various incomplete projects on arachnids. I thank the committee for helping me attend this conference. Attached is my PowerPoint presentation. Harvestmen are the third largest Order of Arachnida. Biological information, other than morphology used for taxonomy, is very limited. Canada has at least 43 species, mostly Euponi (Caddidae 3, Phalangiidae 12, Sclerosomatidae 17). Nine species are Dyspnoi (Ceratolasmatidae 1, Ischyropsalidae 2, Nemastomatidae 3, Sabaconidae 3). Only two are Laniatores (Triaenonychidae). Six species (mostly Phalangiidae) are probably introduced from Europe. Distributions and life history information will be given for selected species.
