5|$|In 2010, Zakuani {{accepted}} a call up from Congo for a friendly match against Mali. In a press release, Zakuani {{called it the}} highest honor <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>young</b> career. It was a challenging decision for him but the wait to become eligible {{to play for the}} United States was too long. The game was played in Dieppe, France, in November 2010. Zakuani started the match and came off at half-time with Congo in the lead. Mali rallied in the second half, beating Congo in a 3–1 loss.|$|E
5|$|Bundy was {{regarded}} by many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>young</b> female victims as handsome and charismatic, traits that he exploited {{to win their}} trust. He typically approached them in public places, feigning injury or disability, or impersonating an authority figure, before overpowering and assaulting them at more secluded locations. He sometimes revisited his secondary crime scenes {{for hours at a}} time, grooming and performing sexual acts with the decomposing corpses until putrefaction and destruction by wild animals made further interaction impossible. He decapitated at least 12 of his victims, and kept some of the severed heads in his apartment {{for a period of time}} as mementos. On a few occasions, he simply broke into dwellings at night and bludgeoned his victims as they slept.|$|E
5|$|Kochanowski {{was born}} in 1530 into a prosperous noble family. In his youth he studied at the {{universities}} of Kraków, Königsberg and Padua and traveled extensively in Europe. He worked for a time as a royal secretary, and then settled {{in the village of}} Czarnolas, a part of his family inheritance. Kochanowski's multifaceted creative output is remarkable for both the depth of thoughts and feelings that he shares with the reader, and for its beauty and classic perfection of form. Among Kochanowski's best known works are bucolic Frascas (trifles), epic poetry, religious lyrics, drama-tragedy The Dismissal of the Greek Envoys, and the most highly regarded Threnodies or laments, written after the death <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>young</b> daughter.|$|E

5|$|Morton was an Indiana native born in Wayne County {{near the}} small {{settlement}} of Salisbury on August 4, 1823, to James Throck and Sarah Miller Morton. His grandfather had shortened the family's surname, Throckmorton, to Morton, but the {{males in the}} family carried Throck as a middle name. He was named for Oliver Hazard Perry, the victorious Commodore in the Battle of Lake Erie. Morton disliked his name from an early age, and before beginning his political career he shortened it to Oliver Perry Morton, dropping the middle names of Hazard and Throck. His mother {{died when he was}} three, and he was raised by his maternal grandparents. He spent most <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>young</b> life living with them in Ohio.|$|E
5|$|Richard {{fulfilled}} {{his promise}} to Canadiens' fans as he led Montreal to a Stanley Cup championship in 1955–56. The season began with the arrival <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>young</b> brother Henri to the Canadiens roster. It also marked the return of his former Punch line teammate, Toe Blake, as head coach. Along with general manager Frank Selke, Blake worked with Richard on moderating his temper and responding to the provocation of his opponents by scoring goals rather than engaging in fisticuffs. Richard finished the season with 38 goals and 71 points, second on the team in both respects to Jean Béliveau's 47 goals and 88 points. Richard added 14 points in 10 playoff games as Montreal defeated Detroit to claim the Stanley Cup. He scored the second and ultimately Cup-clinching goal in the fifth and final game, a 3–1 victory.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the death}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>young</b> {{daughter}} from leukaemia in 1992, Gunn {{has been extensively}} involved in fundraising to combat the disease and its effects. As of 2011 he {{has raised more than}} £1 million for research into childhood leukaemia. The money has been used to fund projects {{to improve the lives of}} children with leukaemia and their families, notably a national telephone support line. The city of Norwich recognised Gunn's charity work and his long association with the city's football club by naming him Sheriff for 2002. Published in 2006, his autobiography, In Where it Hurts: My Autobiography, includes a foreword by his former manager Alex Ferguson.|$|E

25|$|Some Xavier’s {{siblings}} {{have married}} into the ruling European houses and few have actually ruled: {{these were the}} cases <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>younger</b> sister Zita, who in 1911 married into the imperial Habsburg family to become the empress of Austria and the queen of Hungary in 1916-1918, and this <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>younger</b> brother Felix, who in 1919 married into the ducal Nassau family and was the duke-consort of Luxembourg in 1919-1970. Some Xavier’s siblings were closely related to actual rulers: these were the cases <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>younger</b> brother René, who in 1921 married into the royal Danish family, this <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>younger</b> brother , who in 1939 married into the royal Italian family, and this <b>of</b> <b>his</b> older half-sister Maria Luisa, who in 1893 married into the royal Bulgarian family. Some Xavier’s siblings married into ducal or otherwise distinguished highly aristocratic houses. Six mentally handicapped older half-siblings have never married and three of Xavier’s sisters became Benedictine nuns.|$|R
5|$|Usher {{was born}} in Dallas, Texas, the son of Jonetta Patton (née O'Neal), from Tennessee, and Usher Raymond III. Usher spent the {{majority}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>young</b> life in Chattanooga: his father left the family when Usher was a year old. Usher grew up with his mother, then-stepfather, and half-brother, James Lackey (born 1984). Directed by his mother, Usher joined the local church youth choir in Chattanooga, when he was nine years old. There, his grandmother discovered his ability to sing, {{although it was not}} until Usher joined a singing group that she considered he could sing professionally. In the belief that a bigger city would provide greater opportunities for showcasing his talent, Usher's family moved to Atlanta, Georgia, where there was a more conducive environment for beginning singers. While in Atlanta, Usher attended North Springs High School.|$|E
5|$|In January 1776, Allen and his {{men were}} put on board HMS Soledad, which sailed for Cork, Ireland. The people of Cork, when they learned that the famous Ethan Allen was in port, took up a {{collection}} to provide him {{and his men}} with clothing and other supplies. Much of the following year was spent on prison ships off the American coast. At one point, while aboard HMS Mercury, she anchored off New York, where, among other visitors, the captain entertained William Tryon; Allen reports that Tryon glanced at him without any sign of recognition, although it is likely the New York governor knew who he was. In August 1776, Allen and other prisoners were temporarily put ashore in Halifax, owing to extremely poor conditions aboard ship; due to food scarcity, both crew and prisoners were on short rations, and scurvy was rampant. By the end of October, Allen was again off New York, where the British, having secured the city, moved the prisoners on-shore, and, as he was considered an officer, gave Allen limited parole. With the financial assistance of his brother Ira, he lived comfortably, if out of action, until August 1777. He then learned of the death <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>young</b> son Joseph due to smallpox.|$|E
5|$|The {{use of the}} Book of Common Prayer {{became law}} in 1549. King Edward's half-sister, Mary Tudor, de facto had licence to {{continue}} hearing mass in private. So {{soon as he was}} in power, Dudley put pressure on her to stop her from allowing her entire household and flocks of visitors to attend. Mary, who in her turn did not tolerate the Book of Common Prayer in any of her residences, was not prepared to make any concessions. She planned to flee the country but then could not make up her mind in the last minute. Mary denied Edward's personal interest in the issue and entirely blamed John Dudley for her troubles. After a meeting with King and Council, in which she was told that what mattered was not her faith but her disobedience to the law, she sent the Imperial ambassador de Scheyfye to threaten war on England. The English government could not swallow a war threat from an ambassador who had stepped out of his commission, {{but at the same time}} would not risk all-important commercial ties with the Habsburg Netherlands, so an embassy was sent to Brussels and some of Mary's household officers were arrested. On his next visit to the Council, de Scheyfye was informed by the Earl of Warwick that the King of England had as much authority at 14 as he had at 40—Dudley was alluding to Mary's refusal to accept Edward's demands on grounds <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>young</b> age. In the end a silent compromise came into effect: Mary continued to hear mass in a more private manner, while augmenting her landed property by exchanges with the Crown.|$|E
