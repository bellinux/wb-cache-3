5|$|Other sensory {{abnormalities}} {{include a}} {{distortion of the}} patient's sense of time, for example déjà vu, or a distortion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> of self (depersonalization) or sense of reality (derealization).|$|E

5|$|Zinc {{lozenges}} {{have been}} used to treat symptoms, with some studies suggesting that they may reduce the duration of the common cold. Due to wide differences between the studies, further research may be needed to determine how and when zinc may be effective. Zinc lozenges may produce side effects, and there is only a weak rationale for physicians to recommend them as a treatment of the common cold. Some zinc remedies directly applied {{to the inside of the}} nose have led to the loss <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> of smell.|$|E

60|$|This {{has been}} the Italian {{position}} ever since. The mind, that is <b>the</b> Light; <b>the</b> <b>senses,</b> they are <b>the</b> Darkness.

5|$|Perhaps no American neo-noirs better {{reflect the}} classic noir A-movie-with-a-B-movie-soul {{than those of}} director-writer Quentin Tarantino; neo-noirs of his such as Reservoir Dogs (1992) and Pulp Fiction (1994) display a relentlessly self-reflexive, {{sometimes}} tongue-in-cheek sensibility, similar {{to the work of}} the New Wave directors and the Coens. Other films from the era readily identifiable as neo-noir (some retro, some more au courant) include director John Dahl's Kill Me Again (1989), Red Rock West (1992), The Last Seduction (1993), as well as Gus van Sant's To Die For (1995), and Andrew Davis's A Perfect Murder (1998); four adaptations of novels by Jim Thompson—The Kill-Off (1989), After Dark, My Sweet (1990), The Grifters (1990), and the remake of The Getaway (1994); and many more, including adaptations of the work of other major noir fiction writers: The Hot Spot (1990), from Hell Hath No Fury, by Charles Williams; Miami Blues (1990), from the novel by Charles Willeford; and Out of Sight (1998), from the novel by Elmore Leonard. Several films by director-writer David Mamet involve noir elements: House of Games (1987), Homicide (1991), The Spanish Prisoner (1997), and Heist (2001). On television, Remington Steele (1982–87) and Moonlighting (1985–89) paid homage to classic noir while demonstrating an unusual appreciation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> of humor often found in the original cycle. Between 1983 and 1989, Mickey Spillane's hardboiled private eye Mike Hammer was played with wry gusto by Stacy Keach in a series and several stand-alone television films (an unsuccessful revival followed in 1997–98). The British miniseries The Singing Detective (1986), written by Dennis Potter, {{tells the story of a}} mystery writer named Philip Marlow; widely considered one of the finest neo-noirs in any medium, some critics rank it among the greatest television productions of all time.|$|E

25|$|Study {{of topics}} {{including}} vibration, consonance, the harmonic series, and resonance were furthered through the scientific revolution, including work by Galileo, Kepler, Mersenne, and Descartes. This included further speculation concerning the nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> organs and higher-order processes, particularly by Savart, Helmholtz, and Koenig.|$|E
50|$|Mystery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senses</b> is a five-part Nova miniseries, {{based on}} the book A Natural History <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senses</b> by Diane Ackerman, who also {{presents}} the documentary. Each episode covers one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> traditional five senses: hearing, sight, smell, taste, and touch. The series premiered on PBS on February 19, 1995.|$|R

25|$|The {{activity}} of siRNAs in RNAi is largely dependent on its binding ability to the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). Binding of the duplex siRNA to RISC {{is followed by}} unwinding and cleavage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> strand with endonucleases. The remaining anti-sense strand-RISC complex can then bind to target mRNAs for initiating transcriptional silencing.|$|E
25|$|The {{investigation}} of the neural correlates of reciprocal imitation is extremely important because it provides an ecological paradigm (a situation close to everyday life) {{to address the issue}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> of agency. There is evidence that reciprocal imitation plays a constitutive role in the early development of an implicit sense of self as a social agent.|$|E
25|$|The {{principal}} {{themes of}} sex and death were considered scandalous. He also touched on lesbianism, sacred and profane love, metamorphosis, melancholy, {{the corruption of the}} city, lost innocence, the oppressiveness of living, and wine. Notable in some poems is Baudelaire's use of imagery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> of smell and of fragrances, which is used to evoke feelings of nostalgia and past intimacy.|$|E

25|$|Another {{approach}} {{to understanding the}} neuroscientific underpinnings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> of agency is to examine clinical conditions in which purposeful limb movement occurs without an associated sense of agency. The most clear clinical demonstration of this situation is alien hand syndrome. In this condition, associated with specific forms of brain damage, the affected individual loses the sense of agency without losing {{a sense of ownership}} of the affected body part.|$|E
25|$|When, in 1893, the {{unexpected}} invitation came to lecture in Cambridge on the functions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> organs, {{he was already}} deeply read in the subject. He had been captivated by Head's accounts {{of the works of}} Ewald Hering and had absorbed his views on colour vision and the nature of vital processes in living matter with avidity. However, with typical thoroughness he prepared himself for his new duties by spending the summer working in Heidelberg with Emil Kraepelin on measuring the effects of fatigue.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{experiments}} in normal individuals has been undertaken {{in order to}} determine the functional anatomy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> of agency. These experiments have consistently documented the role of the posterior parietal cortex as a critical link within the simulation network for self-recognition. Primary sources have reported that activation of the right inferior parietal lobe/temporoparietal junction correlates with the subjective sense of ownership in action execution,and that posterior parietal lesions, especially on the right side, impair the ability of recognizing one's own body parts and self-attributing one's own movements.|$|E

25|$|From the {{earliest}} days, assessing {{the quality of}} word sense disambiguation (WSD) algorithms had been primarily a matter of intrinsic evaluation, and “almost no attempts {{had been made to}} evaluate embedded WSD components”. Only very recently (2006) had extrinsic evaluations begun to provide some evidence for the value of WSD in end-user applications. Until 1990 or so, discussions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> disambiguation task focused mainly on illustrative examples rather than comprehensive evaluation. The early 1990s saw the beginnings of more systematic and rigorous intrinsic evaluations, including more formal experimentation on small sets of ambiguous words.|$|E
25|$|Various organic {{diseases}} {{may cause}} parosmias (distortion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> of smell). Also, since {{smell and taste}} are intimately linked senses, disorders of gustation (e.g. dysgeusia- taste dysfunction) can present as a complaint related to smell, and vice versa. These conditions, collectively termed chemosensory dysfunctions, are many and varied, and they may trigger a person to complain of an odor than is not present, however the diagnostic criteria for ORS require the exclusion of any such causes. They include pathology of the right hemisphere of the brain, substance abuse, arteriovenous malformations in the brain, and temporal lobe epilepsy.|$|E
25|$|Many {{groups and}} {{individuals}} (both in Morocco and abroad) reacted favorably to the revised code, pointing out that from an economic perspective, it finally legally recognized women’s economic contributions to the household – not an insignificant point, as in 2000, women represented {{over a third of}} the Moroccan workforce. Supporters point out that the reforms indicate a democratization of Moroccan society on two fronts: because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> of pluralism and debate they sparked in the public sphere, and because of their movement towards an individual-based rights system, as opposed to one based on collective rights.|$|E
