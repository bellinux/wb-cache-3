40|$|Abstract Background Spinal surgery {{depends on}} {{accurate}} localization to prevent incorrect surgical approaches. The trend towards {{minimally invasive surgery}} that minimizes surgical exposure and reduces postoperative pain increasingly requires surgeons to accurately determine the operative level before an incision is made. Preoperative localization with a C-arm image intensifier is popular, but the exposure of both patients and theatre staff to radiation is a disadvantage, {{as well as being}} time-consuming. Methods We describe a simple surgical tool developed to help localize exact spinal levels in conjunction with a simple AP X-ray film immediately before surgery. Multiple parallel skin markers were made using a circular <b>oven</b> <b>rack</b> comprising multiple 1. 5 cm spaced parallel wires attached to a circular outside rim. The longest line was placed on the line of the postero-superior iliac spine (PSIS) over the junction of the L 5 -S 1 region. Results and conclusions Based on the film taken, the incision can be accurately made at the intended level. The incision wound can be minimized to 3. 0 cm even when using conventional disc surgery instruments. </p...|$|E

50|$|The flame-grilling {{machine at}} Burger King, Carl's Jr./Hardee's, and other fast food {{restaurants}} {{is called a}} 'broiler'. It works by moving meat patties along a chain conveyor belt between top and bottom burners, grilling {{both sides of the}} meat patty at the same time. This concept was invented in 1898, when the Bridge and Beach Co. of St. Louis, Missouri, started manufacturing a vertical cast iron stove. These stoves were designed to allow the meat to be flame-broiled (flame-grilled) on both sides at the same time. Custom hinged steel wire gridirons were built for use in the vertical broilers. The hinged gridirons were slid {{in and out of the}} stoves holding the meat while it cooked evenly on both sides, like modern day <b>oven</b> <b>racks.</b> These stoves took up a small amount of counter space. They were used in lunch spots to feed factory workers.|$|R

The present work developed an oven for drying process to measure and evalute on drying shrinkage characteristic of choped leaves Madura tobacco. The <b>oven</b> has three <b>racks</b> for analyzing and monitoring the rate of drying shrinkage of Madura tobacco. Every rack has a different amount of chopped leaves as follows: 120 g on top rack, 100 g for middle rack and 80 g for bottom rack. Rate of drying shrinkage was analyzed for 20 minutes. The results showed that every rack has different rate of drying shrinkage for drying time. The rate of drying shrinkage was achieved at 26 - 35 % for all racks with temperature distribution in oven at 25 – 30 C...|$|R
50|$|Professional sheet pans used in {{commercial}} kitchens typically {{are made of}} aluminum, with a 1 in raised lip around the edge, and in the United States come in standard sizes. The full-size sheet pan is 26 by 18 in, which is too large for most home ovens. A two thirds sheet pan (also {{referred to as a}} three quarter size sheet pan) is 21 by 15 in. A half sheet pan is 18 by 13 in; quarter sheets are 9 by 13 in. The half sheet is approximately the same size as mass-market baking sheets found in supermarkets, and the quarter sheet is a common size for rectangular, single-layer cakes. Other commercial kitchen equipment, such as cooling <b>racks,</b> <b>ovens,</b> and shelving, is made to fit these standard pans.|$|R
