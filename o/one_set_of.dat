5|$|El Greco's {{personality}} and work were {{a source of}} inspiration for poet Rainer Maria Rilke. <b>One</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> Rilke's poems (Himmelfahrt Mariae I.II., 1913) was based directly on El Greco's Immaculate Conception. Greek writer Nikos Kazantzakis, who felt a great spiritual affinity for El Greco, called his autobiography Report to Greco and wrote a tribute to the Cretan-born artist.|$|E
5|$|IUPAC {{committee}} {{has a long}} history of officially naming organic and inorganic compounds. IUPAC nomenclature is developed so that any compound can be named under <b>one</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> standardized rules to avoid duplicate names. The first publication, which is information from the International Congress of Applied Chemistry, on IUPAC nomenclature of organic compounds, can be found from the early 20th century in A Guide to IUPAC Nomenclature of Organic Compounds (1900).|$|E
5|$|<b>One</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> {{characteristics}} {{relate to}} body size and temperature. The metabolic theory of ecology provides a predictive qualitative set {{of relationships between}} an organism’s body size and temperature and metabolic processes. In general, smaller, warmer organisms have higher metabolic rates and {{this results in a}} variety of predictions regarding individual somatic growth rates, reproduction and population growth rates, population size, and resource uptake rates.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the {{formation}} of the Devin Townsend Band, Townsend had represented his solo releases live with the Strapping Young Lad lineup; the band would play <b>one</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> Strapping Young Lad songs and <b>one</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> Devin Townsend songs. After the release of Accelerated Evolution, Townsend began touring with The Devin Townsend Band, at times separately from Strapping Young Lad and at times sharing the bill. After playing two release shows in Vancouver in July 2003, The Devin Townsend Band toured Canada with Strapping Young Lad and Zimmers Hole in October 2003. This was followed by a North American tour with progressive metal band Symphony X through November and December 2003.|$|E
5|$|Sole tyre {{supplier}} Pirelli {{brought the}} ultra-soft, supersoft and soft tyres to the event. As per the regulations of the 2016 season, every driver {{had to set}} aside one set {{each of the two}} softest compounds for the race and <b>one</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> the ultrasofts for Q3 (should they advance). The drivers had freedom of what other compounds they chose for the remaining ten out of thirteen sets.|$|E

5|$|The highway {{was first}} {{designated}} by July 1, 1919 along {{a portion of}} the current roadway. In a series of extensions, M-55 was lengthened to connect its current endpoints by the early 1930s. The trunkline has been rerouted in sections since that time resulting in the modern roadway alignment. <b>One</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> changes produced a business loop in the Houghton Lake area.|$|E
5|$|The {{length of}} the {{peninsula}} makes accurate weather prediction difficult for the town; when driving down Melody Line, {{it is not uncommon}} to find it sunny between <b>one</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> tunnels, rainy between another, and foggy between yet another. Ikata's position, stretching out into the ocean, also makes it a frequent target for typhoons.|$|E
5|$|Tyre {{supplier}} Pirelli brought three compounds to Bahrain, {{from which}} drivers {{were allowed to}} choose. The three options for the event were the super-soft, soft and medium compounds, {{the same as for}} the previous round in Australia. Frontrunners Mercedes and Ferrari opted for different strategies in tyre allocation, as Mercedes took only <b>one</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> the harder medium tyres for both their drivers, while Ferrari chose three sets at the expense of soft compound tyres.|$|E

5|$|About half-past {{one o'clock}} on the morning, an {{explosion}} {{took place in}} Felling colliery, by which nine men and thirteen boys were hurried into eternity, several others severely burnt, and all the underground horses but one destroyed. The accident occurred {{at the time of}} calling course, or when <b>one</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> men were relieving another. Several of the morning shift men were standing round the mouth of the pit, waiting to go down, when the blast occurred, and the part who had just descended met it soon after they had reached the bottom of the shaft; these were most miserably burnt and mangled.|$|E
5|$|An older feast, {{held by the}} {{fishermen}} {{towards the end of}} December, included a pie cooked with different fish to represent the variety of catches the men hoped to achieve in the coming year. There is a possibility that Tom Bawcock's Eve is an evolution of this festival. Since 1963, the festival has been run {{against the backdrop of the}} Mousehole village illuminations, where the entire harbour is lit up, along with many other displays. <b>One</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> lights even represents the pie itself, showing fish heads and tails protruding from a pie dish underneath six stars.|$|E
30|$|Forming CCL is done {{by taking}} the paired SUs and {{comparing}} each <b>one’s</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> channels. The channels are recorded and sorted.

50|$|The {{types of}} {{automation}} {{found in some}} of these cameras consisted of the simple programmed shutter, whereby the camera's metering system would select a mechanically <b>set</b> series <b>of</b> apertures with shutter speeds, <b>one</b> <b>setting</b> <b>of</b> which would be sufficient for the correct exposure. In the case of the above-mentioned Kowa and Topcon, automation was semi-automatic, where the camera's CDs meter would select the correct aperture only.|$|R
5|$|As a senator, Nixon {{received}} an annual salary of $12,500 (about $150,000 in 2009 dollars). While he {{received an}} expense allowance of over $75,000, more than most senators received (because California {{was one of the}} most populous states), that money went to pay his staff of 12 and to cover the cost of stationery, telephone service, telegrams, and other office expenses. It also paid for the <b>one</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> round-trip airline tickets between Washington, D.C., and California that Nixon was allowed to buy for himself and his family at taxpayer expense each Congressional session.|$|E
5|$|Body {{piercing}} in some religions is {{held to be}} {{destructive to}} the body. Some passages of the Bible, including Leviticus 19:28, have been interpreted as prohibiting body modification because the body is held to be the property of God. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has taken an official position against most piercings unless for medical reasons, although they accept piercings for women {{as long as there}} is only <b>one</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> piercings in the lower lobe of the ears and no other place on the body. Wearing of very large nose rings on Shabbat is forbidden by the Talmud.|$|E
5|$|By 1877 it {{was clear}} that the {{situation}} had become impractical. After letters were published in The Field deriding the state of affairs it was decided to unite the kicking game under <b>one</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> laws. By this time the FA Cup had helped the FA gain a dominant position within the game. The FA accepted the Sheffield rule allowing throw-ins to be thrown in any direction, as opposed to right angles only as prevails in rugby lineouts. In return the FA's use of a three-man offside was adopted.|$|E

5|$|By {{this time}} work {{had already begun}} on MAR-II on Kwajalein; built by General Electric, it {{differed}} in form and in its beam steering system. The prototype MAR-II was built on reclaimed land {{just west of the}} original Zeus site. MAR-II was built into a pyramid with its back half removed. Like MAR-I, to save money MAR-II would be equipped with only <b>one</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> transmitter and receiver elements, but with all the wiring in place in case it had to be upgraded in the future. Nike-X was canceled before MAR-II was complete, and the semi-completed building was instead used as a climate-controlled storage facility.|$|E
5|$|Further {{tests of}} general {{relativity}} include precision measurements of the Shapiro effect or gravitational time delay for light, most recently in 2002 by the Cassini space probe. <b>One</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> tests focuses on effects predicted by general relativity for the behavior of gyroscopes travelling through space. One of these effects, geodetic precession, has been tested with the Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment (high-precision measurements of the orbit of the Moon). Another, which is related to rotating masses, is called frame-dragging. The geodetic and frame-dragging effects were both tested by the Gravity Probe B satellite experiment launched in 2004, with results confirming relativity to within 0.5% and 15%, respectively, as of December 2008.|$|E
5|$|Magnetic brakes {{were first}} used on Nitro at Six Flags Great Adventure in 2001. Magnetic brakes slow down trains {{much faster than}} {{friction}} brakes; most B roller coasters built in or after 2001 have at least <b>one</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> magnetic brakes. Magnetic brakes do not {{make contact with the}} train. Fins that run parallel to the train are fitted beneath the seats. As the fins pass through the brakes, the magnetic field created by the brakes slows the train. Magnetic brakes have also been used as an alternate type of trim brake on B roller coasters such as Leviathan at Canada's Wonderland.|$|E
