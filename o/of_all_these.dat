5|$|Nearly {{all adult}} caddisflies are terrestrial, but their larvae and pupae are aquatic. They share this {{characteristic}} with several distantly-related groups, namely the dragonflies, mayflies, stoneflies, alderflies and lacewings. The ancestors <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> groups were terrestrial, with open tracheal systems, convergently evolving {{different types of}} gills for their aquatic larvae as they took to the water to avoid predation.|$|E
5|$|The dogs <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> islands were short, {{and their}} sizes vary {{from that of}} a lap-dog to the largest spaniel. Their head is broad, the snout pointed, the eyes very small, the ears upright, and their hair rather long, lank, hard, and of {{different}} colours, but most commonly white and brown. They seldom if ever barked, but howled sometimes, and were shy of strangers to a degree of aversion.|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} methods to render {{matrices}} {{into a more}} easily accessible form. They are generally referred to as matrix decomposition or matrix factorization techniques. The interest <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> techniques is that they preserve certain properties of the matrices in question, such as determinant, rank or inverse, so that these quantities can be calculated after applying the transformation, or that certain matrix operations are algorithmically easier to carry out for some types of matrices.|$|E
5|$|Adaptation occurs {{through the}} gradual {{modification}} of existing structures. Consequently, structures with similar internal organisation {{may have different}} functions in related organisms. This {{is the result of}} a single ancestral structure being adapted to function in different ways. The bones within bat wings, for example, are very similar to those in mice feet and primate hands, due to the descent <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> structures from a common mammalian ancestor. However, since all living organisms are related to some extent, even organs that appear to have little or no structural similarity, such as arthropod, squid and vertebrate eyes, or the limbs and wings of arthropods and vertebrates, can depend on a common set of homologous genes that control their assembly and function; this is called deep homology.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> processes, {{large numbers of}} memorials, more than for any other conflict, were built across the world during the inter-war period. It is {{estimated}} that France built around 176,000 war memorials, including around 36,000 in the local communes. Most of the local commune memorials were built by 1922, but those in the towns and cities typically required more protracted negotiations, and their construction stretched into the 1930s. The 1920s were particularly busy for construction of memorials in Britain, although the trend tailed off in 1930s, with the last inter-war memorial unveiled at the town of Mumbles in 1939. The commissioning of Australian war memorials similarly reduced after the mid-1920s. Over 3,500 Romanian memorials were erected. Many German memorials were built during the 1930s. Russia was unusual in building very few war memorials {{to the events of}} World War I, mainly {{as a result of the}} devastation of the Civil War and the political views of the subsequent Bolshevik government.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of the Allied landing, Imperial Japanese Army forces in the Admiralties {{consisted}} of the 51st Transport Regiment under Colonel Yoshio Ezaki, who was also the overall garrison commander; 2ndBattalion, 1st Independent Mixed Regiment; 1stBattalion, 229th Infantry Regiment; and elements of the IJN's 14th Naval Base Force. Allied G-2 had identified the presence <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> units in the Admiralties, though their designation was not known in all instances. While the 1stBattalion, 229thInfantry Regiment was a veteran of several campaigns, it was short of equipment and lacked its battalion artillery guns. The 2ndBattalion, 1st Independent Mixed Regiment was led by reserve officers who had seen action in China, but most of its enlisted men were recalled reservists who had not previously been in battle.|$|E
5|$|Byng {{allocated}} the Third Army's IV Corps to {{the forthcoming}} operation, {{which was to}} {{become known as the}} Second Battle of Bapaume. IV Corps, commanded by Lieutenant General George Harper comprised five divisions, all of which would be employed during the battle. The first three to be involved were the New Zealand Division along with the 37th and 42nd Divisions. The other two divisions, the 5th and the 63rd Divisions, were held in reserve before being deployed later in the battle. <b>Of</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> divisions, only the New Zealand Division was at full strength. Facing the Third Army was the German 17th Army, commanded by General der Infanterie (General of the Infantry) Otto von Below, made up of eight divisions which, apart from the 4th Bavarian Infantry Division, were all second class formations. A further two divisions were in reserve.|$|E
5|$|During {{the evening}} of 7 August 1944, the attacking forces formed up in six columns, four {{vehicles}} wide, comprising tanks, Kangaroo APCs, half tracks, self-propelled anti-tank guns and Mine flail tanks. At 23:00, Bomber Command commenced the bombardment of German positions along the Caen front. At 23:30, the armoured columns began their advance behind a rolling barrage. Movement was slow at first, many APC drivers became disorientated by the dust caused by the vehicles. Several vehicles became stuck in bomb craters. Simonds had arranged several methods for the columns to maintain direction; some vehicles were fitted with radio direction finders, the artillery fired target-marking shells, Bofors 40 mm guns fired bursts of tracer {{in the direction of}} the advance. In spite <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> measures, there was still confusion. Several vehicles collided or were knocked out.|$|E

5|$|<b>Of</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> fragmentary pre-Hellenistic sources, {{the most}} is known of Sophocles Troilos. Even so, only 54 words have been {{identified}} as coming from the play. Fragment 619 refers to Troilus as an andropais, a man-boy. Fragment 621 indicates that Troilus was going to a spring with a companion to fetch water or to water his horses. A scholion to the Iliad states that Sophocles has Troilus ambushed by Achilles while exercising his horses in the Thymbra. Fragment 623 indicates that Achilles mutilated Troilus' corpse by a method known as maschalismos. This involved preventing the ghost of a murder victim from returning to haunt their killer by cutting off the corpse's extremities and stringing them under its armpits. Sophocles is thought to have also referred to the maschalismos of Troilus in a fragment taken to be from an earlier play Polyxene.|$|E
5|$|Paleontology lies on {{the border}} between biology and geology, but differs from {{archaeology}} in that it excludes the study of anatomically modern humans. It now uses techniques drawn {{from a wide range of}} sciences, including biochemistry, mathematics, and engineering. Use <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> techniques has enabled paleontologists to discover much of the evolutionary history of life, almost all the way back to when Earth became capable of supporting life, about 3.8 billion years ago. As knowledge has increased, paleontology has developed specialised sub-divisions, some of which focus on different types of fossil organisms while others study ecology and environmental history, such as ancient climates.|$|E
5|$|The Swiss Ornithological Institute {{has set up}} a {{monitoring}} program to record breeding populations of woodland birds.

Populations <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> species increased by varying amounts in the period 1990 to 2008.

5|$|A year later, when OPEC met in Vienna on 4 December 2015, the {{organization}} had exceeded its production ceiling for 18 consecutive months, US oil production had declined only slightly from its peak, world markets {{appeared to be}} oversupplied by at least 2 {{million barrels per day}} despite war-torn Libya pumping 1 million barrels below capacity, oil producers were making major adjustments to withstand prices as low as the $40s, Indonesia was rejoining the export organization, Iraqi production had surged after years of disorder, Iranian output was poised to rebound with the lifting of international sanctions, hundreds of world leaders at the Paris Climate Agreement were committing to limit carbon emissions from fossil fuels, and solar technologies were becoming steadily more competitive and prevalent. In light <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> market pressures, OPEC decided to set aside its ineffective production ceiling until the next ministerial conference in June 2016. By 20 January 2016, the OPEC Reference Basket was down to US$22.48/bbl – less than one-fourth of its high from June 2014 ($110.48), less than one-sixth of its record from July 2008 ($140.73), and back below the April 2003 starting point ($23.27) of its historic run-up.|$|E
5|$|In 1927, {{veterinarian}} {{and professor}} Veikko Rislakki (then Svanberg) proposed a different theory in his doctoral thesis. He argued that {{three types of}} wild horses existed in Europe, one of which he {{believed to be the}} Przewalski's Horse. Rislakki believed this unrefined and notably large-headed type was the horse the early Finns encountered about 1000 BCE. He suggested that the Finns later encountered other peoples and horses south of the Gulf of Finland, and that these peoples had better proportioned horses with a shorter muzzle and wider forehead, descended from the Tarpan. In addition, Rislakki suggested that the Finns came across European horses of Spanish and French origin during the first few centuries CE, larger in size and with narrow foreheads. Rislakki believed that his craniometric examinations, carried out in the 1920s, proved the influence <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> three horse types. Almost 20 years later, during the Continuation War, Rislakki also measured Karelian horses, and proposed they also came from an original Northern European animal descended from the Tarpan. Modern studies have discredited theories suggesting modern domesticated horse breeds descending from the Tarpan or the Przewalski's horse. The modern Konik horse resembles the extinct Tarpan however.|$|E
5|$|Shastry {{says that}} rhyme (Antyānuprāsa) is a {{distinguishing}} feature of Rambhadracharya's Sanskrit poetry. Shastry notes that another feature of Rambhadracharya's works is the devotion to motherland and patriotism, {{which is most}} evident in the poetic work Ājādacandraśekharacaritam {{on the life of}} Chandrashekhar Azad. Shastry says that this strong feeling of love towards motherland is reminiscent of old Sanskrit literature including Prithvi Sukta of Atharva Veda, various Puranas including Bhagavata Purana, and also in the Sanskrit works of Swami Bhagavadacharya, a former Jagadguru Ramanandacharya. Dikshit says that the nationalistic play Śrīrāghavābhyudayam establishes Rambhadracharya as a successful playwright at a young age. Dikshit praises the aesthetics of the work Śrīsītārāmakelikaumudī saying that it represents all the six Sampradāyas of Indian literature (Rīti, Rasa, Alaṅkāra, Dhvani, Vakrokti and Aucitya), and that it is a unique work of Rambhadracharya when it comes to figures of speech. Dikshit says that this work places Rambhadracharya in the league of Ritikavya poets like Raskhan, Keshavdas, Ghananand and Padmakar; but observes the distinction that while the works <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> poets are primarily in the Śṛngāra Rasa, Śrīsītārāmakelikaumudī is a work which has Vātsalya Rasa as the primary emotion, which is augmented by Śṛngāra Rasa.|$|E

The region also produces the largest amount of olives, and creates superb olive oil. Lavender is used in many dishes found in Haute Provence. Other important herbs in the cuisine include thyme, sage, rosemary, basil, savory, fennel, marjoram, tarragon, oregano, and bay leaf. Honey is a prized ingredient in the region. Seafood proliferates throughout the coastal area and is heavily represented in the cuisine. Goat cheeses, air-dried sausages, lamb, beef, and chicken are popular here. Garlic* and anchovies are used in many of the region's sauces, as in Poulet Provençal, which uses white wine, tomatoes, herbs, and sometimes anchovies, and Pastis is found everywhere that alcohol is served. The cuisine uses a large amount of vegetables for lighter preparations. Truffles are commonly seen in Provence during the winter. Thirteen desserts in Provence are the traditional Christmas dessert, e.g. quince cheese, biscuits, almonds, nougat, apple, and fougasse.|$|E
5|$|The {{cumulation}} <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> events led Washington {{to request}} Congress {{to establish a}} standing navy. After a contentious debate, Congress passed the Naval Armament Act on March 27, 1794, authorizing construction of six frigates (to be built by Joshua Humphreys). These ships were the first ships of what eventually became the present-day United States Navy. Soon afterward, Congress also authorized funds to obtain a treaty with Algiers and to ransom Americans held captive (199 were alive at that time, including a few survivors from the Maria and the Dauphin). Ratified in September 1795, the final cost of the return of those held captive and peace with Algiers was $642,000, plus $21,000 in annual tribute. The president was unhappy with the arrangement, but realized the U.S. {{had little choice but}} to agree to it. Treaties were also concluded with Tripoli, in 1796, and Tunis in 1797, each carrying with it an annual U.S. tribute payment obligation for protection from attack. The new Navy would not be deployed until after Washington left office; the first two frigates completed were: United States, launched May 10, 1797; and Constitution, launched October 21, 1797.|$|E
5|$|The fort {{with seven}} gates {{contains}} several palaces, pavilions and many temples of Hindu and Jain religions - the earliest dated to the 16th century. A major {{feature of the}} fort is the stone carving done in red and gold coloured sandstones. The interiors of the palaces are decorated and painted in traditional Rajasthani style. The Junagarh palaces have {{a large number of}} rooms, as every king built his own separate set of rooms, not wanting to live in his predecessors’ rooms. These structures were considered as “at par with those of Louis’s France or of Imperial Russia”. Several types of architectural style are discerned in the fort complex and hence it is called a true depiction of composite culture. The earliest style is of Rajput architecture, defined by Gujarati and Mughal architectural influence reflecting the association with Mughal rulers, the second type is of semi-western architecture reflecting British influence, and finally the revivalists Rajput architecture that evolved particularly during the rule of Maharaja Ganga Singh. Only the most representative <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> architectural styles are on display for visitors.
