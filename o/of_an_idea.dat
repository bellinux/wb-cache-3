5|$|In the Computer Edge case, the Australian court {{decided against}} the then-prevailing {{opinions}} in other courts (the U.K., Canada, South Africa, and the U.S.) and ruled object code was not copyrightable, while the Supreme Court of Canada in Apple v. Mackintosh reversed its earlier decisions and ruled that because object code was {{a translation of}} source code and embodied in a silicon chip, it was therefore a translation of an original literary work expressed in a material form and unauthorized reproduction of the object code was therefore an infringement of copyright. The Canadian court opined that programs within ROM silicon chips are protected under the Copyright Act of Canada and the conversion from the source code into object code {{is a form of}} translation. It further held that such translation does not include the expression <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> in another form, but rather only applies to the expression <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> in another language, and that a translation has a one-to-one correspondence between works that are expressed in two different languages.|$|E
5|$|Inspiration for {{the book}} came from a Douglas-fir tree with a curve in its trunk. While sitting by the tree, at his home on Quadra Island, near Vancouver, David Suzuki {{realized}} that even though his family had played on it for years, {{he did not know}} how old it was or how its uncharacteristic curve had developed. Suzuki, a science writer and broadcaster, and former zoologist, speculated that the soil might have slid when the tree was young or that another plant might have blocked the sunlight. He thought that the tree must have endured much hardship throughout its life and made a connection between biographies of people and the story of this tree's life. It also reminded him <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> he had for a children's book about interconnectivity of life, especially within plants. Along with a research assistant, he studied the topic. Suzuki started to write a draft but a busy schedule interfered so he sought a collaborator. Science writer and former Harrowsmith editor Wayne Grady agreed to participate. Suzuki provided the research, framework, and some original writing and Grady did most of the writing. Together, Grady in Ontario and Suzuki in Vancouver, went through five drafts. Wildlife artist Robert Bateman was brought into the project through social connections between the wives of Bateman and Suzuki. In creating the book, their intention was to illustrate the complexity and interconnectivity of this ecosystem by focusing on one tree's role over time.|$|E

25|$|So it {{was more}} {{efficient}} and more moral to go for selected targets. In any case, {{it was the only}} way we could operate, because we were so small. For us it was not a question of the professional honor of a soldier, it was the question <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea,</b> an aim that had to be achieved. We were aiming at a political goal. There are many examples of what we did to be found in the Bible – Gideon and Samson, for instance. This had an influence on our thinking. And we also learned from the history of other peoples who fought for their freedom – the Russian and Irish revolutionaries, Giuseppe Garibaldi and Josip Broz Tito.|$|E
25|$|Michael Levin, {{born and}} raised in Pennsylvania, USA moved to Israel in 2002 and joined the Paratroopers Brigade of the Israel Defense Forces.

Levin had told <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> for a center for lone soldiers, which would provide them with meals, support and advice. With the support of Tziki Aud, a Jewish Agency employee who had known Levin, a group of former lone soldiers established the Lone Soldier Center in memory of Michael Levin in 2009.|$|E
25|$|A proper {{definition}} {{limits the}} kind of reasoning undertaken in the processing <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea,</b> expressed in natural language, with the object of limiting the impact of optimistic thinking that tends to result in an ideal-final explanation as the truth. One requirement of a definition {{is that if we}} define that A is equal to B, then the reverse (B is equal to A) must also be true, or it is necessary to modify the original definition (A = B). In addition, a proper definition should have the following components: (1) it should be as simple as possible; (2) it should not involve circular reasoning; (3) it must be general or common; (4) metaphor, analogy, figurative language, description, obscure words, ghaib (occult words), abstractions, and vagueness are forbidden; and (5) a definition should not contain any negative statement.|$|E

25|$|The Hongwu Emperor was {{wary of the}} {{political}} and social consequences that the maritime commerce could bring, so he sought to restrain it by outlawing private maritime trade. This policy continued well into the Yongle Emperor's reign. However, the Yongle Emperor himself aimed at consolidating imperial control over the maritime commerce, stopping the coastal criminality and disorder, providing employment for mariners and entrepreneurs, exporting Chinese products to foreign markets, importing desired goods for Chinese consumers, extending the tributary system, and displaying imperial majesty to the seas. The voyages functioned as trade commissions in the government's attempts of regulating the private maritime commerce by establishing an imperial monopoly over it and incorporate it into the tributary system. There was seemingly some sort <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> about a foreign policy comprising an extended foreign trade, which came to be supported by a heavy military naval presence and a cultivation of shared interests with local allies.|$|E
25|$|Scholarly {{peer review}} (also known as refereeing) {{is the process}} of {{subjecting}} an author's scholarly work, research, or ideas to the scrutiny of others who are experts in the same field, before a paper describing this work is published in a journal or as a book. The peer review helps the publisher (that is, the editor-in-chief or the editorial board) decide whether the work should be accepted, considered acceptable with revisions, or rejected. Peer review requires a community of experts in a given (and often narrowly defined) field, who are qualified and able to perform reasonably impartial review. Impartial review, especially of work in less narrowly defined or inter-disciplinary fields, may be difficult to accomplish, and the significance (good or bad) <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> may never be widely appreciated among its contemporaries. Peer review is generally considered necessary to academic quality and is used in most major scientific journals, but it does by no means prevent publication of all invalid research. Traditionally, peer reviewers have been anonymous, but there is currently a significant amount of open peer review, where the comments are visible to readers, generally with the identities of the peer reviewers disclosed as well.|$|E
25|$|Hearing loss {{among the}} aged {{community}} lessens elders' ability {{to compensate for}} other age related social and/or physical problems. Communication problems of elderly adults can be greatly impacted by mechanical problems such as: the translation of ideas into linguistic representation or expression, the perception of linguistic stimuli or the derivation <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> from a given unit of disclosure. Changes in these mechanical problems {{are more important than}} changes in linguistic knowledge. The main goal of hearing aids is to improve communication and quality of life, not just to restore hearing. Presbycusis {{is an example of a}} hearing deficit that cannot be corrected by hearing aids. Presbycusis, the alteration of hearing sensitivity associated with normal hearing loss, is caused by the decreased amount of hair cells of the inner ear. This is normally caused by long periods of distressing noise that diminish the hair cells which with increasing age will not grow back. Presbycusis and other such hearing-related problems promote social withdrawal, as individuals begin to lose touch with the world around them. Hearing loss among the aged community lessens elders' ability to compensate for other age-related social and/or physical problems. This impairment can cause elders to lose touch of social skills because they may have trouble keeping up with fast-paced or hearing different pitched voices in conversation.|$|E
