5|$|As the {{reactors}} at Hanford came online, the Metallurgical Laboratory turned its {{attention back to}} theoretical designs. The discovery of spontaneous fission in reactor-bred plutonium due to contamination by plutonium-240 led Wigner to propose switching to breeding uranium-233 from thorium, but the challenge was met by the Los Alamos Laboratory developing an implosion-type nuclear weapon design. Wigner was also intrigued by the possibility <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> away {{with much of the}} complexities of a reactor by having the uranium in solution or a slurry in heavy water. The Metallurgical Laboratory attempted to find a way <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> this.|$|E
5|$|Bear McCreary {{was hired}} to compose the score for the series. McCreary stated that the main theme was based on his viewing of {{production}} designs for the opening title sequence.

5|$|Identification of AVMs {{requires}} detailed {{medical imaging}} of the organs most commonly affected by these lesions. Not all AVMs cause symptoms or {{are at risk}} <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> so, and hence there is a degree of variation between specialists as to whether such investigations would be performed, and by which modality; often, decisions on this issue are reached together with the patient.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the effects of the Body Condition Score (BCS) <b>of</b> 53 Saanen <b>does</b> on their reproductive performance 15 days before mating season and at the beginning of the mating season under raised semi intensive conditions. In this study, the does were synchronized in two different periods, one of which was 15 days before the other. Before the introduction of buck to the goats, the goats were weighed after measuring their BCS. Detailed records were kept for herd in year. It was found significant effects of mating period on body weight <b>of</b> <b>does</b> before mating and fecundity (p< 0. 05); effects of age on body weight <b>of</b> <b>does</b> before mating (p< 0. 001), body weight <b>of</b> <b>does</b> on birth (p< 0. 01), fecundity (p< 0. 01) and litter size (p< 0. 05), effect of BCS on body weight <b>of</b> <b>does</b> before mating (p< 0. 001), fecundity (p< 0. 01) and litter size (p< 0. 05). The BCS for the highest fecundity and litter size was determined = 2. 01 while the lowest rates for these traits were = 1. 50. Average of body weight <b>of</b> <b>does</b> before mating, body weight <b>of</b> <b>does</b> on birth, kid birth weigh, fecundity and litter size were 35. 65, 42. 71, 3. 44, 0. 65, 0. 65 and 1. 30 kg, respectively...|$|R
50|$|A dowry <b>of</b> <b>dos</b> recepticia was one {{in which}} {{agreements}} were made in advance about its disposal and recovery. A dowry <b>of</b> <b>dos</b> profecticia was one given by the bride's father or her paterfamilias; it could be recovered by the donor or by the divorced woman herself. A dowry <b>of</b> <b>dos</b> adventicia was more flexible; it might be given by the wife, though it came from her father, and used to settle a debt incurred by the husband. If she divorced, a wife could reclaim this dowry; if she died, the husband kept it.|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of the study were}} to investigate the effects of genotype [Thai native (TN), 25 % Anglo-Nubian cross-bred (AN) and 50 % AN], season of mating (dry season, moderate rainy season and heavy rainy season) and year of mating (1992 - 1998) on proportion <b>of</b> <b>does</b> mated and incidence of oestrus during pregnancy. On average, 63. 6 % <b>of</b> <b>does</b> were mated within 14 days of buck introduction and the proportion for TN, 25 % AN and 50 % AN does mated in this period were 67. 5, 58. 0 and 60. 3 %, respectively. The proportions <b>of</b> <b>does</b> mated within 14 days in dry, moderate rainy and heavy rainy seasons were 61. 2, 62. 7 and 66. 7 %, respectively. In 1998, only 36. 1 % <b>of</b> <b>does</b> were mated within 14 days whereas 48. 1 % were mated after 21 days of buck introduction. Moreover, 10. 9 % <b>of</b> <b>does</b> in this study showed signs of oestrus during pregnancy and 48. 1 % occured within 7 days...|$|R

5|$|A {{multi-purpose}} breed, the Norman Cob {{was formerly}} used wherever {{there was a}} need. It was utilized {{in a variety of}} agricultural and other work by farmers, and was used by the army for pulling artillery. The postal service used it to pull mail carriages, which it was capable <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> at a fast trot over bad roads for long distances. Postal workers appreciated the breed for its willingness to remain calm, stationary and tethered for long periods of time. Due to the modernization of agriculture and transport, it is now used very little in these areas.|$|E
5|$|Aflaq {{moved to}} Baghdad {{following}} his reelection to the Secretary Generalship in February 1968. He stayed there until 1970, when Black September happened, he criticised the Ba'ath leadership <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> {{too little to}} help the Palestine Liberation Organisation during the conflict. During the conflict, Aflaq lobbied extensively for Yasser Arafat and the PLO. Aflaq wanted Iraqi intervention; al-Bakr, however, refused to get Iraq involved in such a conflict. Because of this, Aflaq returned to Lebanon in self-imposed exile. The government of Hafez al-Assad, the President of Syria, condemned Aflaq to death in absentia in 1971.|$|E

5|$|After {{four years}} <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> his {{residency}} in Singkawang, Borneo, Dr. Pardi (Adnan Kapau Gani) returns to Java {{to open a}} practice. Before then, he goes to Cigading to visit his family and give them souvenirs. Upon arrival he is stunned to find that his family's maid Tati (Djoewariah), who had been his childhood playmate, is now a grown and beautiful woman. He secretly begins to fawn over Tati, although he does not tell her the reason. When Pardi's mother tells him he should marry quickly, he refuses all of her suggested brides. He says only that he already has someone in mind, aware that his mother would never approve an inter-class marriage with the maid.|$|E
5|$|Along with {{tangible}} goods, people, techniques, information, {{and ideas}} moved lucidly across the Eurasian landmass {{for the first}} time. For example, John of Montecorvino, archbishop of Beijing founded Roman Catholic missions in India and China and also translated the New Testament into the Mongolian language. Long-distance trade brought new methods <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> business from the far East to Europe; bills of exchange, deposit banking, and insurance were introduced to Europe during the Pax Mongolica. Bills of exchange made it significantly easier to travel long distances because a traveller would not be burdened {{by the weight of}} metal coins.|$|E
5|$|Being unemployed, {{we spent}} {{almost all of}} each weekday at the school, so if a tuition fee had been applicable, Mrs Mac would have earned a tidy sum of money.

It would be true {{to say that a}} great number of the pilots whose futures were finally fulfilled in airlines in Australia owe a deal to Mrs Mac... There was no other school operating in Sydney at the time, providing Morse training to potential airline pilots, and no other school then or thereafter giving such training completely free of charge.|$|E
