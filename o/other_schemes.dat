5|$|On {{his return}} to England, Baden-Powell noticed that boys showed {{considerable}} interest in Aids to Scouting, which was unexpectedly used by teachers and youth organizations as their first Scouting handbook. He was urged to rewrite this book for boys, especially during an inspection of the Boys' Brigade, a large youth movement drilled with military precision. Baden-Powell thought {{this would not be}} attractive and suggested that the Boys' Brigade could grow much larger were Scouting to be used. He studied <b>other</b> <b>schemes,</b> parts of which he used for Scouting.|$|E

5|$|The {{road was}} {{eventually}} built as planned, and opened to traffic in 1999, but the increased costs involved in management and policing of protesters raised {{the profile of}} such campaigns in the United Kingdom, and contributed to several road schemes being cancelled or reviewed {{later on in the}} decade. Those involved in the protest moved on to oppose <b>other</b> <b>schemes</b> in the country, while opinions of the road as built have since been mixed. By 2014, the road had become the ninth most congested in the entire country.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} <b>other</b> <b>schemes</b> for the {{remainder}} of the below-standard parts of the A303 were considered in the 1990s, including improvements west of Ilminster towards Marsh and the single-carriageway section around Yeovilton. These proposals were all cancelled in 1998. The schemes were remitted to the London to South West and South Wales Multi-Modal Study (SWARMMS), and the conclusion of the report was that all of the schemes east of Ilminster should go ahead; and to avoid building a dual carriageway through the Blackdown Hills the A358 should be upgraded to the M5 at Taunton. In 2009, none were considered to be regional priorities, so no other improvements were likely to be funded in the short term.|$|E
5|$|Charles Pearson (1793–1862) had {{proposed}} an underground railway connecting the City of London {{with the main}} line rail termini in around 1840. In 1854 he commissioned the first traffic survey, determining that each day 200,000 walked into the City, 44,000 travelled by omnibus, and 26,000 in private carriages. A Parliamentary Commission backed Pearson's proposal over <b>other</b> <b>schemes.</b> Despite concerns about vibration causing subsidence of buildings, the problems of compensating the many thousands whose homes were destroyed during digging of the tunnel, and fears that the tunnelling might break into Hell, construction began in 1860. On 9January 1863 the line opened as the Metropolitan Railway (MR), the world's first underground passenger railway.|$|E

5|$|In 1837 Euston {{railway station}} opened, the first railway station {{connecting}} London with the industrial heartlands of the West Midlands and Lancashire. Railways were banned by a Parliamentary commission from operating in London itself, {{and thus the}} station was built on {{what was then the}} northern boundary of the city. Other main line termini north of London soon followed at Paddington (1838), Bishopsgate (1840), Fenchurch Street (1841), King's Cross (1852) and St Pancras (1868). All were built outside the built-up area of the city, making them inconvenient to reach. Charles Pearson (1793–1862) had proposed the idea of an underground railway connecting the City of London with the relatively distant London main line rail termini in around 1840. In 1854 to promote the scheme he commissioned the first ever traffic survey, determining that each day 200,000 walked into the City of London, 44,000 travelled by omnibus, and 26,000 travelled in private carriages. A Parliamentary Commission backed Pearson's proposal over <b>other</b> <b>schemes.</b>|$|E

25|$|Within the UK itself {{there are}} two systems: one for Great Britain, which dates from 2001, and another for Northern Ireland, {{which is similar to}} the {{original}} 1904 system. Both systems are administered by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) in Swansea; until July 2014, Northern Ireland's system was administered by the Driver and Vehicle Agency (DVA) in Coleraine, which had the same status as the DVLA. <b>Other</b> <b>schemes</b> relating to the UK are also listed below.|$|E

25|$|The speaker {{mounting}} scheme (including cabinets) {{can also}} cause diffraction, resulting in peaks and dips in the frequency response. The problem is usually greatest at higher frequencies, where wavelengths are similar to, or smaller than, cabinet dimensions. The effect can be minimized by rounding the front edges of the cabinet, curving the cabinet itself, using a smaller or narrower enclosure, choosing a strategic driver arrangement, using absorptive material around a driver, {{or some combination of}} these and <b>other</b> <b>schemes.</b>|$|E
25|$|Under the Köppen–Geiger climate {{classification}} system, Dnipro has a hot-summer humid {{continental climate}} (Dfa) with hot summers and cold, snowy winters. However, according to <b>other</b> <b>schemes</b> (such as the Salvador Rivas-Martínez bioclimatic one), Dnipro has a Supratemperate bioclimate, and {{belongs to the}} Temperate xeric steppic thermoclimatic belt, due to high evapotranspiration, Dnipro is in the transition zone between a humid subtropical climate (Cfa) and a hot-summer humid continental climate (Dfa), with relatively drier summers {{than the rest of}} the year.|$|E
25|$|RFID tags {{are often}} a complement, but not a substitute, for UPC or EAN barcodes. They may never {{completely}} replace barcodes, {{due in part to}} their higher cost and the advantage of multiple data sources on the same object. Also, unlike RFID labels, barcodes can be generated and distributed electronically, e.g. via e-mail or mobile phone, for printing or display by the recipient. An example is airline boarding passes. The new EPC, along with several <b>other</b> <b>schemes,</b> is widely available at reasonable cost.|$|E
