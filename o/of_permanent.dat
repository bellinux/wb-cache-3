40|$|AbstractIn {{this note}} we settle two open {{problems}} in the theory <b>of</b> <b>permanents</b> by using recent results from other areas of mathematics.

Bapat conjectured that certain quotients <b>of</b> <b>permanents,</b> which generalize symmetric function means, are concave. We prove this conjecture by using concavity properties of hyperbolic polynomials. Motivated by problems on random point processes, Shirai and Takahashi raised the problem: Determine all real numbers α for which the α-permanent (or α-determinant) is nonnegative for all positive semidefinite matrices.
