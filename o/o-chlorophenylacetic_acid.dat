40|$|This {{research}} was directed mainly towards {{the investigation of}} the reacti. ons ofÂ· substituted chlorobenziophenones under strongly basi,c conditions. The work 'can be divided into two main sections. The Introduction deals mainly with historical studies on aryne chemistry and the Haller-Bauer reaction. Secti. on I i. s concerned with syntheses of 2 -benzamido- 2 'chlorobenzophenone and 2 -benzamido~ 3 '-chlorobenzophenone,and with thei,r respective reactions wi. th potassium amide in ammonia. <b>o-Chlorophenylacetic</b> <b>acid</b> was converted to the acid chloride and then by Friedel-Craftsreaction with benzene to w-(o-chlorophenyl) acetophenone. Reaction wi. th phenylhydrazine and Fischer cyclization gave 3 - (0 chlorophenyl) - 2 -phenylindole, which was ozonized to 2 -benzamido- 2 'chlorobenzophenone. The isomeric 3 ' -chlor, [...] o ke: tone was similarly synthesised from m-chlorophenylacetic acid. Both the 2 '- and 3 ' -ch. loroketones gave N-benzoylacridone on treatment with potassium amide in ammonia; an aryne mechanism is involved for the 3 '-chloroketone but aryne and nucleophilic substitution mechanisms are possible for the 2 '-chloroketone. Hydrolysis of the 2 '- and 3 '-chloroketones gave 2 -amino- 2 'chlorobenzophenone and 2 -amino- 3 '-chlorobenzophenone respectively. A second new acridone synthesis is given in the Appendix involving reactions of these two ketones with potassium t-butoxide in t-butylbenzene. i Section 2 deals with {{the investigation of the}} reaction of some tricyclic ch 1 orobenzophenones with potassium amide in liquid ammonia. These were 1 -ch 1 orof 1 uorenone; which was pr~pared in several steps from f 1 uoranthene, and 1 - and 2 -ch 1 oroanthraquinones. 1 -Ch 1 orof 1 uorenone gave 1 -aminof 1 uorenone; 1 -ch 1 oroanthraquinone gave 1 - and 2 -aminoanthraquinones; 2 -ch 1 oroanthraquinone was largely recovered from the attempted reaction...|$|E
