40|$|Motivated by {{call center}} {{cosourcing}} problems, we consider a service network operated under an <b>overflow</b> mechanism. Calls are first routed to an in-house (or dedicated) service station {{that has a}} finite waiting room. If the waiting room is full, the call is <b>overflowed</b> to an outside provider (an <b>overflow</b> station) that might also be serving <b>overflows</b> from other stations. We establish approximations for <b>overflow</b> networks with many servers under a resource-pooling assumption that stipulates, in our context, that the fraction of <b>overflowed</b> calls is nonnegligible. Our two main results are (i) an approximation for the <b>overflow</b> processes via limit theorems and (ii) asymptotic independence between each of the in-house stations and the <b>overflow</b> station. In particular, we show that, as the system becomes large, the dependency between each in-house station and the <b>overflow</b> station becomes negligible. Independence between stations in <b>overflow</b> networks is assumed {{in the literature on}} call centers, and we provide a rigorous support for those useful heuristics.

40|$|Motor <b>overflow</b> {{refers to}} overt {{involuntary}} movement, or covert muscle activity, that sometimes co-occurs with voluntary movement. Various clinical populations exhibit <b>overflow.</b> Motor <b>overflow</b> is {{also present in}} healthy children and the elderly, although in young adults, overt <b>overflow</b> is considered abnormal unless elicited under conditions of extreme force or muscle fatigue. Current theories of <b>overflow</b> imply that the corpus callosum may mediate production of this phenomenon. However, given that the corpus callosum is a conduit enabling the transfer of cortical information, surprisingly few studies have considered the cortical or subcortical structures underlying <b>overflow.</b> This review considers the developmental trend of motor <b>overflow</b> production, specifically in the upperlimbs, and the mechanisms thought to underlie this age-related phenomenon. Potential neurological correlates of motor <b>overflow</b> {{will be discussed in}} conjunction with higher order attentional processes which also regulate motor <b>overflow</b> production.

40|$|Across Australia {{sewerage}} {{systems are}} designed with emergency <b>overflow</b> structures to discharge untreated sewage into local waterways in case of system overload or breakdown. Our aim {{was to determine the}} impacts of sewage <b>overflows</b> and potential risks to the public and ecosystem health in the tidal waterways of the coastal suburb of Lota. Expectations for improved sewerage system performance are driven by the belief that sewage <b>overflows</b> cause significant environmental harm. However, the research presented here shows that during a large wet weather event, stormwater, and not the <b>overflow,</b> was the dominant stressor of ecological health. Even during dry weather the impacts of <b>overflow</b> events were likely to be low and restricted to the mixing zone at the point of <b>overflow.</b> However, sewage <b>overflows,</b> in dry and wet weather, did pose an unacceptably high public health hazard to potential swimmers in Lota Creek until the <b>overflow</b> stopped and there was a complete tidal exchange with the estuary.
