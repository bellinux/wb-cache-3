40|$|This study {{looks into}} the price {{behavior}} <b>of</b> five <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> – aluminum, copper, zinc, lead and nickel traded on Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX), using near month futures contracts and spot contracts for the period from November 2007 to January 2013. To {{assess the impact of}} the recent Global Financial Crisis on trading <b>of</b> <b>base</b> <b>metals,</b> the price volatility <b>of</b> the <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> has been examined using GARCH models. The paper also studies the effect of implied volatility of equity market, measured by India VIX on the price volatility <b>of</b> the five <b>base</b> <b>metals.</b> The findings <b>of</b> the study suggest that there is presence of short term persistence in price volatility of the metals, and the daily price volatility <b>of</b> <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> is influenced by the Global Financial Crisis. The implied volatility in equity market is also found to affect the price volatility of the metals. Thus, the paper gives important evidence in support of the introduction of option contracts on <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> in Indian Commodity Markets, since option contracts are priced considering the price volatility of the underlying asset. ...|$|R

25|$|The first {{circulating}} United States coins were cents (pennies), {{produced in}} 1793, and made entirely from copper. Silver content was reduced in many coins in the 19th century (use of billon), {{and the first}} coins made entirely <b>of</b> <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> (e.g. nickel, cupronickel, aluminium bronze), representing values higher than {{the value of their}} metal, were minted in the mid 19th century.|$|E
25|$|Silver 200 forint coins were {{withdrawn}} in 1998 (as their {{nominal value}} was too {{low compared to}} their precious metal content); the 1 and 2 forint coins remained in circulation until 29 February 2008. For cash purchases, the total price is now rounded to the nearest 5 forint (to 0 or to 5).

25|$|In 1958, new coinage entirely <b>of</b> <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> was introduced, {{consisting}} of bronze 1 centavo, brass 5 centavos and nickel-brass 10, 25 and 50 centavos. In 1967, the coinage was altered {{to reflect the}} use of Filipino names for the currency units. 1-piso coins were introduced in 1972. In 1975, the Ang Bagong Lipunan Series was introduced with a new 5-piso coin included. Aluminium replaced bronze, and cupro-nickel replaced nickel-brass that year. The Flora and Fauna series was introduced in 1983 which included 2-piso coins. The sizes of the coins were reduced in 1991, with production of 50-centavo and 2-piso coins ceasing in 1994. The current series of coins was introduced in 1995, with 10-piso coins added in 2000.|$|E

500|$|Hearings on the president's proposal, {{introduced}} as H.R. 8926, began before the House Banking and Currency Committee on June 4. Chairman Wright Patman, the bill's sponsor, deemed {{it to have}} something for everyone, including price supports for silver, though industrial users would benefit most, as the silver formerly used in coinage would be freed up for commercial use. Most business stakeholders, including the banks, the vending machine operators, and corporate leaders, {{wanted to see the}} bill pass, it being better than the current situation. [...] On June 11, the committee issued a report recommending the bill pass, with amendments requiring the half dollar to be made <b>of</b> <b>base</b> <b>metal,</b> requiring the silver coins that would be struck during the transition period to be dated 1964, and banning the striking of silver dollars for five years.|$|E
500|$|The gold solidi are all {{close to}} their {{theoretical}} weight of 4.48g ( [...] of a Roman pound). The fineness of a solidus in this period was 99% gold. The total weight of the solidi in the hoard is almost exactly 8 Roman pounds, suggesting that the coins had been measured out by weight rather than number. Analysis of the siliquae suggests a range of fineness of between 95% and 99% silver, with {{the highest percentage of}} silver found just after a reform of the coinage in 368. Of the siliquae, 428 are locally produced imitations, generally of high quality and with as much silver as the official siliquae of the period. However, a handful are cliché forgeries where a core <b>of</b> <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> has been wrapped in silver foil.|$|E
500|$|The {{introduction}} of the five-cent copper-nickel piece greatly decreased the popularity {{and use of the}} three-cent piece. The three-cent piece had debuted in 1865 with a mintage of over eleven million and nearly five million in 1866; thereafter strikings declined, falling to under a million by 1871, a figure the coin would thereafter exceed only twice. The public had preferred small bronze coins to paper money, then the three-cent nickel piece rather than the bronze; they now preferred the five-cent nickel to the three. One reason for this was that the base metal five-cent piece would be redeemed by the government if presented in $100 lots pursuant to a provision in the authorizing legislation. There was no such provision for the three-cent nickel piece; neither was there any for the other base metal coins. Following Pollock's resignation in 1866 over his objections to President Johnson's Reconstruction policies, the new Mint Director was Henry Linderman, who in his first annual report in 1867, described the redemption clause in the nickel's authorizing legislation as [...] "a most wise and just provision", urging its extension to the cent, two-cent piece, and three-cent piece. Postmasters were compelled to take three-cent nickel pieces in exchange for stamps, but had difficulty in depositing them in the Treasury in payment of their obligations, as the government would take no more than sixty cents worth of them in a single transaction. Private individuals and firms similarly refused them beyond the legal tender limit; those with a surplus <b>of</b> <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> coins often sold them at a discount.|$|E
30|$|Al-Cu joints are {{difficult}} to manufacture by fusion welding processes due to the {{significant difference in the}} chemical composition and physical properties <b>of</b> the <b>base</b> <b>metals.</b> Consequently, these type of dissimilar joints are mostly welded by solid-state welding processes, where only the differences in the physical and mechanical properties <b>of</b> the <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> need to be considered (Joseph 2006). With fusion welding processes, on the other hand, many more factors have to be considered, such as the dilution of the filler <b>metal</b> and <b>base</b> <b>metals,</b> the physical properties <b>of</b> the <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> and filler metal and the heat treatment used.|$|R

The pre-existing, national currency yuan came to be associated only with the Nationalist, Kuomintang government. In 1935, the Kuomintang Government enacted currency reforms to limit currency issuance to four major government controlled banks: the Bank of China, Central Bank of China, Bank of Communications and later the Farmers Bank of China. The circulation of silver yuan coins was prohibited and private ownership of silver was banned. The banknotes issued in its place were known as fabi (...) or [...] "Legal tender".

2500|$|The {{definition}} of riba in classical Islamic jurisprudence was [...] "surplus value without counterpart." [...] When [...] "currencies <b>of</b> <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> were first {{introduced in the}} Islamic world, no jurist ever thought that paying a debt in a higher number of units of this fiat money was riba" [...] as they were concerned with {{the real value of}} money rather than the numerical value. For example, it was acceptable for a loan of 1000 gold dinars to be paid back as 1050 dinars of total equal mass. The rationale behind riba according to classical Islamic jurists was [...] "to ensure equivalency in real value" [...] and that the [...] "numerical value was [...]" [...] Thus an interest rate that did not exceed the rate of inflation was not riba according to classical Islamic jurists.|$|E
