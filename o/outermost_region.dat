25|$|On 22 February 2007, Saint Martin and Saint Barthélemy {{were broken}} {{away from the}} French {{overseas}} department of Guadeloupe to form new overseas collectivities. As a consequence their EU status was unclear for a time. While a report issued by the French parliament suggested that the islands remained within the EU as outermost regions, European Commission documents listed them as being outside the European Community. The legal status of the islands was clarified on the coming into force of the Lisbon Treaty which listed them as an <b>outermost</b> <b>region.</b> However, Saint Barthélemy ceased being an <b>outermost</b> <b>region</b> and left the EU, to become an OCT, on 1 January 2012.|$|E

25|$|A new {{provision}} in the Treaty of Lisbon is that the status of French, Dutch and Danish overseas territories can be changed more easily, by no longer requiring a full treaty revision. Instead, the European Council may, on the initiative of the member state concerned, change the status of an overseas country or territory (OCT) to an <b>outermost</b> <b>region</b> (OMR) or vice versa. This provision was included on a proposal by the Netherlands, which was investigating {{the future of the}} Netherlands Antilles and Aruba in the European Union as part of an institutional reform process that was taking place in the Netherlands Antilles.|$|E
25|$|PfEMP1 is a {{large family}} of {{proteins}} having high molecular weights ranging from 200 to 350 kDa. The wide range of molecular size reflects extreme variation in the amino acid composition of the proteins. But all the PfEMP1 proteins {{can be described as}} having three basic structural components, namely, an extracellular domain (ECD), a transmembrane domain (TMD) and an intracellular acidic terminal segment (ATS). The extracellular domain is fully exposed on the cell surface, and is the most variable region. It consists of a number of sub-domains, including a short and conserved N terminal segment (NTS) at the <b>outermost</b> <b>region,</b> followed by a highly variable Duffy-binding-like (DBL) domain, sometimes a Ca2+-binding C2 domain, and then one or two cysteine-rich interdomain regions (CIDRs).|$|E
25|$|The Canary Islands are a Spanish {{archipelago}} off the African coast {{which form}} {{one of the}} 17 Autonomous Communities of Spain–the country's principal first-level administrative division.

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is to {{identify}} basic characteristics related to position of the <b>outermost</b> <b>regions</b> of the member states of the EU within EU development policies. These regions are evaluated {{from the point of}} view including allocated funding within Structural Funds (SF) and European Structural and Investments Funds during the programming periods of 2000 - 2006, 2007 - 2013, and 2014 - 2020, content of the operational programmes, and basic economic indicators. The <b>outermost</b> <b>regions</b> shows lower values of GDP per capita than European regions of the same country while showing higher allocated funding per capita than the European regions of the same country. The <b>outermost</b> <b>regions</b> also shows constantly growing GDP per capita at least from 2000 while the SF and ESIF allocated funding for the regions decreases. These findings are predictable. Interesting finding is that while the regional GDP of the <b>outermost</b> <b>regions</b> increases investments efforts do not shift towards soft projects. The investments efforts show steadily hard project implementation activities and increasing ratio of environmental projects, which are mostly hard projects. This finding creates space for improving concept of more developed regions focusing of soft projects and less developed regions focusing on hard projects...|$|R

2500|$|The {{archipelago}} is {{just under}} [...] north of Tenerife, Canary Islands. Since 1976, the archipelago {{has been one}} of the two autonomous regions of Portugal (the other being the Azores, located to the northwest). It includes the islands of Madeira, Porto Santo, and the Desertas, administered together with the separate archipelago of the Savage Islands. The region has political and administrative autonomy through the Administrative Political Statue of the Autonomous Region of Madeira provided for in the Portuguese Constitution. The autonomous region is an integral part of the European Union, having pronounced status as an <b>outermost</b> <b>region</b> of the European Union, as detailed in Article 299-2 of the Treaty of the European Union.|$|E
2500|$|Saturn's {{magnetosphere}} {{is often}} {{divided into four}} regions. The innermost region co-located with Saturn's planetary rings, inside approximately 3Rs, has a strictly dipolar magnetic field. It is largely devoid of plasma, which is absorbed by ring particles, although the radiation belts of Saturn are located in this innermost region just {{inside and outside the}} rings. The second region between 3 and 6Rs contains the cold plasma torus and is called the inner magnetosphere. It contains the densest plasma in the saturnian system. The plasma in the torus originates from the inner icy moons and particularly from Enceladus. The magnetic field in this region is also mostly dipolar. [...] The third region lies between 6 and 12–14Rs and is called the dynamic and extended plasma sheet. The magnetic field in this region is stretched and non-dipolar, whereas the plasma is confined to a thin equatorial plasma sheet. The fourth <b>outermost</b> <b>region</b> is located beyond 15Rs at high latitudes and continues up to magnetopause boundary. It is characterized by a low plasma density and a variable, non-dipolar magnetic field strongly influenced by the Solar wind.|$|E

2500|$|The Comoros has {{repeatedly}} pressed {{its claim to}} Mayotte before the United Nations General Assembly, which adopted a series of resolutions under the caption [...] "Question of the Comorian Island of Mayotte", opining that Mayotte belongs to the Comoros under the principle that the territorial integrity of colonial territories should be preserved upon independence. As a practical matter, however, these resolutions have little effect {{and there is no}} foreseeable likelihood that Mayotte will become de facto part of the Comoros without its people's consent. More recently, the Assembly has maintained this item on its agenda but deferred it from year to year without taking action. Other bodies, including the Organization of African Unity, the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, have similarly questioned French sovereignty over Mayotte. To close the debate and to avoid being integrated by force in the Union of the Comoros, the population of Mayotte overwhelmingly chose to become an overseas department and a region of France in a 2009 referendum. The new status was effective on 31 March 2011 and Mayotte has been recognised as an <b>outermost</b> <b>region</b> by European Union on 1 January 2014. This decision integrates Mayotte in the French Republic legally « one and indivisible ».|$|E
