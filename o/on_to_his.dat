5|$|A classic {{victory was}} within his grasp {{but he could}} almost feel his adversary's breath on his neck. Somehow Garin held <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> lead of two metres, two little metres for a legendary victory. The stands {{exploded}} and the ovation united the two men. Garin exulted under the cheers of the crowd. Cordang cried bitter tears of disappointment.|$|E
5|$|After the Battle of Gettysburg, Lincoln clearly {{understood}} that his military decisions {{would be more}} effectively carried out by conveying his orders through his War Secretary or his general-in-chief <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> generals, who resented his civilian interference with their own plans. Even so, he often continued to give detailed directions to his generals as Commander-in-Chief.|$|E

In 1195, {{after the death of}} Hugh du Puiset, Burchard was a candidate for the see of Durham, perhaps as part of a plan by his relative to pass the office <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> family. In June 1195 both Burchard and his rival, Philip of Poitou, were at the royal court in Le Mans, presumably both attempting to secure the bishopric. Philip was appointed to the see in November 1195.|$|E
