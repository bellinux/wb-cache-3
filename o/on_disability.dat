5|$|Channel 4's {{coverage}} of the Games was billed as the most extensive Paralympic coverage ever broadcast in the United Kingdom; it promised over 150 hours of live coverage throughout the Games on Channel 4 and sister channel More4, and additional coverage online and through special channels carried by Freesat, Sky and Virgin TV (in both standard and high definition). The broadcaster also invested around £600,000 towards training new on-air personalities with expertise in disability sports for the Games, {{many of whom were}} disabled themselves—they would also be joined by Channel 4 News anchor Jon Snow, and BBC Sport personality Clare Balding. Channel 4 also broadcast supplemental programming to lead towards the Games, such as Paralympic-focused documentaries, other IPC championships, and That Paralympic Show, a weekly program focusing <b>on</b> <b>disability</b> sports. During the Games, comedian Adam Hills (who himself was born without a right leg, and hosted the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's {{coverage of}} the Beijing Paralympics) would host The Last Leg, a Paralympic-themed late night talk show that followed the conclusion of each night's coverage. Channel 4's {{coverage of the}} Games drew relatively high viewership; its coverage of the opening ceremony was seen by an average of 7.6 million viewers, a 40% share, and peaked at 11.2 million viewers—making it one of Channel 4's most-watched programmes in network history. Primetime coverage saw an average of 3.3 million viewers nightly, while viewership peaked at 4.5 million viewers during the men's T44 200m final where Alan Oliveira beat Oscar Pistorius for the gold medal. Its coverage of the closing ceremony peaked at 7.7 million viewers.|$|E

25|$|In the end, {{the case}} {{did not go}} to trial. Fletcher, a recluse living <b>on</b> <b>disability</b> payments, opted to accept a plea bargain. One of her lawyers, Lawrence Walters, stated that his client, who has agoraphobia, a fear of public places, is not capable of sitting through what likely would be a week-long trial. Under the {{proposed}} plea agreement, Fletcher would avoid prison and be sentenced to a term of home detention. In the view of some legal scholars, Fletcher's guilty plea will not set any precedent related to text-only obscenity prosecutions because she is entering the plea voluntarily.|$|E
25|$|After the {{disappearance}} and later confirmed murder of Perrino, {{only a handful}} of Bonanno crime family members and associates involved in the News and Mail Deliverer's Union were incarcerated for racketeering at Riker's Island. Many of those convicted in the Robert Morgenthau probe went back to work at the New York Post, some elevated to management positions following their release. Albert Embarrato was recruited as a potential partner by former New York Post owner Steve Hoffenberg. Bonanno crime family mobster Armond DiCostanzo went <b>on</b> <b>disability</b> leave from the newspaper, but his allies retained influence when The Daily News moved its plant to Jersey City, where Douglas LaChance, a close friend of Perrino and Albert Embarrato was named circulation manager.|$|E
25|$|The Conservative Party won the 1981 {{elections}} {{and carried out}} a large deregulation reform: taxes were cut, local private radio stations were permitted, cable television was established by private companies, regulations on borrowing money were removed and foreigners were permitted to buy securities. An economic crisis hit in 1986 when foreigners started selling Norwegian krone, which ultimately forced an increase in taxes and Prime Minister Kåre Willoch was forced to resign. The Progress Party, located {{to the right of}} the Conservatives, had its break-through in the late 1980s. The high wages in the oil industry made low-skill manufacturing industries uncompetitive and the Labor Party closed a number of public industrial companies which were receiving large subsidies. The 1980s saw a trebling of people <b>on</b> <b>disability,</b> largely amongst the oldest in the workforce. Crime rates rose.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. In {{this paper}} we examine reading (dis) ability from an interac-tionist perspective, {{and discuss the}} {{implications}} of this view for research <b>on</b> reading <b>disability.</b> The paper is divided into three sections as follows. The first section provides a brief historical perspective of the events leading to current views of reading disability and research practices in this area. The second section presents a review of selected literature that provides an interactionist perspective on reading (dis) ability. The final section provides a discussion of {{the implications of this}} perspective for future research <b>on</b> reading <b>disability</b> and presents examples of "interactive" research. Our general thesis in this paper is that research <b>on</b> reading <b>disability</b> must move away from the search for causative factors within the reader and toward the specification of the conditions under which different readers can and will learn. After many years of research <b>on</b> reading <b>disability,</b> the results are still inconclu-sive. This is true, of course, not only about research <b>on</b> reading <b>disability,</b> but abou...|$|R
25|$|Young v. Facebook, Inc., 790 F. Supp. 2d 1110, is a pro se {{internet}} law case {{in which}} the plaintiff sued the social network Facebook following the termination of her user account. In her original complaint, the plaintiff, Karen Beth Young, alleged violation of her First and Fourteenth Amendment rights, breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, negligence, and fraud. In the U.S. District Court of Northern California, Facebook moved to dismiss the claim, and on October 25, 2010, presiding Judge Jeremy Fogel granted the motion to dismiss with leave to amend. Redirecting her complaint, Young alleged violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act and related state laws <b>on</b> <b>disability,</b> as well as breach of contract and negligence. Again, Facebook moved to dismiss, and Judge Fogel dismissed the case without leave to amend.|$|E
25|$|Colonel Reynolds {{was accused}} of {{dereliction}} of duty for failing to properly support the first charge with his entire command; for burning the captured supplies, food, blankets, buffalo robes, and ammunition instead of keeping them for army use; and most of all, for losing hundreds of the captured horses. In January, 1877, his court-martial at Cheyenne, Wyoming Territory found Reynolds guilty of all three charges. He was sentenced to suspension from rank and command for one year. His friend and West Point classmate, President Ulysses S. Grant remitted the sentence, but Joseph J. Reynolds never served again. He retired <b>on</b> <b>disability</b> leave on June 25, 1877, exactly {{one year after the}} culminating battle of the Great Sioux War at the Little Bighorn. Crook's and Reynolds's failed expedition and their inability to seriously damage the Lakota and Cheyenne at Powder River probably encouraged Indian resistance {{to the demands of the}} United States.|$|E
25|$|George {{appeared}} before the Old Bailey on 14 December 2007 and again {{pleaded not guilty to}} the murder. His retrial began on 9 June 2008. Initially there was a large amount of coverage in the press, especially of the prosecution portrayal of the defendant as being highly obsessive, lacking in social skills and a danger to women. The prosecution case differed from that of the first trial in that there was practically no scientific evidence as the evidence relating to the FDR was ruled inadmissible by the trial judge (Mr Justice Griffith Williams). There was much evidence of George's bad character which was admitted in the re-trial (at the discretion of the trial judge) {{as a result of the}} enactment of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 since the original trial. There were delays due to legal arguments and to the illnesses of the defendant and one of the jurors. For the defence William Clegg QC reminded the jury that evidence from three women from HAFAD (Hammersmith and Fulham Action <b>on</b> <b>Disability)</b> placed the defendant's arrival at their offices at 11:50 or 12:00, which, according to Clegg's argument, would have made it impossible for him to have committed a murder at Dando's house at 11:30 and then gone home (in the wrong direction) to change. Two neighbours who almost certainly saw the murderer immediately after the shooting had seen him go off in this direction, and later failed to identify George at an identification parade. The trial ended with George's acquittal on 1 August 2008.|$|E

500|$|... Geneticists studied human {{heredity}} as Mendelian inheritance, while eugenics movements {{sought to}} manage society, {{with a focus}} on social class in the United Kingdom, and <b>on</b> <b>disability</b> and ethnicity in the United States, leading to geneticists seeing this as impractical pseudoscience.

500|$|Some deceptions {{may take}} many months to unravel, {{such as a}} case that lasted over a year {{involving}} a 15-year-old boy participating in an online support group for people enduring debilitating migraine headaches. Some of the group's members had been <b>on</b> <b>disability</b> pension or gone through drug regimens for years to no avail. The boy represented his mother as deaf and his father as an alcoholic, and he reported seizures and hemophilia as complicating conditions. [...] However, he also {{claimed to be a}} medical student who performed as a drummer in a band. Resources of the forum became constantly directed at the boy, especially when some members expressed doubt about his story. The boy's mother—previously noted by him to be neglectful—logged on to post that questions about his conditions would worsen them; when they did not cease, he left the group, saying the atmosphere violated [...] "the spirit of the internet".|$|E
500|$|On 2 May 2012, the International Paralympic Committee officially sanctioned [...] "para-snowboarding" [...] (commonly {{known as}} {{adaptive}} snowboarding) as a medal {{event in the}} 2014 Winter Paralympic Games under Alpine Skiing. [...] There will be men's and women's standing snowboard-cross competitions. [...] The IPC currently recognizes two broader sport classes, one for competitors with lower-limb impairments and one for those with upper-limb impairments. Visually impaired classes are not currently recognized and the sport's debut in the 2014 Sochi Paralympics will feature events for only athletes with lower-limb impairments, who will be permitted to wear a prosthesis. [...] The events will be run in a time trial format (one rider on course at a time), and results within each broad class calculated without factors that adjust raw times based <b>on</b> <b>disability</b> classification (for example, a hypothetical athlete with a single above-knee amputation will not receive any adjustment {{to his or her}} start-to-finish time, even though the lack of a knee and functional quadriceps in one leg can result in an impairment much greater than a hypothetical athlete with a single below-knee amputation but two functional quadriceps). However, as the sport develops, the classes will be expanded and/or refined in the future.|$|E
