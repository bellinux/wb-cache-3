30|$|In this paper, we {{compared}} {{the performance of a}} cellular OFDMA-TDD system enhanced with a MultiHop relay or <b>optical</b> <b>repeater.</b> In particular, we investigated bandwidth efficiency gained by a frequency reuse feature of a MultiHop relay along with outage performance subject to the co-channel interference under different resource allocation scenarios. In general, system throughput of the conventional IEEE 802.16 e mobile wireless broadband system can be significantly enhanced by either a MultiHop relay or repeaters. Furthermore, outage performance can be improved by repeaters or MultiHop relays with orthogonal allocation, since they improve C/I either by combining gain or by reducing the co-channel interference in the same cell, respectively. MultiHop relays will increase system capacity (almost doubling system throughput with the overlapped allocation), especially improving a per-user data rate in the cell edges or heavily shadowed areas. As these relays eliminate the need for a wire line relay, they facilitate rapid deployment and warrant economic feasibility. However, in the MultiHop relay system of overlapped allocation, there must be some means of circumventing the additional outage events around the subcell edges of the relay stations incurred by fully reusing the frequency in every relay station. One particular approach is a cooperative relay scheme that allows transmitting duplicate signals via multiple relay stations and then, combining them constructively in the receiver [15].|$|E
40|$|The optical {{properties}} of GaAs {{make it a}} very useful material for the fabrication of optical emitters and detectors. GaAs also possesses electronic properties which permit the fabrication of high speed electronic devices which are superior to conventional silicon devices. This thesis describes three examples of the monolithic integration of optical and electronic devices on semi-insulating GaAs substrates. In the first example, an injection laser was integrated with a Gunn oscillator to yield a high frequency modulated optical source. In the second example, an injection laser was integrated with a metal semiconductor field effect transistor (MESFET). The transistor was used to modulate the current through the laser. In the third example, an integrated <b>optical</b> <b>repeater</b> was demonstrated which consisted of a MESFET optical detector, a current source, a transistor driver, and an injection laser all fabricated on a single chip. The repeater displayed an optical gain of 10 dB.

The Integrated Optoelectronic Repeater: The design, fabrication, {{and testing of}} the first monolithic integrated <b>optical</b> <b>repeater</b> is described. This device consists of an optical detector, electronic gain stage, and current modulated semiconductor laser transmitter integrated in a single crystal chip to perform the function of regenerating an optical signal as might be found in an optical communication system. The device has a measured optical gain (light out to light in) of 10 dB. 2. Ion Implanted Lasers and Schottky Gate Field Effect Transistors: The use of ion implantation as a technique to fabricate both lasers and field effect transistors is described. Devices fabricated include a beryllium implanted laser diode on N type GaAs substrate, a beryllium implanted laser diode on semi-insulating Cr doped GaAs substrate integrated with a field effect transistor driver, and sulfur implanted GaAs field effect transistors. 3. A Steady State Lateral Model of the Double Heterostructure Laser: A theoretical model of the double heterostructure laser is described which treats the p-n junction in the device correctly by using fundamental semiconductor relationships and reasonable assumptions about the device heterointerfaces. The model treats both the electronic and optical properties self consistently, making the model valid above lasing threshold. Finite element formalism is adopted as a solution technique to enable the treatment of complicated diode geometries. An example is treated and theoretical and experimental results are compared. 4. The Effect of Lateral Carrier Diffusion on the Modulation Response of a Semiconductor Laser: The effect of lateral carrier diffusion upon the modulation characteristics of the semiconductor laser is investigated. A self consistent analysis of the spatially dependent rate equations is performed using a finite element model. The transverse junction stripe laser is treated as an example and a comparison is made between lateral carrier diffusion and spontaneous emission as damping mechanisms for the resonance peak. Experimental results bear out {{the conclusion that the}} relaxation resonance in this device is damped mainly by lateral carrier diffusion. In addition, a simple analytic result is presented which illustrates qualitatively the effect of lateral carrier diffusion upon such devices. The conclusion from this result is that lateral carrier diffusion serves to damp the relaxation resonance in the semiconductor laser quite well, but probably will not serve to improve the upper limit on modulation frequency as might have been suspected. 5. Effective Permittivity Formalism and the Design of Buried Heterostructure Lasers: An approach to effective permittivity formalism is presented which clarifies and extends the use of this technique particularly in the treatment of waveguiding in the semiconductor laser. The scalar wave equation is posed in a variational form, and the effective permittivity formalism is treated as a variational approximation technique. This approach shows clearly the nature and limits of the approximation involved. The formalism is applied to the case of the buried heterostructure laser and the results differ considerably from the conventional application of effective permittivity formalism to this device when a reasonable form is assumed for the variational modal profile...|$|E

In an analog telephone line consisting {{of a pair of}} wires, it consists of an amplifier circuit made of transistors which use power from a DC current source {{to increase}} the power of the alternating current audio signal on the line. Since the telephone is a duplex (bidirectional) communication system, the wire pair carries two audio signals, one going in each direction. So telephone repeaters have to be bilateral, amplifying the signal in both directions without causing feedback, which complicates their design considerably. Telephone repeaters were the first type of repeater and were some of the first applications of amplification. The development of telephone repeaters between 1900 and 1915 made long distance phone service possible.

40|$|A {{multihop}} relay (MR) and repeater {{are useful}} means for improving system throughput and coverage in a cellular mobile packet access system, as the carrier-to-interference ratio {{can be improved}} when deploying them in a heavily shadowed region. In this paper, we report on our investigation of bandwidth efficiency and the associated service outage performance for different relay scenarios, using system level simulation for a cellular Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access-Time Division Duplexing (OFDMA-TDD) system. We have demonstrated that network throughput gain by typical <b>optical</b> <b>repeaters,</b> which have a simple amplify-and-forwarding capability in a full-duplexing mode, could be minimal in open space subject to cochannel interference from all repeaters in the neighboring cells. This is true, {{even though they are}} generally useful for warranting the outage performance with a multiple order of combining gain, especially in the destructive area, for example, basements or indoors with heavy wall attenuation, that naturally shields interference. Meanwhile, we show that multihop relays increase the average system capacity (almost doubling the system throughput) by fully reusing the frequency in every relay station, while improving the per-user data rate in the cell edges or improving the outage performance in the heavily shadowed areas. </p...|$|R
50|$|Modern <b>optical</b> fiber <b>repeaters</b> use a {{solid-state}} optical amplifier, {{usually an}} Erbium-doped fiber amplifier. Each repeater contains separate equipment for each fiber. These comprise signal reforming, error measurement and controls. A solid-state laser dispatches the signal {{into the next}} length of fiber. The solid-state laser excites a short length of doped fiber that itself acts as a laser amplifier. As the light passes through the fiber, it is amplified. This system also permits wavelength-division multiplexing, which dramatically increases {{the capacity of the}} fiber.|$|R
30|$|The {{benefits}} of introducing the MR into the field, compared to conventional <b>optical</b> <b>repeaters</b> in a cellular system, include easy network deployment {{and a significant}} reduction in infrastructure cost by replacing the wireline relay link with wireless hops using the same frequency assignment (FA) as the access link. Furthermore, throughput and capacity enhancement can be achieved through the frequency-reuse capabilities of relay stations (RSs). As opposed to the selective decode-and-forward capability of the MR, the typical optical relays may suffer from a serious problem of co-channel interference between them in the neighboring cells as a consequence of their performing a simple (yet blind) amplify-and-forwarding function. When a universal frequency reuse is employed, this particular problem becomes more serious for OFDMA. OFDMA is less robust to co-channel interference compared to (code division multiple access) CDMA. However, a portion of the radio resource must be dedicated to the relay link in a MR system; this naturally reduces the capacity of its access link. This particular aspect becomes critical as the number of relay stations connected to the base station (MR-BS) increases. That is, there exists an obvious trade-off between the frequency reuse gain and capacity loss associated with the additional links between the MR-BSs and RSs.|$|R
