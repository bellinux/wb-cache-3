500|$|Final mixing for {{the song}} took place on 21 June as the Beatles rushed to {{complete}} Revolver before beginning {{the first leg of}} their 1966 world tour. Harrison discussed [...] "Love You To" [...] with Shankar when the two musicians met that month, at a social event hosted by the Angadi family. Although he was unaware of the band's popularity and had yet to hear [...] "Norwegian Wood", Shankar was impressed with Harrison's humility as the guitarist downplayed his sitar recordings with the Beatles as merely [...] "experiments". Soon after this meeting, Shankar gave Harrison his first sitar lesson at Kinfauns, his and Boyd's home in Surrey, and later, with tablist Alla Rakha, performed a private recital there for Harrison, Lennon and Starr. Harrison subsequently recalled of his first lesson with Shankar: [...] "I felt I wanted to walk out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>home</b> that day and take a one-way ticket to Calcutta. I would even have left Pattie behind in that moment." ...|$|E

They blew up power stations and put a bomb at my home when my husband was dying of cancer. And the bomb was set to detonate at two o'clock in the morning, but it was a construction explosive that doesn't detonate when it drops below freezing. [...] It doesn't usually freeze in San Francisco, but on this night, it dropped below freezing, and the bomb didn't detonate. I was very lucky. But, I thought of what might have happened. Later the same group shot out all the windows <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>home.</b>|$|E

Selver-Urbach writes, in part,...life in Mittelsteine was sheer hell, even if a lesser hell than elsewhere, and our portion of torments and suffering was undoubtedly an indivisible part of that total, comprehensive system I have labelled [...] "A Different Planet"...Another former inmate, Ruth Minsky Sender, who in her 1986 book The Cage vividly conveys the pervasive atmosphere of terror established at Mittelsteine by the random use of torture, speaks in the interviews of the suicides among the despairing inmates.|$|E
2500|$|The July 2011 tournament was Kaiō's 65th as an ōzeki, tying Chiyotaikai's record. On {{the fourth}} day he slapped down Toyonoshima to earn his first victory of the basho and his 1045th in his career. Congratulated by Chiyonofuji {{backstage}} after the bout, Kaiō replied, [...] "I feel sorry to be compared to someone as great as you." [...] The following day he forced out Kyokutenhō to surpass Chiyonofuji and stand alone in first place. On Day 10, having lost to Kotoōshū to fall to 3–7, Kaiō announced his retirement from sumo, {{just a few days}} short of his 39th birthday, after a discussion with his stablemaster. He remained in sumo as a coach at Tomozuna stable, using the toshiyori or elder name of Asakayama. His retirement left no Japanese at ōzeki or yokozuna {{for the first time since}} January 1993. Speaking at a press conference after his announcement, Kaiō said, [...] "I might not have reached yokozuna or won the championship in front <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>home</b> fans in Kyushu but I've had a fulfilling career and have no regrets." [...] His danpatsu-shiki, or official retirement ceremony, took place at the Ryōgoku Kokugikan on 27 May 2012, with around 10000 spectators and hundreds of dignitaries, including his fellow March 1988 entrant Takanohana, taking turns to snip his topknot before it was finally removed by his stablemaster Tomozuna.|$|E
