Also it requires no less than 70% of the votes among the IMF members. Initially its value was fixed, so that 1 XDR = 1 U.S. dollar (as equivalent to 0.888671 grams of fine gold), but this was abandoned in favor of a currency basket after the 1973 collapse of the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates.|$|E

As a result, the IMF expanded its available resources. Alongside many other countries, Australia has increased the amount it is willing to lend to the IMF to help the IMF fund its current and future commitments, although so far the IMF has only drawn on {{a small portion of the}} funding Australia has agreed to provide.

50|$|The {{earliest}} {{establishment of}} a gold standard was in the United Kingdom in 1821 followed by Australia in 1852 and Canada in 1853. Under this system, the external value of all currencies was denominated in terms of gold with central banks ready {{to buy and sell}} unlimited quantities of gold at the fixed price. Each central bank maintained gold <b>reserves</b> as their <b>official</b> <b>reserve</b> <b>asset.</b> For example, during the “classical” gold standard period (1879-1914), the U.S. dollar was defined as 0.048 troy oz. of pure gold.|$|R
50|$|<b>Official</b> {{international}} <b>reserves,</b> {{the means}} of official international payments, formerly consisted only of gold, and occasionally silver. But under the Bretton Woods system, the US dollar functioned as a reserve currency, so it too became part of a nation's <b>official</b> international <b>reserve</b> <b>assets.</b> From 1944-1968, the US dollar was convertible into gold through the Federal Reserve System, but after 1968 only central banks could convert dollars into gold from <b>official</b> gold <b>reserves,</b> and after 1973 no individual or institution could convert US dollars into gold from <b>official</b> gold <b>reserves.</b> Since 1973, no major currencies have been convertible into gold from <b>official</b> gold <b>reserves.</b> Individuals and institutions must now buy gold in private markets, just like other commodities. Even though US dollars and other currencies are no longer convertible into gold from <b>official</b> gold <b>reserves,</b> they still can function as <b>official</b> international <b>reserves.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Following the Second World War, the Bretton Woods system (1944-1973) {{replaced}} {{gold with}} the U.S. dollar as the <b>official</b> <b>reserve</b> <b>asset.</b> The regime intended to combine binding legal obligations with multilateral decision-making through the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The rules {{of this system}} were {{set forth in the}} articles of agreement of the IMF and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The system was a monetary order intended to govern currency relations among sovereign states, with the 44 member countries required to establish a parity of their national currencies in terms of the U.S. dollar and to maintain exchange rates within 1% of parity (a [...] "band") by intervening in their foreign exchange markets (that is, buying or selling foreign money). The U.S. dollar was the only currency strong enough to meet the rising demands for international currency transactions, and so the United States agreed both to link the dollar to gold at the rate of $35 per ounce of gold and to convert dollars into gold at that price.|$|R

40|$|This quick guide {{looks at}} the level of Australia’s foreign debt, the {{interest}} liability on foreign debt and how these have changed over time. It also looks at foreign debt as a component of net foreign investment, the other component being equity investment. Finally, given that Australia’s gross foreign debt is now bigger than its annual gross domestic product (GDP), the quick guide also considers whether our foreign debt level is too high. What is foreign debt? Foreign debt is the amount borrowed from non-residents by residents of Australia. It includes securities such as bonds, as well as loans, advances, deposits, debentures and overdrafts. Foreign debt is a subset of the financial obligations that make up Australia’s foreign investment position.   It is distinguished from other forms of foreign investment capital inflow such as equity investment (foreign ownership) by the obligation to pay interest and/or repay capital. Foreign debt is {{not to be confused with}} national debt, which is the total government debt. National debt comprises government borrowings from overseas residents and government borrowings from Australian residents and thus excludes overseas borrowings by the private sector. A distinction is made between gross and net foreign debt. Gross foreign debt is the total amount of borrowing from non-residents. Net foreign debt is equal to gross foreign debt minus the sum of lending by residents of Australia to non-residents and <b>official</b> <b>reserve</b> <b>assets</b> held by the Reserve Bank...|$|E
40|$|Most {{explanations}} of the current economic and financial crisis focus on its financial causes. Often missing in these explanations is a discussion of how {{the seeds of the}} crisis were sown by economic policies in major countries that fostered the growth of global imbalances during the 2000 s. Moreover, just as these imbalances created the current crisis, exactly how they are likely to unwind—or fail to be resolved—over the period immediately ahead will {{play a major role in}} determining the prospects for world economic recovery and the pace of future growth. Largely reflecting economic policies, substantial imbalances in savings and investment emerged among major world economies after 2000, and these imbalances were reflected in growing current account imbalances. Rising U. S. deficits and increasing surpluses in emerging East Asian economies (especially China) and oil-exporting countries in the Middle East developed. The underlying savings and investment imbalances gave rise to a “savings glut” in developing countries and spawned sizable net capital flows to the advanced countries, with the United States being the primary recipient. This glut of savings contributed to a substantial reduction in world interest rates. At the same time, a significant rise in demand for <b>official</b> <b>reserve</b> <b>assets</b> (largely in the form of U. S. Treasury and Agency securities), especially by East Asian and Middle Eastern economies, crowded out private demand for such high-quality, low-risk assets. Consequently, a scramble by private investors to try to find other higher yielding but low risk assets contributed to the financial excesses that finally culminated in the turmoil that gripped world financial markets in late 2008 and early 2009.

40|$|The world {{distribution}} of current account balances {{has been steadily}} drifting away from “normality” since 1997. This puzzling development has occurred in parallel with large scale accumulation of <b>official</b> foreign <b>reserve</b> <b>assets</b> in emerging Asia and commodity exporting countries, and a growing role of portfolio flows in financing the US external deficit. The theoretical toolbox {{that was used to}} understand “old puzzles” of international macroeconomics may still be relevant to address these new puzzles, {{to the extent that it}} focuses more specifically on liquidity aspects: uneven supply of liquid assets, borrowing constraints, and externalities related to financial infrastructures that foster market liquidity. The paper discusses how these various features have been introduced in the most recent literature on global imbalances. One aspect that may require further examination is the role of fi nancial market liquidity as a “public good externality”: in the absence of appropriate provision of such a public good in emerging economies, reserve accumulation may be seen as an attempt to import the “public services” benefi ts of holding liquid “risk-free” assets. This may in turn possibly result in a form of “congestion” if US dollar reserve accumulation outpaces the issuance of US Treasuries or equivalent securities. Large reserve holders have thus turned to a wider range of asset classes, including asset-backed securities whose liquidity has all but vanished in the course of recent fi nancial market turbulences. These developments could therefore affect the fi nancing conditions of the US current account deficit, and undermine some of its structural determinants. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} whether pre-crisis international reserve accumulations, {{as well as}} exchange rate and reserve policy decisions made during the global financial crisis, can help to explain cross-country differences in post-crisis economic performance. Our approach focuses {{not only on the}} total stock of <b>official</b> <b>reserves</b> held by countries, but also on the decisions by governments to purchase or sell <b>reserve</b> <b>assets</b> during the crisis period. We introduce new data made available through the IMF Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) Reserve Template, which allow us to distinguish interest income and valuation changes in the stock of <b>official</b> <b>reserves</b> from the actively managed component of reserves. We use this novel data to gauge how (and whether) reserve accumulation policies influenced the economic and financial performance of countries during and after the global crisis.
