We show that a small-scale helicity injection correlates the input on the 2 D component with the one on the <b>out-of-plane</b> <b>component.</b> As a result, the third component develops a non-trivial energy transfer. The latter is mediated by homochiral triads, confirming the strong 3 D nature of the leading dynamical interactions.

40|$|A simple {{classical}} {{model of}} magnetic-field induced electron flow {{is used to}} evaluate the ring current strength for a few inorganic monocyclic compounds. It is shown that, for these neutral and charged systems, sustaining delocalized electron currents {{in the presence of a}} magnetic field Bext orthogonal to the sh plane, the <b>out-of-plane</b> <b>component</b> of the nuclear magnetic shielding along the central axis is connected to the out-of-plane magnetizability by a simple equation, involving the radius of an average loop of current. A novel estimate of this effective radius is provided. Reliable ring current susceptibilities (that is, current strengths) can be evaluated by a simple relationship, using the out-of-plane components of nuclear shielding and magnetizability tensors. The accuracy of the current susceptibilities calculated by the classical model is established by comparison with corresponding ab initio estimates obtained by integrating the quantum mechanical current-density vector field. The out-of-plane components of nuclear shielding and magnetizability are both strongly biased by the molecular geometry. Their combined use to estimate the ring current susceptibility offers a quantifier of magnetotropicity more reliable than (i) the <b>out-of-plane</b> <b>component</b> of magnetizability, (ii) the <b>out-of-plane</b> <b>component</b> of the magnetic shielding at the center of mass.

40|$|Large {{velocity}} components {{perpendicular to}} the light sheet plane leads to a significant reduction of valid data points and errors due to perspective projection of the imaging lens in PIV experiments. Therefore, the observation of flows with a strong <b>out-of-plane</b> flow <b>component</b> requires the measurements of this component {{in order to reduce}} the error of both measured in-plane components. It is know that when utilizing statistical evaluation methods in PIV, such as cross- or autocorrelation methods, the height of the peak in the correlation plane decreases with increasing <b>out-of-plane</b> velocity <b>components.</b> Thus, one aproach obtaining information about the <b>out-of-plane</b> velocity <b>component</b> from PIV recordings is to analyze the height of the peak in the correlation plane. This value depends on the portion of paired particle images, which itself depends on the <b>out-of-plane</b> velocity <b>component</b> and on other parameters. To circumvent problems with other influences (e. g. background light, varying image sizes and numbers), images from another light sheet plane parallel to the firstare also captured for peak height normalization.
