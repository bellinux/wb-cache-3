Therefore, this study aim to investigate the potential use of sugarcane bagassse, treated with sodium hydroxide, to reduce selected heavy metals (Cu, Cr, Cd, Pb and Ni) in aqueous solution. Chemically activated sugarcane bagasse was used to reduce heavy metals at a constant temperature of 30 °C and agitation rate of 150 rpm. In this study, the variation of adsorbent weight and contact time were used as parameters to determine the effective time and the amount of adsorbent that should be used in the reduction of heavy metal while keeping the initial heavy metal concentration constant. It was found that, the effective adsorbent weight for the reduction of heavy metals was 1. 0 g with contact time of 80 minutes except for Ni which occurred at 50 minutes contact time.

A procedure for thermal evaluation using mass and energy balance for a jaggery furnace is proposed to establish furnace performance and loss stream analysis.

The loss stream analysis indicates that the theoretical energy required for jaggery processing is only 29 % of total energy supplied by bagasse combustion.

5000|$|... "The {{sugarcane}} {{enters the}} sugar mill and is processed {{along one of}} two product chains: the sugar chain (containing the originally conceived sugar reﬁnery and the alcohol plant) or the paper chain (containing the pulp and paper mills). Each downstream (internal) company uses the by-products from upstream companies as secondary material inputs. In addition, careful attention is given to reducing the residual waste and to its ultimate disposal. The sugar chain results in the ultimate production of sugar, alcohol, cement, and compound fertilizer (i.e., fertilizer with a speciﬁc ratio of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium). In the sugar reﬁnery, the sugarcane “juice” that is released in the crushing and grinding assembly in the sugar mill is reﬁned in a carbonation process that yields a higher quality reﬁned sugar than does the sulﬁtation process {{that is used by}} the majority of cane sugar plants in China (Wei 2004). Wei notes that sulﬁtation is favored by the GG’s competitors, in part, because the ﬁlter mud (one of the wastes from the reﬁning process) from sulﬁtation can easily be disposed of as a direct application fertilizer. Filter mud from the carbonation process, on the other hand, can have a signiﬁcant negative effect on the local soil if it is applied directly to the land. The GG has addressed this problem by using the carbonation ﬁlter mud as an input to the State-owned cement production facility it manages, rather than as a fertilizer. The GG contributes the ﬁlter mud and pays for transportation costs, balancing the savings from not having to pay for disposal. The fuel for the cement plant is coal, introducing an added environmental burden on the symbiosis. The residues from the alcohol plant (molasses)—which once would have been released into the environment—are now used as input to the production <b>of</b> compound fertilizer, <b>which</b> goes back to the sugarcane ﬁelds, thus closing this loop. The paper chain is driven by the input <b>of</b> <b>bagasse,</b> <b>which</b> is the residue from the sugar mill, minus the pith; that is, the soft interior portion of the cane. Sixty percent of the bagasse has ﬁbers long enough for paper-making. The short ﬁbers of the pith are used as fuel in a cogeneration power plant. Earlier, the GG burnt the bagasse in its power plant and sold it to homeowners for cooking and heating. The pulping operation that prepares the bagasse for conversion into paper requires a signiﬁcant addition <b>of</b> alkali, <b>which</b> ends up in the residue of that operation. The GG has constructed an alkali recovery plant that recycles the waste from the pulping operation (black liquor), generating a white sludge that can be used as input to the cement mill, which is primarily a part of the sugar chain. The pulp is processed by one of the three paper mills, where a major waste (white liquor) is generated and subsequently treated to recover major portions of ﬁber and water, which are recycled to the paper mills.” ...|$|R

This project focus on using this method to convert residual biomass to a useful product for its sustainability. Three materials <b>which</b> are <b>bagasse,</b> eucalyptus and jatropha residues were studied. The solvent used was water and formic acid as the hydrogen donor. There was variation of temperature from 320 to 380 oC with heating time of 2 - 4 hrs. GC-MS (gas chromatography and mass spectrometer) was used to analyze the samples. Analysis of these samples shows an approximate 58 %wt of bio oil could be produced from eucalyptus and 45 %wt and 35 %wt from bagasse and jatropha residue respectively. Some of the chemical compounds generated which are furan, guaiacol, catechol and hydroquinone are useful chemicals in pharmaceutical and petrochemical industries...|$|R
40|$|Lignocellulosic {{residues}} {{obtained from}} crops cultivation form useful sources {{to be used}} as substrate for bioconversion processes. Sugarcane <b>bagasse,</b> <b>which</b> is a complex substrate obtained from the processing of sugar cane, is an important biomass among such sources. Due to its abundant availability, it can serve as an ideal substrate for microbial processes for the production of value added products. This paper reviews recent developments on biological processes developed on production of various products in solid state fermentation using sugarcane bagasse as the substrate and describes production of protein enriched feed, enzymes, amino acid, organic acids and compounds of pharmaceutical importance, etc. through microbial means...|$|R

Production of this enzyme was used agrowastes, as substrates (medium) <b>which</b> are sugarcane <b>bagasse,</b> banana peel, coconut dregs and rice bran. This substrates were prepared with 70 % of moisture content. Process variables such as incubation time, temperature and inoculum size were optimized to achieve the maximum production of pectinases. The increase level of pectinase production obtained was sugarcane bagasse as potential substrate cultured with 1 ml spore suspension and incubate for 96 hours in 30 °C by SSF of A. niger have produce pectinase 20. 3 U/g...|$|R
30|$|We {{compared}} the chemical composition of EFB {{with those of}} other two lignocellulosic materials: sugarcane bagasse as an agricultural residue biomass [25] and Acacia mearnsii wood as a plantation hardwood for a resource of paper production [13]. The comparison suggested that EFB is a high-potential resource, revealing a high content of total carbohydrate (glucan and xylan) of 55.8  %, similar to those of sugarcane bagasse (62.0  %) and A. mearnsii (58.6  %) for paper and paperboard. The key advantage of EFB as a potential resource for DP production in Indonesia is provided by its considerably more abundant stock than <b>bagasse,</b> <b>which</b> has been estimated to reach only around 2.9 million tons annually [25].|$|R
40|$|The feeding {{represents}} most of {{the total}} cost of production and to reduce costs and increase the profit of the producer have been researched alternative food, as the pie of babassu palm, the pie of palm and the cassava <b>bagasse,</b> <b>which</b> show potential for usein feeding the chickens for slow growth, however, with limited use, due to the different grades of fiber. Non-starch polysaccharides make it difficult for digestible enzymes to reach the food, reducing the digestibility of nutrients. To minimize this effect, exogenous enzymes have been supplemented in DOI: [URL] Desafios –v. 04,n. 02, 201736 poultry diets. Various sources can originate these additives, most <b>of</b> <b>which</b> are acquired through fermentation processes. The temperature, pH, substrate concentration and composition of the ingredients are factors that influence the enzymatic action and consequently the availability of the nutrients. Studies show that the use of fungal enzymes can increase the nutritional value of the food and improves the digestibility of nutrients, reflecting the productive efficiency, representing savings in production costs and benefits to the environment, however, it is necessary to evaluate the use in diets with alternative foods of Regional expression...|$|R
