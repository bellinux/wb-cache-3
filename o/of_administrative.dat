5|$|Illegality {{is one of}} {{the three}} broad {{headings}} of judicial review <b>of</b> <b>administrative</b> action in Singapore, the others being irrationality and procedural impropriety.

5|$|Included {{were nine}} Australians—three {{officers}} and six sergeants—who {{had been selected}} by AIF Headquarters in April 1918. All were experienced soldiers, with three having served at Gallipoli {{as well as in}} France. Sailing on the SS City of Marseilles on 17 June 1918 the Australians arrived in Murmansk and most were immediately sent out on patrol. Later they were switched to the Archangel section. The men were then broken into small advisory groups and attached to White Russian and White Finnish units, being engaged in a range <b>of</b> <b>administrative,</b> instructional and advisory tasks. Due to their isolation, it is difficult to make generalisations about the nature of service experienced by the Australians at this time. Captain P.F. Lohan served in a variety <b>of</b> <b>administrative</b> positions both in Murmansk and Archangel, whilst Sergeant R.L. Graham was commissioned in the field and became railway transport officer on the Archangel-Vologda railway. Several other sergeants were involved in the various training roles, while Captain Allan Brown was attached to the North Russian Rifles based at Onega—a White Russian battalion.|$|E

5|$|The aim <b>of</b> <b>administrative</b> law is to {{regulate}} the executive government by providing remedies which individuals can apply for when challenging administrative actions and decisions, and failures to take action and make decisions.

5|$|A {{mandatory}} order is {{an order of}} the High Court commanding a public authority to perform a public duty, while a prohibiting order operates to prevent illegal action by an authority from occurring in the first place. A quashing order, the most commonly sought prerogative order, {{has the effect of}} invalidating an ultra vires decision made by an authority. Obtaining a mandatory, prohibiting or quashing order is a two-stage process, as an applicant must be granted leave by the Court to apply for the order. The Court must find the existence of a proper public law issue and available grounds of review. Leave will be granted provided that an arguable and prima facie case of reasonable suspicion that the authority has acted in breach <b>of</b> <b>administrative</b> law rules is established.|$|E

On August 10, 1945, he was assigned to the 556th Air Base Unit at Long Beach, California. On August 24, 1946, he was offered a commission as a first lieutenant in the active duty Army Air Corps, demoting him from his temporary rank but effectively allowing him to stay in the military in spite of the demobilization and downsizing of the US military. Several weeks later on September 7, Davis was ordered to the 554th Air Base Unit in Memphis, Tennessee, where he served on one of the Army Air Corps aerobatic demonstration teams, the predecessors to the United States Air Force Thunderbirds.|$|E
5|$|After the war, he {{commanded}} the 92nd Gordon Highlanders at Jamaica—where he scandalised his regiment by ordering them to adopt trousers {{instead of the}} kilt—and the 90th Light Infantry in the Ionian Islands, before retiring from active duty in 1829. He then held a number <b>of</b> <b>administrative</b> roles in Ireland, including the state secretary to the Lord-Lieutenant and the commissioner of police in Ulster, and after the accession of Queen Victoria in 1837 became a palace courtier. His final military role was the (ceremonial) colonelcy of the 83rd (County of Dublin) Regiment, which he held from 1848 until his death.|$|E
5|$|Besides their {{obligations}} as obedient, peaceful and nonpolitical {{inhabitants of the}} Grand Duchy, who had a few decades earlier accepted the class system as {{the natural order of}} their life, the commoners began to ask for and demand their civil rights and citizenship in Finnish society.

5|$|Coughlan {{has been}} criticized for {{allowing}} the doctrine of proportionality to affect administrative law, as the court has to judge the merits of a case when granting a review on grounds of substantive legitimate expectation and, in a sense, usurp the discretion of the executive branch of government. This is arguably inconsistent with the court's traditional role in judicial review which is to avoid examining the merits <b>of</b> <b>administrative</b> decisions and only scrutinize them for compliance with the law.|$|E
5|$|During {{the reign}} of Sultan Abu Bakar, there was {{development}} and modernisation within the city; with the construction <b>of</b> <b>administrative</b> buildings, schools, religious buildings, and railways connecting to Singapore. Johor Bahru was occupied by the Japanese forces from 1942 to 1945. Johor Bahru became the cradle of Malay nationalism {{after the war and}} gave birth to a political party named United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) in 1946. After the formation of Malaysia in 1963, Johor Bahru retained its status as state capital and was granted city status in 1994. A central business district was developed in the city centre during the 1990s. More development funds were channelled to the city after the introduction of Iskandar Malaysia in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Errors of law {{committed}} by public authorities when they act or make decisions {{are within the}} jurisdiction of the High Court of Singapore to correct by way of judicial review. On the other hand, the Court is generally unwilling to intervene where the alleged error is one that concerns the facts of the matter. The rationale for this rule is that it is the Court's role in judicial review <b>of</b> <b>administrative</b> action to scrutinize the legality and not the merits of the decisions of public authorities.|$|E
