5|$|Romney {{opposed the}} use of {{mandatory}} limits on greenhouse gas emissions to deal with global warming. He stated that he believed climate change is occurring, but {{that he did not}} know how much of it could be linked to human activity.

He believed North American energy independence could be achieved by 2020.|$|E
5|$|Sheep {{producers}} {{have used a}} wide variety of measures to combat predation. Pre-modern shepherds used their own presence, livestock guardian dogs, and protective structures such as barns and fencing. Fencing (both regular and electric), penning sheep at night and lambing indoors all continue to be widely used. More modern shepherds used guns, traps, and poisons to kill predators, causing significant decreases in predator populations. In the wake <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> and conservation movements, the use of these methods now usually falls under the purview of specially designated government agencies in most developed countries.|$|E

5|$|Contrails are a manmade type of cirrus cloud {{formed when}} water vapor from the exhaust of a jet engine {{condenses}} on particles, which come {{from either the}} surrounding air or the exhaust itself, and freezes, leaving behind a visible trail. The exhaust can also trigger the formation of cirrus by providing ice nuclei {{when there is an}} insufficient naturally-occurring supply in the atmosphere. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> impacts of aviation is that persistent contrails can form into large mats of cirrus, and increased air traffic has been implicated as one possible cause of the increasing frequency and amount of cirrus in Earth's atmosphere.|$|E

5|$|External costs, also {{referred}} to as hidden costs, are quantifications <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> and climate impacts of air transport. Whilst setting a financial value on all such impacts is difficult to do precisely, figures have been produced for the most significant. In 2000 the government valued the annual cost of climate change induced by greenhouse gas emissions from UK air transport at £1.4billion, rising to £4.8billion per annum by 2030. The impact of noise was costed at around £25million per annum in 2000, and for the same year the impact on air quality was costed at between £119million and £236million per annum. Based on figures produced by the European Environment Agency the AEF has calculated a much higher total external cost for 2000 of around £6billion.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, a U.S. Border Patrol {{checkpoint}} {{was opened}} near Dulzura, to combat human and drug trafficking that used SR94, {{as well as}} fatal traffic accidents resulting from such smuggling. Two years later, following a proposal to widen SR94 from Otay Lakes Road to SR188 to address {{the high rate of}} accidents, local residents raised concerns about this proposal. In July1998, the Back Country Coalition sued Caltrans concerning the short length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> impact report as well as not soliciting comments from the public; opponents pushed for a ban of all trucks on the highway. Caltrans agreed to hold another hearing in an out-of-court settlement, as well as to pay $20,000 for the attorneys. In March1999, Caltrans agreed to delay the construction for several years to evaluate the environmental impact. During the early 2000s, the interchange with SR125 was reconstructed to allow for the extension of the latter freeway south to SR54, which was finished in 2003.|$|E

5|$|In the 1960s, as {{evolutionary}} theorists {{explored the}} possibility of multiple units of selection, ecologists turned to evolutionary approaches. In population ecology, debate over group selection was brief but vigorous; by 1970, most biologists agreed that natural selection was rarely effective above the level of individual organisms. The evolution of ecosystems, however, became a lasting research focus. Ecology expanded rapidly with the rise <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> movement; the International Biological Program attempted to apply the methods of big science (which had been so successful in the physical sciences) to ecosystem ecology and pressing environmental issues, while smaller-scale independent efforts such as island biogeography and the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest helped redefine the scope of an increasingly diverse discipline.|$|E
5|$|Lillehammer Municipal Council, Oppland County Council and the Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage {{rejected}} the location because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> impact. These institutions instead {{proposed that the}} track be built at Huseskogen at Hunderfossen. The Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee initially disapproved of the location and in 1990 started looking {{at the possibility of}} constructing the track at Holmenkollen in Oslo. Two routes were considered, one in the same route as Korketrekkeren and one which would run from Gratishaugen at Holmenkollbakken to Midtstuen. Internationally there was support from the International Bobsleigh & Skeleton Federation and the International Luge Federation to build Norway's track in the capital. Concerns about the environmental impact of a Hunderfossen location were raised, particularly regarding visual pollution. However, Hunderfossen was confirmed along with a grant issued by the Parliament of Norway on 24 August 1990.|$|E
5|$|Nixon was a late {{convert to}} the {{conservation}} movement. Environmental policy {{had not been}} a significant issue in the 1968 election; the candidates were rarely asked for their views on the subject. He saw that the first Earth Day in April 1970 presaged a wave of voter interest on the subject, and sought to use that to his benefit; in June he announced the formation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Environmental</b> Protection Agency (EPA). Nixon broke new ground by discussing environment policy in his State of the Union speech; other initiatives supported by Nixon included the Clean Air Act of 1970 and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA); the National Environmental Policy Act required environmental impact statements for many Federal projects. Nixon vetoed the Clean Water Act of 1972—objecting not to the policy goals of the legislation but to the amount of money to be spent on them, which he deemed excessive. After Congress overrode his veto, Nixon impounded the funds he deemed unjustifiable.|$|E
