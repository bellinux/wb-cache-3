40|$|Our {{purpose is}} to {{determine}} the complete set of mutually <b>orthogonal</b> <b>squares</b> of order d, which are not necessary Latin. In this article, we introduce the concept of supersquare of order d, which is defined with the help of its generating subgroup in F_d×F_d. We present a method of construction of the mutually orthogonal supersquares. Further, we investigate the orthogonality of extraordinary supersquares, a special family of squares, whose generating subgroups are extraordinary. The extraordinary subgroups in F_d×F_d are of great importance in the field of quantum information processing, especially for the study of mutually unbiased bases. We determine the most general complete sets of mutually orthogonal extraordinary supersquares of order 4, which consist in the so-called Type I and Type II.

40|$|Generalisation {{properties}} of support vector machines, <b>orthogonal</b> least <b>squares</b> and other variants of the <b>orthogonal</b> least <b>squares</b> algorithms are studied in this paper.

Simple noisy sine and sinx functions are used to show that overfitting in the <b>orthogonal</b> least <b>squares</b> algorithm can be greatly reduced if the free parameters of the algorithm are selected properly. Results on three chaotic time series show that the orthiogonal least squares algorithm is slightly inferior {{compared to the other}} three algorithms.

40|$|AbstractA {{transversal}} T of a {{latin square}} {{is a collection}} of n cells no two in the same row or column and such that each of the integers 1, 2, …, n appears in exactly one of the cells of T. A latin square is doubly diagonalized provided that both its main diagonal and off-diagonal are transversals. Although it is known that a doubly diagonalized latin square of every order n ≥ 4 exists and that a pair of orthogonal latin squares of order n exists for every n ≠ 2 or 6, it is still an open question as to what the spectrum is for pairs of doubly diagonalized orthogonal latin squares. The best general result seems to be that pairs of orthogonal doubly diagonalized latin squares of order n exist whenever n is odd or a multiple of 4, except possibly when n is a multiple of 3 but not of 9. In this paper we give a new construction for doubly diagonalized latin squares which is used to enlarge the known class for doubly diagonalized <b>orthogonal</b> <b>squares.</b> The construction is based on Sade's singular direct product of quasigroups...|$|E
40|$|In some experiments, {{the problem}} is to compare many {{unstructured}} treatments in small blocks, the classical example being the study of new plant varieties on variable land. A common method is to use lattice designs, i. e. block designs based upon rows and columns of a square format, with further replicates being formed, if required, from <b>orthogonal</b> <b>squares</b> applied to the format It {{has been known for}} some time that cubes can be used instead; this paper sets out to explore the possibilities. There are two cases. In one case, the blocks are formed from the planes of the cube and, in the other case, from its lines. The cubic lattice basically has three replicates-one from each dimension-but, if two or four replicates are required, a design can be found by omitting or duplicating one of the dimensions. Where standard treatments need to be introduced, a useful device is to reinforce, i. e. supplement each block with additional plots of standards, with each block of a replicate being supplemented in the same way. These possibilities are examined. It emerges that cubic lattices with two or three replicates usefully extend the range of available designs, but that those with four replicates are disappointing. However, there is the alternative of using designs based upon Latin cubes. This matter is not taken far but it is shown that, where the Latin cube exists, it gives a better design. A quick way of calculating an approximate analysis of variance is given, which is applicable {{in a wide range of}} cases...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{for the first}} time three Latin cubes of the tenth order have been {{superimposed}} to form an Eulerian cube. A Latin cube of the tenth order is defined as a cube of 1000 cells (in ten rows, ten columns, and ten files) in which 1000 numbers consisting of 100 zeros, 100 ones, • • •, 100 nines, are arranged in the cells so that the ten numbers in each row, each column, and each file are different. In this paper, we actually solved two problems, since in addition to having solved the Eulerian cube of order ten, we have also made the cube magic ({{for the first time}}). A magic cube is such that the ten cells in each diagonal (or "diameter") and in every row, every file, and every column is the same — namely, 4995 (see [l]). In what follows, it will be noted that each of the ten SQUARES contain 100 cells and each cell contains a three-digit number. Now, if we delete the third digit on the right side in each and every cell, it is easily verified that each of the ten SQUARES has become pairwise orthogonal. In 1779, Euler conjectured that no pair of <b>orthogonal</b> <b>squares</b> exist for n = 2 (mod 4). Then in 1959, the Euler conjecture was shown to be incorrect by the remarkable mathematics of Bose, Shrikande and Parker [2]. Recently (in 1972) Hoggatt and this author extended Bose, Shrikande and Parker 1 s work by finding a way to make the 10 X 10 square pairwise o r-thogonal as well as magic. For a square to be magic, each of the two diagonals must have the same sum as in every row and in every column — namely (since we are considering the sum of ten cells with two digits in each cell), 495 (see [3]). Let us label the cells in each square as follows: (row, column, square number) = (r, c, s) = some number in a cell. For example, the number 763 in Square Number 0 reads 763 = (0, 0, 0), or say we wish to consider the number 338 in Square Number 1 : we then write 338 = (6, 2, 1) ...|$|E
