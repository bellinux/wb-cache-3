The HIV epidemic is among the factors that have contributed to this increase : patients with AIDS have 1 % annual risk of developing non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, {{and the increase in}} survival of AIDS patients has led to an increase in the frequency of AIDS-associated lymphomas. A number of other viruses are directly involved in the <b>occurence</b> of lymphomas, such as the HTLV- 1 and the EBV: The HSV type 8 has recently been incriminated in the <b>occurence</b> of lymphomas located in the cavities of the body. The role of the hepatitis C virus in the <b>occurence</b> of lymphoma is controversial. Inherited or acquired immunodeficiencies (e. g., due to treatment for an autoimmune disease or transplant) are associated with an increased incidence of lymphoma.

40|$|Being {{interested}} in knowing how far the first year students of PETRA 3 Christian Senior High School Surabaya made the grammatical errors in their writing composition. The writer made some observations {{on the results of}} the first year students English writing tests. The {{purpose of this study is}} to see which grammatical errors are mostly made by the first year students of PETRA 3 Christian Senior High School Surabaya in their writing composition. Grammatical errors are agreement of subject and predicate and parallelism. The agreement of subject and predicate concerns tense markers and the parallelism concerns conjunctions. Then the writer divided each error type into some sub-error types namely omission errors, addition errors and misuse errors. Underlying this study, the writer used the theory of Error Analysis and the theory of Interlanguage. The writer used a composition test with picture series as the instrument of this study. The writer also gave some of key words for every picture. The writer gave this test in order to get the data for this study. The writer analyses and classifies the types of errors, then she counted the frequency of the errors <b>occurences.</b> The errors are ranked from the most to the fewest <b>occurences.</b> The type of errors having the highest number is agreement of subject and predicate (= 528 errors) and the the fewest number is parallelism (= 370 errors).

40|$|Background: Hernia repair in clean-{{contaminated}} or contaminated operations, as in {{incarcerated hernia}} operations, are still debated. Nylon darn repair technique, which foreign bodies {{are less than}} mesh, is cheap and effective for hernia repair despite the fact of its unpopularity. This research is aimed to analyze difference of infection <b>occurence</b> and bacterial count, and its correlation, between nylon darn, macroporous monofilament and multifilament mesh in clean-contaminated operations, in a rat model. Methods: A randomized, bias-free laboratory experimental study was conducted on thirty wister rats. Sample was divided into three groups and applied nylon darn or macroporous monofilament or multifilament mesh. Infection <b>occurence</b> was noted based on Hulton’s criteria, while bacterial count using Spread-Plate method. Results were assessed using Kruskal-Wallis, Mann Whitney, and Spearman tests as appropriate. Results: There {{was a significant difference}} in bacterial count (p= 0. 006), while no difference in infection <b>occurence</b> of all groups (p= 0. 13). There were significant differences between macroporous multifilament mesh vs nylon darn (p= 0. 005) and macroporous monofilament mesh (p= 0. 007). There was no difference in bacterial count between nylon darn vs macroporous monofilament mesh (p= 0. 940). There was strong correlation between infection <b>occurence</b> and bacterial count (p= 0. 000; Spearman’s rho 0. 662). Conclusion: Bacterial count in the application of macroporous multifilament mesh was significantly higher than nylon darn and macropore monofilament mesh, while {{there was no difference between}} nylon darn and macroporous monofilament mesh. There was no difference in infection <b>occurence</b> of all groups despite its strong correlation with bacterial count. Perhaps, it will be possible to note a significant difference of the infection <b>occurence</b> in clinical observation since surgical site infection occurs within 1 year after implant is in place.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to discuss archetypal dreams and their {{relations}} to the dreamers personalities. A questionaire consisting of questions related to the frequency of dream recall and one's interest in dreams and a section for describing freely one's vividest dreams was given to 156 female university students. At the same time MBTI (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator) for Jung's typology was also given to them. To determine whether or not it was archetypal, each dream was rated on the basis of the four criteria of the Archetypal Dream Scale composed by Kluger (1975). The following 4 points were discussed: (1) The frequency of <b>occurence</b> of control dreams and vivid dreams; Kluger's study was followed in part. (2) The relation between collected archetypal dreams and the functions of personalities in Jung's theory. (3) The relation between the frequency of dream recall and functions of personalities or <b>occurence</b> of archetypal dreams. (4) The relation between the subjects' interest in dreams and functions of personalities or <b>occurence</b> of archetypal dreams. The results were as follows: (1) Vivid dreams were significantly (p<. 001) more archetypal than control dreams. (2) The <b>occurence</b> of archetypal dreams had a close relation to Perceiving (Irrational function), especially Intuition in it. Those who had archetypal dreams were superior in their Perceiving and Intuition to those who did not have any archetypal dreams. (3) The frequency of dream recall had a certain relation to Judging (Rational function) and no relations to the <b>occurence</b> of archetypal dreams. Those who had a high frequency of dream recall were superior in Thinking to those who had a low frequency. (4) There were no relations between the degree of the interest in dreams and the function of personalities or the <b>occurence</b> of archetypal dreams...|$|E
