5|$|Following {{his return}} from the war to his {{hometown}} of Romney in June 1865, White was unable to recommence his practice of law or hold a public office due to the existing state laws of the Constitution of West Virginia which disbarred former Confederate States government and military personnel. White's situation was further complicated, as {{he had not been}} pardoned or paroled by the United States for his service in the Confederate States Army. White rented a farm in Hampshire County and engaged in successful agricultural pursuits until the disenfranchisement of former Confederates was struck from the state's constitution in 1872. In 1872, White was elected to the position of Clerk <b>of</b> <b>Court</b> for Hampshire County and began his term the following year in 1873. During his tenure as Clerk <b>of</b> <b>Court</b> for Hampshire County, White also served one term as Clerk of the Circuit Court between 1873 and 1876, but declined to run for a second term in that office. Prior to the American Civil War, White's father John Baker White had also served as the county's Clerk <b>of</b> <b>Court</b> for 47 years between 1815 and 1861. White served as Clerk <b>of</b> <b>Court</b> for Hampshire County for 29 years until 1902. He and his father served in the position a combined total of 76 years.
