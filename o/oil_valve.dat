50|$|Most modern {{turbocharged}} aircraft use {{a hydraulic}} wastegate control with engine oil as the fluid. Systems from Lycoming and Continental {{operate on the}} same principles and use similar parts which differ only in name. Inside the wastegate actuator, a spring acts to open the wastegate, and oil pressure acts to close the wastegate. On the oil output side of the wastegate actuator sits the density controller, an air-controlled <b>oil</b> <b>valve</b> which senses upper deck pressure and controls how fast oil can bleed from the wastegate actuator back to the engine. As the aircraft climbs and the air density drops, the density controller slowly closes the valve and traps more oil in the wastegate actuator, closing the wastegate {{to increase the speed}} of the turbocharger and maintain rated power. Some systems also use a differential pressure controller which senses the air pressures {{on either side of the}} throttle plate and adjusts the wastegate to maintain a set differential. This maintains an optimum balance between a low turbocharger workload and a quick spool-up time, and also prevents surging caused by a bootstrapping effect.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: For {{examination}} and diagnostics of the insulation quality of high voltage devices {{the measurement of}} partial discharge (PD) is accomplished. The conventional PD measurement according to IEC 60270 is in some situations not sensitive enough {{because of the high}} interference level in field. The development of an unconventional measuring method using electromagnetic probes is presented. These probes are inserted in the transformer tank during full operation via an <b>oil</b> <b>valve</b> normally used for oil filling. Due to the shielding characteristics of the transformer tank external electromagnetic disturbances are minimized and enable measurements with high signal-to-noise ratio. New experiences made in measurements in laboratory and in field lead to modified UHF PD probes. The newly developed probes have to be tested on their mechanical and electrical properties. For the functional test of UHF probes the Performance Check is presented. Taking a further step from the Performance Check to a Sensitivity Check- which may in future allow an approximation of the PD quantity comparable to the apparent charge- is discussed. Experiences with the UHF PD Measurement in the field are presented. Furthermore the method of PD localisation by combining UHF measurements with acoustic measurements are shown. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{reliability}} of electrical energy networks {{depends on the}} quality and availability of electrical equipment like power transformers. Local failures inside their insulation may lead to catastrophic breakdowns and can cause high outage and penalty costs. To prevent these fatal events power transformers are tested towards partial discharge (PD) activity before commissioning and currently also during service. This paper introduces the multi-terminal electric PD measurement set-up of on-site transformer measurements and shows some visualization with a star diagram. Mainly the current work deals with the electromagnetic method, also known as UHF-Method. The UHF-Method with a bandwidth from 300 MHz to 3 GHz bases on the fact, that PDs inside oil filled transformers emit electromagnetic waves measurable with <b>oil</b> <b>valve</b> probes inside the transformer tank. The characteristics of low attenuation of electromagnetic waves propagating through different insulating materials and structures like pressboard, oil and windings are investigated on power transformers in the field. An important step for risk estimation in case of PD activity is to locate the geometrical position of PD sources within the transformer. The paper presents the technique of locating PD sources by using run times of UHF signals and acoustic measurements. ...|$|E
40|$|The Two for One Twister (TFO) machine emits very {{disturbing}} noise {{and the noise}} exposes the workers while performing their tasks. The noise also lead to works stress. So, {{it is necessary to}} determine the relationship between the noise and work stress of TFO machine operators. This study was conducted by measuring the noise of TFO engine with Enviro-meter and then correlating the noise and work stress with SPSS 16 software. Spearman correlation test results showed that a strong correlation between noise with work stress (p value = 0. 042). In order to reduce the noise level that will decrease stress for workers, Fault Tree Analysis was conducted to determine the source of the noise. Based on the qualitative analysis of FTA, the causes of the noise were as follows: the lubricating oil was not applied, seal of <b>oil</b> <b>valve</b> leaked, bearing was not replaced (2 years economic life), the traveler was not replaced (10 days economic life), and the Doubling machine was troubled. Based on the quantitative analysis of the probability of job stress of TFO machine operator due to noise TFO machines from a known probability of 0. 041, hence, the system was feasible for use. ...|$|E
50|$|Synthetic <b>valve</b> <b>oils</b> {{have become}} more readily available. Characteristics of {{synthetic}} <b>valve</b> <b>oil</b> include, but are not necessarily limited to, greater compatibility with other related oils without chemical reactions (some types of mineral based oils or their additives were known to react with each other, forming thick solids - this required disassembly and complete cleaning of the valves to restore operation), slow evaporation or total lack of evaporation resulting in fewer oilings required, and less dissipation on contact with moisture inside the valve. Some synthetics have the additional advantage {{that they do not}} act as thinners for mineral based slide greases (previously, mineral based <b>valve</b> <b>oil</b> inserted into a valve by way of a tuning slide could carry some slide grease with it, fouling the valve). Finally, high-viscosity synthetic <b>oils</b> can increase <b>valve</b> compression and improve feel in instruments with worn valves, returning such instruments to playable condition.|$|R

A possibility of UHF probe standardization basing on the antenna factor is presented. Additionally a general aspect of the UHF method can be concluded regarding the insertion depth of UHF probes inside the transformer tank. Furthermore there is still a discussion about the exact origin of UHF waves or the radiation behaviour of the high voltage structure. The PD source itself, e. g. a point needle arrangement, might be too small for emitting UHF waves like an antenna. An idea of measuring the influence of the structure on the radiation of PD is presented. 1...|$|E
