5|$|Delayed by {{the change}} to the rules, McCool had a five-year stint from 1956 in English county cricket. Somerset, having {{finished}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> County Championship table for the four years between 1952–1955, had embarked on a renewal programme. Part of the programme involved a vigorous recruiting campaign, including an offer to McCool that saw him return to first-class cricket {{at the age of}} 39.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, an {{immigrant}} family acquired {{ownership of the}} theater. The Maizels family also owned other cinemas, including Aladdin Theater, the defunct and demolished Walnut Park, and the Encore, now known as Clinton Street Theater. In addition to Hollywood films, the cinemas screened art-house and Spanish-language movies. Multi-light Broadway Sign Co. installed corrugated aluminum <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> marquee in 1975.|$|E
5|$|In {{what turned}} out to be their final ever game, Cumberland were only able to field eleven out of the {{required}} thirteen players. The club ended up borrowing two players from the opposing team North Sydney to play for them, who were 'Paddy' Boland and Bert Odbert. They lost this game 45–0 and were awarded the wooden spoon for finishing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> competition ladder.|$|E

5|$|König was interned, {{along with}} the {{majority}} of the High Seas Fleet, in Scapa Flow in November 1918 following the Armistice. On 21 June 1919, Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter gave the order to scuttle the fleet, including König, while the British guard ships were out of the harbor on exercises. Unlike most of the scuttled ships, König was never raised for scrapping; the wreck is still <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bay.|$|E
5|$|On June 20, 2017, the Devils {{revealed}} {{their new}} uniforms for the 2017–18 season. Made by Adidas, the new sweaters {{are the first}} major change to the team's look since they replaced green with black. They feature {{the removal of the}} stripes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sweater, and also thicker sleeve stripes with equal width bands of white and black.|$|E

5|$|The Gevninge helmet {{fragment}} is {{what remains}} of a Danish helmet from the Viking Age or end of the Nordic Iron Age. Made of gilded bronze, it consists of a stylised eyebrow above an oval with eyelashes, and originally formed the right eyepiece of the helmet. Three holes {{on the top and}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fragment would have once held it in place.|$|E
5|$|Two torpedoes {{fired by}} {{land-based}} torpedo batteries struck the ship, causing serious damage. A major {{fire broke out}} aboard Blücher, {{which could not be}} contained. After a magazine explosion, the ship sank, with major loss of life. The wreck remains <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Oslofjord.|$|E
5|$|After Germany's {{defeat in}} {{the war and the}} signing of the Armistice in November 1918, Kronprinz and most of the capital ships of the High Seas Fleet were interned by the Royal Navy in Scapa Flow. The ships were {{disarmed}} and reduced to skeleton crews while the Allied powers negotiated {{the final version of the}} Treaty of Versailles. On 21 June 1919, days before the treaty was signed, the commander of the interned fleet, Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, ordered the fleet to be scuttled to ensure that the British would not be able to seize the ships. Unlike most of the other scuttled ships, Kronprinz was never raised for scrapping; the wreck is still <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> harbour.|$|E

5|$|Brummer and Bremse {{typically}} operated together {{throughout the}} war. They participated in numerous minelaying operations in 1916 and 1917. The two cruisers devastated a British convoy to Norway in October 1917, sinking the two escorting destroyers {{and most of}} the transports. Both were interned at Scapa Flow {{at the end of the}} war; they were successfully scuttled in June 1919. Brummer remains <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> harbor, but Bremse was raised for scrapping in 1929 and broken up in the early 1930s.|$|E
5|$|In Shin Megami Tensei II, {{the player}} takes {{the role of}} the gladiator Hawk, who is able to {{communicate}} with demons. The gameplay {{is similar to that of}} the first Shin Megami Tensei: the game is controlled from a first-person view, and has the player exploring dungeons and navigating outdoor areas, which are presented as 2D maps seen from a top-down perspective. In both these types of areas, the player encounters and battles against demons; a gauge <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> screen shows the likelihood of a demon encounter.|$|E

Johnson, Robbie, and Gabe hide from Mace in a special containment module <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Zephyr, and Robbie explains the truth to Gabe: the night he was paralyzed, Robbie was killed in the car crash, and was resurrected when a Ghost Rider passed on the Spirit of Vengeance to him.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, while {{orbiting}} the Earth during a routine space mission with his crew, Colonel John Jameson and his ship are {{hit by a}} meteor shower. John struggles to get the ship back safely on Earth but eventually succeeds in landing it at Cape Canaveral. The next day, Jonah learns that the Globes cover story on the Goblin's rampage—featuring Peter's photos—is outselling the Bugles story on John's heroic space journey. An infuriated Jameson decides {{to meet with the}} public's demand by publishing a new cover story questioning if Spider-Man is a hero or a menace. Meanwhile, John is interviewed at the shuttle hangar when he spots a mysterious, vibrating black goo <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shuttle.|$|E
5|$|<b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> skull, the pterygoid {{is about}} twice as wide as it is long. At {{the front of the}} pterygoid is a small {{projection}} that extends backwards to form a ridge, on either side of which is a furrow-like depression (the choanal groove) containing the choanae. In Theriosuchus, unlike Knoetschkesuchus, the choanae are embedded in a wider bowl-like depression. Additionally, in both species, the bottom surface of the pterygoid is somewhat concave. Extending forward from either side of the pterygoid is the ectopterygoid; in both species, this bone is constricted near the middle to form an hourglass-like shape, but in K. langenbergensis it is also somewhat twisted to the side. The back of the bone is very concave in both species.|$|E
5|$|Retained {{under the}} Washington Naval Treaty of 1922, both ships were modernized significantly, with torpedo bulges and oil-fired boilers {{installed}} and other improvements made, but were demilitarized under {{terms of the}} 1930 London Naval Treaty. Florida was scrapped, Utah converted into first a radio-controlled target ship, then an anti-aircraft gunnery trainer. She served in the latter role until sunk by the Japanese during the attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941. Her hull, never raised, remains <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> harbor as a war memorial.|$|E

5|$|Revelation {{features}} several gameplay enhancements {{that aid}} puzzle solving and plot progression. Early in the game, players receive a camera, {{which can be}} used to take screenshots or pictures of clues. Players can use an on-screen journal to jot down notes instead of having to write down clues as with previous Myst games. Much of the game's story is revealed via flashbacks triggered by an amulet that has the power to relay memories attached to objects. Zip mode, the amulet, the camera, and the journal are available via a menu <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game screen.|$|E
5|$|The captain {{ordered the}} ship {{abandoned}} {{later in the}} day, and the carrier was still afloat in the evening, albeit with a slight list to port and down by the bow. Over {{the next couple of}} days, more compartments in the ship flooded and she settled <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> harbor. Another attack on 28 July hit her several more times and the resulting damage from those hits and more near-misses to port caused the ship to list further to port. This gradually increased through the next day until Amagi capsized at 10:00 on the morning of 29 July with part of her flight deck falling overboard. The losses among the ship's crew are unknown, but were supposedly light.|$|E
5|$|The turn-based battles are {{triggered}} through random encounters. The {{player has}} several options, including fighting and fleeing from battle. The number of enemies are indicated by small sprites <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> battle screen. During their turn in combat, the protagonist and current companion can perform an action such as attacking using melee or ranged attacks such as magic, or use an item which can weaken the enemy or strengthen the player party. Upon successfully completing a battle, {{the party is}} awarded with experience points, skill points, items and money. Skill points are assigned to the protagonist's attributes such as speed or magic, modifying future performance in battle.|$|E
