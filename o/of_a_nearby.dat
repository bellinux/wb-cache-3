5|$|However, cooler waters {{eventually}} {{caught up}} to Humberto and it began to weaken once again early on August 31 as it tracked into the north Atlantic. That afternoon, Humberto weakened to a tropical storm as its circulation became embedded into a circulation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> extratropical low in a high-shear environment. It continued to weaken that evening, and early on September 1, the tropical storm was absorbed by the larger system.|$|E
5|$|Pegasus Bridge, {{a target}} of the British 6th Airborne, {{was the site of}} some of the {{earliest}} action of the Normandy landings. The bridge was replaced in 1994 by one similar in appearance, and the original is now housed on the grounds <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> museum complex. Sections of Mulberry Harbour B still sit in the sea at Arromanches, and the well-preserved Longues-sur-Mer battery is nearby. The Juno Beach Centre, opened in 2003, was funded by the Canadian federal and provincial governments, France, and Canadian veterans.|$|E

5|$|The {{earthquake}} {{occurred as}} a result of normal faulting to the west of Iwaki and triggered numerous landslides across adjacent mountainous areas. A few fires broke out, and 220,000 households lost electricity. Officials issued localised tsunami alerts, though no significant waves were generated. The earthquake caused little structural damage, but killed four people and injured ten others. The strong ground movements triggered the reactivation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> geological fault, prompting researchers to conduct extensive surveys in the region.|$|E

5|$|When Ruffing was 15 years old, he {{suffered}} an {{accident in the}} mine, where his left foot was crushed between two cars. Though the doctor was able to save his foot, Red lost four toes. He was supposed to begin his professional baseball career in the Kentucky–Illinois–Tennessee League that year, but he found himself unable to run {{as fast as he}} previously could. Doc Bennett, the manager <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> semi-professional team, suggested that Ruffing should try to continue pursuing a baseball career by becoming a pitcher.|$|E
5|$|When {{electrons}} and positrons collide, they annihilate each other, {{giving rise to}} two or more gamma ray photons. If the electron and positron have negligible momentum, a positronium atom can form before annihilation results {{in two or three}} gamma ray photons totalling 1.022MeV. On the other hand, high-energy photons can transform into an electron and a positron by a process called pair production, but only in the presence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> charged particle, such as a nucleus.|$|E
5|$|A large {{subdivision}} near Route30 sustained minor {{roof and}} tree damage, which was rated as EF0intensity. However, as the tornado was intensifying through the neighborhood, three homes to the subdivision's east suffered more considerable roof and siding damage and was assigned an EF1damage intensity rating. The tornado then crossed Missouri Route 141, where it blew a Honda CR-V into a highway barrier; {{the driver of}} the vehicle suffered critical injuries and died eleven days later from those injuries. After crossing the highway, a number of buildings were damaged including a church, elementary school, and parsonage. Damage in this area was rated as EF2 due to the partial debarking <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> tree. Minor tree damage occurred as the tornado moved through Fenton Park and tracked over the Meramec River.|$|E

5|$|A special {{relativistic}} redshift formula (and its classical approximation) {{can be used}} {{to calculate}} the redshift <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> object when spacetime is flat. However, in many contexts, such as black holes and Big Bang cosmology, redshifts must be calculated using general relativity. Special relativistic, gravitational, and cosmological redshifts can be understood under the umbrella of frame transformation laws. There exist other physical processes that can lead to a shift in the frequency of electromagnetic radiation, including scattering and optical effects; however, the resulting changes are distinguishable from true redshift and are not generally referred to as such (see section on physical optics and radiative transfer).|$|E
5|$|After {{the events}} of Iron Man 3, Mike Peterson is out with his son, Ace, when the top floor <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> {{building}} explodes. Peterson uses enhanced strength to save a trapped woman from the building, and is filmed doing so by Skye, {{a member of the}} hacktivist group the Rising Tide. S.H.I.E.L.D. deputy director Maria Hill interviews Grant Ward for a new team under Agent Phil Coulson, who is officially dead. Coulson assigns Ward level 7 security clearance, and reveals the team's first mission is to investigate the Rising Tide. Coulson also recruits the reluctant Agent Melinda May, who had previously retired from field duty.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{has survived}} years of wear and warfare, {{one of the}} palace's wings is now in danger of {{collapsing}} into the Black Sea below. Cracks have begun {{to appear in the}} library, housing almost 10,000 books and manuscripts. Although Edward Blore had a state-of-the-art drainage system built into the palace's foundation, years of neglect and the construction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> sewage pipe in 1974 have helped to increase the potential for a landslide. Another potential looming disaster is surrounding the medieval-style gatehouse near the palace's west side.|$|E

5|$|In 2012, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) {{assessed}} both Coquerel's giant {{mouse lemur}} {{and the northern}} giant mouse lemur as endangered. Prior to that, both species had been listed as vulnerable. Populations of both species are in decline due to habitat destruction, primarily for slash-and-burn agriculture and charcoal production. Also, they are both hunted for bushmeat. The population announced by the WWF in 2010 was found outside the limits <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> protected area, PK32-Ranobe, which was granted temporary protection status in December 2008 and is co-managed by the WWF.

5|$|Maggie {{tells them}} that the item is a computer, with the {{location}} of five tons of refined plutonium abandoned in a mine by the Soviet Union after the Cold War. Vilain intends to retrieve the plutonium and sell it. The Expendables are able to weakly track the computer's signal and follow Vilain, which leads them to Bulgaria where they stay overnight at an abandoned Russian military base. The next morning, the team is ambushed by the Sangs and a tank. After the Expendables run out of ammunition, they are saved by Ross's old friend, Booker, who quickly eliminates both the Sangs and the tank. Before he departs, Booker informs the group <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> village whose residents oppose Vilain. Meanwhile, Hector and Vilain dig up the plutonium and begin collecting it.|$|E

5|$|Nanmadol {{developed}} from an isolated area of convection south-southwest of Pohnpei that became {{classified as a}} tropical depression on November28. Within highly conducive conditions for development, the system reached tropical storm intensity the following day, followed by typhoon intensity on November30. Quickly pacing towards the north-northwest about the periphery <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> subtropical ridge, Nanmadol reached its peak intensity on December1 with winds of 165km/h (105mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 935mbar (hPa; 27.61inHg). Shortly after, the typhoon made landfall at a similar intensity on Casiguran, Aurora, quickly moving over Luzon before reaching the South China Sea, where it recurved northward into hostile atmospheric conditions. Over the next few days, Nanmadol weakened and later transitioned into an extratropical cyclone near Taiwan on December4, whereafter it merged with another extratopical system.|$|E
5|$|Of the 56 {{people on}} board, 38, {{including}} Hood and Beaumont, {{died in the}} crash. Eighteen survived, albeit with injuries, and {{climbed out of the}} wreckage. After briefly settling the others, one of the passengers, Dr Cecil MacLaren, led four others—young newlyweds Robert and Shannon Hargreaves, Mrs Sharon Coles, and her four-year-old daughter Tracey—off in the direction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> village in search of water. The other 13 remained close to the wreckage. Meanwhile, nine guerrillas made their way towards the crash site, and reached it at about 17:45. Three of the 13 survivors remaining at the crash site hid on seeing figures approaching: Rhodesian Army reservist Anthony Hill, 39, took cover in the surrounding bush, while businessman Hans Hansen and his wife Diana did the same. This left 10 passengers in full view near the wreckage, including four women and two girls (aged 11 and 4).|$|E
