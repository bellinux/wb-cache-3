40|$|Abstract: Position sensor {{is the key}} of exact {{commutation}} for switched {{reluctance motor}} (SRM). When position sensor is faulted, some phase information of commutation will be lost, causes torque decrease, affects the system reliability. Through the analysis <b>of</b> the fault <b>position</b> signals, a real-time diagnostic method that detected the edge sequences <b>of</b> <b>position</b> signals and calculated the angle between the adjacent edges <b>of</b> <b>position</b> signals is proposed. After fault <b>of</b> <b>position</b> signal is diagnosed, fault-tolerant control is carried out immediately {{by taking advantage of}} the redundant information <b>of</b> <b>position</b> signal detection scheme and the time between the adjacent edges <b>of</b> <b>position</b> signals. The validity and practicability of fault analysis, fault diagnosis and fault-tolerant control is verified by simulated fault experiments on SRM. Copyright © 2013 IFSA...|$|R

5|$|The number <b>of</b> <b>positions</b> {{available}} {{to women in}} the ADF has increased over time. Although servicewomen were initially barred from combat positions, these restrictions began to be lifted in 1990. In 2010 approximately 92% of employment categories and 84% <b>of</b> <b>positions</b> in the ADF were {{available to}} females as well as males. In September 2011 Minister for Defence Stephen Smith announced that the Cabinet had decided to remove all restrictions on women serving in combat positions, and that this change would come into effect within five years. This decision {{was supported by the}} CDF and the chiefs of the services. Women became able to apply for all positions other than special forces roles in the Army on 1 January 2013. This remaining restriction was removed during 2016.|$|E

5|$|As the Operation Papuk-91 completed, the HV units {{subordinated to}} the Pakrac OG {{advanced}} to the villages of Kraguj, Japaga and Šeovica on 26–27 December 1991, outflanking the southern parts of Pakrac held by the JNA and the TO. The JNA employed the reinforcements it received to counter the threat. On 28 December, the JNA recaptured the two villages and threatened the Pakrac–Požega road. The same day, the HV retreated from Kraguj {{to the village of}} Kusonje to defend the road. On 29 December, the 127th Infantry Brigade suffered a loss of 12 killed or captured as it performed reconnaissance <b>of</b> <b>positions</b> held by the JNA and the TO on the Psunj Mountain, in the villages of Brusnik and Lipovac. The unit failed to advance later on.|$|E
5|$|During the Tests, Miller usually batted at No. 5, {{except in}} the Fourth Test when he batted at No. 4 due to the injury-enforced absence of opener Barnes, which {{resulted}} in a reshuffle in the batting order. Miller totalled 1,088 first-class runs for the tour, the seventh highest aggregate, although his average of 47.30 was only the eighth highest in the squad. During the tour matches, he batted in a variety <b>of</b> <b>positions,</b> as did all of the squad, because Bradman used a rotation system to rest his team because many matches were played consecutively.|$|E
5|$|Each team {{consists}} of a maximum of eleven players (excluding substitutes), one of whom must be the goalkeeper.

Goalkeepers are the only players allowed to play the ball with their hands or arms, provided they do so within the penalty area {{in front of their}} own goal. Though there are a variety <b>of</b> <b>positions</b> in which the outfield (non-goalkeeper) players are strategically placed by a coach, these positions are not defined or required by the Laws.|$|E

Wide receivers Willie Reid, Greg Carr and Chris Davis were the primary beneficiaries of Weatherford's passing offense during the 2005 season. Carr, a freshman, caught 27passes for 593yards and a conference-leading ninetouchdowns. Davis, a junior, caught more passes and recorded more receiving yards during the 2005season than he had in both his previous seasons combined. Reid, the lone senior starting in the Florida State corps of wide receivers, played in a variety <b>of</b> <b>positions</b> on offense and held the Seminoles' team record for most punt return yardage.|$|E
5|$|Gerald L. Zahorchak is an American {{educator}} {{and the former}} Secretary of Education for the Pennsylvania Department of Education, a position he held from 2006 to 2010. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Zahorchak worked at various Pennsylvania public school districts in a number <b>of</b> <b>positions,</b> including teacher, football coach, principal, federal programs director, strategic planning coordinator and personnel director. Zahorchak worked as superintendent of the Greater Johnstown School District in Cambria County from 1997 to 2003, when he was chosen to be Deputy Secretary for Elementary and Secondary Education for the state. Governor Ed Rendell appointed him Secretary of Education in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Hamming {{set himself}} {{the task of}} solving this problem, which he {{realised}} would have an enormous range of applications. Each bit can only be a zero or a one, so if you know which bit is wrong, then it can be corrected. In a landmark paper published in 1950, he introduced a concept of the number <b>of</b> <b>positions</b> in which two code words differ, and therefore how many changes are required to transform one code word into another, which is today known as the Hamming distance. Hamming thereby created a family of mathematical error-correcting code, which are called Hamming codes. This not only solved an important problem in telecommunications and computer science, it {{opened up a whole}} new field of study.|$|E

On October 15, 1951, Harris reported to NAS Memphis for a two-month pilot refresher training before being assigned to NAS Pensacola for flight duty. Following this post, Harris served in the Air Warfare Division of the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (OpNav) at The Pentagon, and after the Korean War he moved through a number <b>of</b> <b>positions</b> at different Naval Air Stations.

5|$|In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, {{also known}} as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, {{is one of the}} {{simplest}} and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number <b>of</b> <b>positions</b> down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.|$|E
5|$|Khrushchev {{was born}} on 15 April 1894, in Kalinovka, a village {{in what is now}} Russia's Kursk Oblast, near the present Ukrainian border. His parents, Sergei Khrushchev and Ksenia Khrushcheva, were poor peasants of Russian origin, and had a {{daughter}} two years Nikita's junior, Irina. Sergei Khrushchev was employed in a number <b>of</b> <b>positions</b> in the Donbas area of far eastern Ukraine, working as a railwayman, as a miner, and laboring in a brick factory. Wages were much higher in the Donbas than in the Kursk region, and Sergei Khrushchev generally left his family in Kalinovka, returning there when he had enough money.|$|E
40|$|The east-west <b>positions</b> <b>of</b> 190 type 3 bursts were {{measured}} between 30 and 65 MHz with the log-periodic array at Clark Lake. A method is described {{to find the}} intrinsic variation <b>of</b> <b>position</b> with frequency <b>of</b> type 3 bursts based on the comparison <b>of</b> the <b>positions</b> <b>of</b> the bursts measured at any two arbitrary frequencies. It is found that the variation <b>of</b> <b>position</b> frequency agrees with the behaviour expected from coronal density models. This suggests that the measured positions were not seriously affected by scattering in the corona. Knowing the functional form of the variation <b>of</b> <b>position</b> with frequency for type 3 bursts, it is shown that the observed burst positions can be corrected {{for the effects of}} ionospheric refraction...|$|R
