5|$|In {{common with}} other Mesoamerican cultures, the Maya worshipped {{feathered}} serpent deities. Such worship was rare during the Classic period, {{but by the}} Postclassic the feathered serpent had spread to both the Yucatán Peninsula and the Guatemalan Highlands. In Yucatán, the feathered serpent deity was Kukulkan, among the K'iche' it was Q'uq'umatz. Kukulkan had his origins in the Classic period War Serpent, Waxaklahun Ubah Kan, and has also been identified as the Postclassic version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vision</b> Serpent of Classic Maya art. Although the cult of Kukulkan had its origins in these earlier Maya traditions, the worship of Kukulkan was heavily influenced by the Quetzalcoatl cult of central Mexico. Likewise, Q'uq'umatz had a composite origin, combining the attributes of Mexican Quetzalcoatl with aspects of the Classic period Itzamna.|$|E

From 1978 to 1984, the city hosted the Tulsa Roughnecks, who played in the now-defunct North American Soccer League and won that league's championship in 1983. Also in 1984, the city hosted the Oklahoma Outlaws of the now-defunct United States Football League for a single season.|$|E
30|$|These visions {{provide a}} unique {{opportunity}} to examine European citizen sentiments and values concerning the future because the citizen involvement methodology applied to create <b>the</b> <b>visions</b> and <b>the</b> format <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>visions</b> have been uniform in the conducted European involvement projects. <b>The</b> task <b>of</b> producing comprehensive analyses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>visions</b> has however proven to be arduous. This is partly due to <b>the</b> rich character <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>visions</b> in <b>the</b> sense that each vision may relate to a number <b>of</b> topics, making <b>the</b> <b>visions</b> hard to categorise. Furthermore, an established methodology for analysing <b>the</b> <b>visions</b> has not emerged yet, which has prevented <b>the</b> analysis <b>of</b> <b>visions</b> across projects. Instead, <b>the</b> <b>visions</b> have been analysed inductively and qualitatively within each project, thus connecting <b>the</b> <b>visions</b> to project procedures rather than to comparative methodologies [9]. <b>The</b> lack <b>of</b> an established methodology for cross-project analysis has also prevented the reflection or <b>the</b> positioning <b>of</b> new sets <b>of</b> citizen <b>visions</b> against <b>the</b> previously produced ones.|$|R

5|$|Ray {{gathered}} an inexperienced crew, {{although both}} his cameraman Subrata Mitra and art director Bansi Chandragupta {{went on to}} achieve great acclaim. The cast consisted of mostly amateur actors. He started shooting in late 1952 with his personal savings and hoped to raise more money once he had some passages shot, but did not succeed on his terms. As a result, Ray shot Pather Panchali over three years, an unusually long period, based on when he or his production manager Anil Chowdhury could raise additional funds. He refused funding from sources who wanted a change in script or supervision over production. He also ignored advice from the government to incorporate a happy ending, but he did receive funding {{that allowed him to}} complete the film. Ray showed an early film passage to the American director John Huston, who was in India scouting locations for The Man Who Would Be King. The passage was <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vision</b> which Apu and his sister have of the train running through the countryside, the only sequence which Ray had yet filmed due to his small budget. Huston notified Monroe Wheeler at the New York Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) that a major talent was on the horizon.|$|E
5|$|The next scene {{shows the}} {{sarcophagus}} with Constantina, {{the daughter of}} the Emperor Constantine, asleep on top of it, wearing a crown.

The presence at left of a young man on crutches, not in the source, suggests that others are doing the same. The sleeping woman beside the tomb is either another such, or an attendant on the princess. As Constantina sleeps, Agnes, holding her lamb, appears to her, saying Si in xpm (Christum) credideris sanaberis ("If you believe in Christ you will be healed", an adaptation of the text in the source). In the final scene, the cured, and baptized, Constantina tells her crowned father the story, with the inscription Hec est virgo sapiens una de numero prudencium ("This is a wise virgin, one of the number of the prudent").|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> {{concepts}} <b>of</b> transformational {{and charismatic}} leadership {{have led to}} a variety of leadership behaviors and practices that seek to enhance followers' motivation to perform beyond expectations, by changing their values, goals, needs and aspirations at work. One such activity, which has gained momentum and interest in recent years, is <b>the</b> dissemination <b>of</b> a <b>vision.</b> This thesis is an attempt to investigate <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>visioning</b> process in organizational leadership through theoretical analysis and empirical investigation. An analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>visioning</b> process yielded two important components: <b>the</b> <b>visioning</b> activity and <b>the</b> <b>visioning</b> product. Based on this analysis and a review <b>of</b> <b>the</b> existing literature, <b>vision</b> was defined as a product with content and <b>the</b> <b>visioning</b> activity a two-stage process involving vision formulation and vision articulation. Building on these definitions, a number of vision content characteristics and visioning behaviors were examined, leading to theoretical propositions and testable hypotheses. <b>The</b> empirical test <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proposed theoretical framework was carried out in two studies. Study 1 investigated observers' perceptions of leader behaviors, vision content characteristics and related attributions of vision and visionary leadership. This study was conducted using analyses of biographical and autobiographical accounts. Study 2 sought to replicate the investigation with direct observations from followers of "real-life" organizational leaders. The empirical test substantiated <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> distinguishing between <b>the</b> various content characteristics of visions as they relate to attributions of vision and visionary leadership on <b>the</b> part <b>of</b> observers/followers. <b>The</b> empirical results also support <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> distinguishing between <b>the</b> various components <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>visioning</b> activity <b>of</b> leaders as they relate to attributions of vision and visionary leadership on <b>the</b> part <b>of</b> observers/followers. Finally, <b>the</b> results suggest distinct relationships between <b>the</b> attributions <b>of</b> vision/visionary leadership and various effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>visioning</b> process on followers. In light of these results, suggestions for future research and implications for leadership practice are discussed...|$|R
