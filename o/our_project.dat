2500|$|Spanish {{scientists}} have dismissed Freund's claims {{claiming that he}} was sensationalising their work. The anthropologist Juan Villarías-Robles, who works with the Spanish National Research Council, said [...] "Richard Freund was a newcomer to <b>our</b> <b>project</b> {{and appeared to be}} [...] involved in his own very controversial issue concerning King Solomon's search for ivory and gold in Tartessos, the well documented settlement in [...] the Doñana area established in the first millennium BC" [...] and described his claims as 'fanciful'.|$|E

2500|$|His {{contemporary}} Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī {{also introduced}} an early scientific method {{in nearly every}} field of inquiry he studied. For example, in his treatise on mineralogy, Kitab al-Jamahir (Book of Precious Stones), he is [...] "the most exact of experimental scientists", while {{in the introduction to}} his study of India, he declares that [...] "to execute <b>our</b> <b>project,</b> it has not been possible to follow the geometric method" [...] and develops comparative sociology as a scientific method in the field. He was also responsible for introducing the experimental method into mechanics, the first to conduct elaborate experiments related to astronomical phenomena, and a pioneer of experimental psychology.|$|E
2500|$|The Fallen Lords was {{originally}} conceived by Jason Jones as Bungie were {{nearing the end}} of development of Marathon Infinity in late-1995. They had planned to do another first-person shooter as their next game. However, the initial screenshots of id Software's Quake had just been released, and when Jones saw them, he felt Bungie's new game was shaping up as too similar. As such, he approached his colleagues with the question [...] "What do you think about having this world with 100 guys fighting 100 other guys in 3D?" [...] Bungie had worked on several 3D action games for Mac OS, and Jones' idea was to bring that experience to a real-time strategy game rather than another first-person game. The team agreed with Jones that their new shooter could end up as being very similar to Quake, and, as such, after working on the project for two months, Jones explains [...] "in one day we switched <b>our</b> <b>project</b> from a shooter game that would have had us chasing our competition's tail to what has basically become Myth." ...|$|E
2500|$|Improving the {{conditions}} of the streets of London is not just a question of how to prevent crime or to apprehend robbers, Moreton actually recognises how the architectonic structure of roads, lanes, and avenues might make a difference, otherwise [...] "all by-turnings, courts, alleys, lanes, , which may favour a street-robber's escape, and make <b>our</b> <b>project</b> ineffectual". London criminals had endless opportunities to escape from a pursuer, and as Henry Fielding wrote in 1751 in his essay An Enquiry into the Causes of the Late Increase of Robbers: Whoever indeed considers the Cities of London and Westminster, with the late vast Addition of their Suburbs; the great irregularity of their Buildings, the immense Number of Lanes, Alleys, Courts and Bye-places; must think, that, had they intended for the very purpose of Concealment, they could scarce have been contrived. Upon such a view, the whole appears as a vast Wood or Forest, in which a Thief may harbour with as great Security, as wild Beasts do in the Deserts of Africa or Arabia. And indeed, as we also learn from Defoe's fictions, if you knew where to look the city might offer unexpectedly comfortable corners.|$|E

2500|$|A 2007 {{study focused}} on the EMA subclade has shed further light on the EMA mutations. [...] "The 36 new {{isolates}} reported here greatly expand the amount of whole-genome sequence data available from recent avian influenza (H5N1) isolates. Before <b>our</b> <b>project,</b> GenBank contained only 5 other complete genomes from Europe for the 2004–2006 period, and it contained no whole genomes from the Middle East or northern Africa. Our analysis showed several new findings. First, all European, Middle Eastern, and African samples fall into a clade that is distinct from other contemporary Asian clades, all of which share common ancestry with the original 1997 Hong Kong strain. Phylogenetic trees built {{on each of the}} 8 segments show a consistent picture of 3 lineages, as illustrated by the HA tree shown in Figure 1. Two of the clades contain exclusively Vietnamese isolates; the smaller of these, with 5 isolates, we label V1; the larger clade, with 9 isolates, is V2. The remaining 22 isolates all fall into a third, clearly distinct clade, labeled EMA, which comprises samples from Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. Trees for the other 7 segments display a similar topology, with clades V1, V2, and EMA clearly separated in each case. Analyses of all available complete influenza (H5N1) genomes and of 589 HA sequences placed the EMA clade as distinct from the major clades circulating in People's Republic of China, Indonesia, and Southeast Asia." ...|$|E
