40|$|When a {{layer of}} sand is {{vertically}} shaken, the surface spontaneously breaks up in a landscape of small conical “Faraday heaps,” which merge into larger ones on an ever increasing time scale. We propose a model for <b>the</b> <b>heap</b> dynamics and show analytically that <b>the</b> mean lifetime <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transient state with N heaps scales as N − 2. When there is an abundance of sand, such that the vibrating plate always remains completely covered, this means that <b>the</b> average diameter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>heaps</b> grows as t 1 / 2. Otherwise, when the sand is less plentiful and parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plate get depleted during the coarsening process, <b>the</b> average diameter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>heaps</b> grows more slowly, namely as t 1 / 3.

40|$|Sewage sludge re-used in {{agriculture}} {{has to be}} stabilized and is often stored for several months before land spreading. Stabilization treatment may affect <b>the</b> behaviour <b>of</b> heavy metals such as Cu, which is an element potentially toxic to the environment. In the present study, <b>the</b> chemical forms <b>of</b> copper have been investigated in heaps of limed and unlimed sludge coming from the wastewater treatment plant of Roselies (Belgium). These limed and unlimed aerobically digested sludges were stored during 4 mo in controlled conditions close to field ones. The sequential extraction procedure developed by Tessier {{was used to determine}} the copper chemical forms of representative samples taken in the outer shell and in <b>the</b> depth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>heaps.</b> <b>The</b> physico-chemical properties (pH, organic matter, dry matter and temperature) of these samples were also monitored. This study shows that liming transforms part of organically-bound copper into both exchangeable and residual copper. These changes mainly occur during the first 2 wk of storage. After several months of storage, copper passes from the residual fraction to the exchangeable and oxide fractions. During the whole experiment, changes occur faster in the outer shell than in <b>the</b> depth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>heaps.</b> Thus, we demonstrate that <b>the</b> distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> copper forms depends on the storage time and it is different in the outer shell from that in <b>the</b> depth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>heaps.</b> © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Heaps of fire cracked stones is an {{apparent}} feature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Scandinavian Bronze Age. <b>The</b> <b>heaps</b> are built <b>of</b> stones cracked by fire and then placed in different constructions. <b>The</b> <b>heaps</b> {{are placed in}} different contexts in the Bronze Age landscape {{and for a long}} time, research neglected this site category owing to that <b>the</b> <b>heaps</b> were not considered important enough to dig. During the 1980 s- 90 s the interest for <b>the</b> <b>heaps</b> <b>of</b> fire cracked stones increased and it became a wellresearched although debated site category. Earlier research has interpreted <b>the</b> <b>heaps</b> to be on the hillslopes in the landscape. This study’s research aims to understand the relation between shorelines and <b>the</b> placement <b>of</b> fire cracked stone heaps.

By creating a dynamic shoreline displacement, the essay will {{be able to look at}} the landscape in a more detailed way and will be able to investigate the relation between <b>the</b> <b>heaps</b> and <b>the</b> water edge.

40|$|This paper {{examined}} <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> {{multiple imputation}} to analyze heaped data. When people {{are asked to}} recall certain durations such as unemployment spells, they tend to round their answers off to the nearest year or half year causing abnormal concentrations of response at these durations. In order to model these heaped data, a method is developed which specifes <b>the</b> <b>heaping</b> mechanism and <b>the</b> underlying true model {{referred to as the}} estimated underlying model. This model is used to create a new data set using multiple imputation so that new durations are generated for the persons who have rounded off their duration. The recent paper examined whether it is more favourable to obtain the estimates from the estimated underlying model directly or from the method in which multiple imputation is used. A simulation study is performed in which misspecification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> model and misspecification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>heaping</b> mechanism is introduced so that the estimates using the different methods can be compared. The results show that multiple imputation leads to more precise estimates and is more robust for model misspecification than estimates based directly on the estimated true underlying distribution.

During this period, he played almost no concerts, except in 1977 and 1982 in Japan, and in 1984 in Europe. Despite the low profile, he did record six albums as a leader between 1977 and 1984 (including a 1984 trombone duo album with Al Grey) and a few albums as a sideman, two with Basie, and on The Sting II soundtrack.

40|$|Forms of Nim {{have been}} played since antiquity and a {{complete}} theory was published as early as 1902 (see [3]).
