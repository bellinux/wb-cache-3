In its most basic form, <b>O.</b> <b>R.</b> may be viewed as a scientific approach to solving problems; it abstracts the essential elements of the problem into a model, which is then analyzed to yield an optimal solution for implementation. The mathematical details and the specific techniques used to build and analyze these models can be quite sophisticated and are addressed elsewhere in this handbook; the emphasis of this chapter is on the approach.

A case control study was conducted among women working in three sectors: Health, Personal services and Agriculture, and Manufacturing industries. Two hundred and twenty-seven (227) stillbirths aged 20 weeks of gestation or more, were matched to two hundred and twenty-seven (227) livebirths, for mother's age, gravidity and socio-economic status.

The author proposes that ergonomic factors could be a confounder of the association between stillbirth and exposure to pesticides/germicides or metals. A study looking more closely at the association between stillbirth and ergonomic factors is therefore suggested.
