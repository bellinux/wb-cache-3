5|$|During his {{backstage}} theatre job, Sellers began practising {{on a set}} <b>of</b> <b>drums</b> {{that belonged}} to the band Joe Daniels and his Hot Shots. Daniels noticed his efforts and gave him practical instructions. The instrument greatly suited Sellers's temperament and artistic skills. Spike Milligan later noted that Sellers was very proficient on the drums and might have remained a jazz drummer, had he lacked his skills in mimicry and improvisation.|$|E
5|$|Nelson {{featured}} {{arrangements of}} acoustic guitar, accompanied by piano, played by his sister, Bobbie, as well complementary arrangements <b>of</b> <b>drums,</b> harmonica and mandolin. The sparsely instrumented acoustic arrangements caused Columbia directors {{to doubt the}} wisdom of releasing the album as presented, feeling it was under-produced {{and no more than}} a demo. However, Nelson had complete creative control, and it was released without any further modifications.|$|E

50|$|Mobile Drum Handler is a {{stand alone}} type <b>of</b> <b>drum</b> handler. Unlike the {{forklift}} attachments, mobile drum handlers have built in wheels {{so you can}} easily maneuver it anywhere. This type <b>of</b> <b>drum</b> handlers is made with stainless steel and also has a wide heavy duty jaw that can grip the top rim <b>of</b> standard <b>drums.</b> There are two types <b>of</b> mobile <b>drum</b> handler; manual and hydraulic powered. Drum dollies, palletizer, vertical lift pourer and spotter are good examples <b>of</b> mobile <b>drum</b> handler.|$|R

5|$|The {{music of}} Chad {{includes}} {{a number of}} unusual instruments such as the kinde, a type of bow harp; the kakaki, a long tin horn; and the hu hu, a stringed instrument that uses calabashes as loudspeakers. Other instruments and their combinations are more linked to specific ethnic groups: the Sara prefer whistles, balafones, harps and kodjo drums; and the Kanembu combine the sounds <b>of</b> <b>drums</b> with those of flute-like instruments.|$|E
5|$|Election Special is an American {{roots and}} blues rock album of protest songs with music {{characterized}} by upbeat melodies, simple instrumentation, and sparse arrangements. Cooder played {{all of the}} instruments, including bass, guitar, and mandolin, with the exception <b>of</b> <b>drums</b> by his son Joachim. A deeply political album, it expands on the socio-political musings and current event topics of Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Down with forthright, satirical lyrics and song-form vignettes. Cooder's songwriting exhibits liberal and populist sentiments and draws on older musical sources such as broadside ballads and country blues.|$|E
5|$|India {{experienced}} similar {{development to}} China in the Middle Ages; however, stringed instruments developed differently as they accommodated {{different styles of}} music. While stringed instruments of China were designed to produce precise tones capable of matching the tones of chimes, stringed instruments of India were considerably more flexible. This flexibility suited the slides and tremolos of Hindu music. Rhythm was of paramount importance in Indian music of the time, {{as evidenced by the}} frequent depiction <b>of</b> <b>drums</b> in reliefs dating to the Middle Ages. The emphasis on rhythm is an aspect native to Indian music. Historians divide the development of musical instruments in medieval India between pre-Islamic and Islamic periods due to the different influence each period provided.|$|E

5|$|Slaveowners {{and state}} governments tried to prevent slaves from making or playing musical {{instruments}} because of the use <b>of</b> <b>drums</b> to signal the Stono Rebellion in 1739. Blassingame, however, {{points out that in}} spite of restrictions, slaves were able to build a strong musical tradition drawing on their African heritage. Music, songs, and dances were similar to those performed or played in Africa. Instruments reproduced by slaves include drums, three-stringed banjos, gourd rattles, and mandolins.|$|E
5|$|The Turkish janissaries {{military}} corps {{had included}} since the 14th century bands called mehter or mehterân which, {{like many other}} earlier military bands in Asia featured a high proportion <b>of</b> <b>drums,</b> cymbals, and gongs, along with trumpets and shawms. The high level of noise was pertinent to their function of playing on the battlefield to inspire the soldiers. The focus in these bands was on percussion. A full mehterân could include several bass drums, multiple pairs of cymbals, small kettledrums, triangles, tambourines, and one or more Turkish crescents.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{of musical}} {{instruments}} in use by early civilizations of India is almost completely lacking, {{making it impossible}} to reliably attribute instruments to the Munda and Dravidian language-speaking cultures that first settled the area. Rather, the history of musical instruments in the area begins with the Indus Valley Civilization that emerged around 3000 BC. Various rattles and whistles found among excavated artifacts are the only physical evidence of musical instruments. A clay statuette indicates the use <b>of</b> <b>drums,</b> and examination of the Indus script has also revealed representations of vertical arched harps identical in design to those depicted in Sumerian artifacts. This discovery is among many indications that the Indus Valley and Sumerian cultures maintained cultural contact. Subsequent developments in musical instruments in India occurred with the Rigveda, or hymns. These songs used various drums, shell trumpets, harps, and flutes. Other prominent instruments in use during the early centuries AD were the snake charmer's double clarinet, bagpipes, barrel drums, cross flutes, and short lutes. In all, India had no unique musical instruments until the Middle Ages.|$|E

50|$|A foot drum is {{any type}} <b>of</b> <b>drum</b> that is {{typically}} played by striking {{it with the}} bare foot or pedal and beater combination. The most common type <b>of</b> foot <b>drum</b> is the kick drum or bass <b>drum</b> <b>of</b> a <b>drum</b> set or trap kit, which consists of a deep cylindrical shell with drumheads attached to both ends.|$|R

5|$|In the Jamiltepec {{region of}} Mexico, there exists {{perhaps the most}} {{colorful}} version {{of that kind of}} dance, the Chareos dance. It represents a battle between Moors, led by Pilate, and Christians, led by James, the apostle. Sixteen male dancers take part and the dancer who plays the part of James appears as a horse rider and wears a costume that incorporates a white horse. The dancers wear ostrich feathers on their heads, a peacock feather at the front, white cotton square over their shoulders, velvet trousers decorated with gold brocade over white cotton pants and carry a machete. In addition, the leader has a hat with a small mirror and a white feather headdress. Two men at the front carry two red flags and two white flags, red symbolizing the blood spilt by James' soldiers and white symbolizing the peace that reigned after the Christian victory. The sounds <b>of</b> <b>drums</b> and flutes accompany the dance. These dances that pit Christian against Moor are almost certainly Christianized versions of earlier, pre-Cortez dances that ritualized the battle between the tiger and the eagle.|$|E
5|$|Scottish {{music is}} a {{significant}} aspect of the nation's culture, with both traditional and modern influences. A famous traditional Scottish instrument is the Great Highland Bagpipe, a wind instrument consisting of three drones and a melody pipe (called the chanter), which are fed continuously by a reservoir of air in a bag. Bagpipe bands, featuring bagpipes and various types <b>of</b> <b>drums,</b> and showcasing Scottish music styles while creating new ones, have spread throughout the world. The clàrsach (harp), fiddle and accordion are also traditional Scottish instruments, the latter two heavily featured in Scottish country dance bands. There are many successful Scottish bands and individual artists in varying styles including Annie Lennox, Amy Macdonald, Runrig, Boards of Canada, Cocteau Twins, Deacon Blue, Franz Ferdinand, Susan Boyle, Emeli Sandé, Texas, The View, The Fratellis, Twin Atlantic and Biffy Clyro. Other Scottish musicians include Shirley Manson, Paolo Nutini and Calvin Harris.|$|E
5|$|The Moldavians {{made the}} first move by sending musicians {{to the middle of}} the valley. The sound <b>of</b> <b>drums</b> and bugles made Suleiman think that the entire Moldavian army awaited him there. Instead, the centre of the valley held the Székely forces and the Moldavian {{professional}} army, which were ordered to make a slow retreat when they encountered the enemy. Suleiman ordered his troops to advance and, when they made enough progress, the Moldavian artillery started to fire, followed by archers and handgunners firing from three different directions. The archers could not see the enemy for the fog, and, instead, had to follow the noise of their footsteps. The Moldavian light cavalry then helped to lure the Ottoman troops into the valley by making hit-and-run attacks. Ottoman cavalry tried to cross the wooden bridge, causing it to collapse. Those Ottoman soldiers who had managed to survive the attacks from the artillery and the archers, and who did not get caught in the marshes, had to confront the Moldavian army, together with the Székely soldiers further up the valley. The 5,000 Székely soldiers were successful in repelling the 7,000 Ottoman infantrymen. Thereafter, they made a slow retreat, as instructed by Stephen, but were later routed by the Ottoman sipahi, while the remaining Ottoman infantry attacked the Moldavian flanks.|$|E
