5|$|Under the synthesis, debates {{have become}} less ideological and more methodological. Business cycle modelers {{can be broken}} into two camps: those in favor of {{calibration}} and those in favor of estimation. When models are calibrated, the modeler selects parameter values based on other studies or casual empirical observation. Instead of using statistical diagnostics to evaluate models, the model's <b>operating</b> <b>characteristics</b> determine {{the quality of the}} model. Kydland and Prescott (1982) offered no formal evaluation of their model, but noted how variables like hours worked did not match real data well while the variances of other elements of the model did. When estimation methods are used, models are evaluated based on standard statistical goodness of fit criteria. Calibration is generally associated with real business cycle modelers of the new classical school, but methodological differences cut across ideology. While Lucas, Prescott, and Kydland are calibration advocates, another prominent new classical, Sargent, favors estimation.|$|E

40|$|The aims of {{the present}} study were to {{evaluate}} the predictive value of the platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio for peritoneal metastasis in patients with gastric cancer and to construct an available preoperative prediction system for peritoneal metastasis. A total of 1080 patients with gastric cancer were enrolled in our study. The preoperative platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio and other serum markers and objective clinical tumor characteristics were evaluated by receiver <b>operating</b> <b>characteristic</b> curves. A logistic analysis was performed to determine the independent predictive indicators of peritoneal metastasis. A prediction system that included the independent predictive indicators was constructed and evaluated by receiver <b>operating</b> <b>characteristic</b> curves. Based on the receiver <b>operating</b> <b>characteristic</b> curves, the ideal platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio cutoff value to predict peritoneal metastasis was 131. 00. The logistic analysis showed that the platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio was an independent indicator to predict peritoneal metastasis. The area under the receiver <b>operating</b> <b>characteristic</b> curve was 0. 599. When integrating all independent indicators (i. e., platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, invasion depth, lymphatic invasion, pathological type), the prediction system more reliably predicted peritoneal metastasis with a higher area under the receiver <b>operating</b> <b>characteristic</b> curve (0. 769). The preoperative platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio was an indicator {{that could be used to}} predict peritoneal metastasis.

25|$|Most {{light rail}} {{systems in the}} United States are limited by demand rather than {{capacity}} (by and large, most North American LRT systems carry fewer than 4,000 persons per hour per direction), but Boston's and San Francisco's light rail lines carry 9,600 and 13,100 passengers per hour per track during rush hour. Elsewhere in North America, the Calgary C-Train and Monterrey Metro have higher light rail ridership than Boston or San Francisco. Systems outside North America often have much higher passenger volumes. The Manila Light Rail Transit System {{is one of the}} highest capacity ones, having been upgraded in a series of expansions to handle 40,000 passengers per hour per direction, and having carried as many as 582,989 passengers in a single day on its Line 1. It achieves this volume by running four-car trains with a capacity of up to 1,350 passengers each at a frequency of up to 30 trains per hour. However, the Manila light rail system has full grade separation and as a result has many of the <b>operating</b> <b>characteristics</b> of a metro system rather than a light rail system. A capacity of 1,350 passengers per train is more similar to heavy rail than light rail.|$|E
500|$|Submarines {{were the}} [...] "silent service"—in terms of <b>operating</b> <b>characteristics</b> and the closed-mouth {{preferences}} of the submariners. Strategists had, however, been looking into this new type of warship, influenced {{in large part by}} Germany's nearly successful U-boat campaign. As early as 1912, Lieutenant Chester Nimitz had argued for long-range submarines to accompany the fleet to scout the enemy's location. The new head of the Submarine Section in 1919 was Captain Thomas Hart, who argued that submarines could win the next war: [...] "There is no quicker or more effective method of defeating Japan than the cutting of her sea communications." [...] However Hart was astonished to discover how backward American submarines were compared to captured German U-boats, and how unready they were for their mission. The public supported submarines for their coastal protection mission; they would presumably intercept enemy fleets approaching San Francisco or New York. The Navy realized it was a mission that isolationists in Congress would fund, but it was not actually serious. Old-line admirals said the mission of the subs ought to be as eyes of the battle fleet, and as assistants in battle. That was unfeasible since even on the surface submarines could not move faster than 20 knots, far slower than the 30 knot main warships. The young commanders were organized into a [...] "Submarine Officers' Conference" [...] in 1926. They argued they were best suited for the commerce raiding that had been the forte of the U-boats. They therefore redesigned their new boats along German lines, and added the new requirement that they be capable of sailing alone for 7,500 miles on a 75-day mission. Unrestricted submarine warfare had led to war with Germany in 1917, and was still vigorously condemned both by public opinion and by treaties, including the London Treaty of 1930. Nevertheless, the submariners planned a role in unrestricted warfare against Japanese merchant ships, transports and oil tankers. The Navy kept its plans secret from civilians. It was an admiral, not President Roosevelt, who within hours of the Pearl Harbor attack, ordered unrestricted warfare against any enemy ship anywhere in the Pacific.|$|E

40|$|With the {{development}} of sensors, {{it is possible to}} embed many sensors within a certain space, which makes the monitor and alarm system with multisensor possible. There are two important parameters in a monitor and alarm system, namely, the false alarm rate and the missed alarm rate. In this work, a method for selecting optimal number of sensors in the sensor array is presented to improve the credibility. The influence factors of the weights and the false alarm rate and the missed alarm rate of one sensor and total number of sensors are discussed. An experimental setup was developed. The monitoring methods of common strategies and the proposed optimal number of sensors strategy are compared graphically by the receiver <b>operating</b> <b>characteristic</b> curves and the area under receiver <b>operating</b> <b>characteristic</b> curve values. The receiver <b>operating</b> <b>characteristic</b> curves graphically prove that the optimal number of sensors’ method presents the best performance, and it is shown that the optimal number of sensors’ method has the highest area under receiver <b>operating</b> <b>characteristic</b> value (0. 9631).

40|$|The {{receiver}} <b>operating</b> <b>characteristic</b> {{curve is}} a commonly used tool for evaluating biomarker usefulness in clinical diagnosis of disease. Frequently, biomarkers being assessed have immeasurable or unreportable samples below some limit of detection.

Several correction methods are suggested {{in the areas of}} mean estimation and testing but nothing regarding the receiver <b>operating</b> <b>characteristic</b> curve or its summary measures. In this paper, the authors show that replacement values below the limit of detection, including those suggested, result in the same biased area under the curve when properly accounted for, but they also provide guidance on the usefulness of these values in limited situations. The authors demonstrate maximum likelihood techniques leading to asymptot-ically unbiased estimators of the area under the curve for both normally and gamma distributed biomarker levels. Confidence intervals are proposed, the coverage probability of which is scrutinized by simulation study.
