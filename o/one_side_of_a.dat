5|$|Areas along Fishing Creek contain pools {{followed}} by riffles, which are further {{followed by}} more pools. This configuration of pools and riffles creates an ideal situation for fly-fishing. The {{lower part of}} the creek forms <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> triangle of low-lying land in western Bloomsburg, which floods severely during heavy rains.|$|E
5|$|The ulnar styloid process (a {{projection}} on the ulna, one of {{the bones}} of the forearm, where it meets the wrist) is not as hooked as in other lorisids, according to Schwartz, which Groves suggests may indicate that the wrist is more mobile. Another alleged diagnostic feature is the presence of an entepicondylar foramen (an opening near the distal, or far, end of the bone) on the humerus (upper arm bone); however, Sarmiento found this feature in 4 out of 11 specimens, and on <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fifth, and Stump noted that the foramen occurred in specimens from across the potto's range.|$|E
5|$|Snowboarding is a {{sport that}} has been contested at the Winter Olympic Games since the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan. Snowboarding was one of five new sports or {{disciplines}} added to the Winter Olympic programme between 1992 and 2002, and {{was the only one}} not to have been a previous medal or demonstration event. In 1998, four events, two for men and two for women, were held in two specialities: the giant slalom, a downhill event similar to giant slalom skiing; and the half-pipe, in which competitors perform tricks while going from <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> semi-circular ditch to the other. Canadian Ross Rebagliati won the men's giant slalom and became the first athlete to win a gold medal in snowboarding. Rebagliati was briefly stripped of his medal by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) after testing positive for marijuana. However, the IOC's decision was reverted following an appeal from the Canadian Olympic Association. For the 2002 Winter Olympics, the giant slalom was dropped in favour of the parallel giant slalom, an event that involves head-to-head racing. In 2006, a third event, the snowboard cross, was held for the first time. In this event, competitors race against each other down a course with jumps, beams and other obstacles.|$|E

5|$|The Mary Rose {{represented}} a transitional ship design in naval warfare. Since ancient times, war at sea had been fought {{much like that}} on land: with melee weapons and bows and arrows, but on floating wooden platforms rather than battlefields. Though the introduction of guns was a significant change, it only slowly changed the dynamics of ship-to-ship combat. As guns became heavier and able to take more powerful gunpowder charges, {{they needed to be}} placed lower in the ship, closer to the water line. Gunports cut in the hull of ships had been introduced as early as 1501, only about a decade before the Mary Rose was built. This made broadsides, coordinated volleys from all the guns on <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> ship, possible {{for the first time in}} history, at least in theory. Naval tactics throughout the 16th century and well into the 17th century focused on countering the oar-powered galleys that were armed with heavy guns in the bow, facing forwards, which were aimed by turning the entire ship against its target. Combined with inefficient gunpowder and the difficulties inherent in firing accurately from moving platforms, this meant that boarding remained the primary tactic for decisive victory throughout the 16th century.|$|E

25|$|Much {{confusion}} about arguments from ignorance {{can be caused}} when <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> debate forgets that we often possess evidence of absence in practice. However, the confusion can be avoided by not partaking in a logical debate.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We provide <b>a</b> {{strengthening}} <b>of</b> <b>an</b> elementary {{technique in}} geometric measure theory. Given an s-set S Rn, {{in the language}} of tangent measures, this technique establishes the existence of tangent measures to the measure HsbS on <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> (n ¡ 1) -plane. If S is purely unrecti¯able or of dimension less than n ¡ 1, our strengthening consists of being able to ¯nd tangent measures on <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> (n ¡ 1) -plane containing <b>a</b> vector <b>of</b> our choice. We give <b>an</b> application <b>of</b> this result to the problem of characterising removable sets for harmonic functions. 1...|$|R
50|$|Another {{important}} {{technique is}} {{to work through the}} range of possibilities in open inequalities. <b>A</b> value on <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> inequality determines others, which then can be worked through the puzzle until a contradiction is reached and the first value is excluded.|$|R

25|$|The {{town was}} garrisoned {{by a few}} {{thousand}} irregulars (kasidars), the regular troops of Afghan Turkestan being cantoned at Takhtapul, near Mazari Sharif. The gardens to the north-east contained a caravanserai that formed <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> courtyard, which was shaded {{by a group of}} chenar trees Platanus orientalis.|$|E
25|$|Tree roots usually grow {{to three}} times the {{diameter}} of the branch spread, only half of which lie underneath the trunk and canopy. The roots from <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tree usually supply nutrients to the foliage on the same side. Some families however, such as Sapindaceae (the maple family), show no correlation between root location and where the root supplies nutrients on the plant.|$|E

25|$|Once {{the layers}} have been quilted, the edges must be {{finished}} and bound. There {{are many different}} ways to bind a quilt. One of the simplest involves sewing <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> strip of fabric to the front side of the quilt, {{through all of the}} layers of fabric, then folding the strip over to {{the back side of the}} fabric and hand stitching the binding closed.|$|E
25|$|In {{any given}} country, rail traffic {{generally}} runs to <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> double-track line, {{not always the}} same side as road traffic. Thus in Belgium, China, France (apart from the former German Alsace and Lorraine), Sweden, Switzerland and Italy for example, the railways use left-hand running, while the roads use right-hand running. In countries such as Indonesia, it is the reverse (right-hand running for railways and left-hand running for roads).|$|E
25|$|The long {{end of the}} 'Z' ambush {{was located}} on <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> trail or road {{enabling}} the ambushers to employ both enfilading and flanking fire. It was also placed to neutralize attempts to flank the ambush from nearly every direction. Ambushing units deployed along the two short ends of the 'Z' could fire in either direction. The 'Z' ambush was dangerous to ambushers because ambush elements could easily fire into each other.|$|E

25|$|One-tailed {{tests are}} used for {{asymmetric}} distributions that have a single tail, such as the chi-squared distribution, which are common in measuring goodness-of-fit, or for <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> distribution that has two tails, such as the normal distribution, which is common in estimating location; this corresponds to specifying a direction. Two-tailed tests are only applicable when there are two tails, {{such as in the}} normal distribution, and correspond to considering either direction significant.|$|E
25|$|Some analysts {{think that}} the ICC {{indictment}} is counterproductive and harms the peace process. Only days after the ICC indictment, al-Bashir expelled 13 international aid organizations from Darfur and disbanded three domestic aid organizations. In {{the aftermath of the}} expulsions, conditions in the displaced camps deteriorated. Previous ICC indictments, such as the arrest warrants of the LRA leadership in the ongoing war in northern Uganda, were also accused of harming peace processes by criminalizing <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> war.|$|E
25|$|Pedestrians {{must often}} cross from <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{road to the}} other, {{and in doing so}} may come into the way of {{vehicles}} traveling on the road. In many places pedestrians are entirely left to look after themselves, that is, they must observe the road and cross when they can see that no traffic will threaten them. Busier cities usually provide pedestrian crossings, which are strips of the road where pedestrians are expected to cross.|$|E

25|$|The {{subsequent}} decades {{saw more}} elaborate attempts to interpret eye movement, including {{a claim that}} meaningful text requires fewer fixations to read than random strings of letters. In 1879, the French ophthalmologist Louis Émile Javal used a mirror on <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> page to observe eye movement in silent reading, {{and found that it}} involves a succession of discontinuous individual movements for which he coined the term saccades. In 1898, Erdmann & Dodge used a hand-mirror to estimate average fixation duration and saccade length with surprising accuracy.|$|E
25|$|There is an {{extended}} {{format of the}} ZIP Code known as the ZIP+4, which contains the basic five-digit ZIP Code, followed by a hyphen and four additional digits. These digits identify a specific delivery route, such as <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> building, a group of apartments, or several floors of a large office building. Although using the ZIP+4 offers higher accuracy, addressing redundancy, and sorting efficiency within the USPS, it is optional and not widely used by the general public. It is primarily only used by business mailers.|$|E
