5|$|Sylvester James {{was born}} on September 6, 1947 in the Watts {{district}} of Los Angeles, California, into a middle-class family. His mother, Letha Weaver, had been raised near Palestine, Arkansas into a relatively wealthy African-American family who owned their own farmland. Letha's biological mother, Gertha Weaver, was unmarried and too sickly {{to care for her}} child, so Gertha's sister Julia, known to the family as JuJu, became Letha's adoptive mother. In the late 1930s, Julia and her husband took part in the Great Migration <b>of</b> <b>African-Americans</b> out of the Southern United States, relocating to Watts.|$|E
40|$|The New Red Negro surveys African-American poetry {{from the}} onset of the Depression to {{the early days of the}} Cold War. It {{considers}} the relationship between the thematic and formal choices <b>of</b> <b>African-American</b> poets and organized ideology from the proletarian early 1930 s to the neo-modernist late 1940 s. This study examines poetry by writers across the spectrum: canonical, less well-known, and virtually unknown. The ideology of the Communist Left as particularly expressed through cultural institutions of the literary Left significantly influenced the shape <b>of</b> <b>African-American</b> poetry in the 1930 s and 40 s, as well as the content. One result of this engagement <b>of</b> <b>African-American</b> writers with the organized Left was a pronounced tendency to regard the re-created folk or street voice as the authentic voice [...] and subject [...] <b>of</b> <b>African-American</b> poetry. Furthermore, a masculinist rhetoric was crucial to the re-creation of this folk voice. This unstable yoking of cultural nationalism, integrationism, and internationalism within a construct of class struggle helped to shape a new relationship <b>of</b> <b>African-American</b> poetry to vernacular African-American culture. This relationship included the representation <b>of</b> <b>African-American</b> working class and rural folk life and its cultural products ostensibly from the mass perspective. It also included the dissemination of urban forms <b>of</b> <b>African-American</b> popular culture, often resulting in mixed media high- low hybrids...|$|R
25|$|What {{is today}} broadly called Afrocentrism evolved {{out of the}} work <b>of</b> <b>African-American</b> intellectuals {{in the late nineteenth}} and early twentieth centuries, but flowered into its modern form due to the {{activism}} <b>of</b> <b>African-American</b> intellectuals in the U.S. Civil Rights Movement and in the development <b>of</b> <b>African-American</b> Studies programs in universities. In strict terms Afrocentrism, as a distinct academic ideology, reached its peak in the 1980s and 1990s. Today it is primarily associated with Molefi Asante.|$|R

5|$|The {{construction}} of the New York City Subway, which opened in 1904, helped bind the new city together, as did additional bridges to Brooklyn. In the 1920s Manhattan experienced large arrivals <b>of</b> <b>African-Americans</b> {{as part of the}} Great Migration from the southern United States, and the Harlem Renaissance, part of a larger boom time in the Prohibition era that included new skyscrapers competing for the skyline. New York City became the most populous city in the world in 1925, overtaking London, which had reigned for a century. Manhattan's majority white ethnic group declined from 98.7% in 1900 to 58.3% by 1990.|$|E

Progressives sought to reform corrupt political practices of the ruling Martin machine and to regulate railroads and big corporations. Martin delegates agreed to restrict suffrage <b>of</b> <b>African-Americans</b> and illiterate whites, and a State Corporation Commission was established. When the railroads challenged the State Corporation Commission's constitutionality on the grounds it violated separation of powers, the commission was upheld in the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals.|$|E

5|$|Although {{strongly}} {{urged by}} moderates in Congress {{to sign the}} bill, President Andrew Johnson vetoed it on March 27, 1866. In his veto message, he objected to the measure because it conferred citizenship on the freedmen {{at a time when}} 11 out of 36 states were unrepresented in the Congress, and that it discriminated in favor <b>of</b> <b>African-Americans</b> and against whites. Three weeks later, Johnson's veto was overridden and the measure became law. Despite this victory, even some Republicans who had supported the goals of the Civil Rights Act began to doubt that Congress really possessed constitutional power to turn those goals into laws. The experience also encouraged both radical and moderate Republicans to seek Constitutional guarantees for black rights, rather than relying on temporary political majorities.|$|E
5|$|However, this {{resurgence}} {{soon became}} commodified as a trend, while actual awareness within the African-American community was limited and ineffectual to {{issues such as}} drug dealing and the prevalence of liquor stores in such neighborhoods. Public Enemy responded to this and other deep-rooted problems of Black America on their following album, Apocalypse 91... The Enemy Strikes Black (1991), which featured more critical assessments <b>of</b> <b>African-Americans,</b> denouncing Black drug dealers who donned Afrocentric merchandise, hip hop artists who promoted malt liquor, black radio stations for lacking significant airplay to hip hop, and even the Africans {{at the onset of}} the Atlantic slave trade for lacking unity.|$|E

5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1914, Sledd {{resigned}} the presidency of Southern University and returned to Emory College, by then renamed Emory University and relocated to its new main campus in northeast Atlanta, as the first Professor of Greek and New Testament Literature at the Candler School of Theology, the newly established seminary of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South. Sledd became well known {{as a professor of}} Greek, Latin and New Testament studies at Candler, and was the author of several scholarly books on New Testament subjects, including Saint Mark's Life of Jesus (1927), The Bibles of the Churches (1930) and His Witnesses: A Study of the Book of Acts (1935). He was selected {{to be a member of}} the American Standard Bible Committee, which was preparing a revision of the American Standard Version of the Bible. He continued to advocate internal Methodist reform and an end to racial violence, and his teaching inspired a generation of his Candler theology students to act as change agents within the Methodist Episcopal Church, South. Many of his former students became Methodist ministers who returned to their congregations and annual conferences to work for better treatment <b>of</b> <b>African-Americans,</b> helping the Southern Methodist church to evolve from a mainstay of theological and racial intransigence to an agent for social change and doctrinal reform.|$|E
5|$|Post {{election}} {{polls showed}} that Humphrey lost the white vote with 38%, nine points behind Nixon, but won the nonwhite vote solidly, 85% to 12%, including 97% <b>of</b> <b>African-Americans.</b> African-Americans favored Humphrey {{because of his}} record on civil rights, and their desire to quickly end the war in Vietnam, where blacks were overrepresented. The racial divide in the election had widened since 1964, and was attributed to civil rights protests and race riots. Humphrey won 45% of the female vote, two points ahead of Nixon, but lost to the Republican among males, 41% to 43%. Voters with only a grade school education supported Humphrey 52% to 33% over Nixon, while Nixon won among both those with no higher education than high school (43% to 42%) and those who graduated from college (54% to 37%). Occupation demographics mirrored these numbers with manual-labor workers supporting Humphrey 50% to 37%, and with white-collar (47% to 41%) and professionals (56% to 34%) favoring Nixon. Humphrey won among young voters (under 30 years old) by 47% to 38%, and also edged Nixon among those between 30 and 49 years, with 44% to 41%. Nixon won among voters over 50 years, 47% to 41%. Catholics backed Humphrey with 59%, twelve points ahead of Nixon, but Protestants favored Nixon, 49% to 35%. Humphrey lost the Independent vote 31% to 44%, with 25% going to Wallace, and won a lower percentage among Democrats (74%) than Nixon won among Republicans (86%). This discrepancy {{was connected to the}} tough Democratic primary election that caused some former McCarthy, Kennedy or McGovern supporters to vote for Nixon or Wallace as a protest.|$|E
