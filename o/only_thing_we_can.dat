500|$|Arsenal {{opened their}} Champions League {{campaign}} with a 3–0 defeat against Inter Milan. Goals from Julio Ricardo Cruz, Andy van der Meyde and Obafemi Martins {{all in the}} first half extended Arsenal's run of six home games in the competition without a win. Wenger said afterwards: [...] "We can complain and cry the whole night but that will not change the result. The <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> do is to respond." [...] The team, without Campbell and Vieira, earned a draw away to Lokomotiv Moscow, but remained bottom of the group. Arsenal lost to Dynamo Kyiv in late October; Wenger's decision to shift from his preferred 4–4–2 formation caused the team to play more narrow than usual. Cole scored the winning goal in the reverse fixture at Highbury. A cross by Wiltord was flicked on by Henry in the direction of an incoming Cole, who dived to head the ball past goalkeeper Oleksandr Shovkovskiy.|$|E
500|$|Metalholic said 'I’m back…” [...] I can’t {{think of}} a more {{appropriate}} way to flow into the second track “Tragic Magic.” [...] Ronnie Radke is most definitely back {{and he is not}} afraid to tell you so.' This fairly slow tempo song obviously takes a few jabs at Radke’s former band Escape the Fate, but overall is a solid melodic song, [...] The third track “The Drug in Me is You” was the second single and the band’s first video and might I add a very entertaining video. “The Drug in Me is You,” is a nicely constructed musical performance that is just flat out catchy. [...] To me the song is about something most people can relate to, the battle you have with yourself, with your morality, with your demons. [...] We all know that we can be our own worst enemy and the only person that you truly have to blame in many instances is yourself. [...] “Trying to consume, the drug in me is you and I’m so high on misery can’t you see,” evokes the feeling that you are your own drug, the creator of your misery and if you need to point fingers at someone try looking in the mirror first. [...] “If we are born to die and we all die to live, then what’s the point of living life if life just contradicts?” [...] Questions we all ask when we pick ourselves up off the floor and do the <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> do, try again. [...] Life is what you make of it, if you have lost yourself, it is up to you to find your way again. [...] I got all profound there for a second, it happens.|$|E

2500|$|At the Coca-Cola 600 a week later, Busch started {{second on}} the outside of the front row. Despite having to change a battery late in the race, he led eight laps and he still {{finished}} in third place, the first time he'd finished in the top three since June 2012 at Sonoma. When interviewed, he responded, [...] "Yeah, a top-five is great. To be up front, to lead laps, that's what it's all about. So we'll get these little hiccups polished up and continue plugging forward. That's the <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> do, is learn from what exactly happened -- was it a cable issue, a battery that was dead, was the alternator not charging? To show our strength tonight, to finish third, we'll take it. I think that's what needs to be said. The Furniture Row team was fast, and we didn't quite have a perfect night, and we brought it home third." ...|$|E

40|$|Counting is {{something}} we learn so early in life that we tend to dismiss it as a trivial skill, beneath the notice of mathematics. The recent U. S. presidential election suggests otherwise. Although most of the vote-counting controversies last fall concerned what to count rather than how to count, the counting process itself also proved to be imprecise and unreliable. Counting and recounting the same batch of ballots seldom gave the same total twice. Evidently, counting is not the utterly deterministic procedure we take it to be. There is some wiggle and wobble in it. And ballots are not the <b>only</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> lose count of. The Census Bureau has reported the U. S. population as 281, 421, 906, but no one believe...|$|R

5000|$|The missing word in line 6 between [...] "I am your supplicant" [...] and [...] "have pity" [...] (here reconstructed as Phil?a) is carved at {{the edge}} of the tablet and the <b>only</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> read of it are that it is a short word that ends in-AN. [...] "PHILAN" [...] is a likely reconstruction, but by no means the only one possible. If true, the word [...] "PHILAN" [...] could equally well be either the {{personal}} name [...] "Phila" [...] or the feminine adjective [...] "phila", [...] "friend" [...] or [...] "dear one". In the latter case, an alternative reading of line 6 would be: [...] "Have pity on your dear one, dear demons". In the former case, a personal name would be perfectly placed but, as the name of the person who wrote the curse is not mentioned elsewhere, it is impossible to know with certainty what the missing word is.|$|R

50|$|Schopenhauer {{disagreed}} with Kant's critics {{and stated that}} it is absurd to assume that phenomena have no basis.

6000|$|As {{the young}} people looked, listened, and took in the scene, they felt as if some mysterious power had changed their playmate from a {{creature}} like themselves {{into a sort of}} saint or hero for them to look up to, and imitate if they could. [...] "What has he done, to be so loved, praised, and mourned?" [...] they thought, with a tender sort of wonder; and the answer seemed to come to them as never before, for never had they been brought so near the solemn truth of life and death. [...] "It was not what he did but what he was that made him so beloved.

But don't ever think either that capitalists are a peculiar race of fiends, different from anarchists or scrubwomen, or that we'll have a millennium about next election. We've got to be anthropological in our view. It's taken the human race about five hundred thousand years to get where it is, and presumably it will take quite a few thousand more to become scientific or even to understand the need of scientific conduct of everything. I'm not at all sure that there's any higher wisdom than doing a day's work, and hoping the Subway will be a little less crowded next year, and in voting for the best possible man, and then forgetting all the Weltschmertz, and going to an opera.
