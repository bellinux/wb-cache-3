30|$|The number <b>of</b> <b>publications</b> <b>of</b> {{an author}} {{has also been}} {{considered}} in the formula. However it may happen that an author may have a large number <b>of</b> <b>publications</b> but with few citations, and these citations are in journals with a small impact factor, whilst another author may have a smaller number <b>of</b> <b>publications</b> with {{a high number of}} citations published in journals with high impact factors, which should be more relevant in the ranking formula. For each author we count the number <b>of</b> <b>publications</b> available. The authors with more than fifty publications get a number <b>of</b> <b>publications</b> <b>of</b> fifty. We believe that fifty is a good number <b>of</b> <b>publications</b> for a good author. The authors with a lower number <b>of</b> <b>publications</b> are not immediately discarded but are ranked lower. However the most common case is paper’s with more than one author. In this case, we consider the highest number <b>of</b> <b>publications.</b> As we do not disambiguate the author’s name, there is a slight chance that authors with the same name induce an error in the effective number <b>of</b> <b>publications</b> <b>of</b> a particular author.|$|R
