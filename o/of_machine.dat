These were most often given verbally by the observer, after the pilot landed near Chauvel's headquarters, as the aircraft did not at this time have wireless communication.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{contribution}} {{is dealing with}} the influence of high speed parameters on the quality <b>of</b> <b>machined</b> surface. In general the principle of high speed cutting lies in achieving faster machine times with concurrent increase in accuracy and quality <b>of</b> the <b>machined</b> areas in largely irregular, mathematically hard to define shapes. High speed machining is a highly effective method <b>of</b> <b>machining</b> with the following goals: increasing <b>of</b> <b>machining</b> productivity, increasing <b>of</b> quality <b>of</b> the <b>machined</b> surface, improving <b>of</b> <b>machining</b> economy, improving <b>of</b> ecological aspects <b>of</b> <b>machining.</b> This article is based on an experiment performed by the Department <b>of</b> <b>Machining</b> and Assembly <b>of</b> the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering of VŠB-Technical University of Ostrava.

5|$|Eleven Ottoman {{infantry}} divisions {{had been}} forced to retire, suffering 28,443 casualties; some 12,000 prisoners were captured, 100 guns, and scores <b>of</b> <b>machine</b> guns were also captured. Now the Ottoman Army needed to deploy troops from other theatres to make up for these significant losses. On 15 December the Ottoman 2nd Caucasian Cavalry Division arrived in Palestine and became the reserve of the XXII Corps before taking part in the counterattacks of 27 December. The 1st Infantry Division arrived from the Caucasus and moved to Nablus in reserve. A significant consequence of the Ottoman Empire's firm focus on the Levant was that the British recapture of Baghdad and the British offensive in Mesopotamia became more viable and secure.|$|E

5|$|Later in the evening, 1st Battalion, 34th Infantry counterattacked the {{positions}} {{but was unable}} to take them back, in the face <b>of</b> <b>machine</b> gun and small arms fire, and was forced to withdraw by nightfall.

5|$|The 2/1st Machine Gun Battalion {{was formed}} on 14 December 1939, {{as part of}} the Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF). It was raised {{following}} a reorganisation of the 6th Division's infantry battalions, which saw the removal of the machine gun platoons that had previously existed within each battalion and their centralisation in a single unit. Three other machine gun battalions were subsequently raised {{as part of the}} 2nd AIF during the war to support its four infantry divisions. Developed by the British Army, the concept within the Australian Army had its genesis during the Gallipoli Campaign in 1915, when the machine guns assigned to the infantry battalions– initially two and then, later, four– had been grouped together and co-ordinated at brigade level to help compensate for the lack of artillery support. Over {{the course of the war}} on the Western Front, the concept had evolved through the establishment <b>of</b> <b>machine</b> gun companies in 1916 to the establishment <b>of</b> <b>machine</b> gun battalions in 1918. Similar formations had also been established amongst the Australian Light Horse units serving in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. During the inter-war years, the machine gun battalions had been deemed unnecessary. When the Army was reorganised in 1921, they were not re-raised, but in 1937, when the Army looked to expand as fears of war in Europe loomed, four such units were raised within the part-time Militia by converting light horse units and motorising them. When the Second World War broke out, the decision was made to raise several machine gun battalions within the 2nd AIF, one allocated to each division.|$|E

According to various versions, ammunition was low, with 120–250 bullets per rifle, 45 bullets per machine gun, and 50–80 shells per cannon.

5|$|The city of Poznań {{was one of}} {{the largest}} urban and {{industrial}} centers of the People's Republic of Poland. Tensions were growing there, particularly since autumn of 1955.

5|$|As the two P-51s {{crossed over}} the Seine and reached Rambouillet, they sighted a {{formation}} of enemy aircraft. Brief bursts <b>of</b> <b>machine</b> gun fire dispatched four Focke-Wulf Fw 56 trainers—two falling to MacLachlan. Their victims were from JG 105. Gefreiter Walter Seigler was killed in Wrk. Nr. 1868 and Kurt Prager died in Wrk Nr. 2438. Gefreiter Alois Erdl was wounded and the aircraft written off and the fourth was able to force-land safely, damaged. Gefreiter Gotze-Gerd Kuhn was unhurt. They continued their hunt and flying near Bretigny spotted two Ju 88 night fighters or bombers coming into land. MacLachlan destroyed the first and shared the second with Page. Both aircraft belonged to IV./Kampfgeschwader 6 (KG 6—Bomber Wing 6). The pilots—Gefreiter Gerhard Zimmermann and Unteroffizier Karl Brocks—were killed. The Mustangs retreated when the airfield defences retaliated with gunfire. MacLachlan and Page returned at 1,000 feet and crossed the coast south-west of Dieppe and crossed between Brighton and Newhaven upon their return. MacLachlan was awarded a second Bar to his DFC while Page received the DFC.|$|E
5|$|At the north-west {{corner of}} the walls stands Arundel tower, another large drum tower that {{originally}} overlooked a small cliff. South of this is Catchcold tower.

The remains <b>of</b> <b>machine</b> gun mountings fitted to the tower in 1941 can still be seen. The Arcades form part of the surviving west walls and are a unique feature in England; their closest architectural equivalent are in Rouen, France. The West Gate still stands three storeys high and was originally defended by two portcullises; the windows {{on the west side of}} the gate are the original medieval designs. Along the south side of the walls one of the twin towers protecting the South Gate still stands, largely intact.|$|E
5|$|By 1918, {{the number}} of front line {{infantry}} within the British Army in France had decreased, leading to a manpower crisis. In an attempt to consolidate manpower and {{to increase the number}} <b>of</b> <b>machine</b> guns and artillery support available to the infantry, {{the number of}} battalions in a division was cut from twelve to nine. This had the effect of reducing the establishment of a division from 18,825 men to 16,035. In addition, to ease reinforcement, an attempt was made to consolidate as many battalions from the same regiment within the same brigade. These changes impacted the division, resulting in the 15th RWF, 11th SWB and 10th and 16th Welsh being disbanded and the 2nd RWF joining from the 33rd Division. These changes to the division also saw the machine gun companies consolidated into a single battalion, one medium mortar battery broken up and absorbed by the remaining two batteries and the heavy mortar battery leaving the division to become a Corps asset.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} scheduling jobs on a pool <b>of</b> <b>machines.</b> Each job requires multiple machines on which it executes in parallel. For each job, the input specifies release time, deadline, processing time, profit and the number <b>of</b> <b>machines</b> required. The total number <b>of</b> <b>machines</b> may be different at different points of time. A feasible solution is a subset of jobs and a schedule for them such that at any timeslot, the total number <b>of</b> <b>machines</b> required by the jobs active at the timeslot does not exceed the number <b>of</b> <b>machines</b> available at that timeslot. We present an O(log(Bmax/Bmin)) approximation algorithm, where Bmax and Bmin are the maximum and minimum available bandwidth (maximum and minimum number <b>of</b> <b>machines</b> available over all the timeslots).

5|$|German forces also {{operated}} in the Battle of Jarama, {{which began with}} a Nationalist offensive on 6 February 1937. It included German-supplied ground forces, including two batteries <b>of</b> <b>machine</b> guns, a tank division, and the Condor Legion's anti-aircraft guns. Bombing by both Republican and Nationalist aircraft helped ensure a stalemate. It showed up the inadequacy of the Legion's aircraft, faced with superior Soviet-made fighters. The Legion's efforts only partly mitigated what was a significant defeat for the Nationalists at the Battle of Guadalajara during March. A joint Italian-German general {{had been set up}} in January 1937 to advise Franco on war planning. The defeat of a significant Italian force and the growing Soviet superiority in tanks and aircraft led the Germans to support a plan to abandon the offensive on Madrid and instead concentrate a series of attacks on weaker Republican-controlled areas. While many countries believed motorised troops to have been proven less effective than first thought, it was the inadequacy of the Italians as a fighting force that dominated German thought.|$|E
5|$|Immediately the American {{forces were}} hit with machine gun and mortar {{fire from the}} north ridge, where North Korean troops had been dug in. The first burst <b>of</b> <b>machine</b> gun fire killed Chae and wounded {{most of the other}} commanders, {{including}} Mott. Mott managed {{to make it to the}} ditch where American forces dug him a foxhole, but soon after all the Americans in his vicinity were killed or withdrew and he was left alone and unable to communicate with the rest of the battalion. North Korean forces had the US battalion in a crossfire on higher ground, both from the pass and from the ridge. Mortar fire knocked out many parked vehicles, including the radio jeep of a US Air Force tactical air-control party which was to direct airstrikes. During the fight two flights of US aircraft flew over the area trying in vain to contact the party, and when unable to do so, left the area without making any strikes.|$|E
5|$|In January 2000, Hugh Hancock, {{the founder}} of Strange Company, {{launched}} a new website, machinima.com. The new name surprised the community; a misspelled contraction <b>of</b> <b>machine</b> cinema (machinema), the term machinima was intended to dissociate in-game filming from a specific engine. The misspelling stuck because it also referenced anime. The new site featured tutorials, interviews, articles, and the exclusive release of Tritin Films' Quad God. The first film made with Quake III Arena, Quad God {{was also the first}} to be distributed as recorded video frames, not game-specific instructions. This change was initially controversial among machinima producers who preferred the smaller size of demo files. However, demo files required a copy of the game to view. The more accessible traditional video format broadened Quad Gods viewership, and the work was distributed on CDs bundled with magazines. Thus, id's decision to protect Quake IIIs code inadvertently caused machinima creators to use more general solutions and thus widen their audience. Within a few years, machinima films were almost exclusively distributed in common video file formats.|$|E

40|$|The {{determination}} {{of the number of}} preventive repair to make in a park <b>of</b> <b>machines</b> in a given period, in the majority of practical cases, is based on the knowledge of essential parameters obtained from the statistics such as: 1) Mean life duration of the equipment 2) Mean functioning duration until the first failure 3) Mean functioning duration between the failures 4) renewing intensity of the pa k <b>of</b> <b>machines.</b> However theses values cannot be taken as credible base data to be able to optimise the number <b>of</b> repair <b>of</b> <b>machines</b> in a dynamic exploitation system of a park <b>of</b> <b>machines</b> and obtain the wanted number <b>of</b> <b>machines</b> {{at the end of the}} planned period. The cited 4 parameters depend on 2 principal factors: • Evolution and importance of the park <b>of</b> <b>machines</b> (variable in time) • Exploitation methods in the park (repair quality and used means). The renewing intensity of the park <b>of</b> <b>machines</b> is a function of the demand and degradation intensity <b>of</b> <b>machines.</b> From another side, the repair duration depend on the functioning periodicity cited here, on their nature and their costs. These last influence, in a significant manner, the calculus results. It is then primordial to look for the solution of the problem by introducing the notion of parameters optimum values. In this paper is given a new approach of the problem, which studies the dependence of the cited parameters, of the exploitation time and of the importance of the park <b>of</b> <b>machines</b> always renewed. This has for effect to act directly on the costs due to this dependence that is: • The renewing costs (purchase <b>of</b> new <b>machines</b> and new repair means); • The exploitation and repair costs. This method permits to obtain optimal values: • Of the number of repairs; • Of the number <b>of</b> <b>machines</b> to purchase in the planned period; • Of the exploitation duration of every machin...|$|R
