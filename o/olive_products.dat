25|$|The Feria de la Alegría y el Olivo (“Alegria” and Olive Fair) {{has been}} an annual event since the 1970s in Santiago Tulyehualco. It is mostly based on a grain native to Mexico called amaranth. An “alegria” is a sweet made with this grain, honey with dried fruits and nuts {{sometimes}} added. However, the term {{is also used to}} refer to the plant that produces amaranth. An “olivo” is an olive tree. Amaranth was {{an important part of the}} pre-Hispanic diet, due to its nutritive qualities and its use in various ceremonies. This annual fair is dedicated to elaboration of this sweet along with <b>olive</b> <b>products</b> from the area. Over 250 producers of the grain offer their products in various preparations.

5000|$|Monasteries (Arabic dayr دير) {{that were}} {{numerous}} in what are now Iraq, Syria, Palestine, and Egypt usually included, {{in addition to}} a church and monks’ cells, an inn or caravanserais and land for agricultural cultivation. The monasteries drew revenue to meet their needs from their agricultural produce, most commonly date and <b>olive</b> <b>products,</b> and wine. Monasteries often became notable for their vintages, the inns and taverns attached to them became popular as private destinations for urban elites who enjoyed alcohol, and monasteries eventually came to figure prominently in Arabic khamriyya poetry. Monasteries and convents such as those in Qutrabbul, ‘Ana, Karkh, Falluj, Mosul, and Zandaward in Iraq, and the Convent of the Transfiguration in Syria, produced wine {{to such an extent that}} “monks became thus the biggest producers of wine in the Muslim lands.” [...] Arab elites in particular visited monastery taverns frequently enough that an entire literary genre, known as dayriyyāt, developed. The Kitāb al-Diyārāt (“monastery books”) collected poems and stories that described time spent in revelry at monasteries.|$|E

50|$|In 1991 Evcil {{attempted}} {{to obtain a}} bank loan from Türkiye İş Bankası, but was turned down. After setting up a company with relatives of key bank officials, Evcil's Erev Tekstil company was able to obtain a TL125bn loan. The capital of Evcil's <b>olive</b> <b>products</b> company, Eze Zeytincilik, grew by the same amount on the same day. Eze Zeytincilik {{had been set up}} with a $50m loan from moneylender Nesim Malki. Eze Zeytincilik claimed to be a successful exporter, but its factory was still under construction in 1995, and records of alleged sales achieved showed prices a third higher than other Turkish companies were able to charge. The fraud continued until Evcil's debts exceeded $100m and Evcil was unable to even keep up with the interest payments, at which point Is Bank began to investigate. Investigations were stymied by the bank's attempts to protect leading bank officials. Evcil's Eze Zeytincilik was confiscated by Is Bank in mid-1997, with the facility and lands estimated to be worth $4m, against $140m credit advanced for investments in the company. He had also obtained credit from a dozen other banks and financial institutions, including $75m from Türk Ticaret Bankası.|$|E
50|$|One very {{important}} aspect of the remit of the IOC is to draw up and update methods of analysis and standards for <b>olive</b> <b>products</b> with a view to promoting international trade and preventing fraud. To do so, it works very closely with leading chemists from its member countries who contribute their knowledge and expertise. It also cooperates with other international organisations such as the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) or the Codex Alimentarius Commission in order to bring their testing methods and standards into line with IOC texts. The IOC has two trade standards, one for olive oils and olive pomace oils and the other for table olives. The olive oil standard fixes the names and definitions of the different categories of olive oils and olive pomace oils as well the quality and purity criteria for each grade of product; it specifies testing methods and covers other aspects, such as food additives, contaminants, hygiene, packing, pack fill tolerances and labelling. IOC Members are committed to prohibiting the use of any product names other than those specified in the standard. The table olive standard fixes the names, definitions and requirements for all the different types, styles and trade preparations of table olives.|$|E

50|$|Examples of {{unsaturated}} {{fatty acids}} are palmitoleic acid, oleic acid, myristoleic acid, linoleic acid, and arachidonic acid.

25|$|The {{curing process}} may take {{from a few}} days, with lye, to a few months with brine or salt packing. With the {{exception}} of California style and salt-cured olives, all methods of curing involve a major fermentation involving bacteria and yeast that is of equal importance to the final table <b>olive</b> <b>product.</b> Traditional cures, using the natural microflora on the fruit to induce fermentation, lead to two important outcomes: the leaching out and breakdown of oleuropein and other unpalatable phenolic compounds, and the generation of favourable metabolites from bacteria and yeast, such as organic acids, probiotics, glycerol, and esters, which affect the sensory properties of the final table olives. Mixed bacterial/yeast olive fermentations may have probiotic qualities. Lactic acid {{is the most important}} metabolite, as it lowers the pH, acting as a natural preservative against the growth of unwanted pathogenic species. The result is table olives which can be stored without refrigeration. Fermentations dominated by lactic acid bacteria are, therefore, the most suitable method of curing olives. Yeast-dominated fermentations produce a different suite of metabolites which provide poorer preservation, so they are corrected with an acid such as citric acid in the final processing stage to provide microbial stability.|$|R
50|$|Ultimately, {{the olive}} tree and its fruit (the olive) present a real bounty, and the Greeks {{have been using}} olive leaves, olive oil, olives, olive pits, olive wood, and {{all parts of the}} olive tree for food, medicine, soap, cosmetics, moisturizers, lubricants, etc...... for {{thousands}} of years, and no adverse effects have come to light from the use of any <b>olive</b> related <b>product</b> (note the term 'use' as opposed to the term 'abuse').
