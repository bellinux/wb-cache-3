5|$|It’s {{a deadly}} time {{in so many}} ways to be in a band; you can have so much control <b>over</b> <b>your</b> work if you’re clever; you can release it how and when you like and in our opinion, right now, Ireland is the healthiest it’s ever been in terms of talent and diversity.|$|E
5|$|What is a boy? He is {{a person}} who is going to carry on what you have started, to sit where you are sitting and, when you are gone, attend to those things you think are so important. You can adopt all the {{policies}} you please, but how they will be carried on depends on him. Even if you make leagues and treaties, he will have to manage them. He will assume control of your cities and nations. He is going to move on and take <b>over</b> <b>your</b> prisons, churches, schools, universities and corporations.|$|E

Of course the {{security}} which you offer is no security at all, and no sane man would advance five thousand pennies on it." ...|$|R
25|$|This {{provides}} a surprise attack, by lifting the shinai <b>over</b> <b>your</b> shoulder before striking. Here a skilful {{use of the}} kensen and spirited attack is crucial for effective katsugi-waza or luring your opponent into breaking his/her posture.|$|E
25|$|This {{technique}} is a response. As an opponent strikes, you parry their shinai with yours. Then flip over (turn <b>over</b> <b>your</b> hands) and strike their opposite side. Valid strikes include:men-kaeshi-men, men-kaeshi-kote, men-kaeshi-do, kote-kaeshi-men, kote-kaeshi-kote, and do-kaeshi-men.|$|E
500|$|Jon Caramanica of The New York Times cited Banks' remix {{as one of}} {{her best}} songs, while Chris Martins of Spin wrote that she {{delivers}} [...] "fire-hot verse after fire-hot verse" [...] and facetiously remarked that [...] "Banks raps all <b>over</b> <b>your</b> dumb 'Harlem Shake' meme".|$|E

500|$|... "Speechless" [...] is a midtempo, R love song, {{featuring}} trumpet-sounding synths. Andy Kellman of Allmusic {{said that}} the song works a [...] "slow motion glide" [...] and that Ciara's voice [...] "hovers in a love-struck daze." [...] The lyrical content of the song consists of the protagonist confesses how perfect her significant other is, and that they need extra time to confess this, such as lines like [...] "I'd need an extra month on the year, one extra holiday just to kiss you all <b>over</b> <b>your</b> face." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} for the 'Demi World Tour,' Marielle Wakim from Los Angeles Magazine commented on Lovato's vocals, stating [...] "For those who haven’t bothered to follow Lovato's career, let's get {{something}} out of the way: the girl can sing. Get <b>over</b> <b>your</b> fear of being judged by your Facebook friends and Spotify her discography, because you’re going to have the last laugh five years down the road (probably sooner) when she wins a Grammy. At 22 years old, her vocal range is astounding." [...] She went on to further describe her vocals as [...] "spectacular." ...|$|E

500|$|Xerxes sent a Persian {{emissary}} {{to negotiate}} with Leonidas. The Greeks were offered their freedom, the title [...] "Friends of the Persian People", {{and the opportunity to}} re-settle on land better than that they possessed. When Leonidas refused these terms, the ambassador carried a written message by Xerxes, asking him to [...] "Hand <b>over</b> <b>your</b> arms". Leonidas' famous response was for the Persians to [...] "Come and take them" [...] (...) [...] With the Persian embassy returning empty-handed, battle became inevitable. Xerxes delayed for four days, waiting for the Greeks to disperse, before sending troops to attack them.|$|E
500|$|... {{with the}} lines: [...] "Remember those walls I built? Well, baby, they're {{tumbling}} down". She sings the introduction {{in a low}} register, {{and the power of}} her voice gradually increases as the song progresses. In the pre-chorus, she chants, [...] "Everywhere I'm looking now, I'm surrounded by your embrace, baby I can see your halo, you know you're my saving grace, you're everything I need and more, it's written all <b>over</b> <b>your</b> face". Beyoncé then echoes the word [...] "halo" [...] in the chorus; the third and final one is preceded by a 1980s drum breakdown, and is complemented by sweeping strings and percussion.|$|E
500|$|Some {{critics have}} judged Mega Man 3 to be {{excessively}} difficult. GamePro contributor McKinley Noble comically stated that actions such as [...] "pulling teeth, lifting a car <b>over</b> <b>your</b> head or performing open-heart surgery" [...] are all significantly easier than beating Mega Man 3. Whitehead noted, [...] "Leaps must be precise, enemies must be dispatched rapidly and accurately, and there's {{a constant state}} of delicious near-panic as you wait to see what vicious demands the next room will place on your platforming skills." [...] The Lessers additionally saw considerable flicker when too many sprites appear onscreen at once. The writers mentioned that it detracted from the normally crisp graphics the few times it was noticed.|$|E

500|$|In her youth, Wintour {{was educated}} at the {{independent}} North London Collegiate School, where she frequently rebelled against {{the dress code}} by taking up the hemlines of her skirts. At the age of 14, she began wearing {{her hair in a}} bob. She developed an interest in fashion as a regular viewer of Cathy McGowan on Ready Steady Go!, and from the issues of Seventeen which her grandmother sent from the United States. [...] "Growing up in London in the '60s, you'd have to have had Irving Penn's sack <b>over</b> <b>your</b> head not to know something extraordinary was happening in fashion," [...] she recalled. Her father regularly consulted her when he was considering ideas for increasing readership in the youth market.|$|E
500|$|Later {{that same}} day, on The Daily Show, Stewart poked {{fun at the}} fight by calling it [...] "the stupidest fucking thing anyone's ever seen." [...] He then apologized to Colbert, in a {{conversation}} via satellite, for inadvertently smashing him {{over the head with}} a beer bottle during the brawl, amid the confusion. [...] While Colbert accepted his apology, Stewart continued and asked why Colbert had initially responded by shoving a recycling bin over Stewart's head and hitting him with a baseball bat. [...] To which Colbert replied, [...] "No, no, Jon—I shoved a recycling bin <b>over</b> <b>your</b> head and encouraged Conan to hit you with a baseball bat," [...] and, as usual, left Stewart confused. [...] At the end of the segment, Stewart asked Colbert: [...] "Did we win that , by the way?" [...] Colbert's answer was, [...] "I think America won, Jon." ...|$|E
500|$|After a {{month to}} recover from his wounds, Kizirian rejoined his unit, which was {{assigned}} to Sugar Loaf Hill. The Marines battled over one ridge after another toward NaHa, the capital city. On three separate occasions Kizirian was tossed in the air by Japanese artillery and mortar fire while he provided covering fire for {{other members of his}} unit, who were retreating down a slope. Kizirian's company moved to a burial ground where Japanese soldiers were hiding in holes dug in the nearby hillsides. During the operation, someone yelled, [...] "Two <b>over</b> <b>your</b> head!" [...] Kizirian responded by killing both of the enemy combatants with his carbine. [...] Kizirian would later recall, [...] "I must have shot four clips into those guys, I got them before they got me." [...] Moments later, an enemy rushed towards Kizirian with a sword. Kizirian managed to kill the enemy with a pistol and took the sword.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the mass}} {{success of the}} band's self-titled album, author Dick Porter wrote that the {{anticipation}} for a follow up was intense. Prior to its release, drummer Jordison proclaimed: [...] "Wait till you hear our fuckin' next record. It smokes our first album. The shit's twice as technical, three times as heavy." [...] Iowa generally received favorable reviews from music critics. The College Music Journal reviewed it as [...] "brutal, unrelenting, scorching..." [...] Many reviews noted its heavy themes; Alternative Press stated, [...] " [...] like having a plastic bag taped <b>over</b> <b>your</b> head for an hour while Satan uses your scrotum as a speedbag.... is over the top...you're {{going to be left}} in stitches." [...] NME said that it is [...] "Exhilarating, brutal and good." [...] Rolling Stone credited the album for its originality, stating that [...] "nearly everything else in modern doom rock sounds banal." [...] Producer Robinson was also praised for his work on the album; Uncut noted, [...] "The barely relenting, tumbling noise attack marshalled by nu metal uber-producer Ross Robinson is expert." [...] Reviewing for Yahoo, John Mulvey said, [...] "They're an evolutionary dead end, the final, absolute triumph of nu metal." ...|$|E
500|$|At the Second Battle of El Alamein, the 9th Division {{was given}} {{responsibility}} for clearing a corridor through the German and Italian {{forces in the}} North and threatening to cut off those between the coastal road and the sea. In the initial assault the division hacked {{its way through the}} enemy defences but failed to clear the minefields. As the British attack faltered, the main effort switched to the 9th Division, which punched a massive dent into the German and Italian position over the next five days at great cost, [...] "crumbling" [...] the Afrika Korps in the process, and ultimately forcing Rommel to retreat. [...] "I am quite certain", Leese informed Morshead, [...] "that this breakout was made possible by Homeric fighting <b>over</b> <b>your</b> divisional sector." [...] During the El Alamein Campaign, the 9th Division suffered 22% of the British Eighth Army's casualties; 1,177 Australians were killed, while 3,629 were wounded, 795 were captured and 193 were missing. Morshead received yet another mention in despatches in June 1942, and in November 1942 he was also created a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath.|$|E
500|$|Beginning in 2005, Thompson {{supported}} {{a campaign to}} discourage Take-Two’s subsidiary, Rockstar Games, from releasing a game called Bully, in which, according to Thompson, [...] "what you are in effect doing is rehearsing your physical revenge and violence against those whom you have been victimized by. And then you, like Klebold and Harris in Columbine, become the ultimate bully." [...] According to Thompson, the game [...] "shows you how to—by bullying—take <b>over</b> <b>your</b> school. You punch people; you hit them with sling shots; you dunk their heads in dirty toilets. There's white-on-black crime in the game. You bludgeon teachers and classmates with bats. It's absolutely nuts." [...] Thompson sued Wal-Mart, Best Buy, Target, Circuit City, GameStop, and Toys 'R' Us, seeking an order to bar the game’s release. He also participated in a protest at Rockstar's office that also included students from Peaceaholics, a Washington, D.C. mentoring organization. Thompson said he hoped that the pressure would get retailers to refuse to carry the game. In March 2006, a Florida school board he had lobbied passed a resolution criticizing the game, but only urged retailers not to sell the game to minors.|$|E
