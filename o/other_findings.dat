5|$|In {{those who}} are {{otherwise}} healthy, {{there is little evidence}} that supplements have any benefits with respect to cancer or heart disease. Vitamin A and E supplements not only provide no health benefits for generally healthy individuals, but they may increase mortality, though the two large studies that support this conclusion included smokers for whom it was already known that beta-carotene supplements can be harmful. While <b>other</b> <b>findings</b> suggest that vitamin E toxicity is limited to only a specific form when taken in excess.|$|E
5|$|In September 2010, Volvo Cars and Vattenfall, a Swedish energy company, {{issued a}} report {{regarding}} {{the results of the}} first phase of the Volvo V70 Plug-in Hybrid demonstration program. Among <b>other</b> <b>findings,</b> before the trial drivers participating in the field testing were concerned about being a danger to pedestrians and cyclists due to the quietness of the electric-drive vehicle. After the test several of them change their opinion and said that this issue was less of a problem than expected. Nevertheless, some test drivers said they experienced incidents of not being noticed while others said they had taken extra care in their driving with regard to this issue.|$|E
5|$|Like {{those of}} most other non-avian theropods, Acrocanthosaurus forelimbs did not {{make contact with the}} ground and were not used for locomotion; instead they served a predatory function. The {{discovery}} of a complete forelimb (NCSM 14345) allowed the first analysis of the function and range of motion of the forelimb in Acrocanthosaurus. The study examined the bone surfaces which would have articulated with other bones to determine how far the joints could move without dislocating. In many of the joints, the bones did not fit together exactly, indicating the presence of a considerable amount of cartilage in the joints, as is seen in many living archosaurs. Among <b>other</b> <b>findings,</b> the study suggested that, in a resting position, the forelimbs would have hung from the shoulders with the humerus angled backwards slightly, the elbow bent, and the claws facing medially (inwards).|$|E

5|$|The Communist Party {{strongly}} supported {{the restoration of}} Alexandrov's melody, but some members proposed other changes to the anthem. In March 2010, Boris Kashin, a CPRF member of the Duma, advocated {{for the removal of}} any reference to God in the anthem. Kashin's suggestion was also supported by Alexander Nikonov, a journalist with SPID-INFO and an avowed atheist. Nikonov argued that religion should be a private matter and should not be used by the state. Kashin found that the cost for making a new anthem recording will be about 120,000rubles. The Russian Government quickly rejected the request because it lacked statistical data and <b>other</b> <b>findings.</b> Nikonov asked the Constitutional Court of Russia in 2005 if the lyrics were compatible with Russian law.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{findings}} {{in people with}} tension pneumothorax are chest pain and respiratory distress, often with an increased heart rate (tachycardia) and rapid breathing (tachypnea) in the initial stages. <b>Other</b> <b>findings</b> may include quieter breath sounds {{on one side of}} the chest, low oxygen levels and blood pressure, and displacement of the trachea away from the affected side. Rarely, there may be cyanosis (bluish discoloration of the skin due to low oxygen levels), altered level of consciousness, a hyperresonant percussion note on examination of the affected side with reduced expansion and decreased movement, pain in the epigastrium (upper abdomen), displacement of the apex beat (heart impulse), and resonant sound when tapping the sternum. This is a medical emergency and may require immediate treatment without further investigations (see below).|$|E
5|$|The city is {{difficult}} to excavate, as it is buried deep under the later layers of habitation. A defensive system against floods, composed of a circular embankment was unearthed, {{in addition to a}} circular 6.7m thick internal rampart to protect the city from enemies. An area of 300 meters long filled with gardens and craftsmen quarters, separated the outer embankment from the inner rampart which had a height of 8 to 10 meters, and was strengthened by defensive towers. <b>Other</b> <b>findings</b> include one of the city gates, a street beginning at the center and ending at the gate, in addition to residential houses. Mari had a central mound, however no temple or palaces have been unearthed, although a large building that seems to have been an administrative one was unearthed which had stone foundations and dimensions of (32 meters X 25 meters), with rooms up to 12 meters long and 6 meters wide. The city was abandoned {{at the end of the}} Early Dynastic period II c. 2550 BC for unknown reasons.|$|E

5|$|Voight's {{successful}} {{prediction that}} an avalanche at St. Helens could provoke a lateral eruption, an eruption from the volcano's flank {{rather than its}} summit, {{attracted the attention of}} the government of Montserrat in March 1996. Worried about an expanding lava dome at the Soufrière Hills volcano, the island's government asked Voight to assess its potential for an avalanche that could generate an eruption. Voight thought it was unlikely that the crater would collapse, but expressed concern over a possible pyroclastic flow that could reach the city of Plymouth in approximately three minutes. The city and a village on the mountain were evacuated, and within three years, pyroclastic flows overtook the abandoned sites. Following these eruptions, Voight served {{as a member of the}} Risk Assessment Panel that advised Montserrat's government, and he co-established the Caribbean Andesite Lava Island Precision Seismo-geodetic Observatory (CALIPSO) with a team of international scientists. He continued research at the island with Steven Sparks, a geoscientist at the University of Bristol, establishing the SEA-CALIPSO system to analyze Soufrière Hills by using seismic waves and explosions in the ocean. Among <b>other</b> <b>findings,</b> this effort detected a major fault trending north-to-west under Montserrat's western side. Voight still oversees hazard assessments at the volcano, providing his input during eruptive periods in 2006 and 2010.|$|E

The date and causes of the violent destruction of Canaanite Hazor have been an important issue ever since the first excavations of the site. One school of thought, represented by Yigael Yadin, Yohanan Aharoni and Amnon Ben-Tor, dates the destruction to the later half of the 13th century, tying it to biblical descriptions in Joshua which hold the Israelites responsible for the event. The second school of thought, represented by Olga Tufnell, Kathleen Kenyon, P. Beck, Moshe Kochavi and Israel Finkelstein, tends to support an earlier date {{in the first half}} of the 13th century, in which case there is no necessary connection between the destruction of Hazor and the process of settlement by Israelite Tribes in Cannan. <b>Other</b> <b>findings</b> at the site include a distinctive six chambered gate dating to the Early Iron Age, as well as pottery and administrative buildings dating to either the 10th century and King Solomon or, on a lowered chronology, to the Omrides of the 9th century.|$|E
