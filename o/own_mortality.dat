5|$|A {{preoccupation with}} his <b>own</b> <b>mortality</b> {{permeates}} Shostakovich's later works, {{among them the}} later quartets and the Fourteenth Symphony of 1969 (a song cycle based {{on a number of}} poems on the theme of death). This piece also finds Shostakovich at his most extreme with musical language, with twelve-tone themes and dense polyphony used throughout. Shostakovich dedicated this score to his close friend Benjamin Britten, who conducted its Western premiere at the 1970 Aldeburgh Festival. The Fifteenth Symphony of 1971 is, by contrast, melodic and retrospective in nature, quoting Wagner, Rossini and the composer's own Fourth Symphony.|$|E
5|$|Leslie (Amy Poehler) announces Li'l Sebastian, Pawnee's beloved celebrity {{miniature}} horse, {{has died}} and the parks department will hold {{a memorial service for}} him. Tom (Aziz Ansari) suggests they hire Entertainment 720 for the event, a production company recently started by his friend Jean-Ralphio (Ben Schwartz). Jean-Ralphio encourages Tom to come work with him on the company, but Tom is reluctant to leave his city hall job. Meanwhile, the extremely health-conscious Chris (Rob Lowe) finds out he has tendonitis, and takes the news so seriously that he questions his <b>own</b> <b>mortality.</b> Leslie and Ben (Adam Scott) continue their romance despite a no-dating policy at city hall, but they have difficulty keeping it a secret. Ron (Nick Offerman) finds out and warns them that Chris will fire them if he learns about it.|$|E

25|$|In {{light of}} Dylan's May 1997 health scare, {{a number of}} columnists, {{including}} Dylanologist A.J. Weberman, speculated that the songs on Time Out of Mind were inspired by an increased awareness of his <b>own</b> <b>mortality.</b> This was {{despite the fact that}} all of the songs were completed, recorded, and even mixed before he was hospitalized. In interviews following its release, Dylan dismissed these speculations.|$|E
25|$|Groups {{such as the}} Tolpuddle Martyrs {{would often}} use a {{skeleton}} painting {{as part of their}} initiation process. The newest member would be blindfolded and made to swear a secret oath of allegiance. The blindfold would then be removed and they would be presented with the skeleton painting. This was to warn them of their <b>own</b> <b>mortality</b> but also to remind them of what happens to those who break their promises. An example of this skeleton painting is on display at the People's History Museum, Manchester.|$|E
25|$|Osterkamp used a {{break in}} the weather to lead III./JG 51 on a patrol over the Dover area and spotted a {{formation}} of RAF aircraft at 12:45. Identifying them as Defiants, they attacked from the rear and below, to avoid return fire from the turret. Four Defiants were shot down on the first pass and another as it sought cloud cover. The Bf109s were interrupted by 111 Squadron which shot down a Bf 109 into the sea and the four surviving Defiants escaped, one crash-landed, one was written off and the other two were damaged. Osterkamp noted that the pilots' delight with their success was tempered with knowledge of their <b>own</b> <b>mortality</b> after this mission.|$|E

40|$|Background: Scorpions’ stings {{and their}} <b>own</b> <b>mortalities</b> place them {{among the most}} {{important}} health and medical problems. The dreadful features and especially their poisonous stings are considered a major cause of human stress and abhorrence/phobia. The current study aimed to study the scorpion fauna of Ilam Province, south western Iran in order to manage scorpionism related problems. Methods: In this field-laboratory investigation during March 2014 to February 2015, different parts of Ilam Province were surveyed. Nine sampling parts were selected based on geographical situation, scorpionism reports, weather, flora, and local data. Capturing scorpion was done employing a black light, and a long forceps from dusk to mid­night. The collected scorpions were placed to 70 % ethyl alcohol. All specimens were determined based on the valid taxonomic keys, furthermore their sexes were studied. Results: Out of the 391 collected scorpions, 11 species were identified as follows: Hottentotta saulcyi, Mesobuthus eupeus, Compsobuthus matthiesseni, Razianus zarudnyi, Hemiscorpius lepturus, Androctonus crassicauda, Or­thochirus iranus, Odontobuthus bidentatus, Buthacus macrocentrus, Scorpio maurus, and Polisius persicus. Conclusion: Eleven species of Buthidae, Scorpionidae and Hemiscorpiidae families from high risk areas were iden­tified. Despite the low surface of the province, such different species reveals a diverse scorpion fauna that, in turn, shows good and suitable habits of scorpions, as considered by health staff. </p...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{demonstrates that}} exposure to death-related stimuli can increase consumers' amounts of purchasing and consumption. We demonstrate that consumers who have been recently reminded of their <b>own</b> impending <b>mortality</b> wish to purchase higher quantities of food products (and actually eat higher quantities) than do their control counterparts. This effect occurs primarily among low-self-esteem consumers. We explain our findings in terms of escape from self-awareness. Low (but not high) self-esteem participants overconsume {{in response to a}} mortality salience activation as a means to escape from self-awareness. We also address alternative explanations for these effects. (c) 2008 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc [...] ...|$|R
25|$|Cleaning the Mirror {{consisted}} of five monitors playing footage in which Abramović scrubs a grimy human skeleton in her lap. She vigorously brushes the {{different parts of}} the skeleton with soapy water. Each monitor is dedicated to one part of the skeleton: the head, the pelvis, the ribs, the hands, and the feet. Each video is filmed with its own sound, creating an overlap. As the skeleton becomes cleaner, Abramović becomes covered in the grayish dirt that was once covering the skeleton. This three-hour performance is filled with metaphors of the Tibetan death rites that prepare disciples to become one with their <b>own</b> <b>mortality.</b> The piece consists of a three-piece series. Cleaning the Mirror #1 was performed at the Museum of Modern Art, consisting of three hours. Cleaning the Mirror #2 consists of 90 minutes performed at Oxford University. Cleaning the Mirror #3 was performed at Pitt Rivers Museum for five hours.|$|E
25|$|In 1973, Holden starred with Kay Lenz {{in movie}} {{directed}} by Clint Eastwood called Breezy, which {{was considered a}} box-office flop. Also in 1974, Holden starred with Paul Newman and Steve McQueen in the critically acclaimed disaster film The Towering Inferno, which became a box-office smash {{and one of the}} highest-grossing films of Holden's career. Two years later, he was praised for his Oscar-nominated leading performance in Sidney Lumet's classic Network (1976), an examination of the media written by Paddy Chayefsky, playing an older version of the character type for which he had become iconic in the 1950s, only now more jaded and aware of his <b>own</b> <b>mortality.</b> In 1980, Holden appeared in The Earthling with popular child actor Ricky Schroder, playing a loner dying of cancer who goes to the Australian outback to end his days, meets a young boy whose parents have been killed in an accident, and teaches him how to survive.|$|E
25|$|In 1819, Goya {{purchased}} {{a house on}} the banks of Manzanares near Madrid called Quinta del Sordo (Villa of the Deaf Man). It was a two-story house which was named after a previous occupant who had been deaf, although the name was fitting for Goya too, who had been left deaf after contracting a fever in 1792. Between 1819 and 1823, when he left the house to move to Bordeaux, Goya produced a series of 14 works, which he painted with oils directly onto the walls of the house. At the age of 73, and having survived two life-threatening illnesses, Goya was likely to have been concerned with his <b>own</b> <b>mortality,</b> and was increasingly embittered by the civil strife occurring in Spain. Although he initially decorated the rooms of the house with more inspiring images, in time he overpainted them all with the intense haunting pictures known today as the Black Paintings. Uncommissioned and never meant for public display, these pictures reflect his darkening mood with some intense scenes of malevolence and conflict.|$|E
5000|$|Pulp is a {{pulp fiction}} novel which acts {{also as a}} meta-pulp. Pulp {{comments}} on the obsessions of the pulp fiction genre, making fun of itself as stereotypical of the genre in the grimiest form. Bukowski dedicates the story to [...] "bad writing", as Bukowski did not plan his mystery novel well and frequently wrote Nicky Belane into holes from which he could not escape. Bukowski wrote {{some of his most}} violent, cynical, sarcastic, and shocking work during the final months of his life. Many critics have agreed this novel exemplifies Bukowski showing an acceptance of his <b>own</b> pending <b>mortality.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The poem {{within the}} story, [...] "The Conqueror Worm", also leads to some {{questioning}} of Ligeia's alleged resurrection. The poem essentially shows {{an admission of}} her <b>own</b> inevitable <b>mortality.</b> The inclusion of the bitter poem may have been meant to be ironic or a parody of the convention at the time, both in literature and in life. In the mid-19th century it was common to emphasize the sacredness of death {{and the beauty of}} dying (consider Charles Dickens's Little Johnny character in Our Mutual Friend or the death of Helen Burns in Charlotte Brontë's Jane Eyre). Instead, Ligeia speaks of fear personified in the [...] "blood-red thing". [...] Other interpretations have been suggested however.|$|R
50|$|While devotions to Marici predate Zen, {{they appear}} to be geared towards a similar meditative mode in order to enable the warrior to achieve a more {{heightened}} spiritual level. He lost interest in the issues of victory or defeat (or life and death), thus transcending to level where he became so empowered that he was freed from his <b>own</b> grasp on <b>mortality.</b> The end result was that he became a better warrior.|$|R
25|$|Doughty's main {{inspiration}} for her advocacy work was the frequent {{absence of the}} decedents' families in the process, which she attributed to the Western death anxiety and death phobia. She wanted to encourage death acceptance, {{and a return to}} such practices as memento mori, reminders of one's <b>own</b> <b>mortality,</b> resulting in healthier grieving, mourning, and closure after the inevitable deaths of people around us, as well as starting a movement to broaden the funeral industry to offer more funeral options, such as natural burial, sky burial, alkaline hydrolysis (liquid cremation), or promession. Embalming began to dominate in the US after the Civil War. A century later, in the 1960s, Americans began to turn away from embalming and burial, as cremation became increasingly popular, so that today it is used in almost half of deaths in urban areas. Cremation is seen {{as a threat to the}} traditional funeral industry, but has a reputation as the more environmentally friendly option. This change can be traced to the lifting of the ban on cremation by Pope Paul VI in 1963, and to the publication in the same year of The American Way of Death by Jessica Mitford, documenting abuses in the funeral industry and criticizing the excessive cost of funerals. Mitford's book, and the movement it started, was one of Doughty's inspirations, but Doughty feels that while Mitford had the right target, the profit-driven funeral industry, Mitford erred in sharing the industry's, and the public's, unhealthy desire to push out of sight and avoid thinking about the corpse itself. Doughty seeks to build on Mitford's reforms but in a direction that embraces the reality of death and returns to funeral and mourning practices that include spending time with and having contact with the dead body itself.|$|E

40|$|A Research project {{submitted}} in partial {{fulfillment of}} the requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Business Science in Actuarial Science at Strathmore UniversityAfrican countries have had the challenge of lacking country-specific published mortality tables. Up to date there exists only two countries in the continent that have managed to achieve this milestone and these are Kenya and South Africa. Rwanda is faced with the same problem of lacking published mortality tables reflecting their <b>own</b> unique <b>mortality</b> but are however seeking {{to develop their own}} tables. This study takes a keen look on how Rwanda-specific mortality tables can be developed by use of the Brass-Iogit model. Additionally, pricing for life insurance is carried out using the developed mortality rates so as to come up with suitable premium rates that are applicable to the Rwandan population...|$|R
5|$|According to {{continuation}} Bond author Raymond Benson, {{there was}} {{further development of}} the Bond character in Thunderball, with glimpses of both his sense of humour and his <b>own</b> sense of <b>mortality</b> being shown. Felix Leiter had his largest role to date in a Bond story and much of his humour came though, whilst his incapacity, suffered in Live and Let Die, had not led to bitterness or to his being unable to join in with the underwater fight scene {{towards the end of}} the novel.|$|R
2500|$|When {{an adult}} child loses a parent in later adulthood, it is {{considered}} to be [...] "timely" [...] and to be a normative life course event. This allows the adult children to feel a permitted level of grief. However, research shows that the death of a parent in an adult's midlife is not a normative event by any measure, but is a major life transition causing an evaluation of one's <b>own</b> life or <b>mortality.</b> Others may shut out friends and family in processing the loss of someone with whom they have had the longest relationship.|$|R
500|$|The Songlines {{features}} a narrator named Bruce whose biography is {{almost identical to}} Chatwin's. The narrator spends time in Australia trying to learn about Aboriginal culture, specifically the songlines. As the book goes on, it becomes a reflection on what Chatwin stated was [...] "for me, the question of questions: {{the nature of human}} restlessness." [...] Chatwin also hinted at his preoccupation over his <b>own</b> <b>mortality</b> in the text: [...] "I had a presentiment that the 'travelling' phase of my life might be passing... I should set down on paper a resume of the ideas, quotations, and encounters that amused me and obsessed me..." [...] Following this statement in The Songlines Chatwin included extensive excerpts from his moleskine notebooks.|$|E
500|$|David Sims of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode an A, {{calling it a}} [...] "classic" [...] and writing that it [...] "is so damn clever in how it bonds Jerry's fears about social niceties with larger fears about mortality"; he also praised Louis-Dreyfus's acting, saying that Elaine [...] "has an amusingly stark little bit of {{dialogue}} about death midway through the episode: [...] "You know, funerals always make me think about my <b>own</b> <b>mortality</b> and how I'm actually going to die someday. Me, dead. Imagine that!" [...] I think it's probably Louis-Dreyfus' best moment of the show so far, because she's really starting to nail Elaine's declarative, vaguely imperious, self-centered tone."

500|$|In {{writing the}} script for [...] "Subway", Yoshimura wanted the Pembleton {{character}} to be confronted with his <b>own</b> <b>mortality,</b> a theme that had continued from the previous season in which the character suffered a stroke. Although Pembleton does not typically discuss his own feelings, Yoshimura {{wanted him to be}} placed in a situation in which he not only discussed death, but is also led by the unique circumstance of Lange's subway incident to confide his stroke experience to an almost complete stranger. From the beginning of the writing process, Yoshimura specifically wanted the Lange character to be mean and unpleasant, rather than the nice and innocent victim more typically portrayed in such television episodes: [...] "Tragedy can happen to jerky people too and I think it'd be much more interesting to see how that kind of character's circumstances transcends the typical cliched TV kind of victim." ...|$|E

5000|$|Furthermore, Burkert {{argues that}} myth and ritual {{together}} serve a [...] "socializing function." [...] As an example, Burkert gives {{the example of}} hunting rituals. Hunting, Burkert argues, took on a sacred, ritualistic aura once it ceased to be necessary for survival: [...] "Hunting lost its basic function {{with the emergence of}} agriculture some ten thousand years ago. But hunting ritual had become so important that it could not be given up." [...] By performing the ritual of hunting together, an ancient society bonded itself together as a group, and also provided a way for its members to vent their anxieties over their <b>own</b> aggressiveness and <b>mortality.</b>|$|R
500|$|The {{nature of}} human evil forms a {{significant}} related theme through A Wizard of Earthsea {{as well as the}} other Earthsea novels. As with other works by Le Guin, evil is shown as a misunderstanding of the balance of life. Ged is born with great power in him, but the pride that he takes in his power leads to his downfall; he tries to demonstrate his strength by bringing a spirit back from the dead, and in performing this act against the laws of nature, releases the shadow that attacks him. Slusser suggests that although he is provoked into performing dangerous spells first by the girl on Gont and then by Jasper, this provocation exists in Ged's mind. He is shown as unwilling to look within himself and see the pride that drives him to do what he does. When he accepts the shadow into himself, he also finally accepts responsibility for his own actions, and by accepting his <b>own</b> <b>mortality</b> he is able to free himself. His companion Vetch describes the moment by saying ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the belief}} system of Bliss, the space outside {{the ship is}} equated with spiritual and {{physical}} danger, evil, and death. The separation the angels create between themselves and {{the outside of the}} ship also becomes a separation from history and the future, and from their <b>own</b> <b>mortality.</b> The story briefly quotes Lao Tzu (referring to him as [...] "Old Long Ears") and suggests that the angels' pursuit of total control over their environment are dangerous: it is the [...] "dangerous" [...] planet of New Earth which offers the true possibility of a utopia. According to scholar Everett Hammer, writing in an anthology examining Le Guin's work, [...] "Paradises Lost" [...] suggests that any attempt to create a utopia while ignoring the history of the people within it is bound to degenerate into a dystopia. Several other works of hers, including [...] "A Wizard of Earthsea", [...] "The Telling" [...] and [...] "Always Coming Home", also suggest that [...] "a healthy future is not possible without an accurately understood past." ...|$|E
500|$|Profitable though La fille du tambour-major was, {{composing}} it left Offenbach {{less time}} to work on his cherished project, the creation of a successful serious opera. Since the beginning of 1877, he had been working when he could on a piece based on a stage play, Les contes fantastiques d'Hoffmann, by Jules Barbier and Michel Carré. [...] Offenbach had suffered from gout since the 1860s, often being carried into the theatre in a chair. Now in failing health, he was conscious of his <b>own</b> <b>mortality</b> and wished passionately to live long enough to complete the opera Les contes d'Hoffmann ("The Tales of Hoffmann"). He was heard saying to Kleinzach, his dog, [...] "I would give everything I have to be at the première". However, Offenbach did not live to finish the piece. He left the vocal score substantially complete and had made a start on the orchestration. [...] Ernest Guiraud, a family friend, assisted by Offenbach's 18-year-old son Auguste, completed the orchestration, making significant changes as well as the substantial cuts demanded by the Opéra-Comique's director, Carvalho. [...] The opera was first seen at the Opéra-Comique on 10 February 1881; Guiraud added recitatives for the Vienna premiere, in December 1881, and other versions were made later.|$|E
50|$|In the seventies, {{birth rates}} {{declined}} again. Economic pressure on families remained, and {{people began to}} seek ways to circumvent the decree.

These women could only utilize primitive methods of abortion, which led to infection, sterility or even their <b>own</b> death.
