Materials and Methods: 24 full-grown sheep had ACDF of C 3 / 4 and C 5 / 6 with an experimental bioabsorbable implant (magnesium and PCL) in one level and an autologous tricortical bone graft in the second level. The sheep were divided into 4 groups (6 sheep each). After 3, 6, 12, or 24 weeks postoperatively, the cervical spines were harvested and conventional x-rays of each operated segment were conducted. The progress of interbody fusion was classified according to a three-point scoring system. Results: There were no operation related complications except for one intraoperative fracture of the anterior superior iliac spine and two cases of screw loosening and sinking, respectively. In particular, no vascular, neurologic, wound healing or infectious problems were observed. According {{to the time of}} follow-up, both interbody fusion devices showed similar behaviour with increasing intervertebral osseointegration and complete arthrodesis in 10 of 12 (83. 3 %) motion segments after 24 weeks.

40|$|Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) are a {{group of}} {{neurodegenerative}} diseases affecting {{a wide range of}} mammalian species. They are caused by prions, a proteinaceous pathogen essentially composed of PrPSc, an abnormal isoform of the host encoded cellular prion protein PrPC. Constrained steric interactions between PrPSc and PrPC are thought to provide prions with species specificity, and to control cross-species transmission into other host populations, including humans. Transgenetic expression of foreign PrP genes has been successfully and widely used to overcome the recognized resistance of mouse to foreign TSE sources. Rabbit is one of the species that exhibit a pronounced resistance to TSEs. Most attempts to infect experimentally rabbit have failed, except after inoculation with cell-free generated rabbit prions. To gain insights on the molecular determinants of the relative resistance of rabbits to prions, we generated transgenic rabbits expressing the susceptible V 136 R 154 Q 171 allele of the ovine PRNP gene on a rabbit wild type PRNP New Zealand background and assessed their experimental susceptibility to scrapie prions. All transgenic animals developed a typical TSE 6 - 8 months after intracerebral inoculation, whereas wild type rabbits remained healthy more than 700 days after inoculation. Despite the endogenous presence of rabbit PrPC, <b>only</b> <b>ovine</b> PrPSc was detectable in the brains of diseased animals.

The {{present study was}} carried out to derive foetal mesenchymal stem cells from ovine source and analyze their differentiation to osteogenic linage {{to serve as an}} animal model to predict human applications. Methods: Isolation and culture of sheep foetal bone marrow cells were done and uniform clonally derived MSC population was collected. The cells were characterized using cytochemical, immunophenotyping, biochemical and molecular analyses. The cells with defined characteristics were differentiated into osteogenic lineages and analysis for differentiated cell types was done. The cells were analyzed for cell surface marker expression and the gene expression in undifferentiated and differentiated osteoblast was checked by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT PCR) analysis and confirmed by sequencing using genetic analyzer. Results: Ovine foetal samples were processed to obtain mononuclear (MNC) cells which on culture showed spindle morphology, a characteristic oval body with the flattened ends. MSC population CD 45 - /CD 14 - was cultured by limiting dilution to arrive at uniform spindle morphology cells and colony forming units. The cells were shown to be positive for surface markers such as CD 44, CD 54, integrinβ 1, and intracellular collagen type I/III and fibronectin. The osteogenically induced MSCs were analyzed for alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and mineral deposition. The undifferentiated MSCs expressed RAB 3 B, candidate marker for stemness in MSCs. The osteogenically induced and uninduced MSCs expressed collagen type I and MMP 13 gene in osteogenic induced cells. Interpretation & conclusions: The protocol for isolation of ovine foetal bone marrow derived MSCs was simple to perform, and the cultural method of obtaining pure spindle morphology cells was established. Criteria proposed for defining MSCs by this study includes the cell adherence to culture plates, specific surface protein profiles and differentiation to osteogenic lineage.

Here we present the in vitro and in vivo safety testing that was completed {{in order to obtain}} necessary regulatory approval prior to conducting human studies in Europe, as well as an FDA Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) to conduct a Pivotal Trial in the United States. Stimulated electrodes (10 mA, 500 μs, 100 Hz) were compared to unstimulated electrodes using optical microscopy and several electrochemical techniques over the course of 27 weeks. Electrode dissolution was evaluated by analyzing trace metal content of solutions in which electrodes were stimulated. Lastly, safety testing under Good Laboratory Practice guidelines was conducted in an <b>ovine</b> <b>animal</b> model over a 12 and 24 week time period, with results processed and evaluated by an independent histopathologist. Long-term stimulation testing indicated that the neo electrode with a sputtered iridium oxide coating can be stimulated at maximal levels for the lifetime of the implant without clinically significant dissolution of platinum or iridium, and without increasing the potential at the electrode interface to cause hydrolysis or significant tissue damage. Histological examination of tissue that was adjacent to the neo electrodes indicated no clinically significant signs of increased inflammation and no arterial stenosis as a result of 6 months of continuous stimulation. The work presented here involved rigorous characterization and evaluation testing of the neo electrode, which was used to support its safety for chronic implantation.

This study aimed to develop a comprehensive large <b>animal</b> (<b>ovine)</b> model of transfusion encompassing: blood collection, processing and storage, compatibility testing right through to post-transfusion outcomes. Materials and methods: Two units of blood were collected from each of 12 adult male Merino sheep and processed into 24 ovine-packed red blood cell (PRBC) units. Baseline haematological parameters of ovine blood and PRBC cells were analysed. Biochemical changes in ovine PRBCs were characterized during the 42 -day storage period. Immunological compatibility of the blood was confirmed with sera from potential recipient sheep, using a saline and albumin agglutination cross-match. Following confirmation of compatibility, each recipient sheep (n = 12) was transfused with two units of ovine PRBC. Results: Procedures for collecting, processing, cross-matching and transfusing ovine blood were established. Although ovine red blood cells are smaller and higher in number, their mean cell haemoglobin concentration is similar to human red blood cells. Ovine PRBC showed improved storage properties in saline-adenine-glucose-mannitol (SAG-M) compared with previous human PRBC studies.

40|$|Dual energy X-ray {{absorptiometry}} (DXA) is {{the most}} widely used bone quantity investigation in human osteoporosis; it is so ubiquitous that many clinicians now mistakenly equate DXA derived areal BMD with bone strength. Bone strength partly depends on bone mass and the distribution of this mass in terms of size and shape but also depends on bone quality factors of microarchitecture, material properties, accumulated microdamage and remodelling rate. In osteoporosis research, sheep have emerged as a useful lar ge animal model due to size and physiological similarities to humans; and, as a flock animal, large numbers of sheep can be reared at reasonable costs. The aim of this research, part of the ?Bone for Life? group of studies, was to evaluate; DXA scanner val idity in the <b>ovine</b> <b>animal</b> model, DXA derived bone quantity (aBMD) change in an <b>ovine</b> <b>animal</b> model of osteoporosis, and following on from these preliminary studies; to examine the influence of DXA derived aBMD on cortical and trabecular bone mechanical prop erties. In initial validation studies of DXA scanner reliability and assessment of natural variation in aBMD in the Irish sheep population ex - vivo bone samples were sourced from heal thy Irish mixed breed ewes (age > 5 yr) at routine commercial sacrifice. Fur ther samples were also harvested from control (CON) and ovariectomised (OVX) sheep in a specially reared flock at two time points, 12 and 31 month post - ovariectomy, to determine the short - and long - term effect of ovariectomy on bone quantity (aBMD); and in further collaborative studies, bone quantity and quality relationships to mechanical properties. The DXA scan protocol consisted of standardised alignment of the whole sample (WB) on a holding jig within a tank filled with normal saline, followed by basel ine repeat data acquisition scans using a standard algorithm. The same algorithm allowed further analysis (SRA) of six sub - regions down the length of selected long bones femur (FMR), tibia (TBR), humerus (HMR) and radius (RDR); and, the six vertebrae spina l samples (LS); as well as smaller region of interest (ROI) analyses in areas of high trabecular bone content. Statistical analysis was made of initial repeat test data to determine DXA scanner reliability, establish measurement limits; and assess biologic al variability; and for the specially reared flock, inter - group differences in aBMD were analysed for effect of ovariectomy, and then re - analysed in conjunction with bone quality variables to assess the strength of aBMD and bone quality relationships to me chanical test data. xxiii The results of preliminary studies confirmed an acceptable level of; repeatability (ICC > 0. 9), reliability (%TEM 3 - 5 %) and measurement limits (95 %LOA ? 0. 035 g. cm - 2) of the adapted DXA scanning protocol for large ovine bone samples. In a representative sample of the Irish ewes evaluation of biological variability revealed; an aBMD range of approximately 0. 60 to 1. 20 g. cm - 2, minimal inter - breed variation and a small seasonal effect toward lower density in Spring months at some sites. Ana lysis of inter - group differences between CON and OVX detected no significant difference in aBMD post - ovariectomy at any spinal or long bone site at 12 month; but did detect a significant reduction in aBMD in the proximal humeral region and an unexpected fi nding of increased aBMD in the mid - region of the tibia, both with large effect size, at the 31 month time point. In follow on studies; aBMD (r 2 ~ 0. 83) and then structural geometric properties of CSMI (r 2 ~ 0. 75) and section modulus (r 2 ~ 0. 65) had the stronges t association with breaking strength (Fmax) of ovine radii in three point bending. In microdamage analysis of radii exposed to cyclic loading, and stratified as high, medium or low aBMD, results also suggested significantly higher microcrack numerical and surface density in bones with lower aBMD. Analysis of compressive strength of isolated trabecular cores was less clear, but significant inter - group differences in trabecular thickness of large effect size were detected in the CON vs. OVX comparison at the 31 month time point, and in terms of relationships to strength, trabecular number and spacing (r 2 ~ 0. 4 to 0. 5) were better related to compressive strength and modulus than any DXA or microCT derived bone quantity variable. In conclusion this work has further validated DXA bone quantity measurement and defined measurement limits for scanning and sub - regional analysis of whole bone samples in this animal model. Bone quantity data for Irish s heep were of a similar range to those seen in human female populations, and exhibited some seasonal variation again similar to human populations living in northern latitudes. In this animal model ovariectomy alone however, did not prove a sufficient enough stimulus in the short - term to produce a significant reduction in bone quantity detectable by DXA in time frames suitable for research; however longer term changes detected in the proximal humerus and tibia require further evaluation. In terms of relations hips to strength DXA derived aBMD data was the better predictor of bending strength in a typical long bone mid - shaft site; but in compression of isolated trabecular cores, bone quality factors were more closely associated to mechanical properties...|$|R

Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSC) offer a promising therapeutic option for regeneration of damaged cartilage, due to their self renewing and multi-lineage differentiation attributes. Although some small animal model studies highlight the therapeutic potential of MSC for growth plate repair, translational research in large animal models, which more closely resemble the human condition, are lacking. Our laboratory has recently characterised MSCs derived from ovine bone marrow, and demonstrated these cells form cartilage-like tissue when transplanted within the gelatin sponge, Gelfoam, in vivo. In the current study, autologous bone marrow MSC were seeded into Gelfoam scaffold containing TGF-� 1, and transplanted into a surgically created defect of the proximal ovine tibial growth plate. Examination of implants at 5 week post-operatively revealed transplanted autologous MSC failed to form new cartilage structure at the defect site, but contributed {{to an increase in}} formation of a dense fibrous tissue. Importantly, the extent of osteogenesis was diminished, and bone bridge formation was not accelerated due to transplantation of MSCs or the gelatin scaffold. The current study represents the first work that has utilised this <b>ovine</b> large <b>animal</b> model to investigate whether autologous bone marrow derived MSC can be used to initiate regeneration at the injured growth plate...|$|R

40|$|Biomarkers for {{neurodegenerative}} disorders are potentially present in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) {{and can be}} detected using proteomic technologies. Since CSF is high in salt and low in protein, its study by proteomic methods requires appropriate sample preparation. In this study, we applied four different sample treatments to the same ovine CSF sample. Precipitation with acetone or using a 2 -D Clean-Up Kit (GE Healthcare BioSciences, Little Chalfont, UK) preserved more proteins, and produced more gel spots than spin columns from Sigma and Bio-Rad. A 53 -kDa spot, identified by MS/MS as transthyretin (TTR) tetramer, was not detected in samples treated with the 2 -D Clean-Up Kit, though it was always present on all gels prepared using the other three methods. Western immunoblotting confirmed the low recovery of tetrameric TTR by the 2 -D Clean-Up Kit and showed that the tetrameric form of TTR predominated in ovine but not in rat CSF. In one ovine CSF sample haemoglobin was found, indicating blood contamination. We conclude that acetone precipitation is a simple and efficient way to prepare ovine CSF for 2 -DE. The use of the 2 -D Clean-Up Kit leads to the disappearance of tetrameric TTR <b>only</b> from <b>ovine</b> CSF proteome...|$|R
40|$|Background—Defining the {{arrhythmogenic}} substrate {{is essential}} for successful ablation of scar-related ventricular tachycardia. The visual characteristics of endocardial ischemic scar have not been described in vivo. The goal {{of this study was}} (1) to quantify the visual characteristics of normal tissue, scar border zone, and dense scar in vivo {{with the use of a}} novel endoscopic catheter that allows direct endocardial visualization and (2) to correlate visual attributes of myocardial scar with bipolar voltage. Methods and Results—Percutaneous transient balloon occlusion (150 minutes) of the mid left anterior descending coronary artery was performed in an <b>ovine</b> model. <b>Animals</b> survived for 41. 50. 7 days. Detailed bipolar voltage maps of the left ventricle were acquired with the use of NavX. Video snapshots of the endocardium were acquired at sites distributed throughout the left ventricle. Visual tissue characteristics of normal (1. 5 mV), border (0. 5 – 1. 5 mV), and dense scar (0. 5 mV) were quantified with the use of image processing. Radiofrequency lesions (10 – 20 W, 30 seconds) were delivered under direct visualization. Mean white-threshold pixel area was lowest in normal tissue (189 96941 478 pixels 2), intermediate in scar border zone (255 97936 016 pixels 2), and highest in dense scar (324 45230 152 pixels 2; P 0. 0001 for all pairwise comparisons). Tissue whiteness, characteristic of scar, was inversely correlated with bipolar voltage (P 0. 0001). During radiofrequency lesions, there was a significant increase in white-thresholded pixel area of the visual field after ablation (average increase, 85 38152 618 pixels 2; P 0. 001) ...|$|R
40|$|A importância da espécie suína na transmissão de Campylobacter spp. assemelha-se aos demais grupos de animais que se destinam à produção de carne, incluindo aves, bovinos e ovinos. Os objetivos deste estudo foram isolar Campylobacter spp. a partir de fezes e carcaças de suínos abatidos no Estado de São Paulo; identificar as espécies de Campylobacter spp. presentes nos animais abatidos; caracterizar os isolados obtidos através do Polimorfismo do Comprimento de Fragmentos Amplificados (AFLP). Para tal, foram utilizadas 120 amostras de fezes e 120 suabes de carcaças de suínos, colhidas de quatro diferentes abatedouros do Estado de São Paulo. Das 120 amostras de fezes analisadas, 30 foram positivas para o isolamento de Campylobacter coli (25 %) e duas foram positivas para isolamento de Campylobacter jejuni (1, 6 %). Todas as amostras analisadas de suabes de carcaça foram negativas para Campylobacter spp. As estirpes isoladas que apresentaram características bioquímicas sugestivas de Campylobacter spp. foram submetidas ao teste de susceptibilidade ao ácido nalidixico e cefalotina, destas 19, 16 % (23 / 120) apresentaram resistência ao ácido nalidixico apesar de todas as características bioquímicas indicarem se tratar de Campylobacter coli. Foram selecionadas para a análise genotípica 38 amostras isoladas, sendo 36 de C. coli e dois de C. jejuni. A análise dos isolados através do AFLP revelou a presença de 28 perfis que foram designados P 1 a P 28. A técnica discriminou as cepas de acordo com a espécie, porém, uma cepa previamente caracterizada como C. coli foi agrupada com isolados de C. jejuni. Não foi possível estabelecer a correlação entre os isolados e o abatedouro de origem, no entanto observa-se uma forte tendência dos isolados resistentes ao ácido nalidixico em formar grupamentos de maior similaridade.

From 120 feces samples, 30 (25 %) were positive for Campylobacter coli isolation and two (1, 6 %) were positive for Campylobacter jejuni. All the analyzed carcass swabs samples were negatives for Campylobacter spp. The isolated samples that presented suggestive biochemical characteristics of Campylobacter spp. were submitted to the susceptibility test to the nalidixic acid and cefalotine, from that 19. 16 % (23 / 120) presented resistance to the nalidixic acid {{in spite of all the}} biochemical characteristics indicate that they were Campylobacter coli. They were selected for the genotypic analysis 38 isolated samples, being 36 of C. coli and two of C. jejuni. The analysis of the 38 tested samples by AFLP showed the presence of 28 profiles that had been assigned P 1 to P 28. The technique discriminated the samples in agreement with the species, however, one sample previously characterized as C. coli was clustered as C. jejuni.

40|$|A {{cross-sectional}} {{survey of}} ticks {{was conducted on}} 197 <b>ovine</b> farms with <b>animals</b> pasturing in an area (3971 km 2) of the southern Italian Apennines. The farms were selected to be uniformly distributed throughout the study area using Geographical Information System (GIS). Ticks were collected from 309 (31. 4 %) out of the 985 sheep sampled, belonging to 92 (46. 7 %) out of the 197 farms included in the study. The following tick species were found (farm prevalence) : Dermacentor marginatus (37. 6 %), Haemaphysalis punctata (29. 4 %), H. sulcata (2. 5 %), H. parva (2. 0 %). H. inermis (0. 5 %), Ixodes gibbosus (2. 0 %), I. ricinus (0. 5 %), Rhipicephalus sanguineus group (1. 0 %), and R. bursa (0. 5 %). A point distribution map (PDM) was drawn by GIS in order to display the distribution of each tick genus in the study area. The general trends of the PDM show that Dermacentor marginatus and Haemaphysalis spp. were widely and homogeneously spread throughout the study area, whereas Rhipicephalus spp. and Ixodes spp. were present only in a few concentrated zones {{of the study area}} in accordance to their biological and ecological characteristics...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between modern clinical diagnostic data, such as from radiographs or computed tomography, and the temporal biomechanical integrity of bone fracture healing {{has not been}} well-established. A diagnostic tool that could quantitatively describe the biomechanical stability of the fracture site in order to predict the course of healing would represent a paradigm shift in the way fracture healing is evaluated. This paper describes the development and evaluation of a wireless, biocompatible, implantable, microelectromechanical system (bioMEMS) sensor, and its implementation in a large <b>animal</b> (<b>ovine)</b> model, that utilized both normal and delayed healing variants. The in vivo data indicated that the bioMEMS sensor was capable of detecting statistically significant differences (p-value < 0. 04) between the two fracture healing groups as early as 21 days post-fracture. In addition, post-sacrifice micro-computed tomography, and histology data demonstrated that the two model variants represented significantly different fracture healing outcomes, providing explicit supporting evidence that the sensor {{has the ability to}} predict differential healing cascades. These data verify that the bioMEMS sensor {{can be used as a}} diagnostic tool for detecting the in vivo course of fracture healing in the acute post-treatment period. © 2015 Orthopaedic Research Society.

40|$|Rotavirus {{has been}} {{recognized}} as a predominant cause of acute diarrhea in young animals and humans. Rotavirus has segmented genome composed of 11 segments of double stranded RNA. The virus has a triple layered protein shell consisting of a core, an inner capsid and an outer capsid. The inner capsid protein is responsible for group specificity and based on it rotaviruses are classified into seven groups. Ovine rotavirus strains have only been identified into two serogroups (A and B). The two outer capsid proteins (VP 7 and VP 4) are responsible for G and P typing of rotavirus, respectively. Although rotavirus has been frequently reported in many animal species, data regarding ovine rotavirus strains is very scanty and limited. <b>Only</b> a few <b>ovine</b> rotaviruses have been isolated and characterized so far. Recently, the G and P types circulating in ovines have been identified.

40|$|Background The growing {{awareness}} of transfusion-associated morbidity and mortality necessitates investigations into the underlying mechanisms. Small animals have been the dominant transfusion model but have associated limitations. This study aimed to develop a comprehensive large <b>animal</b> (<b>ovine)</b> model of transfusion encompassing: blood collection, processing and storage, compatibility testing right through to post-transfusion outcomes. Materials and methods Two units of blood were collected from each of 12 adult male Merino sheep and processed into 24 ovine-packed red blood cell (PRBC) units. Baseline haematological parameters of ovine blood and PRBC cells were analysed. Biochemical changes in ovine PRBCs were characterized during the 42 -day storage period. Immunological compatibility of the blood was confirmed with sera from potential recipient sheep, using a saline and albumin agglutination cross-match. Following confirmation of compatibility, each recipient sheep (n = 12) was transfused with two units of ovine PRBC. Results Procedures for collecting, processing, cross-matching and transfusing ovine blood were established. Although ovine red blood cells are smaller and higher in number, their mean cell haemoglobin concentration is similar to human red blood cells. Ovine PRBC showed improved storage properties in saline–adenine–glucose–mannitol (SAG-M) compared with previous human PRBC studies. Seventy-six compatibility tests were performed and 17 · 1...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the regenerative potential of cell-laden and cell-free collagen matri-ces in comparison to microfracture treatment applied to full-thickness chondral defects in an <b>ovine</b> model. Methods: <b>Animals</b> (n = 30) were randomized into 5 treatment groups, and 7 -mm full-cartilage-thickness defects were set at the trochlea and medial condyle of both knee joints and treated as follows: 2 scaffolds in comparison (collagen I/III, Chondro-Gide®; collagen II, Chondrocell®) for covering microfractured defects (autologous matrix-induced chondrogen-esis), both scaffolds colonized in vitro with autologous chondrocytes (matrix-associated chondrocyte transplantation), or scaffold-free microfracture technique. One year after surgery, cartilage lesions were biomechanically (indentation test), his-tologically (O’Driscoll score), and immunohistochemically (collagen type I and II staining) evaluated. Results: All treatment groups of the animal model induced more repair tissue and showed better histological scores and biomechanical proper-ties compared to controls. The average thickness of the repair tissue was significantly greater when a scaffold was used, especially the collagen I/III membrane. However, none of the index procedures surpassed the others from a biomechanical point of view or based on the histological scoring. Collagen type II expression was better in condylar defects compared to the trochlea, especially in those treated with collagen I/III membranes. Conclusion: Covering of defects with suitable matrices promotes repair tissue formation and is suggested to be a promising treatment option for cartilage defects. However, i...|$|R
