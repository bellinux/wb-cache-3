5000|$|Electric {{locomotives}} {{usually have}} a continuous and a <b>one-hour</b> <b>rating.</b> The <b>one-hour</b> <b>rating</b> is the maximum power that the motors can continuously develop over a one hour period without overheating the motors. Such a test starts with the motors at +25 °C (and the outside air used for ventilation also at +25 °C). In the USSR per GOST 2582-72 with class N insulation, the maximum temperatures allowed for DC motors were 160 °C for the armature, 180 °C for the stator, and 105 °C for the collector.

40|$|In {{order to}} meet the requirements, {{documented}} by the GOES user communities, the instruments designated for the GOES-R notional baseline include an Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI), a Hyperspectral Environmental Suite (HES), a lightning mapper, and advanced space and solar observing instruments. The Advanced Baseline Imager is a state of the art, 16 -channel imager covering 6 visible to near-IR bands (0. 47, 0. 64, 0. 86, 1. 38, 1. 61, and 2. 26 µm) and 10 infrared (IR) bands (3. 90 µm to 13. 3 µm). Spatial resolutions are band dependent, 0. 5 km at nadir for broadband visible, 1. 0 km for near IR and 2. 0 km for IR. The ABI will scan the Full Disk (FD) in approximately 5 minutes. The HES is a multi channel imager and sounder instrument suite with three threshold tasks. HES will provide high-spectral resolution Hemispheric Disk Soundings (DS) and Severe Weather Mesoscale (SW/M) soundings and Coastal Waters (CW) imaging. HES DS provides 10 km IR resolution from 3. 7 µm to 15. 4 µm with a <b>one-hour</b> refresh <b>rate</b> of the full disk...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{attempted}} to determine changes occurring with time in fetal {{heart rate and}} its variation in fetuses with intrauterine growth retardation in whom late antepartum fetal heart rate decelerations eventually develop. STUDY DESIGN: Thirteen fetuses with intrauterine growth retardation were studied over a median period of 25 days. <b>One-hour</b> fetal heart <b>rate</b> records were made two to five times per week and were analyzed numerically. Fetal movements were recorded by the women. RESULTS: On average long-term fetal heart rate variation decreased gradually with time and fell below the norm (30 milliseconds) {{at about the same}} time decelerations appeared. Mean heart rate showed a slight but statistically significant increase after the occurrence of declerations. There were large interfetal differences in all parameters studied. CONCLUSION: In fetuses with intrauterine growth retardation a decrease in long-term fetal heart rate variation is a rather late sign of impairment that coincides with the occurrence of late decelerations. In the surveillance of the fetus with intrauterine growth retardation it might be most appropriate to use each fetus as its own control...|$|R
40|$|Sex, age and 21 routine liver {{function}} assays {{were analyzed by}} stepwise selection and the best-of-all-possible-combinations method to identify {{a small group of}} assays valuable in establishing which liver cirrhosis (LC) patients have a high risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), when alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is not elevated. Data was obtained from 115 HCC and 122 LC patients on admission. Tumor size correlated with AFP (0. 73), alkaline phosphatase (ALP, 0. 47), leucine aminopeptidase (LAP, 0. 42), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH, 0. 42), and the glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT) /glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT) ratio (GOT/GPT, 0. 41). The mean of the correct diagnosis rates (CDR) of HCC and LC utilizing AFP as the sole parameter (89 %) was markedly higher than those of the other parameters. The best-of-all-possible-combinations method presented a more powerful combination than stepwise selection. The best combination of 7 parameters (LAP, GOT/GPT, choline esterase, <b>one-hour</b> erythrocyte sedimentation <b>rate,</b> age, albumin/globulin ratio, and total bilirubin) presented a mean CDR of 80 %, HCC CDR of 77 %, and false positive rate of 18 %. LC patients statistically diagnosed as having HCC by these 7 parameters are proposed as high risk patients. Fourteen (78 %) of 18 HCC patients who were AFP-negative were statistically diagnosed. This analysis can be applied to LC patients to distinguish those that should be followed closely by imaging diagnostic techniques. </p...|$|R
40|$|Due {{to their}} {{vulnerability}} to high temperatures, steel structures are typically protected against fire by insulation materials, {{as recommended by}} fire codes. The fire resistance rating of a protected member is determined based on a standard fire test, which simulates post-flashover fire conditions. Empirical evidence has shown that fires in large open-plan compartments do not burn uniformly, and a method called “traveling fire” has been introduced in previous research to simulate the effects of spreading fires. An investigation is performed here to examine the robustness of a generic four-story moment-resisting steel structure with <b>one-hour</b> fire resistance <b>rating</b> subjected to travelling fire. Various fire sizes are considered: 12. 5, 25, 50 and 100 % of the floor area. The results show that while no collapse occurs during the 12. 5, 50 and 100 % fire sizes, the structure collapses under the 25 % fire size at 85 min due to {{the inability of the}} system to transfer the load after one of the columns buckles. This seems to be in contradiction with traditional belief that a fire covering a larger portion of the floor plan would reduce the safety margin. The investigation performed underlines that the fire protection of structures based on the standard time-temperature curve does not necessarily provide adequate resistance under travelling fires. With the lack of adequate fire regulations codified for large compartments, more research is required before arriving at {{a better understanding of the}} application of travelling fire to large compartment...|$|R
5000|$|To prevent dust {{explosions and}} fires, {{employers}} must (among other things):Develop {{and implement a}} written housekeeping program with instructions to reduce dust accumulations on ledges, floors, equipment and other exposed surfaces.Identify [...] "priority" [...] housekeeping areas in grain elevators. The [...] "priority" [...] housekeeping areas include floor areas within 35 feet of inside bucket elevators, floors of enclosed areas containing grinding equipment and floors of enclosed areas containing grain dryers located inside the facility. Dust accumulations in these priority housekeeping areas shall not exceed 1/8th inch. Employers should {{make every effort to}} minimize dust accumulations on exposed surfaces since dust is the fuel for a fire or explosion, and it is recognized that a 1/8 inch dust accumulation is more than enough to fuel such occurrences.Inside bucket elevators can undergo primary explosions. OSHA's grain handling standard requires that belts for these bucket elevators purchased after March 30, 1988 are conductive and have a surface electrical resistance not exceeding 300 megohms. Bucket elevators must have an opening to the head pulley section and boot section to allow for inspection, maintenance, and cleaning. Bearings must be mounted externally to the leg casing or the employer must provide vibration, temperature, or other monitoring of the conditions of the bearings if the bearings are mounted inside or partially inside the leg casing. These bucket elevators must be equipped with a motion detection device which will shut-down the elevator when the belt speed is reduced by no more than 20% of the normal operating speed.Implement a preventative maintenance program with regularly scheduled inspections for mechanical and safety control equipment, which may include heat producing equipment such as motors, bearings, belts etc. Preventive maintenance is critical to controlling ignition sources. The use of vibration detection methods, heat sensitive tape or other heat detection methods can help in the implementation of the program.Minimize ignition sources through controlling hot work (electric or gas welding, cutting, brazing or similar flame producing operations).Install wiring and electrical equipment suitable for hazardous locations.Design and properly locate dust collection systems to minimize explosion hazards. All filter collectors installed after March 1988 shall be located outside the facility or located in an area inside the facility protected by an explosion suppression system or located in an area that is separated from other areas by construction having at least a <b>one-hour</b> fire resistance <b>rating</b> and which is located next to an exterior wall vented to the outside.Install an effective means of removing ferrous material from grain streams so that such material does not enter equipment such as hammer mills, grinders and pulverizers.|$|R
