5|$|The work {{consists}} <b>of</b> <b>three</b> <b>sections,</b> an introduction, {{a central}} section that details the trial itself, and a conclusion. The introduction and conclusion summarise St-Calais' career {{before and after}} the trial. Although the authenticity of the main account has been challenged in the past, most historians consider it a contemporary record of the trial. Six manuscripts containing the work survive, and it was first printed in 1655, with other editions, including translations, appearing after that.|$|E
5|$|An {{independent}} {{company at}} this time had a nominal strength of 20 officers and 275 other ranks. Larger than a conventional infantry company, it was organised into three platoons, each <b>of</b> <b>three</b> <b>sections,</b> each of which contained two subsections. It had considerable firepower. Each subsection had a Bren light machine gun. The gunner's two assistants carried rifles and extra 30-round Bren magazines. A sniper also carried a rifle, as did one man equipped with rifle grenades. The remaining four or five men carried Owen submachine guns. Each platoon also had a section of 2-inch mortars.|$|E
5|$|The chelicerae ("claw horns") {{that give}} the sub-phylum its name {{normally}} consist <b>of</b> <b>three</b> <b>sections,</b> and the claw is formed by the third section and a rigid extension of the second. However, spiders' have only two sections, and the second forms a fang that folds away behind the first when not in use. The relative sizes of chelicerae vary widely: those of some fossil eurypterids and modern harvestmen form large claws that extended ahead of the body, while scorpions' are tiny pincers {{that are used in}} feeding and project only slightly in front of the head.|$|E

The Armenian army was formed <b>of</b> <b>three</b> <b>sections.</b> Two of Tigranes' vassal kings led the left and right flanks, while Tigranes led his cataphracts in the center. The rest of his army stood in front of a hill, a position Lucullus soon exploited.|$|E
5|$|The thorax is a tagma {{composed}} <b>of</b> <b>three</b> <b>sections,</b> the prothorax, mesothorax and the metathorax. The anterior segment, {{closest to}} the head, is the prothorax, with the major features being the first pair of legs and the pronotum. The middle segment is the mesothorax, with the major features being the second pair of legs and the anterior wings. The third and most posterior segment, abutting the abdomen, is the metathorax, which features the third pair of legs and the posterior wings. Each segment is dilineated by an intersegmental suture. Each segment has four basic regions. The dorsal surface is called the tergum (or notum) to distinguish it from the abdominal terga. The two lateral regions are called the pleura (singular: pleuron) and the ventral aspect is called the sternum. In turn, the notum of the prothorax is called the pronotum, the notum for the mesothorax is called the mesonotum and the notum for the metathorax is called the metanotum. Continuing with this logic, the mesopleura and metapleura, {{as well as the}} mesosternum and metasternum, are used.|$|E

25|$|San Miguel Xicalco {{is located}} {{just off the}} Mexico City-Cuernavaca highway. Xicalco comes from Nahuatl and means “house of grass” or “house of plants.” San Miguel is {{in honor of the}} Archangel Michael, the patron saint, who is said to have {{appeared}} here. The center of the small community is a chapel from the 17th century, which has one nave, <b>of</b> <b>three</b> <b>sections</b> and a presbytery. The image of Michael inside is made of cornstalk paste. Michael is honored twice a year here, on 8 May, when he is said to have appeared and on 29 September, his usual feast day. These days are traditionally celebrated with mole rojo (red mole sauce), tamales, Chinelos, other indigenous and folk dance as well as traditional music. Another story from the area is that during the Mexican Revolution, Zapatista troops took control of the small church to use as a headquarters. Today, there is a small cannon which {{is said to have been}} left by these troops.|$|E

500|$|Lake James is a glacial lake {{located in}} the northeastern {{corner of the state}} of Indiana. The lake {{occupies}} an area west of Interstate highway 69 in Indiana's Steuben County, which borders Michigan and Ohio. The city of Angola is located about [...] southeast of the lake's southern tip. [...] The northern half of Lake James is in the county's Jamestown Township, while the southern half is located in Pleasant Township. [...] The lake consists <b>of</b> <b>three</b> <b>sections</b> called the First, Second, and Third Basins, where the First Basin is the southernmost and the Third Basin is the northernmost of the three. [...] Snow Lake lies {{on the north side of}} the Third (northern) Basin.

The second section was made up of nineteen rocket motors from the 3-inch Rocket Projectile - essentially metal tubes filled with cordite. In the third rear section, a tail cone contained the circuit that ignited the rockets. This was powered by a small generator with a vane spun by the airstream going past the falling bomb. Rocket ignition was controlled either by a time-delay switch, or a barometric switch. There were six small fins {{at the rear of the}} bomb for its stabilisation. The bomb was suspended from the aircraft by two weight-bearing lugs. Three arming wires also connected the bomb and the aircraft; as the bomb dropped, a brief tug from the wires would arm the warhead fuzes and the rocket-ignition circuit, and unlock the electrical generator, allowing it to spin freely.|$|E
