5|$|Some sexually {{transmitted}} diseases are communicable between women, including human papillomavirus (HPV)—specifically genital warts—squamous intraepithelial lesions, trichomoniasis, syphilis, and herpes simplex virus (HSV). Transmission of specific {{sexually transmitted}} diseases among women {{who have sex with}} women depends <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sexual</b> practices women engage in. Any object that comes in contact with cervical secretions, vaginal mucosa, or menstrual blood, including fingers or penetrative objects may transmit {{sexually transmitted diseases}}. Orogenital contact may indicate a higher risk of acquiring HSV, even among women who have had no prior sex with men.|$|E

Hite's questions differed from Kinsey's, focusing more on how women identified, or what they preferred rather than experience. Respondents to Hite's questions indicated that 8% preferred sex with women and 9% answered that they identified as bisexual or had sexual experiences with men and women, though they refused to indicate preference.|$|E

5|$|Edward's {{life has}} also been used {{in a wide variety}} of other media. The {{director}} David Bintley used Marlowe's play as the basis for the ballet Edward II, first performed in 1995; the music from the ballet forms a part of composer John McCabe's symphony Edward II, produced in 2000. Novels such as John Penford's 1984 The Gascon and Chris Hunt's 1992 Gaveston have focused <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sexual</b> aspects of Edward and Gaveston's relationship, while Stephanie Merritt's 2002 Gaveston transports the story into the 20th century. Marcus Stone's painting Edward II and Piers Gaveston strongly hinted at a homosexual relationship between the pair, while avoiding making this aspect explicit; it was initially shown at the Royal Academy in 1872, but was marginalised in later decades as the issue of homosexuality became more sensitive.|$|E
5|$|Homosexual men {{tended to}} have had their first {{homosexual}} encounter at a younger age, {{and were more likely}} to have their first encounters with friends or acquaintances rather than strangers. The data did not support the idea that homosexual males are likely to have been seduced by older men. Homosexual activity involving genital contact in childhood was connected to adult homosexuality, though only weakly; homosexual arousal during childhood or adolescence was a stronger predictor of adult homosexuality. Heterosexual arousal during childhood was a moderate predictor of adult heterosexuality. Phenomena associated with sexual maturation, such as the age of first ejaculation, did not seem to be important, and neither did parental attitudes toward sex. Respondents' opportunities to engage in sex with persons of the opposite or the same sex did not seem to be an important influence <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sexual</b> preference they developed, and sexual experiences with persons of both the same and the opposite sex were common among both homosexuals and heterosexuals. Sexual feelings appeared to be more important than sexual behavior as an indicator of adult sexual preference.|$|E

25|$|Another {{trend of}} novels having {{emphasis}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sexual</b> behaviours and deviations {{of the characters}} began to mark its own place during the sixties.

25|$|Based on {{the current}} {{theories}} and research <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sexual</b> division of labor, four critical aspects of hunter‐gatherer socioecology led to the evolutionary origin of the SDL in humans: (1) long‐term dependency on high‐cost offspring, (2) optimal dietary mix of mutually exclusive foods, (3) efficient foraging based on specialized skill, and (4) sex‐differentiated comparative advantage in tasks. These combined conditions are rare in nonhuman vertebrates but common to currently-existing populations of human foragers, which, thus, {{gives rise to a}} potential factor for the evolutionary divergence of social behaviors in Homo.|$|E
25|$|Opposition due to {{the safety}} of the vaccine has been {{addressed}} through studies, leaving opposition focused <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sexual</b> implications of the vaccine to remain. Conservative groups in the U.S. have opposed the concept of making HPV vaccination mandatory for pre-adolescent girls, asserting that making the vaccine mandatory is a violation of parental rights. They also say that it will lead to early sexual activity, giving a false sense of immunity to sexually transmitted disease. (See Peltzman effect) Both the Family Research Council and the group Focus on the Family support widespread (universal) availability of HPV vaccines but oppose mandatory HPV vaccinations for entry to public school. Parents also express confusion over recent mandates for entry to public school pointing out that HPV is transmitted through sexual contact, not through attending school with other children.|$|E

25|$|About {{one third}} of the women {{experienced}} sexual dysfunction, which may lead to women's loss of confidence in their sexual lives. Since these women had sexual problems, their sexual lives with their partners became a burden without pleasure, and eventually, they may completely lose interest in sexual activity. Some of the women found it hard to be aroused mentally; however, some had physical problems. Several factors can affect female dysfunction, such as situations in which women do not trust their sex partners. The environment where sex occurs is crucial, since being in an extremely public or extremely private place may make some women feel uncomfortable. Inability to concentrate <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sexual</b> activity due to a bad mood or burdens from work may also cause a woman's sexual dysfunction. Other factors include physical discomfort or difficulty in achieving arousal, which could be caused by aging or changes in the body's condition.|$|E
25|$|A non-representative survey <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sexual</b> {{behaviour}} of American students {{published in}} 1997 {{and based on}} questionnaires had {{a response rate of}} about 8–9%. Its results showed 15% of homosexual and bisexual males, 21% of lesbian and female bisexual students, 11% of heterosexual males and 9% of female heterosexual students committed to BDSM related fantasies. In all groups the level of practical BDSM experiences were around 6%. Within the group of openly lesbian and bisexual females the quote was significantly higher, at 21%. Independent of their sexual orientation, about 12% of all questioned students, 16% of lesbians and female bisexuals and 8% of heterosexual males articulated an interest in spanking. Experience with this sexual behaviour was indicated by 30% of male heterosexuals, 33% of female bisexuals and lesbians, and 24% of the male gay and bisexual men and female heterosexual women. Even though this study was not considered representative, other surveys indicate similar dimensions in a differing target groups.|$|E

Likewise, another reviewer found it [...] "an engaging and disturbing one-night read that's all the more astonishing because Vachss manages to explore and make his points about a wholly depressing topic without driving your moods into the sewer." [...] Roger Catlin in the Hartford Courant said [...] "Vachss' bold, simple prose is well suited to his story. He's good at making Batman's various devices — the Batmobile, computers, flying gizmos — come to life with his cool description." ...|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Mark Blasius, Millett was sympathetic {{to the concept of}} intergenerational sex, describing age of consent laws as [...] "very oppressive" [...] to gay male youth in particular but repeatedly reminding the interviewer that the question cannot rest <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sexual</b> access of older men or women to children but a rethinking of children's rights broadly understood. Millett added that [...] "one of children's essential rights is to express themselves sexually, probably primarily with each other but with adults as well" [...] and that [...] "the sexual freedom of children {{is an important part of}} a sexual revolution ... if you don't change the social condition of children you still have an inescapable inequality". In this interview, Millett criticized those who wished to abolish age of consent laws, saying the issue was not focused on children's rights but [...] "being approached as the right of men to have sex with kids below the age of consent" [...] and added that [...] "no mention is made of relationships between women and girls".|$|E
500|$|In Brokeback Mountain, Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger play {{young men}} who meet as sheep herders and embark upon a sexual {{relationship}} that begins {{in the summer of}} 1963 and lasts for 20 years.

The film won the Golden Lion prize at the Venice Film Festival. The film went on to win four Golden Globe Awards, four British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) Awards, and three Academy Awards. Gyllenhaal was nominated for an Academy Award in the category of Best Supporting Actor for his performance but lost to George Clooney for Syriana. Gyllenhaal also won the Best Supporting Actor BAFTA for the same role and received a Best Supporting Actor nomination and Best Film Ensemble nomination from the Screen Actors Guild.

500|$|Literary critic Tom McCarthy {{believed}} that The Calculus Affair aptly illustrated how Tintin {{was no longer}} political in the manner {{that he was in}} earlier works like Tintin in the Land of the Soviets (1930) and Tintin in the Congo (1931); instead, Tintin travels to Borduria to rescue Calculus, [...] "not to fight or expose totalitarianism". Calculus became [...] "a genius compromised", with his role being a [...] "counter-position to, or flip-side of, the one he represented in the moon books". When Tintin and Haddock arrive in Borduria, they are [...] "treated as honoured guests but are in fact prisoners of the police state", a reversal of the situation in The Blue Lotus in which Tintin believes himself a prisoner but is in fact a guest. As with The Crab with the Golden Claws (1941), The Calculus Affair was [...] "one long tobacco-trail" [...] with cigarettes representing clues throughout the story. As for the opera house scene in which Tintin and Haddock spy upon Sponsz and Castafiore, he compared it to the scene in David Lynch's 1986 film Blue Velvet in which Jeffrey Beaumont spies <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sexual</b> activities of Dorothy Vallens and Frank Booth.|$|E

Jocelyn Vena from MTV described the vocal delivery and lyrical content of the song as [...] "sassy". Lamb as said that [...] "lyrically, [...] amounts to romantic, sexual sweet nothings". Rihanna called the collaboration [...] "young and playful", something which Stacy Anderson from Spin and Nick Levine of Digital Spy both picked up, when commenting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sexual</b> innuendos in the lyrics.
