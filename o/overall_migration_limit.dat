In this article the structure, thermal and mechanical properties of some commercial grades of ethylene/propene copolymers produced by heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta (ZN) catalysis, have been characterized. These grades can be potentially used for manufacturing food containers. However, despite the desired performances in terms of mechanical and optical properties, {{we found that the}} samples exceed the <b>overall</b> <b>migration</b> <b>limit</b> set by the EU Directive into isooctane, used as fatty food simulant. The migrating species are highly defective copolymer chains with low molecular mass and high ethylene content. The migration is intrinsically related to the presence of fractions generated by the heterogeneous multisite surface of the ZN catalysts. A simple chemical route to allow the iPP-based materials to fall within the <b>overall</b> <b>migration</b> <b>limit</b> is proposed...|$|E

Morphological investigations revealed the good distribution of silver nanoparticles in PLA ternary systems. The combination of s-CNC and Ag nanoparticles increased the barrier effect of the produced films while the results of overall migration for the PLA nano-biocomposites revealed that none of the samples exceeded the <b>overall</b> <b>migration</b> <b>limit,</b> since results were well below 60 mg kg− 1 of simulant.

Conventionally this is carried out by experimental migration testing. In this study a survey of overall and specific migration from 34 PET bottle types from German PET bottle manufactures and German beverage industry was performed and compared to rapid extraction tests as well as mathematical migration modelling. In all cases overall and specific migration was close to or below the detection limits of the analytical methods.

The release of carbon nanoparticles from the film was studied at varying time–temperature conditions and simulants. Migrants in simulant solvents were examined with laser diffraction analysis and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Film integrity {{and the presence of}} migrants on the film surfaces were visualised by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The partial dissolution of PLA polymer in the solvents was confirmed by swelling tests and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Nanoparticle migrants were not detected in the simulants (at the LOD 0. 020 μm of the laser diffraction analysis) after migration testing at 40 °C for 10 days. However, high-temperature migration testing at 90 °C for 4 h provoked a release of GNPs from the film into ethanol, acetic acid and oil-based food simulants. Short carbon nanotubes were observed rarely to release in the most aggressive acetic acid solvent. Obviously, the enhanced molecular mobility at temperatures above the glass transition and partial dissolution of PLA polymer by the food simulant facilitate the diffusion processes. Moreover, shape, size and concentration of nanoparticles play a significant role. Flexible naked GNPs (lateral size 100 – 1000 nm) easily migrate when the polymer molecules exhibit enhanced mobility, while fibrous MWCNTs (> 1 μm length) formed entangled networks on the film surfaces as the PLA polymer is partly dissolved, preventing their release into food simulants. The impurities of fullerenes and CB (5 – 30 nm) were of minor concentration in the polymer, therefore their migration is low or undetectable. The total amount of released migrants is below <b>overall</b> <b>migration</b> <b>limits...</b>|$|R

In particular, sealable multi-layer PLA/clay nanocomposite systems with different layouts in terms of composition and relative thickness of the layers, all consisting of a PLA/clay nanocomposite layer between two pure PLA layers for direct food contact, were designed and produced by blown film co-extrusion. The films which were obtained were analysed for their morphology, functional properties and lactic acid specific migration in 50 % ethanol. The results showed that, with respect to the unfilled multi-layer system, taken as reference, the nanocomposite ones had significant improvements, up to ca. 40 %, in their barrier to oxygen and tensile strength values, and resulted in being more easily sealable over a wide heat sealing temperature range (80 °C- 100 °C) with higher seal strength.

40|$|International {{audience}} 37 {{samples of}} different silicone baking moulds were characterized concerning potential migrating substances using 1 H-NMR, RP-HPLC-UV/ELSD and GC techniques. In all cases cyclic organosiloxane oligomers with the formula [Si(CH 3) 2 -O]n {{have been identified}} (n = 6 [...] . 50). Additionally, linear, partly hydroxyl-terminated organosiloxanes HO-[Si(CH 3) 2 -O]n-H (n = 7 [...] . 20) {{have been found in}} 13 samples. No other substances than siloxanes could be observed, meaning the migrants mainly consist of organopolysiloxanes. Based on this knowledge, a 1 H-NMR quantification method for siloxanes was established working both for analysis of simulants and foodstuffs. Validation data of the 1 H-NMR method gave a suitable performance: limit of detection 8. 7 mg kg- 1 oil, coefficient of variation 7. 8 % (1. 0 mg kg- 1 food). Further experiments implied migration studies with simulants (olive oil, isooctane, ethanol (95 %), Tenax) as well as different preparation of cakes. Siloxane migration into cake was only slightly decreasing from 1 st to 10 th experiment with a significant dependence on fat content. Thereby migration values never exceeded an amount of 21 mg kg- 1 (3 mg dm- 2) and were therefore well below the <b>overall</b> <b>migration</b> <b>limit</b> of 60 mg kg- 1 (10 mg dm- 2).

Similar results were achieved when using 50 % ethanol as the official simulant for milk-based products as defined in the Plastics Directive 2007 / 19 /EEC. After solvent extraction of the moulds simulating long term usage, no further migration into the food was detectable, indicating that there is no relevant formation of low molecular weight, potentially migrating siloxanes from the elastomer. During repeated usage the investigated moulds showed a high uptake of fat during the use of up to 8. 0 g fat per kg elastomer.

All of the products intended for stove-top use had a polymer coating containing PTFE. The coatings were analysed as purchased and after heating at 250 °C for 30 minutes to simulate actual conditions of use. Total solvent extractables were measured and the overall migration was determined into simulants. None of the products exceeded a draft <b>overall</b> <b>migration</b> <b>limit</b> of 10 mg/dm 2.

40|$|AbstractThere is {{potential}} for oral exposure of humans to styrene (ST) such as from migration of residual levels in polystyrene food containers. After absorption, ST is metabolised to styrene- 7, 8 -oxide (SO), an alkylating epoxide. Hence, {{a comparison of}} blood burdens of SO resulting from oral exposures to ST was made with SO burdens possibly warranting genotoxic concern. A validated physiological toxicokinetic model {{was used for the}} assessment. Model calculations predicted for exposures to ST that maximum concentrations of SO in venous blood of rats and humans should not exceed 0. 33 μg/ml and 0. 036 μg/ml, respectively, because of saturation of the SO formation from ST. The daily area under the concentration-time curve of SO in venous blood (AUCSO) was directly proportional to the dose of ST (mg/kg body weight; BW), independent of the exposure route (inhalation or oral exposure). In resting humans, the daily AUCSO was about half that in rats at the same amount of ST/kg BW (calculated up to 100 mg ST/kg BW in humans). Taking into account the results of cytogenetic studies in ST-exposed rats, it was deduced that no genotoxic effects of SO are to be expected in ST-exposed humans, at least up to a daily amount of 100 mg ST/kg BW, which is equivalent to 100 times the amount originating from the <b>Overall</b> <b>Migration</b> <b>Limit</b> in the EU for ST migrating from food contact plastics. Therefore, no potential genotoxic concern is predicted for ST uptake from food packaging, based on the reported combined measured and modelled data...|$|E

Chemical additives are added in the material composition {{in order to have}} flexible hoses. The contact between foods and plastics needs to control the contamination risk. The European Union edits a regulation 10 / 2011 which must be followed by suppliers specifying the maximum values of <b>Overall</b> <b>Migration</b> <b>Limit</b> (OML) and Specify Migration Limit (SML) of each species established for food in static conditions. However, for food transported through tubes, the migration of additives requires to study the mass transfer in dynamic conditions. According the European directives, mathematical modeling is allowed to demonstrate the compliance with the EU regulation 10 / 2011. A numerical model, detailed in this contribution, coupling the diffusion process in plastic with the transport in food has been developed. It is decomposed in two sub-problems: i) the first describes the unsteady diffusion of a plasticizer in the tube, ii) the second is devoted to the advection and diffusion in the liquid, called Graetz problem. For the second problem, the mass transfer coefficient from the wall to the liquid can be easily determined {{as a function of the}} Graetz number which is a dimensionless group equivalent to a Péclet number. The first problem is numerically solved by a pseudo-spectral Chebyshev method. The coupling between the two sub-problems are achieved by the boundary conditions. The temporal evolution of the plasticizer migration are computed as a function of the ratio of the additive diffusion coefficient in the plastic matrix to the diffusion coefficient in the liquid, the partition coefficient (ratio of the additive mass concentration in the liquid to the mass concentration in the plastic matrix at the plastic/liquid interface) and the Graetz number. The effect of the flow regime, laminar or turbulent, is evaluated. Conversely to the static conditions, the concentration of plasticizer at the exit of the tube decreases with time due to the renewing of the liquid showing that the compliance with the EU regulation 10 / 2011 can be fulfilled if the residence time of the liquid in the tube is controlled...|$|E
40|$|For {{measuring}} {{the migration from}} polymers a rapid solvent extraction method {{based on the principle}} of swelling the polymeric matrix has been developed. The method uses a solvent (ethanol or isooctane) of the same polarity as the polymer that is to be extracted. The applicability of this "rapid solvent extraction method" which has already been proven suitable for <b>overall</b> <b>migration</b> from polyolefins - using isooctane as a swelling agent in this case - was further evaluated for polyamide plastics. Migration kinetics with isooctane and ethanol were measured. Kinetic results showed that ethanol is swelling polyamide and leads to maximum total migration values after a few hours at 40 °C. Kinetics with isooctane showed that even after 10 days at 40 °C, migration values far below the ethanol values. This indicates that the determination of the migrant concentration in the polyamide polymer using rapid ethanol-extraction can be used as an alternative quick approach for otherwise time-consuming (specific) migration testing. The obtained results show that the "rapid solvent extraction method" is also working with the polyamide polymer. Examples will be given for <b>overall</b> <b>migration</b> values and also for migration of specific compounds from polyamide materials. The data also support the application of the so called "QM/SML-Concept" which reduces the amount of actual testing which is necessary to ensure the conformity of polymeric food packaging materials with specific <b>migration</b> <b>limits</b> (SML) laid down by legislation. The principle of this concept is to measure the quantity of a specific migrant in the polymer (QM) by an appropriate extraction method and to calculate its specific migration value using a scientifically acknowledged mathematical model...|$|R

40|$|Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) {{is widely}} used as a {{packaging}} material {{for all kinds of}} foodstuff. Low diffusivity of the polymer combined with the limited number of additives and their low concentrations lead to very <b>limited</b> mass transfer (<b>migration)</b> of monomers, catalysts, or impurities from the PET polymer into food. This mass transfer (migration) for monomers, oligomers, catalysts, additives and non-intentionally added substances (NIAS) is discussed within this study. Based on the data given in the scientific literature it could be concluded that <b>overall</b> <b>migration</b> tests as well as specific migration tests for monomers and catalysts, like ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, terephthalic acid, iso-phthalic acid and antimony are superfluous, because their <b>migration</b> <b>limits</b> cannot be exceeded, even if worst case conditions and swelling simulants like 95 % ethanol are applied.

The migration patterns of smallmouth have been tracked {{and it is not}} unusual for a smallmouth to travel 12 miles in a single day in a stream, creek or river. The <b>overall</b> <b>migration</b> can exceed 60 miles.|$|R
50|$|Directive 2002/72/EC {{establishes}} a specific <b>migration</b> <b>limit</b> for ESBO of 60 mg/kg. However {{in the case}} of infant formula and follow-on formula as defined by Directive 91/321/EEC or products containing processed cereal-based foods and baby foods for infants and young children as defined by Directive 96/5/EC, the SML is lowered to 30 mg/kg. This is because babies have higher ratio of food consumption per body weight.|$|R
50|$|The coating on furnishings, cookware, {{pharmaceutical}} pills, food wrappers {{and many}} other products may have DIDP or other phthalates in them. There has been recent concern in the USA and European Union for their toxicity and bioaccumulative quality. The European Union has set a maximum specific <b>migration</b> <b>limit</b> from food contact materials of 9 mg/kg food for the sum of diisodecyl phthalates and diisononyl phthalates.|$|R
50|$|Between 1987-96, a {{fundamental}} change in New Zealand’s immigration policy led to a substantial influx of ethnic Chinese business, investor, and professional migrants, particularly from Hong Kong and Taiwan. This period saw a spike in <b>overall</b> <b>migration</b> from the Asian region, including other Chinese people from East Asia and Southeast Asia. New Zealand's immigration system increasingly experienced the impact of global events, such as the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 and the May 1998 riots of Indonesia in which many Chinese were affected.|$|R
30|$|The <b>overall</b> <b>migration</b> from {{leaf litter}} to {{streambed}} upon water flow reduction as observed on family level [5] {{could not be}} confirmed on OTU level. Except for OTU 1, there is no overlap of OTUs decreasing in the leaf litter and increasing in the streambed upon flow reduction. It cannot be ultimately excluded that the analysis was insufficient in detecting a migration of OTUs, but the results strongly suggest that the stressor pattern on family level {{does not reflect the}} responses of single OTUs.|$|R
40|$|We present {{simulation}} results {{based on a}} phase-field model that describes the migration of recrystallization boundaries into spatially varying deformation energy fields. Energy fields with 2 -dimensional variations representing 2 sets of dislocation boundaries lying at equal, but opposite, angles to the moving boundary are considered. The simulations show that the shape and <b>overall</b> <b>migration</b> rate of the recrystallization front is considerably affected by spatial variations in the deformation microstructure. It is seen that, depending on characteristics of the variations in the deformation microstructure, highly asymmetrical protrusions and retrusions can develop on the migrating recrystallization front resulting in a migration velocity considerably larger than that expected from standard recrystallization models. It is also seen that, when the wavelength of the variations in a deformation microstructure along the grain boundary {{is larger than the}} wavelength of the variations in the direction of migration, parts of the boundary show a stop-and-go type of migration, resulting in a lower <b>overall</b> <b>migration</b> rate. These simulations thus reproduce and explain many of the typical features observed in recrystallization experiments. They give new insights in the way deformation microstructures can affect the migration behavior of recrystallization boundaries and can lead to a stop-and-go type of migration of the recrystallization boundary even in pure materials. status: publishe...|$|R
