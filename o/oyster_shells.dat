He assisted Robert Edmond Grant's investigations of the anatomy and life cycle of marine invertebrates in the Firth of Forth, and on 27 March 1827 presented at the Plinian his own discovery that black spores found in <b>oyster</b> <b>shells</b> were the eggs of a skate leech. One day, Grant praised Lamarck's evolutionary ideas. Darwin was astonished by Grant's audacity, but had recently read similar ideas in his grandfather Erasmus' journals.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the calcium (Ca) absorption efficacy of king oyster mushroom (Pleurotus eryngii) grown on sawdust medium supplemented with Ca-sources, including <b>oyster</b> <b>shell</b> powder, and to determine the efficacy of <b>oyster</b> <b>shell</b> powder as a calcium supplement on growth, yield, spawn run and primordial formation of P. eryngii. Optimum calcination of <b>oyster</b> <b>shell</b> powder was achieved at the temperature of 620. 56 °C. A 1 % supplementation of <b>oyster</b> <b>shell</b> powder in sawdust medium did not suppress the mycelial growth of P. eryngii. Also the supplementation of 2 % calcinated <b>oyster</b> <b>shell</b> powder to sawdust medium potentially increased the calcium content up to a level of 315. 7 ± 15. 7 mg/ 100 g in the fruiting body of P. eryngii, without extension of duration of spawn run and the retardation of the days to primordial formation. These results suggest that the shellfish by-products, including <b>oyster</b> <b>shell</b> powder, can be utilized to develop calcium enriched king oyster mushrooms...|$|R

From this study, it is found that <b>oyster</b> <b>shell</b> has sufficient probability for using as a desiccant in air-conditioning system. Moreover, the heat releasing device(peltier element) can be used with direct current from PV cells so the system can be operated with high efficiency.

The DOE methods was used by mixing cement, <b>oyster</b> <b>shell,</b> sands, and polyurethane by composition of 160 ml: 40 ml: 100 ml: 120 ml respectively. Refer to the results of previous research, then cement consumption is reduced up to 20 % to keep the concept of green material. This study compared three different compositions of mortars, namely portland cement concrete with gravel (PCG), polyurethane concrete of <b>oyster</b> <b>shell</b> (PCO) and concrete with plastics aggregate (PCP). The methods of acoustical tests were conducted refer to the ASTM E 413 - 04 standard. The research results showed that polyurethane concrete with <b>oyster</b> <b>shell</b> waste aggregate has absorption coefficient 0. 52 and STL 63 dB and has a more beautiful appearance when it was pressed into moulding. It can be concluded that polyurethane concrete with <b>oyster</b> <b>shell</b> aggregate (PCO) is well implemented in architectural acoustics-components...|$|R
5|$|Farming villagers in {{the north}} spent their days {{harvesting}} crops like wheat and millet, while farmers south of the Huai River engaged in intensive rice cultivation and had lakes and ponds where ducks and fish could be raised. The cultivation of mulberry trees for silkworms and tea bushes could be found mostly south of the Yangzi River; even further south sugarcane and citrus were grown as basic crops. Some people in the mountainous southwest made a living by selling lumber from hard bamboo. Besides cutting down trees to sell wood, the poor also made a living by turning wood into charcoal, and by burning <b>oyster</b> <b>shells</b> to make lime and fired pots, and weaving mats and baskets. In the north traveling by horse and carriage was most common, while in the south the myriad of rivers, canals, and lakes provided cheap and easy water transport. Although the south had the characteristic of the wealthy landlord and tenant farmers, there were on average many more owner-cultivators north of the Huai River due to harsher climate, living not far above subsistence level.|$|E

The tomb contained rich offerings that included jade ear ornaments handed down from the Early Classic, a jade mosaic mask, shell and bone beads, spiny <b>oyster</b> <b>shells,</b> eccentric obsidian blades, fine ceramics {{and the remains of}} wooden objects. One of the ceramics was a plate with a hieroglyphic text that specifically named king Yuknoom Yich'aak K'ak' as its owner. The remains and the offering were placed in an arched wooden bier carved with elaborate decoration and hieroglyphs that was painted in a variety of colours. The bier has almost completely decayed but left an impression in the mud packed around it. Due to the plate and the possible association of Stelae 115 and 116 with the burial the tomb is believed to be that of the late 7th-century king Yuknoom Yich'aak K'ak'.|$|E
