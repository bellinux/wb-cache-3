500|$|The {{success of}} 452 and its highest scoring pilot Brendan Finucane brought fame and {{publicity}} {{and information about}} the squadron's exploits was released by the Air Ministry to the press. That same day, Sunday 21 September 1941, 452 escorted Blenheims to Gosnay once more on Circus 101. 452 met resistance and Bf 109s engaged the Wing. Finucane claimed two at around 15:25 GMT. Chisholm witnessed the first one explode and the second victory burst into flames and dived out of control. The Air Ministry released {{the details of the}} operation to the press that night. The Daily Herald had planned to use the headline Finucane wants 3 for his 21st – 21 for his 21st birthday. Editions were changed overnight to Finucane wants one more. The Daily Mail, a believer in publishing fighter pilots' exploits since the First World War, ran the headline Spitfire Finucane shoots down 20 Nazis [...] Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>headlines</b> carried pictures of the squadron in the aftermath of Circus 100B and the stories elevated Finucane to national hero status.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{entitled}} Thematic Pogression on <b>the</b> <b>Headline</b> Entitled “Japanese Firms Move RI Service Sector”. It has two objectives: first, it {{is aimed at}} finding <b>the</b> types <b>of</b> thematic progression pattern found in <b>the</b> <b>headline.</b> Second, it is aimed at describing <b>the</b> coherency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>headline</b> entitled “Japanese Firms Move RI Service Sector”. In analyzing the data, the researcher used the framework proposed by Paltridge (2000 : 140). While the steps in analyzing the data are as follows: segmenting the data into clauses, identifying the Theme and Rheme for each clause, describing <b>the</b> types <b>of</b> thematic progression <b>of</b> <b>headline,</b> and describing <b>the</b> coherence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>headline</b> entitled “Japanese Firms Moves into RI Service Sector” January 9, 2013. The last is drawing the thematic progression pattern <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>headline.</b> It is found that there are 32 clauses showing <b>the</b> 3 types <b>of</b> thematic progression in <b>the</b> 10 paragraphs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>headline.</b> They are reiteration or constant, zigzag or linear, and multiple or split rheme. <b>The</b> number <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three patterns shows that there are reiteration patterns with 9, it is followed by zigzag pattern with 4. Meanwhile, multiple pattern was not found in <b>the</b> tenth paragraph <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>headline.</b> <b>The</b> most frequently used thematic progression patterns in <b>the</b> <b>headline</b> <b>of</b> “Japanese Firm Moves into RI Service Sector” are reiteration or constant pattern, that is 9 which indicates that the writer gives information which is as <b>the</b> theme <b>of</b> her writing and zigzag pattern with 4 meaning that the writer took <b>the</b> rheme <b>of</b> a clause becomes the theme in the following clause. According to the finding, there are some types of thematic progression which {{is found in the}} whole paragraph. It can be conclude that most clause is coherent. But the other situation claim that it also not coherent if looked from each clause, because there are some clause which are not related with the other...|$|R

500|$|Kennedy {{finally decided}} to seek the Democratic {{nomination}} in the 1980 presidential election by launching an unusual, insurgent campaign against the incumbent Carter, {{a member of his}} own party. A midsummer 1978 poll had shown Democrats preferring Kennedy over Carter by a 5-to-3 margin. During spring and summer 1979, as Kennedy deliberated whether to run, Carter was not intimidated despite his 28percent approval rating, saying publicly: [...] "If Kennedy runs, I'll whip his ass." [...] Carter later asserted that Kennedy's constant criticism of his policies was a strong indicator that Kennedy was planning to run for the presidency. Labor unions urged Kennedy to run, as did some Democratic party officials who feared that Carter's unpopularity could result in heavy losses in the 1980 congressional elections. Kennedy decided to run in August 1979, when polls showed him with a 2-to-1 advantage over Carter; Carter's approval rating slipped to 19percent. Kennedy formally announced his campaign on November 7, 1979, at Boston's Faneuil Hall. He had already received substantial negative press from a rambling response to the question [...] "Why {{do you want to be}} President?" [...] during an interview with Roger Mudd of CBS News broadcast a few days earlier. The Iranian hostage crisis, which began on November 4, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, which began on December 27, prompted the electorate to rally around the president and allowed Carter to pursue a Rose Garden strategy of staying at the White House, which kept Kennedy's campaign out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>headlines.</b>|$|E

Holden and Everest, who was acting as the film's [...] "air boss", became close friends during the production. In a similar manner, General Banner's character was based on Major General Albert Boyd, the first Commander of the USAF Flight Test Center at Edwards AFB.|$|E

Maybe this is just an effort to push Mr. Trump out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>headlines,</b> but it's not the kind of leadership that is needed for America right now."

He was accompanied by Marjorie Gillespie, her daughter Vyner, and two family friends of the Gillespies, Martin Simpson and Alan Stewart.

We distinguish between <b>the</b> oversubscription rates <b>of</b> institutional and retail investors in <b>the</b> estimation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> issuer-oriented underpricing {{costs associated with the}} pure fixed price, fixed price and bookbuilding IPOs. Leung and Menyah show that the issuer underpricing cost of new share issues (UN) averages about 14 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>headline</b> underpricing.

In this study, we show that <b>the</b> mean <b>of</b> UN is about 16 % (11 %) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>headline</b> underpricing before (after) accounting for the RAF.
