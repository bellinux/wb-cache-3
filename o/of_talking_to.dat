But Ford, who still had the final veto in the company on a de facto basis even if not an official one, refused to cooperate. For several years, he kept Bennett in charge <b>of</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> the unions that were trying to organize the Ford Motor Company. Sorensen's memoir makes clear that Ford's purpose in putting Bennett in charge was to make sure no agreements were ever reached.|$|E

By the next month she started posting a number of images on social media website Instagram, where she hinted at possible songwriters and collaborators with hashtag captions. Two months later, Madonna posted a selfie where she talked about working with American DJ Diplo. Madonna had invited him to her annual Oscar party, but he was unable to attend. They eventually started talking about music through texts and decided to collaborate on the album. In an interview with Idolator, Diplo explained that Madonna had asked him to provide his [...] "craziest record" [...] for the album. Together they wrote and recorded seven songs and Diplo added that [...] " [...] was up for anything.

Rachel thinks he's being in the wrong that Kurt is cheating on Blaine instead <b>of</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> Blaine about the rut they are in. Blaine finds out about Chandler and is extremely hurt. Both Kurt and Blaine sing Whitney songs to express {{how they feel about}} their situation with Blaine singing It's Not Right but It's Okay and Kurt singing I Have Nothing as an apology.

500|$|By December 2013, Madonna's manager Guy Oseary {{commented that}} the singer was [...] "eager to get started" [...] on her next album. However, she had another project in mind – {{developing}} the screenplay for the Andrew Sean Greer novel, The Impossible Lives of Greta Wells. Madonna decided to split her time between writing the screenplay and writing songs for the new album. In February 2014, Madonna confirmed that she had already begun working on her thirteenth studio album, saying: [...] "I'm {{right now in the}} process <b>of</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> various co-writers and producers and talking about where I want to go with my music". Working with a number of collaborators on the album, Madonna encountered problems in keeping a cohesive sound and creative direction for Rebel Heart, since her previous efforts had been produced with only a small core group of people developing the music. She observed {{that a lot of the}} people she enlisted would not stay in one city at a time due to their different projects, resulting in Madonna not finishing her songs. [...] "So, I was just the person standing there with a clipboard in the headlights, going 'Ok!' A little bit like a school teacher," [...] she admitted.|$|E
500|$|The voice cast {{was signed}} on to do the film in 2001, and work then began on the script. The {{producers}} were initially worried that creating a film would {{have a negative effect}} on the series, as they did not have enough crew to focus their attention on both projects. As the series progressed, additional writers and animators were hired so that both the show and the film could be produced at the same time. Groening and James L. Brooks invited back Mike Scully and Al Jean (who continued to work as showrunner on the television series) to produce the film with them. They then signed David Silverman (who, in anticipation of the project, had quit his job at Pixar) to direct the film. The [...] "strongest possible" [...] writing team was assembled, with many of the writers from the show's early seasons being chosen. David Mirkin, Mike Reiss, George Meyer, John Swartzwelder, and Jon Vitti were selected. Ian Maxtone-Graham and Matt Selman joined later, and Brooks, Groening, Scully, and Jean also wrote parts of the script. Sam Simon did not return having left the show over creative differences in 1993. Former writer Conan O'Brien expressed interest in working with the Simpsons staff again, although he later joked that [...] "I worry that the Simpsons-writing portion of my brain has been destroyed after 14 years <b>of</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> Lindsay Lohan and that guy from One Tree Hill, so maybe it's all for the best." [...] The same went for director Brad Bird who said he had [...] "entertained fantasies of asking if [...] could work on the movie", but did not have enough time due to work on Ratatouille. The producers arranged a deal with Fox that would allow them to abandon production of the film at any point if they felt the script was unsatisfactory.|$|E

While at Bristol, his habit <b>of</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> the baseball and patting down the pitcher's mound was first noticed by professional coaches. Bristol was also where Fidrych acquired his nickname [...] "The Bird".

2500|$|Almost {{as soon as}} he {{was drafted}} into the Phillies organization, Buchanan drew {{comparisons}} to Kyle Kendrick, a pitcher who possesses similar attributes, specifically that they are built similarly in terms of height and weight, and that they both are reliable groundball pitchers. Also similar to Kendrick, many fans and others have overlooked Buchanan during his minor league tenure; he did not receive any interview requests during the Reading Phillies' media day in 2012, despite being one of the team's top starting pitchers. An article in The Times Herald asserted, [...] "Most of what gets Buchanan overlooked are the things that get his pitching compared to Kendrick’s: He isn’t overpowering, but he uses a sinker and control on the corners to coax ground balls and keep his team in games. That capability has earned Kendrick 153 starts and 64 wins over the last seven seasons with the Phillies, not to mention a $7.7 million deal in 2014 as he approaches free agency." [...] Buchanan also possesses a strong work ethic – instead <b>of</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> the media or celebrating with teammates after throwing seven scoreless innings and striking out nine, he completed a 45-minute medicine ball workout. In addition to the aforementioned sinker, he throws a slider and a changeup.|$|E
2500|$|In 1926, Rawlinson {{published}} Chinese Ideas of the Supreme Being and in 1927 {{his most}} important work, Naturalization of Christianity in China. The motivation behind both was to meet the arguments of the hot Chinese nationalists and anti-Christians who attacked the church as irredeemably imperialist and irrational and to convince his fellow mission Christians to cede authority not only over the institutional church, a process which was already well under way, but to also cede the authority to define who was a Christian and what was Christian doctrine. The book drew from his years <b>of</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> Chinese intellectuals and lecturing to newly arrived missionaries. He prepared the arguments for the book {{in a series of}} editorials. He first argued that being a Christian was not a matter of church membership -- [...] "a Christian is one who loves Christ. Nothing more, nothing less." [...] Next, he challenged critics who claimed that China lacked the capacity to organize, citing in rebuttal the record of imperial China in organizing and administering its large territory. Nor did he accept the argument that Chinese cared little for morality or the individual, since the philosophies of Daoism and Buddhism did so, and Chinese family values were exemplary. He pointed out that the ancient Chinese had stated the Golden Rule long before Jesus. In short, a Chinese Christianity was possible but the main obstacle was Western refusal to accept Chinese as equals and recognize the strength of Chinese culture, [...] The burden was on the Christian church to itself become Chinese: ...|$|E
