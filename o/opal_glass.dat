2500|$|... 1832: William Chance, {{owner of}} a Birmingham iron merchants, invests in his {{brothers}} failing glass works in nearby Smethwick. After saving the company, this partnership later becomes the Chance Brothers. The company relies on local workers, and at one stage is known as [...] "...the greatest glass manufacturer in Britain", {{taking advantage of the}} Birmingham Canal Navigations and the Industrial Revolution in the region. Great advances in glass manufacture take place such as perfection of the earliest optical lenses to block the harmful ultra violet rays of the sun and improvements in lighthouse illumination. The company is responsible for glazing the original Crystal Palace to house the Great Exhibition of 1851, and the Houses of Parliament (built 1840–1860). At that time it is the only firm that is able to make the <b>opal</b> <b>glass</b> for the four faces of the Westminster Clock Tower that houses the famous bell, Big Ben. The ornamental windows for the White House in America are also made at Chances.|$|E
50|$|Arcoroc was {{launched}} in 1963 first as a brand for tempered glass. It then evolved towards a generalist professional brand {{for use in the}} restaurant industry, featuring cutlery, dinnerware and glassware, with products majorly made of glass material (annealed <b>glass,</b> <b>Opal,</b> tempered <b>glass,</b> Zenix) but also complementary ranges of porcelain and stainless steel products. All Arcoroc products are professional dishwasher safe (2000 cycles claimed).|$|R
50|$|The Arcopal brand was {{introduced}} in 1958. This fully tempered glassware is high-strength and durable, break and chip resistant. Although very thin, Arcopal glass is five times stronger than china. Arcopal tableware was famous for its translucent <b>opal</b> borosilicate <b>glass.</b> In 1986 the Arcopal ranges of products were included in Luminarc and Arcoroc offers, under the ranges of products made in Opal. The Arcopal France tableware is microwave and dishwasher safe. Arcopal bakeware is oven, microwave, and dishwasher safe.|$|R
40|$|Don Stookey was {{a special}} person by any measure: an unassuming optimist, eminent {{scientist}} and inventor, adventurer, and a beloved family man. Don Stookey, the father of glass-ceramics, was a pioneer in inducing and understanding internal nucleation phenomena in glass. His early work on dense <b>opal</b> <b>glasses</b> and photosensitive precipitation of gold and silver in glass led to an amazing series of inventions: Fotalite®, a photosensitive opal, chemically machined Fotoform® and Fotoceram®, and TiO 2 -nucleated Pyroceram™ products including missile nosecones and oven-proof cookware. He received a basic patent on glass-ceramics which was contested and affirmed in court. Don was able to demonstrate a clear photochromic glass that showed reversible darkening for thousands of cycles. This material became a fixture in the ophthalmic industry. He went on to invent a full-color polychromatic glass capable of yielding a permanent patterned and monolithic stained glass. In his life outside science, Don chaired an interfaith group that founded {{a home for the}} elderly in Corning. He was also a wilderness enthusiast, surviving a plane crash in the Arctic and two boat capsizings. Even In his later years, he continued fishing off the coast of Florida and on Lake Ontario, and went solo on a trip to the Patagonian Andes...|$|R
2500|$|The Main Concourse is {{the center}} of Grand Central. At [...] long by [...] wide by [...] high, the {{cavernous}} Main Concourse is usually filled with bustling crowds. and is often used as a meeting place. The ticket booths are here, although many now stand unused or have been repurposed since the introduction of ticket vending machines. The large American flag was hung in Grand Central Terminal {{a few days after the}} September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center. The main information booth is in the center of the concourse. The four-faced brass clock on top of the information booth, perhaps the most recognizable icon of Grand Central, was designed by Henry Edward Bedford and cast in Waterbury, Connecticut. Each of the four clock faces is made from opalescent glass (now often called <b>opal</b> <b>glass</b> or milk glass), though urban legend has it that the faces are made of opal and that Sotheby's and Christie's have estimated their value to be between $10 million and $20 million. A 1954 New York Times article on the restoration of the clock notes that [...] "Each of the glass faces was twenty-four inches in diameter...." [...] Within the marble and brass pagoda lies a [...] "secret" [...] door that conceals a spiral staircase leading to the lower-level information booth.|$|E

40|$|In {{addition}} to the stable silica polymorph quartz, several metastable silica phases are present in Yucca Mountain. The conversion of these phases to quartz is accompanied by volume reduction {{and a decrease in}} the aqueous silica activity, which may destabilize clinoptilolite and mordenite. The primary reaction sequence for the silica phases is from <b>opal</b> or <b>glass</b> to disordered opal-CT, followed by ordering of the opal-CT and finally by the crystallization of quartz. The ordering of opal-CT takes place in the solid state, whereas the conversion of opal-CT takes place through dissolution-reprecipitation involving the aqueous phase. It is proposed that the rate of conversion of opal-CT to quartz is controlled by diffusion of defects out of a disordered surface layer formed on the crystallizing quartz. The reaction rates are observed to be dependent on temperature, pressure, degree of supersaturation, and pH. Rate equations selected from the literature appear to be consistent with observations at Yucca Mountain...|$|R

40|$|Insoluble {{residues}} of Late Cretaceous to Quaternary deep-sea {{samples from}} slope, trench, and oceanic plate sites south of Guatemala were examined, {{specifically for the}} distribution of clay minerals in the < 2 -µm fraction and of silt grains in the 20 - 63 -µm fraction. Widespread "oceanic" particles (biogenic <b>opal,</b> rhyolitic <b>glass)</b> and their diagenetic products (smectite, clinoptilolite, heulandite) were distinguished from terrigenous material - illite, kaolinite, chlorite, plagioclase, quartz, and heavy minerals. The main results of this investigation are: (1) At Site 494 on the slope immediately adjacent to the trench, terrigenous supplies testify to a slope position of the whole sequence back to the Late Cretaceous. (2) At Site 495 on the Pacific Cocos Plate, "oceanic" and terrigenous sedimentation are clearly separated. Whereas the pelagic sedimentation prevailed in the early Miocene, terrigenous minerals appeared in the middle Miocene in the clay fraction, {{and in the early}} Pliocene in the coarse silt fraction. These terrigenous supplies are interpreted as having been transported by suspension clouds crossing the slope and even the trench. The alternative, however, an eolian transport, cannot be excluded...|$|R

40|$|High-quality {{optical glass}} {{diffusers}} have applications in aerospace, displays, imaging systems, medical devices, and optical sensors. The development of rapid and accurate fabrication techniques is highly desirable for their production. Here, a micropatterning method for the fast fabrication of optical diffusers {{by means of}} nanosecond pulsed laser ablation is demonstrated (λ= 1064 nm, power= 7. 02, 9. 36 and 11. 7 W and scanning speed= 200 and 800 mm s- 1). The experiments were carried out by point-to-point texturing of a glass surface in spiral shape. The laser machining parameters, the number of pulses and their power had significant effect on surface features. The optical characteristics of the diffusers were characterized at different scattering angles. The features of the microscale structures influenced average roughness from 0. 8 μm to 1. 97 μm. The glass diffusers scattered light at angles up to 20 ° and their transmission efficiency were measured up to ∼ 97 % across the visible spectrum. The produced optical devices diffuse light less but do so with less scattering and energy losses as compared to <b>opal</b> diffusing <b>glass.</b> The presented fabrication method {{can be applied to}} any other transparent material to create optical diffusers.

40|$|The NA 62 {{experiment}} at CERN aims at {{the very}} challenging task of measuring with 10 % relative error the Branching Ratio of the ultra-rare decay of the K + into π + ν ¯ν, {{which is expected to}} occur only in about 8 out of 10 11 Kaon decays. This will be achieved by means of an intense hadron beam, an accurate kinematical reconstruction and a redundant veto system for identifying and suppressing all spurious events. The good resolution on the missing mass in the decay is achieved using a high-resolution beam tracker to measure the kaon momentum and with a spectrometer equipped with straw tubes operating in vacuum. Hermetic veto (up to 50 mrad) of the photon from π 0 decays is achieved with a combination of large angle veto (with a creative reuse of the old <b>OPAL</b> lead <b>glass</b> blocks), the NA 48 LKr calorimeter and two small angle calorimeters to cover the angle down to zero. The identification of the muons and the consequent veto is performed by a fast hodoscope plane (used in the first level of the trigger to reduce the rate) and by a 17 -meter, neon-filled RICH counter which is able to separate pions and muons in the momentum interval between 15 and 35 GeV. Particle identification in the beam (K/π separation) is achieved with an H 2 differential Cherenkov counter. The trigger for the experiment is based on a multilevel structure with a first level implemented in the readout boards and with the subsequent level done in software. The aim is to reduce the 10 MHz L 0 rate to few KHz sent to the CERN computing center. Studies are underway to use GPU boards in some key point of the trigger system to improve the performance...|$|R
