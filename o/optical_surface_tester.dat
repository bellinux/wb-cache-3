40|$|Smoothness {{of paper}} surface is an {{important}} property of paper from its printability viewpoint. A number of techniques are available for characterizing the topographical features of paper surface. These techniques {{have led to the}} development of smoothness testers of various types such as air-leak <b>testers,</b> <b>optical</b> contact <b>testers,</b> <b>surface</b> profilers, and a number of ink and liquid application apparatus to assess the smoothness. While all these methods are intended to serve the same purpose, they differ so greatly in their basic approach that the agreement between them cannot be taken for granted. In the present work, these methods have been applied to characterize the surface of handsheets of mechanical pulps. A comparison of these methods reveals that different methods grade these pulps differently confirming the multidimensional nature of the surface structur...|$|R

40|$|<b>Optical</b> <b>surfaces</b> {{equipped}} with specific functional properties have attracted increasing importance {{over the last}} decades. In the light of cost reduction, hydrophobic self-cleaning behavior is aspired. On the other side, hydrophilic properties are interesting due to their anti-fog effect. It has become well known that such wetting states are significantly affected by the <b>surface</b> morphology. For <b>optical</b> <b>surfaces,</b> however, this fact poses a problem, as surface roughness can induce light scattering. The generation of <b>optical</b> <b>surfaces</b> with specific wetting properties, hence, requires a profound understanding {{of the relation between}} the wetting and the structural surface properties. Thus, our work concentrates on a reliable acquisition of roughness data over a wide spatial frequency range {{as well as on the}} comprehensive description of the wetting states, which is needed for the establishment of such correlations. We will present our advanced wetting analysis for nanorough <b>optical</b> <b>surfaces,</b> extended by a vibration-based procedure, which is mainly for understanding and tailoring the wetting behavior of various solid-liquid systems in research and industry.

The wheel, allowed to roll freely, is slightly turned relative to the ground so that it partially slides.

40|$|Mid-spatial {{frequency}} <b>surface</b> {{error of}} <b>optical</b> lens {{is crucial to}} the performance of high-energy laser systems and high-resolution optical systems. Power spectrum density (PSD) is generally employed to evaluate mid-spatial frequency error of <b>optical</b> <b>surface.</b> PSD is based on Fourier transform which averages local characters to the whole space. And it gives a whole evaluation of mid-spatial frequency error of <b>optical</b> <b>surface.</b> It not only weakens characters but also loses location information of surface error. Abrasive processing, such as grinding and polishing, always introduces local waviness with time-varying frequency on <b>optical</b> lens <b>surface,</b> PSD fails for this situation. A new error separation method, which is based on empirical mode decomposition, is introduced in this paper in order to more accurately evaluate mid-spatial frequency error and guide compensation machining. Curve of <b>optical</b> <b>surface</b> is preliminary fitted and the difference between the origin data and the fitting curve is decomposed to a series of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Local waviness characters of <b>optical</b> lens <b>surface</b> and its frequency can be recognized from each IMF and the corresponding instantaneous frequency plot. All IMFs are divided into high-frequency group and mid-spatial frequency group by average of instantaneous frequency of each IMF considering with IMF characters. IMFs in the same group are added to acquire high-frequency error or mid-spatial frequency error of <b>optical</b> <b>surface.</b> The simulation and experimental results of <b>optical</b> <b>surface</b> with different machining methods are employed to validate the effectiveness and correctness of the method. ? 2013 Journal of Mechanical Engineering...|$|R

40|$|This {{technology}} exploits {{the organic}} decomposition capability and hydrophilic {{properties of the}} photocatalytic material titanium dioxide (TiO 2), a nontoxic and non-hazardous substance, to address contamination and biofouling issues in field-deployed optical sensor systems. Specifically, this technology incorporates TiO 2 coatings and materials applied to, or integrated as a part of, the <b>optical</b> <b>surfaces</b> of sensors and calibration sources, including lenses, windows, and mirrors {{that are used in}} remote, unattended, ground-based (land or maritime) optical sensor systems. Current methods used to address contamination or biofouling of these <b>optical</b> <b>surfaces</b> in deployed systems are costly, toxic, labor intensive, and non-preventative. By implementing this novel technology, many of these negative aspects can be reduced. The functionality of this innovative self-cleaning solution {{to address the problem of}} contamination or biofouling depends on the availability of a sufficient light source with the appropriate spectral properties, which can be attained naturally via sunlight or supplemented using artificial illumination such as UV LEDs (light emitting diodes). In land-based or above-water systems, the TiO 2 <b>optical</b> <b>surface</b> is exposed to sunlight, which catalyzes the photocatalytic reaction, facilitating both the decomposition of inorganic and organic compounds, and the activation of superhydrophilic properties. Since underwater <b>optical</b> <b>surfaces</b> are submerged and have limited sunlight exposure, supplementary UV light sources would be required to activate the TiO 2 on these <b>optical</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Nighttime operation of land-based or above-water systems would require this addition as well. For most superhydrophilic self-cleaning purposes, a rainwater wash will suffice; however, for some applications an attached rainwater collector/ dispenser or other fresh water dispensing system may be required to wash the <b>optical</b> <b>surface</b> and initiate the removal of contaminates. Deployment of this non-toxic,non-hazardous-technology will take advantage of environmental elements (i. e. rain and sunlight), increase the longevity of unattended optical systems, increase the amount of time between required maintenance, and improve the long-term accuracy of sensor measurements...|$|R
