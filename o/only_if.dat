5|$|The {{determinant}} det(A) or |A| of {{a square}} matrix A {{is a number}} encoding certain properties of the matrix. A matrix is invertible if and <b>only</b> <b>if</b> its determinant is nonzero. Its absolute value equals the area (in R2) or volume (in R3) {{of the image of}} the unit square (or cube), while its sign corresponds to the orientation of the corresponding linear map: the determinant is positive if and <b>only</b> <b>if</b> the orientation is preserved.|$|E

5|$|There is an {{injective}} homomorphism from G to H (i.e., {{one that}} never maps distinct vertices to one vertex) if and <b>only</b> <b>if</b> G is a subgraph of H.|$|E
5|$|Therefore, a graph G is k-colorable (has a {{homomorphism}} to Kk) if and <b>only</b> <b>if</b> some {{orientation of}} G has a homomorphism to k.|$|E
5|$|Therefore, a graph is k-colorable if and <b>only</b> <b>if</b> {{it has an}} {{orientation}} that admits no homomorphism from k + 1.|$|E

5|$|A {{folklore}} theorem {{states that}} for all k, a directed graph G has a homomorphism to k if and <b>only</b> <b>if</b> it admits no homomorphism from the directed path k + 1.|$|E
5|$|A k-coloring, {{for some}} integer k, is an {{assignment}} {{of one of}} k colors to each vertex of a graph G such that the endpoints of each edge get different colors. The k-colorings of G correspond exactly to homomorphisms from G to the complete graph K'k. Indeed, the vertices of K'k correspond to the k colors, and two colors are adjacent as vertices of K'k if {{and if they are}} different. Hence a function defines a homomorphism to K'k if and <b>only</b> <b>if</b> it maps adjacent vertices of G to different colors (i.e., it is a k-coloring). In particular, G is k-colorable if and <b>only</b> <b>if</b> it is K'k-colorable.|$|E

5|$|A {{symmetric}} matrix is positive-definite if and <b>only</b> <b>if</b> all its eigenvalues are positive, that is, the matrix is positive-semidefinite {{and it is}} invertible. The table at the right shows two possibilities for 2-by-2 matrices.|$|E
5|$|For a block {{cellular}} automaton, testing reversibility is also easy: the automaton is reversible if and <b>only</b> <b>if</b> {{the transition}} function on the {{blocks of the}} automaton is invertible, {{and in this case}} the reverse automaton has the same block structure with the inverse transition function.|$|E
5|$|Hassler Whitney {{showed that}} if the graph is 3-connected then the embedding, and thus the dual graph, is unique. By Steinitz's theorem, these graphs are exactly the {{polyhedral}} graphs, the graphs of convex polyhedra. A planar graph is 3-vertex-connected if and <b>only</b> <b>if</b> its dual graph is 3-vertex-connected. More generally, a planar graph has a unique embedding, and therefore also a unique dual, if and <b>only</b> <b>if</b> it is a subdivision of a 3-vertex-connected planar graph (a graph formed from a 3-vertex-connected planar graph by replacing some of its edges by paths). For some planar graphs that are not 3-vertex-connected, such as the complete bipartite graph , the embedding is not unique, but all embeddings are isomorphic. When this happens, correspondingly, all dual graphs are isomorphic.|$|E

5|$|The appellants {{contended that}} under Article 15(4) of the Constitution {{restrictions}} {{on the right of}} freedom of religion could be imposed <b>only</b> <b>if</b> public order, public health or morality is affected, and section 24(1)(a) of the SA provides for registered organizations to be dissolved <b>only</b> <b>if</b> they threaten public peace, welfare or good order. The appellants therefore submitted that {{there had to be a}} clear and immediate danger to public order before freedom of religion can be circumscribed. Since the activities of Jehovah's Witnesses posed no such threat, the deregistration order was unconstitutional and ultra vires the SA.|$|E
