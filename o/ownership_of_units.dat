To encourage individual <b>ownership</b> <b>of</b> <b>units,</b> the initial buyers of units (buying from {{the owner of the}} entire building) {{did not have to be}} approved by a board. [...] Also, the rental tenants living in the building at the time of the conversion were usually given an option to buy at a discount. If the tenants were rent controlled, the law usually protects them by allowing them to stay as renters and the unit may not be occupied by a purchaser until said tenant dies or moves out. [...] Many of these buildings, especially in Manhattan, are actually quite luxurious and exclusive; many celebrities live in them and some famous people are even rejected by co-op boards. [...] In the 1990s and 2000s some rental buildings in the Chicago, Washington, D.C., and Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach areas went through a similar conversion process, though not to the degree of New York.|$|E

We find that individual franchisees are much more likely to be assigned the ownership of a particular new unit the closer their existing units are geographically to the new unit. Further, given distance, franchisees are more likely to be allocated a new franchised unit if they already own units whose markets are contiguous and demographically similar to that of the new unit. Finally, contrary to implications from some explanations for company ownership, we find that franchisors use similar criteria when they decide to retain units under company ownership as when they choose among franchisees...|$|E

40|$|Retrenchment of {{the public}} sector as a direct {{provider}} of rented accommodation has been accompanied by a growing reliance on housing associations as alternative providers of below-market rented accommodation in the UK. The most successful vehicle to date (in terms of transferred <b>ownership</b> <b>of</b> <b>units)</b> for growing the not-for-profit sector has been so-called ¿large-scale voluntary transfer¿ of dwellings formerly owned by local authorities. Since {{the turn of the century}} this has been accompanied by the rapid expansion of ¿arms-length management organizations¿ in England. Notably though, for a process concerned with the transfer of legal entitlements to property, the literature on stock transfer and social housing reform is marked by a curious absence of any discussion of a property rights dimension of this process and, particularly, how degree and form of ownership is capitalized through the prevailing (and changing) governance structures. The point of departure for this article is an examination of how stock transfer separates ownership over social housing attributes and the relative valuation of property rights. We argue that stock transfer involves the de jure transfer of property to a new legal entity, but that a significant part of de facto property rights remain ¿un-transferred¿, or have been redistributed within the public sector and thus do not necessarily constitute a redrawing {{of the public}} domain boundary...|$|E

40|$|The Australian Government {{intends to}} {{introduce}} a price on carbon to create a clean energy economy at least-cost. The environmental aim will be achieved by creating a new market through an emissions trading scheme (ETS) – the carbon market. These are matters of public interest. This thesis addresses the potential for abuse of an Australian ETS by entities that are not directly liable for the carbon price (non-liable entities). This thesis asserts that the gateway for this abuse is opened by unfettered ownership rights in the <b>units</b> <b>of</b> currency (emissions <b>units)</b> <b>of</b> the ETS – the statutory right to emit a defined amount of greenhouse gases (GHG). Emissions units become commodities because embedded property rights in the <b>ownership</b> <b>of</b> the emissions <b>unit</b> allows transfer <b>of</b> the emissions <b>units</b> from one entity to another at an agreed price. Experience with trading <b>of</b> emissions <b>units</b> in the European Union and elsewhere reveals that abuse has occurred.

40|$|In this contribution, the English commonhold system, {{which enables}} the {{development}} of freehold units in a multi-unit development, is critically re-visited. Provision is made for {{the development of}} freehold apartments on land with a registered commonhold title. At the date of registration, a management body for the scheme, the commonhold association, must be in place. Each purchaser of a unit in the relevant building obtains freehold property on purchase. The property and management of the building housing the units and of the common areas of the scheme are, by contrast, withheld from unit holders and vested in the commonhold association, which is a special kind of body corporate. Since the coming into force of the English legislation, a set of defects have been detected. This contribution re-assesses the main problem areas and makes a number of reform suggestions drawing on material from a number of jurisdictions, notably South Africa, France and Germany. Avoidable problems are likely to arise with any conversions to commonhold from the predominant English long lease system, owing to the narrowness of the conversion rules. The manner in which <b>ownership</b> <b>of</b> <b>units</b> and the common parts are regulated, a key aspect in any such system, merits re-assessment. It seems that here the English rules survive comparison. The rules pertaining to constitution of the commonhold association fail to provide sufficient safeguards for unpaid scheme creditors. The rules relating leasing of commonhold units seem inadequately thought out. There is a conspicuous absence of real remedies for non-payment of assessments by unit holders. The effect of these and other aspects may help to explain why commonhold has had a limited numerical impact. The time for a second generation reforming statute may have come...|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} an {{investigation}} of the views of school experience of primary aged pupils `included' within special units for children with moderate learning difficulties (MLD) in one Local Education Authority (LEA) located in the North East of England. The investigation is intended to illuminate aspects of what the author regards as a number of under-researched areas within the current policy context of inclusion. Through interviews with the pupils themselves, teachers and their mainstream peers the author seeks to paint a picture of the social experience of school of the pupils in the units and to evaluate the model of provision in terms of its effectiveness in delivering positive social outcomes for its intended beneficiaries. The author also seeks to account for the nature of social relationships between unit pupils and their mainstream peers, an issue which had been of concern to the researcher herself, a former unit teacher, and her pupils. In case studies <b>of</b> two <b>units,</b> managed in partnership by a special school and two local primary schools, the author explores the views of a group of twelve Key Stage 2 pupils attending the two units. The <b>unit</b> pupils' perspectives <b>of</b> that experience, and in particular of their relationship with mainstream peers, are triangulated against the views <b>of</b> mainstream pupils, <b>unit</b> and mainstream staff and the researcher's observations. A second aspect of the research is the exploration of the social context in which pupils' relationships occur in each <b>of</b> the <b>units.</b> By relating comparative findings on the social contexts to the similarities and differences in outcomes for the two groups of pupils the author seeks to establish a link between the social context and pupils' friendship links with mainstream peers. The author concludes that her findings confirm the hypothesis, supported by the earlier work of Sinclair-Taylor (1994) in her study <b>of</b> a <b>unit</b> in a mainstream secondary school, that the organisational response to the perceived needs of the pupils in the unit creates divisions between them and their mainstream peers and confers low status upon the members <b>of</b> the <b>unit.</b> This, in turn, negatively impacts upon the mainstream pupils' perceptions <b>of</b> <b>unit</b> members as potential friends and leads to their marginalisation. The author goes on to suggest that the particular model established in the two <b>units,</b> bases <b>of</b> the special school within mainstream primary schools, and the separate roles and responsibilities towards the pupils in the unit which developed for the unit and mainstream staff were a contributory factor in the lack <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> <b>of</b> <b>unit</b> pupils by the mainstream school and their marginalisation. The author maintains that her findings have general implications for those adopting units as vehicles for the development of inclusive practice and for partnership work between special and mainstream schools.

40|$|New {{legislation}} for multi-dimensional real property formation (3 D Cadastre) came into force in Sweden on January 1 st 2004. The Act {{is considered to}} be the most important basic change that had taken place in Swedish cadastral legislation during the past 30 years. The limitations in the legislation that previously applied concerning formation <b>of</b> multi-dimensional property <b>units</b> for housing purposes have now been removed. Earlier a real property unit could not be a space comprising only a single dwelling unit and, therefore, the legislation did not permit the creation of strata titles (apartments/condominiums). The previous Swedish government did not consider that <b>ownership</b> <b>of</b> apartment <b>units</b> should be permitted. Therefore, a multi-dimensional real property unit for dwelling purpose could only be created if it comprised at least five dwelling units. However, the present government decided that changes should be made to the legislation that would make it possible to create so-called tenant-owned apartments. The change to the legislation means that it is possible to form a tenant-owned apartment property that comprises only a single apartment. It is also possible to own, rent out or transfer the property without any special restrictions. A pre-condition is, however, that there must be at least three suc...|$|R
