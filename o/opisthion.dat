50|$|The <b>opisthion</b> is the {{midpoint}} on the posterior {{margin of the}} foramen magnum and is a cephalometric landmark. Another landmark is the basion located at {{the midpoint}} on the anterior margin of the foramen magnum.|$|E
5000|$|There are two midline skull {{landmarks}} at the foramen magnum. The basion is {{the most}} anterior point of the opening and the <b>opisthion</b> is the point on the opposite posterior part. The basion lines up with the dens.|$|E
50|$|The Powers {{ratio was}} {{formerly}} used, {{which was the}} tip of the basion to the spinolaminar line, divided by the distance from {{the tip of the}} <b>opisthion</b> to the midpoint of the posterior aspect of the anterior arch of C1. It is no longer recommended due to low sensitivity and difficulty identifying landmarks. It also will miss vertical or posterior displacement of the cervical spine.|$|E
40|$|An {{examination}} of the VÉrtesszÖllÖs occipital bone indicates the need for taking its condition and preservation as well as certain aspects of its morphology into account prior to a metric assessment of its features. This analysis confirms the presence of extrasutural bones on the lambdoidal suture {{as well as some}} distortion in the sagittal curvature of this region. The advisability of using the endocranial sutures as well as other data for defining lambda in cases such as this is discussed, and a procedure for determining the position of <b>opisthion</b> is indicated. A metric and morphological analysis is used to support the claim that the specimen can be considered a large late representative of Homo erectus in Europe...|$|E

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of the present study}} were to determine the type and morphometric measurements of Foramen magnum (FM) in dry human skulls of Dakshina Kannada district of Southern India. Material and Methods: The present study included 50 adult human skulls of which 32 were males and 18 females. The type of foramen magnum observed macroscopically. Antero-posterior (APD) and transverse diameters (TD) were measured by using stainless steel electronic digital callipers. Foramen magnum Index (FMI) was calculated by using formula FMI= APD/TD. Results: Present study observed 4 types of shapes of foramen magnum, among them ovoid type was found higher frequency (48 %). Antero-posterior diameter is a distance between Basion and <b>Opisthion</b> 34. 95 mm in males and 34. 58 mm in females out of 34. 81 mm. The transverse diameters 28. 66 mm in males and 28. 84 mm in females out of 28. 73 mm. Foramen magnum index ≥ 1. 2 was considered as ovoid and found in 56 % of skulls. Conclusion: We believe that the present study provided additional information about the morphology and morphometric analysis of foramen magnum which is important to radiological, neurosurgical literature...|$|E
40|$|Kb — Kabwe [S 16], Pe — Petralona [S 17]). The {{youngest}} specimens are neonates, {{the oldest}} are adults. Ontogenetic stages {{are based on}} maxillary dental eruption patterns. The specimens were grouped in dental age groups according to maxillary dental eruption patterns (1 —no teeth erupted; 2 — incomplete deciduous dentition; 3 —complete deciduous dentition; 4 —M 1 erupted; 5 —M 2 erupted; 6 — M 3 erupted). Endocranial trajectories: The average human developmental trajectory was estimated as the series of shape changes between means of consecutive dental age groups. The trajectory plotted in the principal component scores plots (Figures 1 and S 2) is a BSplineCurve using the mean age group scores as control points. Figure S 1. Measurement protocol for landmarks (red) and semilandmarks on the endocranium. Curves were measured as closely spaced coordinates (orange) and then later resampled to equal point count. The surface semilandmarks (blue) were measured on the endocast of one template specimen and then mapped to every endocranial surface. Effects of arbitrary spacing were removed by allowing the semilandmarks to slide along their respective curve or surface so as to minimize bending energy between each specimen and the sample’s mean shape. The landmarks used are: anterior sphenoid spine, foramen caecum, endobregma, endolambda, internal occipital protuberance, <b>opisthion,</b> basion, endosphenobasion, dorsum sellae...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we report on}} a new {{discriminant}} function for the identification of artificially deformed crania. Development of the function, based on a sample of deformed and undeformed crania from the Philippines, required visual classification of the sample into deformed and undeformed groups. Working from the observation that deformed crania display flattened frontal and occipital regions, the sample was seriated based on degree of flattening; classification {{was based on the}} results of this seriation. The discriminant function, calculated using curvature indices, required only six simple measurements: arc and chord measurements for the frontal (glabella to bregma), parietals (bregma to lambda) and occipital (lambda to <b>opisthion).</b> The function was designed to be conservative, in that a deformed cranium may be classified as undeformed, but the opposite should not occur. Our function classified the undeformed crania with 100 % accuracy and deformed crania with 76. 9 % accuracy, for a total of 91. 9 % agreement with visual classification. In order to evaluate whether the function is applicable for samples from outside the Philippines, a double blind test was conducted with a large sample of deformed and undeformed crania from a broad geographical and temporal range. For this sample, the function agreed with visual classification in 89. 7 % of cases; 98. 8 % of undeformed crania were correctly classified, while deformed crania were identified with 73. 7 % accuracy. These results demonstrate the utility of the new discriminant function for the classification of artificially deformed crania from diverse contexts. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to determine the detailed morphometry of occipital condyle (OC), hypoglossal canal (HC), and foramen magnum (FM) in Turkish-Caucasian skulls: measurements were taken from 59 dry skulls of unknown sex. There {{was no significant difference}} (P> 0. 05) in measurements taken from the right and left sides, consequently the overall means and associated standard deviations were calculated. The length of the HC was 9. 9 ± 1. 9 mm and the HC intracranial and extracranial diameters were 6. 5 ± 1. 3 mm and 6. 6 ± 1. 1 mm, respectively, with the angle of the HC to the sagittal plane being 45. 6 ± 4. 6 degrees. The distances from the intracranial and extracranial ends of HC to the jugular foramen were 13. 3 ± 3. 3 mm and 8. 4 ± 2. 0 mm, respectively, whereas the distances from the HC to the jugular tubercle, <b>opisthion</b> and basion were 12. 2 ± 2. 2 mm, 29. 2 ± 2. 6 mm, and 16. 5 ± 1. 8 mm, respectively. The distances from the intracranial end of the HC to the posterior, anterior, inferior margins of the OC were 12. 3 ± 2. 4 mm, 11. 2 ± 1. 6 mm, and 9. 4 ± 1. 2 mm, respectively. The anteroposterior length and transverse width of the OC were 24. 5 ± 2. 5 mm and 13. 1 ± 1. 6 mm, and the angle of the OC to the sagittal plane 31. 5 ± 5. 1 degrees; the mean sagittal intercondylar angle was 62. 2 degrees. The anterior and posterior intercondylar distances were 22. 6 ± 3. 9 mm and 44. 2 ± 3. 2 mm. The anteroposterior and transverse diameters of the FM were 34. 8 ± 2. 2 mm and 29. 6 ± 2. 4 mm, giving a mean FM index of 1. 2. The presence or absence of a septum in the HC, protrusion of OC into the FM and the presence of condylar foramen were also determined. Detailed morphometric analysis will help in the planning of surgical intervention involving the skull base safer and easier...|$|E
