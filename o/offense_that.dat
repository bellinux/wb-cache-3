5|$|Helped {{by strong}} line play, Graham, Motley and Cleveland ends Dante Lavelli and Mac Speedie led a potent <b>offense</b> <b>that</b> {{dominated}} the AAFC for three years. The Browns won the AAFC championship in 1947, 1948 and 1949 before the league disbanded and Cleveland was {{absorbed by the}} more established NFL. Humble was a consensus second-team All-Pro selection in 1948, when Cleveland won all of its games. Cleveland's success continued in the NFL in 1950, when Humble was used on occasion as a linebacker on defense. The Browns finished {{the season with a}} 10–2 record and beat the Los Angeles Rams in the NFL championship game. Humble was selected to play in the first-ever Pro Bowl, the NFL's all-star game.|$|E
5|$|In Tatum's initial {{season at}} Maryland, his results {{were similar to}} those at Oklahoma. After {{compiling}} a 3–6 record the year prior, the Terrapins improved to 7–2–2 under Tatum. Whereas his predecessor Clark Shaughnessy had pioneered the T-formation, Tatum installed the split-T <b>offense</b> <b>that</b> his former colleague Don Farout had invented. The team's two losses came at the hands of two ranked period powerhouses, Duke and North Carolina. Maryland's star running back, Lu Gambino, scored three touchdowns against West Virginia to lead the team to their first victory in the third meeting of the series. The Terrapins' regular-season play earned them a berth in their first postseason game.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, the Society for Individual Rights (SIR) and the Daughters of Bilitis (DOB) {{began to work}} against police {{persecution}} of gay bars and entrapment in San Francisco. Oral sex was still a felony, and in 1970, nearly 90people in the city were arrested for having sex in public parks at night. Mayor Alioto asked the police to target the parks, hoping the decision would appeal to the Archdiocese and his Catholic supporters. In 1971, 2,800gay men were arrested for public sex in San Francisco. By comparison, New York City recorded only 63 arrests for the same <b>offense</b> <b>that</b> year. Any arrest for a morals charge required registration as a sex offender.|$|E
5|$|Oklahoma {{was led by}} seventh-year {{head coach}} Bud Wilkinson. He had assumed the {{position}} himself after Tatum resigned to leave for Maryland. The two had also both served as assistant coaches in the U.S. Navy for the Iowa Pre-Flight football team under Don Faurot. Faurot had pioneered the split-T <b>offense</b> <b>that</b> both Tatum and Wilkinsons' teams employed. Since taking over at Oklahoma, Wilkinson had achieved a 62–8–3record. Oklahoma entered the game on an eight-game winning streak with a single loss in the season-opener to Notre Dame and a tie in Week 2 against Pittsburgh. Oklahoma also had an injured quarterback, second-stringer Pat O'Neal had separated his sternum at Miami and would miss the game.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech quarterback Marcus Vick was {{predicted}} {{to be the}} key player for the favored Virginia Tech Hokies in pregame discussion. Vick had led the Hokies to a fifth place national ranking and an <b>offense</b> <b>that</b> earned 610rushing yards in the final two games of the regular season. Off the field, the matchup between head coaches also was a point of interest. At the time, Florida State head coach Bobby Bowden had the most wins of any active head coach in college football, while Virginia Tech head coach Frank Beamer was ranked third. Beamer had never defeated Bowden in a game. Before the game, Beamer was named the ACC's 2005 Coach of the Year for the second consecutive year.|$|E

As another example, Texas does not require any of the three felony convictions to be violent, but specifically excludes certain [...] "state jail felonies" [...] from being counted for enhancement purposes.|$|R
5|$|Virginia Tech's {{offense was}} ranked 11th nationally in scoring, {{averaging}} 36.4points per game, and 10th in rushing offense, averaging 242.8 yards per game. The totals {{were the most}} recorded to that point by a Virginia Tech <b>offense.</b> <b>That</b> high-ranking rushing attack was led by Dwayne Thomas, who accumulated 1,130yards and 11touchdowns during the regular season. Thomas' 11touchdowns were the most for a Tech running back since 1969. Thomas was ably assisted by a capable offensive line anchored by center Jim Pyne, who earned consensus All-America honors in recognition of his performance. By being named to every All-America team in the country, Pyne became the first consensus All-American in Virginia Tech history.|$|E
5|$|Although Stanford had fared poorly {{during the}} {{previous}} seasons, Thornhill had left behind a team with a talented roster, which included 24returning lettermen. Shaughnessy believed the players were good, but unsuited to the single-wing <b>offense</b> <b>that</b> his predecessor had employed. Perhaps most importantly, Shaughnessy inherited back Frankie Albert, whom he considered a prototypical T formation quarterback. In 1943, Shaughnessy wrote that he considered the 1940 Stanford backfield—quarterback Frankie Albert, fullback Norm Standlee, right halfback Hugh Gallarneau, and left halfback Pete Kmetovic—as the greatest in history. While he believed the Indians backfield was better than any such combination in the single-wing, double-wing, short punt, or box formations, he added the caveat that this held true only in the Stanford players' employment in the T-formation.|$|E
5|$|In {{his final}} season, McCoy led the Texas Longhorns {{to a perfect}} 12–0 regular season record, {{as well as a}} 13-12 victory over the Nebraska Cornhuskers to win the Big 12 Championship in Cowboys Stadium. While {{becoming}} the most victorious quarterback in NCAA history with 45 career wins, McCoy was again {{the focal point of the}} Longhorn <b>offense</b> <b>that</b> scored 550 points in 2009, ranked third in UT All-Time season scoring (behind only the 2005 and 2008 teams). McCoy led a fast-paced offense, with accurate, short passes in his repertoire. The Texas offense executed a total of 1,053 plays in 14 games played in 2009. His favorite target was WR Jordan Shipley (#8), who went on to play in the NFL with the Cincinnati Bengals.|$|E

5|$|In the Bears' {{first game}} of the season, California {{traveled}} to Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri, to face No. 10 Kansas State for the 2003 BCA Classic. There, California lost 42–28 in the season opener for both teams. California recovered from the loss in its next game, outscoring the visiting Southern Miss Golden Eagles 34–2. Despite the Bears' success against Southern Miss, they struggled in their next two games, losing to both Colorado State and Utah. Traveling to the Midwest to face Big 10 opponent Illinois, California debuted a new quarterback: Aaron Rodgers. Rodgers had success late in California's game against Utah, but did not earn the win. Against Illinois, however, he orchestrated a California <b>offense</b> <b>that</b> emerged victorious, 31–24.|$|E
5|$|Scalia {{maintained}} that every element of an <b>offense</b> <b>that</b> helps determine the sentence must be either admitted by the defendant or found {{by a jury}} under the Sixth Amendment's jury guarantee. In the 2000 case of Apprendi v. New Jersey, Scalia wrote the Court's majority opinion that struck down a state statute that allowed the trial judge to increase the sentence if the judge found the offense was a hate crime. Scalia found the procedure impermissible because {{whether it was a}} hate crime had not been decided by the jury. In 2004, he wrote for the Court in Blakely v. Washington, striking down Washington state's sentencing guidelines on similar grounds. The dissenters in Blakely foresaw that Scalia would use the case to attack the federal sentencing guidelines (which he had failed to strike down in Mistretta), and they proved correct, as Scalia led a five-member majority in United States v. Booker, which made those guidelines no longer mandatory for federal judges to follow (they remained advisory).|$|E
5|$|The Atlanta Falcons overcame a 20–7 halftime {{deficit to}} defeat the Buccaneers in {{overtime}} on a Mick Luckhurst field goal. The strategy of running out the clock with a conservative <b>offense</b> <b>that</b> had worked so well against the Lions the previous week backfired against the Falcons. The Buccaneers' offensive line failed to dominate, and the Falcons wound up running 57 offensive plays in the second half, while the Buccaneers ran only 26. Twenty of those plays were runs by Gerald Riggs, who finished the day with 127 yards rushing. The Buccaneers outgained the Falcons 255 yards to 190 in the first half, but were outgained 300 yards to 68 in the second half, in which the Buccaneers never advanced beyond midfield.
