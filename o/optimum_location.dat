40|$|Abstract—Employing {{multiple}} {{base stations}} {{is an attractive}} approach to enhance the lifetime of wireless sensor networks. In this paper, we address the fundamental question concerning the limits on the network lifetime in sensor networks when multiple base stations are deployed as data sinks. Specifically, we derive upper bounds on the network lifetime when multiple base stations are employed, and obtain <b>optimum</b> <b>locations</b> of the base stations (BSs) that maximize these lifetime bounds. For the case of two BSs, we jointly optimize the BS locations by maximizing the lifetime bound using a genetic algorithm based optimization. Joint optimization for more number of BSs is complex. Hence, for the case of three BSs, we optimize the third BS location using the previously obtained <b>optimum</b> <b>locations</b> {{of the first two}} BSs.

40|$|This paper {{utilizes}} the deterministic flow-interception {{model with}} the objective of locating truck weigh stations to maximize the total flow of trucks that are intercepted during their travel on the intercity highway network of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). The Origin-Destination (O-D) matrix of daily truck trips between each pair of the KSA's 18 major cities and regional centers was assigned to the shortest paths between the O-D pairs. The flow interception model was then solved using two approaches: a mathematical programming (MP) approach and a (greedy) heuristic approach. The results show that the greedy heuristic gives a solution that is very close to the optimum {{in terms of the number}} of stations needed to intercept a given percentage of the truck flow. However, some of the station locations might not coincide with those given by the exact MP solution. Furthermore, the MP solution results show that 44 stations are needed for 100 % truck flow interception, and that the existing 31 stations can intercept only 60. 91 % of the total truck flow.

The local glass industry produced 45 percent of the nation's output in glass by the 1860s and more than 80 percent of the output by the 1920s.
