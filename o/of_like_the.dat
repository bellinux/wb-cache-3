I think Master of Reality was kind <b>of</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> end of an era, the first three albums, and we decided to take our time with the next album." ...|$|E

I was convinced I wouldn't scare him." [...] Raimi found Crowe to be [...] "bold and challenging. He reminds me of what we imagine the American cowboy to have been like."

Written {{in the key}} of G major, the beat is set in common time and moves at a {{moderate}} 110 beats per minute. One Direction's vocal range in the song span from the note of A3 to D5. Instrumentation includes guitar strings, piano lines and vocals. The song utilises an acoustic guitar riff and a rotation of lead vocals.

500|$|Ellie Kendrick, who portrays Meera Reed in the series, in an {{interview}} with The Hollywood Reporter spoke about the re-introduction of Benjen Stark, or Coldhands Benjen, and working with Joseph Mawle, saying [...] "It was so fantastic. And it's interesting. If you've read the books, then you know about the Coldhands character, who was cut out of the Bran, Meera and Jojen storyline on the show. It was always interesting, having read the books, watching this amalgamation of story lines happen. Benjen is sort <b>of</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Coldhands character in that he's a slightly suspicious guy who is half-dead and half-alive with blue hands. I thought that was very cool, the way it happened. It was a nice marriage between the book and TV revelations rolled into one. I was very excited having him on set. I loved working with Joseph Mawle, and I loved having another member of our rapidly dwindling gang." ...|$|E
500|$|Music writer Robert Christgau said Saadiq's {{compositions}} {{are characterized}} by [...] "groove rather than song". Andy Kellman of AllMusic wrote that the songs are [...] "tied together by the Mellotron, a vintage keyboard — commonly associated with psychedelic and progressive rock recordings, but not foreign to soul — that evokes diseased flutes and wheezing strings", adding that [...] "Saadiq tends to use the instrument for shading". Music journalist Jim DeRogatis observed [...] "a little less Motown gloss" [...] than The Way I See It and [...] "a little more rock grit in Saadiq’s grooves, heavy on the Sly Stone (witness the opening 'Heart Attack'), late '50s/early '60s Isley Brothers (the joyful 'Radio'), and Ray Charles ('Day Dreams'), {{to say nothing of}} the skillful use of Mellotron orchestrations as a connecting thread throughout the disc, sort <b>of</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Moody Blues suddenly finding the funk ('The Answer')." [...] Steve Horowitz from PopMatters found the songs' subject matter to be assorted and said that Saadiq [...] "personalizes each song so they seem connected as just the many aspects of one man’s existence and experience".|$|E

[...] The finale scene of the episode is a parody of the ending from the 1977 movie [...] According to Thiessen, the joke was an [...] "afterthought"; originally, there was going to be a more elaborate ending, but due to time constraints, a new finale was created.

500|$|Robert Canning of IGN {{called the}} third season [...] "a series {{at the top}} of its game", scoring the season a 9.3 out of 10. In particular, Canning noted that the [...] "first half of the year... had the most focus." [...] Canning said the premiere episode [...] "Do-Over" [...] was [...] "filled to {{capacity}} with comedy", called [...] "Señor Macho Solo" [...] "near perfect", but said the story for the finale [...] "Kidney Now!" [...] was [...] "fun" [...] but [...] "average for a season finale." [...] Alynda Wheat of Entertainment Weekly, reviewing the DVD release, gave the season an A−. Jeremy Medina of Paste magazine also reviewed the premiere, saying it was [...] "sort <b>of</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> first day of school after summer vacation: sort of awkward at times, but fast and buoyant and warmly familiar all the same". Brian Lowry of Variety was more critical, calling the third season [...] "wildly uneven" [...] and saying 30 Rock was [...] "merely a good comedy whose shortcomings prevent it from joining the ranks of great ones." [...] Metacritic, which gives a score based on critical reviews, gave the season a rating of 84% from 17 reviews, signifying [...] "universal acclaim".|$|E

[...] Jeremy Medina of Paste magazine commented that [...] "Do-Over" [...] was [...] "sort <b>of</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> first day of school after summer vacation: sort of awkward at times, but fast and buoyant and warmly familiar all the same." [...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad wrote [...] "...this episode manages to do what the show has always done, mix crazy, almost surreal humor with a genuine (not manufactured) heart." [...] TV Guide contributor Matt Mitovich enjoyed [...] "Do-Over", and enjoyed Jack's story of trying to reclaim his job, along with Jack and Liz pretending to be a couple in front of Kathy. The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin opined that premiere episodes [...] "tend to be 30 Rocks Achilles Heel. But the show comes roaring out of the gate with 'Do-Over', a show that definitively breaks the premiere jinx." [...] He said that the [...] "frenetic farcical plotting" [...] of Megan Mullally's character—in which she endured a disastrous trip to the 30 Rock studios, bumped her head, and lost her memory—"felt a little sitcommy but the laughs kept coming". In conclusion, Rabin gave this episode an A- grade rating.|$|E

Madonna also mentioned that new versions would be [...] "coming out, but just not yet". Describing the song as [...] "one of [...] more mellow productions", Madonna composed [...] "Living for Love" [...] as a break-up song, commenting, [...] "lots of people write about being in love and being happy or they write about having a broken heart and being inconsolable. But nobody writes about having a broken heart and being hopeful and triumphant afterwards. So I thought, how can I do this? I didn't want to share the sentiment of being a victim.

[...] The singer further confessed that the clip draws inspiration from dark fantasy horror film Paperhouse (1988) in order to achieve surreality. Lee further explained, [...] " [...] this girl, and everything that she would draw would come to life in her dreams, and she was creating this dream world for herself. And at first, it was cool, but then it's like this nightmare. So I sort of thought it would apply, and be cool, to have it be this dream that you're trapped in. So you're in a place that, at first, is a magical world, but at the same time, you're isolated and trapped there, and that's the reason you {{want to come back to}} reality after a time." [...] When filming the video, fiber optics were used reportedly in order to create the effect of things coming to life after drawing them. Lee described the appearance of the rest of the group in the visual as [...] "sort <b>of</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> dream within the dream, in an abyss of darkness".|$|E
