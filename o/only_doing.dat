5|$|Beata {{reveals that}} {{they are aware of}} four male {{survivors}} of the Odin who have caused disruption in their society, and are considered fugitives. Beata requests Riker stay with her (and later requests that he order Troi, Data, and Yar to track down the survivors' camp and their leader Ramsey (Sam Hennings), while staying and dining with her). After some back and forth, Data concludes Ramsey and the survivors of the Odin would have platinum with them, and Angel One is naturally devoid of platinum, allowing the Enterprise to easily detect them. Meanwhile, Riker dresses in the garb given to him for his dinner with Beata, Troi and Yar taunt him for dressing in clothes that sexualize him and in some ways demean him, and he is <b>only</b> <b>doing</b> it to win favor with Beata. He responds by saying he is honoring the local customs, and acknowledges Beata's beauty, and that the garb is rather comfortable.|$|E
25|$|She {{says she}} {{instructed}} her attorneys to call White’s family {{and tell them}} she wanted no money from them and was <b>only</b> <b>doing</b> {{what she had to}} do to get her own insurance company to pay for her medical costs, but most fans never knew about that or about Tennessee's insurance law. They saw only the headlines about the lawsuit against the family who had lost a son. Before the case went to trial, she adds, her insurance company filed for bankruptcy. Her record and ticket sales fell off “in a big way,” Mandrell says.|$|E
25|$|In {{its basic}} operations, the Israel Lobby is no {{different}} from the farm lobby, steel or textile workers’ unions, or other ethnic lobbies. There is nothing improper about American Jews and their Christian allies attempting to sway US policy: the Lobby’s activities are not a conspiracy of the sort depicted in tracts like the Protocols of the Elders of Zion. For the most part, the individuals and groups that comprise it are <b>only</b> <b>doing</b> what other special interest groups do, but doing it very much better. By contrast, pro-Arab interest groups, in so far as they exist at all, are weak, which makes the Israel Lobby’s task even easier.|$|E

60|$|The rider's sunburnt {{face turned}} white. A few times Jane had seen Lassiter's cool calm broken--when {{he had met}} little Fay, when he had learned how and why {{he had come to}} love both child and mistress, when he had stood beside Milly Erne's grave. But one and all they could not be {{considered}} in the light of his present agitation. Not <b>only</b> <b>did</b> Lassiter turn white--not <b>only</b> <b>did</b> he grow tense, not <b>only</b> <b>did</b> he lose his coolness, but also he suddenly, violently, hungrily took her into his arms and crushed her to his breast.|$|R
25|$|Kotoōshū managed {{only three}} double-figure scores in 2006, and {{none at all}} in 2007, <b>only</b> <b>doing</b> enough to {{maintain}} his rank. Shortly before the November 2007 tournament he dislocated his right knee in training. Clearly troubled by the injury he pulled out on the 7th day, {{the first time in}} his career that he has had to withdraw from a tournament. He preserved his ōzeki rank with a 9–6 score in January 2008. In the Osaka tournament of March 2008 he injured his left arm in a match with Kakuryū on the 4th day and withdrew on Day 9 with only two wins. There was speculation that he would be demoted to sekiwake in the following tournament in May.|$|E
25|$|Williams {{was given}} {{specific}} instructions {{to lighten the}} tone of the stories, thus playing to Baker's strengths. However, the first three stories (which were geared towards the previous style) had already been commissioned. Robert Holmes had agreed to stay on to edit them, but he ended up leaving after <b>only</b> <b>doing</b> the first two, Horror of Fang Rock and The Invisible Enemy. The task of editing Image of the Fendahl fell to his successor Anthony Read. The season was only narrowly finished. With the cast and crew suffering from burnout and lack of resources, the season finale The Invasion of Time was completed largely by virtue of it having been written to make use of preexisting sets, props, and costumes.|$|E
25|$|In season two, Wolf {{has been}} {{released}} on home detention. He {{has no intention of}} keeping to Cheryl's new rules on life. Judd is determined to tear him away from Cheryl, and attempts to entice Wolf to break his parole so that he is returned to prison. Wolf escapes home detention and Judd moves in, much to the horror of the children. Pascalle starts to date Pakistani doctor Bruce, Van finds {{the love of his life}} Aurora and Loretta starts to date much older man Hayden. Jethro shocks his mother when he reveals he is still a criminal and <b>only</b> <b>doing</b> law to learn how to break the law more successfully. The season ends on Wolf framing Judd for a robbery he committed.|$|E

25|$|As soon as Carbunkle {{is arrested}} on {{suspicion}} of attempted murder, everything is back to normal. Unaware that Sara listening, Pat expresses that he is <b>only</b> <b>doing</b> this competition to win the flight tickets for their honeymoon. Sara is suddenly heard calling Pat's name. Once Pat catches sight of Sara, it dawns on him that Sara has heard the truth about why he entered the competition, and is fully aware of Carbunkle's plan. Now fully aware that Sara has forgiven him, Pat decides to do his act, but decides to change the act slightly. Sara also takes part in the act. They both win the holiday to Italy, but pass the recording contract to Josh, so Wilf is happy too, and all is forgiven.|$|E
25|$|In 1982, Beuys {{recorded}} a music video {{for a song}} he had written entitled “Sonne statt Reagan” which translates to “Sun, not Rain/Reagan” This was an anti-Reagan political piece that included some clever puns in German and continued to reinforce {{some of the key}} messages of Beuys' career—namely an extremely liberal, pacifist political attitude; a desire to perpetuate open discourse on art and politics; a refusal to sanctify his own image and ‘artistic reputation’ by <b>only</b> <b>doing</b> the kinds of work other people expected he would do; and above all an openness to exploring different media forms to get across the messages he wanted to convey. His continued commitment to the demystification and dis-institutionalization of the ‘art world’ was never more clear than it is here.|$|E
25|$|Bill Oberst, {{the actor}} playing Sherman, {{states in a}} behind-the-scenes {{featurette}} that while the general {{will always be a}} controversial figure, he hopes that the documentary will shed light on why the man did what he did. It emphasizes that Sherman was loved by the enslaved blacks whom he freed and that while he did not see himself as fighting to destroy slavery, he nevertheless made a point of treating blacks whom he met with courtesy and respect. (The documentary also shows the reactions of his soldiers as they met blacks along the March. Many had never seen a black person and were surprised to learn that blacks were ordinary people.) The documentary also mentions that Sherman killed far fewer Confederate soldiers and civilians than did Ulysses S. Grant, his friend and fellow general, yet Sherman was the one vilified. The scholars interviewed postulate that the South had need for a scapegoat {{in the wake of the}} Civil War and that Sherman was the easiest target. For his part, Sherman is stated to have seen himself as <b>only</b> <b>doing</b> his duty and that he did not care what people said about him one way or the other.|$|E

25|$|There is also {{inconsistency}} as {{to whether}} the Doctor can recognise his own future incarnations. In the original series, the Doctors usually have no difficulty recognising one another (in The Three Doctors, the First, Second, and Third Doctors all know one another on sight. However, in The Five Doctors, the First Doctor does not recognise the Fifth Doctor as himself and needs to be introduced by the Fifth as his fourth regeneration. In Time Crash, after the TARDIS is at different points in its own timeline merge due to downed shields, the Fifth Doctor spends much of the mini-episode believing that the Tenth was merely a fan who had somehow gotten into his TARDIS, having somehow altered the 'desktop theme'; the Tenth Doctor constantly tries to convince his younger self that he is his future self, <b>only</b> <b>doing</b> so by using a predestination paradox to cancel out a universe-destroying black hole with a supernova by blowing up the TARDIS. When the Tenth and the Eleventh Doctor meet each other in The Day Of The Doctor, the Tenth Doctor appears to sceptically recognise his successor, yet he appears to be fully convinced only after both compare their respective sonic screwdrivers. The War Doctor on the other hand is initially completely oblivious to meet two of his future regenerations (initially mistaking them for future companions), again being convinced by their sonic screwdrivers.|$|E

500|$|Historian Reuth {{observes that}} the modern German image of Rommel (a result of the Historikerstreit in the 1980s and debates on war guilt during the 1990s), as {{represented}} most notably by Maurice Remy, is that of both a National Socialist and a hero of the Resistance. Reuth argues that [...] "Rommel was neither one nor the other. He had understood neither National Socialism, nor the resistance to it. Like millions of Germans he followed Hitler into disaster and whilst doing so he believed he was <b>only</b> <b>doing</b> his duty".|$|E
500|$|Although in the UK {{it reached}} number three, lacklustre {{publicity}} {{on the part}} of Capitol Records led to weak sales in the US, and a chart position of number70.

[...] "But they needed to be bigger in the United States, where they were <b>only</b> <b>doing</b> 200,000 units. They were very much an album act – no singles – which was bad news for us.

500|$|Jennings Bryant {{conducted}} a two-year {{longitudinal study of}} the effects of Blue's Clues at the University of Alabama in 2001 to ascertain whether or not the show's curriculum goals were achieved. He compared regular viewers and non-viewers and found that the show's episode repetition strategy improved children's comprehension while holding their attention and increasing their participation, which suggested that watching Blue's Clues increased children's learning and social interactions. At the end of the study, regular viewers outperformed the non-viewers, solving problems more successfully and systematically. Anderson stated, [...] "Given the program's large audience, it appears that the program is not <b>only</b> <b>doing</b> well, but it is also doing good." ...|$|E
