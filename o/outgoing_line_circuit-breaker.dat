30|$|The {{rationality}} {{can also}} be verified by comparative analysis between two nodes. For example, node 5 and 9 have {{the same number of}} incoming and <b>outgoing</b> <b>lines.</b> Flow value rankings of two incoming <b>lines</b> and two <b>outgoing</b> <b>lines</b> of node 5 are 2 nd, 7 th and 4 th, 6 th. Flow value rankings of two incoming <b>lines</b> and two <b>outgoing</b> <b>lines</b> of node 9 are 9 th, 13 th and 14 th, 17 th. Therefore, node 5 is more important than node 9 for larger power flow values of its incoming and <b>outgoing</b> <b>lines.</b> In method 1, the importance rankings of two nodes are 3 rd and 6 th, which accord with actual situation. However, in method 2, the importance rankings of two nodes are much closer {{due to the fact that}} they have the same number of <b>outgoing</b> and incoming <b>lines.</b> It is unreasonable. Similarly, the analysis can be applied to nodes 2 and 6. It shows that node importance ranking of power grid without consideration of power flow is determined by the topology of power grid to a greater extent. It is inconsistent with practical situation of power grid.|$|R

30|$|The {{importance}} {{ranking of}} node 89 is 2 nd in method 1. This node has 4 <b>outgoing</b> <b>lines.</b> The flow value rankings of these lines are 5 th, 12 th, 22 nd and 33 rd of total 197 lines in IEEE 118 -bus system. The generator connected to node 89 {{has the largest}} active power output (13.19  % of total active power output of all generators). Node 66 is connected to a load and a generator.

The first two <b>outgoing</b> <b>lines</b> {{are connected to the}} critical nodes 49 and 65. The importance of these two nodes ranks at 3 rd and 4 th of 118 nodes, respectively. Active power output of the generator ranks at 5 th of all generators, which is 8.52  % of total active power output of all generators. However, nodes 89 and 66 cannot be found in the top 20 nodes of methods 2 and 3.|$|R
30|$|Node 30 is {{connected}} to no load or generator. However, nodes 8 and 26, whose importance ranks at 7 th and 26 th, are connected to node 30. The flow value rankings of the two corresponding incoming lines are 7 th, 20 th. Nodes 17 and 38, whose importance ranks at 23 rd and 24 th, are also connected to node 30. The flow value rankings of the two corresponding <b>outgoing</b> <b>lines</b> are 9 th, 29 th. Therefore, node 30 ranks at 18 th in method 1 because not only authority scores and hub scores of its adjacent points but also the weights of its incoming and <b>outgoing</b> <b>lines</b> are large. It reflects the key idea of MBCC-HITS algorithm.|$|R

Flow value rankings of its <b>outgoing</b> and incoming <b>line</b> are 18 th and 11 th.|$|R
30|$|As to a node {{of power}} grid, its {{importance}} is determined in aspects of inflow and outflow power. Therefore, {{the importance of}} a node depends on the numbers and importance of incoming and <b>outgoing</b> <b>lines,</b> as well as the importance of nodes connected to this node.|$|R
30|$|The {{comparison}} of node importance rankings between methods 1 and 2 is {{to verify the}} rationality of the modification based on power flow. As is shown in Table  2, node 1 {{is the most important}} node in method 1. This node has two <b>outgoing</b> <b>lines</b> and is connected to a generator. The active power output of the generator equals 232.84  MW, which is 89.90  % of total active load in IEEE 14 -bus system. The flow values of two <b>outgoing</b> <b>lines</b> are the first and second largest of total twenty lines in IEEE 14 -bus system. So node 1 is a fairly vital node of IEEE 14 -bus system, which is consistent with the node importance ranking of method 1. However, in method 2, the importance ranking of node 1 is 13 th and the importance ranking of node 4 which has the most <b>outgoing</b> and incoming <b>lines</b> is 1 st. It shows that the node importance ranking without consideration of power flow is unreasonable.|$|R
30|$|Node 70 ranks at 14 th and 6 th in methods 2 and 3, respectively. However it ranks only at 63 rd in method 1. This node has 2 {{incoming}} <b>lines</b> and 3 <b>outgoing</b> <b>lines.</b> Flow {{values of}} incoming and <b>outgoing</b> <b>lines</b> are very small. They just rank at 74 th, 152 nd and 118 th, 161 st, 168 th, respectively. This node {{is connected to}} a load and a generator. The output of the generator just ranks at 24 th of total 54 generators. The load ranks at 22 nd of total 99 loads. The above facts result in a lower ranking of this node in method 1. Similarly, node 19 ranks 19 th in method 3 but 83 rd in method 1. Flow value rankings of its <b>outgoing</b> and incoming <b>lines</b> are 111 th, 135 th, 175 th and 150 th. The output of generator connected to it ranks at 29 th.

30|$|Nodes 10 and 9 form a unit connection. Active {{power output}} of the {{generator}} connected to node 10 is the third largest (9.78  % of total active power output of all generators). Although these two nodes have few <b>outgoing</b> <b>lines</b> and incoming lines, flow rankings of line 10 – 9 and 9 – 8 rank at first and second of total lines. The above facts show {{that the importance of}} these two nodes is much significant and close. Nodes 8 and 5 are downstream nodes of the unit connection. Flow value ranking of line 8 – 5 is 3 rd. These two nodes play an importance role in transmitting power from node 10 to other nodes through many <b>outgoing</b> <b>lines</b> of them. Besides, both of the two nodes are connected to loads and generators. Therefore, nodes 8 and 5 are a little more important than nodes 9 and 10.

30|$|Doubly-fed {{induction}} generator (DFIG)-based wind farm has the characteristic of transient fault {{with low voltage}} ride through (LVRT) capability. A new three-phase fault direction identification method for the <b>outgoing</b> transmission <b>line</b> of the wind farm is presented. The ability of the new directional relay to differentiate between a three-phase fault in one direction or the other is obtained by using the increment of phase angle difference between the memory voltage signal and the fault current signal within a certain time, and using the amplitude variation of the fault current. It can be inferred that the fault current is supplied by the wind farm whether the phase angle differs or the current amplitude varies considerably. Different fault locations at the <b>outgoing</b> transmission <b>line</b> have been simulated by PSCAD/EMTDC to evaluate the reliability and sensitivity of the proposed technique. Results show that the new directional relay is of faster response when a three-phase fault occurs at the <b>outgoing</b> transmission <b>line</b> of a DFIG-based wind farm.|$|R

We use these properties to calculate, given an initial position and a final position, how many times we have to fire each node to finish the game or we can draw the conclusion that the game will never terminate.
