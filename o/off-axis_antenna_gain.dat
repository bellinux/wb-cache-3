Proper calibration of the Open Radar Data Acquisition (ORDA) receiver path and noise test path is necessary to obtain accurate estimates of the WSR- 88 D <b>antenna</b> <b>gain.</b> This paper presents {{a discussion of the}} <b>antenna</b> <b>gain</b> calibration path, explains the algorithms used to compute <b>antenna</b> <b>gain</b> and beamwidth, presents the manufacturer's <b>antenna</b> <b>gain</b> and beamwidth measurements and provides actual field data from WSR- 88 D ORDA sites. 2 SUNCHECK BASICS <b>Antenna</b> <b>Gain</b> is important to computing accurate reflectivity of weather data. In order to calibrate WSR- 88 D <b>antenna</b> <b>gain,</b> the sun is used as the data source. The source provides a stable, known input because its location in space is known, its size is known and its output power can be measured. In the WSR- 88 D, the Suncheck calibration routine determines three parameters: antenna positioning offsets, antenna beamwidth, and <b>antenna</b> <b>gain.</b> Suncheck Subtest 1 computes antenna offsets and beamwidth. Suncheck Subtest 2 calibrates <b>Antenna</b> <b>Gain,</b> which encompasses the <b>gain</b> of the <b>antenna</b> dish and microwave losses. Both subtests require accurate time and site location information. The Open Radar Data Acquisition (ORDA) upgrade to the WSR- 88 D added a GPS unit for accurate system time. The site latitude and longitude can also be obtained from the GPS unit. These values are stored in each site’s adaptation data...|$|R

50|$|<b>Antenna</b> <b>gain</b> {{is closely}} related to {{directivity}} and often incorrectly used interchangeably. However, gain is always less than directivity by a factor called radiation efficiency, η. Whereas directivity is entirely a function of wavelength and the geometry and type of <b>antenna,</b> <b>gain</b> takes into account the losses that always occur in the real world. Specifically, accelerating charge (time varying current) causes electromagnetic radiation per Maxwell's equations. Therefore, antennas use a current distribution on radiating elements to generate electromagnetic energy that propagates away from the antenna. This coupling is never 100% efficient (by Laws of Thermodynamics), and therefore <b>antenna</b> <b>gain</b> will always be less than directivity by this efficiency factor.|$|R
