50|$|The {{electronics}} within ICP accelerometers require {{excitation power}} from a constant-current regulated, DC voltage source. This power source is sometimes built into vibration meters, FFT analyzers, and vibration data collectors. A separate signal conditioner is required when none {{is built into}} the readout. In addition to providing the required excitation, power supplies may also incorporate additional signal conditioning, such as gain, filtering, buffering, and <b>overload</b> <b>indication.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{automatic}} fruit-transportation gyro car {{works in}} the economic forest; the designed Gyro car sorting, weighing & obstacle avoidance system based on ARM with GPRS control. Gyro is specially designed in such way that it moves from one station to another in forest. Gyro car has three compartments for three colors of fruit & Gyro car is provided with inbuilt sorting mechanism with a robotic arm with RGB Sensor. Sorting mechanism sort the fruit individually in the same gyro car at each station in forest {{on the basis of}} color of fruit. Our gyro car moves from one station to another on path follower mechanism. Gyro car stops at each station for a particular time period. It also provided with <b>overload</b> <b>indication.</b> Whole working is divided in two sections one as control room and another is working area where Gyro car moves. Real time weight of the fruits is seen on the LCD module. Communication between gyro car & control unit takes place through GPRS module. Our gyro car also provided Ultrasonic sensor which is used to avoid accident by obstacle in its path. When obstacle in its path, alert by buzzer in control room. Key Points: Fruit collection & sorting, weight measurement, Obstacle avoidance, <b>overload</b> <b>indication,</b> communication through GPRS module etc...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{key issue}} at a branch-point switch for {{multicasting}} (point-to-multipoint) available bit rate (ABR) flow control {{is how to}} consolidate backward resource management (BRM) cells returning from each branch to avoid feedback implosion. However, consolidating BRM cells at a branch point can cause undesirable effects such as consolidation noise, consolidation delay, and consolidation loss. This paper first investigates the consolidation problems and proposes their solutions. Furthermore, this paper introduces various implementation alternatives for the proposed solutions. A combination of the proposed solutions, in which each branch point stores feedback information on a per-branch basis for each multicast virtual connection and only passes BRM cells returning from the farthest destination, provides a good fairness, a higher efficiency, and an excellent scalability. In addition, if a fast <b>overload</b> <b>indication</b> is additionally employed, the feedback delay can be significantly reduced in an overload situation.

40|$|Abstract [...] The {{automatic}} fruit-transportation gyro car {{works in}} the economic forest; the designed Gyrocar sorting, weighing & obstacle avoidance system based on ARM. gyro is specially designed in such way that it moves from one station to another in forest. Gyrocar has three compartments for three colour of fruit & Gyrocar is provided with inbuilt sorting mechanism with an robotic arm with RGB Sensor. Sorting mechanism sort the fruit individually in three different compartments in same gyrocar at each station in forest {{on the basis of}} colour of fruit. Our gyrocar moves from one station to another on path follower mechanism. Gyrocar stops at each station within a particular time period; it can also be manually operated. it also provided with overload alert, if weight of fruit in car exceed above an certain limit by buzzer available in a control room. Whole working is divided in two section one as control room and another is working area where car moves. Real time weight of fruit can be seen on LCD available on same gyrocar as well as in control room with the help of RFTx & RFRx. Our gyrocar also provided Ultrasonic sensor which is used to avoid accident by obstacle in its path. When obstacle in its path, alert by buzzer in control room.
