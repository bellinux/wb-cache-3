5|$|Despite {{originally}} {{being told}} by Redknapp he was not of Division <b>One</b> <b>standard,</b> let alone suitable for the Premier League, Primus proved his manager wrong by seizing his chance when other players missed out through injury and suspension.

He scored once that season for Portsmouth in the League Cup against Peterborough United. Primus credits his renaissance to his conversion to Christianity after a friend of his wife's invited him to church.|$|E

5|$|Radiocarbon {{dates are}} {{generally}} {{presented with a}} range of <b>one</b> <b>standard</b> deviation (usually represented by the Greek letter sigma as 1σ) {{on either side of the}} mean. However, a date range of 1σ represents only 68% confidence level, so the true age of the object being measured may lie outside the range of dates quoted. This was demonstrated in 1970 by an experiment run by the British Museum radiocarbon laboratory, in which weekly measurements were taken on the same sample for six months. The results varied widely (though consistently with a normal distribution of errors in the measurements), and included multiple date ranges (of 1σ confidence) that did not overlap with each other. The measurements included one with a range from about 4250 to about 4390 years ago, and another with a range from about 4520 to about 4690.|$|E
