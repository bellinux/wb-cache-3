5|$|The Brookwood Cemetery Act 1975 {{authorised}} the cemetery's owners (at {{that time}} Maximilian Investments) to sell surplus land within the cemetery's boundaries, {{leading to the}} construction of a major office development {{on the site of the}} former Superintendent's office, near the former level crossing between the northern and southern cemeteries. The masonry works remained operational until the early 1980s, and were then converted into <b>office</b> <b>buildings</b> <b>and</b> named Stonemason's Court. In March 1985 the cemetery was bought by Ramadan Güney, whose family still owns the cemetery as of 2011. The Guney family embarked on a programme of encouraging new burials in the cemetery, and of slowly clearing the overgrown sections of the cemetery.|$|E
5|$|From 1912 to 1917, {{the state}} {{acquired}} {{all of the}} 541separate properties that comprise the Eighth Ward east of the capitol. The Eighth Ward was situated between the capitol {{and a set of}} railroad tracks, then owned by the Pennsylvania Railroad. Arnold Brunner was hired in 1916 to develop new accommodations for state government, which had already outgrown the capitol. He introduced his plan in 1920, which called, first, for the demolition of the Eighth Ward. Brunner planned two office buildings behind the capitol, the North and South <b>Office</b> <b>Buildings,</b> <b>and</b> these were separated by a courtyard he named the People's Court. The South Office Building was completed in 1921. The leveling of the Eighth Ward was finished in 1925.|$|E

Yoot Towers gameplay {{is similar to that}} of SimTower—players build hotels, resorts, and <b>office</b> <b>buildings,</b> <b>and</b> work towards building a five-star tower. Sega launched a version of SimTower for the Game Boy Advance, called The Tower SP, in Japan on April 28, 2005, and in the United States on March 15, 2006. A version of SimTower called The Tower DS was published by DigiToys in Japan on June 26, 2008. Yoot Tower was also released for iPad devices via the online iOS App Store.|$|E

5|$|As Alliance Property and the Great Southern Group had {{between them}} {{stripped}} all assets {{other than the}} cemetery itself and development within the cemetery was prohibited, the LNC had little apparent value. However, Maximilian Investments secured passage of the Brookwood Cemetery Act 1975, authorising them to sell land within the operational area of the cemetery. The former Superintendent's office housing the LNC's offices, near the level crossing where the Necropolis Railway had passed between {{the northern and southern}} cemeteries, was sold for office development. Following the sale the offices of the LNC, renamed Brookwood Cemetery Ltd at this time, were moved into a small former caretaker's lodge. With little storage space in the new makeshift offices, the majority of the LNC's records were destroyed during the move. Tracts of land within the cemetery were sold to various religious groups and to wealthy families for use as private burial grounds, and a tract of unused land south of the Glades of Remembrance was sold to Woking Clay Pigeon Club. The masonry works remained operational until the early 1980s, although not under LNC management after the early 1960s, and were then converted into <b>office</b> <b>buildings</b> <b>and</b> named Stonemason's Court.|$|E
5|$|Throughout Linfa's {{passage of}} Japan, the storm brought heavy {{rainfall}} {{across a wide}} swath of the country, resulting in extensive and damaging flooding. Damage was primarily concentrated on Kyushu Island. Precipitation peaked at 727mm (28.62in) at a station in Nakagoya, Miyazaki Prefecture. However, a station in Owase, Mie observed 497mm (19.56in) of rain in 24hours, greater than any other location for that period of time. Despite making landfall on Ehime Prefecture, Linfa did not cause as much damage there relative to other provinces, particularly those bordering Ehime. Nonetheless, nearly 300homes lost power during the storm there. Linfa's worst impacts occurred in Kōchi Prefecture, where severe flooding inundated several buildings and triggered numerous landslides. Damage there totaled ¥1.28billion (US$10.7million). Similar effects took place in Tokushima Prefecture, in addition to widespread evacuations from impacted areas. Damage accrued by Linfa in Tokushima Prefecture reached ¥1.22billion (US$10.3million). Located near the coast, high seas generated by Linfa were reported in Wakayama Prefecture, resulting in cancellations of offshore activities and transportation. However, much of the damage in Wakayama Prefecture was caused by torrential precipitation, damaging roads in seven locations, amounting to ¥197.45million (US$1.65million). Severe flooding in Mie Prefecture resulted from heavy, prolonged rainfall, which peaked prefecture-wide at 497mm (19.57in) in Owase. Precipitation in Mie caused widespread power outages. As many as 65buildings were flooded, and approximately 87ha (215ac) of arable land was inundated by rainwater. In addition to surface inundation, the rains caused twenty landslides, blocking roads the traffic and suspending some rail operations. Power outages were also widespread in Hyōgo Prefecture, including a localized outage stripping electricity from 900homes in the Kita-ku ward in Kobe; similar impacts occurred in Osaka Prefecture. Rising floodwater in Kanagawa Prefecture engulfed the first floors of several <b>office</b> <b>buildings</b> <b>and</b> residences. The rain also deluged roads in Yokohama, Fujisawa, Chigasaki and Odawara.|$|E

25|$|Aside from {{buildings}} {{used for}} business and institutions, residential developments have also been built, many of which consist of high-rise <b>office</b> <b>buildings</b> <b>and</b> suburban residential communities. An example of a new high rise residential complex is Asmita Gardens.

25|$|Many {{high-rise}} <b>office</b> <b>buildings,</b> <b>and</b> apartment complexes, {{along with}} some hotels built in the 1950s dramatically altered the skyline.

While Reston takes on the statistical properties of an edge city, its tightly controlled design averted several problems they typically face, such as hostile pedestrian situations and lack of mass transit. Many of the neighborhoods in Reston were designed to be medium density, which is atypical of an edge city. In other ways it is a textbook example, with a majority of medium-rise <b>office</b> <b>buildings,</b> <b>and</b> some citizens opposed to the expansion of its high-density core.|$|E
