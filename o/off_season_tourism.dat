The benefits of such events seem lucrative; {{the very fact that}} many countries bid to host these events suggests that the benefits – be they tangible or intangible – more often than not outweigh the costs. Using a standard gravity model of bilateral tourism flows between 200 countries from 1995 to 2006, this paper measures a very direct benefit of such mega-events: the increase in tourist arrivals to the host country. In general, results suggest that mega-events promote tourism but the gain varies {{depending on the type of}} mega-event, the participating countries, the host country’s level of development, and whether the event is held during the peak <b>season</b> or <b>off</b> <b>season.</b> Sport mega-events, <b>tourism,</b> World Cup, Olympic Games, trade...|$|R
