5|$|Bethe {{continued}} to do research on supernovae, neutron stars, black holes, and other problems in theoretical astrophysics into his late nineties. In doing this, he collaborated with Gerald E. Brown of Stony Brook University. In 1978, Brown proposed that they collaborate on supernovae. These were reasonably well understood by this time, but the calculations were still a problem. Using techniques honed from decades of working with nuclear physics, and some experience with calculations involving nuclear explosions, Bethe tackled the problems involved in stellar gravitational collapse, {{and the way in}} which various factors affected a supernova explosion. <b>Once</b> <b>again,</b> <b>he</b> was able to reduce the problem to a set of differential equations, and solve them.|$|E

Two months later, he scored a vital goal in a 2–0 victory over Lincoln City, which helped Torquay to only their second home victory in four months and move them 13points clear of the relegation zone. Torquay finished the season only two places higher than their previous campaign, but 15points above relegated Halifax Town. During his disrupted three seasons with Torquay, Brandon amassed 83appearances with ten goals to his credit, before he moved to Chesterfield in July 2002 on a free transfer.|$|E
