5|$|Environmental {{sociology}} is {{the study}} of human interactions with the natural environment, typically emphasizing human dimensions <b>of</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>problems,</b> social impacts of those problems, and efforts to resolve them. As with other sub-fields of sociology, scholarship in environmental sociology may be at one or multiple levels of analysis, from global (e.g. world-systems) to local, societal to individual. Attention is paid also to the processes by which environmental problems become defined and known to humans. As argued by notable environmental sociologist John Bellamy Foster, the predecessor to modern environmental sociology is Marx's analysis of the metabolic rift, which influenced contemporary thought on sustainability. Environmental sociology is often interdisciplinary and overlaps with the sociology of risk, rural sociology and the sociology of disaster.|$|E

Such increased awareness can induce more environmentally conscious behavior. Tourism has had a positive effect on wildlife preservation and protection efforts, notably in Africa but also in South America, Asia, Australia, and the South Pacific.|$|E
25|$|Geologists use a {{wide variety}} of methods to {{understand}} the Earth's structure and evolution, including field work, rock description, geophysical techniques, chemical analysis, physical experiments, and numerical modelling. In practical terms, geology is important for mineral and hydrocarbon exploration and exploitation, evaluating water resources, understanding of natural hazards, the remediation <b>of</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>problems,</b> and providing insights into past climate change. Geology, a major academic discipline, also plays a role in geotechnical engineering.|$|E

25|$|Another {{group of}} critics, {{generally}} {{of the political}} left, argues that Ehrlich emphasizes overpopulation too much as a problem in itself, instead of distribution of resources. Barry Commoner argued that Ehrlich emphasized overpopulation too much as the source <b>of</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>problems,</b> and that his proposed solutions were politically unacceptable because of the coercion that they implied, and because they would cost poor people disproportionately. He argued that technological, and above all social development {{would result in a}} natural decrease of both population growth and environmental damage. Ehrlich denies any type of racism, and has argued that if his policy ideas were implemented properly they would not be repressive.|$|E
25|$|The {{treatment}} <b>of</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>problems</b> through biological {{means is}} known as bioremediation and the specific use of plants for example by using phytoremediation. Bioremediation is sometimes {{used in conjunction with}} a pump and treat system. In bioremediation, either naturally occurring or specially bred bacteria are used to consume contaminants from extracted groundwater. This is sometimes referred to as a bio-gac system. Many times the groundwater is recycled to allow for continuously flowing water and enhanced bacteria population growth. Occasionally the bacteria can build up to such a point that they can affect filtration and pumping. The vessel should then be partially drained. Care must be taken to ensure that a sharp change in the groundwater chemistry does not kill the bacteria (such as a sudden change in pH).|$|E
40|$|In a {{previous}} article about {{life cycle assessment}} (LCA), a methodological framework was proposed and two components of this framework were discussed in more detail: the goal definition and the inventory. In this second article, the other components of the framework are discussed in detail: the classification, the valuation and the improvement analysis. In the classification, resource extractions and emissions associated with {{the life cycle of}} a product are translated into contributions to a number <b>of</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>problem</b> types, such as resource depletion, global warming, ozone depletion, acidification, etc. For this, each extraction and emission is multiplied with a so-called classification factor and the multiplication results are aggregated per problem type. Classification factors are proposed for a number <b>of</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>problem</b> types. The valuation includes both a valuation <b>of</b> the different <b>environmental</b> <b>problem</b> types and an assessment of {{the reliability and validity of}} the results. For the valuation <b>of</b> the <b>environmental</b> <b>problem</b> types, qualitative or quantitative multicriterion analysis could be applied. Given a standard list of weighting factors the quantitative multicriterion analysis seems preferable, because of its low costs and its simplicity. The main problem, however, is to get a broadly supported standard list. In studies so far little attention is paid to th...|$|R

500|$|Lemurs are {{threatened}} by a host <b>of</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>problems,</b> including deforestation, hunting for bushmeat, live capture for the exotic pet trade, and climate change. All species are listed by CITES on Appendix I, which prohibits trade of specimens or parts, except for scientific purposes. As of 2005, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) listed 16% of all lemur species as critically endangered, 23% as endangered, 25% as vulnerable, 28% as [...] "data deficient", and only 8% as least concern. Over the next five years, at least 28species were newly identified, none of which have had their conservation status assessed. Many {{are likely to be}} considered threatened since the new lemur species that have been described recently are typically confined to small regions. Given the rate of continued habitat destruction, undiscovered species could go extinct before being identified. Since the arrival of humans on the island approximately 2000years ago, all endemic Malagasy vertebrates over 10kg (22lb) have disappeared, including 17species, 8genera, and 3families of lemurs. The IUCN Species Survival Commission (IUCN/SSC), the International Primatological Society (IPS), and Conservation International (CI) have included as many as five lemurs in their biennial [...] "Top 25 Most Endangered Primates". The 2008–2010 list includes the greater bamboo lemur, gray-headed lemur (Eulemur cinereiceps), blue-eyed black lemur (Eulemur flavifrons), northern sportive lemur (Lepilemur septentrionalis), and silky sifaka. In 2012, an assessment by the Primate Specialist Group of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) concluded that 90% of the then 103described species of lemur should be listed as threatened on the IUCN Red List, making lemurs the most endangered group of mammals. The IUCN reiterated its concern in 2013, noting that 90% of all lemur species could be extinct within 20 to 25years unless a $7million USD 3-year conservation plan aimed at helping local communities can be implemented.|$|E

2500|$|Guiyu in the Shantou {{region of}} China {{is a massive}} {{electronic}} waste processing community. It {{is often referred to}} as the [...] "e-waste capital of the world." [...] Traditionally, Guiyu was an agricultural community; however, in the mid-1990s it transformed into an e-waste recycling center involving over 75% of the local households and an additional 100,000 migrant workers. Thousands of individual workshops employ laborers to snip cables, pry chips from circuit boards, grind plastic computer cases into particles, and dip circuit boards in acid baths to dissolve the precious metals. Others work to strip insulation from all wiring in an attempt to salvage tiny amounts of copper wire. Uncontrolled burning, disassembly, and disposal has led to a number <b>of</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>problems</b> such as groundwater contamination, atmospheric pollution, and water pollution either by immediate discharge or from surface runoff (especially near coastal areas), as well as health problems including occupational safety and health effects among those directly and indirectly involved, due to the methods of processing the waste.|$|E

For example, surface albedo, wind speed and humidity near the surface were decreased, whereas ground and near-surface air temperatures, vertical air dilution and ozone levels were increased. Because of the combined factors of urbanization and pollution caused by burning of fossil fuel, Beijing is often affected by serious environmental problems, which lead to health issues of many inhabitants. In 2013 heavy smog struck Beijing and most parts of northern China, in total 600 million people.
