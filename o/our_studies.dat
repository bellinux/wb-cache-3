2500|$|G.E. Moore {{dealt with}} casuistry in chapter 1.4 of his Principia Ethica, {{in which he}} claims that [...] "the defects of casuistry are not defects of principle; no {{objection}} {{can be taken to}} its aim and object. It has failed only because it is far too difficult a subject to be treated adequately in our present state of knowledge.” [...] Furthermore, he asserted that [...] "casuistry is the goal of ethical investigation. It cannot be safely attempted at the beginning of <b>our</b> <b>studies,</b> but only at the end." ...|$|E
2500|$|From {{the years}} 1956 until 1959, Jazani had no {{political}} activities. His wife {{in this matter}} wrote: in these years [...] "We had no thoughts of a political future, we relied on our love and in the advancement of <b>our</b> <b>studies.</b> We spent most of our free time reading and at the theaters". In 1959, he returned to politics and created a magazine named Nedaye Khalgh (ندای خلق) {{with the goal of}} uniting the politic groups against the coup d'ètat regime. In the winter of 1959, because of the tight political climate the circulation of the magazine was halted.|$|E
2500|$|Over {{the next}} few years, while trying to perfect the polio vaccine, Salk had begun working unannounced, on a cure for cancer. A 1958 article in The New York Times {{confirmed}} [...] "that he had been conducting experiments on cancer patients." [...] The news was leaked after a Pittsburgh newspaper, the Sun-Telegraph, {{reported that he had}} been giving injections to children suffering from cancer. Salk stated afterwards, [...] "It is true that we have been conducting experiments in many persons with a variety of cancer and cancer-like conditions ... but we have no treatment for cancer. <b>Our</b> <b>studies</b> are of a strictly exploratory nature..." [...] In 1965, he also said [...] "a vaccine for the common cold is a matter of time and of solving some technical problems." ...|$|E
30|$|The {{results from}} <b>our</b> <b>study</b> are {{consistent}} with the conclusions of Smith-Bindman et al. <b>Our</b> <b>study</b> gives a risk estimate of 9.1 % compared to 6.7 % (Smith-Bindman). ET is on average,thicker in BP than AE (p[*]=[*] 0.00135). Incidence of endometrial cancer is 3 % in <b>our</b> <b>study.</b>|$|R
30|$|Strengths of <b>our</b> <b>study</b> {{include the}} {{prospective}} study {{design and the}} carefully designed TIM intervention program. Other strengths of <b>our</b> <b>study</b> were the use of unintentional discrepancies (MTE) and their potential for harm (pADE) as outcome measures {{as well as a}} cost–benefit analysis. Finally, <b>our</b> <b>study</b> was performed at two different settings, which makes our results robust.|$|R

2500|$|During {{the winter}} of 1815–16 Peacock was {{regularly}} walking over to visit Shelley at Bishopgate. There he met Thomas Jefferson Hogg, and [...] "the winter was a mere Atticism. <b>Our</b> <b>studies</b> were exclusively Greek". In 1816 Shelley went abroad, and Peacock {{appears to have been}} entrusted with the task of finding the Shelleys a new residence. He fixed them near his own home at Great Marlow. Peacock received a pension from Shelley for a time, and was put into requisition to keep off wholly unauthorised intruders upon Shelley's hospitable household. Peacock was consulted about alterations in Shelley's Laon and Cythna, and Peacock's enthusiasm for Greek poetry probably had some influence on Shelley's work. Shelley's influence upon Peacock may be traced in the latter's poem of Rhododaphne, or the Thessalian Spell, published in 1818 and Shelley wrote a eulogistic review of it. [...] Peacock also wrote at this time the satirical novels Melincourt published in 1817 and Nightmare Abbey [...] published in 1818. Shelley made his final departure for Italy and the friends' agreement for mutual correspondence produced Shelley's magnificent descriptive letters from Italy, which otherwise might never have been written.|$|E

30|$|For the {{specific}} purpose of <b>our</b> <b>study,</b> we used only the dataset obtained from monocytes. The monocytes {{used in their}} study were harvested from cell culture; hence, they provided in vitro results and contributed a significant supplemental dataset for <b>our</b> <b>study.</b> The top 2000 monocyte-expressed genes from the in vitro results were selected for the integrated proteomics in <b>our</b> <b>study.</b>|$|R
30|$|<b>Our</b> <b>study</b> did {{not measure}} salivary {{buffering}} capacity or {{the proportion of}} xylitol-resistant MS strain, so {{there may be a}} benefit to xylitol that <b>our</b> <b>study</b> design did not account for.|$|R
30|$|There {{are several}} {{limitations}} of <b>our</b> <b>study.</b> First of all, <b>our</b> <b>study</b> had a retrospective nature {{and based on}} a small sample size. Postoperative or post-procedure pain scores, analgesic need and stone composition of the patients which can significantly affect the outcomes of the procedures were not evaluated in <b>our</b> <b>study.</b> Also we did not perform and compare a cost-effectivity analysis for F-URS and ESWL.|$|R
60|$|At {{eight o'clock}} or so, the gong sounded again for prayers in the dining-room, where the butler {{afterwards}} {{presided over a}} side-table, on which bread and cheese and beer were spread for such young gentlemen as desired to partake of those refreshments. The ceremonies concluded by the Doctor's saying, 'Gentlemen, we will resume <b>our</b> <b>studies</b> at seven to-morrow;' and then, for the first time, Paul saw Cornelia Blimber's eye, {{and saw that it}} was upon him. When the Doctor had said these words, 'Gentlemen, we will resume <b>our</b> <b>studies</b> at seven tomorrow,' the pupils bowed again, and went to bed.|$|E

30|$|Similar to <b>our</b> <b>study,</b> Shigella flexneri was {{the most}} common species of Shigella {{isolated}} in Nepal by Khan et al. (2013) and Kanskar et al. (2007). Higher resistance of Shigella spp. than in <b>our</b> <b>study</b> was observed for trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole, ampicillin, nalidixic acid, and ciprofloxacin in study done by Khan et al. (2013). But rate of resistance to gentamicin was similar to <b>our</b> <b>study</b> (Khan et al. 2013).|$|R
30|$|Congruent with <b>our</b> <b>study,</b> Srinivas D et al. {{studied the}} {{incidence}} of meningitis in 5449 elective procedures and the prophylactic antibiotic used was cefotaxime 1  g similar to <b>our</b> <b>study</b> except that in <b>our</b> <b>study</b> we used unasyn in addition, {{the incidence of}} meningitis was 2.2 % which {{is very close to}} our incidence 2.1 % and the causative organisms were mostly gram-negative bacteria (Srinivas et al. 2011).|$|R
30|$|In this section, {{we present}} the key {{settings}} of <b>our</b> <b>study.</b> Section 3.1 presents our definition and categorization of code-anomaly agglomerations. Section 3.2 describes {{the research questions}} answered in this paper. Finally, Section 3.3 describes the target systems of <b>our</b> <b>study.</b> Section 3.4 will present more detailed procedures of <b>our</b> empirical <b>study.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "You are not {{required}} to criticise, thank you. Turned out of <b>our</b> <b>studies,</b> we are, just as if we were no better than little Manders minor. Only inky schoolboys we are, and must be treated as such." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am going}} for a long trip in {{southern}} Europe. Do you know that I have scarcely been away from this place for twenty years, so I mean to celebrate the conclusion of <b>our</b> <b>studies</b> by taking a holiday." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This, I am {{ashamed to}} say," [...] said Dr. Boomer, {{as they passed}} the {{imitation}} Greek portico of the old Concordia College building, [...] "is our original home, the fons et origo of <b>our</b> <b>studies,</b> our faculty of arts." ...|$|E
30|$|<b>Our</b> <b>study</b> reveals {{reduction}} in vascularity of the femoral-head remnant as a frequent occurrence after hip resurfacing. <b>Our</b> <b>study</b> also highlights {{the role of}} bone scintigraphy as tool in assessing the vascularity of resurfaced femoral heads.|$|R
30|$|The low {{numbers of}} Lewy body {{dementia}} patients limits <b>our</b> <b>study.</b> Although clinical follow-up was obtained through neurology notes, <b>our</b> <b>study</b> {{did not involve}} a standardized clinical assessment for all patients included in the study. Also, as with many prior studies with DaT scans, <b>our</b> <b>study</b> used clinical follow-up as the diagnostic reference standard, which intrinsically cannot prove greater accuracy than thorough clinical evaluation itself. In addition, the caudate and putamen counts in <b>our</b> <b>study</b> were obtained through manually drawn of regions of interest. Use of standardized segmentation maps would have reduced uncertainty in the size and shapes of these regions (Nobili et al., 2013).|$|R
30|$|Second, in <b>our</b> <b>study</b> the {{difference}} between both procedures in detecting positive lymph nodes was not significant. It might be that the sample size in <b>our</b> <b>study</b> {{was too small to}} detect small but clinically relevant differences.|$|R
6000|$|... "We've {{got to do}} it," [...] was the way Jack {{expressed}} himself. [...] "We {{want the}} folks at home {{to know that we}} are keeping at <b>our</b> <b>studies.</b> Then, if they happen to hear of some of the jokes we play, they will know that we're doing something else here besides having fun." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not at all, Martha. I'm quite {{content to}} step aside so far as {{baseball}} is concerned, and so is Fred. We want to do our best as officers and also do our best with <b>our</b> <b>studies.</b> You know the folks at home are expecting us to make real records in the classrooms." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The unfortunate {{part of it}} is," [...] {{continued}} the O'Kelly, [...] "that I'm such a healthy beggar; it don't give her a chance. If I were only a chronic invalid, now, there's nothing that woman would not do to make me happy. As it is--" [...] The O'Kelly struck a chord. We resumed <b>our</b> <b>studies.</b>|$|E
30|$|In a {{study by}} Carrino et al. [19], 4.1  % of {{subjects}} had transitional thoracolumbar segments, defined as lumbar ribs in <b>our</b> <b>study,</b> and two-thirds of those also had LSTV. These results were {{consistent with those of}} <b>our</b> <b>study.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{findings}} of <b>our</b> <b>study</b> {{should be interpreted}} keeping the inherent limitations of retrospective studies in perspective. What we found is an association and not a true causal effect. Our analysis {{was limited to the}} variables we could gather from the treatment chart notes. The population in <b>our</b> <b>study</b> was relatively homogenous considering the location of the dental school and the population it serves. Consequently, <b>our</b> <b>study</b> results cannot be generalized to all Class II Division I malocclusions.|$|R
30|$|Methods In <b>our</b> <b>study,</b> we {{aimed to}} {{identify}} the infectious agent retrospectively. Point-prevalence survey in march 2012 concerning all patients {{who had been in}} the intensive care unit for at least 48  hours. A retrospective analysis of 1780 patients who underwent ICU therapy between 2012 and March 2016 was performed. The primary outcomes of <b>our</b> <b>study,</b> we aimed {{to identify the}} infectious agent retrospectively. The secondary outcomes of <b>our</b> <b>study,</b> was to identify areas of infections in intensive care.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Gentlemen,' said Doctor Blimber, 'rise for Grace! Cornelia, lift Dombey down'--nothing of whom but {{his scalp}} was {{accordingly}} seen above the tablecloth. 'Johnson will repeat to me tomorrow morning before breakfast, without book, {{and from the}} Greek Testament, {{the first chapter of}} the Epistle of Saint Paul to the Ephesians. We will resume <b>our</b> <b>studies,</b> Mr Feeder, in half-an-hour.' ...|$|E
60|$|I had {{no doubt}} that he would do all in his power to get even with me. He hated me and always had. At school I had surpassed him in <b>our</b> <b>studies,</b> and on the ball field I had proved myself a {{superior}} player. I do not wish to brag about what I did, but it is necessary to show why Duncan disliked me.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is no {{personal}} matter between us. Amid <b>our</b> <b>studies</b> {{we have no}} leisure or inclination for personal matters. It is an immutable law, and it is as impossible for us to relax it {{as it is for}} you to escape from it Sooner or later we shall come to you and claim your life in atonement for the one which you have taken.|$|E
30|$|To {{a certain}} extent, <b>our</b> <b>study</b> {{counteract}} {{the limitations of}} these studies and extent their observations in several aspects. First, we enrolled a larger study population than most other <b>studies.</b> Second, <b>our</b> <b>study</b> comprises a longer resting period and ascertains that participants did not practice laparoscopic surgery or skill training during the 2 -year resting period. Third, <b>our</b> <b>study</b> evaluates and discriminates between tasks of different levels of difficulties. Fourth, <b>our</b> <b>study</b> ascertains that during the skills acquisition phase, training was long enough to reach the plateau of the learning curve, in contrast with other studies in which participants were just briefly exposed to a task or allowed to practice it for a short period.|$|R
30|$|We {{compared}} this study’s outcomes {{with previous}} comparison studies of ThermaChoice III and NovaSure/ThermaChoice I [9, 10]. The {{scores on the}} condition-specific MMAS were notably higher for both NovaSure and ThermaChoice III in <b>our</b> <b>study</b> [10]. This {{could be due to}} the fact that dissatisfied women in <b>our</b> <b>study</b> might already have undergone a hysterectomy and therefore did not complete the questionnaire. As a result, our mean score on the condition-specific MMAS was too high to be representative for the whole group. However Varma et al. [9] found a score of 87 on the condition-specific MMAS, which is comparable with the 86.5 points we found. The amenorrhea rates in <b>our</b> <b>study</b> (27 vs 45  % for ThermaChoice III and NovaSure, respectively) were similar to those found in previous studies (21 – 35 vs 39  %) [9, 10]. The hysterectomy rate was higher in <b>our</b> <b>study</b> for both groups [10]. This is probably due to the longer mean follow-up time in <b>our</b> <b>study.</b>|$|R
30|$|<b>Our</b> <b>study</b> showed {{significantly}} high {{mortality in}} patients with severe Dengue Infection especially those with non hematological organ dysfunction. <b>Our</b> <b>study</b> also showed strong correlation of SOFA score and Delta SOFA score, low serum albumin and high arterial lactate with prediction of mortality.|$|R
