5|$|About {{four months}} after victory, the Yankees {{controversially}} traded fan favorite David Wells to the Toronto Blue Jays for Roger Clemens, a fan favorite with the Red Sox between 1984 and 1996. Clemens was coming <b>off</b> <b>two</b> consecutive season with the Blue Jays where he had won both the pitching triple crown and the Cy Young Award in both 1997 and 1998.|$|E
5|$|At Battle of Novi, his {{division}} {{was part of}} Laurent Saint-Cyr's right wing. At the battle itself, his troops {{were the only ones}} properly positioned; the rest of the French army was otherwise out of place and unready for battle. He and Saint-Cyr held the center of the French line, beating <b>off</b> <b>two</b> Russian assaults. After the French defeat at Novi, he went with Saint-Cyr to Savona, where he participated in operations around Genoa. Eventually, he rejoined Moreau to campaign in southwestern Germany, culminating in the Battle of Hohenlinden.|$|E
5|$|From the well-fortified {{position}} in the Klis Fortress, the Turks were a constant threat to the Venetians and to the local Croatian population in the surrounding area. In 1647, after the Turkish success at Novigrad, the Turks {{were said to have}} 30,000 troops ready to attack Split. The Signoria send <b>off</b> <b>two</b> thousand soldiers with munitions and provisions to the threatened area. Although Split and Zadar were strong fortresses, they were clearly in danger.|$|E

Paynter had already fended <b>off</b> <b>two</b> challengers during the race, and Smith had switched his whip from his right hand to his left in an attempt to fend off a late challenge from Atigun; Smith considered his decision to be an error that cost him the race.|$|E
5|$|Two men are {{surveying}} {{an area of}} the Apalachicola National Forest in Leon County, Florida {{when they}} are attacked and killed by unseen assailants with glowing red eyes. Later that day, Michael Asekoff and his son, Louis, are hunting for possums with their dog, Bo, in the same stretch of woods. Upon discovering a surveyor's bloody jacket, the father orders his son to take the dog and run home. As the son and dog take <b>off,</b> <b>two</b> shots are heard.|$|E
5|$|Aegaeon– Featured in Ascension, Aegaeon the Hecatonchires had pledged a blood oath to Zeus, {{but later}} betrayed the god. The first {{victim of the}} Furies, they {{captured}} and tortured the multi-armed creature. Instead of killing him, the Furies turned him to stone, making him the giant Prison of the Damned and becoming a symbol to all who may think of breaking a blood oath to a god. As Kratos attempted to escape the prison, Megaera used her parasitic insects to bring Aegaeon to life and control him as his many arms mutated into monstrous forms and began to attack the Spartan. Fending <b>off</b> <b>two</b> of its parasite-controlled arms, Megaera then infected Aegaeon's head, which attacked Kratos, but the Spartan outsmarted and killed Megaera; this also caused Aegaeon to die, freeing him from his suffering.|$|E

5|$|After the Florida loss, Alabama's senior {{starting}} quarterback, John David Phillips, {{was replaced}} by freshman Andrew Zow. With Zow as the new starter, Alabama proceeded to win its next two games: 2017 against Ole Miss and 2322 against East Carolina. On October 24, Zow endured his first loss as the team's starting quarterback when Alabama was defeated, 3518, by eventual SEC (and national) champion Tennessee. Alabama rebounded from the loss by reeling <b>off</b> <b>two</b> more wins: 3020 against Southern Miss and an upset 2216 win over LSU, in which the Crimson Tide scored 15 points in 144 seconds.|$|E
5|$|After this, the 22nd Brigade {{moved back}} towards the {{junction}} of Holland and Ulu Padan Roads. Moving while under heavy fire, the battalion established itself in its new position before 9:00am, but in the confusion of the move, some men found themselves separated from the main body and cut off. In the afternoon, after the brigade position was reoriented to the west, the battalion was placed in reserve. The battalion's positions in the north, situated on the high ground, experienced heavy attack from Japanese aircraft and artillery, as the brigade—supported by Australian and British artillery—fought <b>off</b> <b>two</b> regiments from the Japanese 18th Division {{during the course of}} the night of 11/12 February.|$|E
5|$|Amid {{reports of}} looting, {{concerns}} were {{raised about the}} safety of the antiquities of the famous Egyptian Museum, near the epicenter of the Cairo protests. Egyptian state television announced in the evening that army commandos had secured the museum. Protesters joined soldiers in protecting the museum, situated beside the burning ruling party headquarters. Looters managed to enter during the night from the roof to damage a number of small artifacts, and it was initially reported that they had ripped the heads <b>off</b> <b>two</b> mummies, but subsequent reports claimed that Egypt's top archaeologist had mistaken skulls from other skeletons, and that the mummies were intact.|$|E

5|$|At around 4:00 PM on October 17, the {{pontoon bridge}} had been fully assembled, opening the first Israeli {{bridge across the}} canal. The roller bridge was laid soon after at dawn on October 18, and by afternoon, Adan's {{division}} crossed {{to the west bank}} followed by Kalman Magen's division. Adan, supported by Magen, would go on to reach Suez after the failure of a United Nations ceasefire, thereby cutting <b>off</b> <b>two</b> infantry divisions of the Egyptian Third Field Army. Sharon also crossed with part of his division, simultaneously trying to defend and expand the Israeli corridor to the Suez Canal—as well attacking northwards on the west bank to Ismailia in an attempt to similarly cut off the Second Army. His efforts bogged down, and he was unable to reach Ismailia (see Battle of Ismailia), while attempts to seize critical positions and expand the Israeli corridor on the east bank saw little to no success.|$|E
5|$|Bernard Rhodes, a {{sometime}} {{associate of}} McLaren {{and friend of}} the Sex Pistols, was similarly aiming to make stars of the band London SS. Early in 1976, London SS broke up before ever performing publicly, spinning <b>off</b> <b>two</b> new bands: the Damned and the Clash, which was joined by Joe Strummer, former lead singer of the 101'ers. On June 4, 1976, the Sex Pistols played Manchester's Lesser Free Trade Hall in {{what came to be}} {{regarded as one of the}} most influential rock shows ever. Among the approximately forty audience members were the two locals who organised the gig—they had formed Buzzcocks after seeing the Sex Pistols in February. Others in the small crowd went on to form Joy Division, the Fall, and—in the 1980s—the Smiths.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the race}} John Downie crashed into a pub in Ballasalla, but the car did not sustain {{extensive}} damage {{and he was able}} to continue the race. At Keppel Gate on the Mountain Road, Frederick Bennett, who had been unable to take part in the practice sessions and therefore did not know the course very well, approached a corner with too much speed in his Cadillac and crashed, ripping <b>off</b> <b>two</b> of the wheels. Bennett managed to stay in the vehicle and avoided serious injury. Another driver to go off the track was J. Hadley in his Wolseley, who also carried too much speed into a corner, leading him to drive off through a hedge and into a field. The Thornycroft driven by Tom Thornycroft had been following closely behind, and the two cars collided during the incident, damaging one of the Thornycroft's rear wheels. Napier in his Arrol-Johnston made the quickest circuit of the first lap in one hour, 32 minutes and 36 seconds.|$|E

Pogba then earned his second cap four days later in another 2014 World Cup qualifier against Spain, starting the match against the world champions, but picked up a yellow card in the 76th minute for unsporting behaviour, before being sent <b>off</b> <b>two</b> minutes later for a second bookable offence in a 1–0 loss. He scored his first international goal against Belarus on 10 September 2013 in a 4–2 victory, once again during a 2014 World Cup qualifier.|$|E
5|$|Saruman is in {{part the}} {{architect}} of his own downfall. Kocher, Randall Helms and Shippey write that Saruman's actions {{in the first half}} of The Two Towers, although intended to further his own interests, in fact lead to his defeat and that of Sauron: his orcs help split the Fellowship at Parth Galen, and in carrying <b>off</b> <b>two</b> of the hobbits initiate a series of incidents that lead to his ruin. In turn this frees the Rohirrim to intervene at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields and then together with the men of Gondor to assault Sauron's stronghold of Mordor and distract him from Frodo's final effort to destroy the Ring. Shippey says that this demonstrates the value of persistence in the face of despair, even if a way out cannot be seen; Kocher and Helms write that it is part of a pattern of providential events and of the reversed effects of evil intentions throughout the book.|$|E

5|$|As {{the tornado}} crossed South Richard Road, it {{intensified}} {{into a very}} high-end EF4 and inflicted catastrophic damage to several large homes as it impacted the Deer Creek subdivision. Well-built homes along South Richard Road and East Kuehl Court were leveled and swept from their foundations with debris strewn downwind. Several vehicles parked at these residences were moved some distance or tossed, and wind rowing of debris occurred. One house had its concrete walkway pulled {{a few inches from}} its original location, and notable scouring of lawn grass was observed in the subdivision. These structures were estimated to have been impacted by winds near 200mph (320km/h), the upper bound of an EF4 tornado. The homes swept away in this area were bolted to their foundations and there is some speculation that the tornado may have reached EF5 intensity at this point, though close inspection revealed that some of the washers were missing from the anchor bolts, and that low-lying shrubbery near the homes was left mostly intact, preventing a higher rating. Continuing northeast, the tornado temporarily weakened as it destroyed a few large barns or outbuildings, ripped the roof <b>off</b> <b>two</b> brick residences, and collapsed most walls of another house, but once again gained strength as it approached Illinois Route 64. A large restaurant and a residence had their exterior walls collapsed.|$|E
5|$|At around 09:30, {{the four}} CH-46 {{helicopters}} arrived in Ngok Tavak, {{and they were}} able to unload Makowski and about 45 soldiers of the 12th MSF Company. However, the VC demonstrated their domination of the landing zone when the first helicopter was hit with anti-aircraft fire, and was forced to land on the ground, intact, though with damages to the fuel line. Moments later, the third helicopter was struck by a rocket propelled grenade as it turned around to rescue the crews of the first downed helicopter, and it was destroyed immediately. Now, with two downed helicopters blocking the landing zone, the remaining helicopters were prevented from landing on the ground, so the wounded men had to be evacuated while the helicopters were still hovering. As the last helicopter took <b>off,</b> <b>two</b> Nungs and one stranded U.S. soldier grabbed the helicopter skids to get out of Ngok Tavak, but they all fell to their deaths. Shortly after his arrival, Makowski placed the 12th MSF Company under the command of his Australian counterpart, as the situation continued to worsen.|$|E
5|$|Facing the Chinese {{offensive}} were 418,000 UN troops, including 152,000 South Koreans, 245,000 Americans, 11,500 British Commonwealth and 10,000 {{troops from}} other UN countries. However, with the US Eighth Army {{not strong enough}} to prevent large penetrations along its line, masses of Chinese infantry soon swept around its flanks, surrounding entire formations in an attempt to cut off their withdrawal. Standing directly {{in the path of the}} main Chinese attack towards Seoul in the I Corps sector was the 29th British Brigade. The brigade's stand on the Imjin River held <b>off</b> <b>two</b> Chinese divisions for two days and ultimately helped prevent the capture of Seoul, but resulted in heavy casualties in one of the bloodiest British engagements of the war. During the fighting, most of the 1st Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment were killed or captured during a stubborn resistance at the Battle of the Imjin River that saw the commanding officer—Lieutenant Colonel James Carne—awarded the Victoria Cross after his battalion was surrounded. Ultimately the 29th Brigade suffered 1,091 casualties in their defence of the Kansas Line, and although they destroyed a large portion of the Chinese 63rd Army and inflicted nearly 10,000 casualties, the loss of the Glosters caused a controversy in Britain and within the United Nations Command. Meanwhile, further east, in the IX Corps sector, the Chinese 118th Division, 40th Army and the 60th Division, 20th Army prepared to attack the South Korean 6th Division on the night of 22 April.|$|E
