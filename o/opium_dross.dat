40|$|Background: The {{pattern of}} drug abuse in Iran has {{dramatically}} changed in recent years, turning from the traditional opioids [opium, <b>opium</b> <b>dross,</b> and refined <b>opium</b> <b>dross</b> (Shireh) ] into drugs with newer forms. The present study is aimed at investigating the frequency of pathological changes in the lungs of bodies with positive postmortem toxicology results for narcotics and psychotropic substances autopsied in the forensic dissection hall of Tehran, Iran [the Iranian Legal Medicine Organization (LMO) ]. Methods: The present study is a cross-sectional descriptive study. The sample consisted of 153 bodies, which had been referred to the LMO with positive results in postmortem toxicology for narcotics and psychotropic substances. Results: We found that narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances were used more in men than women. Moreover, {{the average age of}} death due to drug use was 36 years old. In addition, methamphetamine was the mostly-used type of substances, and smoking was the most widely used method to use the drugs. Besides, the dominant consistency and color of the lungs of half of the bodies investigated were elastic brown-gray. Moreover, the most common pathologic changes observed in the lungs of the bodies investigated were congestion and edema. Conclusion: Given the prevalence of pathological changes in the lungs of the examined bodies and congestion, edema, and pulmonary hemorrhage, {{the results of the present}} study can be particularly effective in determining the drug use and the resultant death in the absence of any previous records and/or a negative result of toxicology. ...|$|E
40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{effectiveness}} ofmethadone detoxification with traditional method of gradual decrement in theabused amount of the refined <b>opium</b> <b>dross</b> (Shireh) to control withdrawalsyndrome in Shireh-addicted patients. Methods: In this study, two groups of Shireh addicts were compared. The firstgroup was treated by methadone and the second group by gradual decrement inthe amount of consumed Shireh. Those experiencing the adverse effects of thetreatment were excluded from the study. Methadone dose was calculated based on the amount of the Shireh consumedand detoxification was performed during a 21 -day period. In the second group, theamount of the consumed Shireh was gradually decreased within 21 days andsome of the withdrawal symptoms were selected as indicators for patientevaluation. Results: A total of 35 patients (16 versus 19 patients in the first and secondgroups) were evaluated. Their mean age was 43 ± 4 years and all were male. Astatistically significant difference was found between these two groups in terms ofseverity and duration of withdrawal symptoms within the first five days and theirduration after the 21 st day of the onset of detoxification (P< 0. 05). Conclusion: In comparison with methadone detoxification, traditional method ofgradually decreasing the consumed amount of Shireh controls the severity andduration of withdrawal symptoms better in the course of detoxification...|$|E
