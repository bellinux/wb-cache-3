5|$|The early-to-mid 1800s were {{a period}} of intense debate on the particle-versus-wave nature <b>of</b> <b>light.</b> Although the {{observation}} of the Arago spot in 1819 may seem to have settled the matter definitively in favor of Fresnel's wave theory <b>of</b> <b>light,</b> various concerns continued {{to appear to be}} addressed more satisfactorily by Newton's corpuscular theory. Arago had suggested in 1838 that a differential comparison of the speed <b>of</b> <b>light</b> in air versus water would serve to prove or disprove the wave nature <b>of</b> <b>light.</b> In 1850, racing against Foucault to establish this point, Fizeau engaged L.F.C. Breguet to build a rotary-mirror apparatus in which he split a beam <b>of</b> <b>light</b> into two beams, passing one through water while the other traveled through air. Beaten by Foucault by a mere seven weeks, he confirmed that the speed <b>of</b> <b>light</b> was greater as it traveled through air, validating the wave theory <b>of</b> <b>light.</b>|$|E

5|$|According to Einstein's {{theory of}} special relativity, as an electron's speed {{approaches}} the speed <b>of</b> <b>light,</b> from an observer's {{point of view}} its relativistic mass increases, thereby making it {{more and more difficult}} to accelerate it from within the observer's frame of reference. The speed of an electron can approach, but never reach, the speed <b>of</b> <b>light</b> in a vacuum, c. However, when relativistic electrons—that is, electrons moving at a speed close to c—are injected into a dielectric medium such as water, where the local speed <b>of</b> <b>light</b> is significantly less than c, the electrons temporarily travel faster than light in the medium. As they interact with the medium, they generate a faint light called Cherenkov radiation.|$|E

5|$|Green {{is common}} in nature, as many plants are green because of a complex {{chemical}} known as chlorophyll, which is involved in photosynthesis. Chlorophyll absorbs the long wavelengths <b>of</b> <b>light</b> (red) and short wavelengths <b>of</b> <b>light</b> (blue) much more efficiently than the wavelengths that appear green to the human eye, so light reflected by plants is enriched in green. Chlorophyll absorbs green light poorly because it first arose in organisms living in oceans where purple halobacteria were already exploiting photosynthesis. Their purple color arose because they extracted energy in the green portion of the spectrum using bacteriorhodopsin. The new organisms that then later came to dominate the extraction <b>of</b> <b>light</b> were selected to exploit those portions of the spectrum not used by the halobacteria.|$|E

5|$|In 1834, Charles Wheatstone {{developed}} {{a method of}} using a rapidly rotating mirror to study transient phenomena, and applied this method to measure the velocity of electricity in a wire and the duration of an electric spark. He communicated to François Arago the idea that his method could be adapted to {{a study of the}} speed <b>of</b> <b>light.</b> Arago expanded upon Wheatstone's concept in an 1838 publication, emphasizing the possibility that a test of the relative speed <b>of</b> <b>light</b> in air versus water could be used to distinguish between the particle and wave theories <b>of</b> <b>light.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1845, Arago {{suggested}} to Fizeau and Foucault that {{they attempt to}} measure the speed <b>of</b> <b>light.</b> Sometime in 1849, however, {{it appears that the}} two had a falling out, and they parted ways pursuing separate means of performing this experiment. In 1848−49, Fizeau used, not a rotating mirror, but a toothed wheel apparatus to perform an absolute measurement of the speed <b>of</b> <b>light</b> in air. In 1850, Fizeau and Foucault both used rotating mirror devices to perform relative measures of the speed <b>of</b> <b>light</b> in air versus water. Foucault used a scaled-up version of the rotating mirror apparatus to perform an absolute measurement of the speed <b>of</b> <b>light</b> in 1862. Subsequent experiments performed by Marie Alfred Cornu in 1872–76 and by Albert A. Michelson in 1877–1931 used improved versions of the toothed wheel and rotating mirror experiments to make steadily more accurate estimates of the speed <b>of</b> <b>light.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1889 {{there was}} no {{generally}} accepted theory regarding the nature <b>of</b> <b>light</b> but by 1960 the wavelength of specific light spectra could give a more accurate and reproducible value than a prototype metre. In that year the prototype metre {{was replaced by a}} formal definition that defines the metre in terms of the wavelength of specified light spectra. By 1983 it was accepted that the speed <b>of</b> <b>light</b> in vacuum was constant and that this constant provided a more reproducible procedure for measuring length. Therefore, the metre was redefined in terms of the speed <b>of</b> <b>light.</b> These definitions give a much better reproducibility and also allow anyone, anywhere with a suitably equipped laboratory, to make a standard metre.|$|E

5|$|In addition, Euler made {{important}} contributions in optics. He disagreed with Newton's corpuscular theory <b>of</b> <b>light</b> in the Opticks, {{which was then}} the prevailing theory. His 1740s papers on optics helped ensure that the wave theory <b>of</b> <b>light</b> proposed by Christiaan Huygens would become the dominant mode of thought, {{at least until the}} development of the quantum theory <b>of</b> <b>light.</b>|$|E
5|$|In most {{theories}} up to {{the eighteenth}} century, light was pictured as being made up of particles. Since particle models cannot easily account for the refraction, diffraction and birefringence <b>of</b> <b>light,</b> wave theories <b>of</b> <b>light</b> were proposed by René Descartes (1637), Robert Hooke (1665), and Christiaan Huygens (1678); however, particle models remained dominant, chiefly due {{to the influence of}} Isaac Newton. In the early nineteenth century, Thomas Young and August Fresnel clearly demonstrated the interference and diffraction <b>of</b> <b>light</b> and by 1850 wave models were generally accepted. In 1865, James Clerk Maxwell's prediction that light was an electromagnetic wave—which was confirmed experimentally in 1888 by Heinrich Hertz's detection of radio waves—seemed to be the final blow to particle models <b>of</b> <b>light.</b>|$|E
