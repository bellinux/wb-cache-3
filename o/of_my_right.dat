[...] She has said that riding [...] "saved my life", explaining that, [...] "I was losing most of the function <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>right</b> side. And I decided I needed to go back and do what I loved before I couldn't do it anymore." [...] At first she could barely stay on a horse without getting tired, but gradually the muscle control required for riding proved directly beneficial, and psychologically, [...] "Riding exhilarated me; it gave me a joy and a purpose. When I was so fatigued that I couldn't move, the excitement of going to the barn and getting my foot in the stirrup would make me crawl out of bed." [...] As a result, she said, [...] "My desire to ride was, and is, so strong that I kept getting healthier and healthier." ...|$|E
500|$|Edward {{continued}} {{to pay for}} the gardeners, insurance and upkeep of the fort in the initial years following his abdication, because it was his wish that he would return there. His possessions from the fort were transferred to the Château de la Croë in the south of France (where he had named the sitting room [...] "The Belvedere") in the spring of 1938, but many were damaged in transit. Edward was informed in March 1940 that the fort was no longer in his possession as his warrant to occupy the grace and favour residence had expired on the termination of his reign and was not to be renewed by the present sovereign, his brother, now George VI. Edward was greatly upset by this, writing in 1940 that [...] "It is crystal clear that this proposed reserving of the Fort by the use of Crown Lands {{is nothing more than a}} piece of bluff, and the first excuse that the king has been able to find to deprive me <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>right</b> to occupy the place should I ever desire to do so..." [...] Edward believed that the incident was an example of his 'brother's failure to keep his word to me' after the fort had apparently been reserved for him if he should reside once more in England.|$|E

As I looked at it, it exploded with a sharp report quite impossible to confuse with the continuous turmoil of the lightning, thunder and hail, or that of the lashed water and smashed wood which was creating a pandemonium outside the cottage.

2500|$|An {{account in}} Genesis {{explains}} {{the name of}} Benjamin {{as a result of}} the birth of the tribe's founder, Benjamin. According to Genesis, Benjamin was the result of a painful birth in which is mother died, naming him Ben-Oni, [...] "son of my pain," [...] immediately before her death. Instead, Jacob, his father, preferred to call him Benjamin, which can be read in Hebrew as meaning, [...] "son <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>right</b> [...] " [...] (Genesis 35:16-18). In geographical terms, the term Benjamin can be read as [...] "son of the south" [...] from the perspective of the northern Kingdom of Israel, as the Benjamite territory was at the southern edge of the northern kingdom.|$|E
2500|$|Philo saw in [...] {{accusations against}} [...] "the self-loving man." [...] Philo cited Cain {{as an example}} of one who (in [...] ) showed his {{gratitude}} to God too slowly. Philo taught that we should hurry to please God without delay. Thus [...] enjoins, [...] "If you vow a vow, you shall not delay to perform it." [...] Philo explained that a vow is a request to God for good things, and [...] thus enjoins that when one has received them, one must offer gratitude to God as soon as possible. Philo divided those who fail to do so into three types: (1) those who forget the benefits that they have received, (2) those who from an excessive conceit look upon themselves and not God as the authors of what they receive, and (3) those who realize that God caused what they received, but still say that they deserved it, because they are worthy to receive God's favor. Philo taught that Scripture opposes all three. Philo wrote that [...] replies to the first group who forget, [...] "Take care, lest when you have eaten and are filled, and when you have built fine houses and inhabited them, and when your flocks and your herds have increased, and when your silver and gold, and all that you possess is multiplied, you be lifted up in your heart, and forget the Lord your God." [...] Philo taught that one does not forget God when one remembers one's own nothingness and God's exceeding greatness. Philo interpreted [...] to reprove those who look upon themselves as the cause of what they have received, telling them: [...] "Say not my own might, or the strength <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>right</b> hand has acquired me all this power, but remember always the Lord your God, who gives you the might to acquire power." [...] And Philo read [...] to address those who think that they deserve what they have received, saying, [...] "You do not enter into this land to possess it because of your righteousness, or because of the holiness of your heart; but, in the first place, because of the iniquity of these nations, since God has brought on them the destruction of wickedness; and in the second place, that He may establish the covenant that He swore to our Fathers." [...] Philo interpreted the term [...] "covenant" [...] figuratively to mean God's graces. Thus Philo concluded that if we discard forgetfulness, ingratitude, and self-love, we will no longer through delay miss attaining the genuine worship of God, but we shall meet God, having prepared ourselves to do what God commands us.|$|E
