The rugged natural scenery, sense <b>of</b> <b>isolation,</b> and natural attractions such as Cathedral Caves makes the Catlins a popular {{destination}} for weekend trips by people from Dunedin and Invercargill, the two nearest cities. A large number of cribs (holiday cottages) occur at places such as Jack's Bay and Pounawea. Ecotourism is becoming increasingly important to the area's economy, with many of the visitors coming from overseas. Tourism added an estimated $2.4 million to the region's economy in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Imprisoned debtors {{were allowed}} some social contact, but the regime for criminals was {{designed}} to be one <b>of</b> <b>isolation,</b> according to the separate system. Consequently, the seating in the prison chapel is designed to enclose each prisoner individually so that the preacher could see everyone but each could see only him. By 1878 the system was discredited and the inmates were transferred to the new gaol in the eastern outskirts of Lincoln. The prison in the castle was left without a use until the Lincolnshire Archives were housed in its cells.|$|E

5|$|Survival horror {{refers to}} a subgenre of horror video games. The player {{character}} is vulnerable and under-armed, which puts emphasis on puzzle-solving and evasion, rather than violence. Games commonly challenge the player to manage their inventory and ration scarce resources such as ammunition.

40|$|A study {{conducted}} on 300 fecal samples from a cow and a pig, each artificially contaminated with approximately four Salmonella organisms revealed that, {{of the three}} enrichment broths {{used in conjunction with}} the three selective media, the maximum number <b>of</b> <b>isolations</b> were obtained with Brilliant Green MacConkey broth (BGMB), followed by those obtained with tetrathionate (TTB), and the least with selenite broth. The combination of BGMB with Brilliant Green-neutral red-lactose agar (BGNRLA), and TTB with desoxycholate citrate agar (DCA) gave an equal number <b>of</b> <b>isolations.</b> <b>Of</b> the three selective media used in conjunction with the three enrichment broths, the maximum number of recoveries were obtained on BGNRLA, followed by those on DCA, and least number <b>of</b> <b>isolations</b> on bismuth sulfite agar (BSA). The combination of selenite F broth-BSA appeared to be somewhat inhibitory for the growth of Salmonella organisms. Of the two selective media combinations, the DCA-BGNRLA combination yielded the highest number <b>of</b> <b>isolations.</b> The use <b>of</b> all three selective media gave still better results. Selenite and tetrathionate broths were found unsuitable for isolating Salmonella choleraesuis from feces. BGMB, containing 100 μg of Brilliant Green per ml, proved to be a useful enrichment medium for the <b>isolation</b> <b>of</b> this organism from cow and pig fecal samples, each inoculated with 16 organisms. Observations recorded seemed to suggest that contaminant bacteria perhaps outgrow and mask S. choleraesuis. An incubation period of 24 to 30 hr was found optimum for the three enrichment broths. A longer period was detrimental in the case of TTB but not with selenite broth and BGMB...|$|R

5|$|Aronofsky's {{first two}} films, Pi and Requiem for a Dream, were low-budget and used montages of {{extremely}} short shots, {{also known as}} hip hop montages. While an average 100-minute film has 600 to 700 cuts Requiem for a Dream features more than 2,000. Split-screen is used extensively, along with extremely tight closeups. Long tracking shots, including those shot with an apparatus strapping a camera to an actor, called the Snorricam, and time-lapse photography are also prominent stylistic devices. Often with his films, Aronofsky alternates between extreme closeups and extreme wide shots {{to create a sense}} <b>of</b> <b>isolation.</b>|$|E

5|$|Despite {{being set}} in space, the film uses motifs from {{shipwreck}} and wilderness survival stories about psychological change and resilience {{in the aftermath}} of a catastrophe. Cuarón uses the character, Stone, to illustrate clarity of mind, persistence, training, and improvisation in the face <b>of</b> <b>isolation</b> and the consequences of a relentless Murphy's law. The film incorporates spiritual or existential themes, in the facts of Stone's daughter's accidental and meaningless death, and in the necessity of summoning the will to survive in the face of overwhelming odds, without future certainties, and with the impossibility of rescue from personal dissolution without finding this willpower. Calamities occur but only the surviving astronauts see them.|$|E
5|$|Suzuki's working {{title for}} this second {{autobiography}} was The Outsider, a title intended {{to express the}} author's view of his own role in society. The origin of this outsider feeling comes from isolation suffered at a Japanese Canadian internment camp during World War II. He was imprisoned there for being Japanese but shunned by other Japanese for being a third generation Canadian, speaking only English. His feeling <b>of</b> <b>isolation</b> continued during his early school years when the only other student of Japanese heritage was his twin sister. Suzuki's daughters acknowledged this perception of himself as an outsider but insist that the public views him very differently, {{as one of their}} own, leading to the simple The Autobiography title.|$|E

40|$|Excessive {{deformation}} <b>of</b> the <b>isolation</b> {{layer in}} midstory isolated structures may occur under strong near-field pulse-like ground motion, which {{would result in}} the overturning collapse of the superstructure. The objective of the present research is to limit excessive deformation <b>of</b> the <b>isolation</b> layer and to reduce nonlinear response of midstory isolated structures. To this end, a protective system is presented to limit deformation <b>of</b> the <b>isolation</b> layer by soft pounding. Based on the Kelvin pounding model, a mechanical model is put forward for this protective system. In addition, a new method has been proposed that synthesizes artificial near-field pulse-like ground motion by combining the real near-field nonpulse ground motion with simple equivalent pulses. Also, the impact of artificial near-field pulse-like ground motion on the nonlinear response of midstory isolated structures and the deformation <b>of</b> the <b>isolation</b> layer has been investigated. The effectiveness <b>of</b> the midstory <b>isolation</b> with the protective system has been validated. The results show that the maximum deformation <b>of</b> the <b>isolation</b> layer significantly exceeds the allowable deformation of lead-rubber bearings when subjected to near-field pulse-like ground motion, and it causes the lead-rubber bearings destruction. The proposed protective system is effective in restricting the excessive deformation <b>of</b> the <b>isolation</b> layer and reducing nonlinear responses of the isolated structure, preventing collapse of the superstructure...|$|R

5|$|Usually, {{the mother}} does not {{integrate}} {{herself and her}} cubs back into the pride until the cubs are {{six to eight weeks}} old. Sometimes this introduction to pride life occurs earlier, however, particularly if other lionesses have given birth at about the same time. For instance, lionesses in a pride often synchronise their reproductive cycles and there is communal raising and suckling of the young (once the cubs are past the initial stage <b>of</b> <b>isolation</b> with their mother), who suckle indiscriminately from any or all of the nursing females in the pride. The synchronization of births also has an advantage in that the cubs end up being roughly the same size, and thus have an equal chance of survival, and older cubs do not dominate the sucklings.|$|E

5|$|From the 12th century until 1868, Japan {{was ruled}} by {{successive}} feudal military shoguns who ruled {{in the name}} of the Emperor. Japan entered into a long period <b>of</b> <b>isolation</b> in the early 17th century, which was ended in 1853 when a United States fleet pressured Japan to open to the West. After nearly two decades of internal conflict and insurrection, the Imperial Court regained its political power in 1868 through the help of several clans from Chōshū and Satsuma—and the Empire of Japan was established. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, victories in the First Sino-Japanese War, the Russo-Japanese War and World War I allowed Japan to expand its empire during a period of increasing militarism. The Second Sino-Japanese War of 1937 expanded into part of World War II in 1941, which came to an end in 1945 following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the Japanese surrender. Since adopting its revised constitution on May 3, 1947, during the occupation by the SCAP, Japan has maintained a unitary parliamentary constitutional monarchy with an Emperor and an elected legislature called the National Diet.|$|E

40|$|The present {{cross-sectional}} {{study examined the}} influence <b>of</b> social <b>isolation</b> on cognitive performance among older adults aged 65 - 84 years old. This study extended previous work on social isolation and cognition in two ways. While previous research has found a link between social isolation and cognition, few have {{examined the relationship between}} different forms <b>of</b> social <b>isolation</b> and different domains of cognition simultaneously. Secondly, a link between social loneliness and cognition has not been examined. Therefore, the current study examined the impact of four different types <b>of</b> social <b>isolation</b> (social loneliness, emotional loneliness, perceived social support and objective social isolation) on global cognition and cognitive domains (memory, fluency, language and visuospatial ability). The cross-sectional data from the New Zealand Longitudinal Study of Ageing (NZLSA) (2010) was used for analysis. The NZLSA study included questions about demographic information, mental and physical well-being, loneliness, social support, social networks and cognition. Using multiple regression analyses the influence <b>of</b> social <b>isolation</b> on cognitive functions was investigated. Results showed that various forms <b>of</b> social <b>isolation</b> may be differentially important for cognitive performance in the older adult, with social loneliness the only measure <b>of</b> social <b>isolation</b> that influences cognition. The results also suggested that if a form <b>of</b> social <b>isolation</b> affects cognition, the different cognitive domains such as global cognition, fluency, language and visuospatial ability respond in a similar pattern. Explanations of why social loneliness influences cognition is discussed. Limitations of the study and implications for future research, such as the need for a longitudinal study that simultaneously assesses the links between the various forms <b>of</b> social <b>isolation</b> and cognition, is also discussed...|$|R
