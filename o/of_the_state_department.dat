5|$|Ongoing {{negotiations}} through March yielded {{an agreement}} on March 7, 1999, over the objections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>Department.</b> The proceeds of the series were a major sticking point in negotiations, as it violated the United States embargo against Cuba.

5|$|The {{building}} is again {{the location of}} the Berlin Senate Department of Internal Affairs, which moved in during 1997. The registry office for the Borough of Mitte was also located in the building for a while, but has exchanged quarters with the Department of Historic Monuments.

5|$|The {{visit was}} largely {{ceremonial}} and mainly focused on mutual praise rather than specific policy planning and negotiations. Diệm {{stayed in the}} capital for four days, meeting with Eisenhower and high-ranking members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>Department</b> on the last of these days. However, the meeting with Dulles turned into a farce after the Secretary of State and his subordinates decided to visit Diệm at Blair House. Diệm, notorious for monologues that often lasted {{for up to six}} hours, talked endlessly and as a result the American diplomats were unable to raise whatever issues they had wanted to discuss.|$|E
5|$|The Welles Declaration {{was written}} by Loy W. Henderson in {{consultation}} with Welles and Roosevelt.

5|$|War fever ran high, and by April, McKinley {{reported}} to Congress that efforts at diplomatic resolution had failed; a week later, Congress declared war. By this time, McKinley {{had begun to}} rely on Assistant Secretary of State William R. Day for day-to-day management <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>Department,</b> and was even inviting him to cabinet meetings, as Sherman had stopped attending them. Day, a McKinley associate of long standing, superseded his boss as the real power in the State Department. Sherman, sensing {{that he was being}} made a mere figurehead and recognizing, at last, his declining health and worsening memory, resigned his office on April 25, 1898.|$|E
5|$|During this period, Hardy {{pushed the}} notion of {{granting}} the school college status. In 1921, the California legislature made the school a four-year teacher's school, which placed it under the management <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>Department</b> of Education. On July 28, 1921, the San Diego Normal School became San Diego State Teachers College (usually shortened to San Diego State College or SDS). With this ranking, the college could now grant certificates and degrees. Prior to the school's conversion, it had graduated 1,500 teachers, educated many of the San Diego children at its training school, and helped to expand the economic and cultural development of the city. Also in 1921, the legislature moved San Diego Junior College, that {{was a part of}} San Diego High School, to the college campus due to crowding issues. Administrators moved the junior college believing it would only overlap the same material taught at the teacher's school. The junior college remained with the school until 1947, when it became independent.|$|E
5|$|The {{termination}} of the operation caught the CIA by surprise, and King quickly attempted to salvage what he could. The freighter was redirected to Panama, where the arms were unloaded; King kept the weapons there {{in the hope that}} the project could be rejuvenated. Castillo Armas was paid a retainer of $3000 a week, which allowed him to maintain a small force. The CIA remained in contact with him, and continued to provide support to the rebels. The CIA found it difficult to end the operation without drawing attention to it. Peréz Jimenez opened a line of credit that would allow Castillo Armas to purchase airplanes, and Trujillo and Somoza continued to support the operation, although they acknowledged that it would have to be postponed. The money paid to Castillo Armas has been described as a way of making sure that he did not attempt any premature action. Even after the operation had been terminated, the CIA received reports from Seekford that the Guatemalan rebels were planning assassinations. Castillo Armas made plans to use groups of soldiers in civilian clothing from Nicaragua, Honduras, and El Salvador to kill communist leaders in Guatemala. King continued to explore the CIA's ability to move arms around Central America without the approval <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>Department.</b>|$|E
