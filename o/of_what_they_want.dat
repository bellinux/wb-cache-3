A shot should be stopped with two hands either if it is weak or close to the goalkeeper's body, and normally stopped with one in other circumstances. This is because one-handed saves {{can go to the}} ball faster.|$|E
2500|$|The game's name, Hearthstone, {{was meant}} to imply to a close {{gathering}} of friends by a hearth, a goal <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> players to feel. According to Chayes, they had experimented with other constructs of where these card games would take place, and only about halfway through development came onto {{the idea of using}} a pub's hearth as the theme; Chayes stated that with that concept, [...] "this {{is a great way to}} play, it works with all our values, it has a lot of charm". To maintain a friendly environment around this construct, they added in the ability to trigger one of a few friendly compliments that can be said by a hero, so that players could still emote to their opponent without having to worry about any vitriol.|$|E

6000|$|I {{have shown}} that a dwelling, rented or owned by a man, in which his own wife keeps house, is not always, or of course, a home. What is it, then, that makes a home? All {{men and women have}} the {{indefinite}} knowledge <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> and long for when that word is spoken. [...] "Home!" [...] sighs the disconsolate bachelor, tired of boarding-house fare and buttonless shirts. [...] "Home!" [...] says the wanderer in foreign lands, and thinks of mother's love, of wife and sister and child. Nay, the word has in it a higher meaning hallowed by religion; and when the Christian would express the highest of his hopes for a better life, he speaks of his home beyond the grave. The word [...] "home" [...] has in it the elements of love, rest, permanency, and liberty; but, besides these, it has in it the idea of an education by which all that is purest within us is developed into nobler forms, fit for a higher life. The little child by the home-fireside was taken on the Master's knee when he would explain to his disciples the mysteries of the kingdom.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the opening}} {{days of the}} 2002 General Assembly, House Democrats angered Senate Republicans by {{submitting}} maps of proposed districts for the House and Senate. Previously, each chamber had only submitted maps for its own districts. During the ensuing negotiations, Williams promised that Senate Republicans would vote for any redistricting plan the House devised for its districts if House Democrats would agree {{to do the same}} for the Senate, but House Speaker Jody Richards refused. After weeks of negotiations, the Assembly approved a plan that gave House Democrats most <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> with regard to House districts and Senate Republicans most <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> with regard to Senate districts. After Senate Democrats complained about the bill, House Majority Leader Greg Stumbo chided them for [...] "not accepting the fact that 20-18 means Republicans control the Senate" [...] and encouraged them to campaign hard to win back the chamber in future elections.|$|R

2500|$|In the 1950s, Davidson {{worked with}} Patrick Suppes on {{developing}} an experimental approach to Decision Theory. [...] They {{concluded that it}} was not possible to isolate a subject's beliefs and preferences independently of one another so there would always be multiple ways to analyze a person's actions in terms <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> or were trying to do or valued. That result was comparable to Quine's thesis on the indeterminacy of translation and figured significantly in much of Davidson's later work on philosophy of mind.|$|R

40|$|This study explores children’s {{narratives}} of their curiosity and imagination through innovative {{use of an}} information technology app – Our Story. Novel use of the app allowed children to express and record their opinions they considered significant to them. The research captured children’s approaches to everyday situations through their play. Introducing the notion of ‘narrative affordances’, findings show how the app facilitated a range of possibilities for recording children’s curiosity and imagination through pictures, text, sound and short video. Children added to and developed their narratives, putting them firmly in control <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> to include and share, providing a unique insight into children’s perspectives...|$|R

50|$|NOBCChE was co-founded in 1972 by a {{group of}} chemists and {{chemical}} engineers. Initially, the organization was financially aided by the Haas Community Fund and Drexel University. After receiving positive feedback and interest from other black chemists and chemical engineers, the founders decided to expand on their idea and set up a structured idea <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> the society to emphasize. Two years later, the first national meeting was held in New Orleans, LA. At the conference, black chemists and chemical engineers found that they could discuss career-related issues with others who were in similar fields. Today, the national conference features various workshops, research presentations, and high school science bowls.|$|R
