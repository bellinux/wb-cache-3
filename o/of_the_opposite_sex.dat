5|$|Elaborate body {{structures}} of many modern-day animals usually serve to attract members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>sex</b> during mating.

5|$|Females {{predominantly}} scent mark {{with their}} anogenital scent glands, by squatting to rub their anogenital region along horizontal surfaces, such as tree limbs. Males, {{on the other}} hand, favor using the glands on their neck, muzzle, and chest, by embracing horizontal and vertical surfaces and rubbing themselves over them.

5|$|Apart {{from the}} lion, the cheetah {{is the only}} cat that is gregarious; however, female cheetahs tend to remain solitary. Tim Caro, of the University of California, Davis, {{identified}} the various social classes and their longevity. Pregnant and nursing females, a few adolescents, and males who have not joined any groups are typically solitary. Non-lactating females, their cubs, adolescent siblings, and several males will form their own groups. A loose association between individuals <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>sex</b> can be observed during the breeding season. These social groups typically keep away from one another.|$|E
5|$|Commonly, prey-stealing occurs where larger females take {{food items}} stored in other spiders' webs. When they {{encounter}} other spiders {{of the same}} species, often including those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>sex,</b> they engage in battle, and the defeated spider is eaten. If a male redback is accepted by a female, it is permitted to feed on the victims snared in the female's web. Baby spiders also steal food from their mother, which she tries to prevent. They also consume sticky silk as well as small midges and flies. Spiderlings are cannibalistic, more active ones sometimes eating their less active siblings.|$|E

5|$|In 1952, the American Psychiatric Association listed {{homosexuality}} in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) as {{a mental}} disorder. A large-scale study of homosexuality in 1962 {{was used to}} justify inclusion of the disorder as a supposed pathological hidden fear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>sex</b> caused by traumatic parent–child relationships. This view was widely influential in the medical profession. In 1956, however, the psychologist Evelyn Hooker performed a study that compared the happiness and well-adjusted nature of self-identified homosexual men with heterosexual men and found no difference. Her study stunned the medical community and made her a hero to many gay men and lesbians, but homosexuality remained in the DSM until 1973.|$|E
5|$|In captive Egyptian fruit bats, 70% of the {{directed}} calls {{could be}} identified as to which bat made it, and 60% could be categorised into four contexts: squabbling over food, jostling over position in their sleeping cluster, protesting over mating attempts and arguing when perched {{in close proximity to}} each other. The animals made slightly different sounds when communicating with different individuals, especially one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>sex.</b> Male hammerheaded bats produce deep, resonating, monotonous calls to attract females. Bats in flight make vocal signal for traffic control. Individual greater bulldog bats honk when {{on a collision course with}} each other.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} other insects, P.exclamans use sexual pheromones to attract members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>sex.</b> Researchers have {{attempted}} to determine the exact role that sexual pheromones play in sexual attraction in paper wasps. They set up a wind tunnel where males and females were exposed to a sexual pheromone wick that was isolated from males and females. These pheromones were taken by hexane extracts from wholes bodies and thoraces of unmated females. The male extracts {{were taken from the}} ectal mandibular and seventh sternal glands. It was found that the opposite sex was attracted upwind of the scent and the results were intensified when a fan was turned on. The range of the scent was found to be around 2 metres.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} {{to the use of}} sound for communication, a wide range of insects have evolved chemical means for communication. These chemicals, termed semiochemicals, are often derived from plant metabolites include those meant to attract, repel and provide other kinds of information. Pheromones, a type of semiochemical, are used for attracting mates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>sex,</b> for aggregating conspecific individuals of both sexes, for deterring other individuals from approaching, to mark a trail, and to trigger aggression in nearby individuals. Allomonea benefit their producer by the effect they have upon the receiver. Kairomones benefit their receiver instead of their producer. Synomones benefit the producer and the receiver. While some chemicals are targeted at individuals of the same species, others are used for communication across species. The use of scents is especially well known to have developed in social insects.|$|E
5|$|Styracosaurus is {{a member}} of the Centrosaurinae. Other members of the clade include Centrosaurus (from which the group takes its name), Pachyrhinosaurus, Avaceratops, Einiosaurus, Albertaceratops, Achelousaurus, Brachyceratops, and Monoclonius, {{although}} these last two are dubious. Because of the variation between species and even individual specimens of centrosaurines, there has been much debate over which genera and species are valid, particularly whether Centrosaurus and/or Monoclonius are valid genera, undiagnosable, or possibly members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>sex.</b> In 1996, Peter Dodson found enough variation between Centrosaurus, Styracosaurus, and Monoclonius to warrant separate genera, and that Styracosaurus resembled Centrosaurus more closely than either resembled Monoclonius. Dodson also believed one species of Monoclonius, M. nasicornis, may actually have been a female Styracosaurus. However, most other researchers have not accepted Monoclonius nasicornis as a female Styracosaurus, instead regarding it as a synonym of Centrosaurus apertus. While sexual dimorphism has been proposed for an earlier ceratopsian, Protoceratops, there is no firm evidence for sexual dimorphism in any ceratopsid.|$|E
5|$|The Homosexual Matrix {{is a book}} by American {{psychologist}} Clarence Arthur Tripp, {{in which}} the author discusses the biological and sociological implications of homosexuality, and also attempts to explain heterosexuality and bisexuality. The book {{was first published in}} 1975 by McGraw-Hill Book Company, and later republished in a revised edition in 1987. Based on his review of the evidence, Tripp argues that people do not become homosexual due to factors such as hormone levels, fear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>sex,</b> or the influence of dominant and close-binding mothers, that the amount of attention fathers give to their sons has no effect on the development of homosexuality, that psychoanalytic theories of the development of homosexuality are untenable and based on false assumptions, and that sexual orientation is not innate and depends on learning. Tripp considers early puberty and early masturbation important factors in the development of male homosexuality, and maintains that a majority of people are heterosexual because their socialization has made them want to be heterosexual. He also argues in favor of social tolerance of homosexuality and non-conformist behavior in general.|$|E

25|$|F64.2 Gender {{identity}} {{disorder of}} childhood: A disorder, usually first manifest during early childhood (and always well before puberty), {{characterized by a}} persistent and intense distress about assigned sex, together {{with a desire to}} be (or insistence that one is) of the other sex. There is a persistent preoccupation with the dress and activities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>sex</b> and repudiation of the individual's own sex. The diagnosis requires a profound disturbance of the normal gender identity; mere tomboyishness in girls or girlish behavior in boys is not sufficient. Gender identity disorders in individuals who have reached or are entering puberty should not be classified here but in F66.0.In the DSM of mental disorders used by psychologists in the United States, gender identity disorder is given two sets of criteria. Criterion A indicates that a child identifies as a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>sex.</b> The child needs to demonstrate four of the five following symptoms: dressing as a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>sex,</b> primarily befriending members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>sex,</b> demonstrating a desire to engage in play activities characteristic <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>sex,</b> and actively stating that they wish to be the opposite sex. Criterion B, on the other hand, indicates that the child does not identify with the sex they were born. This could manifest itself as a dislike of styles of dress characteristic of the sex they were born, avoidance of association with members of their born sex, and distress towards the aspects of their physiology which indicate their born gender (Bradley, Zucker, 1997).|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Rakerd and Verbrugge’s (1) {{study of}} silent-centcr {{syllable}} perception was recreated using Johnson’s (2) computationally-based xemplar model of speech perception, XMOD. <b>The</b> performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> exemplar model in perceiving silent-center syllables compared favorably to Rakerd and Verbrugge’s subjects, {{as well as}} to human listeners, who participated in a replication <b>of</b> <b>the</b> previous perceptual study. Such results imply that a process of speaker normalization is not necessary for humans to perceive silent-center syllables. Rakerd and Verbrugge’s (1) study of “silent-center syllable ” perception (henceforth R&V) used unusual cross-gender hybrid syllables in order {{to determine whether or not}} human speech perception involves some form of speaker normalization. In their study, “silent-center syllables ” were b-vowel-b syllables in which the middle 60 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vowel had been replaced with silence.

R&V reasoned that human listeners use the inherent dynamic properties of vowels to recover acoustic/auditory information for <b>the</b> missing part <b>of</b> a silent-center syllable.
