40|$|Leptosphaeria maculans (anamorph: Phoma lingam) is a hemibiotrophic loculoascomycetous fungus {{which causes}} blackleg, a serious disease of Brassica oilseed crops. In {{order to examine}} the {{genetics}} of resistance to this disease and important signalling pathways, extensive studies on L. maculans interactions with Arabidopsis were carried out. Two resistance loci, RLM 1 Col and RLM 2 Ler, have been identified due to transgressive segregation in F 2 progenies from the resistant accessions Col- 0 and Ler- 0. RLM 1 Col encodes a TIR-NB-LRR resistance gene and confers specific resistance towards L. maculans, while a third R-gene RLM 3 confers resistance to L. maculans, Alternaria brassicae, A. brassicicola and Botrytis cinerea. RLM 1 is furthermore independent from signalling components, such as SGT 1, previously associated to all TIR-NB-LRR resistance genes. In addition to these susceptible genotypes, EMS mutants (lms 1 to lms 11) susceptible to the pathogen have been assessed {{in order to facilitate}} identification of the mechanisms required for resistance. The lms 5 mutant {{has been shown to be}} specifically susceptible to L. maculans and have altered auxin signalling. During a mapping approach lms 5 was found to most likely code for an F-box protein indicating involvement in protein turnover via the ubiquitine proteasome. This result together with mutants involved in protein degradation complexes indicates the importance of protein stability. In contrast to the other pathogens, the defence responses against L. maculans are independent of the phytohormones salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA) and ethylene (ET), while abscisic acid (ABA) and auxin, and the phytoalexin camalexin play more crucial roles. Resistance to L. maculans can furthermore be primed by ABA and β-aminobutyric acid (BABA) treatments. This priming results in increased callose deposition in a resistance gene-dependent manner. The callose deposition is furthermore regulated by PR 2. Moreover comparative studies with B. napus have been undertaken, confirming that the Arabidopsis-L. maculans pathosystem can be used as a model for the B. napus - L. maculans interaction. Taken together, this work <b>ontributes</b> <b>to</b> increase our knowledge about the Arabidopsis – L. maculans pathosystem...|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} NGOs as strategic organizations that form coalitions {{in order to}} influence other actors, particularly international financial institutions. It has three primary aims: to examine NGOs as strategic organizations; {{to look at a}} particular type of NGO network,the coalition, which unlike a network involves more alue and commitment; and to assess the factors that <b>ontribute</b> <b>to</b> their strategies such as changes to the NGO environment. To do this, the resource dependency perspective is utilized to evaluate the influence of various resources (funding, legitimacy and information) on NGOs’ organizational strategy. Oxfam International, the NGO Working Group on the World Bank, and the Bretton Woods Project are three NGO coalitions examined. I conclude that there are differences between NGO networks and coalitions and that the coalitions strategically act and react to changing resources in their environments...|$|R

40|$|This study {{analyses}} disadoption {{of water}} harvesting technologies in Ethiopia {{where the average}} disadiption rate in the sample areas {{is as high as}} 42 %. Given that Ethiopia is a drought-prone country with 95 % of its crop production being rain-fed, such a high disadoption rate for irrigation technologies is surprising and urges investigation. Using panel data on 332 Ethiopian farm households collected in 2005 and 2010 we estimate a logit model to identify factors underlying disadoption. We find farm-household, economic, technology-specific, and natural condition variables that relate to disadoption. Mainly, shortage of plastic-sheets, altitude, and distance to market increase disadoption whereas education, experience with water harvesting (learning-by-doing), farm profit, availability of family labour, access to credit, ease of selling output, growing perennial crops, and distance from natural water sources decrease the probability of disadiption. There is no evidence that malaria has a significant effect on disadoption. Based on these findings, improved supply of plastic sheets and motor pumps, and advise to afmers on appropriate crops, credit and improved market accesses could <b>ontribute</b> <b>to</b> decreasing disadoption of water harvesting technologies...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a study of a new {{outpatient}} service for people with personality disorders (Henderson Outreach Service Team: HOST) during its first 2 years of operation. The study is presented {{as an example of}} how service-specific evaluation can be organized using a multiple perspective approach. Four simultaneous strands of investigation were conducted: clinical and socio-demographic characteristics of referrals; clinical activities of the service; service users' views of the service; and views of refcrring professionals. Findings indicate that HOST referrals had high levels of psychosocial disturbance associated with moderate to severe personality disorders. The service provided psychodynamically oriented individual and group treatments that met service-users' needs more appropriately than other local mental health services, but was unable to match the demand for treatment. Referring professionals valued the role of HOST in also providing,specialist management advice. High levels of unmet need among the personality disordered population living in the community are highlighted. Findings have contributed to the reshaping of the service and its relationship to its parent institution (a residential therapeutic community), and have implications for the future development of therapeutic community treatment for personality disorders. The role of effectiveness studies in <b>ontributing</b> <b>to</b> the mental health evidence base is discussed...|$|R

Abstract: The wide evolution of {{private international law}} is currently recalling attention to the general aspects of the discipline. Europeanization and globalisation of sources of private international law do not preclude the chance that conflict of laws should also deal with individual identities. To {{the extent that the}} European systems have hitherto offered to the application of foreign laws, we are faced with the problem of survival in Europe of an idea of the personality of laws.

40|$|The {{research}} of estimating {{of poverty in}} Brazil have been concentrated using the ools of statistical inference or the inefficient use of some ad hoc distributions, or hrough studies of convergence as the b-convergence and s-convergence. This work <b>ontributed</b> <b>to</b> a discussion of different methods of non-parametric statistical inference, {{with the aim of}} estimating the evolution of the density of the poor of CearÃ y smoothing by stochastic kernel (Kernel Density), based on data collected by the National Survey Sample of Households - PNAD (2001, 2003, 2005 and 2007) can be oncluded that the average family income per capita has been increasing during the analysis. There was a contrast between two methodologies for estimating the rate of overty in CearÃ concerning the year 2007, which are: The traditional method (using Discrete Uniform formulation) and an application based on the theory of extreme alues (TEV) that is commonly applied to VaR (Value at Risk) of financial assets. Contrast the results we can conclude that there is strong indication that there is underestimation of poverty rates by using the traditional methodology. As pesquisas de estimaÃÃo da pobreza no Brasil tÃm se concentrado com o uso de ferramentas de inferÃncia estatÃstica pouco eficiente ou com o uso ad hoc de determinadas distribuiÃÃes, ou ainda, atravÃs de estudos de convergÃncia como a bconvergÃncia e a s-convergÃncia. Este trabalho contribuiu com uma discussÃo de diferentes metodologias de inferÃncia estatÃstica nÃo paramÃtrica, com o intuito de se estimar a evoluÃÃo da densidade dos pobres do CearÃ atravÃs de suavizaÃÃo por nÃcleo estocÃstico (Kernel Density), com base nos dados coletados pela Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de DomicÃlios â PNAD (2001, 2003, 2005 e 2007), sendo possÃvel concluir que a renda mÃdia familiar per capita vem aumentando no perÃodo da anÃlise. Houve ainda um contraste entre duas metodologias na estimaÃÃo da proporÃÃo de pobres no CearÃ referente ao ano de 2007, sendo elas: A metodologia tradicional (uso de formulaÃÃo Discreta Uniforme) e uma aplicaÃÃo com base na Teoria do Valor Extremo (TVE) que comumente Ã aplicada em VaR (Value at Risk) de ativos financeiros.

40|$|International audienceThis article {{describes}} {{a particular way}} developed by employees {{to respond to the}} constraints of a very restrictive manufacturing plant: the mutual cooperation. Facing a very strict organizational context, the production workers can only rely on themselves to cope with the constraints of work. In this context, a complex system of strategies is deployed, resulting in a work environment governed by the sense of collaboration and mutual cooperation. The objectives of the implemented strategies, however, go beyond the attempts to reduce the work overload. They may be linked to a way of maintaininghogh levels of productivity and a way for workers ti keep their jobs. We hope <b>to</b> <b>ontribute,</b> through this study, to the general knowledge of the strategies developed by workers in production lines in order to minimize the paths...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we examine the role that is played by interocean fluxes of {{buoyancy}} in stabilizing the present-day overturning circulation of the Atlantic Ocean. A 2 D model of the Atlantic overturning circulation is used, in which the interocean fluxes of heat and salt (via the Bering Strait, the Drake Passage and via Agulhas Leakage) are represented by sources and sinks. The profiles and amplitudes of these sources are based mainly on the heat and salt fluxes in a high-resolution ocean model (OCCAM). When applying realistic sources and sinks, a circulation is favored that is characterized by major downwelling in the northern hemisphere (NPP circulation), and resembles the present-day Atlantic overturning circulation. The Southern Ocean sources appear to stabilize this circulation, whereas Bering Strait freshwater input tends to destabilize it. Already a small buoyancy input at southerly latitudes is enough to prohibit {{the existence of a}} southern sinking circulation (SPP),lea ving the NPP circulation as a unique and stable solution. A large, factor three increase in Bering Strait freshwater import would be necessary to bring the SPP circulation back into existence. Especially the Indian-Atlantic transfer of heat and salt, brought about by Agulhas Leakage,c <b>ontributes</b> considerably <b>to</b> the strength and, in particular, the stability of the northern sinking circulation. According to this model,sh utting off Agulhas Leakage, and consequently the so-called warm water route for North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) compensation, leads to a reduction of the overturning strength by 10...|$|R
