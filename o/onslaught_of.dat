5|$|Storms {{accompanying}} Billie and its remnants brought {{heavy rains}} and strong winds to South Korea, knocking out police telephone lines in Busan. The sudden <b>onslaught</b> <b>of</b> these storms caused a stampede of roughly 70,000people {{out of a}} stadium, resulting in the indirect deaths of 68people, including 51children. Around 125people were injured and 40were hospitalized after the mass evacuation.|$|E
5|$|The Byzantine {{victory was}} {{ultimately}} a pyrrhic one, as the devastating {{impact of the}} war left the Byzantines in much weakened state. Within a few years both empires were overwhelmed by the <b>onslaught</b> <b>of</b> the Arabs who had become newly united by Islam, ultimately leading to the Muslim conquest of Persia in 644 and {{the fall of the}} Sasanian dynasty in 651.|$|E

50|$|In ancient times, some Dwarfs moved far to {{the east}} over the mountains, and were caught by the <b>onslaughts</b> <b>of</b> Chaos. Dwarfs are very {{resistant}} to the forces of Chaos, but these Dwarves gradually changed over time, becoming the evil natured Chaos Dwarves.|$|R
5|$|The city of Arcadia in DeSoto County saw extreme damage, {{in spite}} of being {{relatively}} further inland. About 95% of the buildings {{in the downtown area}} saw some sort of damage. The only shelter in the town had its roof torn open by the wind, leaving 3,500 evacuees inside unprotected from the <b>onslaught</b> <b>of</b> the storm.|$|E
5|$|After the floods, {{helicopters}} airlifted {{relief supplies}} like {{food and water}} to isolated villages, and to residents riding out the floods on their roofs. However, relief coordination was disrupted by damaged communication lines and ongoing rainfall. Rescue boats were used to rescue stranded residents. India's Prime Minister H. D. Deve Gowda provided 500million rupees (US$15million) to help Andhra Pradesh with flood recovery. Conditions returned to normal within 12days of the <b>onslaught</b> <b>of</b> the rains, {{with the exception of}} minor delays to trains. However, another cyclone struck Andhra Pradesh about three weeks after the flood event, killing over 1,000people.|$|E
5|$|The {{arrival of}} the Mediterranean fruit flies in 1929 {{also contributed to the}} nearly {{complete}} destruction of tourism and citrus in South Florida – two vital economic industries in the region. The federal and state government would spend approximately $7million (1929USD) in eradication efforts. There were foreign and domestic bans on the importation of fruits and vegetables from Florida. Programs established by the New Deal and efforts by Florida governors in mid and late 1930s, particularly David Sholtz, brought relief to the economic slump, but the region remained in an abysmal financial state until the <b>onslaught</b> <b>of</b> American involvement in World War II.|$|E
50|$|Macedonia was ravaged {{several times}} in the 4th and the 5th century by desolating <b>onslaughts</b> <b>of</b> Visigoths, Huns and Vandals.

5|$|The {{result was}} devastating. Five {{thousand}} French soldiers {{fell in a}} matter of minutes and the entire engagement stood on the brink of disaster. Not only did they face the Russian fire, but the French artillery pounded them as well. Augereau's Corps melted under the withering fire, the bayonets of the Russians, and the <b>onslaught</b> <b>of</b> the cavalry; as they retreated to their own lines, Napoleon was nearly captured at the Eylau churchyard, where he had established a lookout post, but his escort cavalry chased the Russians away.|$|E
5|$|Before Juan made landfall, about 100 people {{evacuated}} around Port Arthur, Texas. In Louisiana, about 6,550 people evacuated, including only 700 of the 1,900 residents on Grand Isle; many {{of those}} who stayed behind there were trapped after the <b>onslaught</b> <b>of</b> the storm surge. About 6,000 people evacuated in Mississippi due to the threat for flooding. Many schools were closed along the coast in Louisiana and Mississippi, and two beaches were closed both sides of the Brownsville, Texas shipping channel. On October 28, governor Edwin Edwards {{declared a state of emergency}} for 13 Louisiana parishes, while officials issued flash flood watches for 42 of Louisiana's 64 parishes. Governor George Wallace also declared a state of emergency for Alabama, and shelters were opened along the coast.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the Spartan counter-attack against the Epiriotes filling the trench, Pyrrhus decided to personally lead a charge against the Spartan lines. Mounted on his horse, the Epiriote King was able to force his away through the trench, over the wagons and into the city {{with a group of}} his companions. The sudden <b>onslaught</b> <b>of</b> Pyrrhus sparked panic amongst the defenders of this section. At this point Pyrrhus' horse was wounded by a javelin which pierced its belly causing it to throw the King to the ground. The fall of the King threw his companions into a state of confusion and enabled the Spartans to rally. The Spartans launched a barrage of missiles at the King's comrades, felling many of them. Despite the deaths of many of his guards, Pyrrhus was successfully taken to the safety of the main Epiriote lines.|$|E

5|$|Taibbi {{begins the}} work by quoting from his 2008 book The Great Derangement, asserting he {{predicted}} the <b>onslaught</b> <b>of</b> fake {{news and the}} beginnings of the alt-right in society. He argues such societal factors helped set the tone for a climate in which Trump could ascend to the presidency. Taibbi writes that Trump's prior experiences in reality television gave him the tools to triumph in an era of post-truth politics. He criticizes the media for its coverage of Trump, describing how the candidate's inflammatory campaign rhetoric led to increased publicity. The book documents a chronology of the author's thoughts over time as he begins to realize Trump's increasing chances of success. Taibbi reflects back on the events after the election, concluding Trump won because he was able to harness the power of television.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, H.D. {{traveled}} to Vienna to undergo analysis with Sigmund Freud. She {{had an interest}} in Freud's theories as far back as 1909, when she read some of his works in the original German. H.D. was referred by Bryher's psychoanalyst due to her apparent paranoia about the rise of Adolf Hitler which indicated another world war, an idea that H.D. found intolerable. The Great War (World War I) had left her feeling shattered. She had lost her brother in action, while her husband suffered effects of combat experiences, and she believed that the <b>onslaught</b> <b>of</b> the war indirectly caused the death of her child with Aldington: she believed it was her shock at hearing the news about the RMS Lusitania that directly caused her child to be stillborn. Writing on the Wall, her memoir about this psychoanalysis, was written concurrently with Trilogy and published in 1944; in 1956 it was republished with Advent, a journal of the analysis, under the title Tribute to Freud.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Babs {{entered the}} PAGASA area of responsibility, {{government}} workers began closely tracking {{the storm and}} warned residents to be prepared. PAGASA issued a Public Storm Warning Signal #4 for Catanduanes, with lower warnings issued throughout Luzon and the Visayas. Metro Manila was placed under Public Storm Warning Signal #3 on October22. In Catanduanes, evacuees utilized public schools as an emergency shelter, although many rode out the storm in their homes. The storm halted ferry service throughout the region, stranding thousands. Many residents in Samar slept in buses and cars for two days due to the cancellations. Bus service to the region was also halted. The stock and currency exchanges were closed during the storm. Officials advised residents in Metro Manila to remain indoors; government buildings and schools were closed, while Ninoy Aquino International Airport halted all domestic flights. In addition, 14international flights were canceled. Manila South Harbor also kept all boats at port. Across the Philippines, Babs forced about 400,000people to leave their houses. Many families waited to evacuate until the <b>onslaught</b> <b>of</b> the strongest winds, resulting in additional casualties.|$|E
50|$|It is {{possible}} that the Mountain Jews are descendants of Persian-Jewish soldiers who were stationed in the Caucasus by the Sasanian kings in the fifth or sixth century to protect the area from the <b>onslaughts</b> <b>of</b> the Huns and other nomadic invaders from the east. Under the impact of the invading Turkish hordes, later generations of Jewish inhabitants of the Caucasian lowlands were forced to migrate even further north to Daghestan.|$|R

50|$|During Father Rale's War, the {{inhabitants}} of Brunswick were hospitably gathered within the refuge. Many times this hospitality was strained to its most generous capacity as the <b>onslaughts</b> <b>of</b> Indian attacks were incessant. The most significant attack was when the fort was under siege during {{the early days of}} Father Rale's War (1722). In 1725, Captain William Woodside took command of the fort and Gyles was sent to Fort St. George (Thomaston, Maine).|$|R
5|$|In Trinidad and Tobago, the {{government}} set up shelters and sent home non-essential oil workers. Officials canceled flights {{and shut the}} ports as a precaution. Stores and business closed early after locals had stocked up on life supplies. Army troops were deployed in Port of Spain to avert looting. The threat of the storm caused a rise in unleaded oil prices. In Venezuela, boats were ordered to remain at port, while flights were canceled to Isla Margarita and Puerto la Cruz. Rescue workers were mobilized {{in the capital city}} of Caracas to prepare in the event of landslides. Ahead of the storm, the head of Sucre state declared a state of emergency, and later Caracas was placed under the same state once the rains began. According to the governor of Venezuela's capital district, local weather media expected the storm to only brush Caracas and surrounding areas; as a result, not all precautions were made. On August7, weather officials stated that the brunt of the storm had passed and that the storm was weakening; this was before the <b>onslaught</b> <b>of</b> the flooding rains. In neighboring Colombia, officials issued a wind and heavy rain warning in response to the storm. Towns shut off electricity along the coast and canceled flights. Later, about 1,000people evacuated from eastern Costa Rica, and another 40,000evacuated from portions of Nicaragua, Flights in the country were canceled due to the storm.|$|E
5|$|The Ehoie of Salmoneus' {{daughter}} Tyro {{provides the}} transition {{to the families of the}} male Aeolids. As king of Elis, Salmoneus forced his subjects to worship him as Zeus and simulated the god's thunder and lighting by dragging bronze cauldrons from his chariot and throwing torches through the air. The real Zeus destroyed king and subjects alike, but spared Tyro and conducted her to the house of her uncle Cretheus in Thessaly because she wrangled with her impious father. There she became enamoured of the river Enipeus, but Poseidon had his own designs upon Tyro and in the guise of the river lay with her, siring Neleus and Pelias. The brothers did not get along, and Zeus gave them different realms to rule: Pelias received as his lot Iolcos; to Neleus fell Pylos in the western Peloponnese. The house of Neleus now takes center-stage. Heracles sacked Pylos, killing all the male Neleids, save Nestor who was off in Gerenia, another Messenian city. Periclymenus, a son of Neleus to whom Poseidon had granted the ability to change shape, was Pylos' only bulwark against the <b>onslaught</b> <b>of</b> Heracles, and the Catalogue-poet granted him a brief aristeia which ended when Athena pointed out that the bee on Heracles' chariot was actually the Pylian defender. Following the account of Nestor's marriage and family, the contest for Neleus' daughter Pero was narrated. The father would give her hand to whoever could rustle the cattle of Iphicles from Phylace, a feat accomplished by Bias with the help of his brother Melampus. The poet then turned to the family of Pelias as the last assignable papyrus fragment from book 1 breaks off. It is likely that Tyro's children by Cretheus—Aeson, Pheres and Amythaon—followed, and there might have been room in the book to at least start the family of Cretheus' brother Athamas.|$|E

50|$|Mountain Jews {{are known}} for their {{military}} tradition and have been historically viewed as fierce warriors.
