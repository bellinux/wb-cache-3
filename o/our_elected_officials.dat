50|$|Public administrators act {{independently}} of legislators and most <b>elected</b> <b>officials.</b> This ensures that those on elections boards can operate independent of political influence.

40|$|Although citizen-initiated {{contacting}} {{of municipal}} bureau-crats {{has been the}} subject of extensive research over the past quarter century, there has been relatively little research on the contacting of municipal <b>elected</b> <b>officials</b> or on why citizens might contact <b>elected</b> <b>officials</b> instead of appointed administrators. This research explores that question by using survey data on citizen-initiated contacts with various <b>elected</b> <b>officials</b> and appointed administrators in Atlanta, Georgia. The findings suggest a several-part answer: First, citizens—in Atlanta anyway—usually prefer to contact city departments directly rather than through their <b>elected</b> <b>officials,</b> presumably because most contacts involve concerns about municipal services that a department must even-tually address. Second, citizens contact both departments and <b>elected</b> <b>officials</b> for many of the same reasons; the most promi-nent reason is perceived problems with services. Third, the con-tacting of <b>elected</b> <b>officials</b> appears to be influenced by frustration with the bureaucracy (i. e., dissatisfaction with bureaucratic help-fulness when the bureaucracy is contacted) and also by ignorance of the bureaucracy (i. e., not knowing who to contact there). We conclude this article with a discussion of the possible implications of the findings for public administrators. Citizen-initiated contacting of municipal bureaucrats—when individuals contact government personnel with requests for services or with complaints—{{has been the subject}} of extensive research over the past quarter century (see, for example, Serra 1995; Sharp 1986; Jones et al. 1977). Anecdotal evidence sug-gests that citizens often instead take those same requests and complaints to municipal <b>elected</b> <b>officials,</b> but there is little evi-dence that explains why citizens might choose <b>elected</b> <b>officials</b> over appointed administrators (as exceptions, see Clingermaye...|$|R
