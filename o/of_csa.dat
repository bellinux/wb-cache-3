40|$|Background: A growing {{population}} of Canadian students are travelling outside of Canada for medical training. The {{purpose of this}} study is to assess the opportunity for Canadians studying medicine abroad (CSAs) to secure post-graduate medical residency positions as International medical graduates (IMGs) in Canada. Methods: Current statistics on IMG applicants into the Canadian Residency Matching Service (CaRMS) will be compared to the number <b>of</b> <b>CSAs</b> applying to return to Canada. Results: In 2010, 75 % (1232) of IMG applicants were unmatched following application to CaRMS, despite a doubling in positions reserved for IMGs from 2003. An estimated 3750 CSAs are currently attending over 55 medical schools globally; a six-fold increase since first reports in 2006. Between 2012 and 2014, it is estimated that 72. 8 % <b>of</b> <b>CSAs</b> will graduate, with 90. 4 % hoping to return to Canada for post-graduate residency training.   Discussion: The increasing population <b>of</b> <b>CSAs</b> poses a significant risk for future IMGs attempting to secure postgraduate training positions in Canada. From this perspective, we have coined the term ‘Canadian IMG Bottleneck’ – which describes the funnelling effect that has been created by the growing number <b>of</b> <b>CSAs</b> and the limited number of IMG residency positions available in Canada...|$|R
25|$|The {{paper has}} been criticized for restricting its {{analysis}} to convenience samples of college students, possibly introducing systematic bias by excluding victims so traumatized that they did not go on to attend college. Another possibility was that Rind et al.'s conclusions may not be generalizable beyond college populations in general as individuals with a history <b>of</b> <b>CSA</b> were more likely than non-abused individuals to drop out of college after a single semester.|$|E

25|$|Similarly, {{psychiatrist}} David Spiegel {{said that}} the inclusion of Landis' 1956 study was unjustified. He argued that, while weighting larger studies more than smaller makes sense, combining {{the results of a}} large study examining very mild trauma (such as fending off an attacker) with studies of long-term physical and sexual abuse was inappropriate and led to erroneous conclusions. Rind et al. replied that Spiegel misrepresented their analysis, since they did not use Landis' study in the meta-analysis of childhood sexual abuse – symptom correlations, but only for examining the self-reported effects <b>of</b> <b>CSA.</b> They contend that the way they handled Landis' data maximized negative reports and minimized the possible deflating effect of Landis' data on the overall effect sizes.|$|E

30|$|Previous {{research}} on <b>CSAs</b> <b>of</b> trunk muscles {{has been conducted}} from various viewpoints, {{and one of the}} most studied research topics is LBP (Barker et al. 2004; Danneels et al. 2000; Demoulin et al. 2007; Keller et al. 2004). Patients with LBP seemed to exhibit asymmetrical <b>CSAs</b> <b>of</b> trunk muscles (Clark et al. 2009; Hyun et al. 2007; Kulig et al. 2009). Furthermore, LBP patients have been reported to demonstrate significantly smaller trunk muscle CSA than healthy control people. Studies among athletes indicated a similar tendency—athletes with LBP had asymmetrical and smaller <b>CSAs</b> <b>of</b> trunk muscles (Hides et al. 2008 a, b, 2010 a, b). However, we did not investigate the prevalence of LBP in combat sports athletes. Further studies are needed in order to identify the relationship between <b>CSAs</b> <b>of</b> the trunk muscles and LBP in combat sports athletes. To our knowledge, no previous research has compared <b>CSAs</b> <b>of</b> trunk muscles in athletes with LDD. Therefore, implementing medical check-ups including assessments <b>of</b> <b>CSAs</b> <b>of</b> lumbar muscles using MRI would be beneficial for elite athletes at least.|$|R
25|$|In {{the field}} of complex {{molecule}} synthesis, TBS has been widely used {{as one of the}} most versatile of the silicon-based protecting groups (scheme 4). The use <b>of</b> <b>CSA</b> provides selective removal of a primary TBS ether in the presence of tertiary TBS ether and TIPS ethers. Other means of TBS deprotection include acids (also Lewis acids), and fluorides. TIPS protecting groups were also pioneered by Corey and provide increased selectivity of primary alcohol protection over secondary and tertiary alcohol protection. TIPS ethers are more stable under acidic and basic conditions, the disadvantage of this protecting group over TBS ethers being that the group is less labile for deprotection. The most common reagents used for cleavage employ the same conditions as TBS ether, but longer reaction times are generally needed.|$|E

500|$|By {{the end of}} August it {{was obvious}} that the {{organizations}} in Saskatchewan and Manitoba {{were not going to be}} ready in time for the 1923 crop, and the committee decided to proceed alone. It determined that if farmers representing half of Alberta's total wheat acreage agreed to pool their crop by September 15, the pool would proceed. Brownlee believed that this was an impossible objective. [...] Despite the experimental and unproven nature of the model and the as-yet nonexistent organization that was to execute it, this objective was met. [...] The Alberta Wheat Pool was born. By the following year's harvest, comparable organizations had formed in Saskatchewan and Manitoba, and a Central Selling Agency (CSA) was formed to sell all three provinces' wheat. [...] The CSA's first president, Alexander James McPhail (whom Brownlee helped select), offered Brownlee the position <b>of</b> <b>CSA</b> general manager, at the attractive salary of $20,000 per year (a figure that Brownlee had helped set). At the urging of his government colleagues and the UFA leadership, both of who felt his continued presence in Edmonton was vital to the UFA government's hold on power, he declined; he was instead made the CSA's general counsel. [...] Brownlee was also heavily involved in the creation of a livestock pool and three dairy pools, as a sort of [...] "poolmania" [...] hit Alberta farmers.|$|E
40|$|Critical source areas (<b>CSAs)</b> define areas <b>of</b> a farm or {{catchment}} that emit {{the majority}} of water quality contaminants but account for {{a minority of the}} area at a field, farm or catchment scale. Using process based modelling we tested the hypothesis that the definition and management <b>of</b> <b>CSAs</b> would decrease losses of phosphorus (P) in two New Zealand catchments and nitrogen (N) in a French catchment. In the New Zealand catchment, <b>CSAs</b> <b>of</b> P loss were isolated to small areas within fields commensurate with surface flow pathways, while in the French catchment, CSAs for N loss were influenced by factors (inputs and land use) relevant at a field (or multiple field) scale. Scenarios were tested that examined the management <b>of</b> <b>CSAs</b> versus whole field management for P, and decreasing N loss within CSAs by increasing the proportion of grassland fields and changing their location relative to cropland. The results showed that N losses decreased by up to 25 % as more grassland was incorporated into the catchment, especially in wet areas near valley bottoms due to a longer growth period and better utilisation/storage of N than cropland. For P, focusing mitigation on CSAs decreased catchment losses to a similar degree as mitigations applied across the whole catchment, but was on average 6 - 7 times more cost-effective. Therefore, the definition and management <b>of</b> <b>CSAs</b> at an appropriate scale is recommended to improve water quality and minimise the impact on farm profitability...|$|R

2500|$|The {{results of}} the {{meta-analysis}} indicated that college students who had experienced CSA were slightly less well-adjusted compared to other students who had not experienced CSA, but that family environment was a significant confound that {{may be responsible for}} the association between CSA and harm. Intense, pervasive harm and long-term maladjustment were due to confounding variables in most studies rather than to the sexual abuse itself (though exceptions were noted for abuse accompanied by force or incest). Both studies addressed four [...] "assumed properties" [...] <b>of</b> <b>CSA,</b> identified by the authors: gender equivalence (both genders affected equally), causality (CSA causes harm), pervasiveness (most victims <b>of</b> <b>CSA</b> are harmed) and intensity (the harm is normally significant and long-term), concluding that all four [...] "assumed properties" [...] were questionable and had several potential confounds.|$|E
2500|$|Rind, Bauserman and Tromovitch {{responded to}} this {{criticism}} by saying that [...] "the representativeness of college samples is in fact irrelevant to the stated goals and conclusions of our study" [...] since the purpose of their research was [...] "to examine {{the validity of the}} clinical concept" [...] <b>of</b> <b>CSA.</b> They added that according to the commonly understood definition of the term, child sexual abuse is extremely and pervasively harmful, meaning that [...] "in any population sampled - drug addicts, psychiatric patients, or college students - persons who have experienced CSA should show strong evidence of the assumed properties of CSA." [...] The authors of the study say that because the college sample did not show pervasive harm, [...] "the broad and unqualified claims about the properties <b>of</b> <b>CSA</b> are contradicted". Rind et al. also said that using college samples was appropriate because their study found similar prevalence rates and experiences of severity and outcomes between college samples and national samples.|$|E

2500|$|Dallam et al. also {{contend that}} Rind et al. miscoded or misreported {{significant}} amounts of the underlying study data, thereby skewing the results. Dallam et al. contend that Rind et al. incorrectly used [...] "Pearson's r" [...] instead of [...] "Cohen's d" [...] to calculate the effect size, {{which resulted in a}} failure to correct for base-rate differences <b>of</b> <b>CSA</b> in male and female samples, and which led to the finding that males were less harmed by CSA.

2500|$|There {{has been}} greater {{emphasis}} in subsequent {{work on the}} range of responses that are possible from victims. For example, a few studies make reference to the paper's findings about [...] "consensual" [...] encounters, but approach it from the opposite direction (i.e., {{that the use of}} force causes more intense negative outcomes). [...] Heather Ulrich, author of the aforementioned replication of the meta-analysis, later drew on the findings to study the reasons for the variability in outcomes <b>of</b> <b>CSA</b> victims, such as attributional style (individual's causal explanations for why the abuse occurred), family environment, and social support.|$|E

2500|$|Rind et al.'s {{model of}} [...] "assumed {{properties}} {{of child sexual}} abuse," [...] (that is, of universal and pervasive harm in all victims <b>of</b> <b>CSA)</b> has been criticized as a straw man assertion {{in that it is}} both simplistic and misleading. The reactions of victims in their adult lives {{have been found to be}} extremely varied, ranging from severe to nearly unnoticeable, and many pathologies are not diagnosable in the strictly clinical sense Rind uses. Victims often have a flawed or distorted appraisal of their abuse, and fail to connect distressing and sometimes debilitating pathologies with their experiences. Further, these studies make no accounting for emotional support of the victim's family, clinical treatment of the victim prior to the study, or personal resiliency, which can easily account for less severe outcomes.|$|E
2500|$|The study's {{lead author}} is {{psychologist}} Bruce Rind, and it expanded on a 1997 meta-analysis for which Rind is also lead author. The authors stated {{their goal was}} to determine whether CSA caused pervasive, significant psychological harm for both males and females, controversially concluding that the harm caused by child sexual abuse was not necessarily intense or pervasive, that the prevailing construct <b>of</b> <b>CSA</b> was not scientifically valid, as it failed empirical verification, and that the psychological damage caused by the abusive encounters depends on other factors such as the degree of coercion or force involved. [...] The authors concluded that even though CSA may not result in lifelong, significant harm to all victims, this does not mean it is not morally wrong and indicated that their findings did not imply current moral and legal prohibitions against CSA should be changed.|$|E
2500|$|In 1997, {{psychology}} professor Bruce Rind from Temple University and doctoral student Philip Tromovitch from the University of Pennsylvania published a literature review in The Journal of Sex Research of seven studies regarding adjustment problems {{of victims of}} child sexual abuse (CSA). [...] To avoid the sampling bias that, they argued, existed in most studies <b>of</b> <b>CSA</b> (which drew from samples mostly in the mental health or legal systems and thus were, as a sample, unlike the population as a whole), the 1997 study combined data from studies using only national samples of individuals expected to be more representative of the population {{of child sexual abuse}} victims. This study examined 10 independent samples designed to be nationally representative, based on data from more than 8,500 participants. Four of the studies came from the United States, and one each came from Great Britain, Canada, and Spain.|$|E

40|$|To {{determine}} {{the variability in}} fibre areas in the human vastus lateralis muscle, cross-sections (15 microns) of whole autopsied muscles from eight young men have been prepared, and the cross-sectional area (<b>CSA)</b> <b>of</b> 375 type 1 and 375 type 2 fibres has been measured in five different regions throughout each muscle. The <b>CSA</b> <b>of</b> both fibre types varied significantly within all muscle cross-sections. Fibres in the deep parts of the muscle were larger than superficially. There was a significant correlation between the <b>CSA</b> <b>of</b> the two fibre types within each region: if a fibre of a given type was small, or large, the other fibre type was also small, or large. The <b>CSA</b> <b>of</b> type 2 fibres was larger than the <b>CSA</b> <b>of</b> type 1 fibres in 26 of the 40 regions: regions with type 1 fibres larger than type 2 fibres were mostly (71 %) found deep in the muscle. The standard deviation <b>of</b> the <b>CSA</b> <b>of</b> type 1 fibres was significantly larger than for type 2 fibres in 35 of the 40 regions. In conclusion, the <b>CSA</b> <b>of</b> the different fibre types in the vastus lateralis of young men varies non-randomly. The pattern of variation, both throughout the muscle and in small sample regions, supports the general opinion that the functional demands placed on the fibre population are {{an important factor in}} the development of the fibre properties...|$|R
