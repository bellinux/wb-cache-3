5|$|Mercedes (Amber Riley) {{is elected}} {{president}} of the Troubletones, and tells Santana that she should play fair against New Directions from now on. Santana makes a rare apology to Finn in the school hallway, but her so-called apology consists of a series of insults. As she walks away, Finn retaliates by telling her to come out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>closet,</b> and calls her a coward for constantly tearing others down while not accepting herself and her relationship with Brittany. A couple of days later, Santana is told by Sue and Burt that the niece of one of their opponents in the election overheard the conversation between her and Finn, and said opponent is about to release an attack ad that criticizes Sue for choosing a lesbian as head cheerleader. Santana runs out of the office in tears, saying that her parents do not yet know she is gay. The episode concludes with the Troubletones' mash-up of Adele songs. The moment the performance ends, Santana jumps down from the stage, blames Finn for outing her to the world and slaps him in the face.|$|E

Police Chief Edward Garrity stated he believed that Barker had recently been placed in the closet as the puppy had been fed recently, and there was no animal waste in the closet despite the dog not being housebroken.|$|E

40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} of Duke University PressIt is probably impossible {{to think about}} the English term homosexuality in a contemporary context without addressing at some point <b>the</b> shadowy enclosure <b>of</b> “the closet”; in Taipei’s tongzhi activist and academic circles it has become increasingly difficult to ignore <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> “the mask. ” While {{it would be difficult to}} argue simply that the mask operates in Taiwan where <b>the</b> <b>closet</b> does in Europe, the United States, and Australia—since, for one thing, <b>the</b> language <b>of</b> <b>the</b> homosexual <b>closet</b> [yigui] coexists with and interpenetrates that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mask [mianju] in Taiwan—I nevertheless hope to hold the tropes analytically distinct to a certain degree. This essay, then, considers the mask and <b>the</b> <b>closet</b> and is particularly concerned with some specific questions, which include the following: If <b>the</b> <b>closet</b> is organized around an irresolvable tension between secrecy and disclosure, how does the mask operate in relation to these terms? Is it possible that the mask has other, different investments instead of or alongside them? What perverse relationships might there be between the tongzhi mask and <b>the</b> idea <b>of</b> tongzhi “identity”? What kind of subject and what kind of “homosexuality” are projected by <b>the</b> trope <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tongzhi mask in its various deployments? My project is to chart some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> logics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tongxinglian/tongzhi mask, not necessarily in decisive distinction to those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> homosexual <b>closet,</b> but nevertheless to take account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mask’s cultural and historical specificity. I am aided in these speculations by a consideration of Ta-wei Chi’s 1995 novella The Membranes, which appears in <b>the</b> final section <b>of</b> this essay as a text inhabited by a logic and a subject analogous to those suggested by the mask.

50|$|Although {{the more}} {{advanced}} water closet (flush toilet) was popular in wealthy homes, <b>the</b> lack <b>of</b> an adequate water supply and poor sewerage meant that in 19th-century England, in working-class neighbourhoods, towns and cities often chose dry conservancy methods <b>of</b> waste disposal. <b>The</b> pail <b>closet</b> was an evolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> midden <b>closet</b> (privy midden or midden closet), an impractical and unsanitary amenity considered a nuisance to public health. The pail system was popular in France and England, particularly in the historic Lancashire town of Rochdale, from which the system commonly took its name. <b>The</b> pail <b>closet</b> was not without its own problems; if the pail was not emptied on a regular basis, it overflowed and became unhygienic. Some manufacturers lined the pail with absorbent materials, and other designs used mixtures of dry earth or ash to disguise the smell.|$|R
