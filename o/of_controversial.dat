5|$|At the World Cup, Croatia {{were drawn}} with host-nation Brazil, Mexico and Cameroon. In the opening {{game of the}} tournament, Croatia lost 3–1 to Brazil. The match {{garnered}} heavy media attention as Japanese referee Yuichi Nishimura was scrutinized for a number <b>of</b> <b>controversial</b> decisions. In their second game, Croatia won 4–0 against Cameroon, but did not progress from the group as they lost 3–1 to Mexico in their final fixture.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days of his administration, Leggett took the lead on a number <b>of</b> <b>controversial</b> issues. To help {{alleviate}} transportation funding difficulties and move County transit projects forward, he proposed a statewide gas tax increase, a position he first articulated in his race for County Executive. This proposal, which happened {{in the midst of a}} state budget crunch and in response to high levels of traffic congestion in the county, was supported by the County Council but largely ignored by incoming Governor Martin O'Malley. Leggett continued to advocate for the increase throughout his term.|$|E

Sceptics say that to claim that a name or name letters influences life decisions is an extraordinary claim that requires extraordinary evidence.|$|E

5|$|The Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) is an American self-regulatory {{organization}} that assigns age and content ratings to consumer video games.

5|$|The {{battle was}} brought to greater public {{attention}} in 1992 by a CBC television docu-drama, The Valour and the Horror, which made a number <b>of</b> <b>controversial</b> claims about senior leadership in the Second World War and devoted one of its three episodes to the Black Watch attack on Verrières Ridge. The episode raised a spirited debate among the historical and veterans' communities and led to calls for apologies from the producers and an official investigation by the CBC Ombudsman into the veracity of the claims {{and the way in}} which they were presented.|$|E

5|$|The {{legislature}} {{largely ignored}} the governor's message {{in favor of}} partisan concerns. A pure food and drug law was enacted without his signature. His veto <b>of</b> <b>controversial</b> legislation regulating railroad rates, however, was sustained. Both houses passed a resolution calling for the resignation of Senator William Lindsay, a Gold Democrat who did not support William Jennings Bryan's presidential bid, on grounds {{that he no longer}} represented the interests of his party. Lindsay responded that he represented the people of Kentucky and refused to resign his seat.|$|E
5|$|After the Japanese {{surrender}} in 1945, Chen {{returned to}} Shanghai. He joined the China Film No. 2 Studio that was newly {{established by the}} Nationalist government. He wrote and directed the film Far Away Love, whose premiere in Shanghai's Huanghou Theatre on 18 January 1947 was considered a landmark event in postwar Chinese cinema. The film starred prominent actors and actresses such as Zhao Dan, Qin Yi, and Wu Yin, and the Ministry of Defence put uniformed soldiers under Chen's command for the filming. It {{was the first in}} a series <b>of</b> <b>controversial</b> epics on the social turmoil caused by the war. In late 1947, he made another film Rhapsody of Happiness, written by Chen Baichen.|$|E
5|$|At the 2012 Summer Olympics, Sinclair {{broke the}} record of most goals scored in the Olympics for women's soccer, {{claiming}} the golden boot of the competition from two goals against South Africa, one against Great Britain, and three against the United States. She scored a hat-trick in a 4–3 extra time loss in the semifinal match against the American squad. Canada was unhappy {{with the performance of}} referee Christina Pedersen, who made a series <b>of</b> <b>controversial</b> decisions in favour of the Americans. Sinclair was ultimately fined a reported $3,500 and banned four matches for post match comments, which accused Pedersen of bias and deciding the result of the match before it had kicked off.|$|E

5|$|Celtic {{then found}} {{themselves}} {{embroiled in a}} series <b>of</b> <b>controversial</b> matches {{in the second round}} against Rapid Wien. Celtic lost the first leg 1–3 in Vienna, but despite rough-house tactics from the Austrians, it was only Celtic's Alan McInally who found himself red-carded. The return match at Parkhead was an even more bad-tempered affair as Celtic raced to a 3–0 lead with goals from Brian McClair, Murdo MacLeod and Tommy Burns, all in spite of Rapid's foul play. The match erupted near the end when Burns was punched by Reinhard Kienast. In the ensuing chaos, coins and at least one bottle were thrown onto the pitch by some Celtic fans. None appeared to hit anybody, but one of the Rapid Wien players, Rudi Weinhofer, was carried off the pitch with his head swathed in bandages. The match finished 3–0, with Celtic winning the tie 4–3 on aggregate.|$|E
5|$|Comic strips {{have also}} dealt in subtext and innuendo, their wide {{distribution}} in newspapers limiting their inclusion <b>of</b> <b>controversial</b> material. The first openly gay characters appeared in prominent strips {{in the late}} 1970s; representation of LGBT issues in these titles causes vociferous reaction, both praise and condemnation, to the present day. Comic strips aimed at LGBT audiences are also syndicated in gay- and lesbian-targeted magazines and comics have been created to educate people about LGBT-related issues and to influence real-world politics, with their format and distribution allowing them to transmit messages more subtle, complex, and positive than typical education material. Portrayal of LGBT themes in comics is recognized by several notable awards, including the Gaylactic Spectrum Awards and GLAAD Media Awards for outstanding comic book and comic strip.|$|E
5|$|Greece and Turkey {{also joined}} the {{alliance}} in 1952, forcing a series <b>of</b> <b>controversial</b> negotiations, {{in which the}} United States and Britain were the primary disputants, over how to bring the two countries into the military command structure. While this overt military preparation was going on, covert stay-behind arrangements initially made by the Western European Union to continue resistance after a successful Soviet invasion, including Operation Gladio, were transferred to NATO control. Ultimately unofficial bonds began to grow between NATO's armed forces, such as the NATO Tiger Association and competitions such as the Canadian Army Trophy for tank gunnery.|$|E

5|$|Outside {{the field}} of comics, Adams has also {{provided}} illustrations for various magazines, such as , as well as toy designs, video games, and X-Men-themed cans of Chef Boyardee pasta. In 2016 he provided the illustration for a satirical piece in GQ magazine that imagined a number <b>of</b> <b>controversial</b> public figures as comic book supervillains, including Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, Sepp Blatter, Martin Shkreli and Kris Jenner. Later that year, Dynamite Entertainment announced it that would be producing limited edition poly-resin busts of female characters for its Women of Dynamite line, based on Adams' renditions of those characters and sculpted by Jason Smith. The first bust was a Red Sonja bust debuting in November, followed by a Vampirella bust in February 2017.|$|E
5|$|Pilcher {{spent his}} early {{career as an}} {{infantry}} officer, first seeing active service on colonial campaigns in Nigeria in the late 1890s followed by field command in the Second Boer War (1899–1902), on which he published a book of lessons learned in 1903. Following the war, he held a number of senior commands in India. However, further promotion was checked by his having come into conflict with his commander-in-chief, who regarded him as unsuited for senior command {{in part because of}} his writings; Pilcher was a keen student of the German army and its operational methods, and an active theorist who published a number <b>of</b> <b>controversial</b> books advocating the adoption of new military techniques as well as an anonymous invasion novel.|$|E
5|$|Seven {{versions}} of Blade Runner {{exist as a}} result <b>of</b> <b>controversial</b> changes made {{at the request of}} studio executives. A director's cut was released in 1992 after a strong response to test screenings of a workprint. This, in conjunction with the film's popularity as a video rental, made it one of the first movies to be released on DVD. In 2007, Warner Bros.released The Final Cut, a 25th-anniversary digitally remastered version, and the only version over which Scott retained artistic control. The Final Cut was shown in selected theaters and released on DVD, HD DVD, and Blu-ray.|$|E
