5|$|After the 1848 finding <b>of</b> <b>gold</b> <b>in</b> the Sierra Nevada and {{dramatic}} gains in new wealth from it, other men {{became interested in}} the potential for gold mining in the Black Hills. In 1874, Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer led a military expedition from Fort Abraham Lincoln near Bismarck, to explore the Black Hills for gold and to determine a suitable location for a military fort in the Hills. Custer's announcement <b>of</b> <b>gold</b> <b>in</b> the Black Hills triggered the Black Hills Gold Rush. Tensions increased between the Lakota and whites seeking to move into the Black Hills.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, hard-rock mining {{wound up}} {{becoming}} {{the single largest}} source of gold produced in the Gold Country. The total production <b>of</b> <b>gold</b> <b>in</b> California from then till now is estimated at 118 million ounces (3700 t).|$|E
5|$|The {{price of}} platinum, like other {{industrial}} commodities, is more volatile than that <b>of</b> <b>gold.</b> <b>In</b> 2008, {{the price of}} platinum dropped from $2,252 to $774 per oz, a loss of nearly 2/3 of its value. By contrast, {{the price of gold}} dropped from ~$1,000 to ~$700/oz during the same time frame, a loss of only 1/3 of its value.|$|E

5|$|Antony Gibbs & Sons {{may have}} {{intended}} to employ Great Britain only to exploit a temporary demand for passenger {{service to the}} Australian gold fields following the discovery <b>of</b> <b>gold</b> <b>in</b> Victoria in 1851, but she found long-term employment on this route. For her new role she was given a third refit. Her passenger accommodation was increased from 360 to 730, and her sail-plan altered to a traditional three-masted, square-rigged pattern. She was fitted with a removable propeller, which could be hauled up on deck by chains to reduce drag when under sail power alone.|$|E
5|$|At {{that time}} in Hawaii, gold coins brought a premium over their face value if {{purchased}} with silver; only gold {{could be used for}} certain transactions, such as paying customs duties. Silver had been heavily imported into the kingdom in the 1870s despite government efforts to slow the flow with taxes, and thus gold was more expensive there in terms of silver than in the United States, which was more stable monetarily. Any large influx of silver into circulation, such as by the Kalākaua coins, meant that silver {{in the hands of the}} public might become worth less in terms <b>of</b> <b>gold.</b> <b>In</b> 1883, Hawaii was in a recession, due in part to a fall in sugar prices because of overproduction.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{discovery}} <b>of</b> <b>gold</b> <b>in</b> California, {{a large amount}} of gold coins began appearing in American commercial channels. The influx caused the price of gold relative to silver to decrease, making silver coins worth more as bullion than as currency. They were exported abroad, or else melted locally for their bullion value. As it was profitable to export silver, little was presented at the Mint, which resulted in low mintage numbers for the silver dollar; 1,300 and 1,100 were struck in 1851 and 1852 respectively. The rarity of these dates was recognized by the late 1850s; Mint employees made surreptitious restrikes to sell to collectors.|$|E

5|$|In fall 1903, {{the flood}} of miners leaving the Tanana Valley ended when major gold strikes were made north of Fairbanks. The gold was deeper than in the Klondike, and it had taken time to dig to it. At Cleary Creek, miner Jesse Noble {{discovered}} what became the richest vein <b>of</b> <b>gold</b> <b>in</b> Alaska. Gold extraction was slow, because almost no heavy machinery was available to remove the overburden above the layers of gold. The gold discoveries of 1903 reversed the trend of people away from the Tanana Valley. By Christmas 1903, there were between 1,500 and 1,800 miners in the valley. Another food shortage arose {{during the winter of}} 1903, alleviated only by the food Barnette had brought in after his trip to the Lower 48.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1820s, when Manuel José García was Minister of Finance, the {{government}} borrowed heavily to finance new projects {{and to pay}} off war debts. These loans were tendered at usurious rates: in one notorious loan, {{the government}} received credit for £570,000 from the Baring Brothers {{in exchange for a}} debt of £1,000,000. In the 1820s, the peso papel began to lose value rapidly with respect to the peso fuerte, which was linked to the price <b>of</b> <b>gold.</b> <b>In</b> 1827 the peso papel was devalued by 33%, and was devalued again by 68% in 1829.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} rock {{inscriptions}} near the temple. The discovery of three granite pillars with inscriptions of grants {{made to the}} shrine led {{to the discovery of}} the temple itself. While one pillar contains an inscription recording the donation of ten kazhanchus (small balls) of gold by one Kirarpiriyan of Mahabalipuram in 858, another records the donation of 16 kazhanchus <b>of</b> <b>gold</b> <b>in</b> 813 for the maintenance of a lamp by a Brahmin woman named Vasanthanar. The third pillar has an inscription by Raja Raja Chola I. Apart from these, there are five other pillars with inscriptions by the Pallava kings Dantivarman I, Nandivarman III and Kambavarman, the Rashtrakuta king Krishna III and the Chola king Rajendra Chola III.|$|E

5|$|Under Grant's peace policy, wars between settlers, {{the federal}} army, and the American Indians had been {{decreasing}} from 101 {{per year in}} 1869 {{to a low of}} 15 per year in 1875. However, the discovery <b>of</b> <b>gold</b> <b>in</b> the Black Hills of the Dakota Territory and the completion of the Northern Pacific Railway, threatened to unravel Grant's peace policy, as white settlers encroached upon native land to mine for gold. Indian wars per year jumped up to 32 in 1876 and remained at 43 in 1877. One of the highest casualty Indian battles that took place in American history was at the Battle of Little Bighorn in 1876. Indian war casualties in Montana went from 5 in 1875, to 613 in 1876 and 436 in 1877.|$|E
5|$|With the {{discovery}} <b>of</b> <b>gold</b> <b>in</b> the area, gold rush brought miners to the area. In 1890, Willoughby Island in Glacier Bay {{was the scene}} of a meeting of the miners, which was followed by the establishment of the Berry mining district. In the 1890s, a salt mine was established at Bartlett Cove. Fox farms and a cannery were also established; however, the cannery was abandoned in 1935.|$|E

5|$|Artisans {{from across}} India were {{recruited}} to craft the props. The costumes {{were designed by}} Makhanlal and Company, and Delhi-based tailors skilled in zardozi embroidery stitched the Mughal costume. The footwear was ordered from Agra, the jewellery was made by goldsmiths in Hyderabad, the crowns were designed in Kolhapur, and blacksmiths from Rajasthan manufactured the armoury (which included shields, swords, spears, daggers, and armour). The zardozi on costumes were also stitched by designers from Surat. A statue of Lord Krishna, to which Jodhabai prayed, was made <b>of</b> <b>gold.</b> <b>In</b> the scenes involving an imprisoned Anarkali, real chains were placed on Madhubala. The battle sequence between Akbar and Salim reportedly featured 2,000 camels, 400 horses, and 8,000 troops, mainly from the Indian Army's Jaipur cavalry, 56th Regiment. Dilip Kumar has spoken of the intense heat during filming of the sequence in the desert of Rajasthan, wearing full armour.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of Justinian I's reign he had {{inherited}} a surplus 28,800,000 solidi (400,000 pounds <b>of</b> <b>gold)</b> <b>in</b> the imperial treasury from Anastasius I and Justin I. Under Justinian's rule, measures were taken to counter corruption in the provinces and to make tax collection more efficient. Greater administrative power was given to both {{the leaders of the}} prefectures and of the provinces, while power was taken away from the vicariates of the dioceses, of which a number were abolished. The overall trend was towards a simplification of administrative infrastructure. According to Brown (1971), the increased professionalization of tax collection did much to destroy the traditional structures of provincial life, as it weakened the autonomy of the town councils in the Greek towns. It has been estimated that before Justinian I's reconquests the state had an annual revenue of 5,000,000 solidi in AD 530, but after his reconquests, the annual revenue was increased to 6,000,000 solidi in AD 550.|$|E
5|$|By 1896, the {{government}} planned to pass policing responsibilities to the provincial authorities and ultimately close the force. With the discovery <b>of</b> <b>gold</b> <b>in</b> the Klondike, however, the force was redeployed to protect Canada's sovereignty {{over the region}} and to manage the influx of prospectors. The mounted police sent volunteers {{to fight in the}} Second Boer War, and in recognition were retitled the Royal North-West Mounted Police in 1904. The plans for closure were abandoned in the face of opposition from regional politicians. Large numbers of the police volunteered for military service during the First World War, {{and the future of the}} badly depleted force was once again in doubt. Towards the end of the war, however, fears grew about a potential Bolshevik conspiracy and the authorities tasked the mounted police to investigate the threat. In the aftermath of the violence of the Winnipeg General Strike, {{the government}} decided to amalgamate the force with the Dominion Police, to form the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in 1920.|$|E

5|$|Diego Velázquez, the {{governor}} of Cuba, was enthused by Hernández de Córdoba's report <b>of</b> <b>gold</b> <b>in</b> Yucatán. He organised a new expedition and placed his nephew Juan de Grijalva in command over his four ships. The small fleet left Cuba in April 1518, and made its first landfall upon the island of Cozumel, off {{the east coast of}} Yucatán. The Maya inhabitants of Cozumel fled the Spanish and would not respond to Grijalva's friendly overtures. The fleet then sailed south along the east coast of the peninsula. The Spanish spotted three large Maya cities along the coast, but Grijalva did not land at any of these and turned back north to loop around the north of the peninsula and sail down the west coast. At Campeche the Spanish tried to barter for water but the Maya refused, so Grijalva opened fire against the city with small cannon; the inhabitants fled, allowing the Spanish to take the abandoned city. Messages were sent with a few Maya who had been too slow to escape but the Maya remained hidden in the forest; the Spanish boarded their ships and continued along the coast.|$|E
5|$|Diego Velázquez, the {{governor}} of Cuba, was enthused by Hernández de Córdoba's report <b>of</b> <b>gold</b> <b>in</b> Yucatán. He organised a new expedition consisting of four ships and 260 men. He placed his nephew Juan de Grijalva in command. Francisco de Montejo, who would eventually conquer much of the peninsula, was captain {{of one of the}} ships,; Pedro de Alvarado and Alonso d'Avila captained the other ships. Bernal Díaz del Castillo served on the crew; he was able to secure a place on the expedition as a favour from {{the governor}}, who was his kinsman. Antón de Alaminos once again served as pilot. Governor Velázquez provided all four ships, in an attempt to protect his claim over the peninsula. The small fleet was stocked with crossbows, muskets, barter goods, salted pork and cassava bread. Grijalva also took one of the captured Indians from the Hernández expedition.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{reformed}} {{the system}} of silver coins in England in 1247, replacing the older Short Cross silver pennies with a new Long Cross design. Due to the initial costs of the transition, Henry required the financial help of his brother Richard to undertake this reform, but the recoinage occurred quickly and efficiently. Between 1243 and 1258, the King assembled two great hoards, or stockpiles, <b>of</b> <b>gold.</b> <b>In</b> 1257, Henry needed to spend the second of these hoards urgently and, rather than selling the gold quickly and depressing its value, Henry decided to introduce gold pennies into England, following the popular trend in Italy. The gold pennies resembled the gold coins issued by Edward the Confessor, but the overvalued currency attracted complaints from the City of London and was ultimately abandoned.|$|E
