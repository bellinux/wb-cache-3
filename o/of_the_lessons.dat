5|$|North American Aviation won the {{contract}} to build the CSM, and also {{the second stage of}} the Saturn V launch vehicle for NASA. Because the CSM design was started early before the selection of lunar orbit rendezvous, the service propulsion engine was sized to lift the CSM off of the Moon, and thus was oversized to about twice the thrust required for translunar flight. Also, there was no provision for docking with the Lunar Module. A 1964 program definition study concluded that the initial design should be continued as Block I which would be used for early testing, while Block II, the actual lunar spacecraft, would incorporate the docking equipment and take advantage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lessons</b> learned in Block I development.|$|E

After he broke Gehrig's record, the Orioles, along with private donors, created the Cal Ripken/Lou Gehrig Fund for Neuromuscular Research at Johns Hopkins University. Along {{with his brother}} Billy, he formed the Cal Ripken Sr., Foundation in 2001 to give underprivileged children the opportunity to attend baseball camps {{around the country and}} learn the game. The Foundation is a branch of Ripken Baseball. In addition to controlling these camps and Ripken's minor league teams, Ripken Baseball operates for-profit camps and designs ballfields for youth, college, and professional teams. He gives speeches about his time in baseball and some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lessons</b> he has learned. Between 2001 and 2004, inclusive, Ripken served as commissioner of the White House Tee Ball Initiative of President George W. Bush, in which capacity he worked to promote the value of teamwork amongst players and volunteership amongst the public and helped to teach tee ball fundamentals to teams of children at the White House.|$|E

Although it was possible to fit all these aircraft into the hangars, eight or nine were usually stored on the flight deck to reduce cramping below decks.|$|E

The second is to propose a new methodology for improvement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lesson,</b> namely, spiral PDCA cycle. This spiral PDCA cycle consists of decision of lesson type by learning outcome at the first stage, PDCA cycle for <b>the</b> <b>lesson</b> according to each quality formation at the second stage, and PDCA cycle with which <b>the</b> <b>lesson</b> is improved by examining and then looking down upon the difference between the relativized view on <b>the</b> <b>lesson,</b> upon which <b>the</b> practitioner depends, and other views on <b>the</b> <b>lesson</b> at <b>the</b> third stage...|$|R

Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) {{and the women}} of the office teach him how to {{interact}} with women. The lesson, which is taught by Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate), Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper), and Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith), goes nowhere, and they give up. Pam goes with Dwight to the White Pages, only to find out that the buyer is Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin). Jan was expecting to meet with CEO David Wallace, and reprimands her assistant for the confusion. Pam quickly realizes that the meeting was just a ruse to take revenge on David for firing her five years prior. However, Dwight remains determined to make the sale, so he has Pam stall while he gets Clark (Clark Duke), intuiting that Jan has an attraction to underage men due to her rumored affair with her 17-year-old former assistant Hunter. After he introduces Clark to her, Jan says she will think about it, and tells everyone to leave her office except Clark. As Pam and Dwight leave, Dwight offers a sympathetic comment to Jan's assistant (a woman).

25|$|The 1947 defence program {{witnessed}} {{the formation of}} the Australian Regular Army and included in the plans for a permanent field force was a number of new armoured formations—the 2nd Armoured Brigade Group (Independent) among them. Allocated to this independent brigade was 22nd Field Regiment, Royal Australian Artillery. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lessons</b> of the war in Europe had been the need for artillery units in armoured brigades to have the same mobility and protection as the tanks they were supporting, and consequently a program was begun to acquire a self-propelled gun.|$|E

Some of these trial maneuveres were conducted in the Soviet Union.

That lesson had undertaken an important duty in terms of understanding and explicating the Turkish Revolution. In 1933, “Ataturk’s Principles and History of Revolution” began to be taught methodically in universities by means of İnkılap Tarihi Enstitüsü (Institute of History of Revolution) founded as subsidiary of İstanbul University.
