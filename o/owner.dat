40|$|Introduction & Objective: Many Iranian {{families}} {{manage to}} keep pets at home. Examining psychological consequences and personality traits of pet <b>owners</b> is important. The {{aim of this}} study was to examine mental health status and personality traits of pet <b>owners.</b> Materials & Methods: In this descriptive study, 612 pet <b>owners</b> (143 cat <b>owners,</b> 162 dog <b>owners,</b> 155 bird <b>owners</b> and 152 other pet <b>owners)</b> were asked to complete General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) and IPIP Personality Scale from January to December 2006. Results: Bird <b>owners</b> had the highest (234 cases (38. 3 %)) and other pet <b>owners</b> had the lowest (129 cases (42. 3 %)) mental health problems. In general, 188 cases (30. 7 %) of all groups had mental health problems. 122 cases (20 %) of them had somatic compliance, 182 cases (29. 7 %) had anxiety, 149 cases (24. 3 %) had social dysfunction and 84 cases (13. 7 %) had depression. Bird <b>owners</b> had significant high level of social dysfunction than other pet <b>owners.</b> With respect to personality traits, dog <b>owners</b> had low level of agreeableness and openness to experience than other groups. Other pet <b>owners</b> had high level of emotional stability than other groups. Conclusion: Contrary to other countries, it seems that having a pet in home enhances the probability of mental disorders in Iran. It is possible that lower mental health persons were keeping pets in Iran. In personality perspectives, dog <b>owners</b> are more disagreeable people and other pet <b>owners</b> are more emotionally stable ones...|$|R
40|$|Prior {{work on the}} {{performance}} consequences of corporate diversification has treated all powerful <b>owners</b> as seeking the same benefits from diversification (i. e, higher profit rather than growth) and therefore limiting value appropriation by other stakeholders such as employees and managers. In contrast, we distinguish between domestic 2 ̆ 2 relational 2 ̆ 2 <b>owners</b> and foreign 2 ̆ 2 transactional 2 ̆ 2 <b>owners</b> in Japanese corporations. Although transactional <b>owners</b> do indeed prioritize profitability when diversifying, relational <b>owners</b> primarily seek growth rather than profits from diversification. Furthermore, relational <b>owners</b> also allow managers and employees to appropriate more of the rents arising from diversification than do transactional <b>owners...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Owners</b> of large-screen {{smartphones}} (phablets) {{are much}} more likely than <b>owners</b> of standard-size smartphones to frequently use multiple approaches to access news organization content on their smartphones, according to the latest Donald W. Reynolds Journalism Institute mobile media poll. The survey also found that smartphone <b>owners</b> between the ages of 18 and 44 were much more likely than older <b>owners</b> to frequently get news in multiple ways. Participants were asked to rank {{on a scale of one}} to five, with one equal to never and five equal to very frequently, how often they had used each of five common approaches to accessing news content on their smartphones in the week prior to taking the survey.   The five common approaches included in the survey were: Directly to news organization websites Directly to news organization content using their smartphone apps Indirectly through links provided by social media users Indirectly through links in e-mail messages Indirectly by stumbling onto news stories of interest while using smartphone for non-news activities Screen-size difference Fifty-four percent of phablet <b>owners</b> and 31 percent of standard smartphone <b>owners</b> said they had used two or more approaches. Twenty-seven percent of phablet <b>owners</b> and only nine percent of standard smartphone <b>owners</b> used four or more approaches. One-third (34 percent) of phablet <b>owners</b> and more than half (56 percent) of standard smartphone <b>owners</b> used none of the approaches. Age difference Sixty-one percent of all smartphone <b>owners</b> ages 18 to 44 and 25 percent of <b>owners</b> ages 45 or older said they used two or more approaches. Twenty-nine percent of all smartphone <b>owners</b> ages 18 to 44 and only seven percent of <b>owners</b> ages 45 or older used four or more approaches. Twenty-six percent of all smartphone <b>owners</b> ages 18 to 44 and 63 percent of <b>owners</b> ages 45 or older used none of the approaches. One-third of all smartphone <b>owners</b> surveyed said they had frequently or very frequently accessed news organization content indirectly either through social media links provided by friends or other users or just by stumbling onto news stories of interest while using their smartphone for non-news activities. The difference between phablet <b>owners</b> and standard smartphone <b>owners</b> was about 20 percentage points in each case. The age difference was even greater. Fifty-five percent of all smartphone <b>owners</b> ages 18 to 44 and 17 percent of <b>owners</b> ages 45 or older said they frequently or very frequently got news stories of interest indirectly from social media links. The percentages were about the same for <b>owners</b> who said they frequently or very frequently stumbled onto stories of interest. The results for all five approaches can be found in the slides above. In a follow-up question, participants were asked to rank their agreement with the statement that "The size of my smartphone's screen makes news easy to read. " As might be expected, two-thirds (67 percent) of phablet <b>owners</b> said they somewhat or strongly agreed as opposed to 29 percent for standard smartphone <b>owners.</b> The difference between the 18 to 44 and 45 or older age groups was about the same. This survey was conducted for RJI in June 2015 by Ipsos, one of the world's largest independent market research companies. It included 1, 001 adults from all 50 states who owned smartphones. Forty-one percent indicated that they had a large-screen smartphone (phablet). Tablets were used by 53 percent of phablet <b>owners</b> and 39 percent of standard smartphone <b>owners.</b> Personal computers (desktop or laptop) were used by 69 percent of phablet <b>owners</b> and 73 percent of standard smartphone <b>owners...</b>|$|R

The questionnaire was handed back by 57 dog <b>owners,</b> 31 <b>owners</b> from Nemanice and 26 <b>owners</b> from Stromovka. The questions concerned the dog origin, teaching of basic commands, training and the owners' reactions to situations provoked by the dog. The results show that the <b>owners</b> from Stromovka are more competent than the <b>owners</b> from Nemanice. Also the owners' reactions to common situations with the dog were more often correct in <b>owners</b> from Stromovka than in those from Nemanice...|$|R

40|$|Many pet <b>owners</b> are {{convinced}} of the beneficiary health effects animals can have on their <b>owners,</b> however scientific evidence {{still seems to be}} inconclusive on the matter. Do pets really make their <b>owners</b> more healthy or are these assertions simply wishful thinking? This study researched the effects of pet ownership in the Netherlands by measuring physical and mental health. 466 participants were gathered through an online questionnaire and the respondents were divided in two groups: pet <b>owners</b> (n= 255) and non pet <b>owners</b> (n= 211). The group ‘Pet owners’ comprised dog <b>owners</b> and cat <b>owners.</b> The questionnaire was composed of questions such as doctor visits, drug use and sick leave to measure physical health and used the validated Mental Health Continuum: Short-Form by Lamers et al.

In general cat <b>owners</b> seemed to be in worse health than dog <b>owners,</b> implicating that it might depend on the species of the animal whether or not an <b>owners</b> might benefit from it. Based on these results and an elaborate literature study suggestions were made for future research...|$|R
