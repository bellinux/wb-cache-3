25|$|After a delay for wet field conditions, {{the third}} day began with a flurry of action, as both Justin Langer and Matthew Hayden had close calls with lbw appeals, which replays {{suggested}} should have been out, and shies at the stumps that just missed. However, no batsman was given <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> session, where only 14 overs of play was possible due to rain. Australia added 45 runs in that time.|$|E
25|$|The {{fifth day}} {{did not hold}} much enthusiasm as the {{scorecards}} might suggest, as India took off from where they started, from 362/6. India's tail wagged as they put on 47 runs {{for the loss of}} 4 wickets. Ajit Agarkar was the first man to be <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> to Andy Bichel, and then he was followed by Parthiv Patel, whose ill-fated, top-edged hook was caught by a diving Bichel off Gillespie. The two batsmen departed without India adding any run to their score. At 362/8, Zaheer Khan and Harbhajan Singh had a fine outing with the bat. Zaheer swatted a six and three boundaries in his 27 and Harbhajan hit 19 in his own inimitable fashion, as India pushed along to 409. They had obtained a lead of 86– a rarity in Australia against Australia itself. Moreover, this achievement was significant because India were written off before the match even began.|$|E

25|$|The A38(M) {{motorway}} (also {{known as}} the Aston Expressway) in Birmingham, England. The road connects the city centre with Spaghetti Junction on the M6. It is a 2-mile, 7-lane section of motorway with no central reservation, and a lower than usual speed limit of 50mph. Constructed in 1971, it was the United Kingdom's first contraflow road. Overhead lane control signals allow for 4 lanes in and 2 <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> rush hour, reversed in the evening, and 3 lanes each way at all other times. One dividing lane is closed to traffic at all times, and motorcycles are permanently prohibited from using the central, red-surfaced lane (with a fixed sign) owing to its use as an off-camber drain. The lane control signals can be set to allow travel in either direction for any lane in exceptional circumstances, which {{has been used for}} single-lane, reduced-speed running in each direction (or 2+1 with no divider) during road work, allowing the expressway to remain largely open even during major repairs. However, the 7-lane section splits at both ends to fully divided sets of 4x2 lane slip roads, with the central red lane ending in a barrier, so full use of this flexibility is uncommon and occasional overnight closure is required.|$|E
25|$|As in the First and Fourth Tests Australia {{were left}} to improve a large first innings lead and set England a target with a declaration. Rick McCosker was caught by wicketkeeper off Arnold on 16/1, but there were few other {{problems}} for the home side who ended the day on 111/2. England could have taken more wickets as Fletcher and Cowdrey both dropped Ian Chappell, who hit Underwood for six, then made an indecisive drive-sweep that skied the ball to Knott for 41. In the intervening rest day the players were invited to the Barossa Valley vineyard of 'Windy' Hill-Smith, where Jeff Thomson sprained his shoulder playing tennis. The following day he found {{that he could not}} raise his bowling arm and that he was out of cricket {{for the rest of the}} series, having taken a remarkable 33 wickets (17.93) in four and a half Tests. To balance the books Bob Willis was also out for the rest of the series with his recurring knee cap injury. Redpath and Greg Chappell lasted the day, but were both <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> to Underwood (4/102) to leave Australia 133/4 as only 24 runs were scored in the first 12 overs of the day. Doug Walters (71 not out) and Rod Marsh (55) were more aggressive and took 10 runs off one Underwood over. Marsh swept the spinner, once for six, twice to see Knott spill a running catch and third to be caught by Greig. Chappell waited for a few more overs before declaring at 272/5, 404 runs ahead with 500 minutes of play left, very similar to the situation at Sydney.|$|E
25|$|Despite the England {{collapse}} {{the pitch}} was losing its moisture and looked better for runs. Colin McDonald and Neil Harvey saw the day out with 96/1 {{for the loss}} of Jim Burke, bowled by Statham for 3 when he left the ball alone. Lacking the pace of the Australian bowlers Statham and Loader could not make the ball lift as they had done and Trevor Bailey and Jim Laker suffered as Harvey struck 10 fours in his 60 not out by the end of New Year's Day. They returned to the fray the following morning with May setting only one slip as he tried to stop the flow of runs, which saved Harvey when he edged to the vacant second slip on 67. Bailey bowled down the leg side with a leg field while Harvey watched the balls go by, but he and McDonald were able to run quickly between the wickets and keep the score ticking over, but only 39 runs were made off 18 eight–ball overs before lunch. Soon after the break Tom Graveney took a juggled catch at first slip off Statham to dismiss McDonald for 47 after four hours. Norm O'Neill came into a defensive field to Tony Lock bowling round the wicket and found it difficult to make runs, but tried one cracking drive that was stopped by the bowler and hurt his hand. Harvey tok 267 minutes to make his century, but there was a huge roar round the giant Melbourne Ground when he reached three figures. With his hundred up he attacked Laker and Lock, but with tight fields and accurate bowling he was unable to get away. The new ball was taken after tea and Statham had O'Neill (37) caught behind trying a powerful stroke off his back foot. Peter Loader, who had been plundered for 36 runs in 8 overs bowled Harvey (167) when he missed an on–drive. Considering the quality and the accuracy of the bowling Alec Bedser thought this was Harvey's best century and it was greatly appreciated by the 71,000 crowd. They could not have enjoyed what followed as Bobby Simpson and Richie Benaud went for ducks and Australia crashed from 255/2 to 262/6. Ken Mackay (18) and Alan Davidson (25) pulled the score to 282/6 {{by the end of the}} day, but Statham (7/57) had them <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> then cleaned up tail for 308. He became only the sixth England bowler to take seven wickets in a Test innings in Australia after Tom Richardson (8/94), George Lohmann (8/35 and 8/58), Wilfred Rhodes (7/56 and 8/68), Doug Wright (7/105) and Frank Tyson (7/27). Once again Neil Harvey had scored over half the innings for Australia, but they were only 49 runs ahead.|$|E

500|$|Two more relief {{parties were}} mustered to {{evacuate}} any adults who {{might still be}} alive. [...] Both turned back before getting to Bear Valley, and no further attempts were made. On April 10, almost a month since the third relief had left Truckee Lake, the alcalde near Sutter's Fort organized a salvage party to recover what they could of the Donners' belongings. [...] The belongings would be sold, with part of the proceeds used to support the orphaned Donner children. The salvage party found the Alder Creek tents empty except for the body of George Donner, who had died only days earlier. On {{their way back to}} Truckee Lake, they found Lewis Keseberg alive. According to him, Mrs. Murphy had died a week after the departure of the third relief. Some weeks later, Tamsen Donner had arrived at his cabin on her way over the pass, soaked and visibly upset. Keseberg said that he put a blanket around her and told her to start <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> but she died during the night.|$|E

2500|$|Throughout the night, {{in front}} of their {{position}} on John's Knoll, the Australians had detected the movement of the Japanese force, and in the early morning a patrol was sent <b>out.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> haze, the two groups briefly clashed, and then the Japanese artillery pieces and machine guns opened up. Two companies, equaling roughly 200 men, attacked the position in the first wave under the cover of heavy mortar fire. The main assault fell on John's Ridge, which was being held by an understrength platoon, commanded by Lieutenant Bob Johns. Assisted by clear fields of fire and the defensive qualities of their position, the Australian platoon was able to hold off the first assault and fighting continued throughout the day, with several attacks going in, before the Japanese assault was pushed back. [...] At the height of the assault, the Australian brigade commander– Dougherty– approved a withdrawal, but the 2/27th's commanding officer, Bishop, determined that a counter-attack might restore the situation. Amidst heavy rain, the Australians counter-attacked with two platoons hitting the Japanese flanks. This allowed reinforcements to be pushed through to John's Knoll in the early evening. With ammunition running dangerously low for the Australian defenders, supplies were hurriedly pushed forward during the early morning, being brought up by native carriers across the Faria River. Casualties for the Australians amounted to seven killed and 28 wounded, while Japanese losses were 200 killed.|$|E

2500|$|Some of {{the oldest}} grade clubs in Australia are in Tasmania, {{but it was a}} weak state side that would not fully {{complete}} in the Sheffield Shield for another 25 years. Freddie Brown took a holiday in Victoria, Len Hutton went on a cruise to Sydney and Doug Wright took a break as well. Alec Bedser's identical twin brother Eric was in Australia on business (they were inseparable and lived together for 90 years) and was asked to help the MCC rest some of its players after the injuries and fatigue of the Third Test. Alec and Eric tossed a coin in their youth to see who would remain a fast bowler so that they could both get into the Surrey Colts, Eric lost and became an opening batsman and off-spinner. As always the Tasmanians were delighted to meet the MCC team and their stay on the island was always regarded as the most pleasant part of the tour. Tom Davidson won the toss for Tasmania, but they batted haphazardly towards 197 as John Warr (4/47) and Alec Bedser (4/56) worked their way through the team. The hero of the day was Keith Dollery (3/30), [...] "a fast-medium bowler who bowls with his cap on and touches the ground for luck with his finger before he takes off" [...] who removed the MCC openers David Sheppard and John Dewes and was carried off the field by his team-mates as the tourists were struggled to 18/2 at stumps. He had nightwatchman Godfrey Evans <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> for 28/3, but Reg Simpson (28), captain Denis Compton (41), Cyril Washbrook (61) and Alec Bedser (35) righted the ship and the MCC made 234, a lead of 42 runs. Tasmania did better second time round and reached 209/4 with Compton disappearing for 2/72 off 11 overs before Alec Bedser (4/30) and Warr (3/39) finished off the tail and the last six wickets fell for 20 runs. This left the MCC 187 runs to win in 135 minutes. This was achieved thanks to Sheppard (67 not out), Simpson (43) and Compton (77 not out), who hit the last six balls to the boundary before an enthusiastic crowd.|$|E
2500|$|Ian Redpath (21) and Rick McCosker (35) {{upset the}} England plans by adding 52 in 83 {{minutes for the}} first wicket. Geoff Arnold made the ball cut and lift immediately, but Bob Willis {{struggled}} and after six overs Derek Underwood replaced Arnold, who changed ends so as to {{have the advantage of}} the wind behind him. [...] "Deadly Derek" [...] (7/113) was called an umbrella bowler – there in case of a rain-affected wicket – {{and he was able to}} make the ball leap and turn from his first over. The openers managed to survive, and by surviving most of the first session they ensured that the Australian middle order would be able to play on a less lethal wicket. Denness failed to bring on Fred Titmus at the other end until the last over before lunch in conditions tailor made for spin bowling, a decision for which he was greatly criticised though E.W. Swanton thought the damps patches were not on Titmus's length. As it was Underwood had to do all the work, bowling 29 overs compared to 31 by the other five bowlers. He achieved the breakthrough when McCosker clipped a ball to Cowdrey in the slips, then both Chappell brothers, Ian was surprised by a leaping ball and skyed it to Knott, while Greg was lbw to a ball that turned from leg to middle stump while he tried to run a leg-bye. With the last ball before lunch Redpath edged the ball the Greig at silly-point and Australia were 77/4. After lunch Marsh tried to hit Underwood out of the attack, but was taken by Greig at mid-wicket at 84/5 with the Kent bowler having taken all the wickets 5/35. The South Australian sun was now drying out the wicket, which reverted to its normal, placid self in the afternoon. The brilliant Doug Walters hit 55 off 66 balls with 7 fours and a six, adding 80 with Terry Jenner who made his only Test fifty on his home ground. Titmus replaced Underwood just as the pitch was losing its turn and Walters was getting into his stride. The Australian batsmen took 24 runs off two overs and Walters's six was caught one handed in the member's stand. The tired Underwood was brought back as his left arm spin could not be hit so easily and Walters spooned a catch to a surprised Willis at mid-off. The tall Max Walker had yet to fail in the series and hit 41, adding 77 with Jenner until the latter became Underwood's seventh successive wicket when he misjudged the flight and hit over a ball. Walker hit what looked like an easy two only to end up at the same end as Lillee while Denness threw down the stumps after a fine pick up. Lillee walked to keep Walker in until Amiss insisted that Walker was the man to go and the umpire agreed. Lillee (26) added 36 with Mallett (23 not out) and hooked Willis for four until the new ball was taken. Willis then spread Lillee's stumps and Arnold those of Thomson and Australia were out for 304, the mystery being why they had not been <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> such a poor wicket.|$|E
