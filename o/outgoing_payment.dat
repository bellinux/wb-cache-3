50|$|Once {{a current}} account has been opened with a new bank or {{building}} society, the Current Account Switch Service will transfer all the activity relating to the old account to the new one. That includes moving incoming and <b>outgoing</b> <b>payments,</b> and transferring the account balance, as well as closing the old account. An important feature of the service is that though the process happens over seven working days, the transfer of account happens on the final day. This means that customers continue to use the old bank account until the agreed switch day {{and from then on}} use the new bank account. This means that there is no loss of service for any period for the customer.|$|R

Interbank real time settlement system in Romania is structured in order to be compatible with similar infrastructures in the European Union member states, Single Euro Payments Area. Payments handling will be simplified as all incoming and <b>outgoing</b> <b>payments</b> will use the same format. By providing new payment instruments and common interoperable infrastructures, SEPA will bring about further European integration and market efficiency.

50|$|A {{positive}} {{working capital}} cycle balances incoming and <b>outgoing</b> <b>payments</b> to minimize {{net working capital}} and maximize free cash flow. For example, a company that pays its suppliers in 30 days but takes 60 days to collect its receivables has a working capital cycle of 30 days. This 30-day cycle usually needs to be funded through a bank operating line, and the interest on this financing is a carrying cost that reduces the company's profitability. Growing businesses require cash, {{and being able to}} free up cash by shortening the working capital cycle is the most inexpensive way to grow. Sophisticated buyers review closely a target's working capital cycle because it provides them with an idea of the management's effectiveness at managing their balance sheet and generating free cash flows.|$|R
40|$|A recent {{innovation}} in large-value payments systems {{has been the}} design and implementation of liquidity-saving mechanisms (LSMs), tools {{used in conjunction with}} real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems. LSMs give system participants, such as banks, an option not offered by RTGS alone: they can queue their <b>outgoing</b> <b>payments.</b> Queued payments are released if some prespecified event occurs. LSMs can reduce the amount of central bank balances necessary to operate a payments system as well as quicken settlement. This article analyzes the performance of RTGS systems with and without the addition of an LSM. The authors find that, in terms of settling payments early, these mechanisms typically outperform pure RTGS systems. However, there are times when RTGS systems can be preferable to LSMs, such as when many banks that send payments early in RTGS choose to queue their payments when an LSM is available. The authors also show that the design of a liquidity-saving mechanism has important implications for the welfare of system participants, {{even in the absence of}} payment netting. In particular, the parameters specified determine whether the addition of an LSM increases or decreases welfare. Payment systems; Banks and banking, Central; Bank liquidity...|$|R

30|$|A social {{accounting}} matrix is simply {{defined as a}} single-entry accounting system whereby each macroeconomic account is represented by a column for <b>outgoings</b> (<b>payments)</b> and a row for incomings (receipts) (Hayden and Round 1982). It is represented {{in the form of}} a square matrix with rows and columns, which brings together data on production, income generation, consumption, investment and external transaction. In a SAM, incomings are indicated as receipts for the row accounts in which they are located and outgoings are indicated as expenditure for their column accounts. Since all incomings must be, in a SAM, accounted for the outgoings, the total of rows and columns must be equal for each account. Taylor and Adelman (1996) sees the SAM as a tabular presentation of the accounting identities, stating that incomings must be equal to outgoings for all sectors of the economy.|$|R

Approximately 60 % of the 184 firms surveyed hedge their FX exposures, and about 88 % of their exports are hedged. Most exporters use natural hedging, i. e. they balance incoming and <b>outgoing</b> <b>payments</b> in foreign currency as well as foreign currency assets and liabilities. Hedgers on financial markets prefer forwards and zero-cost option structures, as they are reluctant to pay option premiums. The typical maturity of financial instruments is three months to one year.

40|$|When {{settling}} {{their own}} liabilities {{and those of}} their clients, settlement banks rely on incoming payments to fund {{a part of their}} <b>outgoing</b> <b>payments.</b> We investigate their behaviour in CHAPS, the United Kingdom’s large-value payment system. Our estimates suggest that in normal times, banks increase their payment outflows when their liquidity is above target and immediately following the receipt of payments. We use these estimates to determine the robustness of this payment system to two hypothetical behavioural changes. In the first, a single bank stops sending payments, perhaps because of an operational problem. In the second, it pays out exactly what it previously received, relying exclusively on the liquidity provided by other system members. Using the observed uncertainty around our estimated behavioural equations, we derive probabilistic statements about the time at which the bank’s counterparties would run out of liquidity if they followed their estimated normal-time behaviour.

40|$|Under a {{real-time}} {{gross settlement}} (RTGS) system, {{there is an}} incentive for system participants to delay making their <b>outgoing</b> <b>payments</b> to facili-tate their funding, and this creates the risk of settlement delays spreading throughout the entire system. Intraday credit facility and market practices have been established to avoid the risk and led to settlement concen-tration in the morning, as well as concentrations at the specific times due to other deferred net settlement (DNS) systems. The heterogeneity of intraday progress of settlements causes intraday fluctuation in interest rates. In this paper, we analyze and run simulations on the payment net-work to understand the intraday flow of funds within Japan’s interbank money market, especially recycling of the “receipt-driven payments. ” We find that (1) {{the shape of the}} payment network changes with the time of day, and payment recycling becomes more likely when the density of the network is high; (2) patterns of intraday payment flow differ across the three RTGS systems of the United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan, reflecting differences in each country’s system for, and underlying approach to, settlement and funding; and (3) participants comprising the hub of the payment network function as absorbers of contagion under a condition sufficiently stressful to cause a cascade of settlement delays...|$|R

40|$|Our {{foreign trade}} is at present badly disrupted. A tariff crisis is today {{strangling}} international trade. Domestic farm prices show the consequences. In agriculture bankruptcy has become well-nigh universal. At {{the same time}} our debtors abroad, both public and private, are forced to default. The loss of the foreign markets, moreover, has destroyed the fundamental balance between agriculture and industry in our national economic life. There are, however, several correctives at work mending the fabric of foreign trade. But {{it is important to}} observe that the burden of these correctives falls with ruthless severity upon the American farmer. In substance, the adjustments now taking place in foreign trade are simply reducing the exports of commodities from the United States enough to balance our international incoming and <b>outgoing</b> <b>payments</b> to fit our creditor position. What, then, can be done to relieve this undue pressure on American agriculture? This circular is essentially an examination of the only principal alternative, namely, the lowering of our tariff wall.

40|$|Intraday {{liquidity}} risk {{is a subject}} that applies to all banks, and arises whenever there is a timing mismatch between incoming and <b>outgoing</b> <b>payments</b> within a business day. In case such a mismatch occurs, the bank is exposed to the risk that it is unable to meet its payment obligations at the time expected. A liquidity buffer could help to mitigate this risk. This thesis presents a framework for intraday {{liquidity risk}} management within ABN AMRO Bank, while taking different priorities of transactions into account. We examine the use of extreme value theory (EVT) and propose two metrics to capture the risk: the univariate and multivariate risk metric. The univariate risk metric represents {{the size of the}} liquidity buffer for each priority group separately and provides granular view. Making use of a Monte Carlo simulation algorithm in combination with univariate EVT, we are able to estimate the size of the liquidity buffer for a specified time interval within a business day. We forecast the buffer size 30 days out-of-sample and test the violations against the conditional coverage (CC) hypothesis. Satisfactory results are obtained for the groups with high and moderate priority when the highest confidence levels are considered: α = 0. 1 and 0. 05. For the group with low priority, the risk metric performs well for the lowest confidence levels: α = 0. 025 and 0. 01. The multivariate risk metrics aggregates the size of the liquidity buffer, while taking the diversification of the priority groups into account. We define a failure set and investigate the use of multivariate EVT. Applied Mathematic...|$|R
40|$|Real-time gross {{settlement}} (RTGS) {{systems such as}} CHAPS Sterling require large amounts of liquidity to support payment activity. To meet their liquidity needs, RTGS participants borrow from the central bank or rely on incoming payments from other participants. Both options can prove costly [...] the latter in particular if participants delay <b>outgoing</b> <b>payments</b> until incoming ones arrive. This article presents an empirical analysis of the timing and funding of payments in CHAPS. The authors seek to identify the factors driving the intraday profile of payment activity {{and the extent to}} which incoming funds are used as a funding source, a process known as liquidity recycling. They show that the level of liquidity recycling in CHAPS is high and stable throughout the day, and attribute this result to several features of the system. First, the settlement of time-critical payments provides liquidity to the system early in the settlement day; this liquidity can be recycled for the funding of less urgent payments. Second, CHAPS throughput guidelines provide a centralised coordination mechanism, in effect limiting any tendency toward payment delay. Third, the relatively small direct membership of CHAPS facilitates coordination between members, for example, through the use of bilateral net sender limits. Coordination encourages banks to maintain a relatively constant flux of payments throughout the day. The authors also argue that the high level of recycling helps to reduce liquidity risk, and that the relatively smooth intraday distribution of payments serves to mitigate operational risk associated with highly concentrated payment activity. They note, however, that the benefits of liquidity recycling are not evenly distributed between members of CHAPS. Payment systems; Bank liquidity; Risk; Electronic funds transfers...|$|R
40|$|No two crises are identical. As {{we learn}} from them, they evolve and change. This thesis {{is an attempt to}} {{understand}} some of their features. We discuss the abandonment of a peg (Chapter 2), full disruption of payments (Chapter 3) and illiquidity in one-sided markets (Chapter 4). Chapter 2 investigates the consequences of introducing uncertainty about the willingness of a central bank to defend the peg in an economy in which a government runs a persistent deficit. We analyze how not knowing when other arbitrageurs intend to attack a currency affects investors' decision to attack. Specifically, we show how the lack of common knowledge induces arbitrageurs to delay their attack on the currency, which in turn leads to a discrete devaluation of the exchange rate as it is generally observed during currency crises. In Chapter 3 we examine how financial integration of payment systems creates a feedback channel which might threaten the stability of financial markets. In payment systems, banks rely heavily on incoming transfers to finance <b>outgoing</b> <b>payments</b> requiring a high degree of coordination and synchronization. We study the response of the payment system to disruptions in payments and to changes in the precautionary demand for liquid balances targeted by the different institutions in a payment system. This work aims to shed light on the recent events in credit markets. The analysis of liquidity in one-sided markets is the focus of Chapter 4. When a market is in distress, liquidity typically vanishes playing {{a key role in the}} build-up of one-sided markets. We present an alternative view of market liquidity which results from a tradeoff between market externalities and a congestion effect. When congestion is the dominating effect, as during fire sales, diminishing market frictions can deteriorate liquidity and reduce welfare. Our results provide a rationale for circuit breakers...|$|R

25|$|In {{its role}} as the central bank of the United States, the Fed serves as a banker's bank and as the government's bank. As the banker's bank, it helps to assure the safety and {{efficiency}} of the payments system. As the government's bank or fiscal agent, the Fed processes a variety of financial transactions involving trillions of dollars. Just as an individual might keep an account at a bank, the U.S. Treasury keeps a checking account with the Federal Reserve, through which incoming federal tax deposits and <b>outgoing</b> government <b>payments</b> are handled. As part of this service relationship, the Fed sells and redeems U.S. government securities such as savings bonds and Treasury bills, notes and bonds. It also issues the nation's coin and paper currency. The U.S. Treasury, through its Bureau of the Mint and Bureau of Engraving and Printing, actually produces the nation's cash supply and, in effect, sells the paper currency to the Federal Reserve Banks at manufacturing cost, and the coins at face value. The Federal Reserve Banks then distribute it to other financial institutions in various ways. During the Fiscal Year 2013, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing delivered 6.6 billion notes at an average cost of 5.0 cents per note.|$|R
30|$|Longinidis and Georgiadis (2011) {{evaluate}} the financial {{performance of a}} company-wide multi-product, multi-period supply chain network with four echelons by maximizing the economic value added (EVA). With respect to a given dividend payout ratio during the time periods, they determine the associated design of the supply chain network including the numbers, locations and capacities of warehouses and distribution centers {{to be set up}} as well as transportation links to be established. The total invested capital is defined as the sum of shareholders’ equity as well as short- and long-term liabilities. To avoid misinterpretations with respect to risk consideration within the WACC rate that is commonly used for calculating EVA, Hahn and Kuhn (2012 a) assume an externally predefined hurdle rate to calculate the capital charge. Within their model, applicable to a make-to-stock supply chain in the consumer goods industry with single-stage production, they use an objective based on EVA, which allows for integrated performance and risk optimization. As a consequence, material flows and financial flows are optimized simultaneously within the time periods of the mid-term planning horizon. The cash position resulting from operations, open items management, financial management (short-term investments and short-term borrowing at fixed interest rates) and exogenous cash flows (including dividend payouts) is balanced within each period. With regard to long-term planning, Hahn and Kuhn (2012 b) refer to the market value added (MVA), which represents the multi-annual extension of the EVA concept, as it can be calculated as the sum of WACC-discounted EVA values up to the planning horizon. However, the aforementioned measures consider the profit that remains after accounting for the return expectations of the investors. Koberstein et al. (2013) propose an objective function of a weighted sum of the expected NPV of the profits and an additional conditional value at risk measure for their integrated strategic planning of global production networks. A company-specific interest rate (such as WACC) is used to compute the discounted cash flows. Their two-stage stochastic mixed-integer programming model, which takes uncertain exchange rates and product demands into account, includes strategic investment decisions as well as decisions on production and transportation quantities. The usage of financial instruments focuses on forward contacts and options. Sahling and Kayser (2016) use the combined maximization of the expected NPV and the conditional value of risk for strategic supply planning with vendor selection. The configuration of the three-layer supply network includes decisions on the selection of production facilities, the assignment of products to facilities, the selection of vendors for delivery of components and the assignment of retailers to production facilities. The considered cash flows include incoming and <b>outgoing</b> <b>payments,</b> e.g., for establishing, closing and running production facilities, installing tools at facilities, fulfilling demand at retailers, acquiring and transporting components as well as processing and transporting end products, which are discounted by a period-specific internal interest rate that is derived from WACC.|$|R
