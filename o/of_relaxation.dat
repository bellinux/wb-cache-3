40|$|Boosting {{algorithms}} build highly accurate prediction mechanisms from {{a collection}} of low-accuracy predictors. To do so, they employ the notion of weak-learnability. The starting point {{of this paper is}} a proof which shows that weak learnability is equivalent to linear separability with ℓ 1 margin. The equivalence is a direct consequence of von Neumann’s minimax theorem. Nonetheless, we derive the equivalence directly using Fenchel duality. We then use our derivation to describe a family <b>of</b> <b>relaxations</b> to the weak-learnability assumption that readily translates to a family <b>of</b> <b>relaxations</b> <b>of</b> linear separability with margin. This alternative perspective sheds new light on known soft-margin boosting algorithms and also enables us to derive several new <b>relaxations</b> <b>of</b> the notion of linear separability. Last, we describe and analyze an efficient boosting framework {{that can be used for}} minimizing the loss functions derived from our family <b>of</b> <b>relaxations.</b> In particular, we obtain efficient boosting algorithms for maximizing hard and soft versions of the ℓ 1 margin. ...|$|R

By projecting these polyhedra we obtain new valid inequalities for the problem, and in particular complete descriptions for 1 -regular problems partially studied by Balas (1985) and Posner (1986).

While many authors refer to the adverse effect <b>of</b> stress <b>relaxation</b> on excavation stability, some present compelling empirical evidence indicating that stress relaxation does not have a significant effect. Establishing clear definitions <b>of</b> stress <b>relaxation</b> was critical to understanding and quantifying stress <b>relaxation</b> <b>of</b> the various types that have been referred to in the literature. This paper defines three types <b>of</b> stress <b>relaxation</b> – partial relaxation, full relaxation and tangential relaxation. Once clear definitions were determined, {{it became clear that the}} theoretical arguments and empirical evidence presented by various authors to support their respective cases are not contradictory; rather, the different conclusions can be attributed to different types <b>of</b> stress <b>relaxation.</b> In particular, when the minor principal stress is negative the intermediate principal stress has been identified as significantly affecting jointed rock mass behaviour. The aim of the study was to review and evaluate existing methods of quantifying the effect <b>of</b> stress <b>relaxation</b> around underground excavations and, if necessary, propose a new set of recommendations. An empirical stope stability model, that has been termed the Extended Mathews stability chart, was considered to be the most appropriate method of quantifying the effects <b>of</b> stress <b>relaxation.</b> A new set of guidelines to account for the effect <b>of</b> stress <b>relaxation</b> on excavation stability in the Extended Mathews stability chart has been proposed from a back-analysis of 55 case histories <b>of</b> stress <b>relaxation...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The main {{drawbacks}} of sequential pattern mining {{have been}} {{its lack of}} focus on user expectations and {{the high number of}} discovered patterns. However, the solution commonly accepted – the use of constraints – approximates the mining process to a verification of what are the frequent patterns among the specified ones, instead of the discovery of unknown and unexpected patterns. In this paper, we propose a new methodology to mine sequential patterns, keeping the focus on user expectations, without compromising the discovery of unknown patterns. Our methodology is based on the use <b>of</b> constraint <b>relaxations,</b> and it consists on using them to filter accepted patterns during the mining process. We propose a hierarchy <b>of</b> <b>relaxations,</b> applied to constraints expressed as context-free languages, classifying the existing relaxations (legal, valid and naïve, previously proposed), and proposing several new classes <b>of</b> <b>relaxations.</b> The new classes range from the approx and non-accepted, to the composition of different types <b>of</b> <b>relaxations,</b> like the approx-legal or the nonprefix-valid relaxations. Finally, we present a case study that shows the results achieved with the application of this methodology to the analysis of the curricular sequences of computer science students. ...|$|R

25|$|Decay {{times of}} the excitation, {{typically}} measured in seconds, depend on the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>relaxation,</b> which is faster for lighter nuclei and in solids, and slower for heavier nuclei and in solutions, {{and they can be}} very long in gases. If the second excitation pulse is sent prematurely before the relaxation is complete, the average magnetization vector has not decayed to ground state, which affects the strenght of the signal in an unpredictable manner. In practice, the peak areas are then not proportional to the stoichiometry; only the presence, but not the amount of functional groups is possible to discern. An inversion recovery experiment can be done to determine the relaxation time and thus the required delay between pulses. A 180° pulse, an adjustable delay, and a 90° pulse is transmitted. When the 90° pulse exactly cancels out the signal, the delay corresponds to the time needed for 90° <b>of</b> <b>relaxation.</b> Inversion recovery is worthwhile for quantitive 13C, 2D and other time-consuming experiments.|$|E
