In general, a worker's learning effect on a job depends not only <b>on</b> <b>the</b> total processing time of <b>the</b> <b>jobs</b> that he has processed but also <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>job's</b> position.

Based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> above observations, we introduce in this paper a position-weighted learning effect model based on sum-of-logarithm-processing-times and job position for scheduling problems. We provide optimal solutions for the single-machine problems to minimize the makespan and the total completion time, and for the single-machine problem to minimize the sum of weighted completion times, the maximum lateness, and the total tardiness under an agreeable situation. We also solve two special cases of the flowshop problem under the learning model. Department of Logistics and Maritime Studie...|$|R
