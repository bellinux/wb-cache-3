5|$|The anterolabial {{cingulum}} and anteroconid {{are both}} absent on m3. The mesolophid is usually absent. As in m2, {{there are two}} roots at the front in A.donovani and <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> A.praeuniversitatis, but the front roots are usually fused in A.donovani.|$|E
5|$|A {{squadron}} of three galleys under Antonio Diedo arrived {{to reinforce the}} city on 17 March, but to little avail. A muster of the city's available defenders showed that they sufficed to man <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> two or three crenelles, and they were deficient in both armament and morale: news of Murad's approach {{at the head of}} an army rumoured to number 190,000 men caused widespread terror among the populace.|$|E

While America never lacked for real trees, {{the time and}} expense of retrieving them from the wild was significant. Early in the twentieth century, however, Christmas tree farms began supplying large metropolitan areas with real trees. In the 1920s, real trees became commonplace, supplanting artificial trees in American homes.|$|E
5|$|In 1928, {{an officer}} {{working at the}} station was sacked after it was {{revealed}} he had been gathering bribes from local nightclubs and brothels, acquiring over £17,000 (now £) in the process.

5000|$|Mair was {{recruited}} {{to play with}} the <b>Only</b> <b>Ones</b> <b>in</b> 1976, after he answered an advertisement in Melody Maker for an audition with Roger Chapman's band Streetwalkers. The <b>Only</b> <b>Ones</b> were <b>in</b> the rehearsal room next door. The <b>Only</b> <b>Ones</b> included lead vocalist Peter Perrett, guitarist John Perry and drummer and ex-Spooky Tooth member Mike Kellie. Their first single, [...] "Lovers of Today", was self-released on the Vengeance record label, and a year later they signed to CBS. Their next single [...] "Another Girl, Another Planet" [...] became the band's best-known song. The band released The <b>Only</b> <b>Ones</b> <b>in</b> 1978, which was well received. The next year they released Even Serpents Shine, and a year later, they released their final studio album, Baby's Got a Gun. In the summer of 1980, they supported the Who on their tour of the United States. In 1982, the band officially disbanded. In subsequent years, The <b>Only</b> <b>Ones</b> gained a cult following, and compilation albums now outnumber their official studio albums.|$|R

5|$|Most of the {{soldiers}} {{of the task force}} were teenagers with no combat experience and only eight weeks of basic training. Only one third of the officers in the task force had combat experience from World War II, and <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> six enlisted soldiers had combat experience. Many of them nevertheless volunteered to join the task force. The soldiers were each equipped with only 120 rounds of ammunition and two days of C-rations.|$|E
5|$|<b>Only</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> five Croatian Jews {{survived the}} Holocaust of World War II. Between 1948 and 1952, nearly {{one half of}} the {{surviving}} members of Jewish Community of Zagreb opted for emigration to Israel, and the community dropped to one-tenth of its pre-war membership. The Yugoslav communist regime nationalized virtually all real estate owned by the Jewish Community of Zagreb, including the plot in Praška Street. All this, combined with the new regime's general hostility toward religion, made reconstruction of the synagogue nearly impossible.|$|E
