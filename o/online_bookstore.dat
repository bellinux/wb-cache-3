To accomplish this feat, several plot devices were used to increase Lonnie's abilities. To justify the character's financial independence, Anarky was described as {{using the internet to}} earn money through his <b>online</b> <b>bookstore,</b> Anarco, which he used as a front company to propagate his philosophy. [...] A second front organization, The Anarkist Foundation, was also developed to offer grants to radical causes he supports. A Biofeedback Learning Enhancer was employed to increase Lonnie's abilities. The cybernetic device was described as being capable of amplifying brain functions by a multiple of ten. Anarky was also described as having begun to train in martial arts, following the character's time in juvenile hall.|$|E

He was on hand opening night, giving the cast a pep-talk which he concluded, [...] "We've now done it every {{possible}} way – except go out and piss it in the snow!" [...] The play met with positive critical and fan response, and was endorsed by Raucher himself, but the play was forced to close down {{in the aftermath of}} the September 11 attacks. Nevertheless, the play was enough to spark interest in the film and book with a new generation, prompting Warner to re-issue the book (which had since gone out of print, along with all of Raucher's other works) for sale with Barnes & Noble's <b>online</b> <b>bookstore,</b> and to restore the film and release it on DVD.

2500|$|... 1995 saw Grant {{begin the}} slow {{increase}} in the character's abilities that would culminate in the Anarky series. In the [...] "" [...] story arc from [...] No.40–41, Lonnie is released from juvenile detention, and builds a machine {{that allows him to}} fuse both hemispheres of his brain, giving him increased intelligence, and what he perceives as enlightenment. Creating an <b>online</b> <b>bookstore,</b> Anarco, to propagate radical literature, he begins to accumulate funds that he donates through another front company, The Anarkist Foundation, to radical organizations, such as eco-warriors and gun protesters, or keeps for his own projects. These story devices served to further improve Anarky's skill set, and increase his intelligence and financial independence. During this storyline, Grant finally revealed Lonnie Machin's origins in full, using a farewell letter to his parents to provide exposition into the character's motivations. The origin story narrates through flash backs that Lonnie Machin was once an ordinary child who, while abnormally intelligent, was apolitical and unaware of world events. At eleven he gains a foreign pen pal, Xuasus, as part of a school program. Through this contact, Lonnie discovers the level of global corruption he never knew of before. Further studies into war and political violence leads him to hold radical sympathies. He comes to view all wars as being caused by political elites, with common individuals forced or cajoled into fighting on behalf of the former. He becomes convinced in the need reshape society and becomes Anarky.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{cross-country}} differentials in online textbook pricing. The sample included prices of 95 English-language textbooks at nine large <b>online</b> <b>bookstores</b> the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Germany {{in the spring}} of 2001. Regressions with individual book and store fixed show that textbooks were substantially cheaper in major foreign <b>online</b> <b>bookstores</b> than in major United States <b>online</b> <b>bookstores.</b> The differences between the least expensive United States bookstore in the sample, Barnes and Noble, and the least expensive foreign bookstore in the sample, Alphabetstreet (UK), were 42 percent of list for a single book using standard shipping or 23 percent of list for expedited shipping. Differences were significant even across branches of Amazon. For instance, on a bundle of five books that had a list price of $ 500 in total using standard shipping, a student could save $ 167. 66 by buying the books from Amazon (UK) rather than Amazon (US) and waiting an additional week for delivery. If the student choose the expedited shipping option (1 - 3 days) for both stores, she could save $ 151. 44 by buying the books from Amazon (UK). Savings were even larger if the student purchased from either Alphabetstreet (UK) or Studentbookworld (UK).
