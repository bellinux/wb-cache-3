25|$|Swallow Robin Hall is {{the oldest}} {{residence}} hall and third oldest building on campus, having been completed in 1917 by Samuel Plato. and then remodeled and restored {{in the fall of}} 1990. Silas C. Swallow and his wife (maiden name Robin) financed a major portion of the original construction cost for the building and asked that it be named in honor <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers.</b> The hall was designed by Samuel Plato, a notable architect of the early 20th century.|$|E
25|$|The case to {{be heard}} at the High Court in 2009 {{represented}} 18 young people who alleged that toxic waste dumped by Corby Borough Council between 1984 and 1999 {{was the cause of}} their deformities. All had serious disabilities, including missing or underdeveloped fingers and deformities of their feet. They alleged that their mothers ingested or inhaled the toxic substances that affected the development of their limbs while they were still in the womb. All <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> either lived in or regularly visited Corby between 1984 and 1999 when the work was carried out across the town.|$|E
25|$|In {{this way}} the {{institution}} of slavery in Maryland was made self-perpetuating, as the slaves lived well enough to reproduce. The numbers of slaves in Maryland increased by continued imports up until 1808, and also by natural increase. By making slave status dependent on the mother, according {{to the principle of}} partus sequitur ventrem, Maryland, like Virginia, abandoned the common-law approach of England, in which the social status of children depended on their father. In the colonies, children would take the status <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> and thus be born into slavery if their mothers were enslaved, regardless if their fathers were white, English and Christian, as many were.|$|E

25|$|Most of the English colonists {{arrived in}} Maryland as indentured {{servants}}, {{and had to}} serve a several years' term as laborers {{to pay for their}} passage. In the early years, the line between indentured servants and African slaves or laborers was fluid, and white and black laborers commonly lived and worked together, and formed unions. Mixed-race children born to white mothers were considered free by the principle of partus sequitur ventrem, by which children took the social status <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers,</b> a principle of slave law that was adopted throughout the colonies, following Virginia in 1662. During the colonial era, families of free people of color were formed most often by unions of white women and African men.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to this immediate family, Arthur {{was said to have}} had a great variety of more distant relatives, including maternal aunts, uncles, cousins and a grandfather named Anlawd (or Amlawdd) Wledig ("Prince Anlawd"). The latter is the common link between many of these figures and Arthur: thus the relationship of first cousins that is implied or stated between Arthur, Culhwch, Illtud, and Goreu mab Custenhin depends upon all <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> being daughters of this Anlawd, who appears to be ultimately a genealogical construct designed to allow such inter-relationships between characters to be postulated by medieval Welsh authors. Arthur's maternal uncles in Culhwch and Olwen, including Llygatrud Emys, Gwrbothu Hen, Gweir Gwrhyt Ennwir and Gweir Baladir Hir, similarly appear to derive from this relationship.|$|E
25|$|In Swanton's interpretation, {{social status}} among the Natchez {{was divided into}} two major categories, commoners and nobility. The nobility was further divided into three classes (or castes) called Suns, Nobles, and Honored People. Noble exogamy was practiced, meaning {{that members of the}} noble classes could marry only commoners. A person's social status and class were {{determined}} matrilineally. That is, the children of female Suns, Nobles, or Honoreds were born into the status <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers.</b> However, the children of male Suns and Nobles did not take on commoner status from their mothers, as noble exogamy and matrilineal descent would appear to dictate, but rather inherited one class below their fathers. In other words, children of male Suns became Nobles, while children of male Nobles became Honored, according to Swanton.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} aspects of The Magician's Nephew {{parallel}} Lewis' own life. Both Digory and Lewis were {{children in the}} early 1900s, both wanted a pony, and both were faced with the death <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> in childhood. Digory is separated from his father, who is in India, and misses him. Lewis was schooled in England after his mother's death, while his father remained in Ireland. He also had a brother in India. Lewis was a voracious reader when a child, Digory is also, and both are better with books than with numbers. Digory (and Polly) struggle with sums when {{trying to work out}} how far they must travel along the attic space to explore an abandoned house, Lewis failed the maths entrance exam for Oxford University. Lewis remembered rainy summer days from his youth and Digory is faced with the same woe in the novel. Additionally Digory becomes a professor when he grows up, who takes in evacuated children during World War II.|$|E
25|$|Local {{doctors and}} medical {{officials}} had noticed {{for a long}} time an abnormally high frequency of cerebral palsy and other infantile disorders in the Minamata area. In 1961, a number of medical professionals including Masazumi Harada (later to receive an honour from the United Nations for his body of work on Minamata disease) set about re-examining children diagnosed with cerebral palsy. The symptoms of the children closely mirrored those of adult Minamata disease patients, but many <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> did not exhibit symptoms. The fact that these children had been born after the initial outbreak and had never been fed contaminated fish also led their mothers to believe they were not victims. At the time the medical establishment believed the placenta would protect the foetus from toxins in the bloodstream, which is indeed the case with most chemicals. What was not known at the time was that exactly the opposite is the case with methylmercury: the placenta removes it from the mother's bloodstream and concentrates the chemical in the foetus.|$|E

500|$|Gestation {{is eight}} {{to nine months}} long, after which a single calf {{weighing}} about [...] is born. Births usually peak in the dry season, and take place in thickets – unlike the wildebeest, which give birth in groups on the plains. Though calves can move about on their own shortly after birth, they usually lie in the open in close proximity <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers.</b> The calf is weaned at four months, but young males stay with their mothers {{for two and a}} half years, longer than in other Alcelaphini. Often the mortality rate of male juveniles is high, as they have to face the aggression of territorial adult males and are also deprived of good forage by them. The lifespan is 12 to 15 years.|$|E
500|$|Children {{generally}} {{remained in}} the direct care <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> {{until the age of}} about eight years old, after which time it was not uncommon for the child to be placed in the foster care of another family. There were any number of reasons for a child to be [...] "put-out" [...] in this manner. Some children were placed into households to learn a trade, others to be taught to read and write. It seems that there was a theological reason for fostering children, as with almost every decision in the colony. It was assumed that children's own parents would love them too much and would not properly discipline them. By placing children in the care of another family, there was little danger of them being spoiled.|$|E

500|$|In a 1984 {{interview}} Farmer {{discussed the}} song's lyrics, stating: [...] "It {{can happen to}} many children who are in hospital [...] the nurses feed these children, tuck them into bed, kiss them before they sleep and therefore take the place <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers.</b> So {{it is a little}} girl who tells her mother: I love the nurse". She said in another interview: [...] "But if people prefer to give this song a perverse sense, it is their problem". Thus, she does not confirm the lesbian allusions that seem to emerge from the chorus (the French verb [...] "aimer" [...] can mean either [...] "to love" [...] or [...] "to like"). However, the song has been listed in several books dealing with homosexuality and explains the fact that many gay people were immediately attracted to Farmer's world.|$|E
500|$|The liberal {{political}} party Yabloko {{stated that the}} re-adoption of the Soviet anthem [...] "deepened the schism in [...] society".

The other national symbols used by Russia in 1990, the white-blue-red flag and the double-headed eagle coat of arms, were also given legal approval by Putin in December, thus ending the debate over the national symbols. After all of the symbols were adopted, Putin said on television that this move was needed to heal Russia's past and to fuse the period of the Soviet Union with Russia's history. He also stated that, while Russia's march towards democracy would not be stopped, the rejection of the Soviet era would have left the lives <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> and fathers bereft of meaning. It took some time for the Russian people to familiarize themselves with the anthem's lyrics; athletes were only able to hum along with the anthem during the medal ceremonies at the 2002 Winter Olympics.|$|E

500|$|The impala is diurnal (active mainly {{during the}} day), though {{activity}} tends to cease during the hot midday hours; they feed and rest at night. Three distinct social groups can be observedthe territorial males, bachelor herds and female herds. The territorial males hold territories {{where they may}} form harems of females; territories are demarcated with urine and faeces and defended against juvenile or male intruders. Bachelor herds tend to be small, with less than 30 members. Individuals maintain distances of [...] from one another; while young and old males may interact, middle-aged males generally avoid one another except to spar.

500|$|Richard and Anne had one son, {{born between}} 1474 and 1476, Edward of Middleham, who was created Earl of Salisbury on 15 February 1478. He died in April 1484, after being created Prince of Wales on 8 September the {{previous}} year, {{and only two}} months after formally being declared heir apparent. Richard also had two acknowledged illegitimate children: John of Gloucester (also known as [...] "John of Pontefract"), who was appointed Captain of Calais in 1485, and Katherine Plantagenet who married William Herbert, 2nd Earl of Pembroke, in 1484. Neither their birth dates nor the names <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> are documented, but since Katherine {{was old enough to}} be wedded in 1484 (age of consent was 12) and John was old enough to be knighted in September 1483 in York Minster (when his half brother Edward, Richard's only legitimate heir, was invested Prince of Wales) and to be made Captain of Calais in March 1485, most historians agree that they were fathered during Richard's teen years. There is no trace of infidelity on Richard's part after his marriage to Anne Neville in 1472, when he was around 20, hence the suggestion by A.L.
