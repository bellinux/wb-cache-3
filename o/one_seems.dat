In this episode, SpongeBob's pants have shrunk in the dryer. Unable {{to find a new}} pair, he tries round pants, but no <b>one</b> <b>seems</b> to recognizes him as SpongeBob RoundPants.|$|E
5|$|Following mass vaccinations, disease {{detection}} and containment were {{central to the}} eradication campaign. As soon as cases were detected, the victims were isolated as were their close contacts, who were vaccinated. Successes came quickly; by 1970 smallpox was no longer endemic in western Africa, nor, by 1971, in Brazil. By 1973, smallpox remained endemic only in the Indian sub-continent, Botswana and Ethiopia. Finally, after 13 years of coordinated disease surveillance and vaccination campaigns throughout the world, the World Health Organisation declared smallpox eradicated in 1979. Although the main weapon used was vaccinia virus, which {{was used as the}} vaccine, no <b>one</b> <b>seems</b> to know exactly where vaccinia virus came from; it is not the strain of cowpox that Edward Jenner used, and it is not a weakened form of smallpox.|$|E

25|$|Bacon {{was usually}} careful to cite his sources {{but does not}} mention Shakespeare once in any of his work. Baconians claim, furthermore, that, if the Gesta Grayorum was {{circulated}} prior to its publication in 1688 – and no <b>one</b> <b>seems</b> {{to know if it}} was – it was probably only among members of the Inns of Court.|$|E
25|$|The {{book was}} first {{published}} on June1, 2003 in the US as a hardcover. Since then, Fire and Ice has been released in paperback and e-book format in other languages. The main theme {{of the book is}} that the type of person one is inside {{is more important than the}} way <b>one</b> <b>seems</b> from the outside. The book received mixed reviews: the negative reviews criticized the flat characters, and how troublesome it was to flip back to the characters list due to the large number of cats; positive reviews praised the suspense and rising tensions in the book.|$|E

25|$|Morgan {{gets back}} {{together}} with Hunter, and during a family dinner with Hunter, Mary K finally finds {{out the truth}} about what Selene had done to her, and how Selene and Cal died. To make things worse, strange occurrences begin to happen in Morgan's presence. Books begin flying and light bulbs explode, and no <b>one</b> <b>seems</b> to know the cause - thus attributing the blame to Morgan. Morgan's school grades begin to slip and she finds herself having difficulty finding a balance between her school work and a life of Wicca. She is grounded because of it, meaning she cannot go to a circle. At the end, Sky leaves.|$|E
25|$|Aditya {{starts to}} feel good about life again and starts to have fun with Geet who takes him to her home in Bhatinda where her family is very thankful to Aditya. When Geet's {{grandfather}} (Dara Singh) sees them both together, he thinks that they are a couple and that they are in love with each other. But no <b>one</b> <b>seems</b> to believe him. Aditya has fallen in love with Geet but is aware that Geet loves Anshuman (Tarun Arora). Geet decides to elope with Anshuman as she is sure that her family wouldn't agree for their marriage as their religions are different. When she escapes from her house along with Aditya, her family thinks that they both eloped. They go to Manali, where Anshuman resides. Geet requests Aditya to come with her and meet Anshuman, but he says that their journey together is over and bids her farewell, and the two part ways.|$|E
25|$|The old fleurs-de-lis, {{especially}} the ones {{found in our}} first kings' sceptres, have a lot less in common with ordinary lilies than the flowers called flambas , or irises, from which the name of our own fleur-de-lis may derive. What gives some colour of truth to this hypothesis that we already put forth, {{is the fact that}} the French or Franks, before entering Gaul itself, lived for a long time around the river named Leie in the Flanders. Nowadays, this river is still bordered with an exceptional number of irises —as many plants grow for centuries in the same places—: these irises have yellow flowers, which is not a typical feature of lilies but fleurs-de-lis. It was thus understandable that our kings, having to choose a symbolic image for what later became a coat of arms, set their minds on the iris, a flower that was common around their homes, and is also as beautiful as it was remarkable. They called it, in short, the fleur-de-lis, instead of the flower of the river of lis. This flower, or iris, looks like our fleur-de-lis not just because of its yellow colour but also because of its shape: of the six petals, or leaves, that it has, three of them are alternatively straight and meet at their tops. The other three on the opposite, bend down so that the middle <b>one</b> <b>seems</b> to make one with the stalk and only the two ones facing out from left and right can clearly be seen, which is again similar with our fleurs-de-lis, that is to say exclusively the one from the river Luts whose white petals bend down too when the flower blooms.|$|E

In this episode, on the night of a show, head writer Liz Lemon grows increasingly infuriated when no <b>one</b> <b>seems</b> to remember her 40th birthday. Just before TGSs live taping, Tracy Jordan decides to break character, to his co-workers' chagrin. Meanwhile, television executive Jack Donaghy struggles with the consequences of his promise to give up drinking while his girlfriend Avery Jessup is pregnant with their child.|$|E

They are members of an advanced species looking to make [...] "first contact". So far, based on 10,000 years of observations, no species has been deemed ready. Seeking {{a different view of}} the crew, they temporarily shift to the bodies of Phlox, T'Pol, and Archer. A difference in opinion between the two aliens starts to form: <b>one</b> <b>seems</b> determined to maintain their non-interference protocol, while the other feels the protocol is outdated and unnecessary.|$|E

500|$|After {{the death}} of a patient known as [...] "Yo-yo Man" [...] who offers them wise advice, Guy, Mac and Martin all decide to propose to Caroline. She rejects Martin, {{considers}} the offer from Guy, and Mac appears to be unable to form a proposal. Caroline then learns that Mac wants to meet her at the train station, but when she arrives, it is Guy who turns up. Mac is still at the hospital, where he learns {{that he is going to}} die. Caroline then accepts Guy's proposal of marriage. Meanwhile, in the HR department, Karen is sitting on a windowsill, due to her fear of Clangers. Whilst sitting there, Rachel opens the window behind her, and causes Karen to fall out. However, no <b>one</b> <b>seems</b> to notice.|$|E
500|$|Dawn tells Tara she is {{glad that}} Tara and Willow {{have made up}} after their argument. Since Tara has no {{recollection}} of an argument, she suspects that Willow has used magic to alter her memory. She goes to the Magic Box to consult a book, leaving Dawn alone. Dawn starts to bemoan that no <b>one</b> <b>seems</b> to notice her ("Dawn's Lament"), but is soon seized by minions of Sweet (Hinton Battle), a zoot suit-wearing, tap-dancing, singing demon. They take Dawn to The Bronze, where her attempt to escape transforms into an interpretive dance with the minions ("Dawn's Ballet") before she meets Sweet. He tells Dawn that {{he has come to}} Sunnydale in response to her [...] "invocation", and he will take her to his dimension to make her his bride ("What You Feel") when his visit is complete.|$|E
500|$|Other reviews {{were more}} {{accepting}} of the character. Noel Murray from The A.V. Club was slightly more positive towards the concept of Adam. He wrote that he [...] "love the idea of Adam" [...] but {{was having a hard}} time understanding the coherence of his application to the main plot. He cited inconsistencies in Adam's existence, noting, [...] "Adam killed Professor Walsh weeks ago, and yet The Initiative is still fully operational, and no <b>one</b> <b>seems</b> overly bothered by the fact that one of their leaders was building a monster." [...] Murray, however, did conclude that the show's writers and producers [...] "did a decent job of bringing [...] to a conclusion". Despite critiquing the larger plot, Murray was [...] "always impressed with [...] costume/make-up". Furthermore, he was positively surprised that it [...] "took [...] a minute to recognize" [...] Adam's appearance in [...] "Restless" [...] sans makeup.|$|E

500|$|For the Beatles' seminal 1967 album, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, Starr sang lead vocals on the Lennon–McCartney {{composition}} [...] "With a Little Help from My Friends". Although the Beatles {{had enjoyed}} widespread commercial and critical success with Sgt. Pepper, {{the long hours}} they spent recording the LP contributed to Starr's increased feeling of alienation within the band, he commented: [...] " [...] wasn't our best album. That was the peak for everyone else, but {{for me it was}} a bit like being a session musician ... They more or less direct me in the style I can play." [...] His inability to compose new material led to his input being minimised during recording sessions; he often found himself relegated to adding minor percussion effects to songs by McCartney, Lennon and Harrison. During his down-time Starr worked on his guitar playing; he commented: [...] "I jump into chords that no <b>one</b> <b>seems</b> to get into. Most of the stuff I write is twelve-bar".|$|E
500|$|Chad Hillard of Hillydilly wrote, [...] "Boasting {{the same}} hit quality we've {{come to expect}} from Tove Lo, 'Not On Drugs' {{features}} an absolutely massive chorus that soars through engaging electronics and vigorous emotion found in her magnetic vocals". Richard S. Chang ranked it at number two on his top five of the best Tove Lo songs, while Mark Savage of Discopop considered it the [...] "standout track" [...] of Truth Serum. And Pop's Evan Ross wrote on his review of Queen of the Clouds that, [...] "Out of all the songs on the album this <b>one</b> <b>seems</b> to ring the most true about what it's like to be young and in love". Jamieson Cox of Time deemed it as an [...] "epic song" [...] that [...] "is so good, it is adictive". Conversely, an editor of Juice Online wrote that the recording was not [...] "as catchy as 'Habits (Stay High)'".|$|E
500|$|Fodor's called The Dime Store [...] "bright and hip", {{offering}} [...] "office {{workers and}} hotel guests a much-appreciated source of seasonally driven, well-prepared comfort fare". Cizmar wrote a positive {{review of the}} restaurant in August 2014, in which he paid tribute to Leo's and described his two $1 extras (an egg on his BLT and maple syrup for his pancakes) as [...] "the best two dollars [...] spent all week". That same month, Thrillist contributor Drew Tyson included the diner in his list of the [...] "11 Best New Restaurants in Portland", writing: Billing itself as a [...] "finer diner", this old-school space feels {{a bit like the}} diner in Twin Peaks. There's a magazine and candy counter in one corner that no <b>one</b> <b>seems</b> to touch; just quick enough service that once you start questioning whether or not you'll get another cup of coffee, one arrives; plus a menu full of classics. All-in-all it's one of the only places you can go in Downtown and feel like you're transported somewhere else entirely.|$|E
