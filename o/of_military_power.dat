Kennan resigned as director of policy planning in December 1949 but stayed in the department as counselor until June 1950. In January 1950, Acheson replaced Kennan with Nitze, who was much {{more comfortable with the}} calculus <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>power.</b> Afterwards, Kennan accepted an appointment as Visitor to the Institute for Advanced Study from fellow moderate Robert Oppenheimer, Director of the Institute.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not certain}} that the slaves were a {{homogeneous}} group {{under the leadership of}} Spartacus. While this is the unspoken assumption of the Roman historians, this may be the Romans projecting their own hierarchical view <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>power</b> and responsibility on the ad hoc organization of the slaves. Certainly other slave leaders are mentioned—Crixus, Oenomaus, Gannicus, and Castus—and it cannot be told from the historical evidence whether they were aides, subordinates, or even equals leading groups of their own and traveling in convoy with Spartacus' people.|$|E

5|$|The game {{is set in}} 2097, {{according}} to the introductory sequence. This sequence also provides {{the history of the}} game’s setting: in 2057, the depletion of Earth’s resources coincided with widening space exploration. After a catastrophic war over ever-declining resources, ending 10 years prior to the events of G-Police, Earth’s governments were stripped <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>power.</b> As a result, powerful corporations had exerted control over Earth and the burgeoning space colonies. The Government Police (G-Police) was formed by Earth’s remaining coalition government to maintain order in these colonies.|$|E
5|$|The late Republic saw an {{increase}} in the centralisation of power into the hands of provincial governors, the use <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>power</b> to enforce political changes (e.g. the Sullan dictatorship), and the use of violence, combined with exploitation of the suitably bribed or intimidated 'sovereign' assemblies, to grant supreme authority to victorious commanders. The increasing legitimisation of violence and centralisation of authority into fewer and fewer men would, with the collapse of trust in the Republic's institutions, put it on a path to civil war and its transformation into the autocratic Roman Empire.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Artillery Monument {{attempted}} {{a very different}} effect. Jagger takes a realist approach to his figures, embracing detailed images <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>power</b> {{with none of the}} classical symbolism of other monuments, or even Jagger's own pre-war pieces. The art historian Reginald Wilenski likens the memorial to the work of Frank Brangwyn, who focused on depicting the physical labour of soldiers and workers during the war. The memorial shows the three upright bronze figures stood at ease, rather than to attention; the driver even leans back against the parapet, his cape hanging over his outstretched arms, suggesting an attitude of exhaustion or contemplation. The faceless, heavily laden statue of the fallen soldier appears less at rest than tired, pulled down as if by a great weight. At the same time, the sheer size of the memorial, including the oversized gun and the larger-than-life bronze figures, exudes a sense of strength and power; the figures are stocky, confident and imposing. This strength and power contributes to the sense of masculinity that pervades the work, from the phallic image of the howitzer, to the solid, muscular figures of the gunners.|$|E

5|$|The late 9th {{and early}} 10th century {{constitute}} the earliest and most productive period of medieval Bulgarian literature. Having spent {{his early years}} in Constantinople, Simeon introduced Byzantine culture to the Bulgarian court, but eliminated its assimilative effect by means <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>power</b> and religious autonomy. The disciples of Cyril and Methodius, among whom Clement of Ohrid, Naum and Constantine of Preslav, continued their educational work in Bulgaria, actively translating Christian texts, such as the Bible and the works of John Chrysostom, Basil of Caesarea, Cyril of Alexandria, Gregory of Nazianzus, Athanasius of Alexandria, as well as historic chronicles such as these of John Malalas and George Hamartolus, to Bulgarian. The reign of Simeon also witnessed {{the production of a}} number of original theological and secular works, such as John Exarch's Six Days (Šestodnev), Constantine of Preslav's Alphabetical Prayer and Proclamation of the Holy Gospels, and Černorizec Hrabǎr's An Account of Letters. Simeon's own contribution to this literary blossoming was praised by his contemporaries, for example in the Praise to Tsar Simeon preserved in the Zlatostruj collection and Simeon's Collection, to which the tsar personally wrote an addendum.|$|E

25|$|The Treaty of Gandamak also {{required}} that Afghanistan sever its {{relationships with the}} independent tribes of the tribal regions of Afghanistan, those lying {{on the far side}} of the Durand Line. These tribes had previously been a substantial source <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>power</b> for the Afghanistan throne. When Habibullah became Emir he was pressured by the British government to ratify the Treaty of Gandamak and, although he did so by proclamation in 1905, he would not commit to withdraw Afghan influence from the British side of the Durand Line, or to sever Afghanistan's relationship with the tribes in that area.|$|E
25|$|Public {{support for}} the coup has been widely aired and {{published}} whilst public expression of opinion against the coup has been limited by the military control over the media, the ban on protests and political activity, and the arrest of some cabinet members by the junta. Protest has also arisen from both pro- and anti- Thaksin supporters and is directed against the use <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>power</b> to resolve a political stalemate. Protest is also limited following the king's endorsement of the coup and the junta's use of a royal decree that legitimizes the coup. See also Censorship in Thailand.|$|E

25|$|The Battle of Lak Sao, fought between November 1963 and January 1964, {{was a major}} {{engagement}} of the Laotian Civil War. In November 1963, General Phoumi Nosavan, who held the reins <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>power</b> in the Kingdom of Laos, launched a military offensive against North Vietnamese invaders that cut across the northern panhandle of the nation. Although unsupported in this proxy action by his backers in the U.S. Embassy, he went ahead with his plan to push northwards from Nhommarath, then veer eastwards to the Vietnamese border. Phoumi's Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) advisors warned him that the North Vietnamese would retaliate, but he disregarded them.|$|E
25|$|For their part, the Allied navy {{expended}} more shells on St Malo, Granville, Calais, and Dunkirk; likewise on Palamos in Catalonia where Charles II had {{appointed the}} Marquis of Gastañaga as the governor-general. The Allies sent Austrian and German reinforcements under Prince George of Hesse-Darmstadt, {{a cousin of}} the Queen of Spain, while the French replaced the ailing Noailles with the Duke of Vendôme who {{would become one of}} Louis XIV's best generals. But the balance <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>power</b> was turning dangerously against the French. In Spain, in the Rhineland, and in the Low Countries, Louis XIV's forces only barely held their own: the bombardment of the French channel ports, the threats of invasion, and the loss of Namur were causes of great anxiety for the King at Versailles.|$|E
25|$|After the Korean War, North Korea {{maintained}} a powerful, but smaller military force {{than that of}} South Korea. In 1967 the KPA forces of about 345,000 were {{much smaller than the}} South Korean ground forces of about 585,000. North Korea's relative isolation and economic plight starting from the 1980s has now tipped the balance <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>power</b> {{into the hands of the}} better-equipped South Korean military. In response to this predicament, North Korea relies on asymmetric warfare techniques and unconventional weaponry to achieve parity against high-tech enemy forces. North Korea is reported to have developed a wide range of technologies towards this end, such as stealth paint to conceal ground targets, midget submarines and human torpedoes, blinding laser weapons, and probably has a chemical weapons program and is likely to possess a stockpile of chemical weapons. The Korean People's Army operates ZM-87 anti-personnel lasers, which are banned under the United Nations Protocol on Blinding Laser Weapons.|$|E

25|$|Built around 1090, Neuenburg Castle was {{extended}} and modernized {{on a large}} scale several times. With its 30 000 square meters, the castle was amongst the strongest architectural representations <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>power</b> in all of the empire. It has survived to a remarkable extend: Major sections of the curtain walls in the north and east, part of the gate, the bottom part of the cattle, the castle keep, trenches in the east and in the south are conserved until today. The landmark big William (Dicker Wilhelm) is situated in the north-eastern part of the complex and visible from far away as a symbol of power. The castle keep III is classified as an independent development next to the French residential towers (donjons) which produced similar examples in the Rhineland region. Around 1225, a residential tower (residential tower II) was built probably for the landgrave’s family outside the southern curtain wall. 1172 Emperor Friedrich I Barbarossa visited Neuenburg Castle – the legend of the “living wall” of soldiers providing the best military defense has its roots in this legendary visit.|$|E
500|$|Many {{commentators}} {{have suggested that}} Sappho's use of Helen as an example in this poem is intended as a rejection of masculine in favour of feminine values. [...] For instance, John J.

Hutchinson notes that, though the definition of beauty Sappho attacks might seem a characteristically male one, the definition she replaces it with is generally applicable, rather than being solely relevant to women.|$|E
500|$|The balance <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>power</b> in the Bosnian War {{had started}} to shift against the VRS in early 1994, despite its {{advantages}} in heavy weapons.

While the HV and the HVO advanced west of Livno (Operation Leap 1), the VRS launched its own offensive—Operation Joint Action 95 (...) [...] Operation Joint Action 95 was intended as a war-winning offensive, [...] and was launched south of the Derventa–Brčko corridor, but was also designed to widen the critical resupply route. Launched on 19 April, the VRS offensive faced determined resistance from the ARBiH and the HVO and had bogged down {{by the end of the}} month.|$|E
