500|$|Editor Ralph Rosenblum's first {{assembly}} of the film in 1976 left Brickman disappointed. [...] "I felt that the film was running off in nine different directions," [...] Brickman recalled. [...] "It was like a first draft of a novel... from which two or three films could possibly be assembled." [...] Rosenblum characterized the first cut, at two hours and twenty minutes, as [...] "the surrealistic and abstract adventures of a neurotic Jewish comedian who was reliving his highly flawed life {{and in the process}} satirizing much <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>culture...</b> a visual monologue, a more sophisticated and more philosophical version of Take the Money and Run". Brickman found it [...] "nondramatic and ultimately uninteresting, a kind of cerebral exercise." [...] He suggested a more linear narrative.|$|E
500|$|There are two {{different}} music videos for [...] "American Life", {{the first of which}} was not released by Madonna.

Madonna had the idea for the music video in November 2002, then she and Åkerlund developed the idea to make an anti-war and anti-fashion mini-movie. With [...] "American Life", she took her music videos to a different level by focusing on war, politics and, according to media interpretation, the then-upcoming invasion of Iraq. [...] "It is an antiwar statement..." [...] she subsequently clarified, [...] "but it's not necessarily against this war. At any given moment there's at least 30 wars going on in this world and I'm against all of them." [...] Shortly after it was filmed, Warner Bros. Records released a statement regarding the music video: [...] " [...] expresses a panoramic view <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>culture</b> and looming war through the view of a female superhero portrayed by Madonna. Starting as a runway show of couture army fatigues, the fashion show escalates into a mad frenzy depicting the catastrophic repercussions and horrors of war." [...] An exclusive sneak peek of the video was available on VH1's program Backstage at the Grammys.|$|E

As the book's title suggests, Jacobs' outlook is far more pessimistic than that of her previous works. However, in the conclusion she admits: [...] "At a given time it is hard to tell whether forces of cultural life or death are in the ascendancy. Is suburban sprawl, with its murders of communities and wastes of land, time, and energy, a sign of decay? Or is rising interest in means of overcoming sprawl a sign of vigor and adaptability in North American culture? Arguably, either {{could turn out to be}} true." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{a number}} of essays on [...] "littoral art," [...] Barber has {{emphasized}} donative art practices as examples of communicative action. [...] Donative art actions insist that giving can be used strategically to further {{a number of}} identifiable lifeworld and humanitarian goals, {{as well as provide}} some critical intervention into the ideological fabric <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>culture.</b> [...] While donative practices may activate a cycle of reciprocity, gifts may remain unreciprocated. [...] Each cultural intervention, exemplary or not, engages a [...] "logic of practice" [...] (Pierre Bourdieu) that encourages an infinite variety of exchanges or gifts, challenges, ripostes, reciprocations, and repressions. [...] The logic of practice privileges agency in its unpredictability and provides, according to Habermas, an alternative to money and power as a basis for societal integration. [...] Among the artists engaged in donative art practices and who are mentioned in Barber's writings are: Istvan Kantor, David Mealing, Yin Xiaofeng, REPOhistory, Kelly Lycan & Free Food, Bloom 98, WochenKlausur, Ala Plastica, Peter Dunn & Lorraine Leeson, Art Link, Hirsch Farm Project.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1950s, Marcuse and Brown, {{together}} with Trilling in Freud and the Crisis <b>of</b> <b>Our</b> <b>Culture</b> (1955), challenged this interpretation of Freud. They believed that Freud {{showed that a}} high price has been paid for civilization, and that Freud's critical element was {{to be found in}} his late metahistorical studies, works considered unscientific by orthodox analysts and reactionary by the neo-Freudians. Marcuse and Brown shared a similar general outlook and devoted the most attention to the same Freudian concepts. They saw Freud's greatness in his metahistorical analysis of [...] "the general neurosis of mankind", argued that modern man is sick with the burdens of sexual repression and uncontrolled aggression, attempted to make explicit the hidden critical trend in psychoanalysis that promised a nonrepressive civilization as a solution to the dilemma of modern unhappiness, and accepted the most radical and discouraging of Freud's psychological assumptions: the pervasive role of sexuality and the existence of the death instinct. Brown, unlike Marcuse, had strong mystical inclinations and drew on revolutionary themes in western religious thought, especially the body mysticism of Böhme and Blake.|$|E

[...] James Taranto, writing in the [...] "Best of the Web Today" [...] column at The Wall Street Journal, also objected to the idea, not only because depicting Mohammed [...] "is inconsiderate of the sensibilities of others", but also because [...] "it defines those others—Muslims—as being outside <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>culture,</b> unworthy of the courtesy we readily accord to insiders." [...] Bill Walsh of Bedford Minuteman wrote critically of the initiative, which seemed [...] "petulant and childish" [...] to him: [...] "It attempts to battle religious zealotry with rudeness and sacrilege, and we can only wait to see what happens, but I fear it won’t be good." [...] Janet Albrechtsen wrote in The Australian, [...] "As a cartoon, it was mildly amusing. As a campaign, it's crass and gratuitously offensive."

2500|$|Palin {{has stated}} that she {{supports}} a Federal Constitutional Amendment to ban same-sex marriage. This position differed with that of her running mate, John McCain. In a July 31, 2012 interview with Greta Van Susteren, Palin was asked about states' rights as they pertained to same-sex marriage, to which Palin responded, [...] "I believe that states have that constitutional right {{to make decisions about}} a variety of issues, {{but when it comes to}} some very fundamental, very cornerstone aspects of our society, <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>culture,</b> I personally would love to see a national dialogue about what will America continue to define as marriage. As a former Governor, I say let the states decide that, and that's where I would be, if I were in national office. I'd be saying let the states decide. And if you see, Greta, and pay attention to where the states have gone with this particular issue and the votes of the people, overwhelmingly the people within the states have said they want to continue to define marriage as one man and one woman, as the Muslims do, Orthodox Jews do, nondenominational Christians do, faith-practicing Catholics do. It truly is a cornerstone of religion and civilization." ...|$|E
2500|$|Psychoanalysis {{has been}} {{interpreted}} as both radical and conservative. By the 1940s, {{it had come to}} be seen as conservative by the European and American intellectual community. Critics outside the psychoanalytic movement, whether on the political left or right, saw Freud as a conservative. Fromm had argued that several aspects of psychoanalytic theory served the interests of political reaction in his The Fear of Freedom (1942), an assessment confirmed by sympathetic writers on the right. In [...] (1959), Philip Rieff portrayed Freud as a man who urged men {{to make the best of}} an inevitably unhappy fate, and admirable for that reason. In the 1950s, Herbert Marcuse challenged the then prevailing interpretation of Freud as a conservative in Eros and Civilization (1955), as did Lionel Trilling in Freud and the Crisis <b>of</b> <b>Our</b> <b>Culture</b> and Norman O. Brown in Life Against Death (1959). Eros and Civilization helped make the idea that Freud and Karl Marx were addressing similar questions from different perspectives credible to the left. Marcuse criticized neo-Freudian revisionism for discarding seemingly pessimistic theories such as the death instinct, arguing that they could be turned in a utopian direction. Freud's theories also influenced the Frankfurt School and critical theory as a whole.|$|E
