[...] Noting it as one of their choice picks from the album, Andy Kellman of Allmusic called the song [...] "euphoric" [...] and was the best of The-Dream and Tricky's seven songs on the album. A Rap-Up writer noted the song as a standout track from the album. Ed Easton, Jr. of WXRK said the song [...] "reminds all her fans that she can actually sing and be taken seriously as an actual artist rather than an over-hyped dancer." [...] As one of the album's [...] "emotionally demanding cuts," [...] Ken Capobianco of Boston Globe said that the song [...] "lacked conviction." [...] Becky Bain of Idolator was less than enthusiastic of the song, commenting, [...] "basically, we’re speechless, too, but <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> can’t find much to rave about." [...] Bain also called the synth-beat generic and [...] "run-of-the-mill," [...] comparing it to her [...] "Love Sex Magic." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1924, Ras Tafari toured Europe and the Middle East visiting Jerusalem, Alexandria, Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam, Stockholm, London, Geneva, and Athens. With him on {{his tour}} was a group that {{included}} Ras Seyum Mangasha of western Tigray Province; Ras Hailu Tekle Haymanot of Gojjam province; Ras Mulugeta Yeggazu of Illubabor Province; Ras Makonnen Endelkachew; and Blattengeta Heruy Welde Sellase. [...] The primary goal of the trip to Europe was for Ethiopia {{to gain access to}} the sea. [...] In Paris, Tafari was to find out from the French Foreign Ministry (Quai d'Orsay) that this goal would not be realized. [...] However, failing this, he and his retinue inspected schools, hospitals, factories, and churches. Although patterning many reforms after European models, Tafari remained wary of European pressure. To guard against economic imperialism, Tafari required that all enterprises have at least partial local ownership. Of his modernization campaign, he remarked, [...] "We need European progress <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> are surrounded by it. That is at once a benefit and a misfortune." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2013 {{the economy}} grew 3.3%. HSBC chief {{economist}} for Australia and New Zealand, Paul Bloxham, was so impressed that he predicted New Zealand's growth would outpace most of its peers, and he described New Zealand as the [...] "rock star economy of 2014". Another financial commentator said the New Zealand dollar was the [...] "hottest" [...] currency of 2014. Only three months later, The New Zealand Productivity Commission expressed concern about low living standards and problems affecting the long-term drivers of growth. Paul Conway, Director of Economics & Research at the Productivity Commission, wrote: [...] "New Zealand's broad policy settings should generate GDP per capita 20 per cent above the OECD average, but the actual result is more than 20 per cent below average. We may be punching above our weight, but that’s <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> are in the wrong weight division!" [...] In August, Paul Bloxham, who coined the term [...] "rock star economy", admitted that [...] "the sharp decline in dairy prices {{over the last six}} months has clouded the outlook somewhat". In December however Bloxham stated that he thought the New Zealand economy would continue to grow strongly.|$|E

She claimed that her election [...] "challenged the traditional conservatism that denies leading public positions to women, and challenged the old order, which treats our communities as silent voting fodder. And it was <b>only</b> possible <b>because</b> <b>we</b> united people around a progressive message of anti-racism and social justice". She was re-elected to the post in May 2010.|$|R

2500|$|George Martin {{claimed he}} first heard {{it at the}} [...] "Love Me Do" [...] re-make session on 11 September. Ringo Starr in Anthology stated: [...] "On my first visit in September we just ran through some tracks for George Martin. We even did 'Please Please Me'. I {{remember}} that, because while we were recording it I was playing the bass drum with a maraca {{in one hand and}} a tambourine in the other." [...] John Lennon in Anthology stated: [...] "We'd had a top 30 entry with 'Love Me Do' and we really thought we were on top of the world. Then came 'Please Please Me'—and wham! We tried to make it as simple as possible. Some of the stuff we've written in the past has been a bit way-out, but we aimed this one straight at the hit parade. … We almost abandoned it as the b-side of 'Love Me Do'. We changed our minds <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> were so tired the night we did Love Me Do. We'd been going over it a few times and when we came to the question of the flipside, we intended using 'Please Please Me'. Our recording manager, George Martin, thought our arrangement was fussy, so we tried to make it simpler. We were getting very tired, though, and we just couldn't seem to get it right. We are conscientious about our work and we don't like to rush things." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{author of}} The Art is {{at pains to}} defend the status of {{medicine}} as an art (techne), against opponents who (perhaps following Protagoras' critique of expert knowledge) claim it produces no better results against disease than chance (an attack served {{by the fact that}} doctors refused to treat the serious and difficult cases they judged to be incurable by their art). The treatise may be considered [...] "the first attempt at general epistemology bequeathed to us by antiquity," [...] although this may <b>only</b> be <b>because</b> <b>we</b> have lost fifth-century rhetorical works that took a similar approach.|$|R
60|$|What can {{be known}} empirically {{about the matter}} of a thing is <b>only</b> approximate, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> cannot {{get to know the}} {{appearances}} of the thing from very small distances, and cannot accurately infer the limit of these appearances. But it is inferred approximately by means of the appearances we can observe. It then turns out that these appearances can be exhibited by physics {{as a function of the}} matter in our immediate neighbourhood; e.g. the visual appearance of a distant object is a function of the light-waves that reach the eyes. This leads to confusions of thought, but offers no real difficulty.|$|R
40|$|Game {{theory is}} the study of {{mathematical}} models of conflicts. It has many applications in various fields like evolutionary biology, economics, political sciences, logic, computers sciences and more. In this thesis we form a connection between the game theory and the Ising model, and we study mathematical models (games) of the first by using the second. This is not <b>only</b> helpful <b>because</b> <b>we</b> can apply techniques of statistical physics and make the study of these models simpler, but also, in this way we introduce the correlated probabilities in the model, and the possibility of mistakes during the process. This is reasonable if we think that usually the players are humans and their decisions are affected by their emotions, their environment e. t. c...|$|R

Akin to building your own printing press in order to distribute a questionnaire. We can do better. This talk will discuss the road towards a future in which reusing someone else&# 39;s research code takes minutes, not days. I will discuss some of the key technologies involved, cultural changes needed and open-source projects that are tackling this problem...|$|R
