5|$|Gorbachev began {{a period}} of {{internal}} economic restructuring, known as perestroika, and agreed {{to a series of}} summits with the American president. Matlock was instrumental in preparing Reagan for his first summit with Gorbachev, arranging for specialists within the government to write a “Soviet Union 101” course of 21 papers on Russia for Reagan to study. Matlock also participated in a mock summit, playing the role <b>of</b> <b>Gorbachev,</b> allowing Reagan to practice the encounter in advance.|$|E
5|$|Jaruzelski's Poland {{depended}} on low-cost deliveries of industrial staple commodities from the Soviet Union and meaningful Polish reforms, economic or political, were not feasible during {{the rule of}} the last three conservative Soviet general secretaries. The perestroika and glasnost policies of the Soviet Union's new leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, were therefore a crucial factor in stimulating reform in Poland. Gorbachev essentially repudiated the Brezhnev Doctrine, which had stipulated that attempts by its Eastern European satellite states to abandon the communist bloc would be countered by the Soviet Union with force. The developments in the Soviet Union altered the international situation and provided a historical opportunity for independent reforms in Poland. The hardline stance of US President Ronald Reagan was also helpful. David Ost stressed the constructive influence <b>of</b> <b>Gorbachev.</b> With his support for Polish and Hungarian membership in the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund and for the East European pluralistic evolution in general, the Soviet leader effectively pushed East Europe toward the West.|$|E
25|$|Gromyko {{held the}} office of the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, {{literally}} head of state, which was largely ceremonial, and his influence in ruling circles diminished. A number of First World journalists believed Gromyko was uncomfortable with many of Gorbachev's reforms, however, in his Memoirs Gromyko writes fondly <b>of</b> <b>Gorbachev</b> and the policy of perestroika. Gromyko believed that perestroika was about working {{for the construction of a}} socialist society and saw glasnost and perestroika as an attempt at making the USSR more democratic.|$|E

50|$|Due to {{the immense}} {{popularity}} <b>of</b> Mikhail <b>Gorbachev</b> with ordinary East Germans disillusioned {{with their own}} hardline Communist leaders, the DSF's membership grew massively {{in the last years}} of the regime which many interpret as a sign <b>of</b> support <b>of</b> <b>Gorbachev's</b> glasnost and perestroika by the East German people. In 1989 there were 6.3 million members.|$|R

25|$|According to Gorbachev, Yeltsin {{kept the}} {{plans of the}} Belovezhskaya meeting in strict secrecy and the main goal of the {{dissolution}} of the Soviet Union was to get rid <b>of</b> <b>Gorbachev,</b> who by that time had started to recover his position after the events of August. Gorbachev has also accused Yeltsin of violating the people's will expressed in the referendum in which the majority voted to keep the Soviet Union united. On 12 December, the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR ratified the Belavezha Accords and denounced the 1922 Union Treaty. It also ordered the Russian deputies in the Council of the Union to cease their work, leaving that body without a quorum. In effect, the largest republic of the Soviet Union had seceded.|$|E
25|$|On 15 March 1990, Gorbachev {{was elected}} {{as the first}} {{executive}} President of the Soviet Union with 59% of the Deputies' votes. He was the sole candidate on the ballot. The Congress of People's Deputies {{met for the first}} time on 25 May in order to elect representatives from the Congress to sit on the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. Nonetheless, the Congress posed problems for Gorbachev: Its sessions were televised, airing more criticism and encouraging people to expect ever more rapid reform. Perestroika meant changing the planned economy into a more active, self-financed system, where the duration of central planning would not exceed five years, and which would be more able to react to economic needs. Communist rule in the Soviet Union weakened, and centralized power from Moscow was unable to combat centrifugal forces in the South. In the elections, many Party candidates were defeated. Furthermore, Boris Yeltsin was elected as mayor of Moscow and returned to political prominence to become an increasingly vocal critic <b>of</b> <b>Gorbachev.</b>|$|E

Homer then glues a rainbow-colored wig on his opponent's head just before {{he is about to}} give an important speech to a local club. George retaliates by destroying the Simpsons' lawn with his car. Homer and Bart are making their way through the sewers to release locusts in George's house when George spots them and climbs down. Homer and George begin fighting, so Bart releases the locusts which attack George. At the same time, former Soviet premier Mikhail Gorbachev arrives at the mansion to bring a house warming present for the Bush family. Finally, after pressure from his wife, George apologizes to Homer in front <b>of</b> <b>Gorbachev,</b> much to George's dislike. The Bushes eventually move out and sell the house to Gerald Ford, another former President. Ford invites Homer to watch a football game with him, and to enjoy some beer and nachos at his house. The two quickly get off to a good start, sharing common ground.|$|E
50|$|With {{the ascent}} to power <b>of</b> Mikhail <b>Gorbachev</b> in the USSR, Problems of Peace and Socialism began to gain notoriety as an {{incubator}} of the liberalization known as perestroika. Several <b>of</b> <b>Gorbachev’s</b> top advisors on his reforms (such as Gennadi Gerasimov, Georgy Shakhnazarov, Yevgeny Ambartsumov, Anatoly Chernyaev, Georgy Arbatov, Aleksandr Tsipko, Yegor Yakovlev, Ivan Frolov {{had worked on}} the staff of the magazine in Prague.|$|R

2500|$|Unlike President Reagan and Secretary of State Shultz, Weinberger did {{not regard}} any <b>of</b> <b>Gorbachev's</b> actions—whether it was perestroika or glasnost—as reassuring {{indicators}} of his stated intentions. [...] "Not only did Gorbachev {{give up all}} of the Soviet 'non-negotiable' demands , but he gave us precisely the kind of treaty that the President had sought for seven years. That act of course does not mean—any more than does the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan—that the USSR has given up its long-term aggressive designs." [...] Initially, Reagan's views were in line with Weinberger's views, but he began to reevaluate his perception <b>of</b> <b>Gorbachev's</b> intentions in 1987, the year Gorbachev accepted the U.S. proposal on INF.|$|R

Pugo killed his wife and then shot himself after the coup. Akhromeyev, who had offered his assistance but was never implicated, was found hanging in his Kremlin office.
