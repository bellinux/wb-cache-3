The Cliona had a press party including {{a number of}} RTÃ‰ cameras embarked to do some filming for the new national broadcaster. The ship initially carried out a successful Hedgehog mortar exercise. During her second pattern of depth charges, she suffered a premature explosion from a charge dropped from the port stern rail.

The leaking oil resulted in a serious fire which rapidly accelerated out of control. Stoker William Mynes closed the feed valves, isolating the supply of fuel to the fire. Mynes had to be ordered to leave his post so he could receive medical attention for burns he had sustained in the fire fighting effort. The Executive Officer, Lt. Pat O'Mahoney, then entered the aft boiler room where he fought the fire for at least another thirty minutes. The fire was eventually extinguished, despite the Marine Rescue Coordination centre dispatching an oceangoing tug, the Clonmel to the scene to assist, the Cliona [...] was able to proceed to Haulbowline under her own steam for an investigation and repairs. Neither Mynes or O'Mahoney received a decoration for the bravery they showed in their fire fighting effort.|$|R

40|$|In a stirred vessel {{used as a}} semi-batch reactor, one of the {{reactants}} {{is supplied}} via a <b>feed</b> <b>pipe.</b> In this project. Planar Laser Induced Fluorescence was used for studying how the feed flow from such a <b>feed</b> <b>pipe</b> {{is influenced by the}} turbulent flow in the vessel (Re ? 9000). The feed flow was visualised by use of a horizontal laser sheet at several vertical positions under the <b>feed</b> <b>pipe.</b> Measurements were performed with different <b>feed</b> <b>pipe</b> openings and at several impeller speeds. The digital images of the feed flow were corrected for systematic noise. To separate the feed flow structures from the background, an objective threshold grey level was calculated. At the positions under the <b>feed</b> <b>pipe,</b> average values of several parameters characterising the feed flow have been determined. The trends in the relation between an average parameter and the position under the <b>feed</b> <b>pipe</b> are the same for different <b>feed</b> <b>pipe</b> openings and impeller speeds. These trends are mainly due to the wake behind the head of the <b>feed</b> <b>pipe.</b> At low impeller speeds, the wake is related to the shape of the <b>feed</b> <b>pipe.</b> When the impeller speed is high, the shape of the <b>feed</b> <b>pipe</b> is less important and the effect of the wake is smaller. From the trends for the decay in length scale of the feed flow, it can be concluded that the decaying length scale depends on the <b>feed</b> <b>pipe</b> opening and the impeller speed {{in a way that is}} different from that predicted by theory.

40|$|Experiments on semibatch {{reaction}} crystallization of {{benzoic acid}} are reported. The conditions in an agitated tank are simulated by a loop reactor by which feed point mixing conditions {{can be controlled}} separately from the macroscale circulation rate. Hydrochloric acid is fed into a circulating solution of sodium benzoate and the in#uence of macromixing, mesomixing and micromixing on the product crystal mean size is evaluated. The product mean size increases with increasing circulation rate in the loop, with increasing feed point mixing intensity, with decreasing feed rate and with decreasing <b>feed</b> <b>pipe</b> diameter. Increased mixing intensity on any level leads to larger product crystals, but especially the rate of mesomixing is of importance. The in#uence of the <b>feed</b> <b>pipe</b> diameter is opposite to predictions by available theories and cannot be explained by backmixing into the <b>feeding</b> <b>pipe.</b> All results can be correlated quite well against a dimensionless mixing e$ciency de"ned as {{the ratio of the}} reactant feeding time to the mixing time.

40|$|The {{demand for}} seafood is {{continuously}} growing throughout the world, {{while the number}} of sheltered locations for fish farming is decreasing. Consequently, the industry is pushed to fin nd new and innovative solutions to this problem. One solution is to move the fish farms in non-sheltered locations, which requires extensive research on all structural parts of a fish farm, including components of the feeding system. The main goal of this thesis is to predict the hydrodynamic loads on <b>feed</b> <b>pipes</b> used by fish farmers in the industry, which is an important aspect of design to assure successful operation. The aquaculture industry has expressed the need for increasing the knowledge on <b>feed</b> <b>pipes</b> for fish farming. The bending of the pipes is of particular concern, especially when introducing non-sheltered locations. The hydrodynamic loads of the feed barge were obtained by generating a finite element model in GeniE and performing hydrodynamic analysis in frequency domain with the potential solver Wadam. The displacement RAOs of the feed barge were imported into OrcaFlex after conducting a sensitivity-and convergence study to verify the results. Dynamic simulations of the <b>feed</b> <b>pipes</b> were carried out in time domain using OrcaFlex, where the design basis was established using typical environmental and design data for Norwegian salmon farming. Analyses were performed under different sea states, investigating different responses of the <b>feed</b> <b>pipe.</b> Due to the limited work available on the force coefficients for floating pipes on the sea surface, a sensitivity study regarding the force coefficients was carried out. It was concluded to implement a variable data set for the drag-and added mass coe cient of the <b>feed</b> <b>pipes.</b> The results obtained for the selected cases resulted in high loads for all <b>feed</b> <b>pipe</b> lengths. The main problem that was found for the <b>feed</b> <b>pipes</b> was the large bending moment at the connection points, i. e. at the fish cage and the feed barge. For this reason, bend stiffeners at the connection points were installed. A reduction of 846 % for the bending moment was observed with the bending stiffener attached to the pipe. To conclude, the dynamic analysis exhibits too large hydrodynamic loads for offshore use. The use of bending stiffeners seems inevitable for the harsh environment in the open sea. More research on the <b>feed</b> <b>pipes</b> must be carried out to secure safe operation offshore...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Minimizing the {{cylinder}} wear and the consumption rate of cylinder {{oil in a}} large two-stroke marine diesel engine is of great economic importance. In Korea, a motor-driven cylinder lubricator for a large two-stroke marine diesel engine manufactured by WÃ¤rtsilÃ¤ Switzerland Co., Ltd. was first developed by authors through the joint research of industry-university in 2002. The characteristic of the developed product is that can control automatically the <b>oil</b> <b>feed</b> rate to a load fluctuation by the motor drive and the offset cam. The performance of the product is not also inferior to the conventional one. For manufacturing the reliable and useful products, however, it is necessary to investigate further characteristics and improve the performance of a cylinder lubricator. In this study, the effect of quill with and without accumulator on maximum discharge pressure, delivery delay duration and <b>oil</b> <b>feed</b> rate relative to motor revolution speed using plunger stroke as a parameter is experimentally investigated by using the developed cylinder lubricator. It is found that the maximum discharge pressure with accumulator is higher than that of no accumulator as plunger stroke and motor revolution speed are elevated, and the delivery delay duration with accumulator is shorter than that of no accumulator as plunger stroke and motor revolution speed are increased. Also, <b>oil</b> <b>feed</b> rate with accumulator is les...|$|R
