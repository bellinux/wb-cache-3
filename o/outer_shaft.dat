Here is {{the door of}} the Baptistery at Pisa, again by Mr. Severn delightfully enlarged for us from a photograph. [1] The general idea of it is a square-headed opening in a solid wall, faced by an arch carried on shafts. And the ornament does indeed follow this construction so that the eye catches it with ease,--but under what arbitrary conditions! In the square door, certainly the side-posts of it are as important members as the lintel they carry; but the lintel is carved elaborately, and the side-posts left blank. Of the facing arch and shaft, it would be similarly difficult to say whether the sustaining vertical, or sustained curve, were the more important member of the construction; but the decorator now reverses the distribution of his care, adorns the vertical member with passionate elaboration, and runs a narrow band, of comparatively uninteresting work, round the arch. Between this <b>outer</b> <b>shaft</b> and inner door is a square pilaster, of which the architect carves one side, and lets the other alone. It is followed by a smaller shaft and arch, in which he reverses his treatment of the outer order by cutting the shaft delicately and the arch deeply. Again, whereas in what is called the decorated construction of English Gothic, the pillars would have been left plain and the spandrils deep cut,--here, are we to call it decoration of the construction, when the pillars are carved and the spandrils left plain? Or when, finally, either these spandril spaces {{on each side of the}} arch, or the corresponding slopes of the gable, are loaded with recumbent figures by the sculptors of the renaissance, are we to call, for instance, Michael Angelo's Dawn and Twilight, only the decorations of the sloping plinths of a tomb, or trace to a geometrical propriety the subsequent rule in Italy that no window could be properly complete for living people to look out of, without having two stone people sitting on the corners of it above? I have heard of charming young ladies occasionally, at very crowded balls, sitting on the stairs,--would you call them, in that case, only decorations of the construction of the staircase? ...|$|E

50|$|The {{duration}} of the Helical Camshaft is changed by moving the <b>outer</b> <b>shaft</b> of the coaxial arrangement in a lengthwise (or axial) direction. The helix angle of the Helical Camshaft is probably {{always going to be}} around 30 to 35 degrees. The helix angle has its origin in the width of the segment used (normally about 10 mm) and the 20-degree region of constant radius on the nose of the lobe (this usually measures about 7 mm in circumference). The diagonal split line across this area thus must generally be at about 35 degrees to the axis of the camshaft. This translates to a figure of around 3.5 (crankshaft) degrees per millimetre of axial movement. 30 mm of movement would give 105 degrees of duration change. Although the Helical Camshaft is capable of far more than this, it has been found in testing that this amount is sufficient for most purposes.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} {{reasonably}} determine the external load of outer freezing shaft wall, {{it is necessary}} to conduct interaction study between frozen soil wall and <b>outer</b> <b>shaft</b> wall. First, based on the characteristic of three-stage compressive deformation of foam board, a relational expression of such radial deformations as frozen soil wall, <b>outer</b> <b>shaft</b> wall, and foam board is established; then based on the homogeneous viscoelastic model of frozen soil wall, with the rigidity in different compression stages of foam board being regarded as a constant, an expression of deformation pressure is derived. According to the research conducted in combination with project examples, the foam board remarkably slowed down the increase in deformation pressure; for steady creep frozen soil wall, the final value of deformation pressure should be effectively reduced; for unsteady creep frozen soil wall, the final value of deformation pressure {{has nothing to do with}} the effect of foam board, and tends to be equal to the level external load of frozen soil wall.

30|$|Since {{the one-way}} clutch has maximum transmittable torque, the transmittable torque of the <b>outer</b> <b>shaft</b> {{is limited by}} torque {{capacity}} of the one-way clutch. However walking robots normally require high torque in one direction that gravity works, we deploy wire driven mechanism as the core shaft supports {{the direction of the}} gravity force.|$|E
30|$|The {{problem of}} using the wire driven {{mechanism}} is an elongation of a wire, which decreases mechanical bandwidth. Therefore {{to be able to}} adjust wire tension easily a co-axial tensioner shaft shown in Fig. 13 was devised as the input pulley. The co-axial tensioner shaft has a dual structure made up of a core shaft which passes {{through the center of the}} input axis pulley, and an <b>outer</b> <b>shaft</b> which covers the lower half. Each shaft is connected with a compact roller type one-way clutch (NTN: HF 0612, torque capacity 1.76  Nm). Due to the one-way clutch, the two shafts turn relative to each other only in the direction which increases wire tension, and thus it is possible to adjust tension of the wire by rotating one of the shafts. The wire which is wound to the core shaft transmit power directly to the motor, but the wire wound to the <b>outer</b> <b>shaft</b> transmit power via one-way clutch.|$|E
