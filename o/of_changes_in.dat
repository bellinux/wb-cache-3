5|$|AMPK {{probably}} {{also plays a}} role in increased peripheral insulin sensitivity, as metformin administration increases AMPK activity in skeletal muscle. AMPK is known to cause GLUT4 deployment to the plasma membrane, resulting in insulin-independent glucose uptake. Some metabolic actions of metformin do appear to occur by AMPK-independent mechanisms; the metabolic actions of metformin in the heart muscle can occur independent <b>of</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> AMPK activity and may be mediated by p38 MAPK- and PKC-dependent mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|After {{menstruation}} {{and directly}} {{under the influence of}} estrogen, the cervix undergoes a series <b>of</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> position and texture. During most of the menstrual cycle, the cervix remains firm, and is positioned low and closed. However, as ovulation approaches, the cervix becomes softer and rises to open in response to the higher levels of estrogen present. These changes are also accompanied by changes in cervical mucus, described below.|$|E

5|$|Between the 1810s and 1850s {{there were}} a series <b>of</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> {{ownership}} and management. These coincided with a Puritan revival and a fall in Bath's popularity; reductions in receipts were compounded by rising payments for actors from London. As a result, the theatre underwent financial crises and fell into a period of decline. Fortunes began to improve when James Henry Chute, who was {{the manager of the}} Bath Assembly Rooms and the son-in-law of the owner Mrs Macready, took over as the manager of the theatre and once again audiences began to rise.|$|E
5|$|Containing autobiographical themes, a {{majority}} of the album's lyrics came {{as the result of a}} series <b>of</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> her life: a recent annulment of her marriage to singer James DeBarge, severing her business affairs from her father and manager Joseph and the rest of the Jackson family, hiring the A executive John McClain as her new management, and her subsequent introduction to Jam and Lewis. The album has been praised by critics as both an artistic feat and as a personal testament of self-actualization. It has also been regarded as a template upon which numerous female artists have modeled their careers, particularly black women.|$|E

Sample firms are divided into two groups: firms with informative <b>change</b> <b>in</b> inventory, and other firms. Analyses then are performed to examine the association between stock price and earnings. Results consistently show that the association is higher for firms with informative <b>change</b> <b>in</b> inventory. Thus, knowledge on the informativeness <b>of</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> inventory is useful for firm valuation.

5|$|During early pregnancy, type 1 lobules {{quickly become}} type 2 lobules because <b>of</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> {{estrogen}} and progesterone levels. Maturing into type 3 and then reaching full differentiation as type 4 lobules requires {{an increase of}} human placental lactogen (hPL) which occurs {{in the last few}} months of pregnancy. According to the abortionbreast cancer hypothesis, if an abortion were to interrupt this sequence then it could leave a higher ratio of type 2 lobules than existed prior to the pregnancy. Russo and Russo have shown that mature breast cells have more time for DNA repair with longer cell cycles, accounting for the slightly reduced risk of breast cancer for parous women against the baseline risk for women who have never conceived and those who have conceived and terminated their pregnancies.|$|E
5|$|For visual course control, flies' optic {{flow field}} is {{analyzed}} {{by a set}} of motion-sensitive neurons. A subset of these neurons is thought to be involved in using the optic flow to estimate the parameters of self-motion, such as yaw, roll, and sideward translation. Other neurons are thought to be involved in analyzing the content of the visual scene itself, such as separating figures from the ground using motion parallax. The H1 neuron is responsible for detecting horizontal motion across the entire visual field of the fly, allowing the fly to generate and guide stabilizing motor corrections midflight with respect to yaw. The ocelli are concerned in the detection <b>of</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> light intensity, enabling the fly to react swiftly to the approach of an object.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{there have}} been {{cyclical}} ice ages in which glacial sheets periodically covered the higher latitudes of the continents. Ice ages may occur because <b>of</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> ocean circulation and continentality induced by plate tectonics. The Milankovitch theory predicts that glacial periods occur during ice ages because of astronomical factors in combination with climate feedback mechanisms. The primary astronomical drivers are a higher than normal orbital eccentricity, a low axial tilt (or obliquity), and the alignment of summer solstice with the aphelion. Each of these effects occur cyclically. For example, the eccentricity changes over time cycles of about 100,000 and 400,000 years, with the value ranging from less than 0.01 up to 0.05. This is equivalent to a change of the semiminor axis of the planet's orbit from 99.95% of the semimajor axis to 99.88%, respectively.|$|E

5|$|KFC {{was one of}} {{the first}} American fast food chains to expand internationally, opening outlets in Canada, the United Kingdom, Mexico, and Jamaica by the mid-1960s. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, it {{experienced}} mixed fortunes domestically, as it went through a series <b>of</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> corporate ownership with little or no experience in the restaurant business. In the early 1970s, KFC was sold to the spirits distributor Heublein, which was taken over by the R.J. Reynolds food and tobacco conglomerate; that company sold the chain to PepsiCo. The chain continued to expand overseas, however, and in 1987, it became the first Western restaurant chain to open in China. It has since expanded rapidly in China, which is now the company's single largest market. PepsiCo spun off its restaurants division as Tricon Global Restaurants, which later changed its name to Yum! Brands.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{investigate}} {{the association between}} four sociodemographic measures (unemployment, overcrowding, low social class, {{and the proportion of}} migrants from areas of high prevalence of tuberculosis) and average level and rate <b>of</b> <b>change</b> <b>of</b> notification rates for tuberculosis. DESIGN [...] Ecological analysis of both the average and the rate <b>of</b> <b>change</b> <b>of</b> standardised annual notification rates for tuberculosis from 1982 - 91 and sociodemographic measures from the 1981 and 1991 censuses. SETTING [...] 32 London boroughs. SUBJECTS AND DATA [...] Sociodemographic measures from the 1981 and 1991 censuses and tuberculosis notification rates for 1982 - 91. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] A measure of the association between average levels and rate <b>of</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> tuberculosis notification rates and four sociodemographic measures in 1981 and between the rate <b>of</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> tuberculosis notification rates between 1981 and 1991 and <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> sociodemographic measures between 1981 and 1991. RESULTS [...] The average level of notifications was correlated with overcrowding and the proportion of migrants but not with unemployment or social class. No significant association was found between the rate <b>of</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> notification rates and sociodemographic measures in 1981. An association was found between increases in unemployment and the rate <b>of</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> notification rates, but the effect was small. <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> the levels <b>of</b> unemployment explained 23 % of the variation between boroughs <b>in</b> the rate <b>of</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> their notification rates. CONCLUSION [...] The average tuberculosis notification rates were related to overcrowding and the proportion of migrants in 1981. Only increases in unemployment from 1981 to 1991, however, were significantly associated with the rate <b>of</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> notifications over the same period...|$|R

5|$|M-106 {{is a state}} {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the Lower Peninsula of the US state of Michigan in and {{near the city of}} Jackson. M-106 travels in a southwest-to-northeast direction from Jackson to Gregory at a junction with M-36 just a few miles northwest of Hell. The highway was first designated in 1928 running north out of downtown Jackson. It connected U.S. Highway12 (US12) to the state prison and Bunkerhill Road. A pair <b>of</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> the early 1930s resulted in the extension eastward to Gregory.
