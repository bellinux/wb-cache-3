5|$|Baseball is a sport {{formerly}} contested at the Summer Olympic Games. It {{was originally}} played {{as a demonstration}} sport in seven Olympics—1912, 1936, 1952, 1956, 1964, 1984, and 1988— more than for any <b>other</b> <b>sport</b> in Olympic history. These exhibitions featured a single game at the first five Olympic appearances and then a tournament format in 1984 and 1988. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) granted baseball official status on October 13, 1986, for the 1992 Summer Olympics.

5|$|Since the {{favourite}} {{sport for}} the people of Calcutta was the game of football, Ganguly was initially attracted to the game. However, academics came in-between his love for sports and Nirupa was not very supportive of Ganguly taking up cricket or any <b>other</b> <b>sport</b> as a career. By then, his elder brother Snehasish was already an established cricketer for the Bengal cricket team. He supported Ganguly's dream to be a cricketer and asked their father to get Ganguly enrolled in a cricket coaching camp during his summer holidays. Ganguly was studying in tenth grade at that time.|$|E

5|$|Chesbro's 1904 {{record for}} games {{won in a}} season (41 wins) has stood for over a century—one of the oldest major records in baseball, or in any <b>other</b> <b>sport.</b> Under current playing practices, his record is unbreakable. Chesbro started 51 games that season (plus 4 relief appearances) and pitched 48 {{complete}} games, for a record of 41–12. Today, it is uncommon for a pitcher to start even 35 games in a season and complete games are a rarity. The only other 40-win season since 1900 was 40 by Ed Walsh in 1908, and only three other pitchers {{in the modern era}} have won as many as 35--Christy Mathewson (37 in 1908), Walter Johnson (36 in 1913) and Joe McGinnity (35 in 1904). Since the pitcher's mound was lowered to its current height of 10 inches in 1969, no pitcher has won more than 27 games in a season.|$|E
