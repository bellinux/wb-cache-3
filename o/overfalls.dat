40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{two methods}} are {{presented}} to analyse the free <b>overfall</b> in 1 -shaped (equilateral triangle-shaped) channels. First, the flow upstream {{of a free}} <b>overfall</b> from smooth horizontal or mildly sloping 1 -shaped channels is analysed theoretically to determine the end-depth-ratio (EDR), applying the momentum equation based on the Boussinesq approximation. Second, an alternate method for analysing free <b>overfall</b> in 1 -shaped channels is also presented where the flow over a free <b>overfall</b> in a 1 -shaped channel is simulated by that over a sharp-crested weir to calculate the EDR. The method of estimation of discharge from the known end depth is also presented for both the methods. These approaches eliminate the need of an experimentally determined pressure coefficient. Experiments are conducted to verify the results obtained from the present methods. Comparisons of the computed and experimental results are satisfactory...|$|R

The main parameter of such structures is its discharge capacity depending on <b>overfall</b> coefficient, dimensions of spillway, gravitational constant and height of overflowing water jet. The aim of investigation was the mathematical derivation of formula for calculation of <b>overfall</b> coefficient for sharp-crested spillway from observed data. The problem was solved {{with the aid of}} statistical method of nonlinear regression analysis, Gauss-Newton algorithm (nonlinear least squares).

Furayj, who had never passed that way, engaged as guide one Sulaym el-Makrafi; and this old dromedary-rider's son had been sent on to bring into camp all the Fayruz he could find. Crossing at six a.m. the broad pilgrim-track, we struck eastward {{at a place where}} the Secondary gypsum subtends the old coralline cliff. After three-quarters of an hour, we traversed the Wady Zahakán, the southernmost Pass over the Shárr (proper); and presently we ascended a branch that falls into the right bank. As we advanced, it became a rock-walled, stonesoled tunnel; winding, contracting and widening, rising and flattening, and generally interesting, compared with the dull flat breadth of such features as the Wady Salmá. The <b>overfalls</b> of rock and the unfriendly thorn-trees, selfishly taking up all the room, necessitate frequent zigzags up and down the rocky, precipitous banks.

40|$|The most {{classic example}} of a {{hydraulic}} structure where gas transfer occurs is a weir. Transfer of gases between the atmosphere and river water can occur in a free <b>overfall</b> jet from a weir. A free <b>overfall</b> jet from a weir plunging into down-stream water causes entrainment of air bubbles if the free <b>overfall</b> jet velocity exceeds the critical value where aeration occurs. This paper investigates the free <b>overfall</b> jets from Venturi and rectangular notch weirs and their effect on air entrainment rate. A Venturi weir was placed at the upstream channel end {{in order to increase}} the flow velocity of the free <b>overfall</b> jet and, in turn, to increase air entrainment. It was demonstrated that the air entrainment rate of the Venturi weir is significantly better than the rectangular notch weir, and this advantage becomes more pronounced as the throat width of the Venturi weir is decreased. These results demonstrated that Venturi weirs can be used as highly effective aerators in streams, rivers, constructed channels, fish hatcheries, water treatment plants, etc. Moreover, a regression equation was obtained for the Venturi weirs, relating air entrainment rate to unit discharge, weir crest width, drop height and throat width of Venturi weir. There was good agreement between the measured air entrainment rates and the values computed from the predictive equation. Key words: air entrainment rate, aeration, jet expansion, Venturi, wei...|$|R

A free <b>overfall</b> jet from a weir plunging into downstream water causes entrainment of the air bubbles if the free <b>overfall</b> jet velocity exceeds a certain critical value and hence aeration occurs. This paper investigates the free <b>overfall</b> jets from triangular sharp−crested weirs and their effect on the air entrainment rate and the aeration efficiency. The artificial neural network models, multi nonlinear and linear regression equations were obtained for the triangular sharp−crested weirs relating the air entrainment rate and the aeration efficiency to drop height, discharge, and angle in triangular sharp−crested weir. There were good agreements between the measured values and the values obtained using the artificial neural network and multi nonlinear regression models...|$|R

40|$|REFINEMENTS are {{constantly}} being introduced in the methods of measuring flowing water. In recent years, many {{attempts have been made}} to avoid the necessity of calibrating each individual measuring device, by utilizing the principle of critical depth for parallel flow. Unfortunately, in the critical-depth meters thus far devised, it has been impossible to prevent the apparent control section from shifting indeterminately upstream or downstream as the discharge varies, and so the need for experimentally determined coefficients has not yet been eliminated. In the present article Dr. Rouse points out the possibility of using the free <b>overfall</b> as a flow meter which needs no calibration. Although the flow at the <b>overfall</b> is not parallel, the crest section is that of true minimum energy and hence is the actual control section. Furthermore, the crest depth is a constant percentage of the computed critical depth for parallel flow. Dr. Rouse's analysis has been verified by experiment, and should provide a dependable and simple means of determining discharge at points of <b>overfall...</b>|$|R
