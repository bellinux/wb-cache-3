5|$|Arsenal lost to league champions Chelsea in the 2005 FA Community Shield at the Millennium Stadium. An {{indifferent}} {{start in}} the league saw Arsenal peak in second position after 13 matches, but a run of three consecutive defeats a month later had effectively ruled them out <b>of</b> <b>title</b> contention. On the final day, they beat Wigan Athletic 4–2 at Highbury; Tottenham Hotpsur's defeat at West Ham United meant Arsenal secured fourth place. The team's performances in Europe were more striking; they eliminated Real Madrid, Juventus and Villarreal in the knockout stages. In the 2006 UEFA Champions League Final held at the Stade de France in Paris on 17 May 2006, goalkeeper Jens Lehmann was sent off for a professional foul on Barcelona's Samuel Eto'o.

5|$|Constantine, son of Áed (Medieval Gaelic: Constantín mac Áeda; Modern Gaelic: Còiseam mac Aoidh, {{known in}} most modern regnal lists as Constantine II; died 952) {{was an early}} King of Scotland, known then by the Gaelic name Alba. The Kingdom of Alba, a name which first appears in Constantine's lifetime, was {{situated}} in modern day Scotland. The core of the kingdom was formed by the lands around the River Tay. Its southern limit was the River Forth, northwards it extended towards the Moray Firth and perhaps to Caithness, while its western limits are uncertain. Constantine's grandfather Kenneth I of Scotland (Cináed mac Ailpín, died 858) {{was the first of}} the family recorded as a king, but as king of the Picts. This change <b>of</b> <b>title,</b> from king of the Picts to king of Alba, is part of a broader transformation of Pictland and the origins of the Kingdom of Alba are traced to Constantine's lifetime.|$|E

UM combined the separate Dean of Men and Dean of Women positions in 1971. In 1971, UM formed a Women's Commission which issued a 1974 report {{on the status of}} women on campus. The result was UM's first female commencement speaker, day care, and a Women's Study minor. Following the enactment <b>of</b> <b>Title</b> IX in 1972, and decades of litigation, all organizations, including honorary societies were open to women. The Women's Commission also sought more equitable funding for women's sports.

5|$|In the Roman empire's {{hierarchical}} system, a vassal king {{usage of}} the King of Kings title did not indicate {{that he is a}} peer of the emperor or that the vassalage ties were cut. The title was probably a challenge not to the Roman emperor but to Shapur I; Odaenathus was declaring that he, not the Persian monarch, was the legitimate King of Kings in the East. A lead token depicting Hairan I shows him wearing a crown shaped like that of the Parthian monarchs, so it must have been Odaenathus' crown; this combination <b>of</b> <b>title</b> and imagery indicate that Odaenathus considered himself the rival of the Sassanians and the protector of the region against them.|$|E
5|$|It thus {{appears that}} prior to the cession the Mexican authorities, upon examination, found that the Indians had {{abandoned}} the land; that the only adverse claim was vested in the mission of San Diego and made an absolute grant, subject only to the condition of satisfying whatever claims the mission might have. How can it be said therefore that when the cession was made by Mexico to the United States there was a present recognition by the Mexican government of the occupancy of these Indians? On the contrary, so far as any official action is disclosed, it was distinctly to the contrary, and carried with it an affirmation that they had abandoned their occupancy, and that whatever <b>of</b> <b>title</b> there was outside of the Mexican nation was in the mission, and an absolute grant was made subject only {{to the rights of}} such mission.|$|E

5|$|Nintendo's {{attorney}} (and future board member) Howard Lincoln was {{at first}} inclined to settle for $5–7 million. Eventually, however, he decided to fight, reassuring {{the head of the}} company's U.S. division, Minoru Arakawa, that this was a sign that Nintendo had made it big. On May 6, Arakawa and Lincoln met with Coleco and Universal in Los Angeles. Hadl reiterated his stance that Donkey Kong infringed Universal's rights to King Kong. Lincoln countered that Nintendo had discovered many unlicensed uses of King Kongs name and characters and that Universal's trademark on these was less than 10 years old. In private, Greenberg tried to persuade Nintendo to sign a licensing agreement; he had not told them that he had already done so. By the end of the meeting, Hadl agreed to send a chain <b>of</b> <b>title</b> to Nintendo regarding Universal's ownership of the King Kong name. When this failed to materialize in the next few weeks, Lincoln prodded Universal again. They responded with more demands for royalties.|$|E

Egyptian nationalist leader Saad Zaghlul maintained that the reason for the change <b>of</b> <b>title</b> from Sultan (equivalent to emperor) to the lesser title of King was because the British would not recognize an independent Egyptian ruler whose title was superior to their own monarch.|$|E
