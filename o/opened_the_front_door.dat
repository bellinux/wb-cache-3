500|$|In 1965, she <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> of Kenwood {{to see a}} man who [...] "looked like a tramp", {{but with}} her husband's features. He {{explained}} that he was Alfred Lennon, the father whom Lennon had supposedly not seen for years. Lennon was annoyed when he came home, telling {{her for the first time}} that his father had visited the NEMS office, Epstein's business, a few weeks before. Three years after the meeting in the NEMS office, Alfred Lennon (who was then 56 years old) turned up at Kenwood again with his fiancée, 19-year-old student Pauline Jones. He asked if the Lennons could give Pauline a job, so she was hired to help with Julian and the piles of Beatles' fan mail. Lennon's father and his fiancée then spent a few months living in the attic bedroom. During an interview at Kenwood with Evening Standard reporter Maureen Cleave, Lennon said, [...] "Here I am in my Hansel and Gretel house, famous and loaded, and I can't go anywhere. There's something else I'm going to do, only I don't know what it is, but I do know this isn't it for me".|$|E
2500|$|According to Ojeda's wife, Elma Beatriz Rosado Barbosa, {{as well as}} {{neighbor}} Héctor Reyes, it was the FBI {{agents who}} initiated the shooting at 3:00 pm. The Office of the Inspector General's report stated that an FBI agent detonated a non-lethal [...] "flash bang" [...] grenade outside the house as a diversionary tactic when the FBI approached the house, before any gunfire began, and that Rosado may have thought this explosion was gunfire initiated by the FBI. [...] The FBI press release, however, claims that [...] "as the FBI agents approached {{the front of the}} farm house at approximately 4:28 p.m., [...] Ojeda Ríos <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> to the residence and opened fire on the FBI agents. In response to the gunfire from Ojeda Ríos, the FBI returned fire and established a defensive perimeter in order to contain the environment." ...|$|E
2500|$|In September 1997, {{their third}} LP, Meet the Family, was released, which reached the top40 on the ARIA Albums Chart and became their first {{certified}} gold album by ARIA. It spawned three singles, [...] "Mr Charisma" [...] (June), [...] "There's Your Dad" [...] (September), and [...] "Mum Changed the Locks" [...] (April 1998). The latter title refers to McDougall telling his mother {{he was going}} out to a movie when leaving for an interstate tour and returning to find his key no longer <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door.</b> Also in April, Gordon [...] "Gordy" [...] Forman replaced Nykyruj on drums, and they toured Australia with US ska band Blue Meanies. Frenzal Rhomb were the head-liners for the Australian leg of the 1998 Vans Warped Tour and they were recruited for the US edition. A 1998 version of Meet the Family contained a bonus disc, Mongrel, that was recorded live on this US leg.|$|E

2500|$|The {{prosecution}} {{believed it}} had a strong case {{despite the lack of}} known witnesses to the crime and the failure to recover the murder weapon. Clark's case was supported by DNA evidence, and she expected a conviction. From the physical evidence that was collected, the prosecution claimed that Simpson drove to Nicole Brown's house on the evening of June 12 with the intention of killing her. They maintained that Brown had put their two children to bed and was {{getting ready to go to}} bed herself when she <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> of her house after either responding to a knock on the front door or hearing a noise outside. Simpson allegedly grabbed her before she could scream and attacked her with a knife. Forensic evidence from the Los Angeles County coroner alleged that Ron Goldman arrived at the front gate to the townhouse sometime during the assault, and the assailant apparently attacked him and stabbed him repeatedly in the neck and chest with one hand while restraining him with an arm choke-hold. Brown was found lying face down when authorities arrived at the crime scene. According to the prosecution's account, after Simpson had finished with Goldman, he pulled Brown's head back using her hair, put his foot on her back, and slit her throat with the knife, severing her carotid artery. They argued further that Simpson left a [...] "trail of blood" [...] from the condo to the alley behind it; there was also testimony that three drops of Simpson's blood were found on the driveway near the gate to his house on Rockingham Drive.|$|E
