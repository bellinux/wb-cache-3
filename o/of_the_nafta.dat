It spans the St. Clair River, which connects Lake Huron to Lake St. Clair. The bridge's original three-lane span, opened in 1938, was twinned on 22 July 1997, making the bridge the fourth busiest border crossing in Ontario. The Blue Water Bridge border crossing makes use of both the NEXUS (frequent traveler program) and the Free and Secure Trade (FAST) program.

Reportedly Goolsbee was reassuring the Canadians that Obama's comments on potentially renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) were more political rhetoric than actual policy. The accuracy of these reports has been debated by both the Obama campaign and the Canadian Government.

40|$|Excerpt] The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) {{has been}} in effect since January 1, 1994. NAFTA was signed by President George H. W. Bush on December 17, 1992, and {{approved}} by Congress on November 20, 1993. <b>The</b> <b>NAFTA</b> Implementation Act {{was signed into law}} by President William J. Clinton on December 8, 1993 (P. L. 103 - 182). NAFTA continues to be of interest to Congress because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> Canada and Mexico as trading partners, and because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> implications <b>NAFTA</b> has for U. S. trade policy under <b>the</b> Administration <b>of</b> President Donald J. Trump. During his election campaign, President Trump stated his desire to renegotiate NAFTA and that he would examine <b>the</b> ramifications <b>of</b> withdrawing from <b>the</b> agreement once he entered into office. He has also raised <b>the</b> possibility <b>of</b> imposing tariffs or a border tax on products from Mexico. This report provides an overview of North American market-opening provisions prior to <b>NAFTA,</b> provisions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> agreement, economic effects, and policy considerations...|$|R

40|$|Introduction]. Based on <b>the</b> {{experiences}} <b>of</b> regionalization {{and integration}} processes, this paper identifies the main transformations North America has undergone {{as a result}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> implementation <b>of</b> <b>NAFTA.</b> <b>The</b> main argument is that <b>the</b> operation <b>of</b> <b>NAFTA</b> has {{set in motion a}} process of regionalization in North America and gradually an increasing number of policies encompass a regional dimension. In such process, the pivotal actor is the United States, while Canada and Mexico are reactive partners who seek to defend their domestic interests as well as accommodate themselves in the regional dynamic led by the United States. The emerging regionalism in North America reflects that NAFTA has accomplished some of its goals. Nonetheless, there is an ongoing discussion with regard to <b>the</b> expanded agenda <b>of</b> <b>the</b> region and several proposals have been brought to the academic and political debate. In this regard, five main sections are considered to asses <b>the</b> regionalization <b>of</b> North America. <b>The</b> first introduces some analytical elements about the regionalization in North America; the second shows perceptions of public opinion with regard to the regional agenda; the third refers to <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> <b>NAFTA,</b> while <b>the</b> fourth evaluates the Security and Prosperity Partnership (SSP) Summits.
