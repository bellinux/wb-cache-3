5|$|By 1912, Sadler and his wife, both doctors by then, {{operated}} a joint practice in Chicago that catered to children's and women's health issues. Sadler initially focused on surgery, performing surgeries with his wife, but widened his practice to include psychiatric counseling in 1930 {{and became a}} consulting psychiatrist at Columbus Hospital. As a psychiatrist, Sadler advocated {{an eclectic mix of}} techniques, applying the theories of Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, Alfred Adler, and Adolf Meyer. Sadler believed that religious faith was beneficial to mental health, and specifically promoted prayer, which he believed to be most effective in the context <b>of</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>faith.</b> However, he thought that religious beliefs were deleterious to mental health if based on fear.|$|E

A cleric from Wrocław, Nicholas, taught him the basic principles <b>of</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>faith.</b> However, Louis's religious zeal was due to his mother's influence. In a royal charter, Louis remembered that in his childhood, a knight of the royal court, Peter Poháros, often carried him on his shoulders. His two tutors, Nicholas Drugeth and Nicholas Knesich, saved the lives of both Louis and his younger brother, Andrew, when Felician Záh attempted to assassinate the royal family in Visegrád on 17 April 1330.|$|E

25|$|It is a tenet <b>of</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>faith</b> (Roman Catholic, Orthodox and Protestant) that God is {{the creator}} of all things from nothing, and has made human beings in the Image of God, who by direct {{inference}} is also {{the source of the}} human soul.

25|$|Justification is {{the part}} of {{salvation}} where God pardons the sin of those who believe in Christ.

People are not on their own able even to fully repent of their sin or prepare themselves to repent because of their sinfulness. Therefore, justification is held to arise solely from God's free and gracious act.|$|E

Campus worship night is a voluntary praise and reflection time held every Wednesday night. Students also hold a Taizé prayer service once a month on Sunday nights at 9:00. Because service is an important aspect <b>of</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>faith,</b> volunteerism ties in with spiritual life on campus.|$|E

25|$|Roman Catholicism was {{the sole}} {{established}} religion in the Holy Roman Empire until the Reformation changed this drastically. In 1517, Martin Luther challenged the Catholic Church {{as he saw it}} as a corruption <b>of</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>faith.</b> Through this, he altered the course of European and world history and established Protestantism. The Thirty Years' War (1618–1648) {{was one of the most}} destructive conflicts in European history. The war was fought primarily in what is now Germany, and at various points involved most of the countries of Europe. The war was fought largely as a religious conflict between Protestants and Catholics in the Holy Roman Empire.|$|E
25|$|Some scholars, such as Carsten Peter Thiede, dispute this presentation. Early Christian leaders did {{not have}} to visit Qumran to have heard of Essene beliefs and read their texts. The various Jewish groups, {{including}} Christians and Essenes, were interconnected and simultaneously adopted some practices and beliefs while rejecting others. While some similarities exist, there are many differences and similar parallels can be also drawn between the early Christians and Pharisees, and other Jewish sects. Many features <b>of</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>faith</b> have no parallels in the texts from Qumran, and some that do are fundamentally distinct from Essene practices and beliefs. Notably, John's act of penitent baptism bears little resemblance to the daily baptismal ritual of the Essenes.|$|E
25|$|The Roman Catholic and {{particularly}} the Orthodox Churches have traditionally defended the use of icons. The debate on what images signify and whether reverence {{with the help of}} icons in church is equivalent to idolatry has lasted for many centuries, particularly from the 7th century until the Reformation in the 16th century. These debates have supported the inclusion of icons of Jesus Christ, the Virgin Mary, and the Apostles, the iconography expressed in stained glass, regional saints and other symbols <b>of</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>faith.</b> It has also supported the practices such as the Catholic mass, the reverential use of the bread and the wine as representations of Jesus' body and blood, burning of candles before pictures, Christmas decorations and celebrations, and festive or memorial processions with statues of religious significance to Christianity.|$|E

25|$|Christians in {{the early}} {{communities}} of the Church obtained forgiveness for those sins by practising prayer, good deeds, fasting and alms-giving. This early way of penitential discipline received in modern times the name of public penance, mistakenly confused with public announcement of the excommunication because of a public and grave sin. Sometimes sinners did publicly speak about their sins, but testimonies of the early Church show that in most cases offences were known to the priest alone. When a penitent did publicly confess his/her sins, decision to do it was always by the private initiative of the person, a free act <b>of</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>faith</b> for spiritual motives. The public character of early penance should be understood as prayerful participation and support given by the community to a sinner, and not as public humiliation.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{of these}} active {{interventions}} into Nubian affairs, the Mameluks also {{put a lot}} pressure on the Christians inside their borders. The patriarch of Alexandria was forced to cancel the dispatchment of priests to Alwa, which was problematic, since Alodia, like the other Coptic nations of Africa, was dependent upon Egyptian bishops. The consequential deterioration <b>of</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>faith</b> is attested by Portuguese sources from the early 16th century. A traveller and companion of Francisco Álvares, who visited Nubia in around 1500, states that the Nubians considered themselves Christian, but were so lacking in Christian instruction {{that they had no}} actual knowledge of the faith. In 1520, Nubian ambassadors reached Ethiopia and asked the emperor for priests. They claimed that no more priests could reach Nubia because of wars between Muslims, leading to a decline of Christianity in their land.|$|E
25|$|The Catholicon – On {{the east}} side {{opposite}} the Rotunda is the Crusader structure housing the main altar of the Church, today the Greek Orthodox catholicon. The second, smaller dome sits directly over {{the centre of the}} transept crossing of the choir where the compas, an omphalos once thought {{to be the center of}} the world (associated to the site of the Crucifixion and the Resurrection), is situated. Since 1996 this dome is topped by the monumental Golgotha Crucifix which the Greek Patriarch Diodoros I of Jerusalem consecrated. It was at the initiative of Gustav Kühnel to erect a new crucifix at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem that would not only be worthy of the singularity of the site, but that would also become a symbol of the efforts of unity in the community <b>of</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>faith.</b>|$|E
