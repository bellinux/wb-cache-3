40|$|OBJECTIVES: Previous work {{suggests}} <b>oritavancin</b> may be inhibitory to Clostridium difficile spores. We have {{evaluated the}} effects of <b>oritavancin</b> exposure on C. difficile spore germination, outgrowth and recovery. METHODS: Germination and outgrowth of C. difficile spores exposed to different concentrations of <b>oritavancin,</b> vancomycin, or metronidazole (0. 1 - 10 mg/L) were monitored at 0, 2, 4, 6, 24 and 48 h using phase-contrast microscopy. Recovery of antimicrobial-exposed spores was determined by viable counting on Brazier's modified CCEYL agar. Persistence of <b>oritavancin</b> activity on spores after washing was determined by measuring activity against a Staphylococcus aureus lawn. RESULTS: <b>Oritavancin,</b> vancomycin and metronidazole exposure did not prevent germination of phase-bright spores to phase-dark spores, but did inhibit further outgrowth into vegetative cells. The inhibitory effect of <b>oritavancin</b> persisted after washing, whereas the inhibitory effects of vancomycin and metronidazole did not. <b>Oritavancin</b> exposure affected spore recovery; fewer spores were recovered after washing following <b>oritavancin</b> exposure than vancomycin exposure. The extent of this effect was dependent on PCR ribotype, with recovery of ribotype 078 spores completely prevented, but recovery of ribotype 001 spores only slightly affected. Spores exposed to <b>oritavancin,</b> but not vancomycin, retained antimicrobial activity after washing, indicating adherence of <b>oritavancin,</b> but not vancomycin, to the spore surface CONCLUSIONS: <b>Oritavancin</b> may adhere to spores, potentially causing early inhibition of germinated cells, preventing subsequent vegetative outgrowth and spore recovery.

In two Phase III clinical trials involving a total of about 1800 patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSIs), i. v. <b>oritavancin</b> therapy was shown to have bactericidal activity and a safety profile comparable to those of i. v. vancomycin (plus optional oral cephalexin stepdown therapy) while requiring a significantly shorter duration of therapy; however, the compiled evidence was considered insufficient to justify marketing approval by the Food and Drug Administration,which requested additional safety and efficacy data.

Using vesicles prepared from lipids extracted from S. aureus, we showed that <b>oritavancin</b> induces holes, erosion of the edges, and decrease of the thickness of the supported lipid bilayers (atomic force microscopy; AFM). <b>Oritavancin</b> also induced an increase of membrane permeability (calcein release) on a time- and dose-dependent manner. These effects were probably related to the ability of the drug to bind to lipid bilayers as shown by 8 -anilino- 1 - naphthalene sulfonic acid (ANS) assay. Interaction of <b>oritavancin</b> with phospholipids {{at the level of the}}ir glycerol backbone and hydrophobic domain was studied by monitoring changes of Laurdan excitation generalized polarization (GPex) and 1, 6 -diphenyl- 1, 3, 5 -hexatriene (DPH) fluorescence anisotropy upon temperature increase. <b>Oritavancin</b> increased GPex values and the transition temperature, indicating a more ordered structure at the level of the glycerol backbone. <b>Oritavancin</b> slightly decreased DPH fluorescence depolarization intensities, suggesting an increase in fluidity at the level of acyl chains. Together, our data confirm the interaction of <b>oritavancin</b> with lipids and the potential role of a rigidifying effect at the level of glycerol backbone for membrane permeabilization. This work shows how AFM and biophysical methods may help in characterizing drug–membrane interactions, and sheds further light on the mode of action of <b>oritavancin...</b>|$|E

In this study, we demonstrate that <b>oritavancin</b> causes bacterial membrane depolarization and permeabilization leading to cell death of Gram-positive pathogens and that these effects are attributable to the 4 ′-chlorobiphenylmethyl group of the molecule...|$|E
