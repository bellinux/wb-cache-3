5|$|It is Christmas in Bikini Bottom and Plankton is {{miserable and}} angry for {{committing}} so many naughty deeds, {{that he always}} gets on Santa's naughty list, making him unable to receive his Christmas wishthe Krusty Krab's Krabby Patty secret formula. However, he discovers Jerktonium, a dangerous chemical element {{which serves as a}} trap for the citizens of Bikini Bottom and is capable of turning anyone into a jerk. He cooks it into fruitcakes that he intends to feed to all the Bikini Bottomites and turn them into jerks. In order to test it, Plankton gives SpongeBob a slice, but nothing seems to work on SpongeBob, who is immune to Jerktonium because of the combination of his small brain and his very big heart. Increasingly infuriated that his plan has seemingly failed completely to suffice, Plankton gives his fruitcake dispenser to SpongeBob, who promptly distributes the fruitcakes to all of Bikini Bottom and transforms all the residents into jerks. After realizing that the element works only <b>on</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> in Bikini Bottom instead and that SpongeBob is so full of Christmas spirit that he is immune to jerktonium, Plankton is forced to send out an evil wind-up robot version of SpongeBob to commit troublesome deeds to frame the real SpongeBob.|$|E
25|$|When {{it turned}} out that the {{prosecutors}} were slow to continue the Klongchan lawsuit with regard to Luang Por Dhammajayo, the DSI and several other police departments started to press charges <b>on</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> related to the temple. To further pressurize Luang Por Dhammajayo, the DSI also expanded its focus to branch centers of Wat Phra Dhammakaya. Branch centers in Nakhon Ratchasima, Chiangmai, Kanchanaburi, Loei, and Tak were investigated and charged with encroaching on nature reserves. On 21 November, this finally led to another two arrest warrants, totaling three, and plans were made by the Thai police, and the DSI to take Luang Por Dhammajayo into custody, through force if required.|$|E
25|$|On 11 December 1998, Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew {{responded to}} a gay man's {{question}} about the place of homosexuals in Singapore, live on CNN International by saying, '...what we are doing as a government is to leave people to live their own lives {{so long as they}} don't impinge <b>on</b> <b>other</b> <b>people.</b> I mean, we don't harass anybody.' Given Lee's stature as the venerated albeit authoritarian founding father of independent Singapore, these words helped set the tenor for official policy on homosexuality for many years to come.

She relocated to Los Angeles, and started auditioning for jobs. She initially found the process difficult, which she blamed <b>on</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> finding her difficult to categorize as a redhead with an unconventional look. In her television debut, The WB network's 2004 pilot remake of the 1960s gothic soap opera Dark Shadows, she was cast as Carolyn Stoddard. The pilot was directed by P. J. Hogan, but the series was never picked up for broadcast. [...] Later that year, she appeared as a guest performer on the medical drama series ER [...] playing a woman she described as [...] "psychotic", which led to her getting more unusual parts such as accident victims or the mentally ill.

2500|$|In other texts, {{the term}} paṇḍaka can include those born sexually {{indeterminate}} or with no sex, eunuchs, those whose impotence changes every half month, males who gain sexual potency by absorbing other men's semen, or spying <b>on</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> [...] having sex. It sometimes includes males or females with any sexual dysfunction, such as impotence or irregular menstrual cycles. The common element {{seems to be}} those whose sexuality is either limited physiologically, or those who are sexually impotent. Together these impotence types are almost always portrayed negatively as a pariah class, especially in the earliest texts. In modern contexts, paṇḍaka is sometimes wrongly interpreted to include lesbians, gay men, and transgender and intersex people, although in ancient times, a man who sexually penetrated another man or a paṇḍaka was not himself considered a paṇḍaka.|$|E

[...] During {{the course of his}} long career, for example, he performed some seventeen thousand inguinal hernia repairs and over seven thousand orchidopexies (surgery for correcting undescended testicle). [...] He developed new procedures, such as the colon interposition graft for correcting esophageal atresia (congenital lack of continuity of the esophagus) or ventriculoperitoneal shunts for treatment of hydrocephalus (accumulation of excessive cerebral spinal fluid in and around the brain causing neurological problems). [...] He also tackled many difficult cases ranging from childhood cancer to surgeries done on conjoined twins, of which he and his colleagues operated upon ten pairs during his 35-year tenure. [...] In all he operated on many children and babies with congenital defects 'incompatible with life but amenable to surgical correction'.|$|E

And in the constant hardships, disappointments, failures and dead-ends it deals out to its characters, who stick to their dreams to the point of alienating everyone close to them, it’s not unlike the more recent Inside Llewyn Davis, which also rendered artistic practice as a kind of masochism."

Smith asked whether raising a Nazi flag during the Second World War would have elicited a similar response.

Vidal then interjected that [...] "the only sort of pro- or crypto-Nazi I can think of is yourself," [...] whereupon Smith interjected, [...] "Now let's not call names." [...] Buckley, visibly angered, rose several inches from his seat and replied, [...] "Now listen, you queer, stop calling me a crypto-Nazi or I'll sock you in your goddamn face, and you'll stay plastered." [...] Buckley later apologized in print for having called Vidal a [...] "queer" [...] in a burst of anger rather than in a clinical context, but also reiterated his distaste for Vidal as an [...] "evangelist for bisexuality": [...] "The man who in his essays proclaims the normalcy of his affliction, and in his art the desirability of it, is {{not to be confused with}} the man who bears his sorrow quietly.
