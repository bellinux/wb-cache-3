40|$|In electrofishing it {{is usually}} assumed that the {{abundance}} of fish at a site {{is strongly dependent on}} habitat type. In practice the yearly choices of sites are not perfectly representative of the distribution of habitat types in a river, so a bias is introduced into density estimates based on the <b>observed</b> <b>densities.</b> However, it is assumed that this bias is time-invariant, allowing the use of <b>observed</b> <b>densities</b> as relative values. In this work we study whether this is so using a general information-theoretic methodology in a probabilistic framework. Our methodology allows measuring the similarity of pre-existing biological knowledge and an empirical model learned from a set of new observations. It also enables a separate study of habitat sampling bias and habitat [...] abundance relationship over a time series. Given a set of restrictions on the eligibility of sites, as is usually the case in electrofishing, bias-minimal selections of sites to electrofish can also be provided. In our empirical studies we test our methodology on real-world data sets from two Gulf of Bothnia rivers, consisting of expert-made habitat site classifications coupled with observational electrofishing data on salmon. Our approach is general in the sense that there are no restrictions on the nature or construction method of the probabilistic models used. Furthermore, our methodology compares the models directly, instead of comparing artificial data sets generated using them. 1...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Aerial {{surveys were}} {{conducted}} during late May and early June 1996 – 99 {{in the central}} Beaufort Sea of Alaska, using strip-transect methods. The purpose of these surveys was to quantify and model the effects of environmental covariates on ringed seal counts and to provide density estimates that would be useful for evaluating trends in seal abundance. Total survey effort included 40 – 88 transect lines per year covering 1198 – 2701 km 2. <b>Observed</b> <b>densities</b> ranged from 0. 81 seals/km 2 in 1996 to 1. 17 seals/km 2 in 1999. We {{examined the effects of}} habitat, weather, and time of day on <b>observed</b> seal <b>densities,</b> using univariate chi-square goodness-of-fit tests. We also used a multivariate generalized linear model to estimate the relationship between seal counts and covariates. Three habitat-related variables—water depth, location relative to the fast ice edge, and ice deformation—had substantial and consistent effects. The highest densities occurred at depths between 5 and 35 m. Densities were also highest in relatively flat ice and near the fast ice edge, declining both shoreward and seaward of that edge. Univariate analysis suggested that <b>observed</b> <b>densities</b> were generally highest at about 1200 h Alaska daylight time, but time was not a significant variable in the generalized linear models. Analyses of the effects of weather factors on seal counts were inconclusive. This was likely at least partially because temperature and wind speed were measured at survey altitude, rather than on the ice surface, and surveys were conducted only in weather considered suitable for hauling out. The final multivariate model did not account for a substantial proportion of the variation in seal counts. We think this result was largely due to date-related variation in the proportion of seal...|$|R
5000|$|The {{magnetic}} monopole problem, {{sometimes called the}} exotic-relics problem, says that if the early universe were very hot, {{a large number of}} very heavy, stable {{magnetic monopole}}s would have been produced. This is a problem with Grand Unified Theories, which propose that at high temperatures (such as in the early universe) the electromagnetic force, strong, and weak nuclear forces are not actually fundamental forces but arise due to spontaneous symmetry breaking from a single gauge theory. These theories predict a number of heavy, stable particles that have not been observed in nature. The most notorious is the magnetic monopole, a kind of stable, heavy [...] "charge" [...] of magnetic field. Monopoles are predicted to be copiously produced following Grand Unified Theories at high temperature, and they should have persisted to the present day, {{to such an extent that}} they would become the primary constituent of the Universe. Not only is that not the case, but all searches for them have failed, placing stringent limits on the density of relic magnetic monopoles in the Universe. A period of inflation that occurs below the temperature where magnetic monopoles can be produced would offer a possible resolution of this problem: monopoles would be separated from each other as the Universe around them expands, potentially lowering their <b>observed</b> <b>density</b> by many orders of magnitude.
