5|$|So far {{the only}} {{close-up}} images of Titania {{have been from}} the Voyager 2 probe, which photographed the moon during its flyby of Uranus in January 1986. Since the closest distance between Voyager 2 and Titania was <b>only</b> , <b>the</b> <b>best</b> images of this moon have a spatial resolution of about 3.4 km (only Miranda and Ariel were imaged with a better resolution). The images cover about 40% of the surface, but only 24% was photographed with the precision required for geological mapping. At {{the time of the}} flyby, the southern hemisphere of Titania (like those of the other moons) was pointed towards the Sun, so the northern (dark) hemisphere could not be studied.|$|E
5|$|The Stanley {{opened on}} December 15, 1930. Originally envisioned as a {{vaudeville}} venue, {{it was built}} by Frederick Guest, owner of a chain of theatres in Ontario, who reportedly {{fell in love with}} Vancouver and decided to build his dream theatre there. He hired Henry Holdsby Simmonds as the architect, who designed it with a neoclassical interior and an Art Deco exterior, with seating for 1,216 people. In order to make as high quality a theatre as possible, Simmonds used <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> materials he could find, including tindle stone from Winnipeg and tiles from Italy, along with chandeliers, carpets and furnishings from local merchants. Like the Stanley Cup and Stanley Park, the theatre was named after Governor General of Canada Lord Stanley.|$|E

25|$|In the 1990s a sharp {{decrease}} in traffic {{led to a}} period of large surpluses when <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> wagons were used. Many of the worst were either scrapped or cannibalized to maintain the others. At the time of independence, the number of freight wagons in Kazakhstan {{was estimated to be}} 128,000. In 2001, the number was down to 78,000. Of those, at least 30% and probably more were out of service. About 43% of the remaining wagons were over 20 years old.|$|E
25|$|Examples are Brahmi numerals, Greek numerals, Hebrew numerals, Roman numerals, and Chinese numerals.

These difficulty were completely solved {{with the introduction of}} the Hindu–Arabic numeral system for representing integers. This system has been extended to represent some non-integer numbers, called decimal fractions or decimal numbers for forming the decimal numeral system.|$|E

Upon obtaining a position at a CIU/Squad, members must then complete the training package (preliminary portfolio of work and course attendance) at the School of Investigation (Detective Training School) to confirm their position as a qualified detective.

25|$|The Belgian medical {{education}} {{is much more}} based on theoretical knowledge than the Dutch system. In the first 3 years, which are very theoretical and lead to a university bachelor degree, general scientific courses are taken such as chemistry, biophysics, physiology, biostatistics, anatomy, virology, etc. To enter the bachelor course in Flanders, prospective students have to pass an exam, {{as a result of}} the numerus clausus. In the French-speaking part of Belgium, <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> students that pass the first year of the bachelor course in medicine are admitted to the second and third year.|$|E
25|$|The major {{advance in}} speed was made {{possible}} by the development of an approach for calculating the significance of results integrated over a range of possible alignments. In discovering remote homologs, alignments between query and hit proteins are often very uncertain. While most sequence alignment tools calculate match scores using <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> scoring alignment, HMMER3 calculates match scores by integrating across all possible alignments, to account for uncertainty in which alignment is best. HMMER sequence alignments are accompanied by posterior probability annotations, indicating which portions of the alignment have been assigned high confidence and which are more uncertain.|$|E

25|$|In 1939 Willis L. Teeter—who {{also worked}} for A, at its Mooresville, North Carolina store—and his brother Paul, who was also working for A {{borrowed}} $1,700 to open Teeter's Food Mart on Main Street in Mooresville, North Carolina. A was closing their doors and agreed to lease the location to the Teeter brothers. The first Teeter Food Mart opened on July 15, 1939. Teeter's was a family-run operation as Teeter was the manager, Paul (Bill), his brother was the produce manager and Teeter's wife, Sylvia, also worked at the store. Paul's wife, Mildred, also joined the staff as bookkeeper as the Teeter stores expanded. The Teeter brothers believed in exceptional customer service, even having home delivery service. Because of their foresight of providing great customer service and <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> products, they saw sales rise quickly. Teeter based all he would do on the Golden Rule—treat others as you would have them treat you.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{tentative}} agreement for a merger in Sweden, negotiations {{to create a}} European branch of SAS started on 1 December 1947. It was agreed that the SAS-brand was {{to be used to}} brand all international flights as SAS. European SAS (ESAS) was, unlike the transatlantic agreement, only a business agreement, whereby the three companies agreed to pool their flights and operate a single set of facilities abroad. Each company would close its own operations and offices in the other two Scandinavian countries, leaving that to the national airline. In all European cities, <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> office and employees would remain, rationalizing operations and presenting the three airlines' operations under a single brand. ESAS was launched on 18 April 1948, and was led by a main committee and had Viggo J. Rasmussen as director. The head office and operational center for ESAS was located at Copenhagen Airport, in part because of a long-term mechanics strike at Bromma. At the same time, the SAS consortium was internally named Overseas SAS (OSAS).|$|E
25|$|WZT-2 (Wóz Zabezpieczenia Technicznego - Armoured {{recovery}} vehicle) - Polish ARV {{built on}} T-55 hull. It {{was built to}} perform repairs on T-55 and T-55A tanks. When it entered service in 1973 it was not <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> ARV in the whole Warsaw Pact but probably in the whole world. It is still {{able to carry out}} tasks that NATO gives ARVs of its class. Unlike the T-55 and the WZT-1, the WZT-2 is still the basic ARV of the Polish army used for field repairs. It's able to perform repairs not only on Soviet tanks like the T-54/T-55 and T-72 but also on Polish PT-91 and German Leopard 2A4. However, because all tanks currently in Polish service weigh more than 40 tons it is unable to tow them. It is used to tow lighter vehicles like BWP-1 and 2S1. A total number of 600 was produced. 80 were in service as of 2004. Some are used by Ratownictwo Kolejowe (Railroad emergency respond services). Many have private owners who bought them from the Polish Army. 196 of these vehicles were also sold to India. The vehicles were also bought by Iraq and Yugoslavia.|$|E
