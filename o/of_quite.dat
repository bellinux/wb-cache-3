5|$|The Sistine Chapel is 40.9metres {{long and}} 14metres wide. The ceiling rises to 13.4metres above {{the main floor}} of the chapel. The vault is <b>of</b> <b>quite</b> a complex design and it is {{unlikely}} that it was originally intended to have such elaborate decoration. Pier Matteo d'Amelia provided a plan for its decoration with the architectural elements picked out and the ceiling painted blue and dotted with gold stars, {{similar to that of the}} Arena Chapel decorated by Giotto at Padua.|$|E

25|$|According to Victor Segalen's assessment, {{the early}} (Han and the Six Dynasties) stone {{tortoises}} were artistic images <b>of</b> <b>quite</b> real aquatic turtles. The creatures looked quite realistic through the Song dynasty, when huge tortoise pedestals, {{such as the}} ones in Shou Qiu near Qufu, or the one in Dai Miao at Mount Tai were erected.|$|E
25|$|Another play {{submitted}} to the Lord Chamberlain, London was Second sight: a tale of the Highlands in two acts, 1836. The original manuscript of this play is in the British Library.

His last great work, executed just before the outbreak of Fauvism in Paris, was the observation and photography of smoke trails.

25|$|The Theogony {{concerns}} {{the origins of}} the world (cosmogony) and of the gods (theogony), beginning with Chaos, Gaia, Tartarus and Eros, and shows a special interest in genealogy. Embedded in Greek myth, there remain fragments <b>of</b> <b>quite</b> variant tales, hinting at the rich variety of myth that once existed, city by city; but Hesiod's retelling of the old stories became, according to Herodotus, the accepted version that linked all Hellenes.|$|E
25|$|The {{format of}} the OEDs entries has {{influenced}} numerous other historical lexicography projects. The forerunners to the OED, such as the early volumes of the Deutsches Wörterbuch, had initially provided few quotations from {{a limited number of}} sources, whereas the OED editors preferred larger groups <b>of</b> <b>quite</b> short quotations from a wide selection of authors and publications. This influenced later volumes of this and other lexicographical works.|$|E

25|$|Some species produce winged {{females in}} the summer, {{sometimes}} in response to low food quality or quantity. The winged females migrate to start new colonies on a new plant, often <b>of</b> <b>quite</b> a different kind. For example, the apple aphid (Aphis pomi), after producing many generations of wingless females on its typical food plant, gives rise to winged forms which fly away and settle on grass or corn stalks.|$|E
25|$|Pine resin (sap) {{has been}} used by various tribes to {{waterproof}} baskets, pails, and boats. The Chippewa also used pine resin to successfully treat infections and even gangrenous wounds. This is because pine resin apparently has a number <b>of</b> <b>quite</b> efficient antimicrobials. Generally a wet pulp from the inner bark, or pine tar mixed with beeswax or butter was applied to wounds and used as a salve to prevent infection.|$|E
25|$|These {{are simple}} {{to put up}} for {{temporary}} or field use. But they are also widely used by radio amateurs and short wave listeners in fixed locations due to their simple (and inexpensive) construction, while still realizing a resonant antenna at frequencies where resonant antenna elements need to be <b>of</b> <b>quite</b> some size. They are an attractive solution for these frequencies when significant directionality is not desired, {{and the cost of}} several such resonant antennas for different frequency bands, built at home, may still be much less than a single commercially produced antenna.|$|E

25|$|Open {{clusters}} {{range from}} very sparse clusters {{with only a}} few members to large s containing thousands of stars. They usually consist <b>of</b> <b>quite</b> a distinct dense core, surrounded by a more diffuse 'corona' of cluster members. The core is typically about 3–4light years across, with the corona extending to about 20light years from the cluster centre. Typical star densities in the centre of a cluster are about 1.5 stars per cubic light year; the stellar density near the Sun is about 0.003 stars per cubic light year.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} known monument {{is a small}} terracotta {{found in}} Athens, with a dedication to Hecate, in writing of {{the style of the}} 6th century. The goddess is seated on a throne with a chaplet bound round her head; she is altogether without attributes and character, and the main historical value of this work, which is evidently <b>of</b> <b>quite</b> a general type and gets a special reference and name merely from the inscription, is that it proves the single shape to be her earlier form, and her recognition at Athens to be earlier than the Persian invasion.|$|E
25|$|The E.1 was {{a wooden}} {{aircraft}} with spruce frames and plywood covering. It was a mid-wing cantilever monoplane with straight, thick section, constant chord wings <b>of</b> <b>quite</b> high aspect ratio (8.45). The lateral division was at about 65% chord, with the rear part joined {{to the front}} with conspicuous V-shaped faired underwing hinges. In normal flight the two parts were close together and the rear sections acted both as lifting surface and, differentially, ailerons but they could also be lowered together as slotted flaps, moving rearwards as well as down to produce a slot between fore and aft parts.|$|E

25|$|Like most sans-serifs Akzidenz-Grotesk is 'monoline' in structure, {{with all}} strokes {{of the letter}} <b>of</b> <b>quite</b> similar width. This gives a sense of {{simplicity}} and an absence of the adornment and flourishes seen in many more decorative sans-serifs {{of the late nineteenth}} century influenced by the Art Nouveau style. Modern type designer Martin Majoor has described the general design of Akzidenz-Grotesk and its ancestors as similar in letterforms to the Didone serif fonts that were standard types in the nineteenth century, such as Didot and Walbaum. This is most visible in the quite folded-up apertures of letters such as ‘a’ and ‘c’.|$|E
25|$|The British Cemetery Montevideo (Cementerio Británico) {{is another}} of the oldest cemeteries in Uruguay, located in the Buceo neighborhood. Many noblemen and eminent persons are buried there. The {{cemetery}} originated when the Englishman Mr. Thomas Samuel Hood purchased a plot {{of land in the}} name of the English residents in 1828. However, in 1884 the government compensated the British by moving the cemetery to Buceo to accommodate city growth. A section of the cemetery, known as British Cemetery Montevideo Soldiers and Sailors, contains the graves <b>of</b> <b>quite</b> a number of sailors of different nationalities, although the majority are of British descent. One United States Marine, Henry de Costa, is buried here.|$|E
25|$|The {{institute}} {{specializes in}} language comprehension, language production, language acquisition, language and genetics, and {{the relation between}} language and cognition. Its mission is to undertake basic research into the psychological,social and biological foundations of language. The goal is to understand how human minds and brains process language, how language interacts with other aspects of mind, and how to learn languages <b>of</b> <b>quite</b> different types. The MPI for Psycholinguistics is a globally recognized center of linguistics and presents with its international archive of endangered languages {{a significant contribution to}} the preservation of the common heritage of mankind. This archive is sponsored since 2000 by the Volkswagen Foundation and offers on the internet about 50 projects.|$|E
