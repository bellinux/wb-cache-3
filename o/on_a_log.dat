5|$|Although the {{two sides}} were about even in number, Brant had won a {{lopsided}} victory. All of the Americans were killed or captured; none of Brant's men were injured. According to a detailed list prepared by Brant and sent to Detroit, 37 Americans were killed and 64 were captured. Some of the American dead—some sources say most—had been executed after surrendering. This included Lochry, who was sitting <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>log</b> after the battle when a Shawnee warrior killed him with a tomahawk blow to the head. According to some accounts, Brant prevented the Indians from killing even more of the prisoners. The dead were scalped and left unburied.|$|E
5|$|Madison {{served with}} the Kentucky militia during the Northwest Indian War. He was a {{subaltern}} in Arthur St. Clair's army in the American defeat at the Battle of the Wabash on November 4, 1791. During the retreat, a soldier named William Kennan found Madison sitting <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>log.</b> Kennan was being pursued by Indians and admonished Madison to run, but Madison, who was already known to be of frail constitution, stood to reveal {{that he had been}} badly wounded and was bleeding profusely. Kennan quickly retrieved an abandoned horse he had seen; he helped Madison astride the horse, and they both escaped.|$|E
5|$|On 23 June 2013, Shakira {{released}} a teaser {{of the commercial}} for the fragrance along with a photo of her posing with two cheetahs. A full version of the commercial was released later. It begins with Shakira, dressed in a dark burgundy gown, coming across a pair of cheetahs in an arid desert region. The two animals, alarmed, commence running towards her {{in an effort to}} attack her. Shakira responds by raising her hand, which prompts the cheetahs to abruptly stop in their tracks. They are later seen prowling around her while she is standing atop a rock and a bottle of Wild Elixir is then shown placed <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>log</b> of wood. The official website of the perfume also features a game made to promote the fragrance and Shakira's Barefoot Foundation.|$|E

5|$|The lack of patrolling by MacGregor's troops {{allowed the}} Spanish to march {{straight}} into Porto Bello early on 30 April 1819. MacGregor {{was still in}} bed when the Spaniards found his riflemen drilling in the main square and opened fire. Awoken by the noise, MacGregor threw his bed and blankets from the window onto the beach below and jumped out after them, then attempted to paddle out to his ships <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>log.</b> He passed out and would probably have drowned {{had he not been}} picked up and brought aboard the Hero by one of his naval officers. MacGregor would claim that on regaining consciousness he immediately raised his standard over the Hero, then despatched runners to Rafter ordering him not to surrender. The version of events favoured by Sinclair is that Rafter received orders to this effect only after he had himself contacted MacGregor on the Hero. Rafter, in the fort with 200 men, kept up a steady barrage and waited for his commander to fire on the royalists from the ships—but to the colonel's astonishment MacGregor instead ordered his fleet to turn about and made for the high seas. Abandoned, Colonel Rafter and the remnants of MacGregor's army {{had no choice but to}} surrender; most of the surviving officers and troops entered miserable existences in captivity. Rafter was ultimately shot with 11 other officers for conspiring to escape.|$|E

25|$|At Mandor Pampa, Bingham asked {{farmer and}} innkeeper Melchor Arteaga {{if he knew}} of any nearby ruins. Arteaga said he knew of {{excellent}} ruins {{on the top of}} Huayna Picchu. The next day, 24 July, Arteaga led Bingham and Sergeant Carrasco across the river <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>log</b> bridge and up the Huayna Picchu mountain.

Alvarez's 11-year-old son, Pablito, led Bingham along the ridge to the main ruins.|$|E
25|$|After {{the final}} element, Warmth, is {{restored}} in the volcano Mount Horu, Kuro captures Ori and Sein {{as the fire}} from Horu starts to spread. Naru, who had been separated from Gumo, arrives to find Ori unconscious and is heartbroken, which makes Kuro remember how she also {{was struck by the}} pain of losing her children. As the fire spreads and is about to reach her remaining egg, Kuro takes Sein back to the Spirit Tree, which emits a flash of bright light that dissipates the fire and restores the forest, but Kuro is destroyed by the light. Time passes as the forest begins to flourish once more, and Ori is shown sitting <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>log</b> watching new spirits being born in the field {{at the foot of the}} Spirit Tree. Gumo and Naru watch together from afar, before the latter goes home, where Kuro's egg now rests, just in time to see it hatch.|$|E

25|$|One morning, Harold finds Elsie sitting <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>log</b> in the woods, crying {{about the}} state of her life. He comforts her and, as he escorts her back to the hotel, they come across one of the Polish women. He wonders how much she saw. That evening, Elsie bursts into Harold's room. Her husband has arrived at the hotel {{unexpectedly}} and is in a terrible rage. At that moment, Philip Clayton runs in. He is carrying a spanner and screams at Elsie, accusing her of having an affair just as one of the Polish women had told him. He chases Elsie out of Harold's room and back to her own. Harold runs after him and is in time to see Elsie throw a paperweight at her husband in self-defence. He falls to the ground and Elsie begs Harold to leave them before he gets himself into trouble. Half an hour later, Mrs Rice joins Harold and tells him that Philip is dead, killed by the blow.|$|E

Tubman went to Baltimore, where her {{brother-in-law}} Tom Tubman hid her until the sale. Kessiah's husband, a free black man named John Bowley, made the winning bid for his wife. Then, while the auctioneer stepped away to have lunch, John, Kessiah and their children escaped to a nearby safe house.

500|$|Beukelman and Mirenda {{emphasize}} that vocabulary selection also involves ongoing vocabulary maintenance; however, a difficulty in AAC is that users or their carers must program in any new utterances manually (e.g. names of new friends or personal stories) {{and there are}} no existing commercial solutions for automatically adding content. A number of research approaches have attempted to overcome this difficulty, these range from [...] "inferred input", such as generating content based <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>log</b> of conversation with a user's friends and family, to data mined from the Internet to find language materials, such as the Webcrawler Project. Moreover, by making use of Lifelogging based approaches, a device's content can be changed based on events that occur to a user during their day. By accessing more of a user's data, more high-quality messages can be generated at a risk of exposing sensitive user data. For example, by making use of global positioning systems, a device's content can be changed based on geographical location.|$|E

500|$|Robin Abrahams of the Boston Globe {{published}} an analysis exploring disability on her blog. A paragraph analyzed {{the scene where}} the [...] "disabled-in-the-eyes-of-others Hurley" [...] and the [...] "disabled-in-his-own-mind Ben" [...] shared a candy bar, which she thought was [...] "kind of good and ... awful"; she said [...] "It was great to see the most hateful and most lovable characters sitting <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>log</b> sharing a chocolate bar." [...] However, she thought that the scene did not use its full potential in emphasizing Hurley's empathy and Ben's reaction. However, Kristin Dos Santos of E!, who gave the episode a mostly positive review, was critical of the scene; she thought that the scene wasted time and was [...] "cruel and unusual punishment" [...] to air before the cliffhanger ending. Erin Martell from TV Squad stated [...] "This episode put everyone, including the freighter folk, in place {{to carry out their}} plans. I'm already stoked for the finale".|$|E
500|$|Congressman Theodore Burton {{had been}} elected as senator in Foraker's place in 1909, and {{announced}} that he would seek a second term in the 1914 elections. By this time, the Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution had been ratified, giving the people the right to elect senators, and Ohio had instituted primary elections for the office. Foraker and former congressman Ralph D. Cole also entered the Republican primary. When Burton withdrew, Foraker became the favorite, but his Old Guard Republicanism was deemed outdated, and Harding was urged to enter the race. Daugherty claimed credit for persuading Harding to run, [...] "I found him like a turtle sunning himself <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>log,</b> and I pushed him into the water." [...] According to Harding biographer Randolph Downes, [...] "he put on a campaign of such sweetness and light as would have won the plaudits of the angels. It was calculated to offend nobody except Democrats." [...] Although Harding did not attack Foraker, his supporters had no such scruples. Harding won the primary by 12,000 votes over Foraker.|$|E
500|$|Early {{the next}} morning, Nick fills a jar with 50 dew-heavy {{grasshoppers}} found under a log he names a [...] "grasshopper lodging-house", eats breakfast, drinks sweetened coffee {{and makes a}} sliced onion sandwich. After checking and assembling his fly fishing rod and tying on damp leader line, {{he walks to the}} river with a net hanging from his belt, a sack over his shoulder and the jar of grasshoppers dangling around his neck. Wading in the water, he fishes the shallows; he lands a trout that [...] "was mottled with clear, water-over-gravel color" [...] that he releases. Moving into a pool of deeper water, he hooks a large trout, [...] "as broad as a salmon", which he loses. After a rest, he moves away from the pool to the more shallow center of the river and catches two trout that he stows in his sack. Sitting <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>log,</b> smoking a cigarette and eating his onion sandwich, he thinks about fishing the deep water of the swamp, but decides to wait for another day. At the log in the river, he kills, guts and cleans the two trout before returning to camp.|$|E
