This decision was questioned by some legal experts: Anthony Falzone <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fair</b> Use Project at Stanford Law School criticized Combs and Bad Boy for not defending {{the legality of}} sampling and suggested {{that they might have}} refused to raise such a defense because they feared it could later imperil their control over their own music.|$|E

5|$|Paul Thiry was the fair's chief architect; he also {{designed}} the Coliseum building.

Yamasaki would later design New York's World Trade Center. Victor Steinbrueck and John Graham, Jr. designed the Space Needle. Hideki Shimizu and Kazuyuki Matsushita designed the original International Fountain. Despite the plan to build a permanent civic center, more than half the structures built for the fair were torn down more or less immediately after it ended.|$|E
5|$|The World of Commerce and Industry {{was divided}} into {{domestic}} and foreign areas.

The latter included 15governmental exhibitors and surrounded the World of Tomorrow and extended to the north edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fair.</b>|$|E

50|$|The Leitra was {{approved}} by the Danish authorities for general use after systematic tests in 1982. Approval was given on the condition that the cyclist must be able to give unhindered arm signals for turning and stopping.

5|$|The aerial {{game was}} also {{developed}} within the Sheffield game.

5|$|The fair {{planners}} {{also sought}} two other properties near {{the southwest corner}} of the grounds. They failed completely to make any inroads with the Seattle Archdiocese of the Roman Catholic Church, who had recently built Sacred Heart Church there; they did a bit better with the Freemasons' Nile Temple, which they were able to use for the duration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fair</b> and which then returned to its previous use. It served as the site of the Century 21 Club. This membership organization, formed especially for the fair, charged $250 for membership and offered lounge, dining room, and other club facilities, as well as a gate pass for the duration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fair.</b> The city ended up leasing the property after the fair and in 1977 bought it from the Masons. The building was eventually incorporated into a theater complex including the Seattle Children's Theatre.|$|E
5|$|The poem is part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fair</b> Youth {{sequence}} (which comprises sonnets 1–126 in {{the accepted}} numbering {{stemming from the}} first edition in 1609). It is also {{the first of the}} cycle after the opening sequence now described as the procreation sonnets. Some scholars, however, contend that {{it is part of the}} procreation sonnets, as it addresses the idea of reaching eternal life through the written word, a theme they find in sonnets 15–17. In this view, it can be seen as part of a transition to sonnet 20's time theme.|$|E

5|$|The rules {{had a major}} {{influence}} on how the modern game of football developed. Among other things they introduced into the laws of the game the concepts of corners, throw-ins, and free kicks for fouls. The abolition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fair</b> catch also led to their teams {{to be the first to}} head the ball. Games played under the rules are also credited with the development of heading and the origins of the goalkeeper and forward positions.

5|$|When {{given the}} {{opportunity}} to host a public reception for President McKinley, fair organizers chose to site it in the Temple of Music—Louis L. Babcock, grand marshal of the Exposition, regarded the building as ideal for the purpose. The large auditorium was located close to the Esplanade, in the heart <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fair,</b> and had doorways on each of its four sides. In addition to rows of chairs {{on the floor of the}} hall, it had spacious galleries. Babcock spent the morning of September 6 making some physical arrangements for the reception. Floor seating was removed to create a broad aisle, running from the east doors through which the public would be admitted, to where McKinley would stand. Once members of the public shook hands with McKinley, they would continue on to exit the building. An American flag was draped behind the President, both to screen him from behind and for decoration—several potted plants were arrayed around his place to create an attractive scene. Besides its utility for other purposes, the ornate building was one of the architectural features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fair.</b>|$|E
5|$|Within the sonnet, {{the speaker}} contemplates his {{inability}} to articulate his admiration for the Fair Youth, a fault he attributes to his jealousy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fair</b> Youth's appearance in the poems of the speaker's Rival Poet. Sonnet 86 is notable within the Rival Poet subsection of sonnets because it allegedly provides important clues as to the historical identity of this Rival Poet. The sonnet is written in the typical Shakespearean sonnet form, containing 14 lines of iambic pentameter and ending in a rhymed couplet.|$|E

5|$|In July 1793, Captain Napoleon Bonaparte, an {{artillery}} officer, was {{placed under the}} command of General Jean-Baptiste Carteaux to deal with rebels from Marseille situated in Avignon, where army munitions required by the French Army of Italy were being stored. On 24 July, Carteaux's National Guardsmen assaulted Avignon which was held by rebellious Guardsmen. They killed thirty citizens in cold blood during the attack before capturing the town and army supplies. Afterwards, Napoleon travelled to nearby Tarascon to find wagons with which to transport the munition. He visited Beaucaire, across the river from Tarascon, which had been holding an annual fair. Napoleon arrived on 28 July, the last day <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fair,</b> and went to a tavern where he shared supper and conversation with four merchants– two from Marseille, one from Montpellier and another from Nîmes.|$|E
5|$|In the December 11, 1892 Sunday paper, Dunne wrote another dialect column, {{this time}} {{set in the}} upscale Dearborn Street saloon of Colonel Malachi McNeary (in all columns but the first spelled McNeery). That barkeeper was based on James McGarry, owner of a saloon near Chicago's {{newspaper}} district; Dunne and other journalists would drink there and write their stories. Beginning in the second McNeery column, the listener for his monologues is Johnny McKenna, a real-life figure, who was a Republican in a mostly Democratic Irish community, and who often received government jobs as a token of bipartisanship. The World's Columbian Exposition was the major event of 1893 in Chicago, and McNeery {{was used as a}} mouthpiece for Dunne's commentary on the events and sights <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fair.</b> For example, McNeery views a meeting of the fair's Board of Lady Managers, chaired by Bertha Palmer, who in the column proves incapable of stopping an argument between the members.|$|E
5|$|In the sonnet, {{the poet}} writes {{of why he}} has stopped {{showering}} his muse with flowery praise and adoration. In his analysis of Shakespeare's Sonnets, David West suggests that the sequence of sonnets 100-103 and the silence described are {{a response to the}} infidelity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fair</b> Youth in the Rival Poet sequence of sonnets (78-86), which has caused a rift between the poet and his Muse. He writes of how immediately following the Rival Poet sonnets, the Poet begins to speak of his lover being false and having forsaken him. West claims that this ultimately culminates in sonnets 100-103, where the Poet expresses his regret over what has transpired.|$|E

5|$|On {{the advice}} of Roosevelt's secretary, Malvina Thompson, Hickok then sought work in New York with public {{relations}} man and politician Grover Whalen. Shortly after Franklin Roosevelt's 1936 re-election, Hickok was hired by Whalen to do publicity for the 1939 New York World's Fair. Opportunities for female employees <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fair</b> were limited, and she found the work unrewarding compared to her reporting days. Hickok primarily worked on promoting the fair to young people, including arranging class trips. Because Hickok rented both a country home and an apartment, she often faced financial problems despite her good salary during these years, and Roosevelt occasionally sent her small gifts of money.|$|E
5|$|Sonnet 102 {{is one of}} the 154 sonnets {{written by}} English playwright and poet William Shakespeare. It is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fair</b> Youth sonnets, in which Shakespeare writes of an unnamed youth with whom the poet is enamored. Sonnet 102 is among a series of {{seemingly}} connected sonnets, from Sonnet 100 to Sonnet 103, in which the poet speaks of a silence between his Muse and himself. The exact date of writing is unknown, and there is contention among scholars about when they were written. Paul Hammond among other scholars believes that sonnets 61-103 were written primarily during the early 1590s, and then being edited or added to later, during the early 1600s (decade). Regardless of date of writing, it was published later {{along with the rest of}} the sonnets of the 1609 Quarto.|$|E
5|$|The coin {{stems from}} {{the desire of the}} Columbian Exposition's {{organizers}} to gain federal money to complete construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fair.</b> Congress granted an appropriation, and allowed it to be in the form of commemorative half dollars, which legislators and organizers believed could be sold at a premium. Fair official James Ellsworth wanted the new coin to be based on a 16th-century painting he owned by Lorenzo Lotto, reputedly of Columbus, and pushed for this through the design process. When initial sketches by Mint Chief Engraver Charles E. Barber proved unsatisfactory, fair organizers turned to a design by artist Olin Levi Warner, which after modification by Barber and by his assistant, George T. Morgan, was struck by the Mint.|$|E
