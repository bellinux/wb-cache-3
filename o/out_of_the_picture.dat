5|$|The {{painting}} {{depicts a}} natural philosopher, a forerunner {{of the modern}} scientist, recreating one of Robert Boyle's air pump experiments, in which a bird is deprived of air, before a varied group of onlookers. The group exhibits a variety of reactions, {{but for most of}} the audience scientific curiosity overcomes concern for the bird. The central figure looks <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> as if inviting the viewer's participation in the outcome.|$|E
5|$|Fuseli painted other {{versions}} of The Nightmare following {{the success of}} the first; at least three survive. The other important canvas was painted between 1790 and 1791 and is held at the Goethe Museum in Frankfurt. It is smaller than the original, and the woman's head lies to the left; a mirror opposes her on the right. The demon is looking at the woman rather than <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture,</b> and it has pointed, catlike ears. The most significant difference in the remaining two versions is an erotic statuette of a couple on the table.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} {{to release a}} Game Boy incarnation of the Mega Man series came {{after the release of}} Mega Man 3 on the NES. Early reports of Dr. Wily's Revenge were made in February 1991 in both the magazine GamePro and Steven A. Schwartz's book The Official Guide to Mega Man. The North American version of this game and the first DOS Mega Man game share a similar cover art. Instead of being an all new illustration, the Dr. Wily's Revenge North American artwork is a simple touch-up of Mega Man 3s regional cover, with the surrounding landscape and robot masters cropped <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture.</b>|$|E
60|$|Uncle John went {{at once to}} the {{cupboard}} and unlocked the doors. Joe himself pushed the slide and took <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drawer <b>the</b> <b>picture,</b> which had lain just beneath the Almaquo stock certificates.|$|R

6000|$|Thus she {{illustrated}} how all {{the matters}} she had been taught slipped from her mind when she was <b>out</b> <b>of</b> doors, <b>out</b> <b>of</b> sight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture.</b> After an interval she added: [...] "Only mother is here--always with me." ...|$|R
5|$|An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump {{followed}} in 1768, the emotionally charged experiment contrasting with the orderly scene from The Orrery. The painting, which measures 72 by 94½inches (183 by 244cm), shows a white cockatoo fluttering in panic {{as the air}} is slowly withdrawn from the vessel by the pump. The witnesses display various emotions: {{one of the girls}} worriedly watches the fate of the bird, while the other is too upset to observe and is comforted by her father; two gentlemen (one of them dispassionately timing the experiment) and a boy look on with interest, while the young lovers {{to the left of the}} painting are absorbed only in each other. The scientist himself looks directly <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture,</b> as if challenging the viewer to judge whether the pumping should continue, killing the bird, or whether the air should be replaced and the cockatoo saved.|$|E
5|$|Candaules {{shows the}} moment at which Gyges, hiding behind the door, first catches sight of Nyssia's naked body. Candaules lies naked in bed, while Nyssia undresses as she prepares to join him, and Gyges tiptoes around the door {{to catch a glimpse}} of her. Nyssia holds a piece of fabric, which forms a {{vertical}} line cutting off the body of Candaules at the top of his legs, invoking a theme of emasculation at the hands of a powerful woman. By positioning the figures in such a way that none are looking <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture,</b> and the viewer is directly behind Nyssia, Etty intended that the viewer feel the same sense of voyeurism and intrusion that Gyges would have felt, forced to spy on his master's naked wife against his will and without her knowledge. The cluttered arrangement of drapery and architectural features intentionally exaggerates the claustrophobic and implicitly violent nature of the scene.|$|E
5|$|General Amherst, the British {{commander-in-chief}} in North America, was {{in overall}} charge of administering policy towards Native Americans, which involved both military matters and {{regulation of the}} fur trade. Amherst believed that with France <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture,</b> the Native Americans would have no other choice than to accept British rule. He also {{believed that they were}} incapable of offering any serious resistance to the British Army; therefore, of the 8,000 troops under his command in North America, only about 500 were stationed in the region where the war erupted. Amherst and officers such as Major Henry Gladwin, commander at Fort Detroit, made little effort to conceal their contempt for the Native Americans. Native Americans involved in the uprising frequently complained that the British treated them no better than slaves or dogs.|$|E
50|$|Extrajudicial {{punishment}} was more brutal. During <b>the</b> last decade <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 19th century and <b>the</b> first decades <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 20th century, white vigilante mobs lynched thousands of black males, sometimes with <b>the</b> overt assistance <b>of</b> state officials, mostly within the South. No whites {{were charged with}} crimes {{in any of those}} murders. Whites were so confident of their immunity from prosecution for lynching that they not only photographed the victims, but made postcards <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures.</b>|$|R
50|$|Mason took itself <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{realignment}} <b>picture</b> for <b>the</b> {{time being}} on May 11, when AD Tom O'Connor told The Washington Post {{that it was}} staying in the CAA.|$|R
50|$|Mike Cole stole 100 {{bases in}} the 1989 season and there was hope of a playoff appearance, but poor road trips against Campeche and Yucatán to end the season left them <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> postseason <b>picture.</b>|$|R
5|$|There {{is also an}} {{indeterminate}} {{relationship between}} the figures in the spandrels and the lunettes beneath them. Because of {{the constraints of the}} triangular shape, in each spandrel the figures are seated on the ground. In six of the eight spandrels the compositions resemble traditional depictions of the Flight into Egypt. Of the two remaining, one shows a woman with shears trimming the neck of a garment she is making while her toddler looks on. The Biblical woman who is recorded as making a new garment for her child is Hannah, the mother of Samuel, whose child went to live in the temple, and indeed, the male figure in the background is wearing a distinctive hat that might suggest that of a priest. The other figure who differs from the rest is a young woman who sits staring <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> with prophetic intensity. Her open eyes have been closed in the restoration.|$|E
5|$|Susan {{attempts}} to console Edie's husband, Dave Williams (Neal McDonough), following Edie's death. She explains the truth behind her own accident, completely unaware that Lila and Paige Dash were Dave's wife and daughter, respectively, {{and that he}} had been seeking revenge on Mike since moving to Wisteria Lane. Meanwhile, Jackson returns to Fairview and proposes to Susan, revealing that his visa has expired and he needs to marry an American citizen. When Susan learns that Mike, who is engaged to Katherine, will no longer have to pay alimony once she is married, she explains the false pretenses of her engagement. Dave, who now understands that Susan was driving the car that killed his family, overhears this and reports Jackson to immigration officials. With Jackson <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture,</b> Dave invites Susan and M.J. on a fishing trip, planning to kill M.J. just like Susan killed his own child. Mike discovers Dave's plans and is able to save Susan and M.J. After the ordeal, Susan and Mike share a brief, yet romantic kiss. Dave is sent to a psychiatric hospital in Boston and two months later, Mike marries an unidentified bride.|$|E
25|$|In {{his late}} works, {{weaknesses}} of composition emerge. The motif is ill-positioned, waysides crop corners, streets and clods of earth are poorly executed, {{so that the}} animals with their firm lines stick <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture.</b>|$|E
60|$|Then {{gradually}} from <b>out</b> <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> one figure detached {{itself from}} her mind--her husband.|$|R
50|$|Borden had two marriages, one {{ending in}} divorce {{and the other}} in annulment. She also had several {{relationships}} with men in and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> motion <b>picture</b> industry. Borden lived most of her life with her mother, Sibbie.|$|R
5000|$|Born in Guáimaro, Camagüey, Fabelo {{studied at}} The National Art School {{and at the}} Superior Art Institute of Havana. He was a {{professor}} and a jury member for very important national and international visual arts contests. The Cuban state awarded him a medal for National Culture and the Alejo Carpentier medal for his outstanding artistic career. Fabelo's art consists of nude women, who often appear with bird-like features, including a beak and wings. He drew in textbooks, and created figures <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> already in <b>the</b> textbook. Another example of his art was water colored markers used to draw on silk embroidered fabric.|$|R
25|$|With Möllendorf <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture,</b> {{the resolve}} of the {{fortress}} commandant weakened and broke. That night, {{he signed the}} articles of capitulation. Included in the terms were the surrender of the Petersberg fortress and large quantities of gunpowder and munitions.|$|E
25|$|After the Russian Revolution of 1917, Diaghilev stayed abroad. The new Soviet regime, once {{it became}} obvious that he could not be lured back, {{condemned}} him in perpetuity as an especially insidious example of bourgeois decadence. Soviet art historians wrote him <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> for more than 60 years.|$|E
25|$|These are type sui generis as {{they either}} reward {{a career in}} {{domestic}} politics or are awarded in the colonial context not on grounds of justice, contract or socio-economic merits, but as a political decision, {{in order to take}} a politically significant person (often deemed a potential political danger) <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> by paying him or her off, regardless of seniority.|$|E
50|$|Ottawa {{featured}} <b>the</b> acquisition <b>of</b> {{national team}} D Paul James as the club's player-coach for the 1989 campaign, however the club struggled with a 7-11-8 mark and finished in 4th {{place in the}} east, once again <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> playoff <b>picture.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Phil Roof and his {{coaching}} staff returned in 1994 for the franchise's second and final season. Despite finishing {{the year with}} a 74-66 record, [...] the Xpress failed to win either half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> season and were left <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> postseason <b>picture.</b>|$|R

25|$|It was Narathihapate's last {{attempt to}} regain Pegu. With Pagan <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture,</b> Akhamaman {{increasingly}} turned autocratic, and became hated by the people. In all, his reign lasted anywhere {{from two to}} seven years. He was assassinated by Lekkhaya Byu, one of his brothers-in-law. But Lekkhaya's reign lasted just eight days. Lekkhaya in turn was assassinated by A-Che-Mun, a brother-in-law by marriage of Akhamaman.|$|E
25|$|With that, Noda was <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> {{as far as}} Formula One was concerned, so for 1996 he {{went across}} the Atlantic to try his luck in Indy Lights in America. Adapting quickly, he {{finished}} third {{on the streets of}} Toronto in his first year, and in 1997 continued in the same category, driving a Lola T97/20 for the Indy Regency Racing as teammate to Mexican driver Rodolfo Lavin.|$|E
25|$|With {{the eastern}} {{extension}} <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture,</b> the Central could have held little {{interest for the}} Watsontown group. Hicks and Higbee left the board in 1894; their replacements were Charles W. Wilhelm, of Reading, who succeeded Hicks as vice-president, Edward L. Welsh, of Philadelphia, and Robert Valentine, a director of Valentine Iron. McLaughlin did not appear on the board at the time, but apparently returned to replace Kruger later that year.|$|E
50|$|He dropped <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{international}} <b>picture</b> in 2005, but was recalled to the Scotland squad for the 2006 Six Nations championship.

25|$|In the {{old school}} they use now for the Village Hall, below the clock that has stood always at one minute past ten, hangs a small dusty {{painting}} of a horse. He stands, a splendid red bay with a remarkable white cross emblazoned on his forehead and with four perfectly matched white socks. He looks wistfully <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture,</b> his ears pricked forward, his head turned {{as if he has}} just noticed us standing there.|$|E
25|$|Madame Nhu's {{comments}} were such that President John F. Kennedy became personally concerned. He asked his advisers to find means of having Diệm gag her. McGeorge Bundy thought her {{comments were}} so damaging {{that it would}} only be acceptable for Ngô Đình Diệm to remain in power if she were <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture.</b> The National Security Council deemed her a threat to U.S. security, and told the then United States Ambassador to South Vietnam, Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr. to seek her permanent removal from South Vietnam.|$|E
25|$|Villeneuve {{started the}} 1995 {{campaign}} strongly, winning the first race {{on the streets}} of Miami. Along with the win in Miami came three other victories, the most significant of which came at Indianapolis for the Indy 500. Despite a mid-race two lap penalty, Villeneuve fought his way back up through the field. Running second with less than 10 laps to go, Villeneuve claimed the lead from fellow Canadian Scott Goodyear after Goodyear was penalized for having passed the pace-car before the restart. With Goodyear <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> Villeneuve {{went on to win the}} race by two seconds over Brazilian Christian Fittipaldi.|$|E
