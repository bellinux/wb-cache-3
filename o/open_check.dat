He was sent to the Artillery School at Fort Monroe, Virginia in September 1896 and graduated in April 1898, at the outbreak of the Spanish-American War. As he was not immediately assigned, he watched as his classmates went off to various commands, and began fearing he would not see combat. In early May, that changed when he was offered to lead what later became known as the Astor Battery, named so because it was personally financed by John Jacob Astor IV. He organized, equipped and subsequently commanded the battery when it was sent to the Philippines during the Spanish-American War. Historian Bruce Campbell Adamson has written about Henry Bidwell Ely (Adamson's great grandfather) who was placed in charge of The Astor Battery by John Jacob Astor IV, to give Peyton March whatever he needed.

40|$|ABSTRACT Debris flows {{are one of}} {{destructive}} {{natural disasters}} in mountain areas. Most of the debris flows are triggered by slope failure and landslide during heavy rain. Debris flows move very rapidly down slope and carry {{a large amount of}} sediment and wood from mountain areas to downstream open areas. As a result, the debris flows sometimes cause tremendous damage to inhabitants living in open areas. To reduce the hazards from debris flows, structural measures, such as check dams, are common practice. Recently two types of check dams are used; one is a closed type and the other is an open type. These check dams cannot effectively capture debris flows, when the storage area is filled up with sediment. Their storage area for trapping sediment should be kept empty until debris flows occur. In particular, the closed type of check dams is difficult to maintain the empty situation except the case when trapped sediments are continuously removed. On the other hand, <b>open</b> <b>check</b> dams allow finer sediment to pass through at lower discharge and coarser sediment to be trapped at higher discharge such as debris flow. Therefore, open type of check dams may keep their trapping capacity. The effectiveness of check dams for the prevention of debris flow disasters has been examined in several studies. However the knowledge of function of these check dams are still not sufficient. Therefore, it is necessary to examine the effect of check dams against debris flows through field survey and laboratory experiments. The present study is composed of three steps. The first step is to examine the effect of check dams against debris flows by field survey. The second step is to simulate behavior of wood and sediment deposited behind the <b>open</b> <b>check</b> dams by laboratory flume experiments. The third step is to compare the function of a closed type and an open type of check dams from the laboratory flume experiments. Chapter 1 introduced background and objective of the present study, including briefly reviews of the previous research related to this dissertation. Chapter 2 described case study of the debris flow control by check dams. Debris flow events occurred in Hofu City area, Japan on July 21, 2009. The mountainous region in this city was selected as study area. The situation of sediment and wood deposition was investigated at the check dams in the Tsurugi and the Hachimandani River after the debris flow event. The field investigation results indicated that the debris flow event caused significant sediment deposition at the closed check dams in the Tsurugi River and at the <b>open</b> <b>check</b> dams in the Hachimandani River. In the Hachimandani River, wood pieces accumulated in the opening of the check dams so that the accumulation obstructed the sediment transport to the downstream direction. In the Tsurugi River, on the other hand, wood pieces did not accumulate at the check dams but in the central region of the river bend. The upstream check dams in these rivers had sediment deposition profile of around 2 o, whereas the downstream ones had deposition profile of around 1. 3 o. The ratio of sediment deposition volume in the downstream check dams to that in the upstream ones was 0. 3 : 1. The total amount of sediments trapped by the two successive check dams was estimated at around 9, 500 m 3 in each river. Chapter 3 simulated the depositional process of wood and sediment from sediment-water-mixture flows at the <b>open</b> <b>check</b> dam by laboratory experiments. The results show that the pieces trapped by the <b>open</b> <b>check</b> dam increases in volume with the whole pieces moving down on the fixed bed. However, trapping wood pieces at the <b>open</b> <b>check</b> dam model requires sufficient number and volume of wood pieces moving from the upstream side. In the case without wood pieces moving on the fixed bed, most of sediment in the mixture flow passed through the <b>open</b> <b>check</b> dam model. Furthermore, {{in the case of the}} small scale of pieces, most of sediment and pieces in the mixture flow passed through the check dam model. The ratio of the size of the opening of the check dam to the scale of pieces is important for trapping the pieces. Furthermore, the accumulation depth of trapped pieces determines sediment deposition behind the trapped pieces. Chapter 4 showed a comparison between a closed type and an open type of check dams by laboratory experiments. The closed check dam model made most of wood pieces pass through the check dam model and most of sediment grains stop in the water pool behind the closed check dam model. Therefore, closed check dams can reduce outflow of sediment but it may cause outflow of wood pieces to downstream areas. On the other hand, the <b>open</b> <b>check</b> dam model trapped 60 70...|$|E

Moreover the assessment of design parameters in relation to the main characteristics of the flood is also considered: form of transport, expected sediment volume, impact force, mode of deposition.

40|$|A {{robust and}} {{reliable}} risk assessment procedure for hydrologic hazards deserves {{particular attention to}} the role of transported woody material during flash floods or debris flows. At present, woody material transport phenomena are not systematically considered within the procedures for the elaboration of hazard maps. The consequence is a risk of losing prediction accuracy and of underestimating hazard impacts. Transported woody material frequently interferes with the sediment regulation capacity of <b>open</b> <b>check</b> dams and moreover, when obstruction phenomena at critical crosssections of the stream occur, inundations can be triggered. The paper presents a procedure for the determination of the relative propensity of mountain streams to the entrainment and delivery of recruited woody material on the basis of empirical indicators. The procedure provided the basis for the elaboration of a hazard index map for all torrent catchments of the Autonomous Province of Bolzano/Bozen. The plausibility of the results has been thoroughly checked by a backward oriented analysis on natural hazard events, documented since 1998 at the Department of Hydraulic Engineering of the aforementioned Alpine Province. The procedure provides hints for the consideration of the effects, induced by woody material transport, during the elaboration of hazard zone maps...|$|E

40|$|Larges {{uncertainties}} {{are attached}} to hazard prediction in mountain streams, because of some limitations in our knowledge of physical processes, and overall, {{because of the lack}} of measurements for validation. This is particularly true for hydrological data, making the hydrology assessment of a mountain river a very difficult task, usually associated with large uncertainties. On the other hand, contrarily to lowland rivers, bed-load in mountain streams is often trapped in mitigation-structures, such as <b>open</b> <b>check</b> dams. This study aims to take advantage of these additional information for compensating the general lack of hydrological data, in order to converge toward a comprehensive diagnosis of the catchment hydrological behavior. A hydrology and sediment transport study has been done on the Roize torrent (16. 1 -km 2 - Voreppe - 38 -FR). After a classical historical study, a regional analysis of raingauges and water-discharge-stations situated in the calcareous north Pre-Alps massifs of the Vercors, Chartreuse and Bauges has been done. A catchment geomorphology study has been performed to get insight about the Roize torrential activity and sediment transport.

The good bed-load predictions compare to the volume dredged in the Voreppe sediment trap are considered an indirect validation of the hydrology study...|$|E

Three people died and considerable damages to villages and infrastructures were caused. The research investigates on the debris-flow event occurred in the rio Rudan catchment (south facing slope of the Antelao peak, Dolomites; tributary of the Boite torrent) and particularly on {{the interaction of the}} debris-flow front with a retention <b>open</b> <b>check</b> dam placed at the fan apex. The rainfall intensity of the rainstorm reached a value of 38 mm in 0. 5 h (precipitation measured by the raingauge installed on the Antelao massif by the Regional Agency for Environmental Prevention and Protection of Veneto Region, ARPAV). This rainfall triggered a debris flow, which deposited 25000 cubic meters of solid material in the terminal reach of the channel and in the storage basin of the retention check dam. The research is voted to: i) conduct the back analysis of the debris-flow event estimating the peak discharge upstream and downstream of the check dam; ii) evaluate the influence of the structure on the reduction of the maximum debris-flow surge; iii) estimate the impact force of the flow on the structure. The back analysis was carried out through the application of different methodologies supported by field surveys (significant cross sections in different channel reaches, Close Range Photogrammetry of the fan area, measurement of the sizes of the biggest boulders entrained by the flow). The different methods used for the reconstruction of the maximum discharge of the debris flow provided converging values, allowing to conclude that the structure was capable to halve the peak discharge and to efficiently protect the neighboring village. Finally, the back calculation of the impact force of the flow against the check dam was conducted through the analysis of structure damages and indicated some design criteria for the most exposed parts of the work...|$|E
