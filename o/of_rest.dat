40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to measure the main aspects that {{characterize}} the <b>resting</b> behaviour <b>of</b> eighteen months old heifers using two different resting space allowances. During the experiments the following resting behaviour aspects were determined: number <b>of</b> <b>resting</b> periods, the length <b>of</b> one <b>resting</b> period and the total length <b>of</b> <b>resting</b> periods. Results showed that when a <b>resting</b> space <b>of</b> 4. 5 m 2 per heifer was used the total length of laying down periods was 262. 8 minutes in the morning, 159. 5 minutes in the afternoon and 450. 5 minutes during the night.

The bishop of Chur proposed to Zita that she move into a residence that he administered (formerly a castle of the Counts de Salis) at Zizers, Graubünden in Switzerland. As the castle had enough space for visits from her large family and a nearby chapel (a necessity for the devoutly Catholic Zita), she accepted with ease.|$|E

While most of the German garrison quickly surrendered, it was necessary to deal with some diehard elements who refused to surrender to either the New Zealanders or the Yugoslav partisans also present in the city. In fact, the partisans were reluctant to allow Germans to surrender to the New Zealanders at all.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn humans, folliculogenesis starts {{when some}} resting follicles leave the ovarian reserve {{to enter the}} growing phase. Activation <b>of</b> <b>resting</b> follicles remains poorly understood, however recent data show {{existence}} of a balance between activating and repressing factors. Many molecules, comprised KIT ligand, bind a protein kinase receptor and activate the phosphatidylinositol kinase (PI 3 K) signaling pathway, which contains enzymes and transcription factors that either stimulate or inhibit activation <b>of</b> <b>resting</b> follicles. Some inhibiting (AMH) or activating (activin, BMPs) molecules belong to the TGF-ß super-family, while others can either stimulate (LIF, androgens) or inhibit (estradiol, progesterone, somatostatin) activation <b>of</b> <b>resting</b> follicles. The understanding of molecular mechanisms controlling activation <b>of</b> <b>resting</b> follicles has significant clinical implications in mobilizing resting follicles in patients suffering from infertility due to ovarian dysfunction either spontaneous or resulting from cancer treatments...|$|R

5|$|Between 1962 and 2003, {{there were}} {{numerous}} proposals to change the HOS again, but none were ever finalized. By this time, the ICC had been abolished, and regulations were now issued by the FMCSA. The 2003 changes applied only to property-carrying drivers (i.e., truck drivers). These rules allowed 11hours of driving within a 14-hour period, and required 10hours <b>of</b> <b>rest.</b> These changes would allow drivers (using the entire 14-hour on-duty period) to maintain a natural 24-hour cycle, with a bare minimum 21-hour cycle (11hours driving, 10hours rest). However, the retention of the split sleeper berth provision would allow drivers to maintain irregular, short-burst sleeping schedules.|$|E
