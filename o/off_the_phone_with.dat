5|$|Shankar's {{original}} {{hope was}} to raise $25,000 through a benefit concert of his own, compered perhaps by actor Peter Sellers. With Harrison's commitment, {{and the record}} and film outlets available to him through the Beatles' Apple Corps organisation, the idea soon grew to become a star-studded musical event, mixing Western rock with Indian classical music, and {{it was to be}} held at the most prestigious venue in America: Madison Square Garden, in New York City. According to Chris O'Dell, a music-business administrator and former Apple employee, Harrison got <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>with</b> Shankar once the concept had been finalised, and started enthusing with his wife, Pattie Boyd, and herself about possible performers. Ringo Starr, Lennon, Eric Clapton, Leon Russell, Jim Keltner, Voormann, Billy Preston and Badfinger were all mentioned during this initial brainstorming.|$|E
25|$|After he got <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>with</b> Irsay, Hudnut {{called his}} {{neighbor}} and friend, John B. Smith, after {{the deal was}} finalized. Smith was {{the chief executive officer}} of Mayflower Transit, an Indiana-based moving company, and Hudnut asked him to assist the team in their move. Smith sent fifteen Mayflower trucks to Owings Mills and they arrived at the Colts' facility at around 10 p.m. The reasoning for the late hour of the move was out of fear that the Maryland House of Delegates would also approve the eminent domain bill the State Senate had, which would have resulted in the team being seized the next morning once Maryland Governor Harry Hughes signed the bill into law. Workers loaded all of the team's belongings and the trucks left for Indianapolis. Within eight hours of the Mayflower trucks' arrival in Owings Mills, the Colts were completely gone from Baltimore. Later that day, the House of Delegates indeed passed the bill by a count of 103–19 and Governor Hughes signed it, but by that time it was too late.|$|E
