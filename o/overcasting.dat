50|$|In 1998, they {{released}} their first full length album, <b>Overcasting.</b>|$|E
50|$|The term <b>Overcasting</b> {{was coined}} in early 2005 by Richard Stoakley at Overcast Media.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Overcast</b> covers {{local artists}} and entrepreneurs, food, retail, and {{academic}} culture. In {{addition to its}} monthly print issue, its website is home to an online alternative radio station (<b>Overcast</b> Radio), event listings, restaurant listings and reviews, and other resources, including its own YouTube channel of <b>Overcast</b> exclusive web videos. The <b>Overcast</b> also produces two podcasts, None the Wiser and The <b>Overcast</b> Fiction Podcast.|$|R
50|$|<b>Overcast</b> {{stitches}} may be reversible, as {{when they}} are used to join together crochet block pieces of afghan blankets. There are several different kinds of <b>overcast</b> stitches. A straight <b>overcast</b> stitch is used for finishing edges in eyelets and cutwork fabric. A blanket stitch, used to finish edges of wool blankets, is another common <b>overcast</b> stitch.|$|R
5000|$|The hand <b>overcast</b> stitch {{involves}} small diagonal stitches evenly spaced out enclosing {{the fabric}} raw edge.To create an <b>overcast</b> stitch by sewing machine, {{we can use}} an <b>overcast</b> foot, though a regular foot also can be used. The <b>overcast</b> foot has an edge guide which helps the fabric to feed evenly along the edge and a bar in the middle that controls the stitch and makes it lay nice and flat.|$|R
50|$|Overcast Media has {{developed}} a synchronization technology which allows authors to create commentary over one video source (ex. a digital recording) and allows consumers to view the commentary in sync with a different video source (ex. a show acquired through Amazon Unbox). This process is called <b>Overcasting.</b> Additionally, their synchronization technology works with many Flash based players currently in use online. <b>Overcasting</b> handles timing variations found across different sources and file formats. Along with audio commentary, Overcasts can contain text, web links, graphics and arbitrary meta-data.|$|E
50|$|Overcast Media has a {{stand-alone}} Flash-based Overcast player and editor {{as well as}} a client-side Overcast Player, browser plug-in and separate Overcast Authoring Studio. All of these work in conjunction with the web-based <b>Overcasting</b> service.|$|E

40|$|<b>Overcast</b> is an {{application-level}} multicasting {{system that}} can be incrementally deployed using today’s Internet infrastructure. These properties stem from <b>Overcast’s</b> implementation as an overlay network. An overlay network consists {{of a collection of}} nodes placed at strategic locations in an existing network fabric. These nodes implement a network abstraction on top of the network provided by the underlying substrate network. <b>Overcast</b> provides scalable and reliable single-source multicast using a simple protocol for building efficient data distribution trees that adapt to changing network conditions. To support fast joins, <b>Overcast</b> implements a new protocol for efficiently tracking the global status of a changing distribution tree. Results based on simulations confirm that <b>Overcast</b> provides its added functionality while performing competitively with IP Multicast. Simulations indicate that <b>Overcast</b> quickly builds bandwidthefficient distribution trees that, compared to IP Multicast, provide 70 %- 100 % of the total bandwidth possible, at a cost of somewhat less than twice the network load. In addition, <b>Overcast</b> adapts quickly to changes caused by the addition of new nodes or the failure of existing nodes without causing undue load on the multicast source...|$|R
5000|$|In embroidery, an <b>overcast</b> stitch is {{a raised}} line stitch used on even-weave fabrics. It is {{commonly}} used for outlining designs. There are two methods of creating an embroidered <b>overcast</b> stitch. In one method, a line is stitched to create padding, then another thread covers the padding stitches in small stitches {{at right angles to}} the padding stitches. The other method is called detached <b>overcast</b> stitching, and involves two alternating padding stitches that pick up the fabric, followed by <b>overcast</b> stitches that cover the padding stitches without picking up the fabric.|$|R
50|$|<b>Overcasting</b> is {{the process}} of {{broadcasting}} content that is meant to be played over and in sync with another piece of content. For example, a forensics expert might create commentary for an episode of CSI and share that commentary independent of the original video. The file containing the commentary, mixing information and synchronization data is called an Overcast.|$|E
50|$|On mass-produced clothing, {{the seam}} {{allowances}} of plain seams are usually trimmed and stitched {{together with an}} overlock stitch using a serger. Plain seams may also be pressed open, with each seam allowance separately secured with an overlock stitch. Traditional home sewing techniques for finishing plain seams include trimming with pinking shears, oversewing with a zig-zag stitch, and hand or machine <b>overcasting.</b>|$|E

After {{calibration}} with a spectroradiometer, a commercial CCD camera equipped with a fisheye lens can produce colorimetrically accurate all-skymaps of <b>overcast</b> spectra. Histograms and azimuthally averaged curves of the resulting chromaticities show consistent, but unexpected, patterns in time-averaged <b>overcast</b> colors. Although widely usedmodels such as LOWTRAN 7 and MODTRAN 4 cannot explain these characteristic patterns, a simple semiempirical model based on the radiative transfer equation does, and it provides insights into the visible consequences of absorption and scattering both within and beneath <b>overcasts.</b> © 2008 Optical Society of America OCIS codes: 010. 1290, 010. 1615, 010. 1690, 010. 7295, 290. 1090, 330. 1730. 1...|$|R
40|$|Aerosol {{indirect}} effects {{are some of}} the largest uncertainties of anthropogenic climate change. To estimate the first aerosol indirect radiative effect (or cloud albedo effect), we analyzed global solar irradiance measurements under completely <b>overcast</b> skies during the recent period of aerosol optical depth decline in Europe. Although measurements from 15 Swiss and 8 northern German sites show clear evidence for an aerosol direct radiative effect under cloud-free skies, trends of transmitted solar irradiance (SWtran) under <b>overcast</b> skies are ambiguous. Time series from 1981 to 2005 of SWtran for all <b>overcast</b> conditions show slightly negative, but non-significant trends. SWtran under <b>overcast</b> conditions with “thick ” clouds (SWtran smaller than the long term mean) exhibits on average an increasing trend of + 0. 29 [+ 0. 01 to + 0. 57] Wm- 2 / decade. The increase of SWtran under “thick ” <b>overcast</b> skies, however, is about 9 times smaller than the increase under cloud-free skies. Since cirrus clouds are generally excluded from and low-level stratiform clouds are more frequently represented by “thick ” <b>overcast</b> skies, the slight increase in SWtran may possibly result from a weak aerosol indirect effect. Alternatively, the increase in SWtran may be due to a decreasing trend in low-level stratiform cloud amount under <b>overcast</b> conditions observed for these sites. W...|$|R
40|$|A {{validation}} {{study of the}} sky models of RADIANCE simulation software against the <b>overcast</b> sky condition {{has been carried out}} in order to test the accuracy of sky model of RADIANCE for modeling the <b>overcast</b> sky condition in Hong Kong. Two sets of data have been analysed. Firstly, data collected from a set of experiments using a physical scale model. In this experiment, the illuminance of four points inside the model was measured under real sky conditions. Secondly, the RADIANCE simulation has been used to simulate this physical model under <b>overcast</b> sky conditions using gensky sub-program with and without measured sky data, which is defined as Measured Sky and Default Sky, respectively. The analysis was based on the Mean Bias Errors (MBE???s), Root Mean Square Errors (RMSE???s) and Relative Errors (RE???s) between measured and simulated illuminance. This study found that CIE <b>overcast</b> sky model with measured sky data (Measured Sky) shows a very good accuracy in simulating the <b>overcast</b> sky condition. This was corresponded by low values of MBE???s and RMSE???s. While the CIE <b>overcast</b> sky model without measured sky data (Default Sky) shows a very bad accuracy, which has average MBE of more than 200...|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} German {{title is}} [...] "". The story {{is also known}} as [...] "For the Consideration of Amateur Jockeys". Told {{from the perspective of a}} jockey, the narrator tells the reader about the dangers and consequences of being a jockey. The narrator uses images of envious opponents, successful and unsuccessful gambling friends, and women looking down upon the pride of the winners. The tone used in the story is that of a wiser, seasoned veteran warning amateurs and rookies of the consequences of their sport. The story focuses in depth on the unfortunate events that take place after a victory. The narrator goes on to tell of the envy of the losers and how their influences in the community will create distress for the victor. The narrator also goes on to describe the fortunes and misfortunes of friends, of those who gambled for one's victory and those who did not fearing the anger of their friend had he lost both his race and their bet. He also goes on to describe the women in the crowd, who disapprove of the victor, finding it ridiculous that the victor is so proud of his victory and of the handshaking and baby kissing that comes with it. The narrator ends his description with the unfortunate announcement of <b>overcasting</b> skies, foretelling rain. The story centers around the theme of the consequences and misfortunes that follow a victory, describing how winning does not always bring fortune.|$|E

40|$|An angular {{dependence}} model (ADM) describes the anisotropy in the reflectance field. ADMs {{are a key}} element in determining the top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) albedos and radiative fluxes. This study utilizes 1 -yr satellite data from the Scanner for Radiation Budget (ScaRaB) for <b>overcast</b> scenes to examine the variation of ADMs with cloud properties. Using ScaRaB shortwave (SW) <b>overcast</b> radiance measurements, an SW mean <b>overcast</b> ADM, similar to the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) ADM, was generated. Differences between the ScaRaB and ERBE <b>overcast</b> ADMs lead to biases of; 0. 01 – 0. 04 in mean albedos inferred from specific angular bins. The largest biases are in the backward scattering direction. <b>Overcast</b> ADMs for the visible (VIS) wavelength were also generated using ScaRaB VIS measurements. They are very similar to, but a little smaller at large viewing angles and a little larger at nadir, than the SW <b>overcast</b> ADMs. To evaluate the effect of cloud properties on ADMs, ScaRaB <b>overcast</b> observations were further classified into thin, thick, warm, and cold cloud categories to generate four subsets of ADMs. The resulting ADMs for thin and thick clouds show opposite trends and deviate significantly from the overall mean ADM by more than 10 %. Deviations from the mean ADM were also noted for the ADMs developed for warm water clouds and cold ice clouds. These deviations were attributed to the different scattering phase functions of water and ice particles and were compared with results from model simulations. Use of a single mean <b>overcast</b> ADM results in albedo biases of 0. 01 – 0. 04, relative to the use of specific ADMs for particular cloud types. The biases reduced to; 0. 005 when averaged over all cloud types and viewing geometry. 1...|$|R

40|$|This {{review article}} {{describes}} {{the current status of}} resin-bonded fixed partial denture, splint and <b>overcasting</b> design. Several such designs have been introduced through the years, but there is no typical standard yet for the design of anterior resin-bonded prostheses. On the other hand, the design of posterior resin-bonded prostheses has generally been a standard D-shaped structure. To splint abutment teeth, including pathological mobile teeth, the application of resin-bonded retainers with additional retentive structures is recommended. Although a conventional design for resin-bonded overcastings has not been established yet, it is usually easy to add mechanical structures. The problem in clinical practice is the esthetics of the retainers, although the key to solving this problem may be to apply tooth-colored material...|$|E

30|$|We {{wanted to}} know whether the {{reduction}} of the light intensity by the greenhouse sheeting was substantial or negligible for seedlings’ photosynthetic performance. In order to estimate the maximum capacity of photosynthetic performance, a light response curve was created in March 2011, using 9, two-month old seedlings raised in a greenhouse from the same set of cones originating from Denali, with the same protocol stated previously. In addition, in the field, light levels inside and outside the greenhouses were measured using a light sensor on the LiCor 6400 XT photosynthesis system. The sensor was placed facing directly to the sun light and data were recorded every 2  seconds for one minute. Data were obtained both sunny and <b>overcasting</b> days, obtaining 2 – 4 data per either inside or outside a greenhouse, then averaged.|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} of polarization in the <b>overcast</b> sky has been practically unknown. Earlier the polarization {{of light from}} heavily <b>overcast</b> skies (when the Sun's disc was invisible) has been measured only sporadically in some celestial points by point-source polarimetry. What kind of patterns of the degree p and angle a of linear polarization of light could develop after transmission through {{a thick layer of}} ice or water clouds? To answer this question, we measured the p and a patterns of numerous totally <b>overcast</b> skies on the Arctic Ocean and in Hungary by full-sky imaging polarimetry. We present here our finding that depending on the optical thickness of the cloud layer, the pattern of a of light transmitted through the ice or water clouds of totally <b>overcast</b> skies is qualitatively the same as the a pattern of the clear sky. Under <b>overcast</b> conditions the value of a is determined predominantly by scattering on cloud particles themselves. Nevertheless, the degrees of linear polarization of light from <b>overcast</b> skies were rather low (p <= 16 %). Our results obtained under <b>overcast</b> conditions complete the earlier findings that the a pattern of the clear sky also appears in partly cloudy, foggy, and smoky skies. Our results show that the celestial {{distribution of}} the direction of polarization is a very robust pattern being qualitatively always the same under all possible sky conditions. This is of great importance for the orientation of polarization-sensitive animals based on sky polarization under conditions when the Sun is not visible. (c) 2007 Optical Society of America...|$|R
