5|$|Grunge fuses {{elements}} of punk rock and heavy metal, {{such as the}} distorted electric guitar used in both genres, although some bands performed with more emphasis on one or the <b>other.</b> <b>Like</b> these genres, grunge typically uses electric guitar, bass guitar, a drummer and a singer. Grunge also incorporates influences from indie rock bands such as Sonic Youth. Lyrics are typically angst-filled and introspective, often addressing themes such as social alienation, apathy, concerns about confinement, and a desire for freedom.|$|E
5|$|On {{behalf of}} Bryan, Legal Services {{attorney}} Patrick Moriarty then sued {{the state and}} Itasca County in the District Court of Itasca County, seeking declaratory relief and an injunction which would prevent the state and county from collecting taxes from Indians on tribal land. This was filed as a class action suit. There was no dispute as to {{the facts of the}} case, so the matter was submitted as a question of law to Judge James F. Murphy. In 1973, the district court held that the state and county were authorized to collect such taxes under Public Law 280. Murphy noted that while the Chippewa had at one time been a sovereign Indian nation, their members were now citizens of Minnesota and received benefits from the state such as county services, the court system, and <b>other</b> <b>like</b> services.|$|E
5|$|The {{genitalia}} of {{the male}} and female in any particular species are adapted to fit each <b>other</b> <b>like</b> a lock (male) and key (female). In males, the ninth abdominal segment is divided into a dorsal 'tegumen' and ventral 'viniculum'. They form a ring-like structure for the attachment of genital parts and a pair of lateral clasping organs (claspers or 'harpe'). The male has a median tubular organ (called the aedeagus) which is extended through an eversible sheath (or 'vesica') to inseminate the female. The males have paired sperm ducts in all lepidopterans; the paired testes are separate in basal taxa and fused in advanced forms.|$|E

Some like the Hildocerataceae and Stephanocerataceae {{are restricted to}} the Jurassic. <b>Others</b> <b>like</b> the Hoplitaceae and Acanthocerataceae are known only from the Cretaceous. Still <b>others</b> <b>like</b> the Perisphinctaceae are found in both.|$|R

25|$|Some Northern Wei statues can {{be quite}} {{reminiscent}} of Gandharan standing Buddha, although in a slightly more symbolic style.

25|$|In 1992, Tyne Tees {{dropped their}} famous logo {{which they had}} {{previously}} been using since 1970 and opted instead for four separate letters stacked atop each <b>other</b> <b>like</b> previously accomplished spelling TTTV.

Most smaller towns suffered badly, except for those in western Greater Poland, where the remarkable ascent of Wschowa took place.|$|E
25|$|The {{vocabulary}} of Teochew shares {{a lot of}} similarities with Cantonese because of their continuous contact with each <b>other.</b> <b>Like</b> Cantonese, Teochew {{has a great deal}} of monosyllabic words. However, ever since the standardisation of Modern Standard Chinese, Teochew has absorbed a lot of Putonghua vocabulary, which is predominantly polysyllabic. Also, Teochew varieties in Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia have also borrowed extensively from Malay.|$|E
25|$|The Gall–Peters {{projection}} is {{a rectangular}} map projection that maps all areas {{such that they}} have the correct sizes relative to each <b>other.</b> <b>Like</b> any equal-area projection, it achieves this goal by distorting most shapes. The projection is a particular example of the cylindrical equal-area projection in that it sets latitudes 45° north and south as the regions on the map that have no distortion.|$|E

25|$|In 1907, a vocal {{group of}} Hindu hard-liners within the Indian National Congress {{movement}} separated {{from it and}} started to pursue a pro-Hindu movement openly. This group was spearheaded by the famous trio of Lal-Bal-Pal - Lala Lajpat Rai, Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Bipin Chandra Pal of Punjab, Bombay and Bengal provinces respectively. Their influence spread rapidly among <b>other</b> <b>like</b> minded Hindus - they called it Hindu nationalism - {{and it became a}} cause of serious concern for Muslims.|$|E
25|$|Transferring {{within the}} Public Service, Somare became a radio {{broadcaster}} based in Wewak in the East Sepik Province. He received further {{training at the}} Administrative College at Waigani in 1965. Following numerous conflicts with his superiors concerning his outspoken political comments, he was transferred from broadcasting to administrative roles, and left the Public Service to contest the elections for the second House of Assembly in 1968 {{as a member of}} the Pangu Party which he had founded with <b>other</b> <b>like</b> minds in 1967.|$|E
25|$|Another study (Chen & Li, 2001) sequenced 53 non-repetitive, intergenic DNA {{segments}} from a human, a chimpanzee, a gorilla, and orangutan. When the DNA sequences were concatenated to {{a single}} long sequence, the generated neighbor-joining tree supported the Homo-Pan clade with 100% bootstrap (that is that humans and chimpanzees are the closest related species of the four). When three species are fairly closely related to each <b>other</b> (<b>like</b> human, chimpanzee and gorilla), the trees obtained from DNA sequence data may not be congruent with the tree that represents the speciation (species tree).|$|E

25|$|The {{concept of}} race in Brazil is complex. A Brazilian child was never {{automatically}} identified with the racial type of {{one or both of}} his or her parents, nor were there only two categories to choose from. Between an individual of unmixed West African descent and a very light mulatto individual, more than a dozen racial categories were acknowledged, based on various combinations of hair color, hair texture, eye color, and skin color. These types grade into each <b>other</b> <b>like</b> the colors of the spectrum, and no one category stands significantly isolated from the rest. In Brazil, people are classified by appearance, not heredity.|$|E
25|$|Eastern Orthodox {{find the}} first {{instance}} of an image or icon in the Bible when God made man in His own image (Septuagint Greek eikona), in Genesis 1:26-27. In Exodus, God commanded that the Israelites not make any graven image; but soon afterwards, he commanded that they make graven images of cherubim and <b>other</b> <b>like</b> things, both as statues and woven on tapestries. Later, Solomon included still more such imagery when he built the first temple. Eastern Orthodox believe these qualify as icons, in that they were visible images depicting heavenly beings and, {{in the case of}} the cherubim, used to indirectly indicate God's presence above the Ark.|$|E
25|$|The wave theory {{predicted}} that light waves could interfere with each <b>other</b> <b>like</b> sound waves (as noted around 1800 by Thomas Young). Young showed {{by means of}} a diffraction experiment that light behaved as waves. He also proposed that different colours were caused by different wavelengths of light, and explained colour vision in terms of three-coloured receptors in the eye. Another supporter of the wave theory was Leonhard Euler. He argued in Nova theoria lucis et colorum (1746) that diffraction could more easily be explained by a wave theory. In 1816 André-Marie Ampère gave Augustin-Jean Fresnel an idea that the polarization of light {{can be explained by the}} wave theory if light were a transverse wave.|$|E
