Baldaccini, in which the bills of pigeons were applied with a strong odor, showed results that the pigeons had less accurate initial orientation. Baldaccini also performed an experiment in which he reared pigeons in a loft in which the wind was deflected by 45 degrees. Baldaccini's results showed that a deflection in the wind while the pigeons were young proved to have an effect on their initial orientation after being released. Keeton replicated this experiment but found that there was a smaller deflection than the results in Baldaccini's experiment in Italy. [...] Keeton speculated that there may be an effect on initial orientation based on an <b>olfactory</b> <b>map,</b> but the experiment was too general for proving that this was indeed what was occurring in this experiment.|$|E

40|$|The sensory {{basis of}} the navigational map {{remains one of the}} most {{important}} and intriguing questions in animal behaviour. In birds, odours have been hypothesized to provide the primary source of map information. Convincing tests have shown that experienced homing pigeons rely on map information obtained at sites where they are exposed to natural odours, even if subsequently released (without additional olfactory information) at a different site. These findings have been interpreted as support for the <b>olfactory</b> <b>map</b> hypothesis. Using this ‘false-release-site’ (FRS) approach, we compared the effects of exposure to natural odours with that of exposure to a series of artificial odours lacking spatial information. Our findings show that olfactory exposure to either natural or artificial odours at an FRS caused pigeons to rely on map information obtained at the FRS, even if subsequently released at the true-release site in the opposite direction from the home loft. Because artificial odours did not provide map information, however, the findings clearly demonstrate that olfactory exposure provides no navigational information to pigeons whatsoever; instead it activates an independent non-olfactory map system. This test decisively contradicts the <b>olfactory</b> <b>map</b> hypothesis, which predicts that olfactory cues are the primary source of navigational information used by birds...|$|E

40|$|The role of {{environmental}} olfactory information in pigeon navigation {{has been extensively}} studied by analysing vanishing bearing distributions and homing performances of homing pigeons subjected to manipulation of their olfactory perception and/or the olfactory information they were exposed to during transportation and at the release site. However, their behaviour during the homing flight remains undocumented. In this experiment we report the analysis of tracks of birds made anosmic at the release site by washing their olfactory mucosa with zinc sulfate. We thus can assess the role of local odours at the release site {{as well as the}} role {{of environmental}} odours perceived on the way, far from the release site. We observed that pigeons transported and kept at the release site in purified air and made anosmic at the release site were unable to orient towards home and were impaired at homing. By contrast, pigeons allowed to smell environmental odours during transportation and at the release site, although made anosmic prior to release, displayed unimpaired homeward orientation, but nevertheless showed impaired homing performance. These results are consistent with the view that local odours at the release site are critical for determining the direction of displacement (<b>olfactory</b> <b>map)</b> and suggest that pigeons consult the <b>olfactory</b> <b>map</b> also during their homing flight {{in order to be able}} to find their way home...|$|E

40|$|The {{mammalian}} {{sense of}} smell relies on the detection of odorants by a large family of G protein coupled receptors, encoded by ~ 1300 different genes in mice (Buck and Axel, 1991; Zhang et al., 2007). These odorant receptors (ORs) are expressed in olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) in the main olfactory epithelium (MOE). A key feature of the mammalian olfactory system is that each OSN expresses only one of 2600 potential OR alleles (Chess et al., 1994; Malnic et al., 1999) such that {{the expression of a}} single specific OR protein establishes the odorant selectivity and identity of an OSN. Several layers of regulation control odorant receptor choice (Nguyen et al., 2007). Understanding this regulatory hierarchy of OR gene expression is critical in elucidating how odorant receptor choice is orchestrated and how ORs pattern the system. Precise control of OR expression is fundamental for the assembly and operation of the MOE and the main olfactory bulb (MOB). ORs play an instructive role in OSN axon guidance and the generation of a topographic glomerular map in the MOB (Malnic et al., 1999; Ressler et al., 1994; Vassar et al., 1994; Mombaerts et al., 1996; Wang et al., 1998). This first order glomerular map resides on the surface of both olfactory bulbs and is mirror symmetric, i. e. each bulb is comprised of identical lateral and medial glomeruli (Ressler et al., 1994; Vassar et al., 1994; Mombaerts et al., 1996; Belluscio and Katz, 2001). These isofunctional glomeruli are precisely and reciprocally connected by a second order intrabulbar map directly beneath the surface glomerular map (Schoenfeld et al., 1985; Belluscio et al., 2002; Lodovichi et al., 2003). Neural activity {{plays an important role in}} establishing and shaping the connections within these <b>olfactory</b> <b>maps</b> and defines the functional organization of the system (Cummings and Belluscio, 2008). <b>Olfactory</b> <b>maps</b> likely result from a combination of neuronal activity and chemical guidance cues. While many families of guidance molecules have been found to be expressed in the olfactory system, their role in organization and function are not determined. GDNF and its receptor GFRα 1 have been detected in the main olfactory system (Cao et al., 2006; Maroldt et al., 2005; Nosrat et al., 1997; Paratcha et al., 2006; Trupp et al., 1997), but their specific cellular localization and importance in the functional organization of the olfactory system is still unknown. Understanding the functional roles of GDNF signaling may provide a molecular basis for factors that pattern the olfactory system. This thesis investigates the mechanisms that regulate five fundamental components of olfactory system assembly and function: 1) odorant receptor expression, 2) odorant receptor choice, 3) OSN axon guidance, 4) <b>olfactory</b> <b>maps,</b> and 5) guidance molecules. Thematically specified, these mechanisms include the OR coding sequence in OR gene regulation, timing of OR expression, activity in the intrabulbar map, GDNF signaling in assembly and function, and GFRα 1 in olfactory interneuron development...|$|R
40|$|Sensory systems must map {{accurate}} {{representations of}} the external world in the brain. Although the physical senses of touch and vision build topographic {{representations of the}} spatial coordinates {{of the body and}} the field of view, the chemical sense of olfaction maps discontinuous features of chemical space, comprising an extremely large number of possible odor stimuli. In both mammals and insects, olfactory circuits are wired according to the convergence of axons from sensory neurons expressing the same odorant receptor. Synapses are organized into distinctive spherical neuropils—the olfactory glomeruli—that connect sensory input with output neurons and local modulatory interneurons.

Sema 3 F is secreted by early-arriving axons of OSNs and is deposited at the anterodorsal OB to repel Nrp 2 -positive axons that arrive later.

40|$|Olfactory systems utilize {{discrete}} neural {{pathways to}} process and integrate odorant information.

We {{found that the}} leucine-rich repeat (LRR) transmembrane protein Capricious (Caps) was differentially expressed in different classes of PNs. Loss-of-function and gain-of-function studies indicated that Caps instructs the segregation of Caps-positive and Caps-negative PN dendrites to discrete glomerular targets. Moreover, Caps-mediated PN dendrite targeting was independent of presynaptic ORNs and did not involve homophilic interactions. The closely related protein Tartan was partially redundant with Caps. These LRR proteins are probably part of a combinatorial cell-surface code that instructs discrete <b>olfactory</b> <b>map</b> formation. ...|$|E
40|$|SummaryOlfactory sensory neurons {{expressing a}} common {{receptor}} gene converge onto {{one or a}} few glomeruli with stereotyped positions within the mouse main olfactory bulb (MOB), producing a map of ∼ 1800 olfactory columns representing ∼ 1000 odorant receptors. Here, we report that this precise <b>olfactory</b> <b>map</b> is maintained over several synapses that ultimately cross MOB hemispheres to link bilateral isofunctional olfactory columns. Focal injection of tracer into genetically identified glomeruli revealed an exquisite topography that involves a bilateral connection via the anterior olfactory nucleus pars externa (AONpE) that links isofunctional olfactory columns in the contralateral MOB. Physiological and behavioral assays revealed an important role for the AONpE in bilateral exchange of odorant-specific information. These results indicate that the interbulbar link through the AONpE integrates bilateral olfactory sensory maps and exchanges olfactory information, positioning it as a unique model system for studying interhemispheric connections...|$|E

The CT 1 carbohydrate has been shown to modulate adhesion of nerve terminals to the extracellular matrix and to synaptic proteins. The axons of the CT 1 -positive primary olfactory neurons terminate in a subpopulation of glomeruli in the olfactory bulb. Four lines of evidence support the view that CT 1 glomeruli are topographically fixed. First, CT 1 glomeruli were restricted predominantly to the dorsomedial olfactory bulb and were absent from large patches of the ventrolateral bulb. Second, similar distributions were observed for CT 1 glomeruli on both the left and right olfactory bulbs of each animal, and between animals. Third, CT 1 glomeruli were typically present as small clusters of 2 - 4 glomeruli. Fourth, a single CT 1 glomerulus was always apposed to the glomeruli innervated by axons expressing the M 72 odorant receptor. We also show that the CT 1 carbohydrate is lost in gain-of-function transgenic mice over-expressing the blood group A glycosyltransferase in which there is aberrant targeting of M 72 axons.

Here, we show that a functional remodeling of the <b>olfactory</b> <b>map</b> is mediated by two parallel neuromodulatory systems that act in opposing directions on olfactory attraction and aversion {{at the level of the}} first synapse. Short neuropeptide F sensitizes an antennal lobe glomerulus wired for attraction, while tachykinin (DTK) suppresses activity of a glomerulus wired for aversion.

40|$|Indexation en coursInternational audienceOdorant receptors (ORs) control {{several aspects}} of cell fate in {{olfactory}} sensory neurons (OSNs), including singular gene choice and axonal identity. The mechanisms of OR-induced axon guidance have been suggested to principally rely on G-protein signalling. Here, we report that for a subset of OSNs, deleting G proteins or altering their levels of signalling does not affect axonal identity. Signalling-deficient ORs or surrogate receptors that are unable to couple to Gs/Golf still provide axons with distinct identities and the anterior-posterior targeting of axons does not correlate with the levels of cAMP produced by genetic modifications. In addition, we refine the models of negative feedback by showing that ectopic ORs can be robustly expressed without suppressing endogenous gene choice. In conclusion, our results uncover a new feature of ORs, showing that they can instruct axonal identity and regulate <b>olfactory</b> <b>map</b> formation independent of canonical G-protein signalling and cAMP production...|$|E
40|$|The {{olfactory}} system presents a practical model for investigating basic mechanisms involved in patterning connections between peripheral sensory neurons and central targets.

These advances have revitalized interest in axon guidance molecules in establishing olfactory topography, but also open new questions regarding how these patterns of guidance cues are established and function, and what other pathways, such as glycosylation, might be involved.

40|$|SummaryOlfactory neurons project their axons to {{spatially}} invariant glomeruli in the olfactory bulb, {{forming an}} ordered pattern of innervation comprising the <b>olfactory</b> sensory <b>map.</b> A mirror symmetry exists within this map, such that neurons expressing a given receptor typically project to one glomerulus on the medial face and one glomerulus on the lateral {{face of the}} bulb. The mechanisms underlying an olfactory neuron's choice to project medially versus laterally remain largely unknown, however. Here we demonstrate that insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling is required for sensory innervation of the lateral olfactory bulb. Mutations that eliminate IGF signaling cause axons destined for targets in the lateral bulb to shift to ectopic sites on the ventral-medial surface. Using primary cultures of olfactory and cerebellar neurons, we further show that IGF is a chemoattractant for axon growth cones.

40|$|SummaryBackground: Olfactory {{receptor}} neurons (ORNs) convey chemical {{information into}} the brain, producing internal representations of odors {{detected in the}} periphery. A comprehensive understanding of the molecular and neural mechanisms of odor detection and processing requires complete maps of odorant receptor (Or) expression and ORN connectivity, preferably at single-cell resolution. Results: We have constructed near-complete maps of Or expression and ORN targeting in the Drosophila <b>olfactory</b> system. These <b>maps</b> confirm the general validity of the “one neuron—one receptor” and “one glomerulus—one receptor” principles and reveal several additional features of olfactory organization. ORNs in distinct sensilla types project to distinct regions of the antennal lobe, but neighbor relations are not preserved. ORNs grouped in the same sensilla do not express similar receptors, but similar receptors tend to map to closely appositioned glomeruli in the antennal lobe. This organization may serve to ensure that odor representations are dispersed in the periphery but clustered centrally. Integrated with electrophysiological data, these maps also predict glomerular representations of specific odorants. Representations of aliphatic and aromatic compounds are spatially segregated, with those of aliphatic compounds arranged topographically according to carbon chain length. Conclusions: These Or expression and ORN connectivity maps provide further insight into the molecular, anatomical, and functional organization of the Drosophila <b>olfactory</b> system. Our <b>maps</b> also provide an essential resource for investigating how internal odor representations are generated {{and how they are}} further processed and transmitted to higher brain centers...|$|R

Cortical neurons in highly restricted areas receive inputs from glomeruli that spread widely in the olfactory bulb.

40|$|SummaryOlfaction plays many {{well-established}} {{roles in}} vertebrate sensory perception [1, 2]. More controversial is {{the claim that}} olfactory cues underlie the large-scale geographic “map” sense used by birds and other vertebrates [3, 4]. The most common procedure used to investigate the role of odors in avian homing is to experimentally produce anosmia and/or block access to natural odors [4, 5]. Although by no means universal in their results, many of these experiments have shown disorientation and/or decreased homing success [6 – 8], generally interpreted as evidence for the <b>olfactory</b> <b>map</b> hypothesis. Here, in addition to control (CO) birds exposed to natural odors and birds deprived of odors (“no odor”; NO) during displacement to unfamiliar release sites, we included a group exposed to artificial odors (“novel odors”; NV) that could not provide navigational information [9]. Although all groups had access to natural odors at release sites, the vanishing bearings of NO birds were disoriented, whereas those of NV birds were homeward oriented and indistinguishable from those of CO birds. These findings show that odors, rather than providing navigational information, activate a nonolfactory path integration system...|$|E
40|$|Shearwaters {{deprived}} of their olfactory sense before being displaced to distant sites have impaired homing ability but it is unknown what the role of olfaction is when birds navigate freely without their sense of smell. Furthermore, treatments used to induce anosmia and to disrupt magneto-reception in displacement experiments might influence non-specific factors {{not directly related to}} navigation and, as a consequence, the results of displacement experiments can have multiple interpretations. To address this, we GPS-tracked the free-ranging foraging trips of incubating Scopoli’s shearwaters within the Mediterranean Sea. As in previous experiments, shearwaters were either made anosmic with 4 % zinc sulphate solution, magnetically impaired by attachment of a strong neodymium magnet or were controls. We found that birds from all three treatments embarked on foraging trips, had indistinguishable at-sea schedules of behaviour and returned to the colony having gained mass. However, we found that in the pelagic return stage of their foraging trips, anosmic birds were not oriented towards the colony though coastal navigation was unaffected. These results support the case for zinc sulphate having a specific effect on the navigational ability of shearwaters and thus the view that seabirds consult an <b>olfactory</b> <b>map</b> to guide them across seascapes...|$|E
40|$|Background : Drosophila larvae possess only 21 odorant-receptor neurons (ORNs), whereas {{adults have}} 1, 300. Does this {{suggest that the}} larval {{olfactory}} system is built according to a different design than its adult counterpart, {{or is it just}} a miniature version thereof? Results : By genetically labeling single neurons with FLP-out and MARCM techniques, we analyze the connectivity of the larval olfactory circuit. We show that each of the 21 ORNs is unique and projects to one of 21 morphologically identifiable antennal-lobe glomeruli. Each glomerulus seems to be innervated by a single projection neuron. Each projection neuron sends its axon to one or two of about 28 glomeruli in the mushroom-body calyx. We have discovered at least seven types of projection neurons that stereotypically link an identified antennal-lobe glomerulus with an identified calycal glomerulus and thus create an <b>olfactory</b> <b>map</b> in a higher brain center. Conclusions : The basic design of the larval olfactory system is similar to the adult one. However, ORNs and projection neurons lack cellular redundancy and do not exhibit any convergent or divergent connectivity; 21 ORNs confront essentially similar numbers of antennal-lobe glomeruli, projection neurons, and calycal glomeruli. Hence, we propose the Drosophila larva as an “elementary” olfactory model system...|$|E
40|$|SummaryOlfactory systems confer the {{recognition}} and discrimination {{of a large}} number of structurally distinct odor molecules. Recent molecular analysis of odorant receptor (OR) genes and circuits has led to a model of odor coding in which a population of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) expressing a single OR converges upon a unique olfactory glomerulus. Activation of the OR can thus be read out by the activation of its cognate glomerulus [1, 2]. Drosophila is a powerful system in which to test this model because the entire repertoire of 62 ORs [3 – 6] can be manipulated genetically. However, a complete understanding of how fly olfactory circuits are organized is lacking [6 – 13]. Here, we present a nearly complete map of OR projections from OSNs to the antennal lobe (AL) in the fly brain. Four populations of OSNs coexpress two ORs along with Or 83 b, and a fifth expresses one OR and one gustatory receptor (GR) along with Or 83 b. One glomerulus receives coconvergent input from two separate populations of OSNs. Three ORs label sexually dimorphic glomeruli implicated in sexual courtship [14 – 16] and are thus candidate Drosophila pheromone receptors. This <b>olfactory</b> sensory <b>map</b> provides an experimental framework for relating ORs to glomeruli and ultimately behavior...|$|R
40|$|Little {{is known}} about the identities and {{functions}} of extracellular signaling molecules that work in concert with neuronal activity to regulate refinement and maintenance of the mouse <b>olfactory</b> sensory <b>map.</b> We show that expression of a dominant negative retinoic acid receptor (RAR) in olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) increased the number of glomeruli that incorrectly contained OSN axons expressing different odorant receptors. This phenotype became apparent postnatally, coincided with increased cell death, and was preceded by increased Neuropilin- 1 and reduced Kirrel- 2 expressions. Kirrel- 2 -mediated cell adhesion influences odorant receptor-specific axonal convergence and is regulated by odorant receptor signaling via the olfactory cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) ion channel. Accordingly, we found that inhibited RAR function correlated with reduced CNG channel expression. Naris occlusion experiments and analysis of CNG channel-deficient mice further indicated that RAR-regulated CNG channel levels influenced the intrinsic neuronal activity required for cell survival in the absence of odor stimulation. Finally, we showed that CNG channel activity regulated expression of the retinoic acid-degrading enzyme Cyp 26 B 1. Combined, these results identify a novel homeostatic feedback mechanism involving retinoic acid metabolism and CNG channel activity, which influences glomerular homogeneity and maintenance of precisely connected OSNs. —Öztokatli, H., Hörnberg, M., Berghard, A., Bohm, S. Retinoic acid receptor and CNGA 2 channel signaling are part of a regulatory feedback loop controlling axonal convergence and survival of olfactory sensory neurons...|$|R
40|$|Olfaction {{represents}} an important sensory modality for navigation of both homing pigeons and wild birds. Experimental evidence in homing pigeons showed that airborne volatile compounds {{carried by the}} winds at the home area are learned in association with wind directions. When displaced, pigeons obtain information on the direction of their displacement using local odors at the release site. Recently, the role of olfactory cues in navigation has been reported also for wild birds during migration. However, the question whether wild birds develop an <b>olfactory</b> navigational <b>map</b> similar to that described in homing pigeons or, alternatively, exploit the distribution of volatile compounds in different manner for reaching the goal is still an open question. Using an interdisciplinary approach, we evaluate the possibilities of reconstructing spatio-temporally explicit aerosol dispersion at large spatial scales using the particle dispersion model FLEXPART. By combining atmospheric information with particle dispersion models, atmospheric scientists predict the dispersion of pollutants for example, after nuclear fallouts or volcanic eruptions or wildfires, or in retrospect reconstruct the origin of emissions such as aerosols. Using simple assumptions, we reconstructed the putative origin of aerosols traveling {{to the location of}} migrating birds. We use the model to test whether the putative odor plume could have originated from an important stopover site. If the migrating birds knew this site and the associated plume from previous journeys, the odor could contribute to the reorientation towards the migratory corridor, as suggested for the model scenario in displaced Lesser black-backed gulls migrating from Northern Europe into Africa...|$|R
