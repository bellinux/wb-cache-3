50|$|John Gill introduced, in the 1950s, a {{very early}} - if not the first - grading system {{specifically}} designed for bouldering and not restricted to a particular area. The system, (B1, B2, B3), had two subjective levels of difficulty, and one <b>objective</b> <b>level,</b> and was predicated on prevailing and future standards attained in traditional rock climbing. The introduction of sport climbing some twenty years later and more intense competition weakened the philosophical underpinnings of the three-tiered structure, although climbers such as Jim Holloway adopted personal three-level systems similar to Gill's. Today, Gill's B-system is rarely used, abandoned in favor of open-ended scales of difficulty.|$|E

50|$|Berger's {{work was}} notably {{influenced}} by Max Weber. Weber {{focused on the}} empirical realities of rationality as a characteristic of action and rationalization. In comparison, Berger proposed the usage of the word 'options' rather than freedom as an empirical concept. Therefore, much of the empirical work of Berger and Weber have revolved around the relationship between modern rationalization and options for social action. Weber argued that rationalism can mean {{a variety of things}} at the subjective level of consciousness and at the <b>objective</b> <b>level</b> of social institutions. The connection between Berger's analysis of the sociology of religion in modern society and Max Weber's The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism aligns. Weber saw capitalism {{as a result of the}} Protestant secularisation of work ethic and morality in amassing wealth, which Berger integrates into his analysis about the effects of losing the non-secular foundations for belief about life's ultimate meaning.|$|E

40|$|Ethics forms a {{subsystem}} {{of society}} that is connected to other subsystems such as economy, technology, polity, religion, culture, ecology, science, medicine, etc. Hence if a human being acts in the ethical system of society, (s) he also acts in another societal system. This results in a differentiation of the ethical system and of subsystems such as economical ethics, technological ethics, political ethics, religious ethics, cultural ethics, ecological ethics, scientific ethics, medical ethics, etc. The aim {{of this paper is}} to discuss the self-organization of the moral system, especially ethical issues and conflicts that characterize the emerging knowledge society. We identify four distinctive approaches based on the subject-object-relation in society: First there are subjective, individual ethics that conceive norms and values as individually constructed; secondly, objective ethics conceive norms and values on an <b>objective</b> <b>level.</b> The <b>objective</b> <b>level</b> can furthermore be understood in tw...|$|E

40|$|A pretest-treatment-posttest {{experimental}} {{comparison of}} three individual study support environments for an introductory Management Information Systems course indicated a positive trend in student achievement on structured examinations. The three environments studied include a textbook and class notes presentation method, and two Computer Instructional Support Environments (CISE), drill and practice, and tutorial. Of these, the drill and practice individual study support method displayed a consistently {{positive effect on}} examination achievement within each of seven MIS topics. Each topic examined could be classified {{on the basis of}} the level of learning objective, and further statistical analysis results indicate a strong correlation between the CISE drill and practice method and attaining a learning <b>objective</b> <b>level</b> of knowledge. Previous research in CISE implementation has been limited by the assumptions of single learning objective levels and single presentation methods, when in fact, the environment is highly complex. A series of experimental observations for introductory MIS topics, in which the learning <b>objective</b> <b>level</b> for each is identified, compares three support environments for individual study. Separate statistical analyses, performed on individual topics, indicate a higher level of achievement by student participants in the CISE Drill and Practice environment for score improvement and improvement in the time required to complete the posttest activity. Two ANOVA models examined the relationships between individual study support methods and topics within two classifications of learning objectives. These results indicate a strong relationship between study support method and learning <b>objective</b> <b>level</b> for text score improvement. The pretest-treatment-posttest experimental design used in this analysis may be replicated across additional topics within the Introductory MIS course to increase the number of topic observations in each learning objective classification. In addition, the experiment can be performed using the same topics to increase the sample size and further clarify the statistical results...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the satisficing decisionmaking process in a simple organization under multiple objectives. The role of aspiration <b>levels</b> or reference <b>objective</b> <b>levels</b> is stressed and a conceptual model of this behavior is presented. A specification or rather modification of the mathematical concept of a value (utility) function that describes the satisficing behavior is given; the modified value function, called the achievement scalarizing function, should not be only order preserving but also order approximating in a certain sense. It is shown that the notions of reference <b>objective</b> <b>levels</b> and achievement scalarizing functions form a mathematical basis not only for satisficing decision making but also for Pareto optimization; this basis is an alternative to or even stronger than the approaches based on weighting coefficients or typical value functions. This mathematical basis, which can also be considered as a generalization of the goal programming approach in multiobjective optimization, results in pragmatic approaches to many problems of multiobjective analysis, including the problem of interactive assessment of solutions to economic models for policy analysis and planning purposes...|$|R
