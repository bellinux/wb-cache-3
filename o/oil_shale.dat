5|$|Following the 1973 oil crisis, the <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> {{industry}} was restarted in several countries, {{but in the}} 1980s, when oil prices fell, many industries faced closure. The global <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> industry has grown again from the mid-1990s. In 2003, the <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> development program was initiated in the United States, and in 2005, the commercial leasing program for <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> and tar sands was introduced.|$|E
5|$|In June 1916, the Russian {{geologist}} Nikolay Pogrebov oversaw mining of {{the first}} tonnes of <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> at Pavandu and delivered it to Saint Petersburg (then Petrograd) Polytechnic Institute for large-scale experiments. These events marking {{the beginning of the}} Estonian <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> industry took place {{more than half a century}} after an <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> industry had emerged in Scotland, the leading <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> industry in 1916, and a decade before the industry emerged in China, which, besides Estonia, is today the other leading oil shale-exploiting country. In 1916 a total of 640–690tonnes of <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> were sent to Saint Petersburg for testing. The tests proved that the <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> was suitable for combustion as a solid fuel and for extraction of <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> gas and shale oil. Based on these promising results, a plan for <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> mining in Estonia was presented to the Emperor Nicholas II on 3 January 1917. On 13 February 1917, the Council of Ministers of Russia allocated 1.2million rubles to purchase land and start mining activities. After the February Revolution, the Russian Provisional Government appointed a special commissioner for <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> purchasing and stockpiling who began preliminary work for the digging of an <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> mine at Pavandu, with full-scale construction carried out by about 500workers, including war prisoners, in the summer of 1917. After the October Revolution, financing ceased and construction stopped. Two private Saint Petersburg firms, established specially for <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> mining, Böckel& Co. and Mutschnik& Co., which in the fall of 1916 had begun surface mining at Kukruse and Järve, respectively, also terminated their mining activities in 1917.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th and 19th centuries, Estonian <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> was {{described}} by several scientists and used as a low-grade fuel. Its use in industry commenced in 1916. Production of shale oil began in 1921 and <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> was first used to generate electrical power in 1924. Shortly thereafter, systematic research into <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> and its products began, and in 1938 a department of mining was established at Tallinn Technical University. After World War II, Estonian <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> gas was used in Saint Petersburg (then called Leningrad) and in northern cities in Estonia {{as a substitute for}} natural gas. Increased need for electricity in the north-west of the Soviet Union led to the construction of large oil shale-fired power stations. <b>Oil</b> <b>shale</b> extraction peaked in 1980. Subsequently, the launch of nuclear reactors in Russia, particularly the Leningrad Nuclear Power Station, reduced demand for electricity produced from <b>oil</b> <b>shale,</b> and, along with a post-Soviet restructuring of the industry in the 1990s, led to a decrease in <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> mining. After decreasing for two decades, <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> mining started to increase again {{at the beginning of the}} 21st century.|$|E
5000|$|Type 1 <b>oil</b> <b>shales</b> yield larger {{amount of}} {{volatile}} or extractable compounds than other types upon pyrolysis.

50|$|General {{composition}} of <b>oil</b> <b>shales</b> constitutes inorganic matrix, bitumens, and kerogen. <b>Oil</b> <b>shales</b> differ from oil-bearing shales, shale deposits that contain petroleum (tight oil) that is sometimes produced from drilled wells. Examples of oil-bearing shales are the Bakken Formation, Pierre Shale, Niobrara Formation, and Eagle Ford Formation.|$|R
40|$|The main petrological {{factors that}} control occurrences and {{properties}} of <b>oil</b> <b>shales</b> are depositional environments, organic sources, diagenesis and maturation.

5|$|Environmental activists, {{including}} {{members of}} Greenpeace, have organized strong protests against the <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> industry. In one result, Queensland Energy Resources put the proposed Stuart <b>Oil</b> <b>Shale</b> Project in Australia on hold in 2004.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} World War II, the <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> {{industry}} declined due to {{the discovery}} of large supplies of easily accessible and cheaper crude oil. <b>Oil</b> <b>shale</b> production however, continued to grow in Estonia, Russia and China.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, 70% of <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> mined in Estonia {{was used}} for power generation, and about 85% of Estonia's {{electricity}} was generated from <b>oil</b> <b>shale.</b> About 29% of produced electricity was exported to Finland, Latvia, and Lithuania.|$|E
500|$|Another classification, {{known as}} the van Krevelen diagram, assigns kerogen types, {{depending}} on the hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen content of oil shales' original organic matter. The most commonly used classification of <b>oil</b> <b>shales,</b> developed between 1987 and 1991 by Adrian C. Hutton, adapts petrographic terms from coal terminology. This classification designates <b>oil</b> <b>shales</b> as terrestrial, lacustrine (lake-bottom-deposited), or marine (ocean bottom-deposited), based on {{the environment of the}} initial biomass deposit. [...] Known <b>oil</b> <b>shales</b> are predominantly aquatic (marine, lacustrine) origin. [...] Hutton's classification scheme has proven useful in estimating the yield and composition of the extracted oil.|$|R

5|$|No {{consensus}} {{has been}} reached on the exact depositional nature of the Irati <b>oil</b> <b>shale.</b> One theory suggests that the organic material in the Irati <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> originated from algae deposited in a lacustrine environment with salinity varying from that of freshwater to brackish water. Other theory suggests that the organic sediment may have been deposited in a shallow, partially restricted marine environment. Hutton's classification describes it as a marine source <b>oil</b> <b>shale.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Oil</b> <b>shale</b> is {{used for}} cement {{production}} by Kunda Nordic Cement in Estonia, by Holcim in Germany, and by Fushun cement factory in China. <b>Oil</b> <b>shale</b> {{can also be used}} for production of different chemical products, construction materials, and pharmaceutical products, e.g. ammonium bituminosulfonate. However, use of <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> for production of these products is still very rare and in experimental stages only.|$|E
5|$|On 9 May 1922 {{the first}} {{international}} discussion of Estonian kukersite {{took place at the}} 64th meeting of the Institution of Petroleum Technologists. Systematic research into <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> and its products began at Tartu University's <b>Oil</b> <b>Shale</b> Research Laboratory in 1925, initiated by professor Paul Kogerman. In 1937, the Geological Committee under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the Institute of Natural Resources, an independent academic institution, were established.

Estonian <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> industries conducted tests of <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> samples from Australia, Bulgaria, Germany and South Africa.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, <b>oil</b> <b>shales</b> are source rocks {{that have not}} been exposed to heat or {{pressure}} long enough to convert their trapped hydrocarbons into crude oil. Technically speaking, <b>oil</b> <b>shales</b> are not always shales and do not contain oil, but are fined-grain sedimentary rocks containing an insoluble organic solid called kerogen.

It occurs in abundance throughout the formation and appears in stratigraphically analogous locations along the California coast. Since its identification and analysis, 28,30-bisnorhopane has been discovered in <b>oil</b> <b>shales</b> around the globe, including lacustrine and offshore deposits of Brazil, silicified shales of the Eocene in Gabon, the Kimmeridge Clay Formation in the North Sea, and in Western Australian <b>oil</b> <b>shales.</b>|$|R

5|$|Cannel coal (also called candle coal) {{is a type}} of {{terrestrial}} shale, which is hydrogen-rich brown to black coal, sometimes with shaly texture, composed of resins, spores, waxes, cutinaceous and corky materials derived from terrestrial vascular plants as well as varied amounts of vitrinite and inertinite. Lacustrine shales consist of Lamosite and Torbanite. Lamosite is a pale-brown and grayish-brown to dark-gray to black <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> whose chief organic constituent is lamalginite derived from lacustrine planktonic algae. Torbanite, named after Torbane Hill in Scotland, is a black <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> whose organic matter is telalginite derived from lipid-rich Botryococcus and related algal forms. Marine shales consist of three varieties, namely Kukersite, Tasmanite, and Marinite. Kukersite, named after Kukruse in Estonia, is a light-brown marine <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> whose principal organic component is telalginite derived from the green alga, Gloeocapsomorpha prisca. Tasmanite, named after Tasmania, is a brown to black <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> whose organic matter consists of telalginite derived chiefly from unicellular tasmanitid algae of marine origin. Marinite is a gray to dark-gray to black <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> of marine origin in which the chief organic components are lamalginite and bituminite derived from marine phytoplankton with varied admixtures of bitumen, telalginite, and vitrinite.|$|E
5|$|Most {{exploitation}} of <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> involves mining followed by shipping elsewhere, after {{which one can}} burn the shale directly to generate electricity, or undertake further processing. The most common methods of surface mining involve open pit mining and strip mining. These procedures remove most of the overlying material to expose the deposits of <b>oil</b> <b>shale,</b> and become practical when the deposits occur near the surface. Underground mining of <b>oil</b> <b>shale,</b> which removes less of the overlying material, employs the room-and-pillar method.|$|E
5|$|<b>Oil</b> <b>shale</b> {{has been}} used for {{industrial}} purposes since the early 17th century, when it was mined for its minerals. Since the late 19th century, shale oil has also been used for its oil content and as a low grade fuel for power generation. However, barring countries having significant <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> deposits, its use for power generation is not particularly widespread. Similarly, <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> is a source for production of synthetic crude oil and it is seen as a solution towards increasing domestic production of oil in countries that are reliant on imports.|$|E
