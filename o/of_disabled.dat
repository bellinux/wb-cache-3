40|$|BACKGROUND: Disabling fatigue is {{the main}} illness related reason for {{prolonged}} absence from school. Although there are accepted criteria for diagnosing chronic fatigue in adults, it remains uncertain as to how best to define disabling fatigue and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) in children and adolescents. In this population-based study, {{the aim was to}} identify children who had experienced an episode <b>of</b> <b>disabling</b> fatigue and examine the clinical and demographic differences between those individuals who fulfilled a narrow definition <b>of</b> <b>disabling</b> fatigue and those who fulfilled broader definitions <b>of</b> <b>disabling</b> fatigue. METHODS: Participants (aged 8 - 17 years) were identified from a population-based twin register. Parent report was used to identify children who had ever experienced a period <b>of</b> <b>disabling</b> fatigue. Standardised telephone interviews were then conducted with the parents of these affected children. Data on clinical and demographic characteristics, including age of onset, gender, days per week affected, hours per day spent resting, absence from school, comorbidity with depression and a global measure of impairment due to the fatigue, were examined. A narrow definition was defined as a minimum <b>of</b> 6 months <b>disabling</b> fatigue plus at least 4 associated symptoms, which is comparable to the operational criteria for CFS in adults. Broader definitions included those with at least 3 months <b>of</b> <b>disabling</b> fatigue and 4 or more of the associated symptoms and those with simply a minimum of 3 months <b>of</b> <b>disabling</b> fatigue. Groups were mutually exclusive. RESULTS: Questionnaires were returned by 1468 families (65...|$|R

When the issues were raised in Parliament, MCYS parliamentary secretary Teo Ser Luck promised to study plans to give disabled athletes greater support and to include them in sporting programmes such as Project 0812, a training programme for top Singaporean sportspeople. Two months later, the cash rewards for Paralympic medals were doubled and funding for the Singapore National Paralympic Council was increased.|$|E

Results Questionnaires were returned by 1468 families (65 % response rate) and telephone interviews were completed on 99 of the 129 participants (77 %) who had experienced fatigue. There {{were no significant differences in}} demographic and clinical characteristics or levels of impairment between those who fulfilled the narrower definition and those who fulfilled the broader definitions. The only exception was the reported number of days per week that the child was affected by the fatigue. All groups demonstrated evidence of substantial impairment associated with the fatigue. Conclusion Children and adolescents who do not fulfil the current narrow definition of CFS but do suffer from disabling fatigue show comparable and substantial impairment. In primary care settings, a broader definition <b>of</b> <b>disabling</b> fatigue would improve the identification of impaired children and adolescents who require support. </p...|$|R

5|$|For {{those who}} are single when injured or who become single, SCI causes {{difficulties}} and insecurities with respect to one's ability to meet new partners and start relationships. In some settings, beauty standards cause people to view disabled bodies as less attractive, limiting the options for sexual and romantic partners {{of people with disabilities}} like SCI. Furthermore, physical disabilities are stigmatized, causing people to avoid contact with disabled people, particularly those with highly visible conditions like SCI. The stigma may cause people with SCI to experience self-consciousness and embarrassment in public. They can increase their social success by using impression management techniques to change how they are perceived and create a more positive image of themselves in others' eyes. Physical limitations create difficulties; with lowered independence comes reduced social interaction and fewer opportunities to find partners. Difficulties with mobility and the lack <b>of</b> <b>disabled</b> accessibility of social spaces (e.g. lack of wheelchair ramps) create a further barrier to social activity and limit the ability to meet partners. Isolation and its associated risk of depression can be limited by participating in physical activities, social gatherings, clubs, and online chat and dating.|$|E
