Flats were built in a Constructivist idiom in Kharkiv, Moscow and Leningrad and in smaller towns. Ginzburg also designed a government building in Alma-Ata, while the Vesnin brothers designed a School of Film Actors in Moscow.

A requirement for large-scaled deployment are extremely low-cost sensors though running with minimal resources regarding computational power, energy consumption, and memory size. Cryptographic schemes are highly at demand for providing security mechanisms in such WSNs. Asymmetric cryptography allows for flexible key management schemes at the cost of high resource demands whereas symmetric cryptography provides resource efficient solutions. In this work we sketch an approach for (1) providing asymmetric cryptography during the one-time bootstrapping phase and (2) swap it by other security protocols for operation of the WSN in order to minimize memory size demands. Our mechanism is based on dynamic code update, e. g. provided by the FlexCup plug-in for TinyOS. Our approach yields the best of two worlds in order to maximize flexibility and life-span and minimize resource demands...|$|R

[...] Function ranking represents a hierarchy in the images, by way that the man is shown in front and largest in front of women and children. [...] The family is typically depicted in a way that gives the father and a son a close relationship, and the mother and a daughter a close relationship. [...] The ritualization of subordination is when women are shown in a lower ranking or worth of an image, and they are smaller, underneath, and overall of lesser importance to men.
