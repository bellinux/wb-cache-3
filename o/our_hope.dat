25|$|We {{remember}} {{the suffering and}} the death of Jews and all those others who were persecuted in World War II.... We commemorate the days of April in 1945 when American and Allied Troops liberated Nazi death camps.... The tragedy...took place...in our life time. We share the wounds of the survivors. We recall the pain only because we must never permit it to come again.... Our spirit is strengthened by remembering and <b>our</b> <b>hope</b> is in our strength.|$|E
25|$|The {{principal}} results {{which were}} {{expected from the}} exploration of the Mekong may be summed up in a few words. It was desired, first, that the old maps should be rectified, and the navigability of the river tried, it being <b>our</b> <b>hope</b> that we might bind together French Cochin-China and the western provinces of China by means of it. Were the rapids, of whose existence we knew, an absolute barrier? Were the islands of Khon an impassable difficulty? Was there any truth in the opinion of geographers who, believed that there was a communication between the Meïnam and the Mekong? To gather information respecting the sources of the latter, if it proved impossible to reach them; to solve the different geographical problems which would naturally offer, was {{the first part of the}} programme the commission had to carry out.|$|E

500|$|East Coker gives {{a message}} of hope that the English {{communities}} would survive through World War II. In a letter dated 9 February 1940, Eliot stated, [...] "We can have very little hope of contributing to any immediate social change; and we are more disposed to see <b>our</b> <b>hope</b> in modest and local beginnings, than in transforming the whole world at once... We must keep alive aspirations which can remain valid throughout the longest and darkest period of universal calamity and degradation." [...] The poem also relied on the war {{as a way to}} connect to Eliot's idea that there was a united humanity. In particular, Stephen Spender claimed that [...] "the war modified [...] attitude by convincing him that there was a Western cause to be positively defended. And after the war there was a Germany to be brought back within the Western tradition".|$|E
500|$|According to {{designer}} Harry Teasley, id's 1993 FPS Doom {{was a major}} influence, and {{the team}} wanted Half-Life to [...] "scare you like Doom did". Newell said that [...] "Half-Life in many ways was a reactionary response to the trivialization {{of the experience of}} the first-person genre. Many of us {{had fallen in love with}} video games because of the phenomenological possibilities of the field and felt like the industry was reducing the experiences to least common denominators rather than exploring those possibilities. <b>Our</b> <b>hope</b> was that building worlds and characters would be more compelling than building shooting galleries." [...] The project had the working title Quiver, after the Arrowhead military base from Stephen King's 1980 novella The Mist, an early inspiration for the game. The name Half-Life was chosen because it was evocative of the theme, not clichéd, and had a corresponding visual symbol: the Greek letter λ (lower-case lambda), which represents the decay constant in the half-life equation.|$|E
500|$|The annual Christmas Drive {{takes place}} in December, during the two weeks prior to Christmas vacation. The fundraiser is a school-wide effort, jointly coordinated by Student Government, National Honor Society, and the Outreach Society. The {{fundraising}} efforts are varied and creative; boys donate money to remain unshaven (a violation of school policy), the National Honor Society sells baked goods, the Mother's Club serves breakfast, and each class competes to gather the most pennies in the school-wide [...] "penny wars". The Christmas Drive was featured in the cover story of the December 2010 issue of Christ is <b>our</b> <b>Hope,</b> the official magazine of the Diocese of Joliet. In the previous year the school had raised $54,500. The money was used to support a mission trip in Appalachia, and also to provide food, school supplies, blankets, and gifts to local families in the Chicago area. In 2010, the student body raised $66,200. In 2014, they set the school record by raising over $86,000.|$|E

500|$|The [...] {{scheduled}} debut {{air date}} for Gone Too Far had been October 5, 2009. After Goldstein's death, DiSanto acknowledged {{the possibility that}} placing Goldstein near other addicts helped contribute to his relapse. After debating whether to air the show {{in the wake of}} his death, MTV decided to debut it on October 12. His family stated: [...] "It is <b>our</b> <b>hope</b> through airing this show that people will get to see the side of Adam that we knew and loved. The decision to air the show has been difficult, but we do this with the profound belief that it will inspire others to seek help". Favreau also consulted people close to Goldstein about whether the footage of him in Iron Man 2 should still be used; they agreed unanimously it should remain. Favreau said that following his death, [...] "there was never any doubt" [...] the film would be dedicated to him.|$|E
500|$|In November 2011, it was {{revealed}} on Tegan and Sara Quinn's official website that they were writing new material for their seventh studio album: [...] " [...] are back in our home studios working away at more songs. We’re {{really looking forward to}} making a new record now. <b>Our</b> <b>hope</b> is to be in the studio by early 2012." [...] "I'm Not Your Hero" [...] was written for the album, which was later named Heartthrob and recorded between February and May 2012. Sara, who wrote the lyrics, said the song was based on her life as a teenager when she was unable to identify with the lives of pop culture figures and had unforeseen thoughts about her future. She claimed the lyrics were about her political views from watching The West Wing, her identity and her sexuality. Tegan stated that when Sara showed the song to her and the producers, it was initially more of a love song and much more acoustic and slow than the final mix that would be released, and said she [...] "was haunted by it almost immediately. I found the verses to be quintessential Sara." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{morning after}} the November 2015 Paris attacks, German pianist Davide Martello brought a grand piano to the street {{out in front of}} the Bataclan, where 89 concertgoers had been shot dead the night before, and {{performed}} an instrumental version to honour the victims of the attacks; video of his performance went viral. This led Katy Waldman of Slate to ponder why [...] "Imagine" [...] had become so frequently performed as a response to tragedy. In addition to its general popularity, she noted its musical simplicity, its key of C major, [...] "the plainest and least complicated key, with no sharps or flats" [...] aside from one passage with [...] "a plaintive major seventh chord that allows a tiny bit of E minor into the tonic". That piano part, [...] "gentle as a rocking chair", underpins lyrics that, Waldman says, [...] "belongs to the tradition of hymns or spirituals that visualize a glorious afterlife without prophesizing any immediate end to suffering on earth". This understanding is also compounded by the historical context of Lennon's own violent death, [...] "remind us that the universe can run ramshod over idealistic people". Ultimately, the song [...] "captures the fragility of <b>our</b> <b>hope</b> after a violent or destructive event ... t also reveals its tenacity".|$|E

500|$|The Jesuit critic William F. Lynch, who {{believed}} that salvation happens within time and not outside of it, explained what Eliot was attempting {{to do in the}} Four Quartets when he wrote: [...] "it is hard to say no to the impression, if I may use a mixture of my own symbols and his, that the Christian imagination is finally limited to the element of fire, to the day of Pentecost, to the descent of the Holy Ghost upon the disciples. The revelation of eternity and time is of an intersection ... It seems not unseemly to suppose that Eliot's imagination (and is this not a theology?) is alive with points of intersection and of descent." [...] He continued with a focus on how time operated within the poem: [...] "He seems to place our faith, <b>our</b> <b>hope,</b> and our love, not in the flux of time but in the points of time. I am sure his mind is interested in the line and time of Christ, whose Spirit is his total flux. But I am not so sure about his imagination. Is it or is it not an imagination which is saved from time's nausea or terror by points of intersection? ... There seems little doubt that Eliot is attracted above all by the image and the goal of immobility, and that in everything he seeks for approximations to this goal in the human order." [...] Lynch went on to point out that this understanding of time includes Asian influences.|$|E
500|$|Acquaviva had {{instructed}} that should anything happen to Weston, Garnet was {{to succeed him}} as superior in England, which he did when only days after leaving Harlesford, Weston was captured en route to London. [...] Acquaviva had also given Garnet permission to print pro-Catholic literature, and so early the next year he met Southwell in London to discuss {{the establishment of a}} secret press, which was probably located somewhere around a former Augustinian hospital near Spitalfields. [...] It lasted until late 1588 and was responsible for A Consolatory Letter to All the Afflicted Catholikes in England, author unknown, and An Epistle of Comfort, by Southwell. From a friend's window in Ludgate Hill, Garnet witnessed the November 1588 procession to a thanksgiving service at Old St Paul's Cathedral, celebrating the failed Spanish invasion. [...] Spain's actions gave Garnet much cause for concern, [...] "For when we thought that there was an end to these disasters by which we are already nearly destroyed, <b>our</b> <b>hope</b> was suddenly turned to sorrow, and now with redoubled effort the overseers are pressing upon us". People were allowed to spectate from windows only if their loyalty to Queen Elizabeth I was guaranteed by the householder. [...] In a letter to Acquaviva, Garnet said that many of his supporters thought that he was more concerned for the Queen than her Calvinist ministers. In light of the Armada's destruction, he also wrote to the general to ask for advice on two versions of a proposed oath to allow Roman Catholics to swear their allegiance to the Queen. The government's version required that Catholics reject the pope's authority over Elizabeth, whereas the Catholic version proposed that they recognise her authority and [...] "would wish with every effort to struggle to thwart and to fight to the death all those who will in any way endanger the life of her Highness". The Privy Council rejected the latter.|$|E
500|$|On January 24, 1994, {{prosecutors}} {{announced that}} they would be not bringing charges against Evan Chandler for attempted extortion as Jackson's camp has been slow to report the extortion claim to the police and had tried to negotiate a settlement with Chandler for several weeks. Evan had first made his demand for a financial settlement on August 4, 1993, and the Jackson camp filed extortion charges against Evan and his attorney Barry K. Rothman in late August 1993. After tape recordings supporting the extortion claim were released to the media on August 30, a lawyer for Jackson explained they had not gone to the police earlier because, [...] "It was <b>our</b> <b>hope</b> that this would all go away. We tried to keep it as much in-house as we could." [...] Jackson had already experienced years of bizarre rumors and speculation. In the extortion investigation, a search warrant was never sought to search the homes and offices of Evan Chandler and Barry Rothman and no grand jury was convened when both men declined to be interviewed by police. In contrast, the police searched Jackson's residences solely based on Jordan's allegations reported by a psychiatrist with no particular expertise in child sexual abuse and increased their efforts to investigate Jackson after no supporting evidence was found in their raids and after questioning almost 30 children (Jackson's phonebooks were seized) and their families, all of whom said Jackson had done nothing wrong. Officers flew to the Philippines to interview two ex-housekeepers who had sold a molestation story to the tabloids but decided it lacked credibility. Several parents also complained to one of Jackson's attorneys of aggressive investigative techniques by the police; allegedly frightening their children with lies, e.g. ‘We have nude photos of you', to pressure them into accusing Jackson and unequivocally telling parents their children had been molested even though their children had denied being victimized.|$|E
