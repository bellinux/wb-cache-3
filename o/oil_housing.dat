40|$|This {{report is}} a product of Bachelor Degree Project at Mechanical Engineering {{department}} inLinnaeus University, Växjö, Sweden. The project is about a design improvement of industrialcompact mixers. This project is accomplished with Xylem, one of the main suppliers of compact mixers in theindustry, located at Emmaboda, Sweden. The company has a problem with the existing designof the two part, <b>oil</b> <b>housing</b> and entrance cover, in 4610 / 20 compact mixers. The 4610 / 20 compact mixers has suffered from quality problems which affect the production and the endcustomer because of the existing design of these part. The aim {{of this study is to}} improve thequality of the product by redesigning of <b>oil</b> <b>housing</b> and entrance cover. In addition to theredesigning of these parts, another important purpose of the project is to produce these partsfrom different material than existing one. The computer aided design programs are widely used, Solid Works, during the project. Forselection of a new material a wide literature research has been accomplished...|$|E
40|$|At the École Catholique d’Arts et Métiers (ECAM) in Lyon {{they are}} {{interested}} in oil churning losses. This research is preformed together with PSA (Peugeot and Citroën) and TOTAL FINA ELF. Oil churning losses occur in gearboxes, especially where gears rotate in oil. Hereto a test bench is available in the laboratory of ECAM. However the existing test bench has little resemblance with a real gearbox, the distance between the gears and the walls is to big. This report is about the design of a new test bench, especially about the design of a new <b>oil</b> <b>housing</b> and the implementation of a rotary torque sensor to measure the oil churning losses more accurate...|$|E
50|$|The light station {{includes}} a tower, keeper's <b>house,</b> equipment shed, <b>oil</b> <b>house,</b> and bell house. The keeper's house, now privately owned, is an L-shaped two story gambrel roof oriented {{to face the}} river. The tower is a circular brick structure, topped by an lantern house surrounded by an iron railing. The bell house is distinctive {{as one of the}} few surviving period pyramidal bell <b>houses.</b> The <b>oil</b> <b>house</b> is a small brick gable-roofed structure, typical of <b>oil</b> <b>houses</b> at other light stations.|$|R
50|$|In 1896 {{a wooden}} keeper’s house was built, {{as well as}} a storage shed and <b>oil</b> <b>house.</b> Unfortunately with the {{changing}} times and no need to man the light station it was decided in 1961 to raze the buildings leaving just the tower and <b>oil</b> <b>house.</b>|$|R

50|$|The light station {{consists}} of the lighthouse, a connected keeper's <b>house,</b> an <b>oil</b> <b>house,</b> and a fog signal. These are all set on the exposed southern face of Heron Neck, with a boat landing on the more sheltered northern side of the peninsula. The tower is a circular brick structure, with a polygonal lantern house mounted on top, with an iron parapet and railing surrounding it. A covered passage joins the tower to the keeper's house, a 1-1/2 story L-shaped wood frame building. The <b>oil</b> <b>house</b> is a small stone structure with a gabled roof; it is a departure from most of Maine's <b>oil</b> <b>houses,</b> which are built out of brick. North of this complex stands the fog signal, a mid-20th century square hip-roofed building.|$|R
50|$|The {{light has}} an {{attached}} fog signal building, <b>oil</b> <b>house</b> and storage building. There are davits {{to raise and}} lower boats.|$|R

2500|$|An <b>oil</b> <b>house</b> {{was built}} in 1904, in order to {{properly}} store the flammable materials used to illuminate the light. [...] Aside from the lighthouse and the <b>oil</b> <b>house,</b> no other structure has survived to the present day. [...] The mound of earth that formed {{the foundation of the}} outer battery appears as none other than a sand dune– no other hint of the early settlement, the military post, nor the oil factory can be found on Long Point today.|$|R
50|$|In 1915, the 22 x 40 ft {{fog signal}} {{building}} was constructed. Other outbuildings {{on the grounds}} including an <b>oil</b> <b>house,</b> garage and storage building and outhouse.|$|R

50|$|Built in 1890, Cape Meares Light {{served as}} the light station for Tillamook Bay. When it was built, the {{lighthouse}} complex included two keeper's <b>houses,</b> two <b>oil</b> <b>houses,</b> and two cisterns, and {{was connected to the}} light by a 1000 ft boardwalk. Later additions included an attached workroom in 1895 and a garage in 1934. The light itself was iron-plated, and due to its exposure to the elements, it required frequent repainting over the years. No foghorn was ever installed at Cape Meares. In 1934, the light received electricity. Now unnecessary, the <b>oil</b> <b>houses</b> were removed.|$|R
50|$|Monhegan Island Light {{stands on}} the highest point of the island. The {{lighthouse}} complex includes the tower, keeper's house, storage building, and <b>oil</b> <b>house.</b> The tower is a circular structure built out granite blocks with sloping walls, and is 47 ft tall, with the lantern house mounted on top. A brick entry house, with gabled roof, {{is attached to the}} south side of the tower. The storage building is a single-story wood frame structure, and the <b>oil</b> <b>house</b> is a small brick structure with a gabled roof. The keeper's house, now serving as the Monhegan Museum, is a 1-1/2 story wood frame building.|$|R
