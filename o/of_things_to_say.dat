500|$|Watch the Throne {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 76, based on 42 reviews. Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club wrote that [...] "exhilarating messiness and go-for-broke spontaneity infect Jay-Z and push him outside his comfort zone {{and into a}} realm of intense emotional reflection." [...] Pitchforks Tom Breihan felt that it [...] "works best when Jay and Kanye are just talking about how great they are," [...] adding that [...] "Kanye is this album's obvious guiding force ... He displays levels of unequaled audacity." [...] Claire Suddath of Time called it [...] "a beautifully decadent album by two of hip-hop's finest artistsâ€”men with a lot <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{and a lot of}} money to spend." [...] Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph praised West's [...] "attention to detail" [...] and found their [...] "wit and absurdity [...] entirely suited to the epic scale of productions." [...] Kitty Empire of The Observer stated, [...] "Some find this sort of branded gloating distasteful, but at their best both rappers can still make you laugh." [...] Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times deemed it [...] "a cocksure, fiery, smart, if problematic, collaboration that showcases the pair's distinct lyrical skills." [...] Julian Benbow of The Boston Globe observed [...] "an undeniable synergy that they embraced for this project." [...] AllMusic editor Andy Kellman called it [...] "an audacious spectacle of vacuous pomposity as well as one of tremendous lyrical depth." ...|$|E

'Now that's a nice cheerful sort <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> a fellah,' he ejaculated, fixing his eye-glass in his eye, with a few fierce contortions of his facial muscles.

60|$|But {{the most}} of the talk was with the foot-passengers. The old man sat on a bench in the cool shade, and the child would run about and play until some one came along. Then he would march up to the tree and stand with {{his hands in his pockets}} to hear what was said, very often having a good deal to say himself. Sometimes these people would stay a long time under the shade of the tree, and there were so many {{different}} people, and they had so many different kinds <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> that Harry thought it was like hearing a book read, only a great deal better.|$|E
6000|$|No {{one seemed}} to take the {{slightest}} notice of Adeline's dramatic announcement.

Then every one woke up to this, as it were, and they went off in a volley. [...] "So it's really all settled," [...] said Mrs. Bunting; and Betty Bunting said, [...] "There is to be an election then!" [...] and Nettie said, [...] "What fun!"

60|$|I do {{not know}} how long we were {{together}} in that sitting-room. We had thousands <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> and we said most of them. Among other things, we managed to get in some explanations of the occurrences of the previous night. Kitty told her tale briefly. She and her aunt, to whom she was making a visit, and who wanted her to make her house her home, had had a quarrel two days before. Kitty was wild to go to the Collingwoods', and the old lady, who, for some reason, hated the family, was determined she should not go. But Kitty was immovable, and never gave up until she found that her aunt had {{gone so far as to}} dispose of her horse, thus making it impossible to travel in such weather, there being no public conveyances passing the house. Kitty was an orphan, and had a guardian who would have come to her aid, but she could not write to him in time, and, in utter despair, she went to bed. She would not eat or drink, she would not speak, and she covered up her head.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{can make}} it up. What you call educated men--They're not going on. You can catch them. They are quite satisfied. Playing golf, and {{thinking}} <b>of</b> clever <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> women like my stepmother, and dining out. You're {{in front of them}} already in one thing. They think they know everything. You don't. And they know such little things." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{the grandest}} {{profession}} in the world, Rosamond," [...] said Lydgate, gravely. [...] "And <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{that you love}} me without loving the medical man in me, is the same sort <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> as <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that you like eating a peach but don't like its flavor.

60|$|All {{week she}} thought <b>of</b> <b>things</b> she wished <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> him. High, {{improving}} <b>things.</b> She began <b>to</b> {{admit that she}} was lonely without him. Then she was afraid.|$|R
60|$|Even {{with two}} people {{you see the}} objection, but when three or four are {{gathered}} together the case is infinitely worse to a man of delicate perceptions. Let us suppose--I do not grant it--{{that there is a}} possible sequence <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> to the person A that really harmonise with A and yourself. Grant also that there is a similar sequence between yourself and B. Now, imagine yourself and A and B at the corners of an equilateral triangle set down to talk to each other. The kind of talk that A appreciates is a discord with B, and similarly B's sequence is impossible in the hearing of A. As a matter of fact, a real conversation of three people is the most impossible thing in the world. In real life one of the three always drops out and becomes a mere audience, or a mere partisan. In real life you and A talk, and B pretends to be taking a share by interjecting interruptions, or one of the three talks a monologue. And the more subtle your sympathy and the greater your restraint from self-assertion, the more incredible triple and quadruple conversation becomes.|$|E
6000|$|When {{they arrived}} at Mrs. Allen's door, the astonishment of Isabella was hardly to be expressed, on finding {{that it was too}} late in the day for them to attend her friend into the house: [...] "Past three o'clock!" [...] It was inconceivable, incredible, impossible! And she would neither believe her own watch, nor her brother's, nor the servant's; she would believe no {{assurance}} of it founded on reason or reality, till Morland produced his watch, and ascertained the fact; to have doubted a moment longer then would have been equally inconceivable, incredible, and impossible; and she could only protest, over and over again, that no two hours and a half had ever gone off so swiftly before, as Catherine was called on to confirm; Catherine could not tell a falsehood even to please Isabella; but the latter was spared the misery of her friend's dissenting voice, by not waiting for her answer. Her own feelings entirely engrossed her; her wretchedness was most acute on finding herself obliged to go directly home. It was ages since she had had a moment's conversation with her dearest Catherine; and, though she had such thousands <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> to her, it appeared as if they were never to be together again; so, with smiles of most exquisite misery, and the laughing eye of utter despondency, she bade her friend adieu and went on.|$|E
60|$|On this head, Silas Wegg {{had much}} to say. Silas had to say That, he would beg to remind his comrade, brother, and partner, of the {{impressive}} passages they had read that evening; of the evident parallel in Mr Boffin's mind {{between them and the}} late owner of the Bower, and the present circumstances of the Bower; of the bottle; and of the box. That, the fortunes of his brother and comrade, and of himself were evidently made, inasmuch as they had but to put their price upon this document, and get that price from the minion of fortune and the worm of the hour: who now appeared to be less of a minion and more of a worm than had been previously supposed. That, he considered it plain that such price was stateable in a single expressive word, and that the word was, 'Halves!' That, the question then arose when 'Halves!' should be called. That, here he had a plan of action to recommend, with a conditional clause. That, the plan of action was that they should lie by with patience; that, they should allow the Mounds to be gradually levelled and cleared away, while retaining to themselves their present opportunity of watching the process--which would be, he conceived, to put the trouble and cost of daily digging and delving upon somebody else, while they might nightly turn such complete disturbance of the dust to the account of their own private investigations--and that, when the Mounds were gone, and they had worked those chances for their own joint benefit solely, they should then, and not before, explode on the minion and worm. But here came the conditional clause, and to this he entreated the special attention of his comrade, brother, and partner. It was not to be borne that the minion and worm should carry off any of that property which was now to be regarded as their own property. When he, Mr Wegg, had seen the minion surreptitiously making off with that bottle, and its precious contents unknown, he had looked upon him in the light of a mere robber, and, as such, would have despoiled him of his ill-gotten gain, but for the judicious interference of his comrade, brother, and partner. Therefore, the conditional clause he proposed was, that, if the minion should return in his late sneaking manner, and if, being closely watched, he should be found to possess himself of anything, no matter what, the sharp sword impending over his head should be instantly shown him, he should be strictly examined as to what he knew or suspected, should be severely handled by them his masters, and should be kept in a state of abject moral bondage and slavery until the time when they should see fit to permit him to purchase his freedom at the price of half his possessions. If, said Mr Wegg by way of peroration, he had erred in saying only 'Halves!' he trusted to his comrade, brother, and partner not to hesitate to set him right, and to reprove his weakness. It might be more according to the rights <b>of</b> <b>things,</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> Two-thirds; it might be more according to the rights <b>of</b> <b>things,</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> Three-fourths. On those points he was ever open to correction.|$|E
6000|$|... "There are heaps <b>of</b> <b>things</b> I want <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> you still," [...] she said. [...] "And I'm going to, some time. I {{suppose you}} must go to bed now?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{glad you}} have been outwitted at last," [...] said Jane, {{laughing}} spitefully. [...] "You never had any pity for me when I could not think <b>of</b> the proper <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> at a moment's notice." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes--there's her letter. It's very short. Poor girl, {{she must}} be under a terrible strain. Gilbert Blythe, there are heaps <b>of</b> <b>things</b> I long <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> you, only it would be mean." ...|$|R
6000|$|Yet I should say, {{it was not}} unintelligible how the Arabs might so love it. When {{once you}} get this {{confused}} coil of a Koran fairly off your hands, and have it behind you at a distance, the essential type of it begins to disclose itself; and in this there is a merit quite other than the literary one. If a book come from the heart, it will contrive to reach other hearts; all art and author-craft are of small amount to that. One would say the primary character of the Koran is this of its genuineness, of its being a bona-fide book. Prideaux, I know, and others have represented it as a mere bundle of juggleries; chapter after chapter got up to excuse and varnish the author's successive sins, forward his ambitions and quackeries: but really {{it is time to}} dismiss all that. I do not assert Mahomet's continual sincerity: who is continually sincere? But I confess I can make nothing of the critic, in these times, who would accuse him of deceit prepense; of conscious deceit generally, or perhaps at all;--still more, of living in a mere element of conscious deceit, and writing this Koran as a forger and juggler would have done! Every candid eye, I think, will read the Koran far otherwise than so. It is the confused ferment of a great rude human soul; rude, untutored, that cannot even read; but fervent, earnest, struggling vehemently to utter itself in words. With a kind of breathless intensity he strives to utter himself; the thoughts crowd on him pell-mell: for very multitude <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> he can get nothing said. The meaning that is in him shapes itself into no form of composition, is stated in no sequence, method, or coherence;--they are not shaped at all, these thoughts of his; flung out unshaped, as they struggle and tumble there, in their chaotic inarticulate state. We said [...] "stupid:" [...] yet natural stupidity {{is by no means the}} character of Mahomet's Book; it is natural uncultivation rather. The man has not studied speaking; in the haste and pressure of continual fighting, has not time to mature himself into fit speech. The panting breathless haste and vehemence of a man struggling in the thick of battle for life and salvation; this is the mood he is in! A headlong haste; for very magnitude of meaning, he cannot get himself articulated into words. The successive utterances of a soul in that mood, colored by the various vicissitudes of three-and-twenty years; now well uttered, now worse: this is the Koran.|$|E
60|$|Clearly {{this general}} mystery or mixture {{was to be}} laid open under stress of fortune as never yet--the unprecedentedness was above all what came over us again and again, armaments unknown to human {{experience}} looming all the while larger and larger; but whatever face or succession of faces {{the genius of the}} race should most turn up the main mark of them all would be in the difference that, taken together, couldn't fail to keep them more unlike the peoples off there beyond than any pair even of the most approved of these peoples are unlike each other. 'Insularity!'--one had spent no small part of one's past time in mocking or in otherwise fingering the sense out of that word; yet here it was in the air wherever one looked and as stuffed with meaning as if nothing had ever worn away from it, as if its full force on the contrary amounted to inward congestion. What the term essentially signified was in the oddest way a question at once enormous and irrelevant; what it might show as signifying, what it was in the circumstances actively and most probably going to, seemed rather the true consideration, indicated with all the weight of the evidence scattered about. Just the fixed look of England under the August sky, what was this but the most vivid exhibition of character conceivable and the face turned up, to repeat my expression, with a frankness that really left no further inquiry to be made? That appearance was of the exempt state, the record of the long safe centuries, in its happiest form, and even if any shade of happiness at such an hour might well seem a sign of profanity or perversity. To that there were all sorts <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> I could at once reflect, however; wouldn't it be the thing supremely in character that England should look most complacently herself, irradiating all her reasons for it, at the very crisis of the question of the true toughness, in other words the further duration, of her identity? I might observe, as for that matter I repeatedly and unspeakably did while the two months lasted, that she was pouring forth this identity, as atmosphere and aspect and picture, in the very measure and to the very top of her consciousness of how it hung in the balance. Thus one arrived, through the succession of shining days, at the finest sense of the case--the interesting truth that her consciously not being as her tragic sisters were in the great particular was virtually just her genius, and that the very straightest thing she could do would naturally be not to flinch at the dark hour from any profession of her genius. Looking myself more askance at the dark hour (politically speaking I mean) than I after my fashion figured her as doing in her mass, I found it of an extreme, of quite an endless fascination to trace as many as possible of her felt idiosyncrasies back to her settled sea-confidence, and to see this now in turn account for so many other things, the smallest as well as the biggest, that, to give the fewest hints of illustration, the mere spread of the great trees, the mere gathers in the little bluey-white curtains of the cottage windows, the mere curl of the tinted smoke from the old chimneys matching that note, became a sort of exquisite evidence.|$|E
