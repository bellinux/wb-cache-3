25|$|Craniofacial {{surgery is}} divided into {{pediatric}} and adult craniofacial surgery. Pediatric craniofacial surgery mostly revolves around the treatment of congenital anomalies of the craniofacial skeleton and soft tissues, such as cleft lip and palate, craniosynostosis, and pediatric fractures. Adult craniofacial surgery deals mostly with fractures and secondary surgeries (such as orbital reconstruction) along with <b>orthognathic</b> <b>surgery.</b> Craniofacial surgery {{is an important part}} of all plastic surgery training programs, further training and subspecialisation is obtained via a craniofacial fellowship. Craniofacial surgery is also practiced by Maxillo-Facial surgeons.|$|E

2500|$|As an {{alternative}} to simply reactively repairing the damage to teeth and conforming to the existing occlusal scheme, occasionally some dentists will attempt to reorganize the occlusion {{in the belief that}} this may redistribute the forces and reduce the amount of damage inflicted on the dentition.

30|$|Recently, {{there have}} been several reports of cutting guides used in {{genioplasty}} of the mandible [4, 6, 7]. These guides confer several advantages. First, the form and position of the osteotomy line can be adjusted in simulated surgery, which allows the osteotomy line to be preoperatively planned, minimizing the possibility of dental or neural damage. Moreover, using a cutting guide allows the surgeon to adjust the depth when cutting, leading to a non-invasive and stable osteotomy. Cutting guides also make <b>orthognathic</b> <b>surgeries</b> easier by allowing the bone segments to be moved to the planned positions, according to the design of the guide. In a recent multicenter study, the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) was used to measure the results of <b>orthognathic</b> <b>surgeries</b> using computer-aided surgical simulations (CASS) [9]. Significantly fewer errors were found for genioplasty when surgical guides were used, which led to more favorable surgical outcomes; the largest positional RMSD was 1.0  mm, and the largest orientation RMSD was 2.2 °. When a surgical guide was not used, the outcomes varied [9].|$|R

50|$|<b>Orthognathic</b> <b>surgery</b> {{is a well}} {{established}} and widely used treatment option for insufficient growth of the maxilla in patients with an orofacial cleft. There is some debate regarding the timing of orthognathic procedures, to maximise the potential for natural growth of the facial skeleton. Patient reported aesthetic outcomes of <b>orthognathic</b> <b>surgery</b> for cleft lip and palate appear to be of overall satisfaction, despite complications that may arise. A potentially significant long-term outcome of <b>orthognathic</b> <b>surgery</b> is impaired maxillary growth, due to scar tissue formation. The Cochrane collaboration released a systematic review comparing traditional <b>orthognathic</b> <b>surgery</b> with maxillary distraction osteogenesis.

Among these devices, those used in genioplasty required more accurate mandibular dental data, and were more complex to design, compared to the method that we now describe [4, 8]. The usefulness of STL guides may also depend on the surgeons’ expertise, and the type of genioplasty, such as zigzag genioplasty [10 – 12].|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Errors in <b>orthognathic</b> model <b>surgery</b> {{occur during}} the planning, {{measuring}} and/or moving of the models.

In this study, we introduce a new <b>orthognathic</b> model <b>surgery</b> technique (Yonsei method) which adopts the tooth point as the reference and the occlusal index as a moving vehicle for the model. Methods: The technique consists mainly of: 1) measuring the three-dimensional lengths of model points, 2) fabricating and moving the occlusal index and 3) verifying the movement. Then we compared the accuracy of the Yonsei method to conventional methods, with special reference made to influencing factors. Results: Errors for the Yonsei method with the occlusal index were reduced to the range of 0. 61 ∼ 1. 04 mm in three-dimension, providing a more accurate model surgery technique than conventional methods which have errors ranging from 0. 77 ∼ 3. 1...|$|R

Materials and Methods: The study undertaken was a retrospective cephalometric study. Subjects included in our study had undergone mandibular set-back surgery or DO of maxilla/mandible. Lateral cephalograms of the subjects taken pre-operatively (T 0), immediate post-operatively (T 1) and after a minimum follow-up period of 6 months (T 2) were studied. The cephalograms were traced manually and the following parameters were evaluated: Surface area of the PAS, pharyngeal airway width {{at the level of the}} base of the tongue, position of the hyoid bone and the tongue. Repeated measure ANOVA test was done to assess the presence of any significant changes in the proposed parameters at T 0, T 1 and T 2. A correlation analysis was made between the mandibular/maxillary movements and the corresponding changes in the PAS.

40|$|Introduction: Velopharyngeal {{inadequacy}} (VPI) {{may result}} in inappropriate oral/nasal coupling during the production of speech sounds, resulting in unwanted nasal resonance and/or nasal air emission. <b>Orthognathic</b> <b>surgeries</b> such as maxillary and/or mandibular advancements are also known to change skeletal and muscular structures resulting in changes affecting velopharyngeal closure (VPC). Although many studies have reported {{on the effect of}} maxillary advancement surgery on VPI for patients with cleft lip and palate, the effect of mandibular advancement on VPI has not been studied at length. The {{purpose of this study was}} to elucidate the effect of temporary prosthetic mandibular advancement on velopharyngeal function. Methods: Fourteen subjects (7 males, 7 females) with no history of craniofacial abnormalities or speech disorders were recruited. The mean age was 35 years (range = 26 - 60). Acoustic nasalance measurements were obtained during nasal sentences and during sentences without nasal consonants in two conditions; normally, and while wearing an elastic mandibular advancement (EMA) appliance to advance the mandible by 13 mm. In addition, subjects were asked to produce five repetitions of the sentence 2 ̆ 2 Ten men came in when Jane left 2 ̆ 2 while recordings were obtained with a videoendoscopy/phototransducer system that sensed the amount of light passing through the velopharyngeal orifice. The endoscope and fiber optic light were inserted through the subject 2 ̆ 7 s middle nasal meatus and positioned above the velum. The phototransducer fiber was extended through the velopharyngeal port into the upper oropharynx to detect light passing through the orifice as the velopharyngeal mechanism opened and closed. Individual subject 2 ̆ 7 s outcomes with and without the EMA appliance were analyzed statistically using paired t-test for Nasalance test, and one-way ANOVA/independent samples t-test for phototransducer test. Results: Nasalance did not deteriorate, but significantly decreased for the ‘nasal’ sentences after mandibular advancement, whereas changes in nasalance were not significant for the sentences containing no nasal consonants after mandibular advancement. Mandibular advancement by a 13 mm using an EMA appliance did not significantly affect VPC. Instead, large variability among subjects in response to mandibular advancement. For 7 of the 14 subjects, the extent of VPC decreased significantly (p 3 ̆c. 05) under the advanced mandible condition compared to the normal condition (without the EMA appliance). On the other hand, 5 subjects showed significantly (p 3 ̆c. 05) increased VPC when their mandibles were advanced. For 2 subjects, VPC was not significantly changed with the advanced mandible. Conclusions: The outcomes of this study suggested that there was no statistical evidence to support that nasality was deteriorated by a 13 mm mandibular advancement, which agreed with recent studies describing velopharyngeal function and nasality after <b>orthognathic</b> <b>surgeries.</b> VPC was not affected by mandibular advancement. Responses of the nasalance and VPC to mandibular advancement were dependent on the individuals. Further investigation such as electromyography method is needed to understand how velopharyngeal function and speech respond to mandibular advancement more definitely...|$|R
40|$|Context: Facial {{measurements}} {{serve as}} a valuable tool in the treatment planning of maxillofacial rehabilitation, orthodontic treatment, and <b>orthognathic</b> <b>surgeries.</b> The esthetic guidelines of face are still based on neoclassical canons, which {{were used in the}} ancient art. These canons are considered to be highly subjective, and there is ample evidence in the literature, which raises such questions as whether or not these canons can be applied for the modern population. Aims: This study was carried out to analyze the facial features of Indian and Malaysian women by using three-dimensional (3 D) scanner and thus determine the prevalence of neoclassical facial esthetic canons in both the groups. Subjects and Methods: The study was carried out on 60 women in the age range of 18 - 25 years, out of whom 30 were Indian and 30 Malaysian. As many as 16 facial measurements were taken by using a noncontact 3 D scanner. Statistical Analysis Used: Unpaired t-test was used for comparison of facial measurements between Indian and Malaysian females. Two-tailed Fisher exact test was used to determine the prevalence of neoclassical canons. Results: Orbital Canon was prevalent in 80 % of Malaysian women; the same was found only in 16 % of Indian women (P = 0. 00013). About 43 % of Malaysian women exhibited orbitonasal canon (P = 0. 0470) whereas nasoaural canon was prevalent in 73 % of Malaysian and 33 % of Indian women (P = 0. 0068). Conclusions: Orbital, orbitonasal, and nasoaural canon were more prevalent in Malaysian women. Facial profile canon, nasooral, and nasofacial canons were not seen in either group. Though some canons provide guidelines in esthetic analyses of face, complete reliance on these canons is not justifiable...|$|R
