40|$|Residues 2, 6, 8 and 10 of Mnt {{repressor}} are {{the major}} determinants of operator DNA binding and recognition. Here, we investigate the interaction of wild-type Mnt and mutants bearing the Arg 2 [...] Lys, His 6 [...] Ala, Asn 8 [...] Ala and Arg 10 [...] Lys mutations with operator DNA modified by methylation or by symmetric base substitutions. The wild-type pattern of methylation interference is altered in specific ways {{for each of the}} mutant proteins. In addition, some of the mutant proteins show a 'loss of contact' phenotype with specific mutant operators. Taken together, these and previous results predict the following contacts between side chains in the Mnt tetramer and operator DNA: Arg 2 recognizes the guanines at <b>operator</b> <b>positions</b> 10 and 12; His 6 contacts the guanines at <b>operator</b> <b>positions</b> 5 and 17; Asn 8 contacts <b>operator</b> <b>positions</b> 4, 7, 15 and 18; Arg 10 contacts the guanines at <b>operator</b> <b>positions</b> 8 and 14.

40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the question of}} wh- questions French and the link betweensyntax and pragmatics in this language. French, contrary to all Germanic and most Romance languages, does not use pitch accent to indicate focus domains, but rather a combination of prosodic phrasing and syntactic reformulation. Following a brief discussion of the historical reasons for this situation, the paper examines data from five corpora of oral and written contemporary French and draws {{up a list of}} functional properties {{for each of the four}} basic wh-question forms. A formal analysis is provided, based on the relationship between ground and focus in wh-questions, and the theory of wh-doubling developed for Northern Italian dialects by Poletto & Pollock (2004, 2006). In this analysis two distinct <b>operator</b> <b>positions</b> are available in French, as in other Romance languages: a higher, disjunction <b>operator</b> <b>position,</b> and a lower, restriction <b>operator</b> <b>position.</b> French exploits both positions, alternating between syntactic forms depending on how the question fits into the thematic development of the context...|$|R

50|$|In {{terms of}} <b>{{operator}}</b> <b>position,</b> an <b>operator</b> may be prefix, postfix, or infix. A prefix operator immediately precedes its operand, as in −x. A postfix operator immediately succeeds its operand, as in x! for instance. An infix <b>operator</b> is <b>positioned</b> in between a left and a right operand, as in x+y.

50|$|There {{are just}} over 2,000 CAD <b>Operator</b> <b>positions</b> within the MPS, and {{approximately}} 400-500 theoretically on duty {{at any given}} time.

While the Metropolitan Police Authority intended to eventually have all CAD <b>Operator</b> <b>positions</b> filled by civilians, allowing police officers to return to active duties, this civilianisation was stopped in 2010 as it was recognised by the MPS that total civilianisation would create a significant risk to London if the CCC staff went on strike and police officers (who cannot strike by law) were not trained and familiar with CCC processes.|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Since 1976 the author has worked with L. M. Ericsson Ab of Stockholm, Sweden, providing ergonomics advice relating {{to the design of}} <b>operator</b> <b>positions</b> for stored program controlled telephone exchanges manufactured by this company. The research was I performed in three phases: a literature review, preliminary experiments to evaluate alternative equipment designs and finally a series of trials of the prototype under simulated call conditions. The basis of the new <b>operator</b> <b>position</b> is tie provision of a computer terminal, consisting of a datascreen or video display unit (vdu) and keyboard at each operator desk. These terminals enable the operator to enter call details into memory stores from which they can be 'read' by the computer, displayed at any <b>operator</b> <b>position</b> or routed to the charging system. By eliminating many repetitious and error prone number entries, by abolishing pager handling tasks completely and by automating certain call handling operations a more efficient and effective service can be provided to subscribers. The literature review report, produced on completion of Phase I, summarised the ergonomics research relating to datascreens, keyboards, dialogues, workstations and environmental factors. As a result of the review the author was able to produce detailed ergonomics recommendations for many parts of the system. Phase II consisted of a programme of experiments to provide the data required to resolve design conflicts remaining at the conclusion of Phase I. In successive stages a panel of experts reduced the potential number of datascreen designs to practicable numbers for controlled experiments. These datascreens, filters and screen treatments were systematically compared in experiments and a suitable design was selected. In Phase III an experiment was conducted to evaluate the entire <b>operator</b> <b>position</b> under simulated call handling conditions. In addition to collecting objective measures of call handling speed and accuracy, the experiments also enabled visual fatigue to be assessed and call handling equipment and procedures to be judged by experienced operators under' reasonably realistic conditions...|$|R
