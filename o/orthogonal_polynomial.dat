It has been shown that it is usually advantageous to choose the collocation points as the zeros of the corresponding Jacobi polynomial (independent of the PDE system).|$|E
40|$|<b>Orthogonal</b> <b>polynomials</b> on {{the real}} line always satisfy a three-term {{recurrence}} relation. The recurrence coefficients determine a tridiagonal semi-infinite matrix (Jacobi matrix) which uniquely characterizes the <b>orthogonal</b> <b>polynomials.</b> We investigate new <b>orthogonal</b> <b>polynomials</b> by adding to the Jacobi matrix $r$ new rows and columns, so that the original Jacobi matrix is shifted downward. The $r$ new rows and columns contain $ 2 r$ new parameters and the newly obtained <b>orthogonal</b> <b>polynomials</b> thus correspond to an upward extension of the Jacobi matrix. We give an explicit expression of the new <b>orthogonal</b> <b>polynomials</b> {{in terms of the}} original <b>orthogonal</b> <b>polynomials,</b> their associated polynomials and the $ 2 r$ new parameters, and we give a fourth order differential equation for these new polynomials when the original <b>orthogonal</b> <b>polynomials</b> are classical.

50|$|Recently chaos {{expansion}} {{received a}} generalization towards the arbitrary polynomial chaos expansion (aPC), {{which is a}} so-called data-driven generalization of the PC. Like all polynomial chaos expansion techniques, aPC approximates the dependence of simulation model output on model parameters by expansion in an <b>orthogonal</b> <b>polynomial</b> basis. The aPC generalizes chaos expansion techniques towards arbitrary distributions with arbitrary probability measures, which can be either discrete, continuous, or discretized continuous and can be specified either analytically (as probability density/cumulative distribution functions), numerically as histogram or as raw data sets. The aPC at finite expansion order only demands {{the existence of a}} finite number of moments and does not require the complete knowledge or even existence of a probability density function. This avoids the necessity to assign parametric probability distributions that are not sufficiently supported by limited available data. Alternatively, it allows modellers to choose freely of technical constraints the shapes of their statistical assumptions. Investigations indicate that the aPC shows an exponential convergence rate and converges faster than classical polynomial chaos expansion techniques. Yet these techniques are in progress but the impact of them on CFD models is quite impressionable.|$|E

50|$|There are a {{very large}} number of ideas that fall under the general banner of pseudospectral optimal control. Examples of these are the Legendre pseudospectral method, the Chebyshev pseudospectral method, the Gauss pseudospectral method, the Ross-Fahroo pseudospectral method, the Bellman pseudospectral method, the flat pseudospectral method and many others. Solving an optimal control problem {{requires}} the approximation of three types of mathematical objects: the integration in the cost function, the differential equation of the control system, and the state-control constraints. An ideal approximation method should be efficient for all three approximation tasks. A method that is efficient for one of them, for instance an efficient ODE solver, may not be an efficient method for the other two objects. These requirements make PS methods ideal because they are efficient for the approximation of all three mathematical objects. In a pseudospectral method, the continuous functions are approximated at a set of carefully selected quadrature nodes. The quadrature nodes are determined by the corresponding <b>orthogonal</b> <b>polynomial</b> basis used for the approximation. In PS optimal control, Legendre and Chebyshev polynomials are commonly used. Mathematically, quadrature nodes are able to achieve high accuracy with a small number of points. For instance, the interpolating polynomial of any smooth function (C) at Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto nodes converges in L2 sense at the so-called spectral rate, faster than any polynomial rate.|$|E
