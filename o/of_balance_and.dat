5|$|The {{smallest}} region, the flocculonodular lobe, {{is often}} called the vestibulocerebellum. It is the oldest part in evolutionary terms (archicerebellum) and participates mainly in balance and spatial orientation; its primary connections are with the vestibular nuclei, although it also receives visual and other sensory input. Damage to this region causes disturbances <b>of</b> <b>balance</b> <b>and</b> gait.|$|E
5|$|The Renaissance in Scotland was a cultural, {{intellectual}} and artistic movement in Scotland, {{from the late}} fifteenth century {{to the beginning of}} the seventeenth century. It is associated with the pan-European Renaissance that is usually regarded as beginning in Italy in the late fourteenth century and reaching northern Europe as a Northern Renaissance in the fifteenth century. It involved an attempt to revive the principles of the classical era, including humanism, a spirit of scholarly enquiry, scepticism, and concepts <b>of</b> <b>balance</b> <b>and</b> proportion. Since the twentieth century the uniqueness and unity of the Renaissance has been challenged by historians, but significant changes in Scotland can be seen to have taken place in education, intellectual life, literature, art, architecture, music and politics.|$|E
5|$|The {{auditory}} nerve was also large, suggesting good hearing, {{which may have}} been useful for auditory communication and spatial awareness. The nerve had a well-developed vestibular component as well, which implies a good sense <b>of</b> <b>balance</b> <b>and</b> coordination. In contrast, the nerves and brain structures associated with eyesight were smaller and undeveloped. The midbrain tectum, responsible for visual processing in reptiles, was very small in Tarbosaurus, as were the optic nerve and the oculomotor nerve, which controls eye movement. Unlike Tyrannosaurus, which had forward-facing eyes that provided some degree of binocular vision, Tarbosaurus had a narrower skull more typical of other tyrannosaurids in which the eyes faced primarily sideways. All of this suggests that Tarbosaurus relied more on its senses of smell and hearing than on its eyesight.|$|E

40|$|The {{topic of}} present thesis {{is focused on}} a processing <b>of</b> a statement <b>of</b> <b>balances</b> <b>of</b> {{business}} corporations according to the valid regulations of the Czech Republic <b>and</b> a statement <b>of</b> <b>balances</b> compiled in a case of a liquidation of business corporations or in case of insolvency proceedings. In {{the first part of}} the thesis a legislation framework of the statement <b>of</b> <b>balances</b> <b>and</b> a financial statement preparing are defined. The following part of the thesis deals with a financial statement preparing which includes a preparation leading to finding and booking of profit and income tax. The next part contains a process of the statement <b>of</b> <b>balances,</b> a completion <b>of</b> the accounting statements, attachments and overviews, which are indispensable parts of the statement <b>of</b> <b>balances.</b> The processing <b>of</b> the statement <b>of</b> <b>balances</b> <b>and</b> financial statement preparing in business corporations under liquidation and insolvency differ very much from the processing of the statement <b>of</b> <b>balances</b> <b>and</b> <b>balancing</b> work <b>of</b> the business companies continuing in their entrepreneurial activity. This topic is present in the thesis as well. Moreover, a fictional business corporation being under liquidation will be created <b>and</b> a statement <b>of</b> <b>balances</b> <b>and</b> preparations preceding the statement <b>of</b> <b>balance</b> will be described. Finally, differences in processing <b>of</b> statement <b>of</b> <b>balances</b> <b>of</b> a corporation under liquidation will be shown in practice...|$|R
40|$|A {{different}} approach to the theory <b>of</b> <b>balancing</b> numbers is possible {{by means of a}} Pell’s equation which can be derived from the definition <b>of</b> <b>balancing</b> numbers. Each balancing number corresponds to a balancer, and each balancer, in turn, is a cobalancing number. Similarly, each cobalancing number corresponds to a cobalancer and interestingly, each cobalancer is a balancing number. The cobalancing numbers as well as their cobalancers are also solutions of a Diophantine equation similar to that satisfied by <b>balancing</b> numbers <b>and</b> their balancers. Some Diophantine equations exhibit beautiful solutions in terms <b>of</b> <b>balancing</b> <b>and</b> cobalancing numbers. The Lucas-balancing and Lucas-cobalancing numbers, obtained respectively as functions <b>of</b> <b>balancing</b> <b>and</b> cobalancing numbers, are useful in the computation <b>of</b> <b>balancing</b> <b>and</b> cobalancing numbers <b>of</b> higher order. Pell and associated Pell numbers are very closely associated with <b>balancing</b> <b>and</b> cobalancing numbers and appear in the factorization and as greatest common divisors of these numbers. The <b>balancing,</b> cobalancing <b>and</b> other related numbers are also expressible in terms of products of matrices...|$|R
5|$|On January 13, 2014, wife of Max Bemis, Sherri DuPree-Bemis {{published}} an instagram photo {{stating that the}} new Say Anything album is almost mixed. The band's record, Hebrews, was released June 10, 2014 on Equal Vision Records. The album was the first album that was self-produced by front-man Max Bemis. Bemis worked {{in the studio with}} audio engineer Garron DuPree for many months while recording the album at Bemis and Dupree's own studio in Tyler, TX. The album was mixed by mix engineer Brad Wood, and mastered by Emily Lazar. It returned to the collaborative nature of the band's earlier material, with guest vocals including Jon Simmons <b>of</b> <b>Balance</b> <b>and</b> Composure, Tom Delonge of Blink 182 and Angels and Airwaves, Andy Hull of Manchester Orchestra and Jeremy Bolm of Touche Amore. The album was met with positive reception by fans and critics upon its release, and the group embarked on a successful headlining tour in support of the album in the summer of 2014.|$|E
5|$|The Prince of Lobkowitz, who in 1854 {{became the}} head of Mezőhegyes, {{stressed}} the importance of fixing the type– that is, making the characteristics of a breed of animal genetically homogenous– of the horses. This goal was achieved by linebreeding, though the one season that Nonius Senior served his own daughters was notably unsuccessful: of the 33 foals, 11 died while only 2 were broodmare-quality and 1 was stallion-quality. However, with more experimentation, the Nonius breed emerged as a uniformly heavy but elegant military driving and carting horse. In 1865, Arabian and Thoroughbred stallions were bred to Nonius Senior's female descendants in the hopes of correcting a lack <b>of</b> <b>balance</b> <b>and</b> elegance among the Nonius horses. Nonius Senior stood at stud for 22 years. By the end of his breeding life, he had served mares of Arabian, Lipizzan, Thoroughbred, Spanish and Norman blood. Fifteen of Nonius's sons in turn stood at stud, and 122 of his daughters were used as broodmares.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The concept <b>of</b> <b>balancing</b> <b>and</b> cobalancing {{numbers is}} {{generalized}} to an arbitrary sequence; thereby sequence <b>balancing</b> numbers <b>and</b> sequence cobalancing numbers are introduced and defined. It is proved that {{there does not}} exist any sequence balancing number in the Fibonacci sequence and the only sequence cobalancing number in the Fibonacci sequence is F 2 = 1. Higher order <b>balancing</b> <b>and</b> cobalancing numbers are also introduced. A result on nonexistence <b>of</b> third order <b>balancing</b> <b>and</b> cobalancing numbers is also proved. A conjecture on the nonexistence of solutions <b>of</b> higher order <b>balancing</b> <b>and</b> cobalancing numbers is also stated at the end...|$|R

In Season 5, the game was a test <b>of</b> <b>balance</b> <b>and</b> speed, and the last two boys and last two girls to finish the game were eliminated. In Season 6, the first two boys and two girls to let go of a rope were eliminated, winnowing the sixteen hopefuls to twelve contestants who earned the right to stay, forming six teams of players.|$|E
25|$|Each Companion cavalryman was {{equipped}} with a 3-metre double-ended spear/lance with a cornel wood shaft called the xyston. The double spear points meant that, should the xyston break during a battle, the rider need only turn his weapon around to re-arm himself. The Thessalian and Greek cavalry would have been armed similarly to the Companions. The xyston was used to thrust either overarm or underarm with the elbow flexed. This is usefully illustrated in the Alexander Mosaic, King Alexander is shown thrusting with his xyston underarm, whilst immediately behind him a cavalryman is employing the overarm thrust. There {{is no evidence that}} the Macedonian cavalry ever used a two-handed grip on their lances, as did later Sarmatian and Roman lancers. The shaft of the xyston was tapered allowing the point <b>of</b> <b>balance,</b> <b>and</b> therefore the hand grip, to be approximately two thirds of the length of the spear away from the point. During the reign of Alexander the Great most cavalrymen did not carry shields. However, the Companion cavalry of the Antigonid dynasty did carry large, round bossed shields of Thracian origin.|$|E
