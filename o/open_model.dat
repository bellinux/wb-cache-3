50|$|Based on Peter Kropotkin's {{theories}} on mutual aid, those small groups are also discussed as a counter {{model to the}} historic concept of an autonomous individual. Those discussions emphasize an <b>open</b> <b>model</b> of voluntary cooperation in mutual-aid groups as opposed to induced cooperation. Therefore, they raise questions regarding the tension of the individual's adaption and self-determination. In order to overcome this tension an insight in the life perspective of others, a radical openness to all situations possible and a high awareness of and confidence in the self is necessary.|$|E

Between singularities, time flows in one direction, away from the singularity (arrow of time). In the <b>open</b> <b>model,</b> there is one time singularity so time is limited at one end but unlimited at the other, while in the closed model there are two singularities that limit time at both ends (the Big Bang and Big Crunch).|$|E

In general, system designers pay little attention to whether a workload generator is closed or open. Using a combination of implementation and simulation experiments, we illustrate {{that there is a}} vast difference in behavior between <b>open</b> and closed <b>models</b> in realworld settings. We synthesize these differences into eight simple guiding principles, which serve three purposes. First, the principles specify how scheduling policies are impacted by closed and <b>open</b> <b>models,</b> and explain the differences in user level performance. Second, the principles motivate the use of partly <b>open</b> system <b>models,</b> whose behavior we show to lie between that of closed and <b>open</b> <b>models.</b> Finally, the principles provide guidelines to system designers for determining which system model is most appropriate for a given workload. ...|$|R
