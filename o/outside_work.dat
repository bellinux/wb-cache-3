25|$|In {{contemporary}} British and American publishing markets, most authors receive {{only a small}} monetary advance before {{publication of}} their debut novel; in the rare exceptions when a large print run and high volume of sales are anticipated, the advance can be larger. However, once an author has established themselves in print, some authors can make steady income {{as long as they}} remain productive as writers. Additionally, many novelists, even published ones, will take on <b>outside</b> <b>work,</b> such as teaching creative writing in academic institutions, or leave novel writing as a secondary hobby.|$|E
25|$|Although he {{remained}} the Head Gardener at Chatsworth until 1858, {{he was also}} able to undertake <b>outside</b> <b>work</b> such as the Crystal Palace and his directorship of the Midland Railway. He worked on public parks in Liverpool, Birkenhead, Glasgow, Halifax (the People's Park) and {{the grounds of the}} Spa Buildings at Scarborough. In October 1845 he was invited to lay out one of the country's first municipal burial grounds in Coventry. This became the London Road Cemetery, where a memorial to Paxton by Joseph Goddard was erected in 1868.|$|E
25|$|Restoration of {{the mill}} began in earnest in May 2007 with Tracy Wells as foreman of the project for Pritchett Brothers.

The old turbines were cleaned, and the stone foundation was repaired by lifting the mill from its moorings. In September 2007 the <b>outside</b> <b>work</b> was stopped for the year. The mill workings, currently held in storage at Salem, were re-installed in the spring 2008.

25|$|Kelly and Hauck's {{research}} found that divisions of labor within a same-sex relationship {{can not be}} viewed as setting a precedent as to what gender roles are normal. A female partner in a same-sex relationship may perform chores that are considered feminine, like cooking, cleaning, and child rearing. However, the other female partner may perform chores that are considered masculine, like <b>outside</b> <b>work</b> and employment outside of the home. The partners’ behaviors do not support gender roles because all the roles performed are done by women. There is not an inherent distinction made between masculine and feminine because women are performing both types of chores. This lack of gender role discrimination would be true in same-sex relationships between two men as well.|$|E
25|$|For {{several years}} after her marriage, she did all of the work by herself. The {{shoulder}} on which she carried pitchers {{of water from the}} well was swollen and the hand with which she worked the handmill to grind corn were often covered with blisters. Fatimah vouched {{to take care of the}} household work, make dough, bake bread, and clean the house; in return, Ali vouched to take care of the <b>outside</b> <b>work</b> such as gathering firewood and bringing food. Ali worked to irrigate other people's lands by drawing water from the wells. Their circumstances were akin to many of the Muslims at the time and only improved following the Battle of Khaybar when the produce of Khaybar was distributed among the poor. When the economic situations of the Muslims become better, Fatimah gained some maids but treated them like her family and performed the house duties with them.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, all {{academic}} staff were poorly paid {{and there were}} no incentives for good work or penalties for poor practice. At AAU, {{academic staff}} could increase their income with additional work outside the university. This was not stopped because it would result in loss of experienced teachers. There was resentment that Indian professors were paid {{more than twice as much}} as Ethiopian professors. MU had the potential for improvement but, given low pay and possible opportunities for work in new private colleges, they could soon resemble AAU. JU, being in a remote area, had no opportunities for <b>outside</b> <b>work,</b> so staff were fully engaged with their work but they would leave if given the opportunity. Staff thought teaching was not up-to-date or based on practice because research was not being done. Staff were relying on foreign teaching materials and textbooks which might not relate to the Ethiopian situation. Class sizes and resource shortages meant that laboratory work, practical work, field work, essays and projects were gradually being phased out. Courses were reduced to theory without practice thus encouraging rote learning to pass exams.|$|E

500|$|<b>Outside</b> <b>work,</b> {{mostly on}} public infrastructure, {{continued}} beyond the convict era, but gradually declined due to discipline concerns, {{the rise of}} trade unions that saw such work as [...] "a threat to free labour", and an increasing emphasis on work as rehabilitation rather than punishment. By 1911 <b>outside</b> <b>work</b> had all but ceased, but could not adequately be replaced by employment within the prison walls; a lack of suitable work plagued the prison throughout its lifetime. Work in the 19th century consisted of cooking, washing clothes, cleaning the prison, tailoring, bootmaking, and printing. However, demand exceeded the availability of such work – increasingly so in the later years of the 19th century – so prisoners were also given activities with no practical value other than keeping them occupied. These included breaking stones, operating a water pump, and oakum picking. Even with these extra activities, by 1899, 60 to 70 men were employed at the pump, each doing {{only a few minutes}} work per hour, and occupied {{the rest of the time}} with recreation such as draughts.|$|E
