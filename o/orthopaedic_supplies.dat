Taking as reference the SMART network model [12] and comparing the literature and the “as-is” fashion and <b>orthopaedic</b> footwear <b>supply</b> networks through multiple case studies, this paper aims at highlighting the guidelines for designing an innovative reference model for footwear supply networks.

40|$|The {{quality of}} {{training}} conditions affects sporting success, injuries and health. The {{aim of the}} work was to present the conditions during the preparations of Polish athletes for the Summer Paralympic Games 2004 - 2012. The study encompassed 271 paralympians: Athens (91), Beijing (89) and London (91), competing in 13 disciplines. The research {{was based on a}} two-part questionnaire by Kłodecka-Różalska adjusted for disabled sports, and was conducted one month before each PG. Part 1 contained 20 closed-ended questions regarding conditions during preparations, while Part 2 concerned socio-demographic and sports-related data. Three levels of conditions: good, satisfactory and poor, were identified. The analysis showed that while the relationships between the athletes were good in all the preparatory periods, the co-operation with the paralympic coaches worsened. The standards of accommodation, food and sports facilities lowered. Personal <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>supply</b> was satisfactory in London; personal sporting equipment was good at all PG. The quality of medical care was the highest in London. The co-operation with physicians, physiotherapists and massage therapists was satisfactory. Consultations with the dietician were sporadic and assessed as poor. Psychological consultations were rare but satisfactory in Beijing and London. Contacts with the mass media were poor at all PG. Although combining private life, work, and education with sport was satisfactory, it was increasingly difficult to manage, particularly before London. The conditions during preparations for the PG 2004 - 2012 varied. Improvement was noticed only in the quality of medical care and personal <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>supply...</b>|$|R

This paper focuses on footwear companies and compares the fashion and the <b>orthopaedic</b> footwear <b>supply</b> chains, through multiple case studies conducted to understand how the production for the target groups mentioned before could be industrialized through an integration of these two supply chains.

40|$|Despite {{the growing}} {{interest}} in supply chain management (SCM), there is little literature on knowledge and competences needed to properly configure and manage a supply chain. There are some interesting methodologies to map the knowledge and the techniques used in the supply chain of a sector and transfer them in another sector. This is particularly important when cross-fertilisation of practices can support sectors facing global competition as the footwear industry. New business opportunities can in fact be exploited {{addressing the needs of}} specific target groups searching for customised fashion and healthy shoes. Based on literature review and case study analysis of twelve companies within the fashion and <b>orthopaedic</b> footwear <b>supply</b> networks, this work compares the relevant processes and the distinctive capabilities necessary in managing supply networks to implement customisation, identifying and highlighting the interchangeable best practices that could serve as a new common knowledge base to be shared by the two sector...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{is a part}} of CoReNet (Customer-ORiented and Eco-friendly NETworks for healthy fashionable goods), an European 7 th Framework Program project, whose objective is to implement innovative methods and tools to fulfil needs and expectations of specific target groups – elderly, obese, disabled and diabetic people – by improving the supply network structure of the European Textile, Clothing and Footwear Industry (TCFI) to produce small series of functional and fashionable clothes and footwear. This thesis particularly focuses on the footwear sector and analyses how the European fashion footwear companies could reengineer their supply networks {{to address the needs of}} the project target groups. In order to stay competitive, European footwear companies need to enter new markets implementing innovative production methodologies based on networking economy. In fact, footwear sector has become a global industry where competition is planetary and key players are no longer concentrated only in Europe and North America but even in emerging low labour cost countries, because of the combined effects of labour intensity, low entry and exit barriers, and changes in international trade regulations. Moreover, the overall performance of this industry is deeply affected by unpredictable and seasonal demand as well as emerging consumers’ needs in terms of comfort, health and environmental attention. This context forces companies to rethink their strategies. The production of small series of specialized and customized high value added products for the project target groups represents a key opportunity for European Footwear Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs) to foster their competitiveness entering new niche markets. Comparing literature and multiple case studies from the fashion and <b>orthopaedic</b> footwear <b>supply</b> networks, this research aims at highlighting the guidelines for designing an innovative reference model for footwear supply networks. Along this vein the present proposal addresses the design, production and distribution of small series of healthy and fashionable goods for specific target groups, particularly through personalised and comfortable shoes. The reference model aims at supporting collaboration along the whole value chain in the footwear sector to get and manage consumer data to know their needs, involve consumer into design and product configuration phases, exchange consumer data through adequate data models and secure systems, manage the collaboration with suppliers and other partners in order to plan and distribute on time, implement innovative manufacturing tools delivering the product to the final customer, monitoring the quality and sustainability of product...|$|R
