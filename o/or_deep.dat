5|$|Mycosis-related {{cutaneous}} {{conditions are}} caused by fungi or yeasts, and may present as either a superficial <b>or</b> <b>deep</b> infection of the skin, hair, or nails.|$|E
5|$|The A {{center is}} diamagnetic, but if ionized by UV light <b>or</b> <b>deep</b> acceptors, it {{produces}} an {{electron paramagnetic resonance}} spectrum W24, whose analysis unambiguously proves the N=N structure.|$|E
5|$|Crickets {{are found}} in many habitats. Members of several subfamilies {{are found in}} the upper tree canopy, in bushes, and among grasses and herbs. They also occur on the ground and in caves, and some are subterranean, {{excavating}} shallow <b>or</b> <b>deep</b> burrows. Some make galleries in rotting wood, and certain beach-dwelling species can run and jump over the surface of pools.|$|E

50|$|Polish units {{had either}} surrendered, or withdrawn, disorganized, towards the Lithuanian border <b>or</b> <b>deeper</b> into Poland.|$|R
25|$|Sleep {{is quickly}} reversible, {{as opposed to}} {{hibernation}} or coma, and sleep deprivation is followed by longer <b>or</b> <b>deeper</b> rebound sleep.|$|R
5|$|If {{not treated}} carefully, {{necrosis}} will spread, causing skin, subcutaneous tissue and muscle {{to separate from}} healthy tissue and eventually slough with serous exudate. The slough may be superficial <b>or</b> <b>deep,</b> sometimes down to the bone. Gangrene and secondary infections commonly occurs and can result in loss of digits and limbs.|$|E
5|$|Appearing as the player's tutors in {{the game}} are the sentient twin witch doctor masks Aku Aku and Uka Uka, both of whom give hints that help the player develop their racing skills. They double as {{obtainable}} power-ups during the races, temporarily protecting the player from all attacks and obstacles while increasing the kart's speed. However, their power does not protect the player from chasms <b>or</b> <b>deep</b> water.|$|E
5|$|Deep vein {{thrombosis}}, <b>or</b> <b>deep</b> {{venous thrombosis}} (DVT), is {{the formation of}} a blood clot (thrombus) within a deep vein, most commonly the legs. Nonspecific signs may include pain, swelling, redness, warmness, and engorged superficial veins. Pulmonary embolism, a potentially life-threatening complication, is caused by the detachment (embolization) of a clot that travels to the lungs. Together, DVT and pulmonary embolism constitute a single disease process known as venous thromboembolism. Post-thrombotic syndrome, another complication, significantly contributes to the health-care cost of DVT.|$|E
50|$|The {{tricolored heron}} stalks its prey in shallow <b>or</b> <b>deeper</b> water, often running {{as it does}} so. It eats fish, crustaceans, reptiles, and insects.|$|R
50|$|Its {{mineralogy}} and accretionary {{style has}} been {{compared with that of}} the Lophotrochozoans , though its unfamiliar morphology suggests a stem-group <b>or</b> <b>deeper</b> affiliation to this group.|$|R
50|$|The {{oceanic zone}} {{begins in the}} area off shore where the water {{measures}} 200 meters (656 feet) <b>deep</b> <b>or</b> <b>deeper</b> and extends to the ocean floor.|$|R
5|$|In humans, bites {{from this}} species can produce severe local and {{systemic}} symptoms. Based {{on the degree}} and type of local effect, bites {{can be divided into}} two symptomatic categories: those with little or no surface extravasation, and those with hemorrhages evident as ecchymosis, bleeding and swelling. In both cases there is severe pain and tenderness, but in the latter there is widespread superficial <b>or</b> <b>deep</b> necrosis and compartment syndrome. Serious bites cause limbs to become immovably flexed as a result of significant hemorrhage or coagulation in the affected muscles. Residual induration, however, is rare and usually these areas completely resolve.|$|E
5|$|The blast {{caused by}} a sudden release of the gas {{pressure}} inside a diving cylinder makes them very dangerous if mismanaged. The greatest risk of explosion exists while filling, but cylinders have also been known to burst when overheated. The cause of failure can range from reduced wall thickness <b>or</b> <b>deep</b> pitting due to internal corrosion, neck thread failure due to incompatible valve threads, or cracking due to fatigue, sustained high stresses, or overheating effects in aluminum.|$|E
5|$|Although, {{the use of}} oil as {{a binding}} agent {{can be traced to}} the 12th century, {{innovations}} in its handling and manipulation define the era. Egg tempera was the dominant medium until the 1430s, and while it produces both bright and light colours, it dries quickly and is a difficult medium in which to achieve naturalistic textures <b>or</b> <b>deep</b> shadows. Oil allows smooth, translucent surfaces and can be applied in a range of thicknesses, from fine lines to thick broad strokes. It dries slowly and is easily manipulated while still wet. These characteristics allowed more time to add subtle detail and enable wet-on-wet techniques. Smooth transitions of colour are possible because portions of the intermediary layers of paint can be wiped or removed as the paint dries. Oil enables differentiation among degrees of reflective light, from shadow to bright beams, and minute depictions of light effects through the use of transparent glazes. This new freedom in controlling light effects gave rise to more precise and realistic depictions of surface textures; van Eyck and van der Weyden typically show light falling on surfaces such as jewellery, wooden floors, textiles and household objects.|$|E
5000|$|When {{there is}} a {{continuing}} relationship between disputants, helping them find a settlement for their current disagreement is often not enough. New conflicts may arise <b>or</b> <b>deeper</b> issues resurface.|$|R

25|$|Culture and {{sensitivity}} {{is recommended for}} rapidly progressive <b>or</b> <b>deep</b> corneal ulcers.
