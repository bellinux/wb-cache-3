500|$|Yellow dyes are [...] "about as {{numerous}} as red ones", {{and can be}} extracted from saffron, pomegranate rind, turmeric, safflower, <b>onionskins,</b> {{and a number of}} weedy flowering plants. [...] Limited evidence suggests the use of weld (Reseda luteola), also called mignonette or dyer's rocket before the Iron Age, but it was an important dye of the ancient Mediterranean and Europe and is indigenous to England. Two brilliant yellow dyes of commercial importance in Europe from the 18th century are derived from trees of the Americas: quercitron from the inner bark of Eastern Black Oak (Quercus velutina), native to eastern North America and fustic from the dyer's mulberry tree (Maclura tinctoria) of the West Indies and Mexico.|$|R
50|$|On Wed June 9, 2010, Smith Micro {{released}} Anime Studio 7, which added {{features such}} as Physics, 3D creation, and improved interface. Approximately, one year later, on Wed June 8, 2011, Smith Micro released Anime Studio 8, which added {{features such as}} the Character Wizard, layered Photoshop import, and real-time media connection. The first major update of Anime Studio 8, version 8.1, also supported the new Poser 9 SDK and integrated the Wacom Multi-touch API. The latter feature made Anime Studio 8.1 the first graphics based software product to work natively with Wacom's Multi-touch Wacom Bamboo and Wacom Intuos tablets. On Monday, September 10, 2012, Smith Micro released Anime Studio 9, to date {{it is the most}} professional oriented upgrade to the Anime Studio product line since Moho. All of the new features were in response to the growing needs and requests of its professional users. New features include Smart Bones, Editable Motion Graphs and Bézier handles, and major enhancements to the timeline, key frames and <b>onionskins.</b> On Tuesday August 13, 2013, Smith Micro released Anime Studio Pro 9.5 an upgrade version for Anime Studio 9 containing improvements and enhancements to its predecessor. In December 2014, Anime Studio 10 contains upgraded features and new mechanics to its predecessor.|$|R

50|$|In {{traditional}} cartoon animation, {{the individual}} frames {{of a movie}} were initially drawn on thin <b>onionskin</b> paper over a light source.

The grey roast beef and overcooked cabbage with watery potatoes served at the fifth floor canteen of RADA were unappetizing. She wrote to her mother, begging her for recipes of the home cooked meals of her childhood. Her mother responded with recipes written in Hindi on <b>onionskin</b> paper in letters sent via airmail. The very first letter was dated 19 March 1956 and included recipes for meat spiced with cinnamon, cardamom and bay, a cauliflower dish, and egg curry with hard-boiled eggs. The first recipe that she tried was potatoes with cumin. She bought pumpernickel from a neighborhood Jewish bakery {{as a substitute for}} chapatis.|$|E
5000|$|The {{workload}} {{of the new}} Criminal Court of Appeals was immense. Upon its creation, the Court {{had inherited}} pending criminal appeals from the Court of Appeals of the Indian Territory and the Supreme Court of Oklahoma Territory. Using typewriters, carbons, and <b>onionskin</b> papers, the Court on average issued published opinions in over 300 cases annually for several years after statehood, and unpublished summary opinions in many more. Hundreds of cases were appealed from convictions for violating the prohibitory act, often prosecuted on purely technical grounds by plainly guilty defendants. [...] In the fall of 1912, Furman mentioned in the Ostendorf opinion {{that the members of}} the Court [...] "are worked to the limit of human endurance." [...] Judge Doyle would later recall that it was in this same period, a little more than three years before his death, that Judge Furman's health began to fail and he suffered a stroke.|$|E
5000|$|The Yellow Sheet Report is a subscription-based, on-line {{newsletter}} for Arizona political {{gossip and}} news. It originated in 1906 {{as part of}} the Arizona News Service and provided clients with political and governmental news when the Legislature was not in session. The newsletter got its name from the <b>onionskin</b> paper on which it originally was printed. In recent years, the Yellow Sheet Report was published and mailed three times a week. In 2007, it moved to the World Wide Web and is now available year-round. The Yellow Sheet Report is the “News Notes & Gossip” section - a compilation of short news pieces that cover the gamut of Arizona politics, including news about the Legislature, state agencies, the executive offices, the state’s congressional delegation and elections. Much of the news centers on commentary and gossip from political consultants, lobbyists and other political insiders, often known in Arizona’s political community as “railbirds.” ...|$|E
5000|$|Train {{orders were}} {{issued by the}} {{dispatcher}} responsible for the portion of railroad concerned. They were conveyed to operators at outlying stations along the railroad via telegraph or telephone. The receiving operators would copy the order onto <b>onionskin</b> (multiple-copy) forms designed for that purpose, and would repeat the order back to the dispatcher. This permitted the dispatcher and other operators concerned to confirm the accuracy or the order. As each operator correctly repeated the order, the dispatcher would give a complete time, along with the initials of the designated railroad official for that territory. After the order was completed, it was delivered by the operator to the concerned trains as they arrived or passed the delivery point. The operating timetable indicated locations at which train crews could expect to receive train orders. If that same timetable did not require that a train receive a [...] "Clearance Form A" [...] before departing, then a train order signal of some type was provided to advise train crews whether or not train orders were to be delivered. Delivery was accomplished by hand, if the train stopped, or posted trackside to be grabbed by a crew member while the train continued to move past the station. With the latter, the paper order {{was placed in a}} train order fork or hoop, either held by the operator as the train passed or mounted at trackside.|$|E
30|$|Increasing {{the process}} {{temperature}} significantly influences {{the formation and}} the subsequent roles that the bands play {{in the formation of}} a crack path in a weld nugget placed under cyclic loading. The differences in the size, shape and density of the intermetallic particles within the bands are the result of hotter welds. Crack initiation in the weld is affected by <b>onionskin</b> partial bonding defects, and the tool pitch directly influences these defects. For a constant rotational speed, softening of the weld nugget reduces as the feed rate or translational tool velocity is increased (Krishnan 2002). Hence, {{it is clear that the}} formation of an <b>onionskin</b> macrostructure is related to variation in the tool pitch along the weld joint. Consequently, the possibility exists for process optimization to modify the weld microstructure and improve material properties, including fracture resistance.|$|E

40|$|Pulmonary {{arterial}} hypertension (PAH) {{is a well}} recognized, albeit uncommon, complication of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and is characterized histologically {{by the presence of}} <b>onionskin</b> thickening of small arterioles. We described a 24 year-old female with SLE, complicated by pulmonary hypertension after a six-week exposure to dexfenfluramine, who died of acute myocardial infarction complicated with pneumococcal sepsis. Autopsy demonstrated pulmonary arteriolar thickening with severe sclerosis as well as the more advanced plexiform and angiomatoid lesions. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that in this case the use of dexfenfluramine, albeit for a relatively short period, exerted a synergistic effect on the predisposition to PAH already inherent in this patient with SLE.

30|$|Aluminium alloys {{are most}} {{attractive}} solutions for many industrial sectors, including the aerospace, marine and other transportation industries, where demand for lightweight structures exists. FSW avoids {{problems related to}} melting, formation of cast microstructure and solidification of weld shrink zone {{that are associated with}} conventional fusion welding. Weld defects found in friction-stir welds are quite different from conventional welding flaws. FSW defects include an <b>onionskin</b> microstructure, tunnel voids, porosity, defective tightness, excessive flash, ‘kissing-bond’ defects and crack-like root flaws. In order to avoid such defects, the thermo-physical and mechanical properties of the welded material should be identified and the processing temperature and processing rates manipulated accordingly. Tool rotary speed and tool traverse speed govern the peak temperature generated during FSW and the time required to weld the material. The way in which temperature affects material properties varies significantly for different aluminium alloys. Hence, friction-stir welding parameters suitable for processing one series of aluminium alloys differ considerably from those suitable for other series alloys.|$|E
30|$|Onion-ring {{structures}} in friction-stir welds {{of aluminium alloys}} can be observed as bands in the weld nuggets. Onion-ring structures have notable dark and bright bands, and the spacing between the bands {{is equal to the}} forward motion of the tool in one rotation. In an onion-ring structure, the spacing of the alternate bands increases with the increasing rotations of the tool and increasing material transport per measure of the weld length (Krishnan 2002). The rotary speed of the tool determines the amount of heat produced per unit time and the stirring and the mixing of the material around the pin (Peel et al. 2003). The rotary and traverse speeds of the tool govern the peak temperature generated during welding and the time required for welding of the material. The translation of the tool entrains the material from the advancing side, and the material is rotated around the pin and deposited on the rear of the retreating side. Material carried from the retreating side of the weld is deposited to fill in the material cavity {{in the wake of the}} pin (Krishnan 2002; Nandan et al. 2008). Thus, the FSW nugget consists of a mixture of two streams of material with different histories and mechanical properties, which often leads to an <b>onionskin</b> microstructure.|$|E
40|$|The {{palindromic}} Tetrahymena ribosomal DNA (rDNA) minichromosome is amplified 10, 000 -fold during development. Subsequent vegetative replication is {{cell cycle}} regulated. rDNA replication differs fundamentally in cycling vegetative and nondividing amplifying cells. Using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, we {{show for the}} first time that replication origins that direct gene amplification also function in normal dividing cells. Two classes of amplification intermediates were identified. The first class is indistinguishable from vegetative rDNA, initiating in just one of the two 5 ' nontranscribed spacer (NTS) copies in the rDNA palindrome at either of two closely spaced origins. Thus, these origins are active throughout the life cycle and their regulation changes at different developmental stages. The second, novel class of amplification intermediates is generated by multiple initiation events. Intermediates with mass greater than fully replicated DNA were observed, suggesting that <b>onionskin</b> replication occurs at this stage. Unlike amplified rDNA in Xenopus laevis, the novel Tetrahymena species are not produced by random initiation; replication also initiates in the 5 ' NTS. Surprisingly, a replication fork barrier which is activated only in these amplifying molecules blocks the progression of forks near the center of the palindrome. Whereas barriers have been previously described, this is the first instance in which programmed regulation of replication fork progression has been demonstrated in a eukaryote...|$|E
40|$|Hidden {{away for}} decades within the Department of Textiles, Division of Home 2 ̆ 6 Community Life, National Museum of American History, was an {{extraordinary}} group of nearly 1000 textile samples collected by US consuls around the world between about 1898 and about 1920. The Commerce Department transferred them to the U. S. National Museum (now NMAH), in the 1920 s. The samples {{range in size from}} just a few inches square to a few feet. The information that came into the collection with each sample, from lists or scraps of paper attached by the consuls, was typed onto <b>onionskin</b> typing paper or cardstock and attached to the samples. These amazing bits of information open many research avenues into the theme of the 2016 Textile Society of America symposium: Land, Labor, and the Port. By examining the questions that arise from just a few examples from the Consular Collections, this paper explores the tangled threads of the global textile trade in the late 19 th and early 20 th centuries, and suggests some of the many research possibilities these textiles offer to scholars. I discovered the collection within a few days of beginning work as a curator at NMAH. One portion of the consular samples is housed in a filing cabinet filled with manila envelopes containing textiles of varying sizes and 8 ” x 10 ” cards with textile samples and ancient photostats stapled to them. Tantalizing labels on the file separators: Made or found in Egypt; Made or Found in Germany; Made or found in China; Made or found in Africa. 1 An envelope pulled at random from the Africa section, revealed a bolt end or wrapper of unbleached plain weave cotton, with the notation on the envelope, “From a market in Abyssinia, 1904. ” The muslin was stamped in blue ink with the image of a camel. Another piece of information in blue ink – a company name: Pelzer Mfg. Co, Pelzer, S. C. And finally, a paper label also bearing the Pelzer name. [Figure 1] Now what, I wondered, was a South Carolina cotton mill doing with a camel trademark and a market in East Africa {{at the turn of the}} 20 th century? My own research into Southern American cotton mills had been confined more or less to events and businesses before the Centennial and the end of Reconstruction in 1876. A quick online search turned up some basic information on the firm, and images from the Library of Congress’s Prints and Photographs Division. Pelzer had been established in the early 1880 s, by a small group of South Carolinians. The mill was a manifestation of the post-Reconstruction South’s efforts to move the production of cotton cloth closer to the source of the raw material, and derive profit from the cotton industry, not just cotton agriculture. It was considered a show mill by many for its up to date equipment and technology. Its mill workers inhabited an extraordinarily paternalistic mill town. 2 The photos were by Lewis Hine, dating to 1912, documenting child labor in the Pelzer Mill. South Carolina’s first child labor law went into effect in 1903, theoretically preventing children under the age of 12, unless they were orphans or supporting a single parent, from working in the mills, but in practice this restriction was often circumvented, in a number of ingenious ways. 3 More detailed information, however, would require deeper digging...|$|E
