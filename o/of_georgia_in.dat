5|$|Joseph M. Pettit became {{president}} of the Georgia Institute of Technology in 1972. During his 14-year tenure as president, Pettit was credited with turning Georgia Tech into a top-flight research institution. Pettit has also received credit for shifting Georgia Tech back to its roots with regards to providing assistance with economic development within the state <b>of</b> <b>Georgia.</b> <b>In</b> the decades known for the Vietnam War and the launch of Sputnik, research at Georgia Tech and the Georgia Tech Research Institute had become so tied with NASA and the Department of Defense that local industrial development had been largely forgotten.|$|E

5|$|With the British {{colonization}} <b>of</b> <b>Georgia</b> <b>in</b> 1732, the 13 colonies {{that would}} become the United States of America were established. All had local governments with elections open to most free men, with a growing devotion to the ancient rights of Englishmen {{and a sense of}} self-government stimulating support for republicanism. With extremely high birth rates, low death rates, and steady settlement, the colonial population grew rapidly. Relatively small Native American populations were eclipsed. The Christian revivalist movement of the 1730s and 1740s known as the Great Awakening fueled interest in both religion and religious liberty.|$|E
5|$|Georgia Tech is {{the birthplace}} of two other Georgia universities: Georgia State University and the former Southern Polytechnic State University. Georgia Tech's Evening School of Commerce, {{established}} in 1912 {{and moved to the}} University <b>of</b> <b>Georgia</b> <b>in</b> 1931, was independently established as Georgia State University in 1955. Although Georgia Tech did not officially allow women to enroll until 1952 (and did not fully integrate the curriculum until 1968), the night school enrolled female students as early as the fall of 1917. The Southern Technical Institute (now Southern Polytechnic College of Engineering and Engineering Technology of Kennesaw State University and formerly known as Southern Polytechnic State University) was created as an extension of Georgia Tech in 1948 as a technical trade school for World War II veterans and became an independent university in 1981.|$|E

5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1895, Warner was asked for a {{reference}} to fill the vacant head coaching position at Iowa State University, in Ames, Iowa. Instead of giving a reference, Warner himself applied for the job and received an offer for $25 (approximately $670 in 2016) a week. At the same time, he decided to apply to other schools and received an offer of $34 (approximately $915 in 2016) per week from the University <b>of</b> <b>Georgia</b> <b>in</b> Athens, Georgia. Because Iowa State began its season in Augustalmost {{one and a half}} months prior to the beginning in Georgia, Warner was able to work out a deal. For $150 (Approximately $4,000 in 2016), he would coach in Iowa from August until the second week of September; and then head to Georgia and begin coaching there.|$|E
5|$|Jarrell's career {{took him}} to Africa in 1977, where he found {{inspiration}} in the Senufo people of Ivory Coast, Mali and Burkina Faso. Upon return to the United States he moved to Georgia and taught at the University <b>of</b> <b>Georgia.</b> <b>In</b> Georgia, he began to use a bricklayer's trowel on his canvases, creating a textured appearance within his already visually active paintings. The figures often seen in his paintings are abstract and inspired by the masks and sculptures of Nigeria. These Nigerian arts have also inspired Jarrell's totem sculptures. Living and working in Cleveland, Jarrell continues to explore the contemporary African American experience through his paintings, sculptures, and prints. His work {{is found in the}} collections of the National Museum of African American History and Culture, High Museum of Art, The Studio Museum in Harlem and the University of Delaware.|$|E

5|$|Production {{slowed down}} with the {{collapse}} of the Soviet Union and economic stagnation in the independent Republic <b>of</b> <b>Georgia.</b> <b>In</b> 1995, bottling of Borjomi was restarted by the Georgian Glass and Mineral Waters Company (GG), which increased the production forty-fold. According to the company, 80% of Borjomi produced that year was exported abroad—more than half of this amount to Russia. Despite counterfeit drinks being produced under the Borjomi label as a result of rising piracy during the 1990s, Borjomi water was able to reclaim its reputation by 2000 in a distinctive packaging campaign. The piracy also slowed down due to the 1998 Russian financial crisis.|$|E
5|$|R.E.M. put Sweet {{in touch}} with Easter, who wrote Sweet a number of long letters, and {{suggested}} he move to Athens {{after graduating from high}} school. Meanwhile, Stipe really liked Sweet's tape, and he also played it for his sister, Lynda, and friend Linda Hopper, who were both in the band Oh-OK. All three sent Sweet postcards saying he should come perform in Athens, with Lynda and Linda inviting him to open for Oh-OK there. Sweet told his parents that he wanted to study at the University <b>of</b> <b>Georgia,</b> <b>in</b> Athens.

5|$|The Great Depression {{threatened}} the already tentative nature of Georgia Tech's funding. In {{a speech on}} April 27, 1930, Brittain proposed that the university system be reorganized under a central body, rather than having each university under its own board. As a result, the Georgia General Assembly and Governor Richard Russell, Jr. passed an act in 1931 that established the University System of Georgia and the corresponding Georgia Board of Regents; unfortunately for Brittain and Georgia Tech, the board was composed almost entirely of graduates of the University <b>of</b> <b>Georgia.</b> <b>In</b> its final act on January 7, 1932, the Tech Board of Trustees {{sent a letter to}} the chairman of the Georgia Board of Regents outlining its priorities for the school. The Depression also affected enrollment, which dropped from 3,271 in 1931–1932 to a low of 2,482 in 1933–1934, and only gradually increased afterwards. It also caused a decrease in funding from the State of Georgia, which in turn caused a decrease in faculty salaries, firing of graduate student assistants, and a postponing of building renovations.|$|E

5|$|On July 3, Pemberton sent {{a note to}} Grant {{regarding}} the possibility of negotiations for peace. Grant, {{as he had done}} at Fort Donelson, first demanded unconditional surrender. But Grant reconsidered, not wanting to feed 30,000 hungry Confederates in Union prison camps, and offered to parole all prisoners. Considering their destitute state, dejected and starving, he never expected them to fight again; he hoped they would carry home the stigma of defeat {{to the rest of the}} Confederacy. In any event, it would have occupied his army and taken months to ship that many prisoners north. Pemberton officially surrendered his army on July 4. Most of the men who were paroled on July 6 were exchanged and received back into the Confederate Army on August 4, 1863, at Mobile Harbor, Alabama. They were back in Chattanooga, Tennessee, by September and some fought in the Battles for Chattanooga in November and against Sherman's invasion <b>of</b> <b>Georgia</b> <b>in</b> May 1864. The Confederate government protested the validity of the paroles on technical grounds and the issue was referred to Grant who, in April 1864, was general in chief of the Army. The dispute effectively ended all further prisoner exchanges during the war except for hardship cases.|$|E
5|$|The couple's first better {{documented}} child, Princess Elene, {{was born}} in 1753, followed by 22 more between 1755 and 1782. As her sons grew up, Darejan's desire to secure the right of succession for her offspring against Heraclius's eldest surviving son of his second marriage to Anna Abashidze, the Crown Prince George, became the cornerstone of Darejan's involvement in the politics <b>of</b> <b>Georgia.</b> <b>In</b> {{the last years of}} Heraclius II's life, she became more involved and influential. In 1791, Darejan persuaded her husband to overturn the principle of primogeniture in favor of fraternal inheritance, mandating in his will that after his death, his eldest son George would become king, but that after George's death, the throne would pass to the next surviving son of Heraclius, rather than to George's offspring. The surviving sons of Heraclius and Darejan—Iulon, Vakhtang, Mirian, Alexander, and Parnaoz—thus, emerged in the line of succession. After Heraclius's death in 1798, the now King George XII, reneged on the will of the late king, declaring it invalid on account of it being forced upon his father. This occasioned a further breakdown in already strained relations between George XII and Darejan and his half-brothers.|$|E
