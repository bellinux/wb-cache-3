40|$|The Bible {{as a whole}} {{establishes}} the doctrine <b>of</b> <b>sin.</b> The New Testament doctrine <b>of</b> <b>sin</b> is developed on {{the foundation of the}} Old Testament doctrine <b>of</b> <b>sin.</b> Paul and John speak particularly on the doctrine <b>of</b> <b>sin</b> as a whole. So a study of their doctrine <b>of</b> <b>sin</b> would contribute to a total Biblical understanding. The problem of this study is the Biblical doctrine <b>of</b> <b>sin</b> limited to the New Testament writers, John and Paul, as they speak of the doctrine <b>of</b> <b>sin,</b> in relation to the doctrine <b>of</b> <b>sin</b> as a whole. Since the problem concerns the doctrine <b>of</b> <b>sin</b> as stated by the New Testament writers, John and Paul, in relation to the doctrine <b>of</b> <b>sin</b> as a whole, it is necessary to consider several definite facts. In order to understand sin it is first necessary to show its relationship to man in a study of theological anthropology. It is also necessary to show the relationship of Paul and John 2 ̆ 7 s doctrine <b>of</b> <b>sin.</b> In order to correctly understand either John or Paul 2 ̆ 7 s doctrine <b>of</b> <b>sin</b> it is first necessary to review the Bible teaching regarding man in relation to <b>sin.</b> The doctrine <b>of</b> <b>sin</b> is not understood apart from man. The study of man in relation to sin is titled 2 ̆ 2 Theological Anthropology. 2 ̆ 2 It is presented as the first study in order to fully understand man in relation to the biblical doctrine <b>of</b> <b>sin.</b> Man 2 ̆ 7 s origin, man as a sinner and man under grace are the three aspects of this study of theological anthropology. John and Paul are generally recognized as the main theologians in the New Testament. John 2 ̆ 7 s purpose in writing the Gospel was to convince the reader that this was the Christ and that believing he should have eternal life. His purpose in the First Epistle was the enhance his joy, to keep the Christian from sin, to lead them into an assurance of salvation and to warn them against error. Certain aspects of the doctrine <b>of</b> <b>sin</b> are still presented in the Gospel. More of the doctrine <b>of</b> <b>sin</b> appears in the First Epistle of John. Therefore it is necessary to study the terms which mean sin or describe certain aspects <b>of</b> <b>sin</b> in order to discern John 2 ̆ 7 s doctrine <b>of</b> <b>sin</b> as a whole...|$|R

40|$|While {{there has}} been a renewed {{awareness}} of the social dimensions <b>of</b> <b>sin</b> in theological discourse, Gregory Baum {{is one of the few}} theologians who has explored the relationship between personal and social sin from within clearly articulated foundations. Baum 2 ̆ 7 s analyses <b>of</b> <b>sin</b> range over the course of his theological development which shifts from an emphasis on existential concerns to a dialogue with sociology and concentration on societal transformation. It is the context of the former that Baum develops his notion of personal sin; it is in context of the latter that he proposes an understanding <b>of</b> social <b>sin</b> and a dialectical relationship between personal and social sin. Baum concludes that personal and social sin must be viewed as equally essential in a comprehensive understanding <b>of</b> <b>sin</b> and must be defined from the perspective of their interdependence. The chief problematic that emerges in Baum 2 ̆ 7 s analyses is whether in the transition from viewing sin from a personal to a societal context, the reality <b>of</b> personal <b>sin</b> and the ontological roots <b>of</b> <b>sin</b> are reduced to socio-political factors with a concurrent secularization <b>of</b> <b>sin,</b> conversion, and salvation. This problematic is addressed by first situating Baum 2 ̆ 7 s theology within the context of the traditional and contemporary discussion <b>of</b> <b>sin,</b> then by summarizing, analyzing, and assessing Baum 2 ̆ 7 s foundations for and definitions of personal and social sin within the development of his theology and continually evolving methodology. It is found that Baum 2 ̆ 7 s theological foundations, especially his doctrine of God and understanding of the transcendent dimension <b>of</b> <b>sin,</b> lead to an unacceptable secularization <b>of</b> <b>sin</b> and inadequate understanding of the personal dimensions <b>of</b> <b>sin.</b> However, Baum successfully corrects the distortions of privatized notions <b>of</b> <b>sin</b> that underrate the social dimensions <b>of</b> <b>sin.</b> His concept <b>of</b> social <b>sin</b> and proposal <b>of</b> the dialectical relationship between personal and social sin provide a sound theoretical framework that could be developed into a comprehensive theology <b>of</b> <b>sin</b> that neglects neither the transcendent nor the personal dimensions <b>of</b> <b>sin...</b>|$|R
5|$|In May 1645, Parliament {{passed an}} {{ordinance}} allowing excommunicants {{to appeal the}} church's sentences to Parliament. Another ordinance on 20October contained a list <b>of</b> <b>sins</b> to which the church would be limited in its power to excommunicate. To {{the majority of the}} divines' dismay, an even more Erastian ordinance was proposed in March 1646. The Assembly published a protest, provoking the Commons to charge it with breach of privilege and to submit nine questions to the divines on the matter. Votes were to be included with the answers, an attempt to force the divines associated with the protest petition to reveal themselves.|$|E
5|$|Reformed confessions {{reject the}} Catholic {{doctrine}} that the Eucharist is a sacrifice of propitiation, or sacrifice to satisfy God's wrath and attain forgiveness <b>of</b> <b>sins.</b> Instead, they teach that Christ's body {{is only to}} be received, not re-presented to God as a sacrifice. The confessions do sometimes speak of the Supper as a sacrifice of thanksgiving for the gift of propitiation which has been received. In the twentieth century, Scottish Reformed theologian T. F. Torrance developed a strong doctrine of Eucharistic sacrifice. He argued that Christ's person and work could not be separated, and that the Eucharist mediated his sacrificial death.|$|E
5|$|Stephen found {{fault with}} Symeon {{especially}} for his charismatic approach, and {{his support of}} individual direct experience of God's grace. Symeon believed that direct experience gave monks the authority to preach and give absolution <b>of</b> <b>sins,</b> {{without the need for}} formal ordination—as practiced by his own teacher, Symeon the Studite. Church authorities also taught from a speculative and philosophical perspective, while Symeon taught from his own direct mystical experience. Symeon's teachings, especially those regarding the direct experience of God's grace, brought accusations of heresy from Stephen. Symeon responded to Stephen's charges by declaring that the real heresy was to teach {{that it is impossible to}} have direct experience of God (Disc. 29.4).|$|E
60|$|WISE. You say well, and I {{will add}} {{a word or}} two more to what I have said. Repentance, as it is not {{produced}} without a sight and sense <b>of</b> <b>sin,</b> so every sight and sense <b>of</b> <b>sin</b> cannot produce it; I mean every sight and sense <b>of</b> <b>sin</b> cannot produce that repentance, that is repentance unto salvation; repentance never to be repented of. For it is yet fresh before us, that Mr. Badman had a sight and sense <b>of</b> <b>sin,</b> in that fit of sickness that he had before, but it died without procuring any such godly fruit; as was manifest by his so soon returning with the dog to his vomit. Many people think also that repentance stands in confession <b>of</b> <b>sin</b> only, but they are very much mistaken; for repentance, as was said before, is a being sorry for, and returning from transgression to God by Jesus Christ. Now, if this be true, that every sight and sense <b>of</b> <b>sin</b> will not produce repentance, then repentance cannot be produced there where there is no sight and sense <b>of</b> <b>sin.</b> That every sight and sense <b>of</b> <b>sin</b> will not produce repentance, to wit, the godly repentance that we are speaking of, is manifest in Cain, Pharaoh, Saul, and Judas, who all of them had sense, great sense <b>of</b> <b>sin,</b> but none <b>of</b> them repentance unto life.|$|R

5|$|The Recognitions of Clement {{contains}} a source document (Rec. 1.27–71), conventionally {{referred to by}} scholars as the Ascents of James, which {{is believed to be}} of Jewish–Christian origin. The Ascents shares a similarity to the Gospel of the Ebionites with regard to the baptism of the Pharisees by John (Pan. 30.13.4; Rec. 1.54.6–7) and the command to abolish the Jewish sacrifices, adding that a Christian water baptism is to be substituted for the remission <b>of</b> <b>sins.</b> Based on these similarities, scholars Richard Bauckham and F. Stanley Jones have postulated a direct dependence of the Ascents of James on the Gospel of the Ebionites.|$|E

5|$|All five {{versions}} of the speech differ widely from one another in regard to particulars. All versions, except that in the Gesta Francorum, generally agree that Urban talked about the violence of European society {{and the necessity of}} maintaining the Peace of God; about helping the Greeks, who had asked for assistance; about the crimes being committed against Christians in the east; and about a new kind of war, an armed pilgrimage, and of rewards in heaven, where remission <b>of</b> <b>sins</b> was offered to any who might die in the undertaking. They do not all specifically mention Jerusalem as the ultimate goal. However, {{it has been argued that}} Urban's subsequent preaching reveals that he expected the expedition to reach Jerusalem all along. According to one version of the speech, the enthusiastic crowd responded with cries of Deus vult! ("God wills it!"). However, other {{versions of}} the speech do not include this detail.|$|E

Ford disagrees with the belief of sinless perfection, and does not hold to the belief that the saints are sealed at the end time, but holds that the final removal <b>of</b> <b>sin</b> occurs when mortality changes to immortality at the return of Jesus Christ. Ford holds that victory over the presence <b>of</b> <b>sin</b> does not occur during this lifetime, so sin continues among the saints up to the return of Jesus Christ.|$|R

5|$|Christian baptismal {{theology}} {{prior to}} the Reformation taught that sacraments, including baptism, are means or instruments through which God communicates grace to people. The sacrament was considered valid regardless of who administered it. Not everyone who received a sacrament, however, received the grace signified by the sacrament. Some medieval theologians spoke of an obstacle of mortal sin which blocks the grace of the sacrament, while others insisted that the recipient be positively open and responding in faith to the sacrament {{in order to receive}} any benefit. Baptism was believed to be used by the Holy Spirit to transform the believer, and offered the benefits of remission <b>of</b> <b>sins,</b> regeneration, and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. The sacrament of penance was believed to be necessary for forgiveness for sins committed after baptism.|$|E
5|$|Reformed Christians believe baptism to {{be a sign}} of regeneration, or {{the making}} of one into a new creature, based on the {{connection}} found in the New Testament between regeneration and washing with water. Baptism also represents forgiveness or remission of sin by the sprinkling of the blood of Christ, similarly to the sprinkling of blood of sacrificial animals. Baptism is held by almost the entire Reformed tradition to effect regeneration, even in infants who are incapable of faith, by effecting faith which would come to fruition later. However, Reformed theologians do not teach that baptism is necessarily bound to the forgiveness <b>of</b> <b>sins.</b> Not everyone who participates in the outward rite of baptism can be said to has had their sins forgiven. Rather, it is necessary that the baptized person participate spiritually by faith in order to receive this benefit.|$|E
5|$|Continental {{reformer}} Philipp Melanchthon {{was aware}} that he was very much admired by Henry. In early 1539, Melanchthon wrote several letters to Henry criticising his views on religion, in particular his support of clerical celibacy. By late April another delegation from the Lutheran princes arrived to build on Melanchthon's exhortations. Cromwell {{wrote a letter to the}} king in support of the new Lutheran mission. However, the king had begun to change his stance and concentrated on wooing conservative opinion in England rather than reaching out to the Lutherans. On 28 April 1539, Parliament met for the first time in three years. Cranmer was present, but Cromwell was unable to attend due to ill health. On 5 May the House of Lords created a committee with the customary religious balance between conservatives and reformers to examine and determine doctrine. However, the committee was given little time to do the detailed work needed for a thorough revision. On 16 May, the Duke of Norfolk noted that the committee had not agreed on anything, and proposed that the Lords examine six doctrinal questions—which eventually formed the basis of the Six Articles. They affirmed the conservative interpretation of doctrines such as the real presence, clerical celibacy, and the necessity of auricular confession, the private confession <b>of</b> <b>sins</b> to a priest. As the Act of the Six Articles neared passage in Parliament, Cranmer moved his wife and children out of England to safety. Up until this time, the family was kept quietly hidden, most likely in Ford Palace in Kent. The Act passed Parliament at the end of June and it forced Latimer and Nicholas Shaxton to resign their dioceses given their outspoken opposition to the measure.|$|E

This thesis rejects any individualistic or private conception <b>of</b> <b>sin</b> as unbiblical and contrary to the mainstream of Christian tradition.

At the same time each of the theologians approaches the problem in a different way, highlighting that dimension <b>of</b> <b>sin</b> which is most appropriate in his particular context...|$|R
