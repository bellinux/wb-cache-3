5|$|The Opies {{conducted}} {{a study of the}} use of truce terms throughout England, Scotland and Wales in the 1950s and published their results in a book called The Lore and Language of Schoolchildren.

Schools bordering two linguistic regions honoured both. The words used in urban areas were often at odds with words used in the surrounding countryside. The Opies recorded around 45 truce terms plus variations. The most widely used were barley, fainites, kings, crosses, keys, skinch, cree and scribs.|$|E

40|$|We study noise-assisted {{transport}} in {{a binary}} mixture of overdamped interacting particles. As <b>one</b> species (<b>termed</b> “active”) {{is subject to}} a weak dc drive, the other <b>one</b> (<b>termed</b> “passive”) can be dragged along due to the clustering of particles of both species. On increasing the external drive, clusters of different size fragment at different thresholds that depend on the mixture temperature, the inter-particle interaction strength, and the densities of both species of particles. Moreover, normal self-diffusion of both species at the fragmentation thresholds undergoes a giant enhancement simultaneous with a markedly negative cross-diffusion coefficient...|$|R
40|$|Action LeToolThis {{paper is}} about colored object programming. It {{focuses on the}} {{rigorous}} handling of independent supplementary behaviours. Two constructs are elaborated: the first <b>one,</b> <b>termed</b> «mixin", to capture one such behaviour in a well defined and reusable way; the second <b>one,</b> <b>termed</b> «derivation", to abstract the assembly of a basic behaviour with a mixin one. For the purpose of reusability, specific attachment constraints are specified at the mixin level. A practical proposal is made that enables the specification of mixins to be simplified, without compromising the efficiency of a derivation. In spite of our specific visual formalism (grounded on connectedness), {{it should be noted}} that the rigorous proposal made here can be incorporated in state-transition formalisms based on insideness instead of connectedness (i. e. formalisms derived from statecharts...|$|R
