5|$|Because of {{the remote}} {{location}} of the Itcha Range, future eruptions are not a major hazard. Future volcanism is most likely {{in the form of}} basaltic cinder cones, but eruptions of felsic magma can not be ruled <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> <b>most</b> immediate hazard relating to future eruptions is of local concern only and includes the possibility of forest fires by lava flows and the disruption of local air traffic if an eruption column is produced. Volcanic ash reduces visibility and can cause jet engine failure, as well as damage to other aircraft systems.|$|E

25|$|Intuitively {{one would}} want an h {{very close to}} zero, however when using floating-point operations, the {{smallest}} number won't give the best approximation of a derivative. As h grows smaller the difference between f (a + h) and f(a) grows smaller, cancelling <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> significant and least erroneous digits and making the most erroneous digits more important. As a result the smallest number of h possible will give a more erroneous approximation of a derivative than a somewhat larger number. This {{is perhaps the most}} common and serious accuracy problem.|$|E

Spain also offered a site at Vandellòs on 17 April 2002, but the EU decided to concentrate its support solely behind the French site in late November 2003. From this point on, the choice was between France and Japan. On 3 May 2005, the EU and Japan agreed to a process which would settle their dispute by July.|$|E

25|$|Although {{a number}} of large caliber guns were {{developed}} during the war that were capable of knocking <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> heavily armored tanks, they proved expensive and difficult to conceal. The latter generation of low-recoil anti-tank weapons, which allowed projectiles {{the size of an}} artillery shell to be fired from a man's shoulder, was considered a far more viable option for arming infantrymen. Recoilless rifles replaced most conventional anti-tank guns in the postwar period; nevertheless, development of new anti-tank guns exhibiting similar low-recoil performances continued until the late 1950s in France, Belgium, and the Soviet Union. A few Soviet designs saw combat well into the 1980s. The People's Republic of China was still producing large caliber anti-tank guns as late as 1988.|$|E
