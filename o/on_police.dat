40|$|This {{is one in}} {{a series}} of papers that are being {{published}} {{as a result of the}} Executive Session <b>on</b> <b>Policing</b> and Public Safety. Harvard’s Executive Sessions are a convening of individuals of independent standing who take joint responsibility for rethinking and improving society’s responses to an issue. Members are selected based on their experiences, their reputation for thoughtfulness and their potential for helping to disseminate the work of the Session. In the early 1980 s, an Executive Session <b>on</b> <b>Policing</b> helped resolve many law enforcement issues of the day. It produced a number of papers and concepts that revolutionized policing. Thirty years later, law enforcement has changed and NIJ and Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government are again collaborating to help resolve law enforcement issues of the day.

40|$|In this paper, we will {{compare the}} {{performance}} of a fuzzy logic (FL) based policer with leaky bucket (LB) based policer. The FL based policer continuously computes the instantaneous drop-rate based on a collective evaluation of the compliance/violation level of the two parameters : (a) the ratio of the up-to-date mean burst length to the negotiated burst length, and (b) the ratio of the up-to-date mean bit rate to the negotiated mean bit rate. Compliance/violation of either of the two parameters results in an increase/decrease of the strength of the rules with consequence Pass/Drop. The throughput performance <b>on</b> <b>policing</b> mean bit rate and mean burst length of the FL based policers is compared with that based on LB based policers of different token pool sizes. Throughput performance curve of the FL based <b>policer</b> <b>on</b> <b>policing</b> mean bit rate is very close to the optimal performance curve of LB based policers, but significantly outperform LB based policers <b>on</b> <b>policing</b> mean burst length...|$|R
