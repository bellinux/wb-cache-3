A compilation of surveys examining the stated financial goals of companies over the century found the following: companies strove to maximize {{market share in}} the late 1960s; earnings per share in the mid-1970s; return on equity in the early 1980s; and cash flow and share prices in present day. Other surveys found that organizations' preferences for evaluating performance related to capital expenditures have shifted dramatically over time. For instance, in 1959, 13% <b>of</b> <b>firms</b> focused on internal rates of return while 86% <b>of</b> <b>firms</b> did so in 1988. In addition, the percentage <b>of</b> <b>firms</b> utilizing accounting measures decreased from 50% in 1959 to 12% in 1988. One potential reason that dominating performance measures change over time is that as organizations replace old measures when they discover their limitations.|$|E

40|$|Topic - This paper {{looks at}} the theory <b>of</b> <b>firm</b> growth. In particular, it {{attempts}} to identify models and determinants <b>of</b> <b>firm</b> growth which are relevant to small enterprises. Research Questions - The following questions are addressed in the paper: (i) How is firm growth viewed in the literature? (ii) What are the models <b>of</b> <b>firm</b> growth most relevant to small enterprises (iii) What are the determinants <b>of</b> small <b>firm</b> growth? Methodology - The paper surveys the literature about firm growth {{with a focus on}} small firms. It discusses evidence from empirical studies to shed lights on the determinants <b>of</b> small <b>firm</b> growth. Findings - The review indicates {{that there has been a}} complete absence of a discussion of an appropriate measure <b>of</b> <b>firm</b> growth in the literature. Theorists have used different measures of growth ranging from employment to profits, value-added, turnover, and total assets. Most studies have been uni-dimensional, looking at individual indicators only. Three models <b>of</b> <b>firm</b> growth are identified to be most relevant to small enterprises. They include stochastic model, human capital model and learning model. Apart from firm size and firm age, which are commonly viewed as the determinants <b>of</b> growth, small <b>firm</b> growth is influenced by industry, location, gender, and human capital of the owner. Other important macro variables that have a direct effect on firm growth are the aggregate level of economic activity, policy, and constraints. Implications - The paper shows the complexity of the issue <b>of</b> <b>firm</b> growth. When it comes to studying small firm growth, it is important to pay attention to the multi-dimensional nature of growth. Thus, it is useful to combine or modify existing models and theories <b>of</b> <b>firm</b> growth in studies about small firm growth...|$|R
