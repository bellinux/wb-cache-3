30|$|A {{grounding}} {{method has}} not been determined for DC microgrids and this {{will continue to be}} an important research topic. The fast acting grounding devices to limit fault current on the basis of solid-state technology need more attention as well. Moreover, novel protection schemes based on fault characteristics are still required to realize fast and accurate fault detection and isolation. Although the aforementioned protection methods all behave well to some degree, the protection coordination of upstream and downstream devices is envisioned as a further study topic in the future. Therefore, all types of protection devices need to be coordinated and integrated into an <b>overall</b> <b>protection</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
30|$|One popular {{technology}} for digital right protection is digital watermarking [1], where a specific signal (e.g., the ownership information) is embedded into the host media content without significantly degrading the perceptual {{quality of the}} original media data. In contrast to traditional encryption techniques, watermarked media data can still be used while remaining protected, and thus watermarking can provide post-delivery protection of digital media. It is worth mentioning that, despite the popularity of watermarking techniques, effective digital right protection is extremely challenging and currently there is no commonly accepted technical solution which is practically unbeatable when deployed to practical user settings. At any sense, watermarking techniques should only be considered as one important component of an <b>overall</b> <b>protection</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

30|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the current research}} status on relative issues of DC microgrids and reviews the proposed protection strategies. The concept of DC microgrids, including distributed generators, converters, storage batteries and various loads, is introduced. The fault current quickly increases with large peaks due to low fault impedance, which means that fault detection and isolation should be performed as soon as possible. The current <b>protection</b> <b>systems</b> have been presented in detail including protection devices, grounding options and protection principles and schemes. These aforementioned contents cannot completely satisfy the protection requirements for DC microgrids. Lacking effective <b>overall</b> <b>protection</b> <b>systems</b> restricts the development and promotion of DC microgrids. Several key lines of protection research prospects can be pointed out. Novel protection devices meeting the technical and economic requirements {{should continue to be}} studied and developed. The influence of different grounding methods should be analyzed. Only then can a widely accepted grounding method for DC microgrids be determined. Novel protection schemes are still in demand to realize fast and accurate fault detection and isolation. Meanwhile, the protection coordination of upstream and downstream devices will be an important research topic in the future. With the development of DC microgrids that contain a large amount of electronic devices, the concept of protection could be extended. The control strategy will be {{the first line of defense}} for DC microgrids in response to short-circuit faults. As a result, the coordinated strategy of control and protection could be more effective than considering traditional protection schemes by themselves.|$|R
40|$|Linear elastic, thermo-mechanical stress {{analyses}} of the Space Shuttle Orbiter wing-leading-edge panels is presented for entry heating conditions. The wing-leading-edge panels are made from reinforced carbon-carbon {{and serve as a}} part of the <b>overall</b> thermal <b>protection</b> <b>system.</b> Three-dimensional finite element models are described for three configurations: integrated configuration, an independent single-panel configuration, and a local lower-apex joggle segment. Entry temperature conditions are imposed and the through-the-thickness response is examined. From the integrated model, it was concluded that individual panels can be analyzed independently since minimal interaction between adjacent components occurred. From the independent single-panel model, it was concluded that increased through-the-thickness stress levels developed all along the chord of a panel s slip-side joggle region, and hence isolated local joggle sections will exhibit the same trend. From the local joggle models, it was concluded that two-dimensional plane-strain models can be used to study the influence of subsurface defects along the slip-side joggle region of these panels...|$|R
40|$|Instrument {{transformers}} are {{a crucial}} component of power system protection. They supply the protection system with scaled-down replicas {{of current and}} voltage signals present in a power network to the levels which are safe and practical to op- erate with. The conventional instrument transformers are based on electromagnetic coupling between the power network on the primary side and protective devices on the secondary. Due to such a design, instrument transformers insert distortions in the mentioned signal replicas. Protective devices may be sensitive to these distortions. The inuence of distortions may lead to disastrous misoperations of protective devices. To overcome this problem, a new instrument transformer design has been devised: optical sensing of currents and voltages. In the theory, novel instrument transform- ers promise a distortion-free replication of the primary signals. Since the mentioned novel design has not been widely used in practice so far, its superior performance needs to be evaluated. This poses a question: how can the new technology (design) be evaluated, and compared to the existing instrument transformer technology? The importance of this question lies in its consequence: is there a necessity to upgrade the protection system, i. e. to replace the conventional instrument transformers with the novel ones, which would be quite expensive and time-consuming? The posed question can be answered by comparing inuences of both the novel and the conventional instrument transformers on the protection system. At present, there is no systematic approach to this evaluation. Since the evaluation could lead to an improvement of the <b>overall</b> <b>protection</b> <b>system,</b> this thesis proposes a comprehensive and systematic methodology for the evaluation. The thesis also proposes a complete solution for the evaluation, {{in the form of}} a simulation environment. Finally, the thesis presents results of evaluation, along with their interpretation...|$|E
40|$|The {{current status}} of {{aerothermal}} and thermal <b>protection</b> <b>system</b> modeling for civilian entry missions is reviewed. For most such missions, the accuracy of our simulations is limited not by the tools and processes currently employed, but rather by reducible deficiencies in the underlying physical models. Improving the accuracy of and reducing the uncertainties in these models will enable {{a greater understanding of}} the system level impacts of a particular thermal <b>protection</b> <b>system</b> and of the system operation and risk over the operational life of the system. A strategic plan will be laid out by which key modeling deficiencies can be identified via mission-specific gap analysis. Once these gaps have been identified, the driving component uncertainties are determined via sensitivity analyses. A Monte-Carlo based methodology is presented for physics-based probabilistic uncertainty analysis of aerothermodynamics and thermal <b>protection</b> <b>system</b> material response modeling. These data are then used to advocate for and plan focused testing aimed at reducing key uncertainties. The results of these tests are used to validate or modify existing physical models. Concurrently, a testing methodology is outlined for thermal protection materials. The proposed approach is based on using the results of uncertainty/sensitivity analyses discussed above to tailor ground testing so as to best identify and quantify system performance and risk drivers. A key component of this testing is understanding the relationship between the test and flight environments. No existing ground test facility can simultaneously replicate all aspects of the flight environment, and therefore good models for traceability to flight are critical to ensure a low risk, high reliability thermal <b>protection</b> <b>system</b> design.

The work presented here is based on real-life power system substation design and data and initiated by Danish TSO Energinet. dk {{as a consequence of}} a serious transformer overvoltage damage. A simulation model for the entire system consisting of overhead line, transformer, surge arrester and earth grid has been created in PSCAD/EMTDC. Main focus has been put on the earth grid, which has been submodeled in details in MATLAB using an electromagnetic transient approach based on the thin-wire program made by J. H. Richmond in 1974 for NASA. The earth grid model is verified with excellent agreement compared to already published results. The overvoltage performance of the particular case is analyzed, and it is showed that the transformers LIWL have probably been exceeded.

40|$|China’s {{transition}} from a planned to market economy has been facing challenges in many directions. In attempting to establish a social security system that would function to smooth the transition, government has made efforts {{for most of the}} time {{in the past two decades}} to reconstruct for the urban residents work-related social insurance programs. Since the early 1990 s, urban poverty resulting from reforming the state owned enterprises has become a source of social instability. In response to thise, its emphasis shifted to the implementation of a means-tested social assistance benefit, the Minimum Living Standard Scheme (MLSGS). Evolving from a locally initiated program in the early 1990 s, MLSGS is one of the few social programs in China financed alone by government.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new simulative approach {{to assess the}} level of underwater security in civilian harbor installations, {{with the aim of}} bridging the gaps between system specifications and operative performance of anti-intrusion systems. The integration of a geographical information system (GIS), acoustic and magnetic sensor models, with a dynamic simulator makes it possible to simulate the impact of both new sensors and modification in the sensors placement in the <b>overall</b> harbor <b>protection</b> <b>system.</b> With the proposed approach it is possible to model the harbor environment including geographical and environmental information, to set up the surveillance system with underwater acoustic and magnetic sensors and reacquisition vehicles, and to add several types of intruders to estimate, through dynamic simulations, what security level is obtained by the sensors configuration chosen against the selected intruder. The intention is that of hiding the physical aspects of acoustic and magnetic propagation while providing high-level figures of merit (probability to stop the intruder, expected halt distance from the high value asset (HVA), and expect halt time to intercept) capable of a clear representation of the system capability to detect, classify, and stop a menace.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to analyze Building 310 with regards to fire and life safety. Analysis was done both prescriptively and from a {{performance}} based design standpoint. The prescriptive based analysis includes review of the building’s design with regards to egress, fire alarm systems, suppression systems, and structural fire protection. The building was reviewed against current NFPA codes and the International Building Code to examine compliance. The performance-based analysis consists of two different fire scenarios that were examined. The goal was {{to show that the}} building met safety criteria and does not pose undue risk to occupants. This method employs alternate criteria and strategies to prove safety in ways other than the prescriptive based codes. The fire scenarios consist of a fire originating in a small office, and another fire originating in the kitchen of a restaurant area. The building was designed in compliance with all applicable codes, with one exception. A mezzanine located in one of the restaurant areas is under designed and requires another exit. This is shown using both prescriptive codes and performance-based analysis. Other areas of the <b>overall</b> fire <b>protection</b> <b>system</b> of the building are over designed.

40|$|In partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the Degree of Masters of Science in Fire Protection Engineering, a prescriptive and performance-based analysis was performed on a building housing the Center for the Arts. The building was constructed in 1947 in California as an automobile dealership and repair shop under {{the provisions of the}} then-controlling Uniform Building Code. It subsequently underwent several occupancy changes and has since served as a beauty school, gymnastics center, and currently as a performing and visual arts center. Prescriptive analyses were conducted based primarily upon the provisions of the 2010 California Building and Fire Codes, and the 2009 edition of NFPA 101, Life Safety Code. Where required, other NFPA codes such as the 2010 editions of NFPA 13, Automatic Sprinkler Systems Handbook and NFPA 72, National Fire Alarm and Signaling Code were also referenced. The <b>overall</b> fire <b>protection</b> <b>system</b> was divided into subsystems and then examined. Subsystems included those involving safe egress, fire detection and notification, water-based suppression and structural fire protection. Results are provided with respect to each. The performance based analyses focused primarily upon the ability of occupants to safely escape the building after the onset of various fire events. The computer fire model, “Fire Dynamics Simulator”, was used to estimate the available safe egress times of occupants under various fire scenarios.

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of an investigation of the performance of the New Orleans regional flood <b>protection</b> <b>system</b> during and after Hurricane Katrina, which struck the New Orleans region on August 29, 2005. This event resulted in the single most costly catastrophic failure of an engineered system in history. Current damage estimates {{at the time of this}} writing are on the order of $ 100 to $ 200 billion in the greater New Orleans area, and the official death count in New Orleans and southern Louisiana at the time of this writing stands at 1, 293, with an additional 306 deaths in nearby southern Mississippi. An additional approximately 300 people are currently still listed as “missing”; it is expected that some of these missing were temporarily lost in the shuffle of the regional evacuation, but some of these are expected to have been carried out into the swamps and the Gulf of Mexico by the storm’s floodwaters, and some are expected to be recovered in the ongoing sifting through the debris of wrecked homes and businesses, so the current overall regional death count of 1, 599 is expected to continue to rise a bit further. More than 450, 000 people were initially displaced by this catastrophe, and at the time of this writing more than 200, 000 residents of the greater New Orleans metropolitan area continue to be displaced from their homes by the floodwater damages from this storm event. This investigation has targeted three main questions as follow: (1) What happened?, (2) Why?, and (3) What types of changes are necessary to prevent recurrence of a disaster of this scale again in the future? To address these questions, this investigation has involved: (1) an initial field reconnaissance, forensic study and data gathering effort performed quickly after the arrival of Hurricanes Katrina (August 29, 2005) and Rita (September 24, 2005), (2) a review of the history of the regional flood <b>protection</b> <b>system</b> and its development, (3) a review of the challenging regional geology, (4) detailed studies of the events during Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, as well as the causes and mechanisms of the principal failures, (4) studies of the organizational and institutional issues affecting the performance of the flood <b>protection</b> <b>system,</b> (5) observations regarding the emergency repair and ongoing interim levee reconstruction efforts, and (6) development of findings and preliminary recommendations regarding changes that appear warranted in order to prevent recurrence of this type of catastrophe in the future. In the end, it is concluded that many things went wrong with the New Orleans flood <b>protection</b> <b>system</b> during Hurricane Katrina, and that the resulting catastrophe had it roots in three main causes: (1) a major natural disaster (the Hurricane itself), (2) the poor performance of the flood <b>protection</b> <b>system,</b> due to localized engineering failures, questionable judgments, errors, etc. involved in the detailed design, construction, operation and maintenance of the system, and (3) more global “organizational” and institutional problems associated with the governmental and local organizations responsible for the design, construction, operation, maintenance and funding of the <b>overall</b> flood <b>protection</b> <b>system...</b>|$|R
40|$|Highway {{construction}} has accelerated urban growth and induced {{direct and indirect}} changes to land use. Although many studies have analyzed the relationship between highway construction and local development, relatively less {{attention has been paid}} to clarifying the various impacts of highways associated with farmland loss. This paper integrates GIS spatial analysis, remote sensing, buffer analysis and landscape metrics to analyze the landscape pattern change induced by direct and indirect highway impacts. This paper explores the interaction between the impact of highways and farmland loss, using the case of the highly urbanized traffic hubs in eastern China, Hang-Jia-Hu Plain. Our results demonstrate that the Hang-Jia-Hu Plain experienced extensive highway construction during 1990 – 2010, with a clear acceleration of expressway development since 2000. This unprecedented highway {{construction has}} directly fragmented the regional landscape and indirectly disturbed the regional landscape by attracting a large amount of built-up land transition from farmland during the last two decades. In the highway-effect zone, serious farmland loss initially occurred in the urban region and then spread to the rural region. Moreover, we found the discontinuous expansion of built-up land scattered the farmland in the rural region and expressway-effect zone. Furthermore, farmland protection policies in the 1990 s had the effect of controlling the total area of farmland loss. However, the cohesive farmland structure was still fragmented by the direct and indirect impacts of highway construction. We suggest that an <b>overall</b> farmland <b>protection</b> <b>system</b> should be established to enhance spatial control and mitigate the adverse impacts caused by highway construction. This work improves the understanding of regional sustainable development, and provides a scientific basis for balanced urban development with farmland protection in decision-making processes...|$|R

40|$|Species {{belonging}} to the Culicoides complexes (Diptera, Ceratopogonidae), obsoletus and pulicaris, in Switzerland, are potential vectors of both bluetongue virus (BTV) and African horse sickness virus (AHSV). The epidemic of BTV in 2006 and 2007 in Europe has highlighted the risk of introduction and spread of vector-borne diseases in previously non-endemic areas. As a measure of prevention, {{as part of an}} integrated control programme {{in the event of an}} outbreak of African horse sickness (AHS), it is of utmost importance to prevent, or substantially reduce, contact between horses and Culicoides. The aim of the present study was to compare the effect of three <b>protection</b> <b>systems,</b> net, fan, repellent, or combinations thereof, with regard to their potential to reduce contact between horses and Culicoides. Three different equine housing systems, including individual boxes (BX), group housing systems (GR), and individual boxes with permanently accessible paddock (BP) were used. The efficacy of the <b>protection</b> <b>systems</b> were evaluated by comparing the total number counts of collected female Culicoides, of non-blood-fed and blood-fed Culicoides, respectively, with UV black light traps. The study was conducted over 3 summer months during 2012 and 2013 each and focused on the efficacy and practicality of the <b>protection</b> <b>systems.</b> The repellent was tested in 2012 only and not further investigated in 2013, as it showed no significant effect in reducing Culicoides collected in the light traps.
