50|$|The {{celebrations}} {{centered in}} the Pari√°n, a market {{in the city of}} Aguascalientes, until 1848. In 1842 the <b>outside</b> <b>balustrade</b> of San Marcos Park was built in a plot of land donated by the Catholic Church. The balustrade is of Neoclassical style and is still preserved to this day. Once San Marcos Park was completed the date of celebration was changed to April to coincide with the festivities in honor the patron saint San Marcos.|$|E

50|$|The Royal Naval Division Memorial is {{an outdoor}} war {{memorial}} {{located in the}} northwest corner of Horse Guards Parade in London, United Kingdom. It stands on a corner of the <b>balustrade</b> <b>outside</b> the Old Admiralty Building, and commemorates the 45,000 members of the 63rd (Royal Naval) Division who died during the First World War.|$|R
50|$|Outside each {{colonnade}} is a Memorial Garden. In {{the centre}} of each is a long rectangular Pool of Remembrance containing three fountains. The pool is surrounded by flat copings in Portland stone, and at the colonnade {{end of the pool}} is a low curved parapet with a spout {{in the form of a}} lion's head. The pool is flanked by lawns, <b>outside</b> which is <b>balustrading</b> in Portland stone.|$|R
25|$|In his {{personal}} practice, Dyson continued {{to develop a}} grammar of curvilinear and angular forms. Notable arc based forms included the Casey residence (1996) whose one-story lines reflect {{the crest of a}} rise overlooking the Pacific Ocean in La Selva Beach, California, and the compact combination of a live-work building in the Hall residence project (1993) for a commercial street corner near the ocean in Cayucos, California, in which vertical curves counterpoint horizontal angular elements in the massing. Three houses are examples of continuity with the grammar of angular composition. The small, economically stringent Peretti residence (1991) in rural Clayton, California, used a deck extension with open cable <b>balustrade</b> <b>outside</b> to increase the sense of interior space. Perched on a ridge overlooking the Straight River, the larger Rietz residence (1991) in Owatonna, Minnesota, reflected a strong client affinity for straight geometric lines. The Woods residence (1996) in Coarsegold, California, used angular prows of copper sheathed wood reach to reach upward, joining views in the rooms to the horizon through windows, clerestories and skylights.|$|R
