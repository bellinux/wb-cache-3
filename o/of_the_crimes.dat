5|$|Pre-Trial Chamber II {{ruled that}} there were {{reasonable}} grounds to be believe that William Ruto and Henry Kosgey were criminally responsible as indirect co-perpetrators <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crimes</b> outlined in counts 1, 2 and 4, {{but in the case}} of Joshua Sang it ruled that his involvement was not essential to the commission <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crimes</b> and so only ruled {{that there were}} grounds to believe he otherwise contributed to the crimes. The Chamber rejected the request by the Prosecutor to include the charge of torture in count 3. In the case of Kenyatta, Muthaura and Ali the Chamber ruled that there were reasonable grounds to believe that Uhuru Kenyatta and Francis Muthaura were guilty as indirect co-perpetrators <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crimes</b> of which they were accused {{but in the case of}} Mohammed Ali, the Chamber ruled that his contribution was not essential to the commission <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crimes</b> and so he was charged with having otherwise contributed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This {{paper is}} a result of a {{critical}} consideration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>of</b> robbery as defined in South African law. The historical origin and development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> was investigated. <b>The</b> development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>of</b> robbery in South African law and the current law relating to robbery were researched. Sentencing for <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>of</b> robbery in South African law is discussed and relevant aspects relating to criminal procedure were identified. <b>The</b> constitutionality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> was also analysed. <b>The</b> <b>crime</b> <b>of</b> robbery as defined in <b>the</b> jurisdictions <b>of</b> England, Canada and Germany were subsequently considered on a legal-comparative basis. The study demonstrates that <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>of</b> robbery still warrants a separate existence in South African law. However, certain problem areas relating to <b>the</b> ambit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> are identified. One of these problem areas is so-called “bag-snatching ” where South African courts have applied <b>the</b> elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> arbitrarily, resulting in legal uncertainty. The conclusion reached is that the law relating to robbery is in need <b>of</b> reform. <b>The</b> <b>crime</b> situation in South Africa today, and the increase in violent crime, including robbery, make <b>the</b> broadening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ambit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> common-law <b>crime</b> advisable. Various such proposals are made including <b>the</b> introduction <b>of</b> legislation which broadens <b>the</b> ambit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> common-law <b>crime.</b> A scale on which <b>the</b> various manifestations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> offence are rated according to their severity, is suggested to provide guidance to courts when sentencing those found guilty of robbery. In conclusion, draft legislation which delineates the offence in its various manifestations is proposed...|$|R

5|$|As {{an escaped}} POW, Pechersky was conscripted into a special penal battalions, {{conforming}} to Stalin's Order No. 270 {{and was sent}} to the front to fight German forces in some of the toughest engagements of the war. Pechersky's battalion commander, Major Andreev, was so shocked by his description of Sobibor that he permitted Pechersky to go to Moscow and speak to the Commission of Inquiry <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Crimes</b> of Fascist-German Aggressors and their Accomplices. The Commission listened to Pechersky and published the report Uprising in Sobibor based on his testimony. This report was included in the Black Book, one of the first comprehensive compilations about the Holocaust, written by Vasily Grossman and Ilya Ehrenburg.|$|E

As his father taught at their home, Soeman began learning to read the Quran at a young age. Meanwhile, from the traders who visited Wahid, he also heard stories <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crimes</b> committed in major cities such as Singapore. In 1913 Soeman enrolled at a local Malay school, where his teachers reinforced the importance of reading. Soeman took this lesson to heart, reading numerous books by European and Malay authors from the school library before he graduated in 1918.|$|E
5|$|Kirchner {{also changed}} the {{extradition}} policy, allowing extradition for people prosecuted abroad and not facing charges in Argentina. He also supported the requests by {{human rights organizations}} to turn the former detention centers into memorials for the disappeared. Argentina became a signatory of the UN Convention on the Non-Applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity in 2003. A creative interpretation of the convention by the courts allowed them to circumvent the statutory limitations to crimes committed decades in the past, and also the ex post facto applicability of laws that were not in force at the time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crimes.</b>|$|E
5|$|Section 8 was amended in 1820, 1835, and 1846 and codified in five {{sections}} of the Revised Statutes. Further, § 8 was supplemented by additional prohibitions in § 5 of an 1819 act and § 3 of an 1820 act. Despite the similarity of the provisions, all three were all separately codified in the Revised Statutes in 1874. Section 8 was repealed by the Criminal Code of 1909. Section 8's venue provision was re-enacted by § 14 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Crimes</b> Act of 1825, with minor changes.|$|E

5|$|As {{historian}} Dariusz Stola notes, the anti-Jewish campaign combined century-old conspiracy theories, recycled antisemitic {{claims and}} classic communist propaganda. Regarding the tailoring of the Żydokomuna sentiment to communist Poland, Stola suggested: Paradoxically, {{probably the most}} powerful slogan of the communist propaganda in March was the accusation that the Jews were zealous communists. They were blamed for a major part, if not all, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crimes</b> and horrors of the Stalinist period. The myth of Judeo-Bolshevism had been well known in Poland since the Russian revolution and the Polish-Bolshevik war of 1920, yet its 1968 model deserves interest {{as a tool of}} communist propaganda. This accusation exploited and developed the popular stereotype of Jewish communism to purify communism: the Jews were the dark side of communism; what was wrong in communism was due to them.|$|E
