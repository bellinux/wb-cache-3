40|$|A {{rule-based}} {{expert system}} has been developed in which the knowledge used to assist Hazard and Operability Study is divided into process-specific and process-general components. The process-specific knowledge, which consists of process operation data and the process flow sheet, has been constructed using a HYSIS process simulator. The process-general knowledge which consists of rule-based expert system is developed from simulation result obtained from HYSIS process simulator. The link between Hazard and Operability Study result documentation with data base of process operation is important, in order to analyse the causes and consequences of the whole process deviation on fractionation column. In this Hazard and Operability Study, process deviation studied are flow rate, temperature and pressure. An inference engine mechanism is developed using Visual Basic programming language, for appropriate interaction between these components {{in order to identify}} causes and consequences of deviation for each process stream. The base case study used is a fractionation column of an <b>oleochemical</b> <b>plant.</b> The study has contributed to an improvement of hazard identification technique and proposed an algorithm by considering the whole consequences of process deviation in each stream. The algorithm is found applicable for any of process system, however the expert system developed is only limited to the application for fractionation column of oleo chemical plant...|$|E

50|$|Southeast Asian countries' rapid {{production}} {{growth of}} palm oil and {{palm kernel oil}} in the 1980s spurred the oleochemical industry in Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand. Many <b>oleochemical</b> <b>plants</b> were built. Though a nascent and small industry when pitted against big detergent giants in the US and Europe, oleochemical companies in southeast Asia had competitive edge in cheap ingredients. The US fatty chemical industry {{found it difficult to}} consistently maintain acceptable levels of profits. Competition was intense with market shares divided among many companies there where neither imports nor exports played a significant role. By the late 1990s, giants like Henkel, Unilever, and Petrofina sold their oleochemical factories to focus on higher profit activities like retail of consumer goods. Since the Europe outbreak of 'mad cow disease' or (bovine spongiform encephalopathy) in 2000, tallow is replaced for many uses by vegetable oleic fatty acids, such as palm kernel and coconut oils.|$|R
40|$|IOI Corporation, or {{commonly}} referred to as IOI, is one of Malaysia's home grown business conglomerates which started off from humble beginnings in industrial gas manufacturing. Today IOI Group is a global organization with over 150, 000 hectares of plantations where 98 % are planted with oil palm; 12 palm oil mills across Malaysia; three CPO refineries with total capacity of 1. 8 million MT/yr located in Peninsular and East Malaysia, and Rotterdam in the Netherlands; the largest <b>oleochemical</b> <b>plants</b> in Asia; and specialty fats plants across the world in the Netherlands, the United States, Egypt, Canada, and Malaysia (source: IOI Annual Report 2009). The Group’s plantation business strong growth in a short span of 24 years since 1983 was achieved through acquisitions and distinctive plantation management practices which emphasizes on continuous improvements in yields and cost efficiencies. As {{a major player in the}} oil palm industry, which is the third biggest contributor to the Malaysian economy (,Economic Report 2007 / 2008), IOI corporation faces many challenges to sustain its competitiveness. What strategic moves must IOI take to remain tops in this oil palm industry? This paper seeks to provide a perspective on how IOI Corporation can sustain its competitiveness by undertaking a SWOT Analysis the corporation. A diagnosis of the corporation is made after the SWOT analysisCompetitiveness, SWOT Anlaysis, Oil palm industry, Case study...|$|R
30|$|Oleo{{chemicals}} are chemicals {{obtained from}} plants and animals. They {{have found a}} wide range of domestic and industrial applications, which includes use as cosmetics, fuels, cleaners, lubricants, bioplastics, surfactants, and surface coatings. <b>Oleochemicals</b> synthesized from <b>plant</b> seed oil have the possibility of containing heteroatoms and or π-electrons in their structures, which presents them as potential inhibitors for corrosion control. They are possible replacements for petroleum-based chemicals, are eco-friendly, are biodegradable, and are from a renewable source. Therefore, the search for lesser-known or underutilized <b>plant</b> oil for <b>oleochemical</b> production has been of interest. Khaya senegalensis seed oil is an example of underutilized oil that can serve as feedstock for the production of oleochemicals.|$|R
