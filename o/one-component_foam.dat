40|$|<b>One-component</b> <b>foam</b> {{joint sealant}} {{is widely used}} to seal air leaks by homeowners. Various {{chemicals}} can be emitted from a foam joint sealant. The goal {{of this study was}} to develop a glass chamber method to examine the emissions of 4, 42 ̆ 032 -methylenediphenyl diisocyanate (4, 42 ̆ 032 -MDI) and tris(2 -chloroisopropyl) phosphate (TCPP) from foam joint sealants. The concentrations of 4, 42 ̆ 032 -MDI and TCPP were measured during a 24 -h chamber test that involved a 3 -L chamber operated at 400 C, 20...|$|E
40|$|The sol-gel {{microencapsulation}} of aqueous glycerol in silica-based microspheres affords functional {{materials that}} can be used to cure <b>one-component</b> polyurethane <b>foams</b> (OCF) formulations affording better and greener foam formation. These findings are important and may open the route to more sustainable materials, such as foams, coatings, adhesives, sealants that are widely utilized in many industrial sectors...|$|R
30|$|Silica-based {{microspheres}} encapsulating aqueous glycerol {{are promising}} curing agents affording {{the formation of}} better <b>one-component</b> polyurethane <b>foams,</b> namely thermoset polymers cured by atmospheric moisture that are widely and increasingly utilized in the construction industry. The use of renewable, non toxic glycerol from biodiesel and oleochemicals industry to cure PU foams in place of traditionally employed oil-derived mono and diethylene glycols is both technically and environmentally beneficial. The higher amount of hydroxyl groups in glycerol compared to both mono- and diethylene glycol results in considerably lower percentage of free monomeric methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) and higher crosslinking density of the cured foam.|$|R
40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} the issue of PUR foams for the construction of masonry structures with integrated thermal insulation layer. The main emphasis of the work focuses {{on the use of the}} <b>one-component</b> PUR <b>foam</b> for filling high-volume bulk ceramic masonry blocks. In the practical part of the bachelor thesis there is further described manufacture of test specimens of selected PUR foams and tests that were performed on samples. The aim of the bachelor thesis was selecting of PUR foam that is the best suited as an integrated thermal insulation in masonry structures. In conclusion there is the evaluation of tests, the comparison of test results and the recommendation of appropriate PUR foam...|$|R
