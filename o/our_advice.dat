The Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone had written to the FA, expressing his concern about the possible travel chaos and urging to be kept briefed on the arrangements. Train tickets were sold out since the semi-final round, despite the addition of services to accommodate 7,000 extra passengers. Both clubs laid on six planes to take its supporters directly to Cardiff at £135 each. Although the M4 was busy {{on the day of the}} final, there was little traffic with no major delays.

500|$|Unionist backbenchers {{had long}} been restive as Lloyd George granted the Liberals in the Coalition more than their {{proportionate}} share of offices. In October 1922, discontent among Unionists against the Lloyd George Coalition Government erupted. When Unionist MPs were summoned to the Carlton Club for a meeting to receive their instructions for the forthcoming election, which, as in 1918 was to be fought in coalition with the Lloyd George Liberals, they instead rebelled and voted to fight the election as a single party. Lloyd George resigned as Prime Minister. Most Unionist leaders, including Austen Chamberlain, had supported the Coalition and advocated its continuation. They resigned from their government and party offices, with Austen Chamberlain writing, [...] "The meeting today rejected <b>our</b> <b>advice.</b> Other men who have given other counsels must inherit our burden". Bonar Law was recalled from retirement to lead the Unionists as Prime Minister. Neville Chamberlain was in Canada {{at the time of}} the meeting and so was not forced to choose between supporting his brother's leadership and bringing down a man he despised.|$|E

500|$|On May 10, a {{teenager}} {{who went to}} the protests in front of the Queen Victoria Street Church of Scientology in London was issued a court summons after being asked to take down a sign that read [...] "Scientology is not a religion, it is a dangerous cult". Posting anonymously on a forum, the teenager stated [...] "Within five minutes of arriving ... I was told {{by a member of the}} police that I was not allowed to use 'that word'". He said that the police told him he had 15 minutes to take down the sign. The teenager did not, citing a 1984 high Court ruling by Mr Justice Latey in which he described the Church of Scientology as a [...] "cult" [...] that was [...] "corrupt, sinister and dangerous". The sign was then confiscated. Shami Chakrabarti, the director of Liberty, a human rights group, said that, [...] "They will be banning words like 'war' and 'tax' from placards and demonstrations next. This is just barmy". On May 23, 2008, the legal action against the boy was dropped. A Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) spokesman said: [...] "In consultation with the City of London Police, we were asked whether the sign was abusive or insulting. <b>Our</b> <b>advice</b> is that it is not abusive or insulting and there is no offensiveness (as opposed to criticism), neither in the idea expressed nor in the mode of expression."

40|$|Purpose. To {{describe}} {{a case of}} Valsalva-related subretinal hemorrhage as a presenting symptom of polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV). The patient refrained from treatment against <b>our</b> best <b>advice,</b> and thus {{this is also a}} rare case of the natural course of an untreated PCV. Methods. Case report. Results. A 66 -year-old female with a respiratory infection coughed intensely until exhaustion, after which she developed visual symptoms on the right eye. Primary care ophthalmologist examined the patient on the same day of the onset of symptoms and referred her to our tertiary medical retinal service for detailed retinal diagnosis including fluorescein and indocyanine green angiography. The right eye had a large subretinal hemorrhage and pigment epithelium detachment in the lower temporal arcade with foveal involvement. Against <b>our</b> best <b>advice,</b> the patient refused treatment. In the following 9 months, the BCVA decreased from 68 to 55 ETDRS letters, the subretinal hemorrhage almost regressed, pigment epithelium detachments persisted, and macular edema, intraretinal cysts, and subretinal fibrosis developed. Conclusions. Although classic Valsalva retinopathy with preretinal hemorrhage in most cases can be managed by careful observation and no treatment, this case demonstrates that Valsalva-related subretinal hemorrhage needs different attention and approach...|$|R
