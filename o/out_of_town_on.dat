5|$|M-211 is a two-lane {{highway that}} starts at M-68 in {{downtown}} Onaway. The trunkline runs north <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>town</b> <b>on</b> Main Street past business and residences. It crosses the North Eastern State Trail and passes the Leo E. Getz County Airport north of town. M-211 enters {{an area of}} farmland north of the airport. As it continues north and approaches Onaway State Park, the terrain transitions to forest land. M-211 ends at the intersection with Bonz Beach Highway {{in front of the}} state park gate. All of M-211 is undivided highway.|$|E
5|$|M-33 follows Morenci Avenue {{into the}} center of Mio where the highway joins M-72 south of Mio Pond, and they run {{concurrently}} together across the Mio Pond section of the Au Sable River <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>town.</b> <b>On</b> {{the north side of the}} river, F-32 merges in from the east and the three roadway designations run concurrently north. The highway continues to a sweeping 90° turn east near Smith Lake. F-32 separates to turn west and M-33/M-72 turns eastward. The trunkline continues to Fairview where M-33 turns north, leaving the M-72 concurrency to continue northward. M-33 crosses into the Mackinaw State Forest and passes through Comins. North of that unincorporated community, the highway curves northeast, east and back north to cross into Montmorency County. Before reaching M-32, M-33 crosses the Thunder Bay River. After the river, M-33 turns westward along M-32 to the community of Atlanta. The highway passes near the Atlanta Municipal Airport as it enters the community. In the middle of town, M-33 turns back north. The highway provides access to the Clear Lake State Park in northern Montmorency County before crossing into Presque Isle County.|$|E
5|$|M-86 {{begins in}} Three Rivers at a {{junction}} with Bus. US131 and M-60. From there the road travels south <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>town</b> <b>on</b> Main Street {{and across the}} St. Joseph River. After crossing the river, the highway runs through a residential area of town and turns eastward into rural farm lands. M-86 crosses the Prairie River and follows Burr Oak Street into the community of Centreville. The highway switches to follow Main Street through downtown Centreville; east of downtown, Main Street curves along {{a bend in the}} river, and it runs parallel to the river out of town. As part of its support of the state highway system, the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) tracks the traffic levels along the roads it maintains. These traffic counts are expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT), a calculation of the vehicles using a segment of roadway on a typical day of the year. In 2009, MDOT measured 7,642vehicles including 138trucks along M-86 in Centreville, the highest traffic levels along the whole highway. As the highway leaves town, it passes by the north side of Lake Templene, and Sand Lake near Nottawa before meeting M-66.|$|E

5|$|Near Albany Harbor, M-134 follows Scenic Road to an {{intersection}} with M-48. The main {{route of the}} Lake Michigan Circle Tour turns north on M-48 while a locally designed loop route continues east on M-134 along Lake Huron. The highway continues past De Tour State Park and St. Vital Point before heading northeasterly to De Tour Village. In {{the middle of the}} village, M-134 runs north on Ontario Street and turns east along Elizabeth Street to connect to the ferry docks; the loop tour continues north <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>town</b> <b>on</b> county roads. The highway uses the ferry, run by the regional public transportation agency, to cross the De Tour Passage. Once on Drummond Island, M-134 follows Channel Road northward along the passage before turning eastward. The trunkline cuts across to run along Sturgeon Bay on the north shore of the island. On {{the east side of the}} bay, M-134 turns inland and runs east to the Four Corners, south of the unincorporated community of Drummond. The trunkline terminates at that intersection south of the Drummond Island Airport where Channel, Townline, Johnswood, and Shore roads (west, north, east and south respectively) come together. M-134 is one of three state highways in Michigan located on an island; the two other state highways located on islands are M-185 on Mackinac Island and M-154 on Harsens Island.|$|E

25|$|According to {{the social}} mores {{represented}} in the show, a happy marriage {{is the cornerstone of}} successful middle-class family life, and June and Ward represent the warm, happily married, successful middle class couple. In contrast, the parents of Beaver's friend Larry Mondello are a husband frequently <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>town</b> <b>on</b> business and an exasperated wife struggling single-handedly to raise a son and sometimes depending on Ward to help discipline him. Singles like prim Aunt Martha and globe-trotting, yarn-spinning Uncle Billy are shown as either out-of-touch and irksome or untrustworthy. The one episode dealing with divorce shows it as having negative effects on children and family life.|$|E

25|$|Shen Teh is {{rewarded for}} her hospitality, as the gods {{take it as}} a sure sign of goodness. They give her money and she buys a humble tobacco shop which they intend as both gift and test: will Shen Teh be able to {{maintain}} her goodness with these newfound means, however slight they may be? If she succeeds, the gods' confidence in humanity would be restored. Though at first Shen Teh seems {{to live up to the}} gods' expectations, her generosity quickly turns her small shop into a messy, overcrowded poorhouse which attracts crime and police supervision. In a sense, Shen Teh quickly fails the test, as she is forced to introduce the invented cousin Shui Ta as overseer and protector of her interests. Shen Teh dons a costume of male clothing, a mask, and a forceful voice to take on the role of Shui Ta. Shui Ta arrives at the shop, coldly explains that his cousin has gone <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>town</b> <b>on</b> a short trip, curtly turns out the hangers-on, and quickly restores order to the shop.|$|E

As the Americans approached, women and children from the Wyandot and Delaware towns were hidden in nearby ravines, while British fur traders packed their goods and hurried <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>town.</b> <b>On</b> June 4, Delawares under Captain Pipe and Wyandots under Dunquat, the [...] "Half King", along with some Mingos, joined forces to oppose the Americans. The size of the combined Delaware, Wyandot, and Mingo force has been estimated at anywhere from 200 to 500. British reinforcements were nearby, but Shawnees from the south were not expected to arrive until the next day. When the American scouts appeared, Pipe's Delawares pursued them, while the Wyandots temporarily held back.|$|E

500|$|On May 10, 1983, Howard Emerson, the {{adviser to}} the journalism class, {{submitted}} page proofs of the May 13 issue of the newspaper to principal Robert Eugene Reynolds for approval, a practice that was customary at the time. Reynolds objected {{to two of the}} stories scheduled to run. One was about teen pregnancy, containing interviews with three students who had been pregnant. The story used false names to keep the girls' identities a secret, but Reynolds was concerned that the students would still be identifiable from the text. He was also concerned that the references to sexual activity and birth control were inappropriate for younger students at the school. The second story was about divorce and featured an interview with a student whose parents were divorced, in which she complained that her father [...] "wasn't spending enough time with my mom, my sister, and I ... was always <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>town</b> <b>on</b> business or out late playing cards with the guys ... always argued about everything".

2500|$|A {{divide between}} two factions erupted {{over how the}} long barracks {{property}} was to be used. [...] Driscoll and others [...] believed it {{was not part of}} the original structure and should be turned into a park. [...] Clara offered to raze the building at her own expense. De Zavala was adamant that the long barracks was part of the original building and where the major part of the battle had occurred. In 1908, De Zavala had a stand-off with authorities inside the structure. By 1911, Governor Oscar Branch Colquitt ordered the long barracks be restored to its original condition as it was in mission days. During the 1912 restoration, workers discovered foundation work that verified De Zavala's instincts that the structure had indeed been an original part of the Alamo. However, Governor Colquitt was eventually unsuccessful in preserving the barracks building and when <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>town</b> <b>on</b> business the Lieutenant Governor William Harding Mayes allowed for the further removal of the structure.
