Our ability to estimate applicability of new technologies and content formats to <b>organizational</b> <b>use</b> has been limited to generic quantitative methods {{at the level of}} technologies and industries and elaborate qualitative methods targeting specific phenomena at the organizational level. In this paper we estimate quantitatively the applicability of MMS, SMS, XHTML, and XML to <b>organizational</b> <b>use</b> based on an analysis of all communication of an organization unit. We enumerate over 700 communication genres using a genre-based information systems planning method, categorise them with taxonomy of communication forms, and summarise the results quantitatively per category. SMS, XHTML, and especially XML seem to match the contemporary communication practices of the organization to a much higher extent than MMS. Affect of changes in organizational communication practices and generality of the results are discussed in the end as well as applicability of the method for other purposes. 1...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} <b>organizational</b> <b>use</b> {{of social}} media. It focuses on developing {{an understanding of}} the ways by which social media are used within formal organizational settings. From the vantage point of this thesis such an understanding can be achieved by looking at tensions and incompatibilities that might potentially exist between social media and organization because of their distinct characteristics. It is argued that the distinct characteristics of social media (e. g. openness, transparency, flexibility, etc.) and organization (e. g., hierarchy, formal relationships, standard procedures, etc.) may engender tensions and incompatibilities that affect the ways of using social media and their potential in organizations. The main premise here is that the possibilities, behaviors and practices afforded by social media are recognizably different in nature from common and established organizational practices, behaviors, norms and routines. Through a structurational understanding of <b>organizational</b> <b>use</b> of social media, influenced by Giddens’ theory of structuration and Orlikowski’s practice lens for studying technology use, this thesis offers the perspective of immiscibility to capture tensions and incompatibilities driven by the distinctive characteristics of social media and organization. It basically offers a way of seeing social media use in organizations as a dynamic, in-practice interplay between social media and organization characteristics. One key argument in this thesis is that the immiscible interplay of social media and organization, produces, at least in transition, ‘a bureaucracy of social media’. Social media, it is argued, are used in ways that are essentially bureaucratic, reflecting and also reinforcing established characteristics of formal organizations through the production and reproduction of structures which are driven by the immiscible interplay. The development of such an understanding was achieved through multiple research studies focusing {{on the use of the}} wiki technology for knowledge collaboration and sharing practices in two large multinational organizations: CCC and IBM. A number of qualitative methods were used in these studies to collect empirical evidence from the two organizations including interviews, field visits, observations and document analysis. The overarching contribution of this thesis centers on offering a unique way of understanding <b>organizational</b> <b>use</b> of social media by putting forward tensions and incompatibilities between social media and organization and also by providing an understanding of how such tensions and incompatibilities affect the potential for change by social media...|$|E

40|$|Although the {{importance}} of an organization’s information technology (IT) human resources is widely acknowledged, especially {{in the arena of}} new technology development, most organizational research has taken a “black box ” approach to the study of IT professionals, treating the IT human resource as a relatively homogeneous community that operates as a fixed department or group within the landscape of the business enterprise.
