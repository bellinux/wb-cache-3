500|$|During production, Benson felt one {{recording}} {{session with}} Lacey Mosley of Flyleaf {{went beyond the}} ordinary {{to the point where}} he left the recording room and told Powell [...] "You have to go out there, and you and her do this because you're coming to God right now in front <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes.</b> You guys handle it". According to Benson, both he and Mosley were moved to tears by the session and Benson felt that something like that does not happen often in a recording studio. In a separate session with Mosley, bassist Tai Anderson said that, after recording the end of the song [...] "Run to You", Mosley said she could not believe she was recording with the band. Concerned that Mosley might have been pressured by her management team into doing the collaboration, Anderson said they told Mosley that she didn't have to do the recording. Mosley assuaged their concerns by telling the band that she was actually excited to be able to perform on their album as the band's music had helped her during a difficult period in her teenage years.|$|E
500|$|The {{production}} team used new technology called a [...] "breakway windshield," [...] {{as well as}} air cannons to eject the stuntwoman, Melissa Stubbs, from the vehicle. Instead of using wires, they used pneumatic rams to push her; cables and pulleys made it similar to a [...] "catapult". The stuntwoman rehearsed with a helmet on, but took it off when the scene {{was ready to be}} shot. She wore a small backpad, a mouthguard, and some kneepads, and used her elbows to break the windshield upon being ejected. Stubbs commented that shooting the scene [...] "all went as planned, and was very anticlimactic" [...] {{because of the lack of}} problems. Anna Torv later called the stunt [...] "one of the most humbling experiences in my life". She elaborated, [...] "I don’t do any of the stuff that’s dangerous... Melissa Stubbs is the fantastic stuntwoman who did that [...] They put a rocket for her in the back of the car, and they had that breakaway glass for the windshield. She has nothing on extra, except maybe elbow pads. Then they shoot her out of this rocket, through the windshield, and she rolls on the ground and lands on her mark. The guy goes in. She's OK. Everybody claps. Then I have to go in, lay in the same position, so they can get a close-up <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> opening. That was kind of humbling." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1948 in an {{apartment}} in Harlem, Ginsberg had an auditory hallucination while reading the poetry of William Blake (later referred to as his [...] "Blake vision"). At first, Ginsberg claimed to have heard the voice of God, but later interpreted the voice as that of Blake himself reading Ah, Sunflower, The Sick Rose, and Little Girl Lost, also described by Ginsberg as [...] "voice of the ancient of days". The experience lasted several days. Ginsberg believed that he had witnessed the interconnectedness of the universe. He looked at lattice-work on the fire escape and realized some hand had crafted that; he then looked {{at the sky and}} intuited that some hand had crafted that also, or rather, that the sky was the hand that crafted itself. He explained that this hallucination was not inspired by drug use, but said he sought to recapture that feeling later with various drugs. Ginsberg stated: [...] "living blue hand itself. [...] Or that God was in front <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> - existence itself was God" [...] and [...] "And it was a sudden awakening into a totally deeper real universe than I'd been existing in." ...|$|E

During this experience, he heard the voice of Elijah Muhammad, the leader of the Nation of Islam. He said in the press conference that Elijah Muhammad [...] "spoke in short cryptic sentences and as he spoke a scroll full of cursive writing rolled down in front <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> but it was a projection of what was being written in my mind.

2500|$|His work is methodical, because [...] "an artwork {{is not an}} act of 'imagination' (...) but of observation, perception, form manipulation." [...] "I {{start with}} shapes, still arbitrary. I put ten shapes on the frame; I {{look at it and}} {{suddenly}} a sort of spark ignites. Then the form appears. Color is secondary, used to accentuate the intensity of the form." [...] Nadir Afonso did not renege on his early expressionist and surrealist works: [...] "An individual initially does not see the true nature of things, he starts by representing the real, because he is convinced therein lies the essence of the artwork. I thought that too. But, as I kept working, the underlying laws of art, which are the laws of geometry, slowly revealed themselves in front <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes.</b> There was no effort on my part, it was just the daily work what led me to that result, guided by intuition." [...] The illustrations in this article are a chronological representation of the evolution of Nadir Afonso's style and thought towards the original geometric alphabet with which he created his artworks, as explained in his books and seen most prominently in his Cities series.|$|E
2500|$|When Schneersohn came to America (he was {{the first}} major Chasidic leader to move {{permanently}} to the United States) two of his chassidim came to him, and said not to start up all the activities in which Lubavitch had engaged in Europe, because [...] "America is different." [...] To avoid disappointment, they advised him not even to try. Schneersohn wrote, [...] "Out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> came boiling tears", and undeterred, the next day he started the first Lubavitcher Yeshiva in America, declaring that [...] "America is no different." [...] From 1940-1945, the Rebbe created a lot of turmoil within the US Jewish community since he refused to work with Rabbi Kalmanowitz and Rabbi Kotler of the VAAD in trying to help rescue more Jews out of Hitler's Europe. Instead, he focused heavily on trying to bring about the coming of the Messia. Also, instead of putting a most of his efforts into rescuing other Jews, he placed inordinate amount of time and energy in saving his books. Historian and head of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Israel and Orthodox Jew Efraim Zuroff asks, [...] "How can one justify expending even a small amount of resources and energies to try and save the rebbe's library {{at a time when the}} rescue of lives should have taken precedence?" [...] One wonders why no one talked about using the funds and political contacts necessary for retrieving the books to save more Jews, but the Lubavitchers never discussed this matter. As Zuroff writes, Lubavitchers [...] "do not consider such a set of priorities controversial or in any way problematic", for the preservation of knowledge and torah learning is one of their highest priorities. In 1949, Schneersohn became a U.S. citizen, with his son-in-law Menachem Mendel assisting to coordinate the event. A special dispensation was arranged wherein the federal judge came to [...] "770" [...] to officiate at Rabbi Yoseph Yitzchak's citizenship proceedings, rather than the Rebbe travel to a courthouse for the proceedings. Uniquely, the event was recorded on color motion film. In 1950, Schneersohn died in his home in Brooklyn and many members, even the next Rebbe Menachem Mendel Schneerson, declared him the Messiah. This caused a lot of problems for the Chabad community just like it would when Menachem Mendel Schneerson died in 1994, and many in the community declared him the Messiah. In 1951, Menachem Mendel Schneerson took over the leadership of Chabad and became the next Rebbe of Chabad. When this happened, many stopped declaring Rebbe Schneersohn the Messiah and focused on building out the community under the new Rebbe Schneerson (note: the confusion on names results from the fact that Rebbe Schneerson was the second cousin and son-in-law of Rebbe Schneersohn).|$|E
