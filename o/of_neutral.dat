5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War I in July 1914, both ships were mobilized to lay a series of minefields, initially to protect Germany's coastlines in the North and Baltic Seas. In August, the two ships laid offensive minefields off the British coast, and Nautilus made a similar attempt in October that was cancelled when radio intercepts indicated British naval forces were present. In June 1915, Albatross {{was transferred to the}} eastern Baltic, where she began to lay offensive minefields. The last of these resulted in the Battle of Åland Islands on 2 July after a group of Russian armored cruisers intercepted Albatross and her escorts. The cruisers badly damaged Albatross, and to prevent her sinking, her captain beached the ship off the coast <b>of</b> <b>neutral</b> Sweden.|$|E

5|$|Epsilon Eridani's K-type {{classification}} {{indicates that}} the spectrum has relatively weak absorption lines from absorption by hydrogen (Balmer lines) but strong lines <b>of</b> <b>neutral</b> atoms and singly ionized calcium (Ca II). The luminosity class V (dwarf) is assigned to stars that are undergoing thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen in their core. For a K-type main-sequence star, this fusion {{is dominated by the}} proton–proton chain reaction, in which a series of reactions effectively combines four hydrogen nuclei to form a helium nucleus. The energy released by fusion is transported outward from the core through radiation, which results in no net motion of the surrounding plasma. Outside of this region, in the envelope, energy is carried to the photosphere by plasma convection, where it then radiates into space.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, {{physicists}} Philip Morrison and Giuseppe Cocconi {{proposed that}} extraterrestrial civilisations might be using radio signals for communication.

The systems were observed at the emission frequency <b>of</b> <b>neutral</b> hydrogen, 1,420MHz (21cm). No signals of intelligent extraterrestrial origin were detected. Drake repeated the experiment in 2010, with the same negative result. Despite this lack of success, Epsilon Eridani made its way into science fiction literature and television shows for many years following news of Drake's initial experiment.|$|E
5|$|Normandy {{faced an}} {{increased}} threat from France, Anjou and Flanders after 1108. Louis VI succeeded to the French throne in 1108 {{and began to}} reassert central royal power. Louis demanded Henry give homage to him and that two disputed castles along the Normandy border be placed into the control <b>of</b> <b>neutral</b> castellans. Henry refused, and Louis responded by mobilising an army. After some arguments, the two kings negotiated a truce and retreated without fighting, leaving the underlying issues unresolved. Fulk V assumed power in Anjou in 1109 and began to rebuild Angevin authority. Fulk also inherited the county of Maine, but refused to recognise Henry as his feudal lord and instead allied himself with Louis. Robert II of Flanders also briefly joined the alliance, {{before his death in}} 1111.|$|E
40|$|Plasma {{generation}} through vapor breakdown during ablation of a Si target by nanosecond KrF laser pulses {{is modeled}} using 0 -dimensional rate equations. Although {{there is some}} previous work on vapor breakdown by microsecond laser pulses, {{there have been no}} attempts made on vapor breakdown by nanosecond laser pulses. This work intends to fill the gap. A kinetic model is developed considering following factors: (1) two temperatures of both electrons and heavy-body particles (ions, neutrals, and excited states <b>of</b> <b>neutrals),</b> (2) absorption mechanisms of laser energy include inverse bremstrahlung (IB) processes and photoionization of excited states, (3) ionization acceleration mechanisms included are electron-impact excitation <b>of</b> ground state <b>neutrals,</b> electron-impact ionization <b>of</b> exited states <b>of</b> <b>neutrals,</b> photoionization <b>of</b> excited states <b>of</b> <b>neutrals,</b> and all necessary reverse processes. The rates of various processes considered are calculated according to the formula given by Zel`dovich and Raizer. The authors use a second order predictor-corrector numerical scheme for iterations of the rate equations. The rate equations are solved for five quantities, namely, densities <b>of</b> electrons, <b>neutrals,</b> and excited states <b>of</b> <b>neutrals,</b> and the temperatures of electrons and heavy-body particles. The total breakdown times (sum of evaporation time and vapor breakdown time) at different energy fluences are then calculated. The results are compared with experimental observations of Si target ablation using a KrF laser. A more detailed description of the model and the results will be published later...|$|R

5|$|The {{eighth and}} last war patrol that U-30 was to {{undertake}} began on 5 August 1940, {{when she left}} Lorient for the North Atlantic. In 26 days, she travelled north of the British Isles, into the North Sea and entered the German port city of Kiel on 30 August 1940. During that time, she sank the Swedish vessel Canton on 9 August and the British steam merchantman Clan Macphee on 16 August 1940. Both of these attacks took place off the west coast <b>of</b> <b>neutral</b> Ireland. After these successes, however, U-30 once again experienced engine trouble {{and was forced to}} end her patrol early, returning to Germany.

5|$|The {{history of}} the Swiss Air Force began in 1914with the {{establishment}} of an ad hoc force consisting of a handful of men in outdated and largely civilian aircraft. It was only in the 1930s that an effective air force was established at great cost, capable of inflicting several embarrassing defeats on the Nazi Luftwaffe in the course of an initially vigorous defence <b>of</b> <b>neutral</b> Swiss airspace. The Swiss Air Force as an autonomous military service was created in October 1936. After World War II it was renamed the Swiss Air Force and Anti-Aircraft Command (Schweizerische Flugwaffe Kommando der Flieger und Fliegerabwehrtruppen) and in 1996became a separate service independent from the Army, under its present name Schweizer Luftwaffe.|$|E
5|$|The {{mission of}} the Swiss Air Force {{historically}} has been to support ground troops (erdkampf) in repelling invasions <b>of</b> <b>neutral</b> Swiss territory, with a secondary mission of defending the sovereignty of Swiss airspace. During World War II this doctrine was severely tested when Switzerland was literally {{caught in the middle}} of an air war and subjected to both attacks and intrusions by aircraft of all combatants. Its inability to prevent such violations of its neutrality led for a period to a complete cessation of air intercepts, followed by a practice of coercing small numbers of intruders to submit to internment.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The sources <b>of</b> <b>neutrals</b> at {{the outer}} {{midplane}} of the plasma are discussed. We find {{that both the}} flux <b>of</b> <b>neutrals</b> escaping the divertor through leaks and ion recycling at main chamber surfaces appear to contribute. The ion flux to the walls {{is larger than the}} flux entering the divertor and comparable to recycling at the divertor plate. The cause of these high wall ion fluxes is an enhancement of cross-field particle transport which gives rise to substantial convective heat transport at higher densities. We have further explored main chamber recycling and impurity transport utilizing a novel divertor ‘bypass’, which connects the outer divertor plenum to the main chamber. We find that leakage <b>of</b> <b>neutrals</b> (fuel and recycling impurities) from the divertor appears to be determined primarily by the conductance through the divertor structure, thus indicating that tight baffling would be desirable in a reactor for fuel and helium ash compression. 1...|$|R

5|$|The {{neutral theory}} of {{molecular}} evolution proposed that most evolutionary changes {{are the result}} of the fixation <b>of</b> <b>neutral</b> mutations by genetic drift. Hence, in this model, most genetic changes in a population {{are the result of}} constant mutation pressure and genetic drift. This form of the neutral theory is now largely abandoned, since {{it does not seem to}} fit the genetic variation seen in nature. However, a more recent and better-supported version of this model is the nearly neutral theory, where a mutation that would be effectively neutral in a small population is not necessarily neutral in a large population. Other alternative theories propose that genetic drift is dwarfed by other stochastic forces in evolution, such as genetic hitchhiking, also known as genetic draft.|$|E
5|$|The weak {{magnetosphere}} around Venus {{means that}} the solar wind is interacting directly with its outer atmosphere. Here, ions of hydrogen and oxygen are being created by the dissociation <b>of</b> <b>neutral</b> molecules from ultraviolet radiation. The solar wind then supplies energy that gives some of these ions sufficient velocity to escape Venus's gravity field. This erosion process results in a steady loss of low-mass hydrogen, helium, and oxygen ions, whereas higher-mass molecules, such as carbon dioxide, {{are more likely to}} be retained. Atmospheric erosion by the solar wind probably led to the loss of most of Venus's water during the first billion years after it formed. The erosion has increased the ratio of higher-mass deuterium to lower-mass hydrogen in the atmosphere 100 times compared to the rest of the solar system.|$|E
5|$|These data clearly {{indicate}} the stability <b>of</b> <b>neutral</b> ferrocene and the cobaltocenium and rhodocenium cations. Rhodocene is ca. 500mV more reducing than cobaltocene, indicating {{that it is}} more readily oxidised and hence less stable. An earlier polarographic investigation of rhodocenium perchlorate at neutral pH showed a cathodic wave peak at −1.53V (versus SCE) at the dropping mercury electrode, corresponding to the formation rhodocene in solution, but the researchers were unable to isolate the neutral product from solution. In the same study, attempts to detect iridocene by exposing iridocenium salts to oxidising conditions were unsuccessful even at elevated pH. These data are consistent with rhodocene being highly unstable and may indicate that iridocene is even more unstable still.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the universe, {{hydrogen}} is mostly {{found in the}} atomic and plasma states, with properties quite {{different from those of}} molecular hydrogen.

5|$|Upon {{going to}} war against France, the British Royal Navy began intercepting ships <b>of</b> <b>neutral</b> {{countries}} bound for French ports. The French imported large amounts of American foodstuffs, and the British hoped to starve the French into defeat by intercepting these shipments. In November 1793 the British government widened the scope of these seizures to include any neutral ships trading with the French West Indies, including those flying the American flag. By the following March, over 250 U.S. merchant ships had been seized and their crews impressed. Americans were outraged, and angry protests erupted in several cities. Many Jeffersonians in Congress demanded a declaration of war, but Congressman James Madison instead called for strong economic retaliation, including an embargo on all trade with Britain. Further inflaming anti-British sentiment in Congress, news arrived while the matter was under debate that the Governor General of British North America, Lord Dorchester, had made an inflammatory speech inciting the Indians in the Northwest Territory against the Americans.|$|E
5|$|During {{her short}} career, U-104 sank one enemy vessel and damaged another {{on her first}} and only war patrol in the North Sea, off the {{northern}} coast of Ireland and Great Britain.
