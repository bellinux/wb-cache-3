25|$|In semi-{{crystalline}} polymers, the crystalline {{regions are}} considered to be gas impermeable. Due to relatively high crystallinity, in combination with the ability of the nanofibers to form a dense network held together by strong inter-fibrillar bonds (high cohesive energy density), {{it has been suggested that}} nanocellulose might act as a barrier material. Although the number of reported <b>oxygen</b> <b>permeability</b> values are limited, reports attribute high oxygen barrier properties to nanocellulose films. One study reported an <b>oxygen</b> <b>permeability</b> of 0.0006 (cm3µm)/(m2daykPa) for a ca. 5µm thin nanocellulose film at 23°C and 0% RH. In a related study, a more than 700-fold decrease in <b>oxygen</b> <b>permeability</b> of a polylactide (PLA) film when a nanocellulose layer was added to the PLA surface was reported.|$|E

40|$|Edible films {{present a}} {{potential}} alternative for replacing plastic films used for packaging in food industry. One {{of the major}} advantages is the environmental appeal of this technology, which produces no packaging waste. Some films made with other edible materials have found commercial applications, and many more are being developed using a myriad of food based components. This paper focuses on some important characteristics of films produced with sodium and calcium caseinates. The effects of caseinate type and concentration, plasticizer concentration and pH were studied. Major parameters investigated were solubility, tensile properties, water vapour and <b>oxygen</b> <b>permeabilities.</b> Caseinate films showed high solubility at pH range 6. 0 - 8. 0 and complete insolubility at pH 3. 0 and 4. 0. Calcium caseinate films had a higher tensile strength and a lower % elongation at break than sodium caseinate films. There was not significant difference in water vapour and <b>oxygen</b> <b>permeabilities</b> between sodium and calcium caseinate films...|$|R

40|$|In {{the first}} part of this study, the {{hydrogen}} and <b>oxygen</b> <b>permeabilities</b> of Nafion were measured. The aim of the second part of this study presented here is to physically characterize the influence of the aqueous phase, the solid phase, and the intermediate phase in Nafion on the macroscopic hydrogen and <b>oxygen</b> <b>permeabilities.</b> Hereto, a resistor network model morphologically representative for Nafion based on structural investigations reported in the literature is presented in which the different phases are described by individual permeabilities. As a result of the simulations, an enlarged permeability of the solid phase in comparison to that of dry Nafion had to be assumed in order to reproduce the measured influence of temperature and relative humidity on the permeability. This increase of the permeability of the solid phase toward greater water uptake was explained by the effect of water as a plasticizer and the resulting softening of the polymeric matrix. On the basis of the identified mechanisms, approaches to reduce the gas permeability of polymer electrolyte membranes are identified and discussed...|$|R

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{characterization}} of gas permeation through Nafion, {{the most commonly used}} polymer electrolyte membrane (PEMs) for low-temperature fuel cells and water electrolyzers. In {{the first part of this}} study, novel modifications of the electrochemical monitoring technique to precisely measure the hydrogen and <b>oxygen</b> <b>permeabilities</b> of Nafion are presented. With these techniques, the gas permeabilities of Nafion were observed to be independent of pressures, which was ascribed to a solely diffusive process. Moreover, the temperature dependence of the hydrogen and <b>oxygen</b> <b>permeabilities</b> through Nafion in the fully hydrated state (where the water content is independent of the temperature) were measured in order to determine the activation energies of the permeation mechanisms. On the basis of the measured influence of temperature and relative humidity on the gas permeabilities of Nafion, the pathways for gas permeation through its aqueous and solid phase are qualitatively discussed. The second part of this study presents a resistor network model to quantitatively correlate the microscopic structure of Nafion and its gas permeabilities...|$|R

In this paper, individual DEChN-F and TOChN-F were prepared and assessed firstly. Moreover, we also processed the DEChN and TOChN with opposite charges into the composite film (DE-TO-ChN-F) by the electric attraction. The further fundamental characterization of DE-TO-ChN-F, as well as DEChN-F and TOChN-F, comprising physical and biological performances, was carried out to seek new potentials of chitin nano-fibers other than the chitosans.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} project has been to evaluate the feasibility of improving the impact properties of polypropylene (PP) /ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer (EVOH) laminar blends by the incorporation of a rubber phase. The impact modifier was poly (ethylene-propylene) rubber (EPR). The study was conducted initially with a batch mixer, and then continued with an extruder. Furthermore, {{it was decided to}} evaluate the improvement in impact toughness of the blends upon addition of a polyethylene (PE) phase. The batch mixing studies showed {{that it is possible to}} bring the impact properties of maleated PP (MAPP) -based blends to the range of those exhibited by MAPP, by incorporation of both EPR and PE. The sequence of addition of EPR and PE is very important. The products obtained exhibited good adhesion at the interface between the dispersed phase and the matrix. The presence of EPR and PE did not affect the final <b>oxygen</b> <b>permeabilities</b> of the blends. The extrusion studies showed that the morphology of the blends, and therefore their final properties, depend on the method of compounding. Different MAPP resins were used as the major phase. The best impact properties were found in the case of addition of the EPR-PE phase in a twin screw extruder. The <b>oxygen</b> <b>permeabilities</b> were disappointing, and appeared to be only slightly influence by compositional or processing parameters. One possible explanation is that moisture might have contaminated the EVOH phase, inhibiting its effectiveness as an oxygen barrier...|$|R
2500|$|The usual {{equipment}} {{includes a}} seal-able metabolic chamber, an oxygen sensor, and devices for data recording, stirring, thermostatisation {{and a way}} to introduce chemicals into the chamber. As described above for whole-animal respirometry the choice of materials is very important. Plastic materials are not suitable for the chamber because of their oxygen storage capacity. When plastic materials are unavoidable (e.g. for o-rings, coatings of stirrers, or stoppers) polymers with a very low <b>oxygen</b> <b>permeability</b> (like PVDF as opposed to e.g. PTFE) may be used. Remaining oxygen diffusion into or out of the chamber materials can be handled by correcting the measured oxygen fluxes for the instrumental oxygen background flux.

2500|$|The {{principal}} {{breakthrough in}} soft lenses {{was made by}} Czech chemists Otto Wichterle and Drahoslav Lím, who published their work [...] "Hydrophilic gels for biological use" [...] in the journal Nature in 1959. In 1965, National Patent Development Corporation (NPDC) bought the American rights to produce the lenses and then sublicensed the rights to Bausch & Lomb, which started to manufacture them in the United States. The Czech scientists' work led to {{the launch of the}} first soft (hydrogel) contact lenses in some countries in the 1960s and the first approval of the Soflens material by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1971. These soft lenses were soon prescribed more often than rigid ones, due to the immediate and much greater comfort (rigid lenses require a period of adaptation before full comfort, if any, is achieved). Polymers from which soft lenses are manufactured improved over the next 25 years, primarily in terms of increasing <b>oxygen</b> <b>permeability,</b> by varying the ingredients. In 1972, British optometrist Rishi Agarwal was the first to suggest disposable soft contact lenses.|$|E
2500|$|A [...] "daily wear" [...] (DW) contact lens is {{designed}} to be worn for one day and removed prior to sleeping. An [...] "extended wear" [...] (EW) contact lens {{is designed}} for continuous overnight wear, typically for up to 6 consecutive nights. Newer materials, such as silicone hydrogels, allow for even longer wear periods of up to 30 consecutive nights; these longer-wear lenses are often referred to as [...] "continuous wear" [...] (CW). EW and CW contact lenses can be worn overnight because of their high <b>oxygen</b> <b>permeability.</b> While awake, the eyes are mostly open, allowing oxygen from the air to dissolve into the tears and pass through the lens to the cornea. While asleep, oxygen is supplied from the blood vessels {{in the back of the}} eyelid. [...] A lens hindering passage of oxygen to the cornea causes corneal hypoxia which can result in serious complications, such as corneal ulcer that, if left untreated, can permanently decrease vision. EW and CW contact lenses typically allow for a transfer of 5–6 times more oxygen than conventional softs, allowing the cornea to remain healthy, even with closed eyelids.|$|E
30|$|Because TOCN {{elements}} form dense {{films with}} plywood-like nanolayered structures [53], not only TOCN self-standing films but also TOCN-coated PLLA and poly(ethylene terephthalate) films have high oxygen-barrier properties under dry conditions [52, 54, 55]. These close-packed structures of TOCN {{elements in the}} layers likely originate from strong electrostatic repulsion between anionically charged TOCN elements, which may work efficiently {{not only in the}} aqueous dispersion state but also during the drying process of water evaporation. However, the low <b>oxygen</b> <b>permeabilities</b> of the TOCN-COONa films and layers remarkably increase with RH due to the hydrophilic nature of TOCN-COONa type structures, {{which is one of the}} shortcomings of TOCN films and layers used as gas-barrier materials [54].|$|R

40|$|Trimethylsilyl (TMS) {{groups were}} {{introduced}} with controlled degree of substitution (DS) onto the phenylene rings of various polysulfones.

Dynamic mechanical analyses of sub-glass-transition relaxation, i. e., 3 ̆b 3 -relaxation behavior, showed that the TMS groups affected the local chain motion.
