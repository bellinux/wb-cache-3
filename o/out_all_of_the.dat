5|$|As {{the storms}} approach, early storms knock out the city's primary power {{generating}} plant, and Benson {{is forced to}} negotiate with Lexer for even more power. Not realizing the devastating nature of the storms coming, London sets out to force Lexer {{to listen to his}} warnings by hacking the system and causing a cascading chain reaction that knocks <b>out</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> power in Chicago. Goodman and his team are unable to warn the citizens that the storms have formed into a category 6 hurricane over the Great Lakes and will hit Chicago head on.|$|E

The competitors were given three weeks to come up with new designs and cost estimates. After diplomatic protests, this was modified slightly; the original bids were kept, but alterations to attempt to conform to the new desired characteristics were allowed.|$|E
5|$|Punk {{then used}} {{the group to}} attack Randy Orton, blaming him for prematurely ending Punk's first World Heavyweight Championship reign in 2008. Punk and The Nexus cost Orton his match with The Miz for the WWE Championship at the Royal Rumble in January 2011. Orton, in turn, responded by taking <b>out</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> New Nexus members by punting them in the head, leaving Punk alone as the sole {{surviving}} member of the group. This led to a WrestleMania XXVII match and a Last Man Standing match at Extreme Rules, both of which Punk lost.|$|E

5|$|Directed acyclic graphs {{may also}} be used as a compact {{representation}} of a collection of sequences. In this type of application, one finds a DAG in which the paths form the given sequences. When many of the sequences share the same subsequences, these shared subsequences can be represented by a shared part of the DAG, allowing the representation to use less space than it would take to list <b>out</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sequences separately. For example, the directed acyclic word graph is a data structure in computer science formed by a directed acyclic graph with a single source and with edges labeled by letters or symbols; the paths from the source to the sinks in this graph represent a set of strings, such as English words. Any set of sequences can be represented as paths in a tree, by forming a tree vertex for every prefix of a sequence and making the parent of one of these vertices represent the sequence with one fewer element; the tree formed in this way for a set of strings is called a trie. A directed acyclic word graph saves space over a trie by allowing paths to diverge and rejoin, so that a set of words with the same possible suffixes can be represented by a single tree vertex.|$|E
5|$|Seventy-four of the 273 {{personnel}} from Evans {{were killed in}} the collision, with the majority of these believed to have been asleep or trapped inside the bow section, which sank within minutes. Melbourne deployed her boats, life rafts, and lifebuoys, before carefully manoeuvring alongside the stern section of Evans, where both ships' crews used mooring lines to lash the ships together. Sailors from Melbourne dived from the flight deck into the water to rescue overboard survivors close to the carrier, while the carrier's boats and helicopters collected those farther <b>out.</b> <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> survivors were located within 12 minutes of the collision and rescued before half an hour had passed, although the search continued for fifteen more hours. After Evans stern was evacuated, it was cast off, while the carrier moved away to avoid damage. The stern did not sink, and was later recovered, stripped of parts, and sunk for target practice.|$|E

They then divided up the US into ten regions that they felt would have roughly equal populations.|$|E

Bethesda released information suggesting that the delay was due to their desire to iron <b>out</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bugs before release as well as test compatibility between DLCs. Operation: Anchorage, along with The Pitt, were released on October 1, 2009, for PS3.|$|E

Michurin was responsible for carrying <b>out</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> engineering and geological researches of the site and found out that a hard subsoil ground lies at a depth of 13–14 meters and above — made grounds penetrated by subterranean waters. With this information, Michurin developed the construction of a stone foundation and connected it with the two-storied building of the Priest's apartments, planned by Rastrelli.|$|E

25|$|Storyboard artist Rebecca Sugar {{noted that}} {{the idea behind this}} episode had been in {{development}} for a long time. Originally, it had been planned to make the episode during the first season because McHale and Ward were actively playing immersive, worldbuilding games.

He messaged both Youn—who, at the time, was in South Korea—and Ward via Facebook to inform the two that he enjoyed the episode so much. Many of the scenes with BMO were inspired by Erik Fountain and Cash's experiences skateboarding. Cash in particular posed <b>out</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moves to make them faithful to real life.|$|E
25|$|After {{the loss}} of Kaiserslautern, the Army of the Moselle withdrew to the Saar while the Army of the Rhine retreated behind the Queich River to Landau.

Möllendorf's offensive quickly {{ground to a halt}} and the Prussians set about building a series of armed camps to hold their newly captured territory. The next action in the theater occurred on 12 and 13 July in the Battle of the Vosges or Schänzel. After this victory, the French recaptured Kaiserslautern on 17 July and moved forward to the Speyerbach again, wiping <b>out</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Coalition's recent gains.|$|E
