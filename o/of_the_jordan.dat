5|$|While the Ottoman Fourth Army {{continued}} to hold the eastern side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jordan</b> Valley, Es Salt, Amman and the Hejaz railway, Chaytor's smaller force was to continue the EEF's occupation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jordan</b> Valley. As soon as possible, Chaytor's Force was to advance northwards to capture the Jisr ed Damieh bridge, which would cut a main line of retreat for the Ottoman Seventh and Eighth Armies. This was also a main line of communication between the two armies west <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jordan</b> River in the Judean Hills with the Fourth Army in the east. The expectation was that, {{the attacks on the}} Eighth Army by the XXI and Desert Mounted Corps, and the start of the Battle of Nablus attacks on the Seventh Army, would force the Fourth Army to withdraw northwards along the Hejaz railway to conform with the withdrawals of the Seventh and Eighth Armies.|$|E

5|$|Chaytor's Force was {{detached}} from the Desert Mounted Corps for independent operations.

5|$|During the 19th century, gray wolves were {{widespread}} {{in many parts}} of the Holy Land east and west <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jordan</b> River. However, they decreased considerably in number between 1964 and 1980, largely because of persecution by farmers. The species was not considered common in northern and central Saudi Arabia during the 19th century, with most early publications involving animals either from southwestern Asir, northern rocky areas bordering Jordan, or areas surrounding Riyadh.|$|E

Fusail. Jericho was shelled again in mid afternoon and at 19:00 the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade began their advance towards Tel sh edh Dhib. Meanwhile, on the eastern bank <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jordan</b> River, the 6th and 7th Light Horse Regiments (2nd Light Horse Brigade, Chaytor's Force) with a company of Patiala Infantry attacked well-defended positions on the Ottoman left flank, but patrols towards Shunet Nimrin and Derbasi were shelled by guns from El Haud.|$|E

5|$|In 1921, the Hashemite emir {{and later}} king, Abdullah I, {{designated}} Amman instead of al-Salt {{to be the}} capital of the newly created state, the Emirate of Transjordan, which became the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in 1950. Its function as {{the capital of the}} country attracted immigrants from different Levantine areas, particularly from al-Salt, a nearby city that had been the largest urban settlement east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jordan</b> River at the time. The early settlers who came from Palestine were overwhelmingly from Nablus, from which many of al-Salt's inhabitants had originated. They were joined by other immigrants from Damascus. Amman later attracted people from {{the southern part of the}} country, particularly Al Karak and Madaba. The city's population was around 10,000 in the 1930s.|$|E
