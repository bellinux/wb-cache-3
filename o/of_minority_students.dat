5|$|Heins {{discusses}} the Supreme Court case Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, a landmark {{on affirmative action}} for minority students in university and college admissions. The case (decided in 1978) upheld affirmative action in the admission <b>of</b> <b>minority</b> <b>students</b> as one of several factors to consider, not the primary one. In the lawsuit, the affirmative-action standards at UC Davis School of Medicine were challenged; the school had a policy of holding 16 out of 100 slots for minorities in the incoming class of students, regardless of qualification. Potential student Allan Bakke, a qualified white applicant, challenged the practice after he {{was rejected by the}} school. In an opinion written by Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr., the court ruled against racial quotas at the school while allowing minority status to remain one of several criteria in the admissions process.|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} decade(s), {{many studies have}} been {{conducted}} on the differences in study success between ethnic <b>minority</b> <b>students</b> and ethnic majority students to identify explanations for the less successful academic careers <b>of</b> ethnic <b>minority</b> <b>students.</b> This dissertation aimed to explain the differences in study success between ethnic majority <b>students</b> and ethnic <b>minority</b> <b>students</b> from the perspective of psychosocial and academic-related skills in relation to academic success. The research reported in this dissertation has highlighted several issues related to the less successful academic careers <b>of</b> ethnic <b>minority</b> <b>students.</b> One important issue is the quality of interaction with faculty and peers as it are the formal interactions with teachers and fellow students that made ethnic <b>minority</b> <b>students</b> feel at home in their educational program. Furthermore, high quality formal relationships, as part {{of the quality of the}} education, prevent ethnic <b>minority</b> <b>students</b> from dropping out from higher education. Next to the learning environment, students’ families also play a role in obtaining study success. More specifically, the less successful academic careers <b>of</b> ethnic <b>minority</b> <b>students</b> can partly be explained by their higher levels of participation in activities with or for their family, and by the less effective family social support they receive in comparison with ethnic majority students. Finally, the results concerning academic-related skills (e. g., time management) do not seem to explain the less successful academic careers <b>of</b> ethnic <b>minority</b> <b>students.</b> These findings yield practical implications for improving the <b>student</b> success <b>of</b> ethnic <b>minority</b> <b>students</b> in particular, such as inviting students’ families to the academic domain and fostering high quality formal relationships with faculty and fellow students. More research is needed to further improve our understanding of the less successful academic performance and study progress <b>of</b> ethnic <b>minority</b> <b>students,</b> to ultimately reach the day that chances for success for both groups of students are the same...|$|R

25|$|There is no {{evidence}} that SAT scores systematically underestimate future performance <b>of</b> <b>minority</b> <b>students.</b> However, the predictive validity of the SAT has been shown to depend on the dominant ethnic and racial composition of the college. Some studies have also shown that African American students under-perform in college relative to their white peers with the same SAT scores; researchers have argued that this is likely because white students tend to benefit from social advantages outside of the educational environment (for example, high parental involvement in their education, inclusion in campus academic activities, positive bias from same-race teachers and peers) which result in better grades.|$|E

40|$|Recruitment <b>of</b> more {{underrepresented}} <b>minority</b> <b>students</b> (black, Hispanic {{and native}} American) to increase racial {{diversity in the}} physician workforce is on the agenda for medical schools around the nation. The benefits of having a racially diverse class are indisputable. Minority physicians {{are more likely to}} provide care to minority, underserved, disadvantaged and low-income populations. Therefore, medical schools would benefit from diversity through utilizing strategies for recruitment <b>of</b> underrepresented <b>minority</b> (URM) <b>students.</b> Numerous recruitment strategies have been employed to increase the number <b>of</b> underrepresented <b>minority</b> <b>students.</b> However, formal collaboration with <b>minority</b> medical <b>student</b> organizations is an underutilized tool in the recruitment process. Many medical schools have informally used <b>minority</b> medical <b>students</b> and members <b>of</b> various <b>minority</b> organizations on campus in the recruitment process, but a formal collaboration which entails a strategic approach on using <b>minority</b> medical <b>student</b> organizations has yet {{to be included in the}} literature. This paper discusses the innovative collaboration between the University of Toledo College of Medicine (UTCOM) chapter of the Student National Medical Association (SNMA) and the college of medicine's admissions office to strategize a recruitment plan to increase the number <b>of</b> underrepresented <b>minority</b> <b>students</b> at the UTCOM. This paper suggests that <b>minority</b> medical <b>student</b> organizations, particularly the SNMA, can be used as a recruiting tool; hence, admissions offices cannot negate the usefulness of having formal involvement <b>of</b> <b>minority</b> medical <b>student</b> organizations as a recruiting tool. This approach may also be applicable to residency programs and other graduate professional fields with a severe shortage of URM students...|$|R

30|$|Although higher {{education}} increasingly gains importance, {{little is known}} about the performance <b>of</b> ethnic <b>minority</b> <b>students</b> in {{higher education}}. The lack of attention is likely related to a small number <b>of</b> <b>students</b> from disadvantaged <b>minority</b> groups in higher education. Correspondingly, survey data used in these studies include a small number <b>of</b> ethnic <b>minority</b> <b>students</b> which is hard to analyze statistically. In the European context, there is little attention to ethnic differences in the degree performance of native and ethnic <b>minority</b> <b>students.</b> In a study on ethnic minorities’ achievement in the UK higher education system, (Leslie 2005) attributes the weaker degree results <b>of</b> ethnic <b>minority</b> <b>students</b> to their lower prior-qualifications and the choice of subjects associated with a low probability of degree achievement.
