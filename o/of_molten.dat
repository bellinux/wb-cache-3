5|$|Although {{there is}} general {{agreement}} that {{the origin of the}} heat as manifested in Io's many volcanoes is tidal heating from the pull of gravity from Jupiter and its moon Europa, the volcanoes are not in the positions predicted with tidal heating. They are shifted 30 to 60 degrees to the east. A study published by Tyler et al. (2015) suggests that this eastern shift may be caused by an ocean <b>of</b> <b>molten</b> rock under the surface. The movement of this magma would generate extra heat through friction due to its viscosity. The study's authors believe that this subsurface ocean is a mixture <b>of</b> <b>molten</b> and solid rock.|$|E

40|$|By {{using the}} X-ray {{transmission}} imaging system, melt flows inside a molten pool were studied during laser welding of aluminum alloy at different welding speeds. Then, {{the correlation between}} temperature gradients along the direction of weld penetration and melt flows in the rear part <b>of</b> a <b>molten</b> pool was analyzed by using a three-dimensional numerical method. And the presented model was verified by experimental results. The corresponding investigation was carried out to further study the correlation between temperature gradient and melt flow behavior <b>of</b> the <b>molten</b> pool in the plate heated by preheating temperature. The results indicated that, in the rear part <b>of</b> the <b>molten</b> pool, the maximum flow velocity was located at the bottom <b>of</b> the <b>molten</b> pool. The melt metal in the rear molten pool caused by different welding speeds had significantly different flow trends. As the welding speed increased, the absorbed intensity on the keyhole front wall also increased {{as well as the}} recoil pressure that could maintain the keyhole opened. Consequently, the increase of the welding speed was more beneficial to improving the stability <b>of</b> the <b>molten</b> pool...|$|R

40|$|Publisher SummaryThis chapter {{deals with}} the {{structure}} <b>of</b> the <b>molten</b> globules <b>of</b> various globular proteins revealed by the recent experimental studies. Recent advances in experimental techniques, including hydrogen-exchange NMR, solution X-ray scattering, and protein engineering, have provided detailed pictures <b>of</b> the <b>molten</b> globules for these proteins. The molten globule state has heterogeneous structures, in which one portion of a molecule is more organized and native-like with the other portions being less organized, although the overall structure satisfies the criteria <b>of</b> the <b>molten</b> globule state (compactness, the presence of secondary structure, {{and the lack of}} rigid tertiary structure). The chapter describes how the molten globule state has been identified as the intermediate of kinetic refolding and discusses the kinetic roles <b>of</b> the <b>molten</b> globule state in protein folding. The chapter also discusses thermodynamic stability and cooperativity <b>of</b> the <b>molten</b> globule state from the viewpoint of the hierarchy of protein folding, in which the molten globule state plays a role as a junction of two levels of the hierarchy. We dedicate this review to the late Prof. Dr. Oleg Borisovich Ptitsyn, who passed away during our preparation of this article...|$|R

The workpiece and the electrode melts forming a pool <b>of</b> <b>molten</b> metal (weld pool) that cools to form a joint. As the weld is laid, the flux coating of the electrode disintegrates, giving off vapors that serve as a shielding gas and providing a layer of slag, both of which protect the weld area from atmospheric contamination.|$|E
5|$|Potassium metal {{was first}} {{isolated}} in 1807 in England by Sir Humphry Davy, who derived it from caustic potash (KOH, potassium hydroxide) by electrolysis <b>of</b> <b>molten</b> KOH with the newly discovered voltaic pile.

Later in the same year, Davy reported extraction of the metal sodium from a mineral derivative (caustic soda, NaOH, or lye) rather than a plant salt, by a similar technique, demonstrating that the elements, and thus the salts, are different. Although the production of potassium and sodium metal should have shown that both are elements, {{it took some time}} before this view was universally accepted.|$|E

40|$|Five mutant α–lactalbumins, {{with one}} or two amino acid substitution(s) in the B helix, were {{engineered}} to examine the relation between the stability <b>of</b> the <b>molten</b> globule state and the hydrophobicity of these amino acids. The mutation sites (Thr 29, Ala 30 and Thr 33) have been chosen on the basis of comparison of the amino acid sequences of goat, bovine and gunea pig α–lactalbumin, in which the guinea pig protein shows a remarkably more stable molten globule than the other proteins. The recombinant proteins were expressed Escherichia coli and then purified and refolded efficiently to produce the active proteins. The stability <b>of</b> the <b>molten</b> globule state <b>of</b> these engineered proteins has been investigated by urea–induced unfolding transition under an acidic condition (pH 2. 0), where the molten globule state is stable in the absence of urea. The results show that the molten globule state is stabilized by the amino acid substitutions which raise the hydrophobicity of the residues, suggesting that the hydrophobic core in a globular protein {{plays an important role in}} the stability <b>of</b> the <b>molten</b> globule state. The change in stabilization free energy <b>of</b> the <b>molten</b> globule state caused by each amino acid substitution has been evaluated, and molecular mechanisms of stabilization <b>of</b> the <b>molten</b> globule state are discussed...|$|R

5|$|The steep-sided, {{symmetrical}} stratovolcanoes in {{the region}} were built by repeated eruptions of thick, slow-moving lava that have commonly flowed only a few kilometres from the vent.

Edziza's stratovolcanoes contain a fine-grained silica-rich volcanic rock called trachyte; they have not erupted for thousands of years, allowing erosion to destroy the original cone, creating craggy ridges and rock outcrops of more resistant materials.|$|E

5|$|These {{are used}} when the casting alloy {{cannot be used}} in hot-chamber machines; these include aluminium, zinc alloys with a large {{composition}} of aluminium, magnesium and copper. The process for these machines start with melting the metal in a separate furnace. Then a precise amount <b>of</b> <b>molten</b> metal is transported to the cold-chamber machine where it is fed into an unheated shot chamber (or injection cylinder). This shot is then driven into the die by a hydraulic or mechanical piston.

5|$|Welding is a {{fabrication}} or sculptural {{process that}} joins materials, usually metals or thermoplastics, by causing fusion, which {{is distinct from}} lower temperature metal-joining techniques such as brazing and soldering, which do not melt the base metal. In addition to melting the base metal, a filler material is typically added to the joint to form a pool <b>of</b> <b>molten</b> material (the weld pool) that cools to form a joint that is usually stronger than the base material. Pressure may also be {{used in conjunction with}} heat, or by itself, to produce a weld. Welding also requires a form of shield to protect the filler metals or melted metals from being contaminated or oxidized.|$|E
5|$|Damage to a German steel {{facility}} {{occurred during}} a DST transition in 1993, when a computer timing system {{linked to a}} radio time synchronization signal allowed molten steel to cool for one hour less than the required duration, resulting in spattering <b>of</b> <b>molten</b> steel when it was poured. Medical devices may generate adverse events that could harm patients, without being obvious to clinicians responsible for care. These problems are compounded when the DST rules themselves change; software developers must test and perhaps modify many programs, and users must install updates and restart applications. Consumers must update devices such as programmable thermostats with the correct DST rules or manually adjust the devices' clocks. A common strategy to resolve these problems in computer systems is to express time using the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) rather than the local time zone. For example, Unix-based computer systems use the UTC-based Unix time internally.|$|E

40|$|The Metal Powder Laser Shaping (MPLS) {{technology}} is a new manufacturing technology based on the theory of Rapid Prototyping. MPLS process is affected by multiple factors, such as {{the power of the}} laser, the scanning speed of the laser, the feeding rate of metal powder, and the temperature <b>of</b> the <b>molten</b> pool. The temperature <b>of</b> the <b>molten</b> pool and the height of laser cladding are two key parameters that reflect the processing condition and affect the quality of the shaped parts.

As a consequence, a promising measurement and control system for MPLS process has been constructed and developed successfully by Shenyang Institute of Automation Chinese Academy of Sciences.

5|$|Earth's {{magnetic}} field, {{also known}} as the geomagnetic field, is the magnetic field that extends from the Earth's interior out into space, where it meets the solar wind, a stream of charged particles emanating from the Sun. Its magnitude at the Earth's surface ranges from 25 to 65microteslas (0.25 to 0.65gauss). Roughly speaking it is the field of a magnetic dipole currently tilted at an angle of about 11 degrees with respect to Earth's rotational axis, as if there were a bar magnet placed at that angle {{at the center of the}} Earth. The North geomagnetic pole, located near Greenland in the northern hemisphere, is actually the south pole of the Earth's magnetic field, and the South geomagnetic pole is the north pole. Unlike a bar magnet, Earth's magnetic field changes over time because it is generated by a geodynamo (in Earth's case, the motion <b>of</b> <b>molten</b> iron alloys in its outer core).|$|E
5|$|GMAW with {{globular}} {{metal transfer}} {{is considered the}} least desirable {{of the three major}} GMAW variations, because of its tendency to produce high heat, a poor weld surface, and spatter. The method was originally developed as a cost efficient way to weld steel using GMAW, because this variation uses carbon dioxide, a less expensive shielding gas than argon. Adding to its economic advantage was its high deposition rate, allowing welding speeds of up to 110mm/s (250in/min). As the weld is made, a ball <b>of</b> <b>molten</b> metal from the electrode tends to build up {{on the end of the}} electrode, often in irregular shapes with a larger diameter than the electrode itself. When the droplet finally detaches either by gravity or short circuiting, it falls to the workpiece, leaving an uneven surface and often causing spatter. As a result of the large molten droplet, the process is generally limited to flat and horizontal welding positions, requires thicker workpieces, and results in a larger weld pool.|$|E

It is rather unreactive (not reacting with the halogens, the alkali metals, or ozone at room temperature, although reactivity increases upon heating) and has the unsymmetrical structure N–N–O (N≡N+O−↔−N=N+=O): above 600°C it dissociates by breaking the weaker N–O bond.|$|E
