40|$|Domestic {{violence}} and its prevention My Master's degree thesis is titled "Domestic {{violence and}} its prevention". <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> my thesis {{is to present}} <b>the</b> domestic <b>violence</b> as an important phenomenon which our society contends with. <b>The</b> domestic <b>violence</b> represents a problem which has an essential influence on its victims, it causes substantial effects on their private live, family relationships and also their health. The thesis is composed of eleven chapters, each of them is subdivided into several subchapters. Opening chapters deal with <b>the</b> criminological aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> domestic <b>violence,</b> subsequent chapters concern the legal matters regarding <b>the</b> domestic <b>violence.</b> Final chapters attend to <b>the</b> prevention <b>of</b> <b>the</b> domestic <b>violence</b> and analyze <b>the</b> occurrence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> domestic <b>violence</b> in <b>the</b> Czech Republic. Chapter One is introductory and raises basic issues connected with <b>the</b> topic <b>of</b> <b>the</b> domestic <b>violence.</b> <b>The</b> chapter is subdivided into eight subchapters which define <b>the</b> term <b>of</b> <b>the</b> domestic <b>violence,</b> name its signs and tokens, distinguish between particular types and varieties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> domestic <b>violence,</b> describe <b>the</b> domestic <b>violence</b> as a dynamic phenomenon and declare <b>the</b> causes <b>of</b> this phenomenon.

In turn the Estonian daily newspapers try to answer the question, what {{to do in order to}} solve the problem? There are differences also in a way, how the newspapers speak about <b>the</b> issue <b>of</b> <b>the</b> school <b>violence.</b> In <b>the</b> Estonian newspapers there is paid more attention to certain cases <b>of</b> <b>the</b> school <b>violence</b> with certain actors.

A 1909 measure sponsored by Kentucky representative Augustus O. Stanley removed a national tax on tobacco, and in 1911, the Supreme Court of the United States found the American Tobacco Company to be in violation of antitrust laws. Each of these events helped raise tobacco prices, pacifying the violent farmers.|$|E

5|$|As the {{national}} commander of Los Zetas, Treviño Morales earned a notorious reputation for intimidating officials and citizens throughout Mexico. The Mexican authorities {{believe that he}} is responsible for a significant part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> in Mexico, including the murder of 72 migrants in 2010 and the massacre of 193 people in 2011. A common torture method of his was known as guiso (stew), in which victims would be dumped into oil barrels, doused with gasoline and burned alive. Following the death of his boss Lazcano Lazcano in October 2012, Treviño Morales became his successor and the top leader of Los Zetas drug cartel amid an internal power struggle within the organization.|$|E
5|$|By 1896, the {{government}} planned to pass policing responsibilities to the provincial authorities and ultimately close the force. With {{the discovery of}} gold in the Klondike, however, the force was redeployed to protect Canada's sovereignty over the region and to manage the influx of prospectors. The mounted police sent volunteers {{to fight in the}} Second Boer War, and in recognition were retitled the Royal North-West Mounted Police in 1904. The plans for closure were abandoned in the face of opposition from regional politicians. Large numbers of the police volunteered for military service during the First World War, {{and the future of the}} badly depleted force was once again in doubt. Towards the end of the war, however, fears grew about a potential Bolshevik conspiracy and the authorities tasked the mounted police to investigate the threat. In the aftermath <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> of the Winnipeg General Strike, {{the government}} decided to amalgamate the force with the Dominion Police, to form the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in 1920.|$|E

The photos led to some postmen working for Royal Mail losing their jobs because they had been seen in the photos and in television coverage, even though they had not been arrested. Michael Doherty, the chairman of the Communication Workers Union, and his brother Tom took Royal Mail to an Employment Tribunal for unfair dismissal claiming they had been acting in self-defence. In 2001, the tribunal ruled in their favour, and ordered Royal Mail to reinstate them. In 2012, the editor of the Daily Mirror at the time, Piers Morgan apologised for printing the pictures.|$|E

Evidence included complaints filed by victims' family members which state that police officials fired bullets and helped the mob, resulting in the killings. It was also alleged that police guided the mob of rioters to residents' hiding places. According to Human Rights Watch, the police did nothing as houses and people were burnt and, on the day <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>violence,</b> did not respond to telephone calls until the massacre ended. Numerous eyewitnesses saw police aiming tear gas shells at, and firing upon, Muslim youths who tried to defend themselves or others. There also have been allegations that police themselves burnt houses and looted. In the violence, the extensive use of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) was reported, which was cited as evidence of the involvement of officials because of easy access to it.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the massacre, {{the town}} of Rosewood had been a quiet, {{primarily}} black, self-sufficient whistle stop on the Seaboard Air Line Railway. Trouble began when white men from several nearby towns lynched a black Rosewood resident because of unsupported accusations that a white woman in nearby Sumner had been beaten and possibly raped by a black drifter. When the town's black citizens rallied together to defend themselves against further attacks, a mob of several hundred whites combed the countryside hunting for black people, and burned almost every structure in Rosewood. Survivors from the town hid for several days in nearby swamps until they were evacuated by train and car to larger towns. Although state and local authorities were aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>violence,</b> no arrests were made for what happened in Rosewood. The town was abandoned by its former black residents; none ever moved back.|$|E

5|$|States' {{militias and}} Federal troops {{attached}} to the Army of the Potomac, including the newly reorganized 11th New York, were dispatched to quell the riots.

In addition, New York governor Horatio Seymour sent the 74th and 65th regiments of the New York state militia, which had not been federalized, and {{a section of the}} 20th Artillery from Fort Schuyler in Throgs Neck. At the height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>violence,</b> Colonel O'Brien, the 11th Regiment's commanding officer, was seized by the mob, beaten, and killed.

40|$|<b>The</b> main {{objective}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thesis was to map possibilities of a co-operation among the intervention centre and other entities interested {{in helping to}} people threatened by <b>the</b> domestic <b>violence.</b> <b>The</b> current status {{was taken from the}} professional literature. There is described an issue <b>of</b> <b>the</b> domestic <b>violence,</b> types and forms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> domestic <b>violence,</b> its characteristics and dynamics, causes, consequences, legal framework <b>of</b> <b>the</b> domestic <b>violence,</b> its actors, entities helping to people threatened by <b>the</b> domestic <b>violence</b> and an interdisciplinary co-operation. The qualitative research was used in the thesis. A tool for the data collection was a semi-standardized interview. Questions were based on theme ranges concerning the examined issue. The research sample consisted of 13 workers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> entities helping to people at risk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> domestic <b>violence</b> in <b>the</b> Highland (Vysočina) region. The research showed that <b>the</b> domestic <b>violence</b> is a very wide-spread and still underestimated issue. At the same time it is seen a considerable progress in <b>the</b> area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> help to people at risk by <b>the</b> domestic <b>violence.</b> Further <b>the</b> research showed that workers do not exactly know services provided by <b>the</b> Intervention Centre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Highland (Vysočina) region. Thanks to this fact there can occur a disinformation of people threatened by <b>the</b> domestic <b>violence.</b> <b>The</b> staff can determine the most often demanded help from <b>the</b> side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> potential service users. They can also recognize that not always it is about the help the intervention centre is able to provide. The research does not confirm that the personnel generally would be influenced by prejudices at their work with people at risk by <b>the</b> domestic <b>violence.</b> But they were certainly also in their professional life influenced by a personal experience with <b>the</b> domestic <b>violence</b> that acquired in their neighbourhood. The research raised a possibility of a co-operation among the intervention centre and other entities, namely organizing case conferences. This thesis can be used in practice for an acquisition or addition of professional experience related to <b>the</b> issue <b>of</b> <b>the</b> domestic <b>violence</b> and available provided services...|$|R
