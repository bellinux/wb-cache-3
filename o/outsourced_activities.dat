50|$|Lots of company's are {{currently}} {{moving away from}} the traditional outsourcing model and towards the multisourcing model because firstly, clients are starting to perform traditionally <b>outsourced</b> <b>activities</b> themselves, especially those that are essential to their business plan or strategy. Clients are also starting to look at suppliers that could provide them with their specific needs, something that wasn't available in the outsourcing process. Companies want services that are tailored to their needs and under the multisourcing process, this need is met. Also, clients are moving away from traditional contracts and engagement models in favour of more flexible alternatives. This setup ensures a more competitive landscape which helps the client's desire to maintain a level of competition between vendors to ensure the quality of service and a competitive price.|$|E

The {{objective}} of the BBBEE {{is to increase the}} participation of Black people and Black women in the South African economy and also to bridge the income inequality which was brought about systematically before South Africa became a democratic country. The BBBEE Act, through the Codes of Good Practice has identified seven key elements which if addressed will help to achieve the objectives of the Act. These elements are ownership, management control, employment equity, skills development, preferential procurement, enterprise development and socio economic development. Minimum targets have been set which need to be achieved within ten years. The primary objective {{of the study was to}} investigate if Sappi one of the two dominant pulp and paper companies in South Africa, could utilize outsourcing as a Black Economic Empowerment Tool. The secondary objectives were twofold: • To identify key barriers to complying with the seven elements of the Codes of Good Practice; and • To establish measures or incentives that will lead to Sappi Forests <b>outsourced</b> <b>activities</b> complying with the Codes of Good Practice hence utilizing <b>outsourced</b> <b>activities</b> as a Black Economic Empowerment tool. The research findings indicate that Sappi could utilize outsourcing as a Black Economic Empowerment tool. According to survey results, significant progress has been achieved in implementing BBBEE Act despite the lack of a systematic approach. Progress towards the implementation of the Act as measured against the seven elements contained in the Codes of Good Practice, is commendable. Should the recommendations such as incentives and rewards that are mentioned in the findings be adopted, the implementation of the BBBEE Act which leads to empowerment could be enhanced in forests <b>outsourced</b> <b>activities...</b>|$|E

Outsourcing must be done carefully, systematically, and with explicit goals and expectations. Sensible reasons to consider outsourcing include both strategic and tactical concerns on both a department and organizational level. A good choice of outsourcing partners was the most useful and contributing factor among successful organizations. Outsourcing partners should be selected based on their expertise in the operation being outsourced and their cultural fit with the organization. Another factor is providing adequate training skills needed to manage <b>outsourcing</b> <b>activities</b> and to negotiate a sound contract. Providing managers with skills that {{will enable them to}} adapt to other cultures and work with other managers may be very important to ensure the success of outsourcing.

40|$|The {{issue of}} {{outsourcing}} {{as a form}} of foreign direct investment (FDI) has been widely discussed in the recent past. In this essay, I analyze what determines the <b>outsourcing</b> <b>activity</b> by looking at U. S. manufacturing industries between 1972 and 2002. I concentrate on correlation between the measure of outsourcing and wages, bargaining coverage contracts, transportation costs, and private gross fixed investment in information technology. My analysis finds differences in the effects of wages on <b>outsourcing</b> <b>activity</b> {{depending on the type of}} industry (i. e., whether the industry produces durable or non-durable goods). The main regression model finds that wages and union coverage cannot fully explain the colossal increase in <b>outsourcing</b> <b>activity</b> in the last three decades. Rather, the primary factors influencing the increase in outsourcing are likely to be the growth in foreign productivity and technological changes that allow more international specialization in the intermediate production stages of the final good. ...|$|R
