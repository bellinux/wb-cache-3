The reserve is a region of sparsely vegetated cinder deposits and lava rock, including areas of aeolian desert and Lake Waiau. This ecosystem is a likely haven for the threatened uau (Pterodroma sandwichensis) and also the center <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>study</b> on wÄ“kiu bugs (Nysius wekiuicola).|$|E

5|$|As a student, Kincaid showed {{exceptional}} {{aptitude for}} the natural sciences and achieved national attention for his scientific achievements. In 1897, while still an undergraduate, he accompanied David Starr Jordan to the Pribilof Islands as part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>study</b> of seals undertaken by the American Fur Seal Commission. Back in Washington, Kincaid's interests focused more on insect life, and a report that year in the Boston Evening Transcript noted that he had discovered 41 new species of bees, including 22 of the genus Osmia. Theodore Dru Alison Cockerell, at the time one of America's leading entomologists, directed {{a portion of the}} sizable Kincaid bee collection to the Smithsonian Institution.|$|E

5|$|As part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>study</b> on adaptation, 57 rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) were {{introduced}} to the island of Desecheo and other southern off-shore islands and cays in 1967. Prior to the introduction, Desecheo was the largest nesting colony of the brown booby, but mainly as a result of egg predation by the introduced macaques, no bird species presently nests in the island. Efforts to trap and remove the species have been unsuccessful and it has expanded its range to southwestern Puerto Rico. Other primates also have established populations in Puerto Rico. As a result of vandalism, 107 squirrel monkeys escaped from a research station at Sabana Seca in the late 1970s. The latest estimate for this population is 35 individuals.|$|E
5|$|Between 1970 and 1975, {{advisories}} for {{systems in}} the eastern Pacific basins were initiated by the Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center (EPHC) {{as part of the}} National Weather Service (NWS) office in San Francisco, California. At that time, the advisories released were written in cooperation with the United States Navy Fleet Weather Center in Alameda and the Air Force Hurricane Liaison Officer at the McClellan Air Force Base. Following the move of the hurricane center to Redwood City in 1976, track files were created and altered by Arthur Pike and were later re-modified following the release <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>study</b> in 1980. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) extended its authority to the EPHC in 1988, and subsequently began maintaining the tracks.|$|E

The report indicated that 204 of 396 fatalities in U.S. jetliner crashes since 1967 had occurred in mid-air collisions. Additionally, near-miss situations involving jetliners occurred on average at least once per day, with the Los Angeles and New York areas noted as being especially high-risk. Finally, the report noted that the current trend in air casualties indicated that a further 528 people would die in mid-air collisions during the following ten years. These figures {{did not include the}} casualties from Flight 706.|$|E

5|$|In October 2008, new {{insights}} into the effect of Internet usage on cognition were gleaned from the results, reported in a press release, <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>study</b> conducted by UCLA's Memory and Aging Research Center that had tested two groups of people between the ages of 55 and 76 years old; only one group of which were experienced web users. While they had read books or performed assigned search tasks their brain activity had been monitored with functional MRI scans, which revealed that both reading and web search utilize the same language, reading, memory, and visual regions of the brain; however, it was discovered that those searching the web stimulated additional decision-making and complex reasoning regions of the brain, with a two-fold increase in these regions in experienced web users compared with inexperienced web users. Gary Small, the director of the UCLA center and lead investigator of the UCLA study, concurrently released the book iBrain: Surviving the Technological Alteration of the Modern Mind, co-authored with Gigi Vorgan, with the press release.|$|E

This feral population is the source for 90% of the captive Cuban iguanas held in private collections and was the source for part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>study</b> on animal communication and evolution conducted by Emilia Martins, a biologist at Indiana University.|$|E
5|$|On 31 October 1992, Pope John Paul II {{expressed}} {{regret for}} how the Galileo affair was handled, and issued a declaration acknowledging the errors committed by the Catholic Church tribunal that judged the scientific positions of Galileo Galilei, as the result <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>study</b> conducted by the Pontifical Council for Culture. In March 2008, {{the head of the}} Pontifical Academy of Sciences, Nicola Cabibbo, announced a plan to honour Galileo by erecting a statue of him inside the Vatican walls. In December of the same year, during events to mark the 400th anniversary of Galileo's earliest telescopic observations, Pope Benedict XVI praised his contributions to astronomy. A month later, however, the head of the Pontifical Council for Culture, Gianfranco Ravasi, revealed that the plan to erect a statue of Galileo in the grounds of the Vatican had been suspended.|$|E
