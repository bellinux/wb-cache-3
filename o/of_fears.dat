40|$|<b>Fear</b> <b>of</b> falling {{has been}} {{reported}} in a high percentage of community-dwelling elderly who both do and don't have a history of falling. The aims of this review are to: (a) elucidate the definition <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> falling; (b) clarify measurements <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> falling based on its definition; and (c) describe the risk factors for <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> falling.

Based on a literature review, major <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> falling measurements involve the evaluation <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> falling and use of a fall efficacy scale. Using a correct definition <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> falling, nurses working close with older adults need to identify the different definitions <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> falling and fall efficacy scale.

40|$|The {{behavioural}} therapies predominantly use {{exposure to}} feared stimuli {{in the treatment}} of anxiety disorders. However, clients frequently experience a return <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> after treatment and this may increase the likelihood of relapse occurring. Return <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> via a renewal effect is the most frequently studied source <b>of</b> return <b>of</b> <b>fear.</b> Renewal <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> occurs when the previously feared object is encountered in a context that is different to the treatment context. The present chapter reviews clinical-analogue studies that have investigated the renewal <b>of</b> <b>fear.</b> Prior research has confirmed the validity of renewal as a mechanism for the renewal <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> in high fearful and phobic individuals. Moreover, prior research has shown that factors such as phobic cognitions and pre-treatment fear can predict the likelihood <b>of</b> renewal <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> occurring. The review also highlights the methodologies used to detect renewal <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> and subsequently reduce renewal. Applications of the research to reduce the return <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> via renewal following exposure therapy are discussed. Griffith Health, School of Applied PsychologyNo Full Tex...|$|R

5|$|HIV is {{typically}} transmitted through unprotected sex or intravenous drug use, {{and is often}} associated with groups such as promiscuous gay men, illicit drug users, and sex workers. For these reasons, and also because <b>of</b> <b>fears</b> of contagion, people living with HIV are frequently subjected to stigma and discrimination. Publicity campaigns around the world have aimed to counter HIV-related prejudices and misconceptions and to replace them with an accurate understanding that helps to prevent new infections.

40|$|In recent years, {{questions}} have been raised regarding the dimensionality of existing measures <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>fear.</b> This is an important issue {{that needs to be addressed}} if the dimensions(s) of any scale purporting to assess <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> are to guide theory and research. One of the most widely used measures <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> comprises a set of two scales: the Agoraphobic Cognitions Questionnaire (ACQ) and the Body Sensations Questionnaire (BSQ). In the present study, the dimensional nature of both measures was empirically examined using a confirmatory approach. It was also determined whether the dimensions are differentially related to a variety of state and trait measures of psychological functioning. The results pointed to multi- rather than unidimensionality <b>of</b> the <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> construct. Correlational and scale-level confirmatory analyses across time-points indicated that (a) <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> dimensions are elements of a replicable higher order Negative Affect/Neuroticism/General Emotionality/Instability component; (b) this superfactor emerges orthogonal to the stable higher order factors of Positive Affect, Phobic Fear (excluding Agoraphobic Fears), and Agoraphobia; and (c) anxiety and fear are distinct phenomena.

40|$|The {{measurement}} <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> {{crime is}} acknowledged as a hot methodological issue. Many {{studies have focused}} on the cognitive and behavioural components <b>of</b> <b>fear.</b> The emotional affective component <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> crime has been studied rather less, however. Traditional measures <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> crime fail to address the complexity of this concept. Knowledge of prevalence, frequency and intensity <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> are largely absent in a quantitative design. Following an alternative question structure, previous research has shown that ‘old’-style questions overestimate the everyday experience <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> (see Farrall, 2004; Farrall and Gadd, 2004; Gray, Jackson and Farrall, 2008). Furthermore, gender differences in <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> crime seem to be influenced by socially desirable answers by men (Sutton and Farrall, 2005). In this paper, we study differences in outcomes when measuring <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> crime using ‘old’-style questions (’avoidance behaviour’) and an alternative question structure introduced by Stephen Farrall (three-part questions treating prevalence, frequency and intensity <b>of</b> <b>fear).</b> We conducted a survey (2008) in eighteen postal code areas and interviewed 750 key informants. Descriptive analyses by gender were conducted for both the traditional avoidance behaviour scale and the alternative question structure that measures the emotional affective component <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> crime. Subsequently some correlational analyses were conducted to examine how different these <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> crime measures are from supposed covariates such as perceived sense of community, perceived disorder and previous victimisation. Furthermore, we assessed the effects of social desirability on measures <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> crime components and on the gender-fear relationship in particular. In short, measuring the emotional affective component <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> with an alternative question structure presents a totally different picture than can be found by measuring the behavioural component <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> crime with a traditional scale such as avoidance behaviour. Second, different measures <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> crime are especially differentially related to previous victimisation. Third, we found rather surprising effects of social desirability on gender differences in <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> crime...|$|R

Because <b>of</b> <b>fears</b> of the indigenous tribes, officials {{found it difficult to}} find settlers in Mexico willing to move into the territory's coastal areas, and therefore continued to allow settlers from the United States into the area with the promise of allegiance to Mexico. Austin's son, Stephen F. Austin, established a colony which extended from east central Texas to Galveston Bay and the Gulf Coast. Some of Austin's original Old 300 settlers, including John Dickson, William Scott, and John Iiams, established homesteads and commercial enterprises around the bay. Texas Historical Association.

Communities including Lynchburg, San Jacinto, and Campbell's Bayou (founded by one of Lafitte's former officers) were gradually established around the bay. In addition to the Anglo-American and Mexican settlers in the area, a Cajun settlement was established along Armand Bayou. The Mexican Colonization Law of 1824, however, forbade the creation of settlements near the coast with the intention of protecting the native tribes in the area. The law was not enforced and settlers continued to encroach upon tribal lands. Native tribes remained in the area years afterward but were gradually driven out as European settlers moved into the region. The Akokisa were driven inland where they merged with the Bidai.

40|$|The return <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> is an {{important}} issue in anxiety disorder research. Each time a fear memory is reactivated, it may further strengthen overactivation <b>of</b> the <b>fear</b> circuit, which may contribute to long-term maintenance <b>of</b> the <b>fear</b> memory. Recent evidence indicates that glucocorticoids may help attenuate pathological fear, but its role in the return <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> is unclear. In the present study, systemic corticosterone (CORT; 25 mg/kg) administration 1 h after fear conditioning did not impair the consolidation process but significantly suppressed the return <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> evoked by a subthreshold conditioning (SC) procedure and elevated platform (EP) stress. Compared with the SC-induced return <b>of</b> <b>fear,</b> acute stress-induced return was state-dependent. In addition, post-training CORT treatment increased the adrenocorticotropic response after EP stress, which indicates that the drug-induced suppression of the return <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> may possibly derive from its regulation effect of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis reactivity to stress. These results suggest that post-training CORT administration may help inhibit the return <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> evoked by EP or SC stress. The possible mechanisms involved in the high-dose CORT-induced suppression of the SC- and EP-induced return <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
