5|$|Body Language is {{the ninth}} studio album by Australian singer Kylie Minogue, {{released}} on 10 November 2003 by Parlophone. Following the massive commercial success of her eighth studio album Fever (2001), Minogue enlisted {{a diverse group}} of writers and producers to aid in creating a new album, including Cathy Dennis, Dan Carey, Emiliana Torrini, Johnny Douglas and Mantronix among others. Influenced by the musical works of the 1980s and artists like Prince and Scritti Politti, Body Language musically differs from Minogue's previous albums, which mainly featured disco-oriented dance-pop tracks, and instead explores genres like synthpop, electroclash, R, and hip hop. Many tracks in Body Language contain references to songs from the 1980s and lyrically, the album touches upon themes <b>of</b> <b>enjoyment,</b> flirting, and sex.|$|E
5|$|Dearly Stars sold 30,786 {{copies in}} its first week of release in Japan, and ranked as the tenth best-selling video game in Japan that week. The game {{received}} a score of 30 out of 40 from the Japanese video game magazine Famitsu. Critics have described Dearly Stars as suitable for beginners to the Idolmaster series for drawing out the series' essence and reorganizing it into a simpler and easier-to-understand form. At the same time, Famitsu reviewer Sekai Sandai Miyokawa thinks that fans of the series will feel from Dearly Stars {{the growth of the}} 765 Pro idols and the overall growth of the series. Reviewers note that despite the change in the game's details compared to previous games in the series, such as the change in perspective from the producer to the idol, Dearly Stars still plays like an Idolmaster game. However, another Famitsu reviewer stated that because other aspects of the gameplay in Dearly Stars are similar to previous Idolmaster games such as doing lessons and auditions, the sense <b>of</b> <b>enjoyment</b> is not that different from other games. A reviewer for Famitsu felt it was easier to empathize with an idol when the story was told from their perspective.|$|E

It was here where he discovered {{what he had been}} missing when the audience cheered for ten minutes after he walked onstage. At the show's end, Como sat in a chair, delightedly chatting back and forth with his equally delighted fans. Perry returned to the United Kingdom in November for a Royal Variety Performance to benefit the Entertainment Artistes' Benevolent Fund with the Queen Mother in attendance. Como was invited to visit Buckingham Palace the day after the show. At first, the invitation did not extend to his associates traveling and working with him, and Como politely declined. When word reached the Palace regarding the reason for Perry's turning down the invitation, it was then extended to include all in the Como party and Como accepted this invitation. Soon after, he announced his first concert tour that began in the UK in the spring of 1975.|$|E

40|$|Administration of {{the same}} Quality <b>of</b> Life <b>Enjoyment</b> and Satisfaction Questionnaire (Q-LES-Q) in major {{depressive}} disorder (MDD) and in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) before and after treatment allowed us to compare quality <b>of</b> life <b>enjoyment</b> and satisfaction in these two disorders and to compare outcome based on symptoms versus functioning. Q-LES-Q and symptom-specific Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) data from eight randomized, 8 -week, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials with escitalopram were used. MDD (n= 1, 140) or GAD (n= 1, 045) patients report a substantial degree of quality <b>of</b> life <b>enjoyment</b> and satisfaction impairment (baseline scores 64 % and 76 % of community norm, respectively). Treatment resulted in statistically and clinically significant improvement in quality <b>of</b> life <b>enjoyment</b> and satisfaction. The improvement was greater in patients treated with escitalopram than with placebo. In MDD, the majority of remitters (MADRS<or= 12) reached 'normal' quality <b>of</b> life <b>enjoyment</b> and satisfaction levels, whereas in GAD, 67 % of remitters (HAMA<or= 7) reached 'normal' quality <b>of</b> life, <b>enjoyment,</b> and satisfaction. A strong correlation between the symptom-specific scales and the Q-LES-Q was observed. These analyses suggest that remission with scores of 6 on the MADRS and 5 on the HAMA correspond with a quality <b>of</b> life <b>enjoyment</b> and satisfaction found in community comparison patients (Q-LES-Q score of 58 +/- 10 %). Treatment with escitalopram results in a significant improvement of quality <b>of</b> life <b>enjoyment</b> and satisfaction in patients with MDD or GAD.

25|$|Donal Nolan {{has argued}} that to {{consider}} Rylands as part of private nuisance is unsound. Private nuisance requires the claimant to {{have an interest in}} land, while Rylands does not; although exceptions to this rule have occasionally been made in private nuisance, in Hunter v Canary Wharf Ltd, the House of Lords ruled that to make exceptions would transform nuisance from a tort against land to a tort against the person, and should not be permitted. John Murphy, Professor of Common Law at the University of Manchester, agrees with Nolan, and makes the additional point that nuisance is focused on a loss <b>of</b> <b>enjoyment</b> to land, not physical damage as Rylands is. It has also been concerned that the reasonable use test, which appears in nuisance, is not 9 to cases brought under Rylands.|$|E

25|$|On 1 February 1991, Ablett, aged 29, stunned most {{football}} fans {{when he announced}} his retirement, citing personal reasons and a loss <b>of</b> <b>enjoyment</b> for the game. His previous season in 1990 was marred by injury, dipping motivation, and personal issues, including a separation from his wife. He was eventually encouraged to reverse his decision and he made his return in Round 12 for the Geelong reserves team. This generated enormous media interest and drew an abnormally large crowd for the curtain raiser game at Princes Park. Ablett was slotted back into the senior side in Round 13. He failed to recapture his best form however and he kicked just 28 goals in 12 appearances. His year ended on a sour note when he was suspended for striking St Kilda rover Nathan Burke {{in the first week}} of the finals and he subsequently missed Geelong's finals defeats to Hawthorn and West Coast.|$|E
25|$|It is {{believed}} that people who commit sins go to Hell {{and have to go}} through punishments in accordance with the sins they committed. The god Yamarāja, who is also the god of death, presides over Hell. Detailed accounts of all the sins committed by an individual are kept by Chitragupta, who is the record keeper in Yama's court. Chitragupta reads out the sins committed and Yama orders appropriate punishments to be given to individuals. These punishments include dipping in boiling oil, burning in fire, torture using various weapons, etc. in various Hells. Individuals who finish their quota of the punishments are reborn in accordance with their balance of karma. All created beings are imperfect and thus have at least one sin to their record; but if one has generally led a pious life, one ascends to svarga, a temporary realm <b>of</b> <b>enjoyment</b> similar to Paradise, after a brief period of expiation in Hell and before the next reincarnation, according to the law of karma.|$|E

40|$|Attitude {{has long}} been a central concept in the area of {{learning}} and academic performance. This study was designed to investigate the attitudes of undergraduates at different levels, taking different degree courses, toward value of theories, value <b>of</b> applications, <b>enjoyment</b> <b>of</b> theories and <b>enjoyment</b> <b>of</b> applications of mathematics. The setting of the study has been Massey University at Palmerston North, New Zealand. The subjects were 203 Students enrolled in " 60. 101 Algebra and Calculus", " 60. 203 Calculus" and " 60. 303 Calculus and Differential Equations". The problem was threefold: (1) The development of an instrument to assess attitudes toward value of theories, value <b>of</b> applications, <b>enjoyment</b> <b>of</b> theories and <b>enjoyment</b> <b>of</b> applications of mathematics. (2) To use the inventory to treasure differences in attitudes of (i) male and female students; (ii) mathematics majors and non-mathematics majors; (iii) mathematics majors at different stages. (3) To find the degree of association between the different attitude measures. A 32 -item attitude instrument of Likert-type was specially developed and administered to the sample population. They were tested in the Autumn of 1980 with the instrument. A pilot study was carried out to assess the effectiveness of all measures before the actual study. The principal function of this pilot study was to assess the adequacy of the measuring instrument and the administration procedures. Using a 0. 05 level of significance the results showed a difference between first year male and female students in their attitudes toward <b>enjoyment</b> <b>of</b> theories. No other significant sex-related difference or mathematics majors/non- mathematics major difference was found. Furthermore, first year mathematics majors and sccond year mathematics majors differ significantly in their attitudes toward <b>enjoyment</b> <b>of</b> theories. The attitude towards value of theories was positively and significantly correlated with attitude towards <b>enjoyment</b> <b>of</b> theories and the attitude towards value of applications was positively and significantly correlated with attitude towards enjoyment ol applications. The attitude towards value of theories was not significantly correlated with attitude towards value of applications and the attitude towards <b>enjoyment</b> <b>of</b> theories was not significantly correlated with attitude towards <b>enjoyment</b> <b>of</b> applications...|$|R
