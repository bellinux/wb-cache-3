40|$|AbstractThe data {{contained}} {{here were}} obtained from the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration׳s National Automotive Sampling System – Crashworthiness Data System (NASS-CDS) for the years 2008 – 2014. This publically available data set monitors motor vehicle crashes in the United States, using a stratified random sample frame, resulting in information on approximately 5000 crashes each year that can be utilized to create national estimates for crashes. The NASS-CDS data sets document vehicle, crash, and occupant factors. These data can be utilized to examine public health, law enforcement, roadway planning, and vehicle design issues. The data provided in this brief are a subset of crash events and occupants. The crashes provided are exclusively frontal crashes. Within these crashes, only restrained occupants who were seated in the right front <b>seat</b> <b>position</b> or the second row <b>outboard</b> <b>seat</b> <b>positions</b> were included. The front row and second row data sets were utilized to construct occupant pairs crashes where both a right front seat occupant and a second row occupant were available. Both unpaired and paired data sets are provided in this brief...|$|R
5000|$|In the United States, {{seat belt}} {{legislation}} varies by state. The state of Wisconsin introduced legislation in 1961 requiring seat belts to be fitted {{to the front}} <b>outboard</b> <b>seat</b> <b>positions</b> of cars. [...] Seat belts have been mandatory equipment since the 1968 model year per Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208. New York State passed the first law in the US mandating the use of seat belts in 1984 {{under the leadership of}} John D. States, an orthopedic surgeon who dedicated his career to improving automotive safety. [...] Depending on which state a driver is in, not wearing a seat belt in the front seat is either a primary offense or a secondary offense, with the exception of New Hampshire, which does not have a law requiring people over age 18 to wear a seat belt. In the front seat, the driver and each passenger must wear a seat belt, one person per belt. In some states, such as New York, New Hampshire, and Michigan, belts in the rear seats are not mandatory for people over the age of 16, though it is extremely advised. The driver and front-seat passengers aged 16 or older can be fined up to $50 each for failure to buckle up. In California, you must be 15 years or older to accompany the driver in the front seat. Children 14 and younger must sit in the rear seat until they reach the age of 15. A primary offense means that a police officer can pull a driver over for the seat belt law violation alone, and secondary offense indicates that one can be punished for a seat belt law violation only if they are already pulled over for another reason. By January 2007 25 states and the District of Columbia had primary seat belt laws, 24 had secondary seat belt laws, and New Hampshire had no laws. [...] In 2009, Public Health Law Research published several evidence briefs summarizing the research assessing the effect of a specific law or policy on public health. One stated, [...] "Safety belt laws work, but there is strong evidence to support that primary enforcement safety belt laws are more effective than secondary enforcement laws in increasing seat belt use and reducing crash injuries." ...|$|R
5000|$|A [...] "sash" [...] or {{shoulder}} harness is a strap that goes diagonally over the vehicle occupant's outboard shoulder and is buckled inboard {{of his or}} her lap. The {{shoulder harness}} may attach to the lap belt tongue, or it may have a tongue and buckle completely separate from those of the lap belt. Shoulder harnesses of this separate or semi-separate type were installed in conjunction with lap belts in the <b>outboard</b> front <b>seating</b> <b>positions</b> of many vehicles in the North American market starting at the inception of the shoulder belt requirement of the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208 on 1 January 1968. However, if the shoulder strap is used without the lap belt, the vehicle occupant is likely to [...] "submarine", or slide forward in the seat and out from under the belt, in a frontal collision. In the mid-1970s, 3-point belt systems such as Chrysler's [...] "Uni-Belt" [...] began to supplant the separate lap and shoulder belts in American-made cars, though such 3-point belts had already been supplied in European vehicles such as Volvos, Mercedes, and Saabs for some years.|$|R
50|$|As U.S. Federal {{safety rules}} {{increased}} throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Checkers kept pace and despite {{having the same}} basic body design, Checker enthusiasts can often identify the year of a Checker based on its safety equipment. For example, starting in 1963, amber parking/directional lights were used up front. 1964 models introduced lap belts in front, energy-absorbing steering columns came in 1967. 1968 models featured round side marker lights on fenders along with shoulder belts, and 1969s introduced headrests for front <b>outboard</b> <b>seating</b> <b>positions.</b>|$|E

Fatality risk to drivers {{was the same as}} fatality risk to right front passengers to within 1 per cent; this was so for crashes in all directions and for frontal crashes. Fatality risk in rear seats was (26 +/- 2) per cent lower than in front seats, and lower in center compared to <b>outboard</b> <b>seats</b> by (22 +/- 4) per cent for front seats and (15 +/- 4) per cent for rear seats.

5000|$|Until the 1980s, three-point belts were {{commonly}} {{available only}} in the front outboard seats of cars; the back seats were only often fitted with lap belts. Evidence of the potential of lap belts to cause separation of the lumbar vertebrae and the sometimes associated paralysis, or [...] "seat belt syndrome", led to progressive revision of passenger safety regulations in nearly all developed countries to require 3-point belts first in all <b>outboard</b> <b>seating</b> <b>positions</b> and eventually in all seating positions in passenger vehicles. Since September 1, 2007, all new cars sold in the U.S. require a lap and shoulder belt in the center rear seat. Besides regulatory changes, [...] "seat belt syndrome" [...] has led to tremendous liability for vehicle manufacturers. One Los Angeles case resulted in a $45 million jury verdict against the Ford Motor Company; the resulting $30 million judgment (after deductions for another defendant who settled prior to trial) was affirmed on appeal in 2006.|$|E

5000|$|Aside from a longer, 5 year/50,000 mile warranty, Eldorado {{received}} {{very few}} changes for 1987. A price drop, to $23,740, {{did not raise}} sales any, as only 17,775 were made this year (21,342 for 1986). The standard suspension, with new taller 75 series (previously 70) tires and hydro-elastic engine mounts, was slightly retuned for a softer ride, while the optional ($155) Touring Suspension, with deflected-disc strut valves and 15" [...] alloy wheels, remained for those desiring a firmer ride. As part of a federal requirement to discourage [...] "chop-shop" [...] thieves, major body panels were etched with the VIN. Also new, a combination cashmere cloth with leather upholstery, and locking inertia seat belt reels for rear seat passengers, which allowed for child-seat installation in the <b>outboard</b> <b>seating</b> <b>positions</b> in back. The formal cabriolet roof was added this year. Available for $495 on the base Eldorado, it featured a padded covering over the rear half of the roof, and turned the rear side glass into smaller opera windows. One of Eldorado's most expensive singluar options was the Motorola cellular telephone mounted inside the locking center arm rest. Priced at $2,850, it had been reworked this year for easier operation, and featured a hidden microphone mounted between the sun visors for hands-free operation. Additionally, the telephone featured a clever radio mute control: activated when the telephone and radio were in use at the same time, it automatically decreased the rear speaker's audio volume, and over-rode the front music speakers {{to be used for}} the hands-free telephone. On an interesting note, the square marker lamp, located on the bumper extension molding just behind the rear wheel well on 1986 and '87 Eldorado models, would suddenly re-appear on the 1990 & '91 Seville (base models only) and Eldorado Touring Coupé.|$|E
40|$|Abstract [...] Rollover crashes {{involving}} 997 automobile {{occupants of}} the front <b>outboard</b> <b>seating</b> <b>positions</b> were reviewed. Injury levels, using the Abbreviated Injury Scale, were studied for their association with ejection, restraint use, roof crush, car weight, and the absence or. presence of the B-pillar. The results indicate that he more serious injuries and fatalities are sustained by those jected from the car, with ejection occurring most often through the side glass area. Restraints are related to less severe injuries to the non-ejected occupant {{as well as to}} a reduced rate of ejection. Roof crush is found to be a factor that interacts with restraint use and with the vehicle factors...|$|E
40|$|Seat belt {{anchorage}} locations have {{a strong}} effect on occupant protection. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 210 specifies requirements for {{the layout of the}} anchorages relative to the seating reference point and seat back angle established by the SAE J 826 H-point manikin. Sled testing and computational simulation has established that belt anchorage locations {{have a strong}} effect on occupant kinematics, particularly for child occupants using the belt as their primary restraint. As part of a larger study of vehicle geometry, the locations of the anchorage points in the second-row, <b>outboard</b> <b>seating</b> <b>positions</b> of 83 passenger cars and light trucks with a median model year of 2005 were measured. The lower anchorage locations spanned the entire range of lap belt angles permissible under FMVSS 210 and the upper anchorages (D-ring locations) were distributed widely as well. Combined with the findings from concurrent research on the effects of belt geometry, these results suggest that occupant kinematics in frontal impact can be expected to differ widely across vehicles due to differences in belt geometry...|$|E

40|$|Period Covered: October 2012 -July 2013 This paper {{explores the}} {{geometric}} feasibility of installing dedicated lower anchors {{in the center}} rear seating positions of vehicles. Analysis {{was based on a}} previous research study in which the lateral spacing of seat belt and LATCH lower anchorages were measured in 85 model year 2010 - 2011 vehicles. The goal {{of this study was to}} determine how many vehicles would have the physical space to incorporate a third set of dedicated lower anchors in the center seating position for child restraint installation. Usability of all of the lower anchors, as well as the seat belts, was also considered. To begin, nine vehicles that currently have dedicated lower anchors in the center position were reviewed. The distances between all seat belt anchors and lower anchors across the vehicle sample were also analyzed to identify spacings that are currently feasible in production. The arrangement of seat belt and lower anchor hardware across the rear seat was also reviewed with respect to usability. Based on these analyses, a lateral distance between the outboard webbing and outboard lower anchor of 75 to 100 mm is common. The suggested minimum distance between lower anchors and seat belt hardware is 25 mm. Based on these dimensions, vehicles with 710 mm or more between the outboard lower anchor centerlines (OBLACL) should have sufficient space to provide three sets of usable, dedicated lower anchors in the right, center, and left seating positions. Providing the highest level of usability with regard to use of seat belt or LATCH hardware in adjacent seating positions would be achieved by placing each pair of lower anchors between the webbing and buckle hardware for the seating position. If the OBLACL is less than 710 mm, an improvised center LATCH position (permitting use of the inboard lower anchors from the <b>outboard</b> <b>seating</b> <b>positions</b> to secure a child restraint in the center seating position) may be feasible. The maximum spacing of this improvised center LATCH position would be 480 mm. If a vehicle allowed an improvised center LATCH position, placing the inboard lower anchor between the outboard buckle and nearest center seat belt hardware would maximize usability of the seat belt in the outboard seating position and lower anchors in the center seating position...|$|E
