5|$|The Model School {{was part}} of the <b>national</b> <b>schools</b> {{programme}} proposed in 1831 in which each county in Ireland would have at least one school that would serve as an example to <b>other</b> <b>national</b> <b>schools</b> in the area and as a teacher training establishment (although teacher training did not take place at this particular school). Initially it had a multi-denominational intake, offered such services as night classes and industry-relevant vocational courses, and was enthusiastically supported by William Brownlow who is thought to have brought the school to the town. It was undermined, however, by church interests, which were opposed to its lack of ecclesiastical control, and criticism of the efficiency of its management, hence losing much of its earlier prestige as the premier educational establishment in the town. Over the years, the intake of Nationalist/Catholic students steadily increased, due mainly to being situated in the Catholic area of Lurgan. The student body is now almost 100% Catholic.|$|R
50|$|In one sense, {{it can be}} {{tempting to}} think of the late pieces as an {{extension}} of Liszt's earlier works, as they exhibit a similar adventurousness harmonically, an intense chromaticism and a tonal ambiguity. What is new is the sadness of heart which pervades many of the late works. As tempting as it can be to think of Liszt as the father of modern music {{on the basis of his}} late music, looking at his achievements in these works as ends in themselves would be erroneous. Liszt's technical achievements in his late music are one side of a more complex picture. Along with the increasing interest in Hungarian and <b>other</b> <b>national</b> <b>schools</b> of composition already mentioned, essential parts of this picture are tragedy in Liszt's personal life and developments in his friendship with Wagner.|$|R

After admiring the boy’s verses, al-Quwatli asked him if there were anything he needed help with. ‘‘I want to go to school,’’ responded the young poet, and his wish was soon fulfilled {{in the form of a}} scholarship to the French lycée at Tartus. The school, the last french Lycée school in Syria at the time, was closed in 1945, and Adonis was transferred to <b>other</b> <b>national</b> <b>schools</b> before graduating in 1949.
