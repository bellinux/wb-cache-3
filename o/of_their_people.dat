5|$|Mahatma Gandhi's life {{achievement}} stands {{unique in}} political history. He has invented {{a completely new}} and humane means for the liberation war of an oppressed country, and practised it with greatest energy and devotion. The moral influence he had on the consciously thinking human being of the entire civilised world will probably be much more lasting than it seems in our time with its overestimation of brutal violent forces. Because lasting will only {{be the work of}} such statesmen who wake up and strengthen the moral power <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>people</b> through their example and educational works. We may all be happy and grateful that destiny gifted us with such an enlightened contemporary, a role model for the generations to come.|$|E
5|$|Soebadio Sastrosatomo {{wrote that}} Santoso's {{selection}} as social minister {{was important for}} several reasons. Firstly, her selection showed that the government truly respected women's contributions to the nationalist movement. Secondly, {{it was a way}} for Sjahrir to show that the Indonesian people were committed to the needs <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>people,</b> by having a woman deal with women's issues. After Santoso, other women have held government positions. The second female Indonesian minister, S. K. Trimurti, served as minister of labour from 1947 to 1948. In 2001, Megawati Sukarnoputri became the first female president of Indonesia.|$|E

5|$|Bloemfontein, {{the former}} British {{garrison}} town, became the Free State's capital; the Transvaal {{seat of government}} became Pretoria, named after the elder Pretorius. The South African Republic was in practice split between the south-west and central Transvaal, where most of Pretorius's supporters were, and regionalist factions in the Zoutpansberg, Lydenburg and Utrecht districts that viewed any central authority with suspicion. Kruger's first campaign as a commandant was {{in the latter part}} of 1854, against the chiefs Mapela and Makapan near the Waterberg. The chiefs retreated into what became called the Caves of Makapan ("Makapansgat") with many <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>people</b> and cattle, and a siege ensued in which thousands of the defenders died, mainly from starvation. When Commandant-General Piet Potgieter of Zoutpansberg was shot dead, Kruger advanced under heavy fire to retrieve the body and was almost killed himself.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 20th century, Native Americans were {{authorized}} {{by federal law}} to establish gaming casinos on their reservations under certain conditions, in states which had authorized such gaming.

50|$|It is {{believed}} that around 1870 some Toba chiefs immigrated from Argentina escaping constant victimization <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>peoples,</b> thus settling in Alto Paraguay.

These Piscataways are said to have moved to Canada & probably merged with the Mississaugas, who had broken away from the Anishinaabeg & migrated southeast into that same region. Despite that, many Piscataway stayed in Virginia & Maryland until the modern day. Other members of the Piscataway also merged with the Nanticoke.|$|E
25|$|Once {{thought to}} face {{extinction}} as a race or culture, Native Americans of numerous tribes have achieved revival of {{aspects of their}} cultures, together with asserting their sovereignty and direction of their own affairs since the mid-20th century. Many have started language programs to revive use of traditional languages; some have established tribally controlled colleges and other schools on their reservations, so that education is expressive of their cultures. Since the late 20th century, many tribes have developed gaming casinos on their sovereign land to raise revenues for economic development, {{as well as to}} promote the education and welfare <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>people</b> through health care and construction of improved housing.|$|E

After personally defeating and slaying the prince of Caenina in single combat, Romulus stripped him of his armour, becoming the first to claim the spolia opima, and vowed a temple to Jupiter Feretrius.

25|$|Connerly's {{opposition}} {{to affirmative action}} has generated both opposition and support. Connerly believes affirmative action {{is a form of}} racism and that people can achieve success without preferential treatment in college enrollment or in employment. He thinks that selective affirmative action discriminates against minorities such as Asian Indians and South East Asians, as some <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>people</b> have experienced discrimination in the past, but they do not receive the benefits of race-based admissions. Critics contend Connerly fails to recognize the damaging extent of past racism for African Americans and Hispanics, that contemporary institutionalized racism is pervasive and powerful, and that affirmative action can overcome the residual effects of past discrimination on people of color.|$|E
25|$|The {{occupation}} attracted wide media coverage, {{especially after}} the press accompanied the two U.S. senators from South Dakota to Wounded Knee. The events electrified American Indians, who were inspired by the sight <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>people</b> standing {{in defiance of the}} government which had so often failed them. Many American Indian supporters traveled to Wounded Knee to join the protest. At the time there was widespread public sympathy for the goals of the occupation, as Americans were becoming more aware of longstanding issues of injustice related to American Indians. Afterward AIM leaders Dennis Banks and Russell Means were indicted on charges related to the events, but their 1974 case was dismissed by the federal court for prosecutorial misconduct, a decision upheld on appeal.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the source}} cited above {{and other sources}} mention that Great Moravia {{disappeared}} without trace and that its inhabitants left for the Bulgars, with Croats and Magyars following their victories, archaeological research and toponyms suggest the continuity of Slavic population in the valleys of the rivers of the Inner Western Carpathians. Moreover, there are sporadic references to Great Moravia from later years: in 924/925, both Folkuin in his Gesta abb. Lobiensium and Ruotger in Archiepiscopi Coloniensis Vita Brunonis mention Great Moravia. In 942, Magyar warriors captured during their raid in al-Andalus said that Moravia is the northern neighbour <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>people.</b> The fate of the northern and western parts of former Great Moravia in the 10th century is thus largely unclear.|$|E
