5|$|The Charlemagne-class ships did not {{function}} {{well in a}} head sea. Stormy weather in the Bay of Biscay in 1900 caused the captain of Gaulois to complain that the ship's forward gun turret and casemates were flooded out and that the ship generated enormous sheets <b>of</b> <b>spray</b> when water came over the bow. Like most French capital ships of the period, they had pronounced tumblehome. Gauloiss captain also said that his ship was a steady gunnery platform and manoeuvered well in tight spaces but he criticized the armour layout as not high enough to prevent munitions from penetrating above the main armour belt and detonating below the secondary armament positions.|$|E
5|$|The {{small and}} {{isolated}} {{nature of the}} site makes it susceptible to damage from the surrounding area. For example, herbicides, thought to be generally damaging for the species richness, could get onto the site from the drift <b>of</b> <b>spray</b> from surrounding fields. To help combat this the maintenance of mature hedgerows around the perimeter is encouraged. As of 2006 the condition of Whitton Bridge Pasture is described as favourable, {{which means that the}} land is being adequately conserved and any conservation objectives are being met, but that there is scope for enhancement of the site. The condition of the site was also described as favourable in 2004 and 2005 assessments. In the future it is hoped that the grazing regime will become more regularised and will be of high priority.|$|E
5|$|A {{variation}} of the spray transfer mode, pulse-spray {{is based on the}} principles <b>of</b> <b>spray</b> transfer but uses a pulsing current to melt the filler wire and allow one small molten droplet to fall with each pulse. The pulses allow the average current to be lower, decreasing the overall heat input and thereby decreasing the size of the weld pool and heat-affected zone while making it possible to weld thin workpieces. The pulse provides a stable arc and no spatter, since no short-circuiting takes place. This also makes the process suitable for nearly all metals, and thicker electrode wire can be used as well. The smaller weld pool gives the variation greater versatility, making it possible to weld in all positions. In comparison with short arc GMAW, this method has a somewhat slower maximum speed (85mm/s or 200in/min) and the process also requires that the shielding gas be primarily argon with a low carbon dioxide concentration. Additionally, it requires a special power source capable of providing current pulses with a frequency between 30 and 400 pulses per second. However, the method has gained popularity, since it requires lower heat input and can be used to weld thin workpieces, as well as nonferrous materials.|$|E

40|$|To {{study the}} tensile {{mechanical}} properties <b>of</b> <b>sprayed</b> FRP, 13 groups of specimens were tested through uniaxial tensile experiments, being analyzed about stress-strain curve, tensile strength, elastic modulus, breaking elongation, and other mechanical properties. Influencing factors on tensile mechanical properties <b>of</b> <b>sprayed</b> FRP such as fiber type, resin type, fiber volume ratio, fiber length, and composite thickness were {{studied in the}} paper too. The results show that both fiber type and resin type have an obvious influence on tensile mechanical properties <b>of</b> <b>sprayed</b> FRP. There will be a specific fiber volume ratio for sprayed FRP to obtain the best tensile mechanical property. The increase of fiber length can lead to better tensile performance, while that of composite thickness results in property degradation.

In view of the total number <b>of</b> <b>spraying</b> pesticide and results of two control strategies, the state feedback control strategy is more effective than the time-fixed pulse control strategy.|$|R

25|$|Atholl {{was ordered}} 2 January 1942 {{as part of}} the 1942-43 {{modified}} Flower-class building programme. This programme was known as the Increased Endurance (IE). Many changes were made, all from lessons that had been learned in previous versions of the Flower-class. The bridge was made a full deck higher and built to naval standards instead of the more civilian-like bridges of previous versions. The platform for the 4-inch main gun was raised to minimize the amount <b>of</b> <b>spray</b> over it and to provide a better field of fire. It was also connected to the wheelhouse by a wide platform that was now the base for the Hedgehog anti-submarine mortar that this version was armed with.

25|$|As {{the ship}} turned slowly to comb torpedoes, two sticks of bombs fell {{on either side}} of the tanker. The vessel lifted, and went on lifting until she was clean out of the water. Cascades <b>of</b> <b>spray</b> and bomb {{splinters}} lashed the deck, she fell back with a crash. Ohio had differential gearing which slowed the propeller automatically; on other ships, the same effect would have shaken the engines out of their rooms. Continuously bombed, the tanker kept on steaming until another explosion to starboard sent her reeling to port. The engine-room lights went out, plunging her into darkness. The master switches had been thrown off by the force of the explosion, but they were quickly switched on again by an electrician. This time, the ship had not escaped damage. The boiler fires were blown out, and it was a race against time to restore them before the steam pressure dropped too low to work the fuel pumps. The engineers lit the fire starter torches to restart the furnaces.|$|E

40|$|It {{is known}} from {{experience}} that when spraying concrete it spreads on the wall, being the distribution of concrete around the axis depending -at the remaining factors constant- on nozzle designo The shape of these "spreadings" have been analysed by different authors [1][2], who shown that a relation between the cross section of single layer strips <b>of</b> <b>sprayed</b> concrete and the spraying process parameters exist. However, no analytical mode 1 s of this relationship {{have been found in}} the literature [1]. The way concrete spreads on the wall can be modelled using a statistical approach by introducing a spraying density function.
