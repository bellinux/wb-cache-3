40|$|Cryogenics is {{the science}} and {{technology}} of very low temperatures. Although there is no hard and fast definition of where <b>ordinary</b> <b>refrigeration</b> gives way to cryogenics, it is customary to consider the dividing line as being at ~ 100 K. Of particular scientific interest and importance are the cryogenic phenomena of superconductivity (below - 20 K) and superfluidity (below - 2 K), for which no known analogues exist in the everyday world at room temperature. Cryogenic techniques are now being employed in applications as diverse as medicine, rocketry, archeology, and metrology...|$|E
40|$|The {{pulse tube}} {{refrigerator}} (PTR) is a cryocooler which {{is capable of}} reaching temperature of a few tens of Kelvin in a single stage and a few Kelvin in two stages. Unlike <b>ordinary</b> <b>refrigeration</b> cycles which utilize the vapor compression cycle, a PTR implements the oscillatory compression and expansion of gas within a closed volume to achieve the desired refrigeration. Pulse tube refrigerator has the advantages of longâ€“life operation, high reliability and low vibration over the conventional cryocoolers, such as G-M and Stirling coolers because {{of the absence of}} moving parts at their low temperature end. Due to its associated advantages, pulse tube refrigerators have several applications such as cooling of infrared sensors, night vision equipments, SQUID, cryopumping etc...|$|E
50|$|Heat cannot spontaneously {{flow from}} cold regions to hot regions without {{external}} work being {{performed on the}} system, which is evident from <b>ordinary</b> experience of <b>refrigeration,</b> for example. In a refrigerator, heat flows from cold to hot, but only when forced by an external agent, the refrigeration system.|$|R
