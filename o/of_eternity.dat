5|$|Pillars <b>of</b> <b>Eternity</b> was {{developed}} by Obsidian Entertainment and published by Paradox Interactive. The game uses {{a modified version of}} the Unity game engine made specifically for Pillars <b>of</b> <b>Eternity.</b> The game was directed by Josh Sawyer. There were multiple competing pitches for Pillars of Eternitys storyline within the studio, and the one worked on by Eric Fenstermaker and George Ziets ultimately won, after which Fenstermaker, who previously worked as a writer on the company's , was designated the game's lead narrative designer. Also involved in production were Adam Brennecke, Chris Avellone and Tim Cain. The audio director of Pillars <b>of</b> <b>Eternity</b> was Justin Bell, who also composed the game's score. Bell stated he was inspired by the music of Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale when composing the game's music.|$|E

2500|$|Maimonides, {{over eight}} centuries ago, {{was faced with}} the widely {{accepted}} Aristotelian theory <b>of</b> the <b>eternity</b> <b>of</b> the universe, which ostensibly contradicted the Biblical conception of creation in time. [...] Maimonides demonstrated that Aristotle had not conclusively proved the <b>eternity</b> <b>of</b> matter, and that since eternity and creation were philosophically equally acceptable alternatives, he preferred to accept creation since this theory was the one apparently taught in Genesis. [...] Nevertheless, Maimonides averred, were the Aristotelian theory convincingly proven, he would have accepted it and reinterpreted the verses in Genesis to accommodate the theory <b>of</b> the <b>eternity</b> <b>of</b> matter.|$|R
5|$|On October 16, 2012, Pillars of Eternitys Kickstarter funding {{campaign}} {{concluded with}} a total of $3,986,929, becoming the most highly funded video game on the Kickstarter platform at the time. Together with further funds collected via PayPal, its budget rose to $4,163,208. In December 2013, Obsidian announced that the official title for the game would be Pillars <b>of</b> <b>Eternity,</b> dropping the working title Project Eternity. They also launched a poll asking backers whether or not they would support further fundraising.|$|E
5|$|The 98%-ish {{complete}} beta and {{an earlier}} version were eventually leaked and made playable. Soon afterward, an unofficial restoration effort known as Chrono Trigger: Flames <b>of</b> <b>Eternity</b> became popular and aimed to fully complete the game's development, switching from using the earlier version as a base to the latest released version. While it received heavy criticism from the first developers and a very mixed reaction from the fan base {{for some of the}} changes, it nonetheless is the most stable version of the game and is under active development.|$|E
5|$|Josephine, who was of Jewish heritage, had Earp's body cremated and {{secretly}} buried his {{remains in the}} Marcus family plot at the Hills <b>of</b> <b>Eternity,</b> a Jewish cemetery in Colma, California. When she died in 1944, her remains were interred alongside his. In 1957, the Tombstone Restoration Commission looked for Wyatt's ashes {{with the goal of}} having them moved to Tombstone. They contacted family members seeking permission and the location of his ashes, but no one could tell them where Wyatt was buried, not even his closest living relative, George Earp. Arthur King, a deputy to Earp from 1910 to 1912, finally revealed that Josephine had buried Wyatt's cremated remains in Colma, California, and the Tombstone Commission cancelled its plans to relocate his ashes.|$|E

5|$|The player fights through monsters and bandits {{in crystal}} caves, a forest, a swamp, and an {{underground}} Goblin fortress filled with mechanical war machines. After recovering the Staff from the Goblins, the player character meets {{a division of}} the 10th Legion and is pointed towards Fortress Kroth, which has been overrun with undead. After clearing the fortress and fighting monsters and a dragon in the Cliffs of Fire, they march on Castle Ehb. The player characters then storm the castle and fight through the Seck forces to rescue King Konreid. He informs the party that the Seck's leader, Gom, is seeking the magical weapons from the Empire of Stars stored in the Chamber of Stars, and that the characters must secure the weapons and then defeat the remaining Seck. The player character collects the weapons and fights through lava caves and the Vault <b>of</b> <b>Eternity</b> where the Seck had been imprisoned. The player character kills Gom, defeating the Seck and saving the kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the studio's history, many {{projects}}—including Futureblight, Dwarves, Aliens: Crucible, and Stormlands—were cancelled. Due {{to having}} so many projects cancelled, the company entered a severe financial crisis in 2012. As a result, Obsidian decided to crowdfund their next game, Pillars <b>of</b> <b>Eternity,</b> a role-playing game played from an isometric perspective, which ultimately became a success and saved the studio from closure. The team's focus then changed from developing licensed titles to creating original games {{based on the}} studio's own intellectual property. Obsidian has developed {{a close relationship with}} another studio that was founded by ex-Interplay Entertainment employees, inXile Entertainment. The company's latest games are Tyranny, a role-playing game set in a world where the war between good and evil has been fought with evil coming out on top, and Armored Warfare, a massively multiplayer online game with a focus on controlling tanks.|$|E

5|$|Dungeon Siege {{is set in}} the Kingdom of Ehb, {{a varied}} region on the {{continent}} of Aranna containing deserts, swamps, forests, and mountains, created three centuries earlier at the dissolution of the Empire of Stars. At the beginning of the game, the player character's farming village is attacked by a race of creatures named the Krug. The main character, a farmer with no given background who is named by the player, journeys through the Krug forces to the town of Stonebridge. Upon breaking the siege of the town, and gaining their first companion, the player character is tasked by the town's garrison leader Gyorn with journeying to the town of Glacern and alerting the Ehb military forces, called the 10th Legion, of the incursion and defeating any forces they encounter along the way. After journeying through crypts, mines, and mountains, the player character reaches Glacern, where they are informed that the Krug invasion happened the same day that the Grand Mage Merik disappeared, and are charged with traveling over the mountains to Fortress Kroth to assist the legion there. In the mountains they find Merik, who informs them that the Krug invasion {{is part of a larger}} invasion by the Seck, who destroyed the Empire of Stars before being imprisoned underneath Castle Ehb, and who have escaped and taken the castle. Merik asks the player to help recover the Staff of Stars from the Goblins. Prior to its theft, the Staff had kept the Seck imprisoned in the Vault <b>of</b> <b>Eternity.</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze {{some of the}} {{arguments}} Plotinus offers in his treatise II, 1 [On Heaven, 40 in chronological order] to defend the <b>eternity</b> <b>of</b> the world without implying, in his eyes, {{a departure from the}} teachings of Plato's Timaeus. We will focus on the objections Plotinus presents in the first chapter of his treatise to two arguments in favor <b>of</b> the <b>eternity</b> <b>of</b> the cosmos and we will try to show that, although we may find these two arguments in the Timaeus, the dialogue is not the aim of Plotinus's criticism. We argue {{that it is important to}} take into account the divergent views of Atticus and Aristotle in this regard, because they could contribute, first, to illuminate how Plotinus reelaborates the Platonic philosophy and, second, to highlight the metaphysical assumptions underlying his postulation <b>of</b> the <b>eternity</b> <b>of</b> the worl...|$|R
