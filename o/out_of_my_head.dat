5|$|Earlier on I {{tried to}} include people {{as much as}} possible. Then I {{realised}} the magic is me really prying stuff <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> and getting it on to tape, and that stuff doesn't happen unless I'm completely alone. Sometimes it's about {{the right amount of}} blood sugar, just slightly hungover. And I'm really affected by the weather. If it's too nice outside it's insane for me, the concept of being inside. Everybody talks about this whole technology versus nature thing and if it's anything that is it: look who my best friends are, a bunch of plastic and circuitry and electricity, when I should be running around getting chased by bumblebees.|$|E
5|$|The {{sixth and}} final symphony, Sinfonia semplice, {{was written in}} 1924–25. After {{suffering}} a serious heart attack in 1925, Nielsen was forced to curtail much of his activity, although he continued to compose until his death. His sixtieth birthday in 1925 brought many congratulations, a decoration from the Swedish government, and a gala concert and reception in Copenhagen. The composer, however, was in a dour mood; {{in an article in}} Politiken on 9 November 1925 he wrote: If I could live my life again, I would chase any thoughts of Art <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> and be apprenticed to a merchant or pursue some other useful trade the results of which could be visible in the end... What use is it to me that the whole world acknowledges me, but hurries away and leaves me alone with my wares until everything breaks down and I discover to my disgrace that I have lived as a foolish dreamer and believed that the more I worked and exerted myself in my art, the better position I would achieve. No, it is no enviable fate to be an artist.|$|E

He stated that, during his time at the Maudsley, he was simultaneously appearing in Whose Line Is It Anyway? on Channel 4.|$|E

6000|$|... "It's done," [...] said Peter, {{with an air}} of gloomy triumph. [...] "It don't {{amount to}} much, but anyhow I made it all <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own <b>head.</b> Not one word of it was ever printed or told before, and nobody can say there was." ...|$|R

25|$|I am {{extremely}} {{disappointed with}} the overall picture of Test play, which {{was not the kind}} of cricket I want to watch. People who pay to see a Test are entitled to see a real match, not a tactical tie-up. I think it is a fair result that neither England or Australia won the series. I can't get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> why Test matches are so different from State matches, where I think England played pretty well. It is all so different from what we visualised. After all this talk of brighter cricket I think we should get back to playing cricket. Perhaps a little more action and less talk.|$|E
25|$|I {{composed}} the fugue first and {{wrote it down}} while I was thinking out the prelude. I only {{hope that you will}} be able to read it, for it is written so very small; and I hope further that you will like it. Another time I shall send you something better for the clavier. My dear Constanze is really the cause of this fugue's coming into the world. Baron van Swieten, to whom I go every Sunday, gave me all the works of Händel and Sebastian Bach to take home with me (after I had played them to him). When Constanze heard the fugues, she absolutely fell in love with them. Now she will listen to nothing but fugues, and particularly (in this kind of composition) the works of Händel and Bach. Well, as she has often heard me play fugues <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> she asked me if I had ever written any down, and when I said I had not, she scolded me roundly for not recording some of my compositions in this most artistically beautiful of all musical forms and never ceased to entreat me until I wrote down a fugue for her.|$|E
500|$|Fischer and Spassky gave ten press {{conferences}} during the match. Seirawan attended the match {{and met with}} Fischer on several occasions; the two analyzed some match games and had personal discourse. Seirawan later wrote: [...] "After September 23 , I threw most of what I'd ever read about Bobby <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> Sheer garbage. Bobby is the most misunderstood, misquoted celebrity walking {{the face of the}} earth." [...] He added that Fischer was not camera shy, smiled and laughed easily, was [...] "a fine wit" [...] and [...] "wholly enjoyable conversationalist".|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes," [...] said Maggie, {{reviving}} {{a little}} in the desire to vindicate the variety of her reading. [...] "I know the reading in this book isn't pretty; but I like the pictures, and I make stories to the pictures <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own <b>head,</b> you know. But I've got 'Æsop's Fables,' and a book about Kangaroos and things, and the 'Pilgrim's Progress.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|Here, then, Herr Parish, {{with the}} printed story under his eyes, once more {{illustrates}} want of attention. In one way his errors improve his case. 'If I, a grave man of science, go on telling distorted legends <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own <b>head,</b> while {{the facts are}} plain in print before me,' Herr Parish may reason, 'how much more are the popular tales about coincidental hallucinations likely to be distorted?' It is really a very strong argument, but not exactly the argument which Herr Parish conceives himself to be presenting.[15] ...|$|R

'They will think it comes from me,' she said, 'and the whole effect {{of it will be}} spoilt.' It's a letter, Mrs. Wagner, announcing my {{marriage}} to mamma's relations here, who have behaved so badly to her--and she says they may do something for me, if I write to them as if I had done it all <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own <b>head.</b> I don't know whether I make myself understood?" ...|$|R
500|$|More {{than one}} hundred actors auditioned for the role, but only ten were taken seriously by the producers. Known actors such as Lou Diamond Phillips and Hart Bochner were among the auditionees for the role as Agent Doggett. Both Phillips and Bochner were {{considered}} for the role, but the producers eventually chose Robert Patrick. In an interview with, Chris Carter said [...] "I think {{it was something that}} we all talked about, but I wrote his voice. So, I think he was someone we all came up with together, but his voice came <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> But, it was something that was helped in a large degree by casting Robert Patrick." ...|$|E
500|$|Subsequently, Wainwright paired up with Diane Taylor, {{a former}} Detective Inspector from Greater Manchester Police, {{to create the}} programme, and the {{production}} expanded from Jones and Lindsay's original concept. From Taylor's perspective, police procedurals were often filled with not only technical inaccuracies, but what she felt were inaccuracies of how officers behaved, saying: [...] "that's what really irritates me in other dramas– detectives crying over dead bodies and getting drunk senseless. You'd last about two weeks". She said, of her time {{as a police officer}} in comparison to portrayals on television, that [...] "reality is much more interesting. I could pull a thousand cases <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> people would say would never happen. People need drama because they would not believe the reality".|$|E
500|$|In mid-1984, Madonna met {{producer}} Nile Rodgers at the Power Station studios (now Avatar Studios) in New York. Rodgers initially did {{not want}} Madonna to record [...] "Like a Virgin", as {{he felt that the}} lyric 'like a virgin' was not a terrific hook; according to him it was not an all-time catch phrase. Rogers dismissed the song after hearing the demo, which he thought sounded [...] "really stupid and retarded". Later, Rodgers had second thoughts: [...] "It's weird because I couldn't get it <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> after I played it, even though I didn't really like it. It sounded really bubble-gummy to me, but it grew on me. I really started to like it. [...] But, my first reaction to it was, 'This is really queer.'" [...] Rodgers credits Madonna with recognizing the song's potential. He later said: [...] "I handed my apology to Madonna and said, 'you know... if it's so catchy that it stayed in my head for four days, it must be something. So let's do it.'" [...] Hence the song was finally recorded. Steinberg reflected on the recording process and commented that: ...|$|E
60|$|Now {{you will}} {{forgive me for}} writing all this, dearest Mrs. Martin. I like to write my {{thoughts}} and feelings <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own <b>head</b> and heart, just as they suggest themselves, when I write to you; and I cannot think of affliction, {{particularly when it comes}} near to me in the affliction or anxiety of dear friends, without looking back and remembering what voice of God used to sound softly to me when none other could speak comfort. You will forgive me, and not be angry with me for trying, or seeming to try, to be a sermon writer.|$|R
60|$|As we had sixteen {{miles to}} our journey's end that night, {{for it was}} near four o'clock before we got into our coach again, the coachman drove with great speed, and at dusk in the evening we entered the west gate of the city, and put up at an inn in High Street (near St. Mary Bredman's church), which {{generally}} {{was filled with the}} best of company. The anxiety <b>of</b> <b>my</b> mind, on finding myself pursued by this girl, and the fatigue <b>of</b> <b>my</b> journey, had made me much <b>out</b> <b>of</b> order, <b>my</b> <b>head</b> ached, and I had no stomach.|$|R
6000|$|... "Poh, poh, Primrose!" [...] exclaimed the student, rather vexed. [...] "I don't believe I {{can tell}} one <b>of</b> <b>my</b> {{stories in the}} {{presence}} of grown people. Besides, your father is a classical scholar; not that I am much afraid of his scholarship, neither, for I doubt not it is as rusty as an old case-knife by this time. But then he will be sure to quarrel with the admirable nonsense that I put into these stories, <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own <b>head,</b> and which makes the great charm of the matter for children, like yourself. No man of fifty, who has read the classical myths in his youth, can possibly understand my merit as a reinventor and improver of them." ...|$|R
500|$|Unable {{to return}} to Lichfield Grammar School, Johnson was enrolled, {{with the help of}} Ford and his {{half-brother}} Gregory Hickman, into the King Edward VI grammar school at Stourbridge. The headmaster was John Wentworth, and he took care to work with Johnson on his translation exercises. Because the school was located near Pedmore, Johnson was able {{to spend more time with}} the Fords and get to know his other relatives in the area. During this time he began writing poems and produced many verse translations. However, he spent only six months at Stourbridge before returning once again to his parents' home in 1727. When Boswell was writing his Life of Samuel Johnson, he was told by Johnson's school friend Edmund Hector Johnson's leaving the Stourbridge school was due in part to a fight Johnson and Wentworth had over Latin grammar. For companionship, Johnson spent time with Hector and John Taylor, two of his schoolfriends, and he soon fell in love with Hector's younger sister, Ann. This first love was not to last, and Johnson later claimed to Boswell, [...] "She was the first woman with whom I was in love. It dropped <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> imperceptibly, but she and I shall always have a kindness for each other." ...|$|E
500|$|Chris Carabott from IGN [...] "loved" [...] Tom's first {{appearance}} because [...] "It's a great scene and our first introduction to The Others besides Ethan's infiltration of the camp." [...] Gainey found the fan {{reaction to his}} {{first appearance}} [...] "really tough", because [...] "everywhere [...] went people would just give [...] dirty looks and they were like 'What {{are you going to}} do with that boy?'", but he noted this gradually improved after his appearances in season two. Erin Martell from AOL's TV Squad listed Tom in her five [...] "most entertaining guest roles" [...] from the first three seasons, commenting [...] "I am counting his first episode as my favorite. For my money, there was nothing more disturbing than when Gainey showed up out of the blue and uttered the words, 'We're gonna have to take the boy.' I could not get that scene <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> for days after 'Exodus' aired. Ben has made Tom seem relatively less menacing over time, but I have a feeling that the terrifying, bearded sea captain is still in there somewhere." [...] In her review of the season four episode [...] "The Other Woman", Nikki Stafford of Wizard called the return of her [...] "favorite Other" [...] (Tom) a [...] "highlight". Following his posthumous flashback appearance in [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson", Martell said [...] "Now I feel even worse about his death. He wasn't just one of Ben's scary, Walt-napping minions. He had a heart." [...] Tim Goodman from the San Francisco Chronicle thought the revelation that Tom is gay was a [...] "unique and funny twist". Jay Glatfelter of The Huffington Post noted this revelation [...] "seemed a little oddly placed, kind of like 'Let's make one of our characters gay just for the heck of it' but still it's cool that the show has a perfectly normal (well for an 'Other') not over-the-top gay character." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1966, Wilson {{elaborated}} {{that his}} writing process involved {{going to the}} piano and finding [...] "feels," [...] which he described as [...] "brief note sequences, fragments of ideas," [...] and that [...] "once they're <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> and into the open air, I can see them and touch them firmly.

They're not 'feels' anymore." [...] Some of his stylistic markers include slash chords, key modulations, [...] "stepwise falloffs", the use of minor seventh chords drawn from Burt Bacharach, piano triads [...] "hammered" [...] in eighths, and a tendency for his harmonic progressions to wander far from the tonal center. Musicologist Daniel Harrison notes that [...] "even the least distinguished of the Beach Boys' early uptempo rock 'n' roll songs show traces of structural complexity at some level; Brian was simply too curious and experimental to leave convention alone." [...] Lyrics were usually written by an outside collaborator after the melody and chord patterns were established.|$|E

5000|$|After a two-and-a-half-year {{break in}} the action, Mr Lewisham is in his third year of study at the Normal School of Science in South Kensington. He has become a socialist, declaring his {{politics}} with a red tie, and is an object of interest to Alice Heydinger, an older student. However, chance brings him together again with his first love at a séance. Ethel's stepfather, Mr Chaffery, is a spiritualist charlatan, and Mr Lewisham is determined to extricate her from association with Chaffery's dishonesty. They marry, and Mr Lewisham is forced to abandon his plans for a brilliant scientific career followed by a political ascent. When Chaffrey absconds to the Continent with money he has embezzled from his clients, Lewisham agrees to move into his shabby Clapham house to look after Ethel, their child, and Ethel's elderly mother (Chaffrey's abandoned wife). Wells's friends Richard Gregory wrote to him after reading the novel: [...] "I cannot get that poor devil Lewisham <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> mind <b>head,</b> and I wish I had an address, for I would go to him and rescue him from the miserable life in which you leave him." ...|$|R

Jonny Quinn found me in the stairwell with blood coming <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> ... I split my head open and my eye was closed and I lost a few teeth ... I wrote Run soon after on this little guitar I'd tried to smash up in my shitty little room near Hillhead. The words 'Light up, light up' gave me this sense of a beacon."

Nevertheless, should his English rent-roll fall a little behindhand, his Dutch claim for a hundred thousand dollars was certainly in the hands of our government, and might at least be valuable to the extent of thirty pounds, which I had engaged to pay on his behalf. But I have reason to fear that his Dutch riches turned out to be Dutch gilt, or fairy gold, and his English country-seat a mere castle in the air,--which I exceedingly regret, for he was a delightful companion and a very gentlemanly man.|$|R
