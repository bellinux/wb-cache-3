40|$|The {{determination}} of physical properties of flavor singlet objects like the eta' meson by computer simulation requires the computation of functionals of the inverse fermionic matrix M- 1. So far, only stochastic methods could {{cope with the}} enormous size of M. In this paper, we introduce an alternative approach {{which is based on}} the Computation of a subset of low-lying eigenmodes of the fermionic matrix. The high quality of this 'truncated eigenmode approximation' (TEA) is demonstrated by comparison with the pion correlator, a flavor <b>octet</b> <b>quantity,</b> which is readily computable through a linear system of equations. We show that TEA can successfully approximate the flavor singlet eta' correlator. We find that the systematic error of the method is tolerable. As the {{determination of}} the chosen subset of 300 eigenmodes requires about 3. 5 Tflops-hours CPU-time per canonical ensemble and at least 15 GBytes of memory, the power of high-end supercomputers like the CRAY T 3 E is indispensable.
