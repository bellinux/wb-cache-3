40|$|One of the {{challenging}} problems in video databases is {{the organization of}} video information. Segmenting a video {{into a number of}} clips and characterizing each clip has been suggested as one mechanism for organizing video information. This approach requires a suitable method to automatically locate cut points in a video. One way of finding such cut points is to determine the boundaries between consecutive camera shots. In this paper, we address this as a statistical hypothesis testing problem and present three tests to determine cut locations. All the three tests are such that they can be applied directly to the compressed video. This avoids an unnecessary decompression-compression cycle, since it is common to store and transmit digital video in compressed form.

30|$|Copper {{films of}} 85  nm {{thickness}} were deposited on glass substrates (10  ×  10  mm 2 <b>cut</b> from <b>microscope</b> slide) by thermal evaporation from tungsten boat.

Deposition angle and deposition rate were 15 º and 3  Å/s, while base pressure was 2  ×  10 − 5  mbar. Post-annealing of the Cu/glass films was performed by a horizontal tube furnace at five different temperatures of 200, 250, 300, 350 and 400  °C in the air environment and oxygen flow of 200 sccm.

Métodos: Foram estudados por meio do analisador de espessura retiniana, biomicroscopia do segmento posterior, retinografia e fluoresceinografia, dez olhos de seis pacientes com diagnóstico de buraco macular. Destes, 8 foram examinados antes de qualquer tratamento, e dois, após o tratamento do buraco macular pela vitrectomia. Resultados: Em dois olhos com diagnóstico de buraco macular pelo exame clínico e outros exames complementares, a opacidade dos meios impediu a análise pelo analisador de espessura retiniana. O corte óptico do analisador de espessura retiniana mostrou concordância com os achados clínicos e com os observados nos oito olhos em que o exame foi possível. O corte topográfico nos dois olhos que apresentavam buraco macular fechado pela cirurgia mostraram espessura foveal média normal, e nos seis olhos com buraco macular não operado, espessura foveal média aumentada. Conclusão: O corte óptico do analisador de espessura retiniana evidenciou o buraco macular, forneceu informações sobre sua largura e profundidade e comprovou o fechamento do buraco após a vitrectomia.

In recent years, optical fibres have been widely applied to various applications in communication and sensor systems.

Again the coupling efficiency and sensitivity are measured for various geometrical configurations. Initially, the two fibres are positioned parallel to each other with the reflective surface being set normal to the fibre arrangement.

Optical instruments designed for the wavelength range where these two materials are transmissive achieve best performance when cooled to cryogenic temperatures to enhance signal from the scene over instrument background radiation. In order to enable high quality lens designs using silicon and germanium at cryogenic temperatures, we have measured the absolute refractive index of multiple prisms of these two materials using the Cryogenic, High-Accuracy Refraction Measuring System (CHARMS) at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, as a function of both wavelength and temperature. For silicon, we report absolute refractive index and thermo-optic coefficient (dn/dT) at temperatures ranging from 20 to 300 K at wavelengths from 1. 1 to 5. 6 microns, while for germanium, we cover temperatures ranging from 20 to 300 K and wavelengths from 1. 9 to 5. 5 microns. We compare our measurements with others in the literature and provide temperature-dependent Sellmeier coefficients based on our data to allow accurate interpolation of index to other wavelengths and temperatures. Citing the wide variety of values for the refractive indices of these two materials found in the literature, we reiterate the importance of measuring the refractive index of a sample from the same batch of raw material from which final <b>optical</b> components are <b>cut</b> when absolute accuracy greater than +/- 5 x 10 ^- 3 is desired.

40|$|For {{reinforced}} concrete structures, steel corrosion {{resulting from the}} penetration of chloride ions or carbon dioxide is {{a major cause of}} degradation. The objectives of the work are to develop a novel optical fiber sensor for steel corrosion and to introduce a novel approach for chloride prevention. For the corrosion sensor, it is based on a very simple physical principle. The flat end of a <b>cut</b> <b>optical</b> fiber is coated with an iron thin film by sputtering technique. Light is then sent into a fiber embedded in concrete and the reflected signal is monitored. Initially, most of the light is reflected by the iron layer. When corrosion occurs to remove the iron layer, {{a significant portion of the}} light power will leave the fiber at its exposed end, and the reflected power is greatly reduced. Monitoring of the reflected signal is hence an effective way to assess if the concrete environment at the location of the fiber tip may induce steel corrosion or not. In this thesis, the principle of the corrosion sensor and its fabrication are first described. The sensing principle is then verified by experimental results. Sensor packaging for practical installation is presented. For novel chloride control design, a series of holes are incorporated in the concrete cover. The holes are filled with circulating water to make their boundary free of chloride ions. When chloride ions penetrate into the concrete, most of the chloride ions are removed by water and the time for chloride concentration to reach the critical value is significantly increased. In this thesis, the concept of such an approach is first described. The feasibility of the principle is then verified by simulation results and a set of preliminary experiments...|$|R
40|$|Convolute {{lamination}} is {{a common}} fold structure within turbidite beds, attributed to the deformation of sediment during or soon after deposition of the host bed. Despite the prevalence of this feature, the formational processes are still not well understood. Possible mechanisms are investigated here through redescription and analysis of convolute lamination from the Aberystwyth Grits Group (Silurian, west Wales, UK), in which "convolute bedding" was first defined. Internal bed structures have been studied in clean coastal exposures and on high-resolution <b>optical</b> scans of <b>cut</b> surfaces. Convolute lamination occurs in intervals 2 - 10 cm thick, spanning {{the top of the}} very fine sand Bouma C division through the D division of interlaminated silt and clay. Observed growth geometries confirm that the structure formed during sedimentation of the host graded bed. Folds show a down-flow asymmetry and doubly-vergent diapiric geometries ("mushroom"-shaped structures). Grain size measurements from a modern turbidite (Icod bed, ~ 165 ka, Mor occan Turbidite System) suggest there is an optimal 'window' of average grain size and mud content parameter space, within which convolute lamination develops. It is proposed that this window coincides with a bed density inversion created during deposition of a graded bed as clean sand (with pore spaces infilled by water) fines upwards into mud-rich sand (with pores infilled by an increasing proportion of mud). Porosity decreases and bulk bed density correspondingly increases. The resulting unstable density gradient may lead to vertical buoyancy-driven overturn, manifest as growing folds. Subsequent amplification of the folds due to density differences and modification due to horizontal shear imposed by the depositing turbidity current may then occur. The bed density gradient stabilises with deposition of low permeability mud, suppressing further fold development. Quantitatively, both Rayleigh-Taylor instability and Kelvin-Helmholtz instability are theoretically possible in forming folds in this context...|$|R
