40|$|The final {{publication}} {{is available}} at Springer via [URL] exploit the natural distinction between the attacking and defensive aspects of tennis {{to get a better}} understanding of the origins of relative inefficiency. Attacking is simply when a player is serving and defending is when a player is returning serve. We use data envelopment analysis (DEA) to compute the attacking, defensive and <b>overall</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of the top 100 male professional players for the 2009 season. An analysis of the efficiency scores using non-parametric kernel smoothing suggests that there are four groups of players in the sample- those that are relatively efficient in attack and defence; those that are relatively inefficient in attack and defence; and those that are relatively efficient in attack or defence. Truncated regression equations for the technical and super attacking, defensive and <b>overall</b> <b>efficiencies</b> as a function of off-court variables (e. g. height, age, etc.) suggest that being a left-handed player has a significant positive effect on the <b>overall</b> <b>efficiencies...</b>|$|R

Both the TWT and multistage depressed collector (MDC) efficiencies were measured, {{as well as the}} MDC current, dissipated thermal power, and DC input power distributions, for the TWT operating both at saturation over its bandwidth and over its full dynamic range. Relatively high collector efficiencies were obtained, leading to a very substantial improvement in the <b>overall</b> TWT <b>efficiency.</b> In spite of large fixed TWT body losses (due largely to the 6 to 8 percent beam interception), average <b>overall</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of 45 to 47 percent (for three to five collector stages) were obtained at saturation across the 2. 5 -, to 5. 5 -GHz operating band.

Three gasification configurations were studied via process modeling: the (product) recycle, the (secondary) methanation, and the combined (recycle and methanation) mode.

25|$|The {{design of}} the {{evaporator}} and condenser heat exchangers is also {{very important to the}} <b>overall</b> <b>efficiency</b> of the heat pump. The heat exchange surface areas and the corresponding temperature differential (between the refrigerant and the air stream) directly affect the operating pressures and hence the work the compressor has {{to do in order to}} provide the same heating or cooling effect.

25|$|Solar cell {{efficiencies}} {{vary from}} 6% for amorphous silicon-based solar cells to 44.0% with multiple-junction concentrated photovoltaics. Solar cell energy conversion efficiencies for commercially available photovoltaics are around 14–22%. Concentrated photovoltaics (CPV) may reduce cost by concentrating up to 1,000 suns (through magnifying lens) onto a smaller sized photovoltaic cell. However, such {{concentrated solar power}} requires sophisticated heat sink designs, otherwise the photovoltaic cell overheats, which reduces its efficiency and life. To further exacerbate the concentrated cooling design, the heat sink must be passive, otherwise the power required for active cooling would reduce the <b>overall</b> <b>efficiency</b> and economy.|$|E
25|$|The process only breaks long {{molecular}} chains into shorter ones, {{so small}} molecules such as carbon dioxide or methane cannot {{be converted to}} oil through this process. However, the methane in the feedstock is recovered and burned to heat the water that {{is an essential part}} of the process. In addition, the gas can be burned in a combined heat and power plant, consisting of a gas turbine which drives a generator to create electricity, and a heat exchanger to heat the process input water from the exhaust gas. The electricity can be sold to the power grid, for example under a feed-in tariff scheme. This also increases the <b>overall</b> <b>efficiency</b> of the process (already said to be over 85% of feedstock energy content).|$|E

25|$|A {{refrigeration}} system's {{coefficient of}} performance (CoP) {{is very important in}} determining a system's <b>overall</b> <b>efficiency.</b> It is defined as refrigeration capacity in kW divided by the energy input in kW. While CoP is a very simple measure of performance, it is typically not used for industrial refrigeration in North America. Owners and manufacturers of these systems typically use performance factor (PF). A system's PF is defined as a system's energy input in horsepower divided by its refrigeration capacity in TR. Both CoP and PF can be applied to either the entire system or to system components. For example, an individual compressor can be rated by comparing the energy needed to run the compressor versus the expected refrigeration capacity based on inlet volume flow rate. It {{is important to note that}} both CoP and PF for a refrigeration system are only defined at specific operating conditions, including temperatures and thermal loads. Moving away from the specified operating conditions can dramatically change a system's performance.|$|E
25|$|The {{efficiency}} of any system {{depends on the}} definition of the boundaries of the system. For an electrical energy customer the {{efficiency of}} electric space heating is almost 100% because almost all purchased energy is converted to building heat (the only exception being fan noise and indication lights which demand very little electricity and virtually none at all when compared to the extremely large energy draw of the heating itself). However, if a power plant supplying electricity is included, the <b>overall</b> <b>efficiency</b> drops drastically. For example, a fossil-fuel power station may only deliver 3 units of electrical energy for every 10 units of fuel energy released. Even though the electric heater is 100% efficient, the amount of fuel needed to produce electric heat is more than if the fuel was burned in a furnace or boiler at the building being heated. If the same fuel could be used for space heating by a consumer, it would be more efficient overall to burn the fuel at the end user's building. On the other hand, replacing electric heating with fossil fuel burning heaters, isn't necessary good as it removes the ability to have renewable electric heating, this can be achieved by sourcing the electricity from a renewable source.|$|E

40|$|Performance of {{multistage}} depressed collectors (MDCs) using textured carbon on copper substrate electrode surfaces {{was evaluated}} {{in conjunction with}} medium-power traveling wave tubes (TWTs).

Long-term stability of the carbon-coated copper electrode surfaces was investigated by periodic evaluation of TWT-MDC performance {{over an extended period}} of continuous wave (CW) operation. Application of textured carbon coating on copper MDC electrode surfaces produced a 13 % improvement in both MDC and TWT <b>overall</b> <b>efficiencies</b> for the TWT-MDC tests. During 1600 hr of CW operation with a medium power TWT, no significant changes in MDC performance were noted. This indicated good stability of the textured carbon electrode surfaces.

This {{was a result}} of another Bulleid labour-saving innovation, a sliding hatch controlled from the front cab, that enabled ash to be cleaned out via a chute onto the track when the locomotive was on the move. The problem lay with ash gathering {{around the edges of the}} slide, allowing air to leak into the smokebox, thereby reducing the <b>overall</b> <b>efficiency</b> of the locomotive. The fierce blast from the exhaust also meant that ash and embers were ejected into the atmosphere, creating a potential lineside fire hazard.|$|E
500|$|The {{arrangement}} {{consisted of}} a modified Standard Class 7 boiler, with smaller steel cylinders and other modifications to save weight and hence increase route availability.

[...] A single chimney was incorporated into the design, although this was to create problems later on, due to its small diameter, which reduced the choke area that allowed the fierce exhaust blast to escape, reducing the <b>overall</b> <b>efficiency</b> of the locomotive. Similarities with the Britannias rested with the frames, tenders and running gear, allowing easy standardisation of parts common with other classes.
