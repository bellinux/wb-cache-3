25|$|The furnace {{was placed}} in the space between the tube banks. Early boilers were {{manually}} coal fired, later <b>oil</b> <b>fired.</b> The boiler was enclosed in a sealed casing of steel, lined with firebricks. Brick-lined end walls to this casing housed the firedoors or oil burner quarls, but had no heating surface. The uptake flue from the boiler was in the centre top of the casing, the exhaust gases passing around the steam drum. To reduce corrosion from flue gases over the drum, it was sometimes wrapped in a simple deflector shroud. Usually {{the lower part of the}} water drums were exposed outside the casing, but only the ends of the steam drum emerged. The water level was at around one-third of the steam drum diameter, enough to cover the ends of the submerged water-tubes.|$|E

25|$|The first Industrial Revolution {{merged into}} the Second Industrial Revolution around 1850, when {{technological}} and economic progress gained momentum {{with the development}} of steam-powered ships and railways, and later in the 19th century with the internal combustion engine and electric power generation. The Second Industrial Revolution was a phase of the Industrial Revolution; labeled as the separate Technical Revolution. From a technological and a social point of view there is no clean break between the two. Major innovations during the period occurred in the chemical, electrical, petroleum, and steel industries. Specific advancements included the introduction of <b>oil</b> <b>fired</b> steam turbine and internal combustion driven steel ships, the development of the airplane, the practical commercialization of the automobile, mass production of consumer goods, the perfection of canning, mechanical refrigeration and other food preservation techniques, and the invention of the telephone.|$|E
500|$|George Washington was reacquired for Navy {{use from}} the United States Maritime Commission on 28 January 1941 and {{commissioned}} as USS Catlin (AP-19) on 13 March 1941. She was {{named in honor}} of Brigadier General Albertus W. Catlin, USMC. It was found, however, that the coal-burning engines did not give the required speed for protection against submarines, and she was decommissioned on 26 September 1941. Because of their great need for ships in 1941, Great Britain took the ship over under Lend-Lease on 29 September 1941 as George Washington, but they found after one voyage to Newfoundland that her aging boilers could not safely maintain sufficient steam pressure to drive her otherwise servicable engines. [...] A secondary contributing factor was the difficulty in manning her with sufficient skilled stokers– the role having been supplanted with the steady introduction of <b>oil</b> <b>fired</b> ships in the 1930s. [...] With the ship unfit for combat service the British returned her to the War Shipping Administration (WSA) on 17 April 1942.|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} a {{flexible}} design of multi-nozzle arrangement of water mist {{fire suppression system}} was studied. The source of fire was a 65 mm diameter cooking <b>oil</b> <b>fire.</b> An investigation {{on the impact of}} nozzle arrangement on the temperature profile of fires was conducted. The occurance of oil splash due to the application of water mist was also studied. The water mist systems developed in the present work can effectively extinguish cooking <b>oil</b> <b>fires</b> and prevented them from re-ignition.

2500|$|Under her new owners, the Northern Pacific Steamship Company, Victoria began {{operating}} out of Puget Sound in Washington state. In 1898, she was resold to the North American Mail Steamship Company and transferred to American registry. Due to this, Victoria {{was used as a}} troopship in the Spanish American War, carrying troops to Manila in the Philippines. In 1900, she served with various owners along a route from Puget Sound to Nome, Alaska until she ended up with the Alaska Steamship Company in 1908. Victoria was then operated between San Francisco, California to Nome, Alaska, via Seattle, Washington. In 1924, the Victoria, now 54 years old, underwent a massive refit, which added <b>oil</b> <b>fired</b> boilers, larger superstructure and an enclosed bridge to her ageing hull.|$|E
2500|$|The rebuilt Powhatan, renamed Cuba, {{underwent}} {{trials and}} began operation in late 1920 as the world's first passenger ship {{with an electric}} drive. In addition to the propulsion being electric Cuba was to be electrically lit with all auxiliary machinery being electric. On trials with the propulsion motor delivering full 3,000 horsepower the ship attained a speed of 17.28 knots. Electric power was provided by a steam plant of four Scotch boilers, each with three <b>oil</b> <b>fired</b> furnaces, driving a General Electric eight stage turbo-generator set which in turn provided power at 1,100 volts, 1,234 amperes rated at 2,350 kilowatts delivering 50 cycle alternating current to the General Electric synchronous type electric motor with a rated 3,000 horsepower running at 1,150 volts and 1,180 amperes driving the shaft and [...] four bladed propeller.

2500|$|In {{order to}} keep the higher {{portions}} of the Sierra grade open in the winter, [...] of timber snow sheds were built between Blue Cañon and Truckee in addition to utilizing snowplows pushed by locomotives, as well as manual shovelling. With the advent of more efficient <b>oil</b> <b>fired</b> steam and later diesel electric power to drive plows, flangers, spreaders, and rotary snow plows, most of the wooden snowsheds have long since been removed as obsolete. Tunnels 1–5 and 13 of the original 1860s tunnels on Track 1 of the Sierra grade remain in use today, while additional new tunnels were later driven when the grade was double tracked over {{the first quarter of the}} twentieth century. In 1993, the Southern Pacific Railroad (which operated the CPRR-built Oakland–Ogden line until its 1996 merger with the UP) closed and pulled up the [...] section of Track #1 over the summit running between the Norden complex (Shed 26, MP 192.1) and the covered crossovers in Shed #47 (MP 198.8) about a mile east of the old flyover at Eder, bypassing and abandoning the tunnel 6–8 complex, the concrete snowsheds just beyond them, and tunnels 9–12 ending at MP 195.7, all of which had been located on Track 1 within two miles of the summit. Since then all east- and westbound traffic has been run over the Track #2 grade crossing the summit about one mile (1.6km) south of Donner Pass through the [...] Tunnel #41 (aka [...] ) running under Mt. Judah between Soda Springs and Eder, which was opened in 1925 when the summit section of the grade was double tracked. This routing change was made because the Track 2 and Tunnel 41 Summit crossing is far easier and less expensive to maintain and keep open in the harsh Sierra winters.|$|E
