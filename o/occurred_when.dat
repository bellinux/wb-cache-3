5|$|Han-era astronomers {{adopted a}} geocentric {{model of the}} universe, theorizing that it was shaped like a sphere {{surrounding}} the earth in the center. They assumed that the Sun, Moon, and planets were spherical and not disc-shaped. They also thought that the illumination of the Moon and planets was caused by sunlight, that lunar eclipses <b>occurred</b> <b>when</b> the Earth obstructed sunlight falling onto the Moon, and that a solar eclipse <b>occurred</b> <b>when</b> the Moon obstructed sunlight from reaching the Earth. Although others disagreed with his model, Wang Chong accurately described the water cycle of the evaporation of water into clouds.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Irene passed {{near the}} northwestern Bahamas, causing {{moderate}} flooding and spawning a few tornadoes. One tornado caused damage in Marsh Harbour and killed one on Abaco island. Four indirect deaths <b>occurred</b> <b>when</b> a truck drove off a wet pier during a downpour.|$|E

5|$|Well-executed {{evacuations}} and warnings {{limited the}} death toll to six, while damage amounted to $305.8million (1998USD, $409.8million 2009USD). In addition to the six human lives lost, 497 heads of cattle and 21,387 chickens were killed. All six human deaths were indirectly related to Georges; the first death <b>occurred</b> <b>when</b> an 61-year-old woman stepped on a downed wire and was electrocuted; the second <b>occurred</b> <b>when</b> a 56-year-old man drove over another downed wire on his motorcycle and was electrocuted.|$|E

5|$|A less {{contentious}} standoff also <b>occurred</b> <b>when</b> settlers sent by William Penn {{sought to}} establish {{what is now}} Burlington, New Jersey. Andros insisted they {{had no right to}} settle there without the duke's permission, but agreed to allow their settlement after they agreed to receive commissions falling under the authority of the New York gubernatorial administration. This situation was permanently resolved in 1680 when York renounced in favor of Penn his remaining claims to West Jersey.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} six deaths in {{incidents}} related to Patricia were reported in the state. Two of these deaths <b>occurred</b> <b>when</b> a tree toppled over in the storm's powerful winds. A woman was also hospitalized after sustaining injuries in the same incident. Another four {{people were killed in}} an automobile accident in southern Jalisco. Two of the victims died in the wreckage and the other two died after being brought to a hospital.|$|E
5|$|Although Josephine {{remained}} well offshore {{of the eastern}} United States, the effects from the storm and an area of high pressure produced strong winds and high seas along the coast. In North Carolina, high tides caused severe beach erosion and minor damage to ocean-front houses. Minor coastal flooding occurred in New York and New Jersey. In addition, one fatality <b>occurred</b> <b>when</b> a man drowned after falling off his boat while sailing a river in Massachusetts.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the war was}} {{entering}} its final stages, the squadron still had to watch for anti-aircraft artillery. The fighter squadrons continued to make advances until February, {{while waiting for the}} Canadian push through the Reichwald. Although there was some aerial fighting, the major conflict with the Luftwaffe <b>occurred</b> <b>when</b> the Canadians started to cross the Rhine on 24 March 1945.|$|E
5|$|Another {{division}} among Christians <b>occurred,</b> <b>when</b> Leo III {{ordered the}} destruction of icons throughout the Empire. This led to a significant religious crisis, which ended in mid-9th century with the restoration of icons. During the same period, {{a new wave of}} pagans emerged in the Balkans, originating mainly from Slavic people. These were gradually Christianised, and by Byzantium's late stages, Eastern Orthodoxy represented most Christians and, in general, most people in what remained of the Empire.|$|E
5|$|Another major {{infusion}} of Arabian horses into Europe <b>occurred</b> <b>when</b> the Ottoman Turks sent 300,000 horsemen into Hungary in 1522, {{many of whom}} were mounted on pure-blooded Arabians, captured during raids into Arabia. By 1529, the Ottomans reached Vienna, where they were stopped by the Polish and Hungarian armies, who captured these horses from the defeated Ottoman cavalry. Some of these animals provided foundation bloodstock for the major studs of eastern Europe.|$|E

5|$|As is {{discussed}} below, {{the reason for}} the delay was probably simply that neither the Athenians nor the Persians were willing to risk battle initially. This then raises the question of why the battle <b>occurred</b> <b>when</b> it did. Herodotus explicitly tells us that the Greeks attacked the Persians (and the other sources confirm this), {{but it is not clear}} why they did this before the arrival of the Spartans. There are two main theories to explain this.|$|E
5|$|Because Titus {{effectively}} {{acted as}} co-emperor with his father, no abrupt change in Flavian policy <b>occurred</b> <b>when</b> Vespasian died on 23 June 79.

5|$|During the {{bombardment}} a small naval engagement <b>occurred</b> <b>when,</b> at 09:05, the obsolete Glasgow fired upon the St George using her armament of 7 nine-pounder guns and a Gatling gun, {{which had been}} a present from Queen Victoria to the sultan. The return fire caused Glasgow to sink, though the shallow harbour meant that her masts remained out of the water. Glasgows crew hoisted a British flag as a token of their surrender, {{and they were all}} rescued by British sailors in launches. Thrush also sank two steam launches whose Zanzibari crews shot at her with rifles. Some land fighting <b>occurred</b> <b>when</b> Khalid's men fired on Raikes' askaris, with little effect, as they approached the palace. The fighting ceased {{with the end of the}} shelling. The British controlled the town and the palace, and by the afternoon Hamud bin Muhammed, an Arab favourable to the British, had been installed as sultan with much reduced powers. The British ships and crews had fired around 500 shells, 4,100 machine gun rounds and 1,000 rifle rounds during the engagement.|$|E
50|$|Pleiotropy {{can arise}} from several {{distinct}} but potentially overlapping mechanisms, such as molecular gene pleiotropy, developmental pleiotropy, and selectional pleiotropy. Molecular gene pleiotropy <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> the gene product interacts with multiple other proteins or catalyzes multiple reactions. Developmental pleiotropy <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> mutations have multiple {{effects on the}} resulting phenotype. Selectional pleiotropy <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> the resulting phenotype has multiple effects on fitness (perhaps depending on age, gender, etc.).|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} asexual means of reproduction. Budding can <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> new {{individuals}} are formed from pieces that divide {{off from the}} pedal disc.

Division or fission can also <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> the corallimorph divides down the centre to form two new individuals.|$|R

5|$|In early 1920, {{the first}} Jewish-Arab {{dispute over the}} Wall <b>occurred</b> <b>when</b> the Muslim {{authorities}} were carrying out minor repair works to the Wall’s upper courses.
