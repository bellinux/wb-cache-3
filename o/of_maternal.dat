5|$|A parent's {{internal}} working {{model that}} is operative in the attachment {{relationship with her}} infant can be accessed by examining the parent's mental representations. Recent {{research has demonstrated that}} the quality <b>of</b> <b>maternal</b> attributions as markers <b>of</b> <b>maternal</b> mental representations can be associated with particular forms <b>of</b> <b>maternal</b> psychopathology and can be altered in a relative short time-period by targeted psychotherapeutic intervention.|$|E
5|$|Non-reproductive health {{remains an}} {{important}} predictor <b>of</b> <b>maternal</b> health. In the United States, the leading causes <b>of</b> <b>maternal</b> death are cardiovascular disease (15% of deaths), endocrine, respiratory and gastrointestinal disorders, infection, hemorrhage and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (Gronowski and Schindler, Table II).|$|E
5|$|A {{disparity}} in access to maternal care between {{rural and urban}} populations {{is one of the}} ramifications of a highly concentrated urban medical system. According to Government of India National Family Health Survey (NFHS II, 1998-1999) the maternal mortality in rural areas is approximately 132 percent the number <b>of</b> <b>maternal</b> mortality in urban areas.|$|E
50|$|She was baptised in the Throne Room of Buckingham Palace on 10 February 1841 (on her parents' first wedding anniversary) by the Archbishop of Canterbury, William Howley.

Her godparents were Queen Adelaide (her maternal grandfather's sister-in-law), King Leopold I <b>of</b> Belgium (<b>maternal</b> grandmother's brother, her great-uncle), Ernst I, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (paternal grandfather; for whom The Duke of Wellington, Tory Leader in the Lords, stood proxy), The Duke <b>of</b> Sussex (<b>maternal</b> grandfather's brother), The Duchess <b>of</b> Gloucester (<b>maternal</b> grandfather's sister) and The Duchess <b>of</b> Kent (<b>maternal</b> grandmother).|$|R
25|$|She was baptised on 14 May in the Church of Holmen in Copenhagen. The Princess's godparents were: King Christian X ({{paternal}} grandfather); Hereditary Prince Knud (paternal uncle); Prince Axel (her paternal grandfather's first cousin); King Gustaf V <b>of</b> Sweden (<b>maternal</b> great-grandfather); Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf <b>of</b> Sweden (<b>maternal</b> grandfather); Prince Gustaf Adolf, Duke <b>of</b> Västerbotten (her <b>maternal</b> uncle); Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn (maternal grandmother's father).|$|R
30|$|SDH {{mutations}} {{follow an}} autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. SDHD mutations are also subject to genomic imprinting <b>of</b> the <b>maternal</b> allele. Genomic imprinting <b>of</b> the <b>maternal</b> allele means the disease only manifests if the mutation is {{inherited from the}} father [13]. This may result in the disease skipping generations.|$|R
5|$|An infant's social {{environment}} relates {{to his or}} her later language development. Children's first words are closely linked to their early language experience. For children with typically developing language skills, there is a close match between maternal speech and their environment: up to 78% <b>of</b> <b>maternal</b> speech is matched to the object the child is focusing on. In children with delayed language development, only 50% <b>of</b> <b>maternal</b> speech is matched to the object the infant is focusing on. Infants are {{more likely to engage in}} joint attention when the parent talks about an object that the child is attending to as opposed to an object outside of the infant's attention. This increased level of joint attention aids in encouraging normal language development, including word comprehension and production. When joint attention is present, it plays an important role in word learning, a crucial aspect of language development.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to criticism, his ideas were often oversimplified, misrepresented, distorted or exaggerated for various purposes. This heightened the controversy. In 1962, the WHO published Deprivation <b>of</b> <b>Maternal</b> Care: A Reassessment of its Effects to which Mary Ainsworth, Bowlby's close colleague, contributed with his approval, {{to present the}} recent research and developments and to address misapprehensions.|$|E
5|$|The {{first set}} of {{relatives}} that had claim to an epikleros were the paternal uncles and any heirs of the uncles. Next in line were any sons of the sisters {{of the father and}} any of their heirs. Third in line were the grandsons of the father's paternal uncles, and following them the grandsons of the paternal aunts of the father. After these paternal relatives were exhausted, then the half-brothers of the father by the same mother were in line, then sons of the maternal half-sisters of the father. Seventh in line were the grandsons <b>of</b> <b>maternal</b> uncles of the father and then grandsons <b>of</b> <b>maternal</b> aunts of the father. It appears that if there were two or more relatives that were related in the same degree, the eldest of the similarly-related relatives had priority in claiming the epikleros.|$|E

5|$|Usually, {{warfarin}} is avoided in {{the first}} trimester, and a low molecular weight heparin such as enoxaparin is substituted. With heparin, risk <b>of</b> <b>maternal</b> haemorrhage and other complications are still increased, but heparins do not cross the placental barrier, so do not cause birth defects. Various solutions exist for the time around delivery.|$|E
5|$|Another {{issue is}} the role of {{inherited}} genetic factors in shaping attachments: for example one type of polymorphism of the gene coding for the D2 dopamine receptor has been linked to anxious attachment and another in the gene for the 5-HT2A serotonin receptor with avoidant attachment. This suggests that the influence <b>of</b> <b>maternal</b> care on attachment security is not the same for all children. One theoretical basis for this is that it makes biological sense for children to vary in their susceptibility to rearing influence.|$|E
5|$|Contraceptive use in {{developing}} countries is estimated to have decreased the number <b>of</b> <b>maternal</b> deaths by 40% (about 270,000 deaths prevented in 2008) and could prevent 70% of deaths if the full demand for birth control were met. These benefits are achieved by {{reducing the number of}} unplanned pregnancies that subsequently result in unsafe abortions and by preventing pregnancies in those at high risk.|$|E

5|$|In 2005 India {{enacted the}} National Rural Health Mission (NRHM). Some of its primary goals were to reduce infant {{mortality}} {{and also the}} maternal mortality ratio. Additionally, the NHRM aimed to create universal access to public health services and also balance the gender ratio. However, a 2011 research study conducted by Nair and Panda found that although India was able to improve some measures <b>of</b> <b>maternal</b> health since {{the enactment of the}} NHRM in 2005, the country was still far behind most emerging economies.|$|E
5|$|In England, {{prior to}} the nineteenth century, common law {{considered}} children to be the property of their father. However, {{the economic and social}} changes that occurred during the nineteenth century lead to a shift in ideas about the dynamics of the family. Industrialization separated the home and the workplace, keeping fathers away from their children in order to earn wages and provide for their family. Conversely, mothers were expected to stay in the home and care for the household and the children. Important social changes such as women's suffrage and child development theories allowed for ideas surrounding the importance <b>of</b> <b>maternal</b> care.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} mouse embryo, cytoplasmic {{polyadenylation}} <b>of</b> <b>maternal</b> RNAs from the egg cell allows the cell {{to survive and}} grow even though transcription does not start {{until the middle of}} the 2-cell stage (4-cell stage in human). In the brain, cytoplasmic polyadenylation is active during learning and could play a role in long-term potentiation, which is the strengthening of the signal transmission from a nerve cell to another in response to nerve impulses and is important for learning and memory formation.|$|E

5|$|Sigmund Freud {{may have}} been among the first to stress the {{potential}} effect of loss of the mother on the developing child, but his concern was less with the actual experience <b>of</b> <b>maternal</b> care than with the anxiety the child might feel about the loss of the nourishing breast. As little of Freud's theory was based on actual observations of infants, little effort was made to consider the effects of real experiences of loss.|$|E
5|$|The lack <b>of</b> <b>maternal</b> health {{contributes}} to future economic disparities for {{mothers and their}} children. Poor maternal health often affects a child’s health in adverse ways and also decreases a woman’s ability to participate in economic activities. Therefore, national health programmes such as the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) and the Family Welfare Programme have been created to address the maternal health care needs of women across India.|$|E
5|$|Antibody {{tests in}} {{children}} younger than 18months are typically inaccurate due to the continued presence <b>of</b> <b>maternal</b> antibodies. Thus HIV infection can only be diagnosed by PCR testing for HIV RNA or DNA, or via testing for the p24 antigen. Much of the world lacks access to reliable PCR testing and many places simply wait until either symptoms develop or the child is old enough for accurate antibody testing. In sub-Saharan Africa as of 2007–2009 between 30 and 70% of the population were aware of their HIV status. In 2009, between 3.6 and 42% {{of men and women}} in Sub-Saharan countries were tested which represented a significant increase compared to previous years.|$|E

5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning in {{pregnant women}} may cause severe adverse fetal effects. Poisoning causes fetal tissue hypoxia by decreasing the release <b>of</b> <b>maternal</b> oxygen to the fetus. Carbon monoxide also crosses the placenta and combines with fetal hemoglobin, causing more direct fetal tissue hypoxia. Additionally, fetal hemoglobin has a 10 to 15% higher affinity for carbon monoxide than adult hemoglobin, causing more severe poisoning in the fetus {{than in the}} adult. Elimination of carbon monoxide is slower in the fetus, leading to an accumulation of the toxic chemical. The level of fetal morbidity and mortality in acute carbon monoxide poisoning is significant, so despite mild maternal poisoning or following maternal recovery, severe fetal poisoning or death may still occur.|$|E
5|$|Health {{indicators}} in Ratanakiri are {{the worst}} in Cambodia. Life expectancy is 39 years for men and 43 years for women. Malaria, tuberculosis, intestinal parasites, cholera, diarrhea, and vaccine-preventable diseases are endemic. Ratanakiri has very high rates <b>of</b> <b>maternal</b> and child mortality; in Ratanakiri and neighboring Mondulkiri (whose figures were combined {{in the most recent}} survey), over 10% of children die before the age of five. Ratanakiri also has the country's highest rates of severe malnutrition. Ratanakiri residents' poor health can be attributed to a variety of factors, including poverty, remoteness of villages, poor quality medical services, and language and cultural barriers that prevent Khmer Loeu from obtaining medical care. The province has one referral hospital, 10 health centers, and 17 health posts. Medical equipment and supplies are minimal, and most health facilities are staffed by nurses or midwives, who are often poorly trained and irregularly paid.|$|E
5|$|In archaeology, {{the study}} of {{mortuary}} context, that is, {{the interpretation of the}} postmortem treatment of the dead, whether an individual or as pertains to patterns within a group, has {{led to the development of}} hypotheses on social status and/or hierarchy regarding many cultures, ancient and extant. In addition, the determination of whether or not delivery actually occurred prior to death has a bearing on analyses of the mother's population, as the concentration of trace elements differ markedly between the skeletons of prepartum adult women (before giving birth) and women who are lactating; the identification of coffin birth would lead to more accurate analyses of the number of lactating women in a population or the rate <b>of</b> <b>maternal</b> mortality. It is therefore necessary for investigators to be able to recognize postmortem fetal extrusion when encountered in an excavated burial.|$|E
