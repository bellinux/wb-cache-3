5|$|In December 1989, the Palais Rohan {{hosted the}} dinner {{parties of the}} heads of state of the European Council, {{including}} François Mitterrand, Helmut Kohl, Margaret Thatcher, Giulio Andreotti and Felipe González. Twenty years later, before the 2009 Strasbourg–Kehl summit, it {{was the site of}} a meeting between French President Nicolas Sarkozy and American President Barack Obama as well as their wives Carla Bruni and Michelle Obama. In the 21st century, the palace was the setting for the <b>official</b> <b>dinner</b> for the 2016 Fed Cup finalists, the gala dinners for the 20th and the 25th anniversary of Eurimages, as well as other festive receptions, since it can be booked for such occasions from the municipality.|$|E
25|$|In 1777, {{thirteen}} gunshots {{were fired}} in salute, once at morning {{and once again}} as evening fell, on July 4 in Bristol, Rhode Island. Philadelphia celebrated the first anniversary in a manner a modern American would find familiar: an <b>official</b> <b>dinner</b> for the Continental Congress, toasts, 13-gun salutes, speeches, prayers, music, parades, troop reviews, and fireworks. Ships in port were decked with red, white, and blue bunting.|$|E
25|$|Gaddafi {{also took}} part in the G8 summit in L'Aquila in July as Chairman of the African Union. During the summit a warm {{handshake}} between US President Barack Obama and Muammar Gaddafi took place (the first time the Libyan leader had been greeted by a serving US president). Later, at the summit's <b>official</b> <b>dinner</b> hosted by President Giorgio Napolitano, US and Libyan leaders upset protocol by sitting next to Italian Prime Minister and G8 host Berlusconi. (According to protocol, Gaddafi should have sat three places away from Berlusconi).|$|E

25|$|On 19 July 1870 the Franco-Prussian War broke out; {{it would}} lead to the fall of the Second French Empire. As in {{previous}} conflicts against Denmark and Austria, Frederick participated actively in the fight against the French. At the head of the 3rd German army, he had a decisive role in the battles of Wissembourg (4 August 1870) and Wörth (6 August 1870), and also had a notorious role in the Battle of Sedan (1 September 1870) during the siege of Paris. Jealous of the military success of the heir to the throne, Bismarck tried to undermine his prestige. The Chancellor used the late arrival of 3rd German army to Paris to accuse the Crown Prince of trying to protect France under pressure from his mother and his wife. During an <b>official</b> <b>dinner,</b> Bismarck accused the Queen and the Crown Princess of being ardently francophile, an incident that was soon known by the newspapers.|$|E
500|$|During {{their time}} in America, Marie, Nicholas and Ileana {{undertook}} tours of several cities, including Philadelphia. They were very popular, and were greeted with equal enthusiasm in each city they visited, {{so much so that}} [...] " [...] seemed fairly dazed by their tremendous ovation". At the White House, the <b>official</b> <b>dinner</b> was marked by awkward moments, due to the morose attitude of President Calvin Coolidge and his wife Grace; Marie lingered less than two hours. Before leaving the United States, Marie was presented with a bullet-proof armored town car by Willys-Knight, which she joyfully accepted. On 24 November, Marie and her children were seen off by a delegation from Washington, D.C., as they prepared to leave by ship from New York Harbour. Morris wrote that [...] "our last view was of Her Majesty, her children on either side, waving back with that tear-and-smile of those who pass from happy scenes." [...] Morris accompanied the queen throughout her journey and offered a very detailed account of Marie's time in America in her book, published in 1927.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2004, McCaughey {{attended}} an <b>official</b> <b>dinner</b> with President of Ireland Mary McAleese in Aras an Uachtarain, the Presidential residence in Dublin. McCaughey {{declared that he}} intended [...] "to invite the President to visit the staunchly Protestant Ballee and Harryville areas of Ballymena". McCaughey then withdrew the invitation because of McAleese's [...] "Holocaust Day speech in which she compared Protestant prejudice towards Catholics to the Nazi hatred of Jews".|$|E

It was the first visit {{by members of the}} Royal Family to [...] "a former Warsaw Pact country". They attended a dinner hosted by interim President Árpád Göncz and viewed a fashion display at the Museum of Applied Arts in Budapest. Peto Institute was among the places that were visited by the Princess, and she presented its director with an honorary OBE. In November 1990, the royal couple went to Japan to attend the enthronement of Emperor Akihito.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{political}} observers and analysts have questioned Clark's {{rationale for the}} decision. One famous incident involved a 1987 <b>official</b> <b>dinner</b> held for Prince Charles at Rideau Hall. When the Prince met Clark in the receiving line at the function, he asked to Clark: [...] "why wasn't two thirds enough?" [...] Clark's wife, Maureen McTeer, elaborated on Clark's decision in her 2003 autobiography, In My Own Name. McTeer suggested that for her husband, {{anything less than a}} 75% endorsement would not have been a clear enough mandate to forge onwards from the party membership. Clark feared that the 34% of PC members who did not support him would become his most vocal critics in the upcoming election campaign, and that his continued leadership would have led to fractures in the party. Clark was convinced that he could win another leadership race and gain a clear level of support, once his qualities were compared against the handful of politically inexperienced challengers who coveted his position and who were covertly undermining his leadership.|$|E

60|$|Although not an <b>official</b> <b>dinner,</b> all {{the twelve}} gentlemen who sat down were, with the {{exception}} of Nat, connected with the admiralty. The first lord and several other admirals were there, the others were heads of departments and post-captains.|$|E

60|$|Meanwhile the sagacious man in {{the tents}} of the tories, whose course was so neatly chalked out for him by sulky {{followers}} not relishing his lead, was, we may be sure, entirely wide-awake, watching currents, gales, and puffs of wind without haste, without rest. Disraeli made a bold stroke for party consolidation by inviting to his <b>official</b> <b>dinner</b> {{at the opening of}} the session of 1857, General Peel, the favourite brother of the great minister and his best accredited representative. Peel consulted Mr. Gladstone on the reply to Disraeli's invitation, and found him strongly adverse. The public, said Mr. Gladstone, views with much jealousy every change of political position not founded on previous parliamentary co-operation for some national object. Mr. Gladstone might have put it on the narrower ground that attendance at the dinner would be an explicit condonation of Disraeli's misdeeds ten years before, and a direct acceptance of his leadership henceforth.|$|E
25|$|The State Apartments, {{also known}} as the Apartment for Festivities, are {{on the second floor of}} the {{northern}} row and are used for the Royal Couple's receptions and representation. <b>Official</b> <b>dinners</b> are held in the Charles XI's Gallery on such occasions as state visits, after elections to the Riksdag and for the Nobel laureates. Since 1950, it is used as the main banqueting room of the palace and can accommodate about 200 seated guests. Five to ten <b>official</b> <b>dinners</b> are held in the gallery each year. A couple of times each year a Cabinet Meeting is held with the Swedish government in the Cabinet Meeting Room. The apartment was originally designed as the Royal Couple's apartment, but when King Adolf Frederick and Queen Lovisa Ulrika moved into the palace in 1754, they chose to stay in the part now known as the Bernatotte Apartments.

50|$|State and <b>official</b> <b>dinners</b> are {{dictated}} by strict protocol {{in order to}} ensure that no diplomatic gaffes occur. The Chief of Protocol of the United States, who is an official within the United States Department of State, the White House Chief Usher, who is head of the household staff at the White House, as well as the White House Social Secretary all oversee the planning of state and <b>official</b> <b>dinners</b> from beginning to end. The Graphics and Calligraphy Office located in the East Wing of the White House also bears numerous responsibilities. The White House Chief Calligrapher creates place cards with the names of the guests who are assigned seats around the tables in the State Dining Room. The Chief Calligrapher also designs and writes formal invitations that are mailed to the postal addresses of the guests. State dinners require close coordination between the White House Executive Chef and the White House Executive Pastry Chef who plan and prepare a four or five-course meal, as well as the White House Chief Floral Designer who arranges flowers and decorations on the candle-lit tables.|$|R

At <b>official</b> <b>dinners,</b> it is said she [...] "smiled at the small incongruities committed during these meals by the uncouth Bulgarian notabilities of those days, and she contrived somehow by her tact, and without ever wounding any one among them, to teach them that peas {{are not to be}} eaten with one's knife, and that it is not altogether the thing to drink from the finger-bowl." ...|$|R
