5|$|Although {{psychodrama}} is {{not widely}} practiced, {{the work done}} by practitioners of psychodrama has opened the doors to research possibilities for other psychological concepts such as group therapy and expansion {{of the work of}} Sigmund Freud.

5|$|Although {{there is}} no known cure for {{multiple}} sclerosis, several therapies have proven helpful.

Alternative treatments are pursued by some people, despite the shortage of supporting evidence.|$|E

5|$|In {{the absence}} of officially {{recognized}} diagnostic criteria, and beyond the ambit of the discourse on a broader set of criteria discussed above, the term attachment disorder has been increasingly used by some clinicians {{to refer to a}} broader set of children whose behavior may be affected by lack of a primary attachment figure, a seriously unhealthy attachment relationship with a primary caregiver, or a disrupted attachment relationship. Although there are no studies examining diagnostic accuracy, concern is expressed as to the potential for over-diagnosis based on broad checklists and 'snapshots'. This form <b>of</b> <b>therapy,</b> including diagnosis and accompanying parenting techniques, is scientifically unvalidated and is not considered to be part of mainstream psychology or, despite its name, to be based on attachment theory, with which it is considered incompatible. It has been described as potentially abusive and a pseudoscientific intervention, that has resulted in tragic outcomes for children.|$|E
5|$|Some therapies {{for other}} forms of cancer {{increase}} the lifetime risk of endometrial cancer, which is a baseline 2â€“3%. Tamoxifen, a drug used to treat estrogen-positive breast cancers, {{has been associated with}} endometrial cancer in approximately 0.1% of users, particularly older women, but the benefits for survival from tamoxifen generally outweigh the risk of endometrial cancer. A one to two-year course of tamoxifen approximately doubles the risk of endometrial cancer, and a five-year course <b>of</b> <b>therapy</b> quadruples that risk. Raloxifene, a similar drug, did not raise the risk of endometrial cancer. Previously having ovarian cancer is a risk factor for endometrial cancer, as is having had previous radiotherapy to the pelvis. Specifically, ovarian granulosa cell tumors and thecomas are tumors associated with endometrial cancer.|$|E
