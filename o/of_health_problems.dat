5|$|There are {{a number}} of common misconceptions {{regarding}} sex and pregnancy. Douching after sexual intercourse is not an effective form of birth control. Additionally, it is associated with a number <b>of</b> <b>health</b> <b>problems</b> and thus is not recommended. Women can become pregnant the first time they have sexual intercourse and in any sexual position. It is possible, although not very likely, to become pregnant during menstruation.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} {{prevalence}} <b>of</b> mental <b>health</b> <b>problem</b> during first-half pregnancy. Study design: Cross-sectional descriptive study. Material and Method: The 255 singleton pregnant women < 20 weeks of gestation were enrolled. They {{were asked to}} complete a self-administered questionnaire which included Thai GHQ- 30 (mental <b>health</b> <b>problem</b> screening tool) and frequent psychosocial stressor forms. The prevalence and factors associated with mental <b>health</b> <b>problem</b> were evaluated. Main outcome measurement: The prevalence <b>of</b> mental <b>health</b> <b>problem.</b> Results: The prevalence <b>of</b> mental <b>health</b> <b>problem</b> was 17. 3 %. Factors independently associated with mental <b>health</b> <b>problem</b> included worrying about <b>health,</b> stress <b>of</b> taking care of other family members and financial problem with adjusted OR 3. 5 (95 % CI 1. 16, 10. 74), 3. 8 (95 % CI 1. 80, 7. 89) and 3. 2 (95 % CI 1. 34, 7. 53) respectively.

5|$|Several changes {{occurred}} in the early 1970s: Silver disbanded his group {{to spend more time}} with his wife and to concentrate on composing; he included lyrics in his recordings; and his interest in spiritualism developed. The last two of these were often combined, resulting in commercially unsuccessful releases such as The United States of Mind series. Silver left Blue Note after 28 years, founded his own record label, and scaled back his touring in the 1980s, relying in part on royalties from his compositions for income. In 1993, he returned to major record labels, releasing five albums before gradually withdrawing from public view because <b>of</b> <b>health</b> <b>problems.</b>|$|E
5|$|By {{winning the}} 1973 FA Cup Final, Sunderland {{qualified}} for the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, the club's only appearance in European competition to date. Sunderland beat Vasas Budapest 3–0 on aggregate, and were drawn against Lisbon club Sporting in the second round. They won the first leg at Roker Park 2–1 but were defeated 2–0 in the away leg, and were knocked out of the competition 3–2 on aggregate. After spending six seasons in the Second Division, Sunderland were promoted to Division One in the 1975–76 season; they topped the table over Bristol City by three points. However, Sunderland were relegated the following season back into Division Two, without their FA Cup Final winning manager Bob Stokoe, who had resigned because <b>of</b> <b>health</b> <b>problems</b> {{at the start of}} the season. The club celebrated its 100-year centenary in the 1979–80 season with a testimonial against an England XI side, which they lost 2–0.|$|E
40|$|This study tested whether {{childhood}} family instability {{is associated}} with mental <b>health</b> <b>problems</b> during adolescence through continued family instability and/or through a preadolescent onset <b>of</b> mental <b>health</b> <b>problems.</b> This test use data from a prospective population cohort of 2, 230 Dutch adolescents (M age = 11. 09, SD = 0. 56 at the initial assessment). Childhood family instability was associated with both internalizing problems and externalizing problems during late adolescence. The association between childhood family instability and adolescent mental <b>health</b> <b>problems</b> largely disappeared when controlling for preadolescent onset <b>of</b> mental <b>health</b> <b>problems</b> but only slightly when controlling for continued family instability during adolescence. These patterns were comparable for both types <b>of</b> mental <b>health</b> <b>problems</b> but relatively stronger for internalizing problems. These results suggest that growing up in an unpredictable family environment has long-lasting negative mental <b>health</b> effects, most <b>of</b> which are due to a preadolescent onset <b>of</b> mental <b>health</b> <b>problems...</b>|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} the detection, {{diagnosis and treatment}} <b>of</b> mental <b>health</b> <b>problems</b> by primary care physicians. The studies presented in this thesis reflect {{the spirit of the}} nineteen nineties. In this decade, first guidelines for diagnosis and treatment <b>of</b> mental <b>health</b> <b>problems,</b> in particular depression, in the primary care setting, were developed in The Netherlands and in other countries. The rationale for these guidelines is that enhancing recognition, diagnosis and treatment <b>of</b> mental <b>health</b> <b>problems,</b> will improve patients' prognosis. This detection-diagnosis-treatment-model, in essence a medical model, is the paradigm underlying the research described in this thesis. [...] . Zie: Summary. ...|$|R
5|$|In January 1995, R.E.M. {{set out on}} {{its first}} tour in six years. The tour was a huge {{commercial}} success, but the period was difficult for the group. On March 1, Berry collapsed on stage during a performance in Lausanne, Switzerland, having suffered a brain aneurysm. He had surgery immediately and recovered fully within a month. Berry's aneurysm {{was only the beginning}} of a series <b>of</b> <b>health</b> <b>problems</b> that plagued the Monster tour. Mills had to undergo abdominal surgery to remove an intestinal adhesion in July; a month later, Stipe had to have an emergency surgery to repair a hernia. Despite all the problems, the group had recorded the bulk of a new album while on the road. The band brought along eight-track recorders to capture its shows, and used the recordings as the base elements for the album. The final three performances of the tour were filmed at the Omni Coliseum in Atlanta, Georgia and released in home video form as Road Movie.|$|E
5|$|Victory in the 1984 Portuguese Cup final ensured Porto's {{return to}} the Cup Winners' Cup in 1984–85, but they were {{surprisingly}} knocked {{out in the first}} round by Welsh Cup runners-up Wrexham. In January 1985, having left his job because <b>of</b> <b>health</b> <b>problems,</b> Pedroto died; he was succeeded by his apprentice Artur Jorge. Porto won the 1984–85 Primeira Liga and qualified for the 1985–86 European Cup, where they first beat an Ajax side guided by Johan Cruyff and featuring Ronald Koeman, Frank Rijkaard and Marco van Basten. Porto then faced Barcelona in the second round; after a 2–0 loss at Camp Nou, Juary scored all three goals of Porto's 3–1 win, which was insufficient to avoid elimination on the away goals rule.|$|E
5|$|After nearly 40 {{years of}} service, Eichelberger retired with {{the rank of}} {{lieutenant}} general on 31 December 1948. In 1950, he moved to Asheville, North Carolina, where {{he lived with his}} wife Em {{for the rest of his}} life. He suffered from a number <b>of</b> <b>health</b> <b>problems,</b> including hypertension and diabetes, and had his gall bladder removed. His name appeared in a series of articles for the Saturday Evening Post on his campaigns in the Southwest Pacific, actually written by ghostwriter Milton MacKaye. They subsequently expanded the articles into a book, Our Jungle Road to Tokyo. The book sold reasonably well, and Harry Truman and Omar Bradley requested autographed copies. In 1951 he traveled to Hollywood, where he served as technical consultant on Francis Goes to West Point (1952) and The Day the Band Played (1952), but he was not altogether happy with the results. He turned his hand to writing articles about the Far East for Newsweek, but gave this away in 1954. He then worked on the lecture circuit, giving speeches about his experiences, but gave this up too in 1955. He campaigned for Richard Nixon in 1960.|$|E
40|$|This phenomenological study {{seeks to}} {{understand}} the perceptions and attitudes of Social Work students towards mental health at the Catholic University in Malawi. This study explores perceptions and attitudes towards persons with mental health problems; effective intervention strategies for mental <b>health</b> <b>problems</b> and help seeking behavior. These objectives are supported by two theoretical frameworks: Recovery Theory in relation to mental health and the Attitudes Theory. The research method is an exploratory qualitative design with multiple participants. Seventeen Social Work students were the unit of study, selected according to a purposive and discriminant sampling design. Data was collected using a semi-structured interview schedule, and recorded during an in-depth interview. This study brought to the fore the perceptions and attitudes of Social Work students <b>of</b> mental <b>health.</b> Participants indicated that they perceive mental <b>health</b> <b>problems</b> as a real illness citing genetics and biological factors; drug and alcohol abuse; and witchcraft/spirit possessions as the causes <b>of</b> mental <b>health</b> <b>problems,</b> with the commonality <b>of</b> mental <b>health</b> <b>problems</b> consolidating them as a real disease. Participants cited cognitive abilities and normality as indicators <b>of</b> mental <b>health</b> <b>problems.</b> Participants felt that recovery; interpersonal relationships and inclusion are significant aspects <b>of</b> mental <b>health</b> <b>problems.</b> Participants felt that effective treatment was dependent on the severity <b>of</b> the mental <b>health</b> <b>problem,</b> citing link to services and counseling as the roles of Social Workers in providing effective intervention. Participants {{indicated that they would}} seek professional help as well as encouraging their clients to seek professional help. Participants indicated that discrimination and segregation presents as a barrier for disclosure <b>of</b> mental <b>health</b> <b>problems</b> as well as treatment. Participants also indicated aggression and awareness as aspects <b>of</b> mental <b>health</b> <b>problems.</b> Participants stated that they can easily recognize psychosis...|$|R
