40|$|Since it is {{seen that}} the studies about the rapidly {{evolving}} and grow-ing service sector and service sector productivity measurement are inadequate; this study aims to be {{a guide to the}} employees of the sector and to the researchers interested in the area. This study fo-cuses on productivity measurement in service sector at enterprise level. In this context, the methodology of OMAX (<b>Objectives</b> <b>Matrix)</b> model is discussed and reinterpreted in detail. For measurement at enterprise level, the productivity of the Turkish Emergency Service, which is operating in health sector, was measured using the OMAX method. 1. The OMAX (<b>Objectives</b> <b>Matrix)</b> Method Productivity has traditionally been defined simply as the ratio between output and input. There is an abundance of research on productivity measurement in manufacturing operations (Hannula, 1999; Banker; Datar; Kaplan, 1989), whereas service productivity has been studied much less. Many challenges in the measurement of public service productivity have been identified. For example, the intangible nature of services and the complexity of service outputs have been regarded as key reasons for the lack of appropriate productivity measures (Jääskeläinen, 2009, 447). There are several productivity measurement methods in the literature at enterprise level although the application of the productivity concept in service organisations seems to be a rather complicated task. The <b>Objectives</b> <b>Matrix</b> 2 method is one of them. This method is often used on measuring of service systems. Numerous original applications of OMAX in a variety of contexts are associated with the work of the late James L. Riggs, founder and first director of the Oregon Productivity Center in the early 1980 s. Since then, additional applications have been carried out or suggested by others, including Carl Thor at the America...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we study semidefinite {{programming}} (SDP) models {{for a class}} of discrete and continuous quadratic optimization prob-lems in the complex Hermitian form. These problems capture a class of well–known combinatorial optimization problems, as well as problems in control theory. For instance, they include Max– 3 –Cut with arbi-trary edge weights (i. e. some of the edge weights might be negative). We present a generic algorithm and a unified analysis of the SDP re-laxations which allow us to obtain good approximation guarantees for our models. Specifically, we give an (k sin(pi/k)) 2 /(4 pi) –approximation algorithm for the discrete problem where the decision variables are k– ary and the <b>objective</b> <b>matrix</b> is positive semidefinite. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, this is the first known approximation result for this family of problems. For the continuous problem where the <b>objective</b> <b>matrix</b> is positive semidefinite, we obtain the well–known pi/ 4 result due to [2], and independently, [12]. However, our techniques simplify their analyses and provide a unified framework for treating these problems. In addition, we show {{for the first time that}} the integrality gap of the SDP relaxation is precisely pi/ 4. We also show that the unified analysis can be used to ob-tain an O(1 / log n) –approximation algorithm for the continuous problem in the case where the <b>objective</b> <b>matrix</b> is not positive semidefinite. ...|$|E

This paper will describe the application of the Intervention Mapping (IM) framework {{to the development of a}} childhood obesity prevention intervention for FCCHs METHODS: Following the IM protocol, six steps were completed in the planning and development of an intervention targeting FCCHs: needs assessment, formulation of change <b>objectives</b> <b>matrices,</b> selection of theory-based methods and strategies, creation of intervention components and materials, adoption and implementation planning, and evaluation planning RESULTS: Application of the IM process resulted in the creation of the Keys to Healthy Family Child Care Homes program (Keys), which includes three modules: Healthy You, Healthy Home, and Healthy Business.
