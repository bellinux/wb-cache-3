50|$|Obabika <b>old-growth</b> <b>forest</b> is an Eastern White Pine and Red Pine {{dominated}} <b>old-growth</b> <b>forest</b> at {{the north}} end of Obabika Lake, just west of the Temagami region of Ontario, Canada. At 2400 ha in size, is commonly considered to be the largest remaining white pine dominated <b>old-growth</b> <b>forest</b> in the world. It is also sometimes called Chee-Skon Lake <b>old-growth</b> <b>forest,</b> or Wakimika Triangle <b>old-growth</b> <b>forest.</b> This area was slated for logging in 1989 and was protected largely as a result of a blockade on Red Squirrel Road in which 344 protestors were arrested, including future Ontario premier Bob Rae. The oldest trees in the Obabika <b>old-growth</b> <b>forest</b> are confirmed to be at least 375 years old, but a diversity of age classes occur in this forest. Another important feature of the area is the spirit rock, a column of rock on the shore of Chee-Skon Lake that is of spiritual significance to the Teme-Augama Anishnabai people.|$|R

5|$|Prior to {{the arrival}} of European American {{settlers}} and explorers, the Allegheny Plateau region of West Virginia, lying {{to the west of the}} Allegheny and Cumberland mountain ranges of the Appalachian Mountains, was overlaid with <b>old-growth</b> <b>forests</b> consisting predominantly of deciduous mixed oaks and chestnut trees. The cove forests of the Appalachian Mountains were undisturbed for approximately 300 million years, and the ample moisture and deep soils of cove topography allowed for the proliferation of temperate broadleaf and mixed forest species.|$|E
5|$|Spongiforma thailandica is {{a species}} of fungus in the Boletaceae family, genus Spongiforma. The {{stemless}} sponge-like species, first described in 2009, was found in Khao Yai National Park in central Thailand, where it grows in soil in <b>old-growth</b> <b>forests.</b> The rubbery fruit body, which has a strong odor of coal-tar similar to Tricholoma sulphureum, consists of numerous internal cavities lined with spore-producing tissue. Phylogenetic analysis suggests the species {{is closely related to}} the Boletaceae genera Porphyrellus and Strobilomyces.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} <b>old-growth</b> <b>forests</b> with tree species and genera such as black oak, hickory, beech, cherry birch, sweetgum, red maple, and tuliptree. The forests also contain owls, bats, chipmunks, groundhogs, gypsy moths, rabbits, raccoons, opossums, coyotes. In addition, over 130 species of {{butterflies}} {{can be found}} in the park. In 1937, it was noted that the marshlands had fauna such as red-winged blackbirds, yellowthroats, green bottle flies, beetles, dragonflies, tadpoles, herons, kingfishers, and ospreys. Its flora included cattail, skunk cabbage, and moss.|$|E

5|$|Although fishers are {{competent}} tree climbers, {{they spend}} most of their time on the forest floor and prefer continuous forest to other habitats. Fishers have been found in extensive conifer forests typical of the boreal forest but are also common in mixed hardwood and conifer forests. Fishers prefer areas with continuous overhead cover with greater than 80% coverage and will avoid areas with less than 50% coverage. Fishers are more likely to be found in <b>old-growth</b> <b>forests.</b> Since female fishers require moderately large trees for denning, forests that have been heavily logged and have extensive second growth appears to be unsuitable for their needs.|$|E
5|$|The lower {{areas of}} the {{wilderness}} area are covered by a taiga forest of Scots pine. Less common trees include downy birch, goat willow, aspen and rowan. Logging {{in the past has}} mostly occurred in the southern part ("Kessi"), a large proportion of Vätsäri's forests being <b>old-growth</b> <b>forests.</b> The barren soil makes for poor growth conditions and most of the ground vegetation in the forests is subshrubs. One area with limestone rock features green spleenwort. The reserve is located in an area between a western and eastern vegetation zones, giving rise to unique combinations of species, such as Siberian spruce and red cottongrass.|$|E
5|$|Spongiforma is a genus of sponge-like {{fungi in}} the Boletaceae family. Newly {{described}} in 2009, the genus contains two species: S.thailandica and S.squarepantsii. The type species S.thailandica is known only from Khao Yai National Park in central Thailand, where it grows in soil in <b>old-growth</b> <b>forests</b> dominated by dipterocarp trees. The rubbery fruit bodies, {{which has a}} strong odour of coal-tar similar to Tricholoma sulphureum, consists of numerous internal cavities lined with spore-producing tissue. S.squarepantsii, described as new to science in 2011, is found in Malaysia. It produces sponge-like, rubbery orange fruit bodies with a fruity or musky odour. These fruit bodies will—like a sponge—resume their original shape if water is squeezed out. The origin of the specific name derives from its perceived resemblance to the cartoon character SpongeBob SquarePants. Apart from differences in distribution, S.squarepantsii differs from S.thailandica in its colour, odour, and spore structure.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Many forest-management {{practices}} have negative impacts on forest birds. Here we compare the bird communities between, first, an <b>old-growth</b> <b>forest</b> and a 30 -year-old monoculture conifer plantation, and secondly, an <b>old-growth</b> <b>forest</b> and an <b>old-growth</b> <b>forest</b> that was “improved ” silviculturally 9 years earlier. We collected data on tree species composition and variables important {{for analysis of}} forest structure. We sampled breeding birds using variable-distance transect and variable circular-plot methods, and recorded the microhabitat and food habits of each species. Results showed that the monoculture plantation held only 51. 5 % of the species found in <b>old-growth</b> <b>forest.</b> Bird species richness and density in the silviculturally improved forest were also lower than that in <b>old-growth</b> <b>forest.</b> Examining the avian guilds of these forest communities, we found that upperstory flycatching insectivores, upperstory gleaning insectivores, and ground-feeding omnivores all suffered severely in the managed forests, whereas upperstory trunk-probing insectivores and understory gleaning insectivores in-creased in numbers. Although the effects of forest improvement are less drastic for forest birds than conversion to monoculture, the alteration of forest structure still changed microhabitat and available resources. The implications of these findings for birds in southeast Asia and forestry practices elsewhere are discussed...|$|R

25|$|For {{what may}} have been {{hundreds}} of years, the South Fork Trinity River had a rich history of Native Americans. The river annually produced enormous salmon runs, one of the richest sub-basins in the Trinity watershed, and virgin <b>old-growth</b> <b>forests</b> covered most of the watershed. In the 19th century, many events the largest of which was the California Gold Rush spurred Europeans, Americans and others to flood the region in search of furs, and later gold. One particular trail crossed through the Yolla Bolly Mountains, then wound down to Hayfork Creek and west to the South Fork Trinity.|$|E
25|$|The {{arrival of}} James H. Perkins, {{a native of}} New Hampshire, in December 1845 was the {{beginning}} of the economic boom that would make Williamsport into a booming lumber city. Perkins had been a successful owner of a calico prints factory in Philadelphia prior to selling out and moving to the West Branch Susquehanna River Valley. Perkins and his business partner, John Leighton, set out with the goal of creating a large scale lumbering and milling operation. Perkins believed that Williamsport could be a major center in the lumber business, as it was surrounded by a plentiful supply of <b>old-growth</b> <b>forests</b> of hemlock, white pine and various hardwoods.|$|E
25|$|The land in and {{surrounding}} French Creek State Park was once dominated by <b>old-growth</b> <b>forests</b> of American chestnut. These trees were cleared, beginning in 1771, {{and used to}} make charcoal to feed the iron furnace at nearby Hopewell Furnace. The forests were allowed to regrow and were cleared again approximately every twenty-five years. The furnace was in operation for 112 years until 1883. The damage caused by the colliers had a long-lasting effect on the ecology of this section of southeastern Pennsylvania. The thickly wooded hillsides that once provided a habitat {{for a wide variety}} of woodland creatures were stripped bare. But the forest slowly began to grow back.|$|E
