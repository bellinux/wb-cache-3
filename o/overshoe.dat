25|$|Galoshes, {{also known}} as dickersons, gumshoes, or overshoes, are a type of rubber boot that is slipped over shoes {{to keep them from}} getting muddy or wet. In the United States, the word galoshes may be used interchangeably with boot, {{especially}} a rubberized boot. In the United Kingdom, however, a galosh is an <b>overshoe</b> made of a weatherproof material to protect a more vulnerable shoe underneath and keep the foot warm and dry.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Overshoes</b> (or [...] "booties") are {{flexible}} waterproof shoe coverings {{for use in}} wet weather. They {{are typically}} made from rubber or a stretchy synthetic and have a zip {{on the inside of}} the ankle. The fabric continues under the sole but is not intended for walking on, which would wear it out quickly. Most <b>overshoes</b> have a hole in the sole for clipless pedals. <b>Overshoes</b> are not to be confused with cleat covers. <b>Overshoes</b> go on the top of the shoes, while cleat covers go on the bottom.|$|R
50|$|These {{divisions}} are not fixed: some <b>overshoes</b> {{look more like}} whole foot clogs, like Spanish albarca, whilst other wooden soled clogs raise and protect clothing {{in the way that}} <b>overshoes</b> do, such as Japanese geta.|$|R

2500|$|Footwear {{during the}} 14th century {{generally}} {{consisted of the}} turnshoe, which was made out of leather. [...] It was fashionable for the toe of the shoe {{to be a long}} point, which often had to be stuffed with material to keep its shape. [...] A carved wooden-soled sandal-like type of clog or <b>overshoe</b> called a patten would often be worn over the shoe outdoors, as the shoe by itself was generally not waterproof.|$|E
2500|$|The word {{comes through}} French (galoche) and Latin from Greek and {{originally}} meant a shoemaker's last; literally [...] "wood" [...] + [...] "foot". [...] By the 14th century {{it had been}} transferred to English style clogs, that is those with a wooden sole and fabric (e.g. leather) upper. [...] By 1572 the term also applied to [...] "a Gallage or Patten"; that is, an <b>overshoe</b> with a shaped wooden base to raise the wearer's good shoes off the ground.|$|E
2500|$|The word {{could also}} be used as a term for a wooden soled shoe, that is a chopine or clog, as opposed to an <b>overshoe,</b> until at least the nineteenth century. [...] The word was also used for the {{traditional}} wooden outdoor shoes of Japan and other Asian countries. [...] What are in effect snowshoes for mud, as used by wildfowlers, boatmen, and Coast Guards may also be called pattens, or [...] "mud-pattens". [...] These are shaped boards attached to the sole of a shoe, which extend sideways well beyond the shape of the foot, and therefore are a different sort of footwear from the patten discussed here.|$|E

2500|$|An {{unconfirmed}} legend {{states that}} an Englishman named Radley invented galoshes. He suffered from rheumatism {{and wanted to}} keep his feet dry. While reading De Bello Gallico by Julius Caesar he noticed a description of protective cloth <b>overshoes</b> [...] "gallicae" [...] and decided {{to capitalize on the}} idea. He patented cloth <b>overshoes</b> reinforced with rubber to keep the feet dry.|$|R

[...] With the old <b>overshoe</b> {{in my hand}} I ran back into the room, where Mr. Larramie was still imploring the McKenna sister to get down from the bed. I stooped and thrust the shoe under as far as I could reach. Almost {{immediately}} I saw a movement in the shaggy mass in the corner. I wriggled the shoe, and a paw was slightly extended. Then I drew it away slowly from under the bed.|$|E

6000|$|When Ralph {{went to his}} room, that night, he {{immediately}} rang for his valet. Mok, who had reached the hotel from the police station but a few minutes before, answered the summons. When Ralph turned about and beheld the black man, his hair plastered with mud, his face plastered with mud, and what clothes he had on muddy, torn, and awry, with one foot wearing a great <b>overshoe</b> and the other bare, with both black arms entirely denuded of sleeves, with eyes staring from his head, and his whole form quivering and shaking, the young man started as if some afrit of the [...] "Arabian Nights" [...] had come at this dark hour to answer his call.|$|E

I haven't looked up our family tree, but I believe we were raised by grafting a gum <b>overshoe</b> on to a 30-cent table d'hote stalk of asparagus. You take a white bulldog with a Bourke Cockran air of independence about him and a rubber plant {{and there you have}} the fauna and flora of a flat. What the shamrock is to Ireland the rubber plant is to the dweller in flats and furnished rooms. We get moved {{from one place to another}} so quickly that the only way we can get our picture taken is with a kinetoscope. We are the vagrant vine and the flitting fig tree.

6000|$|When {{she came}} close {{and looked in}} she beheld indistinct forms racing up {{and down to the}} figure of the dance, the silence of their footfalls arising from their being <b>overshoe</b> in [...] "scroff"--that is to say, the powdery residuum from the storage of peat and other products, the {{stirring}} of which by their turbulent feet created the nebulosity that involved the scene. Through this floating, fusty debris of peat and hay, mixed with the perspirations and warmth of the dancers, and forming together a sort of vegeto-human pollen, the muted fiddles feebly pushed their notes, in marked contrast to the spirit with which the measure was trodden out. They coughed as they danced, and laughed as they coughed. Of the rushing couples there could barely be discerned more than the high lights--the indistinctness shaping them to satyrs clasping nymphs--a multiplicity of Pans whirling a multiplicity of Syrinxes; Lotis attempting to elude Priapus, and always failing.|$|E

6000|$|There {{were four}} of us who rode {{together}} through the storm; and Hollingsworth, who had agreed {{to be of the}} number, was accidentally delayed, and set forth at a later hour alone. As we threaded the streets, I remember how the buildings on either side seemed to press too closely upon us, insomuch that our mighty hearts found barely room enough to throb between them. The snowfall, too, looked inexpressibly dreary (I had almost called it dingy), coming down through an atmosphere of city smoke, and alighting on the sidewalk only to be moulded into the impress of somebody's patched boot or <b>overshoe.</b> Thus the track of an old conventionalism was visible on what was freshest from the sky. But when we left the pavements, and our muffled hoof-tramps beat upon a desolate extent of country road, and were effaced by the unfettered blast as soon as stamped, then there was better air to breathe. Air that had not been breathed once and again! air that had not been spoken into words of falsehood, formality, and error, like all the air of the dusky city! ...|$|E
