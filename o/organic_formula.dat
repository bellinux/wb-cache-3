40|$|The {{object of}} this {{abstract}} is to articulate my aesthetic approach to sculpting the human figure. Over the last 25 years I've carved. modeled and molded {{dozens and dozens}} of figures for private and corporate commiss ions. The most popular styles being naturalism, neo-classicism, and art deco, each requires a specific <b>organic</b> <b>formula</b> for establishing proportions, movement. gesture, and expressive content. In the pursuit of my master's abstract, I've decided to try throwing these concepts out the window in an attempt to create a freer, more dynamic and subsequently a more vital art form. This non-conformist attitude coincided with a project I was commissioned to do for Jeff Koons. I sculpted a monumental, multi-layered mound of Play-Doh. The experience sparked in me a fascination with the idea of plasticity and form. I wanted my figures to explore the expressive quality of the medium over the form. In many ways it's an attempt to break the bounds and restraints of traditional figurative sculpting and its inherent sentimentality by deconstructing this very sense of traditional conformity and conce ntrating on identify ing more with the clay medium. Nonnally this is a battle cry for a new or fresher attempt at primitivism, but I've always associated primitivism with naivete or lack of informed knowing...|$|E
40|$|Major {{constraint}} in soybean {{production on}} Ultisol soil includes: high soil acidity, veryhigh Al and Fe level, low organic matter, nutrient deficiency, low of base saturation and {{cation exchange capacity}} (CEC). This study was aimed at finding an optimal dose and combination of organic manure and soil ameliorants to achieve high yield of soybean in Ultisol soil in Lampung. The experiment was conducted in a greenhouse of the Indonesian Legumes and Tuber Crops Research Institute (ILETRI), Malang, East Java, and on a dry land of Rumbia district, Lampung Tengah, in the 2005 growing season. Four series of experiments were conducted in the greenhouse using four different ameliorants (dolomite, zeolite, limestone, and organic ameliorant Formula 1). The glasshouse trial was arranged in a completely randomized design with two factors and four replications. The first factor consisted of five ameliorant levels, namely 0, 150, 300, 450, and 600 kg/ha. The second factor consisted of four manure levels, namely 0, 500, 100, and 1500 kg/ha. In the field experiment, a randomized complete block design was used with four replications. Two ameliorants, dolomite and zeolite, were used and the treatment combinations {{were the same as}} those in the glasshouse trial. Results indicated that ameliorant zeolite, dolomite, limestone, and Formula 1 increased plant height, seed weight (yield/pot), and yield of soybean in the field. The effective dose of ameliorant application to achieve 2. 0 - 2. 5 t/ha soybean yield was a combination of 500 - 100 kg/ha manure and 150 - 450 kg/ha each one of the ameliorants dolomite, zeolite, lime or Formula 1. An effective way to apply the soil ameliorant was by placing it in the planting hole or by distributing it along the plant rows. The use of ameliorant in the form of <b>organic</b> <b>Formula</b> 1 can be reduced down to 2, 500 kg/ha. The need of ameliorant in the form of natural mineral (dolomite, zeolite, limestone) can be reduced down to 1, 500 kg/ha. Combinations of ameliorant with organic manure showed increase of the effectiveness of the amelioration on Ultisol soil. The optimum combination of soil ameliorant and organic manure was 500 to 1, 000 kg/ha organic manure and 150 to 450 kg/ha ameliorant...|$|E
40|$|The citrus {{industry}} {{is one of}} South Africa's largest agricultural sectors in terms of export earnings with lemon fruits and juice as a trendsetter due to their high grade quality. According to growers, the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa alone produces an excess of about 10 - 14, 000 tons of lemon juice which is presently of no economic value due to the sour taste and “bitterness”. As {{a result of this}} excess and in order {{to make use of the}} polyprotic acids naturally occurring in the lemon juice, four fertilizer nutrient mixtures are formulated, using lemon juice as base. From a conceptual scientific approach, characterization (physico-chemical and functional properties determinations) of Eureka Lemon fruit juices were undertaken, followed by smaller scale batch formulation experiments. On the basis that these lemon juice-based fertilizer mixtures are prepared following standard liquid fertilizer formulation guidelines, a field test was conducted to evaluate their potential effectiveness to influence plant growth. A growth chamber testing on tomato plants revealed high growth response (> 99. 9 % certainty) potential in two of the semi-organic mixtures formulated while the organic mixture showed a relatively good growth rate as compared to the control (pure tap water). According to statistical analysis (ANOVA) comparison, two of the semi-organic mixtures performed considerably better than the two commercial samples evaluated. Potential benefits profoundly associated with these nutrient mixtures as compared to similar liquid fertilizer products on the market is that most nutrients are chelated and dissolved in solution. Also, the mixtures contain all necessary nutrients including plant growth substances required for healthier plant growth. The most important socioeconomic impact is the value addition to the technology chain in the citrus industry. The use of fluid fertilizers in significant quantities is less than twenty years old. Nevertheless, growth has been so rapid that in South Africa demand for mixed liquid fertilizer has greatly increased from 90 000 tons NPK & blended micronutrients in 1955 to more than 600 000 per annum tons today (Report 41 / 2003, Department of Minerals and Energy). The liquid fertilizers market is sparsely specialized with major competitors like Omnia, Kynoch and Foskor supplying more than 50 % of the market demand. Amongst the nutrient mixtures formulated, mixture one is an NPK (1 - 1 - 2) based nutrient mixture containing both secondary nutrients (0. 5 % Mg & 1. 0 % Ca) and seven micronutrients (0. 1 % Fe, 0. 05 % Cu, 0. 05 % Zn, 0. 05 % Mn, 0. 02 % B, 0. 0005 % Mo and 0. 0005 % Co). The composition of this mixture offers the formula a potential to be used as a general purpose (all stages of plant growth) fertilization mixture in view of its balanced composition (containing all essential plant nutrients). Mixture two contains essentially the micronutrients and in higher concentrations (0. 3 % Fe, 0. 3 % Cu, 0. 1 % Zn, 0. 2 % Mn, 0. 02 % B, 0. 0005 % Mo and 0. 0005 % Co) as compared to mixture one except for boron, molybdenum and cobalt. The concentration of the micronutrients contained in this mixture is adequately high which offers a potential for it to be used in supplementing nutrition in plants with critical micronutrient-deficient symptoms. Mixture three is very similar to mixture two (1. 0 % Fe, 0. 05 % Cu, 0. 05 % Zn, 0. 05 Mn, 0. 05 % B, 0. 0005 % Mo and 0. 0005 % Co) except that the concentrations of all seven micronutrients are considerably less than those of contained in mixture two. However, the concentration of iron in this mixture is as high as 1. 0 %. The mixture has a potential to be used in high iron-deficient situations. Mixture four is an <b>organic</b> <b>formula</b> with relatively low nutrient concentrations (NPK- 0. 02 - 0. 02 - 1, 0. 27 % Mg, 0. 02 % Ca, 0. 008 % Fe, 0. 26 % Cu, 0. 012 % Zn, 0. 009 % Mn). Nevertheless, this mixture is appealing for organically grown crops where the use of chemicals is prohibited by standards. These lemon juice-based nutrient mixtures were further characterized and tested for stability and storability over a period of eight weeks. This study revealed no major change in the physical quality (colour, pH and “salt out” effect). The basic formulation methodology is a two-step procedure that involves filtration of the lemon juice to remove membranous materials, mixing at ambient temperature and stabilization of the nutrient mixtures. However, for the organic nutrient formula mix, filtration follows after extraction of nutrients from plant materials using the lemon juice...|$|E
