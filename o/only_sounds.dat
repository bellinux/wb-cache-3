5|$|Three Sounds {{players have}} won league Most Valuable Player (MVP) awards (Steve Balboni, Brian Dayett, and Magglio Ordóñez) and ten have won Pitcher of the Year awards (Bruce Berenyi, Geoff Combe, Andy McGaffigan, Jamie Werly, Stefan Wever, Chris Hammond, Scott Ruffcorn, R.A. Dickey, Johnny Hellweg, and Jimmy Nelson). Four team {{managers}} have won Manager of the Year honors: Stump Merrill, Rick Renick, Frank Kremblas, and Steve Scarsone. Manager Mike Guerrero was {{the recipient of}} Minor League Baseball's Mike Coolbaugh Award in 2013. Ordóñez won the 1997 American Association MVP Award {{as well as the}} league's Rookie of the Year Award, making him the <b>only</b> <b>Sounds</b> player to win two awards in the same season. The only other team personnel to win multiple awards, though in separate seasons, are Renick, who won the league Manager of the Year award in 1993 and 1996, and radio broadcaster Bob Jamison, who was named Broadcaster of the Year in 1980 and 1982. The franchise also won the Larry MacPhail Award for Outstanding Minor League Promotions in 1978, 1980, and 1981.|$|E
25|$|Sound {{designer}} Mark Mangini {{stated that}} he viewed the War Rig as an allegory for Moby-Dick with Immortan Joe {{playing the role of}} Captain Ahab. As such, the mechanical truck sounds were layered with whale calls to provide a more animal-like quality to the truck. When the tank is pierced with harpoons and milk sprays out, the sound of whale blow-holes were used. For the final destruction of the War Rig, the <b>only</b> <b>sounds</b> used were slowed down bear growls to symbolise the death of the truck as a living creature.|$|E

25|$|Braille {{was based}} on a tactile {{military}} code called night writing, developed by Charles Barbier in response to Napoleon's demand for a means for soldiers to communicate silently at night and without a light source. In Barbier's system, sets of 12 embossed dots encoded 36 different sounds. It proved to be too difficult for soldiers to recognize by touch and was rejected by the military. In 1821 Barbier visited the Royal Institute for the Blind in Paris, where he met Louis Braille. Braille identified two major defects of the code: first, by representing <b>only</b> <b>sounds,</b> the code was unable to render the orthography of the words; second, the human finger could not encompass the whole 12-dot symbol without moving, and so could not move rapidly from one symbol to another. Braille's solution was to use 6-dot cells and to assign a specific pattern to each letter of the alphabet.|$|E
25|$|Poe {{writes about}} five periods in media history: {{the age of}} speech, the age of manuscripts, the age of print, the age of {{audiovisual}} media {{and the age of}} the Internet. He provides a detailed analysis of each under eight headings: accessibility, privacy, fidelity, volume, velocity, range, persistence and searchability. Poe writes, for example, that in the 150,000 years during which speech was the only medium or network, its accessibility was high because nearly everyone could speak and listen. Privacy, however, was low in such face-to-face communication and so too was fidelity because speech can convey <b>only</b> <b>sounds,</b> not pictures or other direct sensory information. Volume and range were also low because the unaided human voice can't carry very far or to many people, but velocity was high because speech travels at the speed of sound. Poe notes that speech is not a persistent medium because it fades away instantly, but it is searchable because what is said can remain in people's memories. He draws many conclusions from this analysis including his theory that societies dominated by speech tended to be democratized and egalitarian, but also distrustful of strangers because as a medium, speech is suited to small, tightly knit groups.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} in four days without any overdubbing. All the pieces were improvised, some completely, some to a roughly preconceived idea, and sound as they were played, except for [...] "No Birds", which {{was recorded in}} two parts, and [...] "Not Forgotten", from which two notes were removed. The <b>only</b> <b>sounds</b> not produced 'naturally' by guitar are those of a fuzzbox used on [...] "Out of Their Heads (On Locoweed)", [...] "Heat c/w Moment" [...] and [...] "No Birds", an echo delay used on [...] "No Birds", and ambient noise from Frith's breath and feet on [...] "Heat c/w Moment".|$|E

50|$|The <b>only</b> <b>sound</b> in {{the film}} {{is the voice of}} a narrator and a very {{monotonic}} musical theme.|$|R
60|$|The <b>only</b> <b>sound</b> {{that was}} not stilled at the Cæsar's bidding was--down below--the snarl of the angry panther.|$|R
500|$|The {{majority}} of [...] "Cog" [...] {{takes place in}} complete silence, the <b>only</b> <b>sounds</b> coming from the collisions of the pieces themselves. This is broken with the activation of the CD player from the Accord, which begins playing The Sugarhill Gang's 1979 single [...] "Rapper's Delight". The sequence ends when the button of an electronic key fob is pressed, closing the hatchback of a fully [...] assembled Honda Accord on a carefully balanced trailer. The car rolls off the trailer, and {{stops in front of}} a tonneau cover bearing the [...] "Accord" [...] marque, while narrator Garrison Keillor asks [...] "Isn't it nice when things just work?". The screen fades to white and the piece closes on the Honda logo and the brand's motto, [...] "The Power of Dreams".|$|E
500|$|The Simpsons creator Matt Groening made a minor cameo in the episode, {{though his}} {{appearance}} is {{not mentioned in}} the closing credits. In the episode, a robot examines the health of Maggie's fetus. Maggie's band is present, and one of the band members presses a button on the robot's [...] "face", which is a screen showing its facial expressions, and a soccer game comes on instead. A sports commentator, voiced by Groening, gives a long [...] "goal!" [...] shout that is heard over the game. According to The Simpsons music editor Chris Ledesma, as the episode was being recorded, [...] "there were <b>only</b> <b>sounds</b> of crowd cheering during that shot and Matt said we needed to spice it up somehow." [...] After going through some different ideas, the staff settled on a commentator shouting [...] "goal!". The staff members wanted Groening to provide the voice and he finished the recording in two takes.|$|E
500|$|Heather Phares of AllMusic {{felt that}} the record was [...] "not simply Debut redux", concluding: [...] "The work of a {{constantly}} changing artist, Post proves that as Björk moves toward more ambitious, complex music, she always surpasses herself". Writing for MTV Online, Lou Stathis wrote that, [...] " [...] Björk's wacky, mind-altered perspective that makes Post modern pop music at once both baffling and engaging". He believed that the album was a rewarding experience for both the casual consumer, {{as well as the}} serious listener, also pointing out that, [...] "it not <b>only</b> <b>sounds</b> good while you're listening to it, but it leaves you feeling good when it's over, too". Robert Christgau, reviewing the album for The Village Voice, was less enthusiastic. He {{felt that the}} singer [...] " [...] primeval suspicion of Europeans who presume to [...] "improve" [...] on rock and roll," [...] criticizing her [...] "self-involved vocal devices" [...] and poor grasp of the English language. He gave Post a C+ rating, meaning he considered it [...] "a not disreputable performance, most likely a failed experiment or a pleasant piece of hackwork." [...] MusicHound awarded the album two out of five stars.|$|E

500|$|As {{his horse}} faltered and collapsed, Le Gris was thrown off {{and lost his}} axe. Undaunted, he rose and drew his longsword, turning to meet Carrouges who was already {{advancing}} on him, sword also drawn. Again the combatants traded blows, their weapons the <b>only</b> <b>sounds</b> heard in the silent battleground. Again, Le Gris' superior strength gave him an advantage, pushing Carrouges back before thrusting his blade through his opponent's thigh. As the crowd murmured, Le Gris made a fatal mistake; withdrawing his weapon, he stepped back to watch his wounded enemy and was thus off balance when the desperate Carrouges threw himself forwards, wrestling Le Gris {{to the ground and}} hacking at him with his own longsword. Although Le Gris' plate armour was too thick to allow Carrouges' weapon to penetrate, it was also so heavy that he could not regain his feet with Carrouges on top of him. Stranded on the ground, Le Gris struggled as Carrouges straddled him and used his sword to smash open the lock on Le Gris' faceplate. As the crowd watched in silence, Carrouges shouted in Le Gris' exposed face for him to confess his crime before death or face hell. Le Gris replied so all could hear, [...] "In the name of God, and on the peril and damnation of my soul, I am innocent of the crime". Enraged, Carrouges drew his misericordia and thrust it through Le Gris' throat, killing him instantly.|$|E
2500|$|The {{procession}} {{then went}} on to Brooklyn, where the crowd at Brooklyn City Hall [...] "was the densest ever seen there." [...] There were [...] "thousands on thousands" [...] at City Hall who were so far back that they could not see the funeral procession pass. It was impossible to move on any of the nearby streets. The Times wrote, [...] "Rarely has such an enormous crowd turned out in Brooklyn on any occasion," [...] but that nonetheless, [...] "he slow tolling of the City Hall bell and the regular beating of drums were the <b>only</b> <b>sounds</b> that broke the stillness[...] [...] [...] Anything more impressive [...] [...] [...] could not be imagined." [...] At Court Street, the casket was transferred to a hearse and taken to a private funeral at Fort Hamilton. Commentators disagreed on whether it was the largest funeral in New York history or the largest since the death of Abraham Lincoln. The New York Times reported, [...] "Not even Lincoln had a more glorious death." [...] Even the more conservative New York Sun wrote that [...] "Since the Civil War, few announcements have been more startling than that of the sudden death of Henry George." ...|$|E
60|$|A moment passed. The {{crackling}} of {{the fire}} and the ticking of the clock were the <b>only</b> <b>sounds</b> audible in the room.|$|E

60|$|They {{arrived at}} the old house, and stood, listening, {{in the shadow of}} the doorway. The <b>only</b> <b>sounds</b> were those of distant barking dogs, and of the bugles at the barracks.|$|E
60|$|A torch spluttered {{suddenly}} in its sconce, and the fierce hissing of the fire--like some monster licking its chops over a bloody meal--were the <b>only</b> <b>sounds</b> that disturbed the stillness that ensued.|$|E
60|$|The jungle {{was filled}} with countless birds, of all sorts, sizes, and colors. Some of these sang in a fairly tuneful fashion, but the {{majority}} uttered <b>only</b> <b>sounds</b> which were as painful to the hearing as they were tiresome.|$|E
60|$|For {{a moment}} the <b>only</b> <b>sound</b> {{following}} her words was a gasp from Stewart. Hawe's face became transformed with a hideous amaze and joy.|$|R
60|$|The rapturous {{intake of}} Spike's breath was the <b>only</b> <b>sound</b> {{that broke the}} silence. Through the smoke, his eyes could be seen slowly widening.|$|R

60|$|For {{some time}} the rapid dip of our paddles and {{the rush of}} our canoe through the water were the <b>only</b> <b>sounds</b> that were heard. Then Peterkin spoke again. He could never keep silence for any great length of time.|$|E
60|$|It was a {{stifling}} afternoon. As I trod {{the yellow}} gravel the quivering atmosphere all but blinded me with its reflected glare. The <b>only</b> <b>sounds</b> {{to be heard}} were the clang of a milkman's hand-cart, and the pirouettes of a distant piano.|$|E
60|$|Around {{and around}} the room they circled, the boy always advancing, Paul of Merely always retreating. The din of their clashing swords and the heavy {{breathing}} of the older man were the <b>only</b> <b>sounds,</b> except as they brushed against a bench or a table.|$|E
