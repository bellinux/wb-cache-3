2500|$|On December 19, 2012, Winer co-founded Small Picture, Inc. with Kyle Shank; Small Picture is a {{corporation}} that builds two outlining products, Little <b>Outliner</b> and Fargo. Little <b>Outliner,</b> an entry-level <b>outliner</b> {{designed to teach}} new users about outliners, which launched on March 25, 2013. Fargo, the company's [...] "primary product", launched {{less than a month}} later, on April 17, 2013. Fargo is a free browser-based <b>outliner</b> which syncs with a user's Dropbox account. Small Picture has stated that in future it may offer paid-for services to Fargo users.|$|E
2500|$|ThinkTank, {{which was}} based on VisiText, was {{released}} in 1983 for Apple II and was promoted as an [...] "idea processor." [...] It became the [...] "first popular outline processor, the one that made the term generic." [...] A ThinkTank release for the IBM PC followed in 1984, as well as releases for the Macintosh 128K and 512K. [...] Ready, a RAM resident <b>outliner</b> for the IBM PC released in 1985, was commercially successful but soon succumbed to the competing Sidekick product by Borland. [...] MORE, released for Apple's Macintosh in 1986, combined an <b>outliner</b> and a presentation program. It became [...] "uncontested in the marketplace" [...] and won the MacUser's Editor's Choice Award for [...] "Best Product" [...] in 1986.|$|E
2500|$|With {{products}} and services based on UserLand's Frontier system, Winer became a leader in blogging tools from 1999 onwards, {{as well as a}} [...] "leading evangelist of weblogs." [...] In 2000 Winer developed the Outline Processor Markup Language OPML, an XML format for outlines, which originally served as the native file format for Radio UserLand's <b>outliner</b> application and has since been adopted for other uses, the most common being to exchange lists of web feeds between web feed aggregators. UserLand was the first to add an [...] "enclosure" [...] tag in its RSS, modifying its blog software and its aggregator so that bloggers could easily link to an audio file (see [...] podcasting and history of podcasting).|$|E
30|$|DEA is {{sensitive}} to <b>outliners.</b> Since DEA relies on identifying best practice reference units, it can be sensitive to extreme points, known as <b>outliners,</b> especially data contaminated by measurement error as described by Kuosmanen and Post (1999) and Nam et al. (2008).|$|R

Browser-based <b>outliners</b> run inside a desktop or mobile web browser (smart phone or tablet), and may synchronise the outline's data with a remote server, or store it locally on the user's device.|$|R

50|$|Unlike {{most other}} {{browser-based}} outliners - which often focus on providing a {{minimum viable product}} - The <b>Outliner</b> of Giants has much of the functionality typically associated with a desktop <b>outliner,</b> {{such as the ability}} to use of columns to structure information. However, The <b>Outliner</b> of Giants does not support offline editing, requiring an active internet connection in order to make changes to an outline document.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Outliner</b> of Giants {{was first}} {{released}} in 2009.|$|E
50|$|<b>Outliners</b> {{may be used}} {{in content}} {{creation}} instead of general word processors for capturing, organizing, editing, and displaying knowledge or general textual information. <b>Outliners</b> are ideal for managing lists, organizing facts and ideas, and for writing computer programs. They are also used for goal and task management (including personal information management and project management), and for writing books and movie scripts.|$|R

50|$|A {{software}} program designed for processing outlines is called an <b>outliner.</b>|$|E
50|$|Outlines, {{especially}} those used within an <b>outliner,</b> {{can be used}} for planning, scheduling, and recording.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Outliners.</b> Also called tree-based editors, {{because they}} combine a {{hierarchical}} outline tree with a text editor. Folding (see above) {{can be considered}} a specialized form of outlining.|$|R
5000|$|Folding editors. This {{subclass}} includes so-called [...] "orthodox editors" [...] {{that are}} derivatives of Xedit. Editors that implement folding without programing-specific features are usually called <b>outliners</b> (see below).|$|R
5000|$|OmniOutliner {{does not}} support cloning, a feature of some <b>outliners</b> that allows one topic to appear at more than one place in the outline. The Omni Group may, however, add this feature {{sometime}} in the future.|$|R

50|$|A third {{approach}} to intrinsic outlines is the multi-column <b>outliner.</b> It {{is similar to}} the one-pane <b>outliner</b> in that the text itself is organized into an outline format. However, the text sections do not collapse or expand, and all sections are visible but held in a separate column (one for each level). This approach allows structure and content to be visible at the same time.|$|E
50|$|Extended tree view is {{the central}} {{component}} of <b>outliner</b> applications, where each node consists of editable text.|$|E
30|$|AdaBoost is a fast, {{simple and}} easy to use {{iterative}} algorithm which needs only one parameter to tune, i.e. number of iteration, T. It does not subject to over-fitting and easily identifies <b>outliners</b> which are either misclassified or hard to classify.|$|R
5000|$|Fields/Columns: Items {{can also}} have {{additional}} fields of information. This data can be shown as columns of data in the outline or as fields in the second pane (see 'Layout' below). Some <b>outliners</b> also allow the user to create custom fields and/or filter on fields.|$|R
2500|$|UserLand's {{original}} flagship product, Frontier, was a system-level scripting {{environment for}} the Mac, [...] Winer's pioneering weblog, Scripting News, {{takes its name from}} this early interest. Frontier was an outliner-based scripting language, echoing Winer's longstanding interest in <b>outliners</b> and anticipating code-folding editors of the late 1990s.|$|R
50|$|A one-pane <b>outliner</b> {{is known}} as an {{intrinsic}} <b>outliner</b> because the text itself is organized into an outline format - individual sections (such as paragraphs) of text can be collapsed or expanded, while keeping others in view. Everything is displayed within a single area, hence the term one pane. One of the strengths of one-pane outliners is that, because the text itself is what is structured and because several nodes of text are visible at once, {{it is easy to}} edit across sections. The drawback is that, because the structure is not always visible, there is not as strong an overview of the whole or ability to quickly navigate between sections as with a two-pane <b>outliner.</b> Some word processors, such as Microsoft Word, have an Outline Mode to help with structuring documents.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Outliner</b> of Giants can export outline data as plain text, HTML, {{as well as}} {{directly}} to the Google Docs Word Processor.|$|E
50|$|A one- and two-pane <b>outliner</b> may be {{combined}} as a hybrid. This allows multiple notes' text and graphics to be shown at the same time. The organizational power of outline in hybrid is in the parent outline structure, not in the second pane text, making it a very effective structure for topical organization. One additional advantage of hybrid is that single pane {{can be used as}} single pane <b>outliner</b> with second pane used for notes or reference tracking.|$|E
30|$|To {{reduce the}} {{probability}} of such factors, the sampling process {{in this study was}} carried out over two stages: (1) First, I extracted observations of the Mekong delta from the national scale data and removed observations suspected of being <b>outliners,</b> (2) I randomly selected 1000 observations from each year.|$|R
50|$|An {{important}} subcategory of note-taking tools is <b>outliners</b> (e.g., OmniOutliner), or applications {{specifically designed}} to organize ideas in a hierarchy. These tools typically show a two-pane display with a tree-like navigation widget in the left-pane {{and a list of}} items in the right-pane. Topics and subtopics can be rearranged, and each outline stored in its own file. Modern <b>outliners</b> feature the ability to add graphics and other formatting to an item, and even hyper links to external websites or documents. The once abandoned (but now resurrected) Ecco system {{was among the first to}} allow items to have typed attributes, displayed in columns. This gives the effect of a custom spreadsheet per topic, with the topic's items as rows and the columns as attributes. It allows the user to gracefully introduce structure to their information as it is identified.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Outliner</b> of Giants can import both {{plain text}} and the OPML XML format, which is {{commonly}} used to transfer data between outlining applications.|$|E
50|$|It {{also offers}} {{functionality}} {{similar to that}} of <b>outliner</b> and spatial hypertext/mind mapping tools, in addition to knowledge management, database and agent(persistent search) tools.|$|E
50|$|Outlines {{created through}} The <b>Outliner</b> of Giants can be {{published}} directly online through the service, either as outlines, pages or in a blog format.|$|E
50|$|The Court {{ruled that}} the first four groups of {{features}} are either unprotectable by copyright law as they were ideas or concepts essential to general <b>outliners,</b> or not substantially similar between the two programs. The Court also agreed with the district court that the set of features posing any resemblance to PC-Outline was due to Friend's right to exercise his non-exclusive license to the source code of PC-Outline.|$|R
2500|$|In 1979 Dave Winer {{became an}} {{employee}} of Personal Software, where he worked on his own product idea named VisiText, which was his first attempt to build a commercial product around an [...] "expand and collapse" [...] outline display and which ultimately established <b>outliners</b> as a software product. In 1981 he left the company and founded Living Videotext to develop this still-unfinished product. The company was based in Mountain View, CA, and grew to more than 50 employees.|$|R
50|$|These tools {{also allow}} {{captured}} {{content to be}} edited and annotated and some allow the ability to export to other formats. Other features common to <b>outliners</b> include {{the ability to use}} full text search which aids in quickly locating information and filters enable you to drill down to see only information relevant to a specific query. Captured and kept information also provides an additional backup, in case web pages and sites disappear or are inaccessible later.|$|R
