25|$|Despite {{a number}} of big wins for her {{government}} throughout {{the last half of}} 2013, Dunderdale struggle to regain the ground she had lost in public opinion following that year's budget. In September her government announced a tentative deal had been reached with NAPE, the province's largest public sector union. Earlier in the year Carol Furlong, the president of NAPE, warned that the union had a war chest built up if a strike was necessary. Her government reached agreements with several other unions throughout the remainder of the year. In October she joined officials with Husky Energy to announce that the company would build a new <b>offshore</b> <b>oil</b> <b>platform</b> for the West White Rose Extension in Placentia. Only weeks later her government announced the benefits they had negotiated as part of the Canada's Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement with the European Union, particularly with regards to the fishery. The provincial government agreed to eliminate minimum process requirement for the European Union in exchange for the elimination of high tariffs on seafood. Days later Dunderdale and her ministers were joined with fishing industry officials to announce that as part of the free trade agreement the provincial and federal governments would invest $400 million into the fishery over three years. In December she announced all financing for the Muskrat Falls was in place, with the province borrowing $5-billion, with a 40-year term at 3.8 percent interest.|$|E

"Vienen" [...] {{was shot}} in three locations: a studio in Los Angeles, a closed down CENCO oil {{refinery}} in Santa Fe Springs, and an <b>offshore</b> <b>oil</b> <b>platform</b> in the Pacific Ocean {{off the coast of}} Santa Barbara. During the show's previous seasons, location manager Ilt Jones had been required to scout for locations after scripts were submitted. Starting with the eighth season, however, he was allowed to go on several [...] "scouting roadshow" [...] in order to find new and interesting locations that could be written into scripts. Jones, who discovered the oil platform and the refinery during his first scouting trip, later said the oil platform was [...] "his favorite example" [...] of places he was able to find. Because the platform and refinery were scouted in advance, Jones was given six weeks to prepare the shoota [...] "far cry" [...] from the usual two. This added time also saved the series a considerable amount of money. Filming on the oil platform occurred between sunrise and sunset in one day. The film crew used Steadicams for filming on the oil platform because the decks were slick with oil and, according to Hardy, the cameras [...] "sort of fit and blend in quite well" [...] on the platform.|$|E

2500|$|A {{series of}} legal and {{legislative}} actions, however, delayed actual oil platform construction and drilling until the mid-1960s, as the Federal and State governments fought for ownership of submerged lands. [...] Congress passed the Submerged Lands Act in 1953, which granted to the states all lands within [...] of shore, known as the tidelands. [...] After two more years of wrangling with state legislature, Santa Barbara arrived at a compromise with the oil companies, creating a no-drilling zone in the Channel [...] long and [...] wide adjacent {{to the city of}} Santa Barbara. [...] However, several major oil fields were found within state waters on either side of this zone, and the State granted leases in these fields beginning in 1957. [...] Development of these resources commenced, with the first <b>offshore</b> <b>oil</b> <b>platform</b> – Hazel – being built in 1957. [...] Platform Hilda, adjacent to Hazel, was erected in 1960. [...] Both platforms tapped into the Summerland Offshore Oil Field, and were easily visible from Santa Barbara on a clear day. [...] Platform Holly, in the offshore portion of the Ellwood Oil Field about [...] west of Santa Barbara, was emplaced in 1965.|$|E

A GBS intended for use as an <b>offshore</b> <b>oil</b> <b>platform</b> is constructed of steel reinforced concrete, often with tanks or cells which can be used to control the buoyancy of the finished GBS.
