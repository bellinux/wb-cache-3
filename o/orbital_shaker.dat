This medium is often supplemented with glucose and will often contain additional molecules designed to facilitate optimal culture growth. Pre-cultures may then be grown in shake flasks. These are simply plugged Erlenmeyer flasks which are left on an <b>orbital</b> <b>shaker</b> machine, which revolves {{at very high}} RPM. This process aerates the culture, which is necessary for optimal growth. Once the pre-cultures are ready, the plasmids needed by specific experiments are added to each culture separately, and then each culture is transferred to a bio-reactor. Bio-reactors are systems which allow cultures to grow in a controlled environment. This leaves the introduced plasmids as the only independent variable. The required temperature, pH, metabolite concentrations, and various other environmental factors can be maintained by the bio-reactor ensuring identical growth conditions for each culture.|$|E

These studies require comprehensive resolution of WSS, however the fluid dynamics inside orbiting culture dishes {{has not yet been}} well described since the flow is complex and difficult to quantify analytically. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of flow in an orbiting dish has been developed that yields detailed spatial and temporal resolution of WSS. The model was initially validated against primitive single point laser Doppler velocimetry data from the literature. A more comprehensive validation of the model was then performed here using both Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and a limited analytical solution that neglects wall effects. Average computational normalized velocity magnitudes varied by an average of just 0. 3 % from experimental PIV and from the analytical solution by 2. 4 %. WSS contours also compared very well qualitatively. Turbulence intensities were generated from PIV {{for a wide range of}} Reynolds numbers, Froude numbers, Stokes numbers, and Slope Ratios in order to determine transition to turbulent flow.

40|$|<b>Orbital</b> <b>shakers</b> are {{commonly}} used in the cell culture industry due to their ease of use, but the fluid dynamics of this system have not been extensively modeled as the system is difficult to quantify analytically. It is desirable to understand how cultured cells respond to fluid forces {{as the result of}} motion of a dish on an orbiting platform under varying flow conditions. Wall shear stresses {{are commonly}} accepted as the primary influence affecting characteristics of anchored cells subjected to fluid flow. Cells become aligned and elongated with the direction of flow when shear stresses are experienced. In this work, FLUENT, a commercial CFD package is utilized to model fluid behavior in these dishes. To simplify computational effort, the investigation is reduced {{to the study of the}} following three dimensionless parameters: the Stokes Number, the Froude Number, and the Slope Ratio. It is desirable to identify how the fluid behaves at low and high values for each of these parameters and where the transition from low to high occurs for each of these values. The study yielded the following findings. The Stokes Transition occurs at a Stokes Number of 4. 1 ± 0. 1 for a Froude Number of 1. 0 and a Slope Ratio of 1. 0 and results in a localized increase in the slope of maximum WSS vs. Stokes Number.

40|$|Effects of hemodynamic {{forces on}} {{cellular}} response are well studied. Wall shear stress is regularly accepted {{as the primary}} hemodynamic force affecting cellular response. Hemodynamic forces studies utilize Petri dishes on <b>orbital</b> <b>shakers</b> to grow cells for the experiments since this is an easily scalable system. However, characterizing the hemodynamics is difficult since the oscillatory swirling motion creates multidirectional and variable magnitude shear throughout the dish. Thus, a novel geometry dish that could create uniaxial shear with less variation in magnitude would be advantageous for studying shear stress effects on cellular response. The purpose of this thesis was to explore the ability for creating narrow shear ranges in terms of magnitude and direction, and to determine DOSI in novel geometry dishes. The new geometries consist of a narrow channel flat bottom dish and a narrow channel banked bottom dish. The study used computational fluid dynamics (Fluent) to simulate the fluid motion in the dishes. The study concluded with successfully identifying conditions surrounding regions of low variation of magnitude and direction of shear and DOSI patterns. For the NCF dish the least variation in shear magnitude, between radial locations, occurs at 60 RPM. In terms of the DOSI values, the NCF dish had increasingly higher DOSI values, meaning more uniaxial favored (tangential) flow {{across the surface of}} the dish as speed increased. The lowest variation occurred at 180 RPM. For the NCB dish the least variation in shear magnitude, between radial locations, occurred at 90 RPM. The NCB dish’s narrow range of shear stress is hypothesized to be the result of a more parallel fluid surface relative to the bottom surface of the dish. The NCB dish had DOSI values close to 1. 0, meaning more uniaxial favored (tangential) flow, at the 80 % and 90 % radial locations for speeds between 120 and 180 rpm...|$|R

The permeability · area product (PA) for each of the low molecular weight solutes increased about fourfold with rapid shaking while the PA of protein increased by only about 50 %. It seems likely that shaking increased PA primarily via reduction of the thickness of stagnant peritoneal fluid layers, although increases in surface area or changes in tissue permeability cannot be excluded with certainty.

Many of the functional requirements depend on the fluid flow field within the CSC (e. g., feeding and gas management). A design goal of the CCU is to match, within experimental limits, all environmental conditions, other than the effects of gravity on the cells, whether the hardware is in microgravity (micro g), normal Earth gravity, or up to 2 g on the ISS centrifuge.

The second step is to ensure that the design of the CCU allows the fluid flow conditions found in 1 g to be replicated from microgravity up to 2 g. The techniques that are being used to take these steps include flow visualization, particle image velocimetry (PIV), and computational fluid dynamics (CFD).

VadlaniIn our study, five {{different}} bioenergy crops: wheat straw (Triticum aestivum), forage sorghum stover (sorghum bicolor), switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), miscanthus (Miscanthus giganteus) and sweet sorghum baggase (Sorghum bicolor) were evaluated for bio-ethanol production at 20 % (w/v) initial substrate concentration under separate hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF) process. The substrates were ground {{to pass through}} 600 µm mesh size and treated with 2 % (w/v) NaOH at 121 oC for 30 minutes. The washed and neutralized pretreated residues were subjected to saccharification using cellulase and β-glucosidase enzymes (ratio 1 : 1. 25) at concentrations of 25 filter paper unit (fpu) /g and 31. 25 fpu/g, respectively, in pH 5. 0 citrate buffer in an <b>orbital</b> incubator <b>shaker</b> at 150 rpm for 72 h. The hydrolysate obtained was centrifuged and supernatant was collected for fermentation. Fermentation was performed in shake flasks using Saccharomyces cerevisiae at 10 % (w/v) inoculum concentration at 100 rpm for 24 h. Alkali treatment was effective in delignification of all the biomass feedstocks. The highest percent removal on raw biomass basis was attained for sorghum stover BMR-DP (81. 3 %, w/w) followed by miscanthus (79. 9 %, w/w), sorghum stover BMR-RL (69. 2 %, w/w), wheat straw (68. 0 %, w/w), switchgrass (66. 0 %, w/w), and sorghum baggase (65. 4 %, w/w). Glucan saccharification varied from 56. 4 - 72. 6 % (w/w) corresponding to a glucose levels of 0. 45 - 0. 34 g/g of dry substrate. Highest saccharification was observed for wheat straw while lowest was observed for miscanthus after 48 hours of hydrolysis. A maximum final ethanol concentration of 4. 3 % (w/v) was observed for wheat straw followed by sorghum baggase (4. 2 %), sorghum RL-BMR (3. 6 %), miscanthus (3. 4 %), sorghum DP-BMR (3. 4 %), and switchgrass (3. 2 %). From our studies, {{it is evident that}} high substrate concentration used for enzymatic hydrolysis was able to provide high final ethanol concentration. The lignin content and its arrangement in different biomass feedstocks may have affected saccharification and subsequent ethanol production. Bulk density and flowability are the two major key parameters that should be addressed to reduce processing cost of biomass for bioethanol production. Pelleting of biomass can increase the bulk density, thereby reducing the handling and transportation costs. In addition to above study, I analyzed the changes in chemical composition due to pelletization and pretreatment, and its effect on ethanol production by comparing unpelleted and pelleted biomass ethanol production efficiency. Wheat straw and big bluestem pelleted and unpelleted biomass were compared for their ethanol production efficiency. Pelleted and unpelleted wheat straw (Triticum aestivum) and bigblue stem (Andropogon gerardii Vitman) at a substrate concentration of 10 % (w/v) were subjected to 2 % NaOH treatment at 1210 C for 30 min and the resulting residues were analyzed for changes in chemical composition. Saccharification of residue was done at substrate concentration of 12 % (w/v) for 48 h. The sugars obtained were fermented to ethanol using Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Pelletization did not significantly affect the chemical composition of biomass in terms of glucan, xylan and lignin content. Delignification of pelleted biomass was greater than unpelleted biomass. Pelletization did not influence final ethanol production for both substrates...|$|R

Combined with their bacterial symbionts, these biocontrol agents have proven to be very effective against numerous pests. The nematodes belong to the families Steinernematidae and Heterorhabditidae, and are ideal to be used in, and integrated with, pest management systems. There is a dire need for new and innovative methods to control agricultural pests, as numerous pest insects have developed resistance against broad-spectrum insecticides. Together with the environmental impact of these insecticides and the safety aspect regarding humans and animals, the need to develop new technologies, including entomopathogenic nematodes for pest management, is high. In this study, the associated symbiotic bacteria of three entomopathogenic nematodes species were isolated, and the potential of two nematode species to be successfully mass cultured in liquid medium was evaluated. Regarding the symbiotic bacteria, results from the study showed that bacteria species from all three nematode species, Heterorhabditis noenieputensis, Steinernema khoisanae and Heterorhabditis zealandica, were novel. Heterorhabditis noenieputensis was isolated in the Mpumalanga province during a previous survey conducted in citrus orchards. The bacterium isolated from this nematode belongs to the genus Photorhabdus, and bear closest similarity (98. 6 %) to the type strain of P. luminescens subsp laumondii (TT 01 T). Photorhabdus luminescens subsp. noenieputensis subsp. nov., derives its name from the area where the nematode was sourced, namely the farm Springbokvlei, near the settlement Noenieput close to the Namibian border. Thus far, 85 Steinernema spp. have been described worldwide, including S. khoisanae which was isolated in the Western Cape province of South Africa. Four S. khoisanae strains, namely SF 87, SF 80, SF 362 and 106 -C, were used for characterisating the new bacteria from different localities in South Africa. Using the neighbor-joining method, all the strains were aligned with 97 % homology to the 16 S rRNA sequences of several Xenorhabdus- type strains, indicating that they belonged to the same genus. The multigene approach was used to distinguish between the Xenorhabdus spp. and partial recA, dnaN, gltX, gyrB and infB gene sequences of the various strains were analysed. The bacterium species was named Xenorhabdus khoisanae sp. nov. after the nematode from which it was isolated. The results showed that the third bacterium species, which was isolated from H. zealandica, was new. The sequence of the bacteria strain clustered with the type strains of P. temperata and P. asymbiotica, indicate that it belonged to the genus Photorhabdus. This is the first study to show that H. zealandica associates with a luminescent Photorhabdus species, rather than with the known non-luminescent P. temperata. The potential of H. zealandica and Steinernema yirgalemense mass culture in liquid was investigated. Results illustrated that H. zealandica and its P. luminescens symbiont can be successfully cultured in liquid. However, two generations occurred during the process time, instead of the desirable one-generation. The growth curve of the symbiotic bacteria during the process time was measured, in order to determine when the stationary phase was reached, with the results showing this to occur after 36 h. Therefore, the optimum amount of time required for inoculating the IJs and for aiding in maximum infective juvenile (IJ) recovery is 36 h for adding the nematodes post pre-culturing of the bacteria. Future research goals should be to increase the percentage recovery in liquid culture, which would increase the number of nematodes produced per ml, which would, therefore, reduce the processing time significantly. The results from mass culturing the second nematode species, S. yirgalemense, indicated an asynchronous nematode development in the first generation. Growth curves were performed with the symbiotic bacteria that showed the exponential phase of Xenorhabdus started after 15 h, and that, after 42 h, the stationary phase was reached, with an average of 51 × 107 cfu·ml- 1. Bioassays were performed to compare the virulence between in vitro- and in vivo-produced nematodes, with the results showing that the in vitro-produced nematodes were significantly less virulent than were the nematodes produced in vivo. The success obtained with the production of S. yirgalemense in liquid culture can serve as {{the first step in the}} optimising and upscaling of the commercial production of nematodes in industrial fermenters. The last aim of the current study was to determine when Xenorhabdus reached the stationary phase, when it is grown in a 20 -L fermenter, as this would be the optimum time at which to add the IJs of S. yirgalemense. Such characteristics as the effect of stationary phase conditions on the bacterial cell density and on the DO 2 rate in the fermenter were investigated. The results showed that the stationary phase of Xenorhabdus was reached after 36 h at 30 ˚C, which took 6 h less than did the same procedures followed with the Xenorhabdus sp. cultured in Erlenmeyer flasks on <b>orbital</b> <b>shakers.</b> This is the first step toward the liquid mass culturing of S. yirgalemense in industrial-size fermenters. Data from this study indicated the optimum amount of time that is required for adding nematodes to the bacterial culture in the fermenter, and for ensuring the optimum recovery of IJs, as well as a subsequent high yield of nematodes within a minimum processing time. This is the first report of its kind to investigate comprehensively the successful liquid culture of two South African entomopathogenic nematode species for the sole purpose of evaluating potential commercialisation. Results emanating from this study could be used as groundwork in future, in combination with similar research such as culturing nematodes intensively in large fermenters. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Entomopatogeniese nematodes het die potensiaal om as doeltreffende biologiese beheeragente teen sleutelplaaginsekte gebruik te word. Elke nematood werk interaktief met ‘n spesifieke bakterium. Entomopatogeniese nematodes, behorende tot die families Steinernematidae en Heterorhabditidae, is ideale kandidate vir gebruik in ‘n geïntegreerde plaagbestuurprogram. Tans is daar ŉ behoefte vir nuwe metodes vir die beheer van plaaginsekte, omdat meeste insekte reeds weerstand opgebou het teen bestaande plaagdoders. As gevolg van die negatiewe impak van plaagdoders op die omgewing, asook kommer oor veiligheid vir die mens en diere, is die ontwikkeling en gebruik van alternatiewe plaagbeheermiddels noodsaaklik. In die eerste deel van die studie word drie nuwe bakterie spesies geïsoleer en beskryf. Resultate van hierdie studie het aangetoon dat die bakterië spesies vanuit die nematode spesies, Heterorhabditis noenieputensis, Steinernema khoisanae, en Heterorhabditis zealandica, tot dusver onbeskryf was. Eersgenoemde, H. noenieputensis, is afkomstig van ŉ sitrusboord in die Mpumalanga Provinsie. Die bakterie hieruit geïsoleer behoort tot die genus Photorhabdus en is biologies verwant (98. 6 %) aan P. luminescens subsp laumondii (TT 01 T). Die bakterie is benaam as Photorhabdus luminescens subsp. noenieputensis nov. en is na die nematood waaruit dit geïsoleer is vernoem. Tot dusver is wêreldwyd 82 spesies van Steinernema spp. beskryf, insluitende S. khoisanae van die Weskaap provinsie. Vier bakterie isolate is van S. khoisanae, SF 87, SF 80, SF 362 en 106 -C geïsoleer. Die buur-koppeling metode was gebruik om te bepaal dat hierdie bakterie isolate tot 97 % ooreenstem met verskeie isolate van Xenorhabdus se 16 S rRNA DNS volgordebepalings. Om tussen Xenorhabdus spp. te onderskei is ŉ multi-geen benadering gebruik deur gedeeltelike recA, dnaN, gltX, gyrB en infB DNS basispaar volgordebepalings van die verskeie isolate te bepaal. Hierdie bakterie isolaat is soortgelyk ook vernoem as, Xenorhabdus khoisanae sp. nov., na die nematood waaruit dit geïsoleer is. Die derde onbekende bakteriële spesie is uit H. zealandica geïsoleer. Die DNS basispaar volgordebepaling van die 16 S geen van SF 41 toon aan dat dit in dieselfde groep as P. temperata en P. asymbiotica val en sodoende aan die genus Photorhabdus behoort. Hierdie is die eerste studie met die bevinding dat H. zealandica ook met ŉ ander bakterie spesie geassosieer kan word buiten die normale P. temperata spesie. Die tweede deel van die studie gaan oor die teling van twee nematood spesies, H. zealandica en Steinernema yirgalemense, en hulle is geëvalueer vir hulle potensiaal om geteel te word in ŉ vloeibare medium. Die resultate het gewys dat H. zealandica met sy P. luminescens simbiont suksesvol in vloeistof aangeteel kan word, ten spyte van die feit dat daar twee generasies ontwikkel het, in plaas van die meer ideale enkel generasie. Die groeikurwe van die simbiotiese bakterie was gemonitor om te bepaal wanneer die stasionêre fase bereik word. Die resultate toon dat hierdie fase na 36 uur bereik was. Dus was die infektiewe nematode larwes eers na 36 uur tot die vloeibare medium waarin die bakterie geteel was bygevoeg. Navorsing in die toekoms moet dus gefokus wees om die persentasie herwinning van die infektiewe larwes te verhoog. Dit sal daartoe lei dat meer nematodes per ml geproduseer kan word en ook die prosesseringstyd van die nematodes verminder. ŉ Tweede nematode spesie, S. yirgalemense, was ook in vloeistof geteel. Hier het ŉ asinkroniese ontwikkeling in die eerste generasie plaasgevind wat problematies is. Groeikurwes is bepaal van die bakteriële simbiont en die resultate het gewys dat die groeifase van Xenorhabdus na 15 uur in aanvang geneem het en dat die stasionêre fase bereik was na 42 uur met ŉ gemiddelde van 51 × 107 selle·ml- 1. Die virulensie van nematodes wat in vitro geteel is, is vergelyk met die virulensie van nematodes wat in vivo geteel is en die resultate het getoon dat die in vitro geteelde nematodes minder virulent was. Die teling van S. yirgalemense in vloeistof was oor die algemeen meer suksesvol as die teling van H. zealandica in dieselfde medium. Die doelwit van die laaste gedeelte van hierdie studie was om te bepaal wanneer Xenorhabdus die stasionêre fase bereik wanneer dit in ŉ 20 -L fermenter gekweek word. Dit bepaal sodoende die optimale tyd wanneer die infektiewe larwes van S. yirgalemense bygevoeg behoort te word. Die uitwerking van die stasionêre fase op die bakteriële selle, asook die DO 2 -konsentrasie in die fermenter, was geëvalueer. Resultate het gewys dat die stasionêre fase van Xenorhabdus na 36 uur bereik was, wat 6 uur korter is as toe dit gekweek is in Erlenmeyer flesse. Hierdie studie is die eerste stap om die massa teling van S. yirgalemense in industriële fermenters suksesvol te bemeester. Die data wat verkry was, het aangedui wat die ideale tydsduur sal wees om die bakteriegetalle te vermeerder voordat die nematode bygevoeg word. Hierdie is die eerste studie wat die teling van twee Suid-Afrikaanse nematode spesies omvattend in vloeistof evalueer het. Die hoof doelwit is om die potensiaal van hierdie nematode spesies, met die oog op kommersiële gebruik, te meet. Die resultate van hierdie studie kan gekombineer word met toekomstige studies in hierdie spesifieke navorsingsveld...|$|R
