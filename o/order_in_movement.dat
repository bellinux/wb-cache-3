40|$|Many populations exhibit {{collective}} behavior, where {{interactions among}} nearby individuals scale up to cause emergent {{patterns in the}} behavior of groups, as in the coordinated movement of a flock of birds or a school of fish. Populations influenced by collective behavior violate the assumption of mass action that underlies most ecological models, in which individuals are viewed as statistically independent. However, the ecological significance of collective behavior is not well understood, because studies have been limited to populations where high throughput ethological data is available, such as in the laboratory or in computer simulations. This dissertation tests for the signal of collective behavior in ecological data-data on the distribution patterns of organisms collected on a coarser spatial and temporal scale than the underlying processes-and examines the influence of collective behavior on population dynamics. Data on the locations of migratory caribou (collected every five days by satellite tracking collars) are shown to be generated by two distinct processes. The first process creates broad-scale spatiotemporal <b>order</b> <b>in</b> <b>movement</b> patterns, and is likely driven by seasonally and spatially fluctuating environmental and physiological cues. The second process creates finer-scale order that is likely due to behavioral interactions among nearby individuals. The strength of alignment in the velocities of nearby individuals varies systematically with time of year, suggesting that collective behavior can be a dynamic property of migratory populations. The dissertation then considers collective mobility patterns in humans, analyzing census data on the commuting patterns of workers in Canadian cities. The level of order in commuting patterns varies systematically among cities. In particular, in some cities a disproportionate number of workers travel to work in a few focal locations. Simulations of the spread of a respiratory infection in each city predict differences among cities in the risk of an epidemic, due to systematic variation in the level of order in the commuting patterns of workers. In particular, larger cities tend to be more highly organized and, as a result, have a disproportionately higher probability of sparking an epidemic. The dissertation then explores the role of large cities in supporting {{the emergence of a new}} strain of influenza in dogs. The analysis combines demographic data on animal shelters in the United States, molecular data from the pathogen and seroprevalence estimates from the literature to show that large animal shelters in major metropolitan areas function as endemic reservoirs for the virus, facilitating sporadic outbreaks in the wider population. In sum the dissertation research shows that collective behavior can sometimes be detected and characterized in ecological data without recourse to fine-scale behavioral observations, and that collective behavior can significantly alter population dynamics at broad spatial and temporal scales. 2019 - 05 - 2...|$|E
40|$|Two {{experiments}} were undertaken. The objective of Experiment One {{was to identify}} the lower limb muscles that were most frequently active during the early period of a step turning task for further testing in Experiment Two. In Experiment Two participants undertook multiple trials of a step-turning task, 30 and 60 ° {{to the left and}} right of midline, at a self-selected pace in response to a visual cue. There were five objectives to Experiment Two. Firstly, to identify the predominant order in the onset of foot movement so that anticipatory muscle activity could be defined for this task. Secondly, to identify whether there is a consistent temporal <b>order</b> <b>in</b> <b>movement</b> onset between the head and the feet. Thirdly, to identify whether and how consistently anticipatory lower limb muscle activity is present bilaterally. Fourthly, to assess whether there is a consistent sequence in the onset of anticipatory muscle activity among muscles active in at least 80 % of trials. The final objective was to identity whether there was a consistent temporal relationship in the onset of the anticipatory muscle activity present in at least 80 % of trials, with the onset of head and foot movement. Study Design: A repeated measures design was used. Background: Anticipatory lower limb muscle activity in gait initiation and forward stepping studies has been reported to be consistently present, and associated with initial and important balance responses. Falls during turning are associated with a high incidence of hip fractures in the elderly population. The presence of anticipatory lower limb muscle activity turning has not been previously reported. Participants: There were five participants in Experiment One, and ten in Experiment Two. All were between 18 and 40 years of age and did not have neurological or musculoskeletal disorders, or severe visual loss. Results: In Experiment One, four muscles were consistently active bilaterally, during the early period of step-turning and were: tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius, biceps femoris and gluteus medius. In Experiment Two the ipsilateral foot moved before the contralateral foot in 68 % of trials towards the left, and 79 % of trials towards the right. The onset of head movement consistently occurred before the onset of foot movement during turns towards both directions. The percentage of trials in which the four muscles were active in an anticipatory manner was low bilaterally, ranging from 12 to 38 % of trials. Objectives that involved the further analysis of muscles active in at least 80 % of trials were unable to be completed. Conclusions: During a step-turning task young healthy adults predominantly move their ipsilateral foot before their contralateral foot. The consistent onset of head movement prior to that of the feet, indirectly suggests that the visual system might influence the temporal onset of the feet. The low levels of anticipatory muscle activity during step-turning suggest that the lower limbs are not involved with the initial balance responses for this task thus making it inherently different to gait initiation and forward stepping...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityIn choral {{singing the}} {{rehearsal}} {{is the life}} blood of the choir. A successful rehearsal depends upon through planning by the director. Music to be rehearsed have enough variety to make the rehearsal interesting. An appointed committee makes the rehearsal room ready by having chairs, lights, anthems, hymnals, ets. in readiness when the choir members and director arrive. A piano is always used for rehearsing choirs. The organ is used for rehearsing as the final procedure of the rehearsal. 	To gain the best material possible from the available talen, the director must put an audition into practice. The applicant is given a simple vocal test to determine his ability to sing on pitch, descriminate between intervals, reproduce given tones, exercises to determine his best notes within his range, voice quality, ensemble capability and genuine interest in singing. 	Correct breathing consists of three primary functions: the inspiration, or taking air into the lungs; the retention, or holding of {{the air in the}} lungs; and the expiration, or releasing the breath from the lungs. The breath must be controlled. It is controlled breath and not the amount of breath that determines the strength of the tone. Breathing should be done phrase-wise and not note-wise. The catch-breath is used to sustain long passages, with choral members staggering their breathing, giving the overall effect that the group is not breathing on long passages. Choral members should keep good posture to maintain proper breathing. 	Since rehearsals do not allow time for sufficient drilling in reading the director should offer practical suggestions and encourage outside practicing. Public school music programs are important in teaching the children to read music. Private music teachers should offer the students music theory as well as techniques. 	Rhythm and tempo are important to the music in order for it to be played or sung correctly. Rhythm is <b>order</b> <b>in</b> <b>movement</b> or {{the way in which the}} notes are grouped with respect to accentuation. Tempo refers to the speed t which the beats are taken. Tempo is determined by given metronome markings, Italian words, or words in the native language of the composer, sentiment of text, melodic character of the music, harmonic structure of the music, and metrical and rhythmical character of the music. The more crowded a composition is with details in interpretation the slower it should be executed. 	Varying the power of tone on a note or group of notes is called shading. The ear demands variety in music so the technique of dynamics is used to provide variety. The swell is the basis of most dynamic and emotional aspects of tonal coloring. Under the swell comes crescendo and decrescendo, which are used for single notes or long phrases. Crescendos express rising sentiment which is regarded as the first part of the swell. The decrescendo or diminuendo expresses a lowering of spirit which is the last part of the swell. 	Hazards to watch for in the unsteady pressure of dynamic levels are: irregular breath to vocal cords; mental attitude (uncertainty of notes, intervals); emotional reaction of singer (excitement, pressure); melodic line (skipping intervals, long phrases); distractions (audience, orchestra, daydreaming) / Mental alertness and strict attention to the director will help to overcome these common faults. 	Dynamic changes are usually called for on repeated notes or long notes, two notes to syllable, ascending in polyphonic music. 	The position of a voice in a chord and its relation to that chord determines how well that voice will be heard. Balance is often jeopardized by too much treble. Higher vibrations in the treble voice makes it easier to hear. Treble voices should soften to balance with the male voices. Support may be added to tenor voices by adding alto voices to vital passages. 	Intonation is the manner in which tones are produced in relation to their key. When a voice varies from the proper key relation it is said to be flat or sharp. Extreme heat will effect intonation. Absorption of tones by drapes, curtains, etc., will deaden the sound so that the overtones are not heard. Mental fatigue and physical fatigue cause poor intonation. Small rooms or large rooms with low ceilings cause flatting. Places to watch for flatting are high notes at the top of ascending melodies, intervals from low to high part of voice, recurring intervals, descending melodies that turn up for resolution, and sustained tones where the breath is not properly supported. Causes for sharping are over anxiety, excessive effort, over sining, and tension both mental and physical. 	The support of the congregational singing is the organist's most important function in the worship service. The organist should have training in organ, voice, church music, and general all-round musical knowledge. The organist should be able to play any hymn in any hymnal expertly for the choir and congregational singing. He should know the familiar anthems' voice parts as well as accompaniment part. He should be a ready reader for any musical emergency. He should know the familiar vocal solos, cantatas, and oratorios. Above all he should remember he is not in a concert hall but it participant in Divine Worship. The three important functions of the organist are: leader of congregational singing; accompanist for choir; and soloist during preludes and postludes. 	Every group which endeavors to perform in public needs a sole authority which takes the responsibility of organizing, training, and rehearsing the group into a single unit to render music to the best of its ability. This is the purpose of the conductor. The conductor must give unity to groups of singers in rhythm, tempo, phrasing, breathing, unity in quality of contract, balance of tone, melodic prominence to homophonic music, expression, thought, emotion, and imagination. The conductor should have a thorough background in the fundamentals of music. He should have a keen ear and the ability to read scores. The mechanical movements in conducting should become second nature to the conductor so that his full attention may be directed to the musical interpretation. The conductor should have a personality that will reveal his qualities and enable him to make spontaneous contact with his group. 	The church choir director actually serves as an assistant minister, for his duties carry him to the congregation and the entire church membership. He should, therefore, work in harmony with the minister. 	For educational purposes one choir is not sufficient to meet the various age groups within the church. It is necessary, therefore, to organize and foster choirs which will give musical opportunity to all persons within the church. 	The Junior Choir's primary purpose is education not performance. They should sing in the worship service occasionally since it gives them a definite goal for which to strive. Their chief performance as a choral unit should be in learning new hymns and presenting them to the Sunday School. 	The Intermediate Choir, or Young People's Choir, is for the high school age. They are too old for the Juniors and too young for the Adult Choir. They are given the opportunity to sing at regular intervals in the worship service. This affords experience and training necessary for entrance into the Adult Choir upon graduation from high school. 	Obviously, the Adult Choir is the most important choral organization within the church due to its function in the worship service and its choral achievement. Its function is to support and foster congregation through their music which is offered on behalf of the congregation and is not addressed to them. 	Advantages for having an organized choir are several. The choir should have officers who can assume the responsibility for tasks that are necessary for the well-being of the choir. An organized choir gives the members a sense of unity and an official channel through which they may voice their problems. As elected officers they can comprise a committee which can work with the director on vital matters. Organization stabilizes the choir so that it is self-functioning, making it less dependent on the director as an administrator. Care should be taken not to over organize the choir and each officer must shoulder his or her responsibility if a healthy, efficient organization is to be maintained. 	The music committee should range from five to nine members and should be responsible for promoting the music program of the church. The members should be selected for their ability to administer rather than actual musical knowledge. A choir member should be represented on the music committee to serve as a liaison between choir and committee. A representative from the official board, preferably the chairman from the finance committee. The music committee aids the choir in obtaining new members, ding publicity for special programs, raising money for various needs of the choir, and giving the choir recognition by means of banquets and special services. The music committee should be responsible for the hiring of music leaders for the church and utilizing the entire musical resource of the church...|$|E

Growing evidence suggests that these procedural skills are consolidated during sleep, however investigation of such learning has focused upon the <b>order</b> <b>in</b> which <b>movements</b> are made rather than their temporal dynamics. Here, we use psychophysics and neuroimaging to explore the possibility that temporal aspects of such skills are also enhanced over a period of sleep. Behaviourally, our examinations of motor (tapping a finger in time with a temporal rhythm) and perceptual (monitoring a temporal rhythm for deviants) tasks reveal post-sleep improvements in both domains. Functionally, we show that brain-state during retention (sleep or wake) modulates subsequent responses in the striatum, supplementary motor area, and lateral cerebellum during motor timing, and in the posterior hippocampus during perceptual timing. Our data support the proposal that these two forms of timing draw on different brain mechanisms, with motor timing using a more automatic system while perceptual timing of the same rhythm is more closely associated with cognitive processing...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{concepts}} of pattern dynamics and their adaptation through behavioral information, {{developed in the}} context of rhythmic movement coordination, are generalized to describe discrete movements of single components and the coordination of multiple compo-nents <b>in</b> discrete <b>movement.</b> <b>In</b> a first step we consider only one spatial component and study the temporal <b>order</b> inherent <b>in</b> discrete <b>movement</b> <b>in</b> terms of stable, reproducible space-time relationships. The coordination of discrete <b>movement</b> is captured <b>in</b> terms of relative timing. Using an exactly solvable nonlinear oscillator as a mathematical model, we show how the timing proper-ties of discrete movement can be described by these pattern dynamics and discuss the relation of the pattern variables to observable end-effector movement. By cou-pling several such component dynamics in a fashion analogous to models of rhythmic movement coordina-tion we capture the coordination of discrete movements of two components. We find the tendency to synchro-nize the component movements as the discrete analo-gon of in,phase locking and study its breakdown when the components become too different in their dynamic properties. The concept of temporal stability leads to the prediction that remote compensatory esponses oc-cur such as the restore synchronization when one com-ponent is perturbed. This prediction can be used to test the theory. We find that the discrete analogon to anti-phase locking <b>in</b> rhythmic <b>movement</b> is a tendency to move sequentially, a finding that can also be subjected to empirical test. ...|$|R
