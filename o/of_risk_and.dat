5|$|Initially {{there was}} no system in place to allow prisoners to send letters; {{censorship}} arrangements were made through the Dominion Police in Ottawa, and the American Consul was designated a representative for prisoner welfare. As the war progressed, groups of detainees were transferred to and from other prisons according to their behaviour or level <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> <b>and</b> the number of inmates per institution. After the 1917 Halifax Explosion, prisoners were transferred to the 800-man Amherst Internment Camp at Amherst, Nova Scotia. One of the prisoners transferred may have been Leon Trotsky, although this is disputed.|$|E

25|$|In September/October 2009, it was {{announced}} that a new fire hazard system would replace the previous one.

This standardised Fire Danger Rating (FDR) was subsequently adopted by all Australian states in late 2009. Every day during the fire season the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) forecasts an outlook of the Fire Danger Index (FDI) by considering the predicted weather including temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and dryness of vegetation. On the highest risk days, residents are advised to leave the potentially affected areas.|$|E
25|$|Tsetse flies {{transmit}} {{a similar}} disease to humans, called African trypanosomiasis - human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) or sleeping sickness. An estimated 70 {{million people in}} 20 countries are at different levels <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> <b>and</b> only 3-4 million people are covered by active surveillance. The DALY index (disability-adjusted life years), an indicator to quantify the burden of disease, includes the impact of both the duration of life lost due to premature death and the duration of life lived with a disability. The annual burden of sleeping sickness is estimated at 2 million DALYs. Since the disease tends to affect economically active adults, the total cost to a family with a patient is about 25% of a year’s income.|$|E

The {{purpose of this study is}} to identify individual {{differences in}} Russian consumers according to their perceptions <b>of</b> health <b>risks</b> <b>and</b> benefits associated with fish consumption. By application of a cluster analysis on perceptions <b>of</b> personal <b>risks</b> <b>and</b> benefits associated with the consumption of fish, four groups of Russian consumers were classified as: very positive; positive; moderately positive; and ‘high risk–high benefit’ about the healthiness of fish consumption. Differences in perceptions <b>of</b> personal <b>risks</b> <b>and</b> benefits across consumers were related to self-reported fish consumption, optimism about personal <b>risks</b> <b>and</b> benefits, and optimism about personal knowledge about <b>risks</b> <b>and</b> benefits. Implications for the development of targeted health interventions to influence perceptions <b>of</b> <b>risks</b> <b>and</b> benefits associated with fish consumption, and ultimately fish consumption, are discussed. It is concluded that optimism regarding perceptions <b>and</b> knowledge <b>of</b> health <b>risks,</b> <b>and</b> health benefits should be taken into account when developing interventions aimed at consumer health...|$|R
25|$|In finance, {{a common}} problem is to choose a {{portfolio}} when there are two conflicting objectives — the desire to have the expected value of portfolio returns {{be as high as}} possible, and the desire to have risk, often measured by the standard deviation of portfolio returns, be as low as possible. This problem is often represented by a graph in which the efficient frontier shows the best combinations <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> <b>and</b> expected return that are available, and in which indifference curves show the investor's preferences for various risk-expected return combinations. The problem of optimizing a function of the expected value (first moment) and the standard deviation (square root of the second central moment) of portfolio return is called a two-moment decision model.|$|E
25|$|In 1931, Robinson was {{commissioned}} {{chief of the}} Bureau of Engineering (BuEng) with the rank of rear admiral, succeeding Rear Admiral Harry E. Yarnell. During this first of two nonconsecutive terms as the chief Navy engineer, Robinson helped stimulate the development of submarine electric propulsion. At the time, lightweight, high-speed engines {{were still in the}} experimental phase and no existing engine was suitable for submarine electric drive. Procuring such an engine was a venture requiring a level <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> <b>and</b> capital investment that was considered prohibitive for a private company. Rather than wait for the private sector to catch up to the Navy's requirements, Robinson launched an innovative bureau-sponsored competition that successfully drew private diesel contractors into the submarine propulsion market.|$|E
25|$|For example, assume an {{investor}} {{had to choose}} between two stocks. Stock A over the past 20 years had an average return of 10 percent, {{with a standard deviation of}} 20 percentage points (pp) and Stock B, over the same period, had average returns of 12 percent but a higher standard deviation of 30 pp. On the basis <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> <b>and</b> return, {{an investor}} may decide that Stock A is the safer choice, because Stock B's additional two percentage points of return is not worth the additional 10 pp standard deviation (greater risk or uncertainty of the expected return). Stock B is likely to fall short of the initial investment (but also to exceed the initial investment) more often than Stock A under the same circumstances, and is estimated to return only two percent more on average. In this example, Stock A is expected to earn about 10 percent, plus or minus 20 pp (a range of 30 percent to −10 percent), about two-thirds of the future year returns. When considering more extreme possible returns or outcomes in future, an investor should expect results of as much as 10 percent plus or minus 60 pp, or a range from 70 percent to −50 percent, which includes outcomes for three standard deviations from the average return (about 99.7 percent of probable returns).|$|E
