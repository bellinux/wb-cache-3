5|$|Successive Merina {{sovereign}}s ruled {{over the}} Kingdom of Imerina from Analamanga through King Andriamasinavalona's reign. This sovereign gave the growing city its current name; he established the Andohalo town square {{outside the town}} gate, where all successive sovereigns delivered their royal speeches and announcements to the public, and assigned the names of numerous locations within the city based on the names of similar sites in the nearby village of Antananarivokely. Andriamasinavalona designated specific territories for the hova (commoners) and each andriana (noble) subcaste, both within the neighborhoods of Antananarivo and in the countryside surrounding the capital. These territorial divisions were strictly enforced; members of subcastes were required to live within their designated territories and were not authorized to stay for extended periods in the territories reserved for others. Numerous fady (taboos), including injunctions against the construction <b>of</b> <b>wooden</b> <b>houses</b> by non-nobles {{and the presence of}} swine within the city limits, were imposed.|$|E
5|$|The Russians {{assaulted}} {{the second}} Polish line and pierced it in numerous places. The position of Russian infantry {{was very difficult}} because it overtook the 14 Polish guns sent forward by General Bem to support the Polish counter-attack, which meant that it was under artillery fire from the front, the sides and the rear. Eventually a counter-attack by the 4th Line Infantry Regiment under Lt. Col. Kazimierz Majewski repelled the Russians storming the Polish lines. Several smaller Russian units broke through and tried to fortify a group <b>of</b> <b>wooden</b> <b>houses</b> in the suburb of Wola, but were quickly surrounded and killed. At that point, around 13:00, Małachowski wanted to organise yet another counter-attack aimed at Fort 56, but his orders were overridden by Krukowiecki, who feared that the Russians might want to attack further south, near Jerozolimskie Gate, and preferred to keep his reserves intact. The Polish side ceased all offensive actions on the western front, and only the artillery remained active.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of the}} {{modernisation}} wave of the 1950s and 1960s, and due {{to damage}} caused by World War II, the city government ambitiously planned redevelopment of many areas in central Bergen. The plans involved demolition of several neighbourhoods <b>of</b> <b>wooden</b> <b>houses,</b> namely Nordnes, Marken, and Stølen. None of the plans {{was carried out in}} its original form; the Marken and Stølen redevelopment plans were discarded and that of Nordnes only carried out in the area that had been most damaged by war. The city council of Bergen had in 1964 voted to demolish the entirety of Marken, however, the decision proved to be highly controversial and the decision was reversed in 1974. Bryggen was under threat of being wholly or partly demolished after the fire of 1955, when a large number of the buildings burned to the ground. Instead of being demolished, the remaining buildings were restored and accompanied by reconstructions of some of the burned buildings.|$|E

2500|$|The {{settlement}} of New Plymouth—at the time [...] "a line <b>of</b> <b>wooden</b> <b>houses</b> straggling untidily {{along the waterfront}} and intersected by bush-filled gullies which provided perfect cover for an attacking party"—was deemed vulnerable to assault by hostile Māori because of tensions over land sales and a detachment of British troops {{had been placed in}} the settlement in 1855. The killing of Katatore, an opponent of land selling at Waitara, in January 1858—which in turn sparked more feuding among local Māori and threats of a revenge massacre at Waitara by Kingi—prompted the formation of the Taranaki Militia in 1858 and Taranaki Volunteer Rifle Company in 1859.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{development}} in the Spring Creek area {{took place in the}} 1890s, a [...] farm built by the Cozine family, the likely namesake of Cozine Avenue. This farm included a house and stable at the modern-day intersection of Elton Street and Vandalia Avenue. Plunders Neck, then a peninsula between Betts and Spring Creeks, took its name from pirates who occupied the waters and [...] "plundered." [...] In the late 19th century it hosted a small community <b>of</b> <b>wooden</b> <b>houses</b> housing around 50 families who fished and farmed in the area. A hotel was erected along Mill Pond, near the basin of the creeks, at what was called Forbell's Landing. Otherwise, the area remained uninhabited.|$|E

2500|$|Andy Lau {{was born}} in Tai Po, Hong Kong. A son of a fireman (劉禮), {{as a young boy}} Lau had to fetch water for his family up to eight times a day because their house was not {{equipped}} with plumbing, and his family was considered wealthy as his grandfather was a landowner, but his father left with him to the slums of Diamond Hill when he was 6, where the area was full <b>of</b> <b>wooden</b> <b>houses,</b> and was burnt down when he was 11. [...] He later graduated from a Band One secondary school, Ho Lap College in San Po Kong, Kowloon. He was named as Lau Fook-wing (劉福榮) during his academic years. He also practices Chinese calligraphy. Lau converted to Buddhism in the 1980s. He was raised in a nominally Buddhist household and is now a follower of the Lingyan Mountain Temple in Taiwan.|$|E
2500|$|Ignoring {{the wishes}} of William Wakefield, who wanted the initial {{settlement}} at the southwest side of the harbour where there were excellent anchorages for ships, Surveyor-General William Mein Smith began in January 1840 to lay out 1100 one-acre (4047 m2) sections of the town, initially called [...] "Britannia", on the flat land at Pito-one (now Petone), at {{the north of the}} harbour. The sections, near the mouth of the Hutt River, were laid out in parallelograms, with the plan including boulevards and public parks. Settlers who had bought a town section had also bought 100 [...] "country acres" [...] (about 40ha), where they could grow their food. Smith considered it important to locate the town and country areas close together and the Hutt Valley appeared to promise that space. The drawback was that his chosen locality was a mix of dense forest, scrub, flax and swamp, its river was prone to flooding and the beach so flat that when the first passenger ships began to arrive—just four days after Smith began his survey work—they were forced to anchor 1600 metres from the shore. But construction of temporary houses began, as well as the assembly <b>of</b> <b>wooden</b> <b>houses</b> that had been carried on each ship, while tents also soon dotted the dunes behind the beach. Local Māori assisted with the construction and also provided food—fish, potatoes and other vegetables and occasionally pork.|$|E

The region around them was a vast uncultivated, uninhabited solitude. The road that led to them was a rude one. It wound round a rugged cliff, under the shelter of which the houses nestled as if for protection from the cold winds and the snowdrifts that took special delight in revelling there.|$|E

The place is not attractive during the earlier portion of the short northern summer, when for {{the greater part of}} every week it lies sweltering in heat, in spite of the strong west winds that drive dust-clouds through its rutted streets.

60|$|The blue {{reflections}} of big arc-lamps quivered between the foam-flakes on the river, {{a line of}} bright spots, stretching back along the bank, marked new avenues <b>of</b> <b>wooden</b> <b>houses,</b> and, across the bridge, the tops of tall buildings cut against the glow that shimmered about the town. At one end rose the great block of the Hulton factory, which lost something of its utilitarian ugliness at night. Its harsh, rectangular outline faded into the background of forest, and the rows of glimmering windows gave it a curious transparent look. It seemed to overflow with radiance and filled the air with rumbling sound.|$|E

The rambling wooden building which combined the callings of general store and hotel was all in darkness, for the owner expected no guests just then, and would not have got up for any one but my companion if he had.

The maple leaves had fallen and they lined the gutters of the asphalted streets. It was a day of pale gold and faded green, tranquil and lingering. Babbitt was aware of the meditative day, and of the barrenness of Bellevue--blocks <b>of</b> <b>wooden</b> <b>houses,</b> garages, little shops, weedy lots. [...] "Needs pepping up; needs the touch that people like Mrs. Judique could give a place," [...] he ruminated, as he rattled through the long, crude, airy streets.

60|$|The {{country had}} been a place of terror; but the town was in its way even more depressing. Down that long valley {{there was at least}} a certain gloomy {{grandeur}} in the huge fires and the clouds of drifting smoke, while the strength and industry of man found fitting monuments in the hills which he had spilled by the side of his monstrous excavations. But the town showed a dead level of mean ugliness and squalor. The broad street was churned up by the traffic into a horrible rutted paste of muddy snow. The sidewalks were narrow and uneven. The numerous gas-lamps served only to show more clearly a long line <b>of</b> <b>wooden</b> <b>houses,</b> each with its veranda facing the street, unkempt and dirty.|$|E

Many of them had singularly bright doors of red and yellow; for the place had been lately visited by a travelling painter, 'who got along,' as I was told, 'by eating his way.' The criminal court was sitting, and was at that moment trying some criminals for horse-stealing: with whom it would most likely go hard: for live stock of all kinds being necessarily very much exposed in the woods, is held by the community in rather higher value than human life; and for this reason, juries generally make a point of finding all men indicted for cattle-stealing, guilty, whether or no.|$|E
