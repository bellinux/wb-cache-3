40|$|Future human-computer {{interfaces}} {{will use}} {{more than just}} graphical <b>output</b> <b>to</b> <b>display</b> information. In this paper we suggest that sound and graphics together {{can be used to}} improve interaction. We describe an experiment to improve the usability of standard graphical menus by the addition of sound. One common difficulty is slipping off a menu item by mistake when trying to select it. One of the causes of this is insufficient feedback. We designed and experimentally evaluated a new set of menus with much more salient audio feedback to solve this problem. The results from the experiment showed a significant reduction in the subjective effort required to use the new sonically-enhanced menus along with significantly reduced error recovery times. A significantly larger number of errors were also corrected with sound...|$|E

Creating a virtual hand with natural hand gestures would improve human hand HCI research by providing hand ground truth data for hand analysis systems and generating visual output for hand simulation systems. The human hand is highly articulated (with many joints) and organic (with considerable deformation during hand motion). Thus, hand modeling {{is an important part of}} overall human body simulation. Sophisticated algorithms and implementations in hand modeling and animation already exist—for example, modeling with underlying anatomical structure, 2 datadriven algorithms in hand animation, 3 and example-based deformable modeling using medical images. 4 As an alternative, our virtual hand considers human hand movement constraints, has less deformation, and allows realistic real-time animation. Our modeling and rendering algorithms are also more efficient; the system emphasizes the interactions between the han...|$|E

40|$|The {{large number}} of {{experimentally}} determined protein 3 D structures is a rich resource for studying protein function and evolution, and protein structure comparison (PSC) is a key method for such studies. When comparing two protein structures, almost all currently available PSC servers report a single and sequential (i. e. topological) alignment, whereas the existence of good alternative alignments, including those involving permutations (i. e. non-sequential or non-topological alignments), is well known. We have recently developed a novel PSC method that can detect alternative alignments of statistical significance (alignment similarity P-value < 10 − 5), including structural permutations {{at all levels of}} complexity. OPAAS, the server of this PSC method freely accessible at our website (), provides an easy-to-read hierarchical layout of <b>output</b> <b>to</b> <b>display</b> detailed information on all of the significant alternative alignments detected. Because these alternative alignments can offer a more complete picture on the structural, evolutionary and functional relationship between two proteins, OPAAS can be used in structural bioinformatics research to gain additional insight that is not readily provided by existing PSC servers...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Although the {{graphics}} processing unit (GPU) was originally designed to accelerate the image creation for <b>output</b> <b>to</b> <b>display,</b> today’s general purpose GPU (GPGPU) computing offers unprecedented performance by offloading computing-intensive portions of the application to the GPGPU, while running {{the remainder of the}} code on the central processing unit (CPU). The highly parallel structure of a many core GPGPU can process large blocks of data faster using multithreaded concurrent processing. A game engine has many “components” and multithreading can be used to implement their parallelism. However, effective implementation of multithreading in a multicore processor has challenges, such as data and task parallelism. In this paper, we investigate the impact of using a GPGPU with a CPU to design high-performance game engines. First, we implement a separable convolution filter (heavily used in image processing) with the GPGPU. Then, we implement a multiobject interactive game console in an eight-core workstation using a multithreaded asynchronous model (MAM), a multithreaded synchronous model (MSM), and an MSM with data parallelism (MSMDP). According to the experimental results, speedup of about 61 x and 5 x is achieved due to GPGPU and MSMDP implementation, respectively. Therefore, GPGPU-assisted parallel computing has the potential to improve multithreaded game engine performance...|$|E

50|$|The Spreadsheet Value RuleComputer {{scientist}} Alan Kay {{used the}} term value rule to summarize a spreadsheets operation: a cells value relies solely on the formula the user has typed into the cell.

50|$|Radar systems {{generally}} work {{by connecting}} an antenna to a powerful radio transmitter to emit a short pulse of signal.
