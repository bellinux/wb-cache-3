The pilot/gunner need not position their head to align the sight line precisely {{as they did}} in two-point mechanical sights, head position is only limited to that determined by the optics in the collimator, mostly by the diameter of the collimator lens. The sight does not interfere with the <b>overall</b> <b>view,</b> particularly when the collimator light is turned off. Both eyes may be used simultaneously for sighting.|$|E

25|$|Some San Francisco residents, {{especially}} in the Sunset and Richmond districts of the city, still {{found it difficult to}} receive an adequate over-the-air signal, because they are shielded by San Bruno Mountain. Most of the other Bay Area stations operate from Sutro Tower, which has a better <b>overall</b> <b>view</b> of San Francisco proper, although at the expense of those in northern San Mateo County, where San Bruno Mountain acts as a shield. However, most of the Bay Area is covered with a strong signal from all of the stations. The year closed, however, with a devastating wildfire at the retired transmitting facility on Loma Prieta. The fire was quickly extinguished on the afternoon of December 31; however, the fire reignited after firefighters had left the scene, and destroyed the former primary analog and digital transmitters, which had only been retired a few months earlier and were in backup status, as well as a variety of other communications equipment.|$|E

500|$|Notwithstanding Eisenhower's {{estimation}} of Patton's abilities {{as a strategic}} planner, his <b>overall</b> <b>view</b> of Patton's military value in achieving Allied victory in Europe can best be seen in Eisenhower's refusal to even consider sending Patton home after the slapping incidents of 1943, after which he privately remarked, [...] "Patton is indispensable to the war effort– one of the guarantors of our victory." [...] As Assistant Secretary of War John J. McCloy told Eisenhower: [...] "Lincoln's remark after they got after Grant comes to mind when I think of Patton– 'I can't spare this man, he fights'." [...] After Patton's death, Eisenhower would write his own tribute: [...] "He {{was one of those}} men born to be a soldier, an ideal combat leader...

Ursula K. Le Guin said, [...] "I have no great opinion of it. When so many adult critics were carrying on about the 'incredible originality' of the first Harry Potter book, I read it {{to find out what the}} fuss was about, and remained somewhat puzzled; it seemed a lively kid's fantasy crossed with a [...] "school novel", good fare for its age group, but stylistically ordinary, imaginatively derivative, and ethically rather mean-spirited." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bishop Untener's {{career was}} marked by a {{consistent}} focus on egalitarianism in the church, ministry {{to the poor and}} participative liturgy. [...] His liberal views often put him at odds with orthodox Catholics and with the Vatican. He was regarded as being sensitive to the viewpoints of liberal Catholics. His <b>overall</b> <b>view</b> was that one should keep an open mind, consider the logic of one's actions and how they affect the church, and reflect openly over controversial issues.

2500|$|When {{infidelity}} {{involves a}} former romantic partner, {{as opposed to}} a new partner, it is perceived to be more distressing - especially for women.

[...] The typical man, however, viewed only the former partner scenario as more distressing with regard to sexual infidelity; men made no distinction for emotional infidelity. [...] Women, however, view a former partner scenario as the most distressing option for both sexual and emotional infidelity. Men and women both judge infidels of the opposite gender as acting more intentionally than their own gender.|$|E

[...] A review in The Guardian echoed this interpretation and stated that [...] "despite all of the books' gestures to multiculturalism and gender equality, Harry Potter is a conservative; a paternalistic, One-Nation Tory, perhaps, but a Tory nonetheless."
