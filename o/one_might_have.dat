25|$|In 1903, his {{appearances}} were {{restricted to}} three matches in June and August, but England were {{desperate for a}} captain for that winter's Ashes tour. Foster was (oddly) able to arrange {{to be away from}} England. Although <b>one</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> feared that he would be out of practice, in the first Test at Sydney in 1903, Foster scored 287. This was the highest score in Test cricket until 1930 (surpassed by Andy Sandham), and remains the highest score by a debutant and the third highest by a batsman of any nationality against Australia, home or away (surpassed only by Len Hutton's 364 in 1938 & Ross Taylor's 290 in 2015). For more than a century, Foster also held the record for the highest score in a test match at the SCG, his score not being beaten until Australian Michael Clarke scored 329 not out against India in January 2012. Foster did not follow it up, until the final Test on a vicious wicket at Melbourne, where he top-scored in both innings with 18 (in a total of 61 all out) and, having been promoted to open, an excellent 30 (out of 101 all out).|$|E

In concluding Collon states: [...] " [...] believed that, with time, a forgery would look worse and worse, whereas a genuine object would grow better and better. [...] Over the years [...] has indeed grown better and better, {{and more and more}} interesting. For me she is a real work of art of the Old Babylonian period." ...|$|E
500|$|The album {{received}} a mixed reception. Blair Sanderson of AllMusic found Svoboda's compositions to be imitative, specifically comparing Overture of the Season {{to work by}} Leoš Janáček and Symphony No. 1 to [...] "equal parts" [...] of Hugo Alfvén and Jean Sibelius, with [...] "just a dash" [...] of Carl Nielsen. Sanderson criticized the harmonic language of Concerto for Marimba and Orchestra and found DePonte's performance to be admirable but [...] "weakly planned". Similarly, Robert Dettmer of Classical CD Review found Svoboda's work to be derivative and [...] "expressively sterile", and [...] "no more engaging than any other marimba concerto". However, Dettmer acknowledged that the marimba {{was one of his}} least favorite solo instruments. Dettmer wrote that DePriest [...] "serves the composer dutifully, but not as enliveningly as <b>one</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> expected".|$|E

This is hinted at in the album's liner booklet, which notes [...] "Nick Cave and the Dirty Three {{would like you to}} know that [...] "0" [...] is also a number". The use of these hidden tracks has been described as [...] "just the sort of surprise <b>one</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> suspected from a show that deals in unexplainable mysteries".

In the production, {{he plays a}} teacher who is ready {{to settle down and}} marry, but decides to visit four ex-girlfriends first. For his performance, Schwimmer {{received}} critical reviews. The Independent wrote that Schwimmer [...] "is not called upon to extend his range nearly as far as <b>one</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> expected in Some Girl(s). [...] Schwimmer remains bland, competent, and boyish—though not fatally boyish in the manner that appears to have turned these women on". However, Charles Spencer of The Daily Telegraph praised Schwimmer, reporting he [...] "proves inspired casting. He takes to the stage with... his endearing gaucheness seems designed to ensure our continued sympathy. Schwimmer mercilessly lays bare his character's opportunism, casual cruelties, and chronic self-deception".|$|E
500|$|Most of Yonkers' {{economy in}} the early 19th century {{was derived from the}} Saw Mill River. As of 1813, there was a small wharf {{slightly}} upstream from the mouth where the sloops that carried river trade put in. Five small mills existed along the river above the village, all with their own dams, small mill ponds, and nearby tenements for the workers. The stagecoach route up the Post Road stopped at an inn near the bridge; a few stores existed to supply the workers there and at the mills. [...] Some pastures and orchards existed, but the rocky soil deterred most attempts at farming. (A historian later wrote that it was said at the time that [...] "the succession of boulders was so continuous that <b>one</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> stepped from Getty Square to the present Glenwood without setting his foot upon the ground".) Between the rocky soil and Wells' general refusal to sell or lease most of his land, there were so few settlers in Yonkers that two schoolhouses built during the Revolution fell into severe neglect {{due to the lack of}} students.|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{after the}} return home in November 1936 Riley, {{together}} {{with three other}} Jarrow councillors who had led the march—James Hanlon, Paddy Scullion and Joseph Symonds—left Labour to form a breakaway group committed to a more direct fight for employment. All four later rejoined the party; Scullion and Symonds both served as the town's mayor, and Symonds was Labour MP for Whitehaven from 1959 to 1970. In 1939 Wilkinson published her history of Jarrow, The Town that Was Murdered. A reviewer for The Economic Journal found the book [...] "not quite as polemical as <b>one</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> expected", but felt that in her denunciation of the BISF Wilkinson had not taken full account {{of the state of}} the iron and steel industry in the 1930s. Wilkinson continued her parliamentary career, and from 1940 to 1945 held junior ministerial office in Churchill's wartime coalition government. In the 1945 Labour government she was appointed Minister of Education, with a seat in the cabinet, a post in which she served until her death, aged 55, in February 1947.|$|E

Then [...] turns to the female Jewish indentured servant, who <b>one</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> thought was included in the generalization about Jewish indentured servants.

Rather, the Torah applies a more lenient rule to the female Jewish indentured servant, as she may go free before six years have passed – upon the onset of puberty or the death of her master. And [...] also applies a more stringent rule to the female Jewish indentured servant, as she may be betrothed against her will to the master or his son.|$|E

With their third attempt on 30 April 1993, the trio won because of [...] "their obvious talent and charisma." [...] Part of the grand prize was a {{recording}} session for a 4-track demo at Sweet Silence Studios, which spawned the songs [...] "Waterline" [...] and [...] "Silverflame" [...] that became huge hits on DR P3 and DR P4. The grand prize also contained a spot in the travelling Rock Show '93 and performances at the L'Europe d'Art d'Art festival in Niort, France, the Nordic Rock '93 competition that they also won, and all the major Danish summer festivals.

2500|$|Torah {{was given}} over dimus parrhesia in a maqom hefker (a place {{belonging}} to no one). For {{had it been}} given in the Land of Israel, {{they would have had}} cause to say to the nations of the world, “you have no share in it.” Thus was it given dimus parrhesia, in a place belonging to no one: “Let all who wish to receive it, come and receive it!” Why was the Torah not given in the land of Israel? In order that the peoples of the world should not have the excuse for saying: `Because it was given in Israel's land, therefore we have not accepted it. Another reason: To avoid causing dissension among the tribes [...] Else <b>one</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> said: In my land the Torah was given. And the other might have said: In my land the Torah was given. Therefore, the Torah was given in the Midbar (wilderness), dimus parrhesia, in a place belonging to no one. To three things the Torah is likened: to the Midbar (wilderness), to fire, and to water. This is to tell you that just as these three things are free to all who come into the world, so also are the words of the Torah free to all who come into the world.|$|E
