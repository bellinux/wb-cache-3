To do the latter, a kiwi would stick its beak into the ground, then use its beak to dig into the ground. As they are nocturnal, they do not emerge until thirty minutes after sunset to begin the hunt.

5|$|In mid-2014, {{having just}} {{finished}} their previous collaboration, Fatale, Brubaker and artist Sean Phillips were deliberating whether their next project {{would be a}} noir period piece or a science fiction tale. Brubaker did not think a noir set in 1940s Hollywood was commercial enough to be accepted through normal channels, but the timing aligned with their five-year exclusive contract with Image Comics. This contract guaranteed that the creators could publish any comic without having to pitch it to the publisher first. The pair announced The Fade Out and their new contract on January 9, 2014, at Image Expo. At the time, no length was given for the series {{because they were not}} sure how many issues were needed to tell the story. Since Fatale had taken twice as long as originally planned, {{they did not want to}} mislead fans <b>or</b> <b>feel</b> pressure to conclude before they were ready. They did know it would be a minimum of 12 issues.|$|E

Their heart rate responds less quickly to exertion due to the cutting of the vagus nerve that would normally help regulate it. They may also notice a change in their voice due to potential damage to the nerves that coordinate the vocal cords.|$|E

50|$|According to {{the ethical}} objectivist, {{the truth or}} {{falsehood}} of typical moral judgments does not depend upon the beliefs or feelings of any person or group of persons. This view holds that moral propositions are analogous to propositions about chemistry, biology, or history, in so much as they are true despite what anyone believes, hopes, wishes, <b>or</b> <b>feels.</b> When they fail to describe this mind-independent moral reality, they are false—no matter what anyone believes, hopes, wishes, <b>or</b> <b>feels.</b>|$|R

25|$|Modern humans {{often find}} {{themselves}} desynchronized from their internal circadian clock, due {{to the requirements of}} work (especially night shifts), long-distance travel, and the influence of universal indoor lighting. Even if they have sleep debt, <b>or</b> <b>feel</b> sleepy, people can have difficulty staying asleep at the peak of their circadian cycle. Conversely they can have difficulty waking up in the trough of the cycle. A healthy young adult entrained to the sun will (during most of the year) fall asleep a few hours after sunset, experience body temperature minimum at 6AM, and wake up a few hours after sunrise.|$|E
25|$|The issues {{surrounding}} body image can be examined through, body negativity, and body positivity. Negative body image {{consists of a}} disoriented view of one’s shape; whereby they often feel self-conscious <b>or</b> <b>feel</b> ashamed, and assume others are more attractive. Aside from having low self-esteems, suffers typically fixate on altering their physical appearances. Long-term behavior could thus potentially lead to higher risks of eating disorders, isolation, and mental illnesses. Positive body image on the other hand, {{is described as a}} clear true perception of one’s figure. In addition to celebrating and appreciating the body, it also requires an understanding that an individual’s appearance does not reflect their character or self worth.|$|E

25|$|There is {{a common}} sense of {{confusion}} between the difference of PTSD and a normal response to trauma. If an athlete injures himself or herself in a horrific way, it is normal {{for them to go}} through some adversity before overcoming the injury. They may develop small flashbacks, have bad dreams, <b>or</b> <b>feel</b> like they can't get the traumatic experience out of their mind, however, depending on the athlete’s mental ability, or how determined they are within their chosen sport, these symptoms can be lifted in time. Along with this, those athletes who are weaker mentally are the ones who tend to not be able to recover themselves and fall into the category of PTSD.|$|E
25|$|Stroke is {{a medical}} {{condition}} in which poor {{blood flow to the}} brain results in cell death. There are two main types of stroke: ischemic, due to lack of blood flow, and hemorrhagic, due to bleeding. They result in part of the brain not functioning properly. Signs and symptoms of a stroke may include an inability to move <b>or</b> <b>feel</b> {{on one side of the}} body, problems understanding or speaking, feeling like the world is spinning, or loss of vision to one side. Signs and symptoms often appear soon after the stroke has occurred. If symptoms last less than one or two hours it is known as a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or mini-stroke. A hemorrhagic stroke may also be associated with a severe headache. The symptoms of a stroke can be permanent. Long-term complications may include pneumonia or loss of bladder control.|$|E
25|$|Although {{there are}} many {{contributing}} factors and risks associated with strokes, {{there are very few}} associated with Dejerine–Roussy syndrome and thalamic lesions specifically. In general, strokes damage one hemisphere of the brain, which can include the thalamus. The thalamus is generally believed to relay sensory information between a variety of subcortical areas and the cerebral cortex. It is known that sensory information from environmental stimuli travels to the thalamus for processing and then to the somatosensory cortex for interpretation. The final product of this communication is the ability to see, hear <b>or</b> <b>feel</b> something as interpreted by the brain. Dejerine–Roussy syndrome most often compromises tactile sensation. Therefore, the damage in the thalamus causes miscommunication between the afferent pathway and the cortex of the brain, changing what or how one feels. The change could be an incorrect sensation experienced, or inappropriate amplification or dulling of a sensation. Because the brain is considered plastic and each individual's brain is different, {{it is almost impossible to}} know how a sensation will be changed without brain mapping and individual consultation.|$|E

25|$|It {{is thought}} that during the hunt only {{those people who have}} been {{selected}} by the spirit of the sea could kill the whale. The hunter has to please the killed whale: it must be treated as a guest. Just like a polite host does not leave a recently arrived dear guest alone, thus similarly, the killed whale should not be left alone by the host (i.e. by the hunter who has killed it). Like a guest, it should not get hurt <b>or</b> <b>feel</b> sad. It must be entertained (e.g. by drum music, good foods). On the next whale migration (whales migrate twice a year, in spring to the north and in the autumn back), the previously killed whale is sent off back to the sea {{in the course of a}} farewell ritual. If the killed whale was pleased to (during its being a guest for a half year), then it can be hoped that it will return later, too: thus, also the future whale hunts will succeed.|$|E
500|$|After {{seeing the}} first three episodes, Maxwell Zachs called the series [...] "a disappointment". One reason for this, he says, is that {{although}} [...] "we see... lovely, endearing transsexuals" [...] portrayed in the show, [...] "what I don’t see is anything {{that is going to}} make people think <b>or</b> <b>feel</b> any differently about what gender is or how it limits us all in one way or another." [...] He lamented that their expressions of nuance in gender identity and discussions of genderqueerness were absent from the broadcast edit of the show.|$|E

They may be poorly coordinated, or have an odd or bouncy gait or posture, poor handwriting, or problems with visual-motor integration. They may show problems with proprioception (sensation of body position) on measures of developmental coordination disorder (motor planning disorder), balance, tandem gait, and finger-thumb apposition. There {{is no evidence that}} these motor skills problems differentiate AS from other high-functioning ASDs.|$|E
