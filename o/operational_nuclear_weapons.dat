5000|$|Israel is {{believed}} to have begun full-scale production of <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> following the 1967 Six-Day War, although it had built its first <b>operational</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapon</b> by December 1966. A CIA report from early 1967 stated that Israel had the materials to construct a bomb in six to eight weeks and some authors suggest that Israel had two crude bombs ready for use during the war. According to US journalist Seymour Hersh, everything was ready for production at this time save an official order to do so. Israel crossed the nuclear threshold {{on the eve of the}} Six Day War in May 1967. “Minister Levi Eshkol, according to a number of Israeli sources, secretly ordered the Dimona reactor scientists to assemble two crude nuclear devices. He placed them under the command of Brigadier General Yitzhak Yaakov, the chief of research and development in Israel’s Defense Ministry. One official said the operation was referred to as Spider because the nuclear devices were inelegant contraptions with appendages sticking out. The crude atomic bombs were readied for deployment on trucks that could race to the Egyptian border for detonation in the event Arab forces overwhelmed Israeli defenses.” ...|$|R

5000|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of World War II, there occurred several armed incidents between Yugoslavia and the Western Allies. Following the war, Yugoslavia acquired the Italian territory of Istria as well as the cities of Zadar and Rijeka. Yugoslav leadership was looking to incorporate Trieste into the country as well, which was opposed by the Western Allies. This led to several armed incidents, notably attacks by Yugoslav fighter planes on US transport aircraft, causing bitter criticism from the west. From 1945 to 1948, at least four US aircraft were shot down. Stalin was opposed to these provocations, as he felt the USSR unready to face the West in open war so soon after the losses of World War II and at the time when US had <b>operational</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> whereas USSR had yet to conduct its first test. In addition, Tito was openly supportive of the Communist side in the Greek Civil War, while Stalin kept his distance, having agreed with Churchill not to pursue Soviet interests there, although he did support the Greek communist struggle politically, as demonstrated in several assemblies of the UN Security Council. In 1948, motivated by the desire to create a strong independent economy, Tito modeled his economic development plan independently from Moscow, which resulted in a diplomatic escalation followed by a bitter exchange of letters in which Tito wrote that [...] "We study and take as an example the Soviet system," [...] but develop it a different form.|$|E
5000|$|Israel {{has been}} {{reported}} in congressional testimony by the US Department of Defense of having aircraft-delivered nuclear weapons as early as the mid-1960s, a demonstrated missile-based force since the mid-1960s, an IRBM in the mid-1980s, an ICBM in the early 2000s and the suspected second-strike capability arrived with the Dolphin-class submarine and Popeye Turbo submarine-launched cruise missile. Israel is suspected of using their inventory of nuclear-capable fighter aircraft such as the long-range F-15E Strike Eagle, F-16 and formerly the F-4 Phantom, Dassault Mirage III, A-4 Skyhawk and Nesher. Israel has appreciable and growing numbers of long-range tanker aircraft and aerial refueling capacity on its long-range fighter-bomber aircraft, this capacity was used in the 1985 long-range conventional strike against the PLO in Tunisia. [...] Jane's Defence Weekly reports that the Israeli Dolphin-class submarines are widely believed to be nuclear armed, offering Israel a second-strike capability with a demonstrated range of at least 1500 km in a 2002 test. [...] According to an official report which was submitted to the American congress in 2004, it may be that with a payload of 1,000 kg the Jericho 3 gives Israel nuclear strike capabilities within the entire Middle East, Africa, Europe, Asia and almost all parts of North America, as well as within large parts of South America and North Oceania, Israel also has the regional reach of its Jericho 2 IRBM force. The existence of a nuclear force is often hinted at blatantly and evidence of an advanced weapons program including miniaturized and thermonuclear devices has been presented, especially the extensive photographic evidence given by former Israeli nuclear weapons assembler Mordechai Vanunu. There have been incidents where Israel has been suspected of testing, but so far Israel, for diplomatic reasons, has not openly admitted to having <b>operational</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons,</b> and so is only a suspect triad state.|$|E

Development of the technology in the warhead has benefited from the final series of French nuclear tests conducted in 1995-1996 in Moruroa, French Polynesia. The warhead's design and functionality were ultimately validated through simulation, particularly with DAM's Tera 100 supercomputer, Megajoule laser, and radiographic equipment.

This event was significant in the history of Pakistan and it provided both countries an environment of mutual confidence.

It was the second nuclear control treaty signed by both countries and pledged to continue the use of the first treaty, NNAA, was signed in 1988.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} is unlimitedNorth Korea's pursuit {{of nuclear weapons}} has shaken the foundations of U. S. policy in Northeast Asia. Because of North Korea's record of state-sponsored terrorism, illicit activities, human rights violations, arms sales, and fiery rhetoric, its development of <b>operational</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> is deeply disturbing. Although most agree North Korea should not possess nuclear weapons, nobody has a solution. This thesis evaluates three U. S. policy options for North Korean nuclear weapons: incentive-based diplomacy, coercive diplomacy, or military force. It analyzes them according to four criteria: the impact on North Korea's nuclear weapons, the impact on its neighbors (China, Japan, and South Korea), U. S. policy costs, and the precedent for future proliferation. This thesis shows that diplomacy will fail to achieve U. S. objectives for three reasons: lack of trust, DPRK reluctance to permit transparency, {{and the difficulty of}} conducting multilateral coercive diplomacy. Ultimately, Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage's question must be answered: "What price is the United States willing to pay to disarm North Korean nuclear weapons?" If Washington is unwilling to back a threat of military force, it should not risk coercive diplomacy. Likewise, U. S. leaders may need to decide between maintaining the U. S. -ROK alliance and eliminating North Korean nuclear weapons. Major, United States Air Forc...|$|E

40|$|Nuclear {{proliferation}} {{can be seen}} as {{occurring in}} two stages, the development of a <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> production program and the actual possession of weapons. The first stage, the presence of <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapon</b> programs, is (or at least has been) a de facto precondition for the manufacture and possession of <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons.</b> States intending to join the nuclear club must develop and maintain their own <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> programs {{as long as they are}} intent on ascending to nuclear status. The second stage involves actual <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> possession. The five major powers proceeded to develop nuclear devices almost as soon as each possessed sufficient <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> technology.
