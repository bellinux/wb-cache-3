5|$|After {{the defeat}} of the Japanese in the Battle of Sattelberg, Australian Army forces broke through the Japanese {{positions}} around Finschhafen. Constant pressure from US Navy PT boats, Australian land forces and Allied aircraft brought the Japanese logistical system to the brink <b>of</b> <b>collapse,</b> resulting in disease, malnutrition and privation for the Japanese soldiers. Meanwhile, the Allied supply system grappled with the problems of terrain and climate, particularly inclement weather and rough monsoonal seas that hampered and occasionally prevented delivery of supplies by sea.|$|E

5|$|An African prefecture, {{centered}} in Carthage, {{was established in}} April 534, but it would teeter on the brink <b>of</b> <b>collapse</b> during the next 15 years, amidst warfare with the Moors and military mutinies.

5|$|Gedi {{was made}} a {{historic}} monument in 1927. The site was declared a protected monument in 1929, after looters began removing Chinese porcelain inset as architectural decoration. In 1939, the Kenya Public Works Department began restoring structures that were at the greatest risk <b>of</b> <b>collapse.</b> Further site restoration, primarily clearing vegetation overgrowth, was conducted in 1948â€“1959 by James Kirkman, who was appointed warden of the site after Gedi and the surrounding forest was declared a national park in 1948.|$|E

50|$|In mathematics, {{particularly}} {{the area of}} topology, a simple-homotopy equivalence is a refinement {{of the concept of}} homotopy equivalence.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a method <b>of</b> {{detecting}} the <b>collapsed</b> buildings with the aerial images which are captured by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for the postseismic evaluation. Different from the conventional methods that apply the satellite images or the high-altitude UAV for the coarse disaster evaluation over large area, {{the purpose of this}} work is to achieve the accurate detection <b>of</b> <b>collapsed</b> buildings in small area from low altitude. By combining the motion and appearance features <b>of</b> <b>collapsed</b> buildings extracted from successive aerial images, each pixel in the input image will be measured by a statistical method where the background pixels will be penalized and the ones <b>of</b> <b>collapsed</b> buildings will be assigned with high value. The candidates <b>of</b> <b>collapsed</b> buildings will be established by integrating the extracted feature points into local groups with the online clustering algorithm. To reduce the false alarm caused by the complex background noise, each predicted candidate will be further verified by the temporal tracking framework where both the trajectory and the appearance of a candidate will be measured. The candidate <b>of</b> <b>collapsed</b> buildings that can survive through long time will be considered as true positive, otherwise rejected as a false alarm. Through extensive experiments, the efficiency and the effectiveness of proposed algorithm have been proved...|$|R

5|$|In {{spite of}} these {{failures}} and challenges, Diocletian's reforms fundamentally changed the structure of Roman imperial government and helped stabilize the empire economically and militarily, enabling the empire to remain essentially intact for another 150 years despite being near the brink <b>of</b> <b>collapse</b> in Diocletian's youth. Weakened by illness, Diocletian left the imperial office on 1 May 305, {{and became the first}} Roman emperor to abdicate the position voluntarily. He lived out his retirement in his palace on the Dalmatian coast, tending to his vegetable gardens. His palace eventually became the core of the modern-day city of Split in Croatia.|$|E

5|$|Like other {{rulers of}} the period, Henry donated to the Church and patronised various {{religious}} communities, but contemporary chroniclers did not consider him an unusually pious king. His personal beliefs and piety may, however, have developed {{during the course of}} his life. Henry had always taken an interest in religion, but in his later years he may have become much more concerned about spiritual affairs. If so, the major shifts in his thinking would appear to have occurred after 1120, when his son William Adelin died, and 1129, when his daughter's marriage teetered on the verge <b>of</b> <b>collapse.</b>|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{despite the}} unpopularity {{of some of}} his measures, Alexios's efforts had been vital to the {{survival}} of the empire.

However, new research regarding paleoenvironmental proxies from the Tikal reservoir system suggests that a meteorological drought may have led to the abandonment of Tikal.|$|E

5|$|After several {{diplomatic}} {{failures and}} military defeats in the 1730s, Austria {{seemed to be}} declining, or even on the verge <b>of</b> <b>collapse.</b> After her forty years reign, Maria Theresa left a revitalised empire that influenced the rest of Europe throughout the 19thcentury. She gave the Habsburg dominions an efficient administrative system that allowed it to remain a great power in its own right, {{without the support of}} the Holy Roman Empire. Her descendants followed her example and continued reforming the empire. The acquisition of the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria gave the empire an even more multinational character that would ultimately lead to its destruction. Her introduction of compulsory schooling, as a means of Germanisation, eventually triggered the revival of Czech culture.|$|E

In Soul Reaver, Razielâ€”Kain's lieutenantâ€”is executed by Kain, but The Elder God resurrects him and encourages him to exact revenge. Traversing the wasteland and murdering the vampires, Raziel confronts Kain, who attacks him with the Soul Reaver sword, imbued with a spirit which absorbs its victims' souls. The Soul Reaver shatters when it strikes Raziel, and the blade's spirit binds itself to his arm. His motives still mysterious, Kain lures Raziel through a time portal into Nosgoth's past.|$|E
5|$|Children of Men is a 2006 British-American dystopian thriller film {{directed}} and co-written by Alfonso CuarÃ³n. The screenplay, based on P. D. James' 1992 {{novel of the}} same name, was credited to five writers, with Clive Owen making uncredited contributions. The film takes place in 2027, where two decades of human infertility have left society on the brink <b>of</b> <b>collapse.</b> Illegal immigrants seek sanctuary in the United Kingdom, where the last functioning government imposes oppressive immigration laws on refugees. Owen plays civil servant Theo Faron, who must help a refugee (Clare-Hope Ashitey) escape the chaos. Children of Men also stars Julianne Moore, Michael Caine, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and Charlie Hunnam.|$|E
5|$|Covered Bridges Today {{provides}} information on 412 bridges in the states of Connecticut, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia. The book is geographically focused on Krekeler's home state of Ohio and includes all 142 remaining covered bridges in the state {{at the time of}} writing. However, the book is not a complete inventory of each state's extant bridges. When it was written, 76 of an estimated 228 Pennsylvania's bridges were included, 68 of Indiana's 98 covered bridges, and 43 of Vermont's estimated 100 bridges were also featured. Krekeler's use of estimations stems from the facts that covered bridges are lost periodically and that the bridges detailed include those restored or in immediate danger <b>of</b> <b>collapse.</b> Within a year of the publication of the book, 30 bridges were lost. Known bridges in states that are not in the listing are not named or cited. For example, West Virginia had 17 remaining bridges at time of publication, but the book only covers 10 of them.|$|E
