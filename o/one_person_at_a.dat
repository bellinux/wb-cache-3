This {{prevented him from}} leaving the King William's Town magisterial district, prohibited him from speaking either in public or to more than <b>one</b> <b>person</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time, barred his membership of political organisations, and forbade the media from quoting him. As a result, he returned to Ginsberg, living initially in his mother's house and later in his own residence.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} effect {{an escape from}} the {{stricken}} vessel, the escaping crew were required to enter the submarine’s only escape chamber, which can only accommodate <b>one</b> <b>person</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time. As the pressure outside the submarine is greater than the pressure inside, this must be equalised before the outer door of the escape chamber is opened. The escape chamber is flooded with the occupant having to wait until the chamber is completely full of water. Only then will the pressure within the escape chamber be equal to the outside sea pressure.|$|E
25|$|The {{method of}} color {{photography}} used by Prokudin-Gorsky was first suggested by James Clerk Maxwell in 1855 and demonstrated in 1861, but good results were not {{possible with the}} photographic materials available at that time. In imitation of the way a normal human eye senses color, the visible spectrum of colors was divided into three channels of information by capturing it {{in the form of}} three black-and-white photographs, one taken through a red filter, one through a green filter, and one through a blue filter. The resulting three photographs could either be projected through filters of the same colors and exactly superimposed on a screen, synthesizing the original range of color additively; viewed as an additive color image by <b>one</b> <b>person</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time through an optical device known generically as a chromoscope or photochromoscope, which contained colored filters and transparent reflectors that visually combined the three into one full-color image; or used to make photographic or mechanical prints in the complementary colors cyan, magenta and yellow, which, when superimposed, reconstituted the color subtractively.|$|E

500|$|After {{completing}} German Ideology, Marx {{turned to}} a work that was intended to clarify his own position regarding [...] "the theory and tactics" [...] of a truly [...] "revolutionary proletarian movement" [...] operating {{from the standpoint of}} a truly [...] "scientific materialist" [...] philosophy. This work was intended to draw a distinction between the utopian socialists and Marx's own scientific socialist philosophy. Whereas the utopians believed that people must be persuaded <b>one</b> <b>person</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time to join the socialist movement, the way a person must be persuaded to adopt any different belief, Marx knew that people would tend on most occasions to act in accordance with their own economic interests, thus appealing to an entire class (the working class in this case) with a broad appeal to the class's best material interest would {{be the best way to}} mobilise the broad mass of that class to make a revolution and change society. This was the intent of the new book that Marx was planning, but to get the manuscript past the government censors he called the book The Poverty of Philosophy (1847) and offered it as a response to the [...] "petty bourgeois philosophy" [...] of the French anarchist socialist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon as expressed in his book The Philosophy of Poverty (1840).|$|E

2500|$|The {{association}} of bisexuality with promiscuity {{stems from a}} variety of negative stereotypes targeting bisexuals as mentally or socially unstable people for whom sexual relations only with men, only with women, or only with <b>one</b> <b>person</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time is not enough. These stereotypes may result from cultural assumptions that [...] "men and women are so different that desire for one is an entirely different beast from desire for the other" [...] ("a defining feature of heterosexism"), and that [...] "verbalizing a sexual desire inevitably leads to attempts to satisfy that desire." ...|$|E

2500|$|While archaeoastronomical {{studies have}} {{traditionally}} discussed {{these kinds of}} monument as observatories, fieldwork conducted in the 1990s at Balnuaran of Clava by Ronnie Scott and Tim Phillips suggests the midwinter sunset would have cast images inside two passage tombs. By temporarily reconstructing the collapsed roofs of these monuments, they noted {{that the act of}} viewing the sun along their passageways was not only potentially blinding but could only be clearly viewed by <b>one</b> <b>person</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time. In contrast, an audience of over twenty people could stand with their backs to the opening to observe the effects of sunlight falling upon deliberately patterned stonework built into walls of both chambers. [...] These observations inspired Scott to speculate that these structures were camera obscuras, and that an optical projection of the sun’s disc would reproduce the movements of the sun through the sky for many people to see at once.|$|E
2500|$|Polygamy may be {{polygyny}} (one man {{having more}} than one wife at the same time) or polyandry (one woman {{having more than}} one husband at the same time) {{and it has been}} practiced sparsely throughout history in almost all cultures and sanctioned by various religions where necessary to meet population or economic needs. For example, when disease, war or famine has reduced populations, the taking of several wives has been the solution to restoring population. In some economically poor areas where infant mortality is high but children are a vital source of labor to maintain the earning capacity of the family, polygamy provides more children. Some states have defined marriage as the union of one man to one woman [...] "to the exclusion of all others" [...] and, in some cases, have criminalized bigamy or, as in Canada, have made polygamy an offense under the Criminal Code. Under section 293(a) of the Canadian Criminal Code, everyone who enters into any form of polygamy or any [...] "conjugal union with more than <b>one</b> <b>person</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time" [...] is guilty of an offense, and under s. 293(b), there is a separate offense for any person who [...] "celebrates, assists or is a party to a rite that sanctions a polygamous marriage".|$|E

2500|$|The {{spread of}} {{partnership}} minyanim, according to Kaplowitz, {{does not follow}} a pattern based on proportionality to size of Orthodox populations. Rather, there are certain regions with clusters and other places with none at all. In his 2008 thesis, he noted: [...] "The Los Angeles area, with around two times as many Jews as the Chicago area, has one partnership minyan to Chicago’s three; Southeast Florida, with about twice as many Jews as Chicago, has none. [...] New Haven has a partnership minyan, but Philadelphia, with around twelve times as many Jews, does not. Ann Arbor has a partnership minyan but neither Detroit, Cleveland, nor Baltimore, each with over twelve times as many Jews, does (United Jewish Communities, 2002). [...] In fact, {{it is worth noting}} that there are no partnership minyanim in the Sunbelt except for that in Los Angeles; none west of the Atlantic seaboard and east of Michigan; and only one west of Chicago." [...] In his research of this sprawl, Kaplowitz concluded that this is because the partnership minyan is a culture that is transferred <b>one</b> <b>person</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time. The culture does not spread evenly; it spreads when one activist moves and decides to lead the new community towards change. The culture is carried by individuals who have developed an unwavering commitment to the model. In other words, the culture of partnership minyan is spreading because Orthodox people who participate in these kinds of prayer services often find that they can no longer be part of Orthodox services where women are relegated to [...] "traditional" [...] roles.|$|E

2500|$|It may be {{possible}} to uphold the distinction between persons whilst still aggregating utility, if it accepted that people can be influenced by empathy. This position is advocated by Iain King, who has suggested the evolutionary basis of empathy means humans can take into account the interests of other individuals, but only on a one-to-one basis, [...] "since we can only imagine ourselves in the mind of <b>one</b> other <b>person</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time."

50|$|The {{protection}} of the rights to arms is of signal importance {{because of the fact}} that persons and corporation have paid fees to the Crown in return for exclusive rights to use those armorial bearings.

Without such protection, a coat of arms would be useless as a form of identification and worthless as a piece of private property.
