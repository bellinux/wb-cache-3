A. G. Haultain, who was a Conservative in federal politics. Some Liberals, such as Peter Talbot, were amenable to Haultain's becoming the first Premier of Alberta, either as the head of a non-partisan government or one formed by a coalition <b>of</b> <b>Liberals</b> and Conservatives. Cross was not among them.|$|E
