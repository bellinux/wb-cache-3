40|$|Between 2002 and 2006, the United States Federal Reserve set {{interest}} rates significantly below the rates suggested by well-known monetary policy rules. There {{is a growing}} body of research suggesting that this helped fuel an excess of liquidity in the U. S. that contributed to the 2008 worldwide financial crash. What is less well known is that a number of <b>other</b> <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> also lowered {{interest rates}} during this period. An important question, then, is what role the Federal Reserve played in influencing <b>other</b> <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> to alter their own monetary policies, which could have magnified the Fed’s actions in creating global liquidity.

This interest rate parity does, however, no longer hold if central banks approach the zero lower bound on interest rates and switch to measures of quantitative easing. Therefore, the author estimates exchange rate changes based on the different stance of the monetary base, which is an indicator of differing monetary policies in the countries. The results reveal that indeed exchange rates movements in the Dollar-Euro-Rate {{can be explained by}} differences in the monetary base, since the zero lower bound has become binding.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the consequences for}} monetary policy of the zero floor for nominal interest rates. The zero bound can be a significant constraint {{on the ability of}} a central bank to combat deflation. The paper shows, {{in the context of an}} intertemporal equilibrium model, that open-market operations, even of "unconventional" types, are ineffective if future policy is expected to be purely forward looking. However, a credible commitment to the right sort of history-dependent policy can largely mitigate the distortions created by the zero bound. In the model, optimal policy involves a commitment to adjust interest rates so as to achieve a time-varying price-level target, when this is consistent with the zero bound. The paper also discusses ways in which <b>other</b> <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> actions, although irrelevant apart from their effects on expectations, may help to make a central bank's commitment to its target more credible. macroeconomics, Zero Bound, Interest Rates, Optimal Monetary Policy...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the importance of providing information necessary for the evaluation of public policies during the formulation phase. These policies often can be reformulated or adapted during the deployment process, making it difficult to identify during the formulation phase what information is needed for evaluation. This difficulty is especially manifested when the state is the formulator and independent agents are deployers, such as the financial inclusion policy discussed in this paper. Like <b>other</b> <b>Central</b> <b>Bank</b> (CB) policies, the financial inclusion project was formulated internally in the BC and implemented directly by financial system agents. Given these characteristics, we investigate this project under light of theories that articulate formulation, implementation and evaluation of public policies. From this study we conclude that, despite the impossibility of making a full estimate of the required information in the formulation stage, there are gains for the evaluation process if it is inserted into the formulation/implementation dynamics of public policies. ...|$|E

Such implications, however, have clearly manifested {{during the course of the}} 2007 - 2009 crisis.

40|$|African Studies Seminar series. Paper {{presented}} September, 1984 The South African Reserve Bank {{was opened}} on June 30, 1921, having been established under {{the provisions of}} the Currency and Banking Act (No. 31 of 1920). There was at the time only one <b>other</b> <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> in the British Empire, the Bank of England itself. The Act had been drafted after a situation of chaos developed in the South African monetary system. In March 1919, when the British Government abandoned its wartime rate of exchange between the pound sterling and gold, the pound depreciated to produce a ‘gold premium’. British gold sovereigns, obtainable for 20 s. from banks in S. A. now commanded a considerably higher price outside the country. Large numbers of coins were now smuggled out, contravening the S. A. government's ban on their export. Although the premium was effectively keeping many of the goldmines afloat, the S. A. banks found themselves in a disastrous situation, being forced to import, and provide to the public at 20 s. increasing numbers of coins purchased at the premium price. The eventual government response was to withdraw sovereigns from circulation, and to establish the Reserve Bank to prevent a recurrence of such an untenable situation. There was thus a fundamental restructuring of the form of regulation of the S. A. monetary system...|$|E
40|$|Globalisation and {{financial}} liberalisation {{has increased the}} linkages across countries in recent times. The existence of money market links {{has important implications for}} both domestic monetary policy and for investment decisions. This study examines the linkages between South Africa’s money market and selected major international money markets. The objectives of the study are firstly to examine the links between the repo rate of South Africa and the central bank rates of the EU, Japan, UK and US. Secondly, is to compare the influence of domestic and foreign monetary policy decisions on South Africa’s money market. The third objective is to examine the long run relationship between the South African money market and the money markets of its major trading partners. Three estimation techniques are used to examine the different links. Principal components analysis, four tests of cointegration, and stationarity tests of the spreads/risk premium between South Africa’s interest rates and the interest rates of the other countries. All three techniques show that there is no long-run link between South Africa’s central bank rates and the central bank rates of the other countries. This shows that the repo rate does not depend on movements in <b>other</b> <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> rates. Domestic money market interest rates respond strongly to changes in the repo rate whilst showing no dependence on central bank rates of the other countries. This confirms the autonomy of the South African Reserve Bank in carrying out policy objectives. When the risk premium is accounted for under the third technique, evidence of integration is found. This indicates that the risk premium plays a crucial part in the level of integration between South Africa and the countries included in the study. ...|$|E
40|$|I propose {{creation}} of a venture bank, able to multiply the capital of a venture capital firm by up to 47 times, without requiring access to the Federal Reserve or <b>other</b> <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> apart from settlement. This concept rests on insuring loans to expand Tier 1 and 2 capital. Profitability depends on overall portfolio performance, availability of default insurance notes, cost of default insurance, and the multiple of original capital (MOC) adopted by the venture bank. If the form that uses interbank funds is used, then it also depends on the interbank funds rates. I propose a new derivative financial instrument, the Default Insurance Note (DIN), to insure loans to venture investments. A DIN {{is similar to a}} credit default swap (CDS) but with a host of unique features. The features and operation of these new derivative instruments are outlined along with audit requirements. This instrument would be traded on open-outcry exchanges with special rules to ensure orderly operation of the market. It is the {{creation of}} public markets for DINs that makes possible the use of public market pricing to indirectly establish a market capitalization for the underlying venture-bank investment, which is the key to achieving regulatory acceptance of the fully-insured version of this proposal. That fully-insured version insulates the venture-bank from losses in most situations, and multiplies profitability quite dramatically in all scenarios. Ten year returns above 10 are attainable. I show that both where the DIN is a minor fraction of investment, and where the DIN insures 100 % of invested funds for the duration, in the normal range of returns the DIN underwriting business is profitable.
