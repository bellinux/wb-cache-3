5000|$|Weir skimmers {{function}} {{by allowing}} the oil floating {{on the surface of}} the water to flow over a weir. There are two main types of weir skimmer, those that require the weir height to be manually adjusted and those where the weir height is automatic or self-adjusting. Whilst manually adjusted weir skimmer types can have a lower initial cost, the requirement for regular manual adjustment makes self-adjusting weir types more popular in most applications. Weir skimmers will collect water if operating when oil is no longer present. To overcome this limitation most weir type skimmers contain an automatic water drain on the <b>oil</b> <b>collection</b> tank[...]|$|E

The environment team has also offered trainings for school community members in order to secure buy-in for the projects.
