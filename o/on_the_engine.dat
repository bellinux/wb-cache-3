5|$|Aircraft could undergo maintenance, {{and most}} {{functional}} and equipment tests carried out aboard - {{either in the}} hangar or on the deck. Some components and could be repaired on board, but other work was {{to be carried out}} by the workshops <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> repair and component repair ships that would accompany the maintenance carrier.|$|E
5|$|On 21 October 1960, {{the initial}} {{tethered}} flight, performed by XP831, {{was conducted at}} Dunsfold; {{at this stage of}} development, this feat had required the airframe to have been stripped of all extraneous weight and restrictions <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> meant it could not be run at full power for more than 2.5 minutes at a time. Several tethered flights took place, partially so that the test pilots could familiarise themselves with the hovering controls; on 4 November, the first tethered flight without use of the auto-stabiliser system was accomplished. In mid-November, conventional taxying trials were performed at speeds of up to 70 knots.|$|E
5|$|Steering was {{controlled}} by a single balanced rudder, which gave the ships excellent maneuverability. The rudder was augmented with special steering system <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> transmissions; they had gears that could drive half of the engines astern and half forward allowed the screws to assist in turning the ship at sharper angles. The ships tended toward lee helm in general conditions, but in heavy wind, they suffered from weather helm. Both vessels also suffered from severe leeway at low speeds, and the effect was especially pronounced for Nürnberg, owing to her larger superstructure.|$|E

5|$|The Patrouille Suisse flight {{demonstration}} {{team were}} prominent fliers of the Hawker Hunter for several decades. Squadron aircraft were fitted with smoke generators <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> exhausts and, later on, were painted in a distinctive red-and-white livery. The group officially formed on 22 August 1964, {{and used the}} Hunter as its display aircraft until it was withdrawn from use in 1994, the team continued to perform flight display using newer aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The fan {{diameter}} {{varies with}} the different models of the CFM56, and that change has a direct impact <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> performance. For example, the low-pressure shaft rotates {{at the same speed}} for both the CFM56-2 and the CFM56-3 models; the fan diameter is smaller on the -3, which lowers the tip speed of the fan blades. The lower speed allows the fan blades to operate more efficiently (5.5% more in this case), which increases the overall fuel efficiency of the engine (improving specific fuel consumption nearly 3%).|$|E
5|$|Each {{engine is}} {{equipped}} with a main engine controller (MEC), an integrated computer which controls all of the engine's functions (through the use of valves) and monitors its performance. Built by Honeywell Aerospace, each MEC originally comprised two redundant Honeywell HDC-601 computers, later upgraded to a system composed of two doubly redundant Motorola 68000 (M68000) processors (for a total of four M68000s per controller). Having the controller installed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> itself greatly simplifies the wiring between the engine and the launch vehicle, because all the sensors and actuators are connected directly to only the controller, each MEC then being connected to the orbiter's general purpose computers (GPCs) or the SLS's avionics suite via its own engine interface unit (EIU). Using a dedicated system also simplifies the software and thus improves its reliability.|$|E

5|$|The Department of Civil Aviation {{performed}} {{tests on}} {{parts of the}} DC-4 fuel system. Tests <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> fuel system showed that when the engine boost pump was operating, a vortex formed in the engine fuel tank. If {{a small amount of}} water was present, this vortex held the water in suspension and prevented it from entering the engine. The tests also showed that when the boost pump was turned off, the vortex dissipated and any water would soon find its way into the engine. Investigators believed this might explain why all engines were operating normally during the takeoff but at least one engine began to run roughly around the time the engine boost pumps would be turned off.|$|E
5|$|The command {{variant of}} the Tiger II was {{designated}} Panzerbefehlswagen Tiger Ausf. B. It had two versions, Sd.Kfz. 267 and Sd.Kfz. 268. These carried only 63 rounds of 8.8cm ammunition to provide room to accommodate the extra radios and equipment, and had additional armour <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> compartment. The Sd.Kfz. 267 was to have used FuG 8 and FuG 5 radio sets, with the most notable external changes being a two metre long rod antenna mounted on the turret roof and a Sternantenne D ("Star antenna D"), mounted on an insulated base (the 105mm Antennenfuß Nr. 1), which was protected by a large armoured cylinder. This equipment was located on the rear decking in a position originally used for deep-wading equipment. The Sd.Kfz. 268 used FuG 7 and FuG 5 radios with a two-metre rod antenna mounted on the turret roof and a 1.4 metre rod antenna mounted on the rear deck.|$|E
5|$|BioWare {{provided}} its Aurora Engine from Neverwinter Nights for the sequel. One of {{the decisions}} to use Aurora rather than build a new engine from scratch was the toolset—Obsidian wanted players {{to continue to be}} able to make content for the game, which may not have been possible with a new engine. BioWare made itself available to Obsidian with technical support <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine,</b> but Obsidian planned on completely overhauling Aurora, including its code. The designers wanted to improve the visuals of the first game with additions such as better lighting and textures, which required significant changes to the engine. The upgraded engine was referred to as Electron. Electron was designed to incorporate DirectX to make it compatible for a potential Xbox 360 release, but Obsidian eventually abandoned plans for a port to the system for financial reasons. The toolset that was used to create the game was also revamped, and included several additions like a customizable interface, a new dialogue format, and building assistants—similar to the wizards found in Microsoft Word and Excel. Like Neverwinter Nights, the toolset was included in the game's release for players to use.|$|E

The airline's logo is featured above the emergency exit doors on each side and the website is featured <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>engines.</b> <b>The</b> aircraft is named [...] "Arawak". Since mid-September 2012, <b>the</b> T <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tail has been modified and <b>the</b> website <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> have been removed and the logo above the emergency exits have been replaced by the before mentioned website.|$|R
50|$|A tax is {{collected}} under the Local Tax Act of 1950 that is paid every May based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine's</b> displacement. <b>The</b> tax is then determined by whether {{the vehicle is}} for business or personal use, based on exterior dimensions and engine displacement as defined under dimension regulations. The {{tax to be paid}} is then based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine's</b> displacement starting with engines below 1000cc, and increasing at 500cc intervals to a top bracket of 6000cc and above.|$|R
5|$|God of War: Chains of Olympus uses a proprietary, {{in-house}} engine {{referred to}} as the Ready at Dawn engine, which expanded <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> created for their previous game, Daxter (2006), to include a fluid and cloth simulator. The camera system was modified to cater to the fixed cinematic camera for God of War gameplay, and the lighting system was reworked to aid in presenting realistic graphics. The game was originally designed for the PlayStation Portable's restricted 222megahertz (MHz) processor. Ready at Dawn repeatedly contacted Sony regarding increasing the clock speed of the PSP on account of the difference to the game and had developed a version of the game with higher speed. Sony released a firmware upgrade that allowed games to use the full 333MHz processor. The faster processor allowed for more realistic blood effects, lighting effects, and shadows as well as improved enemy intelligence. The upgrade, however, noticeably decreased battery life. After the game's completion, Game Director Ru Weerasuriya stated multiplayer options and other puzzles, characters, and dialogue had to be removed due to time constraints.|$|E
