5|$|Although {{its origins}} are <b>obscure,</b> <b>the</b> {{site of the}} present ancient church {{has been used for}} Christian worship since it was settled in the early sixth century, {{probably}} by Saint Padarn, after whom it was named. Much of the early history of the church must remain speculative rather than definitive, due the absence of documentary or archaeological evidence. However, there are certain elements which are reasonably clear.|$|E
5|$|Current {{knowledge}} on genetic diversity is fragmentary {{and the total}} number of archaeal species cannot be estimated with any accuracy. Estimates of the number of phyla range from 18 to 23, of which only 8 have representatives that have been cultured and studied directly. Many of these hypothesized groups are known from a single rRNA sequence, indicating that the diversity among these organisms remains <b>obscure.</b> <b>The</b> Bacteria also contain many uncultured microbes with similar implications for characterization.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the lack}} of written sources on this period, much of Nerva's life has {{remained}} <b>obscure.</b> <b>The</b> most substantial surviving account of the reign of Nerva was written by the 3rd-century historian Cassius Dio. His Roman History, which spans nearly a millennium, from the arrival of Aeneas in Italy until the year 229, was composed more than one hundred years after Nerva had died. Further details are added by an abridged biography from the Epitome de Caesaribus, a work alleged to have been authored by the 4th-century historian Aurelius Victor.|$|E

One candidate for a heating mechanism is atmospheric interaction with ions in the planet's magnetic field. Other candidates are gravity waves from the interior that dissipate in the atmosphere. The thermosphere contains traces of carbon dioxide and water, which may have been deposited from external sources such as meteorites and dust.|$|E
5|$|Hartshead Pike is a stone tower {{on top of}} Hartshead Hill {{overlooking}} Ashton and Oldham.

5|$|The {{dominance}} of Latin among the literate elite may <b>obscure</b> <b>the</b> continuity of spoken languages, since all cultures within the Roman Empire were predominantly oral. In the West, Latin, {{referred to in}} its spoken form as Vulgar Latin, gradually replaced Celtic and Italic languages that were related to it by a shared Indo-European origin. Commonalities in syntax and vocabulary facilitated the adoption of Latin.|$|E
5|$|Despite the misgivings of the expedition's commanders, {{the fleet}} left Brest as {{scheduled}} on 15 December 1796, one day {{ahead of a}} message from the Directory calling off the entire operation. De Galles knew that the British would be watching Brest harbour: their frigates were a constant presence as part of the Inshore Squadron of the blockade. In an effort to disguise his force's intentions, he first anchored in Camaret Bay and issued orders for his ships to pass through the Raz de Sein. The Raz was a dangerous narrow channel littered with rocks and sandbanks and subject to heavy surf during bad weather, but would also <b>obscure</b> <b>the</b> size, strength and direction of the French fleet from the British squadron offshore, which French scouts claimed consisted of 30 ships.|$|E
5|$|Film noirs {{tend to have}} unusually {{convoluted}} story lines, frequently involving flashbacks {{and other}} editing techniques that disrupt and sometimes <b>obscure</b> <b>the</b> narrative sequence. Framing the entire primary narrative as a flashback is also a standard device. Voiceover narration, sometimes used as a structuring device, {{came to be seen}} as a noir hallmark; while classic noir is generally associated with first-person narration (i.e., by the protagonist), Stephen Neale notes that third-person narration is common among noirs of the semidocumentary style. Neo-noirs as varied as The Element of Crime (surrealist), After Dark, My Sweet (retro), and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (meta) have employed the flashback/voiceover combination.|$|E

5|$|Hoping to <b>obscure</b> <b>the</b> {{truth about}} Stanley's affair, Michael starts {{spreading}} {{a variety of}} false rumors, among them that there is another person physically inside Kevin (Brian Baumgartner), that Kelly is anorexic, that Toby (Paul Lieberstein) is still a virgin, that Pam (Jenna Fischer) is pregnant, and that Andy (Ed Helms) is gay. When Andy hears about this, he realizes that many people have thought this {{about him in the}} past and gets increasingly insecure as he begins to question his sexual orientation. Jim and Pam, who were trying to keep Pam's pregnancy a secret, think they have been found out. The couple then notice that there have been various absurd rumors about office employees being spread. When Jim brings it to everyone's attention, they trace one particular rumor back to Michael, who then tries to slip out of the office.|$|E
5|$|In {{the event}} that {{specially}} designed winter service vehicles are not available for plowing, other service or construction vehicles can be used instead: among those used by various authorities are graders, bulldozers, skid loaders, pickup trucks and rubbish trucks. Front-end loaders {{can also be used}} to plow snow. Either a snowplow attachment can be mounted on the loader's arm in place of the bucket, or the bucket or snowbasket can be used to load snow into the rear compartment of a snowplow or dump truck, which then hauls it away. Snowplows are dangerous to overtake; often, the oncoming lane may not be completely free of snow. In addition, the plow blade causes considerable spray of snow on both sides, which can <b>obscure</b> <b>the</b> vision of other road users.|$|E
5|$|Lactantius' De Mortibus Persecutorum, a {{political}} Christian pamphlet on the reigns of Diocletian and the Tetrarchy, provides valuable but tendentious detail on Constantine's predecessors and early life. The ecclesiastical histories of Socrates, Sozomen, and Theodoret describe the ecclesiastic disputes of Constantine's later reign. Written {{during the reign}} of Theodosius II (408–50AD), a century after Constantine's reign, these ecclesiastic historians <b>obscure</b> <b>the</b> events and theologies of the Constantinian period through misdirection, misrepresentation and deliberate obscurity. The contemporary writings of the orthodox Christian Athanasius and the ecclesiastical history of the Arian Philostorgius also survive, though their biases are no less firm.|$|E

5|$|When {{the weather}} was right, the force would cross the English Channel in {{darkness}} and attack shortly after midnight {{to coincide with the}} Zeebrugge Raid a few miles up the coast. By co-ordinating their operations, the assault forces would stretch the German defenders and hopefully gain the element of surprise. Covering the Inshore Squadron would be heavy bombardment from an offshore squadron of monitors and destroyers as well as artillery support from Royal Marine artillery near Ypres in Allied-held Flanders. Closer support would be offered by several flotillas of motor launches, small torpedo boats and Coastal Motor Boats which would lay smoke screens to <b>obscure</b> <b>the</b> advancing blockships as well as evacuate the crews of the cruisers after they had blocked the channel.|$|E
5|$|Diocletian {{was born}} near Salona in Dalmatia (Solin in modern Croatia), some time around 244. His parents {{gave him the}} Greek name Diocles, or {{possibly}} Diocles Valerius. The modern historian Timothy Barnes takes his official birthday, 22 December, as his actual birthdate. Other historians are not so certain. Diocles' parents were of low status, and writers critical of him claimed {{that his father was}} a scribe or a freedman of the senator Anullinus, or even that Diocles was a freedman himself. The first forty years of his life are mostly <b>obscure.</b> <b>The</b> Byzantine chronicler Joannes Zonaras states that he was Dux Moesiae, a commander of forces on the lower Danube. The often-unreliable Historia Augusta states that he served in Gaul, but this account is not corroborated by other sources and is ignored by modern historians of the period. The first time Diocletian's whereabouts are accurately established, in 282, he was made by the newly Emperor Carus commander of the Protectores domestici, the élite cavalry force directly attached to the Imperial household – a post that earned him the honor of a consulship in 283. As such, he took part in Carus' subsequent Persian campaign.|$|E
