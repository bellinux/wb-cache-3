25|$|In 1968, Callas told Lord Harewood, De Hildalgo had {{the real}} great {{training}}, {{maybe even the}} last real training of the real bel canto. As a young girl—thirteen years old—I was immediately thrown into her arms, meaning that I learned the secrets, the ways of this bel canto, which of course as you well know, is not just beautiful singing. It is a very hard training; it {{is a sort of}} a strait-jacket that you're supposed to put on, whether you like it <b>or</b> <b>not.</b> <b>You</b> have to learn to read, to write, to form your sentences, how far you can go, fall, hurt yourself, put yourself back on your feet continuously. De Hidalgo had one method, which was the real bel canto way, where no matter how heavy a voice, it should always be kept light, it should always be worked on in a flexible way, never to weigh it down. It is a method of keeping the voice light and flexible and pushing the instrument into a certain zone where it might not be too large in sound, but penetrating. And teaching the scales, trills, all the bel canto embellishments, which is a whole vast language of its own.|$|E

500|$|By 2008, Cuomo had reconsidered the album, saying: [...] "Pinkertons great. It's super-deep, brave, and authentic. Listening to it, I {{can tell}} that I was really going for it when I wrote and {{recorded}} {{a lot of those}} songs." [...] In 2010, Bell told The Aquarian Weekly: [...] "Pinkerton has definitely taken {{on a life of its}} own and became more successful and more accepted ... As an artist, you just have to do what you believe in at the time, whether it’s accepted <b>or</b> <b>not.</b> <b>You</b> just have to keep going with it." [...] In 2015, following the Pinkerton reissue and the [...] "Memories" [...] tour, in which Weezer performed Blue and Pinkerton in their entirety, Cuomo said:The experience of learning those songs again, singing them every night, working on them with the guys, and then being in a relatively small venue with 1,000 of the most hardcore Weezer fans and hearing them sing every syllable, seeing them air-drum all the fills—it was such an amazing experience and so different from what we'd been doing the years before that ... So it was a great feeling of validation from the fans, for this album that was so personal to me and had been such a source of pain for years.|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{wrote that}} {{watching}} it left him [...] "reeling with turmoil and confusion, {{with feelings of}} sadness and despair," [...] and called it a [...] "thoroughly painful and depressing experience - but, it must be said, {{one that has been}} powerfully written, directed and acted." [...] He awarded the film three and a half out of a possible four stars. Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote that this [...] "slick, riveting, viscerally scary film about what in other hands would be a decidedly unsalable subject, namely death," [...] is [...] "both quaint and devastating." [...] However, Desson Thomson of The Washington Post felt disappointed with the film that is [...] "ultimately flat on its surrealistic face, the victim of too many fake-art sequences." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly wrote that [...] "Jacob's Ladder is so 'dark' it sucks Robbins right down with it. By the time Jacob is being strapped to a bed and wheeled down a hospital corridor strewn with bloody limbs, it's hard to care whether the Orwellian image is a hallucination <b>or</b> <b>not.</b> <b>You</b> just want out." [...] Kim Newman called the film [...] "effectively the blunt remake" [...] of Carnival of Souls.|$|E
500|$|Azalea {{wrote the}} song with The Invisible Men, Trocon Markous Roberts and Natalie Sims. Sims stated that she, FKi, and Azalea had {{initially}} met back in 2008, but lost touch when Azalea moved to Los Angeles. The track specifically {{drew inspiration from}} a period when Azalea suffered from depression, and {{dropped out of high}} school to become a domestic worker with her mother. Azalea saved money for a flight ticket to Miami and left Mullumbimby, New South Wales before she turned 16—an event referenced in the song's lyric [...] "No money / No family / 16 in the middle of Miami" [...] which Azalea felt [...] "said it all". For this reason, she chose to write and record [...] "Work" [...] in isolation in Rockfield, Monmouthshire, with no phone reception, visitors or interruptions. She felt as a location it would help her recall the personal struggles she wanted to write about on the song. Azalea also believed that her best output was produced when in an environment outside her comfort zone. Her vocals were recorded at Rockfield Studios and Monnow Valley Studios. Sims, who abandoned four tour dates in order to fly over to Britain to join Azalea, commented on her own involvement in the song that [...] "Fresh out of a breakup and depressed I spent a month in London in a small 10×10 studio somedays writing and writing and writing… Regardless of whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>you</b> like the content the song told Iggy's true story of struggle sacrifice and hard work as an artist." ...|$|E

2500|$|The song is of a 1990s dance-pop {{style with}} a strong beat, {{featuring}} a lot of bass. It has a large range in dynamics, a style commonly used in many Rouvas songs. Lyrically, the song sees Rouvas asking his lover [...] "Do you want to <b>or</b> <b>not?</b> <b>You</b> will tell me tonight" [...] and asking if she has any room in her heart for him or if she just simply likes the chase. The pre-chorus states [...] "However, at this moment, bruised egos ask with a voice". He is asking that she decide because he has grown tired of her games and of worrying at nights.

2500|$|Brian and Patrick {{continued}} to combat homophobia in the NHL after Brendan's death; Patrick, along with Brian Kitts and Glenn Witman, founded You Can Play {{as a tribute}} to his brother. The name You Can Play originates from a piece Patrick Burke wrote for outsports.com. In the piece, Patrick talks about the overwhelmingly positive experience surrounding Brendan's coming out: [...] "I waited to get a negative email, or to read a damning article, or to hear a snide comment at a game. I waited, and I waited, and I waited…and I got what I should have expected the entire time: love, support, and admiration." [...] He talks of letters and emails that poured in to his family, and he also talks of fellow scouts and hockey personnel pulling him aside and giving their support. He summarizes his feelings in the revelation that across the hockey world, what matters is whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>you</b> can play. [...] "If you can play, we welcome you." [...] The quote was adapted to the catchier [...] "If you can play, you can play" [...] by the campaign.|$|E
2500|$|Andrew Rice of The New York Times commented: [...] "Kunle Afolayan {{wants to}} scare you, {{he wants to}} thrill you, {{he wants to make}} you laugh, but most of all, he would like you to suspend your disbelief — in his plots, yes, which tend to be over the top, but also about what is {{possible}} in Africa." [...] Shari Bollers of Afridiziak stated [...] "All the characters were created to enable the audience to warm up to them and to laugh with and at them. With its switching of dual languages of native and English, it was easy to follow. It was a film that included everyone and warmed us with the humour. Whether Nigerian <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>you</b> will find this film funny." [...] Caitlin Pearson of The Africa Channel stated: [...] "What makes the plot of Phone Swap engaging are the performances from its all-star cast, and a visual range in its cinematography that allows us to see more of Nigeria than any claustrophobic Nollywood film could ever hope to do. [...] Francis McKay of Flick Hunter gave a 3 out of 4 stars and concluded: [...] "Kunle Afolayan crafted a highly watchable film with a good story and a cast led by two talented actors. The film is a good representation of Nigeria...".|$|E
2500|$|GameSpot's Greg Mueller was {{extremely}} unimpressed, scoring the GameCube and PlayStation 2 versions 4.6 out of 10, and the Xbox version 4.3 out of 10. He accused {{the game of}} being [...] "so riddled with problems that {{it feels like it}} was rushed to make it to store shelves in time for the holidays." [...] He cited [...] "bugs that will make you randomly fall through the ground into a bunch of nothingness, bugs that make textures change when you {{get in and out of}} a car, bugs that cause you to inadvertently break a scripted sequence, thus making it impossible to complete a mission. There are also collision detection issues and edge detection problems that cause you to get stuck on the edge of a platform. That's not all--the game will actually freeze up entirely from time to time [...] There are also some pretty ugly clipping issues here too." [...] He concluded [...] "True Crime: New York City should be avoided regardless of whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>you</b> enjoyed the first True Crime. The gameplay has a few almost-decent spots, but the technical problems far outweigh any faint hope this game ever had of being enjoyable. If you're curious about what a video game looks like before it goes through adequate testing and quality assurance, then by all means give this one a try." [...] He scored the PC version 5.2 out of 10, writing, [...] "while it manages to address some of the more egregious glitches that appeared in the console versions of the game, it still doesn't feel like a finished product." ...|$|E

2500|$|However, Vertov's two credos, {{often used}} interchangeably, {{are in fact}} distinct, as Yuri Tsivian points out in the {{commentary}} track on the DVD for Man with the Movie Camera: for Vertov, [...] "life as it is" [...] means to record life {{as it would be}} without the camera present. [...] "Life caught unawares" [...] means to record life when surprised, and perhaps provoked, by the presence of a camera. This explanation contradicts the common assumption that for Vertov [...] "life caught unawares" [...] meant [...] "life caught unaware of the camera." [...] All of these shots might conform to Vertov's credo [...] "caught unawares." [...] His slow motion, fast motion, and other camera techniques were a way to dissect the image, Mikhail Kaufman stated in an interview. It was to be the honest truth of perception. For example, in Man with a Movie Camera, two trains are shown almost melting into each other, although we are taught to see trains as not riding that close, Vertov tried to portray the actual sight of two passing trains. Mikhail spoke about Eisenstein's films as being different from his and his brother's in that Eisenstein, [...] "came from the theatre, in the theatre one directs dramas, one strings beads." [...] "We all felt...that through documentary film we could develop a new kind of art. Not only documentary art, or the art of chronicle, but rather an art based on images, the creation of an image-oriented journalism" [...] Mikhail explained. More than even film truth, Man with a Movie Camera, {{was supposed to be a}} way to make those in the Soviet Union more efficient in their actions. He slowed down his actions, such as the decision whether to jump <b>or</b> <b>not,</b> <b>you</b> can see the decision in his face, a psychological dissection for the audience. He wanted a peace between the actions of man and the actions of a machine, for them to be, in a sense, one.|$|E
