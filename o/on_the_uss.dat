5|$|At {{approximately}} 10:50, 107mm rocket fire began impacting in {{the vicinity}} of LZ Hotel. Less than 10 minutes later, the LZ also received 82mm mortar fire. As soon as the Khmer Rouge fire commenced, the controllers in the zone notified the Air Force forward air controllers (FACs) flying overhead in 23d Tactical Air Support Squadron OV-10s. The FACs immediately made low passes over the east bank of the Mekong, but could not spot any fire coming from known enemy positions in that location. At 10:59, the last element of 2nd Battalion 4th Marines left the zone and the last marine helicopter landed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>USS</b> Okinawa at 12:15.|$|E

5|$|CNN cited {{a senior}} U.S. {{official}} as saying {{three sets of}} photographs of bin Laden's body exist: Photos taken at an aircraft hangar in Afghanistan, described as the most recognizable and gruesome; photos taken from the burial at sea <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>USS</b> Carl Vinson before a shroud was placed around his body; and photos from the raid itself, which include shots of {{the interior of the}} compound as well as three of the others who died in the raid.|$|E
5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 11 April 1975, the 31st MAU received orders to execute Operation Eagle Pull. At 06:00 on 12 April, 12 CH-53s of HMH-462 launched from the deck of USS Okinawa and then at 10-minute intervals descended again {{to pick up their}} marines. Elements of Companies F and H, and the command group embarked from the USS Okinawa while elements of Company G boarded their helicopters <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>USS</b> Vancouver, giving a total ground security force of 360 Marines. As the helicopters completed loading they formed into groups of three orbiting the task force.|$|E
5|$|At 11:00 the {{security}} situation at the Air America compound was deteriorating as General Carey {{did not wish to}} risk his Marines by extending his perimeter to cover the Air America compound (LZ 40), so all Air America helicopters from this time operated out of the tennis courts in the DAO Annex (LZ 35). This move created fuel problems for Air America as they no longer had access to the fuel supplies in their compound and at least initially they were refused fuel by the ships of TF76. According to US Naval Archives, at 12:30 an Air America Bell 205 landed Air Vice Marshal Nguyễn Cao Kỳ, Madame Kỳ, Dorothy Martin (wife of Ambassador Martin) and others <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>USS</b> Denver; contemporary reports state and photos show that Marshal Kỳ piloted his own UH-1H Huey to the USS Midway.|$|E

5|$|At 2:42 PM on April 11, 1945, off {{the coast}} of Kikaijima Island, a Japanese fighter pilot in an A6M5c Zero {{launched}} a kamikaze attack <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>USS</b> Missouri. Bill Obitz, a Seaman at the time, recalled that the attacking plane approached at an extreme angle and estimated that it was 20 feet (6 m) above the water. Although struck by intense antiaircraft fire, the plane survived and struck the ship's starboard side at frame 169 below the main deck. While the impact of one of the plane's wings started a fire at 5-inch mount number 3, its 500-pound bomb did not detonate, so the damage was minimal. There were no American casualties, but the Japanese pilot died. Parts of the plane's wreckage and {{the top half of the}} pilot's body landed on board the Missouri. The plane's wing was turned over to the crew to be cut up for souvenirs.|$|E
5|$|Cabaniss {{was born}} on October 14, 1859 in Petersburg, Virginia. He grew up in Central Virginia until he was {{appointed}} to the United States Naval Academy at the age of sixteen years and eight months. He began classes at the academy on June 21, 1876 and was the only member of his class from Virginia. Cabaniss was an average student while at the Naval Academy; he finished 40th in his class of 69 in his second year, earning near-top marks in drawing and mathematics but very low marks in history and French language. He also spent the mandatory two months and eighteen days at sea. Cabaniss had the fewest demerits of any member of his sophomore class and earned a spot on the academy's summer cruise <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>USS</b> Constellation.|$|E
5|$|From 1999–2002, 3rd Battalion {{conducted}} operations Crocodile '99 and Tandem Thrust '01 in Queensland and Townsend, Australia, Operation Tafakula in Tonga, {{and then}} conducted UDPs to Okinawa in 2000 and 2002. In 2002 the battalion participated in Operation Millenium Edge on Tinian and Guam, then Balikatan 02-2 in the Philippines, Borneo, Brunei, Korea, Australia, and Japan. In 2003 3rd Battalion became BLT 3/3 on the 31st MEU {{for the second}} half of the year. Based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>USS</b> Essex, USS Fort McHenry, and USS Harpers Ferry, BLT 3/3 participated in ARGEX-03 in the Philippines, provided security for President George W. Bush on Bali, Indonesia, and also visited Japan, Australia, East Timor, and Hong Kong. In May and June 2004 Lima Company participated in Operation Cobra Gold II at Khorat, Thailand and other parts of the battalion participated in Operation Northern Edge JTF-510 in Alaska.

50|$|On May 23, 1886, Minett was {{promoted}} to Lieutenant, junior grade. Shortly after, he was transferred to <b>the</b> receiving ship <b>USS</b> Minnesota where he served until 1888. After that, he was briefly assigned to <b>the</b> <b>USS</b> Pensacola before a longer stint <b>on</b> board <b>the</b> <b>USS</b> Omaha, sailing to Japan. While in Japan, the Omaha assisted in putting out a large fire at Hodogaya-ku, Yokohama. On {{his return to the}} United States, Minett served <b>on</b> board <b>the</b> <b>USS</b> Vermont in New York Harbor. He {{was promoted}} to lieutenant on December 11, 1891 and sailed with <b>the</b> <b>USS</b> Marblehead for several years around Europe before returning to the United States in 1897.

5|$|In Cuba, sailors <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>USS</b> America (CV-66) {{spent about}} 1,700hours to assist Guantánamo Bay in recovery. The sole {{survivor}} of the sinking boat carrying Cuban exiles was tried in a military tribunal. The man was {{held responsible for the}} 44boat deaths and was quickly executed. The United States Coast Guard deployed boats, helicopters, and airplanes to find victims of the boat capsized in the Straits of Florida. In the United States, the price for lettuce and tomatoes rose due to Inez's crop damage in Florida and reduced crop output in California. The country's military sent helicopters and planes to join the Mexican Air Force, as well as trucks by land, to deliver tons of supplies, including food, clothing, and medicine to flood-affected areas in Tamaulipas. In the weeks after the storm, many residents had minimal food access, and some areas remained flooded. Conditions in Tampico, located near where the storm moved ashore, gradually returned to normal. Heavy rainfall in Mexico restored reservoirs, which assisted future crop growing.|$|E
5|$|In January 1953, {{the unit}} {{deployed}} to the Marine Corps Air Station Kaneohe Bay on Oahu {{for six months}} of training, after which 3rd Battalion, 3rd Marines returned to Pendleton. In August 1953, 3rd Battalion deployed to Japan for training operations at Kin Beach, Okinawa and Iwo Jima. In October 1956, 3rd Battalion was stationed in Japan when the Suez Crisis broke out. Though initially deployed to the Indian Ocean for possible action in Egypt and the surrounding region, the crisis was ultimately resolved. During this cruise, 3rd Battalion—designated Battalion Landing Team (BLT) 3/3 – visited Brunei Bay, Bombay, Karachi, and Singapore, before returning to Japan. In December 1956, the entire 3rd Marine Regiment was deployed off of Indonesia because of civil strife in that country. In 1958, 3rd Battalion was alerted for possible deployment to Lebanon, but its transports were turned back in the Indian Ocean to Okinawa. Four years later, in 1962, the battalion deployed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>USS</b> Bayfield to the Chinese coast to guard the Taiwanese islands of Quemoy Matsu.|$|E
5|$|In {{their book}} The Fantastic 1804 Dollar, numismatic historians Eric P. Newman and Kenneth E. Bressett assert {{that a problem}} arose at the Mint {{as to how to}} {{interpret}} Forsyth's order. As his initial correspondence indicated that the sets were to include coins of every type then in use, Mint officials included both the silver dollar and gold eagle. The moratorium on silver dollar coinage had been lifted in 1831, but none had been coined since those issued in March 1804. Two sets of coins, minted in proof finish, were completed and delivered along with their boxes to Roberts shortly prior to his departure <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>USS</b> Peacock on April 27, 1835. The dollars included the sets bore the Draped Bust design, depicting an allegorical representation of Liberty on the obverse and a heraldic eagle on the reverse. A list of diplomatic gifts was also proposed for missions to Japan and Cochin-China (today part of Vietnam), which included two additional sets of coins.|$|E
