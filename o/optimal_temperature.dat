5|$|Bulbs are {{harvested}} for {{market in the}} summer, sorted, stored for 2 – 3 weeks, and then further disinfected by a hot (43.5°C) bath. This eliminates infestations by narcissus fly and nematodes. The bulbs are then dried at a high temperature, and then stored at 15.5°C. The initiation of new flower development in the bulb takes place in late spring before the bulbs are lifted, and is completed by mid summer while the bulbs are in storage. The <b>optimal</b> <b>temperature</b> for initiation is 20°C followed by cooling to 13°C.|$|E
5|$|Like all catalysts, enzymes {{increase}} the reaction rate by lowering its activation energy. Some enzymes {{can make their}} conversion of substrate to product occur many millions of times faster. An extreme example is orotidine 5'-phosphate decarboxylase, which allows a reaction that would otherwise take millions of years to occur in milliseconds. Chemically, enzymes are like any catalyst and are not consumed in chemical reactions, nor do they alter the equilibrium of a reaction. Enzymes differ from most other catalysts by being much more specific. Enzyme activity can be affected by other molecules: inhibitors are molecules that decrease enzyme activity, and activators are molecules that increase activity. Many therapeutic drugs and poisons are enzyme inhibitors. An enzyme's activity decreases markedly outside its <b>optimal</b> <b>temperature</b> and pH.|$|E
5|$|Larvae of Sirex {{woodwasp}} develop through arrhenotoky: male larvae develop {{only from}} unfertilized eggs, the females only from fertilized ones. Usually, 10 males are produced per female, but the ratio varies between 20:1 and 1:1. The larvae hatch after eight {{days at the}} earliest, but in some exterior conditions, they may remain in the egg for several months. At the <b>optimal</b> <b>temperature</b> of around 25°C (77°F), they hatch out after 10 to 12 days. Although the larvae hatch at 30°C (86°F) {{two to three days}} earlier, they are 20% more likely to die. Such extreme temperatures result in slower development, and below 6.2°C (43°F), the larvae die. A sufficient interspersion of the wood with the mycelium of the woodwasp is crucial for its hatching, as the fungus prevents the wood from drying out. Without these prerequisites, hatching is not possible. The tree can only ward off the infestation if it floods the boreholes with resin or halts the fungus by producing a wall of polyphenols.|$|E

The sparse algal mat was exposed to high temperatures only during the brief, highly periodic eruptions of the geyser. <b>Optimal</b> <b>temperatures</b> for the algae were higher than the mean environmental temperatures; as a consequence the algae experienced <b>temperatures</b> <b>optimal</b> for photosynthesis and growth only during {{a small fraction of}} the time. A heat-treatment experiment indicated that the algae of this mat were resistant to the high temperatures that occurred during eruption, whereas organisms having the same <b>optimal</b> <b>temperatures</b> but inhabiting a thermally constant environment were more heat sensitive.

25|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} in {{the characteristics of the}} nests within the Vespula vulgaris species. Aerial nests and nests that are very close {{to the surface of the}} ground have much thicker envelopes than those under the ground. Because heat is less well insulated above the ground, the wasps build thick envelopes to prevent heat from escaping. Also, smaller nests have thicker envelopes than larger nests. This is mainly due to the fact that the amount of heat produced is proportional to the volume of the nest. The larger a nest is the better it will be in conserving the nest warmth. The <b>optimal</b> <b>temperature</b> of the nest is around 32°C. However, when the temperature rises above the <b>optimal</b> <b>temperature</b> (during hot days), the workers use their wings as fans to cool the nest down.|$|E
25|$|The egg {{to first}} instar cycle of L. mexicana can take from 7–14 hours of incubation. As with all insects, {{developmental}} rates depend on temperature and degree days. Egg hatching {{does not occur}} at temperatures below 75°F. At 75°F, it takes the eggs 14.03 hours to hatch. Hatching also ceases when temperatures are higher than 99°F, and at 99°F it takes the eggs 8.12 hours to hatch. It has been discovered that the <b>optimal</b> <b>temperature</b> is 94°F taking 7.77 hours.|$|E

25|$|The {{other main}} {{environmental}} factors affecting cellulose production are pH, temperature, and dissolved oxygen. According to experimental studies, the <b>optimal</b> <b>temperature</b> for maximum production was between 28 and 30°C. For most species, the optimal pH was between 4.0-6.0. Controlling pH {{is especially important}} in static cultures as the accumulation of gluconic, acetic, or lactic acid decreases the pH far lower than the optimal range. Dissolved oxygen content can be varied with stirrer speed as it is needed for static cultures where substrates need to be transported by diffusion.|$|E
25|$|Conventional FT {{reactors}} {{have been}} optimized for massive coal-to-liquids and gas–liquid facilities such as Shell's Pearl GTL facility. These slurry bed and fixed-bed reactors are {{much larger than}} the sizes needed for biofuel facilities or for smaller-scale natural-gas fields. The use of microchannel reactors, such as those developed by Velocys, intensifies the reaction, scales down the size of the reaction hardware and overcomes the heat and mass transport problems associated with conventional FT technology. Enhanced heat transfer inside the microchannels reactor allows for <b>optimal</b> <b>temperature</b> control, which maximizes catalyst activity and life. While no smaller scale plant is currently in commercial operation, indications show capital costs, operating costs and size could all be reduced relative to conventional FT facilities.|$|E
25|$|Neonatal sidewinders {{engage in}} a {{remarkable}} behavioral homeothermy {{that has not been}} observed in any other type of snake. Following birth, the neonates mass together in their natal burrow. Most often, gravid females select an east-facing, small-diameter rodent burrow for giving birth. For the first week or so of their lives, neonatal sidewinders literally plug the entrance to this burrow during daylight hours, forming a dynamic multiple-individual mass that takes advantage of the hot exterior environment and the cool interior of the burrow to maintain an average aggregate temperature of 32°C (the <b>optimal</b> <b>temperature</b> for shedding). The dynamic mass of neonates modifies the thermal environment at the burrow entrance such that the young can occupy a location that would ordinarily become lethally hot for an individual neonate (or even an adult). Because of the constant movements of the neonates, the aggregate assumes stable temperature properties reminiscent of a homeothermic organism (i.e., maintains tight temperature tolerance ± 2°C).|$|E

The Hong Kong price for a kilogram of dried mushrooms reached around US$770 in 1982, but had dropped to US$100–200 by 1988. Additional advances led to it dropping further to US$10–20 by 2000.

40|$|<b>Optimal</b> {{sterilization}} <b>temperature</b> {{was defined}} as the temperature resulting in a minimum surface cook-value product together with the desired degree of sterility. Sterilization of conduction heated foods, with simple shapes as infinite slab, infinite cylinder and sphere, was modelled.

2500|$|There is {{scientific}} {{support for the}} concept of a temperature set point - that is, maintenance of an <b>optimal</b> <b>temperature</b> for the metabolic processes that life depends on. [...] Nervous activity in the preoptic-anterior hypothalamus of the brain triggers heat losing (sweating, etc.) or heat generating (shivering and muscle contraction, etc.) activities through stimulation of the autonomic nervous system. The pre-optic anterior hypothalamus has been shown to contain warm sensitive, cool sensitive, and temperature insensitive neurons, to determine the body's temperature setpoint.

2500|$|Extension/elongation: The {{temperature}} at this step {{depends on the}} DNA polymerase used; the optimum activity temperature for Taq polymerase is approximately , though a temperature of [...] is commonly used with this enzyme. In this step, the DNA polymerase synthesizes a new DNA strand complementary to the DNA template strand by adding free dNTPs from the reaction mixture that are complementary to the template in the 5'-to-3' direction, condensing the 5'-phosphate group of the dNTPs with the 3'-hydroxy group {{at the end of}} the nascent (elongating) DNA strand. The precise time required for elongation depends both on the DNA polymerase used and on the length of the DNA target region to amplify. As a rule of thumb, at their <b>optimal</b> <b>temperature,</b> most DNA polymerases polymerize a thousand bases per minute. Under optimal conditions (i.e., if there are no limitations due to limiting substrates or reagents), at each extension/elongation step, the number of DNA target sequences is doubled.
