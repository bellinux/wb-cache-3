40|$|Abstract — Efficient {{location}} of fruits {{in the trees}} {{is the most important}} criterion of an automatic robotic harvesting system. The main challenges faced {{in the development of the}} robotic harvesting arm are accurate identification of the fruits in dense foliages and detection of the occluded fruits. This paper proposes a statistical technique that accurately detects and tracks pomegranates in trees. A k-means clustering methodology is implemented as a preprocessor step followed by image analysis algorithms that finally locate the fruit accurately under varying conditions of illumination, human intervention, camera view etc. The simplicity of the technique is attributed to its real-time capability to detect and track fruits in a video <b>of</b> <b>fruit-bearing</b> trees. The ground truth data were computed on 25 video sequences and the system was tested on another 25 videos. The detection efficiency is as high as 96. 3 %.

50|$|Conditions {{were not}} favourable: {{aside from the}} land degradation, the soil itself was not {{promising}} - predominantly clay, with hard plinthite clods. Not far beneath the surface there were coal seams that in the dry periods opened up to the air and caught fire. In addition there were concerns whether the area would be sufficient for the population of 1000 orangutans that was deemed to be viable over 500 years {{in the absence of}} logging or hunting. Land prices were rising and {{it would be impossible to}} buy enough land to support such a population in normal rainforest. The possibility of increasing the number of orangutans per hectare by increasing the density <b>of</b> <b>fruit-bearing</b> trees above the normal figure, in particular the density of wild fig trees. Despite this, forestry experts were sceptical: they believed that once the rainforest was cut and burned down, it would never return.|$|R
40|$|Girdling and {{defoliation}} <b>of</b> <b>fruit-bearing</b> grapefruit (Citrus paradisi Macf.) branches inhibited {{the accumulation}} of soluble carbohydrates and proline in fruit tissues during low temperature treatment of trees. These treatments did not inhibit hydrolysis of sucrose to reducing sugars. Flavedo and albedo tissues responded similarly to low temperatures but little or no change occurred in the juice. Therefore, soluble carbohydrates and proline {{do not appear to}} interchange between different tissues of the fruit at low temperatures but instead are translocated into the fruit {{from other parts of the}} plant. Girdling fruit-bearing branches immediately after low temperature treatments inhibited {{the accumulation of}} sucrose in fruit tissues at dehardening temperatures. Also, proline levels decreased rapidly in fruit on girdled branches at dehardening temperatures. This rapid decrease suggests proline may serve as a source for respiratory energy in grapefruit during rapidly changing temperatures that favor active growth and during recovery of citrus from environmental stress...|$|R

Flowering level {{was used as an}} estimate of reproductive success as sampling was done prior to fruit development. Terminalia cunninghamii was found to flower earlier and more prolifically in areas burnt in the early dry season of 1999 than in areas left unburnt; however, {{there was no significant difference}} between these treatments in 2000. Flowering levels were significantly reduced in burnt treatments (from early to mid-dry season fires) for Buchanania obovata (large-leafed form), Persoonia falcata, Planchonia careya, Syzygium eucalyptoides and Syzygium suborbiculare. Positive correlations occurred between the minimum foliage height and total tree height of Buchanania obovata small-leafed form (r = 0. 78, y = 0. 61 x + 0. 003), large-leafed form (r = 0. 87, y = 0. 59 x + 0. 10) and Syzygium suborbiculare (r = 0. 76, y = 0. 43 x + 0. 54). Above a height of 2 m, most trees have the majority of their foliage located in the top half of the tree. In all cases, flowering levels increased with foliage height intervals. The results indicate that fire events and their timing can have an impact on the reproductive cycle of fruit-tree species. Indigenous people have managed these resources through the careful use of fire. The conservation of fruit-tree species and frugivorous-animal species could benefit from (i) the careful management of areas with high densities <b>of</b> <b>fruit-bearing</b> species, and (ii) spatially and temporally diverse fire regimes across broader landscape units...|$|R
