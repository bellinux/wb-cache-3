40|$|This paper {{provides}} international {{evidence for}} <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>week</b> effects in stock market returns denominated in both local currencies and the US dollars in most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nineteen {{countries in the}} sample for the period July 1993 to July 1998. The observed daily patterns differ for local and dollar returns, the latter being exhibiting lower daily means and higher standard deviations. In local currency terms, a pattern of higher returns around <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>week,</b> Tuesday <b>and</b> then Wednesday; and a lower pattern towards <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>week,</b> Thursday <b>and</b> then Friday, are observed. In dollar terms, a higher pattern occurs around <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>week,</b> Wednesday <b>and</b> then Tuesday; and a lower one is observed towards <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>week,</b> Thursday <b>and</b> then Friday. The lower patterns are more apparent in both cases. Volatility is the highest on Mondays in both local and dollar returns. Local returns have the lowest volatility towards <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>week,</b> Thursday <b>and</b> Friday, whereas <b>the</b> lowest volatility <b>of</b> dollar returns are observed on Tuesdays. The results have useful implications for international portfolio diversification. Day <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Week</b> Effects, Volatility, International Stock Markets...|$|R
