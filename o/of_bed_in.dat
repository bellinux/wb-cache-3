5|$|Coming in at 7/173, Meckiff top-scored with 55—his only {{first-class}} 50—as Victoria batted {{first and}} made a late recovery to end with 244. Meckiff took 3/65, including the wickets of Test players Bill Watson and Richie Benaud as New South Wales responded with 281. In the Victorian second innings Meckiff managed only 8 as Victoria left their opponents a target of 161 runs for victory. The paceman took 4/56 and claimed the final wicket, removing Test opener Jim Burke caught for 8 as New South Wales mustered 160, causing the match to end in the first tie in Shield history. Burke had returned to bat after being injured earlier in the innings, while New South Wales captain Ian Craig, who had been ill, hauled himself out <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> <b>in</b> an attempt to salvage the match after his team had fallen to 7/70. Meckiff's other victims in the final innings included Test players Alan Davidson and Johnny Martin.|$|E

Shakira then enters a closet, which leads to the inside of a {{glittering}} ruby-red cave, where she begins dancing wearing a black asymmetric bodysuit. The next scene depicts Shakira striking different poses inside a golden cage (with the sign [...] "Do Not Feed the Animal" [...] on top), clad in a skin-toned leotard. Shakira explained the usage of the golden cage in the video, saying that [...] "I just wanted to express what it feels like for a she-wolf to be in captivity. To be in a golden cage. I think I've been in a golden cage most of my life. And now not anymore". The setting changes and Shakira is seen performing a dance routine in a club with many back-up dancers. A wolf is also shown walking in the club and transforming into a woman. Near {{to the end of the}} video, Shakira dances on a rooftop with a backdrop resembling San Francisco. As the song ends, she falls backwards from the roof and lands in her closet. The video ends with Shakira lying back in her bed and smiling as thunder cracks.|$|E

2500|$|The sleeper serves {{mainly to}} keep the wearer warm at night, {{even in the absence}} of {{blankets}} and bed covers. [...] The sleeper covers the entire body except for the head (except in certain cases where a hood is present) and (in most cases) hands (except in cases where a sleeper has attached mitts, mostly on infant sizes), where it is snug at the neck and wrists. [...] The use of a zipper closure in place of buttons or snap fasteners also further retains warmth by eliminating drafts. [...] This is especially important for infants, for whom loose blankets may pose a safety hazard (including increasing the risk of SIDS), and possibly for older children, who may still be too young to be relied upon {{to keep the}}ir own sleepwear or bed covers adjusted so as to prevent exposure to the air of bare skin. [...] This is reflected in advertisements by blanket sleeper manufacturers, which often emphasize that their garments [...] "can't be kicked off", or that [...] "no other covers are needed". The permanently attached feet can also be a beneficial feature for children who are prone to get out <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> <b>in</b> the morning before their parents are awake, and are too young to be relied upon to put on slippers or other footwear to keep their feet warm, as well as for adults who find putting on, and/or wearing socks in bed too bothersome, yet still want their feet covered when getting out <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> <b>in</b> the morning. [...] Blanket sleepers without feet allow more room for growth and reduce the possibility of slipping. [...] Also, children with larger or smaller feet find a better fit.|$|E

2500|$|Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV) – The {{most common}} cause of vertigo. [...] It is {{typically}} described as a brief, intense sensation of spinning that occurs when there are changes in the position of the head with respect to gravity. An individual may experience BPPV when rolling over to the left or right, upon getting out <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> <b>in</b> the morning, or when looking up for an object on a high shelf. The cause of BPPV is the presence of normal but misplaced calcium crystals called otoconia, which are normally found in the utricle and saccule (the otolith organs) and are used to sense movement. If they fall from the utricle and become loose in the semicircular canals, they can distort the sense of movement and cause a mismatch between actual head movement and the information sent to the brain by the inner ear, causing a spinning sensation.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{recording}} did {{not begin}} until April 2010. Friend and Pretty. Odd. producer Rob Mathes was [...] "like family" [...] to Smith and Urie, inspiring them to be excited to record despite the duo's initial beginning. He encouraged them to love the work they do, and [...] "... Just get out <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> <b>in</b> the morning, don’t loathe {{the things that you}} actually love doing, because it’s just going to keep you down," [...] for which Urie recalled the band [...] "owed a lot" [...] for. After working with the demos produced during the summer with Feldmann for several months afterward, the duo decided they weren't satisfactory, so the band started over with new material. The biggest difference for the band was that it was now half the previous band, with Urie and Smith writing everything. The album was produced by Feldmann and Butch Walker. Urie recalled that they were initially nervous to experiment with new producers, but instead regarded Feldmann and Walker's input positively, regarding their help as [...] "Hey, this is your record, I want to help you with your ideas. So you bring me the ideas, and we’ll help you do that. I don’t want to write anything for you, this is your record, it has to be your voice." [...] The band continued working with Feldmann for four months in early 2010, later going to Walker to finalize and improve the songs.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The ageing {{population}} in Europe is putting an ever increasing demand on the long-term care (LTC) {{services provided by}} these countries. This study analyses {{the relationship between the}} LTC institutional supply <b>of</b> <b>beds</b> and potential care needs, taking into account the social and health context, the supply of complementary and alternative services, along with informal care. Methods An observational, cross-sectional, ecological study was carried out. Statistical data were obtained from the Italian National Institute of Statistics and Ministry of Health. Indicators, regarding 5 areas (Supply <b>of</b> <b>beds</b> <b>in</b> long term care institutions, Potential care needs, Social and health context, Complementary and alternative services for the elderly, Informal care), were calculated at Local Health Unit (LHU) level and referred to 2004. Two indicators were specifically used to measure supply <b>of</b> <b>beds</b> <b>in</b> long term care institutions and potential care needs for the elderly. Their values were grouped in tertiles. LHU were classified according to the combination of tertiles in three groups: A. High level <b>of</b> supply <b>of</b> <b>beds</b> <b>in</b> long term care institutions associated with low level of potential care needs; B. Low level <b>of</b> supply <b>of</b> <b>beds</b> <b>in</b> long term care institutions associated with high level of potential care needs; C. Balanced level <b>of</b> supply <b>of</b> <b>beds</b> <b>in</b> long term care institutions with potential care needs. For each group the indicators of 5 areas were analysed. The Index Number (IN) was calculated for each of these indicators. Results Specific factors that need to be carefully considered were highlighted {{in each of the three}} defined groups. The highest level of alternative services such as long-stay hospital discharges in residence region (IN = 125), home care recipients (HCR) (IN = 123. 8) were reported for Group A. This group included North regions. The highest level of inappropriate hospital discharges in (IN = 124. 1) and out (IN = 155. 8) the residence region, the highest value of families who received help (IN = 106. 4) and the lowest level of HCR (IN = 68. 7) were found in Group B. South regions belong to this group. The highest level of families paying a caregiver (IN = 115. 8) was shown in Group C. Central regions are included in third group. Conclusion Supply <b>of</b> <b>beds</b> <b>in</b> long term care institutions substantially differs across Italian regions, showing in every scenario some imbalances between potential care needs and other studied factors. Our study suggests the need of a comprehensive rethinking of care delivery "system". </p...|$|R

40|$|About {{one-third of}} the general {{practices}} in the Oxfordshire Health District have access to <b>beds</b> <b>in</b> community hospitals as well as district general hospitals. Hospital Activity Analysis data were {{used to calculate the}} average number <b>of</b> hospital <b>beds</b> occupied daily by patients registered with each general practice in the district. Practices with and without access to community hospitals were compared to determine whether such access was associated with a reduction <b>in</b> the use <b>of</b> <b>beds</b> <b>in</b> general medical, geriatric, and other specialties, and an increase in overall utilisation rates. The rate of use of general medical and geriatric <b>beds</b> <b>in</b> district general hospitals by practice populations with access to community hospitals was about half that of populations without such access. Utilisation rates overall, combining the use <b>of</b> <b>beds</b> <b>in</b> both district general hospitals and community hospitals, were a little higher in populations with access to both community hospitals and district general hospitals than in those with access to district general hospitals only...|$|R
