The {{purpose of this study}} is to examine the role of TQM elements of Leadership, Employee Involvement, Customer Focus, Strategic Planning, Supplier Relations, Process Management and Information Analysis on the <b>organisational</b> performance <b>measures</b> of Quality Improvement, Product / Service Quality, Customer Satisfaction, Employee Satisfaction and Supplier Performance, and how this essentially leads to successful Organisational Performance. Interviews were conducted with senior management on their awareness and importance of TQM on organisational performance. Thereafter, a questionnaire was administered to a simple random sample of 33 manufacturing and 32 service organisations in the Johannesburg South region. Confirmatory factor analysis and Cronbach’s Alpha Coefficient was utilised to verify the validity and reliability of the measuring instrument, respectively. Regression and correlation analysis was developed to test the relationship between the TQM elements on the five <b>organisational</b> performance <b>measures.</b> A t-test was conducted the difference between manufacturing and service organisations, in their implementation of TQM. The findings of this study indicates that the seven TQM elements have a positive influence on the five <b>organisational</b> performance <b>measures.</b> Therefore it can be accepted that TQM plays an important role in the performance and success of an organisation. The results of this study could provide valuable information for manufacturing and service organisations on improving quality and enhancing organisational performance. D. Phil.

This {{has resulted in a}} need for up-to-date research and information on the subject, leading to the development of various measurement instruments. The main {{purpose of this study was}} to validate the <b>Organisational</b> Climate <b>Measure</b> (OCM) for the South African context. The OCM is designed to serve as a global multi-dimensional <b>measure</b> of <b>organisational</b> climate and is based on the competing values model developed by Quinn and Rohrbaugh. In this study a comprehensive literature review was conducted prior to the OCM’s administration to a sample of 200 individuals currently employed in a South African organisation. The reliability and validity of the OCM was evaluated by means of Cronbach’s alpha coefficient and confirmatory factor analysis. The results indicated strong correlations between factors and a good model fit.

40|$|Traditionally, {{in process}} industry, risks are reduced with {{technical}} solutions and <b>organisational</b> <b>measures.</b> The performance of {{both types of}} "solutions" depends on many factors and can not easily be compared. Especially the effectiveness of <b>organisational</b> <b>measures</b> {{such as the use}} of procedures, education, training and improving the safety culture are hard to quantify. Nevertheless, in an integral approach towards safety, there is a strong need to compare both types of measures to choose the best solution for a given situation. This paper describes the method used by TNO to combine organisational and technical aspects in one semi-quantitative safety analysis. This analysis is based on Layer of Protection Analysis (LOPA) and is used to calculate the probability of accident scenarios based on the technical safety. In most cases the event or failure frequencies in the LOPA are affected by organisational aspects. The results of a survey of the safety culture, Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) structure and the latent failures within the organisation provide the information to incorporate the organisational aspects in the LOPA. The LOPA results in scenario frequencies which can be compared to predefined risk tolerance criteria. If the criteria are not met, several additional (intended) measures can be added in the LOPA to find the most effective way to reach these criteria. By calculating the costs and amount of risk reduction per measure, the costs and benefits of technical and <b>organisational</b> <b>measures</b> can easily be compared...|$|E

The {{aim of this}} paper is to demonstrate the potential of <b>organisational</b> <b>measures</b> for energy saving and their cost effectiveness.

About 13 % of these measures are classified as organisational and the correlation between <b>organisational</b> <b>measures,</b> sectors and company sizes are provided and discussed in this paper. Examples include the implementation of an energy management system, automatic and non-automatic switch off of unused equipment and machines, procurement guidelines and staff training on efficient energy use.

40|$|<b>Measuring</b> <b>organisational</b> {{justice in}} a South African context {{is a concern}} as the concept is multi-dimensional {{and there is no}} {{comprehensive}} definition; therefore, an integrative and well-developed <b>measure</b> of <b>organisational</b> justice can advance the measurement and analysis of this concept. This study investigates the development and validity of an <b>organisational</b> justice <b>measuring</b> instrument (OJMI), and determines the relationships between the different dimensions of the concept organisational justice. Data was gathered from 289 participants, employed in a public service organisation. To analyse the data the descriptive and inferential statistics used are Cronbach alpha coefficient, means, the explanatory factor analysis (EFA) and the confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). It was found that the model fitted the data well and the measurement of each dimension, namely strategic direction; distributive, procedural, interactional, informational, diversity management; customer relations; service delivery innovation as well as ethical leadership and management justice were confirmed to be statistically significant and positive. These results indicate that OJMI is a reliable and valid measure that organisations need in order to measure perceptions of fairness, and to monitor trends of fair practices. The validated <b>measuring</b> instrument for <b>organisational</b> justice and the conducted analysis of the interrelationships between the different dimensions of the concept will enable organisations to initiate proactive and reactive interventions to facilitate justice and fair practices.

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{organisational}} health originates from fields {{as diverse as}} psychology, management, education and occupational health and stems back to the 1950 s with the publication ‘The Organisation: What makes it healthy?’. One definition states, ‘organisational health blends the pursuit of individual wellness with organisational effectiveness (that can be optimised with contemporary business improvement initiatives such as Lean and Six Sigma) to yield a strategy for economic resilience’. In fields outside of healthcare e. g. business and education, correlations have been shown between organisational health and <b>organisational</b> performance (outcome <b>measures),</b> but is the same true in healthcare? At a time of financial difficulty within the NHS, and also {{with the need for}} improving patient outcomes, in wake of The Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust Public Inquiry for example, organisational health could become increasingly important in our hospitals. The methodologies used include systematic review, qualitative interview analysis, questionnaire development, and exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses (EFA & CFA) for questionnaire validation and data collection. This thesis begins with a systematic review of the organisational health literature followed by a qualitative interview study to establish the elements of organisational health for acute NHS Trusts in England. It then describes how, from this data, a pilot questionnaire was developed to <b>measure</b> <b>organisational</b> health and then exploratory factor analysis followed by confirmatory factor analysis techniques were used to create a reliable validated organisational health questionnaire containing 112 -items across 8 sections.
