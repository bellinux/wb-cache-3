5|$|He later {{spoke on}} the {{background}} of the album's sound, saying, I'm 28 years old, and I see that I'm kind of in this weird position. I don't have many friends in my personal life, but I have so many fans. So when I go outside and people recognize me, it's kind of a bittersweet feeling, like I don't recognize the fans. I don't really have it like they probably think I have it. I'm really still a loser guy, but I'm just really popular now. I don't have a girlfriend no more, and I have this money, but I'm not satisfied with my life. It's this weird feeling of being incomplete, and I need to find myself. So that's kind of what it did to me, and the album just came <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> just fucking rapping some dark shit.|$|E
500|$|Peter Sarsgaard played John Lotter, Lana's former boyfriend, who {{raped and}} murdered Teena. Sarsgaard {{was one of the}} first choices for the role. He later said he wanted his {{character}} to be [...] "likable, sympathetic even", because he wanted the audience [...] "to understand why they would hang <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> If my character wasn't necessarily likable, I wanted him to be charismatic enough that you weren't going to have a dull time if you were with him." [...] In another interview, Sarsgaard said he felt [...] "empowered" [...] by playing Lotter. In an interview with The Independent, Sarsgaard said, [...] "I felt very sexy, weirdly, playing John Lotter. I felt like I was just like the sheriff, y'know, and that everyone loved me." [...] Sarsgaard recalled watching footage of and reading about Lotter to prepare for the role. Peirce cast Alicia Goranson, known for playing Becky on the sitcom Roseanne, as Candace because of her likeness to Lisa Lambert. Like Sevigny, Goranson had also initially auditioned for the lead role.|$|E
500|$|In 1999, Sarsgaard earned {{critical}} {{recognition in}} Kimberly Peirce's Boys Don't Cry, {{where he was}} cast as notorious killer John Lotter. The film {{is based on the}} real-life story of Brandon Teena, who was raped and murdered in 1993 by Lotter and Tom Nissen after they found out that he was a trans man. Boys Don’t Cry received overwhelmingly positive acclaim from critics, and his performance was critically well received. According to The Boston Globe, [...] "Peter [...] Sarsgaard... makes the killer's terrible trajectory not only believable, but grounded in the most mundane clodhopper behavior. He isn't a drooling monster, he's a guy you wouldn't look [...] twice at a bar or a convenience store." [...] A contributor from the Seattle Post-Intelligencer wrote [...] "It's a marvelous performance supported ably by... Sarsgaard as the unpredictable, sociopathic Lotter." [...] The film was screened at a special presentation at the 2000 Venice Film Festival. In regards to his character, as how Sarsgaard made him [...] "likeable, sympathetic even" [...] was because he wanted the audience [...] "to understand why they would hang <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> If my character wasn't necessarily likable, I wanted him to be charismatic enough that you weren't going to have a dull time if you were with him." [...] In another interview, Sarsgaard said he felt [...] "empowered" [...] by playing Lotter.|$|E

2500|$|I want to {{make this}} {{absolutely}} clear, I never raped anyone. Ever. And the charges of rape were dropped against me back in December [...] Even the state prosecutor involved in this case admitted that he didn't believe I ever raped anyone. The person that made these accusations against me changed her story about what happened that night every single time she told it. So, despite the fact that I never, ever, forced this girl to make <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> touch me, or anything, {{and despite the fact that}} it was extremely difficult for me to plead guilty to something I absolutely did not do, I chose to take the charge of misdemeanor indecent assault for the sake of avoiding yet more emotional and financial strains on my family, my loved ones, and myself. It's fair to say that the guys in Love Equals Death freaked out when all of this happened. I don't blame them for that – there isn't a guide book to follow in a situation like this. They made it clear to me that they needed to focus on the band and their career as best as they could, and that it would be best for me to focus on my defense. It hurt at the time, but I knew I did have to focus on defending myself.|$|E
6000|$|... "Emily," [...] I said, {{kissing her}} {{over and over}} again tenderly, [...] "you must come <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> then, this very minute, for I want to talk with you over matters of importance.

6000|$|... "Stewart, you're wanted outdoors," [...] called Nels, bluntly. [...] "Monty, you slope <b>out</b> here <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> You, Nick, an' Stillwell--I reckon {{the rest}} of you hed better shut the doors an' stay inside." ...|$|R
60|$|Indeed, I am a most unfortunate creature; {{everything}} turns <b>out</b> badly <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> My good, true friend, my dear Selina, {{has become}} {{the object of a}} hateful doubt in my secret mind. I am afraid she is keeping something from me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Will {{you come}} <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>me?</b> I {{would rather not}} come in. I want to--to talk with you--and {{to go with you}} to the cemetery." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Used to be, but--say, I {{tell you}} what you do: you go <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> to-morrow, and I'll give you a history of the township." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Would you go <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> {{and tell}} him that I never meant to leave him?" [...] she asked simply, turning to Halleck. [...] "You--and Olive?" ...|$|E
60|$|When Sally got <b>out</b> alone <b>with</b> <b>me</b> {{she made}} me ride {{to keep her from}} disappearing somewhere on the horizon. This morning I wanted her to enjoy to the fullest her utter freedom and to feel that for once I could not catch her.|$|R

60|$|The Story Girl crept <b>out</b> <b>with</b> Felix and <b>me</b> to {{the morning}} orchard, while Dan and Peter went to do the barn work.|$|R
60|$|TANNER. Rhoda was to {{have come}} {{with me for a}} ride in the motor car. She says Ann has {{forbidden}} her to go <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E

6000|$|... "Virginia," [...] he said suddenly, {{stopping}} {{in front of}} her, [...] "I have the license in my pocket. Won't you come <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> and be married?" ...|$|E
6000|$|To {{return in}} this {{rambling}} {{letter to the}} subject I set <b>out</b> <b>with,</b> let <b>me</b> recommend my friend, Mr. Clarice, to your acquaintance and good offices; his worth entitles him to the one, and his gratitude will merit the other.

6000|$|... "It {{seemed to}} me," [...] he said, in his quiet tone and looking {{on the ground}} in the gloomy shed full of shadows, [...] "that I was on the point of just {{attaining}} a great and wonderful felicity. Another drink, I felt, would do it. The others were holding <b>out</b> well <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> glass for glass." ...|$|R
6000|$|And then he knew me {{and grinned}} broadly. [...] "'Scuse me, boss; you is de gen'l'man what rid <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> dis mawnin'. Thank you kindly, suh." ...|$|E
6000|$|Lambert issued his command. [...] "Get your outfits together. I don't {{understand}} how you got here, but you're going to get <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> within the next half-hour." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. He'll find it, too, {{if it is}} to be done. I thought you'd like to know, so {{that you}} could go <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> and the soldiers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Master Conway, I {{knows you}} like a-doing things.

6000|$|... "And {{why should}} he be <b>out</b> of humour <b>with</b> <b>me?</b> I only {{suggested}} to him that it might suit him to live at Belton instead of at that farm of his, down in Norfolk." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All ready are you, my boy?" [...] {{said the}} old man, in his cheeriest voice. [...] "Well, that's good, an' you look as nice as possible.

6000|$|... "That is {{just what}} I am saying, Malinche.

6000|$|... "That small sum in arithmetic," [...] he remonstrated, [...] "had {{already passed}} through my brain. Send in your selling order, Jim, and come <b>out</b> to lunch <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> I've come {{straight}} through from Washington--only got in this morning." ...|$|R
