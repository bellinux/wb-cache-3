Based on analysis of the quantity of lignite reserves and the exploitation conditions within the Kosovo Basin, the Ministry of Energy and Mining in Kosovo has classified Zone C or the so-called the [...] "New Mine" [...] as the most suitable for exploitation, together with Zone D of Kosovo basin or the so-called [...] "Dardhishtë" [...] in Albanian. Zone G and I of the Kosovo basin have also been evaluated as very suitable for future exploitation based on their reserve quantity and <b>overburden</b> <b>to</b> <b>coal</b> <b>ratio.</b> These two zones have been evaluated to be of sufficient capacity to enable the construction and running of new power plants. These four zones have been classified as Priority 1 (Zone C and Zone D), and Priority 2 (Zone G and Zone I), while the zones classified under Priority 3 have poor conditions for exploitation, either due to degradation such as Zone E or poor <b>overburden</b> <b>to</b> <b>coal</b> <b>ratio</b> such as Zones F,H, J and K.

An extensive coal deposit was found two kilometres {{to the north of}} the Anglesea township, with mining commencing in 1959 to supply brown coal to industry and institutions in the Geelong area. The mining rights were taken over by Western Mining Corporation (WMC) in 1961 to supply the power station planned by Alcoa of Australia. The Mines (Aluminum Agreement) Act of 1961 granted Alcoa a 50year exclusive right to explore and mine over some 7350 ha of leasehold land in the region. After further drilling investigation WMC relocated the mining operation to the east of the original mine, closer to the power station site and providing access to a larger coal reserve of 50 e6LT t. The total thickness of the coal seams is about 140 m, with total economic mineable reserves estimated at 70 e6LT t in the upper seam, and a further 90 e6LT t in lower seams.

40|$|Opencast mining alters {{surface and}} {{subsurface}} hydrology {{of a landscape}} both during and post-mining. At mine closure, following opencast mining in mines with low <b>overburden</b> <b>to</b> <b>coal</b> <b>ratios,</b> a void is left in the final landform. This final void is {{the location of the}} active mine pit at closure. Voids are generally not infilled within the mines' lifetime, because of the prohibitive cost of earthwork operations, and they become post-mining water bodies or pit lakes. Water quality is a significant issue for pit lakes. Groundwater within coal seams and associated rocks can be saline, depending {{on the nature of the}} strata and groundwater circulation patterns. This groundwater may be preferentially drawn to and collected in the final void. Surface runoff to the void will not only collect salts from rainfall and atmospheric fallout, but also from the ground surface and the weathering of fresh rock. As the void water level rises, its evaporative surface area increases, concentrating salts that are held in solution. This paper presents a study of the long term, water quality trends in a post-mining final void in the Hunter Valley, New South Wales, Australia. This process is complex and occurs long tern, and modelling offers the only method of evaluating water quality. Using available geochemical, climate and hydrogeological data as inputs into a mass-balance model, water quality in the final void was found to increase rapidly in salinity through time (2452 to 8909 mg l(- 1) over 500 years) as evaporation concentrates the salt in the void and regional groundwater containing high loads of salt continues to flow into the void.

All the processes occurring in a moving bed gasifier, drying, devolatilization, gasification, and combustion, {{are included in}} this model. The model, developed in Aspen Plus, is used to predict the effect of various operating parameters including pressure, oxygen <b>to</b> <b>coal,</b> and steam <b>to</b> <b>coal</b> <b>ratio</b> on the product gas composition. The results obtained from the simulation were compared with experimental data in the literature. The predicted composition of the product gas was in general agreement with the established results.

For the laboratory-scale system, mercury capture efficiency peaked at 94 % at a sorbent feed rate of 71 mg/m 3, with sorbent <b>to</b> <b>coal</b> <b>ratio</b> of 0. 0074. For the slip-stream system, mercury capture efficiency achieved 92 % at a sorbent feed rate of 622 mg/m 3, with sorbent <b>to</b> <b>coal</b> <b>ratio</b> of 0. 015. The required sorbent feed rates for both systems were higher than those kinetically estimated from earlier established lab-scale study, indicating the interference of other species in coal combustion flue gas. The sorbent generation technique and injection location significantly affected the {{physical and chemical properties}} of the sorbent, and subsequently its performance. Pure anatase generated via a pre-synthesized technique was found to be more effective than a mixture of anatase and rutile crystalline structure generated via in-situ generation and found in commercial TiO 2 (Degussa, P 25).

40|$|The goal of {{this project}} is to develop an {{inexpensive}} method to remove organic sulfur from pyrite-free and mineral-free coal using base, air, and readily available farm products. This is accomplished by treating coals with impregnating coals with polyunsaturated offs, converting the oils to their hydroperoxides, and heating. Since these oils are relatively inexpensive and easily applied, this project {{could lead to a}} cost effective method for removing organic sulfur from coals. Moreover, the oils are environmentally safe; they produce no noxious products and improve burning qualities of the solid products. IBC- 108 coal, (contains only 0. 4 % pyrite and 2. 7 % organic sulfur) was first treated with Na{sub 4 }OH at two different concentrations and four different times, and with NH{sub 4 }OH at two different concentrations and two different temperatures. Pretreating IBC- 108 coal with bases removes 13 % to 23 % of the sulfur, and NaOH is a better treatment than NH{sub 4 }OH in most of the experiments. Higher temperatures, higher base concentrations, and longer treatment times remove more sulfur. Na{sub 2 }CO{sub 3 } is more effective than NaOH for oil extraction after the oil treatment. To test for effectiveness of sulfur removal, eight coal samples were treated with NaOH (two concentrations at four different times) were further treated with linseed oil at three temperatures, four different times, and two oil <b>to</b> <b>coal</b> <b>ratios.</b> The combination of NaOH pretreatment, then oil treatment, followed by Na{sub 2 }CO{sub 3 } extraction, removes 23 % to 50 % of the sulfur.

40|$|The Hynol Process for {{conversion}} of coal {{and natural gas}} to methanol as a liquid fuel consists of three consecutive unit operations: (1) hydrogasification of coal, (2) steam reforming of the methane formed and added natural gas feedstock, and (3) catalytic methanol synthesis. The Hynol Process is a total recycle process. Using a process simulation computer program, mass and energy balances and yields and efficiency data have been obtained {{for a range of}} natural gas <b>to</b> <b>coal</b> feedstock <b>ratios.</b> Although the methanol yield increases with natural gas <b>to</b> <b>coal</b> feed <b>ratio,</b> the cost of feedstock per unit methanol is insensitive over a wide range of feedstock ratios.

40|$|A {{process model}} for {{turbulent}} pressurized circulating fluidized-bed coal gasifier is created using ASPEN PLUS software. Both hydrodynamic and reaction kinetics parameter {{are taken into}} account, whose expressions for fluidized bed are adopted from the literature. Various reactor models available in ASPEN PLUS with calculator as External Block are nested to solve hydrodynamics and kinetics. Multiple operational parameters for a pilot-plant circulating fluidized-bed coal gasifier are used to demonstrate the effects on coal gasification characteristics. This paper presents detailed information regarding the simulation model, including robust analysis {{of the effect of}} stoichiometric <b>ratio,</b> steam <b>to</b> <b>coal</b> <b>ratio,</b> gasification temperature and gasification agent temperature. It is observed that, with the increase in the flow rate of air, the components hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and methane reduce, which causes the Lower Heating Value (LHV) of synthesis gas (Syn. Gas) to decrease by about 29. 3 %, while increment in the steam flow rate shows a minute increase in heating value of only 0. 8 %. Stoichiometric ratio has a direct relationship to carbon conversion efficiency and carbon dioxide production. Increasing the steam <b>to</b> <b>coal</b> <b>ratio</b> boosts the production of hydrogen and carbon monoxide, and causes a drop in both carbon dioxide concentration and the conversion efficiency of carbon. High gasifying agent temperature is desired because of high concentration of CO and H 2, increasing carbon conversion and LHV. A high gasifying agent temperature is the major factor that affects the <b>coal</b> gasification <b>to</b> enhance H 2 and CO production rapidly along with other gasification characteristics...|$|R

40|$|One form of Chemical Looping Combustion (CLC) with CO 2 capture as an {{alternative}} to the burning of solid fuels is the Chemical Looping with Oxygen Uncoupling (CLOU) process. The CLOU process requires metal oxides with O 2 release capacity at temperatures that are suitable for solid fuel combustion, e. g. copper and manganese oxides. A Cu-Mn mixed oxide comprising 34 wt% CuO and 66 wt% Mn 3 O 4 and prepared by fluidized bed granulation was analysed for use as an oxygen carrier for the CLOU process. TGA and batch fluidized bed reactors were used to investigate oxygen generation rates, agglomeration behaviour and oxygen carrier attrition. A medium volatile coal from South Africa and its char were used as fuel in a batch fluidized bed reactor in a temperature range of 800 – 930 °C. The Cu-Mn oxygen carrier showed good release O 2 rate and a high rate of oxygen transfer by direct gas-solid reaction. The presence of CO as a combustion product appeared only at low oxygen carrier <b>to</b> <b>coal</b> <b>ratios.</b> This material has the capacity to generate O 2 at lower temperatures than needed for Cu-based oxygen carriers, which suggests that this material is suitable for work at lower temperatures in a fuel reactor with complete combustion of the fuel.

It involves a two step process, pre-treatment with acetic-acid followed by extraction with NMP containing a small amount of EDA (co-solvent). Being a high ash coal, pre-treatment with acid enhances the extraction yield as the acid loosens the coal structure and breaks important linkages in coal making the inroads of the solvent easier inside the intermolecular spaces in coal (Masaki et al. 2005; Li et al. 2004). The work on the development of designer solvent e, N where coal: NMP ratio is taken as 1 : 17 (wt/vol) and coal:EDA ratio taken as 1 : 1 (wt/vol) has already been studied before in author’s laboratory (Pande and Sharma 2002; Iino et al. 1988).

During Quarter 14 (January [...] March 1996), parametric testing of the 30 -inch Microcel{trademark} flotation column at the Lady Dunn Plant continued under Subtask 3. 2. Subtask 3. 3 testing, investigating a novel Hydrophobic Dewatering process (HD), continued this quarter with parametric testing of the batch dewatering unit. Coal product moistures of 3 to 12 percent were achieved, with higher percent solids slurry feeds resulting in lower product moistures. For a given percent solids feed, the product moisture decreased with increasing butane <b>to</b> dry <b>coal</b> <b>ratios.</b> Stirring time, stirring rate, and settling time were all found to have {{little effect on the}} final moisture content. Continuing Subtask 6. 4 work, investigating coal-water-fuel slurry formulation for coals cleaned by selective agglomeration, indicated that pH adjustment to 10 resulted in marginally better (lower viscosity) slurries for one of the two coals tested. Subtask 6. 5 agglomeration bench-scale testing results indicate that the new Taggart coal requires a grind with a d{sub 80 } of approximately 33 microns to achieve the 1 lb ash/MBtu product quality specification. Also under Subtask 6. 5, reductions in the various trace element concentrations accomplished during selective agglomeration were determined. Work was essentially completed on the detailed design of the PDU selective agglomeration module under Task 7 with the issuing of a draft report...|$|R

40|$|This thesis work evaluates whether {{municipal}} solid waste (MSW) may be a viable alternative and renewable fuel source within the United States. The framework for achieving this objective is split into two large, distinct studies. The first study discerns the relationship between MSW composition (including varying moisture), air pollutant concentrations and associated heating values. Models included AspenPlus® software for the deterministic simulation modeling of thermodynamic and pollution information, and U. S. EPA models WAR and WARM to determine the potential environmental impacts (PEI) and greenhouse gas emission equivalencies, respectively, for each MSW scenario. An economic profitability analysis was also conducted. This study focused on five high impact air combustion products: SO 2, CO, CO 2, NO and NO 2. Results show that flue gas concentrations (and therefore PEI) depend on the composition and moisture of the MSW, {{in addition to the}} MSW <b>to</b> <b>coal</b> <b>ratio.</b> The recycled paper and composted organics scenario gave the lowest heating value (8, 251 MBtu/lb). Approximate ranges for the WAR results (PEI/hr) are 7, 410 to 7, 663 for NO, 4 to 8 for NO 2, 18 to 105 for CO, 30 to 46 for CO 2, and 89 to 2, 152 for SO 2. WARM results show lower net CO 2 emission equivalents to landfill MSW with reduced paper and organics, while combustion is preferred for MSW with paper, organics, or plastics reduction. Reduction in pollutant concentrations yielded a reduction in profit between ~ 20 - 30 %. There were savings associated with emission costs by using MSW in lieu of coal: up to ~ 3. 3 % for NO, ~ 20 - 47 % for NO 2, and ~ 95 % for SO 2. In summary, the measurable impact MSW composition and moisture had on pollutant concentration, heating value, and economic parameters were important. The second study is used to link the information gathered in the first study with legislative actions locally and abroad. In this study, four unique scenarios and one aggregate scenario varied subsidies, health impacts, fines, energy credits and fiscal policy data and distributions using Monte Carlo analysis to evaluate and foster policy initiatives while determining the economic feasibility of MSW as a renewable fuel for municipalities. Results show the supply stack for electricity generation uses the cheapest fuel (coal), then the second cheapest (natural gas) until demand is met or more fuels are needed. The social marginal cost (SMC) without considering further policy changes yields costs of $ 0. 165 /kWh for coal, $ 0. 209 /kWh for NG and $ 0. 349 /kWh for MSW. Implementing policy changes for internalizing the health impacts currently paid for by the community and the aggregate impact of all scenarios would level the economic playing field for MSW, providing lower SMC’s of $ 0. 327 /kWh for MSW in both cases, and higher SMC’s for coal and NG in other scenarios such that the order of the supply stack changes. This work advances the fundamental understanding of the economic limitations and advantages, and the policies needed to foster further proliferation of MSW as a fuel...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} work, iron {{recovery}} from a low-grade hematite ore (containing less than 40 % iron), {{which is not}} applicable in common methods of ironmaking, was studied. Non-coking coal was used as reducing agent. Reduction experiments were performed under various <b>coal</b> <b>to</b> hematite <b>ratios</b> and temperatures. Reduction degree was calculated using the gravimetric method. Reduced samples were subjected to magnetic separation followed by X-ray diffraction analysis. Total iron content, degree of metallization and recovery efficiency in magnetic part were determined by quantitative chemical analysis, which were obtained about 82 %, 95 % and 64 % respectively under optimal conditions. CaO as an additive improved ore reducibility and separation efficiency. The microstructure of reduced samples and final products were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy. Final product {{with a high degree}} of metallization can be used in steel making furnaces and charging of blast furnaces which can improve production efficiency and decrease coke usage...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Chemical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008. Coal is an {{important}} fuel for countries with large coal reserves such as South Africa since {{it is expected that}} oil and natural gas prices will continue to rise. The Waterberg coalfield contains 40 % of South Africa's remaining coal reserves, but {{due to the lack of}} a good infrastructure (water and railway) there are currently only a few operations in the Waterberg. The utilization of remote coal reserves, such as the Waterberg coalfield, is difficult and requires an investigation of possible coal conversion processes. The extraction of high-ash bituminous coal, using an organic solvent, had been studied by coal researchers before as a possible method <b>to</b> convert <b>coal</b> into valuable products. The purpose of the solvent is to extract organic material from the coal while the inorganic mineral matter (ash) is left behind. Advantages of the solvent extraction process include mild operating conditions compared to an indirect liquefaction process, low C 02 release and coal as major utility since the solvent can be recycled. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the solvent extraction of South African coal using a coal-derived solvent. Batch extraction experiments were carried out for two South African coals - one a vitrinite-rich coal (Waterberg) and the other an inertinite-rich coal (Brandspruit). A vitrinite-rich American coal (lllinois# 6) was used as benchmark. Residue oil was the selected coal-derived industrial solvent used for the extractions. High extraction yields (d. a. f) were obtained for Waterberg (29 - 63 %) and lllinois# 6 coal (55 - 74 %), while only limited success was achieved with Brandspruit coal (maximum 17 %). This shows that solvent extraction, using residue oil as solvent, is a possible <b>coal</b> conversion process <b>to</b> convert vitrinite-rich South African coal into valuable products. For the operating conditions investigated in this study it was found that 370 ^ is the optimum extraction temperature and 5 : 1 the optimum solvent <b>to</b> <b>coal</b> <b>ratio,</b> while the particle size did not have a significant influence on the extraction yield. Continuous extraction experiments were carried out for the same two South African coals used in the batch extraction experiments and also with residue oil as solvent. Extraction temperatures and residence times were limited by the experimental setup. Negative extraction yields were obtained that could be explained by the effect of coal particles adsorbing compounds in the residue oil during the filtration step, which was performed at room temperature. To compensate for the adsorption process, the extraction yields were calculated with the extraction data at the lowest temperature as basis instead of the feed coal data. Extraction yields (d. a. f) of 20 - 52 % were then obtained for the Waterberg coal and 3 - 12 % for Brandspruit coal, with the highest extraction yield observed at 340 °C and residence time of 12 min. In general, an increase in extraction yield with increase in temperature as well as with increase in residence time was observed. The shrinking-core model was used to describe the solvent extraction process and provided a good fit for the experimental data. Activation energies of 324 kJ/mol for Waterberg coal and 134 kJ/mol for Brandspruit coal were determined. Finally, it was found that most of the results of the continuous extraction experiments were in line with the results of the batch extraction experiments. In conclusion, the objectives of this investigation were met and form a good basis for further extraction research. In general it can be recommended to expand the conditions of this investigation to check the accuracy of the conclusions made. The most important areas for future research in developing a commercial-scale process include separation of residue coal from the extract, recycling of the solvent, and hydrogenation studies on the liquid extract product.
