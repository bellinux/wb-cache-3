5|$|Glenn McCarthy was {{a modest}} oil worker who pioneered wells around what the Houston area. In 1932, he struck <b>oil</b> <b>at</b> Anahuac near the Galveston Bay. Over the next decade, he made {{dozens of other}} strikes and quickly became one of Texas' richest men. His extravagance was legendary leading to his {{becoming}} $52 million in debt in 1952 ($ in present-day terms). His love of bourbon led him to establish the WildCatter bourbon label. His excesses made him an unwilling national celebrity during the 1940s and 1950s as the media became enamored with tales of Texas oil wealth.|$|E
5|$|In 1900, after Galveston {{was struck}} by a devastating hurricane, efforts to make Houston into a viable deep-water port were accelerated. The {{following}} year, the discovery of <b>oil</b> <b>at</b> the Spindletop oil field near Beaumont prompted the development of the Texas petroleum industry. In 1902, President Theodore Roosevelt approved a $1-million improvement project for the Houston Ship Channel. By 1910, the city's population had reached 78,800, almost doubling from a decade before. African Americans formed {{a large part of the}} city's population, numbering 23,929 people, which was nearly one-third of the residents.|$|E

5|$|Since the {{kauri gum}} {{was found to}} mix more easily with linseed <b>oil,</b> <b>at</b> lower temperatures, than other resins, by the 1890s, 70 percent of all oil {{varnishes}} made in England used kauri gum. It was used to a limited extent in paints during the late 19th century, and from 1910 was used extensively {{in the manufacture of}} linoleum. From the 1930s, the market for gum dropped as synthetic alternatives were found, but there remained niche uses for the gum in jewellery and specialist high-grade varnish for violins.|$|E

40|$|Plant {{essential}} oils {{have the potential}} to replace the synthetic fungicides in the management of postharvest diseases of fruit and vegetables. The aim {{of this study was to}} access the in vitro and in vivo activity of essential oil obtained from oregano (Origanum vulgare L. ssp. hirtum), chyme (Thymus vulgaris L.) and lemon (Citrus limon L.) plants, against some important postharvest pathogens (Botrytis cinerea, Penicillium italicum and P. digitatum). In vitro experiments indicated that P italicum did not show any mycelium growth in presence of thyme essential <b>oils</b> <b>at</b> concentration of 0. 13 mu l/ml. Moreover, B. cinerea did not show any mycelium growth in presence of lemon and oregano essential <b>oils</b> <b>at</b> concentration of 17 mu l/ml and 0. 02 mu l/ml, respectively. Moreover, the {{essential oils}} from three species were effective in reducing the spore germination. The in vivo experiments confirmed the strong efficacy shown in vitro by essential oils. These oregano and lemon oils were very effective in controlling disease seventy of infected fruit by B. cinera in tomatoes, strawberries and cucumbers. In tomatoes, grey mould due CO B. cinerea was completed inhibited by oregano essential <b>oils</b> <b>at</b> 0. 30 mu l/ml. Moreover, lemon essential oils induced a significant reduction of grey mould disease severity. In strawberries, grey mould was completed inhibited by lemon essential <b>oils</b> <b>at</b> 0. 05 mu l/ml. In addition, lemon essential <b>oils</b> <b>at</b> 0. 05 mu l/ml showed 39 % reduction of infected cucumber fruits by B. cinerea. These results indicate that essential oils after suitable formulation could be used for the control of postharvest diseases caused by Botrytis and Penicillium pathogen...|$|R
5|$|To {{navigate}} the Bay of Gibraltar {{prior to the}} opening of the lighthouse sailors were dependent on the light emitted by the Shrine of Our Lady of Europe, Roman Catholic shrine, which was originally a mosque built after the victory of King Ferdinand IV of Spain over the Moors at the 1309 siege.

5|$|After {{years of}} failed {{attempts}} to extract {{oil from the}} salt domes near Beaumont, a small enterprise known as the Gladys City Oil, Gas, and Manufacturing Company was joined in 1899 by Croatian/Austrian mechanical engineer Anthony F. Lucas, an expert in salt domes. Lucas joined the company {{in response to the}} numerous ads the company's founder Pattillo Higgins placed in industrial magazines and trade journals. Lucas and his colleagues struggled for two years to find <b>oil</b> <b>at</b> a location known as Spindletop Hill before making a strike in 1901. The new well produced approximately 100,000 barrels of oil per day, an unprecedented level of production at the time. The 1902 total annual production at Spindletop exceeded 17 million barrels. The state's total production in 1900 had been only 836,000 barrels. The overabundance of supply led oil prices in the U.S. to drop to a record low of 3 cents per barrel, less than the price of water in some areas.|$|E
5|$|In September 2015 at Wageningen University in the Netherlands, {{students}} and entrepreneurs presented a fully automatic, prototype vending machine that cooks frozen potato strips by deep frying them. The final product is served with mayonnaise, ketchup or curry. The process takes around two minutes {{from start to}} finish, in which the product is served in a paper cup. The potato strips are stored in a frozen state inside the machine at −18°C, and it cooks them in <b>oil</b> <b>at</b> 180°C. The unit uses a specially-designed dispenser to prevent the potatoes from being crushed or broken. As of September 2015, only the single prototype is available, which is housed at Wageningen University. Orders are placed using a touchscreen, and a fork and salt are provided separately in a box.|$|E

5|$|Kirchner {{proposed}} a fiscal austerity program in early 2012, including the gradual removal of subsidies. The proposal {{turned out to}} be unpopular, and was not implemented. She opted instead to send a bill to Congress for the renationalization of YPF, privatized in 1993, blaming the Spanish company Repsol for the energy trade deficit. The bill was approved by the Chamber of Deputies by a 207-32 margin. It was criticized as an authoritarian move, as there was no negotiation with Repsol. As well, the Vaca Muerta oil field had been discovered by this time. However, YPF was unable to afford the costs to exploit the <b>oil</b> <b>at</b> the site, and the rights to drill at Vaca Muerta were sold to the Chevron Corporation. The costs of energy imports increased the trade deficit and the inflation rate, and power outages became frequent. Outages usually took place on the hottest days of the summer season, as the use of air conditioning increased electricity consumption to peak levels.|$|E
5|$|The {{series of}} taxes levied on oil {{production}} in Alaska has changed several times since 1977, {{but the overall}} form remains mostly the same. Alaska receives royalties from oil production on state land. The state also has a property tax on oil production structures and transportation (pipeline) property—the only state property tax in Alaska. There is a special corporate income tax on petroleum companies, and the state taxes the amount of petroleum produced. This production tax is levied {{on the cost of}} <b>oil</b> <b>at</b> Pump Station 1. To calculate this tax, the state takes the market value of the oil, subtracts transportation costs (tanker and pipeline tariffs), subtracts production costs, then multiplies the resulting amount per barrel of oil produced each month. The state then takes a percentage of the dollar figure produced.|$|E

40|$|Engine oils undergo {{oxidative}} {{degradation and}} wears out during service. Hence {{it is important}} to characterize ageing of engine <b>oils</b> <b>at</b> different simulated conditions to evaluate the performance of existing oils and also design new formulations. This work focuses on characterizing the thermo-oxidative degradation of synthetic and semi-synthetic engine <b>oils</b> aged <b>at</b> 120, 149 and 200 °C. Apparent activation energy of decomposition of aged oils evaluated using the isoconversional Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose technique was used as a thermal stability marker. The temporal variation of stability at different ageing temperatures was corroborated with kinematic viscosity, oxidation, sulfation and nitration indices, total base number, antiwear additive content and molecular structure of the organic species present in the <b>oils.</b> <b>At</b> the lowest temperature employed, synthetic oil underwent higher rate of oxidation, while semi-synthetic oil was stable for longer time periods. At higher temperatures, the initial rate of change of average apparent activation energy of synthetic oil correlated well with a similar variation in oxidation number. A mixture of long chain linear, branched, and cyclic hydrocarbons were observed when semi-synthetic <b>oil</b> was degraded <b>at</b> higher temperatures...|$|R

30|$|In {{the case}} of the {{treatment}} of olives at veraison, the phenolic content increases significantly in olives {{a few days after the}} application of the treatment and then begins to decline regularly during maturation until reaching a minimum recorded at full maturity. This treatment also results in a significant increase in the diffusion of the total polyphenols in the <b>oils</b> <b>at</b> veraison, and then this diffusion gradually decreases during maturation, with minimum values at maturity which nevertheless remain very high compared with those of the control. The gain of polyphenol <b>oils</b> <b>at</b> full maturity is about 172 % in comparison with the control at the same stage.
