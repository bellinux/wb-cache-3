5|$|After {{returning}} to England, Spurr {{worked as a}} journalist. In 1952 The London Daily Express sent him to Japan as its China and Far East correspondent, but he found that he had little time to resume his pursuit <b>of</b> <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fate of Yamato. In the mid-1970s Spurr returned to the Far East again, this time as {{a writer for the}} Far Eastern Economic Review. He began conducting interviews about Yamato with former Japanese naval commanders and survivors of the battleship's last mission. He also gained access to Japanese naval documents and records seized by the United States, plus US interrogation transcripts. For the American side of the story, he interviewed US naval commanders and personnel involved in the sinking of Yamato. Satisfied with what he had, Spurr began writing the book in the late 1970s, over 30 years after he first found out about the battleship.|$|E
5|$|Ronald Victor Courtenay Bodley, MC (3 March 1892– 26 May 1970) was a British Army officer, {{author and}} journalist. Born to English parents in Paris, {{he lived in}} France until he was nine, before {{attending}} Eton College and then the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. He was commissioned in the King's Royal Rifle Corps and served with them during the First World War. After the war he spent seven years in the Sahara desert, and then travelled through Asia. Bodley wrote several books about his travels. He was considered among the most distinguished British writers on the Sahara, {{as well as one}} of the main western sources <b>of</b> <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> South Pacific Mandate.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{reference to}} a garden at Little Moreton Hall comes from an early 17th-century set of household accounts referring to a gardener and the purchase of some seeds. Philip Moreton, who ran the estate for his older brother Edward in the mid-17th century, left a considerable amount <b>of</b> <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> layout and planting of the area of garden within the moat, {{to the west of}} the house. He writes of a herb garden, vegetable garden, and a nursery for maturing fruit trees until they were ready to be transferred to the orchard at the south and east of the house, probably where the orchard is today.|$|E

5|$|The {{highlight}} of the fighting became the bloody struggle for the large Raevsky redoubt {{near the village of}} Borodino. The French managed to capture this redoubt late into the day, gradually forcing the rest of the Russian army to pull back as well. The Russians suffered terrible casualties during the fighting, losing over a third of their army. French losses were also heavy, exacerbating the logistical difficulties that Napoleon encountered in the campaign. The exhaustion of the French forces, and the lack <b>of</b> <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> condition of the Russian army, persuaded Napoleon to remain on the battlefield with his army instead of ordering the kind of vigorous pursuit reminiscent of previous campaigns.|$|E
5|$|The {{only other}} major source <b>of</b> <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> games is Cassius Dio {{who lived in}} the latter second and early third centuries. His History of Rome spans 80 books written in 22 years, but much of which are only fragments. He is noted for his {{attention}} to detail in administrative affairs, but for major events his writing can be merely impressionistic, with a greater emphasis put on his interpretation of the events' significance within the wider historical context rather than reporting details. His sources are varied: he relies on many of the major commentators but also seems to have paid close attention to public records. His account of the Titus games is not sourced.|$|E

5|$|Xenosaga I & II is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} which retells {{the events of}} Xenosaga Episode I and its direct sequel Episode II. Cutscenes and the in-game environments and character sprites are displayed on the Nintendo DS (DS) console's top screen, with events outside still animated cutscenes taking place from an angled top-down perspective using two-dimensional graphics. Additional information is displayed on the DS's bottom screen. Environments can be freely explored, with breakable chests holding consumable items and accessories. Shops within the levels {{can be used to}} purchase items and equipment using in-game currency. Special EVA structures within the environment can be used to recover health points (HP) and a type of skill point called ether points (EP). Characters are able to both roam around open environments and enter story-based dungeons. During the course of the story, the player receives emails through the U.M.N. service, which is also used to store the game's glossary, a store <b>of</b> <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> world and characters.|$|E
5|$|The upper {{atmosphere}} of Venus {{can be measured}} from Earth when the planet crosses the sun in a rare event known as a solar transit. The last solar transit of Venus occurred in 2012. Using quantitative astronomical spectroscopy, scientists were able to analyse sunlight that passed through the planet's atmosphere to reveal chemicals within it. As the technique to analyse light to discover information about a planet's atmosphere only first showed results in 2001, {{this was the first}} opportunity to gain conclusive results in this way on the atmosphere of Venus since observation of solar transits began. This solar transit was a rare opportunity considering the lack <b>of</b> <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> atmosphere between 65 and 85km. The solar transit in 2004 enabled astronomers to gather a large amount of data useful not only in determining the composition of the {{upper atmosphere}} of Venus, but also in refining techniques used in searching for extrasolar planets. The atmosphere of mostly CO2, absorbs near-infrared radiation, making it easy to observe. During the 2004 transit, the absorption in the atmosphere as a function of wavelength revealed the properties of the gases at that altitude. The Doppler shift of the gases also enabled wind patterns to be measured.|$|E
