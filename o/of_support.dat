40|$|This study {{sought to}} {{investigate}} a new topic in the study <b>of</b> supervisor <b>support.</b> Previous measures <b>of</b> supervisor <b>support</b> have focused almost exclusively on availability <b>of</b> that <b>support.</b> In this paper the author introduces a new construct of use <b>of</b> supervisor <b>support.</b> It also investigates the relationship between use <b>of</b> supervisor <b>support</b> and the Big Five personality traits. Utilizing a cross-sectional research design, the author surveyed 227 (useable surveys) adults using Amazon's Mechanical Turk. The findings suggest that use <b>of</b> supervisor <b>support</b> is distinct from the availability <b>of</b> supervisor <b>support.</b> Use <b>of</b> supervisor <b>support</b> was negatively associated with subordinate???s perceptions of workplace stressors (e. g. organizational constraints & interpersonal conflict at work), while also negatively associated with negative job affect while controlling for the availability <b>of</b> supervisor <b>support.</b> These results provide evidence that use <b>of</b> supervisor <b>support</b> is an important construct in the supervisor-subordinate relationship. Regarding the relationship between use <b>of</b> supervisor <b>support</b> and personality, agreeableness was the only personality trait associated with both use of emotional and instrumental supervisor support while controlling for all Big Five Personality traits. Conscientiousness was also uniquely associated with use <b>of</b> instrumental supervisor <b>support,</b> but not use <b>of</b> emotional supervisor <b>support.</b> In conclusion, use <b>of</b> supervisor <b>support</b> can be a considered an important addition to organizational research and the understanding <b>of</b> supervisor <b>support...</b>|$|R

40|$|Bachelor thesis "Implementation <b>of</b> <b>supported</b> {{employment}} in the Czech Republic" attends to a service, which has been developing in the Czech Republic since 1995, {{but it has not}} been regulated by law yet. Supported employment provides support for people, who are disadvantaged in area job opportunities with aim to improve their self-reliance and to enable them to participate at the open labour market. First theoretical concepts related to supported employment are introduced. Then supported employment is defined with emphasis on its characterization, target group and inception of this service. In view of the fact there is no legal regulation <b>of</b> <b>supported</b> employment, the bachelor thesis deals with possibilities <b>of</b> implementation <b>of</b> <b>supported</b> {{employment in}} the Czech Republic and their regulation in legislation. For more understanding of the process <b>of</b> realization <b>of</b> <b>supported</b> employment there are defined actors and their role in this process.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the development and}} current status <b>of</b> <b>supported</b> employment, a relatively recent concept that holds much promise for improving the employment prospects of disabled people. It argues that supported employment offers a positive departure from the poor performance of traditional approaches to vocational rehabilitation and job placement. However the thesis demonstrates {{that because of the}} perspectives which inform the current concept <b>of</b> <b>supported</b> employment it can be disempowering and oppressive. The origins and current status <b>of</b> <b>supported</b> employment are explored to identify the central issues and concerns. The capacity and limits <b>of</b> <b>supported</b> employment in the broader arena <b>of</b> employment <b>support</b> services in New Zealand are revealed. The theoretical orientation of the thesis lies in the critical tradition. Three perspectives that have influenced policies and practices in the disability arena are examined The views and experiences of fourteen disabled people on the nature and performance <b>of</b> employment <b>support</b> services were obtained through individual interviews in order to reveal the central issues as defined by service users. Many of these people were also involved with the disability rights movement. The findings revealed a great deal of concern about the effectiveness <b>of</b> employment <b>support</b> services. In particular participants identified disabled people's lack of power in the development and use of services. A policy analysis <b>of</b> employment <b>support</b> services, a critical theoretical analysis of disability and the reflections of a group of service users contribute to the reconstruction <b>of</b> <b>supported</b> employment. An emancipatory model <b>of</b> <b>supported</b> employment is described in which disabled people are empowered to reveal the contradictions and power imbalances of conventional approaches to vocational rehabilitation and job placement. As a result employment support services and related policies are challenged to shift from a focus on assimilation in the workplace to the transformation of workplaces and employment support services in disabled people's interests...|$|R
