500|$|The Coleman oeuvre {{consists}} of a completed novella, Trouble at Willow Gables, set in a girls' boarding school; an incomplete sequel, Michaelmas Term at St Brides, set in a women's college at Oxford; seven short poems with a girls' school ambience; a fragment of pseudo-autobiography; and a critical essay purporting to be Coleman's literary apologia. [...] The manuscripts were stored in the Brynmor Jones Library at the University of Hull, where Larkin was chief librarian between 1955 and 1985. Their existence was revealed to the public when Larkin's Selected Letters and Andrew Motion's biography were published in 1992 and 1993 respectively. The Coleman works themselves were finally published, with other Larkin drafts and <b>oddments,</b> in 2002.|$|E

2500|$|Rituals, {{associated}} {{with use of}} fire, when into pit, exclusive of ashes get the various things, possibly immolation <b>oddments.</b> [...] Also some researchers argue, that in some rituals Cucuteni culture has use anthropomorphous, zoomorphous clay figurines, [...] binocular vessels.|$|E
40|$|Mathematical {{models of}} inventory-distribution routing problem for two-echelon {{agriculture}} products distribution network are established, {{which are based}} on two management modes, franchise chain and regular chain, one-to-many, interval periodic order, demand depending on inventory, deteriorating treatment cost of agriculture products, start-up costs of vehicles and so forth. Then, a heuristic adaptive genetic algorithm is presented for the model of franchise chain. For the regular chain model, a two-layer genetic algorithm based on <b>oddment</b> modification is proposed, in which the upper layer is to determine the distribution period and quantity and the lower layer is to seek the optimal order cycle, quantity, distribution routes, and the rational <b>oddment</b> modification number for the distributor. By simulation experiments, the validity of the algorithms is demonstrated, and the two management modes are compared...|$|R
25|$|To improve {{practicality}} further, self-levelling {{rear suspension}} and an integral load restraint system {{were added to}} the options list for the Tourer. Up to 100kg can be loaded onto the roof, which is more than rival executive cars of the time, and putting loads into the boot is made easier by the 544mm sill height. Four hinged chrome lashing eyes are fitted to the floor, and <b>oddment</b> stowage compartments and two recessed hooks are located in the side walls.|$|R
60|$|Then {{there are}} houses {{where the people}} {{employed}} in the paper-works lodge, a recently-acquired home for the better class of men, which was once a mansion of the De Clifford family, and afterwards a hospital, and a store where every kind of <b>oddment</b> is sold by Dutch auction. These articles are given to the Army, and among the week's collection I saw clocks, furniture, bicycles, a parrot cage, and a crutch. Not long ago the managers of this store had a goat presented to them, which nearly ate them out of house and home, as no one would buy it, {{and they did not}} like to send the poor beast to the butcher.|$|R
2500|$|In 1977, DAW Books republished Elric's saga in six {{books that}} {{collected}} the tales {{according to their}} internal chronology. [...] These paperbacks all featured cover art work by the same young artist, Michael Whelan, and helped to define the look of both Elric and his sword Stormbringer. [...] The DAW edition of Stormbringer restored some of the original structure and text compared to the 1965 release, but other revisions were performed and other material excised. [...] A few <b>oddments</b> were collected in Elric at the End of Time (1984), which became the seventh book in the DAW line when DAW released it in the US in 1985. [...] It includes two Elric-related tales: the title story and 1962's [...] "The Last Enchantment", originally intended as the final Elric story but put aside in favour of those that eventually made up Stormbringer; it was not published until 1978. [...] Both would appear in later collections (with [...] "The Last Enchantment" [...] occasionally retitled [...] "Jesting with Chaos").|$|E
2500|$|Unlike {{the first}} Escort (which was {{developed}} by Ford of Britain), the second generation was developed jointly between the UK and Ford of Germany. Codenamed [...] "Brenda" [...] during its development, it used the same mechanical components as the Mark I. The 940cc engine was still offered in Italy where the smaller engine attracted tax advantages, but in the other larger European markets in Europe it was unavailable. The estate and van versions used the same panelwork as the Mark I, but with the Mark II front end and interior. The car used a revised underbody, which had been introduced as a running change during {{the last six months}} production of the Mark I. Rear suspension still sat on leaf springs though some contemporaries such as the Hillman Avenger had moved on to coil springs. The car came in for criticism for its lack of <b>oddments</b> space, with a glove compartment only available on higher end models, and its stalk-mounted horn.|$|E

50|$|The first {{locomotives}} {{were constructed}} between 1984-5 and were numbered 319.201 to 319.220, these had three {{windows in the}} front of the cabin, and as a result got the nickname Retales (meaning 'patchwork' from retal a scrap, piece or <b>oddment).</b> Most were painted in grey/blue/yellow colour scheme, and later received the grey/yellow 'Taxi' colour scheme. Two units also received a brown, yellow and orange livery named Estrella. The machines worked well, and a further 20 locomotives were built in between 1990 and 1991 by Meinfesa, to the same electro-mechanical design but with two pane front windows and different body shape, the locomotives also had an air-conditioning unit fitted as standard into the design. These 58 machines formed the sub-class 319.2. 8 of the units were built for AVE with 1435mm gauge running gear (219.241 to 219.248) and received the white/grey AVE livery, the remainder received the standard freight yellow/grey 'Taxi' livery.|$|R
500|$|Regarding the interior, {{the seats}} drew praise for their comfort and detail design. However, again, Car {{provided}} a {{counterpoint to the}} effect that the Volvo was as roomy, despite its shorter wheelbase. The steering wheel was criticized in the same review for being too close to the driver´s legs. The ventilation temperature control was [...] "not satisfactory" [...] due to an unprogressive response at the cool end of the dial. There was no fan-blown cold air (cold air was by ram-effect) nor an option for cool air to be directed to the face {{at the same time as}} warmth being directed into the footwells. According to Car [...] the ventilation [...] "fell down badly" [...] on account of its awkward controls. <b>Oddment</b> accommodation was [...] "disappointment". Lacking a self-setting stay, opening the bonnet was [...] "heavy work" [...] and the boot, while large, had the demerit of an [...] "unusual" [...] locking method: [...] " [...] is locked before being shut by pushing in a red handle set in the inside of the lid".|$|R

60|$|Parload's truckle bed hid its gray sheets {{beneath an}} old {{patchwork}} counterpane {{on one side}} of the room, and veiled his boxes and suchlike <b>oddments,</b> and invading the two corners of the window were an old whatnot and the washhandstand, on which were distributed the simple appliances of his toilet.|$|E
60|$|Julien found Lady Anne in a small, stuffy {{apartment}} {{on the third floor}} of the house in the Rue St. Antoine. Before her was a sewing-machine, and the floor of the room was littered with <b>oddments</b> of black calico. She herself was seated apparently deep in thought before an untrimmed hat.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mrs. Seymore Fentolin {{sent down}} a hamper for you," [...] the woman replied, [...] "with {{a message from}} Mr. Fentolin.

6000|$|... "Oh! I am an old campaigner," [...] {{he assured}} her. [...] "I meant {{to pick up}} a few <b>oddments</b> in the village. I don't suppose I shall stay very long, anyhow, but I thought I'd like {{to have a look at}} the place. By-the-by, what sort of a man is Mr. Fentolin?" ...|$|E
60|$|She {{threw open}} the door and ushered him into what seemed indeed to be a little fairy chamber, a chamber with yellow walls and yellow rug, white furniture, <b>oddments</b> of china and photographs, silver-grey etchings, water-colour landscapes, piles of books and magazines. On a small table stood a yellow Sèvres vase, full of roses.|$|E
6000|$|He told a {{complicated}} story. The crystal he said {{had come into}} his possession with other <b>oddments</b> at the forced sale of another curiosity dealer's effects, and not knowing what its value might be, he had ticketed it at ten shillings. It had hung upon his hands at that price for some months, and {{he was thinking of}} [...] "reducing the figure," [...] when he made a singular discovery.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, that completes {{our search}} of your belongings, Doctor Gant," [...] the latter's voice observed. [...] "Now I {{want to ask}} a few {{questions}} {{with reference to the}} Mr. Phillips who I understand died the day before yesterday under your charge." [...] "That is so," [...] Doctor Gant agreed. [...] "He had no luggage, as we only made up our minds to undertake the journey with him at the last moment. The few <b>oddments</b> he used on the voyage, we burned." ...|$|E
60|$|Torpenhow was {{sprawling}} {{in a long}} {{chair with}} a small fox-terrier asleep on his chest, while Dick was preparing a canvas. A dais, a background, and a lay- figure were the only fixed objects in the place. They rose from a wreck of <b>oddments</b> that began with felt-covered water-bottles, belts, and regimental badges, and ended with a small bale of second-hand uniforms and a stand of mixed arms. The mark of muddy feet on the dais showed that a military model had just gone away. The watery autumn sunlight was falling, and shadows sat {{in the corners of}} the studio.|$|E
60|$|The lesson {{would have}} been easier had the deck been at all free; but there {{appeared}} to be a place on it for everything and anything except a man. Forward lay the windlass and its tackle, with the chain and hemp cables, all very unpleasant to trip over; the fo'c'sle stovepipe, and the gurry-butts by the fo'c'sle-hatch to hold the fish-livers. Aft of these the fore-boom and booby of the main-hatch took all the space that was not needed for the pumps and dressing-pens. Then came the nests of dories lashed to ring-bolts by the quarter-deck; the house, with tubs and <b>oddments</b> lashed all around it; and, last, the sixty-foot main-boom in its crutch, splitting things lengthwise, to duck and dodge under every time.|$|E
60|$|We {{entered the}} room all together, almost on tiptoe. If we had been wearing hats I am sure {{that we should have}} taken them off. How, with such trifling means at her command, she could have left behind in that tiny chamber so potent an {{impression}} of daintiness and comfort I cannot tell. But there it was. Her little bed, with its spotless counterpane, was hung with pink muslin. There was a lace spread upon her toilet-table, on which her little <b>oddments</b> of silver made a brave show. Only one thing seemed out of place, a worn little slipper peeping out from under a chair. I thrust it into my pocket. The others took some trifle from the table. Then, as silently as we had entered, we left the room. As I turned the key I choked down something in my throat, and did my best to laugh--a little unnaturally, I am afraid.|$|E
60|$|Weston did not answer, {{but there}} was a little {{satisfied}} smile in his eyes as he watched the horse wander away unhampered into the rain. After this they sat down to a very simple meal. Then they strapped their packs on their shoulders--a thick blanket each, a small bag of flour, some salt pork and green tea, and, while Grenfell carried the light ax, Weston slung a frying-pan, a kettle and a pannikin about him, as well as a rifle, for there are black-tail deer in that country, and they could not be sure that their provisions would last the journey through. The prospector soon discovers how much a man can do without, and it is a good deal more than men bred in the cities would suppose. The <b>oddments</b> rattled and banged about Weston's shoulders as he went up the steep slope through the thick timber; {{and by the time they}} had cleared the latter, Grenfell was visibly distressed, and both of them realized that their difficulties had commenced.|$|E
60|$|The back veranda of {{the shop}} was built out over the sheer hillside, and they looked down into their neighbours' chimney-pots, as is the custom of Simla. But {{even more than the}} purely Persian meal cooked by Lurgan Sahib with his own hands, the shop fascinated Kim. The Lahore Museum was larger, but here were more wonders--ghost-daggers and prayer-wheels from Tibet; {{turquoise}} and raw amber necklaces; green jade bangles; curiously packed incense-sticks in jars crusted over with raw garnets; the devil-masks of overnight and a wall full of peacock-blue draperies; gilt figures of Buddha, and little portable lacquer altars; Russian samovars with turquoises on the lid; egg-shell china sets in quaint octagonal cane boxes; yellow ivory crucifixes--from Japan of all places in the world, so Lurgan Sahib said; carpets in dusty bales, smelling atrociously, pushed back behind torn and rotten screens of geometrical work; Persian water-jugs for the hands after meals; dull copper incense-burners neither Chinese nor Persian, with friezes of fantastic devils running round them; tarnished silver belts that knotted like raw hide; hairpins of jade, ivory, and plasma; arms of all sorts and kinds, and a thousand other <b>oddments</b> were cased, or piled, or merely thrown into the room, leaving a clear space only round the rickety deal table, where Lurgan Sahib worked.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, that's to be {{wound up}} with a jerk," [...] {{answered}} his companion. [...] "I've settled all that. She wanted to hire somebody to take charge of the store while we're gone, and to sell out the things on her old plan; but that's all tomfoolery. I have engaged a shopkeeper at Romney to come out and buy the whole stock at retail price, and I gave him the money to do it with. That's good business, you know, because it's the same as money coming back to me, and as for the old <b>oddments,</b> and remnants, and endments of faded braids and rotten calicoes, it's a clear profit to be rid of them. If the Romney man sends them to be ground up at the paper-mill, he may pay himself for the cartage and his time. So the shop will be shut day after to-morrow, and you can see for yourself that my style of business is going to be of the stern, practical sort; and, after all, I don't see any better outlook for a fellow than to live a married life in which very little is expected of him, while he knows that he has on tap a good bank-account and a first-class moral character." ...|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile {{the shop}} slowly churned its <b>oddments.</b> Every Thursday {{afternoon}} James sorted out tangles of bits and bobs, antique garments and occasional finds. With these he trimmed his window, {{so that it}} looked like a historical museum, rather soiled and scrappy. Indoors he made baskets of assortments: threepenny, sixpenny, ninepenny and shilling baskets, rather like a bran pie in which everything was a plum. And then, on Friday evening, thin and alert he hovered behind the counter, his coat shabbily buttoned over his narrow chest, his face agitated. He had shaved his side-whiskers, so that they only grew becomingly as low as his ears. His rather large, grey moustache was brushed off his mouth. His hair, gone very thin, was brushed frail and floating over his baldness. But still a gentleman, still courteous, with a charming voice he suggested the possibilities of a pad of green parrots' tail-feathers, or of a few yards of pink-pearl trimming or of old chenille fringe. The women would pinch the thick, exquisite old chenille fringe, delicate and faded, curious to feel its softness. But they wouldn't give threepence for it. Tapes, ribbons, braids, buttons, feathers, jabots, bussels, appliqués, fringes, jet-trimmings, bugle-trimmings, bundles of old coloured machine-lace, many bundles of strange cord, in all colours, for old-fashioned braid-patterning, ribbons with H.M.S. Birkenhead, for boys' sailor caps--everything that nobody wanted, did the women turn over and over, till they chanced on a find. And James' quick eyes watched the slow surge of his flotsam, as the pot boiled but did not boil away. Wonderful that he did not think of the days when these bits and bobs were new treasures. But he did not.|$|E
