5|$|All {{three letters}} of John were likely written {{within a few}} years of each other, and {{internal}} evidence indicates that they were written after the Gospel of John, placing them {{in the second half of}} the first century. This dating makes sense given their allusions and opposition to Gnostic and docetic teaching, which denied the full humanity <b>of</b> <b>Jesus,</b> <b>and</b> which was gaining ascendancy at the end of the first century.|$|E
5|$|In Catholicism, {{there has}} been a long {{tradition}} of veneration of the heart, stemming from worship of the wounds of Jesus Christ which gained prominence from the mid sixteenth century. This tradition influenced the development of the medieval Christian devotion to the Sacred Heart <b>of</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>and</b> the parallel worship of Immaculate Heart of Mary, made popular by John Eudes.|$|E

5|$|Bachelot {{was born}} in Saint-Cyr-la-Rosière, Orne, France on February 22, 1796. In 1806, he left home for Paris, where he {{enrolled}} in the Preparatory Seminary of Picpus to pursue priesthood. In 1813, he professed at the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts <b>of</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>and</b> Mary, taking the name Alexis. He studied at the Irish College in Paris before being ordained as a priest in 1820. As a priest, he initially served as the College's rector and later led the preparatory seminary at Tours.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} half of Crusader reign in Nablus, Muslim forces {{launched}} incursions to regain control of the city. In 1137, Arab and Turkish troops stationed in Damascus raided Nablus, killing many Christians and burning down the city's churches. However, they were unsuccessful in retaking the city. Queen Melisende of Jerusalem resided in Nablus from 1150 to 1161, after she was granted control over the city in order to resolve a dispute with her son Baldwin III. Crusaders began building Christian institutions in Nablus, including a church dedicated to the Passion and Resurrection <b>of</b> <b>Jesus,</b> <b>and</b> in 1170 they erected a hospice for pilgrims.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1820s, Jean Baptiste Rives, a French {{adviser to the}} Hawaiian king KamehamehaII, {{traveled}} to Europe to attempt to convince European Catholics to organize a mission to Hawaii. Members of the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts <b>of</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>and</b> Mary were receptive to his idea, and in 1825, Pope LeoXII assigned them the task of evangelizing Hawaii. Bachelot was appointed the Prefect Apostolic of the Sandwich Islands, and in this role led the first permanent mission to Hawaii.|$|E

5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the completion of Astronomia Nova, most of Kepler's research was focused on preparations for the Rudolphine Tables and a comprehensive set of ephemerides (specific predictions of planet and star positions) based on the table (though neither would be completed for many years). He also attempted (unsuccessfully) to begin a collaboration with Italian astronomer Giovanni Antonio Magini. Some of his other work dealt with chronology, especially the dating {{of events in the}} life <b>of</b> <b>Jesus,</b> <b>and</b> with astrology, especially criticism of dramatic predictions of catastrophe such as those of Helisaeus Roeslin.|$|E
5|$|Matthew and Luke each {{describe}} Jesus' nativity (or birth), {{especially that}} Jesus was born by a virgin Mary in Bethlehem in fulfillment of prophecy. Luke's account emphasizes events {{before the birth}} <b>of</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>and</b> centers on Mary, while Matthew's mostly covers those after the birth and centers on Joseph. Both accounts state that Jesus was born to Joseph and Mary, his betrothed, in Bethlehem, and both support {{the doctrine of the}} virgin birth of Jesus, according to which Jesus was miraculously conceived by the Holy Spirit in Mary's womb when she was still a virgin.|$|E
5|$|Monte Testaccio {{also had}} a {{religious}} significance; it was formerly used on Good Friday to represent the hill of Golgotha in Jerusalem, when the Pope would lead a procession to the summit and placed crosses to represent those <b>of</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>and</b> the two thieves crucified alongside him. Monte Testaccio is still crowned with a cross in commemoration of the event. It was not until after World War II that {{the area around the}} hill was redeveloped as a working class neighbourhood.|$|E

5|$|The four {{canonical}} gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John) are {{the foremost}} {{sources for the}} life and message of Jesus. However, {{other parts of the}} New Testament also include references to key episodes in his life, such as the Last Supper in 1 Corinthians 11:23. Acts of the Apostles (Acts 10:37–38 and Acts 19) refers to the early ministry <b>of</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>and</b> its anticipation by John the Baptist. Acts 1:1–11 says more about the Ascension of Jesus (also mentioned in 1 Timothy 3:16) than the canonical gospels do. In the undisputed Pauline letters, which were written earlier than the gospels, the words or instructions of Jesus are cited several times (1 Corinthians 7:10–11, 9:14, 11:23–25, 2 Corinthians 12:9).|$|E
5|$|Typical of Bacon's work, Fragment of a Crucifixion {{is drawn}} {{from a wide variety}} of sources, {{including}} the screaming mouth of a nurse in Sergei Eisenstein's 1925 film Battleship Potemkin, and iconography from both the Crucifixion <b>of</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>and</b> the descent from the cross. The chimera's despair forms the centrepiece of the work, and in its agony can be compared to Bacon's later works focusing on the motif of an open mouth.|$|E
5|$|At {{this point}} Tom Loker {{returns to the}} story. Loker has changed {{as the result of}} being healed by the Quakers. George, Eliza, and Harry have also {{obtained}} their freedom after crossing into Canada. In Louisiana, Uncle Tom almost succumbs to hopelessness as his faith in God is tested by the hardships of the plantation. However, he has two visions, one <b>of</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>and</b> one of Eva, which renew his resolve to remain a faithful Christian, even unto death. He encourages Cassy to escape, which she does, taking Emmeline with her. When Tom refuses to tell Legree where Cassy and Emmeline have gone, Legree orders his overseers to kill Tom. As Tom is dying, he forgives the overseers who savagely beat him. Humbled by the character of the man they have killed, both men become Christians. Very shortly before Tom's death, George Shelby (Arthur Shelby's son) arrives to buy Tom's freedom but finds he is too late.|$|E

5|$|Biblical {{scenes and}} figures {{depicted}} in the Church of the Holy Mother of God include the worshiping of the Christ child as the eucharistic victim (the Melismos) in {{the lower part of}} the apse, the raising of Lazarus, the Annunciation, Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem, Judas Iscariot's betrayal of Jesus, the Passion of the Christ in the upper part of the cella, the Descent from the Cross, the mourning <b>of</b> <b>Jesus,</b> <b>and</b> the Dormition of the Theotokos on the west wall. The north and south walls of the cella, as well as the wall piers, bear frescoes of saints, including rare images of military saints on horseback. Murals of Saint Petka and Saint Nicholas were painted in the upper reaches of the narthex, in the south and the north tower respectively.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the Enlightenment, {{the gospels}} were usually {{regarded}} as accurate historical accounts, {{but since then}} scholars have emerged who question {{the reliability of the}} gospels and draw a distinction between the Jesus described in the gospels and the Jesus of history. Since the 18th century, three separate scholarly quests for the historical Jesus have taken place, each with distinct characteristics and based on different research criteria, which were often developed during the quest that applied them. While there is widespread scholarly agreement on the existence <b>of</b> <b>Jesus,</b> <b>and</b> a basic consensus on the general outline of his life, the portraits of Jesus constructed by various scholars often differ from each other, and from the image portrayed in the gospel accounts.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scholars}} have specifically compared baptism with the Isiac initiation described by Apuleius. Before the early fourth century CE, baptism was {{the culmination of}} a long process, in which the convert to Christianity fasted for the forty days of Lent before being immersed at Easter in a cistern or natural body of water. Like the mysteries of Isis, then, early Christian baptism involved a days-long fast and a washing ritual. Both fasting and washing were common types of ritual purification found in the religions of the Mediterranean, and Christian baptism was specifically derived from the baptism <b>of</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>and</b> Jewish immersion rituals. Therefore, according to Hugh Bowden, these similarities come from the shared religious background of Christianity and the Isis cult, not from the influence of one tradition upon the other.|$|E
