Richard Prum's activation-inhibition models, developed from Turing's work, use six variables {{to account for the}} observed range of nine basic within-feather pigmentation patterns, from the simplest, a central pigment patch, via concentric patches, bars, chevrons, eye spot, pair of central spots, rows of paired spots and an array <b>of</b> <b>dots.</b> More elaborate models simulate complex feather patterns in the guineafowl Numida meleagris in which the individual feathers feature transitions from bars at the base to an array <b>of</b> <b>dots</b> at the far (distal) end. These require an oscillation created by two inhibiting signals, with interactions in both space and time.|$|E

The machine had 26 initially, increasing to 30 when the function codes to programmatically control the data transfer between the magnetic drum and the cathode ray tube (CRT) main store were added. On the Intermediary Version programs were input by key switches, and the output was displayed as a series <b>of</b> <b>dots</b> and dashes on a cathode ray tube known as the output device, just as on the SSEM from which the Mark 1 had been developed. However, the Final Specification machine, completed in October 1949, benefitted from {{the addition of a}} teleprinter with a 5-hole paper-tape reader and punch.|$|E
40|$|Disruptor of {{telomeric}} silencing 1 -like (Dot 1 l) is a histone 3 lysine 79 methyltransferase. Studies <b>of</b> constitutive <b>Dot</b> 1 l knockout mice {{show that}} Dot 1 l {{is essential for}} embryonic development and prenatal hematopoiesis. Dot 1 l also interacts with fusion partners of Mixed Lineage Leukemia (MLL) gene, which is commonly translocated in human leukemia. However, the requirement <b>of</b> <b>Dot</b> 1 l in postnatal hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis of MLL translocation proteins have not been conclusively shown. With conditional Dot 1 l knockout mouse model, we examined the consequences <b>of</b> <b>Dot</b> 1 l loss in postnatal hematopoiesis and MLL translocation leukemia. Deletion <b>of</b> <b>Dot</b> 1 l led to pancytopenia and failure of hematopoietic homeostasis, and Dot 1 l-deficient cells minimally reconstituted recipient bone marrow in competitive transplantation experiments. In addition, MLL-AF 9 cells required Dot 1 l for oncogenic transformation, while cells with other leukemic oncogenes such as Hoxa 9 /Meis 1 and E 2 A-HLF did not. Furthermore, both histone methyltransferase activity <b>of</b> <b>Dot</b> 1 l and interaction with MLL fusion partner are required for transformation by MLL-AF 9. In addition, loss <b>of</b> <b>Dot</b> 1 l affected histone modification at select loci instead of leading to global changes. These findings illustrate a crucial role <b>of</b> <b>Dot</b> 1 l in normal hematopoiesis, leukemogenesis of specific oncogenes, and histone cross-talk...|$|R

5|$|Turkey Tolson's {{painting}} style {{developed in}} two broad phases. His early work was classical, tightly controlled {{and with a}} strong sense of symmetry characterising the geometrical arrangement of symbols and the patterns <b>of</b> <b>dots</b> surrounding them. Works from the mid-1970s, painted at Papunya, show this iconography. They include Dreaming at Kamparrarrpa (Kampurarrpa) (1976), Kampurrarrpa (Kampurarrpa) (1976) Two Women Mythology at Putja Rockhole (1977), and Tjunyinkya (1977), all held by the National Museum of Australia, and all painted in synthetic polymer paint. Turkey Tolson collaborated with Johnny Scobie Tjapanangka, a fellow Papunya artist, in creating the last of the works.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Methylation of histone H 3 lysine 79 (H 3 K 79) by Dot 1 {{is highly}} conserved among species {{and has been}} {{associated}} with both gene repression and activation. To eliminate indirect effects and examine the direct consequences <b>of</b> <b>Dot</b> 1 binding and H 3 K 79 methylation, we investigated the effects <b>of</b> targeting <b>Dot</b> 1 to different positions in the yeast genome. Results Targeting Dot 1 did not activate transcription at a euchromatic locus. However, chromatin-bound Dot 1 derepressed heterochromatin-mediated gene silencing over a considerable distance. Unexpectedly, Dot 1 -mediated derepression was established by both a H 3 K 79 methylation-dependent and a methylation-independent mechanism; the latter required the histone acetyltransferase Gcn 5. By monitoring the localization of a fluorescently tagged telomere in living cells, we found that the targeting <b>of</b> <b>Dot</b> 1, but not its methylation activity, led to the release of a telomere from the repressive environment at the nuclear periphery. This probably contributes to the activity-independent derepression effect <b>of</b> <b>Dot</b> 1. Conclusions Targeting <b>of</b> <b>Dot</b> 1 promoted gene expression by antagonizing gene repression through both histone methylation and chromatin relocalization. Our findings show that binding <b>of</b> <b>Dot</b> 1 to chromatin can positively affect local gene expression by chromatin rearrangements over a considerable distance. </p...|$|R

25|$|In {{handwritten}} text, {{the actual}} {{form of the}} extra marking may vary from a pair <b>of</b> <b>dots</b> {{to a pair of}} short vertical bars, to a single horizontal bar, or to a wavy line resembling a tilde. In practice, almost any diacritic situated above the base glyph (for example, Ã¡ Ä Ã£) would probably be interpreted as a carelessly written pair <b>of</b> <b>dots</b> (Ã¤). However, in computerized character sets, these alternatives are incorrect. The front-vowel counterpart of u using the glyph y rather than Ã¼ is carried over from Swedish, and additionally avoids confusion in cursive script with ii, which is common in Finnish.|$|E

25|$|In the 7th century, {{probably}} {{in the early years}} of Islam while writing down the Qur'an, scribes realized that working out which of the ambiguous letters a particular letter was from context was laborious and not always possible, so a proper remedy was required. Writings in the Nabataean and Syriac alphabets already had sporadic examples <b>of</b> <b>dots</b> being used to distinguish letters which had become identical, for example as in the table on the right. By analogy with this, a system <b>of</b> <b>dots</b> was added to the Arabic alphabet to make enough different letters for Classical Arabic's 28 phonemes. Sometimes the resulting new letters were put in alphabetical order after their un-dotted originals, and sometimes at the end.|$|E
