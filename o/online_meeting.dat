He helps spot Zero posing as one of the coma patients in his care. The Doctor directs Amy and Rory to the hospital, while he gate-crashes an <b>online</b> <b>meeting</b> of experts discussing the Atraxi warning to give them instructions. Amy and Rory corner Zero at the hospital, and the Doctor arrives as the experts execute his plan, broadcasting [...] "zero" [...] to the Atraxi along with the photos of the coma patients from Rory's phone, revealing Zero's identity. Zero shows it has one more form, knocking out Amy and taking the form of Amelia. The Doctor speaks to Amy's subconscious to force Zero to take its native form, allowing the Atraxi to recapture it. Zero warns the Doctor as it is taken away [...] "silence will fall". As the Atraxi leave Earth, the Doctor sternly cautions them that he is Earth's protector and not to threaten the planet again.|$|E

[...] Seven reporters sent out and tracked 565 open record requests for public information from 113 entities. [...] They asked for public information that was clearly allowed by law. [...] They also tested government websites {{to see if they}} were user-friendly for citizen inspection. [...] Grades ranged from A to F. [...] Princeton was among only three cities which earned an F. [...] By contrast, twenty-four neighboring cities earned an A. [...] If a government did poorly on this survey, it is a cause for citizen concern, because responding to open records requests is a basic function of government. [...] Cities were graded according to their responses. [...] The City of [...] "Princeton was among the worst in the Transparency 2015 ratings.

[...] Community leaders would be charged a reduced rate per month for their accounts, and would no longer be given unlimited access without invoice. [...] During this live announcement via an <b>online</b> <b>meeting</b> of all community leaders in a virtual arena, Brian Williams of Dallas led many community leaders in a virtual [...] "strike" [...] or [...] "sit-in" [...] to protest the new charges the community leaders were now being asked to pay. [...] This protest or strike is noted as {{the first of its kind}} for an online environment and was nicknamed for the row of the arena it was held in: Row 800. [...] Following the protest, AOL terminated the online working relationship between itself and several of the Community Leaders involved. [...] Quickly following the release of these community leaders, each was reinstated, with the [...] exception of Williams, due to his role in the protest. [...] During this time, Williams' role on AOL was that of Guide XNT (Guide Program), CB Naked (Crystal Ball forum), VnV Naked (iVillage's Vices and Virtues Forum) and JCommBrian (Jewish Community Online Forum).|$|E

However translations can sometimes be inaccurate or they can miss {{the context of the}} discussion. This is for instance the case in corporate environments where some words are used with special meanings that can be obscure to other people.

Our system uses various techniques to split conversations in various semantically coherent segments and label them with relevant keyphrases. This is how we extract a description of the context of a sentence and we use this context to: (i) weight users 2 ̆ 7 expertise and their translation (e. g., an AI specialist is more likely than a lay person to give a correct translation for a sentence about deep learning) (ii) map the various translations of words and phrases and their context, so that we can use them during <b>online</b> <b>meetings...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Online</b> {{moderation}} <b>meetings</b> {{have the}} potential to support the collaborative professional development of teachers, and the formation of a common understanding of what denotes quality in student work in a standards based assessment system. In doing so systemic calls for consistency across education systems are also being met. In this paper a case for employing <b>online</b> moderation <b>meetings</b> is developed through recourse to the demands of learning in the twenty-first century and the place of assessment within those discourses. It is argued that empirical data is needed on the efficacy of <b>online</b> moderation <b>meetings</b> to guide future practice as the use of information and communication technologies increases in education systems. Online moderation is one way of gathering teachers across vast distances to share their understandings and develop common meanings of assessment. While it is suggested that online moderation is one possible procedure to meet systemic requirements and support teachers’ professional collaboration, the implementation of such a system also introduces new challenges for schools and teachers. <b>Meeting</b> <b>online</b> to discuss professional understandings is a new way of operating for teachers and involves technology that has not yet been fully utilised within education departments. Issues such as the types of interactions that are afforded within such an environment, as well as technical operating problems that occur when using technology impact on the employment of <b>online</b> <b>meetings.</b> <b>Online</b> moderation <b>meetings</b> while potentially solving the issue of developing common understandings across an entire department also pose new issues to be resolved. There is a need for research into the efficacy of <b>online</b> moderation <b>meetings</b> so that future policy decisions may be based on sound empirical data. It is imperative that as new ways of knowing and acting are incorporated into school curriculum and pedagogy, assessment practices are also aligned. <b>Online</b> moderation <b>meetings</b> can support such practices by enabling teachers to communicate with a wider and more diverse group of teachers to establish common understandings...|$|R
