Although girls and boys appear on the wine jugs connected with the early-spring festival of the Anthesteria, depictions of boys are far more common.|$|E

Another common law crime still used is Hamesuken, which covers forced entry into a building where a serious assault on the occupant takes place.

25|$|Given {{an overall}} design, {{a good choice}} of {{efficient}} algorithms and data structures, and efficient implementation of these algorithms and data structures comes next. After design, the choice of algorithms and data structures affects efficiency more than any <b>other</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> the program. Generally data structures {{are more difficult to}} change than algorithms, as a data structure assumption and its performance assumptions are used throughout the program, though this can be minimized by the use of abstract data types in function definitions, and keeping the concrete data structure definitions restricted to a few places.|$|E
25|$|The {{decision}} to allow this type of performance was a very unusual one for the city's government to make, as all other regions had instituted very restrictive laws regarding the musical performance of slaves, and even New Orleans had legislation that eliminated essentially every <b>other</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> the African culture. Nevertheless, the former Africans were able to play their traditional music, which started to intermingle {{with the sounds of}} the many other cultures in New Orleans at the time: Haitian, European, Cuban, and American, as well as many other smaller denominations. However, the people playing in Congo Square were not of the younger generation, the one traditionally associated with innovation and new attitudes toward mixing culture, but older musicians.|$|E
25|$|The simple {{observation}} that cells {{of a given}} type are similar in size, {{and the question of}} how this similarity is maintained, has long fascinated cell biologists. The study of cell size control in budding yeast began in earnest in the mid 1970s, when the regulation of the budding yeast cell cycle was first being elucidated by Lee Hartwell and colleagues. Seminal work in 1977 found that yeast cells maintain a constant size by delaying their entry into the cell cycle (as assayed by budding) until they have grown to a threshold size. Later worked refined this result to show that Start specifically, rather than some <b>other</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> the G1-S transition, is controlled by the size threshold.|$|E

25|$|The most {{important}} aspect of treatment is improving denture hygiene, i.e. removing the denture at night, cleaning and disinfecting it, and storing it overnight in an antiseptic solution. This is important as the denture is usually infected with C. albicans which will cause re-infection if it is not removed. Substances which are used include solutions of alkaline peroxides, alkaline hypochlorites (e.g. hypochlorite, which may over time corrode metal components of dental appliances), acids (e.g. benzoic acid), yeast lytic enzymes and proteolytic enzymes (e.g. alcalase protease). The <b>other</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> treatment involves resolution of the mucosal infection, for which topical antifungal medications are used (e.g. nystatin, amphotericin, miconazole, fluconazole or itraconazole). Often an antimicrobial mouthwash such as chlorhexidine is concurrently prescribed. Possible underlying disease (diabetes, HIV) should be treated where possible.|$|E
25|$|The taboos (Tanacross injih, Upper Tanana įhjih) are animistic forbidden. In {{addition}} to adhering to {{a code of}} behavior, people observed a variety of taboos designed to prevent misfortune or bad luck. Many of these taboos were associated with hunting or some <b>other</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> the food gathering process, thus underscoring {{the importance of these}} activities for survival of the group. Ravens, cranes, wolverines, foxes, otters, and dogs must never be eaten. The heads of caribou, moose, and Dall sheep may not be fed to the dogs; to do so would bring the hunter poor luck. Neither the bones nor the carcasses of fur-bearing animals may be fed to dogs, but must be cached in a safe place. Should the dogs get them tha hunter will take no more fur. Women of child-bearing age did not eat bear (Grizzly or Alaskan brown bear and black bear). Young boys could not eat fat from around an animal's eye until adulthood. No animals except dogs could be brought up as pets.|$|E
25|$|Poverty {{has been}} also {{considered}} a real social phenomenon reflecting more {{the consequences of}} a lack of income than the lack of income per se (Ferragina et al. 2016). According to Townsend: humans are social animals entangled in a web of relationships, which exert complex and changing pressures, as much in their consumption of goods and services as in any <b>other</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> their behaviour (Townsend 1979). This idea has received theoretical support from scholars and extensive testimony from people experiencing poverty across the globe (Walker 2014). Participation and consumption have become ever more crucial mechanisms through which people establish and communicate their identity and position in society, increasing the premium attached to resources needed to participate (Giddens 1991). In addition, the concept of social exclusion has been added to the lexicon of poverty related terms, describing the process by which people, especially those on low incomes, can become socially and politically detached from mainstream society and its associated resources and opportunities (Cantillon 1997). Equally western society have become more complex with ethnic diversity, multi-culturalism and life-style choices raising the possibility that a single concept of poverty as conceived in the past might no longer apply (Ferragina et al. 2016).|$|E

500|$|The self-titled debut album, Audioslave, was {{released}} on November 19, 2002, and entered the Billboard 200 chart at No.7 after selling 162,000 copies in its first week. It was certified gold by the RIAA within a month of release, and by 2006 achieved triple platinum status. It is the most successful Audioslave album to date, having sold {{more than three million}} copies in the United States alone. Despite its commercial success, Audioslave received mixed reviews. Some critics lambasted the group's effort as uninspired, and predictable. Pitchfork Media praised Cornell's voice, but criticized virtually every <b>other</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> the album, deeming the lyrics [...] "complete gibberish" [...] and Rubin's production [...] "a synthesized rock-like product that emits no heat." [...] Other critics, however, praised the supergroup's style reminiscent of 1970s rock and compared it to Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath, saying they added much-needed sound and style to contemporary mainstream rock.|$|E
500|$|No <b>other</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> Mallory's {{tenure as}} Secretary of the Navy {{is better known}} than his {{advocacy}} of armored vessels. He argued that the Confederacy could never produce enough ships {{to compete with the}} industrial Union on a ship-by-ship basis. As he saw it, the South should build a few ships that were individually so far superior to their opponents as to dominate. In his words, [...] "The perfection of a warship would doubtless be a combination of the greatest known ocean speed with the greatest known floating battery and power of resistance." [...] He hoped that armored warships would prove to be the [...] "ultimate weapon." [...] He did not anticipate that his opponents would also produce armored vessels, which rapidly became important parts of both navies. Furthermore, other navies, notably Great Britain and France, stepped up the conversions of their own fleets from wood to iron. Certainly the change was under way even before the Civil War broke out; his legacy consists in forcing the change to be made sooner than would otherwise have been done.|$|E

Parkin stated that the quests [...] "can seem trivial under {{the eye of the}} apocalyptic clock". VanOrd commented that while many quests were [...] "absorbing on their own", he admired their ability to get the player out into the world. Destructoid's Dale North felt that the time limit made the quests [...] "a waste of the precious time left". The time limit itself received mixed reviews. Sliva said the time limit gave the game [...] "a sense of urgency... that I really enjoy.", while VanOrd said the limit worked against the player and [...] "collides with almost every <b>other</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> the game." [...] Juba enjoyed planning out his days, but on the other had felt that the time limit prevented exploration, and that it [...] "severely [...] your ability to fully dive into some of the systems." [...] Elliot said the limit overly pressured him, and became unpleasant when coupled with the time penalty for fleeing battle. The Famitsu reviewers said that the time limit was not an overly stressful factor.|$|E
