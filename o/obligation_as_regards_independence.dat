This case study {{focuses on a}} rural semi-state organisation with a statutory <b>obligation</b> <b>as</b> <b>regards</b> the economic, {{social and cultural development}} of a particular geographical area.

40|$|AbstractWhile {{medicine}} is {{in a fairly}} constant state of change, {{the same could be}} said about the organisation and provision of healthcare, which can lead to conflicting <b>obligations</b> <b>as</b> <b>regard</b> ethics, professionalism and the standards to which clinicians are generally held to account. Additional complexity arises if there is confusion as to what these two domains comprise, and while there is plenty of literature on ethics and professionalism in medicine, much less has been written about the relationship between them. A lay observer could be forgiven for having little sense of where one ends and the other begins. It is also possible that few practicing professionals have pondered specifically on these issues, and not only should it help educators (whose task it is to design, implement and assess programmes and curricula) to have greater clarity on these issues, but it could potentially be of benefit to patients as well. Ethics and professionalism are not the same, even though they are closely connected. If ethics and professionalism are to become part of the DNA of practicing clinicians, it should be clear to everyone of what the domains comprise, and what the terminology means. This could make a difference in how doctors behave towards each other, and more importantly, towards their patients; attitudes define behaviours, which in turn influence the way in which individual episodes of care are given, so this is far more than simply a question of semantics...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{deals with}} the meaning of {{independence}} {{in the context of}} EU agencies and the relationship with control and accountability mechanisms. The analysis highlights that agencies’ dependence very much depends on the specific context in which they operate and legal requirements placed on agencies.

It pointsto the problems <b>as</b> <b>regards</b> the <b>independence</b> of agencies, particularly in relation to political, Member State and market influence, and agencies’ accountability. It emphasizes the need to develop a general legal concept of independence to safeguard the independence of agencies from industry, political and national interest, taking account of and accommodating the diversity of agency designs and tasks and recognizing the composite executive power at EU level...|$|R
40|$|This thesis aims {{to examine}} the complex {{relationship}} between Sharia law and the Saudi Arabian copyright law. It focuses on {{the implications of the}} inconsistencies between the law governing intellectual property rights imposed by the TRIPs agreement and Sharia law in Saudi Arabia, specifically <b>as</b> <b>regards</b> copyright law. Original sources from the different schools within Sharia law are analysed in depth to assess their perspectives on conceptions of property, ownership, selling, punishment, grievances, legislation, the role of the judiciary, theft, piracy and how laws should apply to individual countries and <b>obligations</b> <b>as</b> <b>regards</b> international treaties. The compatibility between Sharia approaches to these topics and the TRIPs derived laws protecting copyright in Saudi Arabia is compared to reveal significant inconsistencies. The thesis argues that unique difficulties arise in applying TRIPs related laws in Saudi Arabia, where Sharia law is theoretically the sole source of law. TRIPs related laws which are almost identical in many areas to those in Saudi Arabia apply in Lebanon and Jordan, where, as the thesis shows, these difficulties do not arise as Sharia law is only one out of several sources of law. Thus the demonstration of the inconsistencies between Sharia and TRIPs imposed laws in Saudi Arabia provides a basis from which to demonstrate and explore the unique difficulties associated with applying piracy enforcement measures in Saudi Arabia which arise from these disparities. Questionnaires were handed out to different segments of the Saudi Arabian society addressing public perceptions of the adequacy and appropriateness of both Sharia and TRIPs related laws governing copyright in hindering piracy and whether having both laws could incur a negative impact. The findings derived confirm the argument of the thesis that given the inconsistencies between them, the application of both laws leads to undesirable consequences. Some suggestions to address these issues are put forward...|$|R

Despite {{the high incidence of}} neurological and functional deficits in patients affected by brain tumours (BTs), rehabilitation treatment of this population is not as well established as it is for patients with other neurological conditions. To assess functional outcome in brain tumour inpatients who underwent early rehabilitation after surgery. 75 patients who had undergone neurosurgery for primary BTs and 75 patients affected by stroke were enrolled in a case-control study. All patients were evaluated by means of a core set of clinical scales (Functional Independence Measure, Sitting Balance score, Standing Balance score, Hauser Index, Massachusetts General Hospital Functional Ambulation Classification). Patients were evaluated before the beginning (T 0) and at the end (T 1) of rehabilitation treatment. The neurorehabilitation programme consisted of individual 60 -min sessions of treatment, administered once a day, six days a week, for four consecutive weeks. Speech therapy was included when aphasia was diagnosed. All the measures of outcome were indicative of substantial improvements for neuro-oncological and for stroke patients (P = 0. 000). Analysis of subgroups showed that patients affected by meningioma achieved better results (in efficiency terms) <b>as</b> <b>regards</b> <b>independence</b> in activities of daily living (P = 0. 02) and mobility (P = 0. 04) compared with patients affected by glioblastoma or stroke.

40|$|This is {{the final}} version of the article. It first {{appeared}} from University of Cambridge via [URL] article contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the role of the Advocate General in the makeup of the Court of Justice of the European Union. The article measures the influence of the Advocate General on the judgments of the Court of Justice through an econometric study using a probit model with data from annulment procedures of the last twenty years (1994 – 2014). Despite the acknowledged limitations in establishing the influence of the Advocate General on the case law of the Court of Justice via a quantitative analysis, the regression models used in this article give a statistically significant measure of such influence, improving previous attempts in the literature. The findings suggest that the Court of Justice is approximately 67 per cent more likely to annul an act (or part of it) if the Advocate General advises the Court to annul than if it advises the Court to dismiss the case or declare it inadmissible. These results raise several questions <b>as</b> <b>regards</b> judicial <b>independence</b> and the relevance of the figure of the Advocate General, providing a grounded basis for future discussions and judicial reform...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} paper is to assess the degree of central bank legal {{independence}} enjoyed by the central banks of the south shore of the Mediterranean Sea, which belong to the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership and to {{shed some light on}} the macroeconomic outcomes of different degrees of independence.

40|$|In this thesis, {{the aim was}} {{to attain}} a deeper {{understanding}} according to the students meaning of learning related to their own responsibility and independence within a framework of an educa¬tional programme. An empirical study with an ethnographic approach was carried out during one term of a nursing programme that uses the PBL-approach. Based on observations, conversations, inter¬views and documents, three narratives were formulated. One describes the phases students experience in the planned curricula. Periods characterised of chaos, uncertainty and a heavy workload, alternate with periods of ‘cosmos’, optimism, curiosity and satisfaction. The second narrative is about students' learning objectives while realising that they have to make choices and decisions on their own to succeed. A dialectic driving force emerging from frustration and stimulation, chaos and cosmos, results in questions about what to learn and how to act. The third narrative describes how students handle these questions. The narratives reveal two dimensions. One concerns how the students form attitudes about the relevance of learning objectives and how they go about learning a knowledge base necessary for their future profession. The other dimension takes as its starting point the fact that students try to manage their learning situation taking into consideration the framework of the educa¬tional programme. These dimensions were further analysed using theoretical references. The first dimension was analysed from the perspective of teacher/learner control and a didactic analysis of the meaning of an educational setting. The second dimension was analysed on the basis of phenomenographic learning theory. As <b>regards</b> responsibility and <b>independence</b> {{there seems to be a}} point in abandoning the concept of self-directed learning. Instead of emphasising self, the interaction between people, the individual and the educational framework and the interaction with content, are found to be fundamental. This interaction includes communication, dialogue and active participation in all the parts of a learning situation. Based on the results of this study, I claim that the driving force in student-centred learning is the dialectic relation between frustration and stimulation, chaos and cosmos. This stimulates the students to engage in the teachers' traditional didactic ques¬tions concerning an educational programme: what are we going to study, how and why, and what are the objectives? The students' conduct <b>as</b> <b>regards</b> <b>independence,</b> vis à vis dependence, are related to a dialectic relationship between the prerequisites provided by the educational frame¬work and the students' interpretation and ability to use them. Expressions of responsibility and independence emerge as choices and decisions concerning the didactic questions, initiative, activity, search for opportunities to reflect and co-operate and self-confidence. The opposite, dependence, is characterised by strategies for “survival”. The students plan their learning situa¬tion so that the examinations and assignments can be successfully tackled, and the learning situation takes on features of a surface approach. I believe that further insights into learning in student-centred education can be found in the two dialectic relationships described above...|$|R

30|$|For Pacific people, meeting gift-giving <b>obligations</b> is <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> {{important}} for sustaining culture-based social support structures, expressing cultural identity, receiving social recognition and maintaining self-esteem; all {{considered to be}} important protective factors for Pacific peoples’ mental wellbeing (Bathgate and Pulotu-Endemann 1997). However, as noted in earlier studies, among Pacific people, traditional gift-giving is an overt expectation that can inadvertently pressure individuals who lack the financial resources to give. These people may resort to using money allocated for essentials (e.g. education or medical treatment) or borrowing from friends, family, or fringe lenders—creating financial liability and vulnerability (Anae et al. 2007; Macpherson and Macpherson 2011). Low-income families face a dilemma {{when they have to}} choose between meeting their customary obligations or their immediate family financial needs (Bathgate and Pulotu-Endemann 1997). In a study of Pacific mothers in New Zealand (N =  1376), 62 % reported gift-giving and among those mothers 59 % indicated that gift-giving commitments added to their household financial difficulties (Cowley et al. 2004). Many Pacific people aimed to fulfil gift-giving obligations ahead of their household financial <b>obligations</b> such <b>as</b> paying utility bills and purchasing food (Perese and Faleafa 2000).
