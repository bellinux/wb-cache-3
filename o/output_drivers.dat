40|$|Abstract—This article {{presents}} a power-efficient low-voltage differential signaling (LVDS) <b>output</b> <b>driver</b> circuit. The proposed approach helps {{to reduce the}} total input capacitance of the LVDS driver circuit and hence relaxes the tradeoffs in designing a low-power pre-driver stage. A slew control technique has also been introduced to reduce the impedance mismatch effect between the <b>output</b> <b>driver</b> circuit and the line. The pre-driver stage shows a total input capacitance of 50 fF and also controls the voltage swing and common-mode voltage at the input of the LVDS <b>driver</b> <b>output</b> stage. This makes the operation at low supply voltages using a conventional 0. 18 m CMOS technology feasible. The <b>output</b> <b>driver</b> circuit consumes 4. 5 mA while driving an external 100 resistor with an output voltage swing of 400 mV, achieving a normalized power dissipation of 3. 42 mW/Gbps. The area of the LVDS driver circuit is 0. 067 mm and the measured output jitter is 4. 5 ps. Measurements show that the proposed LVDS driver can be used at frequencies as high as 2. 5 Gbps where the speed will be limited by the load time constant.

After a systematic improvement, it is found that the FOD structure of adding protection circuits can effectively protect the whole-chip ESD damage, as compared with the original DUT; the values of ESD failure threshold (VESD) are increased> 57 %, which allows <b>output</b> <b>driver</b> devices more robust in the ESD immunity...|$|R
50|$|Embedded systems {{firmware}} {{is usually}} {{not considered to be}} a source of radio frequency interference. Radio emissions are often caused by harmonic frequencies of the system clock and switching currents. The pulses on these wires can have fast rise and fall times, causing their wires to act as radio transmitters. This effect is increased by badly-designed printed circuit boards. These effects are reduced by using microcontroller <b>output</b> <b>drivers</b> with slower rise times, or by turning off system components.|$|E
50|$|When {{chip select}} is asserted, the chip {{internally}} performs the access, {{and only the}} final <b>output</b> <b>drivers</b> are disabled by deasserting output enable. This can be done while the bus is in use for other purposes, and when output enable is finally asserted, the data will appear with minimal delay. A ROM or static RAM chip with an output enable line will typically list two access times: one from chip select asserted and address valid, and a second, shorter time beginning when output enable is asserted.|$|E

5000|$|Subject to some limitations, ranks can be {{accessed}} independently, although not simultaneously as the data lines are still shared between ranks on a channel. For example, the controller can send write data to one rank while it awaits read data previously selected from another rank. While the write data is consumed from the data bus, the other rank could perform read-related operations such as the activation of a row or internal transfer of the data to the <b>output</b> <b>drivers.</b> Once the CA bus is free from noise from the previous read, the DRAM can drive out the read data.

50|$|One of {{the more}} subtle {{features}} of the SYM-1 {{was the use of}} a look up table in the low memory of the 6502.

This seamlessly maintained the normal operation of the board's monitor and languages such as Synertek Systems BASIC. One of the later home/education computers that used this concept extensively was the BBC Micro produced by Acorn Computers in the UK. Some of the other computer designers of this era failed to grasp the significance of this elegant use of vectors to the software mapping of new developments in hardware.|$|E

50|$|All four {{ports in}} the AT89C51 and AT9C52 are bidirectional. Each {{consists}} of a latch (Special Function Registers P0 through P3), an output driver, and an input buffer. The <b>output</b> <b>drivers</b> of Ports 0 and 2, and the input buffers of Port 0, are used in accesses to external memory. In this application, Port 0 outputs the low byte of the external memory address, time-multiplexed with the byte being written or read. Port 2 outputs the high byte of the external memory address when the address is 16 bits wide. Otherwise the Port 2 pins continue to emit the P2 SFR content. All the Port 3 pins, and two Port 1 pins (in the AT89C52)are multifunctional. The alternate functions can only be activated if the corresponding bit latch in the port SFR contains a 1. Otherwise the port pin is stuck at 0. It has less complex feature than other microprocessor.|$|E
5000|$|This {{turns the}} {{spurious}} noise due to ground loop current into Common-mode interference while the signal is differential, {{enabling them to}} be separated at destination, by circuits having a high common-mode rejection ratio. Each signal output has a counterpart in anti-phase, so there are two signal lines, often called hot and cold, carrying equal and opposite voltages, and each input is differential, responding to the difference in potential between the hot and cold wires, not their individual voltages with respect to ground. There are special semiconductor <b>output</b> <b>drivers</b> and line receivers to enable this system to be implemented with {{a small number of}} components. These generally give better overall performance than transformers, and probably cost less, but are still relatively expensive because the silicon [...] "chips" [...] necessarily contain a number of very precisely matched resistors. This level of matching, to obtain high common mode rejection ratio, is not realistically obtainable with discrete component designs.|$|E
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, a {{software}} compiler converts the source-code listing into a microprocessor-specific object code for execution {{on the target}} microprocessor. As HDLs and programming languages borrow concepts and features from each other, the boundary between them is becoming less distinct. However, pure HDLs are unsuitable for general purpose application software development, just as general-purpose programming languages are undesirable for modeling hardware. Yet as electronic systems grow increasingly complex, and reconfigurable systems become increasingly common, there is growing desire in the industry for a single language that can perform some tasks of both hardware design and software programming. SystemC {{is an example of}} such—embedded system hardware can be modeled as non-detailed architectural blocks (black boxes with modeled signal inputs and <b>output</b> <b>drivers).</b> The target application is written in C or C++ and natively compiled for the host-development system (as opposed to targeting the embedded CPU, which requires host-simulation of the embedded CPU or an emulated CPU). The high level of abstraction of SystemC models is well suited to early architecture exploration, as architectural modifications can be easily evaluated with little concern for signal-level implementation issues. However, the threading model used in SystemC and its reliance on shared memory mean that it does not handle parallel execution or lower level models well.|$|E

40|$|The recent {{high-performance}} interfaces like DDR 2, DDR 3, USB and Serial ATA require their <b>output</b> <b>drivers</b> {{to provide}} a minimum variation of rise and fall times over Process, Voltage, and Temperature (PVT) and output load variations.
