40|$|So {{much has}} been said about Hamlet the play and Hamlet the Dane that, even for those who are only casually acquainted with the play, a {{character}} such as Horatio has practically become as familiar a name as that of the tragic Prince of Denmark himself. Concerning Horatio, Alex Newall has perhaps pointed out the obvious when he writes, " [...] . although Horatio is a minor character, {{that does not mean that}} he has minor significance" (Charney 153). The same claim may-and should-be extended to a different class of Shakespeare's minor characters who are usually less memorable than Horatio, yet who are, from the perspective of Shakespearean scholarship, of no less importance to the drama. Frequently, these characters are not given names per se. Often they are identified by the social positions they occupy within the world of the play: Servant, Messenger, Officer, Soldier, and Shipmaster, to name just a few. My thesis, however, is not concerned exclusively with this class of "nameless" characters. Similarly minor characters-Osric in Hamlet and Agrippa in Antony and Cleopatra, for example-are formally named but function in some of the same ways as servants, messengers, and the others. Therefore, this thesis explores the functions, and thus the importance, of this special class of minor characters as a whole, a class hereafter referred to as "bit characters. "Following some introductory remarks, my thesis begins with a general commentary on Shakespeare's characters, for the purpose of defining the <b>ones</b> <b>pertinent</b> <b>to</b> the discussion. The last four sections then focus on the specific ways in which bit characters function in Shakespeare's drama. Honors CollegeThesis (B. ?. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{little we}} do know of the {{physical}} conditions in gamma-ray bursters makes them conducive to the acceleration of high-energy cosmic rays, {{especially if they are}} at cosmological distances. We find that, with the observed statistics and fluxes of gamma-ray bursts, cosmological bursters may be an important source of cosmic rays in two regions of the observed spectrum: 1. At the very-high-energy end (E> 10 ^{ 19 } eV), where cosmic rays must be of extragalactic origin. 2.

40|$|Much recent {{research}} has addressed the question of cerebral asymmetry {{in the perception of}} American Sign Language (Ameslan). The question has, of course, been prompted by the traditional character-ization of the left hemisphere as specialized for language and the right for visuospatial or non-linguistic functions. Since Ameslan carries a com-plexity and regularity analogous to that of spoken languages into the visual modality, the issue has been posed as <b>one</b> <b>pertinent</b> <b>to</b> the study of cerebral specialization in general. However, since several studies have demonstrated left-hemisphere advantages for nonlinguistic forms (Bever & Chiarello, 1974; Patterson & Bradshaw, 1975) and since others have shown right-hemisphere linguistic capacities (for a review, see Searleman, 1977), the question of asymmetries in the perception of sign language is by no means clear-cut. Indeed, variability of results in this domain have been extensively documented by Poizner and Battison (in press) and Poizner, Battison, and Lane (1979), and lend force to the notion that the study of hemisphere specialization in sign is complex. Our point in this note is to compare two previous studies (Phippard, 1977; Poizner & Lane, 1979) with our own, presented here for the first time. All were conducted independently at about the same time, and are very similar in design. Yet the results are somewhat different. To facilitate discussion, we present our study first...|$|R
40|$|Surface soil {{moisture}} {{is one of}} the operational products derived from Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) data. The reliability of its estimation depends on the detection of predominantly frozen conditions of the landscape (including soil and vegetation) and the presence of wet snow, which would otherwise impede the estimation. As the robust determination of the freeze/thaw (F/T) state using exclusively scatterometer measurements on a global basis is complicated due to the myriad of different climatic and land cover conditions; we propose to support the retrieval using ERA Interim temperature data. The approach is based on a probabilistic time series model, whereby backscatter and temperature data are combined to estimate the freeze/thaw state. The method is assessed with proxy F/T states derived from modeled and in situ air and soil temperature data on a global basis. These analyses show an improved consistency compared to a previously published ASCAT F/T algorithm, with typical agreements between the external data and the results of the algorithm exceeding 80 %. The quantitative interpretation of these comparisons is, however, hampered by discrepancies between the F/T state derived from temperature data and the <b>one</b> <b>pertinent</b> <b>to</b> radar remote sensing, as the former does not account for, e. g., wet snow conditions. The inclusion of the ERA Interim temperature data can improve the accuracy of the algorithm by more than 10 percentage points in regions where freezing conditions are rare...|$|R

40|$|There are {{a number}} of {{theories}} explaining the nature of the so-called X-shaped radio sources. According to one of them, an X-shaped source is indeed a cross whose one arm is associated with a double radio source that has changed its orientation in space, while the other arm is associated with relic lobes and its position indicates the former direction of the jets. Here, I present two new arguments in favour of this conjecture. Firstly, it is obvious that shortly after the repositioning, the pair of the new lobes must be very compact. To illustrate such a possibility, I show an EVN image of the central component of a triple source J 1625 + 2712. When resolved, it appears as a compact double that is not aligned with the outer double so the whole source is indeed X-shaped. Secondly, I consider the situation when one of the arms of an X-shaped source is not intrinsically short but foreshortened by projection. I show two examples of triple sources whose central component is a blazar and the span of the lobes that straddle it amounts to more than 6 × 10 ^ 5 pc. An assumption that sources of this kind have one axis, and so the lobes are beamed in the same way the core is, would require unrealistically huge deprojected linear sizes. Therefore, I claim that core-dominated triples (CDT) like these two have two axes: the <b>one</b> <b>pertinent</b> <b>to</b> the relic lobes is not pointed towards us so they are not beamed/foreshortened, whereas the axis <b>pertinent</b> <b>to</b> the jets makes a small angle with the line of sight so that a blazar is observed. It follows that X-shaped sources must be actual crosses and they are the parent (unbeamed) population of at least some CDT blazars, particularly those with large overall sizes.

40|$|Strong situations" {{have been}} shown to {{decrease}} behavioral variability, thereby attenuating the criterion-related validity of non-ability individual differences for criteria such as job performance (Barrick&Mount, 1993; Meyer, Dalal,&Bonaccio, 2009). However, {{it has been suggested that}} individuals, based on individual differences in implicit motives, may impute discrepant psychological meaning to social stimuli like situational strength [...] a process sometimes known as differential framing (James&McIntyre, 1996). If different psychological interpretations are attached to strong situation stimuli (e. g., Meyer, Dalal,&Hermida, 2010), an interesting behavioral "double-edged sword" is possible. On the <b>one</b> hand, behaviors <b>pertinent</b> <b>to</b> "primary criteria" (i. e., criteria for which external situational influences and pressures lead to targeted behavioral homogeneity) may occur among those who would not normally engage in them. But, at the same time, behaviors <b>pertinent</b> <b>to</b> "secondary criteria" (i. e., unintended, unforeseen, and potentially reactionary behaviors and/or attitudes) might also increase for some individuals (i. e., those with certain implicit motive characteristics). In other words, high situational strength may simultaneously constrain behavioral variability in primary criteria while serving as a stimulus for differential framing, thereby expanding variability on secondary criteria. The purpose of the present dissertation was twofold: 1) to explore the degree to which situational strength is differentially framed, and 2) to ascertain how the differential framing of situational strength may lead to unintended secondary outcomes. Study 1 findings indicate that, to a partial extent, situational strength is differentially framed by individuals with different implicit motives. Study 2 findings are largely consistent with extant situational strength theory, though partially inconsistent with study predictions.

40|$|Legislation {{against the}} use of lead in {{electronics}} has been {{the driving force behind the}} use of lead-free solders, surface finishes, and component lead finishes. The major concern in using lead-free solders in the assembly and rework Chip Scale Packages (CSPs) is the relatively high temperatures that the components and the boards experience. Fine-pitch CSPs have very low standoff heights following assembly making inspection and rework of these components more difficult. <b>One</b> other concern <b>pertinent</b> <b>to</b> rework is the temperature of the neighboring components during rework. These issues, coupled with the limitations of rework equipment to handle lead-free reflow temperatures, make the task of reworking lead-free assemblies more challenging. In this research endeavor, lead-free CSPs with tin-silver and tin-silver-copper solder balls were assembled and reworked. In addition, tin-lead CSPs were assembled and reworked as a baseline for comparison. Different rework sequences, redressing and fluxing techniques were evaluated. Post-assembly and post-rework analysis was done following assembly and rework using x-ray inspection, standoff measurements and cross-section microscopy. The reworked assemblies have completed 920 cycles of 0 °C to 100 °C Air-to-Air Thermal Cycling (AATC). No instances of time-zero electrical failures were found in post-rework tests. Useful guidelines for lead-free rework of fine-pitch components and CSPs in particular were developed and are presented in this paper...|$|R

40|$|Dissertação de mest., Engenharia Eletrónica e Telecomunicações, Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia, Univ. do Algarve, 2011 Nowadays, {{the demand}} for high speed, high quality and {{diversity}} in distributed services presents a challenge for telecommunication technology. Wireless systems provide the accessibility to end-user, but are not the solution for long distance links. Currently, the ideal technology for long-range transmissions at high data rates is optical fiber. Hence, a new concept for high capacity networks emerges, with centralized services into Base Stations (BS) engineered to provide flexibility and control over the system, and to perform operations such as electrical to optical domain conversion and modulation. Such Radio-over-Fiber (RoF) networks also appear as an attractive technology because they are efficient and cost effective. Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) technology is widely used {{in a number of}} standards. For instance, it is actually the Multi-Carrier Modulation (MCM) technique applied in 802. 11 a/g/n wireless standards and in Digital Video Broadcasting-Terrestrial (DVB-T), among other prevailing systems, which makes this subject <b>one</b> particularly <b>pertinent</b> <b>to</b> study. OFDM systems are an appealing choice for waveform modulation, as they are very bandwidth efficient comparing to others MCM, and provide flexibility in data transmission rates. Additionally, an important advantage dwells in its natural robustness against severely interfering environments. In this thesis, fundamentals on OFDM technology are extensively described, and its application to wireless and optical fiber networks is introduced. The combined channel effects of these technologies on OFDM signals are investigated. In terms of performance analysis, this exposition focuses on understanding the importance of OFDM modulation parameters, and explores some OFDM signal properties. To achieve this, a simulator was implemented with Matlab to create arbitrary OFDM waveforms and emulate channel effects. This study also investigates the efficiency of OFDM technology over a real Radio Frequency (RF) system with an ideal communication channel. Finally, an experimental RoF configuration is implemented and its performance is assessed...|$|R

As a consequence, numerous studies are exploring the characteristics of these "most" resistant organisms to define an effective treatment strategy to eradicate them from root canals. By taking an ecological perspective, the main objective of this review is to present evidence {{that the nature of}} persisting endodontic infections depends not on the robustness of the organisms in the infected site, but on their capability of adapting their physiology to the new environmental conditions set by the treatment. Changes in the environment, such as an increase in pH by calcium hydroxide or the effect of antimicrobials, are capable of triggering genetic cascades that modify the physiological characteristics of bacterial cells. Surface adherence by bacteria to form biofilms {{is a good example of}} bacterial adaptation and <b>one</b> that is <b>pertinent</b> <b>to</b> endodontic infections.

40|$|The {{question}} of hemispheric lateralization of neural pro-cesses is <b>one</b> that is <b>pertinent</b> <b>to</b> {{a range of}} subdisciplines of cognitive neuroscience. Language is often assumed to be left-lateralized in the human brain, {{but there has been}} a long run-ning debate about the underlying reasons for this. We addressed this problem with fMRI by identifying the neural responses to amplitude and spectral modulations in speech and how these interact with speech intelligibility to test previous claims for hemispheric asymmetries in acoustic and linguistic processes in speech perception. We used both univariate and multivariate analyses of the data, which enabled us to both identify the net-works involved in processing these acoustic and linguistic fac-tors and to test the significance of any apparent hemispheric asymmetries. We demonstrate bilateral activation of superior temporal cortex in response to speech-derived acoustic modu-lations in the absence of intelligibility. However, in a contrast of amplitude-modulated and spectrally modulated conditions that differed only in their intelligibility (where one was partially intel-ligible and the other unintelligible), we show a left dominant pattern of activation in STS, inferior frontal cortex, and insula. Crucially, multivariate pattern analysis showed that there were significant differences between {{the left and the right}} hemi-spheres only in the processing of intelligible speech. This result shows that the left hemisphere dominance in linguistic pro-cessing does not arise because of low-level, speech-derived acoustic factors and that multivariate pattern analysis provides a method for unbiased testing of hemispheric asymmetries in processing. ...|$|R
