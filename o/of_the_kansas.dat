In fact, until 1987, this stretch of the turnpike was designated solely as the Kansas Turnpike without an Interstate number. It was only after {{a change in the}} National Maximum Speed Law, when state legislators were given the authority to raise the speed limits on rural Interstate Highways to , that this segment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kansas</b> Turnpike was given the I-335 designation so that it could fall under the new law.|$|E

5|$|The non-turnpike {{portion of}} the freeway is {{maintained}} by the Kansas Department of Transportation (KDOT). As part of this role, KDOT surveys traffic on Kansas highways in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT). In 2011, KDOT calculated that as few as 10,400 vehicles used I-470 daily along the Kansas Turnpike near the I-70 interchange {{and as many as}} 41,300 vehicles used I-470 daily between the Gage Boulevard interchange and the 29th Street interchange. The portions of I-470 that are part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kansas</b> Turnpike fall under the purview <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kansas</b> Turnpike Authority, which is responsible for operating and maintaining the Kansas Turnpike. Being part of the Interstate Highway System, the entirety of I-470 is listed on the National Highway System, a system of roads that are important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E

5|$|After being {{considered}} for the Detroit Tigers' managerial vacancy that offseason, Peckinpaugh took over as manager <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kansas</b> City Blues of the Class-AA American Association for the 1934 season. Out of professional baseball in 1935, Peckinpaugh joined Lew Fonseca on nationwide baseball tours, which involved the viewing of a movie and technical demonstrations. He applied to be manager of the Boston Bees for the 1938 season, but the job was given to Casey Stengel. Peckinpaugh returned to professional baseball as {{the manager of the}} New Orleans Pelicans of the Class-A1 Southern Association in 1939.|$|E
5|$|Despite Oklahoma's role in instigating the {{construction}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kansas</b> Turnpike, its {{plans for a}} connecting turnpike fell through. The Oklahoma Turnpike Authority (OTA) had not performed a traffic study, as KTA had, {{to prove that the}} proposed Oklahoma turnpike would be profitable. Oklahoma also suffered from a poorer credit rating than did Kansas. Additionally, by this time many states' turnpike authorities were competing in the bond markets for investor dollars. All of these issues combined made it difficult for OTA to issue bonds for its toll road. When funding had been obtained, political issues stalled the proposed toll road further.|$|E

5|$|Kansas' {{victory over}} Virginia Tech was the Jayhawks' fifth bowl victory {{and was the}} 11thbowl game in the history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kansas</b> Jayhawks {{football}} team. Because of the unexpected nature of the Jayhawks' success, some pundits proclaimed the 2008 Orange Bowl as ranking among the greatest Kansas sports victories of all time. The game paid $17million to Kansas and the Big 12 Conference and helped to boost the Kansas football team's national profile among potential recruits. In addition, the bowl appearance assisted the Kansas Athletic Department's fundraising efforts.|$|E

The {{first free}} exit on the turnpike is a diamond interchange with 110th Street at Exit 410. This interchange is located just south <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kansas</b> Speedway. Just east of here, the route intersects I-435 at Exit 411. This exit uses a cloverleaf interchange with one directional ramp and collector–distributor roads to avoid issues with traffic exiting immediately {{north of the}} turnpike.

5|$|Dick Harp was in {{the midst}} of his first season as head coach <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kansas</b> Jayhawks as the team entered the National Championship game. Kansas came into the season favored to win the {{national}} title. This was due in large part to Wilt Chamberlain joining the varsity team after finishing his freshman year on the freshman team per NCAA rules. At the beginning of the season, the Jayhawks starting line up consisted of Seniors Gene Elstun, Maurice King, John Parker, Lew Johnson, and Sophomore Chamberlain. Ron Loneski replaced Johnson's spot in the starting line up during the season. Harp began the season with a man to man defense, but later switched to a zone in order to give them an advantage in rebounding the basketball.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, toll roads were gaining in {{popularity}} {{as a mechanism}} for funding new superhighways. This trend started with the Pennsylvania Turnpike in 1940, which was mimicked by other toll roads in New York, New Jersey, several New England states, Ohio, and Colorado. In October 1951, the Highway Council <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kansas</b> Chamber of Commerce researched the possibility of integrating the state into a potential cross-country turnpike system. Eastern Kansas was also included in an interstate turnpike system stretching from Galveston, Texas to Saint Louis, Missouri, via Kansas City, that was proposed by Oklahoma governor Johnston Murray. Many firms from construction industries, {{as well as those}} concerned about the state's economic development, worked to have legislation passed to allow the turnpike to be constructed. Governor Ed Arn and Gale Moss, the State Highway Director, were two major proponents of the turnpike concept.|$|E
5|$|John McCloskey, {{the manager}} of the minor league {{baseball}} Montgomery Colts of the Class-B Southern League, heard about McGinnity's pitching. McCloskey signed McGinnity, who made his professional debut with the Colts in 1893. McCloskey habitually baited umpires during games, a trait which McGinnity learned. The league folded as a result of financial troubles related to the Panic of 1893. Jimmie Manning, manager of the Southern League franchise in Savannah, Georgia, became manager <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kansas</b> City Blues of the Class-A Western League for the 1894 season, and signed McGinnity to pitch for the Blues. Combined for Montgomery and Kansas City, McGinnity had a 21–29 win–loss record, while walking more batters than he could strikeout, and allowing more than a hit per inning pitched. According to a Western League umpire, catcher Tim Donahue tipped McGinnity's pitches to opposing batters due to a personal feud. As McGinnity continued to struggle for Kansas City, he requested his release in June.|$|E
5|$|Sherman {{spent two}} months in the {{territory}} and was the primary author of the 1,188-page report filed on conditions there when they returned in April 1856. The report explained what anti-administration members already feared: that the principle of local control was being seriously undermined by the invasion of Missourians who, while not intending to settle there, used violence to coerce the Kansans to elect pro-slavery members to the territorial legislature. The House took no action on the reports, but they were widely distributed as campaign documents. That July, Sherman proposed an amendment to an army appropriation act to bar use of federal troops to enforce the acts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kansas</b> territorial legislature, which many now viewed as an illegitimate body. The amendment narrowly passed the House, but was removed by the Senate; the House ultimately agreed to the change. In spite of this defeat, however, Sherman had achieved considerable prominence for a freshman representative.|$|E
