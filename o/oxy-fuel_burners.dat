40|$|Steel {{reheating}} is an energy-intensive process requiring uniform {{temperature distribution}} within reheating furnaces. Historically, recuperators have ben used to preheat combustion air, thereby conserving energy. More recent innovations include oxygen enrichment {{and the use}} of regenerative burners, which provide higher preheat air temperatures than recuperators. These processes have limitations such as equipment deterioration, decreasing energy efficiency over time, high maintenance costs, and increased NO{sub x} emissions with increased air preheat temperature, unless special equipment is used. Praxair, Inc., supplier of oxygen and other industrial gases to the steel industry, proposes to introduce an innovative oxy-fuel burner technology (using 100 % oxygen) to the steel reheating industry. Oxy-fuel combustion reduces or eliminates nitrogen in combustion air and substantially reduces waste heat carried out with flue gas. Based on technology currently used in the glass, hazardous waste, and aluminum industries, Praxair has developed and patented low temperature, <b>oxy-fuel</b> <b>burners</b> {{that can be used in}} high temperature industrial furnaces where temperature uniformity is critical and extremely low NO{sub x} emissions are desired. The technical goal of the project is to demonstrate the use of <b>oxy-fuel</b> <b>burners</b> in a slab reheat furnace while reducing energy consumption by 45 % and NO{sub x} emissions by 90 % within the converted furnace zones. Successful implementation of this technology also will eliminate the need to periodically replace recuperators and install NO{sub x} removal equipment...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{experimental and}} computational results of <b>oxy-fuel</b> <b>burner</b> operating on classical flame and lameless mode for {{heat release rate}} of 26 kW/m 3. The uniqueness of the burner arises from a slight asymmetric injection of oxygen at near sonic velocities. Measurements of emperature, species, total heat flux, radiative heat flux and NOx emission were carried out inside the furnace and the flow field was computationally analyzed. The flame {{studies were carried out}} for coaxial flow of oxygen and fuel jets with similar inlet velocities. This configuration results in slow mixing between fuel and oxygen and the flame is developed at distance away from the burner and the flame is bright/white in colour. In the flameless mode a slight asymmetric injection of the high velocity oxygen jet leads to a large asymmetric recirculation pattern with the recirculation ratio of 25 and the resulting flame is weak bluish in colour with little soot and acetylene formation. The classical flame in comparison is characterised by soot and acetylene formation, higher NOx and noise generation.

A general trend observed worldwide {{is an increase in}} oxygen and carbon injections. Multi-function tools for oxygen injection have become a standard for new EAFs and revamping of old EAFs. With these tools, oxygen can be injected under various parameters for: decarburisation with supersonic O 2 nozzles combined with carbon injection for foamy slag forming, in-situ post-combustion with low velocity injectors, scrap melting boosting with <b>oxy-fuel</b> <b>burners.</b> Fossil fuel energies (oxygen, carbon, natural gas) represent up to 40 % of total energy consumed in EAF, and even more in some cases.

Calculated benefits of a dynamic control compared to set-points control of oxygen injections for post-combustion optimization are presented.

40|$|The use of {{oxy-fuel}} combustion processes is of large interest for several industrial fields applications since {{it offers the}} advantages of low NOx emissions in combination with high combustion temperatures even without additional preheating.

A turn down test at a reduced load was also conducted to study the impact on flame stability and furnace performance. Experimental results include gas temperature measurements using pyrometry to infer the ignition location of the flames, flue gas composition analysis, and residence time and carbon burnout. Theoretical computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modelling studies using the Fluent 6. 2 code were made to infer mechanisms for flame ignition changes. Previous research has identified that differences in the gas compositions of air and oxy systems increase particle ignition times and reduce flame propagation velocity in laminar systems. The current study also suggests changes in jet aerodynamics, due to burner primary and secondary velocity differences (and hence the momentum flux ratio of the flows) also influence flame shape and type. For the oxy fuel retrofit considered, the higher momentum flux of the primary stream of the <b>oxy-fuel</b> <b>burner</b> causes the predicted ignition to be delayed and occur further distant from the burner nozzle, with the difference being accentuated at low load. However, the {{study was limited to}} experimental flames being all Type- 0 (low swirl with no internal recirculation), and therefore future work consider higher swirl flames (with internal recirculation) more common in industry. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|In Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) steelmaking, {{scrap metal}} is melted by using {{electric}} arc and <b>oxy-fuel</b> <b>burner</b> inside the furnace. After that the molten metal is purified by blowing oxygen supersonically into the molten metal {{which in turn}} results in splashing of liquids melt {{on the wall of}} the furnace. The splashed metal droplets cause wear of furnace wall and loss of production. Optimization of the operating condition (lance angle, lance height and flow rate) may allow less splashing and increase productivity. In the present study, air was injected on water surface in a small-scale model at different lance angles, lance heights and flow rates. Splashed liquid in the forward direction was collected and measured in each case. The forward splashing rate was found to increase with the increase of lance angle from the vertical and flow rate. But the splashing rate is not a monotonous function of lance height. Splashing rate increases with lance height up to a critical distance and after that splashing rate decreases with the increase of lance height. The shape of the cavity was carefully observed by using a video camera and it was found that the splashing was minimum when the cavity was operating in penetrating regime. The critical depth of penetration of water at different lance angle was measured at constant lance height. The critical depth of penetration was found to decrease with the lance angle. A correlation was obtained to determine the critical depth of penetration at different lance angles. Using the values of critical depth of penetration at different lance angle, the Blowing number equation can be corrected to calculate the blowing number at different lance angles. The present study shows that the Blowing number on liquid surface increases with jet angle...|$|R
40|$|This {{work has}} been a {{combined}} experimental and numerical modeling effort aimed {{to help in the}} understanding of heat transfer processes when melting aluminium. In addition a newly developed type of <b>oxy-fuel</b> <b>burner</b> was investigated. Objectives set for this project include improving energy efficiency in a typical industry furnace used today and looking at possible new technology to realize higher efficiencies than normally obtained. As a starting point a literature review was done to get an overview of furnaces and technology used in aluminium remelting and recycling. The most commonly used furnace today for aluminium melting and remelting is the reverberatory furnace which was the focus of this work as well. Understanding the interaction of parameters influencing heat transfer and quantifying how heat is transferred in the furnace are key elements to be able to optimize energy efficiency. Reverberatory furnaces are usually heated by gas burners, more specifically with cold air as oxidizer. Recent developments in burner technology using pure oxygen as oxidizer has showed some promising results and was investigated in experiments and numerical models. Melting experiments were carried out in a controlled environment in a 500 kg laboratory scale furnace as a basis for understanding the heat transfer mechanisms and quantifying radiation and convection contributions when melting aluminium. The experiments also served as a reference for a numerical 1 -dimensional heat transfer model along with more advanced 3 -dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models using a commercial software package. Phenomena as turbulent flow, combustion, convection, conduction and radiation were included in the models along with latent heat release when melting metal. The influence and impact of physical parameters on the heat transfer could be determined in the numerical models and provided a more detailed analysis of the processes in the furnace. A newly developed Low Temperature <b>Oxy-fuel</b> (LTOF) <b>burner</b> was investigated and compared to a conventional cold air-fuel burner in a pilot scale furnace. Measurements of flame and furnace temperatures, gas composition and heat fluxes were done for both burners at two different input levels. Heating experiments of aluminium samples were performed to look at the difference between the burners for aluminium heating and melting applications. 3 -dimensional CFD models were developed to determine unknown quantities such as metal emissivity and quantification of radiation and convection heat transfer. The experiments also confirmed the validity of the numerical models. Finally a full scale reverberatory industry furnace was modeled using a 3 -dimensional CFD model. The air-fuel burners currently installed in the furnace was replaced by LTOF burners in the numerical model. The performance was compared to a previously published numerical model of the same furnace using air-fuel burners for two different metal configurations in the furnace. The influence of parameters such as burner input, metal emissivity, furnace wall emissivity and a dross layer was studied. The key factor when making improvements in furnaces is understanding the fundamental heat transfer processes in existing technology. The experimental and numerical modeling work presented in this thesis has studied these phenomena and created a basis from which further investigations into furnace efficiency in aluminium remelting and recycling can be done. The performance of a new type of burner was also analyzed and explained through experiments and modeling. PhD i materialteknologiPhD in Materials Science and Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|The {{consistent}} use of coal as a {{fuel source}} for power generation {{results in the}} significant emission of greenhouse gases into the environment. Using a low-rank coal, such as Victorian brown coal, results in a much higher CO₂ emission rate. Oxy-fuel combustion is identified as the promising CO₂ abatement technology for cleaner coal combustion. With the replacement of air with the mixture of high-purity oxygen and flue gas, the overall process is nitrogen-lean and can generate a flue gas ready that is rich in CO₂ and ready for {{carbon capture and storage}} (CCS). Due to the altered ignition and combustion feature of coal under this environment, the <b>oxy-fuel</b> <b>burner</b> has to be re-designed. With the construction and testing in various pilot-scale and demonstration-scale power plant, oxy-fuel combustion has been progressively advancing in recent years. However, most of these studies were centred towards the use of black coal as the main fuel source. Therefore, Victorian brown coal (VBC) is highlighted in this thesis due to the limited knowledge for its oxy-fuel combustion. VBC also possesses distinct properties and also burns distinctively from other coal. Although coal ignition has been widely studied, the impact of alkali and alkaline earth metal (AAEM) species and moisture, which are abundant in brown coal, are scarcely reported. The AAEM species are responsible for notorious slagging and fouling in the boiler which can be subsided via the injection of fuel additives. Additionally, the recirculation of flue gas is also likely to increase the overall steam concentration in the furnace. Understand of all these impacts on VBC ignition are essential for the deployment of oxy-fuel combustion in Latrobe Valley, Victoria. The scope of this research involves both experimental and modeling studies. For the experimental aspects of this research, a bench-scale entrained flow reactor with flat flame burner is commissioned for ignition study. Using an advance in-situ non-intrusive diagnostics facility, coal ignition behavior is captured in a series of photograph to elucidate the transient phenomena occurring during the particle heat up, devolatilisation and ignition. For the modeling approach, series of mathematical equations for coal combustion are written in MATLAB, including a single-film model to quantitatively describe the contribution of the two gasification reactions on char burnout and a transient ignition model for the ignition of dense particle stream. The calculated results are validated by experimental measurements. The first part of this research involves the investigation of the effect of AAEM species on coal ignition. The Chinese lignite from Xinjiang, which is rich in AAEM species, is used for this experiment. Further to that, ignition of coal upon the addition of kaolinite and the removal of AAEM are also investigated. The injection of kaolinite has a negligible effect on coal ignition but enhances the volatile decomposition rate. With the removal of AAEM species, the demineralised coal ignites considerably slower. This delay, however, can be eliminated by increasing the oxygen concentration to 30 % in oxy-firing mode. Following that, the second distinct property in brown coal, abundant inherent moisture, is studied. Victorian brown coal with differing moisture content from 12 % to 30 % is prepared. It was later found that the coal ignition can occur although moisture in brown coal is not completely evaporated. This remaining moisture, referred to as inherent moisture, exerts influence on the subsequent devolatilisation and char combustion rate. Nonetheless, wet brown coal still ignites slightly later compared to its air-dried counterpart. An oxygen concentration of 30 % in oxy-firing was also found sufficient to compensate for the detrimental effect of the inherent moisture on coal ignition. Next, the impact of the remaining moisture is investigated during char combustion process. From a modeling approach, it has been clarified that the un-evaporated moisture in wet coal is further released with the volatiles simultaneously in the air-firing mode. On the other hand, a portion of the inherent moisture still remains even after coal devolatilisation in the oxy-firing case. This residing moisture on particle surface later triggers a char-steam gasification reaction and its contribution is quantified through the modeling study in MATLAB. Finally, this research concludes with the ignition study of dense particle stream as means to extend these results to a real pulverized coal-fired burner. Here, it is more interesting to evaluate the effect of elevated steam concentration in the flue gas rather than evaluating the effect of the inherent moisture in the raw coal. Surprisingly, a faster ignition under the steam-rich condition was revealed from this research. This is later confirmed from modeling approach that the homogenous water-gas shift reaction is influential in accelerating the ignition of the volatiles released from Victorian brown coal. In summary, this thesis has identified a number of distinct features associated with the ignition and burnout of Victorian brown coal in the oxy-fuel combustion mode. Some of these findings can be further extended to commercial software for industrial applications. This research ultimately provides a clearer picture on ignition behavior of Victorian brown coal that is essential to develop an <b>oxy-fuel</b> <b>burner...</b>|$|R
40|$|Conventional wisdom says adding {{oxygen to}} a {{combustion}} system enhances product throughput, system efficiency, and, unless special care is taken, increases NOx emissions. This increase in NOx emissions is typically due to elevated flame temperatures associated with oxygen use leading to added thermal NOx formation. Innovative low flame temperature <b>oxy-fuel</b> <b>burner</b> designs {{have been developed}} and commercialized to minimize both thermal and fuel NOx formation for gas and oil fired industrial furnaces. To be effective these systems require close to 100 % oxy-fuel combustion {{and the cost of}} oxygen is paid for by fuel savings and other benefits. For applications to coal-fired utility boilers at the current cost of oxygen, however, it is not economically feasible to use 100 % oxygen for NOx control. In spite of this conventional wisdom, Praxair and its team members, in partnership with the US Department of Energy National Energy Technology Laboratory, have developed a novel way to use oxygen to reduce NOx emissions without resorting to complete oxy-fuel conversion. In this concept oxygen is added to the combustion process to enhance operation of a low NOx combustion system. Only a small fraction of combustion air is replaced with oxygen in the process. By selectively adding oxygen to a low NOx combustion system it is possible to reduce NOx emissions from nitrogen-containing fuels, including pulverized coal, while improving combustion characteristics such as unburned carbon. A combination of experimental work and modeling was used to define how well oxygen enhanced combustion could reduce NOx emissions. The results of this work suggest that small amounts of oxygen replacement can reduce the NOx emissions as compared to the air-alone system. NOx emissions significantly below 0. 15 lbs/MMBtu were measured. Oxygen addition was also shown to reduce carbon in ash. Comparison of the costs of using oxygen for NOx control against competing technologies, such as SCR, show that this concept offers substantial savings over SCR and is an economically attractive alternative to purchasing NOx credits or installing other conventional technologies. In conjunction with the development of oxygen based low NOx technology, Praxair also worked on developing the economically enhancing oxygen transport membrane (OTM) technology which is ideally suited for integration with combustion systems to achieve further significant cost reductions and efficiency improvements. This OTM oxygen production technology is based on ceramic mixed conductor membranes that operate at high temperatures and can be operated in a pressure driven mode to separate oxygen with infinite selectivity and high flux. An OTM material was selected and characterized. OTM elements were successfully fabricated. A single tube OTM reactor was designed and assembled. Testing of dense OTM elements was conducted with promising oxygen flux results of 100 % of target flux. However, based on current natural gas prices and stand-alone air separation processes, ceramic membranes do not offer an economic advantage for this application. Under a different DOE-NETL Cooperative Agreement, Praxair is continuing to develop oxygen transport membranes for the Advanced Boiler where the economics appear more attractive...|$|R
