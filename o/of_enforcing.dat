5|$|According to {{the book}} Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho, the censors in charge <b>of</b> <b>enforcing</b> the Production Code wrangled with Hitchcock because some of them insisted they could see one of Leigh's breasts.

Each of the censors {{reversed}} their positions: those who had previously seen the breast now did not, {{and those who had}} not, now did. They passed the film after the director removed one shot that showed the buttocks of Leigh's stand-in. The board was also upset by the racy opening, so Hitchcock said that if they let him keep the shower scene he would re-shoot the opening with them on the set. Since they did not show up for the re-shoot, the opening stayed.|$|E

5|$|Conflicting Argentine and Chilean {{claims to}} Patagonia, the southernmost region in South America, had been causing {{tension between the}} two {{countries}} since the 1840s. Both countries were incapable <b>of</b> <b>enforcing</b> these claims with a seaborne force, though: in 1860, the Chileans had only five small vessels, while the Argentine Navy had no seagoing ships. These attitudes quickly changed when the circumstances warranted; when Chile joined Peru against Spain in the Chincha Islands War, the Spaniards blockaded and bombarded Valparaíso, leading the Chilean government to strengthen the navy. The Argentine government, under President Domingo Sarmiento, decided to build a navy in the 1870s to counter Brazilian naval acquisitions. Two large monitors, Los Andes and El Plata, were ordered from Laird Brothers, a British company, along with two gunboats. They were delivered in 1874 and 1875.|$|E
5|$|Lydford Castle {{does not}} seem to be {{primarily}} designed to have a military function, although in 1199 when King John succeeded to the throne he had the castle garrisoned and expensively equipped to prevent any potential unrest breaking out in the region. The castle lacked the usual military features of the time, such as external gatehouses, and its design seems to have been intended to evoke the authority of a traditional defensive fortification rather than to resist an actual attack. Instead, as well as helping to deal with the wider problems in 1195, the castle appears to have been built with the intention <b>of</b> <b>enforcing</b> the stannary and forest law in Devon. It is possible that the Crown originally intended that the castle took over the stannary law across the whole of Cornwall and Devon, although in practice its role extended only to governing the Devon stannaries.|$|E
5|$|The {{inquiry and}} {{subsequent}} compensation cases found that Rangers had been inept in their administration and complacent after the {{incidents in the}} 1960s.

This had been first recommended nearly 50 years earlier, after the 1923 FA Cup Final. The Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds was published in 1973, and legislation was enacted with the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975. This law cut the capacity of Ibrox to 65,000. In the short term, Rangers took the stopgap measure of installing benches in the North Stand, which was renamed the Centenary Stand.|$|E

40|$|The {{criminal}} prohibition <b>of</b> <b>enforced</b> disappearance has a {{long and}} underappreciated history, deriving from the laws of war. In this Note, I challenge {{the notion that the}} criminal prohibition <b>of</b> <b>enforced</b> disappearance is a relatively recent product of human rights law. In the conventional human rights conception, the international crime <b>of</b> <b>enforced</b> disappearance evolved out of human rights instruments and declarations created in response to disappearances perpetrated in Latin America during the 1960 s, 1970 s, and 1980 s. According to this account, the key milestones in the criminalization <b>of</b> the <b>enforced</b> disappearances are the 1992 Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, the 1994 Inter-American Convention on Forced Disappearance of Persons, and the 2006 International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. In fact, the delegations negotiating the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) were unaware of any prior precedent for the prosecution <b>of</b> <b>enforced</b> disappearance and were initially reluctant to include the offense as a crime against humanity, on par with murder, rape, and torture. This position is also articulated by Antonio Cassese, who argues that enforced disappearance was not criminal under customary international law (CIL) when the Statute of the ICC was enacted in 1998, but was rather a new crime representing 2 ̆ 2 a nascent rule, evolved primarily out of treaty law. 2 ̆...|$|R
