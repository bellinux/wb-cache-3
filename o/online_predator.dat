50|$|An <b>online</b> <b>predator</b> is an Internet user who {{exploits}} other users' vulnerability, {{often for}} sexual or financial purposes. It {{is relatively easy}} to create an online identity which is attractive to people that would not normally become involved with the predator, but fortunately there are a few means by which you can make sure that a person whom you haven't met is actually who they say they are. Many people will trust things such as the style in which someone writes, or the photographs someone has on their web page as a way to identify that person, but these can easily be forged. Long-term Internet relationships may sometimes be difficult to sufficiently understand knowing what someone's identity is actually like.|$|E

40|$|Protecting {{children}} online {{has been}} a focus of research in psychiatry and sociology for many years. However, the anonymous nature of the Internet has made finding {{a solution to the}} problem of child protection online difficult. The current study proposes going beyond the identification of an individual <b>online</b> <b>predator</b> to the recognition of predatory discourse enacted via coercion within frames of communication in the discursive system of social media. The framework proposes the application of Critical Discourse Analysis to over 500 transcripts between adult online predators and adult volunteers of the group Perverted Justice. This framework lays the foundation for further research on the topic of protecting children online. Additionally, researchers, practitioners and public policy individuals are provided a suggested method for examining discourse in social media and improve upon the tools and methods for protecting children online...|$|E
40|$|The {{aggressive}} online solicitation {{of youth}} by online sexual predators {{has been established}} as an unintended consequence of the connectedness afforded individuals through social media. Computer science research that {{has focused on the}} detection of online sexual predators is scant and absent behavioral theory. We address this gap through examining what behavioral patterns emerge regarding how online sexual predators use language inside of social media to groom youth. Through a grounded theory analysis of ninety Perverted Justice (PVJ) transcripts, of conversations between convicted online sexual predators and PVJ volunteers who posed as youth, we identified five categories of <b>online</b> <b>predator</b> behavior inside of text during victimization of children. Those categories are: assessment, enticements, cybersexploitation, control and self-preservation. The aim of the research is twofold: (a) to improve pattern recognition programming for automated detection software, and (b) to improve educational tools for youth, parents, guardians, educators, and law enforcement...|$|E
40|$|Providing a safe {{environment}} for juveniles and children in online social networks is considered as {{a major factor in}} improving public safety. Due to the prevalence of the online conversations, mitigating the undesirable effects of juvenile abuse in cyberspace has become inevitable. Using automatic ways to address this kind of crime is challenging and demands efficient and scalable data mining techniques. The problem can be casted as a combination of textual preprocessing in data/text mining and binary classification in machine learning. This thesis proposes two machine learning approaches to deal with the following two issues in the domain of <b>online</b> <b>predator</b> identification: 1) The first problem is gathering a comprehensive set of negative training samples which is unrealistic {{due to the nature of}} the problem. This problem is addressed by applying an existing method for semi-supervised anomaly detection that allows the training process based on only one class label. The method was tested on two datasets; 2) The second issue is improving the performance of current binary classification methods in terms of classification accuracy and F 1 -score. In this regard, we have customized a deep learning approach called Convolutional Neural Network to be used in this domain. Using this approach, we show that the classification performance (F 1 -score) is improved by almost 1. 7 % compared to the classification method (Support Vector Machine). Two different datasets were used in the empirical experiments: PAN- 2012 and SQ (Sûreté du Québec). The former is a large public dataset that has been used extensively in the literature and the latter is a small dataset collected from the Sûreté du Québec...|$|E

5000|$|With {{children}} {{being introduced to}} the internet at earlier and earlier ages, the organization began an Internet Safety program in 2008 to keep children educated and safe from <b>online</b> <b>predators.</b>|$|R
40|$|This project explores how the {{emergence}} of social media negatively affects the youth of our nation by putting them at risk for many online dangers, most importantly online sexual predators. Children who use social media have no regard for online safety, which puts them at an increased risk for falling victim to an <b>online</b> <b>predator.</b> Additionally, parents, teachers {{and the general public}} lack knowledge on online safety that is needed to inform and protect our youth from online predators and many other online dangers, and this lack of knowledge is a crucial piece in preventing online predators from targeting children who carelessly use social media. Online predators use the grooming process to target and seduce their victims. Once a child falls victim, the perpetrator can easily convince them to have sexual relations that are both harmful and illegal. The public continues to do nothing to make children, parents and educators aware of the current threat online predators pose. This research project examines the legal aspect on the conviction of online predators, along with parental and public solutions to limit the amount of predators roaming the Internet. As a society it is our duty to protect the youth from such dangers. At age eleven kids should be out playing with their friends not being sexually and mentally abused by online predators. If society as a whole does not try to prevent this issue it is only going to become more of a threat as technology and social media progress. By having longer conviction time, more legal resources to track predators, increased public awareness and stricter parental involvement online predators can finally be stopped.

40|$|The Internet {{presents}} a constantly evolving frontier for criminology and policing, especially {{in relation to}} online predators – paedophiles operating within the Internet for safer access to children, child pornography and networking opportunities with other online predators. The goals of this qualitative study are to undertake behavioural research – identify personality types and archetypes of online predators and compare and contrast them with behavioural profiles and other psychological research on offline paedophiles and sex offenders. It is also an endeavour to gather intelligence on the technological utilisation of online predators and conduct observational research on the social structures of <b>online</b> <b>predator</b> communities. These goals were achieved through the covert monitoring and logging of public activity within four Internet Relay Chat(rooms) (IRC) themed around child sexual abuse and which were located on the Undernet network. Five days of monitoring was conducted on these four chatrooms between Wednesday 1 to Sunday 5 April 2009; this raw data was collated and analysed. The analysis identified four personality types – the gentleman predator, the sadist, the businessman and the pretender – and eight archetypes consisting of the groomers, dealers, negotiators, roleplayers, networkers, chat requestors, posters and travellers. The characteristics and traits of these personality types and archetypes, which were extracted from the literature dealing with offline paedophiles and sex offenders, are detailed and contrasted against the online sexual predators identified within the chatrooms, revealing many similarities and interesting differences particularly with the businessman and pretender personality types. These personality types and archetypes were illustrated by selecting users who displayed the appropriate characteristics and tracking them through the four chatrooms, revealing intelligence data {{on the use of}} proxies servers – especially via the Tor software – and other security strategies such as Undernet’s host masking service. Name and age changes, which is used as a potential sexual grooming tactic was also revealed through the use of Analyst’s Notebook software and information on ISP information revealed the likelihood that many online predators were not using any safety mechanism and relying on the anonymity of the Internet. The activities of these online predators were analysed, especially in regards to child sexual grooming and the ‘posting’ of child pornography, which revealed a few of the methods in which online predators utilised new Internet technologies to sexually groom and abuse children – using technologies such as instant messengers, webcams and microphones – as well as store and disseminate illegal materials on image sharing websites and peer-to-peer software such as Gigatribe. Analysis of the social structures of the chatrooms was also carried out and the community functions and characteristics of each chatroom explored. The findings of this research have indicated several opportunities for further research. As a result of this research, recommendations are given on policy, prevention and response strategies with regards to online predators...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} about moral panics over {{contemporary}} technology, which I call ???technopanics. ??? I use two examples, the cyberporn panic of 1996 and the contemporary panic over online predators and MySpace, {{to demonstrate the}} links between media coverage and content legislation. In both cases, Internet content legislation is directly linked to media-fueled moral panics that concern uses of technology deemed harmful to children. This {{is of particular interest}} right now as an internet content bill known as the Deleting Online Predators Act, or DOPA, was debated last year in Congress, and a variant of this bill may pass in the future. DOPA would require filtering software on internet-connected computers in libraries and schools to block access to all "social software" sites, which would broadly include any website with communication features, including social networking sites, wikis, community forums, and online communities. The technopanic over ???online predators??? is remarkably similar to the cyberporn panic; both are fueled by media coverage, both rely on the idea of harm to children as the justification for internet content restriction, and both have resulted in carefully crafted legislation to circumvent First Amendment concerns. While both panics have their roots in legitimate concerns, my perspective is not that of a realist ??? I am not primarily concerned with the extent of the purported harms. However, my research demonstrates that the legislation proposed (or passed) to curb these problems is an extraordinary response; it is misguided and in many cases masks the underlying problem. The first part of this paper discusses the cyberporn panic of the mid- 1990 s and its links to internet content legislation. Second, I outline a theory of technopanics, using the moral panics literature to examine fears of technology and modernity. The third section examines the current moral panic over social networking sites and MySpace. com in particular, including the DOPA legislation proposed to solve the problem. The fourth part of this paper takes a critical look at the harms of MySpace and online predators in general. I argue that in order to justify the passage of sweeping laws restricting all minors??? access to MySpace, the problem of online predators using MySpace to elicit underage individuals for sexual activity has been portrayed as socially significant, which I do not believe to be the case. Rather, I believe that it is indicative of a small, visible number of sensationalized cases that have been used by the media to fuel a moral panic around the site. The idea of the ???<b>online</b> <b>predator???</b> is further linked to real harms, such as child abuse and child pornography, to create rhetorical significance for legislative-based action. I conclude with some recommendations for legislators, parents, and journalists. Since moral panics are, by definition, public, any study of a moral panic must attempt to access popular discourse. This paper primarily uses Congressional testimony and popular press articles, both national and local, as evidence. Congressional testimony was found by conducting full-text searches of the Congressional Record, a publication which includes every word spoken on the floor of both the House and the Senate. Popular press articles were found through Lexis-Nexis, the websites of major and local newspapers, and television network and cable news programs...|$|E
