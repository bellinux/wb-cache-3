5000|$|The {{operation}} {{ended on}} 31 October 2014 and was superseded by Frontex's <b>Operation</b> <b>Triton,</b> which operates a smaller {{search and rescue}} capability. Unlike Mare Nostrum, <b>Operation</b> <b>Triton</b> focused on border protection rather than search and rescue, and operates closer to the Italian coast The termination of Mare Nostrum has been criticized {{as a cause of}} the increased death rate among migrants to Europe in the Mediterranean, which increased tenfold between 2014 and 2015. Two major migrant shipwreck disasters which together killed more than 1000 people within the span of a week in April 2015 led to calls to renew the operation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Operation</b> <b>Triton</b> is {{a border}} {{security}} operation conducted by Frontex, the European Union's border security agency. The operation, under Italian control, began on 1 November 2014 and involves voluntary contributions from 15 other European nations (both EU member states and non-members). Current voluntary contributors to <b>Operation</b> <b>Triton</b> are Croatia, Iceland, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Germany, the Netherlands, France, Spain, Ireland, Portugal, Austria, Switzerland, Romania, Poland, Lithuania and Malta. The operation was undertaken after Italy ended Operation Mare Nostrum, {{which had become}} too costly for a single country to fund; it was costing the Italian government €9 million per month for an operation that lasted 12 months. The Italian government had requested additional funds from the other EU member states {{but they did not}} offer the requested support.|$|E

500|$|Operation Sandblast {{gathered}} extensive oceanographic, hydrographic, gravimetric, and geophysical data. [...] Water {{samples were}} taken throughout Tritons circumnavigation, which were tested {{for differences in}} chemical composition, salinity, density, and temperature. Such samples were vital for submarine operations. Water salinity and density affects submerged trim, as well as sonar performance, while warmer water affects the efficiency of shipboard condensers and, consequently, ship speed. [...] Measurements from the installed gravity meter provided a continuous record of variations in earth's gravity field throughout Tritons circumnavigation. This extensive gravity study assisted the Navy in developing navigational aids. [...] Some 144 hydrographic bottles to track ocean currents were released during <b>Operation</b> Sandblast. [...] <b>Triton</b> mapped uncharted seamounts, coral reefs, and other submerged topographic structures using its fathometer and sonar systems.

50|$|A {{major problem}} Alfano has faced, as Interior Minister, is illegal {{immigration}} to Italy, which {{emerged as a}} result of the Libyan and Syrian Civil Wars. On 8 August 2014, the Italian Cabinet approved a law-decree contrasting the phenomenon of lawlessness and violence at sporting events and provided for the international protection of migrants.

50|$|As {{a result}} of the Libyan and Syrian Civil Wars, a major problem faced by Renzi upon {{becoming}} Prime Minister in 2014 was the high levels of illegal immigration to Italy. 2014 saw {{an increase in the number}} of migrants rescued at sea being brought to southern Italian ports, with the increase in the number of migrants prompting criticism of Renzi by the anti-immigration Lega Nord, the Five Star Movement and Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia party. On 8 August 2014, the Cabinet approved a law-decree providing for the international protection of migrants.

50|$|Due to its {{location}} on the German-Austrian border, and in the south-east of the country, Passau {{has become a major}} migrant entry point into Germany. Refugees and economic migrants from the Middle East, Asia and Africa who have reached Europe, often entering either overland via Greece or across the sea via the Mediterranean (see <b>Operation</b> <b>Triton),</b> then head north and sometimes enter Germany. In 2015 the BBC reported that traffickers drive migrants and refugees through Austria and leave them {{on the side of the}} autobahn. The migrants and refugees then often walk unaccompanied into Passau, the first German town northwards. This situation has caused the government of Passau to divert funds from flood prevention to housing and feeding the refugees and migrants, around 10% of whom are unaccompanied children.|$|E

5000|$|In 2008, Berlusconi's {{government}} in Italy and Gaddafi's {{government in}} Libya signed a treaty including {{cooperation between the}} two countries in stopping irregular migration from Libya to Italy; this led to a policy of forcibly returning to Libya boat migrants intercepted by the Italian coast guard at sea. The cooperation collapsed following the outbreak of the Libyan civil war in 2011, and in 2012 the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Italy had violated the European Convention on Human Rights by returning migrants to Libya, as it exposed the migrants to the risk of being subjected to ill-treatment in Libya and violated the prohibition of collective expulsions. Since 2011, and particularly since 2014, instability and the Second Civil War in Libya have made departures from the north-African country to Italy easier, with no central authority controlling Libya's ports and dealing with European countries, and migrant smuggling networks flourishing. The war could also have forced to leave many African immigrants residing in Libya, which used to be itself a destination country for migrants looking for better jobs. The 2013 Lampedusa migrant shipwreck involved [...] "more than 360" [...] deaths, leading the Italian government to establish Operation Mare Nostrum, a large-scale naval operation that involved search and rescue, with some migrants brought aboard a naval amphibious assault ship. In 2014, the Italian government ended the operation, calling the costs too large for one EU state alone to manage; Frontex assumed the main responsibility for search and rescue operations. The Frontex operation is called <b>Operation</b> <b>Triton.</b> The Italian government had requested additional funds from the EU to continue the operation but member states did not offer the requested support. The UK government cited fears that the operation was acting as [...] "an unintended 'pull factor', encouraging more migrants to attempt the dangerous sea crossing and thereby leading to more tragic and unnecessary deaths". The operation consisted of two surveillance aircraft and three ships, with seven teams of staff who gathered intelligence and conducted screening/identification processing. Its monthly budget was estimated at €2.9 million.|$|E
30|$|Italy {{recently}} attempted {{but ultimately}} abandoned a more humane effort in managing people movements from North Africa. The Italian Operation Mare Nostrum began in October 2013 {{with the aim}} of intercepting people in distress and carrying them back to Italian reception centres (Mare Nostrum, no date). Because of its emphasis on rescuing and assisting, the operation Mare Nostrum received strong support from intergovernmental agencies such as the International Organisation for Migration but no support from other EU member states with the UK harshly criticising the operation as being a pull factor (Travis, 2014). While Italy was seeking support from the EU to continue the Operation, according to Amnesty International ‘the EU and its member states avoided any decisions which could help refugees and migrants leaving North Africa {{for as long as they}} could’ (Amnesty International, 2015, p. 34). On 27 August 2014, <b>Operation</b> <b>Triton,</b> an EU border patrol-only operation managed by Frontex, the European border agency, effectively replaced the Operation Mare Nostrum (European Commission, 2014). <b>Operation</b> <b>Triton</b> only monitors the ‘external border’ (European Commission, 2014), up to 30 nautical miles from the European coasts, and is not a rescuing migrants at sea but ‘render[s] assistance to persons in distress’ (European Commission, 2014). Centred on these points, <b>Operation</b> <b>Triton</b> was criticised as it was evident it resumed the harsher approach (“Frontex Launches Joint Operation Triton”, 2014). More recent tragedies on the Mediterranean have prompted the UN High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres to say that Triton is a ‘woefully inadequate replacement for Italy's Mare Nostrum’ (“Hundreds of Migrants”, 2015, para. 4).|$|E
