50|$|Clarke {{had some}} legal training, and Baptist {{historian}} Albert Henry Newman argued that Clarke {{was the principal}} author of the first complete code of laws that was enacted by the fledgling colony in 1647. Rhode Island historian and Lieutenant Governor Samuel G. Arnold extolled the virtues of this code, calling it broad <b>in</b> scope, vigorous, <b>original,</b> and <b>bold.</b> <b>In</b> his 1859 history of Rhode Island, Arnold wrote that the legal code of 1647 presented a model of legislation which had not, to that time, been surpassed.|$|R
40|$|This report {{contains}} a cumulative index to the Collected Algorithms of the ACM. The algorithms are classified using the modified SHARE classification, several {{different views of}} which are provided in Chapter 1. The source codes of these routines originally appeared in the Communications of the ACM and, from Algorithm 493, in the ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software. All algorithms {{up to and including}} those appearing in the December 1991 issue of TOMS are included in the index. Information on how to obtain sources of the algorithms is given in Appendix A. The references given in the index provide the <b>original</b> source <b>in</b> <b>bold</b> face followed by any published remarks or certificates. The format of each reference is journal volume:page where journal is C for CACM, T for TOMS and, in the single case of Algorithm 568, X for Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems. The index was built from a bibliographic database which is an extension to that previously provided as Algorithm 620. This extended database plus a set of Fortran 77 routines to manipulate individual items has been published as [1]. The complete submitted remark is included in this repor...|$|R
