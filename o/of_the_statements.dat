5|$|The Court {{concluded}} that the conflict of interest materialized in a few ways. First, Stewart declined to cross-examine one of the witnesses, who could implicate Kretske but not Glasser, for fear that it would strengthen the case against Kretske. Stewart also failed to object to the testimony of other witnesses regarding prior statements of Kretske; under the rules of hearsay, these statements were obviously admissible against Kretske, but less obviously admissible against Glasser without a predicate showing that Glasser was a co-conspirator. Stewart feared that an objection only on behalf of Glasser would highlight the admissibility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>statements</b> against Kretske.|$|E
5|$|Halperin {{cautioned that}} Austen often satirised popular sentimental romantic fiction in her letters, and some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>statements</b> about Lefroy {{may have been}} ironic. However, {{it is clear that}} Austen was {{genuinely}} attracted to Lefroy and subsequently none of her other suitors ever quite measured up to him. The Lefroy family intervened and sent him away at the end of January. Marriage was impractical, as both Lefroy and Austen must have known. Neither had any money, and he was dependent on a great-uncle in Ireland to finance his education and establish his legal career. If Tom Lefroy later visited Hampshire, he was carefully kept away from the Austens, and Jane Austen never saw him again. In November 1798, Lefroy was still on Austen's mind as she wrote to her sister she had tea with one of his relatives, wanted desperately to ask about him, but could not bring herself to raise the subject.|$|E

5|$|Several <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>statements</b> {{originated}} from the juveniles {{who had been}} arrested shortly after the murder. They included Jason Hill, the 13-year-old who had been held for three days in his underpants and a blanket, without access to his parents or a lawyer. (Hill received £30,000 in damages from the police over his treatment.) Hill had not been told that his statement {{was going to be}} read out in court during the detectives' trial; he first learned that it had been used when he heard it on television. Another statement was from Mark Pennant, also a juvenile who had been arrested during the first inquiry. Overall it appeared that Silcott was being retried.|$|E
5|$|While at the dentist, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) reads {{an article}} about China's growing global power, and he decides that China must be stopped before it takes over the United States. Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) tries to correct one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>{{statement}}s,</b> but when Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) checks the fact online, it turns out Michael's statement was correct. Everyone mocks Oscar for his mistake, as Oscar is usually the smartest one in the office, having built this reputation by often correcting his coworkers. Oscar invites Michael {{for a cup of}} coffee, but the other employees realize that Oscar wants to discuss China in more detail, in order to reestablish himself as the office's intellectual heavyweight. Seeing an opportunity to give Oscar a taste of his own medicine, they start quizzing Michael on different facts about China, but he cannot answer, so he makes note cards to keep track. When Michael and Oscar have their conversation, Ryan, Erin, Jim, Andy, and Kelly also sit in to watch. Michael blanks on one topic, but then changes the subject to conversation itself. The employees toast him, while Oscar is left infuriated.|$|E
5|$|While it {{was long}} thought that the Chinese had {{developed}} the blast furnace and cast iron as their first method of iron production, Donald Wagner (the author of the above referenced study) has published a more recent paper that supersedes some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>statements</b> in the earlier work; the newer paper still places {{the date of the}} first cast-iron artifacts at the 5th and 4th centuries BC, but also provides evidence of earlier bloomery furnace use, which migrated from China to Western parts and Central Asia during the beginning of the Chinese Bronze Age of the late Longshan culture (2000BC). He suggests that early blast furnace and cast iron production evolved from furnaces used to melt bronze. Certainly, though, iron was essential to military success by the time the State of Qin had unified China (221BC). Usage of the blast and cupola furnace remained widespread during the Song and Tang Dynasties. By the 11th century AD, the Song Dynasty Chinese iron industry made a remarkable switch of resources from charcoal to bituminous coal in casting iron and steel, sparing thousands of acres of woodland from felling. This may have happened as early as the 4th century AD.|$|E

In <b>the</b> first part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thesis a legislation framework <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> balances and a financial statement preparing are defined. <b>The</b> following part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thesis deals with a financial statement preparing which includes a preparation leading to finding and booking of profit and income tax.

40|$|The study {{aimed to}} explore <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> {{auditing}} <b>the</b> <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> cash flows by auditors of Jordanian public listed companies. In doing so, it used a structured questionnaire that surveyed <b>the</b> views <b>of</b> auditors who work for audit firms that audit <b>the</b> financial <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> Jordanian public listed companies. In particular, auditors were asked about <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> cash flows for their audit and their opinion on <b>the</b> financial <b>statements,</b> <b>the</b> extent <b>of</b> their auditing of detailed components <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> cash flows, and their use of specific financial ratios related to <b>the</b> <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> cash flows in predicting the company’s continuance as a going concern. Findings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study suggest that auditors of Jordanian public listed companies do generally recognize <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> cash flows and do generally audit many detailed items <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>statement</b> in its operational, investment, and financial sections, and do use financial ratios that employ cash flow measures to evaluate the company’s going concern hypothesis. However, <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> such perceived importance and use of audit procedures was reported as being relatively limited, an issue that raises questions over <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> such audits and <b>the</b> awareness <b>of</b> auditors as to <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> auditing <b>the</b> <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> cash flows. </p...|$|R

25|$|ASEAN {{has also}} failed to abolish human rights {{violations}} in West Papua, including Irian Jaya, committed by Indonesian military officials and political authorities. It is estimated that more than 500,000 indigenous Papuans {{have been killed in}} the name of Indonesian nationalism by Indonesian authorities. Native Papuans have been lobbying for independence from Indonesia since the 1900s, however, they have not succeeded due to intense Indonesian army operations which resulted in expansive genocide. Independence organizations in the western half of Papua vocalized their concerns and aspiration to ASEAN, however, no action was made by the association. In 2014, all independence movement groups in West Papua and Iriran Jaya finally formed under a single umbrella organization, the United Liberation Movement for West Papua (ULMWP). Due to the December 2016 Independence Rally in West Papua, where more than 500 native Papuans were arrested by Indonesian officials, a bloc of nations swore to support the West Papua Independence Movement in the entrance of 2017. Among these coalition of nations are Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Tonga, Tuvalu, Palau, and the Marshall Islands. The FLNKS, which represents New Caledonia Independence Movement, also supported the West Papua independence movement. The bloc of nations lambasted Indonesia's human rights record in West Papua, which includes Irian Jaya, and the referendum conducted by Indonesia to control the region, where only 0.02% of the population were allowed by Indonesia to vote in a previous referendum marred by political threats from Indonesian authorities. The ambassador of Guinea-Bissau implied that the movement is the same with the movement made by Timor-Leste, and thus should be respected. The probable support base of the African leader is due to the support of the Bishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa, who backed West Papuan independence from Indonesia. On the other hand, the ambassador of Papua New Guinea spoke against the coalition of nations due to ties with Indonesia, despite being ethnically and geographically related to West Papua. All <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>statements</b> made were committed during the 2017 meeting of Council of Ministers of the 79-member Africa Caribbean Pacific Group of States (ACP). The indigenous Maori people of New Zealand also expressed their support for West Papua during the ULMWP's visit in the country. The Aborigines of Australia also expressed their support for the movement.|$|E
