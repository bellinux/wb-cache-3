5|$|Depending {{on their}} feeding habits, {{termites}} are placed into two groups: the lower termites and higher termites. The lower termites predominately feed on wood. As wood {{is difficult to}} digest, termites prefer to consume fungus-infected wood because {{it is easier to}} digest and the fungi are high in protein. Meanwhile, the higher termites consume a wide variety of materials, including faeces, humus, grass, leaves and roots. The gut in the lower termites contains many species of bacteria along with protozoa, while the higher termites <b>only</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> species of bacteria with no protozoa.|$|E

The voting window has once again been shortened; in that viewers <b>only</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> minutes to vote for their favourite acts after all the contestants on the night have performed.|$|E

A notable exception is route #66 which runs from 5:30 am until 12:30 am weekdays and Saturdays. Commuter routes <b>only</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> run times during weekdays, usually towards Downtown Albuquerque or Kirtland AFB during the mornings and away from during the evenings. The Downtown D-Ride operates during weekdays without a fixed schedule, and departs the Alvarado Transportation Center every 7 minutes from 6:30 am to 5:33 pm.|$|E

In [...] "The Talk: Nonblack Version", Derbyshire, who had earlier been criticized by Hanson on his advocacy for racial stereotyping well beyond the context of traveling in high crime areas, went well beyond what Hanson had advocated, telling his children not to live in cities with black mayors, never to help a black person in distress, to avoid all public gatherings {{with large numbers of}} black people and <b>only</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> black people as friends to avoid allegations of prejudice. Contra Coates, Derbyshire argued in support of Hanson {{that the best way to}} avoid being a victim of crime was: [...] "..stay well clear of crowds of unfamiliar blacks.

The theatre or the rooms, where he was most likely to be, were not fashionable enough for the Elliots, whose evening amusements were solely in the elegant stupidity of private parties, {{in which they were}} getting more and more engaged; and Anne, wearied of such a state of stagnation, sick of knowing nothing, and fancying herself stronger because her strength was not tried, was quite impatient for the concert evening. It was a concert for the benefit of a person patronised by Lady Dalrymple. Of course they must attend. It was really expected to be a good one, and Captain Wentworth was very fond of music. If she could <b>only</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> minutes conversation with him again, she fancied she should be satisfied; and as to the power of addressing him, she felt all over courage if the opportunity occurred.

My poem is finished, and consists of about forty Spenser stanzas [fifty-five as published]. I shall send it to you, either printed at Pisa, or transcribed in such a manner as it shall be difficult for the reviser to leave such errors as assist the obscurity of the Prometheus.

6000|$|The {{next few}} days were devoted to {{sightseeing}} under Merton's guidance, and a better-informed cicerone they could not well have had. The little cloud between the girls had quite passed away; and Fan, who was not always abnormally drowsy after dark, listened to her friend's story and entered into all her plans. Then {{a visit to the}} National Gallery was arranged for a day when Merton would <b>only</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hours of the afternoon to spare: he was now devoting his energies to the business of climbing. At three o'clock they were to meet at Piccadilly Circus, but the girls were early on the scene, as they wished to have an hour first in Regent Street. To unaccustomed country eyes the art treasures displayed in the shop-windows there are as much to be admired as the canvases in Trafalgar Square. They passed a large drapery establishment with swinging doors standing open, and the sight of the rich interior seemed to have a fascinating effect on Fan. She lingered behind her companion, gazing wistfully in--a poor, empty-handed peri at the gates of Paradise. Long room succeeded long room, until they appeared to melt away in the dim distance; the floors were covered with a soft carpet of a dull green tint, and here and there were polished red counters, and on every side were displayed dresses and mantles artistically arranged, and textures of all kinds and in all soft beautiful colours. Within a few ladies were visible, moving about, or seated; but it was the hour of luncheon, when little shopping was done, and the young ladies of the establishment, the assistants, seemed to have little to occupy them. They were very fine-looking girls, all dressed alike in black, but their dresses were better in cut and material than shop-girls usually wear, even in the most fashionable establishments. At length Fan withdrew her longing eyes, and turned away, remarking with a sigh, [...] "Oh, how I should like to be in such a place!" ...|$|E
