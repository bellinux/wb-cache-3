5|$|Ideasthesia {{theory of}} art {{may be used}} for {{psychological}} studies <b>of</b> <b>aesthetics.</b> It may also help explain classificatory disputes about art as its main tenet is that experience of art can only be individual, depending on person's unique knowledge, experiences and history. There could exist no general classification of art satisfactorily applicable to each and all individuals.|$|E

Starting from the outlook of some famous mediators like Diderot, Walter Benjamin, Gilles Deleuze, Predrag Matvejevitch, Jean Starobinki, Milan Kundera, Octavio Paz among others, the article reflects on the evolution <b>of</b> the <b>aesthetics</b> <b>of</b> the gaze and on the different possible points of view: the synoptic gaze <b>of</b> rationalistic <b>aesthetics,</b> the close-up and therefore fragmented gaze <b>of</b> empiric <b>aesthetics</b> and finally the nomadic gaze <b>of</b> contemporary <b>aesthetics,</b> divided between panoramic and close-up view...|$|R

5|$|The {{development}} of perspective {{was part of}} a wider trend towards realism in the arts. Painters developed other techniques, studying light, shadow, and, famously in the case of Leonardo da Vinci, human anatomy. Underlying these changes in artistic method was a renewed desire to depict the beauty of nature and to unravel the axioms <b>of</b> <b>aesthetics,</b> with the works of Leonardo, Michelangelo and Raphael representing artistic pinnacles that were much imitated by other artists. Other notable artists include Sandro Botticelli, working for the Medici in Florence, Donatello, another Florentine, and Titian in Venice, among others.|$|E
5|$|Scottish {{artists in}} the later eighteenth century were {{strongly}} influenced by the Enlightenment, which stressed rationalism and human inquiry, of which Scotland was a major centre of influence. Artists like Alan Ramsey formed The Select Society, with philosophers David Hume and Adam Smith and produced his Dialogue on Taste, which made a major contribution to the study <b>of</b> <b>aesthetics.</b> Scotland also played a major part in {{the origins of the}} Romantic movement through the publication of James Macpherson's Ossian cycle, which was proclaimed as a Celtic equivalent of the Classical epics. Fingal, written in 1762, was speedily translated into many European languages, and its deep appreciation of natural beauty and the melancholy tenderness of its treatment of the ancient legend did more than any single work to bring about the Romantic movement in European, and especially in German literature, influencing Herder and Goethe.|$|E

5|$|Many {{performances}} {{deal with}} behaviors {{that occur in}} daily life. However, {{in accordance with the}} overriding principle of beauty, such behaviors are stylized to be presented on stage. Peking opera does not aim to accurately represent reality. Experts of the art form contrast the principles of Peking opera with the principle of Mo, mimes or imitation, that is found in western dramas. Peking opera should be suggestive, not imitative. The literal aspects of scenes are removed or stylized to better represent intangible emotions and characters. The most common stylization method in Peking opera is roundness. Every motion and pose is carefully manipulated to avoid sharp angles and straight lines. A character looking upon an object above them will sweep their eyes in a circular motion from low to high before landing on the object. Similarly, a character will sweep their hand in an arc from left to right in order to indicate an object on the right. This avoidance of sharp angles extends to three-dimensional movement as well; reversals of orientation often {{take the form of a}} smooth, S-shaped curve. All of these general principles <b>of</b> <b>aesthetics</b> are present within other performance elements as well.|$|E

The second pillar of the pragmatist theory <b>of</b> everyday <b>aesthetics</b> developed in this paper is formed by recent Deweyan-inspired views in pragmatist ethics on the vital role of imagination in moral life.
