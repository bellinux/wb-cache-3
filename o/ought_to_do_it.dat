6000|$|Ludlow {{assumed that}} she had said more. [...] "Then if you don't think you <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> for that, {{do you think you}} <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> for nothing?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I bain't fit for {{any such}} thing," [...] said Laban, nervously. [...] "I should think William <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> if anybody. He's oldest." ...|$|E
60|$|CLAIRE. I don't care: I don't {{think you}} <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> have <b>done</b> <b>it.</b> I am very angry and offended.|$|R
6000|$|... 'And Charlotte, too! She looks half dead. I thought Ellen was <b>to</b> <b>do</b> such work, and <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> have <b>done</b> <b>it</b> {{in proper}} time.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because--Oh, how can I say why? Why {{does any}} person do {{everything}} that she <b>ought</b> not <b>to</b> <b>do?</b> <b>It's</b> the fall of Adam, I suppose." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No--no--no--touch nothing I entreat of you, Captain Wallingford"--he said, earnestly. [...] "If {{that black}} can do it, surely I <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> too." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, Geoff, take it {{down for}} us. You <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> out of {{gratitude}} for my cheering you up so nicely," [...] said Min, leading the way.|$|E
6000|$|... 'About an {{hour after}} daylight. Yes, nearly three hours from camp. But we are going faster now than we did then. We <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> in two hours.' ...|$|E
6000|$|At {{last she}} mustered courage to say, 'I can't listen, sir. I never <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> have <b>done</b> <b>it.</b> I am promised now, and I can't.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're quite right," [...] said Mr. Carter, blandly. [...] "I'll get a {{new face}} first thing to-morrow morning. I <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> have <b>done</b> <b>it</b> before." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. I {{think we}} <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that. <b>It's</b> a lesson, perhaps--for {{trying to get}} too much beauty out of life as it is--and forgetting. Don't shirk it!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It'll {{be quite}} a bit, I'm thinkin'--too long for you to stay in Buffalo Meadows {{at this time of}} the year. Two months <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> eh, Parsons?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Three {{minutes past}} seven, or thereabouts," [...] French replied, yawning. [...] "I'm coming right along. We've lots of time. Three-quarters {{of an hour}} <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> the boys say." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Now, Miss May, do {{tell me what}} I <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>It</b> is such a beauty, {{better than}} any Shearman ever dreamt of; just look: at the finish of the lock.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Billy {{warmed up}} at this tale of {{distress}} in his usual way. [...] "Somebody <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something. <b>It's</b> a vile shame the kid being turned out like that." ...|$|R
25|$|If {{it is in}} {{our power}} to prevent {{something}} bad from happening, without thereby sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, then we <b>ought,</b> morally, <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "It's pretty plain. All the same, I don't {{see what}} I <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> about <b>it.</b> Martin's plan doesn't quite meet the bill: I'd sooner try {{something}} a little more vigorous." ...|$|R
60|$|For, {{whatever}} they <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> <b>it</b> is quite certain {{the majority of}} men will act as if the attainment of certain positive and negative pleasures were the end of action.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's right, Bill. You see you <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> {{not only}} to please your mother, but to please God. That's what my mother has told me over and over again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is too bad; but you <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> {{because it}} 's right, and never mind being paid," [...] began Polly, {{trying to be}} moral, but {{secretly}} sympathizing heartily with poor Tom.|$|E
6000|$|... 'This is why, then. Because you hadn't {{cleared his}} father to him, and you <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> have <b>done</b> <b>it.</b> Because, before you went into any tantrum about yourself, who are--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think you}} <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> have <b>done</b> <b>it</b> yourself, Miss Shirley," [...] Verrian said, feeling like the worm that turns. He added, less resentfully, [...] "We <b>ought</b> both <b>to</b> have taken it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am sure much <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> be <b>done.</b> <b>It</b> is mere {{waste to}} have two {{separate}} schools, when a master can bring the children on so much better in the higher subjects.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, indeed, {{and yours}} {{are sort of}} red. Let me see. Yes, I really think you <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> before they get worse," [...] said Ariadne, peering into the large clear eye offered for inspection.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Tell {{him that}} you are my sister, that I am his son, that I love you so, that I love him so; tell him anything. Say that he <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> because I am a Hebrew.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Henchard breathed heavily. [...] "Poor thing--better you had {{not known}} me! Upon my heart and soul, if ever I should be left in a {{position}} to carry out that marriage with thee, I OUGHT to do it--I <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> indeed!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{were bound}} {{to get to the}} bottom of it all, if we could; and I think that we have,--at last. Perhaps, as you say, we <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> have <b>done</b> <b>it</b> sooner." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Has she?"--he cried, in {{the same}} eager tone.-- [...] "Then she has forgiven me before she <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> have <b>done</b> <b>it.</b> But she shall forgive me again, and on more {{reasonable}} grounds.--NOW will you listen to me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> have <b>done</b> <b>it.</b> But I {{have been}} in doubt whether you would be pleased with my plan. I was not quite clear on a few points myself. I am going to take an entirely new course." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{seems as}} though we <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> to-day, {{if it would be}} jest as well for the garden, 'cause we don't count on your keepin' us for ever; an' after we leave here to-morrow it wouldn't be right to come back." ...|$|E
6000|$|His {{tone was}} still half bantering; {{but it had}} {{become more and more}} serious, so that she could say in earnest: [...] "But the money is one of the drawbacks. It was Mr. Peck's idea that the working people <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> all themselves." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I would as soon {{say it to}} her as not," [...] said Ida; [...] "somebody <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> Why, if {{that horse}} had shied towards me instead of away from me when I jumped from that tree, I might have been very much hurt." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "George," [...] says Mrs. Bagnet, working busily, [...] "if I {{thought you}} cross {{enough to think}} of {{anything}} that a shrill old soldier's wife--who could have bitten her tongue off afterwards and <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> have <b>done</b> <b>it</b> almost--said this morning, I don't know what I shouldn't say to you now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; I {{know the}} feeling well. There {{is so much}} that <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> be <b>done</b> and <b>it</b> seems impossible. But what <b>did</b> you want <b>to</b> do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Barnet {{looked as}} if he regretted it deeply. 'You will wear your poor eyes out,' he said, with more {{sentiment}} than he had hitherto shown. 'You <b>ought</b> not <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> There was a time when I should have said you must not. Well--I almost wish I had never seen light with my own eyes when I think of that!' ...|$|R
