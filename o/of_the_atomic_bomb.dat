5|$|The Beginning or the End (1947) is an American {{docudrama}} {{film about}} the development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>bomb</b> in World War II, directed by Norman Taurog, starring Brian Donlevy and Hume Cronyn, and released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The film dramatizes the creation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>bomb</b> in the Manhattan Project and the bombing of Hiroshima.|$|E
5|$|In total Mount St. Helens {{released}} 24 megatons {{of thermal}} energy, 7 {{of which were}} {{a direct result of}} the blast. This is equivalent to 1,600 times the size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>bomb</b> dropped on Hiroshima.|$|E
5|$|With Dexter Masters, she co-edited the 1946 New York Times bestseller One World or None: a Report to the Public on the Full Meaning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atomic</b> <b>Bomb.</b> The book {{included}} {{essays by}} Niels Bohr, Albert Einstein and Robert Oppenheimer, and sold over 100,000 copies.|$|E
50|$|While {{the first}} movie focused on <b>the</b> {{immediate}} effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atomic</b> <b>bombing</b> <b>of</b> Hiroshima, <b>the</b> second film focuses on the long-term problems that faced the survivors, including the devastated economy and infrastructure, food shortages, unemployment, lack <b>of</b> housing, and <b>the</b> lingering effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>bomb's</b> radioactive fallout.|$|R

5|$|In {{dealing with}} Stalin, Truman {{decided to give}} the Soviet leader vague hints about the {{existence}} of a powerful new weapon without going into details. However, the other Allies were unaware that Soviet intelligence had penetrated the Manhattan Project in its early stages, so Stalin already knew of the existence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>bomb</b> but did not appear impressed by its potential.|$|E
5|$|Foreseeing {{another war}} in Europe, Szilard {{moved to the}} United States in 1938, where he worked with Enrico Fermi and Walter Zinn on means of {{creating}} a nuclear chain reaction. He was present when this was achieved on December 2, 1942. He worked for the Manhattan Project's Metallurgical Laboratory on aspects of nuclear reactor design. He drafted the Szilard petition advocating a demonstration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>bomb,</b> but the Interim Committee chose to use them against cities without warning.|$|E
5|$|He {{assisted}} in the development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>bomb</b> during World War II and became known to a wide public in the 1980s {{as a member of}} the Rogers Commission, the panel that investigated the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster. Along with his work in theoretical physics, Feynman has been credited with pioneering the field of quantum computing and introducing the concept of nanotechnology. He held the Richard C. Tolman professorship in theoretical physics at the California Institute of Technology.|$|E

5|$|The Hiroshima {{authorities}} took {{advice about}} the city's reconstruction from foreign consultants, and in 1947 Tam Deling, an American park planner, suggested they build a Peace Memorial and preserve buildings situated near ground zero, that point directly below the explosion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>bomb.</b> In 1949 the authorities enacted the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Reconstruction Act, {{which gave the}} city access to special grant aid, and in August 1949, an international competition was announced {{for the design of}} the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park.|$|E
5|$|The Smyth Report {{was issued}} by the US War Department on 12 August 1945, giving the story <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>bomb</b> and {{including}} the technical details that could now be made public. It made few references to the British contribution to the bomb, and a White Paper, Statements Relating to the Atomic Bomb was hurriedly drafted by Michael Perrin. This account was issued just after Attlee had replaced Churchill as Prime Minister, and was the only official statement on the British contribution for fifteen years.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with four}} other {{scientists}} and various military personnel, von Neumann {{was included in the}} target selection committee responsible for choosing the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki as the first targets <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>bomb.</b> Von Neumann oversaw computations related to the expected size of the bomb blasts, estimated death tolls, and the distance above the ground at which the bombs should be detonated for optimum shock wave propagation and thus maximum effect. The cultural capital Kyoto, which had been spared the bombing inflicted upon militarily significant cities, was von Neumann's first choice, a selection seconded by Manhattan Project leader General Leslie Groves. However, this target was dismissed by Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson.|$|E

5|$|Nixon is {{assigned}} to General Leslie Groves (Brian Donlevy), who is placed {{in charge of the}} project. Groves has to bring together the scientific, industrial and defense communities to build the atomic bomb. In 1945, following the death of Roosevelt, the new president, Harry S. Truman (Art Baker), continues to support the atomic project, now moved to Los Alamos, New Mexico. When refined uranium-235 is obtained, the first atomic bomb is built and tested successfully in the New Mexico desert. Facing stiff resistance in the Pacific War, Truman orders the use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>bomb</b> against Japan in July 1945.|$|E
5|$|Saratoga was {{surplus to}} postwar {{requirements}} {{with the large}} numbers of Essex-class carriers in service, and she was assigned to Operation Crossroads on 22 January 1946. This was a test conducted at Bikini Atoll to evaluate the effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>bomb</b> on ships. Captain Stanhope Ring assumed command on 6 March, but was relieved on 2 June by Captain Donald MacMahan. The ship hosted comedian Jack Benny's radio show on 21 April, while Saratoga was berthed in San Francisco before her departure for Bikini. She departed from pier 33 and headed out the Golden Gate on 1 May 1946.|$|E
5|$|While many Manhattan {{scientists}} {{expected that}} the development of the means of delivery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>bomb</b> would be straightforward, Parsons, with his experience of the proximity fuze program, expected that it would involve considerable effort. The test program was initiated on 13 August 1943 at the Naval Proving Ground in Dahlgren, Virginia, where a scale model of the Fat Man plutonium bomb was developed. On 3 March 1944, testing moved to Muroc Army Air Field, California. The initial tests demonstrated that the Fat Man assembly was unstable in flight, and that its fuzes did not work properly.|$|E

5|$|After {{completing}} the first 15 {{years of the}} sentence, Lebrón's social worker {{told her that she}} could ask for parole, but she did not display interest in the proposal, never signing the required documentation. Due to this lack of interest, she was mandated to attend a meeting before a penitentiary committee, where she presented a written deposition expressing her position about the parole proposal as well as other subjects including terrorism, politics and the United States' use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>bomb.</b> Following this the other inmates reacted with skepticism over her intentions to refuse the offer, which made her distance herself from them and focus her attention in studying as well as writing poetry. During this timeframe, Lebrón's interest in religion grew. Lebrón's daughter Gladys died in 1977, while her mother was in prison.|$|E
5|$|Later, Gladwell compares Langan with Oppenheimer, {{the father}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>bomb.</b> Noting that they typify innate natural {{abilities}} {{that should have}} helped them both succeed in life, Gladwell argues that Oppenheimer's upbringing made a pivotal difference in his life. Oppenheimer grew {{up in one of}} the wealthiest neighborhoods in Manhattan, {{was the son of a}} successful businessman and a painter, attended the Ethical Culture Fieldston School on Central Park West, and was afforded a childhood of concerted cultivation. Outliers argues that these opportunities gave Oppenheimer the chance to develop the practical intelligence necessary for success. Gladwell then provides an anecdote: When Oppenheimer was a student at University of Cambridge he attempted to poison one of his tutors. He avoided punishment, and continued his studies by using the skills gained from his cultivated upbringing in his negotiation with the university's administrators, who had wanted to expel him.|$|E
5|$|Seaborg's {{theoretical}} {{development of}} the actinide concept resulted in a redrawing of the Periodic Table of the Elements into its current configuration with the actinide series appearing below the lanthanide series. Seaborg developed the chemical elements americium and curium while in Chicago. He managed to secure patents for both elements. His patent on curium never proved commercially viable because of the element's short half-life, but americium is commonly used in household smoke detectors and thus provided {{a good source of}} royalty income to Seaborg in later years. Prior to the test of the first nuclear weapon, Seaborg joined with several other leading scientists in a written statement known as the Franck Report (secret at the time but since published) unsuccessfully calling on President Truman to conduct a public demonstration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>bomb</b> witnessed by the Japanese.|$|E

5|$|XXI Bomber Command {{arrived on}} Saipan on October 12, 1944, {{and from the}} start Hansell was beset {{by a host of}} serious command problems, the worst of which were {{continued}} teething problems with the B-29, tardy delivery of aircraft, aircrews untrained in high altitude formation flying, primitive airfield conditions, lack of an air service command for logistical support, no repair depots, a total absence of target intelligence, stubborn internal resistance to daylight operations by his sole combat wing, subordinates in the XXI Bomber Command who lobbied for his removal, and Hansell’s inferiority in rank in dealing with other AAF commanders in the theater. Furthermore, Hansell was soon prohibited from flying combat missions with his command, possibly because of limited knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>bomb</b> or the perception that he knew the existence of Ultra.|$|E
5|$|The Los Alamos Laboratory was {{reinforced}} by a British Mission under James Chadwick. The first to arrive were Otto Frisch and Ernest Titterton; later arrivals included Niels Bohr and his son Aage Bohr, and Sir Geoffrey Taylor, an expert on hydrodynamics who made a major contribution {{to the understanding of}} the Rayleigh–Taylor instability. This instability at the interface between two fluids of different densities occurs when the lighter fluid is pushing the heavier, and was vital to the interpretation of experiments with explosives, predicting the effects of an explosion, the design of the neutron initiators, and the design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>bomb</b> itself. Chadwick remained only for a few months; he was succeeded as head of the British Mission by Rudolf Peierls. The original idea, favored by Groves, was that the British scientists would work as a group under Chadwick, who would farm out work to them. This was soon discarded in favor of having the British Mission fully integrated into the laboratory. They worked in most of its divisions, only being excluded from plutonium chemistry and metallurgy. With the passage of the Atomic Energy Act of 1946, known as the McMahon Act, all British government employees had to leave. All had left by the end of 1946, except for Titterton, who was granted a special dispensation, and remained until 12 April 1947. The British Mission ended when he departed.|$|E
