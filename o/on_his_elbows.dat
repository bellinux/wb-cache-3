25|$|Despite his {{weakened}} condition, 1stLt Rouh {{shoved his}} two comrades {{to the ground}} to save them from flying fragments. He dropped his carbine and dove for the grenade. He was down <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>elbows</b> and one knee when the grenade exploded. His abdomen and chest caught the blast, and he sank to the ground. None of his men were hit.|$|E
500|$|In July 1651, the Massachusetts Bay Colony {{was visited}} by three Rhode Islanders {{who had become}} Baptists: [...] John Clarke, Obadiah Holmes, and John Crandall. [...] Massachusetts reacted harshly against the visit, imprisoning the three men, while Cotton preached [...] "against the heinousness" [...] of the Anabaptist {{opinions}} of these men. [...] The three men were given exorbitant fines, despite public opinion against punishment. [...] Friends paid the fines for Clarke and Crandall, but Holmes refused to allow anyone to pay his fine. [...] As a result, he was publicly whipped in such a cruel manner that he could only sleep <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>elbows</b> and knees for weeks afterwards. [...] News of the persecutions reached England and met with a negative reaction. [...] Sir Richard Saltonstall, a friend of Cotton's from Lincolnshire, wrote to Cotton and Wilson in 1652 rebuking them for the practices of the colony. [...] He wrote, [...] "It doth not a little grieve my spirit to heare what sadd things are reported dayly of your tyranny and persecutions in New-England as that you fyne, whip and imprison men for their consciences." [...] He continued, [...] "these rigid wayes have layed you very lowe {{in the hearts of}} the saynts." [...] Roger Williams also wrote a treatise on these persecutions which was published after Cotton's death.|$|E
2500|$|... 21 September was Triggers best day. She was patrolling some [...] {{north of}} the Hoka Sho light when she sighted a convoy of three tankers and three freighters {{protected}} by Japanese planes. The submarine attacked the tankers first, firing three torpedoes at the leader and three at the second. One hit aft was seen on the lead tanker, and flames shot over [...] into the air. The target's crew, dressed in whites, could be seen running forward to escape the fire. One torpedo hit the second tanker amidships, and it broke in half beneath the stack and sank immediately. Trigger turned and fired three stern tubes at the third tanker. This target swung toward the submarine, and all three torpedoes missed. Trigger then fired another torpedo which hit that ship's starboard side. When the submarine went deep, Dornin slipped and fell into the periscope well as the quartermaster was lowering it. He supported himself <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>elbows,</b> and the quartermaster heard his shouts in time to prevent a serious accident. Sonar reported two more explosions before the submarine came back up to periscope depth to resume the attack. Trigger fired two bow torpedoes at the third freighter in the column and scored two hits on the target which went down by the bow. The submarine then made two more attacks on the freighter, but all of her torpedoes either missed or were duds. During the three and one-half hours of action, Trigger sank two tankers, Shiriya and Shoyo Maru, and a freighter, Argun Maru, {{for a total of}} 20,660tons of enemy shipping. The submarine returned to Midway on 30 September to be refitted and rearmed.|$|E

2500|$|In March 2015, Nogueira {{revealed}} {{in an interview}} with Combate that he had undergone stem cell therapy <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>elbows,</b> hips and knees. Nogueira said,"They have a clinic in Kansas where they work with stem cells. What they do is they remove some cells from fat out of your back and then inject them in your joints. I did it on my elbows, my hips and knees. It stimulates cartilage growth. It's pretty cutting edge technique. I'm responding really well so far. It's been helping a lot with my pain. I'm still doing physiotherapy, which is responsible for curing my hips, but I'm now doing this to make it even stronger. I had a break between my last fight and The Ultimate Fighter shootings, so I decided to go for it."Nogueira also confessed a desire to fight Frank Mir for a third time saying,"In two weeks I'll be cleared to train freely again. First, I will get my body strong enough so I can train and be 100% ready to fight. I intend to fight at UFC 190 in August. I wanted to come back at the TUF finale card, but I'm afraid there won't be enough time. I'll definitely be ready in August. The UFC told me they would put me in a card in August. They didn't say which one, but I'm sure it'll be the one in Rio. I still don't have an opponent. They said there were three different guys I could be fighting, but I can't comment on that. I don't have any preferences really. I just want to come back and fight, but I would like to face Frank Mir again {{before the end of the}} year." ...|$|E

60|$|A perilous {{flush of}} joy overspread the pale face; he started up <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>elbows,</b> {{and his eyes}} danced rapture, as some one at the door handed in the {{beautiful}} red morocco quarto of the Cathedral music; and the Bishop, with a fatherly hand making him lie down again, laid the book beside him, as he gasped out something like thanks.|$|E

6000|$|On a soft grassy spot, {{close to}} the {{warbling}} stream, lay our friend Peterkin, on his breast, resting <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>elbows,</b> and the forefinger {{of his right hand}} raised.
