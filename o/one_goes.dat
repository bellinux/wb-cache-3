5|$|Sexual {{encounters}} at bathhouses are frequently, but not always, anonymous. Some {{feel that}} the anonymity adds to the erotic excitement: that is what, for these patrons, <b>one</b> <b>goes</b> to the bathhouse for. Bathhouse encounters sometimes lead to relationships, but usually do not. Bathhouses are still used by {{men who have sex}} with men and do not identify as gay or bisexual, including those that are closeted or in heterosexual relationships.|$|E
5|$|The {{macroscopic}} {{physical properties}} of the noble gases are dominated by the weak van der Waals forces between the atoms. The attractive force increases {{with the size of}} the atom {{as a result of the}} increase in polarizability and the decrease in ionization potential. This results in systematic group trends: as <b>one</b> <b>goes</b> down group18, the atomic radius, and with it the interatomic forces, increases, resulting in an increasing melting point, boiling point, enthalpy of vaporization, and solubility. The increase in density is due to the increase in atomic mass.|$|E

25|$|The {{image to}} the right shows a simple {{sequential}} game that illustrates the issue with subgame imperfect Nash equilibria. In this game player one chooses left(L) or right(R), which is followed by player two being called upon to be kind (K) or unkind (U) to player one, However, player two only stands to gain from being unkind if player <b>one</b> <b>goes</b> left. If player <b>one</b> <b>goes</b> right the rational player two would de facto be kind to him in that subgame. However, The non-credible threat of being unkind at 2(2) is still part of the blue (L, (U,U)) Nash equilibrium. Therefore, if rational behavior can be expected by both parties the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium {{may be a more}} meaningful solution concept when such dynamic inconsistencies arise.|$|E

25|$|Past {{climate is}} {{interpreted}} using {{a number of}} methods including lake levels, river strength, dune systems, glacial extent and pollen. The further back in time <b>one</b> <b>goes,</b> the broader the signals used become. While the climate can be inferred for a specific location 20,000 years ago, 5 million years ago the climate over most of Africa has to be considered and the results adjusted using current analogies. Problems associated with going back a long time include an uneven distribution of records and a shortage of vegetation fossils due to unfavourable conditions.|$|E

25|$|The Rouse profile characterizes {{sediment}} concentrations {{because the}} Rouse number includes both turbulent mixing and settling {{under the weight}} of the particles. Turbulent mixing results in the net motion of particles from regions of high concentrations to low concentrations. Because particles settle downward, for all cases where the particles are not neutrally buoyant or sufficiently light that this settling velocity is negligible, there is a net negative concentration gradient as <b>one</b> <b>goes</b> upward in the flow. The Rouse Profile therefore gives the concentration profile that provides a balance between turbulent mixing (net upwards) of sediment and the downwards settling velocity of each particle.|$|E
