25|$|According to biographer Juhani Suomi, Kekkonen gave {{no thought}} to resigning until his {{physical}} condition began to deteriorate in July 1981. The 80-year-old president {{then began to}} seriously consider resigning, most likely in early 1982. Prime Minister Mauno Koivisto finally dealt a defeat to Kekkonen in 1981. In April, Koivisto did what no <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>had</b> dared to during Kekkonen's presidency by stating that under the constitution, {{the prime minister and}} cabinet were responsible to Parliament, not to the President. He then refused to resign at Kekkonen's request. This is generally seen as the death-knell of the Kekkonen era.|$|E
25|$|A synagogal {{prerogative}} of the exilarch was {{mentioned in the}} land of Israel as a curiosity : The Torah roll was carried to the exilarch, while every <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>had</b> to go to the Torah to read from it. This prerogative is referred to also in the account of the installation of the exilarch in the Arabic period, and this gives color to the assumption that the ceremonies, as recounted in this document, were based in part on usages taken over from the Persian time. The account of the installation of the exilarch is supplemented by further details in regard to the exilarchate which are of great historical value; see the following section.|$|E
25|$|After {{winning the}} Intercontinental Cup, Real Madrid titled {{themselves}} world champions until FIFA {{stepped in and}} objected, citing that the competition did not include any other champions from the other confederations; FIFA stated that they can only claim to be intercontinental champions of a competition played between two organisations in which no <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>had</b> the opportunity to participate. FIFA failed to authorise the competition in the 1960s. FIFA stated that they would prohibit the 1961 edition to be played out unless the organisers regarded the competition as a friendly or a private match between two organisations. That same year the Intercontinental Cup was first played, FIFA authorised the International Soccer League to be contested with ratification from Sir Stanley Rous, who had become the FIFA President by that point.|$|E

500|$|A papal {{election}} {{could bring}} {{a dramatic change}} of fortune for a cardinal-nephew, often bringing the former favorites into conflict with the new Pope. For example, Prospero Colonna and Francisco de Borja were excommunicated, and Carlo Carafa was executed. The papal conclave, May 1605, {{is one example of}} a conclave where a candidate (Antonmaria Sauli) was defeated because enough other cardinals were convinced of the need for [...] "a Pope willing to punish the cardinal-nephews for robbing the papacy". A cardinal-nephew was also a potential threat to any future pontiff; for example, Ludovisi came to lead the opposition against Pope Urban VIII (1623–1644), even talking about calling a council against the Pope (which never occurred as Ludovisi died in 1632) because [...] "no <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>had</b> the standing to confront Urban's titanic temper".|$|E

[...] Although Shannon {{was unable to find}} a publisher, he sent a hundred-page portfolio of materials, including copies of some of Hubbard's naval and college records, to a number of [...] "concerned individuals". His work also found its way to the Church of Scientology's archivist, Gerry Armstrong, who was undertaking a project to research an official authorized biography of L. Ron Hubbard. According to Jon Atack, [...] "the archive largely confirmed Shannon's material. Armstrong and Shannon reached the same eventual destination from opposed starting points." [...] In October 1980, Omar Garrison, a writer who had previously written two books favorable to Scientology, was hired by the Church to write Hubbard's biography based on the materials that Armstrong had collected.|$|E
500|$|In {{his book}} Indian Music and the West (1997), Gerry Farrell {{refers to the}} song when {{discussing}} its author's contribution to popularising Indian classical music, writing: [...] "It is a mark of Harrison's sincere involvement with Indian music that, nearly thirty years on, the Beatles' 'Indian' songs remain among the most imaginative and successful examples {{of this type of}} fusion – for example, 'Blue Jay Way' and 'The Inner Light.'" [...] Simon Leng writes of the song: [...] "Harrison was working at a sophisticated level of extrapolating Indian scales to the Western setting, something no <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>had</b> done … 'Blue Jay Way' explores the structures of Indian music just as 'Within You Without You' debates its philosophical roots." [...] In her song review for the music website Something Else!, Kit O'Toole describes [...] "Blue Jay Way" [...] as one of its composer's [...] "most eccentric and abstract compositions" [...] and [...] "the perfect snapshot of the Beatles' most unusually creative artistic phase". Former Record Collector editor Peter Doggett, writing in Barry Miles' The Beatles Diary, similarly admires the recording, saying that the Beatles rendered the song [...] "an exotic, almost mystical journey" [...] that evokes a mysterious Eastern mood [...] "without a single Indian instrument being employed". Music critic Jim DeRogatis ranks [...] "Blue Jay Way" [...] at number 7 in his list of the Beatles' best psychedelic rock songs.|$|E
500|$|Some {{literary}} critics and historians argue {{that not only}} does Lady Macbeth represent an anti-mother figure in general, she also embodies {{a specific type of}} anti-mother: the witch. Critic Joanna Levin defines a witch as a woman who succumbs to Satanic force, a lust for the devil, and who, either for this reason or the desire to obtain supernatural powers, invokes (evil) spirits. English physician Edward Jorden published Briefe Discourse of a Disease Called the Suffocation of the Mother in 1603, in which he speculated that this force literally derived from the female sexual reproductive organs. Because no <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>had</b> published any other studies on the susceptibility of women, especially mothers, to becoming both the witch and the bewitched (i.e. demonically possessed), Jorden's findings helped create the foundation for the views popularized during the Renaissance about the relationship between women and witchcraft. Levin refers to Marianne Hester's Lewd Women and Wicked Witches: A Study of Male Domination, in which Hester articulates a feminist interpretation of the witch as an empowered woman. Levin summarises the claim of feminist historians like Hester: the witch should be a figure celebrated for her nonconformity, defiance, and general sense of empowerment; witches challenged patriarchal authority and hierarchy, specifically [...] "threatening hegemonic sex/gender systems." [...] This view associates witchcraft — and by extension, Lady Macbeth — not with villainy and evil, but with heroism.|$|E

2500|$|Many experts {{disagree}} with Kramer's assessment of Laver. For example, Dan Maskell, John Barrett, Joe McCauley, Ted Schroeder, and Tony Trabert rank Laver {{as the best}} of all time. Schroeder has been quoted by Alan Trengove as saying, [...] "You take all the criteria – longevity, playing on grass and clay, amateur, professional, his behaviour, his appearance – in all criteria, Laver's the best player of all time." [...] Trabert said in January 2008, [...] "I still maintain that Rod Laver is the best player who ever played the game because he's done something no one has ever done in the 120 or 140-year history of our sport: he won the Grand Slam as an amateur and he won the Grand Slam as a pro. If someone in some other sport held a world record no <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>had,</b> you would say that person was the best in that sport. So in my view, you've got to say Laver is the best player of all time." [...] Similarly, the tennis author Peter Bodo wrote in May 2008, [...] "Give him credit? Shoot, the only real issue is whether the GOAT [...] argument is a debate at all, given that posting those two Slams puts Laver in a league of his own." [...] Other experts cite the fact that during his amateur, touring professional, and Open Era careers, Laver won a record 184 singles titles. He also holds the record for most titles won in a single year during the amateur era (22 in 1962), during the touring pro era (19 in 1967), and during the Open Era (18 in 1969). After turning professional in 1963, Laver won the U.S. Pro Tennis Championships five times and the Wembley Pro Championship four times from 1964 to 1967. In 1967, Laver won a [...] "Professional Grand Slam" [...] by winning all four of the major professional tournaments: the US Pro Championships, the Wembley Pro Championships, the French Pro Championship, and the Wimbledon Pro.|$|E
