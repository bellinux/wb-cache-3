5000|$|As a 2-(2-diethylaminoethoxy)ethyl ester, it is {{chemically}} {{related to}} <b>oxeladin</b> and pentoxyverine, {{which are in}} the same class. (<b>Oxeladin</b> has an additional ethyl group in its carboxylic acid, pentoxyverine has both ethyl groups of <b>oxeladin</b> replaced by one cyclopentyl in the same place.) ...|$|E
50|$|Although fetal malformations {{have not}} been reported, <b>oxeladin</b> {{should not be used}} during the first {{trimester}} of pregnancy. <b>Oxeladin</b> is contraindicated in patients with MAOI therapy.|$|E

50|$|Each 100ml {{contains}} <b>oxeladin</b> citrate 200 mg. The bottle contains 100ml of syrup.|$|E
50|$|<b>Oxeladin</b> is a cough suppressant. It is {{a highly}} potent and {{effective}} drug used to treat all types of cough of various etiologies. It {{is not related to}} opium or its derivatives, so treatment with <b>oxeladin</b> is free of risk of dependence or addiction. <b>Oxeladin</b> has none of the side effects (such as hypnosis, respiratory depression, tolerance, constipation and analgesia) which are present when common antitussives, such as codeine and its derivatives, are used. It may be used at every age, as well as in patients with heart disease, since it has a high level of safety and a great selectivity to act on the bulbar centre of cough.|$|E
50|$|Each 1ml (33 drops) {{contains}} <b>oxeladin</b> citrate 20 mg. The bottle contains 20ml of solution.|$|E
5000|$|Each tablet {{contains}} <b>oxeladin</b> citrate 20 mg. The box contains 20 tablets in blister packs ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Oxeladin</b> is {{available}} as drops, syrup and tablets, providing easier ways of management {{which will be}} chosen depending on the age and clinical stage.|$|E
50|$|<b>Oxeladin</b> {{differs from}} common antitussives that cause {{addiction}} (such as etilmorphin, codeine or its derivatives) {{in that there}} is no evidence of risk of addiction or dependence.|$|E
50|$|<b>Oxeladin</b> is {{indicated}} in {{all types of}} cough. Besides its antitussive action, it helps to clear the respiratory tract, since it increases the quantity of secretion and thins bronchial secretion.|$|E
5000|$|The Drug and Medical Technology Agency of Armenia {{rejected}} the registration of <b>oxeladin</b> in July 2000 since studies in Germany have shown potential carcinogenicity of the drug. (Reference: Communication to WHO, 9 August 2000.) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{fabrication}} {{and performance}} characteristics of three novel potentiometric sensors for {{the determination of}} <b>oxeladin</b> citrate are described. The proposed sensors include a PVC plastic membrane sensor, a carbon paste sensor and a multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) composite coated copper wire sensor. The sensors {{are based on the}} oxeladin-phosphotungstate ion associate as electroactive material and dibutyl phthalate as solvent mediator. The developed sensors exhibited near nernstian slopes of 58. 00 ± 0. 22, 55. 00 ± 0. 69 and 57. 8 ± 0. 13 mV concentration decade- 1 at 25 ºC, in the concentration ranges 5. 96 × 10 - 6 - 1. 00 × 10 - 2, 1. 96 × 10 - 5 - 1. 00 × 10 - 2 and 3. 98 × 10 - 6 - 1. 00 × 10 - 2 mol L- 1 <b>oxeladin</b> citrate with limits of detection of 4. 14 × 10 - 6, 8. 58 × 10 - 6 and 2. 51 × 10 - 6 mol L- 1 <b>oxeladin</b> citrate for plastic membrane, carbon paste and MWCNT composite coated copper wire sensors, respectively. The proposed sensors exhibit good selectivity for <b>oxeladin</b> with respect to a large number of inorganic cations, sugars, amino acids and vitamins. The developed sensors were successfully applied for the potentiometric determination of <b>oxeladin</b> citrate in the pharmaceutical preparation (Paxeladine® capsules) in batch and flow injection conditions. The sensors were also applied for the determination of <b>oxeladin</b> citrate in human urine samples by using the standard addition method...|$|E
40|$|We could {{determine}} carbetapentane, clobutinol and <b>oxeladin,</b> tertiary amino antitussives, with extremely high sensitivity by gas chromatography with surface ionization detection (GC-SID). The calibration curves showed satisfactory linearity {{in the range}} of 50 - 800 pg on column and the detection limit was about 30 pg on column (1. 5 ng/ml). Solid extraction method with Sep-pak C 18 cartridges was useful for purification of these antitussives from body fluids. We also quantitated <b>oxeladin</b> in whole blood and urine of a healthy volunteer 3 h after the administration; the concentrations were 12. 7 ng/ml in the whole blood and 72. 8 ng/ml in the urine. rights:日本法中毒学会rights:本文データは日本法中毒学会の許諾のもと掲載しています...|$|E
