5000|$|In {{order to}} {{distinguish}} between the two versions of the heptode, manufacturers data often describes them as [...] "heptode of the hexode type" [...] for a heptode without a suppressor grid, and a [...] "heptode of the <b>octode</b> type", where a suppressor grid is present.|$|E

5000|$|... (2) Letters B, F, I, M, N, Q, S and T were so {{very rarely}} used that most tubes {{beginning}} with these letters (such as the FC13 <b>Octode,</b> the function letter C of which doesn't match anyway) {{should not be}} assumed {{to be part of}} this naming scheme.|$|E
50|$|Although not {{strictly}} a pentagrid (in {{that it has}} more than five grids), the <b>octode</b> (eight-electrode) nevertheless operates on the pentagrid principle. It resulted simply from the addition of an extra screen grid to the UK version of the pentagrid heptode. This was done mainly to improve the antenna/oscillator separation and to reduce the power consumption for use in radio sets operated by dry batteries that were becoming increasingly popular.|$|E
50|$|In North America, {{the only}} <b>octode</b> {{manufactured}} was the 7A8. Introduced by Sylvania in 1939 (and used mostly by Philco), this valve {{was the product}} of adding a suppressor grid to type 7B8, which was the loctal version of type 6A7. Adding the suppressor allowed Sylvania to lower the current of the 6.3-volt heater from 320 milliamperes to 150 milliamperes while maintaining the same conversion transconductance (550 microsiemens). This allowed Philco to use this valve in every line of radio throughout the 1940s.|$|E
5000|$|The Philips EK3 <b>octode</b> was {{designated}} as a [...] "beam octode". The novel part about the design was that grids 2 and 3 were constructed as beam-forming plates. This was done {{in such a way}} that Philips claimed that the oscillator electron beam and the mixer electron beams were separated as much as possible and thus the pulling effect was minimised. [...] No information is available as to the degree of success. The manufacturer's information also notes that the valve's high performance comes at a cost of a high heater current of 600 mA - double that of more conventional types.|$|E
5000|$|Like all tube {{numbering}} systems, {{there are}} many inconsistencies between theory and practice. For example, there is no assigned letter code for cathode-ray tubes. Some unusual types received rather mundane sounding designations, based solely on electrode count, {{because there was no}} better place to put them. For example, the 2F21 is not an actual hexode, but a pattern generating monoscope tube. Some very exotic types received generic designators, even when there was a more appropriate designator available. For example, the 2H21 [...] "phasitron" [...] phase modulator tube used in early FM broadcast transmitters was assigned an [...] "H" [...] (<b>octode)</b> designator, when {{it would have been a}} perfect candidate for the otherwise unused [...] "T" [...] category for deflection controlled tubes.|$|E

Dielectrophoresis (DEP) in microfluidic chips is an established technique to investigate, group, wash, cultivate and sort cells contact-free under physiological conditions: microelectrode <b>octode</b> cages, versatile dielectrophoretic elements energized with radio frequency electric fields, stably trap single cells or cellular aggregates. For medical applications and cell cultivation, possible side effects of the dielectrophoretic manipulation, such as membrane polarization and Joule heating, have to be quantified. Therefore, we characterized the electric field-induced warming in dielectrophoretic cages using ohmic resistance measurements, fluorometry, liquid crystal beads, infra-red thermography and bubble size thermometry. We compare {{the results of these}} techniques with respect to the influences of voltage, electric conductivity of buffer, frequency, cage size and electrode surface. We conclude that in the culture medium thermal effects may be neglected if low voltages and an electric field-reducing phase pattern are used. Our experimental results provide explicit values for estimating the thermal effect on dielectrophoretically caged cells and show that Joule heating is best minimized by optimizing the cage geometry and reducing the buffer conductivity. The results may additionally serve to evaluate and improve theoretical predictions on field-induced effects. Based on present-day chip processing possibilities, DEP is well suited for the manipulation of cells...|$|E
