50|$|Originally, a {{permanently}} illuminated white <b>marker</b> <b>light</b> {{was positioned}} beneath the main colour light head {{in lieu of}} the red <b>marker</b> <b>light.</b> The caution turnout indication was a single yellow in the main head over three white lights at an angle of 45 degrees. The red <b>marker</b> <b>light</b> was introduced from 1965. The majority of early single light colour light signals had either been replaced or retrofitted with red <b>marker</b> <b>lights,</b> by 2000.|$|R

5000|$|Blackout Marker Lights {{serve the}} purpose of marking the {{position}} of the vehicle during blackout driving. They also are used as an aid in keeping the proper safe following distance when driving in a convoy at night. US Military <b>marker</b> <b>lights</b> are designed with a series of [...] "cat eyes" [...] that appear differently depending on the distance one is away from the vehicle that is equipped with the lights. When the following distance is too far the rear <b>marker</b> <b>lights</b> appear as a single red light and when too close as four separate red lights. When the correct following distance of 180 to 60 feet is maintained the taillights appear as two red lights.|$|R
50|$|Because their styling {{changed little}} from 1958 through 1982, many film {{producers}} were not careful to use period-correct Checker cars in their work. Often, a later model Checker (with side <b>marker</b> <b>lights,</b> late-1970s bumpers, etc.) {{was used in}} 1950s or 1960s settings.|$|R
50|$|Front <b>marker</b> <b>lights</b> are {{typically}} mounted below {{or to the}} side of the vehicles normal headlights. They serve the purpose of making the vehicle visible to oncoming drivers or for a driver to see if a vehicle is following him or her.|$|R

50|$|There are subtle design {{differences}} between the years. Noticeable differences have included: change over from non-synchro to synchro first gear in 1967; a grill and bumperette change in 1968; and side <b>marker</b> <b>lights</b> in 1969. The basic body design, however, remained unchanged.|$|R
25|$|In early 2015, the {{remaining}} 12 ex-Conrail SD80MACs owned by CSX, were purchased by Norfolk Southern, and renumbered 7217-7228. Most have been repainted, and currently {{all of them}} still have red <b>marker</b> <b>lights</b> intact, but {{it is unclear whether}} or not they will be removed.|$|R
25|$|Like all 1968 {{passenger}} vehicles {{sold in the}} United States, GTOs now featured front outboard shoulder belts (cars built after January 1, 1968) and side <b>marker</b> <b>lights.</b> To comply with the new 1968 federal vehicle emissions standards, the GTO was now equipped with emissions controls.|$|R

5000|$|... 1970: Mid-cycle {{update with}} many detail changes {{including}} {{a completely new}} grille including wraparound front turn signals, exterior trim changes, and new side <b>marker</b> <b>lights.</b> [...] "Sport Custom" [...] trim replaces [...] "Custom Cab", and [...] "Ranger XLT" [...] added as top trim level.|$|R
5000|$|... 1968 models had {{reshaped}} {{front and}} rear loop-type bumpers that encased the vehicle's (recessed crosshatch) grille and tail lamps, respectively. Hidden wiper arms were also new. Federally mandated side <b>marker</b> <b>lights</b> were of an inverted trapezoidal shape on the lower leading edges of the front fenders. Rear <b>marker</b> <b>lights</b> were circular. The interior was restyled and, unlike the 1966-67 models, shared its instrument panel with the other full-size Buick models. Shoulder belts for front outboard occupants were made standard on all cars built from January 1, 1968. There were very few mechanical changes in 1968, but the transmission lost its variable pitch torque converter. A tilt steering wheel was standard. Sales set another new record in 1968, as 49,284 units were sold.|$|R

50|$|There {{were some}} minor {{differences}} in trim for various markets, {{the most obvious}} being different <b>marker</b> <b>lights</b> on US market Dinos. Group 4-style flared wheelarches were optional, as were seats from the 365 GTB/4 Daytona, the pair often ordered in conjunction with wide, sand-cast Campagnolo alloys.|$|R
