25|$|During the Troubles, {{as part of}} its armed {{campaign}} against British rule in Northern Ireland, the Provisional IRA had repeatedly used homemade mortars against targets in Northern Ireland. The most notable attack was the 1985 Newry mortar attack which killed nine members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary. The IRA had carried out many attacks in England, but had not used mortars there. However, in December 1988 items used in their construction and technical details regarding the weapon's trajectory were found during a raid in Battersea, South London by members of the Metropolitan Police Anti-Terrorist Branch. In the late 1980s British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was top of the IRA's list for assassination, following the failed attempt on her life in the Brighton hotel bombing. Security around Downing Street had been stepped up at a cost of £800,000 following increased IRA activity in England in 1988, including the addition of a police guard post and security gates {{at the end of the}} street. Plans to leave a car bomb on a street near Downing Street and detonate it by remote control as Thatcher's <b>official</b> <b>car</b> was driving by had been ruled out by the IRA's Army Council owing to the likelihood of civilian casualties, which some Army Council members argued would have been politically counter-productive.|$|E

500|$|The 1956 Winter Olympics was {{organised}} by {{a committee}} composed {{of members of the}} Italian National Olympic Committee and the Italian government. [...] Observers were sent to the Oslo Games in 1952 to collect information regarding the sports programme, infrastructure, and accommodation requirements. [...] The intelligence gathered there indicated that Cortina's facilities were not up to Olympic standards. The town did not have an ice stadium, or a speed skating rink; the alpine ski runs, ski jump and bobsleigh run were in poor condition. Cortina was a small village, and its infrastructure would be overwhelmed by the crowds expected for the Games. To accommodate the influx of people, new roads and rail lines had to be built, and the city's power grid and telephone lines expanded. Enhancements also had to be made to sewer and water capacity. [...] The Italian government supplied Italian lira 460million for infrastructure improvements. The Italian Olympic Committee was responsible for funding the rest of the costs of hosting the Games. They did this by setting aside monies from their own budget, ticket sales, and even culling funds from local football betting pools. [...] The organising committee also took the unprecedented step of selling corporate sponsorship. [...] For example, Fiat was designated the <b>official</b> <b>car</b> of the 1956 Winter Olympics, and Olivetti supplied typewriters for the 400 journalists attending the Games.|$|E
