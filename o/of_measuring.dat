40|$|International audienceThis paper {{gives an}} {{explicit}} method {{to choose a}} <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> comparison. The proposed solution lies in a new representation <b>of</b> <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> comparison obtained by normalization of arguments. This normalization leads to a desirable property: <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> comparison do {{not depend on the}} scale of the system. Another consequence of this normalization is the fact that <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> satisfiability can be described by a unique argument and <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> resemblance by two arguments. The analysis <b>of</b> behaviours <b>of</b> <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> comparison is easy thanks to a geometrical interpretation and to a natural definition of the power of discrimination <b>of</b> a given <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> comparison. We focus on two families <b>of</b> <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> similitude: <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> satisfiability and <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> resemblance. For each family, we discuss the role of the new parameter we point out and we propose new measures satisfying particular properties. For <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> satisfiability, the parameter ϕ controls the severity towards difference between sets whereas the parameter ρ penalizes the differences between two sets for a <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> resemblance...|$|R
