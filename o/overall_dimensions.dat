5|$|In deposit, {{the spores}} are purple-brown to brown. Viewed with a microscopic, the spores appear purple, angular with lobes, and warted, with fine spines {{measuring}} 0.5–1.5µm long; the <b>overall</b> <b>dimensions</b> of the elliptic spores are 8–12 by 7–9µm. They contain {{one or two}} oil drops. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) measure 70–100 by 9–12µm, and have sterigmata that are 2–4µm thick by 7–12µm long. The flesh stains deep blue when a drop of potassium hydroxide solution is applied. The fungus contains the pigment thelephoric acid.|$|E
5|$|The VB series {{retained}} 96percent of {{the preceding}} HZ Kingswood's interior space, despite being 14percent smaller in <b>overall</b> <b>dimensions,</b> although fivepercent larger than the Torana. With the Commodore dropping a full class below the Kingswood and its Ford Falcon competitor, the smaller Commodore was predictably more fuel-efficient. This downsizing was first seen as a major disadvantage for Holden, as they had effectively relinquished the potential of selling Commodores to the fleet and taxi industries. These sales losses {{were thought to be}} unrecoverable; however, the 1979 energy crisis saw Australian oil prices rise by 140percent, putting substantial strain on the automotive industry to collectively downsize, a change that Holden had already done.|$|E
5|$|The colour of the {{spore print}} is brownish, with pink, reddish, or rosy tints. Spores are {{somewhat}} fuse-shaped, smooth, and measure 11–17 by 3–5µm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 18–25.6 by 7.0–10.2µm. Cystidia {{on the walls}} of the tubes (pleurocystidia) are fuse-shaped with a central swelling, thin-walled, and have granular contents. They possess sharp to tapered tips, and have <b>overall</b> <b>dimensions</b> of 36–44 by 8.0–11.0µm. On the pore edges, the cheilocystidia are similar in shape to the pleurocystidia, measuring 24.8–44.0 by 7.3–11.0µm. The hymenium of Smith and Thiers's variety uliginosus, when mounted in Melzer's reagent, shows reddish globules of pigment measuring 2–8µm that appear in the hyphae and throughout the hymenium, and a large (8–12µm) globule in the pleurocystidia.|$|E

5|$|Of the {{globular}} clusters within the Milky Way, {{the majority are}} found in a halo around the galactic core, and the large majority {{are located in the}} celestial sky centered on the core. In 1918, this strongly asymmetrical distribution was used by Shapley to make a determination of the <b>overall</b> <b>dimensions</b> of the galaxy. By assuming a roughly spherical distribution of {{globular clusters}} around the galaxy's center, he used the positions of the clusters to estimate the position of the Sun relative to the galactic center. While his distance estimate was in significant error (although within the same order of magnitude as the currently accepted value), it did demonstrate that the dimensions of the galaxy were much greater than had been previously thought. His error was due to interstellar dust in the Milky Way, which absorbs and diminishes the amount of light from distant objects, such as globular clusters, that reaches the Earth, thus making them appear to be more distant than they are.|$|E
