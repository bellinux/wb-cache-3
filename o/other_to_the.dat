5|$|A {{portrait}} of Marie closely resembling a photograph by Krøyer {{was completed in}} 1891. The following year, it {{was added to the}} frieze in the dining room at Skagen's Brøndums Hotel which had become the artists' favourite meeting place. Placed next to Krøyer's own portrait, it confirmed Marie's position as an accepted member of the Skagen Painters. The dining room was designed by the architects Ulrik Plesner and Thorvald Bindesbøll in connection with the first major expansion of the hotel in 1892. At Krøyer's suggestion, it was decided to incorporate Degn Brøndum's art collection into its decoration. Over the years it became a custom that visiting artists donated portraits of each <b>other</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hotel owner and these were placed in a frieze just under the ceiling. Today the dining room together with its frieze forms part of Skagens Museum.|$|E

5|$|A second form of mimicry {{occurs when}} two aposematic organisms {{share the same}} anti-predator {{adaptation}} and mimic each <b>other,</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> benefit of both species, since fewer individuals of either species need to be attacked for predators to learn to avoid both of them. This form of mimicry is known as Müllerian mimicry, after Fritz Müller, a German naturalist who studied the phenomenon in the Amazon in the late 19th century. Many species of bee and wasp that occur together are Müllerian mimics; their similar colouration teaches predators that a striped pattern is associated with being stung. Therefore, a predator which has had a negative experience with any such species will likely avoid any that resemble it in the future. Müllerian mimicry is found in vertebrates such as the mimic poison frog (Ranitomeya imitator) which has several morphs throughout its natural geographical range, each of which looks very similar to a different species of poison frog which lives in that area.|$|E
5|$|During the 20th {{century the}} long-abandoned gardens were replanted {{in a style}} {{sympathetic}} to the Tudor period. The knot garden was planted in 1972, to a design taken from Leonard Meager's Complete English Gardener, published in 1670. The intricate design of the knot {{can be seen from}} one of the two original viewing mounds, common in 16th-century formal gardening, one inside the moat and the <b>other</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> southwest. Other features of the grounds include a yew tunnel and an orchard growing fruits that would have been familiar to the house's Tudor occupants– apples, pears, quinces and medlars.|$|E
5|$|Early genetic {{studies were}} focused on lions from eastern and {{southern}} parts of Africa, and already showed that lions can possibly be divided in two main clades: one {{to the west of}} the Great Rift Valley and the <b>other</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east. Lions in eastern Kenya are genetically much closer to lions in South Africa than to lions in the Aberdare Range in western Kenya or in Uganda.|$|E

5|$|Ferguson was a Jacobite. The {{records of}} the Spalding Club include a soldier's letter which {{indicates}} it is likely Ferguson was willing to offer refuge to Jacobites {{who participated in the}} Battle of Culloden. Jacobite rebels captured from throughout Scotland were taken to stand trial at Carlisle Castle in 1746. Ferguson and fellow advocate Alexander Lockhart argued in their defence. Prosecutors showed little mercy, calling for the rebels to be executed by hanging. Since the prosecution assumed anyone dressed in tartan was guilty, Ferguson and Lockhart had their servants dress in tartan and appear along with the other defendants. They called each <b>other</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> stand to testify as to the whereabouts of the servants and proved that, despite their tartan dress, the defendants could not have taken part in the rebellion. Many were found guilty, but the tactic succeeded, as some of the accused were acquitted, including the Laird of Dunfallandy, a kinsman of Ferguson.|$|E
5|$|For Catherine, these {{entertainments}} {{served a}} political purpose {{that made them}} worth their colossal expense. She presided over the royal government {{at a time when}} the French monarchy was in steep decline. With three of her sons on the throne in succession and the country torn by religious civil war, Catherine set out to show not only the French people but foreign courts that the Valois monarchy was as prestigious and magnificent as it had been during the reigns of Francis I and her husband Henry II. At the same time, she believed these elaborate entertainments and sumptuous court rituals, which incorporated martial sports and tournaments of many kinds, would occupy her feuding nobles and distract them from fighting against each <b>other</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> detriment of the country and the royal authority.|$|E
5|$|Fox {{was drafted}} to the SmackDown brand {{as a part}} of the 2009 Supplemental Draft on April 15. She made her in-ring debut as a villainess on the April 30 episode of WWE Superstars, teaming with Michelle McCool to defeat Maria and Gail Kim. After winning her debut match, Fox aligned herself with Michelle McCool, with the pair teaming {{together}} in tag team matches as well as accompanying each <b>other</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ring for singles matches. Fox was in the corner of McCool when McCool won the WWE Women's Championship at The Bash.|$|E

5|$|I-97 {{continues}} {{north as}} a six-lane freeway and is closely paralleled {{on the east}} by Veterans Highway on {{the western edge of}} Severna Park. The highways cross Severn Run within Severn Run Natural Environment Area before they diverge slightly at the Interstate's partial cloverleaf interchange with Benfield Boulevard; access from northbound I-97 to the crossroad is via Veterans Highway. I-97 and Veterans Highway continue to parallel each <b>other</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> latter highway's northern end at I-97's partial cloverleaf interchange with the southern end of MD 3 Business (Robert Crain Highway) and New Cut Road. The interchange includes a flyover ramp from northbound I-97 to northbound Veterans Highway just south of its intersection with MD 3 Business. The freeway continues north along the west side of Glen Burnie and meets MD 174 (Quarterfield Road) at a four-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange and MD 100 at a cloverstack interchange that has flyover exit ramps from both directions of I-97.|$|E
5|$|More recently, it {{has been}} {{suspected}} that the western cicada killer represents more than one species. It co-occurs with the eastern cicada killer (S.speciosus) and Pacific cicada killer (S.convallis) at Big Bend National Park in Texas. There the three wasps hunt and nest in the same locales, and the eastern and western cicada killers hunt the same cicada species. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA showed that the western cicada killer contains two divergent clades, which may represent distinct species. The two clades appeared to be split by the Rocky Mountains, with one occurring mainly {{to the south and}} east, the <b>other</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west.|$|E
5|$|Motions of a bike can {{be roughly}} grouped into those {{out of the}} central plane of symmetry: lateral; {{and those in the}} central plane of symmetry: {{longitudinal}} or vertical. Lateral motions include balancing, leaning, steering, and turning. Motions in the central plane of symmetry include rolling forward, of course, but also stoppies, wheelies, brake diving, and most suspension activation. Motions in these two groups are linearly decoupled, that is they do not interact with each <b>other</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> first order. An uncontrolled bike is laterally unstable when stationary and can be laterally self-stable when moving under the right conditions or when controlled by a rider. Conversely, a bike is longitudinally stable when stationary and can be longitudinally unstable when undergoing sufficient acceleration or deceleration.|$|E

5|$|The Golden Film {{awards are}} {{presented}} during small press ceremonies {{throughout the year}} and shortly after a film has reached the audience criterion. The trophies are presented by {{the director of the}} Netherlands Film Festival or sometimes {{by a member of the}} crew or cast of the film itself. Two trophies are presented for each film: one to the film crew, represented by the producer and the director, and the <b>other</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cast of the film, represented by the lead actors.|$|E
5|$|The game {{also has}} a {{competitive}} mode, where two players compete against each <b>other</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> finish line, as either Sonic or Tails, in a split-screen race through three of the regular levels and a special stage. After one player finishes one of the regular levels, the other player must finish the zone within 60 seconds, or the level ends instantly. In the regular levels, players are ranked in five areas (score, time, rings held {{at the end of}} the level, total rings collected, and the number of item boxes broken). The player with wins in the most number of categories wins the level. In the Special Stage, players compete to obtain the most rings. The mode ends when all stages have been completed, or if a player loses all their lives, in which their opponent will automatically win.|$|E
5|$|The mission's {{objective}} was to airlift glider infantry of the 6th Airlanding Brigade and divisional troops to reinforce the British 6th Airborne Division on the left flank of the British invasion beaches. Using two landing zones, one {{to the west of}} the Caen canal and the <b>other</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east of the River Orne, Mallard was the third airborne operation involving units of the division on D-Day. The first, Operation Deadstick, had captured what are now known as the Pegasus and Horsa Bridges. Operation Tonga followed, dropping the division's two parachute brigades near Caen to the east.|$|E

5|$|The punchbowls are a 'harlequin pair', {{similar but}} not exactly matching. The bowls have been donated independently, {{one to the}} State Library of New South Wales (SLNSW) in 1926 and the <b>other</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Australian National Maritime Museum (ANMM) in 2006. The Library bowl is the more widely known of the pair. Its {{earliest}} provenance places it in England in the late 1840s, where {{it is said to}} originally have been commissioned for William Bligh; another source suggests Henry Colden Antill. It passed through several owners in Britain before it was presented to the State Library. The Museum bowl's first provenance is from England in 1932 and {{it has been suggested that}} it was made to the order of Arthur Phillip. Its whereabouts were unknown until it appeared in the Newark Museum, United States, in 1988, on loan from Peter Frelinghuysen Jr.. Through donations, the Maritime Museum later acquired the punchbowl from Frelinghuysen.|$|E
5|$|Wang Mang {{initiated}} {{a series of}} major reforms that were ultimately unsuccessful. These reforms included outlawing slavery, nationalizing land to equally distribute between households, and introducing new currencies, a change which debased the value of coinage. Although these reforms provoked considerable opposition, Wang's regime met its ultimate downfall with the massive floods of c. 3 AD and 11 AD. Gradual silt buildup in the Yellow River had raised its water level and overwhelmed the flood control works. The Yellow River split into two new branches: one emptying {{to the north and}} the <b>other</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south of the Shandong Peninsula, though Han engineers managed to dam the southern branch by 70 AD.|$|E
5|$|Barham had seriously miscalculated the {{strength}} of the Brest fleet, which had been uninvolved in the campaign of 1805 and was therefore at full strength. He also underestimated Napoleon, who had observed that Villeneuve's brief stay in the Caribbean had acted as a major threat to British trade, delaying convoys and causing panic among the West Indian merchants. The French naval authorities were also inspired by the effect of a raiding squadron under Contre-Admiral Zacharie Allemand, which had escaped from Rochefort on 17 July 1805, caused significant disruption to British trade in the Atlantic and remained at sea off the North African coast. Seeking to repeat these effects, Napoleon sent orders to the commander at Brest, Vice Admiral Honoré Ganteaume, in November 1805 for two strong squadrons to be prepared for service in the Atlantic. These were to leave Brest under cover of darkness on 13 December, with orders to strike deep into the Atlantic and intercept any merchant convoys that they encountered. Subsequently, the squadrons were to separate, one to the South Atlantic and the <b>other</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Caribbean, there to cause as much disruption to British intercontinental trade as possible. The orders encouraged the admirals not to engage any Royal Navy force of equivalent size or larger and thus avoid the risk of being captured or destroyed.|$|E
