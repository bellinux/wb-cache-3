25|$|Continued {{coverage}} on NBC of the NHL Winter Classic, {{to be played}} on New Year's Day unless that day lands on a Sunday, {{in which case the}} game is moved to January 2 (despite the <b>open</b> <b>time</b> slot on Sunday afternoons, NBC is effectively forbidden via a gentleman's agreement with the NFL which prevents any form of strong counterprogramming against NFL games televised on CBS and Fox). Initially the Classic was expected to be played in primetime, however to date every game has been scheduled for a 1 PM ET start, and due to new competition from the College Football Playoff the game is now expected to remain a daytime game for the foreseeable future. NBC has instead opted to air one prime time game each year, later in the season, since 2014.|$|E

2500|$|The way {{animals are}} housed in {{intensive}} systems varies. [...] Breeding sows will spend {{the bulk of their}} time in gestation crates during pregnancy. The use of these crates may be preferred as they facilitate feed management and growth control and prevent pig aggression. Sows are moved to farrowing crates, with litter, from before farrowing until weaning, to ease management of farrowing and reduce piglet loss from sows lying on them. [...] Dry or <b>open</b> <b>time</b> for sows can be spent in indoor pens or outdoor pens or pastures. Houses should be clean and well ventilated but draught-free.|$|E

2500|$|Paul Henning {{had long}} admired Benaderet's talents and strove {{to create a}} {{starring}} vehicle for her, as he felt she was worthy of headlining her own series after years of supporting parts. When CBS granted him an <b>open</b> <b>time</b> slot after the massive success of Beverly Hillbillies, he crafted the 1963 rural sitcom Petticoat Junction around Benaderet, and she starred as Kate Bradley, the widowed proprietor of the Shady Rest Hotel. Cousin Pearl was consequently written out of the Beverly Hillbillies storyline as having moved back home. The character of Kate represented Benaderet's first straight role: [...] "Kate Bradley {{is different from the}} characters I've played in the past. She has to walk a fine line between being humorous and tender. The other women I've played were strictly for laughs." [...] Benaderet and director Richard Whorf auditioned the young actresses who would play Kate's three teenaged daughters, and she persuaded Henning (serving as executive producer) to let his eighteen-year-old daughter Linda read (successfully) for the role of Betty Jo Bradley. Linda Henning and Benaderet's son Jack Bannon were members of a young actors' theater group at the time. CBS promoted the show's September 22, 1963 premiere with a print ad featuring an Al Hirschfeld caricature of Benaderet as Cousin Pearl. Petticoat Junction was an immediate hit, peaking at fourth in the Nielsen ratings, and remained in the top 30 during Benaderet's four full seasons on the show from 1963 to 1967. Her former Flintstones costars Alan Reed and Jean Vander Pyl filmed guest spots in later seasons.|$|E

Up {{to the end of the}} <b>Open</b> <b>Time</b> block this new offer was heavily advertised on the pay TV Terrestrial channel. A lot of secrecy was around this new channel and when launched it was a combination of rerun and first run content from Channel O and the rest of the Mnet Channels. From 2200 to 1100 the channel would simulcast completely with Channel O. It was also launched to promote South African movies but later evolved into a fullscale General Entertainment Channel. Its prime time also has reruns but also contains the American reality show starting over. It still contains African produced movies during prime time.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} {{verification of}} safety properties for parameterized systems of timed processes, so called timed networks. A timed network {{consists of a}} finite state process, called a controller, and an arbitrary set of identical timed processes. In [Parosh Aziz Abdulla and Bengt Jonsson. Model checking of systems with many identical timed processes. Theoretical Computer Science, 290 (1) : 241 – 264, 2003] it was shown that checking safety properties is decidable in the case where each timed process {{is equipped with a}} single real-valued clock. In [P. Abdulla, J. Deneux, and P. Mahata. Multi-clock timed networks. In Proc. LICS' 04, pages 345 – 354. IEEE Computer Society Press, 2004], we showed that this is no longer possible if each timed process is equipped with at least two real-valued clocks. In this paper, we study two subclasses of timed networks: closed and <b>open</b> <b>timed</b> networks. In closed timed networks, all clock constraints are non-strict, while in <b>open</b> <b>timed</b> networks, all clock constraints are strict (thus corresponds to syntactic removal of equality testing). We show that the problem becomes decidable for closed timed network, while it remains undecidable for <b>open</b> <b>timed</b> networks. We also consider robust semantics of timed networks by introducing timing fuzziness through semantic removal of equality testing. We show that the problem is undecidable both for closed and <b>open</b> <b>timed</b> networks under the robust semantics...|$|R
