5|$|In total 283 magical spells, {{also known}} as utterances, were carved and the signs painted blue <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> corridor, antechamber, and burial chamber of Unas' pyramid. They {{constitute}} the most complete rendition of the Pyramid Texts existing today. These spells were intended to help the king in overcoming hostile forces and powers in the Underworld and thus join with the sun god Ra, his divine father in the afterlife. By writing the texts <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pyramid internal chambers, the architects of Unas' pyramid ensured that the king would benefit from their potency even if the funerary cult was to cease.|$|E
5|$|The {{station was}} retiled in the 1980s, with murals {{designed}} by Allan Drummond that reference the British Museum. These murals reference Egyptian and Roman antiquities, with sarcophagi, statues and trompe-l'œil columns <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> platform.|$|E
25|$|In {{at least}} two instances, the images of {{deceased}} Anglican clergymen allegedly appeared <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> their church. In 1902, {{the image of a}} Dean Vaughan allegedly appeared <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> Llandaff cathedral, while the image of Dean Henry Liddell allegedly appeared <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> Christ Church, Oxford in 1923.|$|R

5|$|A granite wall {{surrounds}} the temple, enclosing all its shrines and six of its seven bodies of water. The rajagopuram, the temple's gateway tower, is unfinished. A swastika shaped temple tank built in 800 AD by Kamban Araiyan {{during the reign}} of Dantivarman is outside the temple complex. The Vijayanagar and Nayak kings commissioned paintings <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shrine of Pudarikakshan, some of which are still present.|$|E
5|$|Although Warren {{departed}} soon afterwards leaving just a frigate squadron behind, {{the siege}} continued throughout August. French forces dominated Elba but {{were unable to}} make an impression <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fortress while Royal Navy forces controlled access to the island by sea, providing supplies for the defenders and denying them to the French. Halsted and Phoenix maintained a blockade of the port of Piombino on the Italian mainland, ensuring the interception of French supplies.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Loring's bombers {{were placed}} on alert after Soviet {{submarines}} were spotted {{off the coast of}} the region. The base was briefly mentioned in the 1983 movie WarGames, although the film erroneously listed Loring as being home to the 43rd Bombardment Wing. In 1982, the base was hit by two earthquakes, which damaged the base hospital and caused cracks to appear <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> control tower.|$|E

5|$|Queen Zenobia Addressing her Soldiers by Giambattista Tiepolo; it {{dates to}} the early eighteenth century but the exact year is not known. This {{painting}} (part {{of a series of}} tableaux of Zenobia) was painted by Tiepolo <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Zenobio family palace in Venice, although they were unrelated to the queen.|$|E
5|$|The climate, {{and as a}} result, {{the flora}} and fauna, of Pinkham Notch varies greatly with elevation. As {{elevations}} increase <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> notch, climate and ecosystems change to those of increasingly northern occurrence. Biomes range from a low-elevation northern hardwood forest {{at the base of}} Mount Washington to alpine-Arctic vegetation near the summit comparable to vegetation found at the latitude of Labrador.|$|E
5|$|The larvae of the Sirex {{woodwasp}} {{are almost}} colourless and only have three stub-shaped pairs of sterna. They cut through host wood with their powerful mandibles. They have a pointed, dark tip at their rear end, which presses the drilling dust <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> borehole. They closely resemble other larvae in the genus Sirex.|$|E
5000|$|The {{issue was}} raised {{again at the}} Summit in 1886 and {{it was decided that}} the door of the [...] "Zulfugar Khan Gate" [...] <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second castle was to be built next to the Shah Abbas gate, which was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first fortress.|$|R

5|$|The {{main bar}} {{was large and}} black, with black and white zebra-patterned {{wallpaper}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> room. An indoor waterfall surrounded by imitation exotic vegetation stood in the back. The club's main showroom, the Vermilion Room, often featured the likes of Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr., and the slapstick comedy duo of Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{took place}} during the first months of 2006. The main hurdle came up with the location. Barjatya wanted to shoot film in an {{authentic}} way. He asked the film's art director Sanjay Dhobade to create the entire town of Madhupur that can give a realistic look, particularly portions where water leaking takes place and portions where spit marks were visible <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> buildings in the film. Later, the town was created in film city, Mumbai. Outdoor session of the film was done in Delhi, Lonavla, Ranikhet, Nainital and Almora.|$|E
5|$|Gills are adnate with a decurrent tooth (where {{the gills}} curve up {{to join the}} stipe but then, close to the stipe, the margin turns down again), and {{initially}} narrow but broaden when old. They are pallid to grayish-olive with bright orange edges. Smith noted that the edge color may spread to the gill faces in some specimens, because the pigment, rather than being encrusted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cystidia, {{is found in the}} cytosol and therefore more readily diffusible. The gills are spaced close together, with between 16 and 26 gills reaching the stipe, and there are up to three tiers of interspersed lamellulae (short gills that do not extend fully from the cap edge to the stipe).|$|E

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1938, van Meegeren moved to Nice, using the {{proceeds}} {{from the sale of}} The Supper at Emmaus to buy a 12-bedroom estate at Les Arènes de Cimiez. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> estate hung several genuine Old Masters. Two of his better forgeries were made here, Interior with Cardplayers and Interior with Drinkers, both displaying the signature of Pieter de Hooch. During his time in Nice, he painted his Last Supper I in the style of Vermeer.|$|E
5|$|It is {{also worth}} noticing {{that in the}} early 16th century one of the houses which predated the palace hosted an osteria. In the late 1510s Raphael, at that time {{painting}} the Vatican loggias, often had lunch together with his aides in a rear room of that eatery. The artists often discussed work problems during lunch, sketching different solutions <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> room. When the palace was built, the osteria remained in place, and the owners always took care of the walls of that room throughout the years.|$|E
5|$|Orientation {{behaviour}} {{studies have}} been traditionally carried out using variants of a setup known as the Emlen funnel, which consists of a circular cage with the top covered by glass or wire-screen so that either the sky is visible or the setup is placed in a planetarium or with other controls on environmental cues. The orientation behaviour of the bird inside the cage is studied quantitatively using the distribution of marks that the bird leaves <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cage. Other approaches used in pigeon homing studies {{make use of the}} direction in which the bird vanishes on the horizon.|$|E

5|$|Parashurameshvara Temple {{was built}} by the Shailodbhavas, who had Shiva as their family deity. The Shailodbhavas also {{respected}} the Shakta deities and depicted Shakta images <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> temple. The temple was repaired in 1903, with {{some changes in the}} roof of the inner sanctum, whilst retaining most of the original structure. Being located in the eastern coast, Parashurameshvara, like other Orissan temples, was not much affected by Muslim invasions of the 12–13th centuries. In modern times, the temple is maintained and administered by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) as a ticketed monument.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the capital}} Halab {{has not been}} excavated, the {{architecture}} of the kingdom is archaeologically best represented by the city of Alalakh, which was subordinate to Halab and ruled by a king belonging to the Yamhadite royal house. The Amorites in general built large palaces that bear architectural similarities to old Baylonian-era palaces. They were adorned with grand central courtyards, throne rooms, tiled floors, drainage systems and plastered walls, which suggest the employment of specialized labor. Evidence exists for the presence of Minoan Aegean fresco artists who painted elaborate scenes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> palaces in Alalakh.|$|E
5|$|The colour of the {{spore print}} is brownish, with pink, reddish, or rosy tints. Spores are {{somewhat}} fuse-shaped, smooth, and measure 11–17 by 3–5µm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 18–25.6 by 7.0–10.2µm. Cystidia <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tubes (pleurocystidia) are fuse-shaped {{with a central}} swelling, thin-walled, and have granular contents. They possess sharp to tapered tips, and have overall dimensions of 36–44 by 8.0–11.0µm. On the pore edges, the cheilocystidia are similar in shape to the pleurocystidia, measuring 24.8–44.0 by 7.3–11.0µm. The hymenium of Smith and Thiers's variety uliginosus, when mounted in Melzer's reagent, shows reddish globules of pigment measuring 2–8µm that appear in the hyphae and throughout the hymenium, and a large (8–12µm) globule in the pleurocystidia.|$|E
