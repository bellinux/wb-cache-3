Probably this kind of compressor is more adapted than the piston technology owing to their mechanical system. In this paper, we present the challenge of vapor injection realized on piston technology compressor range non for improving the cooling capacity of the system but to maintain the compressor temperature in conformity without damage the capacity. Indeed, the principal action of gas injection is to refresh the mechanical system according to the ambient temperature for improving {{the capacity of the}} system. In this case of study, the compressor is enclosure on a room without opening at the ambient, thus the temperature of the compressor exceed 130 °C, which is the limit temperature of compressor functioning. To reduce the compressor temperature on this refrigerant cycle a gas injection is done from output of condenser to the input of the compressor thanks to the capillary tubes. Therefore, the quantity of gas injection must be sufficient to reduce the temperature, and not damage the capacity of the system. In addition, the piston technology compressor is more sensitive than the <b>others</b> <b>compressors</b> technologies because the compressor valve behavior could be damaged by the liquid phase of the refrigerant.

Another improvement came with so-called Dense codes, which proved to be very fast in compression and decompression while keeping a good compression ratio and direct search capability. Many variants of the Dense codes have been described, each of them using its own definition. In this paper, we present a generalized concept of dense coding called Open Dense Code (ODC), which aims to be a frame for the definition of many other dense code schemas. ODC underlines common features of the dense code schemas {{but at the same time}} allows one to express the divergences of each of them. Using the frame of ODC, we present two new word-based statistical compression algorithms based on the dense coding idea: Two Byte Dense Code (TBDC) and Self-Tuning Dense Code (STDC).

However, fatigue failure of an impeller without a known source of excitation soon after initial start-up was followed by an identical failure about four years later in the same constant speed machine. Concurrently, an impeller failed by fatigue in a turbine driven process compressor after about seven years of satisfactory operation. These failures led to extensive testing and quality control programs at several manufacturers? plants for both new equipment and replacement impellers plus a revitalized series of field tests to identify the excitation sources. Shaker testing and field testing were effective in determining that, while the resonant frequencies and modal patterns may not correspond with any known source of excitation, the fluid flow at various load and speed conditions can excite a resonance and lead to failure.

40|$|Multi-stage {{centrifugal}} compressors, {{used for}} air-conditioning applications, are traditionally designed to have near-identical impeller tip diameters. Â Â This kind of design can ensure even work delivered into refrigerant gas by each stage. Â This design simplification may have profound drawbacks on compressor efficiency, especially for chillers using an economizer cycle, where {{each stage of}} compression deals with an increasing mass flow rate. For those multiple stage centrifugal compressors connected with economized cycle chillers, {{the flow of the}} later stage of the compressor is merged with the flow from the economizer. Therefore, the flow rate for each stage will be much different at any given time. Non-equal impeller diameters will thus show performance advantages. Â A possible reason for benefit of non-equal diameters is to put more work into higher efficiency stages. Â Â This paper will show that, by removing this design constraint and judiciously size each stage tip diameter, compressor efficiency can be improved by ?. ?% (TBD in final draft, possible value is about 2. 4 %) on average.

40|$|Over {{the last}} few years, the {{technology}} of mobile phones greatly got increased. People gain and upload more and more information through their mobile phones in an easy way. Accordingly, a new sensing technology emerges, referred to as public sensing (PS). The core idea behind PS is to exploit the crowdedness of smart mobile devices to opportunistically provide real-time sensor data considering spatial and environmental dimensions. Recently, PS has been applied in many different application scenarios, such as environmental monitoring, traffic analysis, and indoor mapping. However, PS applications face several challenges. One {{of the most prominent}} challenges is the users acceptance to participate in the PS applications. In order to convince users to participate in the PS applications, several incentives mechanisms have been developed. However, the main two requirements - which should be met by any PS application - are the users privacy and the energy costs of running the PS application. In fact, there exist several energy consumers in PS applications. For example, many PS applications require the mobile devices to fix their position and frequently send this position data to the PS server. Similarly, the mobile devices waste energy when they receive sensing queries outside the sensing areas. However, the most energy-expensive task is to frequently acquire and send data to the PS server. In this thesis, we tackle the problem of energy consumption in a special category of PS applications in which the participating mobile devices are periodically queried for sensor data, such as acceleration and images. To reduce the energy overhead of uploading lots of information, we exploit the fact that processing approximately one thousand instructions consumes energy equal to that of transmitting one bit of information. Accordingly, we exploit data compression {{to reduce the number of}} bit that will be transmitted from the participating mobile devices to the PS server. Although, he technical literature has many compression methods, such as derivative-based prediction, Cosine transform, Wavelet transform; we designed a framework based on the compressive sensing (CS) theory. In the last decade, CS has been proven as a promising candidate for compressing N-dimensional data. Moreover, it shows satisfactory results when used for inferring missing data. Accordingly, we exploit CS to compress 1 D data (e. g. acceleration, gravity) and 2 D data (e. g. images). To efficiently utilize the CS method on resources-taxed devices such as the smart mobile devices, we start with identifying the most lightweight measurements matrices which will be implemented on the mobile devices. We examine several matrices, such as the random measurement matrix, the random Gaussian matrix, and the Toeplitz matrix. Our analysis mainly bases on the recovery accuracy and the dissipated energy from the mobile device's battery. Additionally, we perform a comparative study with <b>other</b> <b>compressors,</b> including the cosine transform and the lossless ZIP compressor. To further confirm that CS has a high recovery accuracy, we implemented an activity recognition algorithm at the server side. To this end, we exploit the dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm as a pattern matching tool between a set of stored patterns and the recovered data. Several experiments have been performed which show the high accuracy of both CS and DTW to recover several activities such as walking, running, and jogging. In terms of energy, CS significantly reduce the battery consumption relative to the other baseline compressors. Finally, we prove the possibility of exploiting the CS-based compression method for manipulating 1 D data as well as 2 D data, i. e. images. The main challenge is to perform image encoding on the mobile devices, despite the complex matrix operations between the image pixels and the sensing matrices. To overcome this problem, we divide the image into a number of cells and subsequently, we perform the encoding process on each cell individually. Accordingly, the compression process is iteratively achieved. The evaluation results show promising results for 2 D compression-based on the CS theory in terms of the saved energy consumption and the recovery accuracy...|$|E
