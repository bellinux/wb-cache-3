5|$|Champollion, {{a liberal}} and {{progressive}} minded man, {{lived in a}} period of political turmoil in France which continuously threatened to disrupt his research in various ways. During the Napoleonic wars he was able to avoid conscription, but his Napoleonic allegiances meant that he was considered suspect by the subsequent Royalist regime. His <b>own</b> <b>actions,</b> sometimes brash and reckless, did not help his case. His relations with important political and scientific figures of the time, such as Joseph Fourier and Silvestre de Sacy helped him, although in some periods he lived exiled from the scientific community.|$|E
5|$|First, {{let me say}} I {{take full}} {{responsibility}} for my <b>own</b> <b>actions</b> {{and for those of}} my administration. As angry as I may be about activities undertaken without my knowledge, I am still accountable for those activities. As disappointed as I may be in some who served me, I'm still the one who must answer to the American people for this behavior.|$|E
5|$|Maeser {{was very}} strict, and {{students}} that attended the Academy had {{to adhere to}} a standard of moral conduct. Students were required to follow the Word of Wisdom. However, they were accountable for their <b>own</b> <b>actions</b> under the honor system. Maeser also established training courses for teachers. He also kept parents informed and sent monthly reports {{to them on the}} progress of their children.|$|E
40|$|An isotone pure {{strategy}} equilibrium exists in any game of incomplete information {{in which each}} player's action set is a finite sublattice of multidimensional Euclidean space, types are multidimensional and atomless, and each player's interim expected payoff function satisfies two "nonprimitive conditions" whenever others adopt isotone pure strategies: (i) single-crossing in <b>own</b> <b>action</b> and type and (ii) quasi-supermodularity in <b>own</b> <b>action.</b> Conditions (i), (ii) are satisfied in supermodular and log-supermodular games given affiliated types,and in games with independent types in which each player's ex post payoff satisfies supermodularity in <b>own</b> <b>action</b> and nondecreasing differences in <b>own</b> <b>action</b> and type. This result is applied to provide the first proof of {{pure strategy}} equilibrium existence in the uniform price auction when bidders have multi-unit demand, nonprivate values, and independent types.

5|$|Sheindlin's ongoing {{syndicated}} court show, Judge Judy, debuted on September 16, 1996, {{and began}} celebrating its 20th anniversary on Monday, September 14, 2015. The court show's present 22nd season commenced on September 11, 2017. Sheindlin {{has stated that}} her show's primary goal is to motivate the public {{to do the right}} thing, and to show that each individual must take responsibility for his/her <b>own</b> <b>actions.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Twittys {{and their}} {{supporters}} criticized a perceived lack of progress by Aruban police. The Twittys' <b>own</b> <b>actions</b> in Aruba were also criticized, and the Twittys were accused of actively stifling any evidence that might impugn Holloway's character by asking her fellow students to remain silent about the case and using their access to the media to push {{their own version of}} events. The Twittys denied this.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} time, the U.S. was {{planning}} its <b>own</b> <b>actions</b> against bin Laden. Michael Scheuer, {{chief of the}} CIA's bin Laden unit (Alec Station), considered using local Afghans to kidnap bin Laden, then exfiltrate him from Afghanistan in a modified Lockheed C-130 Hercules. Documents recovered from Wadih el-Hage's Nairobi computer suggested a link between bin Laden and the deaths of U.S. troops in Somalia. These were used {{as the foundation for}} the June 1998 New York indictment of bin Laden, although the charges were later dropped. The planned raid was cancelled in May after internecine disputes between officials at the FBI and the CIA; the hesitation of the National Security Council (NSC) to approve the plan; concerns over the raid's chance of success, and the potential for civilian casualties.|$|E

5|$|Members of the Spirit Fruit Society lived {{according}} to the following basic principles: seek happiness through selflessness; follow one's conscience; take responsibility for one's actions—and develop {{an awareness of the}} consequences of one's actions on others; and accept whatever happens. Beilhart believed very strongly in the individual's right to guide his <b>own</b> <b>actions,</b> and not be dictated to by others. While {{there was no mention of}} any kind of organization or hierarchy in any documents, as the leader, Beilhart likely made important decisions concerning the group. There is no record of any kind of internal conflict between members.|$|E
5|$|Besides these {{international}} initiatives, {{some countries}} {{are taking their}} <b>own</b> <b>actions.</b> New Zealand has banned the taking of manta rays since {{the introduction of the}} Wildlife Act in 1953. In June 1995, the Maldives banned the export of all ray species and their body parts, effectively putting a stop to manta fishing as there had not previously been a fishery for local consumption. The government reinforced this in 2009 with the introduction of two marine protected areas. In the Philippines, the taking of mantas was banned in 1998, but this was overturned in 1999 under pressure from local fishermen. Fish stocks were surveyed in 2002, and the ban was reintroduced. The taking or killing of mantas in Mexican waters was prohibited in 2007. This ban may not be strictly enforced, but laws are being more rigidly applied at Isla Holbox, an island off the Yucatán Peninsula, where manta rays are used to attract tourists.|$|E
5|$|Women {{had limited}} access to formal {{education}} and girls benefited less than boys from {{the expansion of the}} parish school system. Some women were taught reading, domestic tasks, but often not writing. In noble households some received a private education and some female literary figures emerged from the seventeenth century. Religion may have been particularly important as a means of expression for women and from the seventeenth century women may have had greater opportunities for religious participation in movements outside of the established kirk. Women had very little legal status {{at the beginning of the}} period, unable to act as witnesses or legally responsible for their <b>own</b> <b>actions.</b> From the mid-sixteenth century they were increasingly criminalised, with statutes allowing them to be prosecuted for infanticide and as witches. Seventy-five per cent of an estimated 6,000 individuals prosecuted for witchcraft between 1563 and 1736 were women and perhaps 1,500 were executed. As a result, some historians have seen this period as characterised by increasing concern with women and attempts to control and constrain them.|$|E

40|$|In {{his article}} "On {{the theory of}} effectived emand" (Green, 1980, Economic Journal), J. Green deals with a class of {{stochastic}} rationing schemes whose distribution as perceived by the individual agent depends on his <b>own</b> <b>action</b> and on the aggregate values of demand and supply only. Under certain assumptions the expectation of such a rationing function is claimed to be linear in each agent's <b>own</b> <b>action,</b> provided there are three or more agents (theorem p. 345). However, as will be shown in this note, the theorem is correct only for four or more agents...|$|R

5|$|McCann was {{the first}} member of the 10th Battalion to be awarded the Military Cross, and was also the first unit officer to receive an award in the field for any {{specific}} action. The wound to his head had severely fractured his skull, but he remained at his post until he had reported the situation to the commanding officer of the 9th Battalion. He was evacuated to hospital in England, and his award of the Military Cross was reported in the Adelaide Advertiser newspaper on 29 September along with a photograph and brief details of his service. After he had recovered sufficiently, he attended an investiture at Buckingham Palace on 4 October where he received his Military Cross from King George V. On the same day, a fellow 10th Battalion officer, Arthur Blackburn, received his Victoria Cross for his <b>own</b> <b>actions</b> at Pozières that closely followed those of McCann. McCann was medically classified to be returned to Australia on a hospital ship, but avoided these orders and returned to his battalion in France in November. On his return, he was placed in command of B Company. In February 1917 he was evacuated suffering from illness, and after recovering was sent to a training school for a month. He rejoined the battalion in March.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before the}} senior Bowie died circa 1820, he gave ten slaves {{as well as}} horses and cattle to both James and Rezin. For the next seven years, the {{brothers}} worked together to develop several large estates in Lafourche Parish and Opelousas. Louisiana's population was growing rapidly, and the brothers hoped {{to take advantage of}} its rising land prices through speculation. Without the capital required to buy large tracts, they entered into a partnership with pirate Jean Lafitte in 1818 to raise money. By then, the United States had outlawed the importation of slaves, and most southern states allowed anyone who informed on a slave trader to receive half of what the imported slaves would earn at auction as a reward. Bowie made three trips to Lafitte's compound on Galveston Island. On each occasion, he bought smuggled slaves and took them directly to a customhouse to inform on his <b>own</b> <b>actions.</b> When the customs officers offered the slaves for auction, Bowie purchased them and received back half the price he had paid, as allowed by the state laws. He then could legally transport the slaves and resell them at a greater market value in New Orleans or areas farther up the Mississippi River. Using this scheme, the brothers collected $65,000 to be used for their land speculation.|$|E
