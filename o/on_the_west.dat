5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, Charles Horton Peck had {{reported}} A.phalloides in North America.

By the 1970s, it had become clear that A.phalloides does occur in the United States, apparently having been introduced from Europe alongside chestnuts, with populations <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>West</b> and East Coasts. Although a 2006 historical review concluded the East Coast populations were introduced, the origins of the West Coast populations remained unclear, due to scant historical records. A 2009 genetic study provided strong evidence for the introduced status of the fungus <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>west</b> coast of North America.|$|E
