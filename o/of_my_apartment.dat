It debuted on March 16, 2004, on BET's Access Granted. Intended to resemble Brooklyn, New York, the video was shot in Los Angeles. It portrays Jackson traveling through the city at night to meet her boyfriend, interacting with the various people she encounters along the way. Jackson commented that the video was simple, {{and there was not}} a major production for wardrobe, hair and makeup. Explaining its concept, she stated [...] "I'm coming out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>apartment</b> building and walking down the street, and you see all the goings-on in the neighborhood." [...] Jackson praised Meyers as a director, saying [...] "I think he's a wonderful director and he's a good friend, we've been friends since the [...] "All for You" [...] video. He has a great eye." [...] Hollywood casting agents sought a wide variety of extras, ranging from teenage delinquents to mothers picking up her babies and children from day care, and other people commuting by bus to and from work. The video was desired to have an intimate [...] "community" [...] feel. Meyers stated: ...|$|E

"Inconveniencies {{are often}} {{balanced}} by some advantage: the elevation <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>apartments</b> furnished {{a subject for}} conversation, which, without some such help, {{we should have been}} in danger of wanting.

Miss Airy ran to the window, and thought it charming to see the walkers so little in the street; and Miss Gentle went to try the same experiment, and screamed to find herself so far above the ground." ...|$|R
60|$|Theodore {{had shown}} him in. Ah! have I not {{mentioned}} the fact that I had forgiven Theodore his lies and his treachery, and taken him back to my bosom and to my board? My sensitive heart had again got the better <b>of</b> <b>my</b> prudence, and Theodore was installed once more in the antechamber <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>apartments</b> in the Rue Daunou, and was, as heretofore, sharing with me {{all the good things}} that I could afford. So there he was on duty on that fateful first of April which was destined to be the turning-point <b>of</b> <b>my</b> destiny. And he showed M. de Rochez in.|$|R
6000|$|... "We'll {{begin with}} the spin through the Park, anyhow," [...] I said. I was choking with the hot, stale air <b>of</b> <b>my</b> little <b>apartment,</b> and I wanted that breath of the cool to brace me for the task <b>of</b> proving to <b>my</b> friend that New York was the greatest--and so forth.|$|R
60|$|I {{mounted the}} stairs with a heavy step and opened the outer door <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>apartment</b> with my private key; and then, Sir, I assure you that for one brief moment I felt that my knees were giving way under me and that I should {{presently}} measure my full length on the floor.|$|E
60|$|I {{shall not}} detain the reader, however, with any further {{description}} <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>apartment,</b> {{or of the}} mysteries connected with it.

60|$|There {{was rather}} a sickly smell (not at all an unusual {{fragrance}} in Paris) {{in the little}} ante-room <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>apartment</b> at the hotel. The large dark creature in the Morgue was by no direct experience associated with my sense of smell, because, when I came to the knowledge of him, he lay behind a wall of thick plate-glass {{as good as a}} wall of steel or marble for that matter. Yet the whiff of the room never failed to reproduce him. What was more curious, was the capriciousness with which his portrait seemed to light itself up in my mind, elsewhere. I might be walking in the Palais Royal, lazily enjoying the shop windows, and might be regaling myself with one of the ready-made clothes shops that are set out there. My eyes, wandering over impossible-waisted dressing-gowns and luminous waistcoats, would fall upon the master, or the shopman, or even the very dummy at the door, and would suggest to me, 'Something like him!'--and instantly I was sickened again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ha, Gaston," [...] {{said the}} boy, {{advancing}} towards me, [...] "our host {{tells me that}} two ladies who have been shipwrecked here wish to do me the honour <b>of</b> occupying <b>my</b> <b>apartments</b> {{for an hour or}} so. Ha, there they are," [...] he added, as the two girls came suddenly forward. Then bowing--"Mesdames, I am enchanted to set the poor room at your disposal {{for as long as it}} may please you to honour it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In {{silence and}} in {{trembling}} the wonderful portrait was suspended over the fireplace <b>of</b> <b>my</b> aunt's favourite <b>apartment.</b> The {{next day they}} received letters from Max. He was quite well, but mentioned nothing of the mysterious painting.|$|R
60|$|As it was, I found {{just the}} right words of {{consolation}} and of hope wherewith to bow my brilliant client out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> humble <b>apartments,</b> and then to settle down to deep and considered meditation. Nothing, Sir, is so conducive to thought as a long, brisk walk through the crowded streets of Paris. So I brushed my coat, put on my hat at a becoming angle, and started on my way.|$|R
6000|$|These were {{my first}} reflections, but I {{soon learned that}} Mr. Kirwin had shown me extreme kindness. He had caused the best room in the prison to be {{prepared}} for me (wretched indeed was the best); and it was he who had provided a physician and a nurse. It is true, he seldom came to see me, for although he ardently desired to relieve the sufferings of every human creature, he did not wish to be present at the agonies and miserable ravings of a murderer. He came, therefore, sometimes to see that I was not neglected, but his visits were short and with long intervals. One day, while I was gradually recovering, I was seated in a chair, my eyes half open and my cheeks livid like those in death. I was overcome by gloom and misery and often reflected I had better seek death than desire to remain in a world which to me was replete with wretchedness. At one time I considered whether I should not declare myself guilty and suffer the penalty of the law, less innocent than poor Justine had been. Such were my thoughts when the door <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>apartment</b> was opened and Mr. Kirwin entered. His countenance expressed sympathy and compassion; he drew a chair close to mine and addressed me in French, [...] "I fear that this place is very shocking to you; can I do anything to make you more comfortable?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{month of}} {{courtship}} had wasted: its very last hours were being numbered. There was no putting off {{the day that}} advanced--the bridal day; and all preparations for its arrival were complete. I, at least, had nothing more to do: there were my trunks, packed, locked, corded, ranged in a row along the wall of my little chamber; to-morrow, at this time, they would be far on their road to London: and so should I (D.V.),--or rather, not I, but one Jane Rochester, a person whom as yet I knew not. The cards of address alone remained to nail on: they lay, four little squares, in the drawer. Mr. Rochester had himself written the direction, [...] "Mrs. Rochester, --- Hotel, London," [...] on each: I could not persuade myself to affix them, or to have them affixed. Mrs. Rochester! She did not exist: {{she would not be}} born till to-morrow, some time after eight o'clock a.m.; and I would wait to be assured she had come into the world alive before I assigned to her all that property. It was enough that in yonder closet, opposite my dressing-table, garments said to be hers had already displaced my black stuff Lowood frock and straw bonnet: for not to me appertained that suit of wedding raiment; the pearl-coloured robe, the vapoury veil pendent from the usurped portmanteau. I shut the closet to conceal the strange, wraith-like apparel it contained; which, at this evening hour--nine o'clock--gave out certainly a most ghostly shimmer through the shadow <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>apartment.</b> [...] "I will leave you by yourself, white dream," [...] I said. [...] "I am feverish: I hear the wind blowing: I will go out of doors and feel it." ...|$|E
6000|$|The time of {{probation}} passed slowly, unmarked by any accident whatever. I went and came, and disposed {{of my time}} as I pleased, without question or criticism {{on the part of}} my father. Indeed, I rarely saw him, save at meal-times, when he studiously avoided a discussion which you may well suppose I was in no hurry to press onward. Our conversation was of the news of the day, or on such general topics as strangers discourse upon to each other; nor could any one have guessed, from its tenor, that there remained undecided betwixt us a dispute of such importance. It haunted me, however, more than once, like the nightmare. Was it possible he would keep his word, and disinherit his only son in favour of a nephew whose very existence he was not perhaps quite certain of? My grandfather's conduct, in similar circumstances, boded me no good, had I considered the matter rightly. But I had formed an erroneous idea of my father's character, from the importance which I recollected I maintained with him and his whole family before I went to France. I was not aware that there are men who indulge their children at an early age, because to do so interests and amuses them, and who can yet be sufficiently severe when the same children cross their expectations at a more advanced period. On the contrary, I persuaded myself, that all I had to apprehend was some temporary alienation of affection--perhaps a rustication of a few weeks, which I thought would rather please me than otherwise, since it would give me an opportunity of setting about my unfinished version of Orlando Furioso, a poem which I longed to render into English verse. I suffered this belief to get such absolute possession of my mind, that I had resumed my blotted papers, and was busy in meditation on the oft-recurring rhymes of the Spenserian stanza, when I heard a low and cautious tap at the door <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>apartment.</b> [...] "Come in," [...] I said, and Mr. Owen entered. So regular were the motions and habits of this worthy man, that in all probability {{this was the first time}} he had ever been in the second story of his patron's house, however conversant with the first; and I am still at a loss to know in what manner he discovered my apartment.|$|E

5000|$|The Tetra Society {{was founded}} in 1987 in Vancouver, British Columbia, by quadriplegic Sam Sullivan. He recounts feeling trapped - not by his {{disability}} but by his inaccessible surroundings: “I couldn't use the washroom, shower, cook on my own. I couldn't even turn the doorknob to get out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own <b>apartment!</b> It wasn’t long before I found that I was not alone; there were many frustrated people struggling with things so basic {{that most people would}} never think twice about them.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Muley," [...] {{his master}} said, [...] "I have bought this Christian {{who has been}} brought in by Hassan the corsair. He {{is one of the}} knights who are the terrors of our coasts, but is, from what I hear, of a kind and humane disposition. I am told that he was a {{commander}} of one of their galleys, and though I should not have believed it had I only Hassan's word, I have heard from others that it was so. My wife has long desired to have a Christian slave, and as Allah has blessed my efforts it was but right that I should gratify her, though in truth I do not know what work I shall set him to do at present. Let him first have a bath, and see that he is clad decently, then let him have a good meal. I doubt if he has had one since he was captured. He has been sorely beaten by the corsair, and from no fault of his own, but only because he opposed the man's brutality to a child slave. If any of his wounds need ointment, see that he has it. When all is ready, bring him to the door <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>apartments,</b> in order that I may show to my wife that I have gratified her whim." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then {{there are}} long {{corridors}} defended by gusts of hot air; {{down the middle}} swoops a pale little girl on parlour skates. “Get out of my way!” she shrieks as she passes; she has ribbons in her hair and frills on her dress; she makes the tour of the immense hotel. I think of Puck, who put a girdle round the earth in forty minutes, and wonder what {{he said as he}} flitted by. A black waiter marches past me bearing a tray that he thrusts into my spine as he goes. It’s laden with large white jugs; they tinkle as he moves, and I recognise the unconsoling fluid. We’re dying of iced water, of hot air, of flaring gas. I sit in my room thinking of these things—this room of mine which is a chamber of pain. The walls are white and bare, they shine in the rays of a horrible chandelier of imitation bronze which depends {{from the middle of the}} ceiling. It flings a patch of shadow on a small table covered with white marble, of which the genial surface supports at the present moment the sheet of paper I thus employ for you; and when I go to bed (I like to read in bed, Harvard) it becomes an object of mockery and torment. It dangles at inaccessible heights; it stares me in the face; it flings the light on the covers of my book but not upon the page—the little French Elzevir I love so well. I rise and put out the gas—when my room becomes even lighter than before. Then a crude illumination from the hall, from the neighbouring room, pours through the glass openings that surmount the two doors <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>apartment.</b> It covers my bed, where I toss and groan; it beats in through my closed lids; it’s accompanied by the most vulgar, though the most human, sounds. I spring up to call for some help, some remedy; but there’s no bell and I feel desolate and weak. There’s only a strange orifice in the wall, through which the traveller in distress may transmit his appeal. I fill it with incoherent sounds, and sounds more incoherent yet come back to me. I gather at last their meaning; they appear to constitute an awful inquiry. A hollow impersonal voice wishes to know what I want, and the very question paralyses me. I want everything—yet I want nothing, nothing this hard impersonality can give! I want my little corner of Paris; I want the rich, the deep, the dark Old World; I want to be out of this horrible place. Yet I can’t confide all this to that mechanical tube; it would be of no use; a barbarous laugh would come up from the office. Fancy appealing in these sacred, these intimate moments to an “office”; fancy calling out into indifferent space for a candle, for a curtain! I pay incalculable sums in this dreadful house, and yet haven’t a creature to assist me. I fling myself back on my couch and for a long time afterwards the orifice in the wall emits strange murmurs and rumblings. It seems unsatisfied and indignant and is evidently scolding me for my vagueness. My vagueness indeed, dear Harvard! I loathe their horrible arrangements—isn’t that definite enough? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Two {{or three}} times during the last {{fortnight}} I heard, at a late hour in the night or {{very early in the}} morning, a flageolet play the little Hindu tune to which your daughter is so partial. I thought for some time that some tuneful domestic, whose taste for music was laid under constraint during the day, chose that silent hour to imitate the strains which he had caught up by the ear during his attendance in the drawing-room. But last night I sat late in my study, which is immediately under Miss Mannering's apartment, and to my surprise I not only heard the flageolet distinctly, but satisfied myself that it came from the lake under the window. Curious to know who serenaded us at that unusual hour, I stole softly to the window <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>apartment.</b> But there were other watchers than me. You may remember, Miss Mannering preferred that apartment on account of a balcony which opened from her window upon the lake. Well, sir, I heard the sash of her window thrown up, the shutters opened, and her own voice in conversation with some person who answered from below. This is not [...] "Much ado about nothing"; I could not be mistaken in her voice, and such tones, so soft, so insinuating; and, to say the truth, the accents from below were in passion's tenderest cadence too,--but of the sense I can say nothing. I raised the sash of my own window that I might hear something more than the mere murmur of this Spanish rendezvous; but, though I used every precaution, the noise alarmed the speakers; down slid the young lady's casement, and the shutters were barred in an instant. The dash of a pair of oars in the water announced the retreat of the male person of the dialogue. Indeed, I saw his boat, which he rowed with great swiftness and dexterity, fly across the lake like a twelve-oared barge. Next morning I examined some of my domestics, as if by accident, and I found the gamekeeper, when making his rounds, had twice seen that boat beneath the house, with a single person, and had heard the flageolet. I did not care to press any farther questions, for fear of implicating Julia in the opinions of those of whom they might be asked. Next morning, at breakfast, I dropped a casual hint about the serenade of the evening before, and I promise you Miss Mannering looked red and pale alternately. I immediately gave the circumstance such a turn as might lead her to suppose that my observation was merely casual. I have since caused a watch-light to be burnt in my library, and have left the shutters open, to deter the approach of our nocturnal guest; and I have stated the severity of approaching winter, and the rawness of the fogs, as an objection to solitary walks. Miss Mannering acquiesced with a passiveness which is no part of her character, and which, to tell you the plain truth, is a feature about the business which I like least of all. Julia has too much of her own dear papa's disposition to be curbed in any of her humours, were there not some little lurking consciousness that it may be as prudent to avoid debate.|$|E
60|$|After this, {{for a long}} time, I {{never saw}} her, and I {{wondered}} that the common chances of the day should not have helped us to meet. It could only be evident that she was immensely on her guard against them; {{and in addition to}} this the house was so big that for each other we were lost in it. I used to look out for her hopefully as I crossed the sala in my comings and goings, but I was not rewarded with a glimpse of the tail of her dress. It was as if she never peeped out of her aunt's apartment. I used to wonder what she did there week after week and year after year. I had never encountered such a violent parti pris of seclusion; it was more than keeping quiet--it was like hunted creatures feigning death. The two ladies appeared to have no visitors whatever and no sort of contact with the world. I judged at least that people could not have come to the house and that Miss Tita could not have gone out without my having some observation of it. I did what I disliked myself for doing (reflecting that it was only once in a way): I questioned my servant about their habits and let him divine that I should be interested in any information he could pick up. But he picked up amazingly little for a knowing Venetian: it must be added that where there is a perpetual fast there are very few crumbs on the floor. His cleverness in other ways was sufficient, if it was not quite all that I had attributed to him on the occasion of my first interview with Miss Tita. He had helped my gondolier to bring me round a boatload of furniture; and when these articles had been carried {{to the top of the}} palace and distributed according to our associated wisdom he organized my household with such promptitude as was consistent with the fact that it was composed exclusively of himself. He made me in short as comfortable as I could be with my indifferent prospects. I should have been glad if he had fallen in love with Miss Bordereau's maid or, failing this, had taken her in aversion; either event might have brought about some kind of catastrophe, and a catastrophe might have led to some parley. It was my idea that she would have been sociable, and I myself on various occasions saw her flit to and fro on domestic errands, so that I was sure she was accessible. But I tasted of no gossip from that fountain, and I afterward learned that Pasquale's affections were fixed upon an object that made him heedless of other women. This was a young lady with a powdered face, a yellow cotton gown, and much leisure, who used often to come to see him. She practiced, at her convenience, the art of a stringer of beads (these ornaments are made in Venice, in profusion; she had her pocket full of them, and I used to find them on the floor <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>apartment),</b> and kept an eye on the maiden in the house. It was not for me of course to make the domestics tattle, and I never said a word to Miss Bordereau's cook.|$|E

6000|$|The scales have turned, my {{sympathetic}} Harvard, and {{the beam}} that has lifted you up has dropped me again on this terribly hard spot. I am extremely {{sorry to have}} missed you in London, but I received your little note, and took due heed of your injunction {{to let you know}} how I got on. I don't get on at all, my dear Harvard--I am consumed with the love of the farther shore. I have been so long away that I have dropped out of my place in this little Boston world, and the shallow tides of New England life have closed over it. I am a stranger here, and I {{find it hard to believe}} that I ever was a native. It is very hard, very cold, very vacant. I think of your warm, rich Paris; I think of the Boulevard St. Michel on the mild spring evenings. I see the little corner by the window (of the Cafe de la Jeunesse)--where I used to sit; the doors are open, the soft deep breath of the great city comes in. It is brilliant, yet there is a kind of tone, of body, in the brightness; the mighty murmur of the ripest civilisation in the world comes in; the dear old peuple de Paris, the most interesting people in the world, pass by. I have a little book in my pocket; it is exquisitely printed, a modern Elzevir. It is a lyric cry from the heart of young France, and is full of the sentiment of form. There is no form here, dear Harvard; I had no idea how little form there was. I don't know what I shall do; I feel so undraped, so uncurtained, so uncushioned; I feel as if I were sitting in the centre of a mighty [...] "reflector." [...] A terrible crude glare is over everything; the earth looks peeled and excoriated; the raw heavens seem to bleed with the quick hard light. I have not got back my rooms in West Cedar Street; they are occupied by a mesmeric healer. I am staying at an hotel, and it is very dreadful. Nothing for one's self; nothing for one's preferences and habits. No one to receive you when you arrive; you push in through a crowd, you edge up to a counter; you write your name in a horrible book, where every one may come and stare at it and finger it. A man behind the counter stares at you in silence; his stare seems to say to you, [...] "What the devil do YOU want?" [...] But after this stare he never looks at you again. He tosses down a key at you; he presses a bell; a savage Irishman arrives. [...] "Take him away," [...] he seems to say to the Irishman; but it is all done in silence; there is no answer to your own speech,--"What is to be done with me, please?" [...] "Wait and you will see," [...] the awful silence seems to say. There is a great crowd around you, but there is also a great stillness; every now and then you hear some one expectorate. There are a thousand people in this huge and hideous structure; they feed together in a big white-walled room. It is lighted by a thousand gas-jets, and heated by cast-iron screens, which vomit forth torrents of scorching air. The temperature is terrible; the atmosphere is more so; the furious light and heat seem to intensify the dreadful definiteness. When things are so ugly, they should not be so definite; and they are terribly ugly here. There is no mystery in the corners; there is no light and shade in the types. The people are haggard and joyless; they look as if they had no passions, no tastes, no senses. They sit feeding in silence, in the dry hard light; occasionally I hear the high firm note of a child. The servants are black and familiar; their faces shine as they shuffle about; there are blue tones in their dark masks. They have no manners; they address you, but they don't answer you; they plant themselves at your elbow (it rubs their clothes as you eat), and watch you as if your proceedings were strange. They deluge you with iced water; it's the only thing they will bring you; if you look round to summon them, they have gone for more. If you read the newspaper--which I don't, gracious Heaven! I can't--they hang over your shoulder and peruse it also. I always fold it up and present it to them; the newspapers here are indeed for an African taste. There are long corridors defended by gusts of hot air; down the middle swoops a pale little girl on parlour skates. [...] "Get out of my way!"

You asked me to tell you whom I see, and what I think of my friends. I haven't very many; I don't feel at all en rapport. The people are very good, very serious, very devoted to their work; but there is a terrible absence of variety of type. Every one is Mr. Jones, Mr. Brown; and every one looks like Mr. Jones and Mr. Brown. They are thin; they are diluted in the great tepid bath of Democracy! They lack completeness of identity; they are quite without modelling. No, they are not beautiful, my poor Harvard; it must be whispered that they are not beautiful. You may say that they are as beautiful as the French, as the Germans; but I can't agree with you there. The French, the Germans, have the greatest beauty of all--the beauty of their ugliness--the beauty of the strange, the grotesque. These people are not even ugly; they are only plain. Many of the girls are pretty; but to be only pretty is (to my sense) to be plain. Yet I have had some talk. I have seen a woman. She was on the steamer, and I afterward saw her in New York--a peculiar type, a real personality; a great deal of modelling, a great deal of colour, and yet a great deal of mystery. She was not, however, of this country; she was a compound of far-off things. But she was looking for something here--like me. We found each other, and for a moment that was enough. I have lost her now; I am sorry, because she liked to listen to me. She has passed away; I shall not see her again. She liked to listen to me; she almost understood! ...|$|E

A {{few months}} after the failure of the tragedy, as I counted up the remains <b>of</b> <b>my</b> fortune (the {{calculation}} was not long or difficult), I {{came to the conclusion that}} I must beat a retreat out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> pretty <b>apartments</b> in Bloomsbury, and so gave warning to our good landlady, informing her that my wife's health required that we should have lodgings in the country. But we went no farther than Lambeth, our faithful Gumbo and Molly following us; and here, though as poor as might be, we were waited on by a maid and a lackey in livery, like any folks of condition. You may be sure kind relatives cried out against our extravagance; indeed, are they not the people who find our faults out for us, and proclaim them to the rest of the world? ...|$|R
6000|$|At about midnight {{some mysterious}} impulse {{caused me to}} rise and peer through {{a window into the}} furnace-room, where I knew my father now slept. The fires were burning as brightly as if the {{following}} day's harvest had been expected to be abundant. One of the large cauldrons was slowly [...] "walloping" [...] with a mysterious appearance of self-restraint, as if it bided its time to put forth its full energy. My father was not in bed; he had risen in his night clothes and was preparing a noose in a strong cord. From the looks which he cast at the door <b>of</b> <b>my</b> mother's bedroom I knew too well the purpose that he had in mind. Speechless and motionless with terror, I could do nothing in prevention or warning. Suddenly the door <b>of</b> <b>my</b> mother's <b>apartment</b> was opened, noiselessly, and the two confronted each other, both apparently surprised. The lady, also, was in her night clothes, and she held in her right hand the tool of her trade, a long, narrow-bladed dagger.|$|R
40|$|My work {{explores the}} moments before falling asleep {{as well as}} my dreams, {{allowing}} my experiences and subconscious to emerge in the paintings. My bed has become my sanctuary and permeates my life and work. The tight confines <b>of</b> <b>my</b> studio <b>apartment</b> push all conceivable activity to, on, or around my bed. The paintings, in turn, have become a visual diary of the occurrences within this space, allowing me to explore a fundamental human experience <b>of</b> dreaming. <b>My</b> current work translates my experiences while I employ visual language from past work developed from observation. I combine techniques of drawing and painting on sheets of Tyvek measuring roughly the size <b>of</b> <b>my</b> bed. Working large in a life-size scale allows me to make use <b>of</b> <b>my</b> whole body to compose images. The layered forms and colors covering the surface of these works mine my observations that occur to me in a dream state. No longer restricted to the rules of the consciously observed form, the new pieces exhibit the inherent freedom <b>of</b> <b>my</b> subconscious. The gestural limbs of the figure exist in a state of restlessness. By placing patterns over the exterior of the bodies torsos the figures partially retreat to a space of internal contemplation...|$|R

I {{put it in}} the swamp where, of course, I had never lived. It was late as I was writing. I was trying to be a pure writer, no guitar in hand, visualizing and looking at the bare walls <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>apartment.</b> Tiny apartments have wonderful bare walls, especially when you can't afford to put anything on them. [...] "Chasing down a hoodoo." [...] Hoodoo is a magical, mystical, spiritual, non-defined apparition, like a ghost or a shadow, not necessarily evil, but certainly other-worldly. I was getting some of that imagery from Howlin' Wolf and Muddy Waters.|$|E

It debuted on March 16, 2004, on BET's Access Granted. Intended to resemble Brooklyn, New York, the video was shot in Los Angeles. It portrays Jackson traveling through the city at night to meet her boyfriend, interacting with the various people she encounters along the way. Jackson commented that the video was simple, {{and there was not}} a major production for wardrobe, hair and makeup. Explaining its concept, she stated [...] "I'm coming out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>apartment</b> building and walking down the street, and you see all the goings-on in the neighborhood." [...] Jackson praised Meyers as a director, saying [...] "I think he's a wonderful director and he's a good friend, we've been friends since the [...] "All for You" [...] video. He has a great eye." [...] Hollywood casting agents sought a wide variety of extras, ranging from teenage delinquents to mothers picking up her babies and children from day care, and other people commuting by bus to and from work. The video was desired to have an intimate [...] "community" [...] feel. Meyers stated: ...|$|E
40|$|My thesis {{projects}} {{point of}} departure is the immediate neighbourhood where I currently reside. Located {{at the corner of}} Hastings Street and Columbia, this region is significant as it straddles the line between two distinct zones of the city; not quite the downtown core and not entirely in the downtown eastside. This liminal space is host to a variety of jarring contrasts that impact both the lives of local residents, and the spaces they inhabit. My final work was designed to mimic the spatial dimensions <b>of</b> <b>my</b> micro-unit <b>apartment,</b> and reflect the various contradictions of modern urban living that surround my location: renewal/decay, wealthy/poor, public space/private space, healthy bodies/unhealthy bodies, formal/informal economies, and conformity/anarchy. In the following document, I discuss the decision-making process that resulted in my thesis exhibition, Here and There and Their and Here, and examine how Walter Benjamin’s theory of allegory, and Henri Lefebvre’s concept of Rhythmanalysis, can be brought into a critical alignment and actualized in contemporary installation art...|$|R
