40|$|This article {{argues that}} the nature and {{character}} <b>of</b> separation <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> <b>in</b> Australia has been fundamentally shaped and defined by the High Court, which chose a Blackstonian, common law conception of separation <b>of</b> judicial <b>powers</b> <b>in</b> preference to the principles elaborated in The Federalist and articulated in the American Constitution. But the Court's recent jurisprudence, including its admission that it makes the law, has presented unprecedented theoretical and political challenges {{to the concept of}} separation <b>of</b> judicial <b>power</b> <b>in</b> Australia, including a transformation {{in the role of the}} attorneygeneral, the creation of new institutions and a move towards an American conception of checks and balances. Thus this article suggests that the Court continues to exercise a profound influence on the formulation <b>of</b> separation <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> <b>in</b> Australia. No Full Tex...|$|R

5|$|The CPC has, since Jiang Zemin's time, made {{friendly}} overtures to its erstwhile foe, the Kuomintang. The CPC emphasizes strong party-to-party {{relations with}} the KMT so as to strengthen the probability of the reunification of Taiwan with mainland China. However, several studies have been written on the KMT's loss <b>of</b> <b>power</b> <b>in</b> 2000, after having ruled Taiwan since 1949 (the KMT officially ruled mainland China from 1928 to 1949). In general, one-party states or dominant-party states are of special interest to the party, and party-to-party relations are formed so that the CPC can study them. For instance, the longevity of the Syrian Regional Branch of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party is attributed to the personalization <b>of</b> <b>power</b> <b>in</b> the al-Assad family, the strong presidential system, the inheritance of power, which passed from Hafez al-Assad to his son Bashar al-Assad, and the role given to the Syrian military in politics.|$|E

40|$|Scholars {{have written}} {{volumes about the}} {{separation}} <b>of</b> <b>powers,</b> but they {{have focused on the}} administrative state and have wholly ignored the criminal state. Judges, too, have failed to distinguish criminal from administrative matters. So, the conventional wisdom has been that whatever theory works for the administrative state should work for anything else, including crime. And because most scholars and judges have supported a flexible or functional approach to separation <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> <b>in</b> the regulatory sphere, they have failed to see a problem with the functional approach when it comes to criminal matters. Indeed, the Supreme Court has been even more permissive <b>of</b> blending <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> <b>in</b> the criminal context than it has in cases involving non-penal laws. This Article shows why the existing functional approach to separation <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> <b>in</b> criminal matters cannot be squared with constitutional theory or sound institutional design. It explains that there are crucial differences between administrative and criminal matters {{when it comes to the}} separation <b>of</b> <b>powers.</b> Maintaining the separation <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> <b>in</b> criminal matters has strong roots in the Constitution’s text and structure. Moreover, unlike the administrative law context, where agencies must adhere to the structural and procedural protections of the Administrative Procedure Act and their decisions are subject to judicial review and political oversight, the government faces almost no institutional checks when it proceeds criminally. The only safeguards come from the individual rights provisions of the Constitution, but those act as poor safeguards against structural abuses and inequities. The current arrangement therefore takes the worst possible approach to separation <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> <b>in</b> the criminal context. The protection provided by the separation <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> is weakened, but nothing takes its place. As a result, the potential for government abuse is, perversely, greater in criminal proceedings than in regulatory matters. This Article therefore advocates more stringent enforcement of the separation <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> <b>in</b> criminal cases, where it is most needed. This approach would lead to different outcomes in the Court’s major separation <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> cases <b>in</b> criminal law and to a rethinking of its acceptance of plea bargaining...|$|R

The EF5 tornado that struck Hackleburg and Phil Campbell eventually damaged main power lines coming from Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant further to the northeast. These towers were the main supply of electrical power to much of North Alabama and some were without power for two weeks. The tornado just missed the Limestone Correctional Facility, which {{less than a year later}} would be struck by another tornado.|$|E
5|$|A {{subsequent}} {{investigation by}} the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) confirmed the aircraft had impacted birds during take-off.

5|$|After the Nazi seizure <b>of</b> <b>power</b> <b>in</b> 1933, Hess was {{appointed}} Deputy Führer of the NSDAP {{and received a}} post in Hitler's cabinet.

5|$|Already under Caliph al-Mu'tasim, senior Turkish leaders began being {{appointed}} as governors of provinces of the Caliphate {{as a form}} of appanage. Thereby they secured immediate access to the province's tax revenue for themselves and their troops, bypassing the civilian bureaucracy. The Turkish generals usually remained close to the centre <b>of</b> <b>power</b> <b>in</b> Samarra, sending deputies to govern in their name. Thus when al-Mu'tazz gave Bakbak charge of Egypt in 868, Bakbak in turn sent his stepson Ahmad as his lieutenant and resident governor. Ahmad ibn Tulun entered Egypt on 27 August 868, and the Egyptian capital, Fustat, on 15 September.|$|E

5|$|Although Kennan {{regarded}} the Soviet Union as {{too weak to}} risk war, he nonetheless considered it an enemy capable of expanding into Western Europe through subversion, given the popular support for Communist parties in Western Europe, which remained demoralized by the devastation of the Second World War. To counter this potential source of Soviet influence, Kennan's solution was to direct economic aid and covert political help to Japan and Western Europe to revive Western governments and assist international capitalism; by doing so the United States would help to rebuild the balance <b>of</b> <b>power.</b> <b>In</b> June 1948, Kennan proposed covert assistance to left-wing parties not oriented toward Moscow and to labor unions in Western Europe in order to engineer a rift between Moscow and working-class movements in Western Europe.|$|E
5|$|As {{the power}} and {{reputation}} of Pietro II grew, the Venetian people {{began to wonder if}} he was secretly planning to establish a hereditary monarchy. Their fears were confirmed when his son, Otto Orseolo (named after Otto III), assumed the title of Doge upon Pietro II's death in 1009, thereby becoming the youngest Doge in Venetian history at the age of 16. Scandal marked much of Otto's reign as he showed a clear inclination toward nepotism by elevating several relatives to positions <b>of</b> <b>power.</b> <b>In</b> 1026, he was deposed by his enemies and exiled to Constantinople, but his successor, Pietro Barbolano, had such difficulty in attempting to unite the city that it seemed infighting would once again seize Venice.|$|E
