25|$|Multiplex assays {{are used}} to {{simultaneously}} measure the presence, concentration, activity, <b>or</b> <b>quality</b> of multiple analytes in a single test.

25|$|Dry ice {{can be used}} {{to arrest}} and prevent insect {{activity}} in closed containers of grains and grain products, as it displaces oxygen, but does not alter the taste <b>or</b> <b>quality</b> of foods. For the same reason, it can prevent or retard food oils and fats from becoming rancid.|$|E
25|$|Stimulation of lean {{body mass}} and {{prevention}} of bone loss in elderly men, as some studies indicate.

There are two base technologies used {{to build}} MEMS resonators that differ in how electrical drive and sense signals are transduced from the mechanical motion. These are electrostatic and piezoelectric. All commercial MEMS oscillators use electrostatic transduction while MEMS filters use piezoelectric transduction. Piezoelectric resonators have not shown sufficient frequency stability <b>or</b> <b>quality</b> factor (Q) for frequency reference applications.|$|E
25|$|Allaire soon {{ran into}} supply {{problems}} with his new ironworks. With little demand in the United States for the high quality pig iron necessary for building marine steam engines, the local pig iron industry was in its infancy and unable to supply him with either the quantity <b>or</b> <b>quality</b> he required. The best quality pig iron was imported from the United Kingdom, but high tariffs made it too expensive to purchase.|$|E

25|$|Awareness: {{the state}} or ability to perceive, to feel, or to be {{conscious}} of events, objects, or sensory patterns. In this level of consciousness, sense data can be confirmed by an observer without necessarily implying understanding.

In biological psychology, awareness {{is defined as a}} human's or an animal's perception and cognitive reaction to a condition or event.|$|E
25|$|There are {{no formal}} {{requirements}} for standardization <b>or</b> <b>quality</b> control of dietary supplements in the United States, and the dosage of effective ingredients in supplements may vary widely from brand to brand or batch to batch. Studies of ephedra supplements have found significant discrepancies between the labeled dose {{and the actual}} amount of ephedra in the product. Significant variation in ephedrine alkaloid levels, {{by as much as}} 10-fold, was seen even from lot to lot within the same brand.|$|E
25|$|This {{framework}} {{allows for}} the separation between the reference to a given content (the CRID) and the necessary information to acquire it, which is called a “locator”.

There was no mechanism to bring the dog back to Earth, which died from heat exhaustion after five hours in space.|$|E
25|$|Cucumeropsis mannii {{can survive}} in {{nutrient}} poor soils in climatically diverse areas. The {{high degree of}} ground cover from this plant blankets the soil protecting it from sun exposure and water loss, and therefore increases {{the quality of the}} soil. The plant can thrive in humid, dry and upland areas with little to no consequence on growth <b>or</b> <b>quality</b> of crop. It is drought tolerant, thriving in West Africa’s dry regions, adapted to semiarid zones, and is also compatible with warmer tropical highlands.|$|E
25|$|There are {{substantial}} differences in funding, curricula, grading, and difficulty among U.S. secondary schools due to U.S. federalism, local control, and {{the prevalence of}} private, distance, and home schooled students. SAT (and ACT) scores are intended to supplement the secondary school record and help admission officers put local data—such as course work, grades, and class rank—in a national perspective. However, independent {{research has shown that}} high school GPA is better than the SAT at predicting college grades regardless of high school type <b>or</b> <b>quality.</b>|$|E
