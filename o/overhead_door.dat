50|$|<b>Overhead</b> <b>Doors</b> and Metal Buildings: MBMA {{has been}} working with the Door and Access System Manufacturers Association (DASMA) {{for the past several years}} to create better doors and {{openings}} for metal buildings. Five years of collaboration and research has focused on rolling steel <b>overhead</b> <b>doors</b> and the effects of wind on the doors and the building. As a result of this collective effort in the summer of 2010, DASMA released a technical guide to ensure that metal building framing can adequately support a rolling door.|$|R

2500|$|Manufacturing in Hartford City was {{different}} after World War II and the Korean War. [...] The glass factories {{of the area}} were no longer the most important employers, as {{most of them had}} shut down.

[...] In 1955, 3M (Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing), purchased the former (boom company) Hartford City Paper plant in Hartford City, and became one of the city's major employers. [...] Although the products have changed through the years, 3M still employs over 200 people at the Hartford City plant, which is currently (2009) a tape manufacturing facility.

The weight of the door may be 400 lb or more, but is balanced by either a torsion spring system or a pair of extension springs.
