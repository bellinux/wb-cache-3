5|$|Due to this {{extremely}} thin membranous tissue, a bat's wing {{can significantly}} {{contribute to the}} organism's total gas exchange efficiency. Because of the high energy demand of flight, the bat's body meets those demands by exchanging gas through the patagium of the wing. When the bat has its wing in an open/spread <b>out</b> <b>position</b> it allows {{for an increase in}} surface area to volume ratio. The surface area of the wings is about 85% of the total body surface area, suggesting the possibility of a useful amount of gas exchange. The subcutaneous vessels in the membrane very close to the surface allow for the diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide.|$|E

The eye will be displaced outward and displaced downward; outward because the lateral rectus (innervated by the sixth cranial nerve) maintains muscle tone in comparison to the paralyzed medial rectus. The eye will be displaced downward, because the superior oblique (innervated by the fourth cranial or trochlear nerve), is unantagonized by the paralyzed superior rectus, inferior rectus and inferior oblique. The affected individual will also have a ptosis, or drooping of the eyelid, and mydriasis (pupil dilation).|$|E

5000|$|The Telstar 28 has {{a number}} of {{distinguishing}} features, when comparing to the earlier versions as well as other foldable trimarans. Most notable is the folding mechanism for the amas. The amas fold in, by swiveling in and out alongside the main hull, reducing the beam from 18 ft to 8 ft 6 in, without extending the boat's overall length. The amas submerse approximately an additional four inches when retracted but retain their orientation to the main hull, so no additional surface is exposed to fouling if the amas were painted for the retracted waterline. This allows the boat to be berthed in a standard marina slip for extended period of time, eliminating one of the main problems facing trimaran owners. The folding mechanism is locked in the in or <b>out</b> <b>position</b> by a pair of line clutches in each cockpit locker, where one line controls the tension of the trampolines and the other actually locks the ama in position.|$|E

50|$|In {{some cases}} the lamp will be made of hand-blown glass and where the glass was blown, {{there is a small}} bubble that looks like a nipple. The {{position}} of the nipple is very important and if it’s facing the wrong way, it may damage the lamp. This 'nipple' is inherently the weakest part of the lamp and should thus be positioned so as to be exposed to the least amount of heat as possible. It is industry standard to position the nipple out, away from the reflector at back. Another reason for the “nipple out” position {{has more to do with}} the long glass stems on either end of the lamp. In those stems is a thin metal bar through which the electricity travels through. With the nipple <b>out</b> <b>position,</b> the metal bar is parallel with the light avoiding most of the heat. If the globe was rotated 90 degrees either way, the full surface of the metal bar would face the heat of the light from the reflector and potentially cause it to flex and damage the lamp.|$|E
50|$|The Pedalternorotandomovens Centroculatus Articulosus (curl-up) {{came into}} {{existence}} (spontaneous generation), because of the absence, in nature, of wheel shaped, living creatures {{with the ability to}} roll themselves forward. The accompanying 'beastie' depiction, referred to as 'revolving bitch' or 'roll paunch' in laymen's terms, subsequently anticipates the need with sensitivity. Biological details are still few: is it a mammal, a reptile, or an insect? It has a long, drawn-out, horned, sectioned body and three sets of legs; the ends of which look like the human foot. In the middle of the fat, round head, that is provided with a strong, bent parrots beak; they have bulb-shaped eyes, which, placed on posts, protrude far out {{from both sides of the}} head. In the stretched <b>out</b> <b>position,</b> the animal can, slow and cautiously, with the use of his six legs, move forward over a variety of terrains (it can potentially climb or descend steep stairs, plow through bushes, or scramble over boulders). However, when it must cover a great distance, and has a relatively flat path to his disposal, he pushes his head to the ground and rolls himself up with lightning speed, at which time he pushes himself off with his legs- for as much as they can still touch the ground. In the rolled up state it exhibits the form of a discus, of which the eye posts are the central axle. By pushing off alternately with one of his three pairs of legs, he can achieve great speeds. It is also sometimes desirable during the rolling (i.e. The descent of an incline, or coasting to a finish) to hold up the legs and 'freewheel' forward. Whenever it wants, it can return again to the walking position in two ways: first abruptly, by suddenly extending his body, but then it's lying on his back with his legs in the air, and second through gradual deceleration (braking with his feet) and slowly unrolling backwards in standing position.|$|E

30|$|The trap {{formation}} for Meishan {{submarine fans}} is {{mainly caused by}} the deposition pinching out (Fig.  8 d). As the entire basin subsided continuously in Neocene, the later differential regional tectonic subsidence affected the structural height. In Pliocene and Pleistocene, the subsidence centers transferred to the Ledong sag gradually, which led to terrain reversal, so the pinch <b>out</b> <b>position</b> of fans reworked by bottom currents became the highpoint of trap formation. Overall, deposition pinching out is the main controlled factor of submarine fan traps.|$|E

A systematic comparison between the theoretically observed twist in the freeze <b>out</b> <b>position</b> distribution and a mock experimental analysis of the model calculations via HBT correlations is shown.
