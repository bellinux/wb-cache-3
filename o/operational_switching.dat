40|$|The NASA Earth Science System Pathfinder (ESSP) mission Aquarius will measure global {{sea surface}} {{salinity}} with 100 -km spatial resolution every 8 days {{with an average}} monthly salinity accuracy of 0. 2 psu (parts per thousand). This requires an L-band low-noise radiometer with the long-term calibration stability of less than 0. 1 K over 8 days. This three-year research program on ultra stable radiometers has addressed the radiometer requirements and configuration necessary to achieve this objective for Aquarius and future ocean salinity missions. The system configuration and component performance have been evaluated with radiometer testbeds at both JPL and GSFC. The research has addressed several areas including component characterization {{as a function of}} temperature, a procedure for the measurement and correction for radiometer system non-linearity, noise diode calibration versus temperature, low noise amplifier performance over voltage, and temperature control requirements to achieve the required stability. A breadboard radiometer, utilizing microstrip-based technologies, has been built to demonstrate this long-term stability. This report also presents the results of the radiometer test program, a detailed radiometer noise model, and details of the <b>operational</b> <b>switching</b> sequence optimization {{that can be used to}} achieve the low noise and stability requirements. Many of the results of this research have been incorporated into the Aquarius radiometer design and will allow this instrument to achieve its goals...|$|E
40|$|Chemical process {{industries}} are constantly challenged to operate profitably and efficiently, {{despite the presence}} of significant uncertainties and disturbances on the operational conditions, and various operational limitations. The capability to meet the challenge relies on the quality of process control design, which should integrate the dynamic controllability characteristics in addition to the traditional economic considerations. The focus of this thesis is the development of a systematic controllability assessment framework for process control design. The framework addresses the controllability aspects in process and controller structures, as well as in time-domain dynamic performances. The aim is to provide clearer relationships between process profitability, controllability, and <b>operational</b> <b>switching</b> strategies in response to variations in the operating conditions. The skeleton of the framework is a mathematical optimisation algorithm. This algorithm considers the structural, operational and economic problems arising in process control design as a progressive, dynamic, and uncertain semi-infinite mixed integer nonlinear programming problem. The algorithm is an iterative, two-level optimisation, which determines the optimum process design and the associated controllability index within an optimisation window. The window progresses along a time horizon, ensuring optimal process design within the window while accommodating the design switching during the course of load variations in a larger time horizon. The controllability index quantifies the design capability to satisfy a given economic objective. Unique to other existing approaches, the process controllability index is computed based on the multi-dimensional geometric representation of the disturbances and uncertainties, measured process dynamics, and feasible operating spaces. These representations account for variable interactions existing in a multivariable process operation, in contrast to separate quantification in traditional single variable assessments. The geometric computation of the index requires the analysis and elimination of redundant measurement variables, which occur in different combinations at different process and controller structures. The redundancy is detected and eliminated based on statistical collinearity among the process data, allowing the assessment to focus on the retained functional variables and the associated critical disturbances and uncertainties. The redundancy analysis is tailored with a dynamic mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) solver, which is dedicated to select the optimum process and controller structure within the design. The solver is developed based on the branch and bound strategy over the design tree, which consists of alternative nonlinear programming (NLP) sub-problems. In addition to the redundancy analysis, the solver is equipped with a compact MINLP formulation, an alternating depth-first and breadth-first search strategy, sub-problems. The tailored strategy ensures fast and efficient convergence of convex problems, as well as superior optimum of non-convex counterparts. Finally, the framework is performed within a time window, which progresses along the time horizon. This strategy provides realistic responses to major variations along greater length of time, by switching between optimum operational modes, while maintaining the optimum process controllability. The performance of the framework is illustrated through several case studies. Each case demonstrates the novelty of addressing various computational features in a concise algorithm. These include the industrial case, which involves the systematic controllability assessment of an industrial five-effect liquor-burning evaporator within an Alumina refinery, which highlights the contribution of this framework in bridging the process design methodologies with the industrial implementation. The thesis consists of eight chapters, presenting the systematic development of the framework. The numerical implementations have been organised in a MATLAB Toolbox, accompanied with the relevant case studies...|$|E

The aim of the work has been to assess the degree of functional connectivity of Aleppo pine plantations with respect to these vectors. A combination of modelling procedures were applied, one derived from the maximum-entropy principle (MaxEnt), the other form graph theory (Conefor Sensinode 2. 2). Results suggest that the use of MaxEnt in combination with the Conefor Sensinode 2. 2, not only overcomes the need to make subjective expert judgments about habitat suitability, but also improves the conceptual performance of the Conefor Sensinode 2. 2 algorithm itself when “least-cost distance” algorithms are not applicable.

40|$|Opportunities lay {{in areas}} not {{typically}} thought of {{in terms of}} design. Earth moving is not typically considered further than the initial site excavation. In Houston, earthwork is constant, often changing land incrimentally. The Port of Houston, ranking first in the United States in foreign waterborne commerce, and sixth in the world, requires the maintenance of its ship channel through regular dredging of sediments. Dredging is a reality of the Port of Houston and Disposal containment is its lifeline. Recently, three of the eight upland dredging disposal sites reached capacity and are now closed. Although the Port of Houston authority has proposed to raise the height of existing sites to increase capacity, {{this is only a}} short-term solution. Once a site reaches capacity, the land sits fallow indefinitely. The dredge material stays in the site perminently and would be difficult to develop or build on. They are also not publicly accessible, although it is quite apparent that they are used recreationally buy local residents. Treated as an engineering project, the two realities of waste site and recreation never meet.

30|$|The log-based {{arithmetic}} unit {{embedded in the}} designed FPU utilizes the carry save adder for computing all arithmetic operations. It uses simple log principles, along with <b>operational</b> <b>switches,</b> to select the inputs based on the operation needs. If the adder operator is fed to the switch, the addition computation phenomenon is carried out by merely adding or subtracting the mantissa bits according to the exponent and sign bits. The difference of the two exponents is calculated. If any, perform the mantissa shift and set the larger exponent as the tentative exponent of the result. Shift the mantissa of the smaller exponent to the right by {{the difference in the}} exponents. According to the sign bit, perform addition (if equal) or subtraction (if unequal) on the mantissas to get the tentative mantissa as the result. Normalize and round off the mantissa result. If there is an overflow due to rounding, shift right and increment the exponent by 1 bit. Have the highest of the sign bits be the sign bit of the result. Similarly, a multiplication computation procedure is chosen for multiplier input that is fed to the operator switch. The overall data path involved in the multiplier component of this FPU architecture gets simplified. This is a mere computation with only mapping involved. Hence, this simplifies the overall stages involved in multiplications. The mantissas of the input data are mapped to the corresponding logarithmic number in the LUT. This is followed by adding the logarithms. If any overflow shifts the result to the right, then map with antilogarithm LUT to obtain the mantissa of the result. The exponent of the result is obtained by mere addition of the exponent bits, and the sign bit of the result is obtained by the Ex-or-ing both sign bits.|$|R

This innovation enables on-orbit in-situ solar-array health monitoring and {{is in response to}} a need recognized by the U. S. Air Force for future solar arrays for unmanned spacecraft. This system can also be constructed out of commercial-grade electronics and can be embedded into terrestrial solar power system as a diagnostics instrument. This innovation represents a novel approach to I-V curve measurement that is radiation and temperature hard, consumes very few system resources, is economical, and utilizes commercially available components. The circuit will also operate at temperatures as low as 55 C and up to + 225 C, allowing it to reside close to the array in direct sunlight. It uses a swept mode transistor functioning as a resistive load while utilizing the solar cells themselves as the biasing device, so the size of the instrument is small and there is no danger of over-driving the cells. Further, this innovation utilizes nearly universal spacecraft bus resources and therefore can be readily adapted to any spacecraft bus allowing for ease of retrofit, or designed into new systems without requiring the addition of infrastructure. One unique characteristic of this innovation is that it effects the measurement of I-V curves without the use of large resistor arrays or active current sources normally used to characterize cells.
