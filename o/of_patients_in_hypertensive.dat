40|$|Our case is straightforward; {{the cause}} of {{intracerebral}} hemorrhage (ICH) <b>in</b> our <b>patient</b> is most likely related to cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). Therefore, the specific question is whether aspirin should be used <b>in</b> <b>patients</b> with suspected CAA.

40|$|Four dipping {{categories}} {{have been}} described, {{based on the}} night-day blood pressure ratio from 24 -h ambulatory blood pressure recordings: extreme dippers (night-day blood pressure ratio 1. 0). The main {{purpose of this article}} is to discuss the prognostic significance of these four dipping categories in hypertension, mainly based on a large meta-analysis <b>of</b> individual <b>patient</b> data. <b>In</b> <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> without cardiovascular disease at baseline and with statistical adjustment for confounders and 24 -h blood pressure, mortality was lower in extreme dippers than in dippers, whereas the incidence of cardiovascular events was higher in reverse dippers. The worst prognosis for reverse dippers was also observed <b>in</b> <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> with major cardiovascular disease at baseline. Higher incidences of cardiovascular events and mortality were also found in reverse dippers in comparison with dippers in a comprehensive meta-analysis of population-based studies but outcome was not significantly different between extreme dippers and dippers. Based on these findings, there appears to be little doubt that reverse dipping is associated with a worse prognosis. Some studies suggest that prognosis is similar in nondippers and extreme dippers in comparison with dippers, but other studies suggest a somewhat worse prognosis in nondippers, or a better or worse prognosis in extreme dippers. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Management {{of blood}} {{pressure}} (BP) in acute ischemic stroke is controversial. The present study aims {{to explore the}} association between baseline BP levels and BP change and outcome in the overall stroke population and in specific subgroups {{with regard to the}} presence of arterial hypertensive disease and prior antihypertensive treatment. METHODS: All <b>patients</b> registered <b>in</b> the Acute STroke Registry and Analysis of Lausanne (ASTRAL) between 2003 and 2009 were analyzed. Unfavorable outcome was defined as modified Rankin score more than 2. A local polynomial surface algorithm was used to assess the effect of BP values on outcome in the overall population and in predefined subgroups. RESULTS: Up to a certain point, as initial BP was increasing, optimal outcome was seen with a progressively more substantial BP decrease over the next 24 - 48  h. Patients without hypertensive disease and an initially low BP seemed to benefit from an increase <b>of</b> BP. <b>In</b> <b>patients</b> with <b>hypertensive</b> disease, initial BP and its subsequent changes seemed to have less influence on clinical outcome. Patients who were previously treated with antihypertensives did not tolerate initially low BPs well. CONCLUSION: Optimal outcome in acute ischemic stroke may be determined not only by initial BP levels but also by the direction and magnitude of associated BP change over the first 24 - 48  h...|$|R
40|$|Background and Purpose—Compared with {{normotensive}} individuals, {{there is}} a higher incidence <b>of</b> stroke <b>in</b> <b>patients</b> with <b>hypertensive,</b> as well as prehypertensive, blood pressure levels (ie, 120 – 139 / 80 – 89 mm Hg). Although several {{studies have shown that}} blood pressure reduction <b>in</b> <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> reduces the incidence of cardiovascular events, including stroke, it is still unknown whether treatment of prehypertensive blood pressure levels has a similar effect. We sought to determine whether reduction in blood pressure in the prehypertensive range reduces the incidence of stroke by performing a meta-analysis of randomized trials comparing an antihypertensive drug against placebo in cohorts with prehypertensive baseline blood pressure levels. Methods—Randomized controlled trials performed with the 95 different antihypertensive agents available in the market were identified using MEDLINE, returning a total of 2852 results. Exclusion criteria included: average blood pressure of 140 / 90 mm Hg at baseline, crossover studies, and lack of a control group receiving placebo. Results—A total of 16 trials involving 70 664 patients were included. Patients randomized to the active treatment arm had a statistically significant 22 % reduction in the risk of stroke compared with placebo, with little heterogeneity among the trials (I 2, 18. 0 %; RR, 0. 78 [95 % CI, 0. 71 – 0. 86]; P 0. 000001). To prevent 1 stroke, 169 patients had to be treated with a blood-pressure-lowering medication for an average of 4. 3 years.

40|$|Abstract Background Intracranial {{haemorrhage}} {{accounts for}} 30 – 60 % of all stroke admissions into a hospital, with hypertension being the main risk factor. Presence of intraventricular haematoma {{is considered a}} poor prognostic factor due to the resultant obstruction to CSF and the mass effect following the presence of blood resulting in raised intracranial pressure and hydrocephalus. We report the results following endoscopic decompression of obstructive hydrocephalus and evacuation <b>of</b> haematoma <b>in</b> <b>patients</b> with <b>hypertensive</b> intraventricular haemorrhage. Methods During a two year period, 25 patients diagnosed as having an intraventricular haemorrhage with obstructive hydrocephalus secondary to hypertension were included in this study. All patients underwent endoscopic evacuation of the haematoma under general anaesthesia. Post operative evaluation was done by CT scan and Glasgow outcome scale. Results <b>Of</b> the 25 <b>patients,</b> thalamic haemorrhage was observed in 12 (48 %) patients, while, 11 (44 %) had a putaminal haematoma. Nine (36 %) patients had a GCS of 8 or less pre-operatively. Resolution of hydrocephalus following endoscopic evacuation was observed in 24 (96 %) patients. No complications {{directly related to the}} surgical technique were encountered in our study. At six months follow-up, a mortality rate of 6. 3 % and 55. 5 % was observed <b>in</b> <b>patients</b> with a pre-operative GCS of ≥ 9 and ≤ 8 respectively. Thirteen of the 16 (81. 3 %) patients with a pre-operative GCS ≥ 9 had good recovery.

For the first time, we examined these relationships in a non-clinical population. Design Cohort study. Methods Participants were 4419 men (mean age 38. 37 years) from the Vietnam Experience Study. Bilateral SBP and diastolic BP (DBP), serum lipids, fasting glucose, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, metabolic syndrome, and ankle brachial index were assessed in 1986. Results Ten per cent of men had an interarm difference of ? 10 and 2. 4 % of ? 15 ?mmHg. A 15 -year follow-up period gave rise to 246 deaths (64 from cardiovascular disease, CVD). Interarm differences of ? 10 ?mmHg were associated with an elevated risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, HR, 1. 49, 95 % confidence interval, CI, 1. 04 – 2. 14) and CVD mortality (HR 1. 93, 95 % CI 1. 01 – 3. 69). After adjusting for SBP, DBP, lipids, fasting glucose, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, associations between interarm differences of ? 10 ?mmHg and all-cause mortality (HR 1. 35, 95 % CI 0. 94 – 1. 95) and CVD mortality (1. 62, 95 % CI 0. 84 – 3. 14) were significantly attenuated. Conclusions In this non-clinical cohort study, interarm differences in SBP were not associated with mortality after accounting for traditional CVD risk factors. Interarm differences might not be valuable as an additional risk factor for mortality in populations with a low risk of CVD. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Objectives of {{the study}} were to {{determine}} the prevalence, maternal complications and perinatal outcomes <b>of</b> pregnancy <b>in</b> <b>patients</b> with <b>Hypertensive</b> Disorders <b>of</b> Pregnancy (HDP). Materials and Methods: A retrospective study was done by reviewing patients’ journals at Lilongwe Central Hospital (LCH) Maternity wing from January 2003 to June 2003. Those with HDP were then selected for the study. Results: From a total of 5248 deliveries during the period of study, 70 HDP cases were identified. Only 36 (51 %) booked for antenatal care. The overall prevalence was 13 per 1000 deliveries. The mean age of the cases was 23. 9 years. Among the cases 47 (67. 1 %) were younger women of the age group 16 - 25 years. Thirty-five (50 %) of the 70 cases were primigravidae and 65 (93 %) were married women. Of the five single mothers, eclampsia affected 4 while 45 married women were preeclamptic. There were similarities in the distribution of pre-eclampsia and eclampsia amongst the residential areas with higher number of urban cases compared to rural cases. There were 8 cases who had pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH) in their previous pregnancies. Maternal complications included 17 cases of severe preeclampsia, 24 cases of eclampsia, 3 cases of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), 3 cases of acute renal failure (ARF), 1 case of pulmonary oedema, and 1 case of maternal death. Perinatal outcomes included 34 preterm deliveries, 27 low birth weight babies, 7 stillbirths and 1 neonatal death. Conclusion: The prevalence rate of HDP is lower than those of South Africa and Zimbabwe. This finding may be attributed to underutilization of maternity services (55 % deliver in hospitals in Malawi). Primigravidae were the most affected group in this study (50 %) of all the cases, a finding that is similar to findings of various studies...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{the current}} study certain kidney {{biochemical}} markers were measured in the urine <b>of</b> Saudi <b>patients</b> suffering from diabetes mellitus. Two enzyme markers, N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase (NAG), a lysosomal enzyme in the catalysis of glycoprotein and alanine amino-peptidase (AAP) a brush border enzyme of the proximal tubules involved in amino acid metabolism, {{have been reported to}} be sensitive indicators of renal damage. The established marker, microalbuminuria was also measured, as it is productive of overt nephropathy and renal diseases.

40|$|Baroreflex {{sensitivity}} and cardiopulmonary blood volume were determined in 95 men, including normotensive and hypertensive subjects with normal renal function and balanced sodium intake and urinary output. Baroreflex sensitivity was estimated by determining {{the slope of}} the regression line relating the increase of systolic pressure to the cardiac slowing after transient rises of arterial pressure. A technique of gradual atropinisation was used to evaluate the parasympathetic mediated component of the reflex. With this method, it was possible to calculate the exact atropine dose abolishing the reflex sensitivity. This index was not dependent on age. It was negatively correlated to the diastolic pressure <b>in</b> normotensive <b>patients</b> but not <b>in</b> <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients.</b> The ratio between the cardiopulmonary and the total blood volume was considered as an index of sympathetic venous tone. This ratio was positively correlated to the diastolic pressure <b>in</b> normotensive <b>patients,</b> but not <b>in</b> <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients.</b> This study strongly suggests that a precise sympathetic-parasympathetic balance existed <b>in</b> the normotensive <b>patients.</b> This balance was disrupted <b>in</b> the <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> pointing to abnormalities in the autonomic nervous system <b>of</b> permanently hypertensive <b>patients...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract: It {{is time to}} {{recognize}} that the quality, not quantity, of myocardium <b>in</b> <b>hypertensive</b> heart disease is responsible for adverse cardiovascular events. Experimental and clinical available data indicate that myocardial fibrosis due to the exaggerated accumulation of collagen type I and type III fibers predisposes to an enhanced risk of diastolic and/or systolic ventricular dysfunction, symptomatic heart failure, ischemic heart disease, and arrhythmias <b>in</b> <b>patients</b> with <b>hypertensive</b> heart disease. Thus, management <b>of</b> these <b>patients</b> must not only focus on detection and regression of left ventricular hypertrophy. Far more sensible are interventions aimed to detect and target hypertensive myocardial fibrosis. The available data on the use of biochemical and/or imaging methodologies to address excessive accumulation of collagen fibers <b>in</b> the myocardium <b>of</b> <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> are promising. On the other hand, preliminary data suggest that the goal of reducing myocardial fibrosis is achievable <b>in</b> <b>patients</b> with <b>hypertensive</b> heart disease treated with specific antihypertensive agents. Collectively, these findings set the stage for larger trials where-in noninvasive measures and reparative strategies of myocardial fibrosis to prevent heart failure could prove useful...|$|R

40|$|Transforming {{growth factor}} beta and {{progression}} of renal disease. End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is more frequent in African Americans compared to whites. Many factors may be responsible, including genetic differences, increased prevalence of risk factors, and socioeconomic factors; however, to date, these proposed genetic or environmental factors have not provided a satisfactory {{explanation for the}} increased risk of ESRD in African Americans. Because renal fibrosis is a correlate of progressive renal failure and a dominant feature of ESRD, and because transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β 1) can induce fibrosis and renal insufficiency, we explored the hypothesis that TGF-β 1 hyperexpression is more frequent in African Americans compared to whites. We tested our hypotheses by measuring TGF-β 1 levels in African Americans and white patients with ESRD, hypertension, and <b>in</b> normal <b>patients.</b> <b>In</b> <b>hypertensive</b> and normal <b>patients,</b> we also evaluated TGF-β 1 mRNA levels, and TGF-β 1 DNA polymorphisms.

40|$|Tagging CMR {{has been}} {{established}} as the standard reference for measurement of myocardial strain. The current 2 D tagging technique requires multiple breath-holds to cover the whole heart and cannot show the 3 D motions of the left ventricle. We performed fast 3 -breath-hold 3 D tagging with localized tagging preparation and complementary spatial modulation <b>of</b> magnetization <b>in</b> 10 <b>patients</b> with hypertrophic myocardial diseases and 6 normal volunteers. The left wall motion was observed at any view angle, which allowed for the identification of regional and global hypokinesis using the fast 3 D tagging. Although {{a decrease in the}} circumferential strain and LGE were observed at the basal septum in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, they were not located together <b>in</b> each <b>patient.</b> <b>In</b> <b>hypertensive</b> heart disease, the decrease in circumferential strain was observed more widely than LGE, and the summed strain of all segments was significantly decreased. The decrease in strain and LGE were observed diffusely in cardiac amyloidosis. In conclusion, fast 3 -breath-hold 3 D tagging is feasible for the regional and global strain analysis. The location of reduced circumferential strain is not necessarily {{the same as that of}} LGE and is related to the global cardiac function <b>in</b> <b>patients</b> with hypertrophic myocardial diseases...|$|R
40|$|Albumin {{excretion}} rate {{is usually}} increased {{in people who}} smoke, but the physiological basis of this phenomenon is not fully understood. METHODS: The effect of chronic smoking on renal haemodynamics was studied in a cohort of 66 men. Twenty-seven were smokers and 36 were <b>hypertensive.</b> <b>In</b> all subjects, the albumin excretion rate was evaluated; <b>in</b> <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients,</b> a renoscintigraphic evaluation of renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration were carried out and the filtration fraction was calculated. RESULTS: The hypertensive smoking population presented an increased urinary albumin excretion rate <b>in</b> comparison with <b>hypertensive</b> non-smoking patients. No {{significant differences were found}} for the mean values of renal plasma flow, the glomerular filtration rate and the filtration fraction between hypertensive smokers and <b>hypertensive</b> non-smoking <b>patients.</b> CONCLUSIONS: <b>In</b> <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients,</b> smoking does not modify typical renal haemodynamic changes of arterial hypertension; however, it significantly increases the albumin excretion rate...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Knowledge of the {{long-term}} clinical outcome of Raynaud's syndrome (RS), essential both for patient counselling and formulation of optimal therapeutic recommendations, is conspicously deficient in current medical literature. We have prospectively monitored 1039 patients with RS, 118 (11. 4 %) for more than 10 years to determine whether initial characterization was able to predict outcome. Methods: At initial presentation, patients were divided into four groups {{on the basis of}} vascular laboratory and serologic testing results: vasospatic, serologically positive (spast,sero+) and negative (spast,sero-) and obstructive, serologically positive (obst,sero+) and negative (obst,sero-). Results: Connective tissue disease (CTD) was present initially in 48. 6 % <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> with spast,sero+ results and 72. 9 % <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> with obst,sero+ results. <b>Of</b> the remaining <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> these groups, progression to CTD during follow-up occurred in 16. 4 % <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> with spast,sero+ results and 30. 4 % <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> with obst,sero+ results. In the > 10 -year follow-up group, progression to CTD occurred in 81. 8 % <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> the obst,sero+ group. Progression to CTD occurred in 2. 0 % <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> the spast,serogroup and 8. 5 % <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> the obst,sero- group. Digital ulcers occurred in 15. 5 % <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> the spast,sero+ group, 5. 2 % <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> the spast,sero- group, 55. 6 % <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> the obst,sero+ group and 48. 2 % <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> the obst,sero- group. Digital or phalangeal amputations were required in 1. 4 %, 1. 6 %, 11. 6 %, and 19. 0 % <b>of</b> these <b>patients,</b> respectively. Conclusions: The long-term outcome <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> with RS can be predicted by initial serologic studies and separation into vasospastic and obstructive categories. Initial serologic positivity strongly predicts the development of CTD. Initial vascular laboratory classification of obstructive RS strongly predicts digital ulcerations, which occurred <b>in</b> half <b>of</b> these <b>patients</b> regardless <b>of</b> initial serologic study results. Amputations were required in 10 % to 20 % <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> with obstructive RS. These occurrences did not increase with increased duration of disease. Ulcerations and amputations were rare <b>in</b> <b>patients</b> initially with vasospastic RS...|$|R
