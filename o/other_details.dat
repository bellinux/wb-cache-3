5|$|Maggots {{found on}} corpses are useful to {{forensic}} entomologists. Maggot species {{can be identified}} by their anatomical features and by matching their DNA. Maggots of different species of flies visit corpses and carcases at fairly well-defined times {{after the death of}} the victim, and so do their predators, such as beetles in the family Histeridae. Thus, {{the presence or absence of}} particular species provides evidence for the time since death, and sometimes <b>other</b> <b>details</b> such as the place of death, when species are confined to particular habitats such as woodland.|$|E

5|$|The {{first issue}} {{consisted}} of four values released on 20 February 1925; d, 1d, 2d and 6d. Typographed by the Government Printers in Dublin Castle on 'se' watermarked paper.

The second issue had ten values: d, 1d, 1d, 2d, 3d, 5d, 6d, 8d, 10d and 1/-, and were printed on 'e' watermarked paper between 1940 and 1969. <b>Other</b> <b>details</b> are the same.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Haynes Stellite {{moved to}} {{producing}} tableware, jewelry, and pocket knives. The {{employees of the}} company unionized and began to demand wage increases beyond what Haynes believed was fair. The threat of labor strikes and Haynes' desire to avoid the problem led him to sell the company to Union Carbide on April 10, 1920, in exchange for 25,000 shares of Union Carbide stock valued at $2million. He later made an additional half million from dividends. <b>Other</b> <b>details</b> of the deal were never made public, and Haynes may have made as much $4million on the sale. After a series of owners, the company is now called Haynes International and is again independent.|$|E

He gives the date of the raid as 27 September 1944, four weeks after the date given by Churches. His account has been posted on the internet by his family. Gossner states that he arrived at Semič 21 days after the raid, and his account varies significantly from that of Churches.

5|$|Compared to {{neighbouring}} Ireland and Anglo-Saxon England, few {{records of}} 9th- and 10th-century events in Scotland survive. The main local source {{from the period}} is the Chronicle of the Kings of Alba, a list of kings from Kenneth MacAlpin (died 858) to KennethII (Cináed mac Maíl Coluim, died 995). The list survives in the Poppleton Manuscript, a 13th-century compilation. Originally simply a list of kings with reign lengths, the <b>other</b> <b>details</b> contained in the Poppleton Manuscript version were added in the 10th and 12th centuries. In addition to this, later king lists survive. The earliest genealogical records of the descendants of Kenneth MacAlpin may date {{from the end of}} the 10th century, but their value lies more in their context, and the information they provide about the interests of those for whom they were compiled, than in the unreliable claims they contain.|$|E

On October 12, 2007, the game's title was officially released as Advance Wars: Days of Ruin for the North American version, with a planned shipping date of January 21, 2008; the alternate name of Advance Wars: Dark Conflict for European and Australian versions was released in early December.|$|E

5|$|The {{novel is}} a {{combination}} of fact and fiction. Blending together these two elements is important in any historical novel, but especially in The Feast of the Goat because Vargas Llosa chose to narrate an actual event through the minds of both real and fictional characters. Some characters are fictional, and those that are non-fictional still have fictionalized aspects in the book. The general details of the assassination are true, and the assassins are all real people. While they lie in wait for the Dictator to arrive, they recount actual crimes of the regime, such as the murder of the Mirabal sisters. However, <b>other</b> <b>details</b> are invented by Vargas Llosa, such as Amadito's murder of the brother of the woman he loved.|$|E
5|$|The roman {{designs of}} Garamond which are his most imitated {{were based on}} a font cut around 1495 for the Venetian printer Aldus Manutius by {{engraver}} Francesco Griffo. This was first used in the book De Aetna, a short work by poet and cleric Pietro Bembo which was Manutius' first printing in the Latin alphabet after a long series of publications of classics of Greek literature that won him an international reputation. Historian Beatrice Warde has assessed De Aetna as something of a pilot project, a small book printed to a higher standard than Manutius' norm. Among <b>other</b> <b>details,</b> this font popularised the idea that in printing the cross-stroke of the 'e' should be level instead of slanting upwards to the right like handwriting, something imitated in almost all type designs since.|$|E
5|$|Few <b>other</b> <b>details</b> {{are known}} about the singer's childhood. At some point he met another blind musician, Madkin Butler, who had a {{powerful}} singing and preaching style that influenced Johnson's own vocal delivery and repertoire. Adam Booker, a blind minister interviewed by the blues historian Samuel Charters in the 1950s, recalled that while visiting his father in Hearne, Johnson would perform religious songs on street corners with a tin cup tied to the neck of his Stella guitar to collect money. Occasionally, Johnson would play on the same street as Blind Lemon Jefferson, but {{the extent of the}} two songsters' involvement with each other is unknown. In 1926 or early 1927, Johnson established an unregistered marriage with Willie B. Harris, who occasionally sang on the street with him and at benefits for the Marlin Church of God in Christ with Johnson accompanied on piano. From the relationship, Johnson had a daughter, Sam Faye Johnson Kelly, in 1931. The blues guitarist L. C. Robinson recalled that his sister Anne also claimed to have been married to Johnson in the late 1920s.|$|E

5|$|The exact date of his {{reception}} is a mystery. According to Maiorescu's own recollections, written some {{decades after}} the event, Creangă was in attendance at a Junimea meeting of 1871, during which Gheorghe Costaforu proposed to transform the club into a political party. The information was considered dubious by Z. Ornea, who argued that the episode may have been entirely invented by the Junimist leader, and noted that it contradicted both Negruzzi's accounts and minutes kept by A. D. Xenopol. According to Ornea's assessment, {{with the exception of}} literary critic Vladimir Streinu, all of Creangă's biographers have come to dismiss Maiorescu's statement. Several sources mention that the future writer was introduced to the society by Eminescu, who was an active member around 1875. This and <b>other</b> <b>details</b> lead Ornea to conclude that membership was granted to Creangă only after the summer break of 1875.|$|E
5|$|The single premiered on Chris Moyles's breakfast show on 7 September on BBC Radio 1. On Sunday 18 October 2009 {{the song}} was {{released}} for digital download in the UK. Cole took to the stage of The X Factor Live Results Show later that evening to perform the song for the first time. She adorned a military-themed outfit by Welsh fashion designer Julien MacDonald. It consisted of a sheer bodysuit, a red military jacket with black epaulettes as well as <b>other</b> <b>details,</b> black harem trousers and Alexander Wang boots. The outfit itself was subject to media attention, with some reporting that online debates had drawn comparisons to the outfit worn by 1992 video game antagonist M. Bison from the Street Fighter series. Media also considered Cole's outfit and performance inspired by Janet Jackson. Media speculated that the performance was mimed, something that Cole denied though she admitted to having some pre-recorded vocals to help the live performance. The show, which also featured the first UK performance by Whitney Houston in six years, drew a record audience of 14.8million, making it the most watched episode in the show's history at that time.|$|E
