40|$|With today’s {{state-of-the-art}} technology, miniature {{sensors and}} actuators can be manufactured and integrated with electronics onto extremely small footprint devices.

Since the main characteristics of these devices are that their power supply is extremely restricted and the span of the network is limited, conventional algorithms and protocols need to be adapted to this “micro ” networking environment.

40|$|Abstract—Use {{cases are}} {{believed}} to be a good basis for system testing. Yet, to automate the test generation process, there is a large gap to bridge between high-level use cases and concrete test cases. We propose a new approach for automating the generation of system test scenarios <b>in</b> <b>the</b> context of object-oriented embedded software, taking into account traceability problems between highlevel views and concrete test case execution. Starting from a formalization of the requirements based on use cases extended with contracts, we automatically build a transition system from which we synthesize test cases. Our objective is to cover <b>the</b> system <b>in</b> terms of statement coverage with those generated tests: An empirical evaluation of our approach is given based on this objective and several case studies. We briefly discuss the experimental deployment of <b>our</b> approach <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field <b>at</b> Thalès Airborne Systems. Index Terms—Use case, test generation, scenarios, contracts, UML. ...|$|R
25|$|In 1881, Langtry was {{in need of}} money. Her {{close friend}} Oscar Wilde {{suggested}} she try the stage, and Langtry embarked upon a theatre career. She first tried out for an amateur production <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Twickenham Town Hall on 19 November 1881. It was a comedy two-hander called A Fair Encounter, with Henrietta Labouchère taking the other role and coaching Langtry in her acting. Labouchère had been a professional actress (Henrietta Hodson) before she met and married Liberal MP Henry Labouchère. Following favorable reviews of this first attempt <b>at</b> <b>the</b> stage, and with further coaching, Langtry made her debut before the London public, playing Kate Hardcastle in She Stoops to Conquer <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Haymarket Theatre <b>in</b> December 1881. Critical opinion was mixed, but she was a success with the public. She next performed <b>in</b> <b>Ours</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same theatre. Although her affair with the Prince of Wales was over, he supported her new venture by attending several of her performances and helping attract an audience.|$|R
30|$|With these {{premises}} in mind, {{we propose}} and evaluate {{a novel approach}} focused on flexibility. Our method {{is based on the}} nearest neighbor (NN) approach [10] and uses the joint trajectories estimated from the depth sequences, referred to as action templates (ATs), as a model for each action class. Our method does not require a computationally expensive learning process; modification of the model can be done by just adding new labeled joint trajectories to <b>the</b> set of <b>ATs.</b> For action classification of an unknown action sequence, our method calculates the distance between that sequence and each AT via dynamic time warping (DTW), which is widely used for analyzing time series data [11]. The joint trajectories estimated from depth maps are generally noisy, which might hinder recognition accuracy. For this reason, we include <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>ATs</b> <b>the</b> confidence values of each tracked joint along with their respective position, and modify the DTW algorithm to calculate a distance between actions while avoiding erroneous trajectory sections.|$|R
50|$|Gates’s {{decision}} {{to bring the}} videotape of the funeral held for {{the men on the}} Golf was ultimately motivated {{by the fact that the}} United States wanted to inspire Russia to offer up information on missing American servicemen in Vietnam. Before that, “We had never confirmed anything to <b>the</b> Russians except <b>in</b> various vague senses,” he said in an interview. “Shortly after the USSR collapsed, the Bush administration had told the Russians through an intermediary that we couldn’t tell them any more about what had happened on Golf/Glomar. But then when we started asking the Russians about what had happened to U.S. pilots shot down over Vietnam, and if any U.S. POWs had been transferred to Russia and held there, they came back and said, “What about <b>our</b> guys <b>in</b> <b>the</b> submarine?” <b>At</b> <b>the</b> time, the administration told the Russians only that there were no survivors and that there were only scattered remains.” A subsequent FOIA search to find if any POWs were released as a result of this visit produced only negative results.|$|R
40|$|Genetic {{engineering}} {{has proven}} to be quite a hot topic that is, and continues to be, very controversial. Now that the idea of human genetic engineering has surfaced, people have become even more excited and/or anxious over how it will effect <b>our</b> species <b>in</b> <b>the</b> future. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> core of the debate is how the autonomy, dignity and integrity inherent to all individuals will change - whether for better or worse. Two ideas that I want to discuss is (1) the idea of being oneself and (2) the idea of instrumentalizing human nature. In being oneself, will a person still be able to have the capacity to live his/her life according to his/her own authorship, or will genetic manipulation prevent a person from being able to grow and become an individual. In instrumentalization, will genetic enhancement truly interfere with a person's autonomy because the designer is seeing him/her as a creature of his/her preference, or is it possible that genetic intervention, because we are uncertain and cannot predict the future, will not be definitively able to harm an individual. I do not plan to be an authority on this subject because different people have different views on what is integrity and autonomy. All I wish to do is open up a space for discourse and more understanding on the topic, and ask that people be more conscious of the thoughts and worries of not just the people who agree with them in their position but the people who are <b>in</b> <b>the</b> opposite stance on the topic...|$|R
40|$|More recently, African {{emerging}} {{financial markets}} and institutions, have began receiving attention for internal structural reasons. There is an actual growing {{recognition of the}} role of the financial sector, and the region has undergone extensive economic and financial reforms of similar proportions as those countries in Latin America and East Asia. These reform measures seem to have begun yielding positive results in terms of economic performance and increased attention by international investors. According to the ADB statistics, the real GDP growth rate in Africa reached 3. 0 % in 1995, markedly higher than the year before (1. 9 %) and the average for the 1990 - 93 (less than 1 %). <b>At</b> <b>the</b> disaggregate level, there are countries which have posted exceptional performance i. e Uganda, Ghana, Benin, Botswana, Mauritius, Cote d&# 39 Ivoire, Kenya, etc. A compelling case can be made for the development of capital markets in Africa. Well-functioning financial markets, along with well-designed institutions and regulatory systems, foster economic development through private initiative. The linkage between finance and economic development is of great interest to Africa, since it suggests an indirect linkage between financial sector development and poverty alleviation, along with employment creation. There is empirical evidence strongly suggesting that well- functioning capital markets promote long-run economic growth. In particular, Levine and Zervos (1995) find that indicators of stock market development i. e market liquidity, capitalization, turnover, efficiency of pricing of risk, etc are correlated with current and future economic growth, capital accumulation, and productivity improvements. Therefore, <b>our</b> interest <b>in</b> this paper is to look into how investors are protected to meet up this challenge <b>in</b> <b>the</b> emerging stock markets and particularly, the African emerging markets. A case is made on the South African stock market and technically compares it with other African markets view their performance in relation to investors' protection in South Africa, and assess if this has been successful. We will give a review of <b>our</b> result <b>in</b> <b>the</b> conclusion <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of the paper...|$|R
