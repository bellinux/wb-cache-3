40|$|Abstract: In recent years, Chinese higher {{vocational}} education reform has made great achievements. However, physical education reform, as one part <b>of</b> the higher <b>vocational</b> education, lags far behind other curriculum reforms. Along with the rapid development <b>of</b> higher <b>vocational</b> education in our country, the number <b>of</b> higher <b>vocational</b> colleges has become larger than that of undergraduate colleges. But, quite a few higher vocational colleges are upgraded from secondary vocational schools. Although they still belong to {{the institutions of the}} higher learning, the educational ideas and positioning of them are totally different from those of undergraduate colleges. So the teaching reform of physical education must change based on the new situation <b>of</b> higher <b>vocational</b> physical education teaching environments. Through the analysis about the present situation <b>of</b> higher <b>vocational</b> colleges, the author puts forward the idea and thoughts of education reform as below. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper aims {{to clarify}} the {{structure}} <b>of</b> higher <b>vocational</b> education in China and the policy trend in it. Since 1980 s the development <b>of</b> higher <b>vocational</b> education in China has experienced three stages including its starting, scale expansion and connotative development. The advisable experiences are being done with strong supports from the Chinese government. At present, higher vocational education {{plays a major role}} in Chinese higher education. Before examining the structure <b>of</b> higher <b>vocational</b> education in China, this paper begins by classifying higher vocational education as 1) the change of economic system, 2) the change of industrial reform in china, and 3) the development <b>of</b> middle <b>vocational</b> education in China. Then this paper overviews the framework <b>of</b> higher <b>vocational</b> education and policy trend from 1980 s. In this chapter, the author has gathered the definition <b>of</b> the higher <b>vocational</b> education in law, policy, dictionary and Chinese experts. On the other hand, the author analyzes the policy for developing the higher vocational education from 1980 s to 2000 s, and analyzes the expansion and reorganization of major school types <b>of</b> higher <b>vocational</b> education. In conclusion, first, the author finds that the Chinese government has not put enough financial support into it, although higher vocational education has been respected. Second, the development <b>of</b> higher <b>vocational</b> education is restricted by the government, so individual institutions don 2 ̆ 7 t have enough power to manage themselves. Third, the more dual-qualified teaching staff in higher vocational education has been recommended, but the more systematic management for professions 2 ̆ 7 quality development should be built and strengthened in the near future. Forth, the pedagogical model of training students should be more investigated in each institution and clarified by each training field...|$|R
