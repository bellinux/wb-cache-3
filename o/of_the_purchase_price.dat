5|$|Due to the team's struggles, Huggins made {{personnel}} {{changes during}} the offseason. The Yankees attempted to trade Pipp to another American League team, {{but could not}} agree on the terms with any team. They put Pipp on waivers, and he was acquired by the Cincinnati Reds of the National League, who reportedly paid the Yankees a greater sum than the $7,500 waiver price. The Reds, who {{had not had a}} strong starting first baseman since Jake Daubert died in 1924, had attempted to acquire Bill Terry from the Giants, but refused to part with Edd Roush in the transaction, and so acquired Pipp instead. Pipp again attempted to acquire a portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>price,</b> but was rebuffed.|$|E
5|$|Portland was platted in 1845, then Daniel H. Lownsdale {{purchased}} land {{south and}} west of the original platting. He drew up a plat in 1848 that included 11 narrow blocks, 100×200 feet, instead of the standard 200×200 feet. He then brought on Stephen Coffin and William W. Chapman as partners, and dedicated the South Park Blocks and midtown park blocks in 1852. This made them the first official greenspace in Portland. While they were dedicated to the city, they weren't owned by the city until September 22, 1870, when Mayor Bernard Goldsmith and Chapman agreed on selling the South Park Blocks and the two Plaza Blocks (Chapman and Lownsdale Squares) to the city for $6,250. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>price</b> was for the Plaza Blocks, since the park blocks were {{at the edge of}} the developed city.|$|E

25|$|In {{an attempt}} to resolve his {{financial}} problems, Greenleaf sold his shares in the NALC to Nicholson and Morris on May 28, 1796, for $1.5 million. Unfortunately, Morris and Nicholson funded their purchase by giving Greenleaf personal notes. Furthermore, they endorsed one another's notes.

25|$|Two major {{portrait}} purchases {{were also}} {{made in the}} early 1980s. One was a Gilbert Stuart portrait of Thomas Jefferson, for which the museum paid $1 million to a private collector.

25|$|On April 12, the Athenaeum and NPG {{agreed to}} delay the sale until December 31, 1979, to give the Boston {{fund-raising}} effort a chance. Although not completely successful, the lawsuit had one effect: Attorney General Bellotti announced in mid-summer that the Stuart portraits could not be sold without his permission. By November 1979, the fund-raising campaign had netted only $885,631, with a pledge from the Museum of Fine Arts to match the amount if necessary. This left the campaign $4 million short <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>price.</b> The Athenaeum refused to lower the price, describing the $5 million listing as a significant discount from the portraits' real value.|$|E

25|$|Properties {{can also}} be mortgaged, {{although}} all developments on a monopoly must be sold before any property of that color can be mortgaged or traded. The player receives money from the bank for each mortgaged property (half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>price),</b> which must be repaid with 10% interest to unmortgage. Houses and hotels can be sold back to the bank for half their purchase price. Players cannot collect rent on mortgaged properties and may not give improved property away to others; however, trading mortgaged properties is allowed. The player receiving the mortgaged property must immediately unmortgage it for the mortgage price plus 10%, or pay the bank just the 10% amount and keep the property mortgaged; if the player chooses the latter, they must still pay the 10% again if the property is later unmortgaged.|$|E
25|$|According to {{the plan}} put before the first session of the First Congress in 1790, Hamilton {{proposed}} establishing the initial funding for the First Bank of the United States through the sale of $10 million in stock of which the United States government would purchase the first $2 million in shares. Hamilton, foreseeing the objection that this could not be done since the U.S. government did not have $2 million, proposed that the government make the stock purchase using money lent to it by the bank; the loan to be paid back in ten equal annual installments. The remaining $8 million of stock {{would be available to}} the public, both in the United States and overseas. The chief requirement of these non-government purchases was that one-quarter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>price</b> had to be paid in gold or silver; the remaining balance could be paid in bonds, acceptable scrip, etc.|$|E
25|$|Greenleaf and Morris {{purchased}} 6,000 lots {{under the}} same conditions as the September agreement. At least 1,500 of these lots {{had to be in}} the northeast quadrant of the District of Columbia, but Greenleaf could take his pick of lots anywhere else in the city for the remainder. The monthly loan to the commissioners also increased, to $2,660 per commissioner per month. An additional clause required that the 6,000 lots include 428.5 lots on Buzzard Point owned by Notley Young (a plantation owner in Prince George's County, Maryland) and 220 lots on Buzzard Point owned by Daniel Carroll (a Founding Father and Maryland landowner whose farm was used to form the District of Columbia). The contract also included provisions (identical to those in the September 23 contract) which required no down payment; did not require the first payment until May 1, 1794; required only annual payments of one-sixth of the total amount <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>price</b> annually thereafter; and did not impose any interest. With these transactions, Greenleaf and his co-investors now controlled about half the federal government's salable land in the District of Columbia.|$|E

25|$|In 1850, {{the land}} was {{occupied}} by free blacks and Irish immigrants who had purchased land, where they raised livestock, built churches and cemeteries, and had lived as a community for close to 50 years. Before {{the construction of the}} park could start, the area had to be cleared of its inhabitants. Rossi states that part of the impetus to schemes such as Central Park and others was to remove what they incorrectly deemed as shanty towns and their denizens. However, most lived in small villages, such as Harsenville, the Piggery District, or Seneca Village; or in the school and convent at Mount St. Vincent's Academy. Approximately 1,600 residents were evicted under the rule of eminent domain during 1857. Seneca Village and parts of the other communities were razed {{to make room for the}} park. In addition, when the commission finally submitted its report for public examination on October 4, 1855, taxpayers learned that they would be paying $5 million just for the park land, more than three times what they had been told the completed park as a whole would cost. At the same time, the offsetting revenue from property taxes of adjacent land came to $1.7 million, or one-third <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>price,</b> and was considerably less than earlier estimates.|$|E
