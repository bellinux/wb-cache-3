30|$|According to Adanur (2001), the open-end is {{a process}} notably {{employed}} to produce denim yarn. The open-end yarns are cheap and rustic for not passing through machines that add a sophisticated finishing, such as textile laminating and combing machines, differing, for example, from the ring spinning process where a set of parallelized fibers is well twisted so there is high cohesion and strength. Additionally, in <b>open-end</b> <b>spinning,</b> the individual fibers are not uniformly arranged in the produced yarn as in the <b>spinning</b> ring produced <b>yarn.</b> In an <b>open-end</b> <b>spinning</b> <b>yarn</b> most of the fibers are parallel, but with some intersections and some irregular fibers surrounding the main cable (Fabriclink – Fabric University 2012).|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to predict the mechanical behaviour of yarns under various levels of strain, by using only their technical parameters. The study of the yarn response to tensile test and relaxation test at different strain levels has permitted us to propose an analytical model predicting the entire stress-strain response of yarn. We have used the rheological approach to propose this analytical model. This model permitted to describe the viscoelastic behaviour of ring and <b>open-end</b> <b>spun</b> <b>yarns</b> during traction and relaxation. In order to characterize the coefficients of the proposed model, traction and relaxation tests were performed for 44 yarns. The neuronal approach is used to study the correlation between the mechanical coefficients of the analytical model and the technical parameters of the spinning mill. This allowed us to predict the yarns mechanical behaviour...|$|R
40|$|A queuing {{model of}} staple yarn {{structure}} {{was presented in}} Part I of this work, where the migration behaviours of fibres were simulated by the movement of customers in a Markovian network of queuing systems. Part II of the series proposes (i) a multi-dimensional minimization method for estimating the migration probabilities of fibres based on {{the analysis of the}} distribution of number of fibres in yarn cross-sections; (ii) a yarn structure simulation algorithm which uses the migration probabilities of fibres, yarn technical specifications (e. g. linear density and twist) and colour composition to produce a realistic three-dimensional image of a melange yarn. The result is a high quality three-dimensional image of a melange yarn showing its fibrous structure as well as the formation of hairiness. Due to the generic nature of the model and the simulation algorithm, this approach can be applied {{to a wide range of}} yarns including ring-spun or <b>open-end</b> <b>spun</b> <b>yarns</b> of solid shade or produced from melange blends. Further improvements to the proposed model are discussed including the application of inhomogeneous Poisson process and the analysis of energy relationships which govern the migration behaviour of fibres...|$|R
40|$|This article {{provides}} three models to predict rotor <b>spun</b> <b>yarn</b> characteristics which are breaking strength, breaking elongation and unevenness.

In this study, predicting models are given by the analysis of response surface after many iterations in which nonsignificant terms are excluded for more accuracy and precision.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the relationship between}} technological parameters of spinning of 100 % CV Vortex yarns of different counts and its selected geometrical parameters (a lead of helix of wrapping fibre ribbon, yarn diameter) as well as yarn properties. The number of twist of wrapping fibre layer is determined. The effect of the yarn delivery speed, hollow spindle diameter, and the main draft on the hairiness, mass irregularity, tenacity, elongation, resistance to abrasion and bending rigidity of Vortex yarn is observed. The yarn properties are compared with the properties of <b>open-end</b> rotor <b>spun</b> <b>yarns.</b> Slivers of the same spinning lot {{were used for the}} production of both kinds of yarn. The results showed that the delivery speed in combination with spindle diameter affects yarn diameter, hairiness and abrasion resistance. Mass irregularity and imperfections of yarn is mainly affected by the main draft of drafting unit. Technological parameters of spinning do not affect the level of bending rigidity of the Vortex <b>yarn.</b> Tested rotor <b>spun</b> <b>yarns</b> had a larger diameter, higher hairiness, lower tenacity and higher elongation, lower mass irregularity and number of imperfections, higher abrasion resistance and lower bending rigidity compared to tested Vortex <b>spun</b> <b>yarns...</b>|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The research described was primarily concerned with working towards {{the solution of the}} problem of yarn tension control when building conical packages on an <b>open-end</b> <b>spinning</b> machine at <b>yarn</b> delivery speeds of 500 m 1 min"cause of the total lack of published work on the mathematical modelling of the parameters affecting tension variation, a considerable amount of effort was spent in the establishment of this basic understanding. This mathematical analysis appears, in the main, in the appendices to this thesis. In addition to the analysis of yarn tension variations depending on machine geometry parameters, mathematical models have also been produced which predict the effect on tension of fitting curved distribution bars of various shapes. The work includes the development of concept ideas which appeared capable of providing routes for solution of the tension control problem. These ideas were evaluated and compared against a design specification which was also developed as part of this research. Two promising concepts were selected for detailed investigation. These were: a pneumatic passive compensator and, a positive mechanical compensator. The pneumatic compensator was a novel idea which was conceived by the author, and which eventually provided a solution which met the design specification in every way. The mechanical compensator was shown to be a far less attractive concept with several serious problems which have been explored but not eliminated. A preliminary investigation of a third concept involving microprocessor control was not sufficiently well developed at the time of publication to be included in this thesis...|$|R

This study examined whether the impact of cellulase treatment was different on denim fabrics having torque-free ring <b>spun</b> <b>yarn</b> in the warp direction. Commercially produced torque-free ring <b>spun</b> cotton <b>yarn</b> was used for manufacturing denim fabric. One specimen of denim fabric had torque-free ring <b>spun</b> <b>yarn</b> in the warp direction and conventional ring <b>spun</b> <b>yarn</b> in the weft direction while the other had normal conventional ring <b>spun</b> <b>yarn</b> in both warp and weft directions. Both warp yarns of the fabrics were dyed with the same indigo dyeing process.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to explore whether the {{properties}} of worsted yarns, especially hairiness, can be improved by combining the Solospun and Sirospun processes into a single Solo-Siro spun process. Wool fibres of 19 and 21 μm in average diameter were spun into 40 tex yarns at different twist levels, using the conventional ring, Sirospun and Solo-Siro spun systems, respectively. These yarns were then tested for a range of properties, including hairiness, tenacity, elongation and evenness, for comparison purposes. The statistical analysis results indicate that the hairiness (S 3 value) of Solo-Siro <b>spun</b> <b>yarns</b> was significantly less than that of both Sirospun and normal ring <b>spun</b> <b>yarns.</b> In addition, the tenacity of the Solo-Siro <b>spun</b> <b>yarns</b> was higher than that of the normal ring <b>spun</b> <b>yarns,</b> while changes in yarn breaking elongation were not statistically significant.

The Rotor design is the key to the operation of the open-ended spinners. Each type of fibre may require a different rotor design for optimal product quality and processing speed.|$|R
