40|$|ABSTRACT: Affinity reagent pairs that {{recognize}} distinct epitopes on {{a target}} protein can greatly improve the {{sensitivity and specificity}} of molecular detection. Importantly, such pairs can be conjugated to generate reagents that achieve two-site “bidentate ” target recognition, with affinities greatly exceeding either monovalent component. DNA aptamers are especially well-suited for such constructs, {{because they can be}} linked via standard synthesis techniques without requiring chemical conjugation. Unfortunately, aptamer pairs are difficult to generate, primarily because conventional selection methods preferentially yield aptamers that recognize a dominant “hot spot ” epitope. Our array-based discovery platform for multivalent aptamers (AD-MAP) overcomes this problem to achieve efficient discovery of aptamer pairs. We use microfluidic selection and high-throughput sequencing to obtain an enriched pool of aptamer sequences. Next, we synthesize a custom array based on these sequences, and perform parallel affinity measurements to identify the highest-affinity aptamer for the target protein. We use this aptamer to form complexes that block the primary binding site on the target, and then screen the same array with these complexes to identify aptamers that bind secondary epitopes. We used AD-MAP <b>to</b> <b>discove...</b>|$|R

Hedonic pricing models are necessary to navigate through the layered management standards imposed by certified health and marketing programs on the cow-calf sector. Previous research in feeder calf pricing models provides insight on the use and development of ordinary least squares in estimating price effects. Breed, vaccination program, age-and-source verification and natural-beef production have become more relevant as vertical coordination has influenced commercial cow-calf producers. This study provides the industry with new information pertaining to the revenue opportunities that exist for cow-calf producers through increased coordination in the beef industry. Video and satellite auction markets are recognized as a national pricing mechanism for feeder cattle in the United States. These markets represent the management and marketing practices of national cow-calf producers and the tastes and preferences of a national stocker and feedlot industry.

40|$|ABSTRACT For {{the first}} half of the 20 th century, {{biological}} anthropology stagnated in a state in which racial typology was its major theoretical and methodological focus. In 1951, Sherwood Washburn proposed the “new physical anthropology ” that would move bio-logical anthropology beyond description. Washburn repositioned it into a science that focused on process, theory, and hypothesis test-ing. The commitment to a process-oriented biological anthropology has been slow, but there has been progress. Biocultural studies and functional anatomy have produced a more dynamic science characterized by hypothesis testing and a heightened concern for cau-sality. Unfortunately, a return to historical particularism has limited progress. An increasing interest in forensic application and resur-gent interest in measures of population distances and migrations represents a reversion to an earlier descriptive past.

40|$|In {{this essay}} I briefly criticize the {{methodology}} {{used in the}} recent publication, Small Arms Survey 2007, Guns and the City, to estimate global firearm stock. My critique will focus exclusively on Chapter 2, “Completing the Count, Civilian Firearms”, by Aaron Karn, which introduces important modifications to previous approaches used by the Small Arms Survey (SAS) group for estimating firearm stock (Killias, 1993; SAS 2002, 2006). The principal innovation in Chapter 2 is {{a new way to}} estimate the number of firearms held outside of national governments, referred to here as “civilian firearms”. Using this new approach, the SAS estimates have nearly doubled for world-wide firearm stock, jumping to 875 million from 500 million. This increase is only apparent, as it is due entirely to changing methods for estimating non-governmental firearms. The author asserts that 650 million of these firearms are held outside of government (by “civilians”). It is important to assess this new, and supposedly more sophisticated, approach in order to evaluate its contribution. The first point to consider is the doubtful utility of firearms stock as an explanatory variable. No empirical justification is offered, so it is somewhat surprising <b>to</b> <b>discove...</b>|$|R

One can attempt to focus research toward specific applications, but science {{has a way of}} surprising us. Think for example of the "charge-couple device", which was originally invented for memory storage, but became the modern digital camera that is used everywhere from camera phones to the Hubble Space Telescope. Using digital cameras, Hubble has taken pictures that reach back 12 billion light-years into the past, when the Universe was only 1 - 2 billion years old. Such results would never have been possible with the film cameras Hubble was originally supposed to use. Over the past two decades, Hubble and other telescopes have shown us much about the Universe [...] many of these results are shocking. Our galaxy is swarming with planets; most of the mass in the Universe is invisible; and our Universe is accelerating ever faster and faster for unknown reasons. Thus, we live in a "hell of a good universe", to quote e. e. cummings, that we fundamentally don't understand.

40|$|At every moment, a {{tropical}} reef coral interacts {{with millions of}} microbial organisms from {{tens of thousands of}} different species. Among these viruses, bacteria, archaea, dinoflagellates, and protists are cooperative symbionts as well as pathogens and parasites. Each interaction between a coral and a microscopic organism has ecological consequences for the coral community. In this dissertation, I show that juveniles of the Caribbean coral Montastraea faveolata suffer distance-dependent mortality in the presence of adult corals of the same species which is caused by microbial communities near these adults. This previously undiscovered structuring force will affect the spatial patterning of reefs and appears strong enough to drive the evolution of habitat selection behavior by coral larvae. The behavior of pre-settlement larvae differs based on both the microbial environment {{and the manner in which}} that environment is altered, indicating that water column microbes may be used as navigational information by dispersing corals. Sterilized seawater and penicillin both increase larval swimming rates, perhaps because larvae cannot detect the microbial "smell" of a suitable reef habitat, however only penicillin inhibits settlement and metamorphosis. Five antibiotics each induce a different pattern of abnormal behavior, indicating that the behavior of coral larvae could form the foundation of a new model system in toxicology. Furthermore, settlement failure on reefs may have a large behavioral component that has been underappreciated until now. The coral-dinoflagellate symbiosis is the best-known coral-microbe interaction however coral bleaching remains enigmatic. Based on observations made after {{a tropical}} storm, I propose that corals evolved bleaching as an adaptive mechanism to readjust symbiont communities after storm damage moves corallites into new light regimes. In a survey of viral diversity in the coral Diploria strigosa, I demonstrate that coral-associated viruses likely infect all other cells in the coral holobiont, including symbionts and potential pathogens. I propose that interactions among these viral groups could help to stabilize mutualistic coral-microbe interactions. Four additional natural history observations demonstrate the diversity of behaviors and interactions corals exhibit at the micron to millimeter scales and reveal that we have many more coral- microbe interactions left <b>to</b> <b>discove...</b>|$|R

Why can we only access such a {{small amount}} of the available chemical space — both in terms of the re actions used and the chemical scaffolds we make?

We performed a comprehensive analysis of organic reaction parameters dating back <b>to</b> 1771 and <b>discove</b> red that there are several anthropogenic factors that limit the reaction parameters and thus the scop e of synthetic chemistry. Nevertheless, many of the anthropogenic limitations such as the narrow parameter space and the opportunity of the rapid and clear feedback on the progress of reactions appear to be crucial for the acquisition of valid and reliable chemical intuition. In parallel, however, all of these same factors represent limitations for the exploration of available chemistry space and we argue th at these are thus at least partly responsible for limited access to new chemistries. We advocate, therefore, that the present anthropogenic boundaries can be expanded by a more conscious expl oration of “off - road” chemistry that would also extend the intuit ive knowledge of trained chemists...|$|R
40|$|Project JXTA[1, 2, 3] is an {{open-source}} {{project that}} defines {{a set of}} protocols for ad hoc, pervasive, peer-to-peer computing. The Project JXTA protocols establish a virtual network overlay {{on top of the}} Internet and non-IP networks, allowing peers to directly interact and organize independently of their network location (firewalls or NATs). The Project JXTA virtual network employs five abstractions that virtualize existing computing networks. First, Project JXTA uses a uniform peer addressing scheme that spans the entire JXTA network. Every peer is uniquely identified by a Peer ID, and its associated peer endpoint. Peer endpoints encapsulate all network interfaces usable by a peer. Second, Project JXTA lets peers dynamically self-organize into protected domains called peergroups. A peer can belong to as many peergroups as it wishes. Users, service providers, and network administrators can create peergroups to scope and control peer interactions. Peergroups virtualize the notion of firewalls, subdividing the network into secure regions without consideration for physical network boundaries.
