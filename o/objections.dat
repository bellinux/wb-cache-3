5|$|There {{were serious}} {{scientific}} <b>objections</b> {{to the process}} of natural selection as the key mechanism of evolution, including Karl von Nägeli's insistence that a trivial characteristic with no adaptive advantage could not be developed by selection. Darwin conceded that these could be linked to adaptive characteristics. His estimate that the age of the Earth allowed gradual evolution was disputed by William Thomson (later awarded the title Lord Kelvin), who calculated that it had cooled in less than 100 million years. Darwin accepted blending inheritance, but Fleeming Jenkin calculated that as it mixed traits, natural selection could not accumulate useful traits. Darwin tried to meet these <b>objections</b> in the 5th edition. Mivart supported directed evolution, and compiled scientific and religious <b>objections</b> to natural selection. In response, Darwin made considerable changes to the sixth edition. The problems of the age of the Earth and heredity were only resolved in the 20th century.|$|E

Some pipeline opponents were satisfied by Alyeska's preliminary design, which incorporated underground and raised crossings for caribou and other big game, gravel and styrofoam insulation to prevent permafrost melting, automatic leak detection and shutoff, and other techniques. Other opponents, including fishermen who feared tanker leaks south of Valdez, maintained their disagreement with the plan.|$|E

40|$|Conscientious <b>objection</b> to abortion, clinicians' {{refusal to}} perform legal abortions because of their {{religious}} or moral beliefs, {{has been the subject}} of increasing debate among bioethicists, policymakers, and public health advocates in recent years. Conscientious <b>objection</b> policies are intended to balance reproductive rights and clinicians' beliefs. However, in practice, clinician <b>objection</b> can act as a barrier to abortion access-impinging on reproductive rights, and increasing unsafe abortion and related morbidity and mortality. There is little information about conscientious <b>objection</b> from a medical or public health perspective. A quantitative instrument is needed to assess prevalence of conscientious <b>objection</b> and to provide insight on its practice. This paper describes the development of a survey instrument to measure conscientious <b>objection</b> to abortion provision. A literature review, and in-depth formative interviews with stakeholders in Colombia were used to develop a conceptual model of conscientious <b>objection.</b> This model led to the development of a survey, which was piloted, and then administered, in Ghana. The model posits three domains of conscientious <b>objection</b> that form the basis for the survey instrument: 1) beliefs about abortion and conscientious objection; 2) actions related to conscientious <b>objection</b> and abortion; and 3) self-identification as a conscientious objector. The instrument is intended to be used to assess prevalence among clinicians trained to provide abortions, and to gain insight on how conscientious <b>objection</b> is practiced in a variety of settings. Its results can inform more effective and appropriate strategies to regulate conscientious <b>objection...</b>|$|R
