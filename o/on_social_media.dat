5000|$|<b>Social</b> <b>media</b> {{has turned}} to be a crucial {{platform}} for celebrities to engage with their followers. <b>On</b> <b>social</b> <b>medias,</b> the boundaries between interpersonal and mass communication is blurred, and parasocial interaction (PSI) is adopted strategically by celebrities to enhance liking, intimacy and credibility from their followers. As Ledbetter and Redd notes, [...] "During PSI, people interact with a media figure, to some extent, {{as if they were}} in an actual interpersonal relationships with the target entity." [...] For celebrities, professional self-disclosure (e.g. information as to upcoming events) and personal self-disclosure (e.g. emotions and feelings) are two primary ways to cultivate illusory intimacy with their followers and to expand their fan bases. What is worth noting is that unlike in real-life interpersonal relationship, disclosure reciprocity is not expected in parasocial interactions, although through imagined interactions <b>on</b> <b>social</b> <b>medias,</b> followers do feel they are connected to the media figures.|$|R
