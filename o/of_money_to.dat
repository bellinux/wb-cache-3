5|$|Although never gaining wide fame, Ali had a {{dedicated}} following on the vaudeville circuit in the United States. He performed for {{heads of state}} including Tsar NicholasII of Russia. Judy Garland named him her favorite vaudevillian and David Blaine identified Ali as his favorite magician. Portions of his act were captured in the short film Strange as It Seems (1930) and in Politiquerias (1931), the Spanish-language version of Laurel and Hardy's Chickens Come Home. Two documentaries contain footage of Ali taken from Politiquerias: 1977's Gizmo!, and 1999's Vaudeville. Ali's unusual gastric abilities led to rumors that the Rockefeller Institute had offered a large sum <b>of</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> obtain his stomach post-mortem. After he died in England, his body was offered to Johns Hopkins University for study, though the offer was declined.|$|E
5|$|Anthony {{passed on}} both the castle and a {{considerable}} fortune to his son, yet another Sir Edward Hungerford, in 1657.

Edward lived a lavish lifestyle, however, including giving a huge gift <b>of</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> the exiled Charles II shortly before his restoration to the throne, and later entertaining the royal court at Farleigh Hungerford Castle in 1673. Edward later fell out with the king over the proposal that the Roman Catholic James II should succeed to the throne on Charles's death, and after {{the discovery of the}} Rye House Plot in 1683 the castle was searched by royal officials looking for stocks of weapons that might be used in a possible revolt.|$|E

50|$|British {{classical}} economists in the 19th {{century had}} a well-developed controversy between theBanking and the Currency School. This parallels recent debates between {{proponents of the}} theory <b>of</b> endogeneous <b>money,</b> such as Nicholas Kaldor, and monetarists, such as Milton Friedman. Monetarists {{and members of the}} currency school argued that banks can and should control the supply <b>of</b> <b>money.</b> According <b>to</b> their theories, inflation is caused by banks issuing an excessive supply <b>of</b> <b>money.</b> According <b>to</b> proponents <b>of</b> the theory <b>of</b> endogenous <b>money,</b> the supply <b>of</b> <b>money</b> automatically adjusts <b>to</b> the demand, and banks can only control the terms (e.g., the rate of interest) on which loans are made.|$|R

5|$|Demand {{for tickets}} by Alabama fans {{was so great}} that the Alabama ticket office accidentally {{oversold}} its allotment of tickets. The office neglected to limit purchases on the forms sent to season-ticket holders, and the office received more than 25,000 orders for its 12,500-ticket allotment. An additional 2,000 tickets were given to Alabama, but the school still had to send out more than 10,000 refunds. Alabama's athletics director was heavily criticized for overselling the ticket allotment and for limiting ticket distribution to fans who had contributed large amounts <b>of</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> the athletics department. A group of fans disgruntled at the ticket distribution process eventually levied a class-action lawsuit against the athletic director, claiming contract violations.|$|E

Century magazine offered Grant a book contract with a 10 percent royalty, but Grant's friend Mark Twain, understanding how bad Grant's financial condition was, made him an offer for his memoirs which paid an unheard-of 75 percent royalty. To provide for his family, Grant worked intensely on his memoirs {{at his home in}} New York City. His former staff member Adam Badeau assisted him with much of the research, while his son Frederick located documents and did much of the fact-checking.
