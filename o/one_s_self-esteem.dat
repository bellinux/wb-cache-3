40|$|This study {{analyzed}} {{the effects of}} participation in low-impact aerobics in conjunction with individual counseling on the self-esteem of a single subject, a woman {{over the age of}} eighteen. Previously research has concluded that physical exercise has had positive effects on self-esteem. There has also been research which assessed the effects of physical exercise in combination with counseling; however there is limitations to this research in that {{there is a lack of}} these studies which are relative to women. Over a ten week period, with the baseline and intervention phases each consisting of five weeks, a woman 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>self-esteem</b> was determined via the Index of Self-esteem. During the five week intervention, the woman participated in low-impact aerobics three times a week and received individual counseling sessions with the researcher for one hour each week.

40|$|Data {{from the}} National Survey of Children {{were used to}} study the {{relationships}} between children 2 ̆ 7 s perceptions of parental support and control and measures of self-esteem and behavior problems over time. Data were collected in 1976, when the children were aged 7 - 11; 1981, when the children were in their early to mid teens (age 12 to 16); and 1987, when the children were {{in their late teens}} and early 20 s (age 17 to 22). Parenting measures, based on children 2 ̆ 7 s reports, were developed for each wave from items included in the data; constructed variables measuring self -esteem and internal and external expressions of behavior problems were also comprised of individual items drawn from each wave of data. Preliminary analyses showed that parental support was positively correlated to children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>self-esteem</b> and negatively related to behavior problems. Although the parental control measures had little effect on the outcome variables, the effect that was present showed that parental coerciveness, rejection, and permissiveness were negatively correlated with children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>self-esteem,</b> while being positively associated with both internal and external behavior problems. The preliminary results also showed that the parental effects of mothers and fathers differed for daughters and sons. LISREL analyses were done in an effort to more fully investigate the interactive effects between the constructed variables of interest. Generally, the measures were related as expected, although the relationships were not as strong as anticipated. Of the parenting measures, parental support showed the strongest effects on child outcomes; parental control measures had very little effect on children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>self-esteem</b> or behavior problems. In 1987, parenting style had virtually no effect on youths 2 ̆ 7 self-esteem or on behavior problems. For this wave, self-esteem was the strongest predictor of behavior problems in young adults...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present paper was to study the effects of {{self-esteem}} on the perception of other 2 ̆ 7 s personality. Subjects were 131 middle school pupils (72 boys and 59 girls). Other 2 ̆ 7 s sociometric status in his classmates and perceiver 2 ̆ 7 s interpersonal feelings were measured by the near-sociometric test. Perceiver 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>self-esteem</b> was measured by the self-steem scale developed by Nemoto. The self-differential scales were used to rate self and others. Each perceiver rated his real-self, ideal-self and 6 persons (a liked person and a disliked person each from high-, middle-, and low-sociometric-status group). The main results were as follows; (1) High-self-esteem subjects perceived their real-self more desirable than low-self-esteem subjects did. In female subjects, this tendency was found in their ideal-self-rating, too. (2) High-self-esteem subjects perceived liked persons more desirable than low-self-esteem subjects did. But when the liked persons were belonged to low-socio-metric-status group, this tendency was not found. (3) In perceiving disliked persons, there was no relation between perceiver 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>self-esteem</b> and perception of other 2 ̆ 7 s personality. (4) The correlation between real- and ideal-self was higer in the high-self-esteem subjects than in the low-self-esteem subjects. (5) Subjects of high-self-esteem had higher correlation between real-self and liked-other rating. (6) Ideal-self rating of high-self-esteem subjects more highly correlated to liked-other rating than that of low-self-esteem subjects did. (7) When the other was disliked-one, or belonged to low-sociometric-status group, the tendency of (5) and (6) was not found.

40|$|The {{relationships}} {{between humans and}} animals {{have been associated with}} various therapeutic implications. While there is no agreed upon name, the term “pet facilitated therapy” has become widely accepted. Pet facilitated therapy has been particularly adopted to describe the relationship between humans and domestic animals. In contrast to public attitudes of twenty years ago, the field of animal-human relationships is now respected as a legitimate area of research investigation (Levinson, 1982). Numerous studies have been conducted on the benefits of the {{relationships between}} domestic animals and humans; however, there continues to be little empirical evidence that specifically addresses the relationship between humans and horses. Therapeutic horseback riding, a term which takes into account the relationship formed with the horse both while riding and on the ground, has been widely accepted among the professionals in the field. Despite this agreement, applied research in the field is needed to validate its apparent benefits. ^ The present study was developed to determine how a therapeutic horseback riding program can predict outcome on self-esteem, frustration tolerance, depression and anxiety. Participants were 81 emotionally disturbed males between the ages of 6 – 16 who were students in a residential treatment center. Results were analyzed using zero-order correlations and a series of setwise multiple regression equations. The results indicated that children who experienced a meaningful bond to a horse were more anxious and depressed. However, the bond with a horse did not significantly influence a child 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>self-esteem</b> or frustration tolerance. Children who were more involved in the horsemanship program tended to be less depressed and anxious. A child 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>self-esteem</b> and frustration tolerance were not affected by their involvement in the horsemanship program. Children 2 ̆ 7 s conduct in the horsemanship program did not significantly influence their self-esteem, frustration tolerance, depression or anxiety. Implications of these results are for the therapeutic use of horseback riding as an adjunct or alternative therapy for emotionally handicapped individuals. ...|$|R

Both questionnaires were administered to a population of 106 subjects comprising four different groups: jail inmates, alcohol diversion clients, post-hospital psychiatric patients, and mental health professionals. Cohesion {{was found to be}} associated with Affiliation but Adaptation had no relationship to Autonomy. Differences were found between Balanced and Extreme type families when compared across SASB quadrants. The Extreme type family was characterized as having low Affiliation. The Extreme child 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>self-esteem</b> was effected more by the relationship with the father than with the mother.

Xbox <b>One</b> <b>S</b> also ships with a revision of the Xbox One controller, with textured grips and Bluetooth support.|$|R

While their rear-facing cameras use identical 8-megapixel sensors, for the front-facing camera the <b>One</b> <b>S</b> has a VGA cam and video capture fixed at 640 x 480 resolution compared to the One X's 1.3-megapixel sensor with 720p HD video capture. In North America, the <b>One</b> <b>S</b> and <b>One</b> X are usually not sold by the same carrier, for instance T-Mobile and Telus offer the <b>One</b> <b>S,</b> while AT&T and Rogers sell the One X. An update to Sense 5 and Android 4.2.2 was announced and later cancelled. The reason HTC gave was that since there are two distinct versions of this phone with two different SoCs and since Qualcomm ended support for it, they {{said it would be}} expensive to make the update and as to not confuse people, they canceled it.|$|R
