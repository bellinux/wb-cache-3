5|$|A {{few minutes}} later at 11:00, The Great Artiste dropped {{instruments}} attached to three parachutes. These instruments also contained an unsigned letter to Professor Ryokichi Sagane, a physicist at the University of Tokyo who studied with three of the scientists responsible for the atomic bomb at the University of California, Berkeley, urging him to tell {{the public about the}} danger involved with these weapons of mass destruction. The messages were found by military authorities but not turned over to Sagane until a month later. In 1949, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>authors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> letter, Luis Alvarez, met with Sagane and signed the document.|$|E
5|$|Soon after, {{physicists}} were {{rocked by}} the news that Wu and Tsung-Dao Lee had demonstrated in the Wu experiment that parity is not conserved in weak interactions. This inspired Ward to consider particle physics again. Along with many others, he consider how gauge theory {{could be applied to}} Fermi's theory of beta decay. Ward became one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>authors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Standard Model of gauge particle interactions; his contributions on electromagnetic and weak interactions were published in a series of papers he co-authored with Abdus Salam. Ward wrote a note to Abdus, informing him that Albert Einstein would be spinning in his grave, presumably clockwise.|$|E

25|$|A 2007 {{study of}} sebecids {{reclassified}} several species. The two species S. huilensis and S. querejazus were given their own genera, Zulmasuchus and Langstonia, respectively.

Zulmasuchus querejazus, named after Zulma Gasparini, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>authors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study, differs from Sebecus in its wider snout.|$|E

25|$|The quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns was a {{literary}} and artistic quarrel that heated {{up in the}} early 1690s and shook the Académie française. The opposing two sides were, the Ancients (Anciens) who constrain choice of subjects to those drawn from the literature of Antiquity and the Moderns (Modernes), who supported the merits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>authors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> century of Louis XIV. Fontenelle quickly followed with his Digression sur les anciens et les modernes (1688), in which he took the Modern side, pressing the argument that modern scholarship allowed modern man to surpass the ancients in knowledge.|$|E
25|$|The Smeed {{committee}} members had already become frustrated and moved on. In 1966, Smeed was appointed Professor of Traffic Studies at University College London (UCL) and formed the then Research Group in Traffic Studies, which grew {{to become the}} present Centre for Transport Studies at UCL within the University of London Centre for Transport Studies. The chair of the parallel and quasi-competing committee, Professor Sir Colin Buchanan took up a post as professor of transport at Imperial College in 1963. Roth, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>authors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> report, acrimoniously left the country to join the World Bank in 1967, citing the delays and the mutation of the pricing scheme from an enabling investment-raising mechanism into a method of restriction.|$|E
25|$|He {{represented}} West Virginia in the US House of Representatives from 1911 to 1913, {{where he}} was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>authors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Clayton Act. Davis also served {{as one of the}} managers in the successful impeachment trial of Judge Robert W. Archbald. He served as US Solicitor General from 1913 to 1918 and as ambassador to the United Kingdom from 1918 to 1921. As Solicitor General, he successfully argued in Guinn v. United States for the illegality of Oklahoma’s “grandfather law”. That law exempted residents descended from a voter registered in 1866 (i.e. whites) from a literacy test which effectively disenfranchised blacks. Davis's personal posture differed from his position as an advocate. Throughout his career, he could separate his personal views and professional advocacy.|$|E

25|$|There {{have been}} {{occasions}} were the bullying was not intentional, but still occurred. It {{should be noted}} that even if the bullying was not consciously intended it can still have awful impacts. One study concluded that people had been ostracised online as a way of protecting another group of people. One woman had been listed as a political opponent on a pro-trans website due to misunderstandings and alternating views, which resulted in targeted messages and harassment. The listed person in question did not actually have any reservations against the trans community, and so they ended up being the bullied person. While the motivations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>authors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> website are unknown, it can be assumed that they did not specifically aim to target the person effected and thus the bullying was an inconsiderate result.|$|E
25|$|The {{historian}} C.H. Firth {{opined that}} Lilburne had gained a great reputation for courage {{and seems to}} have been a good officer, but his military career was unlucky. He spent about six months in prison at Oxford, was plundered of all he had at Rupert's relief of Newark (22 March 1644), was shot through the arm at the taking of Walton Hall, near Wakefield (3 June 1644), and received very little pay. His arrears when he left the service amounted to £880. He also succeeded in quarrelling, first with Colonel King and then with the Earl of Manchester, both of whom he regarded as lukewarm, incapable, and treacherous. He did his best to get King cashiered, and was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>authors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> charge of high treason against him, which was presented to the House of Commons by some of the committee of Lincoln in August 1644. The dispute with Manchester was due to Lilburne's summoning and capturing Tickhill Castle against Manchester's orders, and Lilburne was one of Cromwell's witnesses in his charge against Manchester.|$|E
25|$|After their {{experiences}} at the Eastern Front, having learned about mass murder in Poland and Russia, Hans Scholl and Alexander Schmorell {{felt compelled to}} take action. From end of June until mid of July 1942, they wrote the first four leaflets. Quoting extensively from the Bible, Aristotle and Novalis, as well as Goethe and Schiller, the iconic poets of German bourgeoisie, they appealed to what they considered the German intelligentsia, believing that these people would be easily convinced by the same arguments that also motivated the authors themselves. These leaflets were left in telephone books in public phone booths, mailed to professors and students, and taken by courier to other universities for distribution. From 23 July to 30 October 1942, Graf, Scholl and Schmorell served again at the Russian front, and activities ceased until their return. In autumn 1942, Sophie Scholl discovered that her brother Hans was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>authors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pamphlets, and joined the group. Shortly after, Willi Graf, {{and by the end}} of December 1942, Kurt Huber became members of the White Rose.|$|E
