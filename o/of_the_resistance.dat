5|$|The attempt <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>resistance</b> {{to enter}} {{mainstream}} politics with a formal party, the Belgian Democratic Union, failed {{to attract the}} level of support that similar parties had managed in France and elsewhere.

5|$|Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>resistance</b> {{was focused}} in the French-speaking areas of Belgium (Wallonia {{and the city}} of Brussels), {{although}} Flemish involvement in the resistance was also significant.

5|$|The {{deportation}} of Belgian workers proved {{insufficient to}} meet German industrial needs {{and had little}} effect economically.

5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{destruction}} of food crops, many civilians were forced to leave the hills and surrender to the TNI. Often, when surviving villagers came down to lower-lying regions to surrender, the military would execute them. Those who were not killed outright by TNI troops were sent to receiving centers for vetting, which had been prepared in advance in the vicinity of local TNI bases. In these transit camps, the surrendered civilians were registered and interrogated. Those who were suspected of being members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>resistance</b> were killed.|$|E

5|$|Bantu Stephen Biko was an anti-apartheid {{activist who}} was a {{founding}} member of the South African Students' Organisation in 1968 and the Black People's Convention in 1972. Through these groups, and through other activities, he promoted the ideas of the Black Consciousness movement, and became a prominent member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>resistance</b> to apartheid in the 1970s. The government of South Africa placed a banning order on him in 1973, preventing him from leaving his hometown, meeting with more than one person, publishing his writing, and speaking in public. In August 1977 Biko was arrested for breaking his banning order.|$|E
5|$|Belgium's {{strategic}} location {{meant that}} it constituted an important supply hub for the whole German army in Northern Europe and particularly northern France. Sabotage was therefore an important duty <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>resistance.</b> Following the Normandy landings in June 1944 on orders from the Allies, the Belgian resistance began to step up its sabotage against German supply lines across the country. Between June and September alone, 95 railroad bridges, 285 locomotives, 1,365 wagons and 17 tunnels were all blown up by the Belgian resistance. Telegraph lines were also cut and road bridges and canals used to transport material sabotaged. In one notable action, 600 German soldiers were killed when a railway bridge between La Gleize and Stoumont in the Ardennes was blown up by 40 members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>resistance,</b> including the writer Herman Bodson. Indeed, more German troops were reportedly killed in Belgium in 1941 than in all of Occupied France. Through its sabotage activities alone, one resistance group, , required the Germans to expend between 20 and 25 million man-hours of labour on repairing damage done, including ten million in the night of 15–16 January 1944 alone.|$|E

5|$|In July 1942, South West Pacific Area, {{became aware}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>resistance</b> {{movements}} forming in occupied Philippines through attempted radio communications to Allies {{outside of the}} Philippines; by late 1942, couriers had made it to Australia confirming the existence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>resistance.</b> By December 1942, SWPA sent Captain Jesús A. Villamor to the Philippines {{to make contact with}} guerrilla organizations, eventually developing extensive intelligence networks including contacts within the Second Republic Government. In addition, through the Allied Intelligence Bureau's Philippine Regional Section, SWPA began to send operatives, and equipment, into the Philippines to make contact and supply guerrilla organizations. Unique to other guerrillas in the Philippines were the Wa Chi; a resistance unit composed of Filipino-Chinese and Chinese immigrants. They were established to counter the Japanese suspicion and abuse of the Chinese living in the country, and had over 700 men strong. The movement was aided by the American guerrilla forces and were also supported by anti-Japanese civilians and farmers living in the outskirts. In Nueva Ecija, guerrillas led by Juan Pajota and Eduardo Joson protected the U.S. Army Rangers and Alamo Scouts who were conducting a rescue mission of Allied POWS from a counterattack by Japanese reinforcements. Pajota and the Filipino guerrillas received Bronze Stars for their role in the raid. Among the guerrilla units, the Blue Eagles were a specialized unit established for landmine and sniper detection, as well as in hunting Japanese spies who have blended in with the civilian population.|$|E
