25|$|On June 18, 1998, Propair Flight 420, a Metro II {{flying from}} Dorval International Airport (now Montreal-Trudeau International Airport) to Peterborough Airport in Peterborough, Ontario, {{experienced}} a left wheel well fire when the overheated brake and wheel assembly was retracted into the enclosed wheel well. The heat dissipated to the tire {{and the surrounding}} structures, eventually causing a fire. During the attempted emergency landing at Mirabel Airport, the landing gear was extended <b>on</b> <b>short</b> <b>final</b> and when the aircraft was over the runway, the left wing broke upwards, the fuselage pivoted {{to the left and}} struck the ground. All 11 occupants were fatally injured.|$|E
2500|$|After {{entering}} {{service with}} the US Army, the aircraft received {{the reputation of}} a [...] "" [...] due to the early models' high accident rate during takeoffs and landings. The Marauder had to be flown at exact airspeeds, particularly on final runway approach and when one engine was out. The 150mph (241km/h) speed <b>on</b> <b>short</b> <b>final</b> runway approach was intimidating to pilots who were used to much slower speeds, and whenever they slowed down to speeds below what the manual stated, the aircraft would stall and crash.|$|E
2500|$|Weather {{conditions}} were deteriorating during Flight 2605's instrument approach. A 5:00 weather report indicated visibility of 2-3 nautical miles depending on direction; by 6:00 AM, visibility {{was described as}} [...] "zero". [...] Flight 2605 was <b>on</b> <b>short</b> <b>final</b> to the closed runway at 5:42 AM. Cockpit voice recording audio of the last seconds of the flight indicated that the first officer and captain agreed that they were cleared for 23R (not the runway they were still on approach to). The captain further stated {{that they were in}} fact (still) on the approach to 23L. [...] The crew decided to abort the landing at this point. [...] The flight's first officer began to describe the ILS approach's missed approach procedure, a climb to 8,500 feet, in a [...] "nonurgent, perfunctory manner". Before any go-around power was added, the flight touched down hard on the unpaved left shoulder of Runway 23L with more than 2 g of force, at 130 knots of speed.|$|E

2500|$|Shortly after 1400 {{hours on}} Wednesday, March 23, 1994, a two-seat F-16D Fighting Falcon (AF Ser. No. 88-0171, c/n 1D-25, of the 74th Fighter Squadron, 23rd Operations Group) with two pilots on board was {{conducting}} a simulated flameout (SFO) approach when it {{collided with a}} C-130E Hercules, (AF Ser. No. 68-10942, c/n 4322, of the 2nd Airlift Squadron, 317th Group). Both aircraft {{were members of the}} 23rd Wing, which was the host unit at Pope AFB at the time. The aircraft were <b>on</b> <b>short</b> <b>final</b> approach to runway 23 at an altitude of about [...] above ground level. The nose of the F-16D severed the C-130E's right elevator. On impact, the F-16 pilot applied full afterburner to try to recover the aircraft, but it began to disintegrate, showering debris on the runway and a road that ran around it. Both F-16 crewmembers ejected, but their aircraft, still on full afterburner, continued on an arc towards Green Ramp. At the same time, the C-130 crew took their aircraft away from the airfield and checked to ensure it could safely land. While the C-130 crew knew they were most likely struck by the F-16, they had no idea how it happened or the extent of the damage. After performing their checks, the crew returned to Pope and landed on the debris-littered runway.|$|E

5000|$|On 2 March 1989, a Dan Air HS 748 mistakenly {{landed at}} Langford Lodge Airport {{instead of the}} nearby Belfast Aldergrove Airport, the {{intended}} destination of the scheduled service from Newcastle. When the aircraft broke cloud over Lough Neagh <b>on</b> <b>short</b> <b>finals</b> for Aldergrove's runway 07, the pilot in command thought what he had spotted was the correct runway and proceeded to land the plane at {{what turned out to}} be the adjacent, privately owned, Langford Lodge airfield, just under a mile short of the approach to runway 07 at Aldergrove.|$|R

5000|$|In Welsh, word stress usually {{falls on}} the {{penultimate}} syllable, but one way of indicating stress <b>on</b> a <b>final</b> (<b>short)</b> vowel is {{through the use of}} the acute accent, often found on e in borrowed words: personél [...] "personnel", sigarét [...] "cigarette", ymbarél [...] "umbrella".|$|R
25|$|At 07:23, {{the crew}} {{stated that the}} fire in the left wing had died out. However, less than four minutes later, they {{announced}} that the fire had started again. The aircraft became harder to control and even started to roll. Maximum aileron trim were set by the crew. While Flight 420 was <b>short</b> <b>on</b> <b>final,</b> the landing gear was deployed.|$|R
50|$|On 22 May 1954, NAC DC-3, ZK-AQT Piere {{operating}} as Flight 152 from Christchurch crash landed {{and burst into}} flames on Kohutuhutu Rd in the beachside settlement of Raumati when approaching Paraparaumu Airport <b>on</b> <b>short</b> <b>finals.</b> Of the 26 people on board, 23 survived after the pilot, Captain Bill Pettet, {{managed to get the}} passenger door open in time. The three deceased victims were unaccompanied infant children. The cause of the crash was fuel starvation after the wrong fuel line cutover switch was activated. When the problem was noticed an attempt to restart the engines failed as the aircraft hit macrocarpa trees and plunged onto the road below Dr. Stevenson-Wright's weekend residence, where miraculously the fuselage rested {{right in the middle of}} the road without further collision. The doctor and his visitors ran to the passengers' aid, and fortunately most of them were able to walk out relatively unharmed. The doctor and visitors had been enjoying a coffee break while looking out to the sea when they saw the plane heading straight for their house, which it would have hit if not for the tree. As a result of the death of the three children, NAC was ordered to have a stewardess on board all DC-3s with a ban on unaccompanied children under 12 years of age until then.|$|R

5000|$|The {{most direct}} {{continuation}} of the acute is in Latvian, particularly in the three-tone central dialects. There, the acute register is directly continued as a broken tone (lauztā) in originally unstressed syllables, marked with a circumflex diacritic: luôgs [...] "window". In originally-stressed syllables, the acute register is continued as a rising or lengthened intonation (stieptā), marked with a tilde: luõks [...] "spring onion". The circumflex register is generally continued as a falling intonation (krītošā), marked with a grave accent: lùoks [...] "arch, bow". It can occur on all syllables: locative plural gal̂vâs [...] "on the heads" [...] (compare: Lithuanian galvosè with stress <b>on</b> a <b>short</b> <b>final</b> vowel, deleted in Latvian), including monosyllables: dêt [...] "to lay eggs" [...] < *dêtì.|$|R
5000|$|One Sawyer KC-135A (61-0313) {{became famous}} {{throughout}} the SAC community as [...] "the glider" [...] when it {{ran out of}} fuel <b>on</b> a <b>short</b> <b>final</b> approach prior to landing at its home base after flying practice approaches at nearby Kincheloe AFB to complete requalification training. The flight crew, {{with the exception of}} the instructor pilot, bailed out when the engines went quiet. The instructor pilot, who remained on board, landed the aircraft just short of the runway overrun, bounced and rolled to a stop on the runway. The aircraft was repaired and returned to service quickly and even the crew entry door (which separated from the aircraft during bailout procedures) was returned to the Air Force by a local farmer.|$|R
