40|$|Abstract: The {{optimization}} parison thickness {{can reduce}} the <b>oil</b> <b>drum</b> weight and meet the requirement of the minimum thickness. The profile thickness of the extruded parison can be optimized by simulation. Under different blowing pressures, extrusion blow molding non-isothermal process of the high density polyethylene <b>oil</b> <b>drum</b> with a handle was simulated by using Polyflow. The initial parison was respectively divided into 11, 51, 101 and infinite segments. After seven optimizations, the <b>oil</b> <b>drum</b> wall thickness was equal or larger than 2 mm. An appropriate inflation pressure of 0. 6 MPa was obtained. The {{results show that the}} production efficiency increases with the inflation pressure increasing. With the parison segments increasing, the <b>oil</b> <b>drum</b> thickness distribution inflated from the optimized parison is more uniform and approaches to the required thickness. The <b>oil</b> <b>drum</b> mass is decreased with the segments increasing. It is necessary that the non-uniform thickness parison was produced by injection molding...|$|R

2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} contributions of Trinidad and Tobago to the world of music was the invention of the steelpan.

The first steel-pans were made from <b>oil</b> <b>drums.</b> The players would beat {{on the end of the}} <b>oil</b> <b>drum</b> with bamboo to produce music and found that the areas of the drum that were hit the most frequently developed a higher pitch. From this discovery the players learned that they could change the pitch of the drum to create different notes.|$|R
