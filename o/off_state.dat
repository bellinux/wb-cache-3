40|$|Summary There is {{some concern}} that vehicle {{direction}} indicator lamps with clear outer lenses make it difficult in bright, sunny conditions {{to decide whether the}} signal is on or not. This study photo-metrically evaluated, under bright, sunny conditions, both luminance contrast and colour contrast between the on and <b>off</b> <b>states</b> for {{direction indicator lamps}} that use either an amber lens or a dear lens. The results indicate that luminance contrast between the on and <b>off</b> <b>states</b> is greater for lamps using an amber lens. On the other hand, the results indicate that colour contrast between the on and <b>off</b> <b>states</b> is greater for lamps using a clear lens. Because luminance contrast {{is likely to be the}} primary variable influencing driver performance, these results suggest that using clear-lens direction indicators is likely to make it more difficult to determine, in bright, sunny conditions, whether the signal is on or not. However, the magnitude of the decrement in real-world performance with dear-lens signal lamps remains to be ascertained. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{in-depth}} {{analysis of the}} spectral and temporal behavior of a long almost uninterrupted INTEGRAL observation of Vela X- 1 in Nov/Dec 2003. In addition to an already high activity level, Vela X- 1 exhibited several very intense flares with a maximum intensity of more than 5 Crab in the 20 - 40 keV band. Furthermore Vela X- 1 exhibited several <b>off</b> <b>states</b> where the source became undetectable with ISGRI. We interpret flares and <b>off</b> <b>states</b> as being due to the strongly structured wind of the optical companion: when Vela X- 1 encounters a cavity in the wind with strongly reduced density, the flux drops, thus potentially triggering {{the onset of the}} propeller effect which inhibits further accretion, thus giving rise to the <b>off</b> <b>states.</b> The required drop in density to trigger the propeller effect in Vela X- 1 is of the same order as predicted by theoretical papers for the densities in the OB star winds. The same structured wind can give rise to the giant flares when Vela X- 1 encounters a dense blob in the wind. Further temporal analysis reveals that a short lived QPO with a period of ~ 6800 sec is present. The part of the light curve during which the QPO is present is very close to the <b>off</b> <b>states</b> and just following a high intensity state, thus showing that all these phenomena are related.

40|$|Aims. We {{investigate}} the spectral and temporal {{behavior of the}} high mass X-ray binary Vela X- 1 during a phase of high activity, with special focus on the observed giant flares and <b>off</b> <b>states.</b> Methods. INTEGRAL observed Vela X- 1 in a long almost uninterrupted observation for two weeks in 2003 Nov/Dec. The data were analyzed with OSA 7. 0 and FTOOLS 6. 2. We derive the pulse period, light curves, spectra, hardness ratios, hardness intensity diagrams, and study the eclipse. Results. In addition to an already high activity level, Vela X- 1 exhibited several very intense flares, the brightest ones reaching a maximum intensity of more than 5 Crab in the 20 - 40 keV band and several <b>off</b> <b>states</b> where the source is no longer detected by INTEGRAL. We determine the pulse period to be 283. 5320 +/- 0. 0002 s which is stable throughout the whole observation. Analyzing the eclipses resulted in an improvement of the ephemeris. Spectral analysis of the flares shows that {{there seem to be}} two types of flares: relatively brief flares which can be extremely intense, and show spectral softening, contrary to high intensity states which are longer and show no softening. Conclusions. Both flares and <b>off</b> <b>states</b> are interpreted as being due to a strongly structured wind of the optical companion. When Vela X- 1 encounters a cavity with strongly reduced density, the flux will drop triggering the onset of the propeller effect which inhibits further accretion, thus giving rise to <b>off</b> <b>states.</b> The required drop of the density of the material to trigger the propeller effect in Vela X- 1 is of the same order as predicted by theoretical papers on the densities in the OB star winds.
