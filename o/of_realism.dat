40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the character of}} Norberto Bobbio's thought and strives to argue in favor of its inclusion amongst the theoretical constellation <b>of</b> political <b>realism.</b> The reflection shows how Bobbio's theses coincide with the more idiosyncratic elements <b>of</b> political <b>realism,</b> as opposed to Michelangelo Bovero's arguments. It also illustrates that the distinct seal <b>of</b> his <b>realism</b> is his subordinate perspective, differing from the readings of Perry Anderson and Ronald J. Terchek...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the robustness {{with respect to}} violation <b>of</b> local <b>realism</b> subsequent to entanglement swapping of partially depolarised states. We consider different configurations {{of the process of}} entanglement swapping. The strength of violation <b>of</b> local <b>realism</b> by the state obtained after entanglement swapping, is compared with the one for the input states. We obtain a kind of superadditivity of violation <b>of</b> local <b>realism</b> for Werner states consequent upon entanglement swapping involving Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state measurements. This indicates that checking for violation <b>of</b> local <b>realism,</b> in the state obtained after entanglement swapping, can be a method for detecting entanglement in the input state of the swapping procedure...|$|R
5|$|Animation {{director}} Toshihiko Nishikubo {{was responsible}} for the realism and strove for accurate depictions of movement and effects. The pursuit <b>of</b> <b>realism</b> included the staff conducting firearms research at a facility in Guam. Nishikubo has highlighted the tank scene {{as an example of the}} movie's realism, noting that bullets create sparks when hitting metal, but do not spark when a bullet strikes stone.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, Barlow won an All About Soap {{award for}} Rae's love-triangle storyline. AfterElton criticised {{the lack of}} {{character}} development Rae received, and along with the Sunday Mercury, bemoaned the dearth <b>of</b> <b>realism</b> exhibited in Rae staying with Ste despite knowing that he was homosexual.

5|$|In {{an attempt}} to create a sense <b>of</b> <b>realism</b> for the storyline, {{principal}} CNN news outlet commentators were scripted into Contact. More than 25 news reporters from CNN had roles in the film and the CNN programs Larry King Live and Crossfire were also included. Ann Druyan makes a cameo appearance as herself, debating with Rob Lowe's character, Richard Rank, on Crossfire. In January 1997, a second unit was sent to Puerto Rico for one week at the Arecibo Observatory.|$|E

50|$|In the {{philosophy}} <b>of</b> mathematics, <b>realism</b> is {{the claim that}} mathematical entities such as 'number' have an observer-independent existence.

5|$|Some critics {{consider}} Balzac's writing exemplary of naturalism—a more pessimistic {{and analytical}} form <b>of</b> <b>realism,</b> {{which seeks to}} explain human behavior as intrinsically linked with the environment. French novelist Émile Zola declared Balzac {{the father of the}} naturalist novel. Zola indicated that whilst the Romantics saw the world through a colored lens, the naturalist sees through a clear glass—precisely the sort of effect Balzac attempted to achieve in his works.|$|E
5|$|The figures, the {{minutely}} detailed clothes, and {{the architecture}} of the room and windows are depicted with a high degree <b>of</b> <b>realism.</b> Van Eyck's mastery at handling oil {{can be seen in the}} differing breadths of brush strokes. The precision of the detail achieved is especially noticeable in the rendering of threads of St. Donatian's blue and golden embroidered cope and mitre, in the weave of the oriental carpet, and in the stubble and veins on van der Paele's aging face.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} adapted by the writer Nick Dear, who {{considered}} the story more mature than Austen's other novels. He characterised {{it as one}} <b>of</b> <b>realism</b> and truthfulness, particularly in {{telling the story of}} two people separated and then reunited. As Austen's narrative style conveys Anne's thoughts internally, Dear and Root felt compelled to express the character's emotions using comparatively little dialogue. Persuasion was shot in chronological order, allowing the actress to portray Anne's development from being downtrodden to happy and blossoming.|$|E

5|$|The {{production}} team also had significant {{problems with the}} scenes in the parking garage, and how to avoid the anatopism of contemporary cars being found on Caprica.

5|$|Tom Burstyn {{handled the}} cinematography, and the {{production}} designers were Michael Joy and Collin Niemi. James L. Conway contributed to the show as a consulting producer, and Joel McNeely composed the musical score. Although the show is set in Boston, filming took place in Montreal, Canada. The episodes were shot in a functioning asylum constructed in Montreal during the 19th century, with real patients walking around during certain scenes, which Frost said added a sense <b>of</b> <b>realism</b> to the series.|$|E
5|$|Although Kwee was {{a staunch}} {{supporter}} <b>of</b> <b>realism</b> in literature, Drama dari Krakatau includes {{a degree of}} mysticism, {{as evidenced by the}} apparent connection between the statue in the cave and the eruption of Krakatoa. Indeed, in many of his writings (both fiction and non-fiction), Kwee exhibited an interest in the occult; this includes writing detailed depictions of Therese Neumann, a fasting girl from Germany; and Omar Khayyám, a Persian Sufi mystic, philosopher and poet. The Indonesian literary critic Jakob Sumardjo finds the mystical elements (and the fact that no Hindu-era statues with inscriptions have been found) detract from the overall value of the novel.|$|E

40|$|David Ingersoll’s essay “Karl Llewellyn, American Legal Realism and Contemporary Legal Behavioralism” is a significant, but {{neglected}} {{contribution to}} our understanding <b>of</b> legal <b>realism</b> in the United States. This article argues that it first anticipates the shape <b>of</b> legal <b>realism’s</b> revival today and shows that Ingersoll was ahead of his time. The once dominant school <b>of</b> legal <b>realism</b> had become a much maligned theory of law when this essay was first published. Ingersoll identifies two varieties <b>of</b> legal <b>realism</b> and most critics focus on only one of them. He argues that legal realism should be revived if it develops its second variety often overlooked which accepts rule skepticism and recognizes {{the importance of social}} psychology to predicting legal outcomes more reliably...|$|R
5000|$|The philosophic basis <b>of</b> Aesthetic <b>Realism</b> was {{set forth}} {{systematically}} by Siegel in two major texts. The first, Self and World: An Explanation <b>of</b> Aesthetic <b>Realism,</b> [...] was written from 1941-3. Individual chapters, including [...] "Psychiatry, Economics, Aesthetics" [...] and [...] "The Aesthetic Method in Self-Conflict," [...] were printed in 1946. The full text {{was published in}} 1981 (NY: Definition Press). His second text, Definitions, and Comment: Being a Description of the World, completed in 1945, defines 134 terms used in the philosophic thought <b>of</b> Aesthetic <b>Realism,</b> including Existence, Change, Fixity, Freedom, Thought, Will, Wonder, Fear, Hope, Negation, Reality, and Relation. The work was published in 1978-9 as a series in the journal The Right <b>of</b> Aesthetic <b>Realism</b> to Be Known.|$|R
5|$|Holby City has {{attracted}} comparisons to other medical dramas, often unfavourable, and figures within {{the television and}} entertainment industry including Broadcasting Standards Commission director Paul Bolt have accused the BBC of squandering the television licence fee on the programme. The series employs {{a team of researchers}} to ensure medical accuracy, and utilises surgeons from different disciplines to check scripts. Cast members are taught to perform basic medical procedures, and given the opportunity to spend time on real hospital wards for research. Holby City has, however, been criticised for its lack <b>of</b> <b>realism,</b> with the British Medical Association denouncing its portrayal of organ donation and unrealistic impression of resuscitation, and an accident and emergency nurse at the 2008 Royal College of Nursing conference accusing the show of fostering unrealistic expectations of the NHS and fuelling compensation culture.|$|E
5|$|In-game {{characters}} {{were inspired by}} illustrations from adventure and pirate stories such as Captain Blood (1922), the work of Charles Dana Gibson, and mugshots from Edwardian London and Australia. An anatomy expert helped ensure the morphology of character faces represented Great Britain, while Arkane maintained a sense <b>of</b> <b>realism</b> and political incorrectness. Mitton established defining groups for characters such as rich, poor, and hostile with specific anatomy and posture designs, and animators created stylized movements for each social class and specific characters to help convey emotions. The city guards, for example, have small heads, low shoulders, and big hands, with animations that blend human and monkey movements. Antonov and Mitton employed a textile carpet designer in Russia to design and paint some of the in-game art.|$|E
5|$|Koster sees effects <b>of</b> <b>realism,</b> {{especially}} the idealistic realism {{held at the}} time in the Netherlands, in the work. He notes that motives and causality are given more weight in the narrative than in most contemporary works. He observes that this is also reflected in the characters, who– although royalty and holy men– were given the traits of persons one could find in real-life Batavia (now Jakarta). The use of punctuation, another trait uncommon in the local literature of the time, may also have served to give a more realistic reading and reflected the work's origin as a written manuscript and not from oral literature. Tio Ie Soei described the work's rhythm as more akin to speech than song.|$|E
40|$|The {{article is}} focused on {{aesthetic}} principles <b>of</b> the critical <b>realism</b> <b>of</b> the early XX century, which found their expression {{in the manner of}} leading artistic method in Kazakh poetry and in political-social lyric poetry.

Due to this fact, the authors conclude that the origin <b>of</b> the <b>realism</b> in Kazakh literature originate from the novels by S. Kubeev "Kalym", M. Kashimov "Bednaya Mariyam", S. Toraygyrov "Krasavitsa Kamar", "Kto vinovat?" and "Neshchastnaya Zhamal" by M. Dulatov...|$|R
40|$|Magical Realism, firstly {{used as a}} term in {{philosophy}} {{by one of the}} German romantics Novalis, later began to be seen as an approach in visual arts and literature. Currently {{there are only a few}} reference books in Turkish about what Magical Realism is and how it is reflected on literary works. As it is remarked in these books, the utilization of folklore and supernatural motifs are very obvious in the definitions <b>of</b> Magical <b>Realism</b> and in the works where its characteristics <b>of</b> magic <b>realism</b> are seen. For having a deeper understanding about the meaning <b>of</b> Magical <b>Realism,</b> the borders between Magical Realism, Realism, Fantastic and Surrealism should be defined. So that analyzing legends, fairy tales and myth, which are the products of oral tradition, becomes crucial for reaching to the roots <b>of</b> Magical <b>Realism.</b> However, when it is focused on the generally accepted features of these three folklore genres that are connected to each other in many ways, legend comes forward from others by claiming the reality of "supernatural". For example, although a 15 th century legendary text Dede Korkut Oǧuznameleri cannot be completely regarded as a work <b>of</b> magic <b>realism,</b> it contains some elements of this movement. Thus, it may be considered as an inspiring source for the works <b>of</b> Magical <b>Realism...</b>|$|R

5|$|Several {{critics have}} made exactly the {{opposite}} interpretation, reading the poem as a comic critique of the Christianity of the time, particularly as embodied in the Christian chivalry of Arthur's court.

The Arthurian enterprise is doomed unless it can acknowledge the unattainability of {{the ideals of the}} Round Table, and, for the sake <b>of</b> <b>realism</b> and wholeness, recognize and incorporate the pagan values represented by the Green Knight.|$|E
5|$|The Sundanese author M.A.Salmoen classifies Joehana as a realist. Rosidi {{writes that}} a sense <b>of</b> <b>realism</b> was {{promoted}} in Joehana's writings {{through the use}} of references to existing (and often popular) brands of products, including cigars, salted fish, and biscuits (though, as Joehana wrote for persons in contemporary Bandung who were expected to know these products, they are not given any in-text explanation). Joehana used real-life Bandung locations in his novels, and local figures prominent in the news (such as the pickpocket Salim) are mentioned in passing. There is also the possibility that the use of such names are a form of product placement, in which Joehana was paid to include the names of the products in his novels; this payment may not have been direct, but in the form of goods or services, or a donation to Sarekat Rakyat.|$|E
5|$|The game's plot {{concerns}} a diminutive prince {{on a mission}} to rebuild the stars, constellations, and Moon, which were accidentally destroyed by his father, the King of All Cosmos. This is achieved by rolling a magical, highly adhesive ball called a katamari around various locations, collecting increasingly larger objects, ranging from thumbtacks to people to mountains until the ball has grown great enough to become a star. Katamari Damacys story, characters, and settings are bizarre and heavily stylized, rarely attempting any semblance <b>of</b> <b>realism,</b> though the brands and items used are based on those current in Japan during the game's production.|$|E
