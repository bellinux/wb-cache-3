40|$|Iowa has {{a strong}} {{tradition}} of crop production, especially corn. Achieving optimum corn yields requires nitrogen (N) fertilization in most crop rotations. Unlike buying diesel for tractors, fertilizer energy is not directly purchased; but the energy consumed during the production of <b>N</b> <b>fertilizer</b> is considerable. In particular, the amount of natural gas used to produce <b>N</b> <b>fertilizer</b> means that pricing {{is affected by the}} supply and price of natural gas. At recommended rates, <b>N</b> <b>fertilizer</b> application is the largest energy input for corn production. This publication will address the utilization of <b>N</b> (and <b>other)</b> <b>fertilizers</b> to maximize returns on energy consumed in N manufacturing, transportation, and application for corn production. Energy use in nitrogen fertilizer manufacture Nitrogen fertilizers are predominantly produced using the Haber-Bosch process. Nitrogen gas (N 2) is combined with hydrogen (H 2) to form ammonia (NH 3). Nitrogen gas comes from the air and hydrogen typically from natural gas. Production of <b>N</b> <b>fertilizers</b> is very energy intensive and natural gas is the main energy source. Combining the N and H to form NH 3 requires considerable natural gas, both as the hydrogen feedstock and as energy for heat required during the process. <b>Other</b> <b>fertilizers</b> containing <b>N</b> are predominantly made from ammonia, including: • Urea – CO(NH 2) 2 • Urea-ammonium nitrate solutions • Ammonium nitrate – NH 4 NO 3 • Ammoniated phosphates – MAP (NH 4 H 2 PO 4); DAP [(NH 4) 2 HPO 4] Due to the consumption of natural gas as an energy source and as feedstock in ammonia production, the price of <b>N</b> <b>fertilizer</b> is typically related to supply and price of natural gas. A modern ammonia production plant requires net energy consumption of approximately 29. 7 million BTUs per ton of N (Kongshaug and Jenssen). Upgrading ammonia to <b>other</b> <b>N</b> <b>fertilizers</b> requires even more energy: 35. 9 million and 31. 4 million BTUs per ton for urea and urea/ammonium nitrate manufacture, respectively.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Assessing the {{environmental}} impacts of <b>fertilizer</b> nitrogen (<b>N)</b> used to increase productivity in managed forests is complex due {{to a wide range of}} abiotic and biotic factors affecting its forms and movement. Models developed to predict <b>fertilizer</b> <b>N</b> fate (<b>e.</b> g., cycling processes) and water quality impacts vary widely in their design, scope, and potential application. We review the applicability of five commonly used eco-hydrologic models (APEX, MIKESHE-DNDC, DRAIN-MOD-FOREST, REMM, and SWAT) in assessing N fate and transport in southern forest landscapes ( 50 km 2), although N routing below the subbasin level does not yet exist. Similarly, the distributed MIKESHE-DNDC model has been used to assess N cycles across different spatial scales, on both uplands and lowlands, but was not intended to model lateral N transport. However, MIKESHE alone is capable of describing the hydrology and N transport. The strengths of each of the models reflect their original design and scope intent. Based on this review, none of the five models that we considered is independently adequate to address the fate of <b>N</b> <b>fertilizers</b> applied to forest stands at both small and large scales, including uplands and lowlands.

Serpentinite {{was introduced in the}} autumn of 2008 on all plots while <b>other</b> <b>fertilizers</b> (<b>N,</b> P, NP and NPK) in the spring of 2009. Based on the chemical composition of soil solutions collected in lysimeters placed at the depth of 20 cm in the autumn 2008 and the spring and autumn 2009, ecochemical parameters were calculated: acid neutralization capacity (ANCaq), alkalinity (ALK), the degree of soil acidity (Ma%), acidic cations (Ma), saturation of the exchangeable complex of the soil solid phase (Mb) with alkalis, saturation with alkalis (BS), molar relations Ca/Al, Mb/Al, BC/Al. After the winter, soil solutions became acidic, especially in the Wisła Forest District. The saturation of the studied soils demonstrates moderate flexibility of soils in the Wisła Forest District in relation to acid load, and high flexibility of the Ujsoły soils. The opposite trend was observed for the degree of acidity of soils. Acid neutralization capacity and alkalinity of the waters showed significant variations in soil pH even in the case of small variations in the composition of the solution, if they were caused by the inflow of the anions of NO 3 - and SO 42 -. After application of the fertilizers, an increase of Mg, Ca and Mb was noted in the soil solution, determined in the overlaying highly acidic organic horizons trough the ion-exchange buffering mechanism of highly protonated functional groups with high buffering capacity. Highly improved content of Mg in a soil, and in some cases – also the content of N, P and K, present potential improvement of forest growth capacity without the hazard of adverse side-effects of liming. Aluminum stress in the spruce is unlikely, while trees in the control plots in the Wisła Forest District may already be sensitive. Przemysław Szmi...|$|R
40|$|A total maximum daily load (TMDL) {{assessment}} in the Upper North Bosque River (UNBR) has mandated reductions of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP). The large concentrations of dairies in the UNBR watershed {{have been identified}} as a source of the SRP.

A new BMP utilizes turfgrass sod to export composted dairy manure nutrients out of the impaired watershed in a sustainable manner. Previous plot-scale experiments have showed that 46 to 77 % of applied phosphorus (P) and 36 to 47 % of applied nitrogen (N) were removed in a single sod harvest.

The objectives of this study were (1) to estimate the contribution of applied <b>N</b> <b>fertilizer</b> to <b>N</b> turnover in rice paddy soil with different N fertilization practices that were manipulated by the quantity of treated swine slurry and chemical <b>N</b> <b>fertilizer</b> (i. <b>e.,</b> HTSS+LAS, a high amount of TSS with a low amount of ammonium sulfate; LTSS+HAS, a low amount of TSS with a high amount of ammonium sulfate; AS, ammonium sulfate with phosphorus and potassium; C, the control) and (2) to compare the rice response to applied N derived from each N fertilization practice. Rice biomass yield, 15 N recovery in both rice grain and stems, soil total N (TN), soil inorganic N, and soil 15 N recovery were analyzed. Similar amounts of 15 N uptake by rice in the TSS+AS plots were obtained, indicating that the effects of the different quantities of TSS on chemical <b>fertilizer</b> <b>N</b> recovery in rice during the experimental period were not significant.

In order to select the optimum forms of nitrogen (<b>N)</b> <b>fertilizers</b> for the arsenic (As) hyperaccumulator, Pteris vittata L., to maximize As extraction, five forms of N were added individually to different treatments to study the effect of N forms on As uptake of the plants under soil culture in a greenhouse. Although shoot As concentration tended to decrease and As translocation from root to shoot was inhibited, overall As accumulation was greater due to higher biomass when <b>N</b> <b>fertilizer</b> was added. Arsenic accumulation in plants with N fertilization was 100 similar to 300 % more than in the plants without N fertilization. There were obvious differences in plant biomass and As accumulation among the <b>N</b> forms, i. <b>e.,</b> NH 4 HCO 3, (NH 4) (2) SO 4, Ca(NO 3) (2), KNO 3, urea.

40|$|China is the world’s largest {{consumer}} of synthetic nitrogen (N), where very {{low rates of}} <b>fertilizer</b> <b>N</b> recovery in crops have been reported, raising discussion around whether <b>fertilizer</b> <b>N</b> use can be significantly reduced without yield penalties. However, using recovery rates as indicator ignores a possible residual effect of fertilizer N—a factor often unknown at large scales.

The objectives {{of the present study}} were therefore to quantify the residual effect of <b>fertilizer</b> <b>N</b> in China and to obtain more realistic rates of the accumulative <b>fertilizer</b> <b>N</b> recovery efficiency in crop production systems of China. Long-term spatially-extensive data on crop production, <b>fertilizer</b> <b>N</b> and <b>other</b> N inputs to croplands in China were used to analyze the relationship between crop <b>N</b> uptake and <b>fertilizer</b> <b>N</b> input (or total N input), and to estimate the amount of residual <b>fertilizer</b> <b>N.</b> Measurement results of cropland soil N content in two time periods were obtained to compare the change in the soil N pool.

The current net nitrogen input (NNI), which {{is defined as the}} difference between total N input to land area (chemical <b>fertilizer</b> <b>N</b> application, import of N in food and feed, biological N 2 fixation and atmospheric N deposition) and total N output from land area (export of N in food and feed), was estimated to be 52. 4 Mt N y- 1 in East Asia, in which chemical <b>fertilizer</b> <b>N</b> application accounts for 60 %. The results of simple regression analysis using reported data on stream NO 3 -N runoff and NNI estimated in US and Japanese watersheds showed that NNI was significantly correlated with stream NO 3 -N runoff. Using regression equation, stream NO 3 -N runoff from the total land area of East Asia was estimated to be 8. 61 Mt N y- 1, which accounted for 27 % of the total applied chemical <b>fertilizer</b> <b>N</b> in East Asia.

A two-year field study was conducted at the Safford Agricultural Center to investigate what these N efficiencies are under optimum yielding conditions. 'Aldura' durum wheat was grown on the same field site two years in succession. In 1987 {{a wide range of}} <b>fertilizer</b> <b>N</b> (0 to 419 lbs /A) applications resulted in residual NO₃⁻N accumulations of 36 to 140 lbs /A in the surface four feet of soil.

Grain yield response curves for the –N and +N subplots were used to estimate the marginal rate of substitution (MRS) of soil NO₃⁻N for <b>fertilizer</b> <b>N.</b> The marginal efficiency of residual NO₃⁻N was a constant 16. 7 lbs. grain produced /lb. of N across the range of profile N values in this study, while the marginal efficiency of <b>fertilizer</b> <b>N</b> varied from over 17 to below 6 lbs. grain /lb.

The ability of additions of labile organic matter (green and animal manure) to improve productivity primarily by enhanced nutrient availability was contrasted with the ability of stable organic matter (biochar and sawdust) to improve productivity by enhancing SOC. Maize productivity declined by 66 % during the first 35 years of continuous cropping after forest clearing. Productivity remained at a low level of 3. 0 t grain ha- 1 across the chronosequence stretching up to 105 years of continuous cultivation despite full N–phosphorus (P) –potassium (K) fertilization (120 – 100 – 100 kg ha− 1). Application of organic resources reversed the productivity decline by increasing yields by 57 – 167 %, whereby responses to nutrient-rich green manure were 110 % greater than those from nutrient-poor sawdust. Productivity at the most degraded sites (80 – 105 years since forest clearing) increased in response to green manure {{to a greater extent than}} the yields at the least degraded sites (5 years since forest clearing), both with full N–P–K fertilization. Biochar additions at the most degraded sites doubled maize yield (equaling responses to green manure additions in some instances) that were not fully explained by nutrient availability, suggesting improvement of factors other than plant nutrition. There was no detectable influence of texture (soils with either 11 – 14 or 45 – 49 % clay) when low quality organic matter was applied (sawdust, biochar), whereas productivity was 8, 15, and 39 % greater (P < 0. 05) on sandier than heavier textured soils with high quality organic matter (green and animal manure) or only inorganic nutrient additions, respectively. Across the entire degradation range, organic matter additions decreased the need for additional inorganic <b>fertilizer</b> <b>N</b> irrespective of the quality of the organic matter. For low quality organic resources (biochar and sawdust), crop yields were increasingly responsive to inorganic N fertilization with increasing soil degradation. On the <b>other</b> hand, <b>fertilizer</b> <b>N</b> additions did not improve soil productivity when high quality organic inputs were applied.

The above-ground plant components responded positively to the application of both <b>fertilizer</b> <b>N</b> and SS. The positive effect increased with the rate of application. In absence of SS, grain yield increased from 4. 8 g pot 1 in the control to 10. 6 g pot 1 at the highest level of <b>fertilizer</b> <b>N.</b> Likewise, the increase in grain yield due to different treatments ranged between 97 and 233 % as compared to 23. 3 and 82. 5 % recorded for straw component. The trends in N content of different plant components were fairly similar to those observed for dry matter yield and a significant correlation was observed between two parameters. Combination of both treatments at highest rate resulted in 127 % increase in the total N yield of the plants.

We report results from three experiments in southern Queensland sown on contrasting soil types and with contrasting rotation histories in the 2012 - 2013 summer season. Experiments {{were designed to}} quantify the response of grain sorghum to rates of <b>N</b> <b>fertilizer</b> applied as urea. Labelled 15 <b>N</b> <b>fertilizer</b> was applied in microplots to determine the fate of applied N, while nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions were continuously monitored at Kingaroy (grass or legume ley histories) and Kingsthorpe (continuous grain cropping). Nitrous oxide is a useful indicator of gaseous N losses. Crops at all sites responded strongly to <b>fertilizer</b> <b>N</b> applications, with yields of unfertilized treatments ranging from 17 % to 52 % of N-unlimited potential. Maximum yields ranged from 4500 (Kupunn) to 5450 (Kingaroy) and 8010 (Kingsthorpe) kg/ha. Agronomic efficiency (kg additional grain produced/kg <b>fertilizer</b> <b>N</b> applied) at the optimum N rate on the Vertosol sites was 23 (80 N, Kupunn) to 25 (160 N, Kingsthorpe), but 40 - 42 on the Ferrosols at Kingaroy (70 - 100 N). Cumulative N 2 O emissions ranged from 0. 44 % (Kingaroy legume) to 0. 93 % (Kingsthorpe) and 1. 15 % (Kingaroy grass) of the optimum <b>fertilizer</b> <b>N</b> rate at each site, with greatest emissions from the Vertosol at Kingsthorpe.

40|$|Bypass flow, the {{vertical}} flow of free water {{along the walls}} of macropores or preferential flow paths in the soil, can lead to movement of fertilizer nutrients {{beyond the reach of}} plants. Fertilizer type and the rate of application, as well as the amount, frequency, and intensity of rainfall, can influence the amount of <b>fertilizer</b> nitrogen (<b>N)</b> loss in leaching or bypass flow. The effect of <b>fertilizer</b> <b>N</b> form and rate of application on N recovery in bypass flow in a Kenyan Vertisol was determined. Calcium nitrate and ammonium sulfate, used to supply nitrate (NO 3 -) -N and ammonium (NH 4 +) -N, respectively, were surface-broadcast to 40 -cm-long undisturbed soil columns at equivalent rates of 50, 100, and 200 kg N ha(- 1). Using a rainfall simulator, two rainfall events (30 mm of water applied in 1 h) were applied to the soil columns, one before and the <b>other</b> after <b>fertilizer</b> application. Total <b>N,</b> NO 3 [...] N, and NH 4 +-N concentrations in the bypass flow were determined after the second rainfall event. The application of NH 4 +-N, regardless of the rate, had no effect on N recovery in the bypass flow. When nitrate N was applied, the amount of <b>fertilizer</b> <b>N</b> recovered in the bypass flow significantly increased with the rate of NO 3 [...] N application.

40|$|AbstractFertilizer {{nitrogen}} (N) recovery fractions may {{be calculated}} by the difference or the isotope-dilution method. With {{the first method}} an apparent recovery fraction (ARF) and with the latter method a 15 N recovery fraction (15 NRF) is calculated. The two methods may give different results, ARF generally being higher than 15 NRF, particularly in the higher range of ARF-values. <b>Fertilizer</b> <b>N</b> recovery fractions in crops calculated by the two methods were compared using experimental data derived from the literature. The experimental results could be largely explained {{on the basis of}} theoretical relationships between 15 NRF and ARF, based on the assumptions of (1) complete and instantaneous mixing of initial soil mineral <b>N</b> and <b>fertilizer</b> <b>N,</b> and (2) zero order kinetics for plant uptake, mineralization and immobilization reactions. In the lower range of ARF-values, values of 15 NRF exceeded those of ARF, presumably because the plant derives its <b>N</b> from <b>fertilizer</b> as well as soil N, even if there is no crop response to applied N. In the higher range of ARF-values, 15 NRF tended to be lower than ARF, presumably because of the occurrence of mineralization-immobilization turnover, which causes the 15 N content of the mineral N pool to decrease. This phenomenon, referred to as ‘pool substitution’, may be enhanced by increased uptake efficiency of soil N by fertilized crops or by increased mineralization in fertilized treatments. From an agronomic point of view, the use of ARF would be preferred, as this quantity accurately reflects the overall effect of fertilizer application on crop N uptake. 15 NRF is a meaningful quantity in rebalance studies. It accurately estimates the <b>fertilizer</b> <b>N</b> recovery in the crop, provided 4 N released in mineralization-immobilization turnover in soil is not considered <b>fertilizer</b> <b>N.</b> The theory developed in the present series of papers may contribute {{to the understanding of the}} dynamics and transformations of <b>fertilizer</b> <b>N</b> in soil-crop systems and thus help to develop criteria for efficient and effective <b>fertilizer</b> <b>N</b> management...|$|R

40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. thesis. September 2016. Major: Applied Plant Sciences. Advisor: Jeffrey Coulter. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xii, 67 pages. Yield of first-year corn (Zea mays L.) following alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) on fine-textured soils responds to <b>fertilizer</b> nitrogen (<b>N)</b> about {{one-half of the}} time, but current methods of predicting N-responsive sites and the economic optimum N rate (EONR) for N-responsive sites are not reliable. This {{study was conducted to}} quantify the responses of grain and silage yields and <b>N</b> uptake to <b>fertilizer</b> <b>N</b> rate in first-year corn following alfalfa on fine-textured soil and determine whether these are influenced by the time of N application. In 2014, 14 on-farm experiments were conducted in Minnesota with five N rates applied near planting or as a sidedress at the five to six leaf-collar corn stage in first-year corn on fine-textured soils. In three of four experiments where grain yield was increased with <b>fertilizer</b> <b>N,</b> the EONR was not affected by N application time and ranged from 114 to 200 kg N ha- 1 at a 5. 6 price ratio (US$ kg- 1 N/US$ kg- 1 grain); the EONR at the one location affected by N application time was 91 kg N ha- 1 when N was applied near planting compared to 30 kg N ha- 1 applied as a sidedress. Maximum grain yield was greater when N was sidedressed compared to applied near planting at three locations and was not influenced by the time of N application at the fourth location. Silage yield was increased with <b>fertilizer</b> <b>N</b> at seven locations. The EONR at N-responsive locations was not affected by N application time and ranged from 101 to > 200 kg N ha- 1 at a 13. 9 price ratio (US$ kg- 1 N/US$ kg- 1 silage). Silage yield was greater at all N-responsive locations when <b>N</b> <b>fertilizer</b> was applied as a sidedress compared to near planting. Grain and silage N uptake by corn was increased with <b>fertilizer</b> <b>N</b> at 14 and 13 locations, respectively, and was greater with N applied as a sidedress compared to near planting. When N uptake was maximized, apparent grain and silage <b>fertilizer</b> <b>N</b> recovery efficiency was 11 to 53 % across N application times. Corn response to <b>fertilizer</b> <b>N</b> was related to weather conditions that limited N availability and crop uptake. These results indicate that sidedressing <b>N</b> <b>fertilizer</b> in first-year corn following alfalfa at the five to six leaf-collar corn stage can mitigate risk of yield loss when there is elevated risk of N loss due to excessive precipitation prior to sidedressing. Improved methods of predicting the response of grain yield to <b>fertilizer</b> <b>N</b> in first-year corn following alfalfa on fine-textured soils are needed to maximize the benefits of alfalfa in cropping systems and reduce N losses. Data from 21 site-years were used to (i) determine how the Illinois soil N test (ISNT) and pre-sidedress soil nitrate test (PSNT) soil concentrations change during alfalfa-corn rotations; (ii) evaluate the ability of the ISNT and PSNT to predict grain yield response to <b>fertilizer</b> <b>N</b> in first-year corn following alfalfa; and (iii) investigate relationships between the ISNT or PSNT and potentially mineralizable soil nitrate-N. Neither the ISNT nor the PSNT changed as a result of increasing alfalfa stand age in five trials, and the PSNT was greater in first-year corn following alfalfa compared to other crop phases in rotations in three of five trials. The PSNT more accurately predicted corn response or non-response to <b>fertilizer</b> <b>N</b> than the ISNT (62 and 52 % of site-years correctly classified, respectively). A multiple logistic regression equation was developed to predict first-year corn response to <b>fertilizer</b> <b>N.</b> Measures of fit and model accuracy were improved when the PSNT, but not the ISNT, was included as a predictor variable. Incubation of soil from first-year corn showed that the ISNT explained 30 % of the variation in mineralized soil nitrate-N {{at the end of the}} 17 -wk incubation period, compared to 13 % explained with the PSNT. There was a linear relationship between the PSNT and either aboveground corn N uptake (ANU) or total available N (TAN), and between the ISNT and potentially mineralizable soil nitrate-N (PSN). Estimates of ANU, TAN, and PSN were improved when additional predictor variables were included in models. Overall, the PSNT was less related to soil N mineralization, but more closely related to the response of grain yield to <b>fertilizer</b> <b>N</b> in first-year corn following alfalfa, than the ISNT. Future research should seek to increase knowledge about the size and mineralization rate of soil N pools in first-year corn following alfalfa, thereby increasing the ability to predict sites where corn yield will respond to <b>N</b> <b>fertilizer</b> and the EONR for these sites...|$|R
