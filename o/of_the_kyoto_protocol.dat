Efficient lighting CDM projects claim to alleviate poverty and reduce emissions, while also aiding buyers of Certified Emission Reductions credits (CERs) to meet their abatement targets. Yet, as energy savings calculations do not account for behavioural responses, which cause “rebound effects”, a limited analysis may lead us to be overoptimistic about these projects’ environmental accomplishments. This study estimates <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> expenditure <b>of</b> monetary savings (understood as “poverty alleviation”) on <b>the</b> reduction targets <b>of</b> two CDM projects. Results suggest that the projects may, in fact, reduce electricity consumption further than expected; however, in terms of CO 2 emissions, results vary. Whereas in one case the effect may not significantly affect the CO 2 target, in the other it may compromise around 8 % or 19 % of it, consequently leading to an overestimation of CERs.
