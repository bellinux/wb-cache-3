40|$|Nerve {{growth factor}} (NGF) is a {{neurotrophic}} and immunomodulatory factor contributing {{of the control}} of cutaneous morphogenesis, wound healing and inflammatory responses. Following the evidence that topical administration of NGF leads to healing of human corneal ulcers, we investigate the therapeutic action of NGF on immune and/or autoimmune cutaneous ulcers. We found that 1 - 10 micrograms of highly purified murine NGF dissolved in 50 microliters of physiological solution and topically applied to skin ulcer leads, after 4 - 12 weeks of daily treatment (depending on the size and depth of the lesion) to complete healing of the ulcer. Thus, NGF was able to promote complete repair in human skin and corneal ulcers which were poorly or non-responsive to conventional topical and systemic treatments. No side effects were observed and a follow up after 4 months {{showed no signs of}} relapse. These findings indicate that failure of cutaneous tissues to produce sufficient amounts of NGF might represent a prominent mechanism implicated in the clinical manifestation of <b>ocular</b> <b>ulcers...</b>|$|E

SJS is defined as having a widespread distribution throughout the whole body surface area with < 10 % extent of skin detachment and skin lesions. Some drugs, such as carbamazepine, {{have been reported to}} have a greater correlation to SJS. Although clozapine use has been mentioned as a risk factor for development of SJS, no report has clearly described the features of SJS as a reaction to clozapine use. Herein, we report the case of a patient presenting SJS after long-term clozapine treatment. Case report: Mr A was a 54 -year-old male with a diagnosis of chronic schizophrenia. He was hospitalized in a mental institute and received clozapine 200 mg/day for 2 years, without discomfort or drug side effects. He developed acute-onset mouth edema, multiple oral and <b>ocular</b> <b>ulcers,</b> oral and ocular mucosa swelling, and multiple erythematous skin rashes over his entire body and extremities with hypertension and high fever. SJS was diagnosed after referral to a general hospital. Results: The SJS subsided under supportive treatment. Conclusion: Accumulated lymphocytes and macrophages in the epidermis and elevated TNF-α might cause an immune reaction and apoptosis and result in the clinical presentation of SJS. Clozapine is believed to modulate the immunologic reaction, and therefore might induce SJS through immunomodulation. This case highlights the importance of considering the possibility of SJS resulting from the use of drugs for which there are no reports of such a severe complication.

40|$|Behçet’s Disease (BD) is a multisystem {{inflammatory}} disorder {{characterized by}} recurrent oral-genital <b>ulcers,</b> <b>ocular</b> inflammation and frequently involves the joints, skin, central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract. We reported {{a case of}} severe BD in 30 years old male patient with oral-genital ulcerations and ocular involvement. He had suffered from the disease since twelve years ago and ocular involvement has lead to blindness of the right eye. Eye drop treatment for eight years, was suspected to cause lichenoid lesion on the buccal mucosa.

40|$|Corneal {{damage of}} various origins initiates {{a series of}} {{processes}} which lead to repair but also tend to perpetuate the damage; healing thus depends on the prevalence of repair over progression processes. The plasminogen/plasmin system has an important impact on this process, particularly by degrading the extracellular matrix components with resulting interference of the repair processes. This paper presents the immunoblotting analysis of fibronectin, tissue and urokinase-type plasminogen activators and plasminogen/plasmin in the tear fluid of control subjects and patients affected by various <b>ocular</b> pathologies (corneal <b>ulcers,</b> thermal or chemical burns, herpetic keratitis). A significant modification was noted in the protein profiles of fibronectin, tissue and urokinase-type plasminogen activators and plasminogen/plasmin {{in the cases of}} corneal ulcers and thermal or chemical burns relative to the pattern observed in the control subjects, while in cases of herpetic keratitis, only plasminogen/plasmin showed slight variations.

40|$|Patients {{presenting}} with recurrent orogenital ulcers {{may have}} complex aphthosis, Behçet's disease, secondary complex aphthosis (e. g. Reiter's syndrome, Crohn's disease, cyclical neutropenia) or non-aphthous disease (including bullous disorders, erythema multiforme, erosive lichen planus). Behçet's syndrome is a multi-system vasculitis of unknown aetiology {{for which there}} is no diagnostic test. Diagnosis is based on agreed clinical criteria that require recurrent oral ulcers and two of the following: recurrent genital <b>ulcers,</b> <b>ocular</b> inflammation, defined skin lesions and pathergy. The condition can present with a variety of symptoms, hence a high index of suspicion is necessary. The most common presentation is with recurrent mouth ulcers, often with genital ulcers; however, it may take some years before diagnostic criteria are met. All patients with idiopathic orogenital ulcers should be kept under review, with periodic focused assessment to detect evolution into Behçet's disease. There is often a delay of several years between patients fulfilling diagnostic criteria and a diagnosis being made, which may contribute to the morbidity of this condition. Despite considerable research effort, the aetiology and pathogenesis of this condition remains enigmatic...|$|R
40|$|Background: Thelazia callipaeda (Spirurida, Thelaziidae), {{also known}} as “oriental eyeworm”, is a small {{nematode}} parasite that lives in the conjunctival sac of domestic and wild carnivores, rabbits and even humans, causing mild (e. g., conjunctivitis, epiphora, and ocular discharge) to severe (e. g., keratitis, and corneal <b>ulcers)</b> <b>ocular</b> disease. This study reports, for the first time, the occurrence of T. callipaeda infection in the Balkan regions (i. e., Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia), it provides genetic evidence {{on the origin of}} the infection in that area and discusses potential expansion pathways in the near future. Methods: This survey was conducted in two Western Balkan countries, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia. At necropsy, from January 2011 to April 2014, a total of 184 carcasses of red foxes were examined throughout the study area and worms were collected from the conjunctival sac. In the same period, worms were also collected during clinical examination from the conjunctival sac of four dogs and a cat from Bosnia and Herzegovina and two dogs from Croatia.

40|$|Introduction: Dry {{eye disease}} is a common {{disorder}} provoking changes in tear film and ocular surface. Untreated dry eye could cause <b>ocular</b> infections, corneal <b>ulcer</b> and blindness. Only a few drugs are authorized so far {{for the treatment of}} dry eye disease and the possibilities of evolution in this sector are immense. Consequently, a significant number of new potential solutions are under development or placed in the pharmaceutical pipeline, promising better results and lesser side effects. Areas covered: In this article, the corresponding literature and recent Phase III clinical trial data and the corresponding literature, for dry eye disease treatment are reviewed, revealing the new strategic movements in drug pipelines. Expert opinion: From the clinical trial results, the advancement in tear substitutes and secretagogues in addressing specific deficiencies of tear components even though not resolving the underlying conditions of the disease is evident. The vast majority of new compounds under development are anti-inflammatories, steroids, non-steroids and antibiotics; however, there are also some novel lubricating drops and mucin-tear secretagogues. A future aggressive therapy for dry eye, depending on the severity of the symptoms, would include combinations of soft steroids, anti-inflammatories, such as cyclosporine A, with the addition of the new polyvalent mucin and tear secretagogues...|$|R

The aim is to report the first cases of Acanthamoeba keratitis in Yazd in a retrospective study confirmed on histopathological and confocal microscopy. All of our patients used soft contact lenses and were women. The age range was between 20 - 29 years. One eye was`misdiagnosed as herpes simplex keratitis and two were misdiagnosed as bacterial keratitis. A delayed visit as well as a late diagnosis led to the advanced stage of eye disease. Improvement in visual acuity following medical therapy was seen in two patients and one patient needed urgent keratoplasty for corneal necrosis A prompt clinical and laboratory diagnosis along with treatment with propamidine- isentionate resulted in significant improvement of eye condition Failure to disinfect contact lenses and introduction of tap water rinsing of storage cases were associated with increased risk of Acanthamoeba infection.

40|$|Behçet’s Syndrome (BS) is {{a chronic}} {{recurrent}} multisystemic inflammatory disorder characterized by oral and genital <b>ulcers,</b> <b>ocular</b> inflammation. Behçet’s syndrome has a complex genetic etiology. However, epidemiological studies recommend that genetic factors {{have a significant}} influence to its pathogenesis, alike to other autoinflammatory disorders. Epidemiological statistics, clinical records and HLA typing were studied in Iranian Azari patients with Behçet’s syndrome. This investigation considered HLA associations with BS and HLA with certain clinical characteristics, age and sex in the (Tabriz) Iran which has an ethnically homogeneous population. HLA-A and HLA-B typing was performed in 290 BS patients, conforming to International Study Group criteria and in 300 blood donors, as controls. Patient records were retrospectively reviewed and patients reassessed clinically. HLA-B 5, HLA-B 35, HLA- 51, HLA-B 52 and HLA-CW 4 presented significantly high frequencies in all patients. No other HLA type was associated. There was a significant HLA link with male sex in BS patients and Mean age (34 ± 1. 1) was determined. We present the frequency and correlation between Iranian Azari patients with Behçet’s syndrome and particular HLA antigens. Ninety nine percent had mouth ulceration, 64 % genital ulceration, 72 % skin lesions and 52 % ocular involvement.

40|$|Behçet's {{syndrome}} (BS) is a systemic, chronic, relapsing vasculitis, typically {{characterized by}} recurrent orogenital <b>ulcers,</b> <b>ocular</b> inflammation and skin manifestations; articular, vascular, gastroenteric and neurological involvement may also occur. Besides the other clinical features of BS, it seems relatively frequent {{that patients with}} BS develop a neurobehavioural syndrome, characterized by euphoria, bipolar disorders and paranoid attitudes, loss of insight/disinhibition, and indifference to their disease, defined as 'neuro-psycho-BS'. To date, the pathogenetic mechanism underlying neuro-psycho-BS has not been determined. It may be secondary to organic neurological involvement, {{or it may be}} related to poor quality of life and the relapsing course of the disease. Another engaging theory suggests that it could be related to the frequent observation of psychiatric symptoms during relapses or, in some cases, in the phases preceding reactivation of the disease; these elements suggest that psychiatric disorders in BS could represent a crucial element, whether a psychiatric subset or a distinct clinical feature of the disease. Moreover, {{it has been reported that}} cognitive impairment in BS can be seen with or without central nervous system involvement. Globally, psychiatric symptoms have been described as being multifaceted, ranging from anxiety disorders to depressive-bipolar disorders or to psychotic ones. In addition, some psychological characteristics of BS patients seem to predispose them to maladaptive stress management, which may lead to stress-related disorders, including anxiety and depression. Therefore, the aims of this review are to explore the epidemiology of neuro-psycho-BS by evaluating the relationship between the stress system and the multifaceted psychiatric manifestations in BS, and to summarize the therapeutic strategy used...|$|R
40|$|AIM—To {{describe}} leprosy characteristics, ocular features, {{and type}} of organisms that produce infective corneal ulcers in leprosy patients.  METHOD—The records of all leprosy patients admitted for treatment of corneal ulcers between 1992  and 1997  were reviewed.  RESULTS— 63 leprosy patients, 53  males and 10  females, are described. 16  were tuberculoid and 47  lepromatous. 25  patients had completed multidrug therapy. 10  patients had face patches, eight had type I reaction, and 10  had type II reaction. 43  (68 %) patients had hand deformities. In 54 % of patients pain was absent as a presenting symptom. 19  patients gave a history of trauma. In 15  patients ulcers had also occurred on the other eye, five of them having occurred {{during the study period}} and the rest before 1992.  Of the 68  eyes with corneal ulcers, 28  had madarosis, 34  had lagophthalmos, nine had ectropion, three had trichiasis, six had blocked nasolacrimal ducts, and 39  decreased corneal sensation. In 14  eyes, a previous lagophthalmos surgery had been done. 16  patients were blind at presentation. 32 % of ulcers were located centrally. After treatment only 18 % of the eyes showed visual improvement. Five types of fungus were cultured, two of them rare <b>ocular</b> pathogens.  CONCLUSIONS—Corneal <b>ulcers</b> occur more in males and in the lepromatous group of patients. Decreased corneal sensation, lagophthalmos and hand deformity are closely associated. Indigenous treatment and late presentations were notable in many patients. Visual outcome is not good. There is increased risk of developing an ulcer in the other eye. Fungal corneal ulcers are not uncommon.    Keywords: infectious keratitis; corneal ulcers; lepros...|$|R
40|$|Behçet’s disease (BD) {{is a rare}} {{systemic}} vasculitis characterized by oral aphthous <b>ulcers,</b> genital <b>ulcers,</b> <b>ocular</b> lesions and other systemic manifestations. BD occurs most frequently in Eurasian populations along the ancient trading route known as the “Silk Road” which extends from eastern Asia to the Mediterranean basin. The causes of BD are unknown: it {{is believed to be}} due to an autoimmune process triggered by an infectious or environmental agent in a genetically predisposed individual. HLA-B 51 allele located in the MHC locus, on chromosome 6 p has been the most strongly associated risk factor for BD in areas along the Old Silk Route. Herpes simplex virus- 1 and Streptococcus have been postulated as possible environmental triggers of BD. T cell homeostasis perturbation, especially Th 1 and Th 17 expansions and decrease regulation by Tregs are now supposed to be the cornerstone of BD pathogenesis. The histology shows vasculitis that involves both arteries and veins, and vessels of any size. BD is a {{systemic vasculitis}} with significant neutrophil infiltration, endothelial cell swelling, and fibrinoid necrosis. The diagnosis of BD is only supported by clinical criteria and require the exclusion of other diagnoses based on clinical presentation. There are no pathognomonic laboratorial findings of BD. This rare disease often leads to blindness and fatal systemic involvement. Main causes of death include major vessel disease and central nervous system involvement (Neuro-Behcet).

40|$|AIMS—To {{determine}} the quantitative {{relation between the}} major risk factors for microbial keratitis of previous ocular surface disease and contact lens wear and central and peripheral infiltration, often associated with ulceration, {{in order to establish}} a rational chemotherapeutic management algorithm.  METHODS—Data from 55  patients were collected over a 10  month period. All cases of presumed microbial keratitis where corneal scrapes had been subjected to microbiological examination were included. Risk factor data and laboratory outcome were recorded. Antimicrobial regimens used to treat each patient were documented.  RESULTS— 57 episodes of presumed microbial keratitis were identified from 55  patients, 24  male and 31  female. There were 30  central infiltrates and 27  peripheral infiltrates of which 28  were culture positive (73 % of central infiltrates, 22 % of peripheral infiltrates). 26  patients had worn contact lenses of whom 12  had culture positive scrapes (9 / 14 for central infiltrates, 3 / 12 for peripheral infiltrates). 31  patients had an ocular surface disease of whom five previous herpes simplex virus keratitis patients developed secondary bacterial infection. Anterior chamber activity and an infiltrate size ⩾  4  mm 2 were more common with culture positive central infiltrates than peripheral infiltrates (χ 2 test =  11. 98, p< 0. 001).  CONCLUSIONS—Predisposing factors for "presumed" microbial keratitis, either central or peripheral, were: ocular surface disease (26 / 57  =  45. 6 %), contact lens wear (26 / 57  =  45. 6 %), and previous trauma (5 / 57  =  8. 8 %). Larger ulceration (⩾ 4 mm 2) with inflammation was more often associated with positive culture results for central infiltration. None of these four variables (contact lens wear, <b>ocular</b> surface disease, <b>ulcer</b> size, anterior chamber activity) were of intrinsic value in predicting if a peripheral infiltrate would yield identifiable micro-organisms. Successful management of presumed microbial keratitis is aided by a logical approach to therapy, {{with the use of a}} defined algorithm of first and second line broad spectrum antimicrobials, for application at each stage of the investigative and treatment process considering central and peripheral infiltration separately.    Keywords: ulcerative keratitis; antimicrobials; ulcer...|$|R
40|$|The {{problems}} of Behçet's disease in Japan have been reviewed with {{particular emphasis on}} the ophthalmologic aspects: the historical background for the Japanese works, diagnostic critieria, epidemiology, some statistics, ocular symptomatology, ocular histopathology, etiology, pathophysiology, and treatment. Behçet's disease is the most frequent entity in endogenous uveitis in Japan. Patients are found throughout the country, and the prevalence rate averages seven to eight per 100, 000 population: the rate is higher in the northern than in the southern districts. The diagnosis is {{made on the basis}} of a combination of clinical symptoms that are divided into the major and minor criteria symptoms. The major criteria comprise the <b>ocular</b> involvement, aphthous <b>ulcers</b> of the oral mucous membrane, genital ulcers, and skin lesions. These symptoms recur often as attacks and the disease follows a chronic course. The ocular involvement is found in 83 % to 95 % in males and 67 % to 73 % in females; the male to female ratio in the number of patients is 1. 78. Both into the anterior segment type and the fundus and panophthalmic types. The anterior segment type shows serous iridocyclitis with the classic type of hypopyon appearing in about 12 % of the attacks. This type is found in about 20 %, more often in females than in males, and the visual prognosis is more favorable than in the fundus and panophthalmic types. In the latter two types, attacks of retinal angitis resulting in intensive retinal edema, yellowish-white exudate, and hemorrhages recur particularly in the macular region, and the visual prognosis is poor. More than 50 % of male patients lose visual acuity to less than 0. 1 in five years, but this is the case in only 10 % of female patients. Consequently, Behçet's disease is the cause of blindness in about 12 % of acquired blindness in adults. The ocular histopathology during the attack is characterized by severe angitis with intensive infiltration of neutrophil leucocytes largely in the uveal tract and the retina; the latter is severely affected and loss of visual cells and other neural elements results. The etiology of this disease still remains unknown but genetic predisposition is suggested since this disease is strongly linked with HL-A-B 5. Environmental factors are also considered. Various abnormalities are found in the blood chemistry, blood cells (particularly in neutrophil leucocytes), immunologic mechanism, fibrinolytic and blood clotting system, and hormonal system. Chemotractic factors are found in the aqueous humor. These changes are particulary enhanced just before and during the ocular attacks. Systemic corticosteroids are deleterious to the visual prognosis, but cyclophosphamide and colchicine appear to suppress attacks and help patients maintain the visual acuity. However, these drugs are toxic, particulary to the reproductive organs, and the patients must be informed of this side effect and be allowed to make a decision before they are used...|$|R
