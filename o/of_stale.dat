5|$|Various {{types of}} pancake {{machines}} exist, {{such as those}} that run pancake batter through a heated conveyor inside of a box unit, and those that automatically drop pancake batter onto a flattop grill. Some pancake machines, such as one developed by Crepe-Coer, cook both sides of a pancake simultaneously. Semi-automatic pancake machines also exist, which require some human interaction to function, such as the pouring of batter. Commercial pancake machines may be used in the foodservice industry, in cafeterias and by restaurants, and can serve to reduce the waste <b>of</b> <b>stale</b> pancake batter. Some hotels have pancake machines that guests are allowed to operate. They are also used in other environments in a self-service manner, such as in upscale airport lounges and hotels.|$|E
25|$|After {{several years}} <b>of</b> <b>stale</b> combat in various regions of Transcaucasia, with neither parties making {{significant}} territorial gains, the Russians had gained {{the upper hand}} and by now had reached territories close to Persia's heartlands. On December 18, 1812 the marching military detachment of general Kotlyarevsky had crossed the Aras river and had passed the 80 miles straight without water and roads through the Mughan plains through salt flats and swamps. After crossing swamps and marshes, the soldiers were then transferred to a weather of terrible snow and blizzard. By that time, his army had undergone a heavy need for resupplies especially drinking water and food.|$|E
25|$|The Pennsylvania Gazette, {{like most}} other {{newspapers}} of the period, was often poorly printed. Franklin was busy with a hundred matters outside of his printing office, and never seriously attempted to raise the mechanical standards of his trade. Nor did he ever properly edit or collate the chance medley <b>of</b> <b>stale</b> items that passed for news in the Gazette. His influence on the practical side of journalism was minimal. On the other hand, his advertisements of books show his very great interest in popularizing secular literature. Undoubtedly his paper contributed to the broader culture that distinguished Pennsylvania from her neighbors before the Revolution. Like many publishers, Franklin built up a book shop in his printing office; he {{took the opportunity to}} read new books before selling them.|$|E

500|$|As filming {{finished}} on The Sea Beast, {{work began}} on Don Juan, the first feature-length film with synchronized Vitaphone sound effects and a musical soundtrack. Although Barrymore {{wanted to play}} opposite Costello again, Jack L. Warner, the film's producer, signed Astor. After completing his Warner Bros. contract with When a Man Loves, with Costello, Barrymore joined United Artists (UA) under a three-film deal. For the next three years, according to Morrison, he [...] "enjoyed unprecedented prosperity and spent lavishly". Nevertheless, he received some harsh reviews. Critic and essayist Stark Young wrote in The New Republic that Barrymore's films were [...] "rotten, vulgar, empty, in bad taste, dishonest, noisome with a silly and unwholesome exhibitionism, and odious with a kind <b>of</b> <b>stale</b> and degenerate studio adolescence. Their appeal is cheap, cynical and specious".|$|E

According to Exclaim!, Spit [...] "plays like an inconsistent collection <b>of</b> <b>stale</b> 1991-era Pantera and Sepultura B-sides, overdubbed {{with the occasional}} 1995 techno sprinkle for a somewhat modern measure". The album contains heavy riffs, rapping, screaming and clean singing. According to an AllMusic review by Roxanne Blanford, the album has a [...] "meatier, heavier sound than contemporaries Limp Bizkit and Korn". According to Michael Tedder of The Pitch, [...] "Spit echoes Helmet's precision, Slayer's power and (with some songs dealing with body image and self-esteem issues) even Nirvana's confessional songwriting". Author Tommy Udo compared Kittie's sound and attitude to heavy metal bands such as Pantera and Machine Head.|$|E

500|$|Hard Candy {{received}} generally favorable reviews. The album {{received a}} score of 65/100 on Metacritic, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews". Mark Savage from the BBC commented on {{the composition of the}} tracks, saying [...] "if a handful of the tracks had been delivered to more producers with a touch more subtlety, Hard Candy could have ranked alongside Madonna's best. [...] Over and over again, she subsumes her pop sensibilities to their arsenal of clattering beats, hollered raps and over-fussy production." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic felt that [...] "There's a palpable sense of disinterest , as if she just handed the reins over to Pharrell and Timba-Lake, trusting them to polish up this piece <b>of</b> <b>stale</b> candy. Maybe she's not into the music, maybe she's just running out this last album for Warner before she moves onto the greener pastures of Live Nation—either way, Hard Candy is as a rare thing: a lifeless Madonna album." ...|$|E

Mencken concurred, [...] "it reminds me of a string of wet sponges, it reminds me of tattered washing on the line; it reminds me <b>of</b> <b>stale</b> bean soup, of college yells, of dogs barking idiotically through endless nights. It is so bad that a kind of grandeur creeps into it. It drags itself out of the dark abysm... of pish, and crawls insanely up the topmost pinnacle of tosh. It is rumble and bumble. It is balder and dash." [...] The New York Times took a more positive view of Harding's speeches, stating that in them the majority of people could find [...] "a reflection of their own indeterminate thoughts".|$|E

Vanyaland writer Michael Marotta described the track as [...] "brooding and menacing", going on to describe Banks' delivery, [...] "Banks slices through her verses {{in a way that}} recalls the magic she first flashed on the still-lethal 2011 track '212'". In a positive review, Chris Thomas from HipHopWired complimented the track, writing [...] "The Harlem native waxes poetics with a dexterous flow. Her rhymes are laden with braggadocios lines about her boss status". In a mixed review, Kevipod from Direct Lyrics complimented the song's instrumental, but was critical of Banks' vocals, writing [...] "'Heavy Metal and Reflective' possesses a hard-hitting, menacing beat courtesy of Lil Internet and a lot <b>of</b> <b>stale</b> rapping by Azealia", while also commenting on the need for a more mainstream song from Banks' [...] "if she really wants to put her career together again". Robbie Daw from Idolator panned the track, describing the song as [...] "trap-lite trash", recommending that Banks spends more time [...] "actually focus on not making shit music".|$|E
500|$|Food {{was mostly}} served on plates or in stew pots, and diners would take their share from {{the dishes and}} place it on trenchers <b>of</b> <b>stale</b> bread, wood or pewter with the help of spoons or bare hands. In lower-class {{households}} it was common to eat food straight off the table. Knives were used at the table, but most people were expected to bring their own, and only highly favored guests would be given a personal knife. A knife was usually shared with at least one other dinner guest, unless one was of very high rank or well-acquainted with the host. Forks for eating were not in widespread usage in Europe until the early modern period, and early on were limited to Italy. Even there {{it was not until the}} 14th century that the fork became common among Italians of all social classes. The change in attitudes can be illustrated by the reactions to the table manners of the Byzantine princess Theodora Doukaina in the late 11th century. She was the wife of Domenico Selvo, the Doge of Venice, and caused considerable dismay among upstanding Venetians. The foreign consort's insistence on having her food cut up by her eunuch servants and then eating the pieces with a golden fork shocked and upset the diners so much that there was a claim that Peter Damian, Cardinal Bishop of Ostia, later interpreted her refined foreign manners as pride and referred to her as [...] "...the Venetian Doge's wife, whose body, after her excessive delicacy, entirely rotted away." [...] However this is ambiguous since Peter Damian died in 1072 or 1073, and their marriage (Theodora and Domenico) took place in 1075.|$|E

500|$|How the García Girls Lost Their Accents {{confirms}} the suspicion widely expressed in circles of Latin American literature that North Americans {{choose not to}} differentiate between political and economic exile. Alvarez pointedly demonstrates the North American tendency to undervalue cultural diversity by highlighting instances of American ignorance toward distinctions between different Hispanic-Caribbean groups. The García girls are quite conflicted upon their arrival in the United States as they find that distinct cultural groups are lumped together under one broad [...] "immigrant" [...] category and newcomers are encouraged to assimilate silently to the American norm. Yolanda’s conflict with her father regarding the potentially controversial speech she has prepared for the Teacher’s Day Address provides {{a classic example of}} {{the manner in which the}} García girls are pressured to conform to the norm. Yolanda feels as though she has sacrificed her principles and sold out to the hyper-sensitive authorities when her father forces her to discard her empowering, rebellious achievement of artistic self-expression for [...] "two brief pages <b>of</b> <b>stale</b> compliments and the polite commonplaces on teachers. A speech wrought by necessity and without much invention". Julie Barak affirms that [...] "although this incident is in many ways a defeat for both Yolanda and her mother, it does teach them the lesson of conformity that is so important to living peacefully in America. Yolanda learns to fit in, to do the expected". The girls go on to attend the best schools, lose their Spanish accents and acquire the same psychological disorders as their upper-class American counterparts. Sandra battles anorexia, Carla and Yolanda both have failed marriages, Yolanda and Sandra are both institutionalized for psychiatric issues at one time or another, and Sofía is impregnated out of wedlock.|$|E
