5|$|The {{favorite}} for qualification {{in both the}} 100m and 200m at the US Olympic Trials, Gay put in a strong performance in the heats. After a misjudgement {{in the first round}} almost caused him to miss out on qualification, Gay resolved to step up his pace, and he won the 100m quarter-final with a US record-setting run of 9.77s. Breaking Maurice Greene's nine-year-old record, this made Gay the third fastest 100m sprinter ever, after rivals Bolt and Powell. In the final the following day, Gay finished first in a wind-aided 9.68s (+4.1m/s). This was the fastest ever 100m time under any conditions, bettering the 9.69s record which Obadele Thompson had set 12 years earlier. The 200m event was a significant setback for Gay as he suffered a hamstring injury in the qualifiers and was subsequently ruled out of the event for the Olympics. The injury persisted for several weeks and he dropped <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>track</b> meetings in order to recover in time for the Olympics.|$|E
5|$|Stewart led {{the field}} {{back up to}} speed at the lap-178 restart, ahead of Nemechek and Sadler. Stewart and Nemechek {{pulled away from the}} rest of the field, but Nemechek lost the draft on the next lap and fell behind Sadler. The field formed into a single file, and {{remained}} this way until a tenth and final caution of the race was deployed because McMurray had his right-rear tire go down on lap 185. The race restarted on lap 188, for a green-white-checker finish (extending the race to 190 laps) with Stewart leading Smith. The field again formed a single line, with most drivers remaining in that formation for the rest of the race. On the final lap, Smith passed Stewart on the frontstretch below the yellow line, and crossed the start-finish line ahead of Stewart. NASCAR determined that Smith was <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>track</b> bounds, handing Stewart the victory with Smith provisionally in second. The race had a total of ten cautions and 64 lead changes by 28 drivers. Stewart led four different times for a total of 24 laps, more than any other competitor.|$|E

50|$|Almost simultaneously, {{the club}} ran into another, harder misfortune. Belgrade {{assembly}} for the necessities of the railway took away from BASK the playfield in Topčider, so, for some time, the club had no field of their own. Later, BASK got the playfield behind Belgrade electrical plant, which {{was attributed to}} Radnički after the Second World War. The resolute management and great team nothing could put <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>track.</b> BASK had even struggled for permanent place in competition for the Yugoslav championship, which was played in the begin of 1930s using a cup system. In the season 1932-33, BASK {{was a member of}} the Yugoslav First League, which had double score system. In competition of 11 teams, BASK took the 5th place behind the champion-BSK, second-standing Hajduk Split, FK Jugoslavija and HAŠK, but in front of notable clubs such as Građanski Zagreb, Concordia, Primorje Ljubljana, Slavija Sarajevo, Slavija Osijek and FK Vojvodina. In the next championship BASK archived 7th place, and in the season 1936-37, it was 6th once again. Next season, 1937-38, it accomplished the 4th place, and that was the highest achievement of the club, finishing behind the new champion HAŠK, BSK and Građanski.|$|E

50|$|In {{the first}} semifinals heat, Marcin Lewandowski fell over Bram Som who had tripped over Abubaker Kaki, {{who had fallen}} on his own account. After a protest, both Lewandowski and Som were allowed {{to compete in the}} final. With the extra athletes on the track the two time qualifiers, Alfred Kirwa Yego in lane 1 and Mbulaeni Mulaudzi in lane 8, had to share their lanes with Som in 1 and Lewandowski in 8. None of the people sharing lanes conceded space, Som leading Yego around the outside of the turn {{effectively}} boxing out Yego, Yusuf Saad Kamel and Yeimer López. With typically slow starters Nick Symmonds and Yuriy Borzakovskiy in the middle lanes, Som had a free run from the inside but Mulaudzi, Lewandowski and Amine Laâlou a strong wave from the outside to take the lead. Atypically, neither Symmonds nor Borzakovskiy were content to take the rear, both working their way through the crowd to join Mulaudzi {{at the front of the}} pack by the end of the first lap, exchanging arms and elbows in the process. Lewandowski was boxed in by the action on the outside and began to fall back through the pack while Symmonds took a strong position on Mulaudzi's shoulder, Laâlou right behind Mulaudzi with Som in their wake. Everyone held position on the backstretch save Borzakovskiy who noticeably fell back to behind Lewandowski on the back of the pack, which would be the normal place Borzakovskiy would launch his finishing kick, but not after losing so much ground. From the back group, through the final turn, Kamel went to the outside and started passing people, followed by Yego and then Borzakovskiy doing the same thing. Yego pulled out to lane 3 for running room, Borzakovskiy to lane 4, Kamel, Yego and Borzakovskiy, moving faster than the others ahead of them. Symmonds held second place until Kamel passed him, then the wind went out of his sails. Laâlou edged ahead but was getting passed by the rush. Mulaudzi was able to lean over the line in first, falling flat on his face just past the finish line. Yeo and Kamel crossed together with Yego getting the photofinish knod for silver. Borzakovskiy caught everyone else but ran <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>track</b> to get into the medals.|$|E
