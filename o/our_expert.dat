[...] "Pearls, I have learned, {{change their}} color, {{their degree of}} luster, even their weight, according to atmospheric conditions and location. A ten-penny-weight pearl in Vienna might weigh eight or nine pennyweights here in California, or {{it is more likely}} to weigh twelve. The things absorb certain moistures and chemicals from the air and sun, and shed those absorptions when kept in darkness or from the fresh air. Pearls die, so to speak; but are often restored to life by immersions in sea-water, their native element. As for color: the pink and blue pearls often grow white, at times, especially if kept long in darkness, but sun-baths restore their former tints. In the same way a white pearl, if placed near the fumes of ammonia, changes to a pinkish hue, while certain combinations of chemicals render them black, or 'smoked.' A clever man could steal a pink pearl, bleach it white, and sell it to its former owner without its being recognized. Therefore, when <b>our</b> <b>expert,</b> Le Drieux, attempts to show that the pearls found in Jones' possession are identical with those stolen from the Austrian lady, he fails to allow for climatic or other changes and cannot be accurate enough to convince anyone who knows the versatile characteristics of these gems." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Reinforcement {{learning}} is a popular machine learning technique whose inherent self-learning ability has made it the candidate of choice for game AI.

We also implement a Q-learning based Ludo player using the knowledge obtained from building the expert player. Our results show that while our TD(λ) and Q-Learning based Ludo players outperform the expert player, they do so only slightly suggesting that <b>our</b> <b>expert</b> player is a tough opponent. Further improvements to our RL players {{may lead to the}} eventual development of a near-optimal player for Ludo. I...|$|E

According to <b>our</b> <b>experts,</b> many predictions found in the prior literature will materialise (such as the Internet will become increasingly important in disseminating corporate information).
