5|$|In United States v. Gooding (1827), the Court {{construed}} {{the elements}} of the fitting out offense. First, the Court held that the offense of fitting out a vessel for slave trading could be committed even if the <b>owner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> did not personally fit it out. Second, the Court held that the statute could be violated by a partial fitting out (as opposed to a complete fitting out) of a vessel for that purpose. Third, the Court held thatsince slave trading was a misdemeanorthere was no distinction between principal and accessory. Fourth, the Court held that, for the statute to be violated, the fitting out must have occurred within the United States. Finally, the Court held that the statute's mens rea required that the owner intend to cause the vessel to be used for slave trading, as opposed to intending that the vessel be used for slave trading (by some third party).|$|E

2500|$|Beebe's initial design {{called for}} a {{cylindrical}} vessel, and articles describing his plans were published in The New York Times. [...] These articles {{caught the attention of}} the engineer Otis Barton, who had his own ambition to become a deep-sea explorer. [...] Barton was certain that a cylinder would not be strong enough to withstand the pressure of the depths to which Beebe was planning to descend, and sent Beebe several letters proposing an alternative design to him. [...] So many unqualified opportunists were attempting to join Beebe in his efforts that Beebe tended to ignore most of his mail, and Barton's first efforts to contact him were fruitless. [...] A mutual friend of Barton's and Beebe's eventually arranged a meeting between the two, enabling Barton to present his design to Beebe in person. [...] Beebe approved of Barton's design, {{and the two of them}} made a deal: Barton would pay for the vessel and all of the other equipment to go with it, while Beebe would pay for other expenses such as chartering a ship to raise and lower it, and as the <b>owner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> Barton would accompany Beebe on his dives in it.|$|E
2500|$|Construction of the Corwin was {{contracted}} in May 1875 with completion {{scheduled for}} February 28, 1876. Captain John W. White was construction superintendent for the Revenue Cutter Service. [...] The Corwin {{was the first}} government vessel constructed {{in the state of}} Oregon, and a large crowd came out to see her launched August 23, 1876. Oregon Iron Works became insolvent that fall and was declared bankrupt; this resulted in liens filed against the vessel by suppliers and subcontractors for unpaid bills. [...] On January 2, 1877, Judge J. Deady of the U.S District Court, Oregon District ruled that the lien of libellants Coffin and Hendry was valid, that the government was not yet the <b>owner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> and had not been in possession when the vessel was seized by the marshal on November 29. [...] However, the Corwin had been extricated about January 1, 1877 by Captain White and the USRC Rush and moved {{to the middle of the}} Columbia River (another source has this about January 10). [...] The Government appealed Judge Deady's ruling and Coffin and Hendry withdrew their claim on the basis of assurances that they would be paid faster if they settled. After a flurry of unsuccessful legal actions by other claimants, the Corwin was [...] removed to San Francisco where she was completed at a cost of $10150.77 and subsequently commissioned. Congress was still considering suppliers and workmen's claims in 1884.|$|E
2500|$|The {{destruction}} of the Lucy Walker is well documented, but nearly every source contains some contradictions, garbled names, or incomplete information. Eyewitnesses included Captain Dunham of the snagboat Gopher, an anonymous gentleman from Baltimore, the pilot Capt. Thompson, {{and a group of}} ministers and laymen aboard the Lucy Walker. [...] The latter told about their misadventures during and after the explosion, but somehow failed to notice or mention that the <b>owner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> was an American Indian, that drinking and gambling was present, or that the boat was engaged in a race with another boat. [...] Most of the newspaper accounts also failed to note this aspect of the accident. The owner of the ship was identified in most newspapers as Captain David Vann, possibly confusing him with a cousin of that name who had served as the Treasurer of the Cherokee Nation. This David Vann was a brother of Joseph ("Tenulte") Vann. [...] Various sources provide estimates of fatalities widely ranging from 18 to more than 100 deaths. [...] Albert Koch misheard the name of the vessel as [...] "Louise Walker." [...] Even the date of the accident has frequently been listed in error in many reference works, which have the date as October 22 or 25, 1844. Only the Cherokee sources note the role that [...] "Rich Joe" [...] Vann played in the sudden end of the Lucy Walker and his own demise.|$|E

These were Sheridan, the former tutor of the prince; Kelly, a non-juring clergyman, and Sullivan -- both, like Sheridan, Irishmen; Strickland, a personage so unimportant that while some writers call him an Englishman, others assert that he was Irish; Aeneas Macdonald, a Scotchman; Sir John Macdonald, an officer in the Spanish service; the prince's valet, Michel; and the Duke of Athole, or, as he is more generally called, the Marquis of Tullibardine, the last named being the only man of high standing or reputation.

But they had a tale ready that they were wheat-merchants in great haste to reach Bernico, that a cargo of wheat awaited them there, and that they would suffer great loss by delay. The tale was smooth enough to satisfy the alcalde, and they were allowed to depart. They reached Castro Urdiales safely, but were delayed there for two days, owing to the total lack of horses; and they were forced, in the end, to proceed upon mules obtained from a neighbouring convent. On these they rode to Durango, where they procured two fresh mules and a horse, and so, after further similar vicissitudes, they arrived at Pampeluna on December 3, 1506, and Cesare startled the Court of his brother-in-law, King Jean of Navarre, by suddenly appearing in it--"like the devil." ...|$|E

60|$|Margaret Barclay, wife of Archibald Dein, burgess of Irvine, {{had been}} slandered by her sister-in-law, Janet Lyal, the spouse of John Dein, brother of Archibald, and by John Dein himself, as guilty of some act of theft. Upon this {{provocation}} Margaret Barclay raised an action of slander before the church court, which prosecution, after some procedure, the kirk-session discharged by directing a reconciliation between the parties. Nevertheless, {{although the two}} women shook hands before the court, yet the said Margaret Barclay declared that she gave her hand only in obedience to the kirk-session, but that she still retained her hatred and ill-will against John Dein and his wife, Janet Lyal. About this time the bark of John Dein was about to sail for France, and Andrew Train, or Tran, provost of the burgh of Irvine, who was an <b>owner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vessel,</b> went with him to superintend the commercial part of the voyage. Two other merchants of some consequence went in the same vessel, with {{a sufficient number of}} mariners.

60|$|In {{the mean}} time, the king journeyed {{secretly}} {{on from the}} residence of one faithful adherent to another, encountering many perplexities, and escaping narrowly many dangers, until he came at last to the neighborhood of Shoreham, a town upon the coast of Sussex. Colonel Gunter had provided a vessel here. It was a small vessel, bound, with a load of coal, along the coast, to the westward, to a port called Pool, beyond the Isle of Wight. Colonel Gunter had arranged it with the master to deviate from his voyage, by crossing over to the coast of France, and leaving his passengers there. He was then to return, and proceed to his original destination. Both the <b>owner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> and the master who commanded it were Royalists, but {{they had not been}} told that it was the king whom they were going to convey. In the bargain which had been made with them, the passengers had been designated simply as two gentlemen of rank who had escaped from the battle of Worcester. When, however, the master of the vessel saw the king, he immediately recognized him, having seen him before in his campaigns under his father. This, however, seemed to make no difference in his readiness to convey the passengers away. He said that hews perfectly willing to risk his life to save that of his sovereign, and the arrangements for the embarkation proceeded.|$|E
6000|$|We {{have spoken}} of the {{coasters}} that ply between the emporium {{and all the}} creeks and bays of the Sound, {{as well as of}} the numberless rivers that find an outlet for their waters between Sandy Hook and Rockaway. Wharves were constructed, at favourable points, inside the prong, and occasionally a sloop was seen at them loading its truck, or discharging its ashes or street manure, the latter being a very common return cargo for a Long Island coaster. At one wharf, however, now lay a vessel of a different mould, and one which, though of no great size, was manifastly intended to go outside. This was a schooner that had been recently launched, and which had advanced no farther in its first equipment than to get in its two principal spars, the rigging of which hung suspended over the mast-heads, in readiness to be [...] "set up" [...] for the first time. The day being Sunday, work was suspended, and this so much the more, because the <b>owner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> was a certain Deacon Pratt, who dwelt in a house within half a mile of the wharf, and who was also the proprietor of three several parcels of land in that neighbourhood, each of which had its own buildings and conveniences, and was properly enough dignified with the name of a farm. To be sure, neither of these farms was very large, their acres united amounting to but little more than two hundred; but, owing to their condition, the native richness of the soil, and the mode of turning them to account, they had made Deacon Pratt a warm man, for Suffolk.|$|E
