50|$|Haydn wrote a {{considerable}} number <b>of</b> <b>operas</b> himself (see List <b>of</b> <b>operas</b> by Joseph Haydn), but only twice assigned Polzelli a role (Silvia in L'isola disabitata and Lisetta in La vera costanza).|$|R
50|$|In {{his later}} life Nikolaus played much less and became {{something}} of a couch potato, listening to ceaseless performances <b>of</b> <b>operas</b> produced by Haydn and his troupe both for the main theatre and for the marionette theatre at Esterhaza. Haydn wrote several <b>of</b> these <b>operas</b> himself (see List <b>of</b> <b>operas</b> by Joseph Haydn). These are likewise among his least remembered works.|$|R

5|$|Solti took up {{the musical}} {{directorship}} of Covent Garden in August 1961. The press gave him a cautious welcome, but there was some concern that under him {{there might be a}} drift away from the company's original policy <b>of</b> <b>opera</b> in English. Solti, however, was an advocate <b>of</b> <b>opera</b> in the vernacular, and he promoted the development of British and Commonwealth singers in the company, frequently casting them in his recordings and important productions in preference to overseas artists. He demonstrated his belief in vernacular opera with a triple bill in English of L'heure espagnole, Erwartung and Gianni Schicchi. As the decade went on, however, more and more productions had to be sung in the original language to accommodate international stars.|$|E

5|$|After the premiere, most reviews were critical, and the French {{public was}} {{generally}} indifferent. Carmen initially gained its reputation {{through a series}} of productions outside France, and was not revived in Paris until 1883; thereafter it rapidly acquired popularity at home and abroad. Later commentators have asserted that Carmen forms the bridge between the tradition <b>of</b> <b>opéra</b> comique and the realism or verismo that characterised late 19th-century Italian opera.|$|E

5|$|During this period, Boult {{accepted}} {{some international}} guest conductorships, appearing with the Vienna Philharmonic, Boston Symphony, and New York Philharmonic orchestras. In 1936 and 1937 he headed European tours with the BBC Symphony Orchestra, giving concerts in Brussels, Paris, Zurich, Budapest and Vienna, {{where they were}} especially well received. During his BBC years, Boult did not entirely lose contact with the world <b>of</b> <b>opera</b> and his performances of Die Walküre at Covent Garden in 1931 and Fidelio at Sadler's Wells Theatre in 1930 were considered outstanding.|$|E
5|$|Mention {{should also}} be made of Meyerbeer's intense concern with the {{business}} <b>of</b> <b>opera,</b> which indeed had formed part of his studies under Vogler. This gave him the background not only to deal with complex contractual issues and to negotiate with publishers, but extended to wooing the press and 'marketing' in general. Indeed, he was probably the originator of the 'press conference' at which journalists were fed refreshment and information. This marketing and commercialisation <b>of</b> <b>opera</b> was reinforced by Meyerbeer's Paris publisher Maurice Schlesinger who had established his fortune {{on the back of}} Robert, and even persuaded Honoré de Balzac to write a novella (Gambara) to promote Les Huguenots. Schlesinger's publication of Franz Liszt's Reminiscences de Robert le diable sold out on the day of issue and was immediately reprinted. Such manoeuvres did little to endear Meyerbeer to his fellow artists, and indeed engendered envious comments of the sort already quoted from Berlioz and Chopin.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{characters}} in Carmen—the soldiers, the smugglers, the Gypsy women and the secondary leads Micaëla and Escamillo—are reasonably familiar types within the opéra comique tradition, although drawing them from proletarian life was unusual. The two principals, José and Carmen, lie outside the genre. While each is presented quite differently from Mérimée's portrayals of a murderous brigand and a treacherous, amoral schemer, even in their relatively sanitised forms neither corresponds to the norms <b>of</b> <b>opéra</b> comique. They are more akin to the verismo style that would find fuller expression in the works of Puccini.|$|E

5|$|The {{first public}} {{performance}} <b>of</b> <b>opera</b> {{in the new}} theatre took place on 26 January 1793, the dispute with the Lord Chamberlain over the licence having been settled. This theatre was, at that time, the largest in England, and it became {{the home of the}} Theatre Royal, Drury Lane company while that company's home theatre was itself rebuilt between 1791–94.|$|E
5|$|The opera reached Australia in 1999, at the Sydney Opera House under Patrick Summers, and was {{performed}} there again in July–August 2005 under Trevor Pinnock, with Michael Chance as Rinaldo. The new century saw {{a number of}} performances across Europe, including an appearance at the Göttingen International Handel Festival in 2004, with Nicholas McGegan conducting Concerto Köln. This production was well received by the public, but was criticised by Jochen Breiholz <b>of</b> <b>Opera</b> News for poor staging, indifferent singing and a substandard performance from the orchestra.|$|E

5|$|The opera's appeal lay {{not only}} in its story about a {{crippled}} shepherd boy healed on the first Christmas Eve but in its wedding <b>of</b> <b>opera</b> and the limitations of television. The broad effects of theater were eschewed and instead an intimacy appropriate to the television studio and home viewing was cultivated. The production starred Chet Allen as Amahl and Rosemary Kuhlmann as his mother. Kuhlmann reprised her role annually for many years.|$|E
5|$|Verdi was {{committed}} to the publisher Giovanni Ricordi for an opera—which became Stiffelio—for Trieste in the Spring of 1850; and, subsequently, following negotiations with La Fenice, developed a libretto with Piave and wrote the music for Rigoletto (based on Victor Hugo's Le roi s'amuse) for Venice in March 1851. This {{was the first of}} a sequence of three operas (followed by Il trovatore and La traviata) which were to cement his fame as a master <b>of</b> <b>opera.</b>|$|E

He announced that Acid2 would be a challenge to Microsoft to design Internet Explorer 7, then in development, to achieve {{a greater degree of}} standards compliance than previous versions of Internet Explorer. The original Acid1 test had forced browser makers to fix their applications or face embarrassment; Lie hoped that Acid2 would do the same.|$|E

5|$|Born in Bohemia (then part of Austrian Empire) as a German-speaking Jew of humble circumstances, Mahler {{displayed}} {{his musical}} gifts {{at an early}} age. After graduating from the Vienna Conservatory in 1878, he held a succession of conducting posts of rising importance in the opera houses of Europe, culminating in his appointment in 1897 {{as director of the}} Vienna Court Opera (Hofoper). During his ten years in Vienna, Mahler—who had converted to Catholicism to secure the post—experienced regular opposition and hostility from the anti-Semitic press. Nevertheless, his innovative productions and insistence on the highest performance standards ensured his {{reputation as one of the}} greatest <b>of</b> <b>opera</b> conductors, particularly as an interpreter of the stage works of Wagner, Mozart, and Tchaikovsky. Late in his life he was briefly director of New York's Metropolitan Opera and the New York Philharmonic.|$|E
5|$|Following {{years of}} {{disruption}} and conflict, stability was {{restored to the}} opera house and its two companies after the appointment in May 2001 of a new chief executive, Tony Hall, formerly a senior executive at the BBC. The following year Antonio Pappano succeeded Haitink as music director of The Royal Opera. Following the redevelopment, a second, smaller auditorium, the Linbury Studio Theatre has been made available for small-scale productions by The Royal Opera and The Royal Ballet, for visiting companies, and for work produced in the ROH2 programme, which supports new work and developing artists. The Royal Opera encourages young singers {{at the start of}} their careers with the Jette Parker Young Artists Programme; participants are salaried members of the company and receive daily coaching in all aspects <b>of</b> <b>opera.</b>|$|E
5|$|Handel {{then spent}} time in Rome, where the {{performance}} <b>of</b> <b>opera</b> was forbidden by Papal decree, and in Naples. He applied himself to the composition of cantatas and oratorios; at that time there was little difference (apart from increasing length) between cantata, oratorio and opera, all based on the alternation of secco recitative and aria da capo. Works from this period include Dixit Dominus and the dramatic cantata Aci, Galatea e Polifemo, written in Naples. While in Rome, probably through Alessandro Scarlatti, Handel had become acquainted with Cardinal Grimani, a distinguished diplomat who wrote libretti in his spare time, and acted as an unofficial theatrical agent for the Italian royal courts. He was evidently impressed by Handel {{and asked him to}} set his new libretto, Agrippina. Grimani intended to present this opera at his family-owned theatre in Venice, the Teatro San Giovanni Grisostomo, as part of the 1709–10 Carnevale season.|$|E
