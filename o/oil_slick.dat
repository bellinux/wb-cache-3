5|$|On 3 July, Linienschiffsleutnant Ludwig Müller sailed U-20 {{out from}} Trieste for the Gulf of Venice. A day later, U-20 was spotted by the Italian {{submarine}} F-12, {{which was on}} patrol in the northern Adriatic. F-12 initially pursued U-20 underwater, {{and then on the}} surface. At a range of , F-12 torpedoed U-20 at position , sinking her with all hands. There was no wreckage on the surface, only an <b>oil</b> <b>slick.</b> Like all of her sister boats, U-20 had no wartime successes.|$|E
5|$|Several {{fires and}} {{industrial}} incidents {{occurred in the}} 1980s. In 1981, an <b>oil</b> <b>slick</b> affected the coastline of Skagen municipality, and in 1985 a pipe bomb exploded at Ankermedet School. Skagen ice factory was affected by a chemical incident in 1989. A new shrimp factory opened in the industrial area in 1991, while the local cinema was closed in 1993. There was a major fire on the Hulsig Heath dunes in 1996.|$|E
5|$|Wainwright {{charged to}} the attack, but the {{submarine}} submerged almost immediately. Upon reaching {{the spot where}} the submarine had been, the warship located an <b>oil</b> <b>slick</b> and began dropping depth charges which failed to achieve positive results. Approaching darkness and the necessity of escorting an Admiralty oiler forced Wainwright to break off her attack. After she shepherded the oiler to safety, she returned to the area of her attack and patrolled throughout the night, but the submarine had apparently retired from the neighborhood.|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} recent {{advances}} in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) polarimetry to observe sea <b>oil</b> <b>slicks</b> and man-made metallic targets are reviewed {{in the frame of}} the ESA funded PolSAR-Ap project. The most up-to-dated quad-pol approaches to observe sea <b>oil</b> <b>slicks</b> and metallic targets are reviewed and their performance is discussed against conventional single- and dual-pol approaches using actual L- and C-band Single Look Complex (SLC) SAR data. The unique benefits of quad-pol SAR data to observe both <b>oil</b> <b>slicks</b> and metallic targets are clearly shown...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} hybrid-polarity (HP) {{architecture}} is exploited to observe sea <b>oil</b> <b>slicks.</b> HP features are interpreted {{in terms of}} sea surface scattering with or without <b>oil</b> <b>slicks,</b> under low to moderate wind conditions. They are shown to exhibit a different sensitivity with respect to slick-free, weak-damping slick-covered and oil-covered sea surface. This sensitivity is verified against HP measurements obtained transforming actual L- and C-band quad-polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data where both <b>oil</b> <b>slicks</b> and weak-damping look-alikes are present. Experiments demonstrate: a) the remarkable performance of HP features to both observe <b>oil</b> <b>slicks</b> and distinguishing them from weak-damping look-alikes; b) the marginal effect played by the sensor’s noise floor on HP features performance; c) the pronounced sensitivity of the HP features to the damping properties of the surfactants; d) the comparable performance that characterizes polarimetric entropy derived by HP and conventional polarimetric measurements...|$|R

25|$|Beginning 20 September 1942, PC-552 had {{her first}} convoy escort patrol. The next day PC-552 made contact was with a {{submarine}} attacking when contact was made again on 22 September. An aircraft assisted and an <b>oil</b> <b>slick</b> was observed, {{but there was no}} proof the attack was successful. On 27 September 1942, the ship berthed at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.|$|E
25|$|The {{line was}} expanded, the ships began a sweep through the area, {{determined}} {{to prevent the}} submarine's escape. Varian made contact once more at 1731 and Flaherty was ordered to attack. She fired at 1810. Four minutes later a small <b>oil</b> <b>slick</b> began coming to the surface. Flaherty made another Hedgehog attack at 1828, and at 1838 the U-boat broke the surface.|$|E
40|$|Numerous <b>oil</b> <b>slicks</b> {{of natural}} origin were {{revealed}} in the southwest part (SW) of Caspian Sea on the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images acquired by the Envisat satellite in 2003 - 2004. Analysis of the SAR images together with bathymetry, geophysical and seismic data in geographic information system showed that the main hydrocarbon contribution visible on the sea surface as <b>oil</b> <b>slicks</b> comes from the natural seepage. <b>Oil</b> <b>slicks</b> are basically concentrated over the local geological formations of the sedimentary cover having oil and gas resources. In total about 90 seeps distributed across the SW Caspian Sea having repeating regime and an active type were identified. Seepage rate {{of oil in the}} SW Caspian Sea is estimated to be up to 16, 000 metric tons per year. Conclusion is done that the SAR onboard the Envisat satellite is an excellent tool for studying oil seeps through observation <b>oil</b> <b>slicks</b> floating on the sea surface. 1...|$|R

25|$|Oil spills at sea are {{generally}} much more damaging {{than those on}} land, since they can spread for hundreds of nautical miles in a thin <b>oil</b> <b>slick</b> which can cover beaches with a thin coating of oil. These can kill seabirds, mammals, shellfish and other organisms they coat. Oil spills on land are more readily containable if a makeshift earth dam can be rapidly bulldozed around the spill site before most of the oil escapes, and land animals can avoid the oil more easily.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the search}} and rescue {{aircraft}} deployed to look for them, a PBM Mariner with a 13-man crew, also disappeared. A tanker {{off the coast of}} Florida reported seeing an explosion and observing a widespread <b>oil</b> <b>slick</b> when fruitlessly searching for survivors. The weather was becoming stormy {{by the end of the}} incident. According to contemporaneous sources the Mariner had a history of explosions due to vapour leaks when heavily loaded with fuel, as it might have been for a potentially long search-and-rescue operation.|$|E
25|$|Locals were {{thankful that}} the wreck was mostly cargo, so {{the risk of}} {{pollution}} was much less than it could have been, {{such as in the}} aftermath of the Torrey Canyon oil spill. The specialist salvage vessel Salvage Chief removed 90 tonnes (98%) of fuel from the Cita before she sank, leaving only a minor <b>oil</b> <b>slick.</b> Oiled sand on Porth Hellick beach, part of the Isles of Scilly SSSI, was removed by excavation. Three tugs were summoned to collect the containers drifting around the Celtic Sea.|$|E

40|$|Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) {{satellite}} images {{have proven to}} be a successful tool for identifying <b>oil</b> <b>slicks.</b> Natural <b>oil</b> seeps can be detected as elongated, radar-dark slicks in SAR images. Use of SAR images for seep detection is enhanced by a Texture Classifying Neural Network Algorithm (TCNNA), which delineates areas where layers of floating oil suppress Bragg scattering. The effect is strongly influenced by wind strength and sea state. A multi orientation Leung-Malik filter bank [1] is used to identify slick shapes under projection of edges. By integrating ancillary data consisting of the incidence angle, descriptors of texture and environmental variables, considerable accuracy were added to the classification ability to discriminate false targets from <b>oil</b> <b>slicks</b> and look-alike pixels. The reliability of the TCNNA is measured after processing 71 images containing <b>oil</b> <b>slicks...</b>|$|R

25|$|USAT Meigs {{was one of}} {{the small}} fleet the Army {{maintained}} during the inter-war years and operated in the Pacific as a freight and animal transport. In 1939, with USAT Ludington, Meigs was one of only two Army owned freight transports. Included in the requirement to transport army goods and personal possessions of personnel changing duty stations to the Pacific was transport of cavalry and personal horses of officers with occasional mention of the ship transporting notable horses or owners transferring between Pacific and continental postings. In July 1938 Meigs found an <b>oil</b> <b>slick</b> along the course of the lost Pan American flying boat Hawaii Clipper about 500 miles from Manila, took samples and stood by for further investigation.|$|E
25|$|While {{operating}} the crank {{a piece of}} shrapnel entered Anderson's back, paralyzing his legs but he continued to lower the boat and after looking {{around to see if}} anybody else needed help, the ensign slipped over the side into an <b>oil</b> <b>slick.</b> With a broken leg Anderson swam over to a wounded officer in the water and attempted to pull him to one of the life rafts but the man died of his wound first and a few moments later the Germans lowered boats and began rescuing the Americans. The Germans fired 148 shells and one torpedo while Stanvac Calcutta fired only twenty-five, hundreds of machine gun rounds were also expended by both sides.|$|E
25|$|After a {{few more}} hours, the strikers {{attempted}} to burn the barges. They seized a raft, loaded it with oil-soaked timber and floated it toward the barges. The Pinkertons nearly panicked, and a Pinkerton captain had to threaten to shoot anyone who fled. But the fire burned itself out before it reached the barges. The strikers then loaded a railroad flatcar with drums of oil and set it afire. The flatcar hurtled down the rails toward the mill's wharf where the barges were docked. But the car stopped at the water's edge and burned itself out. Dynamite was thrown at the barges, but it only hit the mark once (causing a little damage to one barge). At 2:00p.m., the workers poured oil onto the river, hoping the <b>oil</b> <b>slick</b> would burn the barges; attempts to light the slick failed.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the spatial and temporal variations of two groups of <b>oil</b> <b>slicks</b> with similar features that were observed in the North Sea by spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) TerraSAR-X (TSX) and TanDEM-X (TDX) within 13 hours of each other, which were operating in the satellite constellation. Based on the SAR observations and the General NOAA Operational Modeling Environment (GNOME) simulations of the oil trajectories, {{it is unlikely that}} the oil spills observed by TSX on 21 August 2012 entirely drifted from the oil spills observed by TDX on 20 August. Rather, the <b>oil</b> <b>slicks</b> observed after 13 hours were likely composed of two parts. One part was the new oil spills that started to leak sometime after the first SAR acquisition on 20 August and that were subsequently observed on 21 August. The other part was the older oil spills that had drifted from the original <b>oil</b> <b>slicks</b> observed on 20 August by TDX. The fast weathering of light crude oil and the mixture of oil and water produced in the Forties platforms should contribute to the rapid dispersion and dissipation of the previously observed <b>oil</b> <b>slicks.</b> The findings of this study contribute to our understanding of the life history of oil spill on the sea surface around offshore drilling platforms...|$|R

25|$|Trout {{stood out}} of Pearl Harbor on 21 May 1942, as a unit of Task Group 7.1, the Midway Island Patrol Group {{consisting}} of 12 submarines. Her station was south of the island as nine of the submarines were positioned fan-like {{to the west of}} Midway in preparation for the Japanese attack. At 08:12 on 4 June, Trout sighted a Japanese fighter plane preparing to attack from astern. She went deep and heard a series of light explosions. On 9 June, Trout passed through a large <b>oil</b> <b>slick</b> and some debris before rescuing two Japanese from a large wooden hatch cover. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 14 June without firing a torpedo and began a major refit that included installation of search radars and JP sonar in preparation for deployment to Australia. The Trout also carried two POWs from the sunken Japanese cruiser Mikuma.|$|E

500|$|On 8 September, as McDougal escorted {{a convoy}} off the {{southwest}} coast of England, she detected a surfaced submarine {{in the early}} morning hours and gave chase at full speed.

40|$|Radar is {{currently}} used for detecting and monitoring <b>oil</b> <b>slicks</b> {{on the sea}} surface. The four-frequency radar system is used to acquire synthetic aperature imagery of the sea surface on which the <b>oil</b> <b>slicks</b> appear as a nonreflecting area on the surface surrounded by the usual sea return. The value of this technique was demonstrated, when the four-frequency radar system was used to image the oil spill of tanker which has wrecked. Imagery was acquired on both linear polarization (horizontal, vertical) for frequencies of 428, 1228, and 8910 megahertz. Vertical returns strongly indicated the presence of oil while horizontal returns failed to detect the slicks. Such a result is characteristic of the return from the sea and cannot presently be interpreted as characteristics of oil spills. Because an airborne imaging radar is capable of providing a wide-swath coverage under almost all weather conditions, it offers promise {{in the development of}} a pollution-monitoring system that can provide a coastal watch for <b>oil</b> <b>slicks...</b>|$|R

500|$|The Baker shot {{produced}} so many unusual {{phenomena that}} a conference was held {{two months later}} to standardize nomenclature and define new terms for use in descriptions and analysis.

Eventually it slowed to the speed of sound in water, which is one mile per second (1600m/s), five times faster than that of sound in air. On the surface, the shock wave was visible as the leading edge of a rapidly expanding ring of dark water, called the [...] "slick" [...] for its resemblance to an <b>oil</b> <b>slick.</b> Close behind the slick was a visually more dramatic, but less destructive whitening of the water surface called the [...] "crack".|$|E

Our new findings suggest that groups of <b>oil</b> <b>slicks</b> with similar features observed by consecutive SAR acquisitions might have leaked at different times during the interval between the two consecutive observations...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the effects of the wind drift factor under strong tidal conditions in the western coastal area of Korea on the movement of <b>oil</b> <b>slicks</b> caused by the Hebei Spirit oil spill accident in 2007. The movement of <b>oil</b> <b>slicks</b> was computed using a simple simulation model based on the empirical formula as a function of surface current, wind speed, and the wind drift factor. For the simulation, the Environmental Fluid Dynamics Code (EFDC) model and Automatic Weather System (AWS) were used to generate tidal and wind fields respectively. Simulation results were then compared with 5 sets of spaceborne optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. From the present study, it was found that highest matching rate between the simulation results and satellite imagery was obtained with different values of the wind drift factor, and to first order, this factor was linearly proportional to the wind speed. Based on the results, a new modified empirical formula was proposed for forecasting the movement of <b>oil</b> <b>slicks</b> on the coastal area...|$|R
