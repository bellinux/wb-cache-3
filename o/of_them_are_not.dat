Most <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> expected to finish one-day races, having worked in support for their teams (in this case, nations) to place their riders with better climbing skills in good positions once the mountainous part of a course begins. Many of these riders also sought to conserve themselves for the time trial that was to come. Additionally, if a rider was lapped by the race leader on the Badaling circuit, he {{would be forced to}} stop.|$|E

There were 260 and 90 recorded Sallekhana deaths among Svetambara and Digambara Jains respectively between 1993 and 2003. According to Jitendra Shah, the Director of L D Institute of Indology in Ahmedabad, {{an average of}} about 240 Jains practice Sallekhana each year in India.

Blue Landers play multiple roles in The Guardian Legend. Some <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> items but non-player characters that dispense {{advice to the}} player or exchange upgrades for power chips; others provide a password that allows the player to resume the game {{at a later time}} with their progress retained. These Blue Landers also serve as checkpoints; players can restart their game in these designated rooms after being defeated provided the system has not been turned off.|$|E
5|$|The {{only reason}} the Nazis put on {{prisoner}} broadcasts {{is to get}} people justifiably anxious about relatives reported missing at the front {{to listen to their}} propaganda. Although many of the messages undoubtedly are true, they represent but a small fraction of our prisoners and we have no assurance that many <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> faked from papers picked up on the battlefield. What concerns some of us is the consequences of listening to Nazi broadcasts unless you are a well-trained listener (and often, even if you are). Nazi arguments often sound plausible. A person may listen to them with all the skepticism in the world, knowing that every word is a lie. But if the content is sufficiently sensational (and it often is) the source may be forgotten in time, and out pops the Nazi lie, all unsuspecting.|$|E

This death rate remained stable between 2000 and 2009. This figure has been influenced by numerous factors.

Approximately 46 percent of new mothers receive fewer than four post-natal care sessions. Most women give birth outside of health centres, {{and the number of}} those who had assistance in giving birth is decreasing; according to Sharp and Kruse, 35 percent of Malagasy women who give birth outside of health centres do not receive medical care. Abortions due to unwanted pregnancies are also a major contributor.|$|E
