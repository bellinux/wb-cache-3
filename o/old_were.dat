5|$|Timby et al. (2014) also {{assessed}} {{the potential impact}} of MFGM supplementation on cognitive development in term infants. In this double-blind RCT, term infants (<2 months <b>old)</b> <b>were</b> fed until 6 months of age either a control formula (n=64) or an MFGM-supplemented formula (n=71). A breastfed reference group (n=70) was also included. Cognitive assessment done using the BSID-III at 12 months of age showed that the MFGM-fed infants exhibited significantly higher mean cognitive scores than the control group (105.8 vs 101.8; P<0.008), and not significantly different from the breastfed reference group. In contrast, {{there were no significant differences}} in motor domain scores between the three groups, and both experimental and control formula groups scored lower than the reference group in the verbal domain.|$|E
5|$|In Panama, it breeds year-round without {{apparent}} seasonal variability. According to Omar Linares's Mamíferos de Venezuela (Mammals of Venezuela), reproductive {{activity is}} highest in June–July and December. In the laboratory, the gestation period is 28days; Linares reports {{that it is}} 20 to 30days in the wild. Females produce an average of six litters per year {{and there are two}} to five (average 3.92) young per litter, so that a single female may produce about 24 young per year; this is likely an overestimate because most females would not live for a full year. Larger females may have larger litters. Animals become sexually mature when less than two months old; in Fleming's study, some females in juvenile fur, probably less than 50days <b>old,</b> <b>were</b> already pregnant. The oldest specimen Fleming observed was nine months old; he estimated that animals were unlikely to live {{for more than a year}} in the wild and that the mean age at death was 2.9months.|$|E
5|$|On March 25, 1998, {{the station}} at Watsessing Avenue {{was given the}} State Historical Preservation Organization honor that Ampere, Glen Ridge and Bloomfield {{stations}} received just fourteen years prior. The station continued to receive service through the opening of Montclair Connection on September 30, 2002, which ended service as the Montclair Branch and began as the Montclair-Boonton Line, still the first station on the line after Newark Broad Street Station. On September 10, 2007, New Jersey Transit announced the canopies of the old station, then 95 years <b>old,</b> <b>were</b> to be restored and repaired. The service contracted a $1.7 million project to Watertrol Incorporated of Cranford. At that time, the station served an average of 200people daily. Improvements for the station included brand new canopy lighting, repairs to the cantilever canopies, replacement of stairways and fencing, along with changing roof tiles and a new drainage system to replace the 1912 version. When the construction was finished in October 2008, the station now served nearly 450people daily on average. A ceremony to mark its completion was held on October 30, 2008.|$|E

5|$|During the 7th century CE, a settled {{community}} {{known as}} Vijayapura, a tributary to the Srivijaya empire, {{was thought to}} have existed in northwest Borneo. The earliest kingdom, supposed to have existed from the 9th century, was Po Ni, as recorded in the Chinese geographical treatise Taiping Huanyu Ji. It was believed that Po Ni existed {{at the mouth of}} Brunei River and was the predecessor to the Bruneian Empire. As China had been under the conquest of Mongol Empire, all Chinese vassal state subsequently controlled by the Mongol emperors of China. Early in 1292, Kublai Khan is said to have sending an expedition to northern Borneo, before departing for the invasion of Java in 1293. As a result of this campaign, it is believed that many of his followers in addition to other Chinese traders eventually settled and established their own colony at Kinabatangan River. In the 14th century, Brunei became the vassal state of Majapahit but in 1370 transferred its allegiance to Ming dynasty of China. The Maharaja Karna of Borneo then paid a visit to Nanjing with his family until his death. He was succeeded by his son Hsia-wang who agreed to send tribute to China once every three years. Since then, Chinese junks came to northern Borneo with cargoes of spices, bird nests, shark fins, camphor, rattan and pearls. More Chinese traders eventually settled in Kinabatangan, as stated in both Brunei and Sulu records. A younger sister of Huang Senping (Ong Sum Ping), the Governor of the Chinese settlement then married Sultan Ahmad of Brunei. Perhaps due to this relationship, a burial place with 2,000 wooden coffins, some estimated to be 1,000 years <b>old,</b> <b>were</b> discovered in Agop Batu Tulug Caves and around the Kinabatangan Valley area. It is believed that this type of funeral culture was brought by traders from Mainland China and Indochina to northern Borneo as similar wooden coffins were also discovered in these countries. In addition with the discovery of Chinese ceramics from a shipwreck in Tanjung Simpang Mengayau which estimated to be from 960–1127 A.D. of Song dynasty and Vietnamese Đông Sơn drum in Bukit Timbang Dayang on Banggi Island that had existed between 2,000–2,500 years ago.|$|E
