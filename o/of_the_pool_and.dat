25|$|Wilder {{was adamant}} that {{the corpse of}} Joe Gillis {{be seen from the}} bottom of the pool, but {{creating}} the effect was difficult. The camera was placed inside a specially constructed box and lowered underwater, but the result disappointed Wilder, who insisted on further experiments. The shot was finally achieved by placing a mirror on the bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> <b>and</b> filming Holden's reflection from above with the distorted image of the policemen standing around the pool and forming a backdrop.|$|E
25|$|The Golden Temple complex {{originally}} {{was open and}} had numerous trees around the pool. It is now a walled, two storey courtyard with four entrances, that preserve three Ber trees (jujube). One of them is {{to the right of}} the main ghanta ghar deori entrance with the clock, and it is called the Ber Baba Buddha. It is believed in the Sikh tradition to be the tree where Baba Buddha sat to supervise the construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> <b>and</b> first temple.|$|E

25|$|At the Institute for Marine Mammal Studies in Mississippi, it {{has also}} been {{observed}} that the resident dolphins seem to show an awareness of the future. The dolphins are trained to keep their own tank clean by retrieving rubbish and bringing it to a keeper, to be rewarded with a fish. However, one dolphin, named Kelly, has apparently learned a way to get more fish, by hoarding the rubbish under a rock at the bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> <b>and</b> bringing it up one small piece at a time.|$|E
25|$|Pavey Ark is {{the largest}} cliff in the Langdales, but faces east over Stickle Tarn and is less {{prominent}} {{from the floor of}} Great Langdale away to the south. The main face is a little over {{a quarter of a mile}} across and drops about 400ft. To the south-west it merges into the crags of Harrison Stickle, while the northern end peters out into the valley of Bright Beck. Stickle Tarn is wholly within the territory of the Ark, a corrie tarn which has been dammed to create additional capacity. The stone-faced barrage is low enough not to spoil the character <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool,</b> <b>and</b> the water is used for public consumption in the hotels and homes below. The tarn has a depth of around 50ft.|$|E
25|$|In 2012 in Vietnam a {{group of}} {{scientists}} took in four Irrawaddy Dolphins and provided them with medical care to see how they would survive. However, they found this to be the first case they saw Irrawaddy Dolphins to have bacterial infection. The bacertial infection, Chorioamnionitis is common in many marine animals, however when these few Dolphins were taken in the scientists discovered this same bacterial infection {{for the first time in}} this group of dolphins. This disease mostly affects animals that are pregnant because the infection occurs through the umbilical cord and goes into the maternal bloodstream. One of the dolphins the scientists in Vietnam was pregnant and before her death was found circling around the bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> <b>and</b> was found dead early the next morning. This bacterial infection affects many organs in the body of the animal.|$|E

25|$|The {{floor of}} the tank was {{watertight}} due to finely fitted bricks and mud laid on edge {{with a kind of}} plaster and the side walls were constructed in a similar manner. To make the tank even more watertight, a thick layer of bitumen (waterproof tar) was laid along the sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> <b>and</b> presumably also on the floor. Brick colonnades were discovered on the eastern, northern and southern edges. The preserved columns had stepped edges that may have held wooden screens or window frames. Two large doors lead into the complex from the south and other access was from the north and east. A series of rooms were located along {{the eastern edge of the}} building and in one room was a well that may have supplied some of the water needed to fill the tank. Rainwater also may have been collected for this purpose, but no inlet drains have been found.It had a long bathing pool built with waterproof bricks.|$|E
25|$|After filming was {{completed}} on Fiesta, Williams {{appeared in the}} romance This Time for Keeps (1947) with singer Johnnie Johnston. In 1948, Williams {{signed a contract with}} swimwear company Cole of California to appear as their spokesperson, and Williams and the other swimmers in her films wore Cole swimsuits. Since the aqua-musicals were an entirely new genre, the studio's costume designers had little experience creating practical swimsuits. William's plaid flannel swimsuit for Thrill of a Romance (1945) was so heavy that she was dragged to the bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool,</b> <b>and</b> had to unzip the suit, swimming naked {{to the edge of the}} pool to avoid drowning. Cole swimsuits used latex, which meant zippers were no longer necessary. While filming Skirts Ahoy (1952), Williams discovered that members of the WAVES program received thin, cotton, shapeless swimsuits as part of their uniforms. Williams modeled a Cole swimsuit for the Secretary of the Navy and explained that the new swimsuits helped support women's figures. The United States Navy ordered 50,000 suits immediately.|$|E
25|$|At Saxilby, the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway {{crosses the}} waterway, to {{run along the}} south bank {{all the way to}} Lincoln. There was once a swing bridge beyond the railway bridge, which was removed in 1937, {{although}} the foundations are still obvious. Access over the canal at this point was re-instated in 1987, when a footbridge was installed. The original bridge was manufactured in 1884, and crossed the Great Northern Railway at Newark-on-Trent for 103 years before it was put to a new use. The A57 crosses to the north bank soon after the railway bridge. The River Till flows south and under the road to join the Fossdyke, after which a new marina has been built at Burton Meadows. Because the construction has breached the flood bank, it is protected by a flood gate. The canal crosses under the A46 road on the outskirts of Lincoln, and then over a drainage ditch, to run alongside the Carholme golf club. The final bridge carries the B1273 Brayford Way over the canal as it enters Brayford Pool, once a busy commercial wharf in the centre of Lincoln, but now a marina with the University on the southern bank. The unnavigable River Witham flows into the bottom end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool,</b> <b>and</b> becomes the Witham Navigation when it flows out on its way to Boston.|$|E

500|$|The final part of {{the book}} {{continues}} the story from when Olivero and Sally disappear under the water. A large bubble forms around them, transporting them to the centre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> <b>and</b> ascending into a large grotto, from where they proceed on foot through a series of adjoining caverns. Sally tells Olivero that this is the country she and her brother left 30years ago. Soon they encounter her people, to whom Sally, or Siloēn as she is properly known, explains that many years ago she wandered off and became lost, but that she has now returned with one who [...] "was lost too, and now wishes to dwell among us". Olivero and Siloēn are welcomed into the community, where life is ordered around a progression from lower to upper ledges: the first ledge teaches the pleasures of youth; on the second ledge the pleasure of manual work is learned; on the third of opinion and argument; and finally, on the upper ledge, the [...] "highest pleasure", of solitary thought.|$|E
500|$|The {{position}} of the pools away from Sydney Gardens and the other attractions in the city centre, added to the downturn in Bath's popularity as a spa town, led to bankruptcy for the developers. The nearby Cleveland Bridge opened in 1826 making the crossing of the river [...] closer to the baths. The site was acquired by Reverend Race Godfrey in 1827. He ran the baths until the 1860s, improving the facilities and providing a ladies' pool in 1827 and another small pool for children the 1850s. In the 1867 the baths were run by a Mr W. Evans who taught swimming, but refused a request from Bath Corporation {{to make it into}} a public swimming bath [...] as this would [...] "destroy its prestige". In the 1890s the baths were brought from the owners, The Bath College Company, by Bath Corporation's Waterworks Committee. They were then refurbished and opened to the public. The pool was extended in the early 20th century and shelters were added at the eastern end. In 1967 management transferred to the Bath Spa Committee who concreted the floor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> <b>and</b> added a cascade. Competition from the indoor pool at the Bath Sports and Leisure centre which opened in the 1970s reduced the public funding available.|$|E
