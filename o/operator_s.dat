25|$|Eugene Wigner {{showed that}} a {{symmetry}} operation S of a Hamiltonian is represented, in quantum mechanics either by a unitary <b>operator,</b> <b>S</b> = U, or an antiunitary one, S = UK where U is unitary, and K denotes complex conjugation. These are the only operations that act on Hilbert space so as to preserve {{the length of the}} projection of any one state-vector onto another state-vector.|$|E
25|$|A similar argument. with quaternions {{replacing}} the complex numbers, shows uniquess for the symplectic group, which corresponds to Hermitian matrices over R. This can also been see more directly by using complex structures. A complex structure is an invertible operator J with J2 = −I. preserving the symplectic form B and such that −B(Jx,y) {{is a real}} inner product. The symplectic group acts transitively on complex structures by conjugation. Moreover, the subgroup commuting with J is naturally identified with the unitary group for the corresponding complex inner product space. Uniqueness follows by showing that any compact subgroup K commutes with some complex structure J. In fact, averaging over Haar measure, there is a K-invariant inner product on the underlying space. The symplectic form yields an invertible skew-adjoint operator T commuting with K. The <b>operator</b> <b>S</b> = −T2 is positive, so has a unique positive square root, which commutes with K. So J = S−1/2T, the phase of T, has square −I and commutes with K.|$|E
