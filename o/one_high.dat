5|$|Taft {{was opposed}} to the {{traditional}} practice of rewarding wealthy supporters with key ambassadorial posts, preferring that diplomats not live in a lavish lifestyle and selecting men who, as Taft put it, would recognize an American when they saw <b>one.</b> <b>High</b> on his list for dismissal was the ambassador to France, Henry White, whom Taft knew and disliked from his visits to Europe. White's ousting caused other career State Department employees to fear that their jobs might be lost to politics. Taft also wanted to replace the Roosevelt-appointed ambassador in London, Whitelaw Reid, but Reid, owner of the New-York Tribune, had backed Taft during the campaign, and both William and Nellie Taft enjoyed his gossipy reports. Reid remained in place until his 1912 death.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect of}} {{population}} density on sexual selection for convict cichlids has been studied. When nest density was greater, the females {{tended to be}} larger, which is more accurately explained by density-dependent mate preference and mating competition, as opposed to predation and resource competition. Moreover, as the two nest density regimes were compared, with <b>one</b> <b>high</b> and one low, {{there was no significant}} difference in brood survival between the two; however, the convict cichlids did prefer to breed farther away from each other, not in close proximity. This indicates that there are some other costs with breeding in an environment with high population density, an example being energy loss because of the resulting increased aggression when guarding territory.|$|E
5|$|The two incisors on {{each side}} of the lower jaw are small and have three cusps. The lower canine (c1) has <b>one</b> <b>high</b> and narrow cusp. The second lower premolar (p2) is a large tooth with a high central cusp and high crests {{connecting}} this cusp to the front and back edges. A second, smaller cusp is present in the back crest. The fourth premolar (p4) also has a high central cusp; in addition, there are smaller roots before and behind it on the lingual side. This tooth has two roots. In the first lower molar (m1), a large tooth, the cusp complex at the front (the trigonid) is high and the one at the back (the talonid) is lower. Among the cusps of the trigonid, the protoconid is highest and the metaconid and paraconid are lower and about equally high. The cingula (shelves) at the front and the back are low. The second molar (m2) is similar and only a trifle smaller, but m3 is much smaller and has a reduced talonid. Length of m3 averages 2.37mm (SD 0.098mm) and width 1.76mm (SD 0.076mm).|$|E

5|$|Diver Rodney Joyce from Scarborough, Ontario, aged 18, {{drowned in}} a slow {{whirlpool}} effect in the pond below the waterfall on Victoria Day weekend in 1988. Joyce had been swimming for ten minutes, when he went closer to the falls to retrieve a frisbee. His brother Gregory, aged 20, rushed to help him, but was pulled under several times. Resuscitation efforts by security staff failed. In an inquest, Wonderland's director of engineering denied {{the existence of an}} undertow. A nearby life ring had been tied to a tree using three knots and was only equipped with 6 metres (20feet) of rope, not enough to reach the middle of the pool. <b>One</b> <b>high</b> diver, who had worked at the park for seven years, claims to have told his supervisor of the undertow during the previous season. That diver was concerned about landing someone, as he claimed unauthorized swimmers were a frequent occurrence at that time. The area was listed as barricaded in an early report, but later reports contradicted that. The witness claimed that there were 30 to 40 bathers at one time. The park's director of safety and security said he was never informed of the undertow, and only saw bathers in the pool on one occasion. Not only was there no statement about pool dangers on record, but the supervisor for the previous three years denied that anyone in their department had expressed concern. Security and extra signs were posted after the incident. Spokespeople pointed out that Joyce shouldn't have been throwing frisbees in the area and suggested that the witness shouldn't have continued to work for the park in the previous season if they had an unaddressed concern.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, center Dakari Johnson {{was named}} National Freshman of the Year by ESPN HS. In the {{following}} months, Okafor beat out Johnson {{for a spot}} on the 2011 FIBA Americas Under-16 Championship Team USA. Okafor spent his sophomore season ranked as the number one center and second best player in the national class of 2014 by SLAM Magazine behind Andrew Wiggins, according to SLAM's Franklyn Calle. In January 2012 during his sophomore season, he was ranked third in the class by ESPNU. By April, he was ranked second. By the end of his second year, there was talk that with Jabari Parker Chicago might produce the number <b>one</b> <b>high</b> school player in the country in back to back years, something that they had come close to with Mark Aguirre and Isiah Thomas in the late 1970s. Also in the 1981 NBA draft Aguirre and Thomas were selected first and second, respectively. On October 25, 2012, Andrew Wiggins reclassified into the class of 2013, which cleared the way for Okafor to assume the number one ranking in the Rivals.com ranking for the class of 2014. As of November 2012, he was listed number one in the national class of 2014 by Rivals.com and number two by ESPN. He remained number one according to Rivals with its March 14, 2013 rankings update, following his junior season.|$|E
5|$|Thơ's {{approach}} to removing Diệm supporters from positions of influence drew criticism from both supporters {{and opponents of}} the deposed president. Some felt he was not vigorous enough in removing pro-Diệm elements from authority, whereas others felt that {{the magnitude of the}} turnover of public servants was excessive and bordering on vengeance. A number of officials suspected of having engaged in corruption or Diệmist oppression were indiscriminately arrested without charge, most of whom were later released. Đính and the new national police chief, General Mai Hữu Xuân, were given control of the interior ministry. The pair were accused of arresting people en masse, before releasing them in return for bribes and pledges of loyalty. Not all officials under Diệm could automatically be considered pro-Diệm, yet there were calls for further removals of the old guard. The government was criticised for firing large numbers of district and provincial chiefs directly appointed by Diệm, causing a breakdown in law and order during the abrupt transition of power. <b>One</b> <b>high</b> profile and heavily criticised non-removal was that of General Đỗ Cao Trí, the commander of the ARVN I Corps who gained prominence for his particularly stringent anti-Buddhist crackdown in the central region around Huế. Trí was simply transferred to the II Corps in the Central Highlands directly south of the I Corps region.|$|E
