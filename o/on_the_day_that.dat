The selectors asked Don Bradman, Australia's leading batsman and state teammate to Brown and Fingleton, for advice. Bradman nominated Brown, believing that his style was better suited to English pitches. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>that</b> the team was selected, Bradman wrote in his newspaper column, criticising Fingleton's running between the wickets.
