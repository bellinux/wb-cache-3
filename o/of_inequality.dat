5|$|The Social Institutions and Gender Index (SIGI) is a {{recently}} developed measure of gender inequality calculated by analyzing social institutions, societal practices, and legal norms {{and how these}} factors largely frame gender norms within a society. By combining these sources <b>of</b> <b>inequality,</b> SIGI is able to penalize high levels <b>of</b> <b>inequality</b> {{in each of the}} applicable dimensions, allowing for only partial compensation by the gaps between the remaining dimensions and the highly inequitable one. Through its analysis of the institutional sources of gender inequality in over 100 countries, SIGI has been proven to add new insights into outcomes for women, even when other factors such as religion and region of the world are controlled for.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the 0 / 1 {{knapsack}} polytope. In particular, we introduce the class <b>of</b> weight <b>inequalities.</b> This class <b>of</b> <b>inequalities</b> is needed to describe the knapsack polyhedron when the weights of the items lie in certain intervals. A generalization <b>of</b> weight <b>inequalities</b> yields the so-called "weight-reduction principle" and the class <b>of</b> extended weight <b>inequalities.</b> The latter class <b>of</b> <b>inequalities</b> includes minimal cover and (1, k) -configuration <b>inequalities.</b> The properties <b>of</b> lifted minimal cover inequalities are extended to this general class <b>of</b> <b>inequalities.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} sets <b>of</b> <b>inequalities</b> in Real Analysis {{and construct}} a topology such that inequalities usually called “limit cases ” of certain sequences <b>of</b> <b>inequalities</b> {{are in fact}} limits- in the precise topological sense- of such sequences. To show the generality of the results, several examples are given for the notions introduced, and three main examples are considered: Sequences <b>of</b> <b>inequalities</b> relating real numbers, sequences <b>of</b> classical Hardy’s <b>inequalities,</b> and sequences <b>of</b> embedding <b>inequalities</b> for fractional Sobolev spaces. All examples are considered along with their limit cases, and it is shown {{how they can be}} considered as sequences of one “big ” space <b>of</b> <b>inequalities.</b> As a byproduct, we show how an abstract process to derive inequalities among homogeneous operators can be a tool for proving inequalities. Finally, we give some tools to compute limits <b>of</b> sequences <b>of</b> <b>inequalities</b> in the topology introduced, and we exhibit new applications. 1...|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a concept of}} dual consistency of systems <b>of</b> linear <b>inequalities</b> with full generality.

Typical dual consistent systems <b>of</b> <b>inequalities</b> are those which describe polymatroids, generalized polymatroids, and dual greedy polyhedra with certain choice functions. We show that the systems <b>of</b> <b>inequalities</b> for cardinality-constrained ordinary bipartite matching polytopes are not dual consistent in general, and give additional inequalities to make them dual consistent. Moreover, we show that ordinary systems <b>of</b> <b>inequalities</b> for the cardinality-constrained (poly) matroid intersection are not dual consistent, which disproves a conjecture of Maurras, Spiegelberg, and Stephan about a linear representation of the cardinality-constrained polymatroid intersection...|$|R
