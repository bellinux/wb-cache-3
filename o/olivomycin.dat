40|$|The DNA binding {{sites for}} the antitumor, antiviral, {{antibiotics}} chromomycin, mithramycin, and <b>olivomycin</b> on 70 base pairs of heterogeneous DNA have been determined by using the (methidiumpropyl-EDTA) iron(II) [MPE•Fe(II) ] DNA cleavage inhibition pattern technique. Two DNA restriction fragments 117 and 168 base pairs in length containing the lactose operon promoter-operator region were prepared with complementary strands labeled with ^(32) P at the 3 ' end. MPE•Fe(II) was allowed to partially cleave the restriction fragment preequilibrated with either chromomycin, mithramycin, or <b>olivomycin</b> {{in the presence of}} Mg^(2 +). The preferred binding sites for chromomycin, mithramycin, and <b>olivomycin</b> in the presence of Mg^(2 +) appear to be a minimum of 3 base pairs in size containing at least 2 contiguous dG•dC base pairs. Many binding sites are similar for the three antibiotics; chromomycin and <b>olivomycin</b> binding sites are nearly identical. The number of sites protected from MPE•Fe(II) cleavage increases as the concentration of drug is raised. For chromomycin/Mg^(2 +), the preferred sites on the 70 base pairs of DNA examined are (in decreasing affinity) 3 '-GGG, CGA > CCG, GCC > CGA, CCT > CTG- 5 '. The sequence 3 '-CGA- 5 ' has different affinities, indicating the importance of either flanking sequences or a nearly bound drug...|$|E

40|$|Part I {{describes}} {{the construction of}} the major carbon framework of olivin, the aglycone of a number of antitumor antibiotics collectively known as the <b>olivomycins.</b> A palladium(O) mediated cross-coupling of a metallated ethyl vinyl ether unit and an enol triflate derived from a readily available carbohydrate was accomplished. In this first key step, most of the carbon and oxygen atoms of the side chain and A ring of the aglycone were assembled {{in the form of a}} diene. The second key step was the Diels-Alder cycloaddition of the complex carbohydrate substituted diene to a highly functionalized naphthoquinone. The resulting cycloadduct, which was formed with complete regiochemical control, has all of the necessary functionality intact for eventual conversion to olivin;Part II describes a direct and operationally convenient synthesis of the DCB ring subunit of aklavinone, the aglycone of the potent cytostatic agent aclacinomycin A. The synthesis begins with a Diels-Alder reaction between 1 -trimethylsilyoxybutadiene and 2 -cyano- 5 -methoxy- 3 -phenylthio- 1, 4 -naphthoquinone. Oxidation of the Diels-Alder adduct produced a novel blocked anthraquinone tautomer. The blocked anthraquinone was converted to the DCB subunit of aklavinone by conjugate addition of a mixed ketene acetal, selective mercaptan oxidation, and elimination of benzenesulfenic acid and hydrocyanic acid. The three rings of the aklavinone precursor were constructed in high yield and with complete stereochemical control;Part III describes successful syntheses of nanaomycin A and deoxyfrenolicin, important members of the naphtho 2, 3 -c pyran- 5, 10 -quinone class of antibiotics. In addition, synthetic efforts toward the more complex members, griseusins A and B, are described. A key step in the syntheses of the two former members is a tandem Diels-Alder-retro-Claisen reaction between 3 -acyl- 5 -methoxy- 1, 4 -naphthoquinones and mixed vinyl ketene acetals. The resulting 2, 3 -dihydro-naphtho 1, 2 -b furans are oxidized in high yield to intermediate 3 -acyl- 2 -(2 -hydroxyalkyl) substituted naphthoquinones which spontaneously form hemiketals. Finally, the hemiketals were stereospecifically reduced to afford advanced intermediates in previously published syntheses of nanaomycin A and deoxyfrenolicin...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackground: Mithramycin, chromomycin, and <b>olivomycin</b> {{belong to}} the aureolic acid family of {{clinically}} important anti-tumor agents. These natural products share a common aromatic aglycone. Although isotope labeling studies have firmly established the polyketide origin of this aglycone, they do not distinguish between alternative biosynthetic models in which the aglycone is derived from one, two or three distinct polyketide moieties. We set out to determine the biosynthetic origin of this moiety using a recombinant approach in which the ketosynthase and chain-length factor proteins from the antibiotic-producer strain, which determine the chain length of a polyketide, are produced in a heterologous bacterial host. Results: The ketosynthase and chain-length factor genes from the polyketide synthase gene cluster from the mithramycin producer, Streptomyces argillaceus ATCC 12956, and the acyl carrier protein and ketoreductase genes from the actinorhodin polyketide synthase were expressed in Streptomyces coelicolor CH 999. The recombinant strain produced a 20 -carbon polyketide, comprising the complete backbone of the aglycone of mithramycin. Conclusions: The aglycone moieties of mithramycin, chromomycin, and <b>olivomycin</b> are derived from a single polyketide backbone. The nascent polyketide backbone must undergo a series of regiospecific cyclizations to form a tetracenomycin-like tetracyclic intermediate. The final steps in the aglycone biosynthetic pathway presumably involve decar☐ylation and oxidative cleavage between C- 18 and C- 19, followed by additional oxidation, reduction, and methylation reactions...|$|E

40|$|The {{preferred}} binding {{sites for}} mithramycin on four different DNA fragments {{have been investigated}} by DNAase I footprinting. Sites containing at least two contiguous GC base pairs are protected by the antibiotic, the preferred binding site consisting of the dinucleotide step GpG (or CpC). Related antibiotics chromomycin and <b>olivomycin</b> produce similar, but not identical footprinting patterns suggesting that they can recognize other sequences as well. All three antibiotics induce enhanced rates of enzyme cleavage at regions flanking some of their binding sites. These effects are generally observed in runs of A and T and are attributed to DNA structural variations induced {{in the vicinity of}} the ligand binding site.

40|$|The {{increase}} in fluorescence, upon interaction with several fluorescent dyes {{was found to}} depend on the base composition of DNA. 4 ', 6 -Diamidino- 2 -phenylindole- 2 HCl and Hoechst 33258 which bind to AT base pairs show a logarithmic relation. This relation is linear when DNAs interact with mithramycin, chromomycin A 3, and <b>olivomycin,</b> which bind to GC base pairs. Deviations from these relationships were observed for T 2 DNA, containing hydroxymethylcytosine, and for 2 C DNA, containing hydroxymethyluracil. On the basis of these data, a simple technique is proposed for determination of base composition. The presence of abnormal bases can be monitored by the use of given fluorophores.

40|$|Aceto-orcein {{staining}} is {{very good}} for pachytene chromosome analysis but does not stain spindles, spindle pole bodies, or the nucleolus satisfactorily. Hematoxylin is excellent for routine nuclear cytology of Neurospora and other fungi but is less useful than aceto-orcein for pachytene analysis because fine chromomere detail is not as clearly revealed or because the large dark-staining nucleolus may obscure underlying chromosomes. The Feulgen procedure using conventional Schiff's reagent has not proved useful for examining chromosomes of Neurospora and most other fungi, {{in part because of}} faint staining. Of various fluorochromes used by Raju for staining fungal nuclei (DAPI, Hoechst 33258, <b>olivomycin,</b> auromine O, and acriflavin), only acriflavin is especially suitable for staining meiotic chromosomes (Figures 1 and 2). Because acriflavin is DNA-specific, the nucleolus is transparent and strands of chromatin can be seen extending through it to the satellite (Raju 1986; Perkins et al. 1995).

40|$|Carbohydrates are {{a family}} of polyfunctional natural {{products}} and can be chemically modified in numerous ways. The primary significance of carbohydrates rests in their importance in biological functions. A particular class of sugars, namely, 2 -deoxy or C- 2 modified sugars has received a special attention, due to their importance in biological functions. These sugars are defined as carbohydrates carrying a hetero-atom, other than the hydroxyl group, and their derivatives. There is an ever-leading requirement to synthesize various carbohydrates-containing natural and un-natural products, such as, oligonucleotides, glycopeptides, antitumor drugs and cardiac glycosides, having C- 2 modified sugars. Chapter 1 describes various synthetic modifications, particularly at the C- 2 of a monosaccharide, as relevant to the work presented in this Thesis. 1, 2 -Unsaturated glycopyranosides, namely, glycals, are versatile synthetic intermediates for the elaboration {{to a number of}} functionalized glycosyl derivatives. A major utility of the glycals is their conversion to the 2 -deoxy glycosyl derivatives. In a programme, it was desired to identify a synthetic method to prepare 2 -deoxy sugar derivatives that are endowed with an anomeric activation. In particular, a thioglycoside activation was desired. In the event, a methodology was identified, which allowed the synthesis of activated 2 -deoxy- 1 -thioglycosides. The method involved reaction of a glycal with EtSH, in the presence of ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN) as the catalyst. The reaction was applicable to different epimeric glycals. Apart from the 2 -deoxy- 1 -thioglycosides, formation of the 2, 3 -unsaturated enoses, corresponding to the Ferrier product, also observed. Optimal conditions for the formation of the 2 -deoxy- 1 -thioglycosides were identified (Scheme 1) and the reaction was proposed to proceed through a radical oxocarbenium ion and a thiolate intermediate. (Fig) Scheme 1 Upon synthesis of 2 -deoxy- 1 -thioglycosides, few glycosylation reactions with both aglycosyl and glycosyl acceptors were performed and the α-anomeric 2 -deoxy glycosides were obtained exclusively. Chapter 2 summarizes synthesis, characterization of 2 -deoxy- 1 -thioglycosides and their glycosyl donor properties towards several glycosyl acceptors. Many naturally-occurring antibiotic and antitumor drugs contain 2 -deoxy glycosides as important structural components. For example, 2, 6 -dideoxy-hexopyranoses are common structural units of chromomycin A 3, <b>olivomycin</b> A and mithramycin. The most common structural features of these molecules are: (i) the presence of 2 -deoxy sugar residues and (ii) the sugar residues are connected to the aromatic moiety, through a β-glycosidic linkage. The synthesis of these biologically important 2 -deoxy glycosides encounters difficulties, due to the absence of stereoelectronic influences at C- 2 of the 2 -deoxy glycosyl derivatives. Direct glycosylation of phenols and naphthols with activated 2 -deoxy- 1 -thio-glycosides, {{in the presence of the}} thiophilic activator N-iodosuccinimide/triflic acid (NIS/TfOH), lead to the formation of the α-anomer, as the major glycosylated product (Scheme 2). (Fig) An effort was under taken to identify methods to prepare the 2 -deoxy aryl glycosides, in the β-anomeric configuration. A nucleophilic substitution reaction was anticipated to lead to the formation of β-anomeric glycosides. A halide substitution at C- 1 for an effective nucleophilic substitution was adopted. Thus, conversion of the activated 2 -deoxy- 1 -thioglycosides with Br 2 in the first step, followed by reaction of the resulting bromide with aryloxy anions, led to the facile conversion to 2 -deoxy glycosides in a nearly quantitative f-anomeric configuration at C- 1 (Scheme 3). Scheme 3 (Fig) Chapter 3 presents details of the methodologies that allow a facile preparation of each of the anomers of aryl 2 -deoxy-D-glycosides from a common precursor, namely, 2 -deoxy- 1 -thio-glycosides. An easy access to activated 2 -deoxy- 1 -thioglycosides from the 1, 2 -unsaturated sugar and their synthetic utility towards various glycosyl and aglycosyl acceptors led towards synthesis of 2 -deoxy disaccharides. Synthesis of six new 2 -deoxy-arabino-hexopyranosyl and 2 -deoxy-lyxo-hexopyranosyl sugar containing disaccharides were accomplished. These are: (i) 2 -deoxy-α-D-arabino-hexopyranosyl-(1 → 4) -D-glucopyranose (2 '-deoxy maltose); (ii) 2 -deoxy-α-D-lyxo-hexopyranosyl-(1 → 4) -D-glucopyranose; (iii) 2 -deoxy-α-D-arabino-hexopyranosyl-(1 → 4) - 2 -deoxy-D-arabino-hexopyranose (2, 2 '-dideoxy maltose); (iv) 2 -deoxy-α-D-lyxo- hexopyranosyl-(1 → 4) - 2 -deoxy-D-arabino-hexopyranose; (v) α-D-glucopyranosyl-(1 → 4) - 2 deoxy-D-arabino-hexopyranose (2 -deoxy maltose) and (vi) β-D-galactopyranosyl-(1 → 4) - deoxy-D-arabino-hexopyranoside (2 -deoxy lactose). The 2 '-deoxy and 2, 2 '-dideoxydisaccharides were synthesized using a 2 -deoxy glycosyl donor and a normal glycosyl acceptor (in case of 2 '-deoxy disaccharides) and a 2 -deoxy glycosyl acceptor (in case of 2, 2 '-dideoxy disaccharides) with a free OH group at C- 4, while the remaining hydroxyl groups protected suitably (Scheme 4). Scheme 4 (Fig) On the other hand, the syntheses of 2 -deoxy disaccharides were initiated from a D-maltose and D-lactose, respectively. The conversion of these disaccharides to a disaccharide glycals was targeted first and conversion of these glycals to a 2 -deoxy- 1 -thioglycosides or a 2 -deoxy- 1 -acetates, followed by a hydrolysis of the thiol moiety or the acetate group, afforded the 2 -deoxy disaccharides (Scheme 5). (Fig) Chapter 4 describes synthesis, characterization of 2 -deoxy, 2, 2 '-dideoxy and 2 '-deoxy disaccharides. Continuing the efforts to establish the utility of 2 -deoxy- 1 -thioglycosides as potential glycosyl donor, synthesis of 2 -deoxy cyclic and linear oligosaccharides was undertaken. Prominent among cyclic oligosaccharides are the cyclodextrins. Due to their unique structural and physical properties, cyclodextrins find manifold applications. Known methods to synthesize cyclic oligosaccharides are (i) the cyclization of linear oligosaccharides to produce the cyclic oligosaccharides and (ii) the synthesis of designed monomers and subjecting them to cyclooligomerization protocols. The cyclooligomerization was adopted to synthesize new types of 2 -deoxy cyclic-and linear oligosaccharides. After a series of trials, a disaccharide monomer, namely, ethyl 4 -O-(6 -O-benzoyl- 2, 3 -di-O-methyl-α-D-glucopyranosyl) - 2 -deoxy- 3, 6 -di-O-methyl-arabino-hexopyranoside (1), was identified as a suitable monomer for thecyclooligomerization protocol. For an effective oligomerization, the concentration of the monomer and the choice of the reagents are important. The reaction was conducted at three different monomer concentrations, 2 mM, 10 mM and 25 mM, using two thiophilic activators, namely, (i) NIS/TfOH and (ii) NIS/AgOTf. Better yields of the cyclic oligosaccharides, namely, the cyclic tetrasaccharide (2) (40 %) and cyclic hexasaccharide (3) (25 %), were isolated when the monomer (1) concentration was 25 mM and NIS/TfOH acid was used as the promoter (Scheme 6). The formation of linear disaccharide (4) (10 %) and tetrasaccharide (5) (18 %) was also observed at this concentration. On the other hand, when the reaction of the monomer was performed in the presence of NIS/AgOTf, the oligomerization reaction led to the formation of linear oligosaccharides, consisting of di-to eicosa-saccharides. Synthesis of different monomers, their characterization and oligomerization reaction using these monomers through a polycondensation protocol are discussed in Chapter 5. Scheme 6 (fig) In summary, the Thesis establishes the chemistry of 2 -deoxy sugars, formation of activated 2 -deoxy sugars, formation of alkyl and aryl glycosides, 2 -deoxy disaccharides, 2 -deoxy cyclic and linear oligosaccharides. Routine physical methods were used to characterize the newly formed 2 -deoxy sugars and the oligosaccharides. Single crystal X-ray structural determination was performed for an aryl 2 -deoxyglycosides, which provided the solid state configurational features of the 2 -deoxy pyranose.
