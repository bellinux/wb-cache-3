30|$|Abnormal {{positioning}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patella</b> {{is another}} pathology reported {{in patients with}} intraarticular adhesions (Noyes and Barber-Westin 2017). <b>The</b> results <b>of</b> <b>the</b> current study suggest that adhesions in the suprapatellar pouch may lead to proximal translation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patella,</b> most prominently at 0 degrees of flexion. A proximal position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patella</b> relative to <b>the</b> trochlear groove is known as patella alta (Insall and Salvati 1971). This condition predisposes the affected knee to patellofemoral dislocation due to decreased contact with the femur, especially at lower flexion angles (Fox et al. 2012). The current study also observed distal translation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patella</b> with anterior interval adhesions, which aligns well with <b>the</b> results <b>of</b> Ahmad et al.’s study (Ahmad et al. 1998). Distal positioning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patella</b> in <b>the</b> trochlear groove is known as patella baja and is associated with anterior knee pain, extensor lag, {{and a reduction in}} range of motion (Fox et al. 2012; Flören et al. 2007).|$|R

40|$|CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: Patellar {{tendinopathy}} is {{a common}} condition in sports. It may occur at any location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> patellar tendon, but the most commonly affected area is <b>the</b> inferior pole <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patella.</b> Among various diagnostic tests, the one most used is palpation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inferior pole <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patella.</b> <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> {{this study was to}} investigate <b>the</b> prevalence <b>of</b> pain complaints among individuals with pathological knee conditions and to evaluate palpation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inferior pole <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patella</b> as a diagnostic test for patellar tendinopathy. METHODS: Palpation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> patellar tendon was performed on 318 individuals who presented with knee-related complaints. Palpation was performed with the individual in the supine position and the knee extended. The age, gender, physical activity and labor activity of each individual were recorded at the time the symptoms appeared; the diagnosis was also recorded. RESULTS: <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> total number <b>of</b> individuals evaluated, 124 (39 %) felt pain on palpation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inferior pole <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patella.</b> <b>Of</b> these, only 40 (32. 3 %) received a diagnosis of patellar tendinopathy. We did not observe any difference with respect to gender and age distribution. When evaluating daily physical activity levels, however, we observed that individuals with pain on palpation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inferior pole <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patella</b> experienced more intense physical activity. CONCLUSIONS: Palpation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inferior pole <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patella</b> is a diagnostic procedure with high sensitivity and moderate specificity for diagnosing patellar tendinopathy, especially among individuals who perform activities with high functional demands.

Methods Patellar movement before and after TKA with and without patellar resurfacing was measured under dynamic conditions in an in vitro cadaver simulation. Physiologic Musculus quadriceps forces were applied to five physiologic human knee specimens undergoing simulated isokinetic extension motions, patellar movement was measured using an ultrasonic measurement system. Thereafter, the Interax ® I. S. A. -prosthesis system was implanted without and with resurfacing <b>the</b> <b>patella,</b> and patellar movement was again measured. Results <b>The</b> physiologic <b>patella</b> center moved on a semilunar path up to 6. 4 mm (SD 6. 4 mm) medially during extension. After TKA, <b>the</b> unresurfaced <b>patella</b> showed significantly less medial translation (p = 0. 04) than <b>the</b> resurfaced <b>patella.</b> Subsequent resurfacing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patella</b> then resulted in a return to mediolateral positioning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patella</b> similar to <b>the</b> physiological case, whereas <b>the</b> resurfaced <b>patella</b> tilted up to {{twice as much as}} physiologic.

40|$|Introduction: Permanent {{dislocation}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patella</b> (PDP) {{is a rare}} condition. In {{cases of}} PDP with tibiofemoral arthritis, total knee arthroplasty may be performed through a medial parapatellar approach with patellar realignment.
