5|$|On 16 September 2008, {{the body}} of British {{politician}} and diplomat Sir Mark Sykes was exhumed to study the RNA of the flu virus in efforts to understand the genetic structure of modern H5N1 bird flu. Sykes had been buried in 1919 in a lead coffin which scientists hoped had helped preserve the virus. However, the coffin {{was found to be}} split because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> soil over it, and the cadaver was badly decomposed. Nonetheless, samples of lung and brain tissue were taken through the split, with the coffin remaining in situ in the grave during this process.|$|E
5|$|The {{first phase}} saw the {{addition}} of an inner railway track, {{which was designed to}} take a third <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> the telescope. The outer railway track, which had been decaying and sinking over the previous years, was relaid in the second phase. Four bogies and their steelwork were added on the inner track, and the existing bogies on the outer track were overhauled.|$|E
5|$|The fossa is a {{carnivore}} that hunts {{small to}} medium-sized animals. One of eight carnivorous species endemic to Madagascar, the fossa is the island's largest surviving endemic terrestrial mammal {{and the only}} predator capable of preying upon adults of all extant lemur species, the largest of which can weigh as much as 90percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> the average fossa. Although it is the predominant predator of lemurs, reports of its dietary habits demonstrate {{a wide variety of}} prey selectivity and specialization depending on habitat and season; diet does not vary by sex. While the fossa is thought to be a lemur specialist in Ranomafana National Park, its diet is more variable in other rain forest habitats.|$|E

5|$|The loss <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> the gas {{taken from}} the {{cylinder}} makes the cylinder and diver more buoyant. This {{can be a problem}} if the diver is unable to remain neutrally buoyant {{towards the end of the}} dive because most of the gas has been breathed from the cylinder. The buoyancy change due to gas usage from back mounted cylinders is easily compensated by carrying sufficient diving weights to provide neutral buoyancy with empty cylinders at the end of a dive, and using the buoyancy compensator to neutralise the excess weight until the gas has been used.|$|E
5|$|These {{benefits}} meant that, {{as early}} as 1901, Fisher was pressing the advantages of oil fuel. There were technical problems with oil-firing, connected with the different distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> oil fuel compared to coal, and the problems of pumping viscous oil. The main problem with using oil for the battle fleet was that, {{with the exception of}} the United States, every major navy would have to import its oil. As a result, some navies adopted 'dual-firing' boilers which could use coal sprayed with oil; British ships so equipped, which included dreadnoughts, could even use oil alone at up to 60% power.|$|E
5|$|It was {{important}} {{to keep track of}} the amount of ice being loaded onto a ship for both commercial and safety reasons, so ice blocks were each weighed before they went onto a ship, and a total tally <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> the ice was recorded. Initially a crude method of loading involving ice tongs and a whip was used to lower the separated blocks of ice into the hold, but an improved method was developed by the 1870s involving a levered platform, superseded by a counterweighted platform device by 1890. Ships were loaded quickly to prevent the ice from melting and, in U.S. ports, an average cargo could be loaded in just two days. Freight charges were paid on the intake, or departure, weight of the cargo, and conditions were laid down on the handling of the ice along the route.|$|E

5|$|Sexual size {{dimorphism}} in {{this species}} {{is perhaps the}} greatest in any neognath bird. Males were considerably larger than females, measuring 90cm (35in) in length and weighing up to 28kg (62lb), whereas females were 70cm (28in) and weighed 17kg (37lb). This is only 60% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> a mature male. Their weight may have varied substantially due to fat cycles, meaning that individuals were fat during cool seasons, but slim during hot seasons, {{and may have been}} as low as 21kg in males and 13kg in females. Though male pigeons are usually larger than females, there is no direct evidence for the largest specimens actually being the males of the species, and this has only been assumed based on early works. Though the male was probably largest, this can only be confirmed by molecular sexing techniques, and not skeletal morphology alone.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{apparatus}} in {{the limbs}} {{of the horse}} - the suspensory apparatus and the stay apparatus. The fetlock joint is supported by group of lower leg ligaments, tendons and bones known as the suspensory apparatus. This apparatus carries much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> the horse, both when standing and while moving, and prevents the fetlock joint from hyperextending, especially when the joint is bearing weight. During movement, the apparatus stores and releases energy {{in the manner of}} a spring: stretching while the joint is extended and contracting (and thus releasing energy) when the joint flexes. This provides a rebound effect, assisting the foot in leaving the ground. This ability to use stored energy makes horses' gaits more efficient than other large animals, including cattle. The suspensory apparatus consists of the suspensory ligament, the check ligament, the deep digital flexor tendon, the superficial flexor tendon, the common digital extensor tendon and the sesamoid bones.|$|E
5|$|Sporadic {{experiments}} with numbered shirts {{took place in}} the 1920s but the idea did not initially catch on. The first major match in which numbers were worn was the 1933 FA Cup Final between Everton and Manchester City. Rather than the numbers being added to the clubs' existing strips, two special sets, one white and one red, were made for the final and allocated to the two teams by the toss of a coin. The Everton players wore numbers 1–11, while the City players wore 12–22. It was not until {{around the time of the}} Second World War that numbering became standard, with teams wearing numbers 1–11. Although there were no regulations on which player should wear which number, specific numbers came to be associated with specific positions on the field of play, a prime example being the number 9 shirt which was usually reserved for the team's main striker. In contrast to the usual practice, Scottish club Celtic wore numbers on their shorts rather than their shirts until 1975 for international matches, and until 1994 for domestic matches. The 1930s also saw great advancements in boot manufacture, with new synthetic materials and softer leathers becoming available. By 1936 players in Europe were wearing boots which weighed only a third <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> the rigid boots of a decade earlier, although British clubs did not adopt the new-style boots, with players such as Billy Wright openly pronouncing their disdain for the new footwear and claiming that it was more suited to ballet than football.|$|E

30|$|The Pyramid {{evaluation}} combines both {{a precision}} measure (as {{the score is}} a function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> summary) and <b>of</b> a recall measure (as the score is also a function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> optimal SCUs or Summarization Content Units). The score given by the pyramid method for a summary is a ratio <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weights</b> <b>of</b> its facts to <b>the</b> sum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weights</b> <b>of</b> an optimal summary. <b>The</b> pyramid score ranges from 0 to 1, and high scores show the summary content contain more heavily weighted facts. The n tiers pyramid refers to “pyramid of order n”. Given a pyramid <b>of</b> order n, <b>the</b> optimal summary content can be predicted which contain all the SCUs from the top tier and then from the next tier and so on. In other words an SCU from tier (n[*]−[*] 1) should not be expressed until the SCUs in tier n have been expressed. The score assigned is a ratio <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weights</b> <b>of</b> its SCUs to <b>the</b> sum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> optimal summary with <b>the</b> same number <b>of</b> SCUs. It ranges from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating that relatively more <b>of</b> <b>the</b> content is as highly weighted as possible [53, 54].|$|R
