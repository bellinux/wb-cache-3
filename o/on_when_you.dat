25|$|From the 1948–49 {{series against}} West Indies, Vizzy became a radio {{commentator}} {{and was the}} guest commentator for BBC during the Indian tour of England in 1959. He was not a particularly good commentator. According to Dickie Rutnagur, when Vizzy had just finished describing how he had hunted tigers, Rohan Kanhai responded: Really? I thought you just left a transistor radio <b>on</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> were commentating and bored them to death.|$|E
500|$|Throughout the story, {{the main}} {{character}} Miranda is often reading Madeleine L'Engle's A Wrinkle in Time, Stead's favorite book as a child; she read and reread it multiple times. She recalls that L'Engle was the only author she met in her childhood. Stead described the novel as a talisman for Miranda; she included {{it in the first}} draft and planned to remove it, [...] "because you can't just toss A Wrinkle in Time in there casually". Her editor suggested leaving it in if it could be better tied into the story. Stead was aware that she did not want A Wrinkle in Time to have too big an influence <b>on</b> <b>When</b> <b>You</b> Reach Me. Keeping this in mind, she reread A Wrinkle in Time through the perspective of different characters, which enabled her to develop new connections and ideas in her own work.|$|E

500|$|On March 30, 2003, {{ten weeks}} before release, an unmastered version of Hail to the Thief {{containing}} unfinished tracks was leaked online. Jonny Greenwood wrote on Radiohead's official forum: [...] "We're kind of pissed off about it, to be honest... Work we've not finished, being released in this sloppy way, ten {{weeks before the}} real version is even available... It's not [...] I'm pissed off about, it's just the situation I guess.

[...] Colin Greenwood said the leak was [...] "like being photographed with one sock <b>on</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> {{get out of bed}} in the morning," [...] but expressed dismay at the cease-and-desist orders sent by label EMI to radio stations and fan sites playing the leaked tracks, saying: [...] "Don't record companies usually pay thousands of dollars to get stations to play their records? Now they're paying money to stations not to play them." ...|$|E
500|$|When Stead {{was only}} halfway done, she hit a wall: she {{wondered}} if she had focused the novel too much on her own personal life and problems. By her 40th birthday in January 2008, she had stopped writing. One week after her birthday celebration, Stead went to a writers' conference where the presenter advised attendees to stop thinking and just write. This speech worked as an antidote to Stead's writer's block; she started working <b>on</b> <b>When</b> <b>You</b> Reach Me again. After she had written two-thirds of the novel, Stead sent the draft to her editor Wendy Lamb at Random House. Perusing the script, Lamb found herself absorbed and wanted to help develop the book. Unlike Stead's debut novel First Light, which Lamb heavily edited, Lamb modified nothing on the first draft of When You Reach Me. Throughout the process, Stead helped Lamb understand the complicated concepts in the book and had drafts read by others to make sure [...] "revision hadn't created any holes or contradictions in the plot".|$|E

I guess his low rent offices, with 15 year old 3/4 machines, archaic computers, this is just some dumb chump trying to get some fame when he has none, so he has to make YouTube lame quality anger rants. This guy just wants attention because he can't get any for the so called movies he makes. Nothing sadder when he had his screening in LA to an over half empty movie house.|$|E

Gaskarth said it was [...] "actually something I can relate to, as there is someone from my past I'm distanced with now and the only at I can revisit that time is in my dreams. It made for a cool song." [...] Gaskarth called [...] "A Daydream Away" [...] the [...] "kind of front porch, snare brushes and acoustic guitar slow jam I always wanted to write." [...] He added the lyrics were [...] "very personal" [...] and said it is a [...] "good song to put <b>on</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> miss somebody and just want to relax." [...] Gaskarth calld [...] "Heroes" [...] the [...] "no-so-find farewell closer" [...] that is also the [...] "most pop-punk song" [...] on the record, in tribute to their roots. He classed it as an ironic song since it mocks the concept of [...] "people idolising bands and all the drama that goes along with that when those bands try to evolve their sound as they grow up." [...] He said it was an [...] "important final song and point to make for this album specifically as we've really taken some risks and stretched ourselves."
