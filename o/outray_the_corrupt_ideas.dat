40|$|This essay proposes an interpretative {{framework}} for the book La rappresentanza politica, which was written in 1971 by José Pedro Galvão de Sousa and has recently been published in Italian with an introduction by Giovanni Turco. Its Author, by holding on the classical doctrine of Natural Law as a theoretical frame, aims to clarify some key political issues in Galvão de Sousa’s thought (human being as individual, society as political community, Rule of Law as Natural Order). In the book, representation is firstly defined in a broad sense, and then its political meaning is analysed in three categories: representation “of power”, “in front of power” and “in power”; it is also remarkably focused on the historical evolution of political mandate – from “imperative” to “free” – because of {{to the rise of}} Modern Thought. The Author underlines the fallacies of the ideological approach derived from Gnosticism, which <b>corrupted</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of Power as founded on – and limited by – the Natural Order. This, nevertheless, made possible the replacement of an organic community by the State and the led to the expectable decline into tyranny of the whole political system...|$|R
40|$|Ethical Naturalism {{attempts}} {{to explain the}} objective normativity effective in human practices by reference to the relation between a living in- dividual and the life-form it exhibits. This explanation falls short {{in the case of}} human beings (1) – not merely because of their essential rationality, but because the idea of normativity implicit in practice is dependent on the form of normativity’s being made explicit (2). I argue that this explicit form of normativity’s force and claim – the law in general – implies a tension between an explicit norm’s claim to absoluteness and the particularity of the situa- tional case it is applied to. This tension may seem to produce an inherent violence <b>corrupting</b> <b>the</b> very <b>idea</b> of objective normativity inherent in the hu- man form of life (3); in fact, it shows that the human form of life is essen- tially political. That the human form of life is essentially political does not contradict the idea of objective normativity – provided that this objectivity is not derived from a conception of “natural goodness”, but rather from the actuality of human practice and its principle, justice (4) ...|$|R

40|$|Image {{inpainting}} is {{a challenging}} problem as {{it needs to}} fill the information of <b>the</b> <b>corrupted</b> regions. Most of the existing inpainting algorithms assume that the positions of <b>the</b> <b>corrupted</b> regions are known. Different from the existing methods that usually make some assumptions on <b>the</b> <b>corrupted</b> regions, we present an efficient blind image inpainting algorithm to directly restore a clear image from a corrupted input. Our algorithm is motivated by the residual learning algorithm which aims to learn the missing infor- mation in corrupted regions. However, directly using exist- ing residual learning algorithms in image restoration does not well solve this problem as little information is available in <b>the</b> <b>corrupted</b> regions. To solve this problem, we introduce an encoder and decoder architecture to capture more useful information and develop a robust loss function to deal with outliers. Our algorithm can predict the missing information in <b>the</b> <b>corrupted</b> regions, thus facilitating the clear image restoration. Both qualitative and quantitative experimental demonstrate that our algorithm can deal with <b>the</b> <b>corrupted</b> regions of arbitrary shapes and performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods.
