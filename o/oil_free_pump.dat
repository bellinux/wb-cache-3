40|$|For {{particle}} free vacuum systems, as e. g. systems containing superconducting cavities to {{be operated}} at high gradients, special care {{needs to be taken}} during pump down and venting. Neither should be particles introduced into the vacuum system, nor should particles already present within the system be moved. A series of measurements to study the movement of particles in long tubes during pump down and venting using an in-situ vacuum particle counter has been performed. Based on these measurements a set-up using flow controllers, diffuser and pressure gauges has been developed to avoid introducing particles into the vacuum system as well as moving existing particles during pump down and venting. This set-up can be operated manually as well as via a control unit. The electronics unit is an in-house development at DESY. It is usually connected to an <b>oil</b> <b>free</b> <b>pump</b> station. This set-up allows automated pump-down and venting of critical vacuum systems in a reliable and reproducible way, being faster than the procedures used so far...|$|E
40|$|To prepare UHV {{components}} both hydrocarbon and particle free a new cleaning {{facility has}} been installed at DESY/Hamburg. Both requirements {{are important for}} accelerators using superconducting accelerating structures of high gradients {{as well as for}} synchrotron radiation beamlines connected to an accelerator using optical components like mirrors for the photon beam transport. The cleaning facility is located inside a clean room which fulfils class 10. 000 and partly class 100 specification†. Following standard UHV-cleaning the final cleaning process consists of a fine degreasing of the components in an ultrasonic bath and rinsing with ultra pure water‡. Thereafter the components are dried using up to 110 º C hot filtered air or nitrogen gas according to clean room class 100 requirements. Vacuum chambers of up to 4. 8 m length can be handled. Small components are cleaned using a lab washer, which is loaded from outside the clean room. A small assembly area equipped with an <b>oil</b> <b>free</b> <b>pump</b> station, leak detector and residual gas analyser completes the facility...|$|E
50|$|Another {{example of}} thin film {{analysis}} is of BaBiKO. This {{type of film}} showed superconductivity {{at one of the}} highest-temperatures for oxide superconductors. Elemental analysis, shown in figure 9, of this film was carried out using heavy ion-ERDA. These elemental constitutes of the polymer film (Bi, K, Mg, O, along with carbon contamination) were detected using an ionization chamber. Other than Potassium, the lighter elements are clearly separated in the matrix. From the matrix, there is evidence of a strong carbon contamination within the film. Some films showed a 1:1 ratio of K to carbon contamination. For this specific film analysis, the source for contamination was traced to an oil diffusion pump and replaced with an <b>oil</b> <b>free</b> <b>pumping</b> system.|$|R
30|$|The {{fact that}} the Martian {{atmosphere}} only contains[*]~[*] 0.03  % water also had to be considered. The large surface area of the chamber’s wall, main doors and multiple electrical/optical feed-throughs could lead to extensive outgassing. The vacuum system comprises an <b>oil</b> <b>free</b> dry-compression diaphragm <b>pump</b> (Pfeiffer PKT 01300) that was powered by a turbo molecular pump (Pieffer TMH 071 P) to reach an initial vacuum of[*]~[*] 10 − 5  mbar. Even when the chamber contained a spectrometer, an optical head, samples and all optical fibres and electrical cables, the pump down time was rapid and H 2 O was quickly and effectively removed from the system {{without the need for}} an additional cold finger (the pressure dropped below 4 × 10 − 5  mbar in 2  hours). In addition, a parallel arrangement of Nafion tubes cleans the CO 2 gas of water. This method of water removal uses a dry helium flow around the permeable Nafion tube to flush the water across the membrane wall [23]. A particle filter of 0.5  mm mesh was mounted on the CO 2 feeding line to prevent deposition of solid particles in the tank.|$|R

40|$|The ERL Vacuum {{systems are}} {{depicted}} in a figure. ERL has eight vacuum volumes with various sets of requirements. A summary of vacuum related requirements {{is provided in}} a table. Five of the eight volumes comprise the electron beamline. They are the 5 -cell Superconducting RF Cavity, Superconducting e-gun, injection, loop and beam dump. Two vacuum regions are the individual cryostats insulating the 5 -cell Superconducting RF Cavity and the Superconducting e-gun structures. The last ERL vacuum volume not shown in the schematic is the laser transport line. The beamline vacuum regions are separated by electropneumatic gate valves. The beam dump is common with loop beamline but is considered a separate volume due to geometry and requirements. Vacuum in the 5 -cell SRF cavity is maintained in the {approx} 10 {sup - 9 } torr range at room temperature by two 20 l/s ion pumps and in the e-gun SRF cavity by one 60 l/s ion pump. Vacuum in the SRF cavities operated at 2 {sup o}K is reduced to low 10 {sup - 11 } torr via cryopumping of the cavity walls. The cathode of the e-gun must be protected from poisoning, which can occur if vacuum adjacent to the e-gun in the injection line exceeds 10 - 11 torr range in the injection warm beamline near the e-gun exit. The vacuum requirements for beam operation in the loop and beam dump are 10 - 9 torr range. The beamlines are evacuated from atmospheric pressure to high vacuum level with a particulate <b>free,</b> <b>oil</b> <b>free</b> turbomolecular <b>pumping</b> cart. 25 l/s shielded ion pumps distributed throughout the beamlines maintain the vacuum requirement. Due to the more demanding vacuum requirement of the injection beamline proximate to the e-gun, a vacuum bakeout of the injection beamline is required. In addition, two 200 l/s diode ion pumps and supplemental pumping provided by titanium sublimation pumps are installed in the injection line just beyond the exit of the e-gun. Due to expected gas load a similar pumping arrangement is planned for the beam dump. The cryostat vacuum thermally insulating the SRF cavities need only reduce the convective heat load such that heat loss is primarily radiation through several layers of multi-layer insulation and conductive end-losses which are contained by 5 {sup o}K thermal transitions. Prior to cool down rough vacuum {approx} 10 {sup - 5 } torr range is established and maintained by a dedicated turbomolecular pump station. Cryopumping by the cold mass and heat shields reduces the insulating vacuum to 10 {sup - 7 } torr range after cool down...|$|R

40|$|CONTEXTUALIZAÇÃO: Estudos demonstram o efeito benéfico da aplicação tópica de ácidos graxos como agentes cicatrizantes. A fração lipídica do Ovis aries apresenta uma ação anti-inflamatória que acelera o processo de cicatrização. O ultrassom aumenta o fluxo sanguíneo bem como a extensibilidade das estruturas de colágeno e tendões. OBJETIVOS: Analisar a ação anti-inflamatória da fração lipídica do Ovis aries associado ao ultrassom terapêutico (UST) pulsado e à fricção em modelo de tendinite induzida. MÉTODOS: Cinquenta ratos Wistar foram distribuídos nos seguintes grupos: controle, gel Ovis aries - uso tópico - UST pulsátil + loção estéril (<b>oil</b> <b>free),</b> UST pulsátil + gel Ovis aries, loção estéril (<b>oil</b> <b>free)</b> - uso tópico. Para induzir a tendinite, utilizou-se uma injeção intratendínea de 10 µL de colagenase no tendão do calcâneo direito. O tratamento consistiu em aplicações diárias de ultrassom, com os seguintes parâmetros: modo pulsado 10 %, frequência de 1 MHz, pulsátil a 10 % com intensidade de 0, 5 W/cm², durante sete ou 14 dias. RESULTADOS: A variação do número de células inflamatórias, para os animais tratados por 14 dias, com relação aos grupos controle, UST + <b>oil</b> <b>free</b> e UST + Ovis aries, apresentou resultados significativos p BACKGROUND: Studies have {{demonstrated}} the beneficial effects of topical application of fatty acids as healing agents. The lipid fraction of Ovis aries have an anti-inflammatory action that accelerates the healing process. Ultrasound increases blood flow and the extensibility of collagen structures and tendons. OBJECTIVES: To assess the anti-inflammatory action of the Ovis aries lipid fraction associated to pulsed therapeutic ultrasound and friction in an induced tendinitis model. METHODS: Fifty Wistar rats were divided into four groups: control that consisted of Ovis aries gel for topical use; pulsed ultrasound plus <b>oil</b> <b>free</b> sterile lotion; pulsed ultrasound plus Ovis aries gel; and <b>oil</b> <b>free</b> sterile lotion for topical use alone. To induce tendinitis a 10 µL intratendinous injection of collagenase was injected into the right Achilles tendon of rats. Treatment consisted of daily applications of ultrasound using the following parameters: 10 % pulsed mode, 10 % pulsed frequency of 1 MHz and intensity of 0. 5 W/cm² for seven or fourteen days. RESULTS: After 7 days of treatment, only the Ovis aries plus ultrasound group showed statistically significant difference {{when compared to the}} control group. The variation in the number of inflammatory cells on animals treated for fourteen days for the control, ultrasound plus <b>oil</b> <b>free,</b> ultrasound plus Ovis aries, Ovis aries plus massage and massage plus <b>oil</b> <b>free</b> groups were statistically significant different, p< 0. 01. It was observed in animals treated for seven days that the ultrasound plus Ovis aries group was statistically significant better than the control group, p< 0. 05. CONCLUSION: It can be concluded that treatment using ultrasound plus Ovis aries is more effective than other treatments as it produces significantly better reduction on the number of inflammatory cells at 7 and 14 days...|$|R

40|$|There is {{a growing}} need for {{compressed}} air <b>free</b> of entrained <b>oil</b> {{to be used in}} industry. In many cases it can be supplied by oil flooded screw compressors with multi stage filtration systems, or by <b>oil</b> <b>free</b> screw compressors. However, if water injected screw compressors can be made to operate reliably, they could be more efficient and therefore cheaper to operate. Unfortunately, to date, such machines have proved to be insufficiently reliable and not cost effective. This paper describes an investigation carried out to determine the current limitations of water injected screw compressor systems and how these could be overcome in the 15 - 315 kW power range and delivery pressures of 6 - 10 bar. Modern rotor profiles and approach to sealing and cooling allow reasonably inexpensive air end design.
