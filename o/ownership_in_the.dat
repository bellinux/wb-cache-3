5|$|MF Dnes {{pointed out}} that despite the steady rise of firearm <b>ownership</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country since {{abolition}} of restrictive Communist legislation after the Velvet Revolution, the number of intentional homicide victims has been steadily falling since its peak in 1994.|$|E
5|$|According to {{explanatory}} {{note to the}} proposal, it aims at utilisation of already existing specific conditions as regards firearms <b>ownership</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Czech Republic (2.75% of adult population having concealed carry license) for security purposes {{as a reaction to}} current threats – especially isolated attacks against soft targets. While there is constitutional right to self-defense, its practical utilization without any weapon is only illusory.|$|E
5|$|Andrew Crosse {{conducted}} {{a series of}} experiments with electricity, including the development of large voltaic piles, at the house during his <b>ownership</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 19th century. The main building of Fyne Court burnt down in 1894. The buildings which survived the fire have been used as offices and a visitor centre by organisations such as the Somerset Wildlife Trust and Quantock Hills AONB Service since it came into the ownership of the National Trust in 1967. It is surrounded by a large country estate of woodland, ponds and meadows. Within the grounds are a folly and boathouse.|$|E

5|$|Buses are an {{important}} part of the Northern transport mix, with bus ridership above the England and Wales average in all three Northern regions. Many of the municipal bus companies were located in Northern England, and the region saw intense competition and bus wars following deregulation in the 1980s and 1990s. Increasing car <b>ownership</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same era caused bus use to decline, although it remains higher than in most areas of the South.|$|E
5|$|However, unlike its neighbors, Argentina became {{capable of}} still having {{relatively}} healthy growth rates during the 1920s, not being as {{affected by the}} worldwide collapse on commodity prices such as Brazil and Chile. Similarly, the gold standard was still in place at a time almost all European countries had abandoned it. Automobile <b>ownership</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country in 1929 was {{the highest in the}} Southern hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|In 1603 James VI of Scotland {{inherited}} {{the kingdom of}} England, uniting the two thrones, and Etal Castle lost its military value and soon passed into private <b>ownership.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 18th century it ceased {{to be used as}} a residence, and the ruins were painted in watercolour by Thomas Girtin in 1797, based upon his visit to the castle in the autumn of 1796.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a preliminary analysis ofthe nature of vehicle <b>ownership</b> <b>in</b> mid-sized cities of Thailand using Khon Kaen City {{as the principal}} study area. Potentially important factors are examined using an econometric method based on the Khon Kaen Daily Travel Survey 2007 (KKDTS 07) database. Models of car and motorcycle <b>ownerships</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> study area are presented. Some differences and similarities between the characteristics of car and motorcycle ownership were found. Recommendations are given for further research leading to a more comprehensive understanding of car and motorcycle <b>ownership</b> <b>in</b> mid-sized cities in Thailand and in Southeast Asia...|$|R

5|$|In 2000, Willis, {{with his}} {{business}} partner Arnold Rifkin, started a motion picture production company called Cheyenne Enterprises. He left the company to be run solely by Rifkin in 2007 after Live Free or Die Hard. He also owns several small businesses in Hailey, Idaho, including The Mint Bar and The Liberty Theater and is a co-founder of Planet Hollywood, with actors Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone. In 2009, Willis signed a contract to become the international face of Belvedere SA's Sobieski Vodka in exchange for 3.3% <b>ownership</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> company.|$|E
5|$|In March 1891, Clayton and C.Wood Daily of Keyser argued {{on behalf}} of the West Virginia Central and Pittsburgh Railway Company in a {{mandamus}} case at the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia brought by a director of the company, W.Irvine Cross. Alex Shaw of Baltimore claimed his right to cumulate his stock <b>ownership</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> company, and elected Cross as a director of the company. On March 24, the court ruled that the company was governed by the cumulative method, and therefore, Cross was entitled to his director seat.|$|E
5|$|Jenner had {{licensed}} {{her previous}} name for Bruce Jenner's Westwood Centers for Nautilus & Aerobics {{in the early}} 1980s to David A. Cirotto, president of other local Nautilus & Aerobics Centers. She had no <b>ownership</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> licensed name centers, which were solely owned by Cirotto. Jenner's company, Bruce Jenner Aviation, sells aircraft supplies to executives and corporations. Jenner was the business development vice president for a staffing industry software application known as JennerNet, {{which was based on}} Lotus Domino technology.|$|E

25|$|Though {{initially}} {{resistant to}} the idea, after negotiations, on May 17, 2013, the Maloof family and Hernreich formally agreed to sell their <b>ownership</b> stake <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Kings (65% of the team, valued at US$535 million) to Ranadivé's ownership group. Part of the $348 million purchase was considered paid with a $30 million non-refundable deposit Chris Hansen had paid to the Maloofs to establish their business relationship, though Hansen has no <b>ownership</b> stake <b>in</b> <b>the</b> team.|$|R
5|$|Minnie Pwerle (also Minnie Purla Utopia was {{a cattle}} station that was {{returned}} to Indigenous <b>ownership</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 1970s. It {{is part of a}} broader region known as the Sandover, containing about 20Indigenous outstations and centred on the Sandover River. Minnie was one of the traditional owners of Utopia station recognised in the 1980 Indigenous land claim made over the property; her particular country was known as Atnwengerrp.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} side of Manhattan, there were a myriad of Hudson River ferries at one point, with boat routes running from New Jersey to twenty {{passenger}} docks in Manhattan. However, the construction of the Holland Tunnel, Lincoln Tunnel, Hudson & Manhattan Railroad, and George Washington Bridge between Manhattan and New Jersey, as well as the growth of car <b>ownership</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States, meant that these ferries were no longer needed by the mid-20th century. As a result, in 1967, the last cross-Hudson ferry (between Hoboken and Battery Park City) ceased operations.|$|E
5|$|Substantial {{alterations}} {{appear to}} have taken place {{during the early years of}} Samuel Egerton's <b>ownership</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mid-18th century. The canopy at the dais end of the Great Hall was destroyed– although part of it can still be seen in the north wall– when a floor was inserted and new rooms were formed with lath and plaster partitions. The east wing of the hall was probably demolished at about the same time, but certainly before 1812, the date of the earliest estate map.|$|E

5|$|The 2010 {{off-season}} proved limited {{activity on}} the Avs' part. Stan Kroenke bought full <b>ownership</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> St. Louis Rams of the NFL in 2010. Since the NFL does not allow its owners to hold majority control of major-league teams in other NFL cities, Kroenke turned over day-to-day control of the Denver Nuggets and Avalanche to his son Josh {{toward the end of}} 2010, and must sell his controlling interest in both teams by 2014.|$|E
5|$|The {{mansion and}} estate remains in private <b>ownership</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 21st century. The Russell family {{undertook}} gradual and ongoing restoration and re-furbishment {{of the mansion}} internally and externally. The roof has been re-slated and some replacement or repair {{has been carried out}} to the stonework, harling and guttering. A large number of rooms are no longer used, particularly on the ground and second floors.|$|E
5|$|Canada's {{economic}} integration with the United States has increased significantly since World War II. The Automotive Products Trade Agreement of 1965 opened Canada's borders {{to trade in}} the automobile manufacturing industry. In the 1970s, concerns over energy self-sufficiency and foreign <b>ownership</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> manufacturing sectors prompted Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau's Liberal government to enact the National Energy Program (NEP) and the Foreign Investment Review Agency (FIRA). In the 1980s, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's Progressive Conservatives abolished the NEP and changed the name of FIRA to Investment Canada, to encourage foreign investment. The Canada– United States Free Trade Agreement (FTA) of 1988 eliminated tariffs between the two countries, while the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) expanded the free-trade zone to include Mexico in 1994.|$|E

5|$|Given that {{firearms}} possession {{was banned}} during German Nazi occupation and then allowed {{only to those}} deemed loyal during the Communist regime, {{the right to be}} armed is seen as one of attributes of liberty in the country. Together with rapid rise of criminality involving illegal firearms following the Velvet Revolution, this led to fast rise in legal firearms <b>ownership</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country in the 1990s. By 2001, some 3% of population possessed firearms licenses. The number of license holders was falling slightly from this point (faster as regards C licenses, while E licenses remained mostly level) until the 2015 EU Gun Ban Proposal, from which point the number of license holders began to rise again (mostly E licenses). The police recorded a tripling of average monthly applications for firearms licenses by the end of 2015 compared to the beginning of that year.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Ullevaal Stadion AS {{bought the}} West Stand, {{including}} the commercial areas. In March 2001, NFF gave Lyn a loan for NOK12.5 million, {{on the condition}} that if it was not paid back within two years, NFF would take over Lyn's <b>ownership</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stadium. This made it possible for Lyn to pay their investment company back the debt for the loan, which had increased to this amount in five years, and to purchase the stadium and secure NFF the right of pre-emption. On 4 July 2002, Lyn and NFF announced that NFF would make a private placement of NOK27 million in Ullevaal Stadion AS {{and at the same time}} terminate Lyn's debt. In exchange, Lyn's ownership was reduced to 15%.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, the Filipino Associated Broadcasting Company leased its airtime to the Malaysian {{broadcaster}} Media Prima (through {{the local}} subsidiary MPB Primedia) similar to an LMA – with MPB Primedia providing entertainment programming, and ABC handling news programming and operations. Soon afterward, ABC and Media Prima were sued by rival media company GMA {{for attempting to}} use the partnership to skirt laws requiring domestic ownership of broadcasters. In response, ABC's media relations head Pat Marcelo-Magbanua reiterated that the subsidiary was a Filipino company which was self-registered and Filipino-run. The concerns became moot in 2010, when Media Prima announced it would divest its <b>ownership</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> network to PLDT's broadcasting subsidiary MediaQuest Holdings.|$|E

25|$|Similarly, English-speaking Asian Americans own {{smartphones}} {{more than}} any other group. They grew from 71% <b>ownership</b> <b>in</b> 2012 to 91% <b>ownership</b> <b>in</b> 2014. <b>The</b> next highest ownership percentage is 66% by Whites. The Pew Research Center believes that two of the major reasons for the amazingly high ownership percentage are high levels of income and high levels of education.|$|R
