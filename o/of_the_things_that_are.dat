25|$|Reason and {{imagination}} rely on similar mental processes. Imagination {{is not only}} found in humans. Aristotle, for example, stated that phantasia (imagination: that which can hold images or phantasmata) and phronein (a type of thinking that can judge and understand in some sense) also exist in some animals. According to him, both {{are related to the}} primary perceptive ability of animals, which gathers the perceptions of different senses and defines the order <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> perceived without distinguishing universals, and without deliberation or logos. But this is not yet reason, because human imagination is different.|$|E

Brown, first {{assistant}} director on The Birds and Marnie, who knew Hitchcock for several years) {{said that her}} husband would not have endorsed The Girls interpretation of events and the film's portrayal of Hitchcock would have saddened him. Gwyneth Hughes interviewed James Brown {{as part of her}} background research for the film, but he died before the film was completed. In October 2012, Nora Brown told The Daily Telegraph that she had written to Hughes expressing her anger. Hughes has said that James H. Brown backed up Hedren's claims of sexual harassment. Tony Lee Moral, author of two books about the making of the Hitchcock films in which Hedren starred, echoed Brown's comments. Writing for Broadcast in December 2012, Moral (who interviewed Jim Brown at length for his 2013 book, The Making of Hitchcock's The Birds) recalled a remark Brown made about Hitchcock. [...] "Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> expressed about [...] are highly over exaggerated. I think Hitch became upset because he thought Tippi wasn't fulfilling the star quality that he thought she had or was looking for." ...|$|E

2500|$|Protagoras is {{credited}} with the philosophy of relativism, which he discusses in his work, Truth (also known as Refutations). Although knowledge of his work is limited, discussion of Protagoras' relativism is based {{on one of his}} most famous statements: [...] "Man is the measure of all things: <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are,</b> that they are, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> not, that they are not." [...] By this, Protagoras meant that each individual is the measure of how things are perceived by that individual. Therefore, things are, or are not, true according to how the individual perceives them. For example, Person X may believe that the weather is cold, whereas Person Y may believe that the weather is hot. According to the philosophy of Protagoras, there is no absolute evaluation of the nature of a temperature because the evaluation will be relative to who is perceiving it. Therefore, to Person X, the weather is cold, whereas to Person Y, the weather is hot. This philosophy implies that there are no absolute [...] "truths". The truth, according to Protagoras, is relative, and differs according to each individual.|$|E
