Comparison of Figure 1 a, 1 b shows that thinner Si membranes are {{more sensitive to the}} surface modifications (a much higher sheet resistance for the oxidized surface, as expected from discussions earlier, and a dramatic drop in sheet resistance with H termination). HF treatment causes about three <b>orders</b> <b>of</b> magnitude <b>drop</b> in the sheet resistance, while VH treatment produces over two <b>orders</b> <b>of</b> magnitude <b>drop,</b> relative to the oxidized NM surface.

These latter bands are usually assigned to the vibrational modes involving boron impurities and its possible complexes that can electrically act as traps for charge carriers.

40|$|AbstractThe {{electrical}} properties of human {{skin in the}} range of the applied voltages between 0. 2 and 60 V are modeled theoretically and measured experimentally. Two parallel electric current pathways are considered: one crossing lipid-corneocyte matrix and the other going through skin appendages. The appendageal ducts are modeled as long tubes with distributed electrical parameters. For both transport systems, equations taking into account the electroporation of lipid lamella in the case the lipid-corneocyte matrix or the walls of the appendageal ducts {{in the case of the}} skin appendages are derived. Numerical solutions of these nonlinear equations are compared with published data and the results of our own experiments. The current-time response of the skin during the application of rectangular pulses of different voltage amplitudes show a profound similarity with the same characteristics in model and plasma membrane electroporation. A comparison of the theory and the experiment shows that a significant (up to three <b>orders</b> <b>of</b> magnitude) <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> skin resistance due to electrotreatment can be explained by electroporation of different substructures of stratum corneum. At relatively low voltages (U 30 V), electroporation of the lipid-corneocyte matrix leads to an additional <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> skin resistance.

40|$|The optical {{absorption}} and electrical conductivity of amorphous B-rich boron nitride (BN sub x) films with N contents varying from 2. 2 to 40. 2 at. % were investigated. The {{density of states}} (DOS) of the films was extracted from the observed {{optical absorption}} spectra. All types of electron transitions from occupied initial states to empty final states were considered, including those between two localized states. Furthermore, a Gaussian-shaped energy band of localized states {{was added to the}} center of the pseudo-gap in order to obtain good fits for most of the spectra. The major conclusions are as follows. (1) The activation energy deduced from the temperature dependence of the electrical conductivity is low compared to the optical band gap, suggesting that hopping of charge carriers near the Fermi level dominates the electrical transport properties of the films. (2) With increasing N content, the hopping distance of charge carriers increases and the spread of the electron wavefunction narrows.
