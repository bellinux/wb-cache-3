5|$|Bass guitarist and lyricist Roger Waters {{conceived}} the album {{as a rock}} opera during Pink Floyd's 1977 In the Flesh Tour, when his frustration with the audience became so acute that he spat on them. Its story, which follows themes <b>of</b> <b>abandonment</b> <b>and</b> personal isolation, explores Pink, a character whom Waters modeled after himself and the band's original leader Syd Barrett. Pink's life begins {{with the loss of}} his father during the Second World War, and continues with abuse from his schoolteachers, an overprotective mother, and the breakdown of his marriage; all contribute to his eventual self-imposed isolation from society, represented by a metaphorical wall. The band, who were then struggling with personal and financial difficulties, supported the idea. The album {{is considered one of the}} most recognisable concept albums.|$|E

25|$|Pre{{historic}} {{and early}} historic occupations of St. Lawrence Island were never permanent, with periods <b>of</b> <b>abandonment</b> <b>and</b> reoccupation depending on resource availability {{and changes in}} weather patterns. Famine was common, as evidenced by Harris lines and enamel hypoplasia in human skeletons. Travel {{to and from the}} mainland was common during calm weather, so the island was used as a hunting base, and occupation sites were re-used periodically rather than permanently occupied.|$|E
25|$|In 1883 {{her father}} died, leaving her a modest {{inheritance}} to live on. She continued taking minor roles at the Folly, but changed her stage name back to Florence Farr {{when she began}} performing at the Gaiety Theatre in May. Her commanding presence and beautiful speaking voice were noted by Shaw. She soon attained modest success on London's West End stages. In 1884 she married fellow actor Edward Emery. It {{turned out to be}} a disastrous marriage, and she chafed under the restrictions expected of a Victorian wife. In 1888, her husband left for an extended tour of America, and they never saw each other again. She eventually obtained a divorce in 1895 on the grounds <b>of</b> <b>abandonment</b> <b>and</b> never remarried.|$|E
25|$|The last {{military}} {{use of the}} Danevirke {{was during}} the Second War of Schleswig in 1864. Due especially to the above-mentioned emotive nationalist symbolism, public opinion in Denmark and the Danish military had expected the coming battle to take place here. After centuries <b>of</b> <b>abandonment</b> <b>and</b> decay, the Danevirke fortifications were partially restored, strengthened, and equipped with artillery installations in 1850 and 1861. In the Second War of Schleswig, there was some early skirmishing {{to the south of}} the Danevirke, but ironically no battle took place here, as the Danish Commander in Chief, General de Meza, withdrew all soldiers to the trenches at Dybbøl, owing to an unexpected threat of being outflanked. The Schlei and the wetlands between the Danevirke and Husum had frozen solid in a hard winter, and the territory immediately south of the Danevirke had been conquered by the advancing German army. This retreat came as a surprise to the Austro-Prussian army, and almost all of the Danish army succeeded in completing the evacuation. It resulted, however, in the abandonment of important pieces of heavy artillery, and it remains a matter of historical debate why the railway to Flensburg was never properly used for the evacuation. News of the retreat came as a great shock to Danish public opinion which had considered the Danevirke to be impregnable, and General deMeza was promptly relieved of his command. The Danevirke has remained in German possession ever since.|$|E

2500|$|In September 2004 Kim Salmon {{formed an}} {{instrumental}} group, Salmon, which included Clare Moore and Michael Stranges on drums; and Dave Graney, Ash Naylor, Penny Ikinger, Matt Walker and Anton Ruddick on guitar. Kim Salmon played guitar and a sampler. The band released an album, Rock Formations, in May 2007 on both CD {{and as a}} limited double LP – only 500 copies were pressed. The {{first half of the}} album is made up of tracks recorded at rehearsal and the second half recorded live at the Metro in Sydney. I-94 Bar's reviewer T J Honeysuckle was impressed by [...] "a crack team of Melbourne based musicians kicking it out, letting it out of their systems, with an air <b>of</b> <b>abandonment</b> <b>and</b> glee permeating each and every track". Fellow reviewer at the website Patrick Emery felt it was [...] "a grab bag of neo-70s riffs, screeching vocals (albeit computer generated) and iconic rock theatrics".|$|E
2500|$|The site {{shows no}} sign of {{deliberate}} destruction. It appears to have been abandoned and its cultic furniture removed, carried away by the priests. Other Ghassulian sites also display signs <b>of</b> <b>abandonment,</b> <b>and</b> the temple may represent the last phase of the Ghassulian settlements. David Ussishkin has suggested that the Nahal Mishmar hoard, discovered [...] south of Ein Gedi in 1961 by Pessah Bar-Adon, was in fact the temple's cult objects. Containing 429 articles, 416 of which are copper objects including maceheads, sceptres and small crowns, the hoard forms [...] "a unique collection of equipment for use in the Ghassulian ritual" [...] and must have been used in a central sanctuary. It may have been hidden in Nahal Mishmar because of some calamity or approaching danger, never to be recovered. Nevertheless, there does not exist a single find to directly link the hoard to the temple at Ein Gedi. Bar-Adon has suggested some fragmentary ruins near the cave where the hoard was found might have been a comparable cultic location and a possible alternate source.|$|E
2500|$|The {{emotional}} and physical aftermath after an affair has been disclosed can be very difficult, and responses can vary between couples. Some studies suggest {{that only a small}} percentage of couples that experience infidelity actually improve their relationship, whereas some studies report couples having surprisingly positive relationship outcomes (Blow & Hartnett, 2005). In terms of negative responses to infidelity, Charney and Parnass (1995) report that after hearing of a partner's infidelity, reactions have included rage and increased aggressiveness, loss of trust, decreased personal and sexual confidence, sadness, depression, damaged self-esteem, fear <b>of</b> <b>abandonment,</b> <b>and</b> a surge of justification to leave their partner (Blow and Hartnett, 2005). [...] A study done by Schneider, Irons, and Corley (1999) reported nearly 60% of the partners cheated on suffered emotional problems and depression following disclosure of the affair. Other negative consequences have included not only damage to the marriage but also relationships with children, parents, friends, and legal consequences (Blow & Hartnett, 2005). [...] A report in 1983 reported that of a sample of 205 divorced individuals, about one half said their marital problems were caused by their spouse's infidelity (Blow & Hartnett, 2005).|$|E

2500|$|The first dude {{ranch in}} Jackson Hole was the JY Ranch, which was {{converted}} from a working ranch. It became {{the property of}} the Rockefeller family when the Rockefellers started acquiring land in Jackson Hole, remaining an inholding [...] as the family gradually donated portions to the Park Service. The final portion of the JY became the Laurance S. Rockefeller Preserve in Grand Teton National Park in 2008. The Bar B C Dude Ranch was the first dude ranch in Jackson Hole to be conceived as a dude ranch from its inception. Established in 1912, it strongly influenced later dude ranch development and had {{a significant role in the}} development of tourism in Jackson Hole. The Bar BC owed much of its success to its co-owner, author Struthers Burt, who had started the JY and who published Diary of a Dude Wrangler in the Saturday Evening Post in 1924. The White Grass Dude Ranch was established in 1913, when George Tucker Bispham, a former Bar B C employee, and Harold Hammond consolidated their adjoining working ranches right at the foot of the Tetons. The White Grass inholding operated as a dude ranch until 1985, when its life estate expired, the longest-active dude ranch in the valley. After a period <b>of</b> <b>abandonment</b> <b>and</b> deterioration, the White Grass was rehabilitated as the Western Center for Historic Preservation in a joint venture between the National Trust for Historic Preservation and the National Park Service. The Double Diamond Dude Ranch was started in 1924 by Joseph Clark and Fran William, initially catering primarily to boys from Eastern families. While most of its buildings were destroyed by a wildfire in 1985, the ranch's 1945 dining hall survives. The area is now known as the Climbers Ranch, used as a base camp for mountain climbers.|$|E
