5|$|Both the Perfect Works and Ultimania {{books have}} focused {{primarily}} on Square and Square Enix's role-playing video game franchises, such as the Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts series; over 45 of the 75 books are for games related to the Final Fantasy series. Sometimes, multiple books have been written per game or revised editions have been published years afterwards. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>books,</b> Final Fantasy IX Ultimania Online, was solely published online {{as part of an}} experiment by Square Enix with online content delivery; another for Final Fantasy XI was planned, but the idea was abandoned as unsuccessful and all subsequent books have been published traditionally. The Ultimania series had sold over 10 million books by July 2007. All <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>books</b> have been released solely in Japanese, but in October 2017 Dark Horse Books announced that they would be publishing English translations of the three-volume 2012 Final Fantasy 25th Memorial Ultimania as Final Fantasy Ultimania Archive, for release starting in June 2018.|$|E

5|$|After {{thirteen}} months, poverty forced Johnson {{to leave}} Oxford {{without taking a}} degree, and he returned to Lichfield. During his last weeks at Oxford, Jorden left Pembroke, and Johnson was given William Adams as a tutor in his place. He enjoyed Adams as a tutor, but by December, Johnson was already a quarter behind in his student fees, and {{he was forced to}} return home. He left behind many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>books</b> that his father had previously lent him, both because he could not afford the expense of transporting all of them and as a symbolic gesture that he hoped to return to the school soon.|$|E

5|$|Barley evidently {{decided that}} it was futile to {{continue}} resisting the Stationers' Company, and on 15 May 1605, he successfully petitioned the Drapers' Company for a transfer to the Stationers' Company. On 25 June 1606, the Stationers' Company admitted him as a member. That same day, the Company's court, which had the authority to resolve disputes between members, negotiated a settlement in a lawsuit Barley had brought against East concerning the copyrights on certain music books. East claimed that since he had lawfully entered the books into the Company's register, the rights of the works belonged to him. Barley disagreed, claiming that the works were his through his partnership with Morley, who had held the royal music patent. The court's compromise settlement recognised the rights of both, stipulating that if East were to print an edition of any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>books</b> in question, he was to acknowledge Barley's name on the imprint, pay Barley 20 shillings, and supply him with six free copies. On the other hand, Barley could not publish any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>books</b> without the consent of East or his wife.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the release}} of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince in 2005, Msgr.

He also stated that his and Amorth's opinions are just that, conflicting personal opinions of priests.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the appeal}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>books</b> among an adult audience, Bloomsbury {{commissioned}} a second line of editions in an 'adult' style.
