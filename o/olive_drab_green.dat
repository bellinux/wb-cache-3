5000|$|Unlike Canadian mailboxes, {{which were}} painted red, U.S. mail {{collection}} boxes were originally painted in red or green. Beginning in 1909, all mail collection boxes were painted {{a dark green}} to avoid confusion with emergency and fire equipment. [...] Dark green gave way to <b>olive</b> <b>drab</b> <b>green</b> after World War I, when the U.S. Army donated a large supply of <b>olive</b> <b>drab</b> <b>green</b> paint to the Post Office. <b>Olive</b> <b>drab</b> <b>green</b> subsequently became the standard color for all U.S. mail collection boxes until 1955. On 4 July 1955, Postmaster General Arthur Summerfield announced that the Post Office would begin painting all mail collection boxes in red, white, and blue to make them easily identifiable. Subsequently, the Post Office began painting mail collection boxes in red and blue, with white lettering. In 1971 the Post Office (now USPS) changed mail collection boxes to the current USPS Dark Blue with contrasting lettering. The coming of the automobile also influenced U.S. mailbox design, and in the late 1930s, an extension chute or [...] "snorkel" [...] to drive-up curbside collection boxes was adopted.|$|E
50|$|Besides American and ARVN forces, Australian and New Zealand {{military}} personnel used tigerstripe uniforms while on advisory duty with the ARVN units. Personnel from the Special Air Services of Australia and New Zealand were the principal wearers of tigerstripe uniforms (and ERDL uniforms) in theater, while regular Australian and New Zealand troops wore the standard-issue <b>olive</b> <b>drab</b> <b>green</b> uniforms.|$|E
5000|$|The ERDL-patterned BDU {{was first}} {{introduced}} to the United States Marine Corps in 1977, as they phased out the <b>Olive</b> <b>Drab</b> <b>Green</b> (OD) uniform. The BDU became the issued uniform for the U.S. Army in September 1981 in the woodland camouflage pattern, to begin replacing the <b>Olive</b> <b>Drab</b> <b>Green</b> (OD) or OG-107 colored fatigues, which had been standard wear since the early 1950s. The change was to better conceal Marines and soldiers effectively in woodland or tropical Areas of Operation with macro shaped patterns, as opposed to OD, which had only a single shade of green. It was based primarily on the woodland colors specifically of northern Europe. It used shades of green, brown, tan, and black, initially printed onto cotton-nylon blend twill cloth, known as the [...] "Temperate Weight" [...] uniform. A newer lightweight [...] "Tropical Weight" [...] BDU uniform was introduced in 1987 with the pattern printed on 100% cotton rip-stop poplin cloth, to better prevent smaller rips from enlarging.|$|E

50|$|The Five-seven ODG (<b>Olive</b> <b>Drab</b> <b>Green)</b> {{model was}} built to the same {{specifications}} as the Five-seven USG model, but it had an olive drab frame finish and black controls, {{as opposed to the}} standard black frame finish and grey controls of the Five-seven USG. Like the USG model, the ODG model was offered with either adjustable sights or low profile fixed sights. Since 2012, the ODG model is no longer listed by FNH USA.|$|E
5000|$|The Sako TRG are {{series of}} sniper rifles {{developed}} by a Finnish firearm manufacturer, SAKO of Riihimäki. The TRG-21 and TRG-22 are designed to fire standard [...]308 Winchester or 7.62×51mm NATO cartridge, while the TRG-41 and TRG-42 are designed to fire the more powerful [...]300 Winchester Magnum and [...]338 Lapua Magnum cartridge and therefore having a standard larger action and barrel.

5000|$|An <b>olive</b> <b>drab</b> <b>green</b> t-shirt, or skivvie shirt, {{without a}} logo is worn {{underneath}} the blouse. Due to the intense heat in Iraq, moisture wicking t-shirts, {{such as those}} produced by Under Armour became very popular. However, due to concerns that the shirts would melt to the skin {{in the event of}} a fire or explosion, they are banned when a Marine is deployed to a combat zone. However, the Marine Corps has worked with Danskin to develop their own moisture wicking shirts under the [...] "Elite Issue" [...] line, ultimately creating and issuing the Flame Resistant Organizational Gear to troops likely to be exposed to combat.|$|E
50|$|Around 1981, a {{prototype}} K5 Blazer {{was used as}} a testbed for a military CUCV vehicle. Between 1983 and 1987, {{what is known as the}} M1009 CUCV was the production militarized version of the civilian K5. The differences are the lack of an air conditioner, an additional leaf spring in the suspension, a hybrid 12/24 V electrical system (described in detail below), blackout headlights, front mounted brush guard, a rifle rack, and special paint jobs. A majority of them are painted <b>olive</b> <b>drab</b> <b>green</b> or in the woodland camouflage pattern, though some vehicles that saw desert use were painted tan. All M1009s, including its derivatives, are powered with the 6.2 L Diesel power plant.|$|E
50|$|Officers {{generally}} wear a {{very dark}} navy blue almost appearing to be black uniform. Officers with the rank of lieutenant and above no longer wear white uniform shirts, as all officers wear a navy blue uniform shirt, and white shirts and dress blouses are reserved for ceremonial occasions. SWAT and Tactical units wear <b>olive</b> <b>drab</b> <b>green</b> uniforms. Name tags are either embroidered or the traditional nameplate. Some officers will wear {{a very dark}} navy blue/black tie, {{but this is not}} a requirement for normal duties. They will also sometimes wear a traditional service cap, with a unique Sillitoe Tartan (explained below). Officers are equipped with O.C. spray (Mace), police radio, duty belt, handcuffs, extra ammunition, service pistol, bulletproof vest, baton, first aid kit, and flashlight.

50|$|Johnson became vice {{president}} at J&J in 1918. Johnson also had an abiding interest in politics, and served a term as the Mayor of Highland Park, New Jersey. He {{was elected president of}} Johnson & Johnson from 1932-1938, and became {{chairman of the board of}} J&J in 1938. Johnson also held a reserve commission in the U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps during the 1930s. At the outbreak of World War II, Johnson's work in identifying products needed by the war effort resulted in the Permacell division of J&J inventing duct tape for sealing ammunition boxes. J&J plant managers simply took their existing cloth medical adhesive tape, added a waterproof plastic layer with a more aggressive adhesive, and produced it in <b>olive</b> <b>drab</b> (OD) <b>green</b> to match the ammunition cans. During the war, J&J would become a major supplier for combat first aid kits and other military supplies. In 1941, Johnson started the Ethicon subsidiary.|$|R
50|$|Five real B-17s were {{rounded up}} for the filming of Memphis Belle, out of eight that were {{airworthy}} during the late 1980s. Two were located in America (N3703G and N17W), two were in France (F-BEEA and F-AZDX The Pink Lady), and one (G-BEDF Sally B) in England. Since the original Memphis Belle was a B-17F model, {{almost all of the}} B-17s used in the film were heavily modified to look like earlier F models, having chin turrets removed, tail gun positions retrofitted with older designs and being painted <b>olive</b> <b>drab</b> <b>green.</b> During filming, two B-17s portrayed the Belle (one was the movie version of the Memphis Belle (N3703G) and the other was Sally B for scenes requiring pyrotechnics such as smoke and sparks indicating machine gun ("hits") while the rest had nose art and squadron markings changed numerous times to make it appear there were more aircraft.|$|E
5000|$|The {{uniform of}} the Iowa State Patrol {{consists}} of a chocolate brown shirt with tan epaulets, tan trousers with a black stripe, and black shoes. The campaign hat that is worn by all Troopers is modeled after the hats worn by Army Drill Sergeants and Marine Corps Drill Instructors, and is chocolate brown. The winter version of the uniform includes a Black 5.11 Tactical winter coat; the standard short sleeve shirt is replaced with a long sleeve wool serge shirt, and a tan wool necktie. The uniforms of the Special Tactical Division are simple BDU style uniforms, in <b>Olive</b> <b>Drab</b> <b>Green</b> (again, the winter uniform is changed to add a parka), with the patches in Olive Drab and black. The badge of the State Patrol has changed {{many times over the}} years, but the current badge is a simple shield surmounted by an eagle design, with red enameled ribbons. The badges are gold plated for all ranks. In the center of the badge, the state seal is prominent, and for all ranks below Sergeant, the upper badge ribbon simply reads [...] "Trooper," [...] or [...] "Officer," [...] if they are assigned to the Capitol Police Division. Rank devices for Sergeants are sewn onto the sleeves, and all ranks Sergeant and above wear pinned collar insignia. In inclement weather, the Troopers are usually equipped with full rain gear, including rubber pants, and knee length rain slickers, and, on cool nights, when the 5.11 winter coat would be too much, an optional light weight 5.11 Spring Jacket is available.|$|E
5000|$|After World War II, Barclay's {{headquarters}} were {{relocated to}} Union City, New Jersey. Despite the inroads of plastic toy soldiers, Barclay kept manufacturing theirs in metal. Following the war, Barclay changed the helmets on their soldiers to the M1 Helmet. In about 1951 Barclay conserved metal by eliminating bases on their soldiers, which collectors nicknamed podfoot soldiers because each foot {{appeared as a}} flattened rounded blob (Johnson 1982, 104-106). These were painted similar to figures in American comic books of the time - <b>olive</b> <b>drab</b> uniforms with <b>green</b> helmets with [...] "enemy" [...] soldiers in red uniforms with white helmets. With {{the rising cost of}} metal, the soldiers had risen in price to 15 cents.|$|R
