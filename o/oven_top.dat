5000|$|What Tunisians {{refer to}} as a [...] "tajine" [...] is very {{different}} from the Moroccan dish. Tunisian tajine is more like an Italian frittata or an eggah. First, a simple ragout is prepared, of meat cut into very small pieces, cooked with onions and spices, such as a blend of dried rosebuds and ground cinnamon known as baharat or a robust combination of ground coriander and caraway seeds; this is called tabil. Then something starchy is added to thicken the juices. Common thickeners include cannellini beans, chickpeas, breadcrumbs or cubed potatoes. When the meat is tender, it is combined with the ingredients which have been chosen to be the dominant flavouring. Examples include fresh parsley, dried mint, saffron, sun-dried tomatoes, cooked vegetables and stewed calves' brains. Next, the stew is enriched with cheese and eggs. Finally, this egg and stew is baked in a deep pie dish, either on the stove or in the <b>oven</b> until <b>top</b> and bottom are crisply cooked and the eggs are just set. When the tajine is ready, it is turned out onto a plate and sliced into squares, accompanied by wedges of lemon. Tunisian tajines can also be made with seafood or as a completely vegetarian dish.|$|R

40|$|Baking is {{obviously}} {{one of the}} most important stages of bread production. Baking time and oven temperature have greatest effects on bread quality. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of baking time and temperature on bread quality and its shelf life. In this study, the effect of three rates of <b>oven</b> temperature (<b>top</b> and under bread surface) and baking time levels on bread quality and its shelf life was investigated. Baking temperature and time were 300 and 280 °C for 3 minutes and 20 seconds, 300 and 350 °C for 2 minutes and 30 seconds and 350 and 380  °C for 2 minutes respectively. Soluble starch and staling factors of the samples were measured. The data was statistically analyzed by complete randomized design and comparison was made between the means via Duncan,s multiple range test at 5 % level. The results showed that the bread baked in various time–temperature conditions were different in moisture content. The bread baked at lower temperature and longer time had the lowest moisture. Also, the result showed that the amount of soluble starch increased by increasing the baking time and decreasing the baking temperature. The bread baked in various baking conditions showed significant differences in staling rates. Lower baking time and higher baking temperature caused the lowest bread staling rates...|$|R
40|$|Coke oven {{battery is}} complex and {{multifaceted}} facility in terms of air pollutant emissions. As far as stack or quenching tower does not cause major difficulties of emission measurement, the fugitive emission measurement from sources such as battery top elements (charging holes, ascension pipes) or oven doors is still complicated and not fully solved problem. This article presents the discussion concerning main problems and errors likely {{to be made in}} particular stages of procedure of fugitive emissions characterization from coke oven battery (selection of sampling points, sampling itself, measurement of air velocity over battery top and laboratory analyses). In addition, results of concentrations measurements of selected substances characteristic for the coking process (naphthalene, anthracene, 4 PAHs and TSP) originating from fugitive sources of coke oven battery and subjected to reporting under the E-PRTR are presented. The measurements were carried out on coke <b>oven</b> battery <b>top</b> in points {{selected on the basis of}} the preceding detailed air convection velocity measurements over battery top. Results of the velocity measurements were compared with results of numerical modelling using CFD software. The presented material is an attempt to cross-sectional presentation of issues related to the quantitative evaluation of fugitive emission from coke oven battery, discussed on the example of PAHs emission as a group of substances characteristic for coking of coal...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Combustion {{of biomass}} in {{small-scale}} furnaces {{is widely used}} in many countries and in different applications. Often, the technology used is fixed grate combustion in small batch furnaces. The efficiency of such furnace is often low which results in a high environmental impact due to the poorly controlled combustion of the wood logs that are largely used as the heat source for baking bread in wood-fired bakery ovens. This work has been undertaken {{in order to develop}} an efficient and environment friendly bakery oven furnace fired by biomass. The work was performed in Mozambique, and a survey was used to evaluate the consumption of wood and the technology used in the process of bread baking in two selected townships. The data collected from the 104 bakeries consisted of the dimensions of the oven, the temperature profiles within the combustion chamber and baking oven and, finally, the baking time. The circulation of hot gases within the baking oven was used to describe and predict the behaviour of the heat exchange {{and the quality of the}} products produced. Bi-dimensional cold flow equipment and a CFD model were used in conjunction to estimate the flow pattern inside the oven, which is one of the key factors in determining the baking efficiency of such ovens. Experiments were conducted in a physical model; various velocities were used to simulate changes in the air flow within the combustion chamber of the bakery ovens. Mathematical modelling was used to describe the flow using a standard k-ω model, which took the effects of the feeding door into account. As much as 60 tons/day of green wood are consumed in the bread baking process in the investigated area. The bread baking process in a semi-direct bakery oven occurs when contact is made between the bread/dough and the flue gases as they exit the combustion chamber. The relationship between the mass of firewood consumed and mass of wheat processed (specific consumption) was found to be 0. 55 in indirect ovens and 0. 90 in semi-direct. The temperature profile in a semi-direct oven beyond the inlet airflow is affected negatively by the feeding door, an effect that is magnified with manual feeding of the dough causing lack of uniformity on the quality of the bread produced. Surrounding air rushes in via the bottom edge of the feeding door when it is opened, whilst hot gases exit rapidly, flowing <b>oven</b> the <b>top</b> edge of the door, and thus affects the overall heat transfer by changing the effective thermal conductivity. Urgent improvement to this system is recommended not only to minimize this phenomenon but also to improve the efficiency of such ovens and the quality of the bread produced therein. Comparisons made between the flow pattern achieved by the bi-dimensional cold flow model and the CFD model show acceptable agreement. The flow pattern inside the baking oven varies with variations in the hot gases leaving the combustion chamber. The increment in velocity directly improves the baking conditions in the temperature range desired by increasing the circulation and effective thermal conductivity of the hot gases within the baking oven...|$|R
