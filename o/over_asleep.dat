60|$|The Doctor was at {{work over}} his manuscripts {{in one corner of}} the little dining-room, and his wife was <b>asleep</b> <b>over</b> the fire in another, when the {{messenger}} arrived.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ain't it sleepy, George, eh? There's the butcher's dog <b>over</b> there, <b>asleep</b> in the road-half an {{hour from}} midday! If the last Trump sounded I don't believe it would wake. Nobody would wake! The chaps {{up there in the}} churchyard--they'd just turn over and say: 'Naar--you don't catch us, you don't! See?'.... Well, you'll find the stocks just round that corner." ...|$|R

6000|$|Such, in brief, is the story, {{the great}} epic of a Puritan's {{individual}} {{experience in a}} rough world, just as Paradise Lost was the epic of mankind as dreamed by the great Puritan who had [...] "fallen <b>asleep</b> <b>over</b> his Bible." ...|$|R
60|$|After {{some time}} the diver rose {{up out of}} the water, and clung panting to the ladder with a pearl in his right hand. The negroes seized it from him, and thrust him back. The slaves fell <b>asleep</b> <b>over</b> their oars.|$|R
60|$|Elspeth {{thought it}} very nice of Grizel {{to defend the}} despised in this way (even Elspeth had fallen <b>asleep</b> <b>over</b> the {{political}} paper). She did not understand that Grizel loved them because they showed Tommy trying to do without his wings.|$|R
60|$|When she {{returned}}, Robert Monteith sat <b>asleep</b> <b>over</b> {{his paper}} in his easy-chair. It was his wont {{at night when}} he returned from business. Frida cast one contemptuous glance as she passed at his burly, unintelligent form, and went up to her bedroom.|$|R
25|$|Sleeping Bear Dunes in Michigan {{is named}} after a Native American legend, where a female bear and her cub swam across Lake Michigan. Exhausted from their journey, the bears rested on the {{shoreline}} and fell sound <b>asleep.</b> <b>Over</b> the years, the sand covered them up, creating a huge sand dune.|$|R

"I got up ever so long ago," [...] he replied, [...] "and as {{the captain}} is <b>asleep</b> <b>over</b> there, {{and there was}} nobody to talk to, I thought I would go {{and try to find}} the back of his head"--pointing to the stone face above them.

60|$|He {{lay awake}} {{for a few}} minutes, and then, well {{satisfied}} with the dayâ€™s proceedings, turned <b>over</b> and fell <b>asleep.</b> He was pleased to discover, when he awoke, that the slight roll {{of the night before}} had disappeared, and that there was hardly any motion on the schooner. The passenger herself was already at the breakfast-table.|$|R

6000|$|These {{words of}} Joe were {{to her as}} if he were {{speaking}} to her again. She laid them on her knee, murmured them over fondly, looked at them, and finally, for she was weak still and had had a bad night, fell fast <b>asleep</b> <b>over</b> them, and only wakened, as shouts of [...] "Mother" [...] were heard over the house.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hugh!" [...] exclaimed the chief, in {{admiration of}} a scene so unusual even to him, for {{this was the first}} lake he had ever beheld. [...] "This is the country of the Manitou! It is too good for Mingos, Hist; but the curs of that tribe are howling in packs through the woods. They think that the Delawares are <b>asleep,</b> <b>over</b> the mountains." ...|$|R
60|$|Winton, who {{had been}} hunting on Saturday, had {{returned}} to town on Sunday by the evening tram, and gone straight to his club for some supper.

500|$|At about 02:30 on April 5, Kennedy {{discovered}} Walinsky <b>asleep</b> <b>over</b> his typewriter and Greenfield {{passed out}} on his bed.

60|$|He left her, {{and having}} made herself {{comfortable}} {{on one of}} the sofas, she lay watching the tall shadow pass and repass door and window, as Karl marched up and down the platform, with the tireless tramp of a sentinel on duty. A pleasant sense of security stole over her, and with a smile at Amy's enjoyment of the adventure when it was <b>over,</b> Helen fell <b>asleep.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] said Sammy Jay, [...] "my cousin, Blacky the Crow, found Hooty the Owl <b>asleep</b> <b>over</b> there, {{and now he}} and his {{aunts and}} his uncles and his cousins are having no end of fun with him.

5000|$|... "I {{remember}} the first session so clearly. Robin and I were in the studios at 9'o'clock in the morning, and Robin kept on falling <b>asleep</b> <b>over</b> the piano. I wanted him to write the piano part of the song and play it because I'm {{not much of a}} pianist, but he just couldn't keep his eyes open, so I ended up doing it myself".|$|R
6000|$|But {{by and by}} Tom {{raised a}} whoop, and there she was! A lake, wide and shiny, with pa'm-trees leaning <b>over</b> it <b>asleep,</b> and their shadders in the water just as soft and {{delicate}} as ever you see. I never see anything look so good. It was a long ways off, but that warn't anything to us; we just slapped on a hundred-mile gait, and calculated {{to be there in}} seven minutes; but she stayed the same old distance away, all the time; we couldn't seem to gain on her; yes, sir, just as far, and shiny, and like a dream; but we couldn't get no nearer; and at last, all of a sudden, she was gone! ...|$|R
60|$|At {{ten o'clock}} P. M. Felicia, the maid, {{left by the}} {{basement}} door with the policeman to get a raspberry phosphate around the corner. She detested the policeman and objected earnestly to the arrangement. She pointed out, not unreasonably, {{that she might have}} been allowed to fall <b>asleep</b> <b>over</b> one of St. George Rathbone's novels on the third floor, but she was overruled. Raspberries and cops were not created for nothing.|$|R
50|$|Rufus {{wakes up}} from a {{nightmare}} to find himself tied {{up in a small}} recess {{on the side of a}} mountain inhabited by Troglodytes. Down below, he spots a polluted stream and jumps down to drink from it; wounded, he falls <b>asleep.</b> <b>Over</b> the next few days, he recovers and, seeing the City of the Immortals in the distance, is able to walk there, followed by a Troglodyte.|$|R
6000|$|The young officer laughed again. [...] "I daresay I can {{enlighten}} you. In {{the middle}} of the last act one of the wings collapsed, and everybody saw a big Englishman, who had apparently just kicked it <b>over,</b> sitting, half <b>asleep,</b> in a folding chair. He didn't appear to have any legitimate connection with the drama, but he brought the house down when he got up in a hurry and fell over his chair." ...|$|R
6000|$|The [...] "dear little ship" [...] {{presented}} a horrid picture of confusion, and its occupants of weariness and ill-humour. From the cabin the cook was storing tins into the lazarette, {{and the four}} hands, sweaty and sullen, were passing them {{from one to another}} from the waist. Johnson was three parts <b>asleep</b> <b>over</b> the table; and in his bunk, in his own cabin, the captain sourly chewed and puffed at a cigar.|$|R
5000|$|After calling an {{undertaker}} {{who takes}} the body of Claire's mother away, Jay insists on staying the night to [...] "take care" [...] of Claire, promising {{to sleep on the}} couch.

60|$|There {{has been}} only one child in the Smallweed family for several generations. Little old men and women there have been, but no child, until Mr. Smallweed's grandmother, now living, became weak in her intellect and fell (for the first time) into a childish state.

6000|$|Lamartine has {{described}} Paradise Lost as {{the dream of}} a Puritan fallen <b>asleep</b> <b>over</b> his Bible, and this suggestive description leads us to the curious fact that it is the dream, not the theology or the descriptions of Bible scenes, that chiefly interests us. Thus Milton describes the separation of earth and water, and there is little or nothing added to the simplicity and strength of Genesis; but the sunset which follows is Milton's own dream, and instantly we are transported to a land of beauty and poetry: ...|$|R
60|$|However, {{he knew he}} was recovering, so he rose, and thanking God for his {{recovery}} and for the new hope that was raised in his heart, he went down to the pool and drank deeply of its water. Then he returned, and, sitting down beside his dog, opened the Bible and read long--and, for the first time, earnestly--the story of Christ's love for sinful man. He at last fell <b>asleep</b> <b>over</b> the book, and when he awakened felt so much refreshed in body and mind that he determined to attempt to pursue his journey.|$|R
