5|$|Many prokaryotic {{genes are}} {{organized}} into operons, with multiple protein-coding sequences that are transcribed as a unit. The genes in an <b>operon</b> are transcribed {{as a continuous}} messenger RNA, {{referred to as a}} polycistronic mRNA. The term cistron in this context is equivalent to gene. The transcription of an operon’s mRNA is often controlled by a repressor that can occur in an active or inactive state depending on the presence of certain specific metabolites. When active, the repressor binds to a DNA sequence {{at the beginning of the}} <b>operon,</b> called the operator region, and represses transcription of the operon; when the repressor is inactive transcription of the <b>operon</b> can occur (see e.g. Lac <b>operon).</b> The products of <b>operon</b> genes typically have related functions and are involved in the same regulatory network.|$|E

50|$|Originally, <b>operons</b> {{were thought}} to exist solely in prokaryotes, but since the {{discovery}} of the first <b>operons</b> in eukaryotes in the early 1990s, more evidence has arisen to suggest they are more common than previously assumed.

5|$|Carbon dioxide (CO2), {{adenosine}} monophosphate (AMP) and phosphate groups (PP) are released as waste products. Luciferase catalyzes the reaction, {{which may be}} mediated by cofactors such as calcium (Ca2+) or magnesium (Mg2+) ions, and for some types of luciferin (L) also the energy-carrying molecule adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The reaction can occur either inside or outside the cell. In bacteria such as Aliivibrio, the expression of genes related to bioluminescence {{is controlled by the}} lux <b>operon.</b>|$|E
5|$|Genes are {{regulated}} {{so that they}} are expressed only when the product is needed, since expression draws on limited resources. A cell regulates its gene expression depending on its external environment (e.g. available nutrients, temperature and other stresses), its internal environment (e.g. cell division cycle, metabolism, infection status), and its specific role if in a multicellular organism. Gene expression can be regulated at any step: from transcriptional initiation, to RNA processing, to post-translational modification of the protein. The regulation of lactose metabolism genes in E. coli (lac <b>operon)</b> was the first such mechanism to be described in 1961.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Sharma et al. {{presented}} a comprehensive analysis of transcription at single-nucleotide resolution by differential RNA-seq that confirmed the known acid induction of major virulence loci, {{such as the}} urease (ure) <b>operon</b> or the cag pathogenicity island (see below). More importantly, this study identified a total of 1,907 transcriptional start sites, 337 primary operons, and 126 additional suboperons, and 66 monocistrons. Until 2010, only about 55 transcriptional start sites (TSSs) were known in this species. Notably, 27% of the primary TSSs are also antisense TSSs, indicating that—similar to E. coli—antisense transcription occurs across the entire H. pylori genome. At least one antisense TSS is associated with about 46% of all open reading frames, including many housekeeping genes. Most (about 50%) of the 5' UTRs are 20–40 nucleotides (nt) in length and support the AAGGag motif located about 6 nt (median distance) upstream of start codons as the consensus Shine–Dalgarno sequence in H. pylori.|$|E
40|$|We have {{performed}} a {{statistical analysis of}} the spatial distribution of <b>operons</b> in the transcriptional regulation network of Escherichia coli. The analysis reveals that <b>operons</b> that regulate each other and <b>operons</b> that are coregulated tend to lie {{next to each other}} on the genome. Moreover, these pairs of <b>operons</b> tend to be transcribed in diverging directions. This spatial arrangement of <b>operons</b> allows the upstream regulatory regions to interfere with each other. This affords additional regulatory control, as illustrated by a mean-field analysis of a feed-forward loop. Our results suggest that regulatory control can provide a selection pressure that drives <b>operons</b> together in the course of evolution. Comment: 9 pages, 6 figs (4 colour...|$|R
40|$|In Salmonella typhimurium the {{structural}} genes of the enzymes responsible for histidine utilization (hut) are clustered in two adjacent <b>operons.</b> A single repressor regulates both <b>operons.</b> The repressor {{itself is a}} member of one of the hut <b>operons</b> and, thus, regulates its own synthesis. We have assayed the hut repressor by its ability to bind radioactive DNA to nitrocellulose filters. The binding is specific for DNA bearing the hut <b>operons,</b> and the binding is abolished by the inducer, urocanate. As a member of one of the hut <b>operons,</b> the repressor is inducible, subject to catabolite repression, and affected by a promoter mutation...|$|R
40|$|The {{distinctive}} double Christmas tree morphology of rRNA <b>operons</b> as visualized by {{electron microscopy}} makes them easy to recognize in chromatin spreads from Escherichia coli. On {{the basis of}} the pattern of nascent transcripts on nearby transcription units and the relative distances of the <b>operons</b> from one another and the replication origin, we are now able to specifically identify five of the seven rRNA <b>operons</b> in E. coli. The use of rRNA <b>operons</b> as markers of both position and distance has resulted in the morphological mapping of {{a significant portion of the}} E. coli chromosome; over 600 kilobase pairs in the 84 - to 90 -min and 72 -min regions can now be recognized. Since individual rRNA <b>operons</b> could be identified, direct comparisons could be made of their transcriptional activities. As judged by the densities of RNA polymerases along the <b>operons,</b> rrnA, rrnB, rrnC, rrnD, and rrnE were all transcribed at similar levels, with one RNA polymerase every 85 base pairs. The ability to recognize individual <b>operons</b> and specific regions of the chromosome allows direct comparisons of various genetic parameters...|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to the Division of Biology at Caltech, the Laboratory of Molecular Biology (and its precursors) at Cambridge, {{and a handful of}} other institutions, the Pasteur Institute became a major center for molecular biology research in the late 1950s. Scientists at Cambridge, led by Max Perutz and John Kendrew, focused on the rapidly developing field of structural biology, combining X-ray crystallography with Molecular modelling and the new computational possibilities of digital computing (benefiting both directly and indirectly from the military funding of science). A number of biochemists led by Frederick Sanger later joined the Cambridge lab, bringing together the study of macromolecular structure and function. At the Pasteur Institute, François Jacob and Jacques Monod followed the 1959 PaJaMo experiment with a series of publications regarding the lac <b>operon</b> that established the concept of gene regulation and identified what came to be known as messenger RNA. By the mid-1960s, the intellectual core of molecular biology—a model for the molecular basis of metabolism and reproduction— was largely complete.|$|E
25|$|In {{negative}} inducible operons, {{a regulatory}} repressor protein is normally {{bound to the}} operator, which prevents the transcription of the genes on the <b>operon.</b> If an inducer molecule is present, it binds to the repressor and changes its conformation {{so that it is}} unable to bind to the operator. This allows for expression of the <b>operon.</b> The lac <b>operon</b> is a negatively controlled inducible <b>operon,</b> where the inducer molecule is allolactose.|$|E
25|$|Operons {{are also}} found in viruses such as bacteriophages. For example, T7 phages have two operons. The first <b>operon</b> codes for various products, {{including}} a special T7 RNA polymerase which can bind to and transcribe the second <b>operon.</b> The second <b>operon</b> includes a lysis gene meant to cause the host cell to burst.|$|E
40|$|The NAC (nitrogen {{assimilation}} control) protein from Klebsiella aerogenes is a LysR-like regulator for transcription {{of several}} <b>operons</b> involved in nitrogen metabolism, and couples the transcription of these Σ 70 -dependent <b>operons</b> to regulation by the Σ 54 -dependent NTR system. NAC activates expression of <b>operons</b> (e. g. histidine utilization, hut), allowing use of poor nitrogen sources, and represses expression of <b>operons</b> (e. g. glutamate dehydrogenase, gdh) allowing assimilation of the preferred nitrogen source, ammonium. NAC is both necessary {{and sufficient to}} activate transcription, but {{the expression of the}} nac gene is totally dependent on the central nitrogen regulatory system (NTR) and RNA polymerase carrying the Σ 54 sigma factor (RNAPΣ 54). Nitrogen starvation signals the NTR system to transcribe nac, and NAC activates the transcription of hut, put (pro-line utilization), and urease. NAC does not affect the transcription of RNAP Σ 54 -dependent <b>operons</b> like gInA or nifLA, which respond directly to the NTR system, but activates transcription of RNAPΣ 70 -dependent <b>operons.</b> Thus NAC acts as a bridge between RNAPΣ 70 -dependent <b>operons</b> like hut and the RNAPΣ 54 -dependent NTR system. The activation of <b>operons</b> like hut by NAC in response to nitrogen starvation is at least superficially similar to their activation by CAP-cAMP in response to carbon and energy starvation...|$|R
40|$|We have {{recently}} proposed {{a model for}} the negative feedback control of rRNA and tRNA synthesis in Escherichia coli by products of rRNA <b>operons</b> or their derivatives (e. g., nontranslating ribosomes) (S. Jinks-Robertson, R. L. Gourse, and M. Nomura, Cell 33 : 865 - 876, 1983). In this paper, we examined the following questions. (i) Are the spacer tRNAs carried within rRNA <b>operons</b> the products responsible for the regulation of rRNA and tRNA transcription? (ii) Are tRNAs capable of regulating their own syntheses? We measured tRNA accumulations in cells containing plasmids with intact or defective rRNA <b>operons</b> or with tRNA <b>operons.</b> From the results obtained, we conclude that neither the tRNAs encoded within rRNA <b>operons</b> nor the tRNAs encoded in non-rRNA <b>operons</b> are capable of controlling rRNA or tRNA transcription. Therefore, the products responsible for the initial step leading to rRNA and tRNA regulation are rRNAs (or their derivatives) ...|$|R
40|$|Strains with lac {{fused to}} each of the seven nif <b>operons</b> were {{isolated}} by two different methods. Repressing conditions prevented expression of all nif <b>operons,</b> whereas derepressing conditions led to the expression of all nif <b>operons.</b> No differences in Nif regulation were observed between Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae with the same nif-lac fusions. Most derivatives of nif-lac fusion strains selected on lactose and NH 4 + contained nif operator mutations. Some derivative contained deletions, which establishes that the direction of transcription of all seven nif <b>operons</b> is toward hi...|$|R
25|$|The lac <b>operon</b> of {{the model}} {{bacterium}} Escherichia coli was the first <b>operon</b> to be discovered and provides a typical example of <b>operon</b> function. It consists of three adjacent structural genes, a promoter, a terminator, and an operator. The lac <b>operon</b> is regulated by several factors including the availability of glucose and lactose. It can be activated by allolactose. Lactose binds to the repressor protein and prevents it from repressing gene transcription. This {{is an example of}} the derepressible (from above: negative inducible) model.|$|E
25|$|Control of an <b>operon</b> {{is a type}} of gene {{regulation}} that enables organisms to regulate the expression of various genes depending on environmental conditions. <b>Operon</b> regulation can be either negative or positive by induction or repression.|$|E
25|$|The Ti and Ri {{plasmids}} {{are themselves}} conjugative. Ti and Ri transfer between bacteria uses an independent system (the tra, or transfer, <b>operon)</b> from that for inter-kingdom transfer (the vir, or virulence, <b>operon).</b> Such transfer creates virulent strains from previously avirulent Agrobacteria.|$|E
40|$|As an {{alternative}} to exhaustive mapping, an attempt {{has been made to}} obtain a rough estimate {{of the total number of}} sporulation <b>operons</b> by statistical treatment. Sixteen sporulation mutants taken at random were characterized biochemically and morphologically. The mutations they contained were mapped to determine whether they fell into any one of 23 known <b>operons.</b> From the proportion that do so (10 / 16), it is calculated that the most probable number of sporulation <b>operons</b> is 37 (68 % confidence limits of 31 and 46). If allowance is made for the fact that two of the <b>operons</b> apparently contain mutagenic “hot spots” and the calculation is amended accordingly, the most probable numbers of <b>operons</b> becomes 42 (limits 33 and 59) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} {{mechanism of}} <b>operons</b> remains controversial despite the proposal of many models. Although acquisition of genes from other species, horizontal gene transfer, {{is considered to}} occur, definitive concrete cases have been unavailable. It is desirable to select horizontally transferred genes reliably and examine their relationship to <b>operons.</b> We here developed a method to identify candidates of horizontally transferred genes based on minimization of gene cluster insertions/deletions. To select a benchmark set of positively horizontally transferred genes against which the candidate set can be appraised, we devised another procedure using intergenetic alignments. Comparison with the benchmark set of horizontally transferred genes demonstrated {{the absence of a}} significant number of false positives in the candidates, showing that the method identifies horizontally transferred genes {{with a high degree of}} confidence. Horizontally transferred genes constitute at least 5. 5 % of the genes in Escherichia, Shigella, and Salmonella and ~ 46 % of which originate from other gamma-proteobacteria. Not only informational genes, but also operational genes (those involved in housekeeping) are horizontally transferred less frequently than expected. A gene-cluster analysis of Escherichia coli K- 12 <b>operons</b> revealed that horizontal transfer produced four entire <b>operons</b> and expanded two <b>operons,</b> but deletion of intervening genes accounts for the formation of no <b>operons.</b> We propose that <b>operons</b> generally form by horizontal gene transfer. We further suggest that genes with related essential functions tend to reside in conserved <b>operons,</b> while genes in nonconserved <b>operons</b> generally confer slight advantage to the organisms and frequently undergo horizontal transfer and decay.

40|$|Abstract Background The genome of Mycobacterium {{tuberculosis}} harbors four {{copies of}} a cluster of genes termed mce <b>operons.</b> Despite extensive research that has demonstrated {{the importance of these}} <b>operons</b> on infection outcome, their physiological function remains obscure. Expanding databases of complete microbial genome sequences facilitate a comparative genomic approach that can provide valuable insight into the role of uncharacterized proteins. Results The M. tuberculosis mce loci each include two yrbE and six mce genes, which have homology to ABC transporter permeases and substrate-binding proteins, respectively. <b>Operons</b> with an identical structure were identified in all Mycobacterium species examined, as well as in five other Actinomycetales genera. Some of the Actinomycetales mce <b>operons</b> include an mkl gene, which encodes an ATPase resembling those of ABC uptake transporters. The phylogenetic profile of Mkl orthologs exactly matched that of the Mce and YrbE proteins. Through topology and motif analyses of YrbE homologs, we identified a region within the penultimate cytoplasmic loop that may serve as the site of interaction with the putative cognate Mkl ATPase. Homologs of the exported proteins encoded adjacent to the M. tuberculosis mce <b>operons</b> were detected in a conserved chromosomal location downstream of the majority of Actinomycetales <b>operons.</b> <b>Operons</b> containing linked mkl, yrbE and mce genes, resembling the classic organization of an ABC importer, were found to be common in Gram-negative bacteria and appear to be associated with changes in properties of the cell surface. Conclusion Evidence presented suggests that the mce <b>operons</b> of Actinomycetales species and related <b>operons</b> in Gram-negative bacteria encode a subfamily of ABC uptake transporters with a possible role in remodeling the cell envelope. </p...|$|R

25|$|Not always {{included}} within the <b>operon,</b> but important in its function is a regulatory gene, a constantly expressed gene which codes for repressor proteins. The regulatory gene {{does not need}} to be in, adjacent to, or even near the <b>operon</b> to control it.|$|E
25|$|In {{negative}} repressible operons, transcription of the <b>operon</b> normally takes place. Repressor proteins {{are produced}} by a regulator gene, but {{they are unable to}} bind to the operator in their normal conformation. However, certain molecules called corepressors are bound by the repressor protein, causing a conformational change to the active site. The activated repressor protein binds to the operator and prevents transcription. The trp <b>operon,</b> involved in the synthesis of tryptophan (which itself acts as the corepressor), is a negatively controlled repressible <b>operon.</b>|$|E
50|$|The (tryptophan) {{repressor}} is a 25 kD protein homodimer which regulates transcription of the tryptophan biosynthetic pathway in bacteria. There are 5 <b>operons</b> {{which are}} regulated by trpR: the trpEDCBA, trpR, AroH, AroL, and mtr <b>operons.</b>|$|R
50|$|An example {{can be seen}} in bacteria: Escherichia coli {{has seven}} <b>operons</b> {{encoding}} various Ribosomal RNA. For each of these genes, rDNA sequences are essentially identical among all of the seven <b>operons</b> (sequence divergence of only 0.195%). In a closely related species, Haemophilus influenzae its six ribosomal RNA <b>operons</b> are entirely identical. When the 2 species are compared together however, the sequence divergence of the 16S rRNA gene between them is 5.90%.|$|R

25|$|In genetics, an <b>operon</b> is a {{functioning}} unit of genomic DNA containing {{a cluster of}} genes {{under the control of}} a single promoter. The genes are transcribed together into an mRNA strand and either translated together in the cytoplasm, or undergo trans-splicing to create monocistronic mRNAs that are translated separately, i.e. several strands of mRNA that each encode a single gene product. The result of this is that the genes contained in the <b>operon</b> are either expressed together or not at all. Several genes must be co-transcribed to define an <b>operon.</b>|$|E

25|$|Spot42 can {{interact}} directly with mRNA targets through base pairing. The first Spot 42 target {{was discovered by}} Møller et al. who showed that Spot 42 specifically binds to a short complementary region at the translation initiation region of galK (encodes a galactoinase). galK is the third gene in the galactose <b>operon,</b> which contains four genes (galETKM) and produces a polycistronic mRNA. Spot 42 mediates discoordinate expression of the gal <b>operon</b> (i.e., the individual genes in the <b>operon</b> are not similarly expressed) by binding to the galK Shine-Dalgarno region, thereby blocking ribosome binding and translation of the galK gene. The physiological significance of the coordinate expression is unclear, but suggests that Spot 42 {{plays a role in}} fine-tuning gene expression to optimize the utilization of carbon sources.|$|E
25|$|Clustering {{of genes}} in prokaryotes {{was known for}} a long time. Their genes are grouped in <b>operons,</b> genes within <b>operons</b> share a common {{promoter}} unit. These genes are mostly functionally related. The genome of prokaryotes is relatively very simple and compact. In eukaryotes the genome is huge and only a small amount of it are functionally genes, furthermore the genes are not arranged in <b>operons.</b> Except for nematodes and trypanosomes; although their <b>operons</b> are different from the prokaryotic <b>operons.</b> In eukaryotes each gene has a transcription regulation site of its own. Therefore, genes don’t have to be in close proximity to be co-expressed. Therefore, it was long assumed that eukaryotic genes were randomly distributed across the genome due to the high rate of chromosome rearrangements. But because the complete sequence of genomes became available it became possible to absolutely locate a gene and measure its distance to other genes.|$|R
40|$|Background: In Gram-negative bacteria, type IV pili (TFP) {{have long}} been known to play {{important}} roles in such diverse biological phenomena as surface adhesion, motility, and DNA transfer, with significant consequences for pathogenicity. More recently {{it became apparent that}} Gram-positive bacteria also express type IV pili; however, {{little is known about the}} diversity and abundance of these structures in Gram-positives. Computational tools for automated identification of type IV pilins are not currently available. Results: To assess TFP diversity in Gram-positive bacteria and facilitate pilin identification, we compiled a comprehensive list of putative Gram-positive pilins encoded by <b>operons</b> containing highly conserved pilus biosynthetic genes (pilB, pilC). A surprisingly large number of species were found to contain multiple TFP <b>operons</b> (pil, com and/or tad). The N-terminal sequences of predicted pilins were exploited to develop PilFind, a rule-based algorithm for genome-wide identification of otherwise poorly conserved type IV pilins in any species, regardless of their association with TFP biosynthetic <b>operons</b> ([URL] Using PilFind to scan 53 Gram-positive genomes (encoding. 187, 000 proteins), we identified 286 candidate pilins, including 214 in <b>operons</b> containing TFP biosynthetic genes (TBG+ <b>operons).</b> Although trained on Grampositive pilins, PilFind identified 55 of 58 manually curated Gram-negative pilins in TBG+ <b>operons,</b> as well as 53 additional pilin candidates in <b>operons</b> lacking biosynthetic genes in ten species (. 38, 000 proteins), including 27 of 29 experimentall...|$|R

Most of the tested strains possess 13 <b>operons</b> and the tested psychrotolerant strains contain 14 <b>operons,</b> {{the highest number}} ever found in bacteria. The separate clustering of the tested psychrotolerant strains was confirmed by partial sequencing of several genes distributed over the chromosomes.
