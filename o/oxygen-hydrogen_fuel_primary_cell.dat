40|$|As {{part of the}} Exploration Technology Development Program (ETDP) {{under the}} auspices of the Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (ESMD), NASA is {{developing}} both <b>primary</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> power systems and regenerative fuel cell (RFC) energy storage systems within the fuel cell portion of the Energy Storage Project. This effort is being led by the NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) in partnership with the NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC), Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), NASA Kennedy Space Center (KSC), and industrial partners. The development goals are to improve fuel cell and electrolysis stack electrical performance, reduce system mass, volume, and parasitic power requirements, and increase system life and reliability. A major focus of this effort has been the parallel development of both flow-through and non-flow-through proton exchange membrane (PEM) <b>primary</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> power systems. The plan has been, at the appropriate time, to select a single <b>primary</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> technology for eventual flight hardware development. Ideally, that appropriate time would occur after both technologies have achieved a technology readiness level (TRL) of six, which represents an engineering model fidelity PEM fuel cell system being successfully tested in a relevant environment. Budget constraints in fiscal year 2009 and beyond have prevented NASA from continuing to pursue the parallel development of both <b>primary</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> options. Because very limited data exists for either system, a toplevel, qualitative assessment based on engineering judgement was performed expeditiously to provide guidance for a selection. At that time, the non-flow-through technology was selected for continued development because of potentially major advantages in terms of weight, volume, parasitic power, reliability, and life. This author believes that the advantages are significant enough, and the potential benefits great enough, to offset the higher state of technology readiness of flow-through technology. This paper summarizes the technical considerations which helped form the engineering judgement that led to the final decision...|$|R

Applications studies have emphasized the need for a lighter, cheaper, and more compact high-energy source than the scaling up of current technologies would permit. These requirements could be satisfied by a nuclear reactor power system. The joint NASA/DOD/DOE SP- 100 program is to explore and evaluate this option.

40|$|The {{lunar surface}} {{emergency}} shelter (LSES) {{is designed to}} provide survival-level accommodations for up to four astronauts for a maximum of five days. It would be used by astronauts who were caught out in the open during a large solar event. The habitable section consists of an aluminum pressure shell with an inner diameter of 6 ft. and a length of 12. 2 ft. Access is through a 4 in. thick aluminum airlock door mounted {{at the rear of the}} shelter. Shielding is provided by a 14. 9 in. thick layer of lunar regolith contained within a second, outer aluminum shell. This provides protection against a 200 MeV event, based on a 15 REM maximum dose. The shelter is self-contained with a maximum range of 1000 km. Power is supplied by a <b>primary</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> which occupies 70. 7 cu ft. of the interior volume. Mobility is achieved by towing the shelter behind existing lunar vehicles.

40|$|Background: The {{cellular}} and inflammatory {{responses in}} airway epithelial cells in cystic fibrosis (CF) {{is being investigated}} {{in the study of}} CF pathophysiology. Human rhinovirus (HRV) is an important trigger of exacerbations in cystic fibrosis (CF). Either <b>cell</b> lines or <b>primary</b> <b>cell</b> cultures can be used to study the response of CF epithelial cells in vitro. The use of cell models has an advantage over <b>primary</b> <b>cell</b> models, as <b>primary</b> <b>cells</b> are difficult to obtain. However, uncertainty exists about how accurately the inflammatory response of cell models reflect that of <b>primary</b> <b>cell</b> cultures. Aims: 	 To investigate if cell models have similar cellular and inflammatory responses to HRV compared to <b>primary</b> <b>cells</b> and to determine which of the cell models assessed closely resembles <b>primary</b> <b>cell</b> models. Methods: This investigation compared the cellular and inflammatory responses to HRV in healthy and CF immortalized and telomere shortened epithelial cell models to the responses found in their <b>primary</b> <b>cell</b> counterparts. Cytopathic effect, susceptibility to HRV 1 B, viability, apoptotic response and inflammatory cytokine production (IL- 8 and IL- 6) were determined under basal conditions and after HRV 1 B infection. Results: Similarities were found between the <b>primary</b> <b>cells</b> and cell models when investigating the cytopathic effect (CPE). Furthermore, HRV 1 B had a comparable effect on the viability among the <b>primary</b> <b>cells,</b> NuLi- 1 ’s and CuFi- 1 ’s. However, when the susceptibility to HRV 1 B was compared it showed that except for the BEAS 2 B-s, all of the cell models had a minimal response compared to the <b>primary</b> <b>cells.</b> Furthermore, both the generated CF airway epithelial cell models expressed a lower apoptotic response and appeared to have lower cytokine productions (IL- 8 and IL- 6) in response to HRV 1 B. Conclusion: Generated cell models differ in their cellular and inflammatory responses compared to that of their primary counterparts. Furthermore this study demonstrated that the telomere shortened cell models reflected more truly the cellular and inflammatory response of <b>primary</b> <b>cells</b> to HRV 1 B infection compared to immortalised cell models. ...|$|R
40|$|NASA {{has been}} {{developing}} proton-exchange-membrane (PEM) fuel cell power systems for the past decade, as an upgraded technology to the alkaline fuel cells which presently provide power for the Shuttle Orbiter. All fuel cell power systems consist {{of one or more}} fuel cell stacks in combination with appropriate balance-of-plant hardware. Traditional PEM fuel cells are characterized as flow-through, in which recirculating reactant streams remove product water from the fuel cell stack. NASA recently embarked on the development of non-flow-through fuel cell systems, in which reactants are dead-ended into the fuel cell stack and product water is removed by internal wicks. This simplifies the fuel cell power system by eliminating the need for pumps to provide reactant circulation, and mechanical water separators to remove the product water from the recirculating reactant streams. By eliminating these mechanical components, the resulting fuel cell power system has lower mass, volume, and parasitic power requirements, along with higher reliability and longer life. Four vendors have designed and fabricated non-flow-through fuel cell stacks under NASA funding. One of these vendors is considered the "baseline" vendor, and the remaining three vendors are competing for the "alternate" role. Each has undergone testing of their stack hardware integrated with a NASA balance-of-plant. Future Exploration applications for this hardware include <b>primary</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> for a Lunar Lander and regenerative fuel cells for Surface Systems...|$|R
40|$|Cell {{lines are}} often used in place of <b>primary</b> <b>cells</b> to study {{biological}} processes.

However, MSC- 1 cells lack some of the immune privilege properties associated with <b>primary</b> Sertoli <b>cells,</b> including survival in animals with a fully functional immune system. Therefore, it has to be kept in mind that cell lines do not behave identically with <b>primary</b> <b>cells</b> and should not be used to replace <b>primary</b> <b>cells.</b> In order to strengthen the findings, key control experiments using <b>primary</b> <b>cells</b> should always be performed.

This is particularly true for manned missions, where astronauts {{are able to make}} use of the by-product of the fuel cell reaction, potable water. But fuel cells also offer advantages for unmanned missions, specifically when power requirements exceed several hundred watts and primary batteries are not a viable alternative.

40|$|Cajal bodies (CBs) are nuclear {{structures}} that {{are thought to}} have diverse functions, including small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) biogenesis. The phosphorylation status of coilin, the CB marker protein, might impact CB formation. We hypothesize that <b>primary</b> <b>cells,</b> which lack CBs, contain different phosphoisoforms of coilin compared with that found in transformed cells, which have CBs. Localization, self-association and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) studies on coilin phosphomutants all suggest this modification impacts the function of coilin and may thus contribute towards CB formation. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis demonstrates that coilin is hyperphosphorylated in <b>primary</b> <b>cells</b> compared with transformed cells. mRNA levels of the nuclear phosphatase PPM 1 G are significantly reduced in <b>primary</b> <b>cells</b> and expression of PPM 1 G in <b>primary</b> <b>cells</b> induces CBs.
