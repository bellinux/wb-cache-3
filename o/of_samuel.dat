5|$|The Life <b>of</b> <b>Samuel</b> Johnson or Life <b>of</b> <b>Samuel</b> Johnson, LL. D. {{was written}} by John Hawkins in 1787. It was the first full {{biography}} <b>of</b> <b>Samuel</b> Johnson—with Thomas Tyers's A Biographical Sketch of Dr Samuel Johnson being the first short postmortem biography. Hawkins {{was a friend of}} Johnson, but many in Johnson's circle did not like him. After Johnson's death, Hawkins was approached to produce a biography on Johnson and an edition of his works. His biography described Johnson's life, including previously unknown details about his writing career, but it was plagued by digressions into unrelated topics. Hawkins's Life <b>of</b> <b>Samuel</b> Johnson came under swift attack from critics, from friends of Johnson, and from his literary rival, James Boswell immediately after its publication. Many of the critics attacked Hawkins for his lack of strict focus on Johnson's life or for his unfavourable depiction of Johnson in various circumstances.|$|E
