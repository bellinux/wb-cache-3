40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{we present}} the preconditioned {{generalized}} accelerated overrelaxation (GAOR) method for solving linear systems {{based on a}} class of weighted linear least square problems. Two kinds of preconditioning are proposed, and each one contains three preconditioners. We compare the spectral radii of the iteration matrices of the preconditioned and the <b>original</b> <b>methods.</b> The comparison {{results show that the}} convergence rate of the preconditioned GAOR methods is indeed better than the rate of the <b>original</b> <b>method,</b> whenever the <b>original</b> <b>method</b> is convergent. Finally, a numerical example is presented in order to confirm these theoretical results...|$|R
40|$|In this article, I {{discuss a}} method by Erikson et al. (2005, Proceedings of the National Academy of Science 102 : 9730 – 9733) for decomposing a total effect in a logit model into direct and {{indirect}} effects. Moreover, I extend this method in three ways. First, in the <b>original</b> <b>method</b> the variable through which the indirect effect occurs {{is assumed to be}} normally distributed. In this article, the method is generalized by allowing this variable to have any distribution. Second, the <b>original</b> <b>method</b> did not provide standard errors for the estimates. In this article, the bootstrap is proposed as a method of providing those. Third, I show how to include control variables in this decomposition, which was not allowed in the <b>original</b> <b>method.</b> The <b>original</b> <b>method</b> and these extensions are implemented in the ldecomp command.

The author has compared the quantities of minute urinary proteins by the <b>original</b> <b>method</b> on one hand, and those by the simplified and the test paper methods on the other. The quantities of the urinary protein by the simplified method coincide with those by the <b>original</b> <b>method.</b> Also, the quantities of the urinary protein by the test paper method coincide with those by the <b>original</b> <b>method.</b> The analytical sensitivity of these improved methods was 6 mg/dl of urinary protein.

40|$|International audienceELECTRE TRI {{is a set}} {{of methods}} {{designed}} to sort alternatives evaluated on several criteria into ordered categories. The <b>original</b> <b>method</b> uses limiting profiles. A recently introduced method uses central profiles. We study the relations between these two methods. We do so by investigating if an ordered partition obtained with one method can also be obtained with the other method, after a suitable redefinition of the profiles. We also investigate a number of situations in which the <b>original</b> <b>method</b> using limiting profiles gives results that do not fit well our intuition. This leads us to propose a variant of ELECTRE TRI that uses limiting profiles. We show that this variant may have some advantages over the <b>original</b> <b>method...</b>|$|R
