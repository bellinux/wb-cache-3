40|$|A {{comparison}} of Terylene and cotton <b>overalls</b> {{has been made}} in the lead-acid electric accumulator industry. Six hand pasters wore personal lead-in-air samplers for two weeks. Three of the men wore cotton <b>overalls</b> the first week and Terylene <b>overalls</b> the second; the other three men wore Terylene <b>overalls</b> the first week and cotton <b>overalls</b> the second. The mean lead-in-air concentration in the breathing zone when the men wore Terylene <b>overalls</b> was slightly greater than when they wore cotton <b>overalls</b> but the difference was not statistically significant. Significant differences of lead-in-air concentrations were found between men and between the two weeks but not between days within the weeks. The lead-in-air concentration did not increase during the week. Neither a change to Terylene <b>overalls</b> nor more frequent laundering of <b>overalls</b> should be recommended for pasters in this factory {{on the basis of this}} study...|$|R
