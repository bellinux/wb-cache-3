5|$|Coal balls often {{preserve}} a remarkable {{record of the}} microscopic tissue structure of Carboniferous swamp and mire plants, which would <b>otherwise</b> <b>have</b> been completely destroyed. Their unique preservation of Carboniferous plants makes them valuable to scientists, who cut and peel the coal balls to research the geological past.|$|E
5|$|For this reason, {{direct grant}} schools were {{excluded}} from consideration by the Public Schools Commission set up in 1965, even though 152 of them would <b>otherwise</b> <b>have</b> fallen within its remit.|$|E
5|$|In May 2016, the RAIB {{published}} {{a report on}} the incident, which largely blamed the incident on the train crew tampering with a safety system that would <b>otherwise</b> <b>have</b> safely brought the train to a halt.|$|E

5|$|Metro {{services}} are being extended to important hubs {{in the cities}} that are close to offices, colleges, and tourist spots.

5|$|Aspect weavers take {{instructions}} {{known as}} advice specified {{through the use}} of pointcuts and join points, special segments of code that indicate what methods should be handled by aspect code. The implementation of the aspect then specifies whether the related code should be added before, after, or throughout the related methods. By doing this, aspect weavers improve modularity, keeping code in one place that would <b>otherwise</b> <b>have</b> been interspersed throughout various, unrelated classes.|$|E

5|$|Following the April 2010 {{destruction}} of the Deepwater Horizon while drilling the Macondo well, and the resulting oil spill, all appraisal activities at 33 wells under exploration in the Gulf of Mexico, including Tiber, were placed on hold. At least two rigs that might <b>otherwise</b> <b>have</b> been used for developing Tiber are also in use on the relief wells for the ruptured well.|$|E
5|$|Governments and {{conservation}} groups work to protect birds, either by passing laws that preserve and restore bird habitat or by establishing captive populations for reintroductions. Such projects have produced some successes; one study estimated that conservation efforts saved 16 species of bird that would <b>otherwise</b> <b>have</b> gone extinct between 1994 and 2004, including the California condor and Norfolk parakeet.|$|E
5|$|In the 1630s, {{the texts}} of these annals were {{compiled}} into a single, enormous compendium, known as the Annals of the Four Masters. In the process, the authors sometimes modified the chronology and content {{of some of the}} materials, and is thus chronologically untrustworthy. However, it is recognised that they saved for posterity material that would <b>otherwise</b> <b>have</b> been lost, and the entry contains the longest annalistic account of the battle.|$|E

5|$|One ctenophore, Mnemiopsis, has accidentally been {{introduced}} into the Black Sea, where it is blamed for causing fish stocks to collapse by eating both fish larvae and organisms that would <b>otherwise</b> <b>have</b> fed the fish. The situation was aggravated by other factors, such as over-fishing and long-term environmental changes that promoted {{the growth of the}} Mnemiopsis population. The later accidental introduction of Beroe helped to mitigate the problem, as Beroe preys on other ctenophores.|$|E
5|$|Professor Layton's London Life {{is based}} on another Level-5 title, Fantasy Life. London Life can only be played after {{completing}} the Japanese version of the main game Last Specter, but is accessible {{from the beginning of}} the game in North American and Australian versions of the game. The European versions do not include London Life, because the amount of time it would take to translate the game would <b>otherwise</b> <b>have</b> prevented the game from being released before the end of 2011.|$|E
5|$|The carrot {{gets its}} characteristic, bright orange colour from β-carotene, and lesser amounts of α-carotene, γ-carotene, lutein and zeaxanthin. α- and β-carotenes are partly metabolized into vitamin A, {{providing}} more than 100% of the Daily Value (DV) per 100 g serving of carrots (right table). Carrots {{are also a}} good source of vitamin K (13% DV) and vitamin B6 (11% DV), but <b>otherwise</b> <b>have</b> modest content of other essential nutrients (right table).|$|E

5|$|The {{introduction}} of infrageneric taxa (such as the subgenus, section and series) in the 19th century by botanists including Augustin Pyrame de Candolle allowed {{the retention of}} large genera that would <b>otherwise</b> <b>have</b> become unwieldy. E. J. H. Corner believed that studying large genera might enable greater insights into evolutionary biology, and he concentrated his efforts on large tropical genera such as Ficus.|$|E
5|$|The low {{turnout was}} {{attributed}} {{in part to}} poor voter registry maintenance. The registry allegedly contains up to 900,000 nonexistent voters due to poor database maintenance, especially in updating the registry using death certificates and change of residence records. This allegation {{was supported by the}} 2011 census. The poor voter records were subsequently cited as the cause of the low formal turnout, which would <b>otherwise</b> <b>have</b> exceeded 50%. It was later estimated that the actual turnout in Croatia itself, without the diaspora, was 61%.|$|E
5|$|The {{network of}} lines south of Preston allowed great {{flexibility}} in the routing of trains. A train approaching the town {{on any of the}} lines from the south (except the WLR from Southport) could be routed to enter the station via either the North Union or the East Lancashire line. It was even possible for trains from the north to perform an effective U-turn, a feat sometimes carried out by trains between Scotland and Blackpool that would <b>otherwise</b> <b>have</b> had to reverse.|$|E

5|$|A {{variety of}} artists, musical and <b>otherwise,</b> <b>have</b> collaborated with Stereolab. In 1995 the group {{teamed up with}} {{sculptor}} Charles Long for an interactive art show in New York City, for which Long provided the exhibits and Stereolab the music. They have released tracks by and toured with post-rock band Tortoise, while John McEntire of Tortoise has in turn worked on several Stereolab albums. In the 1990s Stereolab and veteran industrial band Nurse With Wound released two limited-edition records together; both contained Nurse With Wound remixes of original tracks provided by Stereolab.|$|E
5|$|By far {{the largest}} single cost was the {{purchase}} of the ship Terra Nova, for £12,500. Terra Nova had been in Antarctica before, as part of the second Discovery relief operation. Scott wanted to sail her as a Naval vessel under the White Ensign; to enable this, he obtained membership of the Royal Yacht Squadron for the sum of £100. He was thus able to impose Naval discipline on the expedition, and as a registered yacht of the Squadron, Terra Nova became exempt from Board of Trade regulations which might <b>otherwise</b> <b>have</b> deemed her unfit to sail.|$|E
5|$|Francis Penny Burnage, {{son-in-law}} of Charles, became {{chairman of}} Charles Churchill & Co, and Gabriel {{continued to work}} for that company. They moved quickly to add manufacturing capacity to what would <b>otherwise</b> <b>have</b> been just a sales organisation: in December 1934 the company took over Cornelius Redman & Sons, renaming it Churchill-Redman Ltd. The facility was used initially to manufacture American machine tools under licence, rather as the machine tool company had started out in the early 1900s. A particularly notable example of its output was the licence granted in 1937 by Jones & Lamson of Springfield, Vermont, for the Fay automatic lathe. It {{was to become a}} pattern for Gabriel to orchestrate take-overs of other companies but not subsume them: they would have their own management team and retain a separate corporate identity.|$|E
