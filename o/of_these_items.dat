5|$|Archaeological {{excavations}} {{of several}} sites in Tamil Nadu and Kerala have yielded remnants from the Sangam era, such as {{different kinds of}} pottery, pottery with inscriptions, imported ceramic ware, industrial objects, brick structures and spinning whorls. Techniques such as stratigraphy and paleography have helped establish the date <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>items</b> to the Sangam era. The excavated artifacts have provided evidence for existence of different economic activities mentioned in Sangam literature such as agriculture, weaving, smithy, gem cutting, building construction, pearl fishing and painting.|$|E
5|$|Although Wendy's was {{the first}} to have a value menu in 1989, Burger King decided to offer its own value menu in 1998. This menu {{featured}} seven products: the Whopper Jr., a five-piece Chicken Tenders, a bacon cheeseburger, medium-sized French fries, medium soft drink, medium onion rings, and a small milkshake – all priced at 99¢ (USD). In 2002 and 2006, BK revamped its value menu by adding and removing several products such as chili and the Rodeo Cheeseburger. Many <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>items,</b> such as Chili, tacos, the Sourdough burger (a product similar to the Whopper Jr., but with sourdough bread), and Chicken Tender sandwiches have since been discontinued, modified, or relegated to regional menu options.|$|E
5|$|In 1977 Barsbold {{suggested}} that oviraptorids fed on molluscs, but Longrich and colleagues {{rejected the idea}} that they practised shell-crushing altogether, since such animals tend to have teeth with broad crushing surfaces. Instead, the shape of the dentary bones in the lower jaws of oviraptorids suggests they had a sharp-edged beak used for shearing tough food, not for cracking hard food items such as bivalves or eggs. The symphyseal shelf {{at the front of the}} dentary may have given some ability for crushing, but as this was a relatively small area, it was probably not the main function of the jaws. The fact that most oviraptorids have been found in sediments that are interpreted as having been xeric and arid or semi-arid environments also argues against them having been specialised eaters of shellfish and eggs, as it is unlikely there would have been enough <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>items</b> under such conditions to support them.|$|E

5|$|Outside of battle, {{the game}} {{contains}} some strong role-playing video game traditions. For example, Mario's strength {{is determined by}} multiple statistical fields and status-boosting items {{that can be used}} in and outside of combat. The effects <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>items</b> range from healing Mario or his partner to damaging the opponent. Mario can also purchase badges from non-player characters or occasionally obtain them from defeated enemies; when equipped, these badges can permanently enhance a particular skill or aspect, or, in some cases, give Mario new moves, including Power Jump and Quake Hammer. Throughout the game, Mario is permanently assisted by a party member. Each party member has a specialised skill, some of which are required to solve puzzles to advance progression in the game. More party members are gained as the player advances through the game.|$|E
5|$|The {{first half}} of the game is set on a whaler {{in the middle of a}} storm, and the {{conditions}} on the deck affect the degree of control the player has over Hansen. As the ship sways continuously from side to side, aiming is made more difficult, although Hansen can grab onto a ledge to steady himself, if one is available. In some instances, the ship can sway to such a degree that Hansen will slide towards the edge and potentially fall overboard. There are also numerous environmental hazards on the deck which react to the motion of the ship, such as swinging electrical wires and crates hooked up to ropes. If any <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>items</b> hit Hansen, he will lose health. Waves crashing on to the ship's deck can also cause Hansen damage.|$|E
5|$|The turn-based ground combat uses a {{top-down}} 3D perspective. The player controls a {{squad of}} between one and six human soldiers or robotic units as they hunt the aliens on the map and attempt to complete other objectives dependent on the mission. Map layouts are not randomly generated, but enemy placement is. Fog of war hides the aliens and their actions from view until the player's soldiers are in range and have line of sight on them, and enemies normally do not act at all until the squad initially comes within line of sight. Soldiers can carry items and perform special abilities; use <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>items</b> and abilities is controlled through a toolbar on the head-up display (HUD). A few examples of abilities include firing on enemies automatically after they emerge, launching explosives, and healing allies.|$|E

5|$|The combat of {{the game}} borrows {{multiple}} elements from Naughty Dog's Uncharted series, with players having the ability to free-aim Lara's bow and the guns she salvages, engage in close-quarter combat and perform stealth kills. Players can also use Survival Instinct, an ability in which enemies, collectables and objects pivotal to environmental puzzles will be highlighted for players. The game also incorporates RPG elements: as players progress through the game, they earn experience points from performing certain actions and completing in-game challenges linked with hunting, exploring and combat: this enables players' skills and abilities to be upgraded in specific ways, such as giving her more storage capacity for arrows and ammunition. Players can also upgrade and customize weapons using salvage collected across the island. There is also a character progression mechanic in the game: better items, weapons and equipment are gained as players progress, though the appearance of most <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>items</b> is closely linked to events in the story. In addition to the main story, players can complete multiple side quests, explore the island, revisit locations, and search for challenge tombs.|$|E
5|$|Treloar's death {{left the}} AWM {{in a state}} of crisis. Due to his close control over the Memorial, none of its staff knew what his plans had been and it was unclear how to {{continue}} key tasks such as completing the Roll of Honour, classifying and displaying items collected during World War II and managing the Memorial's finances. In addition, two fifths of the AWM's staff positions were vacant as Treloar had chosen to delay filling these vacancies. Jim McGrath, who had been the Memorial's Assistant Director (Administration) since May 1951, became acting director when Treloar was hospitalised and was confirmed in this position on 15May 1952; Bazley had also applied for this job but lost to McGrath despite having Bean's support. Under the direction of Bean, who had been appointed the Chairman of the Memorial's Board in June 1951, McGrath established a committee to develop strategies for both completing and further developing the Memorial. Bean also personally reviewed the Memorial's collection of World War I artefacts during 1952 and 1953, and found that the register <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>items</b> was inadequate and {{it was not possible to}} locate many of them. He attributed this to the movement of the collection between Melbourne, Sydney and Canberra and the changes of directorship during periods in which Treloar was absent.|$|E

30|$|Four item triads {{from the}} PROMIS PF item bank best {{discriminated}} difficulty in four highly relevant fundamental mobility tasks.
