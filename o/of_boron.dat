5|$|The {{structural}} chemistry <b>of</b> <b>boron</b> {{is dominated}} by its small atomic size, and relatively high ionization energy. With only three valence electrons per boron atom, simple covalent bonding cannot fulfil the octet rule. Metallic bonding is the usual result among the heavier congenors <b>of</b> <b>boron</b> but this generally requires low ionization energies. Instead, because of its small size and high ionization energies, the basic structural unit <b>of</b> <b>boron</b> (and nearly all of its allotropes) is the icosahedral B12 cluster. Of the 36 electrons associated with 12 boron atoms, 26 reside in 13 delocalized molecular orbitals; the other 10 electrons are used to form two- and three-centre covalent bonds between icosahedra. The same motif can be seen, as are deltahedral variants or fragments, in metal borides and hydride derivatives, and in some halides.|$|E

5|$|Boranes are {{chemical}} compounds <b>of</b> <b>boron</b> and hydrogen, with the generic formula of BxHy. These compounds {{do not occur}} in nature. Many of the boranes readily oxidise on contact with air, some violently. The parent member BH3 is called borane, but it is known only in the gaseous state, and dimerises to form diborane, B2H6. The larger boranes all consist <b>of</b> <b>boron</b> clusters that are polyhedral, some of which exist as isomers. For example, isomers of B20H26 {{are based on the}} fusion of two 10-atom clusters.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{investigate}} the opto-electronic properties <b>of</b> hexagonal <b>boron</b> nitride grown by high temperature plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy. We combine atomic force microscopy, spectroscopic ellipsometry, and photoluminescence spectroscopy {{in the deep}} ultraviolet to compare the quality <b>of</b> hexagonal <b>boron</b> nitride grown either on sapphire or highly oriented pyrolytic graphite. For both substrates, the emission spectra peak at 235 [*]nm, indicating the high optical quality <b>of</b> hexagonal <b>boron</b> nitride grown by molecular beam epitaxy. The epilayers on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite demonstrate superior performance in the deep ultraviolet (down to 210 [*]nm) compared to those on sapphire.

40|$|The {{presence}} of nonconventional bonding features is an intriguing part <b>of</b> elemental <b>boron.</b> The recent addition <b>of</b> tau <b>boron</b> {{to the family}} <b>of</b> three-dimensional <b>boron</b> allotropes is no exception.

In spite of the structural resemblance to beta <b>boron,</b> the reduction <b>of</b> symmetry from a rhombohedral space group to the orthorhombic one destabilizes the bands and reduces the electronic requirements. This suggests the {{presence of}} the partially occupied boron sites, as seen for a beta boron unit cell, and draws the possibility for the existence of different energetically similar polymorphs. tau boron has a lower binding energy than beta boron...|$|R
