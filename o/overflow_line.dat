One {{of the characteristics of}} multiphase flows with which the operation of process units have to contend is that they often manifest instabilities that have no equivalence in single-phase flow (Bouré et al. 1973). These instabilities result often in the occurrence of undesirable large pressure, flow and/or volume fraction oscillations, which, at best, upset the expected behaviour of the multiphase flow system, resulting in a logical decrease in the reliability and life of the components and, at worst, can lead to serious flow stoppage or structural failure. Although two-phase instabilities have been studied extensively, large gaps of unexplained behaviour still remain due to the complex nature of flow, pressure drop and heat transfer mechanisms and the interactions that occur between the three. There is still substantial work ongoing in the field as these instabilities may be detrimental in the smooth operation, control, mechanical integrity and safety of heat exchangers in a multitude of their industrial applications. This paper sheds light on the experimental studies of transient behaviour at reduced pressures conducted on the thermosyphon research facility at the University of Manchester in the Morton Laboratory. These studies were initiated because literature does not contain many references to this mode of operation and existing design techniques do no adequately cover operation in sub-atmospheric pressures. Thus, the studies meant to establish the operating limits of a full scale replica of an industrial sized natural circulation thermosyphon reboiler comprising 50 vertically-mounted 25 mm OD tubes of 3 m length. Water is used as the process fluid and condensing steam is the heating source. A constant fluid level is maintained {{at the top of the}} tube-sheet using an <b>overflow</b> <b>line.</b> The behaviour in the flow-induced unstable region, the heat-induced unstable region and the stable region have been investigated. This work attempts to identify the lower and upper thresholds of instability at various reduced process pressures. For the conditions investigated, explicit thresholds are determined for the transitions between the stable region and the two unstable regions. Instability is defined based on the magnitude of oscillations observed in continuously monitored flows around the recirculation loop. The experiments revealed that the region of stable operation is very dependent on process pressure and progressively becomes smaller as the vacuum becomes lower. The use of throttling in the heat-induced unstable region to return to stable operation tends to be over a narrow region, outside of which the sole way to regain stability is to lower the heat load. In the region of flow-induced instability, throttling of the fluid at the inlet is useless and actually makes the situation worse. These instabilities are alleviated by increasing the heat load or flooding the reboiler. cs 201...|$|E

30|$|Dispersed mycelial {{growth is}} {{preferred}} for many processes, but increases the viscosity {{of the medium}} and can wrap around impellers, cause blockages and spread into sampling and <b>overflow</b> <b>lines</b> (Prosser and Tough 1991). As a valuable strategy to overcome such obstacles, several authors have reported the use of immobilized mycelium (Papagianni and Mattey 2004; Mizunuma et al. 2007). Alternatively, growing the organism in the pelleted form also removes these problems and facilitates downstream processing by simplifying solid–liquid separation procedures. However, big pellets may often result in the diffusional limitation of oxygen and other nutrients. These limitations can finally induce autolytic processes within the inner part of those pellets. Therefore, the ability to obtain and control a certain pellet size would be a key to increase the mycelium productivity. As an interesting approach in this direction, a low hyphal growth unit length (lHGU) {{has been associated with}} the formation of clumps smaller than those formed at a high lHGU (Bocking et al. 1999). Moreover, although the exact process of pellets formation is not fully understood, the initial step of some pelletization events is suggested to involve conidia aggregation (Prosser and Tough 1991). In this connection, quantitative values of conidia adhesiveness could be valuable information.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The genetic {{algorithm}} (GA) based solution techniques are found suitable for optimization {{because of their}} ability of simultaneous multidimensional search. Many GA-variants have been tried {{in the past to}} solve optimal power flow (OPF), one of the nonlinear problems of electric power system. The issues like convergence speed and accuracy of the optimal solution obtained after number of generations using GA techniques and handling system constraints in OPF are subjects of discussion. The results obtained for GA-Fuzzy OPF on various power systems have shown faster convergence and lesser generation costs as compared to other approaches. This paper presents an enhanced GA-Fuzzy OPF (EGA-OPF) using penalty factors to handle line flow constraints and load bus voltage limits for both normal network and contingency case with congestion. In addition to crossover and mutation rate adaptation scheme that adapts crossover and mutation probabilities for each generation based on fitness values of previous generations, a block swap operator is also incorporated in proposed EGA-OPF. The line flow limits and load bus voltage magnitude limits are handled by incorporating <b>line</b> <b>overflow</b> and load voltage penalty factors respectively in each chromosome fitness function. The effects of different penalty factors settings are also analyzed under contingent state. Keywords—Contingent operation state, Fuzzy rule base, Genetic Algorithms, Optimal Power Flow...|$|R
40|$|The {{scheduling}} problem of an aggregator is an optimization with separable cost functions but with coupling constraints, {{due to the}} total system balance and power flow limits. This problem can be approached by a distributed optimization, e. g. dual decomposition. In a distributed control scheme an aggregator sends out pricing signals (for the next scheduling horizon) to the consumers. Given these pricing signals the consumers perform a local optimization and commit an energy consumption profile for this scheduling horizon. The aggregator uses these consumption profiles to calculate a loadflow and updates the pricing signals based on constraint violation, e. g., <b>line</b> <b>overflows</b> and load mismatches. This process is iterated until a feasible solution is reached, i. e., when all constraints are satisfied. In a price based control, a price is assigned to each crucial global constraint and is used to implicitly enforce this constraint via local optimization problems. The goal of this master thesis {{is to develop a}} distributed control algorithm for demand side management of loads with variable starting times, e. g., dishwashers and washers, and storage units, e. g. the battery of an electric vehicle, with price updates based on an ac load flow.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Combined sewer {{overflows}} (CSOs) {{have been}} recognized as a dangerous pollutant source for receiving water bodies, and CSO treatment is hence very important to promote a sustainable development. Constructed wetlands (CWs) are starting to {{be considered as a}} viable and eco-sustainable technology to treat CSOs (Meyer et al., 2013). However, CSO-CW provides other ecological services beside to water treatment: (i) urban runoff management, (ii) biodiversity increase, (iii) social services (e. g., recreation). Here we have developed a mathematical model of a real case study to highlight the functioning of CSO-CW as also a flood mitigation system, which promotes an urban runoff management from a post-development (high peak, short duration) back again to a pre-development (low peak, high duration) hydrograph influent to the river (Fletcher et al., 2013). METHODS The experimental case study is located in Gorla Maggiore, Italy (46 °N, 9 °E). The CSO-CW is composed of: (i) grid and sedimentation tank as first flush primary treatment; (ii) four French-type vertical subsurface flow (VF) CW beds as secondary stage (3840 m 2) designed to treat the first flush (up to 640 l s- 1); (iii) a free water surface flow (FWS) wetland with multiple roles of tertiary treatment of first flush and also second flush treatment (3174 m 2), biodiversity increasing, recreational area, and hydraulic buffer (with a floodable surface area up to 7200 m 2). The theoretical hydraulic retention time (HRT) is equal to 36 h. A sampling campaign has been done in 2014 in order to characterise temporal variations of CSO quality and quantity and to assess CW removal performances. The data about water quantity (CSO flow rates continuously registered by an automatic sensor with a sampling frequency of 15 minutes) are here used as input of the mathematical model. The mathematical model simulates the unsaturated water flow in VF beds (Richards equation) and the depth of the ponding layer above the VF surface and in the FWS (mass balance equations). In this way, water outflows from each stage of the CW plant are estimated, and the flood mitigation efficiency of the CW is evaluated for different type of CSO events (i. e., single or multiple average CSO events, high return time CSO event). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The model results show the good performance of the CSO-CW as flood mitigation system. The single CSO average event (883 m 3 over 2. 4 hours, with a maximum flow rate of 250 l/s) is satisfactorily laminated: (i) the peak flow is reduced by 95 %; (ii) the outflow duration is 21 times longer than the one of the CSO event; (iii) the CW is able to store 95 % of the influent volume during the CSO event. The CSO-CW exhibits also performs well for CSO mitigation when a sequence of consecutive CSO average events (up to 5, i. e. the maximum number of consecutive CSO events registered) is considered as shown in Figure 1. In this case, the peak flow is reduced by 53 %, the outflow is prolonged 5. 7 times compared to the CSO event duration, and 38 % of the influent volume is stored during the CSO event. Flood mitigation performances remain high also for events with high return time (equal to 10 years - maximum flow rate: 3. 4 m 3 s− 1, volume: 11497 m 3, duration: 4. 8 h), for which the FWS behaves as a buffer system storing 71 % of the influent volume, in addition to the lower (11 %) but not negligible mitigation effect provided by the VF beds. Moreover, the peak flow (86 % reduction) and the outflow duration (27 times longer than the CSO event duration) are satisfactorily improved for such 10 year return time events. Fig. 1. Influent and simulated effluent flow rate from CSO-CW treatment for a sequence of 5 consecutive CSO mean events: influent CSO (gray line), VF outflow (dotted <b>line),</b> VF <b>overflow</b> (dashed <b>line),</b> and FWS outflow (continuous line). CONCLUSIONS The results of this modelling study confirm the potential of CWs to behave as flood mitigation systems providing the additional ecological service of sustainable urban runoff management.

6000|$|... {{and there}} are yet fewer who can find the reason of that sweetness. I have given it to {{some of my friends}} in conversation, and they have allowed the {{criticism}} to be just. But since the evil of false quantities is difficult to be cured in any modern language; since the French and the Italians, as well as we, are yet ignorant what feet are to be used in heroic poetry; since I have not strictly observed those rules myself which I can teach others; since I pretend to no dictatorship among my fellow-poets; since, if I should instruct some of them to make well-running verses, they want genius to give them strength as well as sweetness; and, above all, since your lordship has advised me not to publish that little which I know, I look on your counsel as your command, which I shall observe inviolably till you shall please to revoke it and leave me at liberty to make my thoughts public. In the meantime, that I may arrogate nothing to myself, I must acknowledge that Virgil in Latin and Spenser in English have been my masters. Spenser has also given me the boldness to make use sometimes of his Alexandrine line, which we call, though improperly, the Pindaric, because Mr. Cowley has often employed it in his odes. It adds a certain majesty to the verse when it is used with judgment, and stops the sense from <b>overflowing</b> into another <b>line.</b> Formerly the French, like us and the Italians, had but five feet or ten syllables in their heroic verse; but since Ronsard's time, as I suppose, they found their tongue too weak to support their epic poetry without the addition of another foot. That indeed has given it somewhat of the run and measure of a trimetre, but it runs with more activity than strength. Their language is not strong with sinews, like our English; it has the nimbleness of a greyhound, but not the bulk and body of a mastiff. Our men and our verses overbear them by their weight; and pondere, non numero is the British motto. The French have set up purity for the standard of their language; and a masculine vigour is that of ours. Like their tongue is the genius of their poets, light and trifling in comparison of the English--more proper for sonnets, madrigals, and elegies than heroic poetry. The turn on thoughts and words is their chief talent: but the epic poem is too stately to receive those little ornaments. The painters draw their nymphs in thin and airy habits, but the weight of gold and of embroideries is reserved for queens and goddesses. Virgil is never frequent in those turns, like Ovid, but much more sparing of them in his [...] "AEneis" [...] than in his Pastorals and Georgics.|$|R
6000|$|It is {{certainly}} worth considering whether an expatriated, denationalised race, used for ages to live among antipathetic populations, must not inevitably lack some conditions of nobleness. If they drop that separateness {{which is made}} their reproach, they may be in danger of lapsing into a cosmopolitan indifference equivalent to cynicism, and of missing that inward identification with the nationality immediately around them which might make some amends for their inherited privation. No dispassionate observer can deny this danger. Why, our own countrymen who take to living abroad without purpose or function to keep up their sense of fellowship {{in the affairs of}} their own land are rarely good specimens of moral healthiness; still, the consciousness of having a native country, the birthplace of common memories and habits of mind, existing like a parental hearth quitted but beloved; the dignity of being included in a people which has a part in the comity of nations and the growing federation of the world; that sense of special belonging which is the root of human virtues, both public and private,--all these spiritual links may preserve migratory Englishmen from the worst consequences of their voluntary dispersion. Unquestionably the Jews, having been more than any other race exposed to the adverse moral influences of alienism, must, both in individuals and in groups, have suffered some corresponding moral degradation; but in fact they have escaped with less of abjectness and less of hard hostility towards the nations whose hand has been against them, than could have happened {{in the case of a}} people who had neither their adhesion to a separate religion founded on historic memories, nor their characteristic family affectionateness. Tortured, flogged, spit upon, the corpus vile on which rage or wantonness vented themselves with impunity, their name flung at them as an opprobrium by superstition, hatred, and contempt, they have remained proud of their origin. Does any one call this an evil pride? Perhaps he belongs to that order of man who, while he has a democratic dislike to dukes and earls, wants to make believe that his father was an idle gentleman, when in fact he was an honourable artisan, or who would feel flattered to be taken for other than an Englishman. It is possible to be too arrogant about our blood or our calling, but that arrogance is virtue compared with such mean pretence. The pride which identifies us with a great historic body is a humanising, elevating habit of mind, inspiring sacrifices of individual comfort, gain, or other selfish ambition, for the sake of that ideal whole; and no man swayed by such a sentiment can become completely abject. That a Jew of Smyrna, where a whip is carried by passengers ready to flog off the too officious specimens of his race, can still be proud to say, [...] "I am a Jew," [...] is surely a fact to awaken admiration in a mind capable of understanding what we may call the ideal forces in human history. And again, a varied, impartial observation of the Jews in different countries tends to the impression that they have a predominant kindliness which must have been deeply ingrained in the constitution of their race to have outlasted the ages of persecution and oppression. The concentration of their joys in domestic life has kept up in them the capacity of tenderness: the pity for the fatherless and the widow, the care for the women and the little ones, blent intimately with their religion, is a well of mercy that cannot long or widely be pent up by exclusiveness. And the kindliness of the Jew <b>overflows</b> the <b>line</b> of division between him and the Gentile. On the whole, one of the most remarkable phenomena in the history of this scattered people, made for ages [...] "a scorn and a hissing" [...] is, that after being subjected to this process, which might have been expected to be in every sense deteriorating and vitiating, they have come out of it (in any estimate which allows for numerical proportion) rivalling the nations of all European countries in healthiness and beauty of physique, in practical ability, in scientific and artistic aptitude, and in some forms of ethical value. A significant indication of their natural rank is seen in the fact that at this moment, the leader of the Liberal party in Germany is a Jew, the leader of the Republican party in France is a Jew, and the head of the Conservative ministry in England is a Jew. And here it is that we find the ground for the obvious jealousy which is now stimulating the revived expression of old antipathies. [...] "The Jews," [...] it is felt, [...] "have a dangerous tendency to get the uppermost places not only in commerce but in political life. Their monetary hold on governments is tending to perpetuate in leading Jews a spirit of universal alienism (euphemistically called cosmopolitanism), even where the West has given them a full share in civil and political rights. A people with oriental sunlight in their blood, yet capable of being everywhere acclimatised, they have a force and toughness which enables them to carry off the best prizes; and their wealth is likely to put half the seats in Parliament at their disposal." ...|$|R
