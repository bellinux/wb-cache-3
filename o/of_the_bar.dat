5|$|Although it had {{abandoned}} the cause of Poniatowski's reforms, the Familia did not receive the support it expected from the Russians, who continued to press for the dissidents' rights. Meanwhile, some factions now rallied under the banner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bar</b> Confederation, aimed against the dissidents, Poniatowski and the Russians. After an unsuccessful attempt to find allies in Western Europe (France, England and Austria), Poniatowski and the Familia {{had no choice but}} to rely more heavily on the Russian Empire, which treated Poland as a protectorate. In the War <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bar</b> Confederation (1768–1772), Poniatowski supported the Russian army's repression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bar</b> Confederation. In 1770, the Council <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bar</b> Confederation proclaimed him dethroned. The following year, he was kidnapped by Bar Confederate sympathizers and briefly held prisoner outside of Warsaw, but managed to escape. Faced with the weakness of Poland and continuing chaos, Austria, Russia and Prussia decided to intervene militarily, in exchange for significant territorial concessions from the Commonwealth – a decision they made without consulting Poniatowski or other Polish parties.|$|E
5|$|Gray's Inn and {{the other}} three Inns of Court remain the only bodies legally allowed to call a {{barrister}} to the Bar, allowing him or her to practise in England and Wales. Although the Inn was previously a disciplinary and teaching body, these functions are now shared between the four Inns, with the Bar Standards Board (a division of the General Council <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bar)</b> acting as a disciplinary body and the Inns of Court and Bar Educational Trust providing education. The Inn remains a collegiate self-governing, unincorporated association of its members, providing within its precincts library, dining, residential and office accommodation (chambers), along with a chapel. Members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bar</b> from other Inns may use these facilities to some extent.|$|E

5|$|The regiments <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bar</b> Confederation, whose {{executive}} board {{had been forced}} to leave Austria (which previously supported them) after Austria joined the Prusso-Russian alliance, did not lay down their arms.

In the end, the Bar Confederation was defeated, with its members either fleeing abroad or being deported to Siberia by the Russians.|$|E

5|$|After {{overturning}} a two-goal {{deficit to}} beat Woolwich Arsenal 4–3 {{in a friendly}} at Plumstead, Small Heath took on Aston Villa in their last match of the season, {{the final of the}} Birmingham Charity Cup. Unfortunately for the charities, the weather was poor and the attendance low, but those spectators present saw an exciting game. Wheldon scored first with a fierce shot that entered the net off the goalkeeper and the underside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar,</b> then Bob Chatt equalised from a free kick and Charlie Athersmith outpaced Oliver and his parried shot was forced over the line.

30|$|Four loading schemes {{were used}} in this study, i.e., {{incremental}} tensile (IT) loadings and repeated tensile (RT) loadings as well as cyclic loadings at high stress (CH) and at large strain (CL). The second loading scheme (RT) relates to a splice under service loads with a stress level of generally no more than 60  % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> yield strength <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spliced <b>bars.</b> <b>The</b> third and fourth loading schemes (CH and CL) are of special interest because they involve splices under frequent and rare earthquakes, respectively. Commonly, <b>the</b> stress level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> splices under frequent earthquakes did not exceed <b>the</b> <b>bar’s</b> yield strength. However, for the splices under rare earthquakes, <b>the</b> stress level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> splices generally can go beyond <b>the</b> <b>bar’s</b> yield strength and large plastic strain could occur. As a result, 90  % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar’s</b> yield strength and two to five times <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar’s</b> yield strain in tension were defined as high stress and large strain, respectively, along with reversed loading of up to 33  % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar’s</b> yield strength in compression.|$|R
5|$|Although for a {{few decades}} (since the times of the Silent Sejm) Russia had seen a weak Poland as its own protectorate, Poland had also been devastated by a civil war in which the forces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bar</b> Confederation {{attempted}} to disrupt Russian control over Poland. The recent Koliyivschyna peasant and Cossack uprising in Ukraine also weakened Poland's position. Further, the Russian-supported Polish king, Stanisław August Poniatowski, was seen as both weak and too independent-minded; eventually the Russian court decided that the usefulness of Poland as a protectorate had diminished. The three powers officially justified their actions as a compensation for dealing with a troublesome neighbor and restoring order in Poland through military intervention (the Bar Confederation provided a convenient excuse); in fact all three were interested in territorial gains.|$|E
5|$|At 15:30, Egyptian forces {{captured}} Fort Lahtzanit, {{the first}} fortification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bar</b> Lev Line to fall, {{and by then}} the infantry had been reinforced with 82mm B-10 and 107mm B-11 rifles. At the same time, engineers began operating their water pumps against the sand wall, opening the first passage {{in less than an}} hour, and the Egyptians moved up their bridging units to the canal. By 16:30 eight waves had brought across the canal ten infantry brigades in all five bridgeheads, totaling 23,500 men (around 4,700 at each bridgehead). Each bridgehead was on average six kilometers (3¾ mi) wide and around two kilometers deep. The Egyptians had high-velocity 85mm and 100mm rifled anti-tank guns in action on the east bank by that time.|$|E
