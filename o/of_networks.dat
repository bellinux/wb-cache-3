Conclusions are shown as following: (1) It is feasible to use the capacity <b>of</b> <b>network</b> to measure the connectivity <b>of</b> <b>network.</b> (2) The capacity <b>of</b> <b>network</b> is measured by the critical generating rate Rc at which a continuous phase transition will occur from free state to congestion. (3) The connectivity <b>of</b> <b>network</b> is positively related with C, and the capacity <b>of</b> <b>network</b> shows a linear growth with the increasing of C. Results show that this evaluation of connectivity can better reflect the connectivity <b>of</b> real <b>network,</b> and well meets the research needs <b>of</b> real <b>network...</b>|$|R

5|$|Since Johnston's death, {{his field}} of {{volcanic}} eruption prediction has advanced significantly, and volcanologists are {{now able to}} predict eruptions based on a number of precursors that become apparent between days and months in advance. Geologists can now identify characteristic patterns in seismic waves that indicate particular magmatic activity. In particular, volcanologists have used deep, long-period earthquakes that indicate that magma is rising through the crust. They can also use carbon dioxide emission as a proxy for magma supply rate. Measurements of surface deformation due to magmatic intrusions, like those that were conducted by Johnston and the other USGS scientists at the ColdwaterI and II outposts, have advanced in scale and precision. Ground deformation monitoring networks around volcanoes now consist of InSAR (interferometry), surveys <b>of</b> <b>networks</b> of GPS monuments, microgravity surveys in which scientists measure the change in gravitational potential or acceleration because of the intruding magma and resulting deformation, strain meters, and tiltmeters. Though there is still work to be done, this combination of approaches has greatly improved scientists' abilities to forecast volcanic eruptions.|$|E
