40|$|Abstract: <b>Bank</b> erosion {{consists}} <b>of</b> two processes: basal erosion due to fluvial {{hydraulic force}} and bank failure {{under the influence}} <b>of</b> gravity. Because <b>bank</b> resistance force varies with the degree <b>of</b> saturation <b>of</b> <b>bank</b> material, the probability <b>of</b> <b>bank</b> failure is the probability of the driving force <b>of</b> <b>bank</b> failure being greater than the bank resistance force. The degree <b>of</b> saturation <b>of</b> <b>bank</b> material increases with river stage; therefore, the frequency <b>of</b> <b>bank</b> failure is correlated to the frequency of flooding. Consequently, the rate <b>of</b> <b>bank</b> erosion is due to both basal erosion and bank failure, and bank failure is a probabilistic phenomenon. In this paper, for cohesive bank material experiencing planar bank failure, a deterministic approach was adopted for basal erosion analysis, whereas the probability <b>of</b> <b>bank</b> failure {{was included in the}} analysis <b>of</b> <b>bank</b> failure. A method for calculating the rate <b>of</b> <b>bank</b> erosion was derived that integrates both basal erosion and bank failure processes, and accounts for the effects <b>of</b> hydraulic force, <b>bank</b> geometry, bank material properties, and probability <b>of</b> <b>bank</b> failure...|$|R

5|$|After the {{collapse}} of public enterprises during the late 1980s, privatisation became strongly popular. Menem privatised almost everything the state owned, except for a couple <b>of</b> <b>banks.</b> In terms of service there were indisputable improvements. For example, before the telephone privatisation, {{to get a new}} line it was not unusual to wait more than ten years, and apartments with telephone lines carried a big premium in the market. After privatisation the wait was reduced to less than a week. Productivity increased as investment modernised farms, factories and ports. However, in all cases, there were large outlays of employees. In addition, the process of privatisation was suspected of corruption in many cases. Ultimately, the privatised enterprises became private (rather than public) monopolies. Their tariffs on long-term contracts were raised in line with American inflation, even though prices in Argentina were falling.|$|E
5|$|Banks {{was given}} his first team debut by manager Doug Livingstone, {{at the expense}} of long-serving Ron Powell, in a Third Division game against Colchester United at Saltergate in November 1958. The game ended 2–2, and Banks kept his place against Norwich City in the {{following}} match; {{by the end of the}} 1958–59 season he had missed only three games, those owing to injury. With no goalkeeping coaching to speak <b>of,</b> <b>Banks</b> had to learn from his mistakes on the pitch, and he soon developed into a modern vocal goalkeeper who ordered the players in front of him into a more effective defence. Having just 23 league and three cup appearances to his name, it came as a surprise to Banks when Matt Gillies, manager of First Division club Leicester City, bought him from Chesterfield for £7,000 in July 1959; this also meant a wage increase to £15 a week.|$|E

5|$|The {{silver dollar}} {{had never been}} a popular coin, {{circulating}} little except in the West; it served as a means of monetizing metal and generally sat in bank vaults once struck. The Peace dollar, the last circulating dollar made of silver, was not struck after 1935, and in most years in the quarter century after that, the bullion value of a silver dollar did not exceed 70 cents. In the early 1960s, though, silver prices rose, and the huge stocks of silver dollars in the hands <b>of</b> <b>banks</b> and the government were obtained by the public through the redemption of silver certificates. This caused shortages of silver dollars in the western states where the pieces circulated, and interests there sought the issuance of more dollars.|$|E
5|$|The unmarked {{bills from}} the robbery {{were easy to}} exchange, but the serial numbers of the 500-ruble notes were known to the authorities, making them {{impossible}} to exchange in Russian banks. By the end of 1907, Lenin decided to exchange the remaining 500-ruble notes abroad. Krasin had his forger try to change some of the serial numbers. Two hundred of these notes were transported abroad by Martyn Lyadov (they were sewn into his vest by the wives of Lenin and Bogdanov at Lenin's headquarters in Kuokkala). Lenin's plan was to have various individuals exchange the stolen 500-ruble notes simultaneously at a number <b>of</b> <b>banks</b> throughout Europe. Zhitomirsky heard of the plan and reported it to the Okhrana, who contacted police departments throughout Europe asking them to arrest anyone who tried to cash the notes.|$|E
