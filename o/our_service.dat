500|$|Of greater {{detriment}} to {{the project}} in the long term, Harrison's business manager, Allen Klein, had neglected to register the concerts as UNICEF fundraising benefits before they had taken place. As a result, the American and British tax departments were demanding {{a share of the}} proceeds from the live album and Saul Swimmer's concert film, ignoring Harrison's appeals that an exception be made in the case of this humanitarian disaster. Until India's defeat of Pakistan on 16 December, America continued to supply arms and financial aid to the Pakistani army, led by General Yahya Khan, despite reports of genocide being committed against the Bangladeshis. In reply to a New Yorker's offer to start a petition to make the US Treasury scrap its tax on the Concert for Bangladesh album, Harrison wrote: [...] "Until the [...] become human, we must do <b>our</b> <b>service</b> to others without their help." ...|$|E

2500|$|In January and February 1908, Clarence Bloomfield Moore [...] {{received}} {{permission from}} the then owner Judge William Andrew Henry of Yazoo City to excavate the sites along the Yazoo River and its tributary the Sunflower River in his steamboat, The Gopher. On his excavation Moore recorded eleven sites and partially excavated eight, including Holly Bluff: “with a large force to dig, including May {{who had been in}} <b>our</b> <b>service</b> before, we go directly to work on such mounds”. Moore commented on the physical appearance of the site: “Strewn over the enclosed area, among the mounds and on them…are chert pebbles; fragments of chert; bits of mussel shell; and small parts of earthenware vessels" [...] Most of the earthenware was undecorated, he recorded, and mostly shell tempered with some stone tempering which is common in the Yazoo-Sunflower region. C. B. Moore’s excavations produced various small artifacts including projectile points, a pebble ax of fossilized wood, a chert hammerstone, and a zoomorphic effigy pipe of shell-tempered pottery. [...] He was disappointed, however, in finding nothing of great importance other than two disturbed burials in a mound on the lake front. [...] Moore’s disappointment was evident in his failing to map the site and his statement, “it having become evident to us that our search was inadequately rewarded”.|$|E

The report found that the death could not have been prevented, although his killers had appeared in seven intelligence investigations. In December 2012, Michael Adebowale had discussed killing a soldier on Facebook with a foreign-based extremist known as [...] "Foxtrot". The UK authorities did not have access to the details of the conversation until June 2013, when they were disclosed to GCHQ. The Intelligence and Security Committee stated [...] "Had MI5 had access to this exchange, their investigation into Adebowale would have become a top priority." [...] Facebook said that it did not comment on individual cases, but responded that [...] "Facebook’s policies are clear, we do not allow terrorist content on the site and take steps to prevent people from using <b>our</b> <b>service</b> for these purposes." [...] In an interview with BBC News on 26 November 2014, Richard Barrett, the former Director of Global Counter-terrorism at MI6, said that it was unfair to expect companies to monitor websites for all potentially extremist content. Facebook had blocked seven of Adebowale's accounts prior to the killing, five of which had been flagged for links with extremism. The accounts had been flagged by an automated process, and no person at Facebook had manually checked the accounts.|$|E
