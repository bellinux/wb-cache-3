A small sublabel, Camera Lucida, concentrated on even more limited release runs, offering two CDs and three 7" [...] singles. Releases were catalogued in the <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>appearance</b> and <b>by</b> format. The label also made various mp3s available for download from their catalogue; in the label's early years there was an mp3 singles club as well, with selections ending up on the two Serotonin Ronin compilations the label released on CD.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Cognitive {{function}} evaluation {{entails the}} use of neuropsychological tests, applied exclusively or in sequence. The results of these tests {{may be influenced by}} factors related to the environment, the interviewer or the interviewee. Objectives: We examined the test-retest reliability of some tests of the Brazilian version from the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's disease. Methods: The ELSA-Brasil is a multicentre study of civil servants (35 - 74 years of age) from public institutions across six Brazilian States. The same tests were applied, in different <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>appearance,</b> <b>by</b> the same trained and certified interviewer, with an approximate 20 -day interval, to 160 adults (51 % men, mean age 52 years). The Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) was used to assess the reliability of the measures; and a dispersion graph was used to examine the patterns of agreement between them. Results: We observed higher retest scores in all tests as well as a shorter test completion time for the Trail Making Test B. ICC values for each test were as following: Word List Learning Test (0. 56), Word Recall (0. 50), Word Recognition (0. 35), Phonemic Verbal Fluency Test (VFT, 0. 61), Semantic VFT (0. 53) and Trail B (0. 91). The Bland-Altman plot showed better correlation of executive function (VFT and Trail B) than of memory tests. Conclusions: Better performance in retest may reflect a learning effect, and suggest that retest should be repeated using alternate forms or after longer periods. In this sample of adults with high schooling level, reliability was only moderate for memory tests whereas the measurement of executive function proved more reliable...|$|E
5000|$|The format {{was almost}} always the same. At the {{beginning}} of the show, the talent's <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>appearance</b> was determined <b>by</b> spinning a wheel. After it was announced how many episodes the current one marked (the final broadcast on CBS being the 1,651st), the wheel was spun. As the wheel spun, the words [...] "Round and round she goes, and where she stops nobody knows" [...] were always intoned. (From the late 1950s forward, the wheel was gone: it was symbolized by flute arpeggios as Ted Mack invoked the traditional phrase.) ...|$|R
40|$|Antigenic {{variation}} of African trypanosomes {{results from the}} periodic activation of a single new variant cell surface glycoprotein (VSG) gene out of a repertoire of about a 1000 VSG genes. In spite of the apparently random genetic basis {{of the process of}} antigenic variation, the relapsing parasitemias are characterized by an as yet unexplained <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> major VSG variants. Here we mathematically test hypotheses concerning the blood-based parasitemia. In our model the antigenic switches occur at random at the DNA level. A variable proportion of the switches has a short intermediate phase in which two different VSGs simultaneously occur on the cell surface. We show that, in a theoretical population of 230 single expressor variants in an immunocompetent or in an immunodeficient host, {{it is not possible to}} explain the <b>ordered</b> <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> variants <b>by</b> affecting the growth coefficients of single expressors or double expressors or by affecting the antigen switch probabilities. Rather, a realistic parasitemia can be obtained if the majority of switches has a double expressor switch-intermediate phase and if the double expressors have a differential susceptibility to the immune control. This study is significant in providing a theoretical basis for the <b>ordered</b> <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> variants and in explaining previously unresolved discrepancies between the rate <b>of</b> <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> new variants in culture and in vivo. In addition, testable predictions as to the development of the infections, switch rate of variants, fraction of double expressors, and parasite mortality coefficients are generated...|$|R
40|$|OBJETIVO: verificar o julgamento do desempenho de um grupo de telejornalistas, de acordo com a situação, pré e pós uma proposta de intervenção fonoaudiológica, na opinião de telespectadores. MÉTODOS: seis telejornalistas de uma emissora de televisão universitária foram filmados em leitura simulada de apresentação de telejornal, e posteriormente submetidos a uma proposta de intervenção fonoaudiológica. Uma nova filmagem foi realizada após a intervenção sob as mesmas condições anteriores. O {{material}} pré e pós-intervenção foi editado de forma aleatória e determinado por sorteio intra-sujeito. A edição foi apresentada, individualmente para 50 telespectadores adultos, para julgamento do desempenho dos telejornalistas. RESULTADOS: no julgamento dos telespectadores observou-se que, dos seis telejornalistas, quatro apresentaram um percentual estatisticamente significante de preferência dos telespectadores na situação pós-intervenção. CONCLUSÃO: verificou-se percentual estatisticamente significante de preferência para os telespectadores na situação pósintervenção, {{dado que}} demonstra o efeito positivo da intervenção fonoaudiológica realizada com os telejornalistas. PURPOSE: to examine viewers' perception on television newscaster performance {{before and after}} speech-language intervention. METHODS: six university station newscasters were videotaped reading while pretending {{to be in a}} news-broadcasting situation. They were then subjected to a speech-language program. The program consisted of four meetings, each lasting two hours and thirty minutes. After the end of the program, the journalists were videotaped for a second time, under the same conditions as before the beginning of the intervention. The recorded pre and post-program material was randomly edited and the <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>appearances</b> determined <b>by</b> an intra-subject draw. Subsequently, the edited material was shown to 50 adult viewers, who were asked to provide their opinion on each individual's pre and post-program performance. RESULTS: it was perceived that, in the viewers' opinions, four of the six subjects showed a statistically significant viewer preference for the post-intervention recording. CONCLUSION: the majority of the analyzed newscasters had statistically significant percentages of viewer preferences for the post-intervention recording, demonstrating the positive effects of the speech-language intervention...|$|R
