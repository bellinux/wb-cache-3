5|$|Of the 7,402 species <b>of</b> <b>flowering</b> plants {{occurring}} in the Western Ghats, 5,588 species are native or indigenous and 376 are exotics naturalised and 1,438 species are cultivated or planted as ornamentals. Among the indigenous species, 2,253 species are endemic to India and of them, 1,273 species are exclusively confined to the Western Ghats. Apart from 593 confirmed subspecies and varieties; 66 species, 5 subspecies and 14 varieties of doubtful occurrence are also reported and therefore amounting 8,080 taxa <b>of</b> <b>flowering</b> plants.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{compound}} leaves <b>of</b> <b>flowering</b> {{plants are}} partially homologous both to leaves and shoots, because their development {{has evolved from}} a genetic mosaic of leaf and shoot development.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{morphology}} recognises {{a continuum}} between the major morphological categories of root, stem (caulome), leaf (phyllome) and trichome. Furthermore, it emphasises structural dynamics. Modern systematics {{aims to reflect}} and discover phylogenetic relationships between plants. Modern Molecular phylogenetics largely ignores morphological characters, relying on DNA sequences as data. Molecular analysis of DNA sequences from most families <b>of</b> <b>flowering</b> plants enabled the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group to publish in 1998 a phylogeny <b>of</b> <b>flowering</b> plants, answering {{many of the questions}} about relationships among angiosperm families and species. The theoretical possibility of a practical method for identification of plant species and commercial varieties by DNA barcoding is the subject of active current research.|$|E

5|$|Polyploidy {{appears to}} have {{enhanced}} the ability <b>of</b> <b>flowering</b> plants to survive the extinction, probably because the additional copies of the genome such plants possessed, allowed them to more readily adapt to the rapidly changing environmental conditions that followed the impact.|$|E

40|$|The effect <b>of</b> <b>flower</b> {{weight on}} changes in the vase life <b>of</b> <b>flowers</b> and leaves <b>of</b> waxflowers was studied by {{evaluating}} the arranged <b>flower</b> weight <b>of</b> cultivars derived from the Chamelaucium uncinatum, Chamelaucium megalopetalum and Verticordia species. Competition for water and carbohydrates between flowers and leaves influenced vase life. The removal <b>of</b> <b>flowers</b> had {{at least four times}} the effect on leaf vase life as the removal <b>of</b> leaves on <b>flower</b> vase life. Supplying exogenous sucrose to satisfy the demand for carbohydrates negated this effect, indicating that flowers depend on carbohydrates being supplied from leaves to maintain vase life. Cultivars with a greater proportion <b>of</b> <b>flowers</b> (on a weight basis) improved the vase life <b>of</b> <b>flowers</b> {{at the expense of the}} leaves. Cultivars with large flowers or many small flowers or a greater weight ratio <b>of</b> <b>flowers</b> to stem appeared to draw more carbohydrates and water from the leaves, giving them a longer vase life and decreasing the vase life of the leaves. The vase life <b>of</b> <b>flowers</b> increased with the stage <b>of</b> opening <b>of</b> <b>flowers</b> up to 50 % opening and then decreased up to 100 % opening...|$|R
