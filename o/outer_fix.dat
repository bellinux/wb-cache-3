40|$|The topic {{addressed}} in this PhD thesis {{is the development of}} a rotational Lumped Parameter model to analyze the dynamic behavior of planetary gearbox. This model allows the study of the gearbox torsional vibrations. In particular, the study carried out in this thesis has focused on simple planetary trains, with three planets and an the <b>outer</b> <b>fix</b> ring. Therefore the following five rotational degree of freedom have been taken into account: the sun rotation, the rotation of the three planets and the carrier rotation. In {{the first part of the}} work, the attention has been focused on a correct description of the gearbox geometry (especially on the toothed wheels geometry) and on the operating characteristics, such as pressure angles and center to center distance. The definition of the geometry was then used for the development of a complex finite element model that, combined with an analytical formulation, allows to obtain the meshing stiffness, depending on the operating conditions of the gearbox. This meshing stiffness was used in the lumped parameter model to define the meshing forces, formed from an elastic component and from a viscous damping component. In addition to the meshing forces, the lumped parameter model considers the inertial actions and the external actions given by the driving torque and the resistant torque. From the simulation results it is possible to analyze the instantaneous angular velocity, the instantaneous angular acceleration of all wheels in different operating conditions, the variation of the meshing stiffness and the forces variations during the gearbox operations. The model is ready for an extension to the translational degrees of freedom, for which the formulation has already been developed. After having developed the entire model, some experimental tests were carried out in order to acquire the torsional vibratory signals of the gearbox unit studied. The tests were performed at different rotational speeds and with different torques applied. The experimental signals obtained have been used to validate the theoretical model. Overall, the research activity is scientifically relevant because it allows, through the development of a lumped parameter model, the study of torsional vibrations of planetary gear units. The model includes the most relevant dynamic phenomena involved in the gearbox, thus allowing the evaluation of the forces that mainly determine the vibrational signature of the studied gearbox. For this reason, the model can be considered a useful tool to support the design and prototyping, as it allows to identify the causes of undesirable dynamic effects and allows to evaluate the effect of any design changes on the dynamic behavior of the gearbox...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Two typical electrorheological materials, {{which are}} {{anhydrous}} dispersions of silica particles in silicone oil with surface active additives, are sheared in oscillatory motion in a gap, formed by an <b>outer</b> <b>fixed</b> cylinder and an inner, axially movable cylinder. The rheometer is operated at tuneable resonance frequencies, such {{that only the}} reaction of the material is measured. Long time oscillatory shear measurements show that the electroviscous stress deteriorates under d. c. elec-tric field, while electroviscous stress is stable when a. c. fields are used. Electroviscous stress is found to depend on field frequency through the dependence of the dielectric constant of the disperse phase on field frequency. A dimensionless quantity, which relates the electroviscous shear stress to the electric field strength, serves to correlate all the experimental data for different shear amplitudes and shear frequencies for each fluid. The phenomenological theory of Huang and Spurk predicts this efficiency with satisfactory accuracy...|$|R

40|$|An {{algorithm}} {{has been}} developed for the non-destructive determination of local thickness of the refractory material walls in smelter furnaces. This method uses measurements of temperature and heat flux {{at a number of}} points on the <b>outer</b> (<b>fixed)</b> surface of the furnace and assumes that the inner (guessed) surface of the furnace wall is isothermal. The temperature field is then predicted in the furnace wall subject to the measured temperature values on the external surface and the isothermal solidus temperature on the inner surface of the wall. The shape determination method then uses the difference between the measured and the computed heat fluxes on the outer surface of the furnace as a forcing function in an elastic membrane concept for the determination of the inner (melt refractory) surface shape. The initial guess of the wall inner shape can be significantly different from the final (unknown) wall shape. The entire wall shape determination procedure requires typically 5 - 15 temperature field analysis in the furnace wall material...|$|R

40|$|Because of {{existence}} {{of various kinds}} of disturbances, layover effects, and shadowing, {{it is difficult to}} extract road from high-resolution SAR images. A new road center-point searching method is proposed by two alternant steps: local detection and global tracking.

The outer window is used to obtain the local road direction by using orientation histogram, {{based on the fact that}} the surrounding objects always range along with roads. The inner window rotates its orientation in accordance with the result of local road direction calculation and searches the center points of a road segment. In global tracking step, particle filter of variable-step is used to deal with the problem of tracking frequently broken by shelters along the roadside and obstacles on the road. Finally, the center-points are linked by quadratic curve fitting. In 1 [*]m high-resolution airborne SAR image experiment, the results show that this method is effective...|$|R

The assemblage consisted of a double rotating inner barrel and an <b>outer</b> <b>fixed</b> and slotted skin which was pinned to the central spring.

Precise engineering ensured that there was just enough ease of movement for the turning of the barrels, but just enough friction to prevent movement of the barrels while vigorous knitting continued. However the introduction in the late 1950s of double knitting yarn and the consequent popular use of thicker needles tended to damage the springs which were intended for needles of a maximum thickness of 3.25mm.

40|$|Abstract — The ferrohydrodynamic problem, with a {{disconnected}} free surface, of {{the stability}} of an an-nular magneto-fluid seal under the action of centrifugal forces and a pressure drop is solved numerically. The effect of the shaft speed on the critical pressure drop is investigated {{in relation to the}} volume of the magneto-fluid plug, the magnetic field strength, the magnetic properties of the fluid, the gap width, and the shaft radius. The flow pattern and the thermal power released in the sealing layer are studied. This paper continues a series of publications [1 – 8] dedicated to the numerical simulation of a single-stage annular magneto-fluid seal. We will study the behavior of a magneto-fluid plug in the narrow profiled gap between two coaxial surfaces of revolution, the inner of which rotates. To the <b>outer</b> <b>fixed</b> cylindrical surface, an annular axially magnetized permanent magnet with a hyperboloidal polar head (magnetic flux concentrator) is attached. A magnetic fluid between the shaft and the polar head forms a hermetic barrier which isolates regions at different pressures. The plug is retained in the gap by the high-gradient magnetic field of the concentrator directed across the gap, which opposes the centrifugal force and the pressure drop that try to push it out. The stability limits of the magneto-fluid plug are in large measure determined by the deformation of the disconnected free surface which consists of two asymmetric fragments with no point of contact. The previous studies either neglected the deformation, assuming the surface shape to be fixe...|$|R
