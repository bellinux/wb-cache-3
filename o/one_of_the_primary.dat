5|$|A dwarf, in the Dungeons & Dragons (D) fantasy roleplaying game, is a {{humanoid}} race, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> races {{available for}} player characters. The {{idea for the}} D dwarf comes from European mythologies and J. R. R. Tolkien's novel The Lord of the Rings (1954-1955), and {{has been used in}} D and its predecessor Chainmail since the early 1970s. Variations from the standard dwarf archetype of a short and stout demihuman are commonly called subraces, of which {{there are more than a}} dozen across many different rule sets and campaign settings.|$|E

5|$|Brock {{arrived in}} Canada {{with the rest}} of the 49th foot and was {{initially}} assigned to Montreal. Almost immediately, in 1804 he was faced with <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> problems in Canada: desertion. Seven soldiers stole a boat and fled across the river (and border) into the United States. Despite having no jurisdiction on American soil, Brock sent a party across the border in pursuit and the men were captured.|$|E

Noted for his abilities in hunting and battle, Buffalo was recognized as chief by his people because of his speaking and oratorical skills, which were highly valued in his culture. By the time the Ojibwa of Wisconsin and Minnesota started treaty negotiations with the US Government, Buffalo was recognized as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> spokesmen for all the bands, {{not just for the}} Ojibwa from La Pointe.|$|E
5|$|Carrots can {{be eaten}} {{in a variety}} of ways. Only 3 percent of the β-carotene in raw carrots is {{released}} during digestion: this can be improved to 39% by pulping, cooking and adding cooking oil. Alternatively they may be chopped and boiled, fried or steamed, and cooked in soups and stews, as well as baby and pet foods. A well-known dish is carrots julienne.

5|$|Despite this reserve, early {{settlers}} {{extended their}} fences to the river. In 1791, the Land Board ordered that the fences be removed {{to permit the}} reserve's use as a public road. The Niagara Road quickly became the primary route between Fort Erie and Fort George. Its importance grew with the declaration of war against the Americans in June 1812. During the war, the road became vital for the movement of militia and supplies, and accordingly it was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> frontiers of the war.|$|E
5|$|During {{the return}} from the Galápagos through the Sargasso Sea, Beebe once again failed to find the thick mats of Sargassum whose study had been <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> goals of the expedition. Searching {{for a way to}} satisfy his expedition's donors, Beebe hit upon the idea of documenting the marine life of the Hudson Gorge just beyond the shore of New York City. Applying the same {{techniques}} to studying the Hudson Gorge that he had used in the Galápagos, Beebe encountered a surprising variety of sea animals, many of which had previously been thought to be exclusive to the tropics.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, Bethe, {{along with}} IBM {{physicist}} Richard Garwin, {{published an article}} criticising in detail the anti-ICBM defense system proposed by the Department of Defense.

5|$|Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) {{have been}} known to prolong and enhance the effects of psilocybin. Alcohol {{consumption}} may enhance the effects of psilocybin, because acetaldehyde, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> breakdown metabolites of consumed alcohol, reacts with biogenic amines present in the body to produce MAOIs related to tetrahydroisoquinoline and β-carboline. Tobacco smokers may also experience more powerful effects with psilocybin, because tobacco smoke exposure decreases the activity of MAO in the brain and peripheral organs.|$|E
