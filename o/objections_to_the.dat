5|$|During the {{preparation}} of the new constitution for West Germany, discussions regarding its national symbols took place in August 1948 during a meeting at Herrenchiemsee. Although there were <b>objections</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> creation of a national flag before reunification with the east, it was decided to proceed. This decision was primarily motivated by the proposed constitution by the eastern SED in November 1946, where black-red-gold were suggested as the colours for a future German republic.|$|E
5|$|Film ratings organisations had <b>objections</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{excessive}} {{and realistic}} violence, {{with both the}} Motion Picture Association of America and the British Board of Film Classification requesting content adaptations, with the BBFC in particular demanding the cut of 36 seconds of film. The 2006 Ultimate Edition DVD of Licence to Kill marked the first release of the film without cuts.|$|E

5|$|In linguistics, R. M. W. Dixon has {{proposed}} a punctuated equilibrium model for language histories, with reference particularly to the prehistory of the indigenous languages of Australia and his <b>objections</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> proposed Pama–Nyungan language family there. Although his model has raised considerable interest, it does not command majority support within linguistics.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} ten-day round of meetings, Vance {{negotiated}} another ceasefire agreement as a provisional arrangement {{backed by a}} deployment of UN peacekeepers to oversee it. The final obstacle to the agreement was removed when Tuđman agreed to lift the blockade of the remaining JNA barracks in HV-held territory on 25 December. This met Kadijević's conditions {{for the implementation of}} the ceasefire, and Milošević declared he had no <b>objections</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> plan on 31 December.|$|E
5|$|Madison's plan {{operated}} on several assumptions {{that were not}} seriously challenged. During the deliberations, few raised serious <b>objections</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> planned bicameral congress, nor the separate executive function, nor the separate judicial function. As English law had typically recognized government as having two separate functions, law making embodied in the legislature, and law executing embodied in the king and his courts, {{the division of the}} legislature from the executive and judiciary was a natural and uncontested point.|$|E

5|$|The Third Amendment was {{introduced}} in Congress in 1789 by James Madison {{as a part of}} the United States Bill of Rights, in response to Anti-Federalist <b>objections</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> new Constitution. Congress proposed the amendment to the states on September 28, 1789, and by December 15, 1791, the necessary three-quarters of the states had ratified it. Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson announced the adoption of the amendment on March 1, 1792.|$|E
5|$|The Vicinage clause has {{its roots}} in medieval English {{criminal}} procedure, the perceived abuses of criminal vicinage and venue during the colonial period and Anti-federalist <b>objections</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United States Constitution. The clause {{is one of the few}} constitutional criminal procedure provisions that has not been incorporated to apply to proceedings in state courts, along with the Grand Jury Clause of the Fifth Amendment and (possibly) the Excessive Bail Clause of the Eighth Amendment.|$|E

5|$|As was {{the case}} with many of Heinlein's books, Starship Troopers was {{completed}} in a few weeks. It was originally written as a juvenile novel for New York publishing house Scribner; Heinlein had previously had success with this format, having written several such novels published by Scribner. The manuscript was rejected, prompting Heinlein to end his association with the publisher completely, and resume writing books with adult themes. Scholars have suggested that Scribner's rejection was based on ideological <b>objections</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> content of the novel, particularly its treatment of military conflict.|$|E
5|$|Browning's {{dealings}} with the British Army were no smoother. His successor as commander of the 1st Airborne Division, Major-General Hopkinson, had sold the British Eighth Army commander, General Sir Bernard Montgomery, on Operation Ladbroke, a glider landing to seize the Ponte Grande road bridge south of Syracuse. Browning's <b>objections</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> operation were ignored, and attempts to discuss airborne operations with the corps commanders elicited a directive from Montgomery that all such discussion {{had to go through}} him. Browning concluded that to be effective, the airborne advisor had to have equal rank with the army commanders.|$|E
5|$|The {{surrender}} of Italy in September 1943 lifted any possible <b>objections</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{return of the}} evacuees to the Rock. As a result, a Resettlement Board was established in November, and {{at a meeting of}} the Board on 8 February 1944 repatriation priorities were finally agreed. On 6 April 1944 the first group of 1,367repatriates arrived on the Rock directly from the United Kingdom and on 28 May, the first repatriation party left Madeira, and by the end of 1944 only 520non-priority evacuees remained on the island.|$|E

50|$|The Plague is {{considered}} an existentialist classic despite Camus' <b>objection</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> label. The narrative tone is similar to Kafka's, especially in The Trial whose individual sentences potentially have multiple meanings, the material often pointedly resonating as stark allegory of phenomenal consciousness and the human condition.|$|R
5|$|Alyeska {{and the oil}} {{companies}} fought <b>objections</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pipeline's construction in both the courts and in Congress, where debates about the pipeline's environmental impact statement continued through 1971. Objections about the caribou herds were countered by observations of Davidson Ditch, a water pipeline with the same diameter of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, which caribou were able to jump over. To those who argued that the pipeline would irrevocably alter Alaska wilderness, proponents pointed to the overgrown remnants of the Fairbanks Gold Rush, most {{of which had been}} erased 70years later. Some pipeline opponents were satisfied by Alyeska's preliminary design, which incorporated underground and raised crossings for caribou and other big game, gravel and styrofoam insulation to prevent permafrost melting, automatic leak detection and shutoff, and other techniques. Other opponents, including fishermen who feared tanker leaks south of Valdez, maintained their disagreement with the plan.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{the series}} of secessionist movements, the eighteenth century saw the {{formation}} of a number of minor sects. These included the Glasites, formed by Church of Scotland minister John Glas, who was expelled from his parish of Tealing in 1730 for his <b>objections</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> state's intervention in the affairs of the kirk. He advocated a strong form of biblical literalism. With his son-in-law Robert Sandeman, from whose name they are known as the Sandemanians, he founded a number of churches in Scotland and the sect expanded to England and the United States. Closely involved with the Glasites were the followers of industrialist David Dale who broke with the kirk in the 1760s and formed the Old Scotch Independents, sometimes known as the Daleists. He preached a combination of industry and faith that led him to co-found the cotton-mill at New Lanark and to contribute to the Utopian Socialism associated with his son-in-law Robert Owen.|$|E
5|$|Bristol {{was made}} a city in 1542, with the former Abbey of St Augustine {{becoming}} Bristol Cathedral, following the Dissolution of the Monasteries by Henry VIII. The Dissolution also saw the surrender to the king of all of Bristol's friaries and monastic hospitals, together with StJames' Priory, StMary Magdalen nunnery, a Cistercian abbey at Kingswood and the College at Westbury on Trym. In {{the case of the}} friaries at Greyfriars and Whitefriars, the priors had fled before the arrival of the royal commissioners, and at Whitefriars a succession of departing priors had plundered the friary of its valuables. Although the commissioners {{had not been able to}} point to as much religious malpractice in Bristol as elsewhere, there is no record of Bristolians raising any <b>objections</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> royal seizures. In 1541 Bristol's civic leaders took the opportunity of buying up lands and properties formerly belonging to StMark's Hospital, StMary Magdalen, Greyfriars and Whitefriars for a total of a thousand pounds. Bristol thereby became the only municipality in the country which has its own chapel, at StMark's.|$|E

40|$|A {{representative}} sample of 500 {{members of the public}} was interviewed about kidney transplantation. The survey showed that despite widespread awareness of the need for kidney donors only 4. 4 % of the respondents had completed a donor card. The small percentage holding kidney donor cards appears to reflect a failure to inform and motivate the general public. There was no evidence of any widespread <b>objection</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> procedures involved in obtaining cadaver kidneys, but there was strong <b>objection</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> introduction by law of an "opting out" system. The findings suggest how the numbers of potential donors could be increased without changing the law as regards consent to donation...|$|R
5|$|Caligari had its Los Angeles premiere at Miller's Theater on 7 May 1921, but {{the theatre}} {{was forced to}} pull it due to demonstrations by protestors. However, the protest was {{organized}} by the Hollywood branch of the American Legion due to fears of unemployment stemming from the import of German films into America, not over <b>objections</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> content of Caligari itself. After running in large commercial theatres, Caligari began to be shown in smaller theatres and film societies in major cities. Box office figures were not regularly published in the 1920s, so it {{has been difficult to}} assess the commercial success or failure of Caligari in the United States. Film historians Kristin Thompson and David B. Pratt separately studied trade publications from the time in an attempt to make a determination, but reached conflicting findings; with Thompson concluding it was a box office success and Pratt concluding it was a failure. However, both agreed it was more commercially successful in major cities than in theatres in smaller communities, where tastes were considered more conservative.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{unsuccessful}} ventures against Philip and Alexander, the Athenians still respected Demosthenes. In 336BC, the orator Ctesiphon {{proposed that}} Athens honour Demosthenes {{for his services}} to the city by presenting him, according to custom, with a golden crown. This proposal became a political issue and, in 330BC, Aeschines prosecuted Ctesiphon on charges of legal irregularities. In his most brilliant speech, On the Crown, Demosthenes effectively defended Ctesiphon and vehemently attacked those who would have preferred peace with Macedon. He was unrepentant about his past actions and policies and insisted that, when in power, the constant aim of his policies was the honour and the ascendancy of his country; and on every occasion and in all business he preserved his loyalty to Athens. He finally defeated Aeschines, although his enemy's <b>objections</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> crowning were arguably valid from a legal point of view.|$|E
5|$|In February 1944, Meyszner's {{campaign}} against the German-Chetnik agreements escalated sharply. He had unusual allies in this, as Nedić and Ljotić also opposed them, in their case because the agreements tended to sideline them in favour of the Chetniks. In particular, Meyszner strongly opposed the further arming of the Chetniks led by Đurišić and Lukačević, {{on the grounds that}} they had not upheld their previous agreements and that the Croats, as well as Muslims in Albania, Kosovo and the Sandžak, had expressed concerns about any strengthening of the Chetniks. The commander of the Bulgarian 1st Occupation Corps, General Asen Nikoloff, also opposed the agreements. Meyszner's increasing <b>objections</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> agreements coincided with growing Partisan pressure from the west and the advance of the Red Army from the east.|$|E
