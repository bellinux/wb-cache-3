50|$|Following the {{discovery}} of Leduc No. 1 on 13 February 1947, the city of Calgary quickly became an international <b>oil</b> <b>centre.</b> During the ensuing boom, many oil companies sought to establish offices in the city. To capitalize on the necessity of downtown office space, Calgary businessman and lawyer Jacob Bell Barron (1888-1965) hired local architect Jack Cawston (1911-1967), with the firm Cawston and Stevenson, to design a modern office tower. At the time, modernism was rare in Calgary, a colonial city dominated by neoclassical architecture. The few preceding examples of modernism in the city include the Utilities Building at 115 6th Avenue South West (1939), the Alberta Government Telephones Building at 119 6th Avenue South West (1929), the Dmitri Skaken House at 1131 Colborne Crescent South West (1947), and the Glenmore Water Treatment Plant at 5300 19th Street South West (1933). The Barron cost $1.25 million, was built by Larwill and Stevenson Construction Company, and opened in 1951. Original tenants included Sun and Halliburton oil companies. From 1955 to 1969 the building {{was known as the}} Mobil Oil Building.|$|E

Mean noise pollution levels were obtained from OB/OB Gas plant, Ebocha <b>oil</b> <b>centre,</b> Obite Gas plant, Obagi oil centre/flow station and Idu flow station. The mean values obtained are lesser than the Federal Environmental Protection Agency standard of 90 dBA and slightly greater than WHO standard for outdoor. Results envisaged long-term health implications due to continuous daily exposure by the host communities. However, it was recommended among others that old pumps use in the installations should be replaced with electric motors, while plants or generators in use should be soundproof instead of the conventional types that are regular sources of noise...|$|E

As part of the manufacturing industry often experience problems on PUG electoral system and assessment of supplier. Inaccuracies in selecting supplier results the selected supplier failed to deliver an order continually. One of the solutions of this problem {{is to improve the}} supplier selection system. Therefore, this research aims to develop supplier selection model with involves the Pertamina <b>Oil</b> <b>Centre</b> and PUG. An earlier stage of the research is to determine the criteria and subcriteria of the supplier selection obtained through Questionnaires I. The second stage was composing the hierarchy of the problem that was found in the company. The third stage was composing Questionnaires II wich translating AHP scale into triangular fuzzy number. The fourth stage aggregated appraisement of the whole of the respondents. The fifth stage calculated the value of the degree of possibility. The final stage calculated the value of consistency ratio from the opinion of the decision makers. After criteria and sub criteria of the selection and assessment suppliers has been developed. Then it used to choice the supplier of industrial lubricant drum. This research resulted eight criteria selection and assessment of supplier quality criteria, price, delivery, service, innovation, safety and working environment, flexibility, organization with a total combined all the criteria as much as sub criteria 29 sub criteria. The highest weighting is quality’s criteria (1. 00), while the highest one is claims replacement good’s subcriteria (1. 00). The results from supplier assessment indicated that the supplier Y was the chosen supplier.

A faction thus needs at least 5 oil counters each turn to operate at full capacity, and another 3 for each separate supply zone - the Allies need to transport oil from the USA. Major powers may keep off-map oil reserves, which they may increase by voluntarily taking oil effects.|$|R
