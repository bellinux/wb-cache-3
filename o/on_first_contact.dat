Operation of the microscope in water at the higher amplitudes often required for stable imaging has been investigated.

At low frequency, the interfacial stiffness extracted from approach curves is found to be of the order of 1 N m- 1 <b>on</b> <b>first</b> <b>contact,</b> which is indicative of imaging via a compressed liquid layer.

40|$|Exploratory data {{analysis}} often plays {{a central role}} in the early stages of scientific inquiry. Models of complex phenomena are built incrementally, based on suggestive patterns in data and iterative refinement of plausible explanations. Unfortunately, exploration poses an explosive search problem. In this paper we present a planning approach to the problem.

40|$|Vesicles {{and other}} {{carriers}} {{destined for the}} Golgi apparatus must be guided to the correct cisternae. Golgins, long coiled-coil proteins that localize to particular Golgi subdomains via their C termini, are candidate regulators of vesicle sorting. In this study, we report that the GRIP domain golgins, whose C termini bind the Arf-like 1 G protein on the trans-Golgi, can also bind {{four members of the}} Rab family of G proteins. The Rab 2 -, Rab 6 -, Rab 19 -, and Rab 30 - binding sites are within the coiled-coil regions that are not required for Golgi targeting. Binding sites for two of these Rabs are also present on two coiled-coil proteins of the cis-Golgi, the Drosophila melanogaster orthologues of GM 130 and GMAP- 210. We suggest an integrated model for a tentacular Golgi in which coiled-coil proteins surround the Golgi to capture and retain Rab-containing membranes, excluding other structures such as ribosomes. Binding sites for diverse Rabs could ensure that incoming carriers are captured <b>on</b> <b>first</b> <b>contact</b> and moved to their correct destination within the stack...|$|E

The present study aimed at evaluating the behavioral changes of worker ants, time carrying orange pellets, waste deposition and mortality, when subjected to seven days of CHX-incorporated pellets and another seven days of CHX-free pellets. The fungicide adversely and structurally affected the leaf-cutter ant colonies.
