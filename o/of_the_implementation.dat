5|$|Despite the Geneva Accord {{requiring}} {{an immediate}} withdrawal of JNA personnel and equipment from Croatia, the JNA stayed behind {{for up to}} eight months in some areas. When its troops eventually pulled out, JNA left their equipment to the RSK. As a consequence of organisational problems and breaches of ceasefire, the UN peacekeepers, named the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR), did not start to deploy until 8 March. The UNPROFOR took two months to fully assemble in the UN Protected Areas (UNPAs). Furthermore, the RSK forces remained in areas outside designated UNPAs which were under RSK control {{at the time of}} the signing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Implementation</b> Agreement ceasefire of 3 January 1992. Those areas, later better known as the pink zones, were supposed to be restored to Croatian control from the outset of the plan implementation. Failure of this aspect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>implementation</b> of the Vance plan made the pink zones a major source of contention for Croatia and the RSK.|$|E

The case arose out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>implementation</b> of Executive Order 9066 by the U.S. military to create zones of exclusion along the West Coast of the United States where Japanese-Americans were subjected to curfews and eventual removal to relocation centers. This Presidential order followed the Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 that brought America into World War II and inflamed the existing anti-Japanese sentiment in the country.|$|E
