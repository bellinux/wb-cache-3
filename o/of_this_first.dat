5|$|Catalysis is {{performed}} in two stages. First, the activated nucleophile attacks the carbonyl carbon and forces the carbonyl oxygen {{to accept an}} electron, leading to a tetrahedral intermediate. The build-up of negative charge on this intermediate is typically stabilized by an oxanion hole within the active site. The intermediate then collapses back to a carbonyl, ejecting {{the first half of}} the substrate, but leaving the second half still covalently bound to the enzyme as an acyl-enzyme intermediate. The ejection <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>first</b> leaving group is often aided by donation of a proton by the base.|$|E
5|$|For {{nearly a}} decade, no new {{construction}} took place. Then, {{during the summer}} of 1982, the MTO awarded a contract to construct the route north from Dilworth Road towards Manotick, bypassing North Gower and extending the route as far north as Roger Stevens Drive (Regional Road6), including a structure over Stevens Creek. Following completion <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>first</b> contract, a second contract was awarded for the remaining distance north to Century Road (Regional Road8).|$|E
5|$|In January 1099 on {{the journey}} to Jerusalem during the First Crusade, the company of Raymond IV of Toulouse came under attack from the {{garrison}} of Hisn al-Akrad, the forerunner of the Krak, who harried Raymond's foragers. The following day Raymond marched on the castle and found it deserted. The crusaders briefly occupied the castle in February {{of the same year}} but abandoned it when they continued their march towards Jerusalem. Permanent occupation began in 1110 when Tancred, Prince of Galilee took control of the site. The early castle was substantially different from the extant remains and no trace <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>first</b> castle survives at the site.|$|E

5|$|Reports <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>first</b> {{contact between}} {{opposing}} forces outside St. Jean were often wildly exaggerated, with many local reports claiming it {{as some kind}} of victory. The Quebec Gazette, for example, reported that 60 Indians had driven off 1,500 Americans, killing 30 and wounding 40. Following this news, General Carleton issued orders for all of the nearby parishes to call up ten percent of their militia. Officers of the militia reported to Montreal, but many militia men stayed home. By September 7, a troop of about 120 men was raised, which was sent to Fort St. Jean.|$|E

5|$|The {{expedition}} {{originally had}} high expectations of encountering a densely populated region that would quickly submit to Spanish rule, with the natives being parcelled out in encomienda to the conquistadores, effectively as slave labour. The fierce resistance to Luis Marín's expedition quickly extinguished such hopes. However, {{within two years}} <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>first</b> reconnaissance, titles of encomienda were being issued and used as justification to seize slaves. Chamula was given to Bernal Díaz, and Zinacantan was given to Francisco de Marmolejo.|$|E

Their second term of service lasted 9 months from September 1862 to July 1863 during which they were stationed in New Bern, North Carolina, participated in several expeditions and saw minor combat including the Battle of Goldsboro Bridge. Their third enlistment {{in response to the}} emergency call for troops to defend Washington, D.C. lasted 100 days from July to November 1864 during which they were stationed in various fortifications around Baltimore, Maryland, primarily in Fort McHenry.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{unification}} of Italy in 1861, the new Regia Marina (Royal Navy) began a construction program to prepare a fleet of ironclad warships capable of defeating the Austrian Navy. Italy considered the Austrian Empire to be its main rival, since it controlled predominantly Italian areas, including Venice. The nascent Italian shipyards were incapable of building the number of ships the new fleet would require, so most <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>first</b> generation of ironclads were built by foreign ship builders. In 1861, the two ships of the Re d'Italia class were ordered from the American shipyard owned by William H. Webb, {{under the direction of}} General Luigi Federico Menabrea, then the Italian Navy Minister. The design for the ships was based heavily on the contemporary French ironclad , but they did not meet the high expectations the Italian fleet placed upon them.|$|E

5|$|In late March, West Nohno {{began the}} first of three Boston–Liverpool round trips.

The cargo ship returned to Boston on 3 June and began her second voyage to Liverpool on 30 June. While in the UK she called at Loch Ewe, Methil, and Oban in July and August before her 6 September return to Boston. Her third journey was an extended one that began by sailing from Boston on 3 October. She arrived at Liverpool three weeks later. During the next seven weeks, she made her way to Milford Haven, from which she began her last westbound transatlantic crossing on 13 December. West Nohno arrived in Boston on 5 January 1944.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the German commanders were {{reluctant}} to bomb London, fearing retaliation against Berlin. On 24 August 1940, a single aircraft, tasked to bomb Tilbury, accidentally bombed Stepney, Bethnal Green and the City. The following night the RAF retaliated by mounting a forty aircraft raid on Berlin, with a second attack three days later. The Luftwaffe changed its strategy from attacking shipping and airfields to attacking cities. The City and West End were designated 'Target Area B'; the East End and docks were 'Target Area A'. The first raid occurred at 4:30p.m. on 7 September and consisted of 150 Dornier and Heinkel bombers and large numbers of fighters. This {{was followed by a}} second wave of 170 bombers. Silvertown and Canning Town bore the brunt <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>first</b> attack.|$|E
