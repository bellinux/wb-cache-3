Its music also incorporates R, soul, and funk influences. The album's cover depicts a nude black woman holding a white {{baby in her arms}} and alludes comically to the band's African-American music influences. The songs have themes <b>of</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>and</b> guilt, and deal with topics such as dysfunctional relationships and sexual deviancy. Conceived during the burgeoning grunge scene, the album has been viewed by music writers as stylistically distinct from other Sub Pop and grunge music.|$|E
5|$|The poet, {{of whose}} works I have {{undertaken}} the revision, may now begin {{to assume the}} dignity of an ancient, and claim the privilege of established fame and prescriptive veneration. He has long outlived his century, the term commonly fixed as the test of literature merit. Whatever advantages he might once derive from personal allusions, local customs, or temporary opinions, have for many years been lost; and every topic of merriment, or motive of sorrow, which the modes of artificial life afforded him, now only obscure the scenes which they once illuminated. The effects of favour and competition are at an end; the tradition of his friendships and his enmities has perished; his works support no opinion with arguments, nor supply any faction with invectives; they can neither indulge vanity nor gratify malignity; but are read without any other reason than the desire <b>of</b> <b>pleasure,</b> <b>and</b> are therefore praised only as pleasure is obtained; yet, thus unassisted by interest or passion, they have past through variation of taste and changes of manners, and, as they devolved {{from one generation to}} another, have received new honours at every transmission.|$|E

25|$|Some {{theories}} describe {{no higher}} collective value {{than that of}} maximizing pleasure for individual(s). Some even define goodness and intrinsic value as the experience <b>of</b> <b>pleasure,</b> <b>and</b> bad as the experience of pain. This view is called hedonism, a monistic theory of value. It has two main varieties: simple, and Epicurean.|$|E

25|$|The idea of {{emptiness}} {{as lack of}} inherent existence has {{very little to do}} with what the Buddha himself said about emptiness. His teachings on emptiness — as reported in the earliest Buddhist texts, the Pali Canon — deal directly with actions and their results, with issues <b>of</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>and</b> pain. To understand and experience emptiness in line with these teachings requires not philosophical sophistication, but a personal integrity willing to admit the actual motivations behind your actions and the actual benefits and harm they cause.|$|E

25|$|Life in the Iron Mills {{is set in}} a {{small village}} whose center is {{industrial}} work, especially that of the iron mills. It is described as a polluted and oppressive village, inhabited by laborers, mostly “masses of men, with dull, besotted faces bent to the ground, sharpened here and there by pain or cunning; skin and muscle and flesh begrimed with smoke and ashes”. The novella's protagonist is Hugh Wolfe, an iron mill laborer who possesses artistic talent and a spiritual desire for higher forms <b>of</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>and</b> fulfillment. Despite the hopefulness of Wolfe’s artistic drive, he becomes the story's tragic hero, as his yearning for a better life leads to his imprisonment and ultimate death.|$|E

This was supplanted by German-born John Augustus Roebling's Niagara Falls Suspension Bridge in 1855. After the American Civil War, the New York Central Railroad publicized Niagara Falls as a focus <b>of</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>and</b> honeymoon visits. With increased railroad traffic, in 1886, Leffert Buck replaced Roebling's wood and stone bridge with the predominantly steel bridge that still carries trains over the Niagara River today. The first steel archway bridge near the falls was completed in 1897. Known today as the Whirlpool Rapids Bridge, it carries passenger vehicles and trains between Canada (through Canadian Customs Border Control) and the U.S.A. just downstream of the falls.|$|E
25|$|Second, the Muslim ulema looked with reproach on {{the ruling}} Aghlabids. Aggravation in {{religious}} circles arose {{primarily from the}} un-Islamic lifestyle of the rulers. Disregarding the strong religious sentiments held by the many in the community, often the Aghlabids led lives <b>of</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>and,</b> e.g., were seen drinking wine (against Islamic law). Another issue was Aghlabid taxation not sanctioned by the Maliki school of Islamic law. Other opponents criticized their contemptuous treatment of mawali Berbers who had embraced Islam. The Islamic doctrine of equality regardless of race was a cornerstone of the Sunni movement in the Maghrib, and also of the Maliki school of law as developed in Kairouan; these principles formed {{the core of the}} hostility of Ifriqiya toward rule from the east by the Caliph.|$|E
500|$|With {{this theme}} of a loss <b>of</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>and</b> {{inevitable}} death, the poem, according to Claude Finney, describes [...] "the inadequacy {{of the romantic}} escape {{from the world of}} reality to the world of ideal beauty". Earl Wasserman essentially agrees with Finney, but he extended his summation of the poem to incorporate the themes of Keats's Mansion of Many Apartments when he says, [...] "the core of the poem is the search for the mystery, the unsuccessful quest for light within its darkness" [...] and this [...] "leads only to an increasing darkness, or a growing recognition of how impenetrable the mystery is to mortals." [...] With these views in mind, the poem recalls Keats's earlier view <b>of</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>and</b> an optimistic view of poetry found within his earlier poems, especially Sleep and Poetry, and rejects them. This loss <b>of</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>and</b> incorporation of death imagery lends the poem a dark air, which connects [...] "Ode to a Nightingale" [...] with Keats' other poems that discuss the demonic nature of poetic imagination, including Lamia. In the poem, Keats imagines the loss of the physical world and sees himself dead—he uses an abrupt, almost brutal word for it—as a [...] "sod" [...] over which the nightingale sings. [...] The contrast between the immortal nightingale and mortal man, sitting in his garden, is made all the more acute by an effort of the imagination.|$|E

500|$|During the Liang dynasty (502587), fu {{continued}} to be a popular form of literature, though it began to merge with the popular five- and seven-syllable poetry forms, which completely eclipsed fu during the Tang dynasty.

[...] "Fu on Lotus-picking" [...] (Cǎi lián fù [...] ), by Xiao Gang (later Emperor Jianwen of Liang), is a short, lyrical fu that mixes freely with popular lyric poetry, and portrayed southern China as a romantic land <b>of</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>and</b> sensuality. Lotus-picking was an activity traditionally associated with peasant women, but in the early 5th century became a popular topic in fu and poetry.|$|E
