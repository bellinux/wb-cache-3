5|$|Colin Renfrew {{has pointed}} out the dangers of {{applying}} modern values of art to past societies and cultures. Günter Berghaus argues that these works have often been approached {{with a set of}} post-Renaissance aesthetic values that distinguish between artists and craftsman and art and artifact, although these categories are not universal and may be inappropriate for understanding prehistoric society. Duncan Garrow has pointed to the difficulties of the modern distinction drawn between form and decoration. The emphasis in studies of prehistoric art tend to be placed on decoration in <b>objects</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> ceramics and ignores the importance of form, found in <b>objects</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> weapons.|$|E

50|$|Like {{other games}} in The Sims series, Sims could develop skills. There were six skills: art, cooking, music, writing, athletic, driving, and various project skill items which were tied with {{specific}} themed collections. Developing higher level skill levels allowed Sims to obtain new objects. Sims developed skills when the player interacted with an art <b>object</b> (<b>such</b> <b>as</b> easel or computer when level 30), a music <b>object</b> (<b>such</b> <b>as</b> a guitar or keyboard when level 10), a cooking <b>object</b> (<b>such</b> <b>as</b> a microwave, a coffee maker when level 10, or a stove when level 15), or a writing <b>object</b> (<b>such</b> <b>as</b> a computer or typewriter when level 10). At times, skills {{were a part}} of quests given to the player for their Sim to achieve.|$|R
5|$|Like Conrad von Soest, Lochner often applied black {{cross-hatching}} on gold, {{usually to}} render metallic <b>objects</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> brooches, crowns or buckles, {{in imitation of}} goldsmiths work on precious <b>objects</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> reliquaries and chalices. He was heavily influenced by the art and process of metalwork and goldsmithing, especially in his painting of gold grounds, {{and it has been}} suggested that he may have once trained as a goldsmith. Evidence of his imitation of elements of their craft is apparent even in his underdrawings. Notable and elaborate painted examples include the tooled gold border of the angelic concert in his Last Judgement, and Gabriel's clasp on the outer wing of the Dombild altarpiece.|$|E
5|$|Mathematics has {{directly}} influenced {{art with}} conceptual {{tools such as}} linear perspective, the analysis of symmetry, and mathematical <b>objects</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> polyhedra and the Möbius strip. Magnus Wenninger creates colourful stellated polyhedra, originally as models for teaching. Mathematical concepts such as recursion and logical paradox {{can be seen in}} paintings by Rene Magritte and in engravings by M. C. Escher. Computer art often makes use of fractals including the Mandelbrot set, and sometimes explores other mathematical <b>objects</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> cellular automata. Controversially, the artist David Hockney has argued that artists from the Renaissance onwards made use of the camera lucida to draw precise representations of scenes; the architect Philip Steadman similarly argued that Vermeer used the camera obscura in his distinctively observed paintings.|$|E
5|$|According to Hermann Weyl, Fischer was an {{important}} influence on Noether, in particular by introducing her {{to the work of}} David Hilbert. From 1913 to 1916 Noether published several papers extending and applying Hilbert's methods to mathematical <b>objects</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> fields of rational functions and the invariants of finite groups. This phase marks the beginning of her engagement with abstract algebra, the field of mathematics to which she would make groundbreaking contributions.|$|E

5000|$|This wheel then {{balances}} on a sharp pointed <b>object</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> a thumbtack, pin, needle, or pen cover firmly {{planted on}} a flat surface. [...] An <b>object</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> a thumbtack or pen cover can stand on its base by itself, however an <b>object</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> a needle {{will need to be}} rooted in another stable <b>object</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> an eraser, sponge, box, or bottle cap in order to provide it with enough stability to hold the spinning wheel on its tip; one stable design even uses a plastic bottle cap filled with an equal amount of J-B Weld, a quick drying two-part epoxy, to hold a needle of any desired size upright in place. Sometimes such psi wheels are placed within medium-sized glass or clear plastic containers to prevent random bursts of air and possibly heat from the hands from causing spurious movement of the wheel.|$|R
5|$|All nuthatches nest in cavities; {{except for}} the two species of rock nuthatches, all use tree holes, making a simple cup lined with soft {{materials}} on which to rest eggs. In some species the lining consists of small woody <b>objects</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> bark flakes and seed husks, while in others it includes the moss, grass, hair and feathers typical of passerine birds.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage is an {{important}} defense strategy enabled by changes in body shape, colour and markings. Some lepidopterans blend with the surroundings, making them difficult to be spotted by predators. Caterpillars can be shades of green that match their host plant. Others resemble inedible <b>objects,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> twigs or leaves. The larvae of some species, such as the common Mormon and the western tiger swallowtail look like bird droppings.|$|E
5|$|Common ravens {{are known}} to steal and cache shiny <b>objects</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> pebbles, pieces of metal, and golf balls. One theory is that they hoard shiny objects to impress other ravens. Other {{research}} indicates that juveniles are deeply curious about all new things, and that common ravens retain an attraction to bright, round objects based on their similarity to bird eggs. Mature birds lose their intense interest in the unusual, and become highly neophobic.|$|E

5|$|Despite the limitations, Robinett {{was able}} to {{introduce}} concepts {{that at the time}} were unfamiliar to players.

5|$|General {{relativity}} {{has developed}} into an essential tool in modern astrophysics.

Their strong gravity is thought to be responsible for the intense radiation emitted by certain types of astronomical <b>objects</b> (<b>such</b> <b>as</b> active galactic nuclei or microquasars). General relativity is also part of the framework of the standard Big Bang model of cosmology.|$|E
