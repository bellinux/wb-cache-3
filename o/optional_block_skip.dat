40|$|In this paper, a {{hardware}} nested looping structure with an instruction buffer memory is {{proposed for the}} parameterized and embedded DSP core. An optional buffer memory for the instructions in the loop is used to save much of the memory accessing power consumption during the transaction of the program memory fetching. The size of the instruction buffer memory and nested loop depth are parameterized parameters. Design examples show that the hardware overhead for the nested hardware looping scheme is only 3. 6 % and saves 15 % power consumption.

The implementation with 0. 18 um CMOS process just needs average 6. 88 cycles for one block coding and costs 11. 9 K gates when working at 100 MHz.

30|$|The {{extended}} model formulation {{presented in}} the following {{is based on the}} distinction of fixed and <b>optional</b> <b>blocks.</b> Since each product family must be scheduled at least once {{in the course of the}} planning horizon—given that a positive net-requirement for at least one item within the product family exists—we consider the setup of one block of each product family as being fixed, but still leave the start-off time of the block open. Further setups of a product family are considered optional because the number and the size of the respective blocks as well as their timing have to be determined by the optimization model. The rationale behind the introduction of fixed blocks is to reduce the number of binary decision variables for the setup of blocks and product types.|$|R

To handle the complex and ill-posed nature of the {{problems}} of audio source separation, the current state-of-the-art approaches employ deep neural networks to obtain instrumental spectra from a mixture. In this study, we propose a novel network architecture that extends the recently developed densely connected convolutional network (DenseNet), which has shown excellent results on image classification tasks. To deal with the specific problem of audio source separation, an up-sampling layer, <b>block</b> <b>skip</b> connection and band-dedicated dense blocks are incorporated on top of DenseNet. The proposed approach takes advantage of long contextual information and outperforms state-of-the-art results on SiSEC 2016 competition by a large margin in terms of signal-to-distortion ratio. Moreover, the proposed architecture requires significantly fewer parameters and considerably less training time compared with other methods. Comment: to appear at WASPAA 201...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{lossless}} {{data hiding}} has attracted increasing interests. As a reversible watermark scheme, the host media and hidden data should be recovered without distortion. A latest lossless data hiding technique based on image blocking and block classification has achieved good performance for image authentication. However, this method cannot always fully restore all the blocks of host images and watermarks. For this purpose, we propose an improved algorithm, which {{is characterized by}} two aspects. First, a <b>block</b> <b>skipping</b> scheme (BSS) is developed for the host blocks selection to embed watermark; secondly, the embedding level is modified by a novel parameter model to guarantee that the host blocks can be recovered without distortion {{as well as the}} embedded data. Extensive experiments conducted on standard grayscale images, medical images, and color images have demonstrated the effectiveness of the improved lossless data hiding scheme...|$|R

Session types {{are designed to}} abstractly capture the structure of (even multi-party) communication protocols. The goal of session types is the analysis and verification of the protocols’ behavioural properties. One important such property is progress, i. e., the absence of (unintended) deadlock. Distributed algorithms often resemble (compositions of) multi-party communication protocols. In contrast to protocols that are typically studied with session types, they are often designed to cope with system failures. An essential behavioural property is (successful) termination, despite failures, but it is often elaborate to prove for distributed algorithms. We extend multi-party session types with <b>optional</b> <b>blocks</b> that cover a limited class of link failures. This allows us to automatically derive termination of distributed algorithms that come within these limits...|$|R
