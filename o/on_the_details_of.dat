5|$|Arguments {{about the}} {{taxability}} of compensation for personal services, whether called wages, salary, {{or some other}} term, may be either constitutional arguments as in United States v. Connor (see below) or statutory arguments as in Cheek v. United States, depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>of</b> the argument. For purposes of presentation, these arguments are summarized here {{rather than in the}} article Tax protester statutory arguments. The rest of this section explains these arguments in more detail.|$|E
5|$|In {{computer}} science, integer sorting is the algorithmic {{problem of}} sorting {{a collection of}} data values by numeric keys, {{each of which is}} an integer. Algorithms designed for integer sorting may also often be applied to sorting problems in which the keys are floating point numbers, rational numbers, or text strings. The ability to perform integer arithmetic on the keys allows integer sorting algorithms to be faster than comparison sorting algorithms in many cases, depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>of</b> which operations are allowed in the model of computing and how large the integers to be sorted are.|$|E
5|$|The {{genre of}} Midas bears {{the marks of}} gender debates, as well, with Percy writing in the {{traditionally}} male-dominated form of the lyric and Mary focusing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>of</b> everyday life in her verse drama. Since the play's first publication in 1922, critics have {{paid more attention to}} Percy Shelley's lyrics than Mary Shelley's drama. However, in the last fifteen years or so, this trend has reversed itself as scholars explore works of Mary Shelley other than Frankenstein (1818).|$|E

5|$|Battle Royale was {{translated}} into English by Yuji Oniki and released in North America by Viz Media on February 26, 2003. An expanded edition with a revision of Oniki's translation and an afterword by Takami was published on November 17, 2009 by Haikasoru, a division of Viz Media. This version also included {{an interview with the}} director of the book's film adaptation, Kinji Fukasaku. Viz released a new translation by Nathan Collins on April 1, 2014, under the title Battle Royale: Remastered. They also published The Battle Royale Slam Book: Essays on the Cult Classic by Koushun Takami on the same day, which includes essays <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>of</b> the novel and the controversies surrounding it as well as its adaptations written by science-fiction, horror, and thriller authors such as Brian Keene, John Skipp, and Catherynne M.

5|$|Following her election, Collins {{donated the}} surplus $242,000 from her {{campaign}} coffers {{to the state}} Democratic Party. When Collins' husband was named state treasurer for the party– at an annual salary of $59,900– the state press charged that the move was a plot to funnel Collins' campaign funds into her personal account. (The previous Democratic state treasurer had received no salary during his tenure.) Following the media criticism, Dr. Collins resigned his post as treasurer. All of the involved individuals insisted that Governor Collins had not been briefed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>of</b> her husband's appointment. The media's criticism of Collins continued {{as many of the}} appointments to her executive cabinet went to what they characterized as inexperienced personnel who had held key positions in her past campaigns. When newly appointed Insurance Commissioner Gilbert McCarty approved a 17% rate increase requested by Blue Cross Blue Shield– a request that his predecessor had denied a few days earlier– Collins quickly countermanded the approval pending a public hearing on the matter.|$|E
5|$|Gaveston's {{return to}} grace was only temporary. On 26 February 1307, Edward I {{announced}} that the prince's favourite {{had to leave the}} realm shortly after 30 April that year. This time it seems the punishment was not intended for Gaveston, though, but for the Prince of Wales. According to Walter of Guisborough, the prince appeared before the King to request that his own county of Ponthieu be given to Gaveston. Edward I, enraged, tore out handfuls of his son's hair and threw him out of the royal chambers. Though Guisborough cannot necessarily be trusted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>of</b> the events, the story reflects the general exasperation the King felt with the prince's favouritism towards Gaveston, and the lavish gifts bestowed on the favourite. This extravagance was clearly seen on Gaveston's departure, when Prince Edward equipped him with horses, luxurious clothes, and £260 of money.|$|E

5|$|Gregory House, M.D., often {{construed}} as a misanthropic medical genius, heads a team of diagnosticians at the Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital in New Jersey. Most episodes revolve around the diagnosis of a primary patient and start with a cold open set outside the hospital, showing events ending {{with the onset of}} the patient's symptoms. The typical episode follows the team in their attempts to diagnose and treat the patient's illness, which often fail until the patient's condition is critical. They usually treat only patients whom other doctors have not accurately diagnosed, and House routinely rejects cases that he does not find interesting. The story lines tend to focus on his unconventional medical theories and practices, and on the other characters' reactions to them, rather than <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>of</b> the treatments.|$|E

30|$|This {{article is}} focused <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{role of the}} {{facilitator}} in the professional development of mathematics teachers. It is a feature of several frameworks for using video that teachers are invited to comment <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>detail</b> <b>of</b> what they saw and heard, and base comments <b>on</b> evidence from <b>the</b> video. It is also a common finding {{that it is hard}} to establish ‘speaking evidentially’ as a way of working and at the same time, such an expectation is seen to be critical to making discussion productive. This article draws on a paradigmatic case of one video club, during which seven teachers met over a 3 -month period, and shared video recordings of their own classrooms. The group of teachers learn how to focus <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>detail</b> <b>of</b> video, avoiding judgement, from the first session. The way this is achieved and what it occasions is analysed, within an enactivist methodology.|$|R

These insights can then be readily transferred to many less abstract applications.|$|E

25|$|The field H {{is defined}} as the long {{wavelength}} Fourier components of the spin variable, in the limit that the wavelengths are long. There are many ways to take the long wavelength average, depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>of</b> how high wavelengths are cut off. The details are not too important, since the goal is to find the statistics of H and not the spins. Once the correlations in H are known, the long-distance correlations between the spins will be proportional to the long-distance correlations in H.|$|E
25|$|Most {{contemporary}} {{scholars of}} antiquity agree that Jesus existed, and most biblical scholars and classical historians see {{the theories of}} his nonexistence as effectively refuted.

However, there is widespread disagreement among scholars <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>of</b> the life of Jesus mentioned in the gospel narratives, and on the meaning of his teachings. Scholars differ on the historicity of specific episodes described in the biblical accounts of Jesus, and historians tend to look upon supernatural or miraculous claims about Jesus as questions of faith, rather than historical fact.|$|E
