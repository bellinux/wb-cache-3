5000|$|Silicone rubber (SiR): {{noted for}} their ability to be used over a wide {{temperature}} range and for excellent resistance to ozone, weathering and aging. Compared with most other sealing elastomers, the physical properties of silicones are poor. Generally, silicone materials are physiologically harmless so they are commonly used {{by the food and drug}} industries. Standard silicones are resistant to water (to 100 °C), aliphatic engine <b>and</b> transmission <b>oils</b> <b>and</b> animal <b>and</b> plant <b>oils</b> <b>and</b> fats. Silicones are generally not resistant to fuels, aromatic mineral oils, steam (short term to 120 °C is possible), silicone <b>oils</b> <b>and</b> greases, acids or alkalis. Fluorosilicone elastomers are far more resistant to <b>oils</b> <b>and</b> fuels. The temperature range of applications is somewhat more restricted.|$|R

More importantly, fish low in <b>oils</b> <b>and</b> fats allow for the drying and preservation process to occur: <b>oils</b> <b>and</b> fats prevent the salt water from preserving the fish.

As a result, there are no reliable estimates of the consumption of different vegetable <b>oils</b> <b>and</b> fats in the diet of European consumers for use in for example, nutritional assessments or chemical risk assessments. We have developed an innovative model to estimate the consumption of vegetable <b>oils</b> <b>and</b> fats by EU consumers using the EU consumption databases and elements of probabilistic modelling.
