5|$|The {{essay was}} {{extensively}} {{discussed in the}} media and the blogosphere, with reactions to Carr's argument being polarised. At the Britannica Blog, a part of the discussion focused on the apparent bias in Carr's argument toward literary reading. In Carr's view, reading <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>is</b> generally a shallower form in comparison with reading from printed books in which he believes a more intense and sustained form of reading is exercised. Elsewhere in the media, the Internet's impact on memory retention was discussed; and, at the online scientific magazine Edge, several argued that it was ultimately the responsibility of individuals to monitor their Internet usage so that it does not impact their cognition.|$|E
5|$|Candidates {{may use the}} Internet {{to publish}} {{election}} advertising, including posting content on electronic media applications (such as digital banners, instant messaging software, mobile applications, RSS feed readers and widgets), social networking services and other websites, and sending e-mails. SMS and MMS messages can also be sent. Candidates must notify the returning officer of each platform on the Internet {{that is used to}} publish election advertising within 12 hours after the start of the campaign period (that is, the time when the place of nomination closes on nomination day) and thereafter each time before a platform is used for such publication. Candidate and their election agents must use their best efforts to ensure that all Internet election advertising is published in accordance with the law; in other words, the returning officer must be satisfied that all reasonable steps in the circumstances were taken. Contravening any regulations relating to election advertising <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>is</b> a criminal offence punishable by a fine of up to $1,000, jail of up to 12 months, or both.|$|E

Similar findings are also reported by Kinsey (cited by Masters), and others earlier in history. Miletski (1999) notes that information on sex with animals <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>internet</b> <b>is</b> often very emphatic as to what the zoophile believes gives pleasure and how to identify what is perceived as consent beforehand. For instance, Jonathan Balcombe says animals do things for pleasure. But he himself says pet owners will be unimpressed by this statement, as this is not news to them.|$|E
25|$|Another area {{of leisure}} {{activity}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>is</b> multiplayer gaming.

These range from MMORPG to first-person shooters, from role-playing video games to online gambling. While online gaming has been around since the 1970s, modern modes of online gaming began with subscription services such as GameSpy and MPlayer. Non-subscribers were limited to certain types of game play or certain games. Many people use the Internet to access and download music, movies and other works for their enjoyment and relaxation. Free and fee-based services exist for all of these activities, using centralized servers and distributed peer-to-peer technologies. Some of these sources exercise more care with respect to the original artists' copyrights than others.|$|E

500|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} in The Guardian, Steve Jones, a communications professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago, gave his perspective on the Kaycee Nicole case. Jones credits the anonymity of the Internet for impeding people's abilities to realize when someone is lying: [...] "Given the mutability of identity, how are we to negotiate social relations that, at least in the realm of face-to-face communication, were fixed by recognition of identity?" [...] Online interaction has only been possible since the 1980s, steadily growing over the years. After analyzing several cases of online deception and interaction, social theorists Adam Joinson and Beth Dietz-Uhler write in a 2002 Social Science Computer Review article that deception <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>is</b> a paradox: the faceless nature of online communications not only gives opportunity to the unscrupulous and attention-seekers, but also allows earnest users to express themselves more freely, representing a truer version of themselves. Typically, Internet deception takes the form of changing one's sex or presenting one's own idealized image of oneself. Joinson and Dietz-Uhler cite a chapter in Network and Netplay, in which researchers note the purpose of some forums is to allow their members to participate in a kind of online party, affording chances to pretend and perform: [...] "the type of play <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>is</b> usually allowed only in children or adults during masked balls or carnivals". More practical issues such as age, location, marital status, and occupation are also frequently changed online, or left ambiguous to preserve users' privacy or continue identity play.|$|E

2500|$|A less-visible form of YEC {{not seen}} as often <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>internet</b> <b>is</b> one which claims {{that there has been}} {{essentially}} no development of the Universe, Earth, or life whatsoever since creation [...] that creation has been in a steady state since the beginning without major changes. According to Ronald Numbers this belief, which does not necessarily try to explain scientific evidence through appeal to a global flood, has not been promoted as much as the former example given. Such YECs believe that fossils are not real and that major extinctions never occurred, so dinosaurs, trilobites, and other examples of extinct organisms found in the fossil record would have to either be hoaxes or simply secular lies, promoted perhaps by the devil.|$|E

2500|$|The {{shift from}} page-based text found {{in print and}} screen-based text found <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>is</b> causing a {{redefinition}} of literacy. [...] While text and image may exist separately, digitally, or in print, their combination gives birth to new forms of literacy and new ways to communicate. Text, whether it is academic, social, or for entertainment purposes, can be accessed {{in a variety of}} different ways and edited by several individuals on the Internet. The spoken and written word are not obsolete, but they are no longer the only way to communicate and interpret messages. With the continual growth of new media and the adaptation of old media, there are now numerous mediums to use when communicating. Many mediums can be used separately and individually. Combining and repurposing one to another has contributed to the evolution of different literacies.|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, the British-based Internet Watch Foundation {{reported}} that child pornography <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>is</b> becoming more brutal and graphic, {{and the number}} of images depicting violent abuse has risen fourfold since 2003. The CEO stated [...] "The worrying issue is the severity and the gravity of the images is increasing. We're talking about prepubescent children being raped." [...] About 80 percent {{of the children in the}} abusive images are female, and 91 percent appear to be children under the age of 12. Prosecution is difficult because multiple international servers are used, sometimes to transmit the images in fragments to evade the law. Some child pornographers also circumvent detection by using viruses to illegally gain control of computers on which they remotely store child pornography. In one case, a Massachusetts man was charged with possession of child pornography when hackers used his computer to access pornographic sites and store pornographic pictures without his knowledge. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit has ruled that if a user downloads child pornography from a file sharing network and possesses it in his [...] "shared folder" [...] without configuring the software to not share that content, he can be charged with distributing child pornography.|$|E
2500|$|Although Watson is {{well known}} for his alleged 1943 statement, [...] "I think there is a world market for maybe five computers," [...] there is scant {{evidence}} he said it. Author Kevin Maney tried to find the origin of the quote, but has been unable to locate any speeches or documents of Watson's that contain this, nor are the words present in any contemporary articles about IBM. One of the very first attributions may be found in The Experts Speak, a book written by Christopher Cerf and Victor S. Navasky in 1984, however Cerf and Navasky just quote from a book written by Morgan and Langford, Facts and Fallacies. Another early article source (May 15, 1985) is a column by Neil Morgan, a San Diego Evening Tribune writer who wrote: [...] "Forrest Shumway, chairman of The Signal Cos., doesn't make predictions. His role model is Tom Watson, then IBM chairman, who said in 1958: 'I think there is a world market for about five computers. The earliest known citation <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>is</b> from 1986 on Usenet in the signature of a poster from Convex Computer Corporation as I think there is a world market for about five computers' —Remark attributed to Thomas J. Watson (Chairman of the Board of International Business Machines), 1943". All these early quotes are questioned by Eric Weiss, an editor of the Annals of the History of Computing in ACS letters in 1985.|$|E
