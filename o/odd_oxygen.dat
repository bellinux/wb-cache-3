40|$|It {{is pointed}} out that during a solar proton event (SPE), large numbers of high-energy protons {{penetrate}} the earth's mesosphere and upper stratosphere and perturb the normal chemistry by ionizing molecules and changing the balance of <b>odd</b> nitrogen, <b>oxygen,</b> and hydrogen.

40|$|Many patients, {{especially}} those in certain "high risk " groups, undergo operative procedures under regional analgesia {{in the belief that}} this approach is safer than general anaesthesia; this is particularly the case for patients with coexistent lung disease. During the procedure, sedation is often provided with an i. v. agent, for example midazolam, diazepam or propofol. It seems (from personal observation) that administration of oxygen to the patient in this situation is not routine in current European practice. There is only equivocal guidance on this topic from reference works on local anaesthesia [1, 2] and most do not mention the use of oxygen, except to treat the complications of regional anaesthesia [3 - 5]. We decided to study the effects of sedation with midazolam on oxygen saturation (5 a 0 j) as meas-ured by pulse oximetry in patients undergoing surgery under regional conduction block. PATIENTS AND METHODS A study was planned of 100 patients aged 20 - 85 yr and in ASA categories I—III. Patients were randomly allocated to one of two groups according to the last digit of the hospital number: the first group (<b>odd</b> digit) received <b>oxygen</b> 2 litre min~l via a 12 -French gauge nasal catheter (without foam nostril plug) during surgery, the second group (even digit) received no additional oxygen unless.

The model {{is used to}} evaluate rates of photolysis for N 2 O, CFCl 3, and CF 2 Cl 2, and to infer global loss rates and instantaneous lifetimes appropriate for 1980. A parameterized version of the line-by-line model enabling rapid evaluation of transmission in the Schumann-Runge region is described. Photochemical calculations employing the parameterization and constrained by data from the Atmospheric Trace Molecule Spectroscopy experiment are {{used to examine the}} budget of <b>odd</b> <b>oxygen.</b> Consistent with previous studies, it is shown that photochemical loss of <b>odd</b> <b>oxygen</b> exceeds production by photolysis of O 2 for altitudes above 40 km. The imbalance between production and loss is shown to be consistent with a source of <b>odd</b> <b>oxygen</b> proportional to the product of the mixing ratio and photolysis rate of ozone, which suggests that processes involving vibrationally excited O 2 may {{play an important role in}} production of <b>odd</b> <b>oxygen...</b>|$|E

40|$|Initial {{studies with}} LLNL models of global {{atmospheric}} chemical, radiative, and transport processes {{have indicated that}} substantial decreases in stratospheric ozone concentrations could result from emissions of NO(x) from aircraft flying in the stratosphere, depending on fleet size and magnitude of the engine emissions. These studies used homogeneous chemical reaction rates (e. g., gas-phase chemistry). Recent evidence indicates that reactions on particles in the stratosphere may be important. Heterogeneous chemical reactions convert NO(x) (NO and NO 2) molecules to HNO 3. This decreases the <b>odd</b> <b>oxygen</b> loss from the NO(x) catalytic cycle and increases the <b>odd</b> <b>oxygen</b> loss from the Cl(x) catalytic cycle. By including these heterogeneous reactions in the LLNL model, the relative partitioning of <b>odd</b> <b>oxygen</b> loss between these two families changes, {{with the result that}} emissions of NO(x) from proposed aircraft fleets flying in the stratosphere now increase ozone.

Seasonally averaged values of these parameters are derived from response measurements and are compared with model calculations between 0. 7 and 4 mbar at tropical latitudes. Results are in agreement within measurement and model uncertainties at all pressure levels.

Use of recent mid-latitude stratospheric measurements of HO(x), NO(x), and ClO(x) with the BUV data provides an independent calculation of the catalytic loss. Below 45 km the agreement between the two sets of loss rates is satisfactory. At higher altitudes the odd hydrogen cycle provides far more O(x) loss than can be tolerated by the BUV measurements if the photodissociation of O 2 is the only source and has the currently accepted magnitude.

Consequently, the POC appears enhanced on the night side compared to its PDE counterpart.

40|$|Except {{for a few}} {{reactions}} involving electronically excited molecular or atomic oxygen or nitrogen, {{atmospheric chemistry}} modelling usually assumes that the temperature dependence of reaction rates is characterized by Arrhenius law involving kinetic temperatures. It is known, however, that in the upper atmosphere the vibrational temperatures may exceed the kinetic temperatures by several hundreds of Kelvins. This excess energy {{has an impact on}} the reaction rates. We have used upper atmospheric OH populations and reaction rate coefficients for OH(v= 0 [...] . 9) +O 3 and OH(v= 0 [...] . 9) +O to estimate the effective (i. e. population weighted) reaction rates for various atmospheric conditions. We have found that the effective rate coefficient for OH(v= 0 [...] . 9) +O 3 can be larger by a factor of up to 1020 than that involving OH in its vibrational ground state only. At altitudes where vibrationally excited states of OH are highly populated, the OH reaction is a minor sink of Ox and O 3 compared to other reactions involving, e. g., atomic oxygen. Thus the impact of vibrationally excited OH on the ozone or Ox sink remains small. Among quiescent atmospheres under investigation, the largest while still small (less than 0. 1 %) effect was found for the polar winter upper stratosphere and mesosphere. The contribution of the reaction of vibrationally excited OH with ozone to the OH sink is largest in the upper polar winter stratosphere (up to 4 %), while its effect on the HO 2 source is larger in the lower thermosphere (up to 1 % for polar winter and 1. 7 % for midlatitude night conditions). For OH(v= 0 [...] . 9) +O the rate coefficients differ by plus/minus a few percent only from those involving OH in its vibrational ground state. The effects on the <b>odd</b> <b>oxygen</b> sink are negative and can reach &minus; 0. 7 % (polar summer lowermost thermosphere), i. e. neglect of vibrational excitation overestimates the <b>odd</b> <b>oxygen</b> sink.

The TLE night side {{secondary}} ozone layer (Fig. 4 c) is characterised by an enhanced O_ 3 VMR compared to the PDE night-time (Fig. 4 d, a, respectively). This is due to the transport of <b>odd</b> <b>oxygen</b> from the day side to the night side through both the horizontal and vertical circulation, where it recombines to form ozone.

At these altitudes, the <b>odd</b> <b>oxygen</b> (and, therefore, ozone) has a lifetime of several months due to the attenuation of the UV radiation flux at higher altitudes. As a result, the ozone distribution is influenced mainly by the dynamics. The Brewer–Dobson circulation transports ozone-rich air from the mid-stratosphere to the polar regions, where the overturning circulation cell shifts the ozone-rich air into the lower polar stratosphere (Brasseur and Solomon 2005) where it accumulates.

40|$|Energetic oxygen {{precipitation}} is {{one possible}} explanation for the auroral molecular hydrogen emissions observed by the Voyager ultraviolet spectrometer. These ions deposit their energy in the Jovian thermosphere by means of ionization, dissociation, excita-tion, and heating processes. The photochemistry of both the neutral gas and the ionosphere is altered by the influx of atomic oxygen. The auroral oxygen flux is about 10 7 cm- 2 sec- 1 if all the observed Lyman and Werner band emissions are due to heavy ion precipita-tion rather than to energetic electron precipitation. The O atoms react with H + ions forming O + ions, which then react with H 2, starting a chain of chemical reactions involving H 2 O+ and H 30 + that ultimately leads to the formation of water. The O atoms can also react with CH 3 and will eventually form CO deeper in the atmosphere. A numerical model has been developed to study the effects of <b>odd</b> <b>oxygen</b> (i. e., O, OH, and H 20) on the auroral iono-sphere of Jupiter. In particular, we show that the electron density is reduced by about a factor of 4 due to the removal of H + ions by chemistry associated with <b>odd</b> <b>oxygen</b> species, whereas the electron density reduction required for consistency with observations is more than a factor of 20 suggesting that other H + loss mechanisms must be operating or that sources of oxygen or water other than auroral precipitation are present.
