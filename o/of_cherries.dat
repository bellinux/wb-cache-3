25|$|In France {{since the}} 1920s, the first {{cherries}} {{of the season}} come in April/May from the region of Céret (Pyrénées-Orientales), where the local producers send, as a tradition since 1932, the first crate <b>of</b> <b>cherries</b> {{to the president of}} the Republic.|$|E
25|$|Century-old vines {{still exist}} in many {{regional}} vineyards {{and allow for}} the production of long-aging, robust red wines with intense fruit and enhanced tannic content. The best known appellation is the DOCG (Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita) Barbera d'Asti in the Piedmont region: the highest-quality Nizza DOCG wines are produced within a sub-zone of the Barbera d'Asti production area. When young, the wines offer a very intense aroma of fresh red cherries and blackberries. In the lightest versions notes <b>of</b> <b>cherries,</b> raspberries and blueberries and with notes of blackberry and black cherries in wines made of more ripe grapes. Many producers employ the use of toasted (seared over a fire) oak barrels, which provides for increased complexity, aging potential, and hints of vanilla notes. The lightest versions are generally known for flavors and aromas of fresh fruit and dried fruits, and are not recommended for cellaring. Wines with better balance between acid and fruit, often with the addition of oak and having a high alcohol content are more capable of cellaring; these wines often result from reduced-yield viticultural methods.|$|E
500|$|Taste of Cherry {{explores the}} {{fragility}} of life and rhetorically focuses on the preciousness of life. [...] Badii, a middle aged apparently healthy and well off Tehrani (played by Homayoun Ershadi), cruises the city’s outskirts in his Range Rover {{trying to find a}} stranger who will help him commit suicide. Conversations with people on the way gradually convince him of the positivity and preciousness of life. From the young Kurdish soldier who is spooked by the shuddering request to a middle-aged Afghani seminarian who is unable to dissuade Badii with religious sympathy to a Turkish taxidermist at a natural history museum who urges the glories of nature — the taste <b>of</b> <b>cherries</b> — as the prime reason not to kill oneself, Kiarostami evokes a high degree of emphasis on the different elements of life.|$|E

50|$|Toward {{the last}} two weeks of April, one can see a two-mile avenue of {{continuous}} rows <b>of</b> <b>cherry</b> blossoms on Chapel Avenue between Haddonfield Road and Kings Highway. The avenue <b>of</b> <b>cherry</b> blossoms was conceived by a group of residents who wanted to unify the townspeople <b>of</b> <b>Cherry</b> Hill to participate in a community-wide celebration of the diverse community <b>of</b> <b>Cherry</b> Hill. This effort started in 1972 and cherry trees are still being planted every year by the Cherry Hill Fire Department and community volunteers.|$|R

2500|$|The National Cherry Festival, {{held during}} the first full week of July every year, is a draw for {{tourists}} to Traverse City. The festival features parades, fireworks, an air show, election of festival royalty, live music, a pie-eating contest and cherries. It is estimated that the Grand Traverse region produces up to [...] <b>of</b> <b>cherries</b> annually. The largest variety of cherry produced locally is the Montmorency cherry, or the [...] "pie cherry". Other cherries grown in the region include the Ulster, or sweet cherry, and the Balaton (from Lake Balaton in Hungary), a cherry situated between the Montmorency and Ulster in terms of color and taste.|$|E
2500|$|Pinot Noir is a {{difficult}} varietal to cultivate and transform into wine. The grape's tendency to produce tightly packed clusters makes it susceptible to several viticultural hazards involving rot that require diligent canopy management. The thin-skins {{and low levels of}} phenolic compounds lends Pinot to producing mostly lightly colored, medium bodied and low tannin wines that can often go through phases of uneven and unpredictable aging. When young, wines made from Pinot Noir tend to have red fruit aromas <b>of</b> <b>cherries,</b> raspberries and strawberries. As the wine ages, Pinot has the potential to develop more vegetal and [...] "barnyard" [...] aromas that can contribute to the complexity of the wine.|$|E

The first aircraft to enter service was a converted Halifax Mk 8 {{with the civil}} registration G-AJBL. It operated Eagle's first commercial flight, carrying a cargo <b>of</b> <b>cherries</b> from Verona to Bovingdon. It subsequently transported fruit from Italy and Spain for the Covent Garden merchants. It was joined by a second Halifax, registered G-ALEF and christened Red Eagle.

2500|$|A {{coffee bean}} is a seed {{of the coffee}} plant and the source for coffee. It is the pit inside the red or purple fruit often {{referred}} to as a cherry. Just like ordinary cherries, the coffee fruit is also a so-called stone fruit. Even though the coffee beans are seeds, they are referred to as [...] "beans" [...] because of their resemblance to true beans. The fruits – coffee cherries or coffee berries – most commonly contain two stones with their flat sides together. A small percentage <b>of</b> <b>cherries</b> contain a single seed, instead of the usual two. This is called a [...] "peaberry". The peaberry occurs only between 10 and 15% of the time, and it is a fairly common (yet scientifically unproven) belief that they have more flavour than normal coffee beans. Like Brazil nuts (a seed) and white rice, coffee beans consist mostly of endosperm.|$|E
2500|$|As {{his gang}} {{branched}} out into {{bigger and more}} complicated [...] "big cons" [...] that attracted a more well-to-do clientele, Lou Blonger found he no longer needed his saloon and the relatively small take it provided from card and dice games. Eventually he moved into headquarters in the American National Bank building on Seventeenth Street and styled himself as a mining magnate. A crucial moment {{in the development of}} the bunco gang was Blonger's partnership in 1904 with Adolph W. Duff, who had operated his own gang of confidence men in Colorado Springs before being run out of town by the police. With Duff handling the details of coordinating gang members and scheduling locations for the scams, Blonger was free to conduct the business of schmoozing public officials and bribing law enforcement, all while cultivating the image of a model citizen. In the summertime he made the rounds of friendly politicians and policemen, paying off favors with boxes <b>of</b> <b>cherries</b> from his orchard in suburban Lakewood.|$|E
