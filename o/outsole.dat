25|$|The <b>outsole</b> is {{the layer}} in {{direct contact with}} the ground. Dress shoes often have leather or resin rubber outsoles; casual or work-oriented shoes have outsoles made of natural rubber or a {{synthetic}} material like polyurethane. The <b>outsole</b> may comprise a single piece, or may be an assembly of separate pieces, often of different materials. On some shoes, the heel of the sole has a rubber plate for durability and traction, while the front is leather for style. Specialized shoes will often have modifications on this design: athletic or so called cleated shoes like soccer, rugby, baseball and golf shoes have spikes embedded in the <b>outsole</b> to improve traction.|$|E
25|$|The midsole is {{the layer}} {{in between the}} <b>outsole</b> and the insole, {{typically}} there for shock absorption. Some types of shoes, like running shoes, have additional material for shock absorption, usually beneath the heel of the foot, where one puts the most pressure down. Some shoes {{may not have a}} midsole at all.|$|E
25|$|Demi-pointe {{shoes are}} most often used to train dancers who are new to pointe technique. They serve to {{acclimate}} dancers to the feel of wearing pointe shoes and to strengthen the ankles and feet in preparation for dancing en pointe in pointe shoes. The toe box allows the dancer to experience {{the feel of a}} pointe shoe, while the insole and <b>outsole</b> work together to provide the resistance needed for developing foot and ankle strength.|$|E

25|$|All shoes have a sole, {{which is}} {{the bottom of a}} shoe, in contact with the ground. Soles can be made from a variety of materials, {{although}} most modern shoes have soles made from natural rubber, polyurethane, or polyvinyl chloride (PVC) compounds. Soles can be simple— a single material in a single layer— or they can be complex, with multiple structures or layers and materials. When various layers are used, soles may consist of an insole, midsole, and an <b>outsole.</b>|$|E
25|$|The medial is {{the part}} of the shoe closest to a person's center of symmetry, and the lateral is on the {{opposite}} side, away from their center of symmetry. This can be in reference to either the <b>outsole</b> or the vamp. Most shoes have shoelaces on the upper, connecting the medial and lateral parts after one puts their shoes on and aiding in keeping their shoes on their feet. In 1968, Puma SE introduced the first pair of sneakers with Velcro straps in lieu of shoelaces, and these became popular by the 1980s, especially among children and the elderly.|$|E

50|$|With his November 2014 {{launch of}} the Timberland Tires brand, Sareen {{announced}} a take back and recycling program to convert worn Timberland Tires into new <b>outsoles</b> of Timberland footwear. Liberty Tire Recycling will collect worn Timberland Tires {{after they have been}} changed out at authorized Timberland locations and sort the tires at its consolidation centers. From there, the used tires will be shipped to a North American tire recycling facility where they will be recycled into crumb rubber and further processed into sheet rubber for use in Timberland® footwear. The rubber will be mixed into an approved compound for <b>outsoles</b> that will ultimately be incorporated into Timberland® boots and shoes.|$|R

5000|$|Hoka One One [...] is an {{athletic}} shoe company that designs and markets running shoes.

5000|$|Released in 2010, the Nike Zoom KD III {{featured}} Flywire {{along the}} lateral forefoot with leather and woven mesh. The tongue featured a pull ring, {{surrounded by the}} letter [...] "d" [...] of the KD logo. Along the medial midfoot, an [...] "H" [...] shaped strap that has two eyelets positioned by column to provide support and lockdown fit. The midsole featured a Nike Zoom forefoot unit encased in lightweight Phylon midsole. The <b>outsole</b> featured a solid rubber <b>outsole</b> with a herringbone pattern. The heel has a cutaway to reveal the Phylon midsole in the <b>outsole</b> for compression. There is a solid rubber wrapped around the heel for durability, but most wearers found it uncomfortable for some reason that when the heel strikes the floor, the foot ends up hitting the rubber piece, which is hard.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{proposes a}} {{methodology}} to assess commercial and lab-scale materials for any specific application on {{the aggregate of}} technical performance, environmental impact and economic impact where fragmented, uncertain and incomplete data is available. The methodology combines a material decision-making framework for technical performance and economic impact with early-stage chemical assessment methods for environmental impact using publically available data. The methodology is applied to a comparative case study where injection-molded bio- and petro-based polyamides are tested for application in soccer shoe <b>outsoles.</b> The results show that partially bio-based PA 6. 10 performs better than bio-based PA 11 and petro-based PA 12 using the proposed methodology. In addition, the case study shows that bio-based polyamides are better for the environment {{and do not necessarily}} have higher cost or compromise technical performance. Additionally, the sensitivity analysis performed on the case study results shows that the outcome does not change when changing the weighting factors, which have the largest effect on the end results. This shows that the proposed methodology provides a correct indication that PA 6. 10 is the best material for use in soccer shoe <b>outsoles...</b>|$|R
5000|$|This type of shoe {{generally}} has a soft <b>outsole</b> (as {{compared with a}} road shoe) and a molded internal midsole. They are shaped more like a street or trail shoe with a less exaggerated [...] "rocker" [...] allowing a more normal gait. The <b>outsole</b> usually has a lugged pattern which is like a day hiking boot and is a compromise between an aggressive off shoe and an old-style touring shoe. These shoes have a molded midsole which protects the rider's foot from the pedal and transfers energy more evenly without a pressure point at the exact shoe/pedal contact points. It also allows for the attachment of a clipless pedal cleat and can {{be more or less}} walked in normally. There is almost always a rectangular cutout in the <b>outsole</b> where a piece of the <b>outsole</b> material is removed by the purchaser or bicycle store, under which is the midsole and two oval slots where the cleats are bolted on. Most of these cleats follow Shimano's [...] "SPD" [...] system. Other two-bolt cleat and pedal systems for use with casual cycling and MTB shoes are produced by Crank Brothers, Speedplay and Ritchey, to name a few. Casual cycling shoes normally have a US retail price of under $100. Sizes range from 35 to 50 in European sizing.|$|E

50|$|PEBA {{is found}} in the sports {{equipment}} market: for damping system components and <b>outsoles</b> of high end shoes (running, track & field, football, baseball, basketball, trekking, etc.) where it is appreciated for its low density, damping properties, energy return and flexibility. PEBA is also appreciated by winter sports participants as it enables design of the lightest alpine and Nordic ski boots while providing some resistance to extreme environment (low temperatures, UV exposure, moisture). It is used in various other sports applications such as racquet grommets and golf balls.|$|R
50|$|Today, Altama Footwear and Wellco Footwear are two American combat boot {{companies}} who still manufacture the US military jungle boot. Altama began manufacturing boots {{for the military}} {{towards the end of}} the Vietnam War, in 1969, and is still supplying the military with footwear to date. Wellco gained the first government contract for boots in 1965. These companies manufacture jungle boots with waterproof insoles and Vibram or Panama <b>outsoles</b> with green cotton/nylon uppers and conventional eyelets. Both companies also make an updated version with a black Cordura upper and a Speedlace-and-eyelet lacing system. The company Atalaia manufactures jungle boots for the Brazilian Army.|$|R
5000|$|Havaianas is a Brazilian {{brand of}} {{flip-flop}} sandals created by Scotsman Robert Fraser in 1962. It is currently owned by Brazilian manufacturing company Alpargatas.

The name Havaianas {{is derived from the}} feminine form of the Portuguese word for [...] "Hawaiians", and the pattern on the soles of the sandals is designed to resemble the straw soles of zōri. Originally, all Havaianas featured white insoles with colored <b>outsoles</b> and straps. Because of their simplicity and low price, the sandals became popular with Brazil's lowest social classes.|$|R
