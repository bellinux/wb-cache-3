30|$|Clinical findings, {{anterior}} segment photographs, corneal endothelial changes, {{and medical}} treatment of corneal wasp sting-induced panuveitis are presented. A 95 -year-man was stung by a wasp {{on his left}} cornea. A severe conjunctival hyperemia, marked corneal edema, corneal epithelial defect, and uveitis developed. As soon as the patient visited our clinic, topical corticosteroid and antibiotics were given, but corneal endothelial damage and uveitis did not improve. Anterior chamber irrigation was performed with <b>oxiglutatione</b> solution to rinse out the wasp venom. Corneal edema and anterior uveitis improved but the endothelial cell density gradually decreased and the vitreous opacity deteriorated. Therefore, a 23 -gauge vitrectomy was performed. Subsequently, the corneal edema and panuveitis improved.|$|E
