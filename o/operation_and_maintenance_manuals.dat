50|$|A Technical Data Management System (TDMS) is {{essentially}} a Document management system (DMS) pertaining to the management of technical and engineering drawings and documents. Often the data are contained in 'records' of various forms, such as on paper, microfilms or digital media. Hence technical data management is also concerned with record management involving technical data. Proper Technical Document Management Systems are essential for executions within large organisations with large scale projects involving engineering. For example, TDMS is a vital function for the successful management of Integrated Steel Plants (ISP), Automobile factories, Aero-space facilities, Infrastructure companies, City Corporations, Research Organisations, etc. In such organisations, Technical Archives or Technical Documentation Centres are created as central facilities for effective management of technical data and records.TDMS functions are {{similar to that of}} conventional archive functions in concepts, except that the archived materials in this case are essentially engineering drawings, survey maps, technical specifications, plant and equipment data sheets, feasibility reports, project reports, <b>operation</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>manuals,</b> standards, etc.|$|E

40|$|Lakvijaya {{power station}} {{is the first}} coal fired power station in Sri Lanka having an {{installed}} capacity of 300 MW. During 2012, it has supplied 18 % of the Sri Lankan energy demand. The availability factor of this power station in 2012 was 68. 8 %. This is rather high compared with the average availability factor of coal powered power stations in {{countries in the region}} falls between 65 % - 90 %. According to the contract document, the availability factor of this plant has been expected as 85 % [1]. However, there is a strong public opinion created by media that the plant is unreliable and prone to frequent failures. Therefore, any improvement in the availability of the power station will result in improving the public image as well as reducing overall costs spent on more expensive fuels. This research aims at critically analyzing the Auxiliary Systems of the power plant to identify their contribution to the reduction of plant availability and propose means of improving overall availability through increasing the reliability of auxiliary systems. Data related to outages were collected from plant operational logs and defect reportsfrom 22. 12. 2010 to 09. 06. 2012. Existing systems and layouts were studied referring to plant <b>operation</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>manuals</b> and by field observations. Analyzing thedata, it was found that failures and unsatisfactory performance in the auxiliary systems havecontributed to the low availability of the power plant by delaying re-starts after failures and reducing the plant capacity while in operation. Failures and problems in auxiliary systems such as The Sea Water Pre-Treatment System, De-salination System, De-mineralization System, Chlorination System and the Hydrogen Production and Storage System were critically analyzed during this research and improvements to the designs are proposed based on the results. The present availability factor of 21 % of the De-salination System can be improved to 91 % by carrying out the proposals made by this research. The availability factor of other systems too can be improved above 90 % using the results. Estimated total cost of the proposals is Rs. 543 Million. However, by implementing themRs. 2. 7 Billion is expected to be saved annually, by reducing the operating and maintenance costs of auxiliary systems and improving the availability of the power plant. Expected payback period is only 2 ½ months. Therefore, the proposed modifications are extremely desirable and cost effective. They will make a good financial contribution due to the expected savings while improving the reliability and the public image of the power plant...|$|E

40|$|SOH see {{significant}} benefit in digitising its drawings and <b>operation</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>manuals.</b> Since SOH do not currently have digital {{models of the}} Opera House structure or other components, {{there is an opportunity}} for this national case study to promote the application of Digital Facility Modelling using standardized Building Information Models (BIM) ”. The digital modelling element of this project examined the potential of building information models for Facility Management focusing on the following areas: • The re-usability of building information for FM purposes • BIM as an Integrated information model for facility management • Extendibility of the BIM to cope with business specific requirements • Commercial facility management software using standardised building information models • The ability to add (organisation specific) intelligence to the model • A roadmap for SOH to adopt BIM for FM The project has established that BIM – building information modelling - is an appropriate and potentially beneficial technology for the storage of integrated building, maintenance and management data for SOH. Based on the attributes of a BIM, several advantages can be envisioned: consistency in the data, intelligence in the model, multiple representations, source of information for intelligent programs and intelligent queries. The IFC – open building exchange standard – specification provides comprehensive support for asset and facility management functions, and offers new management, collaboration and procurement relationships based on sharing of intelligent building data. The major advantages of using an open standard are: information can be read and manipulated by any compliant software, reduced user “lock in” to proprietary solutions, third party software can be the “best of breed” to suit the process and scope at hand, standardised BIM solutions consider the wider implications of information exchange outside the scope of any particular vendor, information can be archived as ASCII files for archival purposes, and data quality can be enhanced as the now single source of users’ information has improved accuracy, correctness, currency, completeness and relevance. SOH current building standards have been successfully drafted for a BIM environment and are confidently expected to be fully developed when BIM is adopted operationally by SOH. There have been remarkably few technical difficulties in converting the House’s existing conventions and standards to the new model based environment. This demonstrates that the IFC model represents world practice for building data representation and management (see Sydney Opera House – FM Exemplar Project Report Number 2005 - 001 -C- 3, Open Specification for BIM: Sydney Opera House Case Study). Availability of FM applications based on BIM is in its infancy but focussed systems are already in operation internationally and show excellent prospects for implementation systems at SOH. In addition to the generic benefits of standardised BIM described above, the following FM specific advantages can be expected from this new integrated facilities management environment: faster and more effective processes, controlled whole life costs and environmental data, better customer service, common operational picture for current and strategic planning, visual decision-making and a total ownership cost model. Tests with partial BIM data – provided by several of SOH’s current consultants – show that the creation of a SOH complete model is realistic, but subject to resolution of compliance and detailed functional support by participating software applications. The showcase has demonstrated successfully that IFC based exchange is possible with several common BIM based applications through {{the creation of a new}} partial model of the building. Data exchanged has been geometrically accurate (the SOH building structure represents some of the most complex building elements) and supports rich information describing the types of objects, with their properties and relationships...|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} is a Fire and Life Safety Report on the Taylor Place Dormitory located in Phoenix, Arizona {{as part of}} the Arizona State University (ASU) downtown campus. The building was evaluated on a prescriptive basis based on the current City of Phoenix building codes and further evaluated on using performance based methods from the Society of Fire Protection Engineers (SFPE) Handbook and National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 101 Life Safety Code®. These building features and systems were evaluated using prescriptive methods: General construction, fire resistive construction and fire resistive separations Occupancy, Life safety features and building egress Smoke management systems and features Fire protection systems, fire sprinkler, suppression systems, fire alarm Emergency and standby power, elevators, communication systems, and lighting A performance-based analysis of the South Tower and Ground Floor Cafeteria and Assembly space using NFPA 101 Life Safety Code® Chapter 5 as a guide. The analysis of the South Tower was based on NFPA 5. 5. 3. 1 and a typical fire for the occupancy accounting for occupants, number and location, room sizes, contents, fuel properties, ventilations, and identifying the location of the item ignited. The analysis of the Ground Floor Cafeteria and Assembly Area was based on NFPA 5. 5. 3. 2 and an ultra-fast fire in the primary means of egress reducing the overall means of egress by two double door exits. These scenarios are analyzed using tenability criteria to determine if with the given the design fire, all occupants can exit safely. Taylor Place generally meets or exceeds the prescriptive requirements for the system described above provided in the building code. Two specific areas were identified requiring further analysis: the corridor and two-story vertical opening separation is not provided in the South Tower per PBC Section 712, and the reduction in the door size of the south egress corridor on the ground floor. Both of these issues were addressed in conjunction with the performance based analysis and found to be acceptable with the current set of performance based recommendations. The performance-based analysis was largely successful. The analysis of the ground floor egress given an ultrafast fire located near the southwest corner of the assembly space found occupants Required Safe Egress Time (RSET) was greater than the Available Safe Egress Time (ASET) meaning all occupants egressed safely. The visibility was lost in the cafeteria which caused the failure of the tenability criteria and the determination of the ASET. The second analysis of the two-story vertical common area in the south tower failed the tenability criteria for visibility during the first two evaluations. It was determined that the two furniture standards {{as part of the}} ASU design guidelines varied greatly in fire behavior and smoke production. As a result, the furniture in the common areas meet the recommended requirements, the corridors will not require separation from the common area. As part of the evaluation process, there are additional recommendations in the report including the addition low level egress signage in the corridors to aid egress, a smoke barrier in the entrance lobby, and the reasons are discussed in more detail in the report. Comments and recommendations {{can be found at the}} end of each section providing additional detail in specific areas. The end of the report focuses on Commissioning of fire protection and building systems. A team is needed to effectively test all of the fire protection systems in accordance with their performance requirements. Functional tests performed on each system to ensure each systems were installed correctly. For example, stair pressurization systems can rely on several fans to pressurize each stairwell. A functional test will typically quickly reveal problem areas and you may even find a motor running backwards. Valuable information is provided from this stage in the project to identify maintenance requirements and finalize documentation. Fire fighter operation overviews need to be assembled, <b>operation</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>manuals</b> need to be created for building staff, and fire safety plans need to be implemented.

Like the first progress report, this second quarterly progress report contains a brief summary of the more important findings obtained thus far and descriptions of in-progress efforts. In the first report it was stated that all of the in-plant flow meters were in serious need of calibration and this was an impediment to progress. We are pleased to report that this is no longer the case. At approximately the beginning of September, all of the in-plant flow meters were apparently calibrated. This has allowed us to make increased progress on Task 2. Since the first quarterly progress report we have continued to collect and analyze a large quantity of samples from the treatment plant in order to characterize all process streams (Task 1). In this report, these data are presented and summary calculations of treatment efficiency have been prepared for primary clarification, activated sludge, secondary clarification, and dissolved air flotation thickening (DAFT). We have also been able to prepare preliminary solids balances for the entire plant under current conditions and under more desirable conditions (smaller sludge wasting rate and higher efficiency DAFT operation). Based upon the results of process monitoring efforts, planning and/or implementation of several mini-studies have been initiated as in-progress efforts (Task 6) including: a DAFT performance study, an anoxic selector study, a bioaugmentation study, and an activated sludge stress test.

The cantons of Corredores and Golfito, {{located in}} the {{southern}} region, dump their solid waste in a "garbage dump". The environmental issue that revolves around waste disposal without previous treatment is serious. This {{is due to the}} generation of highly polluting leachate, gases, unpleasant odors, insect proliferation, rodents and birds. It also implies risks to public health for the presence of waste collectors exposed to unsuitable conditions. The design of a landfill with the main technical components, would allow to both municipalities properly dispose their waste. The beneficiaries would be the Municipality of Corredores, the Municipality of Golfito and the population of the region that receives the Collection solid waste service. For this reason, the general objective of this project is to design the main technical requirements of the landfill for disposal and treatment of the solid waste generated in the cantons of Corredores and Golfito.
