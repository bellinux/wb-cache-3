Causes of damage may include trauma, surgery, tumours, and compression at the jugular foramen. Weakness in both muscles may point to a more general disease process such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Guillain-Barre syndrome or poliomyelitis.|$|E

5|$|In 1915, the SS Eastland capsized while docked in the Chicago River, {{with the}} loss of over 800 lives.

Even with 7,500 sandbags (simulating passengers) piled <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>side,</b> <b>and</b> tugboats pulling in that direction, she listed only 12 degrees. Columbus was featured at the Century of Progress exhibition in Chicago in 193233.|$|E

5|$|Somewhere in {{the years}} 416â€“415 BC, a complex {{struggle}} took place between Hyperbolos <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>and</b> Nicias and Alcibiades on the other. Hyperbolos tried {{to bring about the}} ostracism of one of this pair, but Nicias and Alcibiades combined their influence to induce the people to expel Hyperbolos instead. This incident reveals that Nicias and Alcibiades each commanded a personal following, whose votes were determined by the wishes of the leaders.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Bautzen (or Battle of Budziszyn, April 1945) {{was one of}} {{the last}} battles of the Eastern Front during World War II. It was fought on the extreme {{southern}} flank of the Spremberg-Torgau Offensive, seeing days of pitched street fighting between forces of the Polish Second Army and elements of the Soviet 52nd Army and 5th Guards Army <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>and</b> elements of German Army Group Center in the form of the remnants of the 4th Panzer and 17th armies on the other.|$|E
5|$|The {{boundary}} line was nonetheless still {{fairly easy to}} cross. Local inhabitants were able to maintain fields on the other side, or even to live <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>and</b> work on the other. Refugees were able to sneak across or bribe the guards, and the smuggling of goods in both directions was rife. The flow of emigrants remained large despite the increase in East German security measures: 675,000people fled to West Germany between 1949 and 1952.|$|E
5|$|They also {{expressed}} disbelief that slabs would split so smoothly, or that {{one half of}} a slab containing fossils would have good preservation, but not the counterslab. These are common properties of Solnhofen fossils, because the dead animals would fall onto hardened surfaces, which would form a natural plane for the future slabs to split along and would leave {{the bulk of the}} fossil <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>and</b> little on the other.|$|E
60|$|The {{struggle}} {{which was}} approaching was a gigantic <b>one.</b> <b>On</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> were France <b>and</b> Spain, open to attack <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> only, <b>and</b> holding moreover Flanders, and almost {{the whole of}} Italy, with the rich treasures of the Indies upon which to draw for supplies.

5|$|According to U.S. officials, bin Laden {{was buried}} at sea because no country would accept his remains. Before {{disposing}} of the body, the U.S. called the Saudi government, who approved of burying {{the body in}} the ocean. Muslim religious rites were performed aboard Carl Vinson in the North Arabian Sea within 24 hours of bin Laden's death. Preparations began at 10:10am local time and at-sea burial was completed at 11am. The body was washed, wrapped in a white sheet and placed in a weighted plastic bag. An officer read prepared religious remarks which were translated into Arabic by a native speaker. Afterward, bin Laden's body was placed onto a flat board. The board was tilted upward <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>and</b> the body slid off into the sea.|$|E
5|$|After World War II the United States and the Soviet Union jockeyed {{for power}} during {{what became known}} as the Cold War, driven by an ideological divide between {{capitalism}} and communism and, according to the school of geopolitics, a divide between the maritime Atlantic and the continental Eurasian camps. They dominated the military affairs of Europe, with the U.S. and its NATO allies <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>and</b> the USSR and its Warsaw Pact allies on the other. The U.S. developed a policy of containment towards the expansion of communist influence. While the U.S. and Soviet Union engaged in proxy wars and developed powerful nuclear arsenals, the two countries avoided direct military conflict.|$|E
5|$|After {{rounding}} Mission Point, M-185 continues north-northwesterly {{along the}} eastern shore of Mackinac Island, first passing Dwightwood Spring then the Arch Rock viewing area just beyond the mile1 marker. The next two miles (3.2km) of M-185 are relatively isolated and devoid of major landmarks as the highway rounds Hennepin Point and runs along Voyageur's Bay. Other than a few picnic tables, the only feature between Arch Rock and mile3 is the Lake Shore Nature Trail, a short interpretive trail on the inland side of the road. Just beyond mile3, Scott's Shore Road, a short gravel-surfaced connecting roadway between Lake Shore Road and Scott's Road, departs inland near Point St. Clair. M-185 is bounded by the interior woods <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>and</b> the beaches and rocky shores on the other through this area.|$|E

5|$|Analysis of {{mitochondrial}} DNA {{has also}} revealed two distinct lineages within this species, one occupying the western Atlantic {{and the other}} occupying the eastern Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans. This suggests that Indo-Pacific blacktip sharks are descended {{from those in the}} eastern Atlantic, while the western Atlantic sharks became isolated by the widening Atlantic Ocean <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>and</b> the formation of the Isthmus of Panama on the other. Blacktip sharks from these two regions differ in morphology, coloration, and life history characteristics, and the eastern Atlantic lineage may merit species status. Fossil teeth belonging to this species have been found in Early Miocene (2316 Ma) deposits in Delaware and Florida.|$|E
5|$|Baseball {{has also}} {{inspired}} {{the creation of}} new cultural forms. Baseball cards were introduced in the late 19th century as trade cards. A typical example would feature an image of a baseball player <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>and</b> advertising for a business on the other. In the early 1900s they were produced widely as promotional items by tobacco and confectionery companies. The 1930s saw the popularization of the modern style of baseball card, with a player photograph accompanied on the rear by statistics and biographical data. Baseball cardsâ€”many of which are now prized collectiblesâ€”are the source of the much broader trading card industry, involving similar products for different sports and non-sports-related fields.|$|E
5|$|Directed by Bo Johan Renck, the {{accompanying}} music video was filmed at Ealing Studios in London on 17 August 2000. Renck had to specially edit the video because All Saints requested that each member shoot their scenes separately {{as they were}} not on speaking terms at the time. According {{to a report by}} the Daily Mirror, the group formed two camps with the Appletons <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>side,</b> <b>and</b> Lewis and Blatt on the other. Bullet time effects similar to that from the 1999 film The Matrix were used, being considered state of the art at the time. The video aired on 4 September 2000 to heavy rotation from MTV Europe.|$|E
