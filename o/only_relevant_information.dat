The Greek scholar Konstantinos Varzos places his birth approximately in 1170. Michael is first mentioned on 14 February 1190, when he, along with other imperial relatives, served as a hostage to Frederick I Barbarossa (r. 1152–90) during the passage of the Third Crusade through Byzantine territory. He then went on to serve as governor (doux and anagrapheus) of the theme of Mylasa and Melanoudion in Asia Minor during the last years of Isaac II's first reign, with the rank of pansebastos sebastos. Alexios III re-appointed him to the same province, probably in 1200. Demetrios Polemis, in his study on the Doukas family, reports that he was reappointed to the post by Alexios IV (r. 1203–04), but as Varzos remarks, this is evidently an error by Polemis. In early 1201, for unknown reasons, Michael rose in revolt against the emperor. Alexios III campaigned against him in the summer 1201 and defeated him, forcing Michael to seek refuge at the court of the Seljuk Turk Sultan of Rûm, Süleymanshah II (r. 1196–1204). In his service he led Turkish raids into Byzantine territory around the Maeander River valley.|$|E

There is, in other words, an important link between the information required and the function of the representative. Often the requirement of [...] "relevance" [...] means relevance to the performance of a specific task.|$|E
50|$|Norbert Schwarz is {{also well}} known for his {{research}} on cognitive processes underlying survey response. This work generally treats the survey interview context as a conversation between the researcher and the respondent. According to this logic, surveys are governed by the cooperative principle advanced by Paul Grice, the late philosopher of language. Put simply, the cooperative principle states that people try to communicate clearly and truthfully, in as much detail as required (but not more so), giving <b>only</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>information.</b> In Schwarz's view, the respondent not only follows the Gricean maxims (Quality, Quantity, Relation, and Manner) when responding to surveys but also assumes that the questions the interviewer asks are guided by the same principles.|$|E
50|$|For {{project and}} order {{processing}} management, business processes are designed as workflows, and will assume the automated coordination of all communication. With the form-server of the workflow-system, variable user interfaces for staff, customers or suppliers can be generated, so they always get <b>only</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>information.</b> Different user-logins enable a retrieval of individual forms within one process. The main application {{for the system}} is knowledge-based business processes, in which many people are involved and virtual results are produced, e.g. in research or product development and also for all services or media products, like TV and movies. Broadcasters and media companies such as MDR, Puls 4, Yle, Sony and Warner use CEITON to control their production processes for products and services and coordinate complex workflows {{with all kinds of}} resources involved.|$|E

50|$|Federation (inter-communication):In this case, the EAI system {{acts as the}} {{overarching}} facade across multiple applications. All event calls from the 'outside world' {{to any of the}} applications are front-ended by the EAI system.

5000|$|Subsequently, {{competing}} {{theories of}} attention {{have come to}} dominate visual search discourse. The environment contains {{a vast amount of}} information. We are limited in the amount of information we are able to process at any one time, so it is therefore necessary that we have mechanisms by which extraneous stimuli can be filtered and <b>only</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>information</b> attended to. In the study of attention, psychologists distinguish between preattentitive and attentional processes. Preattentive processes are evenly distributed across all input signals, forming a kind of [...] "low-level" [...] attention. Attentional processes are more selective and can only be applied to specific preattentive input. A large part of the current debate in visual search theory centres on selective attention and what the visual system is capable of achieving without focal attention.|$|E
50|$|One theory {{regarding}} selective {{attention is}} the cognitive load theory, {{which states that}} there are two mechanisms that affect attention: cognitive and perceptual. The perceptual considers the subject’s ability to perceive or ignore stimuli, both task-related and non task-related. Studies show that if there are many stimuli present (especially if they are task-related), {{it is much easier to}} ignore the non-task related stimuli, but if there are few stimuli the mind will perceive the irrelevant stimuli as well as the relevant. The cognitive refers to the actual processing of the stimuli. Studies regarding this showed that the ability to process stimuli decreased with age, meaning that younger people were able to perceive more stimuli and fully process them, but were likely to process both relevant and irrelevant information, while older people could process fewer stimuli, but usually processed <b>only</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>information.</b>|$|E

By dynamically providing the <b>only</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>information</b> from a suitable viewpoint, our adaptive visual support method helps operators to effectively teleoperate working robot in a shorter period of time.|$|E
