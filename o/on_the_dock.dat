5|$|The {{steamship}} Celtic {{pulled into}} New York Harbor on September 23, carrying Kalākaua, Judd, Macfarlane, and von Oelhoffen. Awaiting them <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> were Armstrong, Hawaiian consul general Elisha Hunt Allen, Jr. and Claus Spreckels. New York was in mourning over the September 19 death of President Garfield. Out of {{respect to the}} solemnity of the tragedy, Kalākaua attended no public or private functions in the city. The royal party did, however, spend a day as private tourists at Coney Island.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the main}} canal was {{replaced}} by the railway, Kymer's dock continued to be used for the transfer of coal to coastal ships for another 50 years. Principal destinations included Laugharne, Carmarthen, St Clears and Llanstephan. The Kidwelly Corporation took out a lease <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> in 1872, and the railway built a branch to it in 1873, which ran alongside the old canal. Most of the traffic had transferred to the railway by 1914, but some coasters continued to transport coal; the last recorded sailing was in the early 1920s, and was bound for Llanstephan.|$|E

5|$|The paralyzed Hamilton, {{who knew}} {{himself to be}} mortally wounded, was ferried to the Greenwich Village home of his friend William Bayard Jr., who had been waiting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dock.</b> After final visits from {{his family and friends}} and {{considerable}} suffering, Hamilton died at two o'clock the following afternoon, July 12, 1804, at Bayard's home at what is now 80–82 Jane Street. Gouverneur Morris gave the eulogy at his funeral and secretly established a fund to support his widow and children. Hamilton was buried in the Trinity Churchyard Cemetery in Manhattan.|$|E
5|$|Back at home, Grampa babysits Bart and Lisa, who trick their {{grandfather}} into letting them throw their own party. At the lake the next morning, Homer tries to sneak away to go fishing, but Marge wakes up first. Marge is upset that Homer would choose fishing over their marriage, which Homer fails to understand as he visualizes Marge {{turning into a}} catfish. Homer takes a walk instead of returning to bed. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>dock,</b> he finds an abandoned fishing pole. The pole, with General Sherman on the line, yanks him off the pier into a small rowboat, and onto the lake. From their cabin window, Marge watches Homer battle General Sherman and gets frustrated. At home, Bart and Lisa's party has ended and {{the house is a}} total mess. Watching Grampa cry and fearing that he will get in trouble, they frantically clean up the house for him.|$|E
5|$|In 1841 Lady Maria died, and Bute blamed his {{excessive}} focus <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> programme for exacerbating his wife's illness. As {{a result}} of the original marriage agreement, Bute continued to draw the incomes from his late wife's property for the remainder of his life, even though officially the estates would ultimately pass to Maria's sister, Lady Susan, on his own death. He was created a Knight of the Thistle in 1843 by Queen Victoria. In 1845 Bute fell from his horse and injured his eyes further in the accident, making it still harder for him to read and write. Bute remarried the same year, this time to Lady Sophia Rawdon-Hastings, the daughter of the Marquess of Hastings. Sophia was obsessive, hard to please and did not get on well with John's family, especially his brother. She soon became pregnant, but gave birth to a stillborn child; the couple's second child, whom they named John, was successfully born in 1847.|$|E

5|$|Leeds Dock was {{originally}} a large timber dock, situated {{between the city}} centre and Hunslet. Decades of industrial decline left the dock obsolete. The opening of the Royal Armouries Museum in 1996 began the regeneration of the area, however little else was undertaken, until the wider redevelopment began in 2001. This was completed in 2007 (at a cost of £260million) and includes flats, offices, bars, restaurants, a hotel and a casino. The development centres <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> itself as well as around 'Armouries Boulevard' and 'Armouries Square', two pedestrianised thoroughfares. The main office block on the development is Livingston House which has not yet attracted a tenant. The smaller dock incorporates six residential berths for house boats, while a passenger boat service to Granary Wharf runs from here.|$|E

25|$|Once {{the rail}} {{supplies}} were loaded, the {{trip down the}} Columbia and the lakes began on July 3, 1890 at 11:30a.m., as crowds cheered <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> and the nearby steamer Kootenai.

25|$|Walk {{the dog to}} the end of {{the dock}} and or, hold the dog back while {{throwing}} the toy into the water. Walk the dog back to the starting point, place the dog, then release or send the dog to go get the toy.

25|$|The crane {{is driven}} by an {{operator}} who sits in a cabin suspended from the trolley. The trolley runs along rails located on the top or sides of the boom and girder. The operator runs the trolley over the ship to lift the cargo, usually containers. Once the spreader locks onto the container, the container is lifted, moved over the dock, and placed on a truck chassis (trailer) {{to be taken to}} the storage yard. The crane also lifts containers from chassis <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> to load them onto the ship.|$|E

25|$|The {{suburbanization}} of America {{and decline}} of the railroads in the 1950s and 1960s severely affected the market. The market began running on a deficit in 1954, and by 1959 was only 70 percent occupied, forcing Reading to raise rents. The state-of-the-art cold storage facility was shut down and dismantled, forcing tenants to supply their own storage. Several other events hurt the market and its merchants financially. The Dock Street wholesale market was closed and demolished {{as part of the}} urban renewal program in Society Hill. This hurt many resellers at the Reading Market who depended <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dock</b> Street market for inventory.|$|E
25|$|The SS France, {{as one of}} {{the last}} transatlantic ocean liners before the jet era, was also treated as the {{connection}} between, for example, New York and France. This was shown well in Le Gendarme à New York where the main characters sail on the France. The film also shows some of the 60s' interior of the ship. At the conclusion of the 1973 film Serpico, the title character can be seen sitting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> with the vessel behind him, as he prepares to sail on her into exile after testifying against the New York Police Department. During the opening of Dog Day Afternoon, also directed by Sidney Lumet, there is a shot of the France docked in New York during the opening montage.|$|E
25|$|The show {{went into}} hiatus late in 1979 when Garner {{was told by}} his doctors {{to take time off}} because of {{numerous}} knee injuries and back trouble, as well as an ulcer. He sustained the former conditions largely because of his insistence on performing most of his own stunts, especially those involving fist fights or car chases. Because of his physical pain, Garner eventually opted not to continue with the show some months later, and NBC cancelled the program in mid-season. It was alleged that Rockford had become very expensive to produce, mainly due to the location filming and use of high-end actors as guest stars. According to sources, NBC and Universal claimed the show was generating a deficit of several million dollars, a staggering amount for a nighttime show at the time, although Garner and his production team Cherokee Productions claimed the show turned a profit. Garner told a story to Johnny Carson on The Tonight Show that the studio once paid a carpenter $700 to build a shipping crate for a shoot-out on a boat dock, though there were shipping crates <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dock.</b> The script often called for Garner to damage his car, so the car could be sold, repaired, and repurchased for each episode.|$|E
