25|$|She {{returned}} to TNA as a villain at Final Resolution on January 14, 2007, joining forces with James Storm by attacking his manager, Gail Kim. Storm and Moore {{teamed up to}} defeat Kim and Petey Williams at both Against All Odds and Destination X. Moore, however, was defeated by Kim at Lockdown in TNA's first women's steel cage match. Later, during a Street Fight with Kim on Impact!, Moore's two front teeth were knocked out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b> Throughout early and mid-2008, she continued to participate in women's matches, but failed to obtain the TNA Knockouts Championship. She then managed Beer Money, Inc. (Storm and Robert Roode), before being removed from television {{to work as a}} backstage agent. On June 19, 2009 she {{returned to}} in-ring action, defeating Rhaka Khan at a house show in Grand Rapids, Michigan. On July 12, 2009, however TNA parted ways with Moore.|$|E

Soon she began to pull other [...] "trash" [...] out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth,</b> {{including}} straw, coal, gravel, chicken feathers, and cinders. During her fits she was sometimes heard to be talking to the invisible Catherine Campbell, pleading for a return to their former friendship.|$|E

500|$|Kaali {{is portrayed}} mostly in two forms: the popular four-armed {{form and the}} ten-armed Mahakaali form. In both of her forms, she is {{described}} as being black in colour but is most often depicted as blue in popular Indian art. [...] Her eyes are described as red with intoxication, and in absolute rage, her hair is shown disheveled, small fangs sometimes protrude out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth,</b> and her tongue is lolling. She is often just wearing a skirt made of human arms and a garland of human heads. She is also accompanied by serpents and a jackal while standing on the calm and prostrate Shiva, usually right foot forward to symbolize the more popular Dakshinamarga or right-handed path, {{as opposed to the}} more infamous and transgressive Vamamarga or left-handed path.|$|E
500|$|Angie Pintero (Alex Bruhanski), {{the owner}} of a bowling alley, tells one of his employees, an autistic man named Harold Spuller (Steven M. Porter), to go home for the evening. Shortly thereafter, Angie discovers a badly-injured blond girl wedged inside of the {{automated}} pinsetter. The girl attempts to speak, but no words come out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b> Angie notices police in a nearby parking lot and rushes outside to get help. He realizes a crowd has gathered around the dead body of the same girl he saw only moments earlier in the bowling alley. Angie relates his bizarre tale to Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson). Mulder suspects that Angie encountered the dead girl's ghost; three similar encounters, and three similar murders, were reported in the area in as many weeks. The agents discover the words, [...] "She is me" [...] written on the bowling lane where Angie saw the spirit, but its meaning remains a mystery.|$|E

500|$|The song {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. Melinda Newman of HitFix {{said it was}} [...] "a bit snoozy", however complemented Twain's reasonably strong vocals. Newman added, [...] "She’s not pushing or belting in any way, but she’s upfront and center. However, her delivery is hardly the peppy rallying call that the lyrics call for and if a song ever demanded to be uptempo, this would be it." [...] Sean Daly of the St. Petersburg Times called the song [...] "a shocking stinkeroo every which way." [...] Daly criticized Twain's vocal delivery, noting she sounded as though she sang through the side <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> much like James Cagney, and said the track reinforced the skeptics who insisted Lange {{was the reason for}} Twain's success. He concluded, [...] "If 'Today Is Your Day' is a sign of things to come, you might want to hold your breath on that comeback." [...] Jenna Hally Rubenstein of MTV was disappointed with [...] "Today Is Your Day", but said she would [...] "take it" [...] following the singer's long absence from music. Rubenstein commented that the song was undoubtedly saccharine, yet Twain's lush and rich voice prevailed.|$|E
500|$|The autobiographical {{story begins}} as a brunette Gaga is taken through a clinic on a stretcher, while an inner {{monologue}} about her past memories is heard. The nurses wear Calvin Klein Collection uniforms and Giuseppe Zanotti shoes. A nurse awakens Gaga and checks her heart rate and blood pressure. The nurse then tells Gaga how beautiful she is and how she looked just like her mother when she delivered the former. Gaga then claims {{that her mother was}} a saint, before taking a cigarette out of her bag. The nurse, startled by this, quickly then takes the cigarette out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> and puts it on a table. Gaga cries and tells the nurse that she will become a star. She asks the nurse to play music and the camera zooms out to show viewers several female patients treated and wandering off. A new scene shows Gaga practicing ballet dancing to piano music, and a following one shows her taken back from the hospital to her New York apartment by her best friend Bo. Ludwig van Beethoven's [...] "Piano Sonata No. 8" [...] plays. Gaga is undressed from an outfit designed by Stéphane Rolland and taken to bed, but is interrupted by a phone call that notifies her of being dropped from her record label. Frustrated, she makes a mess in her apartment, pours breakfast cereal on herself, and jumps in the bath with her heels on. The piano music ends and Gaga is seen bleaching her hair, bathing in a tub, and humming [...] "Marry the Night". The monologue continues as Gaga says, [...] "But I still had my bedazzler and I had a lot of patches, shiny ones from M Trimmings, so I wreaked havoc on some old denim. And I did what any girl would do—I did it all over again." [...] According to Jocelyn Vena of MTV News, Gaga resembles pop artist Madonna in the film Desperately Seeking Susan. Gaga's dancers look down at her from a mezzanine as the clock chimes.|$|E
500|$|Bell {{said that}} at first Anna was written plainer and more general. [...] "In {{the first draft of}} the script she was written more, in my opinion, prissy. She was kind of {{specific}} and very girly," [...] which Bell didn't find appealing. She admitted that she had always {{wanted to be part of}} Disney animated feature, but she [...] "wanted to be a very specific type of princess", who [...] "was way more awkward than the normal princesses", not someone with too good postures or too well-spoken. As she was offered the role of Anna, she came up with a lot of suggestions for the directors. They were responsive and allowed the actress to mould the character the way she wanted, since they wanted the film to be truthful. Bell significantly made specific changes to Anna, including the infusion and incorporation of the actress' own personality to the character, [...] embodying a relatable heroine, which received full support from the directors. She called the scene where Anna first meets Hans is a [...] "typical Disney moment", as they come too close physically and find out that they both fall in love with each other. Bell wanted Anna's words to reflect what she herself would say in real life, which included some [...] "nonsensical rambling". [...] "I think I said, [...] "This is awkward. You're not awkward. Me, I'm awkward. You're gorgeous. Wait—what?" [...] Words just spill out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> too quickly and she has to backtrack." [...] Bell continued. Or the whole scene where she wakes up in the beginning with saliva all over the face, Bell [...] "wanted her to also have hair in her mouth", which took inspiration from her own real life. [...] "Sometimes I wake up like that. Then you have hair in your mouth, and you start coughing. The animators totally got what I was trying to do. It's cool, and way more fun when stuff is realistic like that, instead of the perfection of waking up with mascara on." [...] Anna's snorting and tripping over also drew inspirations from Bell's real life. Bell's recording sessions were also videotaped to assist in animating the character, and animators took into considerations even subtle things like the actress' biting her lip a lot. According to director Jennifer Lee, Anna is a bit flawed.|$|E
6000|$|Inez, encouraged, made fresh {{efforts to}} get forward, but her weary limbs were unequal to the eagerness <b>of</b> <b>her</b> mind; <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> and throat were parched by agony and terror: she gasped for breath, and leaned for support against a rock. [...] "It is all in vain!" [...] exclaimed she; [...] "I feel as though I should faint." ...|$|R

2500|$|The music video, {{directed}} by Jesse Davey, depicts the band playing {{in front of}} a young woman, the [...] "Hollywood Whore" [...] that the song is referring to. Eventually, the woman arises and blood is seen falling from her eyes. The skin and muscle on her face deteriorates and turns to that of a bloody skull, and blood begins to explode out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth,</b> completely drenching the band as they are performing.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2005, Floyd {{caused a}} stir with {{comments}} she made to the LA Times about then-Court TV colleague Nancy Grace. [...] Floyd expressed a concern in the LA Times that Grace presented a televised [...] "rush to judgment" [...] when she said, [...] "I rarely agree with what comes out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth,</b> but it's hard not to like the person," [...] said Floyd, who returned to Court TV's midday programming in 2005 after nearly a decade at ABC News. She {{went on to say}} [...] "We have a lot of guests who come on and mimic Nancy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Her mutant status remains {{hidden from}} the public but is known by Henry [...] "Hank" [...] Pym and S.H.I.E.L.D.. She can {{generate}} a glittering wasp-like sting which she discharges through her hands. Her bio-electric blast, when applied from within the ear to the brain, reverts the Hulk to Bruce Banner during the New York massacre. Side-effects of her insectoid genetics include the occasional consumption of bugs, forming her own larval nests, and laying egg-like constructs. During her college years, she shares a room with Betty Ross and starts seeing Henry. Henry is abusive to her early in their relationship and during college {{is known to have}} hit her at least twice, putting her head through a door on one occasion and splitting the roof <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> on another. Betty can also recall instances where Janet is missing chunks of hair. Janet also suffers from severe bulimia prior to joining the Ultimates.|$|E

2500|$|Searching {{elsewhere}} for a bride, Charles looked to France instead. The English agent Kensington {{was sent to}} Paris in 1624 to examine the potential French match, and the marriage was finally negotiated in Paris by James Hay and Henry Rich. Henrietta Maria was aged just fifteen {{at the time of}} her marriage, but this was not unusually young for royal princesses of the period. Views on Henrietta Maria's appearance vary; her husband's niece, Sophia of Hanover commented that the... "beautiful portraits of Van Dyck had given me such a fine idea of all the ladies of England that I was surprised to see that the queen, who I had seen as so beautiful and lean, was a woman well past her prime. Her arms were long and lean, her shoulders uneven, and some of her teeth were coming out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> like tusks.... She did, however, have pretty eyes, nose, and a good complexion...." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{his article}} [...] "Too Gay for the U.S.A.", Andrew Webster of The Escapist used {{the history of}} Birdo in the lead-in to his article, commenting on how Nintendo tried to hide Birdo's gender confusion, and how [...] "He's {{just one of a}} long line of Japanese {{videogame}} characters forced to hide their true sexual identity". GamesRadar UK listed Birdo as one of [...] "gaming's most repelling anti-babes", describing her as a [...] "pink, egg blowing, transvestite dinosaur with a mouth like a burst fire hose," [...] thereby describing her as [...] "terrifying". Morgan Webb of X-Play created a video titled [...] "Birdo WTF", commenting that everyone initially thought of Birdo as a [...] "cute little dinosaur". She also describes her as a very feminine male character if she really is transgender. Nintendo Power listed Birdo as one of three weirdos, citing her change from being male to being a love interest for Yoshi. They described her gender as one of life's biggest questions, commenting on how she shoots eggs out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> as another oddity. IGN's Lucas M. Thomas commented that Birdo is [...] "the most gender-confused character in the history of Nintendo". He also commented on the relationship Yoshi and Birdo formed in Mario Tennis, stating, [...] "They were both sexually chaotic as individuals" [...] as [...] "Yoshi is supposedly a male, but lays eggs like a female. Birdo is supposedly a female, but was originally called a male." ...|$|E
