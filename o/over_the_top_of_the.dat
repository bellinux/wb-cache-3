5|$|In 1675, John Ogilby {{noted that}} the main {{coaching}} route from London to Southampton ran <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> down, going directly from Alresford to Twyford, avoiding Winchester. This remained the main coaching route until about 1800, when an alternative route via Winchester (now mostly the A31 and former A33) was formed. During this time, {{and up to the}} 19th century, the area was sometimes known as Morestead Down after the nearby village of Morestead.|$|E
5|$|On May 31, 1917, {{the flag}} {{was chosen as}} the state's {{official}} banner. The General Assembly made only one change to Hadley's original design: they added the word Indiana, in a crescent shape, <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> torch. The state banner was later renamed the state's flag in a new statute passed in 1955 that also standardized the dimensions of the flag.|$|E

5|$|Cumulus {{supplementary}} features are most commonly {{seen with the}} species congestus. Cumulus virga clouds are cumulus clouds producing virga (precipitation that evaporates while aloft), and cumulus praecipitatio produce precipitation that reaches the Earth's surface. Cumulus pannus comprise shredded clouds that normally appear beneath the parent cumulus cloud during precipitation. Cumulus arcus clouds have a gust front, and cumulus tuba clouds have funnel clouds or tornadoes. Cumulus pileus clouds refer to cumulus clouds that have grown so rapidly as to force the formation of pileus <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cloud. Cumulus velum clouds have an ice crystal veil over the growing top of the cloud.|$|E
5|$|In the 85thminute, Scholes clipped {{the ball}} <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Barcelona {{defensive}} line to Rooney, who chested {{the ball down}} for Tevez, only to be given offside. Scholes then found Rooney again on the left wing with a raking ball from deep inside his own half, but Rooney's first touch was heavy, allowing Puyol to get back and put the ball out for a corner. Rooney took the corner short to Tevez, whose cross was just {{beyond the reach of}} Berbatov and diverted behind again by Puyol. Rooney also took the second corner, which was met by Berbatov, but he put the ball high over the crossbar.|$|E
5|$|Notable in Western Chalukya {{architecture}} are {{the decorative}} door panels that {{run along the}} length of the door and over on top to form a lintel. These decorations appear as bands of delicately chiseled fretwork, moulded colonettes and scrolls scribed with tiny figures. The bands are separated by deep narrow channels and grooves and run <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> door. The temple plan often included a heavy slanting cornice of double curvature, which projected outward from the roof of the open mantapa. This was intended to reduce heat from the sun, blocking the harsh sunlight and preventing rainwater from pouring in between the pillars. The underside of the cornice looks like woodwork because of the rib-work. Occasionally, a straight slabbed cornice is seen.|$|E

5|$|Only {{six minutes}} later, in the 62nd minute, Stoke had their key chance and only shot on {{target of the}} match with Kenwyne Jones in the 61st minute. A looping ball <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Manchester City defence by Matthew Etherington allowed Jones a one-on-one, but he failed to convert, firing {{straight}} at goalkeeper Joe Hart with the ball ricocheting off both striker and keeper before bobbling to safety. Doubts over Matthew Etherington's fitness resurfaced when he was taken off in the 63rd minute, with Stoke City still in the game at 0–0 as it stood.|$|E
5|$|The navigations often form a {{short cut}} for boaters between the River Nene at Peterborough and the River Great Ouse at Salters Lode Lock. The {{suggested}} route passes through Stanground Sluice, along King's Dyke to Ashline Lock, and then along Whittlesey Dike to Flood's Ferry junction. From here the route is along the old {{course of the}} River Nene, passing through the twin villages of Outwell and Upwell, where the abandoned Wisbech Canal once formed a route back to the new course of the River Nene. The final stretch to Salters Lode lock is along Well Creek, passing <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Middle Level Main Drain on Mullicourt Aqueduct.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} Edge against Batista in a Steel Cage {{match for the}} World Heavyweight Championship, which could be won by pinfall, submission, or {{escaping}} the cage. During {{the first few minutes}} of the contest, Edge attempted to escape the cage many times but Batista stopped him and gained the advantage after a suplex to Edge off the top rope. Edge gained the upper hand late in the contest, performing a spear to Batista, but didn't get the pinfall. Batista regained the advantage and attempted the Batista Bomb, but Edge reversed the move. Edge climbed <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cage while Batista crawled towards the door. Edge's feet hit the arena floor first, and he was declared the winner and retained his title.|$|E

5|$|Thus, {{the route}} chosen {{was a direct}} line between Saugus and Gorman, <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ridge for many miles. Due to cost and {{drainage}} concerns, {{and a desire to}} reduce altering the terrain, the road was built with 697curves, high in the mountains. Construction on the Ridge Route, officially considered to run from Castaic Junction (west of Saugus on the road to Ventura) {{to the bottom of the}} grade at Grapevine, began in 1914. The highway was one of the earliest projects completed by the California Highway Commission. To construct the road, horse-drawn scrapers were used.|$|E
5|$|With half-time fast approaching, Barcelona's {{confidence}} {{began to}} show: first, Messi attempted to flick a pass <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United defence to Thierry Henry, which Rio Ferdinand intercepted; Iniesta then tried an ambitious back-heel that Van der Sar collected; and finally Messi sped through three Manchester United defenders towards the by-line, only for his cut-back cross to be pounced upon by Van der Sar and then cleared by Vidić. On {{the stroke of}} half-time, Iniesta himself then attempted to flick the ball through to Henry, {{but it was just}} too high for the French striker, and referee Massimo Busacca took that cue to blow the whistle for the interval.|$|E
5|$|Construction of a {{connection}} between the river and the Trent and Mersey Canal was begun in 1871 and completed in 1875. Because of the difference in level, a vertical boat lift was designed by Edwin Clark, using counterbalanced tanks which were linked by a hydraulic system. A descending tank caused hydraulic fluid to enter the pistons which raised the other tank. The design was a success, but the fluid became contaminated, resulting in corrosion of the pistons. The lift was replaced by a new design, where each tank was attached to its own counterbalance weight by wire ropes and pulleys, with small electric motors to overcome friction. The new lift was built <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old one, so that it could continue to be used until the new one was ready, and the work was carried out by staff of the Navigation, supervised by the engineer J A Saner. It was completed in 1906, and continued in use until 1983, when it was closed on safety grounds due to corrosion.|$|E

5|$|Investigators {{found that}} as the jet was {{beginning}} its takeoff rotation, engine number one separated from the left wing, flipping <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wing and landing on the runway. As the engine separated from the aircraft, it severed hydraulic lines that locked the wing's leading edge slats in place and damaged a three-foot section of the left wing's leading edge. Aerodynamic forces acting on the wing resulted in an uncommanded retraction of the outboard slats. As the jet began to climb, the damaged left wing, with no engine, produced far less lift (stalled) than the right wing, with its slats still deployed and its engine running at full takeoff speed. The disrupted and unbalanced aerodynamics of the aircraft caused it to roll abruptly to the left until it was partially inverted, reaching a bank angle of 112 degrees, before crashing in an open field by a trailer park {{near the end of}} the runway. The engine separation was attributed to damage to the pylon structure holding the engine to the wing, caused by improper maintenance procedures used at American Airlines.|$|E
5|$|On 8 June 1966, XB-70A No. 2 was {{in close}} {{formation}} {{with four other}} aircraft (an F-4 Phantom, an F-5, a T-38 Talon, and an F-104 Starfighter) for a photoshoot {{at the behest of}} General Electric, manufacturer of the engines of all five aircraft. After the completion of the photoshoot, the F-104 drifted into contact with the XB-70's right wing, flipped over and rolled inverted <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Valkyrie, striking the vertical stabilizers and left wing of the bomber. The F-104 exploded, destroying the Valkyrie's rudders and damaging its left wing. With the loss of both rudders and damage to the wings, the Valkyrie entered an uncontrollable spin and crashed into the ground north of Barstow, California. NASA Chief Test Pilot Joe Walker (F-104 pilot) and Carl Cross (XB-70 co-pilot) were killed. Al White (XB-70 pilot) ejected, sustaining serious injuries, including one arm crushed by the closing clamshell-like escape crew capsule moments prior to ejection.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season saw Milan {{dominate the}} league. Milan {{played host to}} Genoa on 25 September 2010, with Pirlo providing a lifted ball <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> defence to set striker Zlatan Ibrahimović free to score the solitary goal of the game. On 2 October, Pirlo scored a 40-yard goal against Parma to give Milan their first away win of the 2010–11 season. On 14 May 2011, Pirlo appeared in his last match for Milan, coming on as a half-time substitute for Massimo Ambrosini as the club celebrated their Serie A title with a 4–1 victory over Cagliari. Four days later, Pirlo confirmed {{that he would be}} leaving Milan {{at the end of the}} 2010–11 season, after a mutual decision not to renew his contract. In his last season in Milan, Pirlo appeared in the league just 17 times under manager Massimiliano Allegri, notching just one goal and three assists, winning his second Serie A title with Milan that season, also reaching the round of 16 in the Champions League, and in the Coppa Italia semi-final.|$|E

5|$|As Owen Hart {{entered the}} steel cage for his {{championship}} match {{with his brother}} Bret, he immediately attacked Bret. Bret gained the advantage by performing a DDT. Owen kicked Bret {{in the head and}} tried to escape from the cage. The brothers both tried to climb over the cage several times, but neither would let the other escape. The match consisted mainly of brawling, including a couple of occasions when the two exchanged punches while standing on the top rope. Owen climbed over the cage, but Bret dragged him back in by pulling Owen's hair. Owen performed a piledriver on Bret, but Bret came back by throwing Owen into the bars of the cage. As Owen tried to escape, Bret suplexed him back into the ring {{from the top of the}} cage. Owen recovered and performed the Sharpshooter on Bret, but Bret escaped and used the same move on Owen. The match ended after Bret threw Owen's head into the steel cage and Owen's leg became trapped between the cage's bars. Bret climbed <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cage and dropped to the floor to win the match and retain the title. After the match, Jim Neidhart attacked Davey Boy Smith, another brother-in-law of the Hart brothers. Neidhart padlocked the cage, and he and Owen attacked Bret until the other Harts could intervene.|$|E
5|$|The {{start of}} the game was {{postponed}} 80 minutes due to a rain delay, pushing the start time to 9:17p.m. The cast of the television series Glee (with Amber Riley singing lead) performed the national anthem prior to the game {{as part of a}} ceremony featuring a large American flag and several members of the armed services. The Phillies scored first with Jayson Werth's lead-off solo home run, which was followed by a bases-loaded walk and a sacrifice fly to make the score 3–0 {{in the bottom of the}} second inning. Following Mark Teixeira's walk in the top of the fourth inning, Alex Rodriguez hit a deep ball down the right field line. It was originally ruled a double and Teixeira held at third base. The play was reviewed using MLB instant replay, which revealed that the ball had struck a camera sticking <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wall, and the ball was ruled a two-run home run, giving Rodriguez his first World Series hit. This was the first home run reviewed by instant replay in postseason play. Specifically, the ball hit a camera owned by Fox and MLB which extended slightly over the right field wall. The camera was moved back for Game4 such that its lens was in line with the wall. Coincidentally, Alex Rodriguez also had the first regular season home run reviewed by replay.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} a scene of a leopard with glowing blue eyes (later {{revealed}} to be Kesha) walking down an alleyway. The song's title flashes {{on the screen and}} the video pans to Kesha. She walks down the alleyway with two men who grab another man. Kesha spray-paints a dollar sign on his chest. They come to a party where she and her friends flash their tattooed dollar signs on their wrists and forearms in order to enter. As they enter, everyone starts dancing and the party-goers' faces are shown changing into different animals'. In the following scene, Kesha is seen sitting on a chair with two men by her side. Jeffree Star then approaches Kesha. Kesha and Star engage in a choreographed dance battle; Star then shoots Kesha with a laser chain saw which she deflects with her bracelet, Kesha responds by shooting lasers out of her hands, killing Star. After the battle the party-goers crawl around Kesha and she is seen holding a gold cup with a blue foaming liquid spilling <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> glass. As Kesha gives the party goers a drink, their faces turn into different kinds of animals. The video ends with everyone dancing and turning into half animal humans, Kesha however, drinks from the cup and turns back into a leopard.|$|E
