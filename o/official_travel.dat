2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Anderson Cooper on November 3, 2010, when discussing cuts in government spending for Medicare and Social Security suggested by Congressman Paul Ryan, Bachmann was asked what cuts in government spending she would make to reduce the deficit. She cited President Obama's then-upcoming visit to Asia as an example, saying it [...] "is expected to cost the taxpayers $200million a day. He's taking two thousand people with him. He'll be renting out over 870 rooms in India. And these are 5-star hotel rooms at the Taj Mahal Palace hotel. This {{is the kind of}} over-the-top spending, it's a very small example, Anderson." [...] Bachmann was apparently referring to information in a story from the Press Trust of India, attributed to [...] "a top official of the Maharashtra Government privy to the arrangements for the high-profile visit", information that was also published in U.S.-based media such as The Drudge Report. In response to the news report's claim that 34 warships were accompanying the President, a Pentagon spokesman, Geoff Morrell, dismissed the account as [...] "comical". The White House said that the press report figures were [...] "wildly inflated" [...] and had [...] "no basis in reality".

50|$|The {{concept is}} even more {{important}} in espionage. Intelligence may come from many sources, including human sources.

Take for example a scenario where an <b>official</b> is <b>travelling</b> secretly and only one of his aides knows the specific <b>travel</b> plans. The <b>official</b> is assassinated during his travels, and the circumstances of the assassination strongly suggest that the assassin had foreknowledge of the <b>official's</b> <b>travel</b> plans. The probable conclusion is that the official has been betrayed by his aide. There may be no direct evidence linking the aide to the assassin, but collaboration can be inferred on the facts alone, thus making the aide's denial implausible.|$|R
