Three days later Nebraska became the thirty-sixth state to ratify the amendment, providing the two-thirds majority of states required to amend the U.S. Constitution. With the beginning of nationwide Prohibition on January 17, 1920, after formal ratification of the Eighteenth Amendment the previous day, efforts turned to enforcement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>law.</b> Protestant support for Prohibition remained intense in Indiana in the 1920s. Shumaker and the IASL lead a statewide grassroots campaign that successfully passed a new prohibition law for the state. Sponsored by Indiana representative Frank Wright and known as the Wright bone-dry law, it was enacted in 1925. The Wright law {{was part of a}} national trend toward stricter prohibition legislation and imposed severe penalties for alcohol possession.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIntroductionIn 2010, British Columbia (BC) {{introduced}} <b>new</b> traffic <b>laws</b> {{designed to}} deter impaired driving, speeding, and distracted driving. These laws generated significant media attention and {{were associated with}} reductions in fatal crashes and in ambulance calls and hospital admissions for road trauma. ObjectiveTo understand the extent and type of media coverage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> traffic <b>laws</b> and to identify how the laws were framed by the media. MethodsWe reviewed a database of injury related news coverage (May 2010 –December 2012) and extracted reports that mentioned distracted driving, impaired driving, or speeding. Articles were classified according to: (i) Type, (ii) Issue discussed, (iii) ‘Reference to new laws’, and (iv) ‘Pro/anti traffic law’. Articles mentioning <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>laws</b> were reread and common themes in how the laws were framed were identified and discussed. ResultsOver <b>the</b> course <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study, 1848 articles mentioned distraction, impairment, or speeding and 597 reports mentioned <b>the</b> <b>new</b> laws: 65 against, 227 neutral, and 305 supportive. Reports against <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>laws</b> framed them as unfair or as causing economic damage to the entertainment industry. Reports in favor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>laws</b> framed {{them in terms of}} preventing impaired driving and related trauma or of bringing justice to drinking drivers. Growing evidence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>laws</b> generated media support. ConclusionsBC’s <b>new</b> traffic <b>laws</b> generated considerable media attention both pro and con. We believe that this media attention helped inform <b>the</b> public <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>laws</b> and enhanced their deterrent effect...|$|R

25|$|Edward Dorsey {{was convicted}} of unlawfully selling 5.5 grams of crack in 2008. As a prior {{offender}} under the pre-2010 sentencing rules, {{he would have been}} subject to a 10-year minimum; under the new law, he would have been not been subject to any such minimum due to the small nature of his possession. The sentencing judge sentenced Dorsey to the 10-year minimum, applying the old rules because the conviction occurred prior to the effective date <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>law.</b> This was upheld by the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.|$|E

25|$|In 13 April 2016, Jordanian police raided {{and shut}} the Muslim Brotherhood {{headquarters}} in Amman. This comes {{despite the fact that}} the Jordanian branch cut ties with the mother Egyptian group in January 2016, a designated terrorist organization, a move that is considered to be exclusively cosmetic by experts. Jordanian authorities state that the reason of closure is because that the Brotherhood is unlicensed and is using the name of the defectors' licensed group. This comes after the Jordanian senate passed a new legislation for the regulation of political parties in 2014, the Muslim Brotherhood did not adhere by the regulations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>law</b> and so they did not renew their membership.|$|E

25|$|Prior to 1991, the {{electricity}} sector in Argentina was vertically integrated. The sector experienced a serious {{crisis in the}} summers of 1988/1989, primarily {{due to the lack}} of maintenance of the country's thermal power plants (50% were unavailable). Shortly after the crisis, the government of Carlos Menem introduced a new legal framework for {{the electricity}} sector through Law 24,065, which included the following elements: vertical and horizontal unbundling of generation, transmission and distribution; opening up of all segments to the private sector; and separation of the regulatory function from policy setting. As a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>law,</b> there was substantial private investment which, together with the public power plants that started production in the 1990s, transformed a situation of power shortage and low quality into one of abundance and reliability at lower prices.|$|E

When safety and maintenance of the plant meet regulatory guidelines, the operator could request for an extension. Safety standards against earthquakes, tsunamis and other disasters would be revised with the new knowledge and technology in protective measures. Power companies were to comply with the new standards. Approval <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>law</b> by the parliament was scheduled not before the end of January 2012, but ahead of the installation of the new nuclear safety agency in April 2012.|$|E

25|$|In May 2007, a new Federal law {{went into}} effect making interstate dog {{fighting}} activities felonious and providing for imprisonment and imposition of large fines. The Animal Fighting Prohibition Enforcement Act, a new Federal law sponsored by US Senators Arlen Specter (D-PA.), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA.), and John Ensign (R-NV.), was enacted by the U.S. Congress earlier in 2007 and signed by President George W. Bush on May 3, making organizing a dog fight a felony. The law provides a penalty of {{up to three years}} of imprisonment and up to a $250,000 fine for each offense of interstate or foreign transport of animals for fighting purposes. Using the provisions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>law,</b> which took effect immediately, the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is pursuing cases in a number of locations around the country with considerable support from humane societies and local police departments.|$|E
25|$|In 1829, {{slavery was}} officially outlawed in Mexico. Austin {{feared that the}} edict would cause {{widespread}} discontent and tried to suppress publication of it. Rumors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>law</b> quickly spread throughout the area and the colonists seemed {{on the brink of}} revolt. The governor of Coahuila y Tejas, Jose Maria Viesca, wrote to the president to explain the importance of slavery to the Texas economy, and the importance of the Texas economy {{to the development of the}} state. Texas was temporarily exempted from the rule. On April 6, 1830, Mexican president Anastasio Bustamante ordered Texas to comply with the emancipation proclamation or face military intervention. To circumvent the law, many Anglo colonists converted their slaves into indentured servants for life. Others simply called their slaves indentured servants without legally changing their status. Slaveholders wishing to enter Mexico would force their slaves to sign contracts claiming that the slaves owed money and would work to pay the debt. The low wages the slave would receive made repayment impossible, and the debt would be inherited, even though no slave would receive wages until age eighteen. This tactic was outlawed by an 1832 state law which prohibited worker contracts from lasting more than tenyears. A small number of slaves were imported illegally from the West Indies or Africa. The British consul estimated that in the 1830s approximately 500slaves had been illegally imported into Texas. By 1836, there were approximately 5,000 slaves in Texas.|$|E
25|$|A {{government}} decree of March 1982 {{sought to}} provide greater employment {{security for the}} increasing number of workers on part-time and fixed-term contracts by restricting the circumstances in which employers could use such labour (this was largely to ensure that permanent employees were not displaced by cheaper and more easily dismissed part-time workers). The law set out to ensure that such workers receive the same benefits as full-time workers and trade unions were given statutory rights to institute legal proceedings against employers or temporary work agencies if the provisions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>law</b> were evaded. That same year, the government passed legislation to ensure the full, legal eligibility of women for all civil service posts and an active policy was adopted to encourage them to come forward for promotion. In 1981, legislation was passed which permitted the establishment of local private radio stations. In March 1982, a “Special Statute” was granted to Corsica, which set the territory apart legally from other regions and provided it with additional state subsidies and greater autonomy over cultural, social, economic, and educational policies. Various measures were also introduced to improve conditions for migrants. A new drive began in 1981 to encourage local authorities to establish programmes including literacy programmes, housing schemes, and the setting up of young people’s and women’s groups, and in 1983 France ratified the Council of Europe’s Convention on the Legal Status of Migrant Workers. The Association Law of 1981 allowed foreigners {{for the first time to}} form associations in France under the same rules that governed citizens, and these new immigrant associations were thereafter eligible to receive public funding. New policies removed the French language requirements of immigrants to run for seats in employee institutions, and foreign workers became eligible for the first time to sit on important industrial relations councils known as the Conseils des Prud’hommes. In 1982, an existing programme to assist the repatriation of Algerian nationals was replaced by a system offering a choice between vocational training, assistance to set up a small business and a repatriation grant.|$|E
