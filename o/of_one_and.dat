5|$|An Itza {{account of}} this {{encounter}} reached the colonial authorities in Yucatán via Tipuj. The Itza reported that the Guatemalan party approached on horseback to within sight of Nojpetén, and about thirty curious Itzas gathered {{to talk to the}} intruders, whereupon they were attacked by the Spanish, resulting in the deaths of thirty Itzas, the capture <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>and</b> yet more wounded. A Christian Maya emissary from Bacalar-at-Chunjujub', Yucatán, was in Nojpetén around this time, and reported that the Itza gathered 3,000–4,000 warriors ready to repulse Díaz de Velasco's party.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the {{embankment}} began on September 16, 1968 using the hydraulic fill method. The dam's massive concrete emergency spillway was completed on January 19, 1969. However, severe flooding on January 26 destroyed the cofferdam {{and all of}} the construction site's bridges, putting work a month behind schedule. Cleanup proceeded at a rapid pace and placing of impervious material for the dam's core commenced on February 27. For the next fifteen months, a fleet of massive 125-ton (113 t) dump trucks delivered an almost constant stream of dirt and rock to the site, and the dam wall rose at an average rate <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>and</b> a half feet (0.5 m) per day. The workforce peaked at 500 men in mid-1969 and on December 10, the service spillway was completed. On May 28, 1970, {{the embankment}} was finally topped out with the last of over 250,000 truckloads of material.|$|E

Its 26 electrons are arranged in the configuration 3d64s2, of which the 3d and 4s electrons are relatively close in energy, and thus it can lose a variable number of electrons {{and there is no}} clear point where further ionization becomes unprofitable.|$|E

5|$|A few {{hydroxyl}} megamasers, including Arp 220, {{have been}} observed with very long baseline interferometry (VLBI), which allows sources to be studied at higher angular resolution. VLBI observations indicate that hydroxyl megamaser emission is composed of two components, one diffuse and one compact. The diffuse component displays gains of less than a factor <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>and</b> linewidths of order hundreds of kilometers per second. These characteristics {{are similar to those}} seen with single dish observations of hydroxyl megamasers that are unable to resolve individual masing components. The compact components have high gains, ranging from tens to hundreds,high ratios of flux at 1667MHz to flux at 1665MHz, and linewidths are of order a few kilometers per second. These general features have been explained by a narrow circumnuclear ring of material from which the diffuse emission arises, and individual masing clouds with sizes of order one parsec that give rise to the compact emission. The hydroxyl masers observed in the Milky Way more closely resemble the compact hydroxyl megamaser components. There are, however, some regions of extended galactic maser emission from other molecules that resemble the diffuse component of hydroxyl megamasers.|$|E
5|$|Because {{there is}} a maximum number of {{established}} positions for ranks warrant officer first class (one per squadron), promotions {{are based on the}} results of a merit review board. The composition of the merit review board includes a minimum of three to a maximum of five members.

Prior to 1976 the size of the squadron dictated the top rank available and many squadrons were ineligible to carry a WO1 on their establishment effectively capping promotion at WO2 for the squadron's ranking cadet.|$|E
5|$|His {{first full}} season from 1940–1941 saw him play in eight matches, scoring 413runs with the bat at 29.50 and passing fifty runs in an innings twice.

He scored 35 and four at home against Victoria, and then 45 in the second innings of the away match. On 22 November 1940, barely a year into Saggers' career, New South Wales faced a combined Queensland-Victoria team at Brisbane. Saggers scored 58 as his team reached 429 {{in response to the}} oppositions 202 all out. In the Queensland-Victoria team's second innings, where they reached 416, Saggers equalled the world record for most dismissals in an innings, taking seven catches. Saggers then went on to score 47 against South Australia, and 68 against Queensland on 1 January 1941. In his final match before the outbreak of World War II, Saggers scored 63 runs against South Australia. He ended the season with 18 catches with the gloves and 13stumpings.|$|E

5|$|Setting up an encampment in the jungle, the survivors, {{including}} the Castros, Che Guevara, and Camilo Cienfuegos, began launching raids on small army-posts to obtain weaponry. In January 1957 they overran the outpost {{near to the}} beach at La Plata; Guevara treated the soldiers for any injuries, but the revolutionaries executed the local mayoral (land-company overseer) Chicho Osorio, whom the local peasants despised and who boasted of killing one of the MR-26-7 rebels several weeks previously. Osorio's execution aided the rebels in gaining the trust of locals, who typically hated the mayorals as enforcers of the wealthy landowners, although they largely remained unenthusiastic and suspicious of the revolutionaries. As trust grew, some locals joined the rebels, although most new recruits came from urban areas. With increasing numbers of volunteers, who now numbered over 200, in July 1957 Castro divided his army into three columns, keeping charge <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>and</b> giving control of the others to his brother and Guevara. The MR-26-7 members operating in urban areas continued agitation, sending supplies to Castro, and on 16 February 1957 he met with other senior members to discuss tactics; here he met Celia Sánchez, who would become a close friend.|$|E
5|$|The heavy isotope 15N {{was first}} {{discovered}} by S. M. Naudé in 1929, soon after heavy isotopes of the neighbouring elements oxygen and carbon were discovered. It presents {{one of the}} lowest thermal neutron capture cross-sections of all isotopes. It is frequently used in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to determine the structures of nitrogen-containing molecules, due to its fractional nuclear spin of one-half, which offers advantages for NMR such as narrower line width. 14N, though also theoretically usable, has an integer nuclear spin <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>and</b> thus has a quadrupole moment that leads to wider and less useful spectra. 15N NMR nevertheless has complications not encountered in the more 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. The low natural abundance of 15N (0.36%) significantly reduces sensitivity, a problem which is only exacerbated by its low gyromagnetic ratio, (only 10.14% that of 1H). As a result, the signal-to-noise ratio for 1H is about 300 times as much as that for 15N at the same magnetic field strength. This may be somewhat alleviated by isotopic enrichment of 15N by chemical exchange or fractional distillation. 15N-enriched compounds have the advantage that under standard conditions, they do not undergo chemical exchange of their nitrogen atoms with atmospheric nitrogen, unlike compounds with labelled hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen isotopes that must be kept away from the atmosphere. The 15N:14N ratio is commonly used in stable isotope analysis in the fields of geochemistry, hydrology, paleoclimatology and paleoceanography, where it is called δ15N.|$|E
