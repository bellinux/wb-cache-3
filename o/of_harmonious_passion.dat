30|$|Third, Lyubomirsky {{and colleagues}} never {{completely}} state {{the nature of}} the processes at play in their model. They repeatedly mention that self-concordant goals that are attained preferably in new activities will lead to positive effects on one's well-being. But not much else is mentioned regarding what it is that leads to the positive effects on well-being. What I suggest (and elaborate on in a later section) is that in line with Fredrickson (e.g., 2001), positive emotions and associated processes represent the important mechanisms that facilitate the positive effects <b>of</b> <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> on well-being. This is because positive emotions lead one to expand the self and to broaden one's repertoire of skills (Fredrickson 2001). Positive emotions could explain why Lyubomirsky and their colleagues find that new activities and those where there is goal attainment to have positive effects on one's psychological well-being as such emotions are likely to be experienced under these conditions.|$|E
3000|$|A {{final point}} as {{pertains}} {{to the role of}} the activity in the psychological outcomes experienced relates to what may be called [...] "negative" [...] activities. Specifically, if harmonious passion promotes the quality of one's affective experiences during engagement in a [...] "positive" [...] activity, can it also protect the person when engaging in a more [...] "negative" [...] type of activity? While it is difficult to identify a clearly negative activity, gambling may come close to it. Indeed, much research reveals that gambling (and certain types of gambling activities in particular such as video poker machines) may be particularly negative for the person, leading to pathological gambling, social isolation, depression, and even suicide (Bergh & Kühlhorn 1994). As such, if harmonious passion serves protective functions, then engaging in gambling out <b>of</b> <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> should protect one from experiencing negative affect and developing pathological gambling. However, this should not be the case for obsessive passion. In fact, obsessive passion would be expected to even contribute to both.|$|E

In addition, a 2 week-diary study (Mageau & Vallerand 2007) revealed that the positive affect that is experienced during task engagement energized by harmonious passion is still experienced {{at the end of the}} day. Conversely, when engagement in the passionate activity is fueled by obsessive passion, not being able to engage in the passionate activity on a given day leads to feeling less positive at the end of that day. Finally, Vallerand et al.

3000|$|Our initial {{research}} {{sought to}} determine if there was a link between passion for an activity and psychological well-being. It involved senior citizens (Rousseau & Vallerand 2003). We included measures of both psychological well-being such as life satisfaction (Diener et al. 1985), meaning in life (Steger et al. 2006), and vitality (Ryan & Frederick 1997), as well as psychological ill-being ([...] scales of anxiety and depression from the General Health Questionnaire of Goldberg & Hillier 1979). In line with the above hypotheses, having a harmonious passion for an activity was expected to promote psychological well-being, while being obsessively passionate or non passionate was not. Furthermore, it was also hypothesized that harmonious passion should protect against ill-being because of the positive affective states it facilitates. Research supported these hypotheses. For instance, in this particular study, we found that harmonious passion toward one's favorite activity (e.g., playing cards, playing a musical instrument) positively predicted positive indices of psychological well-being but negatively predicted indices of ill-being. Conversely, obsessive passion positively predicted anxiety and depression, was negatively related to life satisfaction, and was unrelated to vitality and meaning in life. Thus, the promoting and protective functions <b>of</b> <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> were supported while the less than optimal role of obsessive passion was demonstrated.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Physical {{activity}} {{has been linked}} to well-being among women. One psychological perspective that can offer insights regarding this relationship is the Dualistic Model of Passion. The model posits that individuals can internalize a valued activity in an autonomous fashion, facilitating a <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion,</b> or in a controlled way, resulting in an obsessive passion. The overall purpose of this experience sampling study with physically active working mothers was to examine the influence of passion towards physical activity on daily positive and negative affect as well as more generally in terms of vitality. Method Sixty-three healthy and active middle-aged women participated in this study. The women attended a baseline session to complete a series of self-report questionnaires including The Passion Scale. Then, using the experience sampling method, the women responded to electronic questionnaires pertaining to their daily affect and physical activity engagement over a 14 -day period. Subsequently they attended a second session during which levels of vitality were assessed. The data were analyzed using Hierarchical Linear Modeling and Analyses of Covariance. Results Sixty of the participants (95 %) were passionate towards physical activity. Daily positive affect was higher and negative affect lower on days when the women engaged in their passion (i. e., physical activity). On these active days, associations between overall positive and negative affect and levels <b>of</b> <b>harmonious</b> or obsessive <b>passion</b> were in the expected directions, albeit not significant. Levels <b>of</b> <b>harmonious</b> and obsessive <b>passion</b> moderated the relationship between activity engagement and positive affect such that obsessively passionate women felt significantly worse on days when they were not active. Vitality was negatively associated with obsessive passion and positively with <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion.</b> Conclusions The findings were consistent with the Dualistic Model of Passion and they suggest avenues of future enquiry. In considering physical activity as a strategy to optimize women’s well-being, the internalization process of this activity (autonomous versus controlled) should be considered. Potential application of these results should involve facilitating more <b>harmonious</b> <b>passions</b> towards physical activity by emphasizing flexible and volitional participation that is well balanced among other activities...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} a motivational premise of burnout: {{in order to}} burn out, an employee must first be fired up. Based on the dualistic model of passion, we propose that the types of passion – harmonious or obsessive – that drive novice teachers differentially affect the three components of burnout. We further propose that job autonomy (i. e. decision latitude) differentially predict {{the two types of}} passion for work. These hypotheses are tested in two studies conducted in Canada in teachers with five years 2 ̆ 7 or less experience. Study 1, using a cross-sectional design, showed that job autonomy positively predicted harmonious passion but negatively predicted obsessive passion. Harmonious passion negatively predicted all three components of burnout, whereas obsessive passion positively predicted emotional exhaustion and depersonalization. A second, 12 -month longitudinal study revealed unidirectional effects of job autonomy on the two types of passion. The results also showed unidirectional effects <b>of</b> <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> on professional efficacy and obsessive passion on emotional exhaustion.

40|$|Individuals' {{search for}} various {{opportunities}} {{within the context}} of their job (role opportunity search) is an important yet demanding characteristic of today's work environments. This study tests the effects <b>of</b> <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> and obsessive passion on role tensions (i. e., role conflict and role overload), which are posited to influence the search for new role opportunities. The results of structural equation modeling (goodness-of-fit statistic =. 92; incremental fit index =. 90; root mean square error of approximation [RMSEA] =. 07) on survey data from Swedish owner–managers (n = 704) supported that harmonious passion has a negative relationship with role conflict (β = −. 14), which in turn has a negative relationship with role opportunity search (β = −. 21). This results in a positive, indirect relationship between harmonious passion and role opportunity search. In contrast, the positive relationship between obsessive passion and role conflict (β =. 44) results in a negative indirect relationship with role opportunity search. The relationships applied for passion were also applied to role overload (harmonious passion: β = −. 26; obsessive passion: β =. 41, p <. 001), but no significant influence was found from role overload to role opportunity search. This study provides insight into the importance of considering role tension in passion models, especially when explaining role opportunity search.

3000|$|At {{least three}} broad {{directions}} for future directions can be proposed. The first {{deals with the}} relative effects {{of different types of}} affective experiences in psychological well-being and the role of passion in these. Specifically, do different types of positive emotions (e.g., joy, pride, excitement) have the same impact on psychological well-being? Do other positive experiences such as flow also contribute to psychological well-being? Which one contributes the most (i.e., positive affect vs flow)? What is the role of passion in these various affective states? A second research direction that would appear important deals with the role of affective adaptation in psychological well-being. Research on affective adaptation (see Wilson & Gilbert 2008) has shown that certain factors (e.g., uncertainty) can ensure that positive affect is maintained longer. An interesting question becomes [...] "Does positive affect longevity contributes to psychological well-being on top of positive affect intensity and frequency". And if so, what is the role <b>of</b> <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> in facilitating such sustained positive affectivity? Finally, a last research avenue pertains to the determinants of passion. Such research should attempt to identify the [...] "best practices" [...] or ways to facilitate the development of a harmonious passion (and prevent an obsessive passion) for a given activity, thereby leading to the experience of positive affect and, in turn, sustainable psychological well-being. Past research on the development of passion (Mageau et al. 2009) has shown that providing autonomy support (or choice) regarding which activity to choose as well as when and how to engage in it should be conducive to a harmonious passion for an activity {{to the extent that the}} latter is valued by the person and is consonant with aspects of the person's identity. Research is needed in order to package these elements so that people can readily develop a harmonious passion and gain well-being benefits from activity engagement.|$|E
40|$|Quality of goal {{engagement}} and alternative goal suppression were investigated in this research. Integrating the dualistic model of passion (Vallerand et al., 2003) with goal-systems theory (Kruglanski et al., 2002), {{we hypothesized that}} obsessive passion—associated with recurrent goal-conflicts—would predict greater alternative goal suppression (i. e., goal-shielding) than would <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> — characterized by effective synthesis of the passionate activity with other life domains. Results from 5 laboratory studies supported these hypotheses. In Study 1, participants’ dispositional measures <b>of</b> <b>harmonious</b> and obsessive <b>passion</b> were correlated with an implicit measure of goal-shielding. Obsessive (but not <b>harmonious)</b> <b>passion</b> predicted the suppression of alternative goals and the progressive inhibition of unfamiliar goals. In Study 2, we extended these findings by demonstrating the interrelation between quality of goal {{engagement and}} goal-commitment such that goal-shielding effects were enhanced, but only for goals in conflict with other life domains (vs. well-integrated goals). In Study 3, the causal influence of passion on goal-shielding was supported via an experimental manipulation of passion.

Study 5 explored the psychological costs associated with repeated unconscious goal suppression by examining its effects on the depletion of self-regulatory resources.

30|$|The {{findings}} {{reported in}} this section lead to some important conclusions: First, <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> would appear to positively contribute to psychological well-being and to protect against psychological ill-being. Second, obsessive passion would appear to predict psychological ill-being while being either negatively or unrelated to psychological well-being. Third, it appears that being non passionate leads to a small decrease in psychological well-being. Thus, {{it appears that the}} same (intentional) activity may or may not contribute to one's psychological well-being depending on the quality of one's engagement in the activity. Because it entails an optimal form <b>of</b> activity engagement, <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> predicts positive well-being, while obsessive passion and its less adaptive form of defensive engagement does not. Finally, research reveals that these findings apply to men and women across the life span and on both hedonic and eudaimonic measures of psychological well-being.|$|R

Results revealed that (a) locomotion positively predicted <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion,</b> which in turn reduced athletes' experience of stress; and (b) assessment positively predicted obsessive passion, which in turn enhanced athletes' experience of stress. Overall, the present results suggest that proximal psychological mechanisms such as basic regulatory mode orientations can predict distal outcomes such as stress indirectly through their relation with motivational phenomena such as passion...|$|R
40|$|The dualistic {{model of}} passion defines passion {{as a strong}} {{inclination}} toward a self-defining activity that a person likes and values and in {{which he or she}} invests time and energy. The model proposes two distinct types <b>of</b> passion: <b>harmonious</b> and obsessive <b>passion</b> that predict adaptive and less adaptive outcomes respectively. In the present research, we were interested in assessing both the negative and positive consequences that can result from gaming. Participants (n 222) were all players involved in massively multiplayer online games. They completed an online survey. Results from a canonical correlation revealed that both <b>harmonious</b> and obsessive <b>passion</b> were positively associated with the experience of positive affect while playing. However, only obses-sive passion was also positively related to the experience of negative affect while playing. In addition, only obsessive passion was positively related to problematic behaviors generally associated with excessive gaming, {{the amount of time spent}} playing, and negative physical symptoms. Moreover, obsessive passion was negatively related to self-realization and unrelated to life satisfaction. Conversely, <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> was positively associated with both types of psychological well-being. This general pattern of results suggests that obsessive passion for gaming is an important predictor of the negative outcomes <b>of</b> gaming, while <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> seems to account for positive consequences. Future research directions are discussed in light of the dualistic model of passion...|$|R
30|$|The {{unique and}} {{defining}} {{element of the}} DPM is its representation of passion’s inherent dualism (Vallerand 2010). In essence, the consequences of engaging in a passionate activity (i.e., affect) may depend on the way this activity is internalized and incorporated into one’s identity (Vallerand et al. 2003, 2007). According to the stated model, distinct internalization processes {{can lead to the}} development of two types <b>of</b> passion: <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> (HP) and obsessive passion (OP). When physical activity is engaged in with a sense of volition and choice, it becomes internalized in an autonomous fashion, thus leading to a <b>harmonious</b> form <b>of</b> <b>passion</b> (Vallerand et al. 2003). With a HP, the activity is well-balanced in one’s identity and it is ‘in harmony’ with other aspects of one’s life. Conversely, an OP for physical activity arises from a controlled internalization whereby one likes the activity but feels a compelling, overwhelming urge to engage in it, as described earlier. Thus, contingencies become attached to the activity as a result of intra-and inter-individual pressures to pursue it. The differential psychological consequences of HP and OP have been studied across several life domains (Vallerand 2008).|$|R
40|$|The dualistic {{model of}} passion theorizes that passion is multidimensional, {{consisting}} <b>of</b> both <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> and obsessive passion. Similarly, theories regarding goal orientation assert that goal orientation is a multifaceted construct, {{consisting of a}} learning goal orientation, prove performance goal orientation, and avoid performance goal orientation. Specifically, this study aimed {{to determine if the}} combination of an employee’s work goal orientation and passion for work is predictive of the amount of job stress he or she perceives. Data from individuals (N= 116) employed full-time were collected through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk platform. Only obsessive work passion was found to be positively related to perceived job stress. Similarly, only obsessive work passion {{was a significant predictor of}} perceived job stress both when prove performance goal orientation was held constant and when avoid performance goal orientation was held constant. Each dimension of work domain goal orientation was not significantly related to either type of passion, nor were they related to or predictive of perceived job stress. Limitations and implications are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The present paper reports {{two studies}} {{designed}} {{to test the}} Dualistic Model of Passion with regard to performance attainment in two fields of expertise. Results from both studies supported the <b>Passion</b> Model. <b>Harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> was {{shown to be a}} positive source of activ-ity investment in that it directly predicted deliberate practice (Study 1) and positively predicted mastery goals which in turn positively predicted de-liberate practice (Study 2). In turn, deliberate practice had a direct positive impact on performance attainment. Obsessive passion was shown to be a mixed source of activity investment. While it directly predicted deliberate practice (Study 1) and directly predicted mastery goals (which predicted deliberate practice), it also predicted performance-avoidance and perform-ance-approach goals, with the former having a tendency to facilitate per-formance directly, and the latter to directly negatively impact on perform-ance attainment (Study 2). Finally, <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> was also positively related to subjective well-being (SWB) in both studies, while obsessive passion was either unrelated (Study 1) or negatively related to SWB (Study 2). The conceptual and applied implications of the differential influences <b>of</b> <b>harmonious</b> and obsessive <b>passion</b> in performance are discussed.

40|$|Athletes {{that are}} happy in their sport {{participate}} more often, and for longer. Therefore, understanding {{the processes that}} give rise to positive emotions in recreational sport is important. Grounded in the dualistic model of passion, the present study tested a structural model in which <b>harmonious</b> and obsessive <b>passion</b> predict positive emotions in recreational sport through the mediating influence of belongingness. It was hypothesized that <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> would positively predict positive emotions via higher belongingness. By contrast, we expected that obsessive passion would negatively predict positive emotions via lower belongingness. A multi-section questionnaire containing the study variables was administered to 402 adult recreational sports participants. Structural equation modeling revealed that <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> positively predicted belongingness that, in turn, positively predicted positive emotions. Obsessive passion and belongingness shared no relationship and hence belongingness did not mediate the obsessive passion-positive emotion link. These findings suggest that social influences within recreational sport should be particularly cognizant <b>of</b> emphasizing <b>harmonious</b> tendencies. This is because athletes with <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> are more likely to feel socially-connected in sport and, therefore, exhibit higher levels of positive emotion...|$|R
