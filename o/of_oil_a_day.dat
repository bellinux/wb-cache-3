2500|$|Up {{until the}} early 1950s, coal had been the {{commodity}} mined in the area. [...] In the late 40's, a blizzard in the Alberta foothills pushed the seismic operations eastward to Stettler. The move resulted in the discovery of oil near Big Valley. [...] But more importantly, it spawned extensive {{oil and gas exploration}} throughout the county. [...] That exploration resulted in the Big Valley No. 7 discovery well the following year, located [...] south of Big Valley, Alberta. [...] This well was completed in September 1950. [...] Once developed, the Fenn-Big Valley field covered an area of 78.2 hectares (30.2 square miles). [...] This field produced over 51 million cubic metres (321 million barrels) of oil and over 2.4 billion cubic metres (85 billion cubic feet) of solution gas. [...] Small amounts of oil and gas remain to be produced from this field. [...] The oil and gas formation lies 1660 metres (5,445ft) {{below the surface of the}} ground. [...] At its peak, the Fenn-Big Valley Field produced 5,352 cubic metres (35,000 barrels) <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> for Gulf and similar amounts for Shell and Esso. [...] The original portion of No. 7 well alone produced 95,700 cubic metres (626,000 barrels) of oil during its lifetime.

2500|$|The {{first time}} came in 1868. On March 4, 1867, John D. Rockefeller, his brother William Rockefeller, chemist Samuel Andrews, and {{businessman}} Henry Flagler formed the oil refining firm of Rockefeller, Andrews & Flagler. (Flagler's step-brother, the liquor magnate Stephen V. Harkness, was a silent partner.) Transportation costs were {{the key to}} making oil cheaply available to consumers, and cheap oil meant more market share (and more profit). For Rockefeller, Andrews & Flagler, the question was how to get its refined oil to East Coast cities. At the time, the railroads were engaged in cutthroat competition for refined oil. Rate-cutting was common (with railways often losing money on shipments). Each road also attempted to win more oil freight business by rapidly building up its supply of tank cars, but this left the railroads with an oversupply of cars, which lost them even more money. In 1868, Rockefeller formed a consortium of Cleveland-area refining companies. The consortium agreed to pool their shipments to the East Coast if lower freight rates could be procured. On behalf of the consortium, Henry Flagler reached an agreement with Stone's Lake Shore & Michigan Southern: The consortium would guarantee at least 60 tank cars of refined oil every day, in return for which the LS would cut shipping rates by 30 percent (e.g., offer a [...] "rebate"). The consortium agreed not to ship oil with any other railway unless the LS could not take the oil, and the LS agreed not to offer a rebate to any other refiners unless they could provide at least 60 tank cars <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> (which none of them could). Stone quickly agreed to the plan, which greatly enhanced Rockefeller, Andrews & Flagler's market share.|$|E
