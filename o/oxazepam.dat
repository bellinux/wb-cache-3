5|$|Individual benzodiazepines {{may have}} {{different}} interactions with certain drugs. Depending on their metabolism pathway, benzodiazepines can be divided roughly into two groups. The largest group consists of those that are metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes and possess significant potential for interactions with other drugs. The other group comprises those that are metabolized through glucuronidation, such as lorazepam, <b>oxazepam,</b> and temazepam, and, in general, have few drug interactions.|$|E
5|$|The benzodiazepines {{diazepam}} (Valium) and <b>oxazepam</b> (Serepax) {{have been}} found to produce fewer withdrawal reactions than alprazolam (Xanax), temazepam (Restoril/Normison), or lorazepam (Temesta/Ativan). Factors that determine the risk of psychological dependence or physical dependence and the severity of the benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms during dose reduction of alprazolam include: dosage used, length of use, frequency of dosing, personality characteristics of the individual, previous use of cross-dependent/cross-tolerant drugs (alcohol or other sedative-hypnotic drugs), current use of cross-dependent/-tolerant drugs, use of other short-acting, high-potency benzodiazepines, and method of discontinuation.|$|E
5|$|Chlordiazepoxide is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used benzodiazepine for alcohol detoxification, but diazepam may be used as an alternative. Both are used in the detoxification of individuals who are motivated to stop drinking, and are prescribed {{for a short period of}} time to reduce the risks of developing tolerance and dependence to the benzodiazepine medication itself. The benzodiazepines with a longer half-life make detoxification more tolerable, and dangerous (and potentially lethal) alcohol withdrawal effects are less likely to occur. On the other hand, short-acting benzodiazepines may lead to breakthrough seizures, and are, therefore, not recommended for detoxification in an outpatient setting. <b>Oxazepam</b> and lorazepam are often used in patients at risk of drug accumulation, in particular, the elderly and those with cirrhosis, because they are metabolized differently from other benzodiazepines, through conjugation.|$|E
5|$|The {{benefits}} of benzodiazepines are least {{and the risks}} are greatest in the elderly. The elderly are at {{an increased risk of}} dependence and are more sensitive to the adverse effects such as memory problems, daytime sedation, impaired motor coordination, and increased risk of motor vehicle accidents and falls, and an increased risk of hip fractures. The long-term effects of benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine dependence in the elderly can resemble dementia, depression, or anxiety syndromes, and progressively worsens over time. Adverse effects on cognition can be mistaken for the effects of old age. The {{benefits of}} withdrawal include improved cognition, alertness, mobility, reduced risk incontinence, and a reduced risk of falls and fractures. The success of gradual-tapering benzodiazepines is as great in the elderly as in younger people. Benzodiazepines should be prescribed to the elderly only with caution and only for a short period at low doses. Short to intermediate-acting benzodiazepines are preferred in the elderly such as <b>oxazepam</b> and temazepam. The high potency benzodiazepines alprazolam and triazolam and long-acting benzodiazepines are not recommended in the elderly due to increased adverse effects. Nonbenzodiazepines such as zaleplon and zolpidem and low doses of sedating antidepressants are sometimes used as alternatives to benzodiazepines.|$|E
25|$|Preferential {{storage of}} <b>oxazepam</b> occurs in some organs, {{including}} {{the heart of}} the neonate. Absorption by any administered route and the risk of accumulation is significantly increased in the neonate, and withdrawal of <b>oxazepam</b> during pregnancy and breast feeding is recommended, as <b>oxazepam</b> is excreted in breast milk.|$|E
25|$|<b>Oxazepam</b> is a short-to-intermediate-acting benzodiazepine. <b>Oxazepam</b> is {{used for}} the {{treatment}} of anxiety and insomnia and in the control of symptoms of alcohol withdrawal.|$|E
25|$|<b>Oxazepam</b> is an intermediate-acting {{benzodiazepine}} of the 3-hydroxy family; it acts on benzodiazepine receptors, {{resulting in}} increased effect of GABA to the GABAA receptor {{which results in}} inhibitory effects on the central nervous system. The half-life of <b>oxazepam</b> is four to 15 hours. It {{has been shown to}} suppress cortisol levels. <b>Oxazepam</b> is the most slowly absorbed and has the slowest onset of action of all the common benzodiazepines according to one British study.|$|E
25|$|It is marketed under many {{brand names}} worldwide, including: Alepam, Alepan, Anoxa, Anxiolit, Comedormir, durazepam, Murelax, Nozepam, Oksazepam, Opamox, Ox-Pam, Oxa-CT, Oxabenz, Oxapam, Oxapax, Oxascand, Oxaze, <b>Oxazepam,</b> <b>Oxazépam,</b> Oxazin, Oxepam, Praxiten, Purata, Selars, Serenal, Serepax, Seresta, Séresta, Serpax, Sobril, Tazepam, Vaben, and Youfei.|$|E
25|$|<b>Oxazepam</b> was {{initially}} patented and marketed in 1965.|$|E
25|$|<b>Oxazepam</b> is a Schedule IV drug {{under the}} Convention on Psychotropic Substances.|$|E
25|$|A 1995 {{study found}} that {{temazepam}} is more rapidly absorbed and <b>oxazepam</b> is more slowly absorbed than most other benzodiazepines.|$|E
25|$|<b>Oxazepam</b> has the {{potential}} for misuse, defined as taking the drug to achieve a high, or continuing to take the drug in the long term against medical advice. Benzodiazepines, including diazepam, <b>oxazepam,</b> nitrazepam, and flunitrazepam, accounted for the largest volume of forged drug prescriptions in Sweden from 1982 to 1986. During this time, a total of 52% of drug forgeries were for benzodiazepines, suggesting they were a major prescription drug class of abuse.|$|E
25|$|<b>Oxazepam</b> is {{contraindicated}} in myasthenia gravis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, {{and limited}} pulmonary reserve, {{as well as}} severe hepatic disease.|$|E
25|$|<b>Oxazepam,</b> {{along with}} diazepam, nitrazepam, and temazepam, were the four benzodiazepines {{listed on the}} {{pharmaceutical}} benefits scheme and represented 82% of the benzodiazepine prescriptions in Australia in 1990-1991.|$|E
25|$|<b>Oxazepam,</b> as {{with other}} {{benzodiazepine}} drugs, can cause tolerance, physical dependence, addiction, and benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome. Withdrawal from <b>oxazepam</b> or other benzodiazepines often leads to withdrawal symptoms which {{are similar to those}} seen during alcohol and barbiturate withdrawal. The higher the dose and the longer the drug is taken, the greater the risk of experiencing unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms can occur, though, at standard dosages and also after short-term use. Benzodiazepine treatment should be discontinued as soon as possible by a slow and gradual dose reduction regimen.|$|E
25|$|Phenobarbital is {{sometimes}} used for alcohol detoxification and benzodiazepine detoxification for its sedative and anticonvulsant properties. The benzodiazepines chlordiazepoxide (Librium) and <b>oxazepam</b> (Serax) have largely replaced phenobarbital for detoxification.|$|E
25|$|Delirium tremens due {{to alcohol}} {{withdrawal}} {{can be treated}} with benzodiazepines. High doses {{may be necessary to}} prevent death. Amounts given are based on the symptoms. Typically the person is kept sedated with benzodiazepines, such as diazepam, lorazepam, chlordiazepoxide, or <b>oxazepam.</b>|$|E
25|$|However, {{due to its}} slow rate of {{absorption}} and its {{slow onset}} of action, <b>oxazepam</b> has a relatively low potential for abuse compared to some other benzodiazepines, such as temazepam, flunitrazepam, or triazolam, which have a high potential for abuse similar to barbiturates.|$|E
25|$|The medical {{utility of}} only a few species of Passiflora has been scientifically studied. In initial study in 2001 for {{treatment}} of generalized anxiety disorder, maypop extract performed as well as <b>oxazepam</b> but with fewer short-term side effects. It was recommended to follow up with long-term studies to confirm these results.|$|E
25|$|N-oxides {{are prone}} to undergo the Polonovski {{rearrangement}} when treated with acetic anhydride, and this was illustrated by the synthesis of <b>oxazepam.</b> It {{is not surprising that}} the N-methyl analogue (1) also undergoes this process, and hydrolysis of the resulting acetate gives temazepam (2). Care must be exacted with the conditions, or the inactive rearrangement product (3) results.|$|E
25|$|<b>Oxazepam</b> {{exists as}} a racemic mixture. Early {{attempts}} to isolate enantiomers were unsuccessful; the corresponding acetate has been isolated {{as a single}} enantiomer. Given the different rates of epimerization that occur at different pH levels, {{it was determined that}} there would be no therapeutic benefit to the administration of a single enantiomer over the racemic mixture.|$|E
25|$|In {{tests in}} {{pentobarbital}} trained rhesus monkeys benzodiazepines produced effects similar to barbiturates. In a 1991 study, triazolam {{had the highest}} self-administration rate in cocaine trained baboons, among the five benzodiazepines examined: alprazolam, bromazepam, chlordiazepoxide, lorazepam, triazolam. A 1985 study found that triazolam and temazepam maintained higher rates of self-injection than {{a variety of other}} benzodiazepines. A 1991 study indicated that diazepam, in particular, had a greater abuse liability among people who were drug abusers than did many of the other benzodiazepines. Some of the available data also suggested that lorazepam and alprazolam are more diazepam-like in having relatively high abuse liability, while <b>oxazepam,</b> halazepam, and possibly chlordiazepoxide, are relatively low in this regard. A 1991–1993 British study found that the hypnotics flurazepam and temazepam were more toxic than average benzodiazepines in overdose. A 1995 study found that temazepam is more rapidly absorbed and <b>oxazepam</b> is more slowly absorbed than most other benzodiazepines.|$|E
25|$|Benzodiazepines {{require special}} {{precautions}} if {{used in the}} elderly, during pregnancy, in children, alcohol- or drug-dependent individuals, and individuals with comorbid psychiatric disorders. Benzodiazepines including <b>oxazepam</b> are lipophilic drugs and rapidly penetrate membranes, so rapidly crosses over into the placenta with significant uptake of the drug. Use of benzodiazepines in late pregnancy, especially high doses, may result in floppy infant syndrome.|$|E
25|$|<b>Oxazepam</b> {{when taken}} during late in pregnancy, the third trimester, causes a {{definite}} {{risk to the}} neonate including a severe benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome including hypotonia, and reluctance to suck, to apnoeic spells, cyanosis, and impaired metabolic responses to cold stress. Floppy infant syndrome and sedation in the newborn may also occur. Symptoms of floppy infant syndrome and the neonatal benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome {{have been reported to}} persist from hours to months after birth.|$|E
25|$|A 1985 {{study found}} that {{temazepam}} and triazolam maintained significantly higher rates of self-injection than {{a variety of other}} benzodiazepines. The study tested and compared the abuse liability of temazepam, triazolam, diazepam, lorazepam, <b>oxazepam,</b> flurazepam, alprazolam, chlordiazepoxide, clonazepam, nitrazepam, flunitrazepam, bromazepam, and clorazepate. The study tested self-injection rates on human, baboon, and rat subjects. All test subjects consistently showed a strong preference for temazepam and triazolam over {{all the rest of the}} benzodiazepines included in the study.|$|E
25|$|It is an intermediate-acting {{benzodiazepine}} with a {{slow onset}} of action, so it is usually prescribed to individuals who have trouble staying asleep, rather than falling asleep. It is commonly prescribed for anxiety disorders with associated tension, irritability, and agitation. It is also prescribed for drug and alcohol withdrawal, and for anxiety associated with depression. Physicians may use <b>oxazepam</b> outside its approved indications to treat social phobia, post-traumatic stress disorder, insomnia, premenstrual syndrome, and other conditions.|$|E
25|$|Prevention is by {{treating}} withdrawal symptoms. If delirium tremens occurs, aggressive treatment improves outcomes. Treatment {{in a quiet}} intensive care unit with sufficient light is often recommended. Benzodiazepines are the medication of choice with diazepam, lorazepam, chlordiazepoxide, and <b>oxazepam</b> all commonly used. They should be given until a person is lightly sleeping. The antipsychotic haloperidol may also be used. The vitamin thiamine is recommended. Mortality without treatment is between 15% and 40%. Currently death occurs in about 1% to 4% of cases.|$|E
25|$|Diazepam was the top-selling {{pharmaceutical}} in the United States from 1969 to 1982, with peak {{sales in}} 1978 of 2.3 billion tablets. Diazepam, along with <b>oxazepam,</b> nitrazepam and temazepam, represents 82% of the benzodiazepine market in Australia. While psychiatrists continue to prescribe diazepam for the short-term relief of anxiety, neurology {{has taken the}} lead in prescribing diazepam for the palliative treatment of certain types of epilepsy and spastic activity, for example, forms of paresis. It is also {{the first line of defense}} for a rare disorder called stiff-person syndrome.|$|E
25|$|In Australia, a {{study of}} 16 deaths {{associated}} with toxic concentrations of benzodiazepines {{during the period of}} 5 years leading up to July 1994 found preexisting natural disease as a feature of 11 cases; 14 cases were suicides. Cases where other drugs, including ethanol, had contributed to the death were excluded. In the remaining five cases, death was caused solely by benzodiazepines. Nitrazepam and temazepam were the most prevalent drugs detected, followed by <b>oxazepam</b> and flunitrazepam. A review of self poisonings of 12 months 1976 - 1977 in Auckland, New Zealand, found benzodiazepines implicated in 40% of the cases. A 1993 British study found flurazepam and temazepam to have the highest number of deaths per million prescriptions among medications commonly prescribed in the 1980s. Flurazepam, now rarely prescribed in the United Kingdom and Australia, had the highest fatal toxicity index of any benzodiazepine (15.0) followed by Temazepam (11.9), versus 5.9 for benzodiazepines overall, taken with or without alcohol.|$|E
25|$|New {{research}} in the related field entomotoxicology is currently studying the effects of drugs {{on the development of}} insects who have fed on the decomposing tissue of a drug user. The effects of drugs and toxins on insect development are proving to be an important factor when determining the insect colonization time. It has been shown that cocaine use can accelerate the development of maggots. In one case, Lucilia sericata larvae that fed in the nasal cavity of a cocaine abuser, grew over 8mm longer than larvae of the same generation found elsewhere on the body. Other researchers in entomotoxicology are developing techniques to detect and measure drug levels in older fly pupae. This research is useful for determining cause of death for bodies that are found during later stages of decay. To this date, bromazepam, levomepromazine, malathion, phenobarbital, trazolam, <b>oxazepam,</b> alimemazine, clomipramine, morphine, mercury, and copper have been recovered from maggots.|$|E
25|$|The various benzodiazepines {{differ in}} their {{toxicity}} since they produce varying levels of sedation in overdose. A 1993 British study of deaths during the 1980s found flurazepam and temazepam more frequently involved in drug-related deaths, causing more deaths per million prescriptions than other benzodiazepines. Flurazepam, now rarely prescribed in the United Kingdom and Australia, had the highest fatal toxicity index of any benzodiazepine (15.0), followed by temazepam (11.9), versus benzodiazepines overall (5.9), taken with or without alcohol. An Australian (1995) study found <b>oxazepam</b> less toxic and less sedative, and temazepam more toxic and more sedative, than most benzodiazepines in overdose. An Australian study (2004) of overdose admissions between 1987 and 2002 found alprazolam, {{which happens to be}} the most prescribed benzodiazepine in the U.S. by a large margin, to be more toxic than diazepam and other benzodiazepines. They also cited a review of the Annual Reports of the American Association of Poison Control Centers National Data Collection System, which showed alprazolam was involved in 34 fatal deliberate self-poisonings over 10 years (1992–2001), compared with 30 fatal deliberate self-poisonings involving diazepam. In a New Zealand study (2003) of 200 deaths, Zopiclone, a benzodiazepine receptor agonist, had similar overdose potential as benzodiazepines.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Oxazepam</b> is {{an active}} {{metabolite}} formed during the breakdown of diazepam, nordazepam, and certain similar drugs. It may be safer than many other benzodiazepines in patients with impaired liver function {{because it does not}} require hepatic oxidation, but rather, it is simply metabolized by glucuronidation, so <b>oxazepam</b> is less likely to accumulate and cause adverse reactions in the elderly or people with liver disease. <b>Oxazepam</b> is similar to lorazepam in this respect.|$|E
2500|$|As <b>oxazepam</b> is {{an active}} {{metabolite}} of diazepam, an overlap in possible interactions is likely with other drugs or food, with exception of the pharmacokinetic CYP450 interactions (e.g. with cimetidine). Precautions and following the prescription are required when taking <b>oxazepam</b> (or other benzodiazepines) in combinations with antidepressant medication (SSRIs such as Prozac, Zoloft, and Paxil, or multiple reuptake inhibitors such as Wellbutrin, Cymbalta, or Effexor), potent painkillers (opioids, e.g. morphine, oxycodone or methadone). Concurrent use of these medicines (as well as other benzodiazepines) can interact {{in a way that}} is difficult to predict. [...] Drinking alcohol when taking <b>oxazepam</b> is not recommended. Concomitant use of <b>oxazepam</b> and alcohol can lead to increased sedation, severe problems with coordination (ataxia), decreased muscle tone, and in severe cases or in predisposed patients, even to life-threatening intoxications with respiratory depression, coma, and collapse.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Oxazepam</b> is {{generally}} less toxic in overdose than other benzodiazepines. Important factors which affect {{the severity of}} a benzodiazepine overdose include the dose ingested, {{the age of the}} patient, and health status prior to overdose. Benzodiazepine overdoses can be much more dangerous if a coingestion of other CNS depressants such as opiates or alcohol has occurred. Symptoms of an <b>oxazepam</b> overdose include: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{side effects}} of <b>oxazepam</b> {{are similar to those}} of other benzodiazepines, and may include dizziness, drowsiness, headache, memory impairment, {{paradoxical}} excitement, and anterograde amnesia, but does not affect transient global amnesia. [...] Side effects due to rapid decrease in dose or abrupt withdrawal from <b>oxazepam</b> may include abdominal and muscle cramps, convulsions, depression, inability to fall asleep or stay asleep, sweating, tremors, or vomiting.|$|E
2500|$|Rehabilitation {{programs}} {{consist of}} [...] "detox" [...] and [...] "treatment" [...] phases. The detoxification ("detox") phase consists of medically supervised {{withdrawal from the}} drug of dependency onto buprenorphine, sometimes aided {{by the use of}} medications such as benzodiazepines like <b>oxazepam</b> or diazepam (modern milder tranquilizers that assist with anxiety, sleep, and muscle relaxation), clonidine (a blood-pressure medication that may reduce some opioid withdrawal symptoms), and anti-inflammatory/pain relief drugs such as ibuprofen and aspirin.|$|E
