40|$|In North America, the Numerical Fish Surrogate (NFS) is used {{to design}} fish bypass systems for emigrating {{juvenile}} salmon as they migrate from hatchery outfalls and rearing habitats to adult habitat in the oceans. The NFS is constructed of three linked modules: 1) a computational fluid dynamics model describes the complex flow fields upstream of dams at a scale sufficiently resolved to analyze, understand and forecast fish movement, 2) a particle tracking model interpolates hydraulic information from the fixed nodes of the computational fluid model mesh to multiple locations relevant to migrating fish, and 3) a behavior model simulates the cognition and behavior of individual fish {{in response to the}} fluid dynamics predicted by the computational fluid dynamics model. These three modules together create a virtual reality where virtual fish exhibit realistic dam approach behaviors and can be counted at dam exits in ways similar to the real world. Once calibrated and validated with measured fish movement and passage data, the NFS can accurately predict fish passage proportions with sufficient precision to allow engineers to select one optimum alternative from among many competing structural or <b>operational</b> <b>bypass</b> alternatives. Although South American fish species are different from North American species, {{it is likely that the}} basic computational architecture and numerical methods of the NFS can be used for fish conservation in South America. Consequently, the extensive investment made in the creation of the NFS need not be duplicated in South America. However, its use in South America will require that the behavioral response of the continent 2 Ì† 7 s unique fishes to hydrodynamic cues must be described, codified and tested before the NFS can be used to conserve fishes by helping design efficient South American bypass systems. To this end, we identify studies that could be used to describe the movement behavior of South American fishes of sufficient detail that they could be used to develop, calibrate and validate a South American version of the NFS...|$|E
40|$|A {{microfluidic}} {{approach for}} raw milk sample preconditioning prior to protein and lipid content analysis has been developed. The system utilizes microchip acoustophoresis {{and is a}} further extension of our previously reported multiple node ultrasonic standing wave focusing platform (Grenvall, C., Augustsson, P., Matsuoka, H. and Laurell, T. Proc. Micro Total Anal. Syst. 2008, 1, 161 - 163). The microfluidic approach offers a method for rapid raw milk quality control using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). Two acoustophoresis modes are explored, 2 lambda/ 2 and 3 lambda/ 2, offering lipid content enrichment or depletion, respectively. Lipid content depletion above 90 % was accomplished. FT-IR data on microchip-processed raw milk samples, enabling direct lipid and protein content analysis, are reported. Most importantly, the harmonic <b>operational</b> modes <b>bypass</b> the problem of lipid aggregation and subsequent clogging, inherent in lambda/ 2 acoustophoresis systems...|$|R
40|$|None supplied. From {{executive}} summary: This report {{examined the}} potential for an expanded fish transportation program under an assumption of fully <b>operational</b> fish <b>bypass</b> facilities being present at mainstem Snake and Columbia River hydroelectric facilities. The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers FISHPASS model {{was used for the}} analysis. Results indicated that additional transportation would be of marginal benefit to any stocks except those entering the pool immediately above the dam being considered. For this reason, Ice Hrbor Dam is least attractive for addition of transport. John Day and Lower Monumental were the most attractive as preferred locations for transportation facilities. The effect of variations in turbine mortality was very small when compared to changes in reservoir mortality. Mortality outside the scope of the study was also considered and its effect on modeling results was discussed...|$|R
50|$|The only Arkansas {{projects}} remaining for a fully <b>operational</b> two-lane <b>bypass</b> {{are between}} County Road 34/Missouri state {{line and a}} roundabout connector with US 71B. Both of these projects are listed as TBD by AHTD. Design work is complete for the roadway project, and is anticipated to be complete in 2015 for the interchange. Construction of the roadway is anticipated to be complete in 2017, assuming a one-year delay related to Missouri funding. Construction on the interchange is tentatively scheduled to be complete in 2018. Missouri DOT is responsible for a segment between the Missouri state line and I-49, with no clear path to funding at present. The Bella Vista Bypass is now on hold again because on August 5, 2014, an amendment bill intended to raise the sales tax failed at the ballot box. Not wanting to build an destination-less stub road, the Arkansas State Highway Commission officially postponed {{the construction of the}} segment between the Missouri state line and County Road 34 in September 2013 pending Missouri acquiring funding.|$|R
40|$|The {{electron}} {{transport system}} of Neisseria gonorrhoeae was partially characterized by using spectrophotometric, spectroscopic, and oxygen consumption measurements. The effects of selected electron transport inhibitors (amytal, rotenone, 2 -heptyl- 4 -hydroxyquinoline, antimycin A 1, and potassium cyanide [KCN]) on electron transfer in whole-cell and sonically treated whole-cell preparations of N. gonorrhoeae were examined. The oxidation of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, measured as {{a decrease in}} absorbance at 340 nm, was inhibited by each of the compounds tested. Oxygen consumption stimulated by reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide was also inhibited, whereas oxygen uptake stimulated by succinate and malate was inhibited by KCN alone, suggesting {{the presence of a}} KCN-sensitive terminal oxidase. Room temperature optical difference spectra indicate an <b>operational</b> electron <b>bypass</b> around the amytal-rotenone-binding site. Difference spectra in the presence of 2 -heptyl- 4 -hydroxyquinoline suggest a possible site of interaction of this compound at the substrate side of cytochrome b. Reduced-minus-oxidized spectra of ascorbate-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine suggest the participation of b-, a-, and d-type cytochromes in terminal oxidase activity. Hence, N. gonorrhoeae appears to have an electron transport chain containing cytochrome c, two b-type cytochromes (one of which has an oxidase function), and possibly a- and d-type cytochromes. An abbreviated chain exists through which succinate and malate can be oxidized directly by a KCN-sensitive component...|$|R
40|$|Bypass {{systems at}} dams on the Columbia and Snake Rivers divert {{large numbers of}} {{juvenile}} salmonids (Oncorhynchus spp) away from turbine intakes and downstream into tailrace areas. However, few rigorous assessments of comparative survival have been made between bypassed fish and those passing through turbines. A study was initiated at Bonneville Dam in 1987 to provide definitive information regarding passage survival. Results to date show bypassed fish had lower survival than fish passing the dam through turbines or spillways. Fish exiting the bypass system had elevated plasma concentrations of cortisol (an index of stress), but physical injuries were not apparent. One likely cause for decreased survival of bypassed fish was predation by northern squawfish (Ptychocheilus oregonensis) on fish exiting the bypass outlet. Study results indicated that <b>bypass</b> <b>operational</b> procedures, as well as location and physical conditions at the bypass outlet, favor high predation. Factors contributing to high predation include: (1) river-water velocity of less than 1. 2 m/s at the bypass exit; (2) proximity of the bypass exit to predator sanctuary areas; (3) location of the bypass exit at a curved reach of river where the flow was directed towards shorelines; (4) poor dispersal of released fish, resulting in increased juvenile salmon density in the migration route; (5) disorientation of juvenile salmonids upon exiting the bypass outlet; and (6) continuous release at one site...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn most {{instances}} process plants {{are designed to}} meet performance objectives that are clearly defined by a detailed technical specification. The contractors and licensors designing and building such process plants are quite proficient at designing a plant to meet those performance values for an economically attractive cost. However the reality for the owner and operator of the plant is that over the 40 + year lifetime of the plant the inlet feeds, production rate and operationally desired set points for each piece of equipment will change. Often times this {{can result in a}} non-optimal plant and performance problems or poor reliability. This fact is particularly severe for plants which undergo significant corrosion or fouling like that commonly seen in sulphuric acid plants. Plants are built to make money for their owners. The primary way to make the most money out of a facility is to have the plant operational at as high of a capacity as possible for the maximum number of days in the operational life of the plant. There are numerous ways that the plant designer and builder can place design allowances, safety factors, built in redundancy, optional <b>operational</b> configurations, <b>bypasses</b> and other tricks to allow the facility to operate well for all desired production rates and all desired feed types. The costs of such options are often quite small if dealt with in the initial design phase. Unfortunately, in nearly all instances this optimal facility is not the facility that is built for the client. The reason why is often the inflexibility in the client/designer contractual relationship prevents open discussions on optimization. The Convertible Lump Sum EPS model can be used to get the optimal plant design for the client's present and future needs as well as providing price surety of a lump sum execution. This paper will detail the aspects of the Convertible Lump Sum EPS model. It will use an example sulphuric acid plant project to show how the client can be involved in the decision making process to get the best plant design for their site with appropriate design factors and options. Instances will be illustrated where plants have been built that do not have the flexibility required to operate effectively as the plant ages and/or the plant slightly changes operational modes. This lack of flexibility often causes damage to the plant and operational downtime or reduced capacity. Cost/Benefit analyses will be done on each of these cases. This paper will show that use of an effective, technically and commercially transparent contracting model with the appropriate partner can allow significant savings in TIC cost as well as for total return on investment...|$|R
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Pneumatic {{conveying}} is {{a popular}} method of transporting materials in the resource and process industries because of its advantages of no dust emission, flexible conveying pipe routes and capability to convey poisonous and hazardous material. There are two primary modes of pneumatic conveying: dilute phase and dense phase. One of the significant advantages of dense-phase conveying over dilute phase {{is the ability to}} convey materials at relatively low conveying velocities, resulting in significantly reduced particle attrition and erosive wear of pipelines. For this reason, there has been a significant move towards dense-phase systems. However, whether a material can be dense-phase conveyed in conventional pipeline is critically governed by its physical properties. Bypass pneumatic conveying systems provide the capacity to transport materials that are not naturally suited to dense-phase conveying, and can significantly reduce the minimum dense-phase conveying velocity for some materials that are dense-phase conveyed in conventional pipelines. In both cases, the conveying velocity is significantly reduced, resulting in less particle degradation, lower pipeline wear and lower power consumption. Pressure drop, specific energy consumption and minimum conveying velocity are three major parameters for assessing system performance in bypass pneumatic conveying systems. An extensive experimental program was conducted as part of this study. The pressure drop was measured when transporting fly ash, alumina, sand and plastic pellets over a range of conveying parameters in a conventional pneumatic conveying system and a series of internal bypass systems of varying configurations. The bypass configuration variations included orifice diameter, internal bypass pipe diameter and flute spacing. In particular, comparisons between the conventional system and the bypass configurations were made with respect to isothermal energy consumption and minimum conveying velocity. To interpret the mechanism of material blockage inhibition associated with bypass systems, the differential pressure between the main pipe and the internal bypass pipe was measured, together with a high-speed video camera visualisation, which provided pressure and visual information on bypass pipeline flow regimes. Based on mass and momentum conservation and the ideal gas equation, a mathematical model was developed to simulate the internal bypass pneumatic conveying process considering the internal bypass pipe configuration. In the development of the model, it was necessary to determine the solids friction factor. Although a few equations have previously been proposed to predict this factor, none was found to provide sufficient accuracy. Therefore, a solids friction factor model was developed based on the partial least squares (PLS) method. Subsequently, the proposed mathematical model, together with this modified solids friction model, was applied to predict the pressure drop within bypass systems for different conveyed materials (i. e., fly ash, alumina and sand) and different bypass configurations of varying internal bypass pipe diameter, orifice diameter and bypass flute spacing. Bypass pipe diameter and bypass flute spacing are two crucial parameters for bypass system design to avoid any possible blockage and ensure reliable conveying. In this study, a design protocol for internal bypass pipe diameter and the frequency of bypass pipeline openings was established based on the physical properties of the materials to be conveyed. This analysis was based in the theories associated with de-aeration analysis, fluidisation analysis, the Darcy Equation and orifice plate theory. This research represents a significant step in improved understanding of blockage inhibition mechanisms within a bypass system, <b>bypass</b> system <b>operational</b> principles, <b>bypass</b> system modelling and design protocol and the influence of material properties and bypass configurations on specific energy consumption...|$|R
