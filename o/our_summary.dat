6000|$|SUMMARY. What we call {{eighteenth-century}} literature appeared [...] {{between two}} great political upheavals, the English Revolution of [...] 1688 and the French Revolution of 1789. Some {{of the chief}} [...] characteristics of that literature--such as the emphasis on form, [...] the union of poetry with politics, the prevalence of satire, the [...] interest in historical subjects--have been accounted for, in part [...] at least, in <b>our</b> <b>summary</b> {{of the history of}} the period.|$|E
60|$|But how {{can they}} look {{for it to be}} otherwise? The modern French appear fit to manage only garrisons and {{military}} posts. They will make everything official, and they will not remember the protest against governing too much, offered by the burgesses of Paris to Louis le Grand. They are always on duty; they are never out of uniform, mentally and metaphorically, as well as bodily and literally. Nothing is done without delay, even in the matter of signing a ship's papers. A long procès-verbal takes the place of <b>our</b> <b>summary</b> punishment, and the gros canon is dragged into use on every occasion, even to enforce the payment of native debts.|$|E
60|$|THE QUALITY OF GEORGE ELIOT. Of {{the moral}} quality of George Eliot {{we have already}} said enough. To <b>our</b> <b>summary</b> of her method this should be added, that she tried to make each of her {{characters}} not individual but typical. In other words, if Tito came finally to grief, and Adam arrived at a state of gloomy satisfaction (there is no real happiness in George Eliot's world), it was not because Tito and Adam lived in different times or circumstances, but because both were {{subject to the same}} eternal laws. Each must have gone to his own place whether he lived in wealth or poverty, in Florence or England, in the fifteenth or the nineteenth century. The moral law is universal and unchanging; it has no favorites, and makes no exceptions. It is more like the old Greek conception of Nemesis, or the Anglo-Saxon conception of Wyrd, or Fate, than anything else you will find in modern fiction.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a novel {{approach}} that makes use of topic models based on Latent Dirichlet allocation(LDA) for generating single document <b>summaries.</b> <b>Our</b> approach is distinguished from other LDA based approaches in that we identify the summary topics which best describe a given document and only extract sentences from those paragraphs within the document which are highly correlated given the summary topics. This ensures that <b>our</b> <b>summaries</b> always highlight {{the crux of the}} document without paying any attention to the grammar and the structure of the documents. Finally, we evaluate <b>our</b> <b>summaries</b> on the DUC 2002 Single document summarization data corpus using ROUGE measures. <b>Our</b> <b>summaries</b> had higher ROUGE values and better semantic similarity with the documents than the DUC summaries...|$|R

6000|$|Appended to {{the play}} is an {{entertaining}} though somewhat mysterious document called [...] "The Revolutionist's Handbook." [...] It contains many very sound remarks; this, for example, which I cannot too much applaud: [...] "If you hit your child, {{be sure that you}} hit him in anger." [...] If that principle had been properly understood, we should have had less of Shaw's sociological friends and their meddling with the habits and instincts of the poor. But among the fragments of advice also occurs the following suggestive and even alluring remark: [...] "Every man over forty is a scoundrel." [...] On the first personal opportunity I asked the author of this remarkable axiom what it meant. I gathered that what it really meant was something like this: that every man over forty had been all the essential use that he was likely to be, and was therefore in a manner a parasite. It is gratifying to reflect that Bernard Shaw has sufficiently answered his own epigram by continuing to pour out treasures both of truth and folly long after this allotted time. But if the epigram might be interpreted in a rather looser style as meaning that past a certain point a man's work takes on its final character and does not greatly change the nature of its merits, it may certainly be said that with Man and Superman, Shaw reaches that stage. The two plays that have followed it, though of very great interest in themselves, do not require any revaluation of, or indeed any addition to, <b>our</b> <b>summary</b> of his genius and success. They are both in a sense casts back to his primary energies; the first in a controversial and the second in a technical sense. Neither need prevent our saying that the moment when John Tanner and Anne agree that it is doom for him and death for her and life only for the thing unborn, is the peak of his utterance as a prophet.|$|E
40|$|We propose new summary {{measures}} of diagnostic test accuracy {{which can be}} used as companions to existing diagnostic accuracy measures. Conceptually, <b>our</b> <b>summary</b> measures are tantamount to the so-called Hellinger affinity and we show that they can be regarded as {{measures of}} agreement constructed from similar geometrical principles as Pearson correlation. A covariate-specific version of <b>our</b> <b>summary</b> index is developed, {{which can be used}} to assess the discrimination performance of a diagnostic test, conditionally on the value of a predictor. Nonparametric Bayes estimators for the proposed indexes are devised, theoretical properties of the corresponding priors are derived, and the performance of our methods is assessed through a simulation study. Data from a prostate cancer diagnosis study are used to illustrate our methods...|$|E

40|$|International audienceRDF is {{the data}} model {{of choice for}} Semantic Web applications. RDF graphs are often large and have heterogeneous, complex structure. Graph {{summaries}} are compact structures computed from the input graph; they are typically used to simplify users' experience and to speed up graph processing. We introduce a formal RDF summarization framework, based on graph quotients and RDF node equivalence; our framework can be instantiated with many such equivalence relations. We show that <b>our</b> <b>summaries</b> represent the structure and semantics of the input graph, and establish a sufficient condition on the RDF equivalence relation which ensures that a graph can be summarized more efficiently, without materializing its implicit triples...|$|R
40|$|The UNED phrase-based cross-language {{summaries}} {{were first}} introduced at iCLEF 2001 as a translation strategy which permitted faster document selection with {{roughly the same}} accuracy than full Machine Translation. For our iCLEF 2003 participation, we test the validity of <b>our</b> <b>summaries</b> as cross-language indexes for the retrieval stage of the interactive search process. We compare a reference system that performs query translation (and then retrieves target-language documents) with a proposed system that directly retrieves cross-language summaries with the source-language query. The performance of both systems is very similar, confirming that UNED summaries are viable for cross-language indexing. This approach is trivially scalable {{to more than one}} target language, opening an interesting path for truly multilingual search assistance. ...|$|R

30|$|In the UNIPROT websites, {{there are}} no {{mutations}} described for Nav 1.3. During literatures searching, we found that six mutations of Nav 1.3 are associated with cryptogenic partial epilepsy. Except for the present mutations in the UNIPROT websites, we found additional mutations of Nav channels in literatures. All mutations are summarized in Tables  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. However, we recognize that <b>our</b> <b>summary</b> may not contain all Nav channel disease-related mutations owing to abundant literatures reporting Nav channel disease-related mutations and increasing volume of work describing new findings.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a novel application of automatic summarisation methods for producing glossary entries. The proposed methodology {{is motivated by}} two observations: 1) glossary entries are increasingly used, especially on the Internet; and 2) information contained in a glossary entry is, in fact, a summary {{of information about the}} concept. From these two observations, we develop a method to automatically summarise contexts of a term 1 into a short text which can serve as a glossary entry. The method uses term-based and indicating phrase-based scoring methods to rank and select important contexts. A comparison of the similarity among the concept-centred <b>summaries</b> produced by <b>our</b> method, random baselines, and glossary entries produced by human shows that <b>our</b> <b>summaries</b> are better than the baselines used in this experiment. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper 1 {{presents}} {{our approach}} {{to the problem of}} single sentence summarisation. We investigate the use of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to guide the generation of a summary towards the theme that is the focus of the document to be summarised. In doing so, the intuition is that the generated summary will more accurately reflect the content of the source document. Currently, we operate in the news domain and at present, <b>our</b> <b>summaries</b> are modelled on headlines. This paper presents SVD as an alternative method to determine if a word is a suitable candidate for inclusion in the headline. The results of a recall based evaluation comparing three different strategies to word selection, indicate that thematic information does help improve recall. ...|$|R
40|$|Sentence {{extraction}} based summarization methods {{has some}} limitations as it doesn't {{go into the}} semantics of the document.

We involve semantic role labeling to get the semantic representation of text and use of segmentation to form clusters of the related pieces of text. Picking out the centroids and sentence generation completes the task.
