500|$|Two music videos, both {{directed}} by David LaChapelle, were shot {{for the song}} and its accompanying remix. The videos introduced a less demure image of Carey, one that received negative backlash from critics. She appears in the video with a lighter hair color than she had sported in the past, and wearing a series of revealing ensembles. Reviewers disregarded Carey's newer image, primarily her double-handkerchief bra, and likened her to younger pop singers such as Britney Spears, which they felt cheapened the singer. The video begins with Cameo driving all over a racetrack, while Carey, dressed in revealing clothing, is shown singing in various [...] "car girl" [...] positions at the track <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>hot</b> <b>summer</b> day. She flags down cars as the [...] "flag girl" [...] and dances as a [...] "tire girl" [...] in a kaleidoscope-inspired sequence, before jumping out of a pop out cake to the roars of the crowd below. [...] Several other scenes of Carey in a pink jumpsuit while riding {{on top of a}} race-car are shown, during which Cameo continues the race. A video was also made for the remix and retains most of the shots of the original. In it, Ludacris and Shawnna can be seen rapping together as they ride in an old car, while Da Brat and Twenty II rap together in a more modern car without a hood.|$|E

2500|$|Nageire, meaning [...] "thrown in", is {{associated}} with the legendary story of a samurai. The legend states that a samurai, bored <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>hot</b> <b>summer</b> day, threw plant material into the small opening of a tall, deep vase on the opposite corner of the room. Thus this style was named Nageire. This Ikebana form utilizes fresh and spontaneous designs that adhere only loosely to the classical principles of triangular structure and color harmony. Therefore, Nageire is less formal than Rikka, which was developing around the same time. Nageire was also practiced and around the time that Chabana and Shoka were developing.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{favourable}} assessment, for the NME, Alan Smith {{wrote that}} while on first listen he found McCartney [...] "too harmlessly mild", his view had changed with time, such that: [...] "Listening {{to it is}} like hearing a man's personal contentment committed {{to the sound of}} music. Most of the sounds, effects and ideas are sheer brilliance; much of the aura is of quiet songs <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>hot</b> <b>summer</b> night; and virtually all of the tracks reflect a kind of intangible roundness. 'Excitement' is not a word to use for this album ... 'warmth' and 'happiness' are." [...] In his combined review of all the former Beatles' 1970 solo releases, Geoffrey Cannon of The Guardian dismissed it as an album that had [...] "no substance". Cannon continued: [...] "Paul reveals himself in it as a man preoccupied with himself, and his own situation. The music is boastfully casual … He seems to believe that anything that comes into his head is worth having. And he's wrong." [...] John Gabree of High Fidelity magazine similarly bemoaned the expectation that [...] "we should dig his every little noise" [...] and found the reasons for the album's failure evident in the Let It Be film, where McCartney appeared to be [...] "the only Beatle who has stagnated as a human being", as well as [...] "incredibly arrogant" [...] in his treatment of his bandmates. Gabree added that [...] "Perhaps the greatest disappointment lies in the songs, although most of them could have been saved by better performances, especially the instrumentals." ...|$|E

It was near there that I could buy from pushcart men current books (that had been injured in the making or binding) for a few cents each. Then, right in the park itself, were little booths where one could buy glorious, ice-cold, sterilized milk and buttermilk at a penny a glass. Every afternoon I sat on a bench and read, and went on a milk debauch. I got away with from five to ten glasses each afternoon. It was dreadfully hot weather.|$|E

There were a good many cabin passengers aboard, and three or four hundred deck passengers--so it was said at the time--and not very {{many of them were}} astir. The wood being nearly all out of the flat now, Ealer rang to 'come ahead' full steam, and the next moment four of the eight boilers exploded with a thunderous crash, and the whole forward third of the boat was hoisted toward the sky!

6000|$|All {{these things}} had {{prepared}} an unfriendly fate for Diderot when {{his time at}} last came, as it came to most of his friends. For a month he was {{cut off from the}} outer world. His only company was the Paradise Lost, which he happened to have in his pocket at the moment of his arrest. He compounded an ink for himself, by scraping the slate at the side of his window, grinding it very fine, and mixing with wine in a broken glass. A toothpick, found by happy accident in the pocket of his waistcoat, served him for pen, and the fly-leaves and margins of the Milton made a repository for his thoughts. With a simple but very characteristic interest in others who might be as unfortunate as himself, he wrote upon the walls of his prison his short recipe for writing materials.[84] Diderot might easily have been buried here for months or even years. But, as it happened, the governor of Vincennes was a kinsman of Voltaire's divine Emily, the Marquise du Châtelet. When Voltaire, who was then at Luneville, heard of Diderot's ill-fortune, he proclaimed as usual his detestation of a land where bigots can shut up philosophers under lock and key, and as usual he at once set to work to lessen the wrong. Madame du Châtelet was made to write to the governor, praying him to soften the imprisonment of Socrates-Diderot as much as he could.[85] It was the last of her good deeds, for she died in circumstances of grotesque tragedy in the following month (Sept. 1749), and her husband, her son, Voltaire, and Saint Lambert alternately consoled and reproached one another over her grave. Diderot meanwhile had the benefit of her intervention. He was transferred from the dungeon to the château, was allowed to wander about the park on his parole, and to receive visits from his friends. One of the most impulsive of these friends was Jean Jacques. Their first meeting after Diderot's imprisonment has been, described by Rousseau himself, in terms at which the phlegmatic will smile--not wisely, for the manner of expressing emotion, like all else, is relative. [...] "After three or four centuries of impatience, I flew into the arms of my friend. O indescribable moment! He, was not alone; D'Alembert and the treasurer of the Sainte Chapelle were with him. As I went in, I saw no one but himself. With a single hound and a cry, I pressed his face close to mine, I clasped him tightly in my arms, without speaking to him save by my tears and sobs; I was choking with tenderness and joy."[86] After this Rousseau used to walk over to see him {{two or three times a}} week. It was during one of these walks <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>hot</b> <b>summer</b> afternoon, that he first thought of that memorable literary effort, the essay against civilisation. He sank down at the foot of a tree, and feverishly wrote a page or two to show to his friend. He tells us that but for Diderot's encouragement he should hardly have executed his design. There is a story that it was Diderot who first suggested to Rousseau to affirm that arts and sciences had corrupted manners. There is no violent improbability in this. Diderot, for all the robustness and penetration of his judgment, was yet often borne by his natural impetuosity towards the region of paradox. His own curious and bold Supplément au Voyage de Bougainville is entirely in the vein of Rousseau's discourse on the superiority of primitive over civilised life. [...] "Prodigious sibyl of the eighteenth century," [...] cries Michelet, [...] "the mighty magician Diderot! He breathed out one day a breath; lo, there sprang up a man--Rousseau."[87] It is hard to believe that such an astonishing genius for literature as Rousseau's could have lain concealed, after he had once inhaled the vivifying air of Paris. Yet the fire and inspiring energy of Diderot may well have been the quickening accident that brought his genius into productive life. All the testimony goes to show that it was so. Whether, however, Diderot is really responsible for the perverse direction of Rousseau's argument is a question of fact, and the evidence is not decisive.[88] It would be an odd example of that giant's nonchalance which is always so amazing in Diderot, if he really instigated the most eloquent and passionate writer then alive to denounce art and science as the scourge of mankind, at the very moment when he was himself straining his whole effort to spread the arts and sciences, and to cover them with glory in men's eyes.|$|E

5000|$|Cumulonimbus storm {{cells can}} produce torrential rain of a {{convective}} nature (often {{in the form}} of a rain shaft) and flash flooding, as well as straight-line winds.

If there is enough solar energy in the atmosphere, however (<b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>hot</b> <b>summer's</b> day, for example), the moisture from one storm cell can evaporate rapidly—resulting in a new cell forming just a few miles from the former one. This can cause thunderstorms to last for several hours. Cumulonimbus clouds can also bring dangerous winter storms (called [...] "blizzards") which bring lightning, thunder, and torrential snow.
