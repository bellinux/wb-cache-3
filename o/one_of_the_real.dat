500|$|The {{first season}} of Grey's {{received}} mostly positive reviews from the critics. In {{regard to the}} first season, New York Daily News named Grey's Anatomy a [...] "winner", whereas Newsday expressed a positive opinion by stating [...] "You simply can't stop watching." [...] Walter Chaw from Film Freak Central said the show was [...] "so odious, so repugnant, that it's impossible not to have predicted its newly-minted role as the most popular program in the land." [...] The Washington Posts Tom Shales was critical of the early series, finding it reminiscent of ER and commenting that: [...] "The show is much {{more a matter of}} commercial calculation than an honest attempt to try something fresh and different". He called Rhimes' script for the pilot episode [...] "nothing but a casserole made of equal parts ham and corn", writing that overall: [...] "It's a 'new' show only in the sense that Dr. Frankenstein's monster was a new man." [...] Kate Aurthur for The New York Times deemed the show a hybrid of Ally McBeal, Sex and the City and ER, writing of the news that it had become the highest-rated midseason drama in 12 years that: [...] "When you parse its ratings, Grey's Anatomy underscores <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> lessons of the current season - men will watch shows with a female lead. That goes against conventional wisdom, which dictates that it's easier to get women to watch shows aimed at men." [...] Review Stream gave positive reviews regarding the pilot episode, [...] "A Hard Day's Night", due to the undeniable chemistry between Ellen Pompeo and Patrick Dempsey from the series' first scene. Regarding Miranda Bailey's appearance in the pilot, ReviewStream.com stated [...] "She's such a small woman but wait until she speaks". HomeTheaterInfo.com, however, had a mixed perspectives on the pilot, noting that the storylines were similar to fellow ABC series Desperate Housewives, but also [...] "brilliantly written, extremely well acted and directed to near perfection". IGN gave a positive review stating, [...] "The show isn't derivative, and actually maintains a tenuous edge over its predecessor, the characters resemble real people - who are fragile, and yes, fallible." [...] and added, [...] "this facile description does little justice to the show's tightly-wound plotting, character subtleties, or masterful acting, it speaks to the intangible nature of what differentiates the wheat from the chaff, so to speak, in network television." ...|$|E

She quickly found success, winning silver medals at the Panama-California Exposition in 1914 and 1915 in San Diego. Shore also showed work in juried exhibitions of the California Art Club to positive reviews. One 1916 review published in the Fine Arts Journal grouped her under the label of [...] "the modernists" [...] and declared her {{one of the best}} artists of the group among those who studied with Robert Henri. Of her work the reviewer comments, [...] "Miss Shore tempers her pigment with intelligence and understanding, and brings to her work an acute knowledge of psychology as well as sound technique, a thorough art training and a rare artistic perception. Her exceptional canvas, called [...] "Mother and Child," [...] is unquestionably <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> gems of the exhibition." [...] In 1916, Shore was a founding member of The Los Angeles Modern Art Society along with Bert Cressey, Meta Cressey, Helena Dunlap, Edgar Kellar and Karl Yens. Undoubtedly influenced by The Eight (Ashcan School) show in New York City, The Los Angeles Modern Art Society sought to give additional exposure to more experimental artists outside the juried shows of the California Art Club.|$|E
