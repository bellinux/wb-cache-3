25|$|Carlito buys train {{tickets to}} Miami {{for himself and}} Gail, now pregnant. When he stops by his club to get the stashed money, Carlito is met {{by a group of}} mobsters led by Vinnie. The Italians plan on killing Carlito, but he manages to slip out through a secret exit. The Italians pursue him {{throughout}} the city's subway system and into Grand Central Terminal, where they engage in a gunfight. Carlito kills all of his pursuers except Vinnie, who is shot and killed by police attracted by the gunfire. As Carlito runs to catch the train where Gail and Pachanga are waiting for him, he is ambushed by a disguised Benny, who shoots Carlito several times in the abdomen with a silenced gun. Pachanga admits to the dying Carlito that he is now working for Benny, only to be shot as well. Carlito hands a tearful Gail the money and tells her to escape with their unborn child and start a new life elsewhere. As he is wheeled away <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>gurney,</b> Carlito stares at a billboard with a Caribbean beach and a picture of a woman. The billboard then comes to life in his mind, and the woman, who is clearly Gail, starts dancing as Carlito slowly dies.|$|E
500|$|When Owen Hart was to {{challenge}} The Godfather for the WWF Intercontinental Champion's title, he was performing as the Blue Blazer. The character, originally used by Hart {{in the late}} 1980s, had recently been revived as a superhero gimmick that parodied various wrestlers. At Over the Edge, Hart was to emulate World Championship Wrestling (WCW) wrestler Sting's (Steve Borden) ring entrance by descending from the arena rafters into the ring. The entrance was successfully tested on the November 15, 1998, episode of Sunday Night Heat; however, during his descent at Over the Edge, a cable disengaged from the safety vest he wore, and he fell more than [...] from the rafters into the ring. As he fell, he landed chest-first {{on one of the}} ring's padded turnbuckles. The accident was not seen by television viewers. A pre-recorded interview video was shown at the start of Hart's descent, and when the broadcast returned live, the cameras quickly turned away from the ring to the audience. Soon afterward, Jim Ross, one of the commentators of the event, informed pay-per-view viewers that Hart had fallen from the rafters, that the incident was [...] "not a part of the entertainment" [...] and that it was [...] "a real situation". EMTs came down to the ring and gave Hart CPR, but he showed no response to the treatment. Bringing Hart out <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>gurney,</b> the EMTs boarded the heavily injured wrestler into an ambulance and took him to a nearby hospital in Kansas City.|$|E
2500|$|On November 22, 1963, Rose was in {{his office}} at Parkland Memorial Hospital across the {{corridor}} from Trauma Room 1 when he received word that Kennedy was pronounced dead. He walked across the corridor to the trauma room occupied by Jacqueline Kennedy and a priest who had been called in to administer last rites. There, Rose was met by Secret Service agent Roy Kellerman and Kennedy's personal physician George Burkley who told him that {{there was no time for}} an autopsy because Mrs. Kennedy would not leave Dallas without her husband's body which was to be delivered promptly to the airport. At the time of the assassination of Kennedy, the murder of a United States President was not covered by federal law. Rose objected, insisting that Texas law required him to perform a post-mortem examination prior to the removal of the body. A heated exchange ensued as he argued with Kennedy's aides. Kennedy's body was placed in a casket and, accompanied by Mrs. Kennedy, rolled down the corridor <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>gurney.</b> Rose was reported to have stood in a hospital doorway, backed by a policeman, in an attempt to prevent the removal of the coffin. According to Robert Caro's , the President's aides [...] "had literally shoved [...] and the policeman aside to get out of the building." [...] In an interview with Journal of the American Medical Association, Rose stated that he stepped aside feeling that it was unwise to exacerbate the tension.|$|E

40|$|Objectives. Restraint of {{patients}} <b>on</b> <b>a</b> spine board {{has been used}} in the past to prevent further spinal cord injury after rescue {{of patients}} from the scene of an accident. Removal from the spine board is a routine protocol in many hospitals once the patient has been cleared of spinal injury. However, the benefit of using a spine board, in light-weight motorcycle-related accident victims, has never been studied before. Materials and methods. A retrospective observational study enrolled patients who had sustained motorcycle-related accidents and were brought to our emergency department (ED). Patients with a Glasgow Coma Scale score lower than 15 and those who died at the ED, or had incomplete data, were excluded. The diagnosis of spinal injury was based upon clinical evaluation and was confirmed by computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging or X-ray reports, as interpreted by a qualified radiologist. A neurological examination was performed, according to the Standard Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury, directly after arrival and again before leaving the ED. Results. During the study period, from January 2007 to December 2010, 91 patients with spinal injuries who met the inclusion criteria, consisting of 35 male and 56 female patients {{with a mean age of}} 45. 44 ± 18. 12 years, were enrolled in our study. The scores of the motor and sensory neurological exams did not show any significant change during the ED stay after being placed in <b>a</b> <b>gurney</b> without <b>a</b> spine board (p= 0. 432). Conclusions. Removal of the spine board and placement <b>on</b> <b>a</b> hospital <b>gurney</b> sponge is safe in alert patients whose primary examination is completed at the ED...|$|R
