50|$|The Namaqua United Copper Company {{was formed}} {{to take over the}} Namaqua Copper Company from 1 January 1888 and, on 14 May 1888, it was reconstructed as the Namaqua Copper Company. In 1889, the mine built a 7+1/2 mi branch line from Braakpits Junction, near O'okiep, to Flat Mine where the Company's <b>ore</b> <b>crusher</b> was located. The line was opened to traffic on 23 April 1889. Braakpits Junction was on the Namaqualand Railway of the Cape Copper Company, which ran from Port Nolloth on the West Coast to the copper mines around O'okiep.|$|E

50|$|Volunteers {{played a}} vital part in the museum {{especially}} {{when it came to}} transporting heavier objects to the museum such as a Derbyshire <b>ore</b> <b>crusher</b> which was moved over the moors to a van which took it to the museum where it was restored and unveiled to the public in 1970. Volunteers did other tasks such as labelling exhibits, carrying out research on the collection and cleaning displays. The friends also funded excavations the most notable being a tilery kiln in nearby Rylstone. On 11 December 1973 the museum was officially moved across the road to its current location in Skipton Town Hall.|$|E

The lease at Copper Canyon {{appears to have been}} quickly ended though by 1945. It also appears that sometime in this era the company looked into creating a busing company to transport employees to work at the Tooele smelter known as the International Bus Company, but those plans failed to come to fruition [...]|$|E

50|$|The Homeward Bound Battery and Dam is {{significant}} in Queensland's history {{as one of}} the mining settlements, or suburbs of Croydon, on the former Croydon Goldfield. The place demonstrates a number of stages in the development of Croydon Goldfield - British investment in <b>ore</b> <b>crushing,</b> then cyaniding to fully extract any remaining gold once a permanent water supply had been secured.|$|R
50|$|In the beginning, {{the miners}} panned for gold or smashed quartz rocks with hand tools at small {{individual}} claims. Within a year, companies began {{arriving in the}} area with heavy machinery to construct shafts, dig <b>ore,</b> <b>crush</b> rock, and process the gold. They had the capital to finance underground mines and bought up smaller claims, consolidating them into larger holdings.|$|R
40|$|Off-highway tire costs {{represent}} {{a significant portion}} of the total mining costs in openpit, truck-shovel operations. To extend the lives of tires, the site-specific factors influencing tire life should be investigated. Valuable data can be obtained by combining historical operational data captured by a mine dispatch system with detailed tire and maintenance histories. Assuming that failure counts satisfy a Poisson distribution, F-tests can be applied to determine significant deviations from desired or target counts. The methodology developed in this paper can be used to identify the haul routes and loading and dumping zones that have significantly higher incidences of tire failure. Corrective action can then be targeted at these zones by modifying the shovel or truck operator practices; changing the haul route maintenance and clean up practices; or altering the bench, ramp or waste dump design parameters. An example is given of the correlation of tire separation and tire impact failures with haul routes for a fleet of nine Caterpillar 793 C trucks in operation at the Chuquicamata Mine in northern Chile. A high incidence of impact failures was observed for the 2 ̆ 7 ex-pit <b>ore</b> <b>crusher</b> and for tires installed in the left outer rear position on the trucks. The latter was postulated to be due to a preference for drivers to execute right-hand turns prior to dumping. Recommendations were made to revise crusher and dump cleanup practices and investigate the feasibility of super-elevating the surface of dumping zones to reduce ground pressure on the left rear tires...|$|E
