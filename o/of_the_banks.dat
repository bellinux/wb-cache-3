5|$|Despite all the improvements, serious {{flooding}} {{occurred in}} 1999 when {{the bank of}} the drain was breached near Pinchbeck. Staff from the Environment Agency and the Black Sluice Internal Drainage Board successfully repaired the breach before properties were flooded, and a review of the flood defences was then carried out.

5|$|As {{with many}} banks around the world, the Icelandic banks found it {{increasingly}} difficult or impossible to roll over their loans in the interbank market, their creditors insisting on payment while no other banks were willing to make fresh loans. In such a situation, a bank would normally {{have to ask for}} a loan from the central bank as the lender of last resort. However, in Iceland the banks were so much larger than the national economy that the Central Bank of Iceland and the Icelandic government could not guarantee the payment of the banks' debts, leading to the collapse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>banks.</b> The official reserves of the Central Bank of Iceland stood at 374.8 billion krónur at the end of September 2008, compared with 350.3 billion krónur of short-term international debt in the Icelandic banking sector, and at least £6.5 billion (1,250 billion krónur) of retail deposits in the UK.|$|E

40|$|The article studies {{theoretical}} aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> realisation {{of financial}} planning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank’s</b> activity and identifies and justifies its six main stages: 1) goal formation stage; 2) preparation stage; 3) assessment; 4) financial plan approval; 5) financial plan execution, and 6) stage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> financial plan monitoring, control and adjustment. <b>The</b> above sequence <b>of</b> stages <b>of</b> <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> realisation of financial planning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank’s</b> activity allows a trustworthy assessment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank’s</b> activity environment, formation of specific goals and tasks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank’s</b> activity, {{and also to}} determine <b>the</b> ways <b>of</b> their achievement, and so on. <b>The</b> result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> realisation of financial planning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank’s</b> activity is <b>the</b> <b>bank’s</b> financial plan, which is proposed to divide into four sub-sections: plan <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank’s</b> assets and liabilities; plan <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank’s</b> receipts and expenditures; plan <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank’s</b> cash flows; and plan of forecast values of basic financial indicators <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank’s</b> activity...|$|R
40|$|The {{spatial and}} {{temporal}} variability of inner-shelf circulation along the central Oregon coast during the 2004 upwelling season is described using a 70 -km-long array <b>of</b> moorings along <b>the</b> 15 -m isobath. Circulation at three stations located onshore of a submarine bank differed {{from that of a}} station north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank,</b> despite <b>the</b> relatively uniform wind forcing and inner-shelf bathymetry present. During upwelling-favorable winds, strong southward alongshelf flow occurred north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank,</b> no alongshelf flow occurred onshore <b>of</b> <b>the</b> northern part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank,</b> and increasing southward flow occurred onshore <b>of</b> <b>the</b> southern part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank.</b> During downwelling-favorable winds, strong northward flow occurred in the inner shelf onshore <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> while weak flow occurred north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank.</b> These alongshelf differences in inner-shelf circulation were due to <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank,</b> which isolated <b>the</b> inner shelf onshore <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> from <b>the</b> regional upwelling circulation that was evident at the northernmost station. As a result, circulation onshore <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> was driven primarily by local wind forcing, while flow north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> was only partially driven by local winds. A secondary mode of variability, attributed to <b>the</b> movement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> regional upwelling jet due to remote forcings, contributed <b>the</b> bulk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> variability observed north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank.</b> With <b>the</b> time-dependent wind forcing present, acceleration was an important term in the depth-averaged alongshelf momentum equation at all stations. During upwelling, bottom stress and acceleration opposed the wind stress north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank,</b> while bottom stress was weaker onshore <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> where <b>the</b> across-shelf momentum flux and the alongshelf pressure gradient balanced <b>the</b> residual <b>of</b> <b>the</b> acceleration and stresses. During downwelling, waters onshore <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> surged northward at magnitudes much larger than that found north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank.</b> These spatial variations developed as the season progressed and the regional upwelling circulation intensified, explaining known variations in growth and recruitment of nearshore invertebrate species...|$|R
5|$|Iceland's {{financial}} position has steadily improved since the crash. The economic contraction and rise in unemployment {{appear to have}} been arrested by late 2010 and with growth under way in mid-2011. Three main factors have been important in this regard. First is the emergency legislation passed by the Icelandic parliament in October 2008. It served to minimise the impact of the financial crisis on the country. The Financial Supervisory Authority of Iceland used permission granted by the emergency legislation to take over the domestic operations of the three largest banks. The much larger foreign operations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>banks,</b> however, went into receivership.|$|E
5|$|St Kilda is {{adjacent}} to the mangrove forest bordering Barker Inlet, part of the largest tidal estuary of Gulf St Vincent. Late in the 19th Century embankments were constructed through the mangroves {{in an effort to}} reclaim land for pasturing. With the construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>banks</b> of the adjacent saltfields maintenance of the embankments ceased and the mangroves began to reclaim them. One of these embankments is used as the beginning of a boardwalk through the mangroves which forms a 1.7km loop through the samphire saltmarsh flats and mangroves reaching the border between the ocean and forest.|$|E
5|$|Adam Mort's {{descendants}} {{continued to}} support the chapel and school and remained at Damhouse until 1734 when it was bought by Thomas Sutton. After Sutton's death in 1752 the house was inherited by Thomas Froggatt of Bakewell who contributed to rebuilding the chapel in 1760. Froggatt's descendants owned Damhouse until 1800 when it was leased to tenants, {{one of whom was}} George Ormerod, owner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Banks</b> Estate in Tyldesley who gave land for its churchyard and church school. In 1839 the house became the property of Captain Adam Durie of Craig Lascar by marriage to Sarah Froggatt. Damhouse was dilapidated when the Duries moved in. Captain Durie gave land to build a school on Church Road. After his death in 1843 his widow, Sarah, married Colonel Malcolm Nugent Ross. The Ross's Arms public house at Higher Green is named in his honour. The Durie's daughter Katharine, who married first, Henry Davenport and second Sir Edward Robert Weatherall, became lady of the manor after her mother's death but the family was in financial difficulties and the house and estate sold in November 1889.|$|E

5|$|Edwards' {{trial was}} in June 1842 {{and was a}} media sensation. He secured a defense team of six lawyers, {{including}} John J. Crittenden, a sitting U. S. Senator, and Thomas F. Marshall, a sitting U. S. Representative. Both Crittenden and Marshall absented themselves from their legislative duties during the trial. One of the junior lawyers was William M. Evarts, who presented the opening remarks for the defense. Another defense lawyer was John Worth Edmonds, who Edwards paid with a forged check. Edwards' handsome appearance worked against him, {{when one of the}} bankers who had cashed the drafts identified him in court and remarked that he remembered Edwards because of his striking good looks. Edwards had also neglected to dispose of a marked bank bag from one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>banks</b> that cashed the fraudulently obtained draft. A final tie-in was the commonality of misspellings between letters from Edwards and the forged letters. The trial ended with Edwards being convicted and given a 10-year prison sentence. The trial's proceedings were published by a New York newspaper, The Herald, and ran to 50,000 copies. None of Edwards' lawyers were ever paid for their services. He was sent to Sing Sing prison, where he attempted to use forged letters to escape. Edwards died in prison on January 27, 1847, of consumption. He was insane {{at the time of his}} death.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom, {{its range}} is {{currently}} restricted to about 45km <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>banks</b> of the River Ouse centred on York, North Yorkshire. Although there are scattered records from across England {{some of these}} may represent mis-identifications of the mint beetle, a more widespread species. Tansy beetles had previously been recorded from Wicken Fen, Cambridgeshire, where species of mint (Mentha spp.), not tansy, acted as the host plant. The last accurate record for the beetle at this site was in 1981. In August 2014 a new sighting was made nearby at Woodwalton Fen, following which a relocation programme involving hundreds of adult beetles from Yorkshire to this site was undertaken. As of 2006 there were 19 British hectads (10km squares) with records of the tansy beetle, but it has only been seen in 11 of these since 1970, six of which are centred around York. In 2015, {{the total number of}} individuals estimated from a survey of this area {{on the banks of the}} River Ouse was 24,000. In 2016 this number increased significantly to 40,000.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} {{formally}} designated as 'Nationally Rare' in the United Kingdom and categorised as a 'Species of Principal Importance' {{in accordance with}} the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006. The Tansy Beetle Action Group was set up in 2008 to initiate and oversee conservation efforts and comprises representatives from the University of York, North Yorkshire County Council, City of York Council, Environment Agency and the National Trust. A recovery programme started, involving annual surveys of both tansy and beetles, control of tree shading and invasive plants that compete with tansy, such as Himalayan balsam, and limited re-introductions within the current species range. New clumps of tansy have been planted, particularly between isolated existing patches which may be beyond the 200m walking range of the beetle. In order to publicise the conservation project Rachael Maskell, the Member of Parliament for the constituency of York Central became a 'Tansy Beetle Species Champion' in 2016. That same year, a team of 30 volunteers surveyed a 90km stretch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>banks</b> of the River Ouse. The surveying has identified an upward trend in population numbers, rising over 60% between 2015 and 2016 to 40,000 individuals.|$|E
