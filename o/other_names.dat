5|$|Evaluative {{conditioning}} {{suggests that}} if the name is liked then the name letters will be liked too. This would occur through repeated visual association of the name letters with the name. Martin and Levey defined evaluative conditioning as a variation of classical conditioning in which we come to like or dislike something through an association. Given the observation that our own name stands out among others as quite an attractive stimulus, as Cherry found in the cocktail party effect, {{it could be that}} the name-letter effect results from evaluative conditioning. Feys set up a controlled study with Flemish subjects, pairing unfamiliar symbols (Japanese kanji) with subjects' own names, and with <b>other</b> <b>names.</b> He found that there was no difference in how much subjects liked the kanji symbol representing their own name or <b>other</b> <b>names.</b> He concluded that evaluative conditioning is not the primary cause of the name-letter effect.|$|E

5|$|Otto Kuntze and Howard James Banker later {{independently}} {{sought to}} restore Linnaeus' species name, but the resulting combination (Auriscalpium auriscalpium) is a tautonym and disallowed {{under the rules}} for botanical nomenclature (ICBN 2005 rule 23.4), and these combinations are therefore no longer validly published. <b>Other</b> <b>names</b> given to the fungus and now considered synonyms include Hydnum fechtneri, named by Josef Velenovský in 1922, and later combinations based on this name. A.vulgare is the type species of the widely distributed genus of eight species that it belongs to.|$|E

Before that became commonplace, <b>other</b> <b>names</b> such as Islas del Poniente (Islands of the West) and Magellan's name for the islands San Lázaro were also used by the Spanish to refer to the islands.|$|E
5|$|The arch is {{considered}} to have no functional significance, although this is challenged by some authors. It {{plays a role in}} entrapment of nearby structures and may alter local anatomy in the event that a dissection of the local area is needed during surgery. The arch appears to arise from the panniculus carnosus, a structure found in most non-primate mammals, and has similarities with muscles found in many animals. The axillary arch has several <b>other</b> <b>names</b> including Langer's axillary arch, the muscle of Langer, axillopectoral muscle, Achselbogen and pectorodorsalis muscle.|$|E
