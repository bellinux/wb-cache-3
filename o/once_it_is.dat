5|$|After the Kid {{returns and}} recovers, Rucks gives him another choice: He {{can have the}} Bastion rewind time to before the Calamity {{in the hopes of}} {{preventing}} it, or use it to evacuate the survivors and move on to somewhere safe. Rucks is unsure if there is any way to prevent the Calamity from reoccurring if the time is rewound, as {{there was no way to}} test the process. The game ends either way, showing images of the characters (with the inclusion of Zulf if the player chose to rescue him) flying away or of their lives before the Calamity along with the credits.

5|$|Megatron sends Starscream, and {{his twin}} {{brothers}} Thundercracker and Skywarp to reactivate an Energon bridge which will feed the station with raw Energon, allowing the manufacturing of more Dark Energon. Once they succeed, Megatron then develops {{a plan to}} infect the core of Cybertron with Dark Energon, feeling that he can {{gain control of the}} planet <b>once</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> infected. He launches a full-scale assault on the Autobot capital city of Iacon, looking for an item called the Omega Key, which he will use to enter Cybertron's core and infect it. The Decepticons learn that Zeta Prime has placed the key under his personal guard. Megatron's forces enter the chambers of Zeta Prime and defeat him in battle. Zeta Prime tells Megatron that the Omega Key is not actually what unlocks access to the core, but is the means to activate the true key, a colossal Transformer known as Omega Supreme. After hearing this, Megatron presumably kills Zeta Prime.|$|E
5|$|Previously, SR125 had {{a direct}} {{connection}} with SR905 via two at-grade intersections on Otay Mesa Road. With {{the completion of the}} freeway segment of SR905 and the freeway-to-freeway connection to SR 125 unconstructed, traffic on SR 125 must head west on Otay Mesa Road and south on La Media Road to make the connection. A freeway-to-freeway interchange is planned for the connection between SR125 and SR905, and construction began in late 2015; there are also plans to connect to the new SR 11 freeway <b>once</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> constructed. SR11 is planned to be a toll facility that will serve a new border crossing east of Otay Mesa.

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{evidence for}} {{occupation of the}} citadel mound dates to the 5th millennium BC, and possibly earlier. It appears {{for the first time}} in historical sources in the Ebla tablets around 2,300 BC, and gained particular importance during the Neo-Assyrian period. During the Sassanian period and the Abbasid Caliphate, Erbil was an important centre for Christianity. After the Mongols captured the citadel in 1258, the importance of Erbil declined. During the 20th century, the urban structure was significantly modified, as a result of which a number of houses and public buildings were destroyed. In 2007, the High Commission for Erbil Citadel Revitalization (HCECR) was established to oversee the restoration of the citadel. In the same year, all inhabitants, except one family, were evicted from the citadel as part of a large restoration project. Since then, archaeological research and restoration works have been carried out at and around the tell by various international teams and in cooperation with local specialists. The government plans to have 50 families live in the citadel <b>once</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> renovated.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} {{political}} institutions which hold {{the executive and}} legislative power of the Union. The Council of the European Union represents governments, the Parliament represents citizens and the Commission represents the European interest. Essentially, the Council of the European Union, Parliament or another party place a request for legislation to the Commission. The Commission then drafts this and presents it to the Parliament and the Council of the European Union, where in most cases both must give their assent. Although {{the exact nature of}} this depends upon the legislative procedure in use, <b>once</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> approved and signed by both bodies it becomes law. The Commission's duty is to ensure it is implemented by dealing with the day-to-day running of the Union and taking others to Court if they fail to comply. According to the 2014 edition of The Official Directory of the European Union, women account for 33% of higher-ranking officials.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} process, the Proprietors leased {{the canal}} to British Waterways in 2005. However, British Waterways had to {{withdraw}} from the scheme in 2008, due to financial difficulties, and the role of project leaders was taken over by Stroud District Council. Following the re-organisation, the Stroud Valleys Canal Company was established in March 2009. It is a limited company, with two independent directors and three directors representing Stroud District Council, the Proprietors, and the Cotswold Canals Trust. Its purpose is to hold the assets for the canals, and its charitable status means that stamp duty land tax {{does not have to be}} paid. The company will be responsible for management and maintenance of the canal <b>once</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> re-opened. The Department for Transport is in the process of reorganising how funding for major transport schemes is managed, and this has enabled Stroud District Council to submit a bid for £1.5 million to the newly formed Gloucestershire Local Transport Board. This is to fund the replacement of Ocean railway culvert with a bridge. A second application for £650,000 has been made to enable part of the Thames and Severn Way long distance footpath to be created. The funding is for the section from Saul Junction to Chalford.|$|E

5|$|In the Catch 'Em Mode, players must {{reveal a}} {{silhouette}} of a Pokémon by hitting bumpers. <b>Once</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> revealed, players must hit the Pokémon that appears three times with the ball as it sits in one spot before the time runs out. Egg Mode is a similar concept, though the baby Pokémon roam around the board as opposed to standard Pokémon, which stand still. As opposed to being timed, players must capture it before it returns from whence it came. Evolution Mode is also similar, requiring players to hit all of the evolution item markers in order to evolve their Pokémon that they have caught or hatched. These include several traditional means of evolution in the Pokémon series, such as stones and experience points. Lastly, Travel Mode allows players to leave the current location on their pinball board, allowing them to capture more kinds of Pokémon {{not found in the}} current area. Ruby & Sapphire featured additional bonus modes that often diverge from the standard gameplay. These modes sometimes feature rare Pokémon such as Groudon, Kyogre, and Rayquaza, and take place on separate fields. Outside of the gameplay, players may also view the Pokémon they have caught, listen to sound effects and music from the game, and view their high scores for each board.|$|E
5|$|Paul meets an old friend, Kim Taylor (Jenny Young), and learns he is {{the father}} of her sons David (Takaya Honda) and Leo Tanaka (Tim Kano).

After receiving compensation from the Quill group, Paul buys and moves back into the Lassiter's Penthouse, with Amy and Jimmy. Terese confides in Paul that she has breast cancer, and he does his best to support her. However, <b>once</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> obvious that her chemotherapy is not working, Terese visits her brother Nick in prison, who is later granted bail with the help of Clive Gibbons (Geoff Paine), much to Paul's chagrin. Paul soon learns that Amy and Nick are dating. In addition, Paul and Leo are bought out of Robinsons after Amy encourages Steph to help Nick set up a wellness centre in the premises. Paul and Terese have sex, but she chooses to stay with Gary. After attempting to give Nick money to leave town, Paul frames him by having someone plant stolen medication in Nick's hotel room, resulting in his parole being revoked. Amy is furious to discover that Paul has set Nick up, and when Paul does not confess his crime to the police, she and Jimmy move back into No. 26. After Terese makes it clear that she and Paul will never be in a relationship, and Amy refuses to move back into the penthouse, Paul decides to leave Erinsborough for a few weeks supposedly to visit his family in New York City, but David reveals that Paul never arrived. Paul returns a few weeks later and reveals he is engaged to Courtney Grixti (Emma Lane). He also buys Mr Udagawa's (Lawrence Mah) share of Lassiters making him Terese's boss.|$|E
