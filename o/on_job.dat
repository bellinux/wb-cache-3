5|$|The Greater London Labour Manifesto for the 1981 elections, {{although}} written under McIntosh's leadership, {{had been}} {{determined by a}} special conference of the London Labour Party in October 1980 in which Livingstone's speech had been decisive on transport policy. The manifesto focused <b>on</b> <b>job</b> creation schemes and cutting London Transport fares, and it was to these issues that Livingstone's administration turned. One primary manifesto focus had been a pledge known as Fares Fair, which focused on reducing London Underground fares and freezing them at that lower rate. Based on a fare freeze implemented by the South Yorkshire Metropolitan County Council in 1975, it was widely {{considered to be a}} moderate and mainstream policy by Labour, which it was hoped would get more Londoners using public transport, thereby reducing congestion. In October 1981, the GLC implemented their policy, cutting London Transport fares by 32%; to fund the move, the GLC planned to increase the London rates.|$|E

5|$|There is an {{impending}} real estate boom in Saudi Arabia, with increasing demand and rising prices {{due to high}} population growth and a short supply of housing, which may include a demand for high-end luxury units, {{such as those in}} Jeddah Tower. To boost growth, the Saudi Arabian government is going to invest US$67 billion (SR251 billion) in building 500,000homes throughout the country. According to Saudi officials, about 900 new homes are needed a day to meet the demand of the rapidly growing population, which has nearly quadrupled in the past four decades. Jeddah Tower is also an attempt to diversify Saudi Arabia's economy, which, holding a quarter of the world's oil reserves and being one of the founding OPEC nations, is currently largely dependent on its crude oil exportation, which accounts for nearly 75% of government revenues and 90% of exports. This generates enough income to support Saudi Arabia as a welfare state, which spends billions of dollars <b>on</b> <b>job</b> creation and housing for its lower income residents.|$|E
