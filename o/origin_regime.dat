40|$|We {{evaluate}} the incentives for strategic commodity tax-setting under destination and <b>origin</b> <b>regimes</b> when competition is imperfect and commodity taxes {{must be used}} to finance the government budget. Different cases of international duopoly are compared, where firms compete over quantities or prices and markets are segmented or integrated.

40|$|The Nagoya Protocol {{requires}} {{states to}} ensure that access to and use of genetic resources and traditional knowledge of Indigenous peoples and local communities is subject to their prior informed consent (PIC). It also requires states {{to take into consideration}} their customary laws. However, it lacks effective compliance mechanisms, a gap exposed in draft European legislation that sidesteps the Nagoya Protocol’s obligations regarding PIC and customary law, leaving traditional knowledge largely unprotected. This article examines the status of customary law under international, regional and national law, and the challenges and opportunities for securing recognition of its role in the protection of traditional knowledge. The article contends that all commercial and development activities with the potential to impact on Nagoya Protocol rights will in the future need to ensure compliance with relevant customary law. It finds state reluctance to adopt measures to ensure consideration of customary law shortsighted and likely to lead to increased litigation. It concludes that customary law has a key role to play in closing the Nagoya compliance gap but to do so it will need to be supported by enforcement mechanisms such as disclosure of <b>origin</b> <b>regimes</b> in intellectual property law...|$|R
40|$|Rules {{of origin}} (RoO) are a central topic {{both in the}} Inter-Regional Association Agreement {{negotiations}} between the European Union (EU) and the Southern Common Market (Mercosur), and in the 34 -country negotiations of the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA). The {{purpose of this paper}} is to provide a detailed mapping of the different rules of <b>origin</b> <b>regimes</b> in FTAs in Europe and the Americas, and to draw lessons from these regimes to the EU-Mercosur RoO negotiations, in particular. The paper offers four recommendations. First, the EU¿s standardized RoO regime will play a central role in the EU-Mercosur RoO negotiations. However, there is plenty of room for mutual tariff concessions. At the minimum, the EU¿s tariff preferences for Mercosur should approximate those provided to Chile in order to foster Mercosur¿s chances to augment its industrial exports to the European market. Second, the EU-Mercosur FTA RoO regime should incorporate general and sector-specific adjustment mechanisms in order to enable Mercosur to better utilize the preferential treatment provided by the EU. Third, Mercosur will need to further consolidate its common market in order to take full advantage of the RoO regime¿s likely provision of diagonal cumulation. Fourth, Mercosur should make the most of its strategy of simultaneous trade negotiations in the Americas and with the EU by ensuring a high degree of compatibility between its two major future agreements...|$|R

40|$|Regional trade {{agreements}} (RTAs) provide countries with many benefits. The {{multilateral trading system}} also receives these benefits, as successive and overlapping RTAs are the building blocks for the most viable and realistic path to global free trade. Nonetheless, the spread of criss-crossing RTAs {{in the world has}} generated serious problems, including rising transaction costs. While pursuing the long-term goal of harmonizing preferential rules of origin (ROOs), countries need to actively implement the diagonal or full accumulation system on a sectoral basis, starting from the sectors in which identical product-specific rules among participating countries have been introduced. The adoption of coequality in the change in tariff classification and regional value content (VC) rules also give trading firms more flexibility. If WTO members are able to set up model ROOs, the degree of each RTA's deviation from this benchmark may be calculated and certain modalities for its reduction could be negotiated multilaterally. In the longer term, other systemic rules on top of ROOs need to be converged or harmonized across RTAs on a regional or global basis. The effort to defragment fragmented RTAs should continue even beyond the time when most favoured nation (MFN) tariff rates go down to zero worldwide. Even if all preferential <b>origin</b> <b>regimes</b> shall have become irrelevant by then, various other rules and procedures will still have to be converged and harmonized across RTAs.

40|$|This Working Paper is a {{collection}} of contributions presented during the Workshop "Framework for Economic Development in EU External Relations on 22 nd and 23 rd January 2010. The contributions explore various facets of what is known as economic development and what with time has incorporated many new aspects and developed links with other policy fields. Starting off with the traditional realm of the development policies – trade – the paper shifts to explore how the solely economic notion of development has been enhanced through the introduction of the concept of sustainable development, and how this concept was integrated into two policy areas – that of migration and human rights. Each of the contributors provides an in-depth analysis of a respective facet which build up a very complex picture of what economic development in EU external relations has become.

The transitional government was also urged to join the Kimberley Process and establish its authority over the timber producing areas, including through oversight mechanisms, as soon as possible.

Volume 2 : AnnexesDefence date: 4 June 2013 The {{analysis}} of rationales for preferential {{rules of origin}} presented in the thesis brings forward the assumptions that, contrary {{to what has been}} written in the literature, it still seems legitimate to maintain preferential rules of origin as distinct from non-preferential rules of origin. However, multiplication of rules of <b>origin</b> <b>regimes</b> causes systemic problems and fairness concerns. The thesis aims therefore at analysing diversification and harmonisation patterns and their interaction with the systemic problems identified. The final objective of the thesis is to analyse the possible methods for regulating rules of origin in light of these systemic issues. The thesis employs an interdisciplinary approach in order to understand rationales for and systemic problems derived from preferential rules of origin. The methodology, adopted to understand patterns of diversification and harmonisation, combines instead comparative analysis and case study approach with the {{analysis of}} WCO and WTO law. While it is impossible to find a solution that could solve all the systemic problems (beside the complete abolition of the rules), this thesis argues that the first objective of the WTO should be to achieve a greater level of correspondence between rules of origin and MFN concessions and address fairness concerns. This should allow the enforcement of rules of origin in line with article XXIV GATT, while recognising the particular role of preferential rules of origin in guaranteeing that the partner only benefits from the preferential liberalisation. Contrary to the current literature, the thesis hints that this can be addressed effectively without resorting to international substantial harmonisation and without leaving regulation simply to partial regional harmonisation processes, which are respectively either politically difficult to achieve or ineffective means for properly addressing systemic issues related to rules of origin...|$|R

40|$|Work in progress- {{please do}} not quote) We examine the {{interaction}} between parallel trade and commodity taxes in a simple two-country model with imperfect competition. While governments determine non-cooperatively their commodity tax rate that can be based on either a destination or <b>origin</b> <b>regime,</b> the volume of parallel imports is deter-mined endogenously by the retailing sector. We show that the origin-based tax regime has several advantages {{with respect to the}} destination tax regime. First, the welfare-maximizing tax rates are more similar under origin taxa-tion than under destination taxation. Second, these tax rates are becoming more similar with higher volumes of parallel trade under origin-based taxes whereas they are getting less similar under destination-based taxes. Third, welfare in both countries is generally higher under an origin-based tax regime than under a destination-based regime. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} authors have argued, quite convincingly, {{that the current}} country of origin rules are antiquated and should be change (Lloyd, 1993; Falvey and Reed, 1998; Ho, 1998). The main {{argument}} is that a single country of origin does not fit the reality of global production in the modern world. The logical conclusion is therefore the replacement of a single country of origin (SCO) rule by a multiple country of origin (MCO) description. Whereas a SCO rule is unavoidably arbitrary because of the global nature of production, a MCO description is only a factual, objective statement about the country of origin of the values added {{in proportion to the}} contributions by various countries (Ho, 1998; Lloyd, 1993).

40|$|The first Chapter, {{focuses on}} a {{particular}} (and very popular) form of indirect tax harmonization, when the (good) market is imperfectly competitive (and homogenous). It discusses the implication of tax harmonization for welfare when the governments raise revenues to provide global public goods. It shows that, under certain indirect tax harmonization will generate potential Pareto improvements. And, interestingly, this is true independently of the tax principle in place (destination or origin). Chapter two analyzes a simple model of imperfect commodity tax competition in a federal system where fiscal externalities arise not only horizontally across the `states' but also vertically between levels of government. Commodity taxation can take place either under the destination or origin principle and taxes can be either specific or ad valorem. Within such framework the interplay between the vertical tax externalities, that arise due to the commonality of the tax base, and the horizontal tax externalities associated with inter-state trade is explored. It is shown that independently of the tax principle {{and the type of}} tax levied, state taxation is too low (high), from an equilibrium point of view, if and only if consumers place a high (low) valuation on the state public expenditure relative to the federal. Chapter three focuses on capital taxation in a federal system too, extending, in particular, the model of Keen and Kotsogiannis (2002) to ad valorem taxation. It shows that, although under ad valorem taxation the fiscal externalities can be of any sign, the welfare implications of lower-level government ad-valorem taxation critically depends (as in Chapter two) on the deviation of the marginal valuation of federal public expenditure from the marginal valuation of lower-level government public expenditure. Chapter four returns to tax harmonization but it does so within an environment in which there is product differentiation. The analysis focuses on the welfare implication of a specific tax harmonization rule under both the destination and <b>origin</b> <b>regimes</b> but under different settings of international duopoly (Cournot and Bertrand). Chapter five re-examines the Keen and Lighart (2005) proposition by allowing governments to provide, with the tax revenues collected, a public good. It is shown that, in contrast to the Keen and Lighart (2005) results, in the presence of public goods the desirability of tariff and tax reforms is ambiguous. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper maps out Rules of Origin (RoO) in {{regional}} trade agreements (RTAs) around the world, and observes that the restrictiveness {{and complexity of}} RoO are driven by factors specific to each RTA, including economy size and level of development. Given the powerful political economy forces that generate and determine the <b>origin</b> <b>regime,</b> harmonization, insofar as this means requiring identical rules for unconnected RTAs, is not practical and could be counterproductive. However, one can imagine rules that, if agreed at the multilateral level, could help limit the distortions caused by the RoO of the everincreasing number of RTAs. This would be a process of 'multilateralising' preferential RoO. Furthermore, there are mechanisms that could allow regions with particularly dense networks of overlapping RTAs (for example the Americas and, increasingly, Asia) to replace the spaghetti bowl with something more like a plate of lasagne. This would be a process of 'convergence' of RoO. Finally, these two approaches {{can and should be}} mutually reinforcing: convergence regimes should be established within the framework and limitations of multilateral rules, whereas the multilateral rules should be established in a way that promotes and facilitates the negotiation of such regimes...|$|E

40|$|This study surveys {{preferential}} {{rules of}} origin applied by 192 regional trade agreements (RTAs) covering trade in goods notified to the GATT/WTO up to 1 November 2010. It {{takes into account the}} preferential {{rules of origin}} that were notified to the WTO; whenever known and available, modifications to the original rules of origin have been updated. This study contains two basic features: a description of some key elements of preferential rules of origin in RTAs, followed by an attempt to provide a reality-check of how these rules affect actual trade. That is done by an ex-post examination of data on the use of RTAs' preferences and, in their absence, of their margins of preference (MOPs). While the raison d' of preferential rules of origin is the avoidance of trade deflection, the practice in RTAs has diluted this objective and it would seem that preferential rules of origin are increasingly becoming an economic, political and trade instrument. In its descriptive part, the study identifies {{what seems to be a}} tendency to design stricter rules of origin, while detecting concomitantly the inclusion in modern preferential rules of origin of flexibilities that provide, through the rules of origin themselves, a preference beyond the lower tariff rate resulting from the preferential treatment and mechanisms that allow the integration of third-parties into preferential rules of <b>origin</b> <b>regimes.</b> The reality-check part of the study points to the fact that much beyond the coverage of RTAs, it is their effective implementation that poses a challenge to economic operators. Though data on the use of preferences is either not disclosed or inexistent, they are nevertheless available for some economies. On the basis of existing data of preference utilization, the analysis of the effects of rules of origin on preferential trade flows appears to give rise to a dual reality - namely a relatively high use of preferences in certain instances coexisting with preferences failing to attain their potential in other cases. As regards RTAs for which utilization rate is not available, the paper analysis preferential rules of origin from a MOPS perspective, assuming that MOPs of at least 5 percentage points would offset compliance costs and thus provide a stimulus to comply with rules of origin in order to benefit from preferences. The analysis, made for 68 out of 192 RTAs, do not allow any conclusion regarding that generally presented hypothesis. Finally, the paper briefly outlines some suggestions for further action, including the launching in the WTO of exploratory work on preferential rules of origin within an open regionalism scenario...|$|R
