40|$|Module is {{effective}} <b>representation</b> <b>of</b> ring in Abelian group. Linear map of module over commutative ring is morphism <b>of</b> corresponding <b>representation.</b> This definition {{is the main}} subject of the book. To consider this definition from more general point of view I started the book from consideration of Cartesian product <b>of</b> <b>representations.</b> Polymorphism <b>of</b> <b>representations</b> is a map of Cartesian product <b>of</b> <b>representations</b> which is a morphism <b>of</b> <b>representations</b> with respect to each separate independent variable. Reduced morphism <b>of</b> <b>representations</b> allows us to simplify the study <b>of</b> morphisms <b>of</b> <b>representations.</b> However a representation has to satisfy specific requirements for existence of reduced polymomorphism <b>of</b> <b>representations.</b> It is possible that Abelian group is only Ω-algebra, such that representation in this algebra admits polymorphism <b>of</b> <b>representations.</b> However, today, this statement has not been proved. Multiplicative Ω-group is Ω-algebra in which product is defined. The definition of tensor product <b>of</b> <b>representations</b> <b>of</b> Abelian multiplicative Ω-group is based on properties of reduced polymorphism <b>of</b> <b>representations</b> <b>of</b> Abelian multiplicative Ω-group. Since an algebra is a module in which the product is defined, then we can use this theory to study linear map of algebra. For instance, we can study the set of linear transformations of D-algebra A as <b>representation</b> <b>of</b> algebra A⊗ A in algebra A.

40|$|Families <b>of</b> <b>representations</b> <b>of</b> {{suitable}} Banach algebras {{provide a}} powerful tool {{in the study of}} the spectral theory of (pseudo) differential operators and of their Fredholmness. We introduce the new concept of an exhausting family <b>of</b> <b>representations</b> <b>of</b> a C*-algebra A. An exhausting family <b>of</b> <b>representations</b> <b>of</b> a C*-algebra A is a set F <b>of</b> <b>representations</b> <b>of</b> A with the property that every irreducible <b>representation</b> <b>of</b> A is weakly contained in some ϕ∈ F. An exhausting family F <b>of</b> <b>representations</b> <b>of</b> A has the property that `"a ∈ A is invertible if, and if, ϕ(a) is invertible for any ϕ∈ F. " Consequently, the spectrum of a is given by (a) = ∪_ϕ∈ F(ϕ(a)). In other words, every exhausting family <b>of</b> <b>representations</b> is invertibility sufficient, a concept introduced by Roch in 2003. We prove several properties of exhausting families and we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a family <b>of</b> <b>representations</b> to be exhausting. Using results of Ionescu and Williams (2009), we show that the regular <b>representations</b> <b>of</b> amenable, second countable, locally compact groupoids with a Haar system form an exhausting family <b>of</b> <b>representations.</b> If A is a separable C*-algebra, we show that a family F <b>of</b> <b>representations</b> <b>of</b> A is exhausting if, and only if, it is invertibility sufficient. However, this result is not true, in general, for non-separable C*-algebras. With an eye towards applications, we extend our results to the case of unbounded operators. A typical application of our results is to parametric families of differential operators arising in the analysis on manifolds with corners, in which case we recover the fact that a parametric operator F is invertible if, and only if, its Mellin transform is invertible. In view of possible applications, we have tried to make this paper accessible to non-specialists in C*-algebras. Comment: Additional reference...|$|R

5|$|Since the House of Commons {{regularly}} rejected direct {{challenges to}} the system <b>of</b> <b>representation</b> by large majorities, supporters of reform had to content themselves with more modest measures. The Whig Lord John Russell brought forward one such measure in 1820, proposing the disfranchisement of the notoriously corrupt borough of Grampound in Cornwall. He suggested that the borough's two seats {{be transferred to the}} city of Leeds. Tories in the House of Lords agreed to the disfranchisement of the borough, but refused to accept the precedent of directly transferring its seats to an industrial city. Instead, they modified the proposal so that two further seats were given to Yorkshire, the county in which Leeds is situated. In this form, the bill passed both houses and became law. In 1828, Lord John Russell suggested that Parliament repeat the idea by abolishing the corrupt boroughs of Penryn and East Retford, and by transferring their seats to Manchester and Birmingham. This time, however, the House of Lords rejected his proposals. In 1830, Russell proposed another, similar scheme: the enfranchisement of Leeds, Manchester, and Birmingham, and the disfranchisement of the next three boroughs found guilty of corruption; again, the proposal was rejected.|$|E

According to the Constitution of India, at the state-level, the governor is de jure head, but de facto executive authority rests with the chief minister. Following elections to the state legislative assembly, the governor usually invites the party (or coalition) with a majority of seats to form the government. The governor appoints the chief minister, whose council of ministers are collectively responsible to the assembly. Given he/she has the assembly's confidence, the chief minister's term is usually for a maximum of five years; there are no limits to the number of terms he/she can serve.|$|E

It was implied, furthermore, that the Peerage Act of 1963 did not violate the requirement of Scottish representation, set out in the Article XXII of the Treaty of Union, by allowing all Scottish peers to sit in the House of Lords: as long as a minimum of sixteen seats were reserved for Scotland, the principles of the Article would be upheld. It was further argued that the only way to rescind the requirement of Article XXII would be to dissolve the Union between England and Scotland, which the House of Lords Bill did not seek to do.|$|E
