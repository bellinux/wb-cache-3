25|$|The {{science of}} negative-index {{materials}} is being matched with conventional devices that broadcast, transmit, shape, or receive electromagnetic signals that travel over cables, wires, or air. The materials, devices and {{systems that are}} involved with this work could have their properties altered <b>or</b> <b>heightened.</b> Hence, this is already happening with metamaterial antennas and related devices which are commercially available. Moreover, in the wireless domain these metamaterial apparatuses continue to be researched. Other applications are also being researched. These are electromagnetic absorbers such as radar-microwave absorbers, electrically small resonators, waveguides that can go beyond the diffraction limit, phase compensators, advancements in focusing devices (e.g. microwave lens), and improved electrically small antennas.|$|E

2500|$|Writing for The New Yorker, Richard Brody {{called the}} film [...] "Godardian", {{comparing}} it to Pierrot le Fou (1965), Every Man for Himself (1980), Alphaville (1965), and Germany Year 90 Nine Zero (1991), four classic films by French director Jean-Luc Godard. However, he suggested the film fell short of reaching the same cinematic mastery, adding, [...] "it's {{not a good idea}} for a filmmaker to get in the ring with Mr. Godard". Thematically, he also compared it to Opening Night (1977) by John Cassavetes. Brody said that the actors played in [...] "the sort of modern naturalism, without eccentricity of gesture, excess of expression, <b>or</b> <b>heightened</b> and formalistic precision, that is the business-casual of contemporary cinema." [...] In his critical comments on the film, he concluded that the film [...] "trade on facile, casual dichotomies of theatre versus cinema and art versus commerce" [...] and [...] "deliver a work of utterly familiar and unoriginal drama".|$|E

Against that, the resulting divisions in Hong Kong society will leave a void for Beijing to strengthen its role and influence. The journal also agreed that Hong Kong's institutions had been damaged through government actions as well as inaction. Citing the government and police choice to employ civil injunctions to justify clearing the protest sites, it said [...] "In so doing, the government has called the court system into service as a political tool. This politicisation of the court system is known as 'rule by law', a phrase frequently applied to the PRC and which could now {{be used for the}} first time with some justification in the context of Hong Kong." [...] It further predicts further erosion of press and academic freedoms, as universities have been shown to be seed beds of political activism and potential subversion.|$|E
60|$|The spice {{of life is}} battle; the friendliest {{relations}} are still a kind of contest; and if we would not forego all that is valuable in our lot, we must continually face some other person, eye to eye, and wrestle a fall whether in love or enmity. It is still by force of body, or power of character or intellect, that we attain to worthy pleasures. Men and women contend for {{each other in the}} lists of love, like rival mesmerists; the active and adroit decide their challenges in the sports of the body; and the sedentary sit down to chess or conversation. All sluggish and pacific pleasures are, to the same degree, solitary and selfish; and every durable bond between human beings is founded in <b>or</b> <b>heightened</b> by some element of competition. Now, the relation that has the least root in matter is undoubtedly that airy one of friendship; and hence, I suppose, it is that good talk most commonly arises among friends. Talk is, indeed, both the scene and instrument of friendship. It is in talk alone that the friends can measure strength, and enjoy that amicable counter-assertion of personality which is the gauge of relations and the sport of life.|$|E
