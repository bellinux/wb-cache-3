40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 22 - 25, 1984 / Riviera Hotel, Las Vegas, NevadaEGLIN AFB, Armament Division, had {{initiated}} {{an ongoing}} update efforts {{to replace the}} obsolete video recorders and associated digitizing capability used to record radar signature data. The prime objective of this program was realized and has demostrated the feasibility of HIGH DENSITY DIGITAL RECORDING, {{as a means of}} radar video recording and has developed the interface design criteria for all radar sites at EGLIN AFB. The HIGH DENSITY DIGITAL RECORDER/REPRODUCER system had been adapted for radar use with a micro-processor driven radar interface unit that includes the following: A/D and D/A Converters, Input and <b>Output</b> <b>formatter,</b> Memories, Filtering Networks and Error Detection and Correction (EDAC), Auxiliary data mux and demux. The System has four modes of operation with a digitizing rate of 30 Mega-samples and a selectable 6, 7 or 8 bit resolution. The four modes are: Single radar channel, Dual radar channel, PRI sequence and Snapshot memory...|$|E

50|$|MoinMoin, {{created in}} Python by JÃ¼rgen Hermann and Thomas Waldmann in mid-2000, was {{initially}} based on PikiPiki. It is a flat-file wiki {{with a simple}} code base but many possible extensions. MoinMoin uses the idea of separating the parsers (for parsing the wiki syntax) from the <b>formatters</b> (for <b>outputting</b> HTML code), with an interface between them, so that new parsers and <b>output</b> <b>formatters</b> can be written.|$|R
40|$|A {{prototype}} controller for the ESTAR (electronically scanned thinned array radiometer) instrument {{has been}} designed and tested. It manages {{the operation of the}} digital data subsystem (DDS) and its communication with the Small Explorer data system (SEDS). Among the data processing tasks that it coordinates are FEM data acquisition, noise removal, phase alignment and correlation. Its control functions include instrument calibration and testing of two critical subsystems, the <b>output</b> data <b>formatter</b> and Walsh function generator. It is implemented in a Xilinx XC 3064 PC 84 - 100 field programmable gate array (FPGA) and has a maximum clocking frequency of 10 MHz...|$|R
40|$|A {{prototype}} <b>Output</b> Data <b>Formatter</b> (ODF) for the ESTAR (Electronically Scanned Thinned Array Radiometer) instrument {{has been}} designed and tested. It employs programmable logic devices to format and tag correlator data for transmission to Earth. After accepting 170 bits or correlator and error data in parallel, it appends an identification word and then serially passes the data to the Small Explorer Data System (SEDS) for transmission at a maximum rate of greater than 15 Mb/sec. Implemented with two reprogrammable field programmable gate arrays (FPGA's), each contained in a 132 -pin plastic pin grid array (PGA) package, the design is cascadeable, fully testable, and low-power...|$|R
40|$|TEX is {{our latest}} text formatter. It is {{designed}} specifically for technical text (e. g., mathematics), and produces much higher quality <b>output</b> than other <b>formatters</b> previously available. Donald Knuth designed TEX at Stanford and published a manual TEX and METAFONT New Directions in Typesetting with "Everything {{you need to know}} about TEX. " The original people who used TEX here set up their own macro files but now Daniel Brotsky has developed a standardized macro package which does the types of formatting usually desired. This macro package will be referred to as TBase in this document. The aim of this memo is to help you create your first TEXT file, explain the basic commands for formatting (showing some examples) and clarify possible areas of confusion, giving pointers to the more technical documentation available for the advanced user. It is advisable for someone planning to use TEX to get copes of: INFO;TBASE INFO, NTEXLB;TBASE ORDER, NTEXLB;SAMPLE PRESS, NTEXLB:SAMPLE TEX and a copy of Knuth's manual. This document tries not to duplicate information already explained in the materials just mentioned - only to clarify some areas and set the information forth in an easily digestable manner.

40|$|The CMS {{experiment}} is currently undergoing the upgrade of its trigger, including the Level- 1 muon trigger. In the barrel-endcap transition region the Overlap Muon Track Finder (OMTF) combines data from {{three types of}} detectors (RPC, DT, and CSC) to find the muon candidates. To monitor {{the operation of the}} OMTF, it is important to receive the data which were the basis for the trigger decision. This task must be performed by the Data Acquisition (OMTF DAQ) system. The new MTCA technology applied in the updated trigger allows implementation of the OMTF DAQ together with the OMTF trigger in the MTF 7 board. Further concentration of data is performed by standard AMC 13 boards. The proposed data concentration methodology assumes parallel filtering and queuing of data arriving from all input links (24 RPC, 30 CSC, and 6 DT). The data are waiting for the trigger decision in the input buffers. The triggered data are then converted into the intermediate 72 -bit format and put into the sorter queues. The block responsible for the building of events receives data originating from the particular Bunch Crossing (BX) from the consecutive sorter queues, converts them to the 64 -bit AMC payload words, and puts them into the output queue. That block also generates the AMC header at the beginning and the AMC trailer {{at the end of the}} event data. The system is implemented in a flexible way, and handling of a new data source requires implementation of two specialized blocks the input data formatter to translate the link data into the sorter queue data and the <b>output</b> data <b>formatter</b> to translate the sorter queue data into the AMC payload. The AMC payload format used by the OMTF DAQ provides bit field allowing the context-free detection of the data source. The system may send data not only from the bunch crossing (BX) in which the L 1 trigger was generated but also from a configurable number of BXs before the trigger (up to 3) and after the triger (up to 4). Therefore, according to the current trigger rules, it is possible that the data from a certain BX may belong to two different events. To handle such cases the OMTF DAQ system uses two output queues alternately for assembling the consecutive events. It is easily possible to increase the number of output queues if a single BX may belong to a higher number of events due to the change of the trigger rules or number of BX-es transmitted before or after the trigger. The system in current state handles the RPC data. The data handlers for CSC and DT detectors are being developed. The presented methodology may be reused for other triggered DAQ systems concentrating data from various sources with different formats...|$|R
