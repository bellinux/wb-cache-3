5|$|From the mid-1940s {{through the}} 1960s, the Triangle was the {{commercial}} and cultural heart of Jerusalem, with many upscale shops and restaurants operated by German-Jewish immigrant businessmen that appealed to an affluent clientele. Following the reunification of Jerusalem in 1967 {{and the expansion of}} the city away from the downtown core, the commercial viability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Triangle</b> declined. The area was revitalized by the conversion of Ben Yehuda Street and the interior streets <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Triangle</b> to an open-air pedestrian mall in 1982. Over the next two decades, outdoor cafes and souvenir shops moved in, cementing the reputation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Triangle</b> as a popular shopping and entertainment venue for tourists and young Israelis.|$|E
5|$|In his 1874 paper, {{entitled}} Note sur les propriétés du centre des médianes antiparallèles dans un triangle, Lemoine {{proved the}} concurrency of the symmedians of a triangle; the {{reflections of the}} medians <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>triangle</b> over the angle bisectors. Other results in the paper included {{the idea that the}} symmedian from a vertex <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>triangle</b> divides the opposite side into segments whose ratio is equal to the ratio of the squares of the other two sides.|$|E
5|$|Lemoine {{also proved}} that if lines are drawn through the Lemoine point {{parallel}} to the sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>triangle,</b> then the six points of intersection of the lines and the sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>triangle</b> are concyclic, or that they lie on a circle. This circle {{is now known as}} the first Lemoine circle, or simply the Lemoine circle.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> medial <b>{{triangle}}</b> <b>of</b> a given triangle has vertices at <b>the</b> midpoints <b>of</b> <b>the</b> given <b>triangle's</b> sides. It {{shares the}} same centroid and medians with <b>the</b> given <b>triangle.</b> <b>The</b> perimeter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> medial <b>triangle</b> equals <b>the</b> semiperimeter (half <b>the</b> perimeter) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original <b>triangle,</b> and its area is one quarter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original <b>triangle.</b> <b>The</b> orthocenter (intersection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> altitudes) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> medial <b>triangle</b> coincides with <b>the</b> circumcenter (center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> circle through <b>the</b> vertices) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original <b>triangle.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{axillary}} {{region is}} region containing the axillary sclerites has {{in general the}} form of a scalene triangle. The base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>triangle</b> (a-b) is the hinge of the wing with the body; the apex (c) is the distal end of the third axillary sclerite; the longer side is anterior to the apex. The point d on the anterior side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>triangle</b> marks the articulation of the radial vein with the second axillary sclerite. The line between d and c is the plica basalis (bf), or fold of the wing {{at the base of the}} mediocubital field.|$|E
5|$|The present {{building}} is designed on a triangular plan. The large tower {{at the tip}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>triangle</b> is the medieval gatehouse, from which wings extend on either side. An isolated tower that now has the library on two floors divides the curtain wall on the east.|$|E
5|$|At {{any point}} during this rotation, {{two of the}} corners of the Reuleaux {{triangle}} touch two adjacent sides of the square, while the third corner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>triangle</b> traces out a curve near the opposite vertex of the square. The shape traced out by the rotating Reuleaux triangle covers approximately 98.77% of the area of the square.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{midpoint}} polygon <b>of</b> a <b>triangle</b> {{is called}} <b>the</b> medial <b>triangle.</b> It shares <b>the</b> same centroid and medians with <b>the</b> original <b>triangle.</b> <b>The</b> perimeter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> medial <b>triangle</b> equals <b>the</b> semiperimeter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original <b>triangle,</b> and <b>the</b> area is one quarter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original <b>triangle.</b> This can be proven by <b>the</b> midpoint theorem <b>of</b> <b>triangles</b> and Heron's formula. <b>The</b> orthocenter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> medial <b>triangle</b> coincides with <b>the</b> circumcenter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original <b>triangle.</b>|$|R

5|$|Lemoine {{was born}} in Quimper, Finistère, on 22 November 1840, {{the son of a}} retired {{military}} captain who had participated in the campaigns of the First French Empire occurring after 1807. As a child, he attended the military Prytanée of La Flèche on a scholarship granted because his father had helped found the school. During this early period, he published a journal article in Nouvelles annales de mathématiques, discussing properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>triangle.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lemoine's work defined many of {{the noted}} traits of this movement. His Géométrographie and {{relation}} of equations to tetrahedrons and triangles, {{as well as his}} study of concurrencies and concyclities, contributed to the modern triangle geometry of the time. The definition of points <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>triangle</b> such as the Lemoine point was also a staple of the geometry, and other modern triangle geometers such as Brocard and Gaston Tarry wrote about similar points.|$|E
5|$|Particularly {{within the}} Labour Party there was {{disagreement}} {{about whether or}} not to build the Hardanger Bridge. In addition to crossing the Hardangerfjord, there were concerns that the bridge would increase the traffic through Hardangervidda National Park, and that it subsequently would result in an all-year road being built with subsequent negative impact on nature and wildlife. Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland of the Labour Party stated on 10 October 1995 that the government was in favor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Triangle</b> Link and opposed to the Hardanger Bridge.|$|E

5|$|The {{first step}} is to mark two {{arbitrary}} points of the plane (which will eventually become vertices <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>triangle),</b> and use the compass to draw a circle centered at one of the marked points, through the other marked point. Next, one draws a second circle, of the same radius, centered at the other marked point and passing through the first marked point.|$|E
5|$|The white stars Beta and Gamma Trianguli, of {{apparent}} magnitudes 3.00 and 4.00, respectively, form the base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>triangle</b> and the yellow-white Alpha Trianguli, of magnitude 3.41, the apex. Iota Trianguli is a notable double star system, {{and there are}} three star systems with known planets located in Triangulum. The constellation contains several galaxies, the brightest and nearest {{of which is the}} Triangulum Galaxy or Messier 33—a member of the Local Group. The first quasar ever observed, 3C 48, also lies within Triangulum's boundaries.|$|E
5|$|During late 1989, advance tolls on the ferries were {{approved}} by the municipal councils and the county council, who recommended that collection start from 1 July 1990, {{but this was not}} immediately supported by the government. On 18 and 19 September 1990, the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications visited the region and looked at the proposed areas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Triangle</b> Link, the Hardanger Bridge and the Folgefonna Tunnel. By then it had been established that the Triangle Link would not need state grants, as it could be entirely financed with tolls. Tore Haugen, Conservative parliamentarian from Akershus, proposed that the project be considered independent of the regular national road plans. However, Lars Gunnar Lie, Minister of Transport and Communications from the Christian Democratic Party, stated that he planned a single report to Parliament for all three projects.|$|E

25|$|From an {{interior}} {{point in a}} reference <b>triangle,</b> <b>the</b> nearest points on the three sides serve as <b>the</b> vertices <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pedal <b>triangle</b> <b>of</b> that point. If the interior point is <b>the</b> circumcenter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reference <b>triangle,</b> <b>the</b> vertices <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pedal <b>triangle</b> are <b>the</b> midpoints <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reference <b>triangle's</b> sides, and so <b>the</b> pedal <b>triangle</b> is called <b>the</b> midpoint <b>triangle</b> or medial <b>triangle.</b> <b>The</b> midpoint <b>triangle</b> subdivides <b>the</b> reference <b>triangle</b> into four congruent triangles which are similar to <b>the</b> reference <b>triangle.</b>|$|R
50|$|The tangent lines {{containing}} <b>the</b> sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tangential <b>triangle</b> {{are called}} <b>the</b> exsymmedians <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reference <b>triangle.</b> Any {{two of these}} are concurrent with <b>the</b> third symmedian <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reference <b>triangle.</b>|$|R
5|$|From 1988, environmentalists started {{actively}} {{opposing the}} Triangle Link. The most active were the {{local chapter of}} the Norwegian Society for the Conservation of Nature and Nature and Youth, who stated that the road would have serious consequences for the local boat traffic to the recreational islands of Føyno and Nautøy. Instead, they recommended that the municipalities chose a pontoon bridge. Another opponent to the project was the Action Committee Against a Hasty Construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Triangle</b> Link, who argued to delay the decision until after the 1991 municipal elections, to ensure that the municipal councils had backing in the public. Gisle Tjong stated that the risk in the project was large and that it was uncertain how long the tolls would last: they could just as well be 60 as 15 years. He instead wanted to collect tolls in advance.|$|E
5|$|The Western Front at {{this time}} {{generally}} followed the River Rhine with two important exceptions: the American bridgehead over the Rhine at Remagen, and a large German salient west of the Rhine, the Saar–Palatinate triangle. Consideration was given to evacuating the triangle, but OKW ordered it held. When Kesselring paid {{his first visit to}} the German First and Seventh Army headquarters there on 13 March 1945, the army group commander, Oberst-gruppenführer Paul Hausser, and the two army commanders all affirmed the defence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>triangle</b> could only result in heavy losses or complete annihilation of their commands. General der Infanterie Hans Felber of the Seventh Army considered the latter the most likely outcome. Nonetheless, Kesselring insisted that the positions had to be held.|$|E
5|$|Another {{opponent}} to {{the project}} was the Action Committee Against a Hasty Construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Triangle</b> Link, who wanted to delay the decision until after the 1991 municipal elections {{to ensure that the}} municipal councils had backing in the public. Gisle Tjong was another opponent, who stated that the risk in the project was large and that it was uncertain how long the tolls would last: they could just as well last 60 as 15 years. Instead, he wanted to use advanced tolls and fuel fees, place the income in the bank and then pay the whole fixed link with the accumulated funds. Most of the opposition against the project was from Stord, while in Bømlo there was overwhelming support. However, in southern Bømlo there were concerns that they would lose their ferry, as they would have a much longer rout to Haugesund via the Triangle Link. Some also stated that it was necessary to keep a ferry for people with fear of tunnels.|$|E
50|$|Property 7 follows {{immediately}} from property 6 {{since the}} homothetic center whose factor is -1 must lie at <b>the</b> midpoint <b>of</b> <b>the</b> circumcenters O <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reference <b>triangle</b> and H <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Johnson triangle; {{the latter is}} <b>the</b> orthocenter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reference <b>triangle,</b> and its nine-point center {{is known to be}} that midpoint. Since the central symmetry also maps <b>the</b> orthocenter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reference <b>triangle</b> to that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Johnson <b>triangle,</b> <b>the</b> homothetic center is also <b>the</b> nine-point center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Johnson <b>triangle.</b>|$|R

5|$|Bømlo Municipal Council voted {{unanimously}} in favor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Triangle</b> Link on 22 February 1988. Two days later, {{the issue was}} discussed in Stord Municipal Council. Olav Akselsen at first proposed supporting the pontoon bridge, but after a trial vote he withdrew the proposal and also Stord supported the Triangle Link. The following week, Sveio Municipal Council voted in favor the Triangle Link, without either a debate or dissent in the council. Fitjar Municipal Council voted on 15 March to work with both proposals. Hordaland Public Roads Administration still supported a pontoon bridge, and stated that {{two and a half}} years of work on a master plan had been wasted. A new master plan for the Triangle Link was published in early 1989, estimating the costs at NOK890 million. It recommended that the Langevåg–Buavåg Ferry remain, but the other four ferry services be terminated. The report concluded that the maintenance costs of the fixed link would be lower than the subsidies of the ferry, that the project would be economical of society and would reduce emissions.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, a new roadway was opened, {{completing}} the third {{side of a}} triangle between the junction with M-113, Walton Corners and Fife Lake. US131 was shifted to the new highway and the former routing along the other two sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>triangle</b> became part of M-113 and M-186. A second realignment opened the following year between Fife Lake and Kalkaska. US131 no longer turned east along Boardman Road between South Boardman and Lodi. Instead the MSHD rerouted the highway directly to the northeast, {{from the end of}} the previous new routing north of Fife Lake to Kalaska. By 1945, a Bypass US131 was created around the south and east sides of Grand Rapids, following 28th Street and East Beltline Avenue, while the main highway continued to run through downtown unchanged. A decade later, mainline US131 was rerouted around Grand Rapids over the former bypass route, and Business US131 (Bus. US131) was created for the former route through downtown. A second business loop was created in Three Rivers, Michigan, after an expressway bypass of the city's downtown was opened in early 1954. Another expressway section was opened between Mancelona and the M-32 junction west of Elmira in late 1956.|$|E
5|$|The {{issue of}} {{advanced}} tolls was {{reviewed by the}} county council on 23 October 1991, where 64 voted in favor and 19 were opposed, the latter representing the Socialist Left Party, the Red Electoral Alliance and the Progress Party. In June 1992, the county council was asked to prioritize between the Hardanger Bridge and the Triangle Link, as {{there would not be}} sufficient state grants to build both projects. Both would require between NOK200 and 300 million, and it would not be possible to start both projects in the period from 1994 to 1997. In the council meeting on 18 June 1992, a proposal to waiver prioritization was rejected. The council then, with 44 against 30 votes, chose to prioritize the Hardanger Bridge, which received most votes from the Labour and Centre Party. The Conservative Party was the only party for which all the votes were cast in favor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Triangle</b> Link. The Socialist Left Party's proposal to build neither received 11 votes.|$|E
