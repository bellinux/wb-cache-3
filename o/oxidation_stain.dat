40|$|During the 19 th century, {{the most}} {{prominent}} buildings {{of the city of}} Belém were faced entirely with tiles manufactured in Portugal and Germany, which now exhibit distinct degrees of degradation. The Pinho mansion {{is one of the most}} important of these buildings and was selected for the investigation of the action of the tropical Amazonian climate on the degradation of the tiles. To achieve this objective, the tiles were mapped for organic and inorganic degradation, and samples were collected for analysis. The minerals were determined by XRD, the chemical composition by classical wet methods and SEM/EDS, and the microorganisms under the microscope. The results show that the German and Portuguese tiles are quite different in their composition. While both ceramic bodies are composed of SiO 2 and Al 2 O 3, CaO was found only in the Portuguese tile. The low Na 2 O and K 2 O contents indicate the addition of materials to reduce the fusion temperature. SiO 2 and PbO are the main constituents of the glaze, with CoO and FeO being added as pigment. The ceramic body of the German tiles is constituted of quartz, mullite, and cristobalite, in contrast with the Portuguese tiles, which are made of quartz, gehlenite, diopside, calcite, and feldspars. The glazes are XRD-amorphous. The chemical and mineralogical differences between the German and Portuguese tiles indicate that they were produced from different raw materials under distinct thermal processes. The most prominent weathering-related modifications are the thin layers (German tiles), <b>oxidation</b> <b>stains,</b> dark stains, the detachment of the tile (Portuguese tiles), loss of the glaze and powdering of the ceramic body (Portuguese tiles) through the establishment of Cyanophyta and Bacillariophyta [...] The distinct degradation patterns of the tiles exposed to the tropical Amazon climate are a consequence of their distinct mineralogy and chemistry...|$|R

40|$|Chromium {{passivation}} treatment on tinplate {{is important in}} stabilising the active tin surface in terms of <b>oxidation</b> resistance, sulphide <b>stain</b> resistance and ensuring good lacquer adhesion properties. Through this research, the reason was explored why dip {{passivation treatment}}, in sodium dichromate, provides superior lacquer adhesion properties on tinplate compared to electrolytic sodium dichromate (CDC) treatments. A critical assessment of the current knowledge of chromium passivation treatments on tinplate {{formed the basis of}} the experimental work. Through electrochemical and surface analytical techniques (X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy and Auger Electron Spectroscopy) both dip and CDC treated tinplate surfaces were characterised in terms of surface species. It was shown through XPS, using angle resolved techniques, that no metallic chromium forms on the tinplate surface during CDC treatments. Furthermore, a difference in chromium surface species was established for the dip and CDC processes showing additional SnO and Cr(OH) 3. nH 2 O species for the latter. Complementary to these findings, it was verified that the formation of additional chromium hydroxide species is a function of pH, governed by the applied cathodic current during the CDC process itself. The inferior adhesion properties of CDC treated tinplate were shown {{to be related to the}} difference in the respective surface species formed during dip and CDC applications.

40|$|Background: The {{establishment}} of an in vitro production (IVP) of embryo in swine allows the generation of embryos with the same quality as in vivo produced embryos with less costs and time. In order to achieve successful fertilization under normal circumstances in vivo, mammalian spermatozoa must first undergo capacitation and then acrosome reaction. The {{purpose of this study}} was compared the efficacious of IP/CFDA fluorescence and Coomassie Blue G (CB) staining to detect capacitated sperm cells in refrigerated and fresh semen. Morever, it was investigated the efficacious of caffeine and chondroitin sulphate to promote in vitro sperm capacitation and in vitro embryo produced (IVP) of swine embryos. Materials, Methods & Results: A sperm-rich fraction from ejaculate was obtained using the gloved-hand method and the gel-free fraction was separated using sterile gauze. The semen was diluted in BTS at a final concentration of 1. 5 x 10 (8) cells/mL. The sperm suspension was incubated for 2 h at 25 degrees C, refrigerated and maintained for 1 h at 15 - 18 degrees C (refrigerated group) or used immediately (fresh group). Sperm capacitation was assessed by IP/CFDA fluorescence and CB staining for both fresh and refrigerated semen. For PI/CFDA evaluation, a final solution containing 1. 7 mM formaldehyde, 7. 3 mM PI and 20 mM CFDA in 950 mu L saline was prepared. In the dark, 40 mu L PI/CFDA final solution was added to 10 mu L semen and after 8 min, slides were analyzed on epifluorescence microscopy. For CB evaluation, sperm cells were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde for 10 min and centrifuged twice at 320 x g in ammonium acetate pH 9 for 8 min. A smear was made and stained with 2. 75 mg/mL CB in solution containing 12. 5 % methanol, 25 % glacial acetic acid and 62. 5 % water, for 2 min. The smear was washed in running water, air dried and sealed with Permount (R), diluted 2 : 1 in xilol to avoid <b>staining</b> <b>oxidation.</b> Our results showed that refrigeration did not affect sperm capacitation and comparing staining methods, the PI/CFDA combination was more efficient to detect capacitated sperm, when compared to CB staining. In experiment 2, we evaluated the effect of different incubation time (1 - 5 h) with chondroitin sulfate and caffeine on sperm capacitation. For in vitro fertilization, oocytes were obtained from slaughterhouse ovaries. Oocytes with a thick and intact cumulus oophurus layer and cytoplasm with homogenous granules were selected for in vitro maturation for 44 h. According to the results of experiment 2, it was used for in vitro fertilization refrigerated semen was capacitated with 50 mu g/mL chondroitin sulfate for 2 h or capacitated with 5 mu g/mL caffeine for 3 h. Six hours after insemination, cumulus oophorus cells were mechanically removed and oocytes were washed and incubated in microdrops of culture medium. Embryo development after fertilization with sperm capacitated with caffeine or chondroitin sulfate was evaluated on days 3, 5 and 7 of culture. No differences were observed in days 3 or 5 of in vitro culture. However, it was observed an increase on blastocyst rate on Day 7 of culture when caffeine was used as the capacitor agent. Discussion: Molecular basis of sperm capacitation is still poor understood. Sperm capacitation can occur in vitro spontaneously in defined media without addition of biological fluids. We observed that sperm capacitation increased as incubation period enlarged and it was observed using Coomassie blue G and PI/CFDA for fresh semen and for refrigerated semen. It can be concluded that the cooling of semen did not change their pattern of sperm capacitation and this is best assessed by IP/CFDA than by CB. In addition to the use of caffeine in sperm capacitation produces more blastocysts than the chondroitin sulfate after in vitro fertilization...|$|R
40|$|This PhD, {{funded by}} a KU Leuven Research Fund (Onderzoeksfonds KU Leuven) START I project, {{comprises}} the soil micromorphological analysis of samples collected at the Minoan Bronze Age cemetery and settlement of Sissi on the north coast of Crete (Greece) in 2008 and 2009. The site excavated by the Sissi Archaeological Project (SArPedon), is located at an interesting junction of main natural crossroads linking the north(west) and east parts of the island {{and at the same}} time well within the periphery of the important Bronze Age settlement of Malia. It has a rich and diverse archaeological record which spans most of the Bronze Age (EM IIA - LM IIIB) and which seems to have survived reasonably well, mainly because the hill on which the site is located, has escaped the speedy development that engulfed the area in recent decades. Excavations conducted there between 2007 and 2011 yielded an abundance of material which is now in the process of being studied. The soil micromorphological analysis which comprises this PhD featured in the wider multidisciplinary research framework of the project started in 2008. When the addition of a soil micromorphology component to the project was initially proposed, it was largely based on the merits of the technique in inter- and multidisciplinary archaeological projects worldwide. Based on the potential of soil micromorphological analysis, a series of objectives was put forward with the emphasis mostly on its value for studying the social use of space. Although archaeological soil micromorphology is currently experiencing a modest boom on Crete, the project was among the first to proceed with a dedicated, larger-scale research program. Sampling started in 2008 and continued up to the last campaign of the first five-year archaeological field work permit in 2011. As it became clear that the preservation conditions were such that no occupation surfaces could be discerned, the emphasis shifted towards studying the ubiquitous fill contexts. In fact, soil micromorphology was employed at Sissi on archaeological contexts in order to help elucidate their depositional history. In particular, the objective was to define microstratigraphical units and to differentiate within the sometimes crude chronologies based on architectural phasing and established (mainly ceramological) typologies. In addition, soil micromorphology was expected to assist the assessment of pedogenetic processes affecting the archaeological record and, hence, the interpretations based thereupon. The second (and primary) objective involved the identification of discrete occupation surfaces, as earthen and clay layers were reported in different parts of the site. Closely intertwined with the latter objective but also heavily reliant on other disciplines, the soil micromorphological research also featured as a tool for the functional analysis of the sampled spaces at Sissi. Lastly, any micromorphologically visible information regarding the past environment would help to increase the datasets for the palaeobotanical and archaeozoological specialists involved in the project. The results of the soil micromorphological research on the Sissi samples are many. The different zones, covering the most part of the Cretan Bronze Age, provide some insight into the depositional history of the archaeological contexts. Most of them have undergone significant bioturbational reworking, with illuviation impacting the movement and redeposition of clay particles within the soil fabric. The illuviation is brought about by percolating rainwater which peaks during common torrential winter rains which are probably also responsible for the iron <b>staining</b> (<b>oxidation),</b> dissolution and transport/reworking of fine calcareous matter (e. g. micrite and calcitic ash) and the development of fungal bodies. While it is sometimes difficult to differentiate between heterogeneous, chaotic secondary dumps and thorough bioturbated sediments, bits of surviving microstratigraphy allow for at least some inferences regarding the depositional history of certain spaces. While not a main objective at the initial stages, the recognition of certain archaeologically meaningful but macroscopically missed phenomena, proved to be an added advantage of the soil micromorphology at Sissi. For instance the identification of (laminated) plaster at an Early Minoan Sissi house tomb enabled a link to contemporary and similar house tombs at the nearby site of Mochlos, where in situ plaster was attested. The (repeated) application of plaster to the Sissi house tombs provides a crucial bit of interpretational evidence regarding funeral practices. The analysis of the contexts at the Late Minoan I Building BA at the midway terrace provided interesting insights into the large-scale deposition of material in a subterranean space - reaffirming the field archaeological, ceramological and archaeozoological view that it was filled rapidly by a substantially sized, anthropogenic deposit. This deposit was recognised as a combination of debris clearance and domestic (dietary) refuse. Moreover, the soil micromorphological analysis identified volcanic glass particles embedded within the fill, which - given the identification of a concentration of volcanic ash in the adjacent space and the LM IA-B date of the building - makes for a tentative connection to the period in the aftermath of the Minoan eruption of Thera/Santorini. The extensive complex (Buildings CD and E) on the hilltop yielded the only results with preserved bits of microstratigraphy with a prominent hearth in Building CD context consisting of 15 discernible layers related to the short-term use/inactivity of the hearth. Moreover, a tentative, turbated precursor may have been identified within the thin section suggesting the hearth may have been a formalised structure. In Building E, a destruction by fire could be confirmed through an in situ baked surface. However, the morphogenetic properties to which this surface belonged, as well as additional micromorphologically identified evidence, suggests the space may have been derelict or abandoned prior to its destruction. The absence of (microscopic) charcoal in this respect may be indicative of efficient (and intentional) combustion although the macroscopic evidence seems to dispel that. In several cases (six out of nine sampled spaces at the hilltop), the macroscopically identified "destruction layers" appeared to be secondary in nature and consisted rather of cleared and redeposited destruction (or, arguably, posterior collapse) material, possibly related to a post-destruction reoccupation of (part of) the hilltop. The findings in this study highlight the added value soil micromorphology can bring to archaeology and more particularly the study of Aegean Bronze Age contexts, even when dealing with significantly reworked soils or in the absence of macroscopically observable sequences. Clues about the degradation of the structure and the post-depositional processes and conditions will help interpret the record. Moreover, important archaeological details that were missed during field work, can be intercepted during the micromorphological analysis. Finally, the samples provide a permanent (but selected) record of the soil at the time of excavation. It ought to be noted that despite the limitations and the expenses required for thin section production and analysis, the results in this study have been promising and further micromorphological analysis in Cretan Bronze Age contexts could certainly enrich the understanding of similar phenomena which cannot be detected macroscopically. However, a better and more equitable integration of soil micromorphology and other disciplines into the archaeological practice would undoubtedly yield far better results.
