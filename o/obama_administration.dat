40|$|<b>Obama's</b> <b>administration</b> {{approach}} towards People Republic of China (PRC) {{has changed}} {{during its first}} term from a very benevolent view to a tougher line. At first Obama used a concept, which had been established during the Bush administration - concept of viewing China as a "responsible stakeholder". This concept portrayed China as a country responsible towards international system. Later <b>Obama's</b> <b>administration</b> introduced a concept of "pivot to Asia", which deepened American engagement {{in the region and}} which should have posed a counterweight to Chinese growing influence in this area. The main purpose of this thesis is to describe and analyze foreign policy concepts of <b>Obama's</b> <b>administration</b> towards PRC as well as description and analysis of Chinese foreign political concepts (peaceful development and harmonious world). The next part of this paper focuses on analysis of two aspects of relations between these two countries: diplomatic relations and human rights issues, which both prove the assumption that Obama's approach towards PRC has changed during his first term in office...|$|R
