5|$|After the film's release, several {{blogs and}} users of social media {{websites}} Twitter, Facebook and YouTube accused {{the director of}} plagiarism. Media further alleged that Basu had not tried to credit the <b>original</b> <b>sources.</b> Several videos were uploaded to YouTube showing side-by-side comparisons with Hollywood films like Cops, The Adventurer, City Lights, Singin' in the Rain, Project A, The Notebook and Benny & Joon. They also accused Barfi!s music director Pritam of copying the background music from the French film Amélie.|$|E
5|$|Its {{academic}} program {{is based on}} a core curriculum of sixteen required courses in the humanities, social sciences and natural sciences. All courses are small seminars with no more than twelve students, and are based on <b>original</b> <b>sources</b> from a list of about 200 core texts broadly based on the Great Books canon. Classroom instruction is Socratic discussion. Considerable writing is required, including two comprehensive examinations and a senior thesis. Students are admitted primarily on the basis of essays and interviews; no minimum grades or test scores are required. Shimer {{has one of the highest}} alumni doctorate rates in the country.|$|E

50|$|The <b>original</b> <b>source</b> graphic or {{the result}} from a filter {{primitive}} {{can be used as}} input into one or more other filter primitives. A common application is to use the source graphic multiple times. For example, a simple filter could replace one graphic for two by adding a black copy of the <b>original</b> <b>source</b> graphic but offset to create a drop shadow. In effect, there are now two layers of graphics, both with the same <b>original</b> <b>source</b> graphics.|$|R
5|$|Olaf's {{father is}} {{identifiable}} as Gofraid, who was king of Dublin between 920 and 934, and also briefly ruled Northumbria in 927. Gofraid was a grandson of Ímar but no patronymic {{is given in}} the <b>original</b> <b>sources.</b> This may be {{because he was a}} child of a son of Ímar who never ruled Dublin, or he was a child of a daughter of Ímar, which in either case would mean his legitimacy to rule in the eyes of his contemporaries was dependent on the identity of his grandfather, not his parents. Ímar, possibly identical to Ivar the Boneless, was the founder of the Uí Ímair {{and was one of the}} earliest kings of Dublin in the mid-ninth century.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from a few}} {{inscriptions}} and fragments, texts {{written by}} people who actually knew Alexander or who gathered information from men who served with Alexander were all lost. Contemporaries who wrote accounts of his life included Alexander's campaign historian Callisthenes; Alexander's generals Ptolemy and Nearchus; Aristobulus, a junior officer on the campaigns; and Onesicritus, Alexander's chief helmsman. Their works are lost, but later works based on these <b>original</b> <b>sources</b> have survived. The earliest of these is Diodorus Siculus (1st century BC), followed by Quintus Curtius Rufus (mid-to-late 1st century AD), Arrian (1st to 2nd century AD), the biographer Plutarch (1st to 2nd century AD), and finally Justin, whose work dated {{as late as the}} 4th century. Of these, Arrian is generally considered the most reliable, given that he used Ptolemy and Aristobulus as his sources, closely followed by Diodorus.|$|E
5|$|Marwan's 737 {{expedition}} was {{the climax}} of the Arab–Khazar wars, but its actual results were meagre. Although the Arab campaigns after Ardabil may indeed have discouraged the Khazars from further warfare, any recognition of Islam or of Arab supremacy by the khagan was evidently conditional upon the presence of Arab troops deep in Khazar territory, and such presence could not be sustained for long. Furthermore, the credibility of the conversion of the khagan to Islam is disputed: al-Baladhuri's account, which probably reflects closer the <b>original</b> <b>sources,</b> suggests that it was not the khagan but a minor lord who converted to Islam and was placed in charge of the Khazars at al-Lakz. The conversion of the khagan is also apparently contradicted by the fact that c. 740 the Khazar court embraced Judaism as its official faith, a decision which clearly owed a great deal to the determination of the Khazars to avoid assimilation by and emphasize their independence from the Christian Byzantine and the Muslim Arab empires.|$|E

5|$|Renaissance is {{a concept}} {{formulated}} by cultural historian Jacob Burckhardt {{in the mid-nineteenth century}} to describe the intellectual and artistic movement that began in Italy in the fourteenth century and saw an attempt to revive the principles of the Greek and Roman classical worlds. It encompassed a rational and sceptical attitude, a return to ideas of <b>original</b> <b>sources</b> and proportion and balance in art. The major ideas of the Renaissance are generally considered to have reached Northern Europe much later, in the late fifteenth century. Scotland has been seen as part of a wider Northern Renaissance that is generally considered to have stretched into the early seventeenth century, when it was replaced by the grander styles of the Baroque. However, the association of Baroque styles with Catholicism in predominantly Protestant Scotland tended to result in this trend being overlooked and the period from about 1620 {{to the end of the}} seventeenth century is sometimes characterised as a late Renaissance.|$|E

40|$|Mutants {{which are}} {{generated}} in mutation testing {{have the same}} complexity as of the <b>original</b> <b>source</b> code. Thus if the space complexity of the <b>original</b> <b>source</b> code is large, then the cost of mutation testing will also increase due to generation of large number of mutants. In this research paper we have presented the approach to reduce the complexity of mutation testing using metadata versioning. Metadata versioning states that instead of creating a new mutant for the corresponding statement change, we can maintain a copy of <b>original</b> <b>source</b> code and change is incorporated in this copy of source code. Thus we don’t need to maintain all copies of mutants, we only need a copy of <b>original</b> <b>source</b> code and a version table that contains the information regarding which statement has to be changed in the copy of source code {{and what was the}} previous changed values in that copy. Thus for every mutant, we can change the statements in the copy of <b>original</b> <b>source</b> code and test this against the test cases. 1...|$|R

40|$|Plagiarism {{is using}} someone else’s work without giving {{credit to the}} <b>original</b> <b>source.</b> If you take a phrase or {{sentence}} or paragraph from another source and include it in your own work without citing the <b>original</b> <b>source,</b> then that’s plagiarism. If you take an idea from another source and include it in your own work without citing the <b>original</b> <b>source,</b> that’s also plagiarism. It doesn’t matter if the <b>original</b> <b>source</b> is a book, a journal article, a web site, or another student, you are still presenting someone else’s work as your own and therefore you are plagiarizing. Even if you rephrase a sentence, paragraph, or idea, it is still plagiarism if you don’t give credit to the <b>original</b> <b>source.</b> As the 6 th edition of the APA Publication Manual states, “each time you paraphrase another author (i. e., summarize a passage or rearrange the order of sentences and change some of the words), you need to credit the source ” (APA, 2010, p. 15). If you are unsure about whether something you have included in your own work is possibly plagiarized, ask yourself the following: Is this phrase/sentence/paragraph/idea original to me or did it originate in another source? If it came from another source – even if you’ve rephrased it – you need to cite the <b>original</b> <b>source</b> to avoid committing plagiarism.
