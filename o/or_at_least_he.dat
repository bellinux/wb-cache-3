500|$|Santa Barbara Independent {{journalist}} Brian Tanguay {{wrote in}} his book review that Taibbi was [...] "the spiritual heir of legendary presidential campaign scribes" [...] including Hunter S. Thompson and Timothy Crouse. Tanguay said of Taibbi's writing style, [...] "Taibbi is incisive and often incredibly funny as he recounts the foibles of candidates and the long, enervating presidential primary process." [...] He observed, [...] "A veteran of four presidential campaigns, Taibbi knows how the game works. <b>Or</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> knew until Trump came." [...] Tanguay's review concluded, [...] "Insane Clown President is a valuable work {{about one of the}} most bizarre electoral outcomes in American history." ...|$|E

2500|$|David Boies {{has agreed}} to {{represent}} SCO. I am trying to remind myself that our legal system is predicated on lawyers sometimes representing people they don't personally admire, and the system really does depend on someone being {{willing to take on}} unpopular clients. I know Boies doesn't use email, <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> didn't the last time I checked. So maybe he doesn't quite get the tech ... ah, hang it all, there's no way around it: I feel bad he's chosen to represent them, especially after I posted an Ode singing his praises, and I hope he loses.|$|E
50|$|The Apollinarists, {{denying that}} Christ had a human soul, <b>or,</b> <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> that <b>he</b> had a human intellect (nous), {{necessarily}} regarded him as devoid of knowledge.|$|R

2500|$|Patrons were few, {{and most}} had {{to compete with}} their peers to attract the best, most useful clients. Clients were many, and those of least {{interest}} to the patron had to scrabble for notice among the [...] "togate horde" [...] (turbae togatae). One in a dirty or patched toga would likely be subject to ridicule; or he might, if sufficiently dogged and persistent, secure a pittance of cash, or perhaps a dinner. When the patron left his house to conduct his business of {{the day at the}} law courts, forum or wherever else, escorted (if a magistrate) by his togate lictors, his clients must form his retinue. Each togate client represented a potential vote: to impress his peers and inferiors, and stay ahead in the game, a patron should have as many high-quality clients as possible; <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>he</b> should seem to. Martial has one patron hire a herd (grex) of fake clients in togas, then pawn his ring to pay for his evening meal.|$|E
2500|$|... "A Short Trip Home", Saturday Evening Post, January 17, 1927. [...] "Joe Jelke and {{two other}} boys were along, {{and none of the}} three could manage to take their eyes off her, even to say hello to me. She had one of those {{exquisite}} rose skins frequent in our part of the country, and beautiful until the little veins begin to break at about forty; now, flushed with the cold, it was a riot of lovely delicate pinks like many carnations. She and Joe had reached some sort of reconciliation, <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> was too far gone in love to remember last night; but I saw that though she laughed a lot she wasn't really paying any attention to him or any of them. She wanted them to go, so that there'd be a message from the kitchen, but I knew that the message wasn't comingâ€”that she was safe. There was talk of the Pump and Slipper dance at New Haven and of the Princeton Prom, and then, in various moods, we four left and separated quickly outside. I walked home with a certain depression of spirit and lay for an hour in a hot bath thinking that vacation was all over for me now that she was gone; feeling, even more deeply than I had yesterday, that she was out of my life." ...|$|E

5000|$|During the 1993 Knightfall storyline, one of Bane's henchmen {{remarks that}} the Bat-Signal is a [...] "stupid set-up", as it allows criminals {{to know where}} Batman is, <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> where <b>he</b> will be, and lets them keep track of his movements.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you know, Christie," [...] {{said her}} father, [...] "I {{sometimes}} fancy when I hear that new parson fellow {{talk about his}} artistic feelings, and so on, that he's just a trifle selfish, <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> self-centred. <b>He</b> always dwells so much on his own enjoyment of things, you know." ...|$|R
50|$|When Frenkel {{asked the}} patient what had {{happened}} in the interval, the patient replied, 'I wanted to pass the test and so I practiced.' This event inspired Frenkel to a general assumption: 'If one patient can reduce his ataxia by practice, why not all? <b>Or</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> others?' <b>He</b> immediately started to study the problem in a practical manner.|$|R

5000|$|In {{spite of}} its weaknesses, Abboud's {{government}} might have lasted longer {{if not for the}} [...] "southern problem." [...] Abboud was personally popular <b>or,</b> <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> respected. <b>He</b> was even invited to the White House in 1961, where President John F. Kennedy praised the Sudan for having set a good example for living in peace with its neighbors.|$|R
25|$|He {{appears as}} Archdeacon of Lothian in {{documents}} from 1386, an extremely prestigious position (<b>or</b> claim <b>at</b> <b>least)</b> <b>he</b> {{appears to have}} lost by 1390, when the position is securely held by another. Other honours held before the episcopate, excluding Mortlach, include the church of Liston (by November 1391), previously held by Gilbert de Greenlaw, {{and the office of}} sub-dean of Brechin.|$|R
60|$|It is the {{business}} of the truthful historian to narrate facts, not to palliate or extenuate the conduct of the various actors. Whether Ernest did right <b>or</b> wrong, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> did it; he wrote a playful social for Monday's 'Morning Intelligence,' and carried it into the office on Sunday afternoon himself, beause there was no postal delivery in the London district.|$|R

6000|$|... "No, {{he is an}} officer, naval officer, <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> was, now he {{trades and}} hunts. We are coming down from Natal. But what's your name?" ...|$|E

50|$|Hayden {{threatens to}} kill Jarold and enters inside to {{retrieve}} Carly and kill Nick and Hank. They use a ruse {{to lure the}} in-laws into a trap and arrest them. Hank is now happy that <b>he's</b> not crazy, <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> that <b>he</b> {{is not the only}} one, understanding Nick's life as a Grimm. Juliette is released from the hospital but Nick is heartbroken as she shows no feelings towards him.|$|R
60|$|By {{the word}} Hell I do not suppose, <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> not determine, that his residence, {{or that of}} the whole army of Devils, is yet in the same local HELL, to which the Divines tell us he shall be at last chain'd down; <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> that <b>he</b> is yet confin'd to it, for we shall find he is at present a {{prisoner}} at large: of both which circumstances of Satan I shall take occasion to speak in its course.|$|R
5000|$|Evaluation {{apprehension}} {{can affect}} subjects' behavior in psychological experiments, {{and can lead}} to invalid casual interference. Rosenberg defined evaluation apprehension as [...] "an active, anxiety-toned concern that he subject win a positive evaluation from the experimenter, <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> that <b>he</b> provide no grounds for a negative one." [...] As a result, subjects have conformed less in conformity studies and exhibited quicker conditioning in conditioning studies as part of a positive self-presentation.|$|R
6000|$|Verrian {{began to}} go rather {{regularly}} to the Andrews house, <b>or,</b> <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>he</b> was accused of doing it by Miss Macroyd when, very irregularly, he went one day to see her. [...] "How did you know it?" [...] he asked.|$|E
60|$|Corrie did {{not believe}} a word of this. He knew, <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> supposed, that Gascoyne had left the schooner, not having seen him since they sailed from Sandy Cove; but he knew nothing of {{the manner in which}} he had been put ashore.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Adeline, {{eager to}} be comforted, [...] "and I'm sure he's at the Mills. Elbridge has sent a {{dispatch}} {{to find out if}} he's there, but there must be something the matter with the telegraph. We hadn't heard before the funeral; <b>or,</b> <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>he</b> didn't bring the word; and I hated to keep round after him when--" ...|$|E
5000|$|Vincent Hiribarren, a {{lecturer}} {{in world history}} at King's College London, notes in his review of the film for History Extra, the website of BBC History Magazine: [...] "film clearly depicted Mandela's understanding of the apartheid years. <b>Or,</b> <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> what <b>he</b> wanted to let us know. As the film {{is not based on}} Mandela's life but on Mandela's own words, criticism levelled at Mandela's autobiography can also be directed at the film." ...|$|R
60|$|As {{he went on}} {{with these}} stock phrases, he seemed {{to get hold of}} things which before had seemed out of his reach, scraps of speeches, {{newspaper}} comments, an astonishing flood of arguments, <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> what <b>he</b> took for arguments, came rushing into his mind. He reached out his hands and grasped and used phrases not his own as if they were bludgeons. He assaulted the opposition blindly, but with immense power.|$|R
6000|$|... "Neither Mr. Hardinge nor Lucy {{would listen}} to it. I {{was present at the}} {{interview}} in which it was discussed, and our excellent guardian thanked his cousin for her kind intentions; but, in his simple way, he declared, as long as life was spared him, he felt it a duty to keep his girl; <b>or,</b> <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> until <b>he</b> committed her to the custody of a husband, or death should part them." ...|$|R
60|$|Bradley, {{ignored by}} everybody, was {{standing}} {{over by the}} trunk of a large oak tree, watching from afar the young girl who had so stirred him. She was eating dinner with Deering, his wife, and daughter, and Milton, who was there, looking very bright and handsome, <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> appeared so to Eileen Deering, a graceful little girl, his classmate at the seminary.|$|E
60|$|Captain Poke {{no longer}} deliberated about the course {{we were to}} steer. With his pumpkin for a chart, his {{instinct}} for an observation, and his nose for a compass, the sturdy sealer stood boldly to the southward; <b>or,</b> <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>he</b> ran dead before a stiff gale, which, as he more than once affirmed, was as true a norther as if bred and born in the Canadas.|$|E
6000|$|He thought {{well of the}} Bible, <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> spoke well, and did {{not think}} ill, of it, for {{that would not have}} been prudent for a man of his age. He said that he had read it attentively for many years, and he had much of it at his tongue's end. He seemed deeply {{impressed}} with a sense of his own nothingness, and would repeatedly exclaim,-- ...|$|E
50|$|On July 1, 2005, he {{made the}} news pages in Puerto Rico again, when he asked judge Salvador Casellas for his {{sentence}} of 45 years to be either suspended <b>or,</b> <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> modified so <b>he</b> could leave jail at an earlier time.|$|R
60|$|The archdeacon {{was delighted}} with the {{closeness}} of the reasoning. To do him justice, it was not a selfish triumph that he desired; he would personally lose nothing by defeat, <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> what <b>he</b> might lose did not actuate him; but neither was it love of justice which made him so anxious, nor even mainly solicitude for his father-in-law. He was fighting a part of a never-ending battle against a never-conquered foe--that of the church against its enemies.|$|R
50|$|Vetinari has created, (<b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> continued, though <b>he</b> denies it) {{the use of}} a team of clerks, {{sometimes}} called the 'Dark Clerks', who bring him information on just about everything; they serve, among other functions, as accountants, forensic auditors, and a domestic intelligence service.|$|R
