5|$|Like <b>other</b> <b>wines</b> {{produced}} in the United States, Oregon wines are marketed as varietals. Oregon law requires that wines {{produced in}} the state must be identified by the grape variety from which it was made, and for most varietals it must contain at least 90% of that variety. The exceptions to the 90% law are the following varietals: Red and White Bordeaux varietals, Red and White Rhône varietals, Sangiovese, Tempranillo, Zinfandel and Tannat. For these wines, they follow the Federal guidelines of 75%. Oregon law has long forbidden use of place names, except as appellations of origin. Oregon is most famous for its Pinot noir, which is produced throughout the state. Pinot noirs from the Willamette Valley have received much critical acclaim from wine connoisseurs and critics, and Oregon is {{regarded as one of}} the premier Pinot-producing regions in the world.|$|E

25|$|Finally, the steppes of Central Patagonia in Chubut {{have the}} southernmost wines in the world. The climate here is {{markedly}} colder {{than any other}} region, with a threat of summer frost.

25|$|A wine's {{overall quality}} assessment, {{based on this}} examination, follows further careful {{description}} and comparison with recognized standards, both with respect to <b>other</b> <b>wines</b> in its price range and according to known factors pertaining to the region or vintage; if it {{is typical of the}} region or diverges in style; if it uses certain wine-making techniques, such as barrel fermentation or malolactic fermentation, or any other remarkable or unusual characteristics.|$|E
25|$|Many {{of these}} {{nutrients}} {{are available in}} the must and skins of the grapes themselves but sometimes are supplemented by winemakers with additions such as diammonium phosphate (DAP), freeze-dried micro-nutrients (such as Go-Ferm and Ferm-K) and even the remnant of dead or extracted yeast cells such that the fermenting yeast can break down to mine for available nitrogen and nutrients. One historical winemaking tradition that is still practiced in some Italian wine regions is the ripasso method of adding the leftover pomace from the pressing of <b>other</b> <b>wines</b> into a newly fermenting batch of wine as an additional food source for the yeast.|$|E

25|$|The {{bacteria}} {{behind this}} {{process can be}} found naturally in the winery, in cooperages, which make oak wine barrels that will house a population of the bacteria or they can be introduced by the winemaker with a cultured specimen. For some wines, the conversion of malic into lactic acid can be beneficial, especially if the wine has excessive levels of malic acid. For <b>other</b> <b>wines,</b> such as Chenin blanc and Riesling, it produces off flavors in the wine (such as the buttery smell of diacetyl) {{that would not be}} appealing for that variety. In general, red wines are more often put through MLF than whites, which means a higher likelihood of finding malic acid in white wines (though notable exceptions, such as oaked Chardonnay, are often put through MLF).|$|E
500|$|The Revenue Act of 1764 that heavily taxed Madeira and <b>other</b> <b>wines</b> led to {{yet another}} boycott, this time against {{imported}} wines. This promoted another indigenous agricultural item of the American Colonies, the Vitis labrusca grapes. In 1765, Benjamin Franklin decided to use Poor Richard's Almanack to promote the growing of American grapes {{in order to encourage}} the production of domestic wines. One of Franklin's friends, Benjamin Gale, stated one evening at one of their gatherings [...] "We must drink wine of our own making or none at all;" [...] this opinion seemed to be a prevailing sentiment in the colonies from 1764 until the Revolution. Many who supported temperance in the colonies also supported the production of American wine at this time since the colonial form of temperance at the time was to drink only wine or beer instead of hard spirits.|$|E
2500|$|Whereas {{wines are}} {{regularly}} tasted in isolation, a wine's quality assessment is more objective when performed alongside several <b>other</b> <b>wines,</b> in {{what are known}} as tasting [...] "flights". Wines may be deliberately selected for their vintage ("horizontal" [...] tasting) or proceed from a single winery ("vertical" [...] tasting), to better compare vineyard and vintages, respectively. Alternatively, in order to promote an unbiased analysis, bottles and even glasses may be disguised in a [...] "blind" [...] tasting, to rule out any prejudicial awareness of either vintage or winery.|$|E

2500|$|Amboise wines were {{especially}} {{enjoyed by the}} French king, Louis XI, who published a charter stipulating that Amboise wines should be sold before all <b>other</b> <b>wines</b> at the market in Tours. In 1477 he also introduced an annual gift of one hundred muids (one muid equalled eight French cubic feet) of wine to the monks of Canterbury Church. Touraine wine was also routinely served at the table of the French king, François I, who was apparently moved to comment: [...] "Even though I was not born in Amboise, I grew up there, and all my life the taste of that divine draft from the beautiful city of Tours, so dear to my heart, has remained with me".|$|E

These strains are tested in laboratories to determine a strain's vigor, sulfur dioxide and alcohol tolerance, production levels of acetic acid and sulfur compounds, ability to re-ferment (positive for sparkling wine but a negative attribute for sweet late-harvest wines), development of surface film on the wine (positive for some Sherry styles but a negative attribute for many <b>other</b> <b>wines),</b> enhancement of a wine's color or certain varietal characteristics by enzymes in the yeast cells and other metabolic products produced by the yeast, foaming and flocculation tendencies, yeasticidal properties (a trait known as [...] "Killer yeast") and tolerance for nutritional deficiencies in a must {{that may lead to}} a stuck fermentation.|$|E
2500|$|In Champagne, where whole-cluster {{pressing}} {{in shallow}} basket press is very common, {{the tradition of}} separating the press fractions dates back to Dom Pérignon with guidelines recorded in 1718 by his biographer Canon Godinot.

Maremma is also home to Tuscany's newest DOCG, Morellino di Scansano, which makes a fragrant, dry Sangiovese based wine. The province of Grosseto is one of Tuscany's emerging wine regions with eight DOC designations, half of which were created in the late 1990s. It includes the Monteregio di Massa Marittima region which has been recently the recipient of foreign investment in the area's wine, especially by [...] "flying winemakers". The Parrina region is known for its white wine blend of Trebbiano and Ansonica. The wine Bianco di Pitigliano is known for its eclectic mix of white wine grapes in the blend including Chardonnay, the Greco sub variety of Trebbiano, Grechetto, Malvasia, Pinot blanc, Verdello and Welschriesling. In Maremma, a hidden gem with many wineries, is Poggio Argentiera winery which makes Morellino di Scansano and <b>other</b> <b>wines.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Pedro Ximénez is {{most widely}} grown in Spain {{where there were}} [...] of the grape in {{cultivation}} as of 2008. The vast majority of these plantings {{are found in the}} Spanish wine region of Montilla-Moriles where the grapes are used to make fortified Sherry-style wines labelled as PX. After harvest the Pedro Ximénez grapes are traditionally laid out on mats to further desiccate and dry in the sun (in a style similar to straw wine production). The high sugar and low acid wine made from these pressings may be fortified or not, depending on winemaker style, but will usually be very sweet and have a strong aroma and flavor of raisins. The wine may also be aged in a solera, similar to Sherry, with the age of the solera often stated on the wine label. Additionally, some Pedro Ximénez grapes are used as sweetening agents for <b>other</b> <b>wines</b> made in the Montilla-Moriles region.|$|E

2500|$|No {{where was}} the {{analysis}} of the difference in press fractions more astute than in the Champagne wine region where Dom Pérignon was recorded in 1718 by biographer Canon Godinot to have laid out these specifications for how the press fractions of juice destined to be Champagne should be handled. First the pressing were to happen quickly, as soon after harvest as possible to keep the juice at its freshest and to avoid any coloring from the red wine grapes of Pinot noir and Pinot Meunier. The [...] free run vin de goutte was considered too delicate and lacking on its own to make fine Champagne and it was sometimes discarded or used for <b>other</b> <b>wines.</b> The first and second pressings (called tailles or cut since the pomace cake was literally cut with ropes, chains or paddles to remove it between pressings) were the most ideal for sparkling wine production.
