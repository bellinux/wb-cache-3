40|$|The serine/threonine kinase {{mammalian}} {{target of}} rapamycin (mTOR) governs growth, metabolism, and aging {{in response to}} insulin and amino acids (aa), and is often activated in metabolic disorders and cancer. Much {{is known about the}} regulatory signaling network that encompasses mTOR, but surprisingly few direct mTOR substrates have been established to date. To tackle this gap in our knowledge, we took advantage of a combined quantitative phosphoproteomic and interactomic strategy. We analyzed the insulin- and aa-responsive phosphoproteome upon inhibition of the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC 1) component raptor, and investigated in parallel the interactome of endogenous mTOR. By <b>overlaying</b> <b>these</b> <b>two</b> datasets, we identified acinus L as a potential novel mTORC 1 target. We confirmed acinus L as a direct mTORC 1 substrate by co-immunoprecipitation and MS-enhanced kinase assays. Our study delineates a triple proteomics strategy of combined phosphoproteomics, interactomics, and MS-enhanced kinase assays for the de novo-identification of mTOR network components, and provides a rich source of potential novel mTOR interactors and targets for future investigation...|$|R

The motion weight prediction exploits both the block-based motion estimation and Gaussian masks to predict the coarse location of seams in the current frame and reduce the search range of dynamic programming.

40|$|Long Term Evolution (LTE) is a {{standard}} for wireless communication developed by the 3 rd Generation Partnership Project (3 GPP) with an aim {{to fulfill the requirements}} defined for the fourth generation (4 G) wireless networks. With more than hundred service providers across the globe and around one billion subscribers predicted by the year 2016, LTE is set to become the first true global standard. With the high data rates supported by LTE, improvements like Content Distribution Network (CDN) and increase in router switching speeds, popularity of video streaming services over the mobile networks is set to touch a new high. This popularity provides opportunity to the network operators to increase their revenues, but it also challenges them to provide video streams with minimum desirable quality to their customers. This has led to the emergence of two popular single layer video coding standards namely, H. 264 /AVC and more recently H. 265 /High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC). With LTE being projected as a candidate to fuel the future 4 G services, it is desirable to evaluate the performance of <b>these</b> <b>two</b> <b>video</b> coding standards over the LTE networks. The first part of this project tries to evaluate the video quality offered by <b>these</b> <b>two</b> <b>video</b> coding standards over LTE network by studying the impact of delay, distance and number of users in the LTE cell. In the second part of this project we implement a frame dropping mechanism which drops low priority frames of the video encoded with hierarchical B-frame structure when the channel conditions are not ideal, thus providing graceful degradation to the single layer videos. This mechanism tries to exploit the fact that in a video that is encoded using a hierarchical structure, the loss of a frame that belongs to the higher indexed temporal layer of a video has less negative impact on the video quality in comparison to the loss of a frame in the lower indexed temporal layer...|$|R

Interestingly, the actor himself was not able to annotate the animated actor video with high accuracy as compared to his annotated text. This argues that for future work we must have our actors also annotate their body and facial expressions, not just the text, in order to further investigate the effectiveness of our virtual storyteller.

40|$|Filming {{of their}} own {{military}} activities by the spawning militant organisations in the Middle East {{seems to be a}} major propaganda tool used to win their media battles. Historically and {{in the context of the}} Arab-Israeli conflict, the Palestinian Liberation Organisation has been aware of the significance of filming their military activities since the 1970 s. However, Hezbollah's military arm, "The Islamic Resistance", established a military media unit in the mid- 1980 s and one of its missions is to film its military operations against the Israeli troops in south Lebanon. Although there are studies about a number of military operations' videos, it seems their basic aims are to explore the notion of propaganda. Furthermore, the studies have focused only on the military operations' videos before the Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon in May 2000. However, this paper investigates the contexts and the visual contents of the <b>two</b> military operations‘ <b>videos</b> of capturing Israeli soldiers by ―The Islamic Resistance, the military arm of Lebanese Hezbollah, in October 2000 and July 2006.
