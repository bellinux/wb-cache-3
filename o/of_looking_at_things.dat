Upset that Donald Trump won the election, Madonna spoke out against him at the Women's March on Washington, a day after his inauguration. The singer sparked controversy {{when she said that}} she [...] "thought a lot about blowing up the White House". The following day, she asserted she was [...] "not a violent person" [...] and that her quote had been [...] "taken wildly out of context", adding [...] "I spoke in metaphor and I shared two ways <b>of</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>things</b> — one was to be hopeful, and one was to feel anger and outrage". In February 2017, Madonna adopted four-year-old twin sisters from Malawi named Esther and Stella. In late summer 2017, Madonna moved to Lisbon, Portugal with her adoptive children.|$|E
500|$|Tatiana was {{practical}} {{and had a}} natural talent for leadership. Her sisters gave her the nickname [...] "The Governess" [...] and sent her as their group representative when they wanted their parents to grant a favor. Though she was eighteen months Tatiana's senior, Olga had no objection when Tatiana decided {{to take charge of}} a situation. [...] She was also closer to her mother than any of her sisters and was considered by many who knew her to be the Tsarina's favorite daughter. Tatiana was the conduit of all her mother's decisions. [...] "It was not that her sisters loved their mother any less," [...] recalled her French tutor Pierre Gilliard, [...] "but Tatiana knew how to surround her with unwearying attentions and never gave way to her own capricious impulses." [...] Alexandra wrote Nicholas on 13 March 1916 that Tatiana {{was the only one of}} their four daughters who [...] "grasped it" [...] when she explained her way <b>of</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>things.</b>|$|E

5|$|During {{the mission}} status briefing, Jennifer Wiseman, Chief of Exoplanet and Stellar Astrophysics for Goddard Space Flight Center, {{noted that the}} repair of STIS was a major victory for both the mission and the science community, as {{that part of the}} {{telescope}} performed unique functions, helping scientists understand the materials planets are composed <b>of,</b> and <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>things</b> like the motion of stars around black holes.|$|R

2500|$|An {{ideology}} {{is a set}} of ideas that constitute one's goals, expectations, and actions. An ideology {{can be thought of as}} a comprehensive vision, as a way <b>of</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>things</b> (compare worldview), as in several philosophical tendencies (see Political ideologies), or a set of ideas proposed by the dominant class of a society to all members of this society (a [...] "received consciousness" [...] or product of socialization).|$|E
2500|$|A central idea in Poythress' thought has {{concerned}} {{the validity of}} multiple perspectives, or multiperspectivalism, a project that {{he shares with his}} teacher and collaborator John Frame. In Poythress's work Philosophy, Science, and the Sovereignty of God, he explored how the scientific concepts of wave, particle and field can be used analogically to demonstrate different ways <b>of</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>things.</b> He argued that such a triadic structure is [...] "a means of avoiding unhealthy dualism", and he continued on this line of thought in Symphonic Theology, where he applied multiperspectivalism to theology.|$|E

6000|$|Thus, {{in our way}} <b>of</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> these <b>things,</b> interpolations by rhapsodists are {{not often}} needed as {{explanations}} of difficulties. Still, granted that the rhapsodists, like the jongleurs, had texts, and that these were studied by the makers of the Vulgate, interpolations and errors might creep in by this way. As to changes in language, [...] "a poetical dialect... is liable to be gradually modified by {{the influence of the}} ever-changing colloquial speech.

He credits his heavy veto pen for eliminating New Mexico's budget deficit and cutting the growth rate of New Mexico's government in half." [...] According to the Myrtle Beach Sun News, Johnson [...] "said his numerous vetoes, only two of which were overridden, stemmed from his philosophy <b>of</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> all <b>things</b> for their cost–benefit ratio and his axe fell on Republicans as well as Democrats." ...|$|R

5000|$|In {{his study}} on color (Farbenlehre), Goethe {{challenged}} the view observers can look devoid and naive of theoretical context; likewise, challenging {{the assumption of}} shared common neutral language in science research and innovation.

Thus it is evident we theorize every time we look attentively out into the world."

To what extent do such investigations, experiments and insights shape the view on ‘nature’, and on ‘our’ bodies? How do these insights link to the concept of living organisms as biofacts?
