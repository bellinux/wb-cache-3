5|$|Louis-René Villermé (10 March 1782 – 16 November 1863) was a French {{economist}} and physician. He {{was known for}} his early studies of social epidemiology, or the effects of socioeconomic status on health, in early industrial France, and was an advocate for hygienic reform in factories and prisons. His work is considered pivotal {{in the history of the}} fields of sociology and statistical inquiry, and he is considered a founder <b>of</b> <b>epidemiology.</b>|$|E
5|$|His {{most popular}} work {{was that of}} Tableau de l'état {{physique}} et moral des ouvriers employés dans les manufactures de coton, de laine et de soie (Study of the Physical Condition of Cotton, Wool and Silk workers), the final product of extended research and observation, published in the year 1840. The book outlined the physical and moral conditions of different labor forces. Villermé discussed his observations made concerning workers in the cotton, wool, and silk industries. He brought attention to the treacherous working conditions, unfit for adults {{as well as the}} danger for young children working alongside the adults, and critiqued the low wages provided to workers. There was a comparison throughout the entirety of the first section between the three occupations and different locations throughout France. The second portion of the book included the topic of health as it relates to dangerous workplaces and the effects of low pay and overcrowding. and he is considered a founder <b>of</b> <b>epidemiology.</b> Villermé covered a wide array of subject matter including: children in the workplace, savings accounts, asylum rooms, and drunkenness among the working class. The work was unique in combining health topics with research and social reforms.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the storm, extensive psychological effects were documented. Difficulty during clean-up and recovery lead to increased divorce rates and a spike in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The cases of PTSD primarily impacted children. A sampling of 378adolescents by the University of South Carolina's Department <b>of</b> <b>Epidemiology</b> and Biostatistics indicated that 3% of males and 9% of females met the criteria for PTSD. Dozens of children in the area attempted suicide, while counselors reported that between 50 and 60children discussed killing themselves between December1992 and January1993. A panel of psychiatrists and psychologists at the University of Miami agreed that as many as 90% of residents in the worst impacted areas would experience at least a few symptoms of PTSD. Within six months, the circumstances related to {{the aftermath}} of Andrew led to at least five suicides and four homicides.|$|E

25|$|John Snow {{is famous}} for his {{investigations}} into {{the causes of the}} 19th century cholera epidemics, and is also known as the father of (modern) epidemiology. He began with noticing the significantly higher death rates in two areas supplied by Southwark Company. His identification of the Broad Street pump as the cause of the Soho epidemic is considered the classic example <b>of</b> <b>epidemiology.</b> Snow used chlorine in an attempt to clean the water and removed the handle; this ended the outbreak. This has been perceived as a major event in the history of public health and regarded as the founding event of the science <b>of</b> <b>epidemiology,</b> having helped shape public health policies around the world. However, Snow’s research and preventive measures to avoid further outbreaks were not fully accepted or put into practice until after his death.|$|E

25|$|Racial {{categories}} remain {{widely used}} in medical research, but this can create important problems.

25|$|Tracking the {{transmission}} of infectious diseases is called disease surveillance. Surveillance of infectious diseases in the public realm traditionally has been the responsibility of public health agencies, either on the (inter)national or a local level. Public health staff rely on health care workers and microbiology laboratories to report cases of reportable diseases to them. The analysis of aggregate data can show the spread of a disease and {{is at the core}} of the specialty <b>of</b> <b>epidemiology.</b>|$|E

25|$|Other factors outside {{culture that}} {{demonstrate}} differences in domestic violence prevalence and gender disparities in India include socioeconomic class, educational level, and family structure beyond the patriarchal framework. A 1999 study {{published by the}} American Journal <b>of</b> <b>Epidemiology</b> identified so-called “stress factors” that are critical to understanding varying rates of domestic violence in other scopes outside of region-specific factors. These stress-related factors within the household include low educational attainment, poverty, young initial age of marriage, having multiple children, and other limiting engendered development factors.|$|E

25|$|Snow later used a dot map to {{illustrate}} the cluster of cholera cases around the pump. He also used statistics {{to illustrate}} {{the connection between the}} quality of the water source and cholera cases. He showed that the Southwark and Vauxhall Waterworks Company was taking water from sewage-polluted sections of the Thames and delivering the water to homes, leading to an increased incidence of cholera. Snow's study was a major event in the history of public health and geography. It is regarded as the founding event of the science <b>of</b> <b>epidemiology.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{health effects}} of smoking have been {{significant}} {{for the development of}} the science <b>of</b> <b>epidemiology.</b> As the mechanism of carcinogenicity is radiomimetic or radiological, the effects are stochastic. Definite statements can be made only on the relative increased or decreased probabilities of contracting a given disease. For a particular individual, it is impossible to definitively prove a direct causal link between exposure to a radiomimetic poison such as tobacco smoke and the cancer that follows; such statements can only be made at the aggregate population level. Tobacco companies have capitalized on this philosophical objection and exploited the doubts of clinicians, who consider only individual cases, on the causal link in the stochastic expression of the toxicity as actual disease.|$|E
25|$|Cholera affects an {{estimated}} 3–5million people worldwide and causes 28,800–130,000deaths a year. Although it {{is classified as}} a pandemic as of 2010, it is rare in the developed world. Children are mostly affected. Cholera occurs as both outbreaks and chronically in certain areas. Areas with an ongoing risk of disease include Africa and south-east Asia. While {{the risk of death}} among those affected is usually less than 5%, it may be as high as 50% among some groups who {{do not have access to}} treatment. Historical descriptions of cholera are found as early as the 5th century BC in Sanskrit. The study of cholera in England by John Snow between 1849 and 1854 led to significant advances in the field <b>of</b> <b>epidemiology.</b>|$|E

However, despite the hardships suffered by the experiences of war, many went on to live normal everyday lives. Among the Puerto Ricans who served in Vietnam and held important presidential administrative positions in the Administration of President George W. Bush were Major General William A.

25|$|In February 1912, he {{was hired}} as a {{professor}} at the bacteriology department of the University of Iași medical faculty. The department lacked a physical space and a laboratory, and for nearly thirteen years had been staffed by substitute professors. Working in a room in Corneliu Șumuleanu's chemistry department, he offered a popular course attended by doctors as well as students. In 1913, during the Second Balkan War, he was sent to the front in Bulgaria {{in order to deal with}} a cholera epidemic. Decorated with the Military Virtue Medal in gold, he returned in 1914 and began to set up a bacteriology laboratory. He trained the first assistants and rented and furnished a house. Although the initial 10,000 lei and the additional 3000 lei per year received from the Education Ministry were woefully inadequate, he supplemented these with personal funds, private donations and substantial grants from the health department of the Interior Ministry, managing to set up a suitable laboratory for a country that had entered World War I by 1916. His textbook <b>of</b> <b>epidemiology</b> and vaccination, coauthored with Constantin Ionescu-Mihăești and Mihai Ciucă, had come out in 1915.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, the University of Georgia {{acquired}} the former U.S. Navy Supply Corps School {{on the medical}} corridor of Prince Avenue near downtown Athens. The two primary occupants of the 56-acre Health Sciences Campus are the AU-UGA Medical Partnership and the UGA College of Public Health. The campus has an extensive landscaped green space, more than 400 trees and several historic buildings. The majority of classes for both medical and public health students are held in Russell Hall, {{not to be confused}} with the South campus undergraduate residence hall, which was built in 1974. The nearly 63,000 square-foot building includes rooms for small group and clinical skills teaching, a lab for gross anatomy, pathology and histology, a medical library, faculty offices, and classroom space. The AU-UGA Medical Partnership administrative offices are housed in Winnie Davis Hall, which was built in 1902. In 2013, it was announced that St. Mary's Hospital, Northeast Georgia Health System and Athens Regional Medical Center would be utilized as teaching hospitals and residency sites for the Medical Partnership students. The College of Public Health's administrative offices are housed in Rhodes Hall, which was built in 1906. Six of the College's seven units are now located on the Health Sciences Campus, including the Institute of Gerontology in Hudson Hall, the Department <b>of</b> <b>Epidemiology</b> and Biostatistics in B.S.
