5|$|There are variant glyph forms {{which contain}} minor {{alterations}} or additions. Dietrich posited that these variants represent the movement, position, {{and significance of}} astronomical bodies. A variant form might state whether a star is rising, culminating or setting; <b>or</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> used for navigation or for calendrical/time-keeping purposes. In particular, doubling of a feature may refer to the culmination of an astronomical body in the sky.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there are}} at least three staging systems for cholangiocarcinoma (e.g. those of Bismuth, Blumgart, and the American Joint Committee on Cancer), none have been shown to be useful in {{predicting}} survival. The most important staging issue is whether the tumor can be surgically removed, <b>or</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> too advanced for surgical treatment to be successful. Often, this determination can only be made at the time of surgery.|$|E
5|$|Finally, the Court {{expressed}} {{the view that}} if free speech is to be favoured over the protection of reputation in applying a Reynolds-type defence, another issue {{that will have to}} be considered is what balance should be struck between the two competing interests. In this connection, Chan C.J. said that the court would have to decide whether freedom of expression is to be given preference over the protection of reputation, whether it is a fundamental right that trumps the protection of reputation unless it is shown that the defamatory statement was made maliciously, <b>or</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> co-equal with the protection of reputation.|$|E

5|$|It is {{not known}} if C.tuberosa is {{strictly}} parasitic, and needs the host to be living, <b>or</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> saprobic. Either way, the fruit bodies of the fungus are found growing solitarily or in dense clusters on the decomposing, often blackened remains of other mushrooms. Hosts include agarics (particularly Lactarius and Russula), boletes, hydnums, and polypores. In the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, Russula crassotunicata is a common and abundant species that has been definitively identified as a host of both C.tuberosa and Dendrocollybia racemosa. The Russula fruit bodies are slow to decay, and are available nearly year-round as a substrate for the saprobes. Based on field observations, the authors suggest that C.tuberosa may produce fruit bodies on less decayed mushrooms, while D.racemosa produces them on much more heavily decayed mushrooms.|$|E
5|$|M-type (metal-rich) asteroids form about 10% of {{the total}} population; their spectra {{resemble}} that of iron-nickel. Some {{are believed to have}} formed from the metallic cores of differentiated progenitor bodies that were disrupted through collision. However, there are also some silicate compounds that can produce a similar appearance. For example, the large M-type asteroid 22 Kalliope {{does not appear to be}} primarily composed of metal. Within the asteroid belt, the number distribution of M-type asteroids peaks at a semi-major axis of about 2.7AU. It is not yet clear whether all M-types are compositionally similar, <b>or</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a label for several varieties which do not fit neatly into the main C and S classes.|$|E
5|$|The {{prognosis}} of {{head trauma}} {{is thought to}} be influenced in part by the location and amount of subarachnoid bleeding. It is difficult to isolate the effects of SAH from those of other aspects of traumatic brain injury; it is unknown whether the presence of subarachnoid blood actually worsens the prognosis <b>or</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> merely a sign that a significant trauma has occurred. People with moderate and severe traumatic brain injury who have SAH when admitted to a hospital have as much as twice the risk of dying as those who do not. They also have a higher risk of severe disability and persistent vegetative state, and traumatic SAH has been correlated with other markers of poor outcome such as post traumatic epilepsy, hydrocephalus, and longer stays in the intensive care unit. However, more than 90 percent of people with traumatic subarachnoid bleeding and a Glasgow Coma Score over 12 have a good outcome.|$|E

25|$|An {{examination}} of myth and symbol {{reveals that the}} work may be better understood as an internal drama of a conflicted modern man {{rather than as a}} representation of external reality in a failed utopia. The city is laid out as a mandala, populated with archetypes and subject to an archetypal conflict. One wonders if Zamyatin were familiar with the theories of his contemporary C. G.

25|$|In certain cases, {{a person}} might {{be liable for}} their {{employee}} or child under the law of agency through the doctrine of respondeat superior. For example, if a shop employee spilled cleaning liquid on the supermarket floor and a victim fell and suffered injuries, the plaintiff {{might be able to}} sue either the employee or the employer. There is considerable academic debate about whether vicarious liability is justified on no better basis than the search for a solvent defendant, <b>or</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> well founded on the theory of efficient risk allocation.|$|E
25|$|Some {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} into how often gay men use homosexual slang terms that are often not understandable to those outside of the LGBT community. The particular slang used by gay men as well as lesbians has been recorded in a number of specialist dictionaries, and according to researcher Greg Jacobs, is that the terminology listed in said dictionaries revolves heavily around sexual matters including terms for sex organs, preferences and activities, although Jacobs questions whether this accurately reflects {{the amount of time spent}} by gay people talking about sex and sexuality <b>or</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> down to methodological assumptions that conversations amongst LGBT people is primarily dominated with talk about sex.|$|E
25|$|Test {{anxiety is}} the uneasiness, apprehension, or {{nervousness}} felt by {{students who have}} a fear of failing an exam. Students who have test anxiety may experience any of the following: the association of grades with personal worth; fear of embarrassment by a teacher; fear of alienation from parents or friends; time pressures; or feeling a loss of control. Sweating, dizziness, headaches, racing heartbeats, nausea, fidgeting, uncontrollable crying or laughing and drumming on a desk are all common. Because test anxiety hinges on fear of negative evaluation, debate exists as to whether test anxiety is itself a unique anxiety disorder <b>or</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{a specific type of}} social phobia. The DSM-IV classifies test anxiety as a type of social phobia.|$|E

25|$|The BMD-4 {{features}} an advanced fire control system (FCS). The unique armament system {{provided by the}} Bakhcha-U and the reliable ride performance provided by the chassis gives the BMD-4 qualitatively new capabilities to units of land forces. The BMD-4 is able to fire all its primary armaments effectively {{regardless of whether the}} vehicle is stationary or mobile, whether the time is day or night, <b>or</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> afloat or land based. The FCS implements a significant increase of the armament effectiveness by engaging a wide scope of targets in complicated weather and landscape conditions. Advanced ballistic calculations allow the BMD-4 to fire from an enclosed position and the capability of effectively firing at low and slow aerial targets is provided.|$|E
25|$|The much fainter {{red dwarf}} Proxima Centauri, or simply Proxima, is about 13,000 astronomical units (AU) away from Alpha Centauri AB. This is {{equivalent}} to —about 5% the distance between Alpha Centauri AB and the Sun. Due to the large distance between Proxima and Alpha, it was long unknown whether they were gravitationally bound. The true orbital speed is necessarily small, and {{it was necessary to}} measure the speeds of Proxima and Alpha with a great precision. Otherwise it was impossible to ascertain whether Proxima is bound to Alpha <b>or</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a completely unrelated star that happens to be undergoing a close approach at a low relative speed. Probability suggested that such low speed approaches would be rare and unlikely, but it could not be ruled out.|$|E
25|$|Controllability and {{observability}} are main {{issues in}} the analysis of a system before deciding the best control strategy to be applied, <b>or</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> even possible to control or stabilize the system. Controllability is related to the possibility of forcing the system into a particular state by using an appropriate control signal. If a state is not controllable, then no signal {{will ever be able to}} control the state. If a state is not controllable, but its dynamics are stable, then the state is termed stabilizable. Observability instead is related to the possibility of observing, through output measurements, the state of a system. If a state is not observable, the controller will never be able to determine the behavior of an unobservable state and hence cannot use it to stabilize the system. However, similar to the stabilizability condition above, if a state cannot be observed it might still be detectable.|$|E

25|$|According to {{the plume}} model, {{the source of}} Icelandic {{volcanism}} lies deep beneath {{the center of the}} island. The earliest volcanic rocks attributed to the plume are found {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic. Their ages have been determined to lie between 58 and 64 million years. This coincides with the opening of the north Atlantic in the late Paleocene and early Eocene, which has led to suggestions that the arrival of the plume was linked to, and has perhaps contributed to, the breakup of the North Atlantic continent. In the framework of the plume hypothesis, the volcanism was caused by the flow of hot plume material initially beneath thick continental lithosphere and then beneath the lithosphere of the growing ocean basin as rifting proceeded. The exact position of the plume at that time is a matter of disagreement between scientists, as is whether the plume is thought to have ascended from the deep mantle only at that time <b>or</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> much older and also responsible for the old volcanism in northern Greenland, on Ellesmere Island, and at Alpha Ridge in the Arctic.|$|E
500|$|Thio Li-ann {{has noted}} {{that it is not}} clear whether the Court of Appeal was laying down [...] "intentional and {{arbitrary}} discrimination" [...] as the sole test for whether executive acts comply with Article 12(1) of the Constitution, <b>or</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> only one possible test and that executive acts can also be challenged if they fail a reasonable classification test. This is because [...] "rbitrariness implies the lack of any rationality", and it is much harder for a plaintiff to prove that executive action is irrational than to show that there is no reasonable classification in the action.|$|E

However, there is disagreement over whether this model of decline is produced by James' own disillusionment, <b>or</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> evidence of Crèvecœur's voice interceding into the narrative; further, critics disagree over where in the narrative the disillusionment occurs, variably placing it in the third, eighth and ninth letters.|$|E
