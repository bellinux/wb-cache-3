5|$|Marguerite Louise's extravagances perturbed Ferdinando {{because the}} Tuscan {{exchequer}} was nearly bankrupt; {{it was so}} empty that when the Wars <b>of</b> <b>Castro</b> mercenaries were paid for, the state {{could no longer afford}} to pay interest on government bonds. Accordingly, the interest rate was lowered by 0.75%. The economy, too, was so decrepit that barter trade became prevalent in rural market places. In August 1663 Marguerite Louise delivered a boy: Ferdinando. Two more children followed: Anna Maria Luisa in 1667 and Gian Gastone in 1671.|$|E
5|$|Milk's {{continuing}} campaign, {{run from}} the storefront <b>of</b> <b>Castro</b> Camera, was a study in disorganization. Although the older Irish grandmothers and gay men who volunteered were plentiful and happy to send out mass mailings, Milk's notes and volunteer lists were kept on scrap papers. Any time the campaign required funds, the money came from the cash register without any consideration for accounting. The campaign manager's assistant was an 11-year-old neighborhood girl. Milk himself was hyperactive and prone to fantastic outbursts of temper, only to recover quickly and shout excitedly about something else. Many of his rants were directed at his lover, Scott Smith, who was becoming disillusioned {{with the man who}} was no longer the laid-back hippie he had fallen in love with.|$|E
