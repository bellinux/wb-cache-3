He has also dedicated much of his career to US–Ireland relations and maintaining American involvement in the Northern Ireland peace process, for which he has won several acclamations. He has a generally liberal voting record, but is considered a moderate on such issues as abortion and trade.|$|E
5|$|On September 3, 2009, The Washington Post {{called on}} Rangel to resign his {{chairmanship}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>Ways</b> and Means Committee, given the ethical issues that had surfaced. Another Republican resolution was put forth {{to force him}} out of his chairmanship. However, Rangel stayed in place and mostly maintained his role in House leadership and policy discussions, including the Obama health care reform plan (opposition to which, he suggested, was partly due to racial prejudice against President Obama). Nevertheless, his influence was diminished by the questions surrounding him.|$|E
5|$|Sereno E. Payne, {{chairman}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>Ways</b> and Means Committee, {{had held}} hearings in late 1908, and sponsored the resulting draft legislation. On balance, the bill reduced tariffs slightly, {{but when it}} passed the House in April 1909 and reached the Senate, {{the chairman of the}} Senate Finance Committee, Rhode Island Senator Nelson W. Aldrich, attached many amendments raising rates. This outraged progressives such as Wisconsin's Robert M. La Follette, who urged Taft to say that the bill was not in accord with the party platform. Taft refused, angering them. Taft insisted that most imports from the Philippines be free of duty, and according to Anderson, showed effective leadership on a subject he was knowledgeable on and cared about.|$|E

5|$|To fund this army, Hamilton wrote {{regularly}} to Oliver Wolcott Jr., his successor at the Treasury William Loughton Smith, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>Ways</b> and Means Committee and Senator Theodore Sedgwick of Massachusetts. He directed them {{to pass a}} direct tax to fund the war. Smith resigned in July 1797, as Hamilton scolded him for slowness, and told Wolcott to tax houses instead of land. The eventual program included a Stamp Act {{like that of the}} British before the Revolution and other taxes on land, houses, and slaves, calculated at different rates in different states, and requiring difficult and intricate assessment of houses. This provoked resistance in southeastern Pennsylvania, led primarily by men such as John Fries who had marched with Washington against the Whiskey Rebellion.|$|E
5|$|When {{war began}} in April 1861, Stevens {{argued that the}} Confederates were revolutionaries, to be crushed by force. He also {{believed}} that the Confederacy had placed itself beyond {{the protection of the}} U.S. Constitution by making war, and in a reconstituted United States, slavery would have no place. Speaker Galusha Grow, whose views placed him with Stevens among the members becoming known as the Radical Republican (for their position on slavery, as opposed to the Conservative or Moderate Republicans), appointed him as chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>Ways</b> and Means Committee. This position gave him power over the House's agenda.|$|E
5|$|FairTax proponents {{argue that}} the {{proposal}} would provide tax burden visibility and reduce compliance and efficiency costs by 90%, returning {{a large share of}} money to the productive economy. The Beacon Hill Institute concluded that the FairTax would save $346.51 billion in administrative costs and would be a much more efficient taxation system. Bill Archer, former head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>Ways</b> and Means Committee, asked Princeton University Econometrics to survey 500 European and Asian companies regarding the effect on their business decisions if the United States enacted the FairTax. 400 of those companies stated they would build their next plant in the United States, and 100 companies said they would move their corporate headquarters to the United States. Supporters {{argue that the}} U.S. has the highest combined statutory corporate income tax rate among OECD countries along with being the only country with no border adjustment element in its tax system. Proponents state that because the FairTax eliminates corporate income taxes and is automatically border adjustable, the competitive tax advantage of foreign producers would be eliminated, immediately boosting U.S. competitiveness overseas and at home.|$|E

5|$|In 1886, a bill {{to reduce}} the tariff was {{narrowly}} defeated in the House. The tariff issue was emphasized in the Congressional elections that year, and the forces of protectionism increased their numbers in the Congress, but Cleveland continued to advocate tariff reform. As the surplus grew, Cleveland and the reformers called for a tariff for revenue only. His message to Congress in 1887 (quoted at right) highlighted the injustice of taking more money from the people than the government needed to pay its operating expenses. Republicans, as well as protectionist northern Democrats like Samuel J. Randall, believed that American industries would fail without high tariffs, and they continued to fight reform efforts. Roger Q. Mills, chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>Ways</b> and Means Committee, proposed {{a bill to}} reduce the tariff from about 47% to about 40%. After significant exertions by Cleveland and his allies, the bill passed the House. The Republican Senate failed to come to agreement with the Democratic House, and the bill died in the conference committee. Dispute over the tariff persisted into the 1888 presidential election.|$|E

Rostenkowski was defeated for re-election in 1994 after pleading guilty to mail fraud and had been succeeded by Republican Michael Patrick Flanagan. However, Flanagan was a conservative Republican representing a heavily Democratic district, and {{was regarded as a}} heavy underdog. Blagojevich soundly defeated Flanagan by a nearly 2-to-1 margin, with support from his father-in-law.

25|$|To {{facilitate}} {{reduction of}} the tariffs, Wilson garnered unexpected support from a previous rival Oscar Underwood, Chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>Ways</b> and Means Committee, and Sen. Furnifold M. Simmons, Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. In May 1913, the Underwood Tariff passed in the House {{by a vote of}} 274 to 5; it would take a bit longer passing in the Senate—in September—and was signed by Wilson three weeks later. Its effects were soon overwhelmed by the changes in trade caused by World War I. Wilson mobilized public opinion behind the tariff changes by denouncing corporate lobbyists in an address to Congress, and by staging an elaborate signing ceremony. The revenue lost by the lower tariff was replaced by a new federal income tax, authorized by the 16th Amendment.|$|E
25|$|As a back-up position, in 1965 Johnson {{turned his}} focus to {{hospital}} insurance {{for the aged}} under Social Security. The key player in initiating this program, named Medicare, was Wilbur Mills, Chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>Ways</b> and Means Committee. In order to reduce Republican opposition, Mills suggested that Medicare be fashioned as a three layer cake—hospital insurance under Social Security, a voluntary insurance program for doctor visits and an expanded medical welfare program for the poor, known as Medicaid. The bill passed the house {{by a margin of}} 110 votes on April 8. The effort in the Senate was considerably more complicated; however, the Medicare bill passed Congress on July 28 after negotiation in a conference committee. Medicare now covers tens of millions of Americans. Johnson gave the first two Medicare cards to former President Harry S Truman and his wife Bess after signing the Medicare bill at the Truman Library in Independence, Missouri.|$|E
