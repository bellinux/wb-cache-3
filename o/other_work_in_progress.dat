40|$|Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol (ISATAP) draft-ietf-ngtrans-isatap- 02. txt This {{document}} specifies an intra-site automatic tunneling protocol (ISATAP) for connecting IPv 6 {{hosts and}} routers (nodes) within predominantly IPv 4 -based networks. This method {{is based on}} an IPv 6 aggregatable global unicast address format (described herein) that embeds the IPv 4 address of a node within the EUI- 64 format interface identifier. This document assumes that, during the IPv 4 to IPv 6 coexistence and transition phase, many sites will deploy IPv 6 incrementally within their IPv 4 interior routing domains; especially those sites which have large and complex pre-existing IPv 4 infrastructures. Within such sites, the address format and methods described in this document will enable IPv 6 deployment for nodes that do not share a common link with an IPv 6 gateway for their site. While <b>other</b> <b>works</b> <b>in</b> <b>progress</b> <b>in</b> the NGTRANS working group propose mechanisms for assigning globally-unique IPv 6 address prefixes to sites and methods for inter-domain routing between such sites, the approach outlined in this memo enables large-scale incremental deployment of IPv 6 for nodes within a site’s pre-existing IPv 4 infrastructure without incurring aggregation scaling issues at the border gateways nor requiring site-wide deployment of special IPv 4 services such as multicast. The approach proposed by this document supports IPv 6 routing within both the site-local and global IPv 6 routing domains as well as automatic IPv 6 in IPv 4 tunneling across portions of a site’s IPv 4 infrastructure which have no native IPv 6 support. Additionally, this approach supports automatic tunneling within sites which use non globally-unique IPv 4 address assignments, such as when Network Address Translation [NAT] is used.

40|$|Even {{within a}} globalizing world, Luxembourg takes an {{exceptional}} position {{with a foreign}} population of 43 %, which rises to 66 % in the capital. Luxembourg can thus be called a “natural laboratory” regarding the macro-level conditions for multiculturalism. In a series of quantitative studies we have investigated how this plural composition of society is experienced at the individual or micro level. In a first study, we examined factors contributing to the endorsement of multiculturalism by various Luxembourg resident groups, i. e. native Luxembourgers, residents with migration background, sojourners and daily commuters (total n= 621). Within these groups we differentiated between mono-cultural and bi- or multicultural individuals. We determined the respective in-group, assessed the strength of in-group identification, between-group contacts {{and the perception of}} the cultural distance between groups. At trait level we tested the relationship between Schwartz Values structures and the endorsement of multiculturalism.

40|$|Phenytoin in {{rheumatoid}} arthritis SIR, We were interested {{to read the}} comparative study of phenytoin and gold in {{rheumatoid arthritis}} (RA) by Richards et al, ' prompted {{by the work of}} Macfarlane et al, who had shown improvements in clinical and laboratory tests and suggested that phenytoin may, therefore, have properties of a second line drug. 2 Richards et al found phenytoin to have significant beneficial effects on haemo-globin and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate but on only one of four clinical measurements. We have also studied phenytoin in RA, 3 but without knowledge of <b>other</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> <b>progress.</b> Our interest was stimulated by several properties of phenytoin, including inhibition of collagenase and stimulation of collagen synthesis 4 5; there appeared to be possible implications with respect to prevention and reversal of rheumatoid bone loss. In an open study with follow up after drug withdrawal we found significant improvements in clinical measurements over 32 weeks; serum C reactive protein, plasma viscosity, and haemoglobin also improved, but changes were not significant. Three independent studies have, therefore, shown slightly divergent although positive results with phenytoin in RA. Richards et al commented that phenytoin may be unique among second line drugs in having a greater effect on laboratory than on clinical tests, though Macfarlane et al and we showed significant clinical improvement, albeit in open studies. Confirmation of a positive effect of phenytoin on the erythrocyte sedimentation rate is, how-ever, of particular interest because its control within the normal range may reduce the rate of bone erosion. 6 7 The most appropriate assessment of phenytoin in RA may be by its long term effects on bone assessed radiographically and to our knowledge this has not been examined.

40|$|Validation of {{material}} models {{in a variety}} of scientific and technological applications requires accurate data regarding the high-pressure thermodynamic and mechanical properties. Traditional laboratory techniques for striking these measurements involve light gas guns to generate the required thermodynamic states, and the use of high-resolution time-resolved diagnostics to measure the desired material properties. EOS and constitutive material properties of importance to modeling needs include high-pressure Hugoniot curves and off-Hugoniot properties, such as. material strength and isentropic compression and decompression [1]. Conventional light gas guns are limited to impact pressures of about 7 Mbar in high-impedance materials. Pulsed radiation sources, such as high-intensity lasers, and pulsed power techniques significantly extend the accessible pressures and are becoming accepted methods for meeting the needs {{of material}} models in regimes inaccessible by gas guns. A present limitation of these new approaches is that samples must necessarily be small, typically a few tens of microns in thickness, which severely limits the accuracy of EOS measurements that can be made and also the ability to perform a variety of off-Hugoniot measurements. However, recent advances in z-pinch techniques for high-pressure material response studies provide potential opportunities for achieving accuracies comparable with gas guns because of the significantly larger samples that can be studied. Sample thicknesses approaching 1 mm may be possible with advances presently being made. These sample dimensions are comparable with gas gun sample dimensions so that accuracies should be comparable. The Sandia Z accelerator [2] is a recently developed facility that generates x-ray energies of about 2 MJ over time scales of 5 - 10 ns with resulting temperatures of 100 - 150 eV in containment fixtures, referred to as hohlraums, that are a few cubic centimeters in volume. This intense radiation source can be used to ablatively drive shock waves to about pressures of about 10 Mbar {{in a variety of}} materials. Because of the large source. In this paper, we discuss recent developments {{in the use of the}} Sandia Z accelerator for Hugoniot and off-Hugoniot measurements. Preliminary data on high-pressure dynamic response include Hugoniot EOS data on aluminum to about 5 Mbar using the z-pinch technique and isentropic compression data on iron and copper to about 300 and 130 kbar, respectively, using the direct current mode on Z. The isentropic compression experiments are performed on sample thicknesses to 0. 8 mm and allow determination of the cx-s phase transition and the kinetic properties of this transition. Specifically, isentropic compression data on iron have been analyzed with a two-phase rate dependent model of the bcc-hcp phase transition, which shows that the relatively slow rates of pressure application achieved with this technique result in observable kinetic effects that can be easily analyzed. <b>Other</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> <b>progress</b> with the Z Accelerator includes EOS studies of liquid deutenum and the development of uniform, constant pressure drives that will provide higher accuracy in EOS measurements...|$|E
40|$|This project {{commenced}} {{from the}} concept {{that some of the}} wide variety of signal processing techniques developed in radar and sonar systems should be capable of useful application in the field of materials inspection. The particular aim was to assess the possibilities of an imaging arrangement and with this objective the author's main topic was defined as the signal processing section of an overall system. Inevitably perhaps, a multiplicity of practical difficulties associated largely with transducers and the actual handling of the signals before the imaging operations, diverted {{the main part of the}} effort away from the original topic into these other problems. The thesis itself is organised into four main sections. Section I, containing Chapters 1 and 2, is by way of an introduction to the topic, discussing in particular the pattern of development followed and surveying the work reported in acoustic holography. Section II, consisting of Chapters 3 through to 7, contains a theoretical analysis of the general problem of reconstruction of fields from measurements taken at some surface (Chapter 5) and of many details relating to specific portions of the complete imaging arrangement. Section III, (Chapters 8, 9 and 10) is a brief description of the particular solution synthesised in the present work to meet the practical requirements of an imaging system. The final section, Section IV, presents the experimental results obtained (Chapters 11 and 12) and a general summary of the whole project with suggestions for further development (Chapter 13). A number of appendices contain details of some pieces of apparatus, discuss a computer simulation of transducer behaviour and hold some lengthy mathematical expositions. Chapters 5 and 12 are the most important in the whole thesis. The theoretical development of field reconstruction from recordings of wideband, elastic wave signals as presented in Chapter 5 is based on well known mathematical techniques but as far as the author is aware these have not previously been fully applied to the situation treated here. Chapter 12 contains a record of many of the actual images obtained and discusses the correlation with theoretical predictions. Chapters 6 and 7 are important to the determination of potential performance of the scheme devised here and similarly Chapter 2 is significant as a record of previous work with which to compare the present results. During the period of this project the whole topic of ultrasonic imaging has gathered a rapidly increasing number of workers in many laboratories and a large number of results displaying images of considerably greater fidelity than any results obtained here, have been published. However, it is considered that the local effort offers much greater potential of a very high level of ultimate performance since the other methods so far reported are near the limits of their capabilities whereas the developments described in this thesis are capable of improvement in nearly every significant aspect by direct extension of the techniques already established by the work to date. The most significant of these is considered to be the extension into wideband imaging, a capability already incorporated in the special apparatus constructed but one which could not be fully exploited because of present computer limitations. As far as is known, no <b>other</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> <b>progress</b> offers this possibility...|$|E

40|$|How {{a regular}} group seminar and team {{projects}} can {{go beyond the}} limitations of the one to one tutorial, towards a richer experience of shared and simultaneous ‘voyages’ into film. Encouraging the students’ self-discipline over attendance, their time and generosity over giving advice and practical help, the tutor-practitioner here becomes the enabler for groups, around the table, on location and in front of the screen, to involve each other and teach themselves. It also makes more efficient use of actual tuition. Live Action film making seems a particularly suitable vehicle here, partly because it is so time taking, but also because it is instantly both practical and philosophical. However quite different disciplines can possibly relate to this approach where we make a virtue of numbers, promote cohesion and companionship. Debate and peer group contact over time then leads to a much deeper and increasingly more articulate individual grasp of the challenges and possibilities of the medium. Growing confidence in teams and groups in turn becomes a highly transferable skill for graduates, irrespective of whether they finally enter the media or not. A collaborative film project for mixed teams of Theater Design and Visual Communication BA students in their second year began in what was an otherwise highly individualistic environment. It has run ten years keeping continuity of teaching and structure. Many come to it quite new to film, thrown together for 8 weeks for the entire genesis and production of their short film, from initial group ideas through set design, acting, lighting, sound recording, shooting to fine cut. The key has been to engage the students’ own creative ‘engine’. Some competitiveness is positive too: 5 or 6 teams working to a set schedule create their own films keenly aware of other productions around them. Illustrated with short film extracts with a brief overview of the parameters, structure, logistics and philosophy.
