5|$|Gilbert Pinfold is an English novelist of repute {{who at the}} age of 50 {{can look}} back on a varied life that has {{included}} a dozen reasonably successful books, wide travel, and honourable service in the Second World War. His reputation secure, he lives quietly, on good but not close terms with his neighbours; his Roman Catholicism sets him slightly apart in the local community. He has a pronounced distaste for most aspects <b>of</b> <b>modern</b> <b>life,</b> and has of late become somewhat lazy, given to drinking more than he should. To counter the effects of his several aches and pains, Pinfold has taken to dosing himself with a powerful sedative of chloral and bromide. He conceals this practice from his doctor.|$|E

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of his career, Degas wanted to be a history painter, a calling for which he was well prepared by his rigorous academic training and close study of classic art. In his early thirties, he changed course, and by bringing the traditional methods of a history painter to bear on contemporary subject matter, he became a classical painter <b>of</b> <b>modern</b> <b>life.</b>|$|E

25|$|While the still-life and nude {{are common}} themes of pre-World War I Cubism, {{the work of}} Gleizes is {{characterized}} by ambitious subjects: the harvest, the hunt, the city, and, later, Broadway in New York City, and the Brooklyn Bridge (1915, Guggenheim, New York), {{one of his most}} abstract paintings of this period. Gleizes took this, according to Peter Brooke, as symbolic of the need to express the whole vast drama, the collection of unprecedented sensations <b>of</b> <b>modern</b> <b>life.</b>|$|E
25|$|Aimed {{at a large}} {{audience}} (the Salon des Indépendants, {{rather than}} a gallery setting), L'Oiseau bleu deliberately sets out to agitate and confront the standard expectation of art, {{in an attempt to}} implicated the viewer, to transfer beauty and elegance into a fresh cohesive dialogue that most accurately represents Modernism—one that is in tune with the intricacies <b>of</b> <b>modern</b> <b>life,</b> one that describes Cubism, his Cubism, whose order was only a phase in a continuous process of change.|$|E
25|$|It {{has also}} been {{suggested}} {{that in addition to}} summarizing interests that were lifelong for Homer, as well as referring to the works of previous artists, a modern and ironic meaning may have been intended as well: in 1908 air travel was a novel and transforming human achievement, one fraught with the adventure and danger of flight. Considering his worldly and pictorial intelligence, it is possible that Homer intended Right and Left as an oblique reference to this aspect <b>of</b> <b>modern</b> <b>life.</b>|$|E

25|$|Entering somebody's {{personal}} space is normally {{an indication of}} familiarity and sometimes intimacy. However, in modern society, especially in crowded urban communities, {{it can be difficult}} to maintain {{personal space}}, for example when in a crowded train, elevator or street. Many people find such physical proximity to be psychologically disturbing and uncomfortable, though it is accepted as a fact <b>of</b> <b>modern</b> <b>life.</b> In an impersonal, crowded situation, eye contact tends to be avoided. Even in a crowded place, preserving personal space is important, and intimate and sexual contact, such as frotteurism and groping, is unacceptable physical contact.|$|E
25|$|In 1955, Thor Heyerdahl asked Ferdon {{to go on}} an {{expedition}} to Easter Island as an archaeologist. Ferdon {{was only one of}} four archaeologists that went on the expedition. While in Eastern Polynesia, Ferdon studied the walking rituals and the details <b>of</b> <b>modern</b> <b>life</b> in Tahiti. Ferdon also took many photographs to document the expedition. He published many books and articles on his studies. Ferdon worked for the Arizona State Museum at the University of Arizona and retired in 1983, after serving as associate director. During his career as an anthropologist and archaeologist, he was also the director of the Museum of International Folk Art in Santa Fe.|$|E
25|$|A {{significant}} {{modification of}} Cubism between 1914 and 1916 was signaled by a shift towards {{a strong emphasis}} on large overlapping geometric planes and flat surface activity. This grouping of styles of painting and sculpture, especially significant between 1917 and 1920, was practiced by several artists; particularly those under contract with the art dealer and collector Léonce Rosenberg. The tightening of the compositions, the clarity and sense of order reflected in these works, led to its being referred to by the critic Maurice Raynal as 'crystal' Cubism. Considerations manifested by Cubists prior to the outset of World War I—such as the fourth dimension, dynamism <b>of</b> <b>modern</b> <b>life,</b> the occult, and Henri Bergson's concept of duration—had now been vacated, replaced by a purely formal frame of reference.|$|E

25|$|The Cryogenian {{period was}} {{followed}} by the Ediacaran period, which was characterized by a rapid development of new multicellular lifeforms. Whether there is a connection between the end of the severe ice ages and the increase in diversity of life is not clear, but it does not seem coincidental. The new forms of life, called Ediacara biota, were larger and more diverse than ever. Though the taxonomy of most Ediacaran life forms is unclear, some were ancestors of groups <b>of</b> <b>modern</b> <b>life.</b> Important developments were the origin of muscular and neural cells. None of the Ediacaran fossils had hard body parts like skeletons. These first appear after the boundary between the Proterozoic and Phanerozoic eons or Ediacaran and Cambrian periods.|$|E
25|$|La risata (1911, The Laugh) is {{considered}} his first truly Futurist work. He had fully parted with Divisionism, and now {{focused on the}} sensations derived from his observation <b>of</b> <b>modern</b> <b>life.</b> Its public reception was quite negative, compared unfavorably with Three Women, and it was defaced by a visitor, running his fingers through the still fresh paint. Subsequent criticism became more positive, with some considering the painting a response to Cubism. It was purchased by Albert Borchardt, a German collector who acquired 20 Futurist works exhibited in Berlin, including The Street Enters the House (1911) which depicts a woman on a balcony overlooking a busy street. Today the former also {{is owned by the}} Museum of Modern Art, and the latter by the Sprengel Museum in Hanover.|$|E
25|$|Raised in Leytonstone, East London {{and around}} Colchester, Essex, Albarn {{attended}} the Stanway School, {{where he met}} Graham Coxon and eventually formed Blur, whose debut album Leisure was released in 1991 to mixed reviews. After spending {{long periods of time}} touring the US, Albarn's songwriting became increasingly influenced by British bands from the 1960s. The result of these influences came in the form <b>of</b> <b>Modern</b> <b>Life</b> Is Rubbish (1993), Parklife (1994) and The Great Escape (1995). All three albums received critical acclaim while Blur gained mass popularity in the UK, aided by a Britpop rivalry with Oasis. Subsequent albums such as Blur (1997), 13 (1999), Think Tank (2003) and The Magic Whip (2015) contained influences from lo-fi, electronic and hip hop music.|$|E
