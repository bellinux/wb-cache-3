40|$|OBJECTIVES: This report {{measured}} {{the effect of}} births at 22 weeks' gestation <b>or</b> <b>earlier</b> on infant mortality in Philadelphia, Pa. METHODS: The proportion of live-born deliveries at 22 weeks <b>or</b> <b>earlier</b> was calculated. Overall and race-specific infant mortality was calculated after excluding live-born deliveries at 22 weeks' gestation <b>or</b> <b>earlier.</b> RESULTS: Of all deliveries, 1. 5 % were at 22 weeks <b>or</b> <b>earlier.</b> Of these, 68 % were stillborn and 32 % were live-born. Large hospital-to-hospital variation {{in the proportion of}} live-born deliveries at 22 weeks' gestation <b>or</b> <b>earlier</b> was noted. When nonviable births were excluded, overall infant mortality decreased 40 %. CONCLUSIONS: The development of a standardized birth certificate policy is needed and will facilitate comparisons of infant mortality across spatial boundaries and racial/ethnic groups...|$|R

5|$|In mid-July, {{the female}} Polish {{cochineal}} lays approximately 600-700 eggs, encased {{with a white}} waxy ootheca, in the ground. When the larvae hatch in late August <b>or</b> <b>early</b> September, they do not leave the egg case but remain inside {{until the end of}} winter. In late March <b>or</b> <b>early</b> April, the larvae emerge from the ground to feed for a short time on the low-growing leaves of the host plant before returning underground to feed on the plant's roots. At this point, the larvae undergo ecdysis, shedding their exoskeletons together with their legs and antennae, and they encyst by forming outer protective coatings (cysts) within the root tissues.|$|E
