5|$|A {{second major}} cause <b>of</b> <b>morbidity</b> <b>and</b> <b>mortality</b> in the North Atlantic right whale is {{entanglement}} in fishing gear. Right whales ingest plankton with wide-open mouths, risking entanglement in any rope or net fixed {{in the water}} column. Rope wraps around their upper jaws, flippers and tails. Some are able to escape, but others remain tangled. Whales can be successfully disentangled, if observed and aided. In July 1997, the U.S. NOAA introduced the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan, which seeks to minimize whale entanglement in fishing gear and record large whale sightings {{in an attempt to}} estimate numbers and distribution.|$|E

500|$|The {{timing of}} the arrival of {{smallpox}} in Europe and south-western Asia is less clear. Smallpox is not clearly described in either the Old or New Testaments of the Bible or {{in the literature of}} the Greeks or Romans. While some have identified the Plague of Athens—which was said to have originated in [...] "Ethiopia" [...] and Egypt—or the plague that lifted Carthage's 396 BC siege of Syracuse with smallpox, many scholars agree it is very unlikely such a serious disease as variola major would have escaped being described by Hippocrates if it had existed in the Mediterranean region during his lifetime. While the Antonine Plague that swept through the Roman Empire in AD 165180 may have been caused by smallpox, Saint Nicasius of Rheims became the patron saint of smallpox victims for having supposedly survived a bout in 450, and Saint Gregory of Tours recorded a similar outbreak in France and Italy in 580, the first use of the term variola; other historians speculate that Arab armies first carried smallpox from Africa into Southwestern Europe during the 7th and 8th centuries. In the 9th century the Persian physician, Rhazes, provided one of the most definitive descriptions [...] of smallpox and was the first to differentiate smallpox from measles and chickenpox in his Kitab fi al-jadari wa-al-hasbah (The Book of Smallpox and Measles). During the Middle Ages, smallpox made periodic incursions into Europe but did not become established there until the population increased and population movement became more active during the era of the Crusades. By the 16th century smallpox had become well established across most of Europe. With its introduction into populated areas in India, China and Europe, smallpox affected mainly children, with periodic epidemics that killed as many as 30 percent of those infected. The settled existence of smallpox in Europe was of particular historical importance, since successive waves of exploration and colonization by Europeans tended to spread the disease {{to other parts of the}} world. By the 16th century it had become an important cause <b>of</b> <b>morbidity</b> <b>and</b> <b>mortality</b> throughout much of the world.|$|E

40|$|To {{determine}} {{the frequency of}} postoperative (PO) hyperglycemia in non-diabetic patients underwent Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery and to evaluate its predictability for the outcome of these patients. Patients & Methods: The study included all patients assigned for CABG surgery and had no previous history of diabetes mellitus with preoperative fasting blood glucose of 180  mg/dl. Patients were categorized according RBG into: Normoglycemics had RBG < 180  mg/dl and Hyperglycemics had RBG < 180  mg/dl. Intraoperative data included frequency of CABG with beating heart and number of internal mammary artery graft used, aortic artery clamping, CPB and total operative times. Postoperative data included the frequency of hyperglycemic patients, occurrence <b>of</b> PO <b>morbidities</b> <b>and</b> <b>mortality.</b> All hyperglycemic patients received insulin infusion adjusted to achieve RBG level of 126 – 179  mg/dl. Results: All patients had significantly higher postoperative RBG levels compared to preoperative levels. Forty-three patients were hyperglycemic, while 57 patients were considered normoglycemic. Throughout ICU and hospital stay, 31 patients developed <b>morbidities</b> <b>and</b> 4 patients died with significantly higher frequency <b>of</b> additional <b>morbidities</b> <b>and</b> <b>mortalities</b> in hyperglycemic versus normoglycemic patients. There was positive significant correlation between the frequency <b>of</b> PO <b>morbidities</b> <b>and</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>and</b> extent <b>of</b> PO hyperglycemia, aortic clamping, CPB and total operative times. ROC curve and regression analyses showed that the extent of PO hyperglycemia, aortic clamping, CPB and total operative times are the significant predictors for <b>morbidities</b> <b>and</b> <b>mortalities.</b> Conclusion: PO hyperglycemia showed deleterious effects on outcome of CABG patients manifested as increased frequency <b>of</b> <b>morbidities</b> <b>and</b> <b>mortalities</b> during ICU <b>and</b> hospital stay {{and the extent of}} hyperglycemia could be considered as independent predictor of worsened outcome. The applied management policy allowed reduction of blood glucose levels without inducing hypoglycemia with subsequent improved outcome...|$|R

2500|$|Chronic rheumatic {{heart disease}} (RHD) is {{characterized}} by repeated inflammation with fibrinous repair.

It is caused by an autoimmune reaction to Group A β-hemolytic streptococci (GAS) that results in valvular damage. Fibrosis and scarring of valve leaflets, commissures and cusps leads to abnormalities that can result in valve stenosis or regurgitation. The inflammation caused by rheumatic fever, usually during childhood, {{is referred to as}} rheumatic valvulitis. About half of patients with rheumatic fever develop inflammation involving valvular endothelium. The majority <b>of</b> <b>morbidity</b> <b>and</b> <b>mortality</b> associated with rheumatic fever is caused by its destructive effects on cardiac valve tissue.
