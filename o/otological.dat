25|$|Subjective {{tinnitus}} is {{the most}} frequent type of tinnitus. It can have many possible causes, but most commonly it results from hearing loss. A frequent cause of subjective tinnitus is noise exposure that damages hair cells in the inner ear. Subjective tinnitus can only be heard by the affected person and is caused by <b>otological</b> and / or neurological conditions, including those triggered by infections or drugs.|$|E
25|$|Tinnitus is {{commonly}} {{thought of as}} a symptom of adulthood, and is often overlooked in children. Children with hearing loss have a high incidence of tinnitus, even though they do not express the condition or its effect on their lives. Children do not generally report tinnitus spontaneously and their complaints may not be taken seriously. Among those children who do complain of tinnitus, there is an increased likelihood of associated <b>otological</b> or neurological pathology such as migraine, juvenile Meniere’s disease or chronic suppurative otitis media. Its reported prevalence varies from 12% to 36% in children with normal hearing thresholds and up to 66% in children with a hearing loss and approximately 310% of children have been reported to be troubled by tinnitus.|$|E

50|$|The first formal {{proposal}} for a standardized, prescribed post-graduate period of medical education was made at the 1912 meeting of the Triological Society and published in the Laryngoscope in 1913.

The otolaryngology committee consisted of representatives from the Academy, the American Laryngological Association, the American <b>Otological</b> Society, the AMA Section on Otolaryngology, and the Triological Society.

5000|$|The most {{important}} factor in diagnosing a patient with vertiginous epilepsy is the subject’s detailed description of the episode. [...] However, due to the associated symptoms of the syndrome a subject may have difficulty remembering the specifics of the experience. This makes it difficult for a physician to confirm the diagnosis with absolute certainty. A questionnaire may be used to help patients, especially children, describe their symptoms. Clinicians may also consult family members for assistance in diagnosis, relying on their observations to help understand the episodes. [...] In addition to the description of the event, neurological, physical and hematologic examinations are completed to assist in diagnosis. For proper diagnosis, an <b>otological</b> exam (examination of the ear) should also be completed to rule out disorders of the inner ear, which could also be responsible for manifestations of vertigo. This may include an audiological assessment and vestibular function test. During diagnosis, history-taking is essential in determining possible causes of vertiginous epilepsy as well as tracking the progress of the disorder over time.|$|E
50|$|Returning to Vienna in 1861, Adam Politzer {{became a}} {{professor}} of otology at the University of Vienna {{with the support of}} von Oppolzer.

In 1864 Politzer was allowed by the government to treat indigent patients at the charity hospital {{as well as in the}} homes for elderly. He and Gruber received the title of professor extraordinarius in 1870 and were appointed to the rank of a joint directorship to a new clinic in the Vienna General Hospital, in the next year (the first of its kind in the world).

40|$|Introduction: Ear {{disease in}} {{children}} is a major public health concern in developing countries. In spite of availability of potent antibiotics, severe life threatening complications of ear diseases can occur. Objective: This study was done {{to find out the}} prevalence of different types of <b>otological</b> disease in school going children of Kathmandu valley. Method: This is prospective study among 1245 school children aged between 5 - 12 years in the time period of June 2007 - May 2008. Students were randomly selected from 4 different schools of Kathmandu valley. All these children were interviewed, examined otoscopically and findings were noted in the performa. Informed consent was taken from guardians to participate in this study. Statistical analysis was done using frequency and percentage. Results: Out of 1245 children, 64. 0 % were male and 36. 0 % female children. The most common <b>otological</b> diseases were wax (60. 6 %), followed by chronic suppurative otitis media (5. 7 %) and otitis media with effusion (3. 7 %).

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Middle ear {{disease is}} a {{frequent}} problem in young children with cleft palate (CP). Less is known about <b>otological</b> status in the adolescent CP population. The {{aim of this study}} is to provide an overview of current knowledge in the literature concerning the aetiology of middle ear disease in CP patients and the middle ear status of older children with CP, and to compare the situation in our centre to this background through an assessment of the <b>otological</b> status of patients in our CP population. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A literature review was conducted to summarise current knowledge about middle ear status in CP patients. A retrospective analysis was performed of the medical records of 20 CP patients between the ages of 10 and 15 who were treated and followed at the University Hospitals Leuven. The available <b>otological</b> data, otoscopic findings, information about hearing and surgery performed was collected for each patient when aged three and above ten years. RESULTS: Current knowledge indicates that middle ear function improves as CP patients get older. In our study, otoscopic appearance was acceptable in 63 % of ears of children aged over ten years of age. Otitis media with effusion (OME) was far less frequent above this age than around the age of 3, with a decrease from 50 % to 13 % of all ears. Above the age of 10, tympanic perforations were present in 13 % of ears and retraction of the tympanic membrane in 23 %. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a very high incidence of OME in young CP patients, the long-term <b>otological</b> prognosis is not necessarily sinister. A favourable natural evolution, diligent <b>otological</b> follow-up, early diagnosis and treatment of middle ear disease with the use of tympanostomy tubes are the likely contributors to the acceptable <b>otological</b> result in older CP patients. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} {{long-term}} audiological outcome and <b>otological</b> complications of nasopharyngeal carcinoma {{patients who have}} received intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) versus conventional two-dimensional radiotherapy (2 DRT).
