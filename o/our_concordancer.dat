Indeed, many translators confirm that an error on terminology has a major impact on their work. Thus, a revision phase is necessary to validate the initial translation proposed by the translator. This paper deals with the assisted terminological revision in specialized translation from English to French. We propose a new generation of bilingual con-cordancers that takes as input a term and its translation, and provides not parallel but aligned Knowledge-Rich Contexts from specialized comparable corpora. Both the manual evaluation and a real experiment with student revisers show that <b>our</b> <b>concordancer</b> actually assists revisers despite the difficulty of the task...|$|E

Also called KWIC – Key Word in Context tools, they are essential {{in the work of}} lexicographers, corpus linguists, and translators alike. We present an enhanced type of concordancer, which relies on a syntactic parser and on statistical association measures in order to detect those words in the context that are syntactically related to the sought word and are the most relevant for it, because together they may participate in multi-word expressions (MWEs). <b>Our</b> syntax-based <b>concordancer</b> highlights the MWEs in a corpus, groups them into syntactically-homogeneous classes (e. g., verb-object, adjective-noun), ranks MWEs according to the strength of association with the given word, and for each MWE occurrence displays the whole source sentence as a context. In addition, parallel sentence alignment and MWE translation techniques are used to display the translation of the source sentence in another language, and to automatically find a translation for the identified MWEs. The tool also offers functionalities for building a MWE database, and is available both off-line and online for a number languages (among which English, French, Spanish, Italian, German, Greek and Romanian).
