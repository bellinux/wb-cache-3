5|$|In 1848, {{acting on}} these {{feelings}} and perceptions, Stanton joined Mott, Mott's sister Martha Coffin Wright, Jane Hunt {{and a handful}} of other women in Seneca Falls. Together they organized the Seneca Falls Convention held in Seneca Falls on July 19 and 20. Over 300 people attended. Stanton drafted a Declaration of Sentiments, which she read at the convention. Modeled on the United States Declaration of Independence, Stanton's declaration proclaimed that men and women are created equal. She proposed, among other things, a then-controversial resolution demanding voting rights for women. The final resolutions, including female suffrage, were passed, in no small measure, because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>support</b> of Frederick Douglass, who attended and informally spoke at the convention.|$|E
5|$|Not {{long after}} Burn My Eyess release Machine Head started touring heavily {{in support of}} the album, opening for Slayer in Europe {{in the latter half of}} 1994, a tour which ended with their own {{headline}} show at the London Astoria. Following the success <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>support</b> tour the band returned to Europe for a headline tour in early 1995, performing in the same venues they opened for Slayer. The band would return to Europe for the summer festival season but Kontos refused to tour and the band drafted Walter Ryan for the festival dates. On the band's return to the US Kontos was fired because he was not keeping to touring commitments. Kontos went on to play drums with Testament, and was replaced by Dave McClain.|$|E
5|$|Samson was {{betrayed by}} his lover Delilah, who ordered a servant {{to cut his}} hair while he was {{sleeping}} and turned him over to his Philistine enemies, who gouged out his eyes and forced him to grind grain in a mill at Gaza. When the Philistines took Samson into their temple of Dagon, Samson asked to rest against one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>support</b> pillars; after being granted permission, he prayed to God and miraculously recovered his strength, allowing him to grasp hold of the columns and tear them down, killing himself and all the Philistines with him. In some Jewish traditions, Samson {{is believed to have}} been buried in Tel Tzora in Israel overlooking the Sorek valley.|$|E

Its pilot Porucnik (First Lieutenant) Milenko Milivojevic was killed. He claimed another Fury and a Breguet 19 destroyed on the ground, but he was only given credit for the first aircraft destroyed in aerial combat. The two Furys were in fact Avia BH-33 biplanes.|$|E

5|$|Between his {{election}} and his inauguration, Garfield was occupied with assembling a cabinet that would establish peace between Conkling's and Blaine's warring factions. Blaine's delegates had provided much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>support</b> for Garfield's nomination, and the Maine senator received {{the place of}} honor: Secretary of State. Blaine {{was not only the}} president's closest advisor, he was obsessed with knowing all {{that took place in the}} White House, and was even said to have spies posted there in his absence. Garfield nominated William Windom of Minnesota as Secretary of the Treasury, William H. Hunt of Louisiana as Secretary of the Navy, Robert Todd Lincoln as Secretary of War, and Samuel J. Kirkwood of Iowa as Secretary of the Interior. New York was represented by Thomas Lemuel James as Postmaster General. Garfield appointed Pennsylvania's Wayne MacVeagh, an adversary of Blaine's, as Attorney General. Blaine tried to sabotage the appointment by convincing Garfield to name an opponent of MacVeagh, William E. Chandler, as Solicitor General under MacVeagh. Only Chandler's rejection by the Senate forestalled MacVeagh's resignation over the matter.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, Morgan was {{promoted}} to brigadier and assumed command of the 1st Support Group of the 1st Armoured Division. When the 1st Support Group was shipped to France in May 1940, following {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War, it had already been stripped of its two field artillery regiments and two infantry battalions. As a result, Morgan's command included only a force of Royal Engineers and a Territorial Army (TA) battalion of the Royal Welch Fusiliers, which {{was in the process of}} converting to an anti-aircraft/anti-tank regiment and armed only with anti-tank guns. His group was in no position to fulfil its normal role supporting the division's armoured brigades and so was sent to reinforce the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division south of the river Somme. During a confused retreat most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Support</b> Group was captured along with the 51st Division at Saint-Valery-en-Caux but the remainder, including Morgan, got away and were evacuated to England.|$|E

On 13 September 2011, Warner Bros. Movie World began releasing cropped images of the ride's concept art.}}} On 17 September 2011, the final clues were released before the official announcement that evening. It was announced that the Green Lantern Coaster would feature the steepest drop in the Southern Hemisphere. Also on 17 September 2011, the DC Super Heroes Store opened adjacent to , Batwing Spaceshot and Green Lantern Coaster. By early October, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>support</b> structure and the lift hill were complete. By the end of October, the ride's construction was complete and work had begun on the entrance pathway. In early November, six trains arrived on site. Another was showcased by S Worldwide at the 2011 IAAPA Attractions Expo. Kevin Rohwer, an S Worldwide spokesman, stated that the ride would be ready on 15 December 2011. On 28 November 2011, testing began. The ride entered a soft opening phase on 16 December 2011, before its official opening on 23 December 2011.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} days of the campaign, Douglas finally began to receive some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>support</b> she had hoped for. Boddy's paper {{endorsed}} her, while Truman praised her. Douglas's actor husband, Melvyn Douglas, on tour with the play Two Blind Mice throughout the campaign, spoke out on behalf of his wife, as did movie stars Myrna Loy and Eddie Cantor. Nixon had several Hollywood personalities supporting him, including Howard Hughes, Cecil B. DeMille and John Wayne. Another actor, Ronald Reagan, was among Douglas's supporters, but when his girlfriend and future wife Nancy Davis took him to a pro-Nixon rally led by actress ZaSu Pitts, he was converted to Nixon's cause and led quiet fundraising for him. Douglas was apparently unaware of this—30years later she mentioned Reagan in her memoirs as someone who worked hard for her.|$|E
5|$|Like {{previous}} {{games in}} the Mana series, Legend of Mana displays an angled top-down perspective, in which the player characters navigate the terrain and fight off hostile creatures. The player controls the unnamed main character, and is assisted by up to two companions. One of these companions is an optional support character, which depends on what quest the player is performing, while another companion can be chosen by the player out of a roster of monsters, pets, and golems. Both companions are typically controlled by the game's AI, though a second player can take control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>support</b> character, or load in their own character from a different save file, if present. The main character and companions each have their own set of numerical attributes including hit points and strength, which represent the amount of damage the player can take or cause. These stats grow whenever the player advances a level, after gaining enough experience points from battle with enemies.|$|E

5|$|Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>support</b> that Zbor {{received}} in Serbia came {{from members of}} the urban middle class, as well as right-wing students and members of the armed forces. The majority of Zbor's members were ethnic Serbs, though some Croats and Slovenes also joined. Its membership fluctuated often, primarily due to disagreements over Ljotić's authoritarianism and his lack of popularity and political power in Serbia. Ljotić was an unpopular figure in Serbia due to his pro-German sympathies and religious fanaticism. The limited amount of support received by Zbor itself stemmed from the fact that radical right-wing sentiment was not strong amongst the Serbian population. The reason for this was that right-wing politics were associated with Germany. Being extremely anti-German, the majority of ethnic Serbs rejected fascist and Nazi ideas outright. Zbor never had more than 10,000 active members at any given time, with most of its support coming from Smederevo and from the ethnic German (Volksdeutsche) minority in Vojvodina that had been exposed to Nazi propaganda since 1933.|$|E
5|$|Renovations began almost {{immediately}} and involved {{the removal of}} all of the wooden track and modifications to some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>support</b> structure. On March 3, 2010, Six Flags Over Texas and Rocky Mountain Construction (RMC) unveiled the steel I-Box track which would be used on the refurbished ride. The track was developed over the course of three years by RMC owner Fred Grubb, and Ride Centerline, LLC engineers Alan Schilke and Dody Bachtar. The steel track was designed to be a replacement for any existing wooden track structure, with the rail shape, approximate weight, and dimensions remaining the same. Schilke designed the modifications to the layout, giving specifications to Grubb for manufacturing at RMC's Idaho plant. There, two-dimensional plates of steel were machine-welded to form the three-dimensional track parts. The redevelopment saw much of the track get reprofiled; the lift hill was increased by , the first drop was steepened to 79 degrees, and several overbanked turns (ranging from 90° to 115°) were added. The renovated ride, dubbed the New Texas Giant, reopened on April 4, 2011.|$|E
5|$|The AIF's major {{units were}} raised between 1939 and 1941. The 6th Division formed during October and November 1939 and {{embarked}} for the Middle East in early 1940 to complete its training and to receive modern equipment after the British Government assured the Australian Government that Japan did not pose an immediate threat. The division {{was intended to}} join the British Expeditionary Force in France when its preparations were complete, but this did not eventuate as Axis forces conquered France before the division was ready. A further three AIF infantry divisions (the 7th Division, 8th Division and 9th Division) were raised {{in the first half}} of 1940, as well as a corps headquarters (ICorps) and numerous support and service units. All of these divisions and the majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>support</b> units deployed overseas during 1940 and 1941. An AIF armoured division (the 1st Armoured Division) was also raised in early 1941 but never left Australia.|$|E

5|$|The ship {{also saw}} {{duty in the}} Baltic Sea, as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>support</b> force for the Battle of the Gulf of Riga in 1915. She {{returned}} to the Baltic as the core of an expeditionary force to aid the White Finns in the Finnish Civil War in 1918, but ran aground shortly after arriving in the area. Significant portions of her armor and all her main guns {{had to be removed}} before she could be refloated. The damage done by the grounding was deemed too severe to justify repairs and Rheinland was decommissioned {{to be used as a}} barracks ship for the remainder of the war. In 1919, following the scuttling of the German fleet in Scapa Flow, Rheinland was ceded to the Allies who, in turn, sold the vessel to ship-breakers in the Netherlands. The ship was eventually broken up for scrap metal starting in 1920. Her bell is on display at the Military History Museum of the Bundeswehr in Dresden.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally the Australian Army had {{relied on}} its major allies to provide {{logistic}} support, primarily raising combat units rather than support arms {{during times of}} conflict. Consequently, these services were relatively underdeveloped, and they remained so during {{the first years of}} the war. While British units provided many logistic and line of communication services for the AIF in North Africa during the early campaigns in 1940 and 1941, the Army needed to raise extensive support units to support its combat formations in the Pacific following the Japanese entry into the war. As a result, the growth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>support</b> arms and ancillary services proved dramatic, including many capabilities which the Australian Army had only minimal or no previous experience in maintaining. These units included terminal formations and beach groups responsible for loading and unloading ships, food and petroleum storage and distribution units and several farm units which grew food for troops in remote areas. In addition, with Australia's national support base located well to the rear, in the major cities in the south-east of the country, significant expansion of the Army's transport capabilities was required to move supplies and men to the field force based in northern Australia and New Guinea. Many road transport units were raised to move supplies around Australia, while the Royal Australian Engineers eventually operated a fleet of 1,900 watercraft and three air maintenance companies were formed to load supply aircraft.|$|E
5|$|While {{the saga}} records that Frakökk was killed to avenge {{the burning of}} Óláfr, {{recently}} scholars Angelo Forte, Richard Oram, and Frederick Pedersen, stated that her fate was actually sealed by her support of Erlendr Haraldsson's bid for the earldom, over the claim of Haraldr Maddaðarson. Haraldr {{was the son of}} Earl Maddaðr, and Margrét Hákonardóttir (married in about 1134). Margrét was a niece of Frakökk, and Earl Maddaðr was possibly a cousin of the David I. The union between Earl Maddaðr and Margrét benefited the Scottish Crown by increasing Scottish influence in the north at the expense of Norwegian influence. Also, in the 1120s and 1130s, David I had faced challenges to his authority. A large part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>support</b> for these challengers came from Moray and Ross—these lands were directly between the northern lands of Caithness and Orkney, and David's strength to the south. According to the Forte, Oram, and Pedersen, the prospect of having the son of one of his northern supporters as the earl of Caithness was too good for the king to pass up—especially since Haraldr was still a minor, and would thus be under the direction of an appointed tutor. As it turned out, the installation of Haraldr as an earl of Orkney and Caithness was a triumph for the Scottish Crown: in the 1140s, Sutherland and Caithness were further integrated into the kingdom, and the Norwegian influence in Orkney was neutralised.|$|E
