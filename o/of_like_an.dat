500|$|The one-take {{fight in}} [...] "New York's Finest" [...] in which Daredevil fights gang members down a {{staircase}} {{was described by}} Cox as [...] "kind <b>of</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> homage" [...] to the first season's well received one-take hallway fight scene, and [...] "almost like that scene on crack". Silvera noted {{that it is a}} metaphorical [...] "descent into Hell" [...] rather than a [...] "test of will" [...] like the first season's scene. The stunt team had three days to prepare the fight, and the final sequence was filmed in a day and a half. Unlike the first season's scene, which was shot on a set and used a camera mounted on a ceiling track, the stairwell sequence was filmed on location, and required the camera to be passed around multiple people to get the final shot. The season includes another homage to the hallway scene in [...] "Seven Minutes in Heaven", where the Punisher has his own hallway fight. Silvera noted that this [...] "full-blown", murdering Punisher was [...] "a strong contrast to Daredevil". For all the season's fights, the stunt team filmed a previsualization version using stunt doubles, with the actors, such as Cox, then shown this in sections on the day of filming, and allowed to make adjustments where necessary. Though the actors completed the majority of the fights, doubles were used for flips and major stunts.|$|E
500|$|Wolfgang Flür {{has stated}} Kraftwerk were {{influenced}} by {{the music of the}} Weimar Germany era: [...] "we were children who were born straight after World War Two ... we had no musical or pop culture of our own ... there was the war, and before the war we had only the German folk music. In the 1920s or 1930s melodies were developed and these became culture that we worked from". Karl Bartos also spoke of post-war influence as the group thought that they [...] "had this development in the 1920s which was very, very strong and was audio visual. We had the Bauhaus school before the war and then after the war we had tremendous people like Karlheinz Stockhausen and the development of the classical and the electronic classical. This was very strong and it all happened very close to Düsseldorf in Cologne and all the great composers at that time came there." [...] Paul Alessandrini is credited for helping contribute to the album's concept. Alessandrini told Hütter and Schneider that [...] "with the kind of music you do, which is kind <b>of</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> electronic blues, railway stations and trains are very important in your universe, you should do a song about the Trans Europe Express". Kraftwerk believed critics in the United Kingdom and the United States associated them with Nazi Germany, with tracks such as [...] "Autobahn" [...] inextricably linked with the Nazis who built the high-speed roads in the 1930s and 1940s. At the same time, the band were keen to move away from their German heritage towards a new sense of European identity and felt that the Trans Europ Express could be used to symbolize this. Allmusic referred to Trans-Europe Express as a concept album with two different themes. The first being the disparities between reality and image, represented by the songs [...] "Hall of Mirrors" [...] and [...] "Showroom Dummies", and the others about the glorification of Europe. Slant Magazine described the album as [...] "a sonic poem to Europe".|$|E

I am looking to create a space which mimics the studio environment – not only that – because I would be in the centre of the dancefloor so I can monitor everything around me and be at the same level – eye-level with the presumed dancer. This way it makes it easy for me to create the atmosphere and the rhythm suitable for the individual dancefloor. Kind <b>of</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> open kitchen in a restaurant – it’s an open kitchen in a club bringing the food to the people instantly – as soon as it’s produced it’s already on the dancefloor.

2500|$|The Miranda {{character}} receives {{negative comments}} to her videos from viewers who are {{fooled by the}} character and {{believe that they are}} watching a serious video by a bad entertainer.

You would never say that stuff to someone's face, but you can type anything online." [...] TheaterJones commented that [...] "perhaps because the Internet is some crazy postmodern distortion of reality, people ... felt it was their duty to point out how woefully untalented [...] was, in the most horrific ways. ... Her hate mail, which she reads some of on stage, is an art form all its own." [...] Ballinger noted: [...] "The whole reason Miranda went viral is because people were making fun of how stupid it was. If I didn't get hate mail, I wouldn't have a job." [...] The online critics were so harsh that Miranda became a [...] "hero of the anti-bullying movement". Her young fans find the character empowering because they see, perhaps selectively, [...] "a conservatively attired girl who does what she likes, gets lots of attention and has bottomless self-esteem." [...] Miranda also teaches that [...] "Popular girls don’t have to be stylish. ... Fear no one. ... It's [...] to be cranky." [...] An article at The Conversation observed that some YouTubers [...] "use humour and satire to challenge ideas of popular femininity. ... Miranda Sings... puts on monstrous makeup to perform parody music videos [...] being conventionally pretty." [...] Fans of the character who are studying the performing arts say that Miranda is [...] "a role model and a 'strong woman in comedy'" [...] that inspires confidence in their performance and social skills.|$|E
