40|$|We {{show that}} when health care {{providers}} have market power and engage in Cournot competition, a competitive upstream health insurance market results in <b>over-insurance</b> and over-priced health care. Even though consumers and firms anticipate the price interactions between these two markets – the price set in one market affects the demand expressed in the other – Pareto improvements are possible. The results suggest a beneficial role for Government intervention, either in the insurance or the health care market...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{the focus}} is on how {{excessive}} Directors ’ and Officers ’ Liability (D&O) insurance coverage is associated with risk-taking behavior in financial reporting. In the case of <b>over-insurance,</b> I hypothesize that the covered executive is overly buffered with regard to securities litigation recourse, which leads to aggressive accounting practices. Aggressive accounting is measured by the need to restate earnings. The findings show that unexpected D&O coverage results in aggressive financial reporting, which is more likely to lead to a restatement of earnings. In sum, this paper contributes to the existing literature on D&O insurance, and illustrates that, despite the fact that D&O coverage levels are unobservable to investors, the amount of D&O coverage underlies managerial decision-making...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} to analyse {{the choice of}} risk {{management}} activity made by a nonindustrial private forest owner who derives utility from consumption and from the sentimental value of the forest that bears a risk of disaster. We consider a bivariate utility function depending on consumption and sentimental value of forest. In this context, we analyse insurance and/or self-insurance decisions. We show that, under fair premium, full insurance is optimal only if the cross derivative of the utility function equals zero. Under-insurance and <b>over-insurance</b> may also be optimal depending on the sign of this cross derivative. We also show that, under a positive loading factor, optimal partial insurance is validated only if the cross derivative is positive; otherwise full insurance may be optimal even with a loading insurance. We also observe that risk aversion increases the level of insurance demand and self-insurance activity, extending this standard result obtained with an univariate utility function to a bivariate utility function. Moreover, when the forest owner can simultaneously insure and invest in self-insurance activity, full insurance is never optimal if the cross derivative is positive. Finally, we prove that insurance and self-insurance may be substitutes, and if preferences are separable and exhibit decreasing absolute risk aversion, then insurance and self-insurance are always considered as substitutes...|$|E
40|$|The {{growth in}} health care costs in the United States {{in the past two}} decades has been {{staggering}} and extraordinarily burdensome not only to the federal and state governments but also to employers and individuals who purchase their health insurance in the private market. According to a recent report by the Urban Institute Health Policy Center, four major and interrelated reasons are the significant drivers of the persistent rise {{in health care}} costs in excess of economic growth. The first is <b>over-insurance</b> due to the favorable tax treatment of employer-sponsored insurance to which approximately fifty-eight percent of non-elderly Americans have access. The second is 2 ̆ 2 the development and dispersion of medical technology. 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 7 The third reason is the 2 ̆ 2 increasing prevalence of chronic disease, 2 ̆ 2 which tends to be very expensive to treat and consumes a large share of health care costs. The fourth is the consolidation and market power of health care providers and insurers. As will be discussed, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2 ̆ 2 ACA 2 ̆ 2), enacted in March 2010 but not fully implemented until 2014, addresses some of these issues and attempts to mitigate their effects, but does so incompletely. According to many health policy experts, the ACA is limited in its efforts to contain health care spending, and either does not address certain issues at all or does so insufficiently...|$|E
40|$|Crop {{yield and}} revenue {{insurance}} products with coverage based on actual production history (APH) yields dominate the U. S. Federal Crop Insurance Program. The APH yield, which plays {{a critical role}} in determining the coverage offered to producers, is based on a small sample of historical yields for the insured unit. The properties of this yield measure are critical in determining the value of the insurance to producers. Sampling error in APH yields has the potential to lead to <b>over-insurance</b> in some years and under-insurance in other years. Premiums, which are in part determined by the ratio of the APH yield to the county reference yield, are also affected by variations in APH yields. Congress has enacted two measures, yield substitution and yield floors, that are intended to limit the degree to which sampling error can reduce the insurance guarantee and producer welfare. We examine the impact of sampling error and related policy provisions for Texas cotton, Kansas wheat, and Illinois corn. The analysis is conducted using county level yield data from the National Agricultural Statistics Service and individual insured-unit-level yield data obtained from the Risk Management Agency’s insurance database. Our findings indicate that sampling error in APH yields has the potential to reduce producer welfare and that the magnitude of this effect differs substantially across crops. The yield substitution and yield floor provisions reduce the negative impact of sampling error but also bias guarantees upward, leading to increased government cost of the insurance programs.
