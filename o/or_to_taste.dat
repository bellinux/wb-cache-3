6000|$|It seems, then, {{necessary}} towards {{moving the}} passions of people advanced in life to any considerable degree, that the objects designed for that purpose, besides their being in some measure new, should be capable of exciting pain or pleasure from other causes. Pain and pleasure are simple ideas, incapable of definition. People are not liable to be mistaken in their feelings, {{but they are very}} frequently wrong in the names they give them, and in their reasonings about them. Many are of opinion, that pain arises necessarily from the removal of some pleasure; as they think pleasure does from the ceasing or diminution of some pain. For my part, I am rather inclined to imagine, that pain and pleasure, in their most simple and natural manner of affecting, are each of a positive nature, and by no means necessarily dependent on each other for their existence. The human mind is often, and I think it is for the most part, in a state neither of pain nor pleasure, which I call a state of indifference. When I am carried from this state into a state of actual pleasure, it does not appear necessary that I should pass through the medium of any sort of pain. If in such a state of indifference, or ease, or tranquillity, or call it what you please, you were to be suddenly entertained with a concert of music; or suppose some object of a fine shape, and bright, lively colors, to be presented before you; or imagine your smell is gratified with the fragrance of a rose; or if, without any previous thirst, you were to drink of some pleasant kind of wine, <b>or</b> <b>to</b> <b>taste</b> of some sweetmeat without being hungry; in all the several senses, of hearing, smelling, and tasting, you undoubtedly find a pleasure; yet, if I inquire into the state of your mind previous to these gratifications, you will hardly tell me that they found you in any kind of pain; or, having satisfied these several senses with their several pleasures, will you say that any pain has succeeded, though the pleasure is absolutely over? Suppose, on the other hand, a man in the same state of indifference to receive a violent blow, or to drink of some bitter potion, or to have his ears wounded with some harsh and grating sound; here is no removal of pleasure; and yet here is felt, his every sense which is affected, a pain very distinguishable. It may be said, perhaps, that the pain in these cases had its rise from the removal of the pleasure which the man enjoyed before, though that pleasure was of so low a degree as to be perceived only by the removal. But this seems to me a subtilty that is not discoverable in nature. For if, previous to the pain, I do not feel any actual pleasure, I have no reason to judge that any such thing exists; since pleasure is only pleasure as it is felt. The same may be said of pain, and with equal reason. I can never persuade myself that pleasure and pain are mere relations, which can only exist as they are contrasted; but I think I can discern clearly that there are positive pains and pleasures, which do not at all depend upon each other. Nothing is more certain to my own feelings than this. There is nothing which I can distinguish in my mind with more clearness than the three states, of indifference, of pleasure, and of pain. Every one of these I can perceive without any sort of idea of its relation to anything else. Caius is afflicted with a fit of the colic; this man is actually in pain; stretch Caius upon the rack, he will feel a much greater pain: but does this pain of the rack arise from the removal of any pleasure? or is the fit of the colic a pleasure or a pain just as we are pleased to consider it? ...|$|E

5000|$|Portable soup is {{generally}} held {{to have been}} invented by Mrs Dubois, a London tavern keeper who, with William Cookworthy, won a contract to manufacture it for the Royal Navy in 1756. It had, however, been described at a much earlier date. In the late sixteenth century, Sir Hugh Plat wrote, in his unpublished notes, of portable soup as a potential victual for the army and navy, describing it as meat broth boiled down to a thick and dry paste which he called [...] "Gelly". Plat's basic recipe was to boil the feet or legs of beef cattle {{for a long time}} to make [...] "a good broath" [...] which was then strained and boiled down to [...] "a strong & stiff gelly". This in turn was dried on clean cloths in a windy place out of the sun, cut with wire into pieces, powdered with flour to stop the pieces sticking, and stored in wooden boxes. Made in March, it would [...] "keepe all the yeere". Alternatively, the dry jelly could be [...] "stamped" [...] into shape with a wooden die, like the [...] "Genoa Paste" [...] of quinces familiar to Plat and other cooks of the time. He instructed that no sugar or salt should be added to the jelly because such taste would be concentrated by the boiling process, although he speculated that saffron might add colour, and that rosewater could also be added at this stage. He wondered whether baked flour or grated bread could be incorporated to make the jelly [...] "serve as bread and meate the better", and whether the addition of isinglass would make it stiffer. The jelly was variously described by Plat as a [...] "Victual for Warr", [...] "dry gelly carried to the sea", and a food for soldiers on the march. Plat envisaged using this jelly either as the base for soup, or [...] "neat" [...] as a concentrated food. Reconstitution as soup simply involved dissolving a piece of the jelly in hot water to make [...] "good broath", and, because jelly and water alone would be rather bland, adding such flavourings as were available <b>or</b> <b>to</b> <b>taste</b> - sugar, salt, liquorice, aniseed, or other [...] "convenient spice". Plat emphasised the utility of the jelly as field rations, for [...] "a soldier may satisfie his hunger herwith, whilst hee is in his march". He recommended that a leg of beef or veal be boiled with every 6 or 8 neats' (cows') feet to produce a jelly which would more easily dissolve in the mouth.|$|E

50|$|The {{most popular}} use of T. daniellii is as sweetener. The aril {{contains}} a non-toxic, intensely sweet protein named thaumatin, {{which is at}} least 3000 times as sweet as sucrose.

Since the mid-1990s, thaumatin is used as sweetener and flavour enhancer by the food and confectionery industry. Substituting synthetic sweeteners, it is used as a non-caloric natural sweetener.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine gender {{differences}} in the impact of a school garden and nutrition curriculum on fruit and vegetable intake, willingness <b>to</b> <b>taste,</b> and taste ratings in 127 children (11 to 12 years, 54 % boys) in regional New South Wales, Australia. Classes were assigned to wait-list control, nutrition education only (NE), or nutrition education plus garden (NE + G) groups. Carrot taste rating was the only vegetable for which there was a significant gender difference, with girls rating it more highly (p =. 04). There were no significant gender differences in fruit and vegetable consumption <b>or</b> willingness <b>to</b> <b>taste</b> scores for any other vegetables. There was a group effect (p <. 001) for overall willingness <b>to</b> <b>taste,</b> overall taste rating, and the taste rating of pea and broccoli (p <. 001), tomato (p =. 03), and lettuce (p =. 02). In the post hoc analysis by gender, both boys and girls in NE + G and NE groups were more willing <b>to</b> <b>taste</b> vegetables compared with control boys and girls postintervention (p <. 001, p =. 02). Boys in the NE + G group were more willing <b>to</b> <b>taste</b> all vegetables overall compared with NE boys at posttest (p =. 05) and this approached significance for girls (p =. 07). For overall tasting scores, a group effect was seen in girls only (p =. 05). No significant treatment-time effect was found for vegetable intake in either gender.
