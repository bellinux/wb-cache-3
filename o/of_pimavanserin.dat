40|$|A simple, {{rapid and}} {{sensitive}} method {{based on an}} ultra-performance liquid chromatographyâtandem mass spectrometry (UPLCâMS/MS) has been developed and validated for the determination <b>of</b> <b>pimavanserin</b> in rat plasma. The analyte was extracted by protein precipitation with methanol and separated on an ACQUITY BEH C 18 column (100 Ã 2. 1 Â mm, 1. 7 Â Âµm; Waters, USA), with an isocratic elution of acetonitrile-water containing 10 Â mM ammonium acetate (70 : 30, v/v), at a flow rate of 0. 2 Â mL/min for 2. 5 Â min. The analyte and clarithromycin (the internal standard) were detected and quantified in positive ion mode using multiple reaction monitoring transitions at m/z 428. 2 â 223. 0 for pimavanserin and m/z 748. 5 â 589. 5 for clarithromycin. Relative coefficient (r) for the calibration curve was more than 0. 9980. The intra-day and inter-day precisions (relative standard deviation, RSD%) were less than 13. 3 % and 10. 5 %, respectively, and the accuracy (relative error, RE%) was within Â± 11. 5 %. The analytical method was successfully applied to a routine pharmacokinetic study <b>of</b> <b>pimavanserin</b> in rats after oral administration at the dose of 10 Â mg/kg.

40|$|The {{nomenclature}} {{of drugs}} {{is a critical}} aspect of science, since it can direct research and optimize treatment choices. Traditionally drugs acting on CNS receptors have been classified as either agonists or antagonists. Recently {{a new class of}} ligand, the inverse agonist, has been identified in some receptor systems. Inverse agonists have opposite actions to those of agonists but the effects of both of these can be blocked by antagonists. Pimavanserin is a new 5 -HT 2 A receptor acting drug that has been given market authorization for psychosis in Parkinson׳s disease. The FDA have termed it an inverse agonist, but this conclusion is based on in-vitro data. In this paper we discuss the evidence for such a claim being made for pimavanserin in the human brain and conclude that this is not currently sufficient. It is therefore premature to conclude that the actions <b>of</b> <b>pimavanserin</b> in humans are due to inverse agonism, and we are of the opinion that it should be called a 5 -HT 2 A antagonist until better evidence emerges...|$|E
40|$|Psychotic {{symptoms}} {{occur in}} up to 40 % of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Clozapine and quetiapine, two atypical antipsychotic drugs, at doses markedly lower than those effective in schizophrenia, which, nevertheless, still cause sedation, hypotension, and other side effects, are widely used to treat psychotic symptoms in patients with PD psychosis (PDP), although quetiapine has never {{been shown to be}} effective in a placebo-controlled study. The demonstrated efficacy of clozapine in PDP has been attributed to serotonin (5 -HT 2 A) receptor blockade. We postulated that pimavanserin (ACP- 103), a highly selective 5 -HT 2 A inverse agonist, would attenuate psychosis in patients with PDP, but avoid motoric worsening and non-motoric side effects. In this double-blind, randomized multicenter 28 -day study, the tolerability and efficacy <b>of</b> <b>pimavanserin</b> was compared with placebo in 60 patients with -DOPA or dopamine (DA) agonist-induced PDP. Motor function was evaluated using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Parts II and III. Antipsychotic efficacy was evaluated using multiple measures from the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS) and a UPDRS Part I psychosis-relevant item. Pimavanserin did not differentiate from placebo with regard to motor impairment, sedation, hypotension, or other side effects. The principal measures of efficacy of antipsychotic response to pimavanserin, the SAPS total domain score, only showed a trend. However, the pimavanserin-treated patients showed significantly greater improvement in some but not all measures of psychosis, including SAPS global measures of hallucinations and delusions, persecutory delusions, and the UPDRS measure of delusions and hallucinations. Pimavanserin showed significantly greater improvement in psychosis in patients with PDP at a dose which did not impair motor function, or cause sedation or hypotension Thus, pimavanserin may represent a novel treatment for PDP. Furthermore, these results support the hypothesis that attenuation of psychosis secondary to DA receptor stimulation in PDP may be achieved through selective 5 -HT 2 A receptor antagonism...|$|E

The results of a clinical trial examining the efficacy, tolerability and safety <b>of</b> adjunctive <b>pimavanserin</b> to risperidone and haloperidol were published in November 2012, and {{the results showed that}} pimavanserin potentiated the antipsychotic effects of subtherapeutic doses of risperidone and improved the tolerability of haloperidol treatment by reducing the incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s {{disease is}} a {{progressive}} neurodegenerative disease involving the basal ganglia affecting dopamine-secreting nigrostriatal pathway. It is diagnosed clinically {{by the presence of}} any combination of: Bradykinesia, Resting Tremor, Rigidity, Gait instability. Psychosis occurs in 20 to 40 percent of drug-treated patients with PD, and visual hallucinations are the most common psychotic symptom. Parkinsonian Psychosis treatment (with neuroleptics/antipsychotics blocking Dopamine in the mesolimbic pathway) had been a clinical challenge because it risks exacerbation of motor symptomatology. On 4 / 29 / 16, FDA approved Pimavanserin, a 5 HT- 2 A inverse agonist, a novel antipsychotic, that addresses psychosis independently of the Dopamine pathways after successful completion of a phase 3 placebo-controlled trial. We report a case of Parkinsonian psychosis which responded well to Pimavanserin. Case Report 72 year old Caucasian female with a history of Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s; motor symptoms previously stable on Carbidopa-Levodopa (Sinemet) but developing visual hallucinations secondary to Sinemet and consequently being weaned off of it by outpatient neurologist in anticipation of being initiated on Pimavanserin. Admitted for acute agitation, mild paranoia and worsening visual hallucinations (VH) with dementia ongoing for the past year. During her inpatient stay, she was completely weaned off of Sinemet and was started on Pimavanserin 17 mg bid (well-tolerated). Target psychosis symptoms (paranoia and visual hallucinations) resolved secondary to 3 days <b>of</b> <b>Pimavanserin</b> at starting dose and motor symptoms did not deteriorate after 3 days of not being on any Sinemet and she was discharged. Discussion Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s Disease psychosis is the strongest predictor of nursing home placement as well as mortality. The psychosis is hypothesized to represent an imbalance between the dopamine and serotonin systems. Treatment in the past was more difficult secondary to limited pharmacological options. interestingly, Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s disease was treated primarily with dopaminergic agents to reduce motor symptoms but these agents often worsened the psychosis. Similarly, Psychosis was treated primarily with antipsychotic agents, which in turn, worsened the motor symptoms. Pimavanserin, a selective serotonin 5 HT 2 A inverse agonist, has potent actions on 5 HT 2 A without any dopaminergic activity/affinity. Conclusion: Due to these actions, Pimavanserin was able to significantly reduce psychotic symptoms in patients with moderate to severe Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s disease, achieve efficacy without worsening motor symptoms, achieve efficacy without significant safety concerns in our patient. Our patient tolerated this medication well, showed clinically meaningful improvement in psychotic symptoms, and reduced the caregiver burden on his family...|$|E
