5|$|Galactica departs {{the station}} and rises a chain lift hill. The ride's first drop dips to the right, before rising back up and flying through the ride's centrepiece theming element, a portal, which links to the ride's space theme. Followed by this, riders are turned from the prone {{position}} onto their backs. The coaster then performs a large upward left turn before twisting again, returning riders to the prone position. After exiting from the lie-to-fly element, Galactica passes underneath a small ravine before pitching up, into a tight turn over the plaza area. A 360 degrees inline twist is followed up {{by a series of}} straight flying, and several turns and dips in the track. The train then comes to a stop <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> run before returning to one of the station's two stations.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} to ride a bicycle with a buckled wheel if it has disk brakes, where {{it would not be}} possible with a rim brake because the buckled wheel would bind <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> pads.|$|E
25|$|The {{driver is}} {{responsible}} for {{checking to see if}} the representative box on the screen correctly identifies the parking space; if the space is large enough to park, the box will be green in color; if the box is incorrectly placed, or lined in red, using the arrow buttons moves the box until it turns green. Once the parking space is correctly identified, the driver presses OK and takes his/her hands off the steering wheel, while keeping the foot <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> pedal. When the driver slowly releases the brake, while keeping the foot <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> pedal, the car will then begin to back up and steer itself into the parking space.|$|E
50|$|BB 75004 went to Châlons-en-Champagne {{for tests}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>brakes,</b> and haulage tests, before {{travelling}} to Nevers for tests <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>brakes.</b> <b>The</b> process concluded <b>on</b> 21 November 2006 with BB 75006 undertaking shunting tests at Plouaret.

25|$|An Iraqi {{police report}} {{describes}} Salihee's car as stationed parallel against the curb following his death, and Salihee's brother {{states that the}} car's transmission was in neutral, and Salihee's foot <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>brake,</b> when he arrived. Salihee lost a number of fingers on his right hand, suggesting according to Robertson that he was shot with his hands raised.|$|E
25|$|On October 7, 2010, {{the launch}} system failed to power a train {{over the first}} hill, letting it roll back into the station and collide with another, causing minor {{injuries}} to ten people. An investigation discovered that paint <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> fins had impaired the braking system. The investigation also revealed that Knott's had no testing procedure for a failed launch and roll back.|$|E
25|$|Simulation testing {{determined}} that pilot error {{was the cause}} as a braking force {{was found to have}} been applied by the chief pilot during takeoff. Using data from the flight recorder, it was determined the movement was only possible by pushing down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> pedals from the chief pilot's seat to push upwards on the control column. The investigating committee found evidence of the braking failure in the braking system.|$|E

25|$|Investigators {{found out}} that when {{pressures}} {{were added to the}} brakes, then there would be an increase in drag force and temperature on the assembly. Examination <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> assembly of Flight 420 revealed that at the time, the brake assembly's temperature were exposed to a temperature of more than 600 degree Celsius, which may indicated that there was a significant amount of drag force {{at the time of the}} crash.|$|E
25|$|The rotor {{is usually}} made of cast iron, but may {{in some cases}} be made of {{composites}} such as reinforced carbon–carbon or ceramic matrix composites. This {{is connected to the}} wheel and/or the axle. To retard the wheel, friction material in the form of brake pads, mounted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> caliper, is forced mechanically, hydraulically, pneumatically, or electromagnetically against both sides of the rotor. Friction causes the rotor and attached wheel to slow or stop.|$|E
25|$|In July 2016, after {{discovering}} that Warren might know about Patrick's {{body in the}} wall, Nancy, along with Darren move Patrick's body into the woods. In August 2016, Darren and Nancy try {{to get rid of}} Warren but are almost caught out by DS Armstrong. Nancy shouts at Darren for being so stupid with the plan but in the process, accidentally runs over her friend, John Paul McQueen, making him blind. Nancy later reveals that her leg froze and she couldn't step <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>brake,</b> leaving her terrified. In September 2016, Nancy is interviewed over the murder of Patrick, but when she arrives at the school, her leg starts to spasm and she freezes, breaking down in tears, with Louis taking her to the hospital. In January 2017, she is diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis.|$|E

30|$|When driving {{over the}} speed limit, {{a longer time}} is {{required}} for <b>braking,</b> and <b>the</b> probability of <b>brakes</b> locking increases. Driving over the speed limit and its effect <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>brakes</b> have increased this type of crash probability.|$|R

25|$|Parasympathetic {{stimulation}} originates {{from the}} cardioinhibitory region with impulses traveling via the vagus nerve (cranial nerve X). The vagus nerve sends branches {{to both the}} SA and AV nodes, and to portions of both the atria and ventricles. Parasympathetic stimulation releases the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) at the neuromuscular junction. ACh slows HR by opening chemical- or ligand-gated potassium ion channels to slow the rate of spontaneous depolarization, which extends repolarization and increases the time before the next spontaneous depolarization occurs. Without any nervous stimulation, the SA node would establish a sinus rhythm of approximately 100 bpm. Since resting rates are considerably less than this, it becomes evident that parasympathetic stimulation normally slows HR. This is similar to an individual driving a car with one foot <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> pedal. To speed up, one need merely remove one’s foot from the brake and let the engine increase speed. In {{the case of the}} heart, decreasing parasympathetic stimulation decreases the release of ACh, which allows HR to increase up to approximately 100 bpm. Any increases beyond this rate would require sympathetic stimulation.|$|E
25|$|Investigators later {{discovered}} that the recovered accident rudder PCU was much more sensitive to bench-tests than other new PCU's. The exact mechanism of the failure involved the servo valve, which remains dormant and cold {{for much of the}} flight at high altitude, seizing after being injected with hot hydraulic fluid that has been in continuous action throughout the plane. This specific condition occurred in fewer than 1% of the lab tests, but explained the rudder malfunction that caused Flight 427 to crash. The jam left no trace of evidence after it occurred and a Boeing engineer later found that a jam under this controlled condition could also lead to the slide moving in the opposite direction than that commanded. In light of this, Boeing felt that the test results were not real-world and not applicable due to the extremes under which the valve was tested. Boeing stated that the rudder reversal was more likely psychological, likening it to examples when a human panics and intends to step <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> during an automotive accident, but accidentally presses on the gas pedal instead while under duress. The FAA's official position was that there was not enough evidence for probable cause of rudder system failure.|$|E
500|$|As Mantis, {{the ride}} {{operated}} with two steel and fiberglass trains. Each train had eight cars with four seats {{in a single}} row supporting a total capacity of 32 riders. Mantis originally operated with three trains but the park later reduced operation to two trains due to the trains [...] "stacking" [...] <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> run. Riders were secured by an over-the-shoulder harness. Although Mantis was a stand-up roller coaster, {{there was a small}} bicycle seat riders could lean on.|$|E

50|$|Vacuum {{is often}} used to drive {{auxiliary}} systems <b>on</b> <b>the</b> vehicle. Vacuum-assist <b>brake</b> servos, for example, use atmospheric pressure pressing against the engine manifold vacuum to increase pressure <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>brakes.</b> Since braking is nearly always accompanied by the closing of the throttle and associated high manifold vacuum, this system is simple and almost foolproof. Vacuum tanks were installed on trailers to control their integrated braking systems.|$|R
500|$|Once riders {{are seated}} and restrained, {{the train is}} tilted {{backwards}} into a 'lay-down' position and dispatched. The train travels backwards out of the station, turns left and travels up the [...] lift hill at a 33 degree angle. Once the train reaches {{the top of the}} lift hill, it dips down into a twist (called a [...] "Lie-to-Fly") that turns the trains upside down into a flying position where riders face the ground. After the twist, the train travels down the first drop, reaching speeds of [...] Riders then proceed through an over banked Horseshoe Curve element, passing the queue area. Following the Horseshoe, the train enters a [...] "Fly-to-Lie" [...] element that turns riders back to a lay-down position. After the banked turn, the ride enters the [...] tall vertical loop, where riders experience 4.3 G's. The train then goes into another [...] "Lie-to-Fly" [...] element. Following the loop, riders enter another turn and hit two consecutive inline twists. Following the inline twists, the train enters the final helix followed by the final [...] "Fly-to-Lie" [...] element. Afterwards, the train is slowed to a stop <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> run before returning to the station.|$|E

2500|$|Adapters are {{available}} to allow the use of one type of lever with an otherwise incompatible type of rim brake. Some brake levers have adjustable leverage {{that can be made}} to work with either type of brake. Others vary their mechanical advantage as the lever moves to move the pad quickly at first, then provide more leverage once it contact the brake surface. Hydraulic brake levers move a piston in a fluid reservoir. [...] The mechanical advantage of the lever depends <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> system design.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{drum brake}} designs {{have at least}} one leading shoe, which gives a servo-effect. By contrast, a disc brake has no self-servo effect and its braking force is always {{proportional}} to the pressure placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> pad by the braking system via any brake servo, braking pedal, or lever. This tends to give the driver better [...] "feel" [...] and helps to avoid impending lockup. Drums are also prone to [...] "bell mouthing" [...] and trap worn lining material within the assembly, both causes of various braking problems.|$|E
