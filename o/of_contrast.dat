5|$|Hud premiered at the Venice International Film Festival, {{and was a}} {{critical}} and commercial success at its general release. It was nominated for seven Academy Awards, winning three; Patricia Neal won Best Actress, Melvyn Douglas won Best Supporting Actor and James Wong Howe the Academy Award for Best Black and White Cinematography. Howe's use <b>of</b> <b>contrast</b> to create space and his selection of black-and-white was favored by critics. In later reviews, the film received additional praise.|$|E
5|$|The Fifth Symphony has a non-customary structure, {{comprising}} two movements {{instead of}} the common three or four. Written in a modern musical language, it draws on the theme <b>of</b> <b>contrast</b> and opposition. The post-World War I composition is also described as having elements of war.|$|E
5|$|Carpentier’s {{historical}} {{account is}} greatly simplified {{in order to}} increase the contrast between the white land owners and their black slaves. The marvellous, one of the most notable features of the novel, is used as a marker <b>of</b> <b>contrast</b> between the two groups: firstly, because mention of the magical always takes the form of the slaves' point of view, while the more real interpretation of each event is from the whites' perspective; secondly, because the marvellous is used as a weapon to fight injustice. Instances of cruelty and violence between the groups are recounted grotesquely in great detail, which enhances the rivalry. More importantly, by allowing readers to see through the slaves' point of view, Carpentier brings to light the power and durability of the Haitian community and destabilizes the narrative of Western supremacy.|$|E
5000|$|János Kárpáti has {{discussed}} the structural aspects <b>of</b> <b>Contrasts</b> in detail. Szigeti recalled that Bartók {{had told him}} that the start <b>of</b> <b>Contrasts</b> had partial inspiration from the [...] "Blues" [...] second movement of Maurice Ravel's Sonata for Violin and Piano. F. Bónis has further noted the parallel between a short passage in the same Ravel movement and a passage in the first movement <b>of</b> <b>Contrasts.</b>|$|R

5|$|De Lucía {{was noted}} for his fast and fluent picados (fingerstyle runs). A master <b>of</b> <b>contrast,</b> he often {{juxtaposed}} picados and rasgueados (flamenco strumming) with more sensitive playing and {{was known for}} adding abstract chords and scale tones to his compositions with jazz influences. These innovations saw him {{play a key role}} in the development of traditional flamenco and the evolution of new flamenco and Latin jazz fusion from the 1970s. He received acclaim for his recordings with flamenco singer Camarón de la Isla in the 1970s, recording ten albums which are considered some of the most important and influential in flamenco history.|$|E
5|$|Manchester {{is a city}} <b>of</b> <b>contrast,</b> {{where some}} of the country's most {{deprived}} and most affluent neighbourhoods can be found. According to the 2010 Indices of Multiple Deprivation Manchester is the 4th most deprived local council in the England. Unemployment throughout 2012–13 averaged 11.9%, which was above the national average, but lower than some of the country's other comparable large cities. On the other hand, Greater Manchester is home to more multi-millionaires than anywhere outside London, with the City of Manchester taking up most of the tally. In 2013 Manchester was ranked 6th in the UK for quality of life, according to a rating of the UK's 12 largest cities.|$|E
5|$|Returning to a {{previous}} setting offered the artists new {{challenges and opportunities}} to expand {{the scope of the}} city. Having the player walk through the streets at night inspired a film noir ambiance. Color shifts and a high degree <b>of</b> <b>contrast</b> pushed the game's look beyond what previous Halo games had offered, but the team had to make sure that even dark portions of the city were playable. The entire core development team looked at commissioned concept paintings to decide how lighting schemes would affect the gameplay. The genre also influenced the character names and archetypes. The player character, for example, fits the concept of a lone, hardboiled detective. To increase the depth of the surroundings, Bungie added touches such as advertisements, trash collectors, and civilian versions of previously seen military hardware.|$|E
40|$|A {{quasi-experimental}} {{design to}} test the use <b>of</b> <b>contrasting</b> cases as an instructional tool to support science learning in a design-for-science classroom was conducted. Five eighth grade science sections from one teacher were assigned to one <b>of</b> two conditions, <b>Contrasting</b> Cases (N= 54 students) or Sequential Cases (N= 30 students). The influence <b>of</b> <b>contrasting</b> cases on domain-general science reasoning knowledge, domain-specific differentiated knowledge, and domain-specific content knowledge was investigated. The exposure to contrasting cases was effective only at increasing domain-general science reasoning. In addition, science reasoning {{was a significant predictor}} of content knowledge, but differentiated knowledge was not. Thus, the mediated effect <b>of</b> <b>contrasting</b> cases on content knowledge through reasoning knowledge, if it exists at all, was not strong enough to be observed in these data. Improvements to the implementation <b>of</b> <b>contrasting</b> cases in the unit, and in design-for-science curriculum in general, are considered...|$|R

5|$|Some {{proponents of}} Saussure's view of {{language}} have advocated a formal approach which studies language structure by identifying its basic elements {{and then by}} presenting a formal account of the rules according to which the elements combine in order to form words and sentences. The main proponent of such a theory is Noam Chomsky, the originator of the generative theory of grammar, who has defined language as the construction of sentences that can be generated using transformational grammars. Chomsky considers these rules to be an innate feature {{of the human mind}} and to constitute the rudiments of what language is. By way <b>of</b> <b>contrast,</b> such transformational grammars are also commonly used to provide formal definitions of language are commonly used in formal logic, in formal theories of grammar, and in applied computational linguistics. In the philosophy of language, the view of linguistic meaning as residing in the logical relations between propositions and reality was developed by philosophers such as Alfred Tarski, Bertrand Russell, and other formal logicians.|$|E
5|$|Using a {{technique}} pioneered on Back to the Future Part II, another {{shot with a}} different lighting scheme was filmed. By combining separate key light and fill light passes, optical effects could generate any amount <b>of</b> <b>contrast</b> they wanted without causing spillage. Because Paramount continued to add new shots to the busy schedule and tight budget, some elements were flipped for reuse, including the star fields and {{a shot of the}} Bird of Prey firing. Whenever possible, the ships were filmed from below to reinforce the nautical theme, with their movements intended to remind the audience of galleons or other large seafaring vessels.|$|E
