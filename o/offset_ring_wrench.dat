These controls are incorporated into exchange methods for clearing contracts. Three clearing methods are discussed: direct, ringing and complete. The incidence and operation of each are described. Direct-clearing systems feature bilateral contracts with terms specified by the counterparties to the contract. Exchanges relying on direct clearing system chiefly serve as mediators in trade disputes. Ringing is shown to facilitate contract offset by increasing the number of potential counterparties. Ringing settlements reduce counterparty credit risk by reducing the accumulation of dependencies as contracts are <b>offset.</b> <b>Ringing</b> settlements also lower the cost of maintaining open contract positions, chiefly by lowering the amount or required margin deposits.

50|$|In 1818 Crossmyloof was {{described}} as the most populous village in Cathcart parish. Although till recently 'remarkable chiefly for being a resort of vagrants', the writer was happy to report that the village had now become more respectable from {{an increase in the}} number of its inhabitants, who now amounted to around 500. The remarks were a little premature, because in November 1820 two members of a band of armed ruffians who robbed a house in Crossmyloof were hanged in front of the Jail in the Saltmarket. The attack took place at the home of Dr Robert Watt, the author of the four volume Bibliothica Britanica, who had died, allegedIy of overwork, the previous year. His terrified widow had a pistol held at her head and her gold <b>rings</b> <b>wrenched</b> off her fingers. She is reported as having hastily left Crossmyloof for the safety of a home in Hutchesontown. When the Rev James Smith wrote his account of Cathcart parish in 1840, he used the name Westfield for the village and gave the number of families as 124 and the total population as 587 persons. At this period the villagers were mostly cotton handloom weavers. The only remaining woollen weaver was William AIgie, assisted by his seven children, three of whom wove woollen cloth, and four of whom worked in cotton. Two elderly women, Mary Sinclair, a muslin flowerer, and Margaret Wotherspoon, a muslin tambourer, were probably the last of the skilled embroideresses in the village. There were also a few shopkeepers, a blacksmith, several brassfounders and tinsmiths and William Ferguson, a lithographic engraver.|$|R

It provides wide range of torque production, robust and lower life cycle cost relatively to other types of motor. However, with the constructional simplicity, cage-IM tradeoff control complexity. This is due to the coupling of field and armature where the rotor magnetization is depends on the stator part. The simplest way to drive cage-IM is by implementation of series resistor at the stator terminal. But this technique is not suitable for high power IM as the heat dissipated at the resistor will make the operation of IM less power efficient. The implementation of cycloconverter circuit offers other alternative but the circuit is quite complex and less efficient as the device will used power switches at active region instead of switch mode. On the other hand, Voltage Source Inverter (VSI) implementing S-PWM to provide adjustable power to the IM. S-PWM waveforms control the switching of the power switches bridge to create DC to AC conversion. In this research, the 3 -phase McMurray bridge topology is implemented. This 2 levels 3 legs topology is among the most commonly used in real application. An open loop IM drive implementing S-PWM VSI is simulated using SIMULINK. The results are comparatively analyzed through comparison with SV-PWM VSI to verify the system simulation model. Voltage and current at the stator terminal are measured and analyzed at transient and steady state to study the harmonics distortion as well as IM performance. The results shows that S-PWM VSI is capable to drive IM with 80. 23 % and 16. 86 % total harmonics distortion for voltage and current respectively. At transient state 265 % electromagnetic torque overshoot occurs and the system took 0. 2 s for setting time. This performance results are consistent for NEMA Class B IM. The S-PWM circuit is designed with the aid of SPICE software. A 3 -phase sinusoidal waves, a Centre-aligned triangle wave, 3 -phase S-PWM comparator modules are implemented with operational amplifier circuit configurations of specific ICs. The designed circuits are applied for real hardware implementation and the results are compared with the simulated results. DC <b>offset,</b> <b>ringing</b> noises, amplitude and frequency errors occur on the real hardware model which are not presented by the simulation results. These errors are managed by manual adjustment of the reference modulating wave (Vref), carrier signal (Vcarrier) though Rv adjustment knob and the amount of supplied voltage of the ICs (VCC, VEE). The isolation between control circuit module (S-PWM generator) and the high voltage side of the bridge is implemented using opto coupler ICs. For IM drives integration, IR 2130 bridge driver is used to provide deadtime to S-PWM wave pairs as well as interface the control circuit with the IGBTs module and IM. The developed S-PWM inverter module is capable to drive 0. 4 hp cage-IM at rated speed with better power utilization as compared to the conventional variable resistance implementation...|$|R

The central gas depletion {{has been attributed to}} a possible head-on collision 200 Myr ago, supported by the existence of an <b>offset</b> inner <b>ring</b> of warm dust. We present new IRAM 30 m radio telescope observations of the molecular gas in the central region, and the detection of CO and its isotopes $^{ 13 }$CO(2 - 1) and C$^{ 18 }$O(2 - 1), together with the dense gas tracers, HCN(1 - 0) and HCO+(1 - 0). A systematic study of the observed peak temperatures with non-LTE equilibrium simulations shows that the detected lines trace dense regions with n$_{H_ 2 }$ in the range 2. 5 $ 10 ^ 4 - 5. 6 10 ^ 5 $ cm$^{- 3 }$, while the gas is very clumpy with a beam filling factor of 0. 5 - 2 10 $^{- 2 }$. This is compatible with the dust mass derived from the far-infrared emission, assuming a dust-to-gas mass ratio of 0. 01 with a typical clump size of 2 pc. We also show that the gas is optically thin in all lines except for $^{ 12 }$CO(1 - 0) and $^{ 12 }$CO(2 - 1), CO lines are close to their thermal equilibrium condition at 17. 5 - 20 K, the molecular hydrogen density is larger than critical and HCN and HCO+ lines have a subthermal excitation temperature of 9 K with a density smaller than critical. The average $^{ 12 }$CO/$^{ 13 }$CO line ratio is high (~ 21), and close to the $^{ 12 }$CO/C$^{ 18 }$O ratio (~ 30) that was measured in the north-western region and estimated in the south-east stacking. The fact that the optically thin $^{ 13 }$CO and C$^{ 18 }$O lines have comparable intensities means that the secondary element $^{ 13 }$C is depleted with respect to the primary $^{ 12 }$C, as is expected just after a recent star formation. This suggests {{that there has been a}} recent starburst in the central region, supporting the head-on collision scenario. Comment: 25 pages, including 19 figures and 8 tables.

40|$|Radial and {{azimuthal}} features (such as disc <b>offsets</b> and eccentric <b>rings)</b> seen in {{high resolution}} images of debris discs, {{provide us with}} the unique opportunity of finding potential planetary companions which betray their presence by gravitationally sculpting such asymmetric features. The young debris disc around HD 115600, imaged recently by the Gemini Planet Imager, is such a disc with an eccentricity 0. 1 <e< 0. 2 and a projected offset from the star of 4 AU. Using our modified N-body code which incorporates radiation forces, we firstly aim to determine the orbit of a hidden planetary companion potentially responsible for shaping the disc. We run a suite of simulations covering {{a broad range of}} planetary parameters using a Monte Carlo Markov Chain sampling method and create synthetic images from which we extract the geometric disc parameters to be compared with the observed and model-derived quantities. We then repeat the study using a traditional grid to explore the planetary parameter space and aim secondly to compare the efficiency of both sampling methods. We find a planet of 7. 8 Jupiter mass orbiting at 30 AU with an eccentricity of e = 0. 2 to be the best fit to the observations of HD 115600. Technically, such planet has a contrast detectable by direct imaging, however the system's orientation does not favour such detection. In this study, at equal number of explored planetary configurations, the Monte Carlo Markov Chain not only converges faster but provides a better fit than a traditional grid.

40|$|Abstract. Modern {{turbomachinery}} applications require nowadays ever-growing rotational {{speeds and}} {{high degree of}} reliability. It then becomes natural to focus {{the attention of the}} research to contact-free bearings elements. Common alternatives focus on gas lubricated journal bearings or magnetic bearings. In the present paper both the technolo-gies are combined with the aim of developing a new kind of hybrid permanent magnetic- gas bearing. This new kind of machine element is intended to exploit the benefits of the two technologies while minimizing their drawbacks. The poor start-up and low speed operation performance of the gas bearing is balanced by the properties of the passive magnetic one. At high speeds the dynamic characteristics of the gas bearing are improved by <b>offsetting</b> the stator <b>ring</b> of the permanent magnetic bearing. Furthermore this design shows a kind of redundancy, which offers soft failure properties. In the present paper, a detailed mathematical modeling of the gas bearing based on the compressible form of the Reynolds equation is presented. Perturbation theory is applied in order to identify the dynamic char-acteristic of the bearing. Due to the simple design of the magnetic bearings elements- being concentric rings with radial magnetic orientation- analytical expressions for the calculation of the magnetic flux density and forces are employed, opposed to the main literature trend where finite element software is utilized at least for the calculation of the B-field. Numerical analysis shows how the rotor equilibrium position can be made independent on the rotational speed and applied load; it becomes function of the passive magnetic bearing offset. By adjusting the offset it is possi...|$|R
50|$|Patterns of seismic {{activity}} detected by paleoseismology {{suggest that the}} filling of Lake Cahuilla might have triggered stress changes that caused earthquakes along the San Andreas Fault and other faults when they were already close to rupture. Such lake-induced seismicity is known from reservoirs and referred to as induced seismicity. Alternatively, earthquakes could have caused course changes in the Colorado River that then caused the lake to flood or to dry up; paleoseismology in Coachella is consistent with this hypothesis. Some earthquakes such as the 1892 Laguna Salada earthquake caused large vertical displacements that could have triggered flooding. Conversely, tectonically driven uplift of the northern side of the Colorado River Delta tends to stabilize the present southward course of the river against diversions to the north.The San Andreas Fault has <b>offset</b> Indian stone <b>rings,</b> its path is buried by sediments from Lake Cahuilla. During the Pleistocene, this fault was relatively inactive compared to the Imperial Fault and the San Jacinto Fault. Other faults that crossed the shores of Lake Cahuilla are the Extra fault zone, which divides a northern more stable basin from a southern basin that underwent tectonic extension and slightly slower sedimentation, the Coyote Creek Fault (whose movement rate has been estimated from displacement of Lake Cahuilla sediments and probably accelerated {{during the time of}} Cahuilla's highstand), the Superstition Mountain Fault which extends from the Coyote Creek fault, the San Jacinto Fault which runs parallel to part of Cahuilla's western shore, was last active in 820-1280, 1280, 1440-1637 and 1440-1640 and whose fault trace could be buried beneath sediments from Lake Cahuilla, and the Elmore Ranch fault which displays evidence of after-lake activity in the Superstition Hills. Faults on the lake floor include the Brawley Seismic Zone, potentially the Cerro Prieto Fault, the Imperial Fault, and the Kane Springs Faults. The Imperial Fault may have ruptured together with a rupture of the San Andreas Fault during a highstand of Lake Cahuilla, and was last active during the 1940 Imperial Valley earthquake.|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} most {{complete}} atlas of nuclear rings to date. We include 113 rings found in 107 galaxies, six of which are elliptical galaxies, five are highly inclined disc galaxies, 18 are unbarred disc galaxies, and 78 are barred disc galaxies. Star-forming nuclear rings occur in 20 % of disc galaxies with types between T=- 3 and T= 7. We aim to explore possible relationships between the size and morphology of the rings and various galactic parameters. We produce colour index and structure maps, as well as Halpha and Paalpha continuum-subtracted images from HST archival data. We derive ellipticity profiles from H-band 2 MASS images in order to detect bars and find their metric parameters. We measure the non-axisymmetric torque parameter, Qg, and search for correlations between bar, ring metric parameters, and Qg. Our atlas of nuclear rings includes star-forming and dust rings. Nuclear rings span a range from a few tens of parsecs to a few kiloparsecs in radius. Star-forming nuclear rings {{can be found in}} a wide range of morphological types, from S 0 to Sd, with a peak in the distribution between Sab and Sb, and without strong preference for barred galaxies. Dust nuclear rings are found in elliptical and S 0 galaxies. For barred galaxies, the maximum radius that a nuclear ring can reach is a quarter of the bar radius. We found a nearly random distribution of PA <b>offsets</b> between nuclear <b>rings</b> and bars. There is some evidence that nuclear ring ellipticity is limited by bar ellipticity. We confirm that the maximum relative size of a star-forming nuclear ring is inversely proportional to the non-axisymmetric torque parameter, Qg, and that the origin of nuclear rings, even the ones in non-barred hosts, are closely linked to the existence of dynamical resonances.
