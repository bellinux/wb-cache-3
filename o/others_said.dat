5|$|John Surratt stood {{trial in}} Washington in 1867. Four {{residents}} of Elmira, New York, claimed {{they had seen}} him there between April 13 and 15; fifteen <b>others</b> <b>said</b> they either saw him, or someone who resembled him, in Washington (or traveling to or from Washington) {{on the day of}} the assassination. The jury could not reach a verdict and John Surratt was released.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{consistently}} highlighted its comedic achievement. Game Informer said it {{is frequently}} hilarious, ranking it among the best comedic games ever released. IGN praised The Stick of Truth for its witty and intelligent satire of the role-playing genre, while <b>others</b> <b>said</b> {{that as well as}} being consistently funny, the game was suitably boisterous, shocking, provocative, self-effacing, and fearless in its desire to offend. Many reviewers agreed that much of the content was more appealing to South Park fans; some jokes are lost on the uninitiated but <b>others</b> <b>said</b> that enough context was provided for most jokes to be funny regardless of players' familiarity with the source material. IGN said that it is the game South Park fans have always wanted, but some reviewers said that without the South Park license, the game's shallowness would be more obvious.|$|E
5|$|The balletomanes of Paris {{became very}} excited as the opening night of Giselle approached. News reports kept their {{interest}} alive. Some reports said that Grisi {{has had an}} accident whilst other reports indicated that the conductor was ill with a tumor. Still <b>others</b> <b>said</b> that the stage hands feared for their safety.|$|E

5|$|In September 2010, Volvo Cars and Vattenfall, a Swedish energy company, {{issued a}} report {{regarding}} {{the results of the}} first phase of the Volvo V70 Plug-in Hybrid demonstration program. Among other findings, before the trial drivers participating in the field testing were concerned about being a danger to pedestrians and cyclists due to the quietness of the electric-drive vehicle. After the test several of them change their opinion and said that this issue was less of a problem than expected. Nevertheless, some test drivers said they experienced incidents of not being noticed while <b>others</b> <b>said</b> they had taken extra care in their driving with regard to this issue.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1883, Steinitz took {{second place}} in the {{extremely}} strong London 1883 chess tournament behind Zukertort, who made a brilliant start, faded at the end but finished 3 points ahead. Steinitz finished 2½ points ahead of the third-placed competitor, Blackburne. Zukertort's victory again led some commentators to suggest that Zukertort should be regarded as the world chess champion, while <b>others</b> <b>said</b> the issue could only be resolved by a match between Steinitz and Zukertort.|$|E
5|$|Mardikh II's periods {{shared the}} same culture. the {{population}} of Ebla during Mardikh IIB1 is estimated to have numbered around 40,000 in the capital, and over 200,000 people in the entire kingdom. The Eblaites of Mardikh II were Semites, close to their North-Western Semitic neighbors, such as the Amorites. Giovanni Pettinato said the Eblaite language, {{one of the oldest}} attested Semitic languages, was a West Semitic language; Gelb and <b>others</b> <b>said</b> it was an East Semitic dialect closer to the Akkadian language. Academic consensus considers Eblaite an East-Semitic language which exhibits both West-Semitic and East-Semitic features.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Look here, {{none of your}} cheek,' was the shockingly feeble retort which alone {{occurred}} to him. The <b>other</b> <b>said</b> nothing. Harrison returned to the attack.|$|R

5|$|Obama {{advocated}} for her husband's policy priorities by promoting bills that support it. She hosted a White House reception for women's rights advocates {{in celebration of}} {{the enactment of the}} Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 Pay equity law. She supported the economic stimulus bill in visits to the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development and United States Department of Education. Some observers looked favorably upon her legislative activities, while <b>others</b> <b>said</b> that she should be less involved in politics. According to her representatives, she intended to visit all United States Cabinet-level agencies in order to get acquainted with Washington.|$|E
5|$|Between Bow Bridge and Channelsea Bridge {{there were}} three <b>others,</b> <b>said</b> in 1303 to have been built to fill the gaps caused by the cutting of mill streams through Maud's causeway, {{although}} {{there is evidence that}} the mills pre-dated the causeway. However, the mill owners took responsibility for the bridges, which crossed the mill streams for St Thomas's, Spileman's and Saynes mills. The last two were owned by the City of London, and the bridges were called Pegshole and St Michael's Bridges. An administrative mistake around 1814 resulted in the City of London taking responsibility for St Thomas's Bridge, but the miller did not complain as Pegshole bridge was smaller and therefore less costly to maintain. The names were eventually swapped, and all three were replaced by Groves Bridge in 1933, which crossed the widened Three Mills Wall River, the two branches of the Waterworks River having been combined into Three Mills Wall River, while Three Mills Wall Back River was filled in.|$|E
5|$|The airship had tumultuous {{times at}} the start. Professor A. W. Bernard of Nashville, Tennessee took claim to his {{invention}} in 1897. Myers sent telegrams to editors of newspapers {{in the month of}} May of that year explaining that he was the inventor of the world's first 'sky-cycle' airship in spite of what Bernard and <b>others</b> <b>said.</b> Myers explained to the newspapers that his invention had already been displayed in front of a group of people in New York City in August 1895. Myers showed to them that the basic principles of the controllable airship were already patented by him and his wife on May 26, 1885. He further explained that the only 'sky-cycle' patent ever issued to anybody was granted to him on April 20, 1897. Bernard was trying to stake claim that it was his invention and had really just made a duplicate of Myers' previous recorded patents.|$|E

5|$|Combat {{received}} a polarized response; critics alternately called the battles deep and satisfying or shallow and repetitive. Reviewers considered the combat mechanics to be simplistic while allowing for complex tactics, and <b>others</b> <b>said</b> that {{the requirement to}} actively defend against enemy attacks and enhance offense kept fights engaging. Others also praised the combat but considered the mechanics to be robust and elaborate, presenting a solid role-playing combat system concealed under the intentionally simplistic visuals. Some reviewers said {{that a lack of}} depth made combat gradually become repetitive; they said that even when combat is funny and engaging, {{by the end of the}} game the battles can become routine. Joystiq stated that defense was more interesting than offense because it relied on time-sensitive reactions to creative enemy attacks such as Al Gore giving a presentation. Destructoid said there are too few powers available for offense for the game to remain interesting for long. GameSpot found combat was too easy and lacking in challenge because of an abundance of supplement items such as health packs that were found more frequently than they were used, and powerful abilities that quickly subdued opponents. Others disagreed, stating that the variety offered in combat, such as character abilities, allies, weapons, armor, and upgrades, ensured it always felt fun. The effects of the enhancements were sometimes considered to be confusing, and typically relying on simply equipping the highest level item available. Joystiq said the special characters that can be summoned during battle were extreme in terms of power and entertainment value.|$|E
25|$|In 2015 the Chinese {{government}} {{reacted to}} these complaints and incidents by prescribing {{a set of}} standardized routines for all dancers to follow, claiming they would be culturally unifying and healthier. The move was met with widespread criticism. Some Chinese complained that it did nothing to address the noise issues; <b>others</b> <b>said</b> the dancers {{should be free to}} choose their own routines. The real problem, yet <b>others</b> <b>said,</b> was not only the lack of better places for the dancing but the lack of other social opportunities for the women. The government soon clarified that the routines it created and promoted were only meant to be healthy alternatives to existing ones and were not required.|$|E
25|$|Porteous {{was arrested}} the same {{afternoon}} {{and charged with}} murder. He was tried at the High Court of Justiciary on 5 July 1736, where a majority of witnesses testified that Porteous had personally fired into the crowd on 14 April, although sixteen <b>others</b> <b>said</b> they had not seen him do so.|$|E

25|$|After {{years of}} {{disappointment}} players and fans began to criticise Hafey's methods. Several leading players said Hafey over-trained the team, {{particularly in the}} lead-up to finals matches. <b>Others</b> <b>said</b> Hafey was too slow to respond when the team was going under. During the 1982 season, a record losing streak of nine games sealed Hafey's fate and he was sacked mid-season.|$|E
25|$|In 1498, {{there was}} a turning point when Girindrawardhana was deposed by his vice regent, Udara. After this coup, the war between Demak and Daha receded, with some sources saying Raden Patah, Sultan of Demak, left Majapahit alone as his father had done before, while <b>others</b> <b>said</b> Udara agreed to become a vassal of Demak, even marrying Raden Patah's {{youngest}} daughter.|$|E
25|$|In late 1852 {{one of his}} Chinese {{servants}} {{died after}} being accused of theft. Greenwell {{was arrested and charged}} with second degree murder. Asher B. Bates was prosecutor, William Little Lee judge, and a jury of British subjects was found for the trial in January 1853. Witnesses testified that Greenwell had beaten or whipped the man, but <b>others</b> <b>said</b> the man was already ill and that Greenwell treated his employees fairly.|$|E

25|$|Because White was {{a public}} figure of a noted African-American rights organization, he {{generated}} great public controversy shortly after his divorce by marrying Poppy Cannon, a divorced white South African woman, who was a magazine editor with connections in the emerging television industry. Many of his black colleagues and acquaintances were offended. Some claimed the leader {{had always wanted to}} be white; <b>others</b> <b>said</b> he had always been white.|$|E
25|$|On June 2, 1988, Rather {{hosted a}} CBS News special, The Wall Within. In it, he interviewed six former servicemen, {{each of whom}} said he had {{witnessed}} horrible acts in Vietnam. Two of the men {{said that they had}} killed civilians, and two <b>others</b> <b>said</b> that they had seen friends die. Each talked about the effects the war had upon their lives – including depression, unemployment, drug use and homelessness.|$|E
25|$|Eyewitness {{testimony}} {{conflicted with}} some of these events. Residents on the street and <b>others</b> <b>said</b> that the two tow truck operators examined the abandoned vehicle for several minutes before shots were fired, contradicting McMillan's testimony that he was fired upon almost immediately after exiting the cab of his truck. Some residents also said that an African American man approached the tow truck operators and argued with them briefly before departing.|$|E
