Hinde that he had visited the region in order that the people might see and know their superintendent; remarking, [...] "The {{shepherd}} ought to know the flock, and the flock the shepherd: they ought to know what man it is that governs them, and I have come nearly one hundred miles <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> to see them."

500|$|Reservoir Dogs was, {{according}} to Tarantino, influenced by Stanley Kubrick's The Killing. Tarantino said: [...] "I didn't go <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> to do a rip-off of The Killing, but I did {{think of it}} as my [...] "Killing," [...] my take on that kind of heist movie." [...] The film's plot was suggested by the 1952 film Kansas City Confidential. Additionally, Joseph H. Lewis's 1955 film The Big Combo and Sergio Corbucci's 1966 Spaghetti Western Django inspired the scene where a police officer is tortured in a chair. Tarantino has denied that he plagiarized with Reservoir Dogs and instead said that he does homages. Having the main characters named after colors (Mr. Pink, White, Brown, etc.) was first seen in the 1974 film The Taking of Pelham One Two Three. The film also contains key elements similar to those found in Ringo Lam's 1987 film City on Fire.|$|E
500|$|Similar {{to most of}} {{the songs}} from Light Years, [...] "Spinning Around" [...] is a [...] "string-laden" [...] dance-pop track with {{prominent}} influences from disco music. According to the sheet music of the song published by BMG Rights Management at Musicnotes.com, it is composed in the key of F minor and features a moderate tempo of 120 beats per minute. Minogue's vocal range spans from the low note of F3 to the high note of C5. Addressing the theme of reinvention, the lyrics declare that Minogue has changed and learned from her past mistakes; it contains lines like [...] "I'm spinning around/Move <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>way...</b> I'm not the same" [...] and [...] "Mistakes that I made have given me the strength to really believe." [...] In an analysis of the lyrics of the song, Pom Avoledo from Blogcritics wrote that Minogue demands attention in the chorus towards the changes in her personality and asserts that people appreciate them, in the line [...] "I know you're feelin me cause you like it like this." [...] The first verse deals with Minogue ridding herself of items and symbols from her past and starting afresh, evidenced in lines like [...] "Threw away my old clothes, got myself a better wardrobe." [...] The critic felt that in the second verse Minogue faces her mistakes and accepts herself as she is. The bridge of the song features the repetition of the hook [...] "You know you like it like this," [...] with Minogue's voice being vocoded. Chris True from AllMusic felt that through the lyrics, Minogue was admitting that releasing Impossible Princess in 1997 was not the best decision.|$|E

People may not always think big themselves, but they can still get very excited by those who do." [...] Trump advises budding business careerists to have an optimistic outlook. Trump writes, [...] "think positively and expect the best. My positive attitude has brought me a lot of luck." [...] He says those who seek out their passions in life will find financial success. He tells readers to devote two hours a day focusing on how to generate money. The book talks about the importance of concentration on the task at hand, writing, [...] "Focus is a tricky thing.
