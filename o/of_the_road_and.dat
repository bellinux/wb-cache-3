5|$|A {{secondary}} control input that the rider can make is to lean the upper torso {{relative to the}} bike. As mentioned above, the effectiveness of rider lean varies inversely with {{the mass of the}} bike. On heavy bikes, such as motorcycles, rider lean mostly alters the ground clearance requirements in a turn, improves the view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road,</b> <b>and</b> improves the bike system dynamics in a very low-frequency passive manner. In motorcycle racing, leaning the torso, moving the body, and projecting a knee {{to the inside of the}} turn relative to the bike can also cause an aerodynamic yawing moment that facilitates entering and rounding the turn.|$|E
5|$|After {{environmental}} {{studies on the}} White Slough, Caltrans widened and elevated that section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>and</b> converted it to a freeway. To accommodate bicycles and pedestrians, a cycleway was built along the eastbound side of the freeway. Finally, Caltrans completed the overpass which crossed SR 29, Broadway, and Mini Drive (bypassing Marine World Parkway, three traffic signaled intersections, and a railroad grade crossing). The project was completed {{in the summer of}} 2005, and fully open to traffic on August 20.|$|E

5|$|An {{alternative}} video surfaced {{online in}} late May 2010, explaining why Beyoncé's character was remembering her love {{interest in the}} original version. It begins {{with a view of}} the night sky and many trees, as Beyoncé drives a car and Ealy's character is chased by the police through a forest. As the video progresses, she parks her car on the side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>and</b> scenes from the original version are shown. Police dogs eventually catch Ealy's character and attack him savagely. An open bag reveals stolen money, which is dispersed by the wind. At the end of the video, in the forest, Beyoncé finds Ealy lying lifelessly on the ground.|$|E
5|$|At the {{opposite}} end, at Ysgwrfa, the final five locks before Glynneath have been severed by a realignment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>and</b> {{the construction of}} a culvert, but the road has carried a lot less traffic since the A465 bypass was opened, and could possibly be rerouted along its original course, where the bridge over the canal still exists. The Neath Canal Act has not been repealed, and so there is still a right of navigation along this section, which should ease the process of reinstating it. The terminus would then be near the Lamb and Flag public house, south of the final two locks, which are unlikely to be restored.|$|E
5|$|Nibali {{attacked}} {{again just}} after the summit and rode alone down the descent. Despite almost colliding with a race motorbike at one point, he used his strong descending skills to gain an advantage {{over the rest of}} the group. He used the whole width <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>and</b> coming very close to the crash barriers at various moments. Rosa, meanwhile, came {{to the head of the}} group in an attempt to slow the chase down. Nibali's lead at the foot of the descent was around 40 seconds.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of September 1, 3rd Battalion, 38th Infantry moved in an attack westward from the 23rd Regiment command post near Mosan-ni to open {{the road to the}} 1st Battalion. On {{the second day of the}} {{fighting}} at the pass, the relief force broke through the roadblock with the help of air strikes and artillery and tank fire. The advanced elements of the battalion joined 1st Battalion at 17:00 September 2. That evening, North Koreans strongly attacked the 3rd Battalion, 38th Infantry, on Hill 209 north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>and</b> opposite 1st Battalion, driving one company from its position.|$|E
5|$|Since opening, {{there have}} been reports {{relating}} to an increased number of road traffic incidents at Switch Island, the main terminus of the A5758 road. Some road users have noted that a lack of clear road markings and signage may be a contributing factor towards the traffic collisions, whilst Sefton Council noted that they continue to review the operation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>and</b> associated junctions. Following continued incidents at the junction with Switch Island, the council confirmed in July 2016 that it was in talks with Highways England and Merseyside Police with Bill Esterson, MP for Sefton Central, calling for changes to be considered to the road to improve safety.|$|E
5|$|Stretford Road {{was divided}} into two halves in 1969 by the {{construction}} of Princess Road. A footbridge was subsequently constructed, crossing Princess Road {{at the same place}} as the road previously ran. As part of the regeneration of the Hulme district, it was decided to construct a new bridge to rejoin the two sections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road,</b> <b>and</b> also to provide a local landmark.|$|E

5|$|After the Tour, Simpson rode criteriums around Europe until {{crashing}} {{in central}} France; {{he returned home}} to Paris and checked himself into a hospital. Following a week's bed-rest, he rode in the road world championships at the Sachsenring in East Germany. During the race Simpson stopped to adjust his shoes {{on the right side}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>and</b> was hit from behind by a car, sustaining a cut to his head which required five stitches. In the last of the classics, the Giro di Lombardia, he struggled, finishing eighty-fourth. Simpson had been in constant contact with Helen, who was now working in Stuttgart, Germany, meeting with her between races. They became engaged on Christmas Day, and originally planned to marry at the end of 1961, but in fact wed on 3 January 1961 in Doncaster, Yorkshire.|$|E
5|$|At 14:30 {{approximately}} 300 North Korean infantry {{came from}} the village of Tugok and concealed positions, striking B Company on Hill 125 just north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>and</b> east of Tugok. Two T-34 tanks surprised and knocked out the two leading Marine M26 Pershing tanks. Since the destroyed Pershing tanks blocked fields of fire, four others withdrew to better positions. Assault teams of B Company and the 1st Battalion with 3.5-inch rocket launchers rushed into action, took the tanks under fire, and destroyed both of them, as well as an armored personnel carrier following behind. The North Korean infantry attack was brutal and inflicted 25 casualties on B Company before reinforcements from A Company and supporting Army artillery and the Marine 81mm mortars helped repel it.|$|E

5|$|At the start, {{there were}} {{one or two}} daily round trips with steam locomotive-hauled trains. In {{the first year of}} operation, the line transported 18,500 passengers. The initial ticket price from Sandnes to Ålgård was NOK1.50, {{compared}} to NOK1 for a bus ticket. This was in part because NSB operated with a standard price based on the length of the line, and the line was longer than the corresponding roads. After a while NSB's board accepted that tickets be priced {{as if they were the}} length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road,</b> <b>and</b> the price was reduced to NOK1.10. Because of competition from truck drivers picking up random passengers for NOK0.75, the price was then reduced to NOK0.80 in 1927. The line made a profit during until the late 1940s, after which it started to operate with a deficit. In the financial year 1948–49, the line transported 79,700 passengers.|$|E
5|$|Dorset hosts {{a number}} of annual festivals, fairs and events {{including}} the Great Dorset Steam Fair near Blandford, {{one of the largest}} events of its kind in Europe, and the Bournemouth Air Festival, a free air show that attracted 1.3million visitors in 2009. The Spirit of the Seas is a maritime festival held in Weymouth and Portland. Launched in 2008, the festival features sporting activities, cultural events and local entertainers. The Dorset County Show, which was first held in 1841, is a celebration of Dorset's agriculture. The two-day event exhibits local produce and livestock and attracts some 55,000 people. Inside Out Dorset is an outdoor arts festival produced by Dorchester-based Activate Performing Arts that takes place every two years in rural and urban locations across Dorset.

5|$|During a lunchtime tryst in Phoenix, Arizona, a {{real estate}} {{secretary}} named Marion Crane discusses with her boyfriend, Sam Loomis, how they cannot afford to get married because of Sam's debts. After lunch, Marion returns to work, where a client drops off a $40,000 cash payment on a property. Her boss asks her to deposit {{the money in the}} bank, and she asks if she can take {{the rest of the afternoon}} off. Returning home, she begins to pack, deciding to steal the money and give it to Sam in Fairvale, California. She is seen by her boss on her way out of town, which makes her nervous. During the trip, she pulls over on the side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>and</b> falls asleep, only to be awakened by a state patrol officer. Suspicious about her nervous behavior, he notes her license plate number and follows her at a close distance. Hoping to shake his pursuit, Marion stops at an automobile dealership and trades in her Ford Mainline, with its Arizona license plates, for a Ford Custom 300 that has California tags.|$|E

5|$|Harland Sanders {{was born}} in 1890 and raised on a farm outside Henryville, Indiana (near Louisville, Kentucky). When Sanders was five years old, his father died, forcing his mother {{to work at a}} canning plant. This left Sanders, as the eldest son, to care for his two younger siblings. After he reached seven years of age, his mother taught him how to cook. After leaving the family home at the age of 13, Sanders passed through several professions, with mixed success. In 1930, he took over a Shell filling station on US Route 25 just outside North Corbin, Kentucky, a small town {{on the edge of the}} Appalachian Mountains. It was here that he first served to {{travelers}} the recipes that he had learned as a child: fried chicken and other dishes such as steaks and country ham. After four years of serving from his own dining room table, Sanders purchased the larger filling station on the other side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>and</b> expanded to six tables. By 1936, this had proven successful enough for Sanders to be given the honorary title of Kentucky colonel by Governor Ruby Laffoon. In 1937 he expanded his restaurant to 142 seats, and added a motel he purchased across the street, naming it Sanders Court & Café.|$|E
