As a solution, they seek the financial assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

In a subsequent test both A and B are presented in either context x or context y.

However, in the typical version of this task, object A has also been encountered less recently than object B at test. This is precisely the arrangement in tests of ‘relatively recency’ (RR), in which more remotely presented objects are explored more than objects experienced more recently. RR could contaminate performance <b>on</b> the <b>OIC</b> task, by enhancing the OIC effect when animals are tested in context y, and masking it when the test is in context x. This possibility was examined in two experiments, and evidence for superior performance in context y was obtained.

Although the mine locates in the heart of the desert, the mining operations for ore extraction either from the underground mine, or from the surface mining work, do have several environmental impacts that affect the human being, agriculture, and natural resources (groundwater and rare animals). Those impacts are occurring during loading, unloading, mining operations (development, extraction, supporting, ventilation, blasting) and washing ol the ore. Other environmental issues at the same area include the movement of sand dunes with ils impact <b>on</b> the <b>oic</b> transportation via the roads and railroads. The paper addresses the different issues and suggests a monitoring system based on remote sensing and GIS techniques for belter understanding of the environmental problems around the area. ...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, the {{existence}} of income convergence or income divergence is investigated <b>on</b> ten selected <b>OIC</b> (the Organisation of Islamic Conference) economies. The results are then linked {{to the degree of}} openness of the countries using globalization indices. In order to investigate {{the existence}} of either income convergence or divergence between selected Islamic countries, income differentials between selected OIC countries and the benchmark country are computed and a series of test is done. The tests include stationary linearity test using Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test for linear time-series and non-linear stationary test using Kapetanois et al. (KSS) tests for non-linear time series. The findings are that most of the countries experience income divergence except for three countries. By analyzing the degree of globalization in these economies, it is found that the results support the endogeneous theory and depending approach which predict that globalization is likely to cause income divergence (inequality) rather than convergence (equality) ...|$|R

However, Akron was unable to match Massillon's margin of victory over Canton. The East Ends defeated Canton 17-6, while Massillon defeated that same team 16-0. Akron felt compelled to play and beat Massillon and prove itself worthy of the state title. A game was scheduled and East Ends appeared to be in luck when several Massillon starters fell victim to injury. However, the Tigers replaced its injured stars by buying the roster of the Pittsburgh Stars, the champions of the 1902 National Football League.

40|$|In this thesis, I {{examine the}} role of {{religion}} in Nigerian government decision-making from 1980 to 2009, providing a clear and concise account of the ways in which selected Nigerian religious actors, such as the Christian Association of Nigeria and the Nigeria Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs interacted with government policy actors on two key policy issues: membership of the Organisation of Islam Conference (OIC; international policy) and the adoption of Sharia law (domestic policy). Demographically, Nigeria is equally divided between Christians and Muslims and religious belief is widespread and has no clear boundaries within the country's domestic politics and international relations. Religion and politics mix freely. playing significant roles in the individual's political and social relationships at all levels of society. Nigeria claims to have a secular constitution, but religion has become increasingly important in the public sphere and this thesis is primarily concerned with the political influence of religious actors in the Nigerian government decision-making process. Emphasis is put on investigating organizational access by religious interest groups to policy makers and their influence over policy outcome within the political process. If said groups and policymakers share religious allegiance, are these allegiances reflected in policy outcome? i. e. • when and how do specific religious actors seek to influence the political outcomes of government decision-making? The finding of this thesis suggests that religious groups have a significant role in government decision-making, especially in relation to the impact that superior Muslim religious actors have within the policy-making structure in Nigeria <b>on</b> both <b>OIC</b> policy, and <b>on</b> the three arms of government in Muslim-dominated Sharia states. This study argues that such influence probably enhanced and promoted favourable policy outcomes for religious interest groups, especially Muslim groups.
