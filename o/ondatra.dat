5|$|Mammals {{are rarely}} {{consumed}} by river otters, {{and are not}} a major dietary component. Mammals preyed upon by otters are characteristically small or are a type species found in riparian zones. The few occurrences of mammals found in the river otter's diet include: muskrats (<b>Ondatra</b> zibethicus); meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus); eastern cottontails (Sylvilagus floridanus); and snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus).|$|E
5|$|Bivalves {{developed}} at the shores of Lake Cahuilla. These include Anodonta californiensis and possibly Pisidium casertanum. Anodonta shells are sometimes found within their own tunnels. They were probably used by inhabitants as a food source or to make shell beads. Gastropods identified include Amnicola longinqua, Gyraulus parvus, Helisoma trivolvis, Physella ampullacea, Physella humerosa and Tryonia protea. These taxa were relatively abundant at {{the shores of the}} lake. Ostracods include Cypridopsis vidua, Cyprinotus torosa and Limnocythere ceriotuberosa. Sponges have been identified in fossil deposits as well. One mammal found in the lake was the muskrat, <b>Ondatra</b> zibethicus.|$|E
5000|$|Ribeiroia <b>ondatrae</b> {{mechanism}} of causing malformations is still unknown, but {{there seems to}} be evidence in which areas of the body it infects more. Studies show that when frogs or toads are affected with the R. <b>ondatrae</b> it seems that the most common spot for any deformity is on the hind limbs. But the amount of exposure to R. <b>ondatrae</b> cercariae seems to show where a deformity can occur. For instance a moderate amount of R. <b>ondatrae</b> can affect the forelimbs of amphibians but a heavy dose of the infection cannot affect these forelimbs and only cause deformities in hind limbs.|$|R
5000|$|An {{important}} factor to the R. <b>ondatrae</b> infections is {{the exposure to}} run off nutrients or eutrophication. Fertilizers have phosphate in it {{which is also a}} predictor of larval trematode abundance in amphibians. The herbicide atrazine has proven to weaken amphibian’s immune system which causes frogs to become more prone to R. <b>ondatrae</b> infections which causes predators such as birds to attack the multiple or missing limbed frogs. Since herbicides and pesticides affect the prevalence of R. <b>ondatrae</b> in frogs it increases mortality and pathology due to extra or missing limbs.|$|R

5|$|Mammalian prey {{includes}} rabbits, hares, ground squirrels, raccoons (Procyon lotor), muskrats (<b>Ondatra</b> zibethicus), beavers (Castor canadensis), {{and deer}} fawns. Newborn, dead, sickly or already injured mammals are often targeted. However, more formidable prey such as adult raccoons and subadult beavers are sometimes attacked. In the Chesapeake Bay area, bald eagles are reportedly the main natural predators of raccoons. Where available, seal colonies can provide much food. On Protection Island, Washington, they commonly feed on harbor seal (Phoca vitulina) afterbirths, still-borns and sickly seal pups. On San Juan Island in Washington, introduced European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), mainly those killed by auto accidents, comprise nearly 60% of the dietary intake of eagles. In landlocked areas of North America, wintering bald eagles may become habitual predators of medium-sized mammals {{that occur in}} colonies or local concentrations, such as prairie dogs (Cynomys) and jackrabbits (Lepus). Together with the golden eagle, bald eagles are occasionally accused of preying on livestock, especially sheep (Ovis aries). There {{are a handful of}} proven cases of lamb predation, some of specimens weighing up to , by bald eagles but they are much less likely to attack a healthy lamb than a golden eagle and both species prefer native, wild prey and are unlikely to cause any extensive detriment to human livelihoods. There is one case of a bald eagle killing and feeding on an adult, pregnant ewe (then joined in eating the kill by at least 3 other eagles), which, weighing on average over , is much larger than any other known prey taken by this species.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Widespread {{reports of}} malformed {{amphibians}} in North America have prompted {{investigations into the}} cause(s) and implications of the phenomenon. Recently, a trematode parasite (Ribeiroia <b>ondatrae)</b> was identified as the probable cause of hind-limb malformations in Pacific treefrogs (Hyla regilla) from California. We exposed a second anuran species, the western toad (Bufo boreas), to specific levels of R. <b>ondatrae</b> infection. In a dose-dependent manner, R. <b>ondatrae</b> infection induced high frequencies (40 – 85 %) of severe limb malformations in surviving toads. Survivorship declined significantly with increasing parasite exposure, falling to 42 % in the heaviest treatment. Larvae in control treatments exhibited normal development and low mortality levels. In contrast to previous experiments with R. <b>ondatrae</b> infection in treefrogs, cutaneous fusion was the predominant malformation among infected toads in all treatments. In-fection also caused polymely (extra limbs; fore and hind), ectromely (missing limbs), polydactyly (extra digits), {{and a variety of}} additional limb malformations. Taken together, these results demonstrate that (i) the teratogenic effects of R. <b>ondatrae</b> are not limited to treefrogs, (ii) the spectrum of R. ondatrae-induced malformations is not confined to the hind limbs, and (iii) the frequency and composition of malformations resulting from infection may vary among am-phibian species. Finally, we review historical reports of limb abnormalities in the genus Bufo and discuss established and proposed causative agents, with emphasis on trematode infection and predation.

5000|$|Ribeiroia <b>ondatrae</b> is a {{parasite}} in the genus Ribeiroia, class Trematoda, Phylum Platyhelminthes, {{believed to be}} responsible for many of the recent increases in amphibian limb malformations, particularly missing, malformed, and extra hind legs.|$|R
40|$|Although the {{importance}} of host-parasite interactions is increasingly recognized, few studies examine factors regulating how infection alters host behavior {{and the consequences of}} parasite-induced behavioral changes for predation risk. The present study assessed how infection by trematodes (parasitic flatworms) altered larval amphibian activity and whether these effects depended on trematode species, infection intensity, time post-infection, and/or host size. To examine the implications of these results for tadpole susceptibility to predation, we evaluated how infection by the most virulent trematode altered tadpole escape distance from a simulated predator. Of three trematodes (Echinostoma trivolvis, Ribeiroia <b>ondatrae</b> and Alaria), only R. <b>ondatrae</b> significantly reduced activity of Chorus frog tadpoles (Pseudacris regilla) one day after exposure to 40 cercariae (larval trematodes). Increased R. <b>ondatrae</b> exposure correlated with decreased host activity, especially in smaller hosts. Whether hosts were exposed to acute or chronic parasite infections influenced recovery time to normal activity. Hosts exposed to parasites in a one-time pulse returned to normal activity within five days post-infection, whereas those exposed to smaller doses of parasites daily maintained reduced activity levels for five days. Finally, infection by R. <b>ondatrae</b> reduced host escape distance from a simulated predator in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that trematode infection could increase predation susceptibility. These results show that significant components of host behavior, including activity levels and predator avoidance, are affected by parasite infection in a manner dependent on dose, parasite identity and host traits. This underscores the significant role of parasite infection in changing host behavior and consequently species interactions...|$|R

40|$|International audienceSpecies of Ribeiroia (Trematoda: Psilostomidae) {{are known}} to cause severe limb malformations and {{elevated}} mortality in amphibians. However, little is known regarding {{the number of species}} in this genus or its relation to other taxa. Species of Ribeiroia have historically been differentiated by slight differences among their larval stages. To better understand the systematics and biogeography of this genus and their potential relevance to the distribution of malformed amphibians, specimens identified as Ribeiroia were collected across much of the known range, including samples from 5 states in the United States (8 sites) and 2 islands in the Caribbean (Puerto Rico and Guadeloupe). A cercaria from East Africa identified as Cercaria lileta (Fain, 1953), with attributes suggestive of Ribeiroia (possibly R. congolensis), was also examined. The intertranscribed spacer region 2 (ITS- 2) of the ribosomal gene complex was sequenced and found to consist of 429 nucleotides (nt) for R. <b>ondatrae</b> (United States) and 427 nt for R. marini (Caribbean), with only 6 base differences noted between the 2 species. The ITS- 2 region of C. lileta (429 nt) aligned closely with those of the 2 other Ribeiroia species in a phylogenetic analysis that included related trematode genera. This evidence suggests that a third Ribeiroia species exists in tropical Africa. Variation in ITS- 2 within R. <b>ondatrae</b> was nonexistent among the 8 populations from North America. Our study further suggests that Ribeiroia spp. originally parasitized Biomphalaria sp., and that a host switch to a closely related snail, Helisoma sp., may have occurred in the lineage represented by R. <b>ondatrae.</b> However, relationships within the Echinostomatidae are not understood well enough to make any robust conclusions at this time...|$|R

2500|$|Nutria {{herbivory}} [...] "severely reduces overall wetland biomass and {{can lead}} to the conversion of wetland to open water. [...] " [...] Unlike other common disturbances in marshlands, such as fire and tropical storms, which are a once- or few-times-a-year occurrence, nutria feed year round, so their effects on the marsh are constant. Also, nutria are typically more destructive in the winter than in the growing season, due largely to the scarcity of above-ground vegetation; as nutria search for food, they dig up root networks and rhizomes for food. While nutria are the most common herbivores in Louisiana marshes, they are not the only ones. Feral hogs, also known as [...] wild boars (Sus scrofa), swamp rabbits (Sylvilagus aquaticus), and muskrats (<b>Ondatra</b> zibethicus) are less common, but feral hogs are increasing in number in Louisiana wetlands. On plots open to nutria herbivory, 40% less vegetation was found than in plots guarded against nutria by fences. This number may seem insignificant, and indeed herbivory alone is not a serious cause of land loss, but when herbivory was combined with an additional disturbance, such as fire, single vegetation removal, or double vegetation removal to simulate a tropical storm, the effect of the disturbances on the vegetation were greatly amplified. [...] " [...] Essentially, this means, as different factors were added together, the result was less overall vegetation. Adding fertilizer to open plots did not promote plant growth; instead, nutria fed more in the fertilized areas. Increasing fertilizer inputs in marshes only increases nutria biomass instead of the intended vegetation, therefore increasing nutrient input is not recommended.|$|E
2500|$|What all primary rodent prey species {{share is}} that they are either nocturnal or crepuscular and are often common to {{abundant}} in openings of woods and rocky environments. The reason Eurasian eagle-owls take rats, which associate rather closely with humans, much more regularly than they take house mice (Mus musculus) is not their larger size (many other rodents regularly taken by eagle-owls are as small or smaller than a house mouse) but the rat’s ability to flourish along the edges of crop fields, refuse dumps, roadsides and abandoned buildings and fields, whereas the mice are more closely tied to active human habitations. A single refuse dump can host several thousand rats and eagle-owl territories that include dumps can locally expect higher productivity due to the abundance of this food source. Squirrels are readily predated but, being diurnal, are largely unavailable to this and other owls. When they are captured, it is presumably around dawn or dusk from their tree hole, in species such as the widespread [...] red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris), or burrow entrance, in the case of ground squirrels, most regularly recorded as prey in Asia Minor and the Central Asia.

50|$|Ribeiroia <b>ondatrae</b> {{is widely}} {{distributed}} across the US, including records from 22 species in 37 states (Johnson and McKenzie 2008). Most records of Ribeiroia-associated malformations {{have been reported}} from California, Oregon, Washington, Montana, Minnesota, Wisconsin, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Less {{is known about the}} distribution of Ribeiroia in Canada and Central America. In amphibians, both the abundance of the parasite and the number of observations appear to correlate positively with major bird migratory flyways, with concentrations along the Pacific, Mississippi, and Atlantic flyways (Johnson et al. 2010). This observation suggests definitive (bird) host activity is an important determinant of parasite distribution at the continental scale, but this hypothesis has yet to be rigorously tested. Ribeiroia <b>ondatrae</b> is most often recovered from amphibians in lentic habitats, such as ponds, lakes, and wetlands, which support planorbid snails. Other species of Ribeiroia occur in the Caribbean and South America (R. marini and R. marini guadeloupensis) and in Africa (R. congolensis). However, whether these species infect amphibians or cause limb malformations has not been explored.|$|R

40|$|Predation and {{parasitism}} {{are each}} important ecological processes within communities and ecosystems. However, {{the interactions between}} predation and parasitism may have significant consequences for transmission dynamics and disease in host populations. Predators play multiple roles including changing host densities, behavior, and morphology {{that could lead to}} different disease outcomes. Furthermore, direct predation on parasites can potentially lead to reduction in disease risk to host populations. Here, I used a combination of mathematical modeling, small-scale laboratory studies, and a semi-realistic mesocosm experiment to characterize parasite transmission dynamics, provide a predictive framework for the role of direct predation on parasites, and evaluate the direct and indirect (trait-mediated interactions) effects of multiple predators on transmission and infection. My study system included the trematode parasite, Ribeiroia <b>ondatrae,</b> larval amphibian hosts, and a suite of invertebrate and vertebrate species that co-occur in nature. Using laboratory experiments and maximum likelihood approach, I characterized non-linear functions as the most accurate representation of transmission. These models capture the saturation of infection at high exposure levels and subsequent experiments with anesthetized hosts suggest that parasite behavior may be an underlying mechanism for nonlinear relationships. Next, I identified damselfly larvae and juvenile mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) as predators of R. <b>ondatrae</b> and California Newts (Taricha torosa) as alternative hosts. In transmission trials, both damselflies and newts reduced transmission by ~ 50 % through the independent mechanisms of consumption and infection. Additional experiments including a wider range of parasite species showed that predation on parasites is based on predator foraging mode (active vs. ambush) and body size, parasite size and light availability. In more realistic aquatic communities with multiple trophic levels, I found that the trait-mediated indirect effects of predators of parasites and predators of hosts, including reduced activity and morphological changes were associated with higher infection compared to communities with predators absent. My research demonstrates both the direct and trait-mediated roles of predation on disease dynamics and identifies direct predation on parasites as an important factor in transmission dynamics. Future research should evaluate patterns of predator diversity and abundance with the prevalence and pathology due to R. <b>ondatrae</b> in nature...|$|R
50|$|Bio{{diversity}} - Host {{species diversity}} and community structure {{have been suggested}} to influence disease dynamics through a hypothesis termed the ‘dilution effect’ (Ostfeld and Keesing 2000). For Ribeiroia <b>ondatrae,</b> host species differences in susceptibility can influence infection patterns in multi-species communities (Johnson et al. 2008, Johnson and Hartson 2009). As a result, more diverse larval amphibian communities that include species with differing susceptibilities can alter parasite infection success and the resulting pathology in sensitive host species. For instance, larval toads (a sensitive species) raised experimentally alongside larval gray treefrogs (a resistant species) exhibited 37% less infection and fewer malformations (Johnson et al. 2008).|$|R
