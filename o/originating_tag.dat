5000|$|<b>TAG</b> <b>originated</b> in {{investigations}} by Joshi and {{his students}} into the family of adjunction grammars (AG), the [...] "string grammar" [...] of Zellig Harris. AGs handle endocentric properties of language in a natural and effective way, but {{do not have a}} good characterization of exocentric constructions; the converse is true of rewrite grammars, or phrase-structure grammar (PSG). In 1969, Joshi introduced a family of grammars that exploits this complementarity by mixing the two types of rules. A few very simple rewrite rules suffice to generate the vocabulary of strings for adjunction rules. This family is distinct from the Chomsky-Schützenberger hierarchy but intersects it in interesting and linguistically relevant ways. The center strings and adjunct strings can also be generated by a dependency grammar, avoiding the limitations of rewrite systems entirely.|$|R

The emulator works on StarBED, which is a network testbed consisting of hundreds of PCs connected to each other by Ethernet. The three major components of the emulator (the processor emulator of the active tag micro-controller, RUNE, and QOMET) are all implemented on StarBED. We present {{the structure of the}} emulator, how it functions, and the results from the emulation of the pedestrian tracking system. The emulator accomplished quite accurate emulation of ubiquitous network systems with the technique of emulation. We found several issues <b>originated</b> from active <b>tag’s</b> firmware or protocol by applying the emulator to the emulation of the tracking system. We confirmed the results obtained by running tests corresponding to a real-world experiment. Keywords—ubiquitous networks; distributed testbed; support-ing software I...|$|R
40|$|Motivation: Taking {{advantage}} of the high sensitivity and specificity of LongSAGE tag for transcript detection and genome mapping, we ana-lyzed the 632 813 unique human LongSAGE tags deposited in public databases to identify novel human antisense transcripts. Results: Our study identified 45 321 tags that match the antisense strand of 9804 known mRNA sequences, 6606 of which contain anti-sense ESTs and 3198 are mapped only by SAGE tags. Quantitative analysis showed that the detected antisense transcripts are present at levels lower than their counterpart sense transcripts. Experimental results confirmed the presence of antisense transcripts detected by the antisense tags. We also constructed an antisense tag database {{that can be used}} to identify the antisense SAGE <b>tags</b> <b>originated</b> from the antisense strand of known mRNA sequences included in the RefSeq database.

40|$|Background: Oleaginous yeast {{species are}} an {{alternative}} {{for the production}} of lipids or triacylglycerides (TAGs). These yeasts are usually non-pathogenic and able to store TAGs ranging from 20 % to 70 % of their cell mass depending on culture conditions. <b>TAGs</b> <b>originating</b> from oleaginous yeasts can be used as the so-called second generation biofuels, which are based on non-food competing "waste carbon sources". Results: In this study the selection of potentially new interesting oleaginous yeast strains is described. Important selection criteria were: a broad maximum temperature and pH range for growth (robustness of the strain), a broad spectrum of carbon sources that can be metabolized (preferably including C- 5 sugars), a high total fatty acid content in combination with a low glycogen content and genetic accessibility. Conclusions: Based on these selection criteria, among 24 screened species, Schwanniomyces occidentalis (Debaromyces occidentalis) CBS 2864 was selected as a promising strain {{for the production of}} high amounts of lipids. </p...|$|R
40|$|Serial {{analysis}} of gene expression (SAGE) is a sequencing-based technique that permits the simultaneous evaluation {{of thousands of}} transcripts in a single assay. The technique generates large numbers of short <b>tags,</b> <b>originating</b> from the last unique location of a restriction enzyme recognition site in a cDNA generated from a single transcript. DNA in aqueous solution can be precipitated by EtOH {{in the presence of}} sodium or ammonium acetate. In certain cases, an increased volume of ethanol or 10 min dry ice/ethanol incubation is required on the precipitation step, as indicated in the text. Terminate the reaction when the bromphenol blue stain in the loading buffer migrates {{to the bottom of the}} gel. The optimal dilution of the ditag ligation reaction products for large-scale PCR is considered based on 102 -bp band brightness to background ratio and highest dilution ratio. Once the conditions have been optimized, one needs to perform a large-scale PCR with a fresh LoTE dilution of the selected ditag ligation product as a template.

40|$|Small peptide tags {{are often}} fused to {{proteins}} {{to allow their}} affinity purification in high-throughput structure analysis schemes. To assess the compatibility of small peptide tags with protein crystallization and to examine if the tags alter the three-dimensional structure, the N-terminus of the chicken agr-spectrin SH 3 domain was labeled with a His 6 tag and the C-terminus with a StrepII tag. The resulting protein, His 6 -SH 3 -StrepII, consists of 83 amino-acid residues, 23 of which <b>originate</b> from the <b>tags.</b> His 6 -SH 3 -StrepII is readily purified by dual affinity chromatography, has very similar biophysical characteristics as the untagged protein domain and crystallizes readily {{from a number of}} sparse-matrix screen conditions. The crystal structure analysis at 2. 3 A resolution proves native-like structure of His 6 -SH 3 -StrepII and shows the entire His 6 tag and part of the StrepII tag to be disordered in the crystal. Obviously, the fused affinity tags did not interfere with crystallization and structure analysis and did not change the protein structure. From the extreme case of His 6 -SH 3 -StrepII, where affinity tags represent 27 % of the total fusion protein mass, we extrapolate that protein constructs with N- and C-terminal peptide tags may lend themselves to biophysical and structural investigations in high-throughput regimes. AbbreviationsSH 3 domain – Src homology 3 domain; His 6 -SH 3 -StrepII – agr-spectrin SH 3 domain with N-terminal His 6 and C-terminal StrepII affinity tag; GST – glutathione S-transferase; MBP – maltose-binding protein; aa – amino acid(s); rms – root-mean-square; MC – metal-chelating...|$|R
40|$|The {{cellular}} kinase Akt {{is a key}} controller {{of cellular}} metabolism, growth, and proliferation. Many viruses activate Akt due to its beneficial effects on viral replication. We previously showed that wild-type (WT) simian virus 40 (SV 40) large T antigen (TAg) inhibits apoptosis via the activation of PI 3 K/Akt signaling. Here we show that WT TAg expressed from recombinant adenoviruses in U 2 OS cells induced the phosphorylation of Akt at both T 308 and S 473. In contrast, Akt phosphorylation was eliminated by the K 1 mutation (E 107 K) within the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) binding motif of TAg. This suggested that Akt phosphorylation may depend on TAg binding to Rb or one of its family members. However, in Rb-negative SAOS 2 cells depleted of p 107 and p 130 by using small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs), WT TAg still mediated Akt phosphorylation. These results suggested that the K 1 mutation affects another TAg function. WT-TAg-mediated phosphorylation of Akt was inhibited by a PI 3 K inhibitor, suggesting {{that the effects of}} <b>TAg</b> <b>originated</b> upstream of PI 3 K; thus, we examined the requirement for insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS 1), which binds and activates PI 3 K. Depletion of IRS 1 by shRNAs abolished the WT-TAg-mediated phosphorylation of Akt. Immunoprecipitation studies showed that the known interaction between TAg and IRS 1 is significantly weakened by the K 1 mutation. These data indicate that the K 1 mutation disrupts not only Rb binding but also IRS 1 binding, contributing to the loss of activation of PI 3 K/Akt signaling...|$|R
40|$|The {{availability}} of systems for automatic and simultaneous identification of several items {{belonging to a}} logistics unit during production, warehousing and delivering can improve supply chain management and speed traceability controls. Radio frequency identification (RFID) is a powerful technique that potentially permits to reach this goal, but some aspects as, for instance, food product composition (e. g. moisture content, salt or sugar content) and some peculiarities of the production environment (high moisture, high/low temperatures, metallic structures) have prevented, so far, its application in food sector. In the food industry, composition and shape of items are much less regular than in other commodities sectors. In addition, {{a wide variety of}} packaging, composed by different materials, is employed. As material, size and shape of items to which the tag should be attached strongly influence the minimum power requested for tag functioning, performance improvements can be achieved only selecting suitable RF identifier for the specific combination of food product and packaging. When dealing with logistics units, the dynamic reading of a vast number of <b>tags</b> <b>originates</b> simultaneous broadcasting of signals (tag-to-tag collisions) that could affect reading rates and the overall reliability of the identification procedure. This paper reports the results of an extensive analysis of the reading performance of UHF RFID systems for multiple dynamic electronic identification of food packed products in controlled conditions.

40|$|In our {{contemporary}} legal landscape, a student wishing {{to study the}} law of the workplace has scarce opportunity to encounter an integrated body of scholarship that analyzes the labor market as the subject of government regulation, contractual duties, collective action, and individual rights. Work law developed in the American legal system as a patchwork of common law doctrine, federal and state statutes, and evolving social norms. Typical law school curricula often include courses relating to the four pillars of work law: 2 ̆ 2 employment law, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 labor law, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 employment discrimination, 2 ̆ 2 and some variation of a tax-oriented 2 ̆ 2 employee-benefits law. 2 ̆ 2 Employment law, in most categorizations, studies the boundaries of the individual employment contract, including contractual limitations, tort liabilities, and minimum protections. Labor law is the subject of collective bargaining between unions and employers, statutorily framed by the National Labor Relations Act (2 ̆ 2 NLRA 2 ̆ 2). Employment antidiscrimination law is the subject of status-based unequal treatment in the workplace, including on the basis of gender, race, national origin, disability, or religion. Lastly, the fourth category, employee-benefits law, involves the standards controlling the administration and taxation of social welfare attached to the work cycle, including unemployment benefits, pensions and ERISA, health insurance and COBRA, disability benefits, and worker compensation plans. More than simply substantive divisions, these four categories are also stacked as historical developments in the regulation of work and vary in the public and private mechanisms each undertakes as means for social control. In other words, the subfields of work law correspond with ideas about modes of effective and legitimate social regulation, creating contrived form substance alignments. While some questions have been resolved through legislation, other areas developed through ad hoc adjudication. Similarly, while some areas are federally regulated, other areas are controlled by state law. And while issues such as workplace safety are enforced by a public administrative agency, other issues, such as antidiscrimination claims, are enforced primarily by private litigation. Although the four pillars of work law have developed relatively independently from one another, the realities of contemporary work defy this fragmented structure and its conceptual satellites. The subjects and regulatory tools of all four subfields overlap significantly, and it is increasingly problematic to study them separately. In reality, legal disputes do not <b>originate</b> carrying a <b>tag</b> of one category or another. Workers experiencing dislocation or mistreatment seek assistance that transcends these divides and requires a more expansive outlook...|$|R
40|$|Towards Biodiesel Production Using Lignocelluloses Biodiesel is {{technically}} defined as alkyl (usually methyl and ethyl) esters of long-chain fatty acids. When {{used as a}} fuel, biodiesel shows many merits, such as high energy density, more favorable combustion emission profile, improved lubricating properties, and others. It is also an environment-benign fuel comparing with petroleum-based diesel, as biodiesel is biodegradable, non-toxic, and essentially carbon dioxide neutral. Therefore, biodiesel is considered as an excellent renewable energy carrier. Biodiesel is now commercially manufactured through transesterification of lipids, or triacylglycerides (<b>TAG)</b> <b>originated</b> from plant seeds or animal tissues. Various renewable lipids were chosen as feedstock for biodiesel production. For example, European countries use rapeseed oil; USA, soybean oil; and the Southeast Asian countries, palm oil, etc. Current world TAG production with grassy oil crops or other woody oil plants produces around 120 million metric tons every year. As biodiesel industry is developing explosively, TAG supply worldwide is getting extremely tight. The situation has also put food supply and traditional oleochemical industry in threat. Production of more TAG with conventional technology requires large amounts of arable land, which in many regions is not a realistic option. In China, oil crops produce around 10 million tons of vegetable oil every year, which is not even enough for food. In 2006, the net import of vegetable oil for China was 6. 3 million tons, {{according to the data}} from the Ministry of Agriculture of PRC. Therefore, sustainable biodiesel industry needs novel technology to secure TAG supply. Lipids production through fermentation process using oleaginous microorganisms can be an alternative way in lieu of traditional oil plant-based practice. Many molds, yeasts and algae exhibit a capacity to accumulate intracellular lipids as high as over 70 % of their biomass, and the major microbial lipids closely resemble vegetable oils in that they are composed of C 16 and C 18 series long-chain fatty acids. Moreover, it is well documented that oleaginous microbes can metabolize both hexoses and pentoses present in lignocellulosic biomass and other cheap raw materials. Scientists of Dalian Institutes of Chemical Physics, CAS, have advocated the proposal of “biomass-to-biodiesel” (BM 2 BD) that produces biodiesel using lignocellulosic materials as feedstock. To attain biodiesel, three stages are included, 1) Hydrolysis of lignocelluloses to deliver complex carbohydrates containing both hexoses and pentoses; 2) Fermentation with oleaginous microbes to accumulate intracellular lipids; and 3) Transesterification of microbial lipids with methanol using traditional technology. The BM 2 BD strategy can be operated continuously and with no extensive arable land requirement. Moreover, by utilization of lignocelluloses, the most abundant renewable carbon source in the world, it is no longer competing with food and oleochemical industry for conventional raw materials. Apparently, BM 2 BD research is pivotal for a sustainable biodiesel industry. Progress and challenges for biodiesel production using lignocelluloses as feedstock will be discussed during the meeting. 科技...|$|R
