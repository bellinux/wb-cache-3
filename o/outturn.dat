This includes sports-related costs only, that is, (i) operational costs incurred by the organizing committee {{for the purpose of}} staging the Games, e.g., expenditures for technology, transportation, workforce, administration, security, catering, ceremonies, and medical services, and (ii) direct capital costs incurred by the host city and country or private investors to build the competition venues, the Olympic village, international broadcast center, and media and press center, which are required to host the Games. Indirect capital costs are not included, such as for road, rail, or airport infrastructure, or for hotel upgrades or other business investment incurred in preparation for the Games but not directly related to staging the Games. The Beijing Olympics' cost of USD 6.8 billion compares with costs of USD 4.6 billion for Rio 2016 and USD 15 billion for London 2012.

40|$|Abstract: IMF {{supported}} {{programs include}} key objectives (such as growth, inflation, and current account adjustment) and the intermediate policy targets (such as monetary and fiscal policies) {{needed to achieve}} these objectives. In this paper, we use a new, large dataset, with information on 94 programs between 1989 and 2002, to compare programmed objectives and policy targets to actual <b>outturns,</b> and report two broad sets of results. Regarding objectives, we find that <b>outturns</b> typically fell short of expectations {{in the areas of}} growth and inflation, but were broadly in line with the programmed external current account objectives. Regarding the intermediate policy targets, programmed policies were generally more ambitious than policy <b>outturns,</b> and we document the extent of this difference. Second, focusing on growth, we examine the relationship between objectives and policy targets and find a difference in the way ambitious monetary and fiscal targets affected the achievement of the growth objective. Regarding fiscal targets, even when they were missed, if they were more ambitious, the performance on growth was better. On the other hand, more ambitious monetary targets, tended to reduced growth performance...|$|R
50|$|Milling {{to remove}} the outer coats from a grain may take place {{in one or more}} stages. For paddy rice {{considerable}} mechanical effort is needed {{to remove the}}se layers. Any weakness in the kernel will be apparent at this stage. Even with grain in perfect condition, correctly set milling and polishing machinery is essential to yield high processing <b>outturns.</b> Complete separation of edible from less-desired products is always difficult to achieve but, even so, there are significant differences in milling efficiency. In the case of rice, milling <b>outturns</b> can vary from 60% or less to around 67%, depending on the efficiency of the mill. Even a 1% increase in yield of whole grain rice can thus result in huge increases in national food resources.|$|R

The F3D was, however, able to <b>outturn</b> a MiG-15. The fire control system in the F3D-1 was the Westinghouse AN/APQ-35. The AN/APQ-35 was advanced for the time, a combination of three different radars, each performing separate functions: an AN/APS-21 search radar, an AN/APG-26 tracking radar, both located in the nose, and an AN/APS-28 tail warning radar. The complexity of this vacuum tube-based radar system, which was produced before the advent of semiconductor electronics, required intensive maintenance to keep it operating properly.|$|E

25|$|Improvements were {{relatively}} quick, but the type was a civilian design, converted to military use. Initially Fw 200Bs were built {{to fly in}} thin air at high altitude, with no sharp manoeuvring. Kurt Tank – its designer – had made the aircraft's long range possible by using a light airframe that was two to four tons lighter than its contemporaries. This meant the aircraft did not have fuel tank sealant or armour protection. An under-strength structure contributed to these vulnerabilities, which made the Fw 200 unable to sustain much punishment. The engines were also underpowered, meaning it struggled to stay airborne if one was knocked out. The six unarmoured fuel tanks inside the cabin made it exceptionally prone to bursting into flames. When a Condor attempted to manoeuvre to avoid anti-aircraft fire or enemy fighters, its weak structure could be damaged, causing metal fatigue and cracks, resulting {{in the loss of}} the aircraft. In the C variant, major improvements were made to its defensive armament, causing fighters to avoid lengthy duels. However, they operated at low level mostly, to avoid attacks from below. This limited their operational range and options. They could ‘jink' to throw an enemy aircraft off its aim, but they could not outrun or <b>outturn</b> an opponent. Poor evasion qualities meant the type was not the ideal operational weapon.|$|E
