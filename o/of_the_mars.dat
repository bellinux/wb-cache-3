5|$|The discography <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Mars</b> Volta, an American {{progressive}} {{rock group}} formed in 2001, consists of six studio albums, one live album, two extended plays, and nine singles. The final lineup <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Mars</b> Volta {{consisted of the}} two founding members Omar Rodríguez-López on guitar and production, Cedric Bixler-Zavala on vocals and lyrics, along with Juan Alderete on bass, Marcel Rodriguez-Lopez on keyboards and percussion, and Deantoni Parks on drums.|$|E
5|$|Frusciante {{began working}} with Omar Rodríguez-López in 2001 and has since collaborated on many {{recordings}} under both artists' names. Frusciante also was considered an honorary member <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Mars</b> Volta from 2002 to 2008, occasionally performing live with the band from 2003 to 2006. Frusciante served as executive producer on Rodríguez-López's first film, released in 2010, The Sentimental Engine Slayer, which was filmed in 2007.|$|E

5|$|The New Horizons {{mission to}} Pluto was {{launched}} in 2006 and successfully performed a flyby of Pluto on July 14, 2015.

5|$|Although Mars has no {{evidence}} of a structured global magnetic field, observations show that parts of the planet's crust have been magnetized, suggesting that alternating polarity reversals of its dipole field have occurred in the past. This paleomagnetism of magnetically susceptible minerals is similar to the alternating bands found on Earth's ocean floors. One theory, published in 1999 and re-examined in October 2005 (with the help <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mars</b> Global Surveyor), is that these bands suggest plate tectonic activity on Mars four billion years ago, before the planetary dynamo ceased to function and the planet's magnetic field faded.|$|E
5|$|As the {{reputation}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mars</b> Works grew, so too did {{the demand for}} its products. After a few years the Mars Works began exporting its engines inland. Oliver Evans's son George was the first such order, having moved to Pittsburgh in 1809 to operate the Pittsburgh Steam Flour Mill. George and the mill were highly successful, and generated {{a great deal of}} interest in Evans's engines across the interior. However exporting engines to western Pennsylvania, Kentucky or Ohio was challenging and expensive from a logistical perspective. In 1811 Evans and George, as well as another successful steam miller and engineer Luther Stephens, founded the Pittsburgh Steam Engine Company, which in addition to engines would, like the Mars Works, produce heavy machinery and castings in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. With high demand for industrial products and relatively little industrial capacity, the Pittsburgh works added to its repertoire the capacity for brasswork, as well as producing finer products for domestic purposes like hinges and fittings.|$|E

5|$|Radar {{results from}} SHARAD {{suggested}} that features termed lobate debris aprons (LDAs) contain {{large amounts of}} water ice. Of interest {{from the days of}} the Viking Orbiters, these LDA are aprons of material surrounding cliffs. They have a convex topography and a gentle slope; this suggests flow away from the steep source cliff. In addition, lobate debris aprons can show surface lineations just as rock glaciers on the Earth. SHARAD has provided strong evidence that the LDAs in Hellas Planitia are glaciers that are covered with a thin layer of debris (i.e. rocks and dust); a strong reflection from the top and base of LDAs was observed, suggesting that pure water ice makes up the bulk of the formation (between the two reflections). Based on the experiments of the Phoenix lander and the studies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mars</b> Odyssey from orbit, water ice is known to exist just under the surface of Mars in the far north and south (high latitudes).|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} Doom 3 is {{conveyed}} through in-game dialogue and cut scenes, {{as well as}} e-mails, audio logs and video files found throughout the game. The game opens with UAC board member Elliott Swann and his bodyguard Jack Campbell arriving at Mars City, the main access to the UAC's Mars base, disembarking from an Earth transport, with the player's anonymous marine just behind them. Swann and Campbell, here to investigate multiple incidents, have a heated conference meeting with {{the man in charge}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mars</b> laboratories, Dr. Malcolm Betruger while the marine heads to Master Sergeant Thomas Kelly for orders. Kelly gives the marine instructions to find a scientist from the Delta Labs who has gone missing. The marine finds the scientist in a nearby decommissioned communications facility, where he is frantically trying to send a warning to the UAC on Earth about Betruger's teleportation experiments. However, as he tries to explain the situation to the marine, another teleportation test takes place and loses containment, at which point the entire Mars base is swept with an unnatural shockwave. This transforms most of the base's personnel into zombies as the forces of Hell invade through the teleporter's portal.|$|E
