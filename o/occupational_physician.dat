40|$|A recent {{questionnaire}} survey among Dutch <b>occupational</b> <b>physicians</b> showed marked {{differences in their}} work satisfaction related to the work settings. Work satisfaction is regarded as an indicator {{for the quality of}} care as it is associated with a higher patient satisfaction, fewer mistakes, smaller turnover and a higher morale. This has led to a qualitative study into the factors motivating <b>occupational</b> <b>physicians</b> in their work (satisfiers) and frustrating them (dissatisfiers). Particular attention was paid to the impact of the work setting. Eleven focus group interviews were carried out, in which 87 <b>occupational</b> <b>physicians</b> were involved. There were seven interviews with physicians from three large occupational health services, two with independent <b>occupational</b> <b>physicians</b> and two with <b>physicians</b> from in-house <b>occupational</b> health services.

Autonomy is a very important satisfier for self-employed <b>occupational</b> <b>physicians.</b> <b>Occupational</b> <b>physicians</b> employed by companies for in-house services identify strongly with the companies they are working for and with their in-house <b>occupational</b> health department. <b>Physicians</b> in large commercial occupational health services appreciate their logistic and administrative support and the facilities for professional development.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Occupational</b> <b>Physicians</b> rely {{especially}} on advice from colleagues when answering their information demands. On the other hand, Evidence-based Medicine (EBM) promotes {{the use of}} up-to-date research literature instead of experts. To {{find out if there}} was a difference between expert-based practice and EBM we compared professional advice on occupational health topics with best evidence from the literature. Methods We asked 14 <b>occupational</b> <b>physicians</b> to consult their usual information sources on 12 pre-conceived occupational health problems. The problems were presented in the form of case vignettes which contained sufficient clinical information to be used by the <b>occupational</b> <b>physicians</b> for the consultation of their experts. We had searched the literature for the best available evidence on the 12 problems, which made it possible to answer the clinical questions with a clear yes or no. Results The cases could be used by the <b>occupational</b> <b>physicians</b> as arising from their own practice. All together the <b>occupational</b> <b>physicians</b> consulted 75 different experts. Almost half of the consulted experts were near colleagues, 10 % were industrial hygienists, 8 % medical specialists and the rest had a varied background. Fifty three percent (95 % confidence interval 42 % to 65 %) of all professional advice was not in line with the research literature. In 18 cases (24 %) professional advice explicitly referred to up-to-date research literature as their used source. These cases were substantially less incorrect (17 %) than advice that had not mentioned the literature as a source (65 %) (difference 48 %, 95 % Confidence Interval from 27 % to 69 %). Conclusion Advice that <b>occupational</b> <b>physicians</b> routinely get in their daily practice differs substantially from best evidence from the literature. <b>Occupational</b> <b>physicians</b> who ask professional advice should always ask about the evidence of this advice. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background Since {{a higher}} level of self-efficacy in common mental {{disorders}} is associated with earlier return-to-work (RTW), {{it is important to know}} if work related self-efficacy can be increased by occupational health care. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate whether an intervention to enhance guideline adherence of <b>occupational</b> <b>physicians</b> lead to an increase in RTW self-efficacy in workers three months later. The secondary aim was to evaluate whether the intervention modified the association between RTW self-efficacy and return-to-work three months later. Methods A total of 66 <b>occupational</b> <b>physicians</b> participated in the study. They were randomized into two groups; the intervention group received a training, the control group did not. The training aimed to enhance adherence to a mental health guideline that contained strategies that are supposed to enhance RTW self-efficacy. In 128 sick-listed workers guided by these <b>occupational</b> <b>physicians,</b> RTW self-efficacy, RTW, and personal, health-related and work-related variables were measured at baseline and three months later. Generalized linear mixed models analysis and linear mixed models analysis were used for the evaluations. Results In workers whose <b>occupational</b> <b>physicians</b> had received the training RTW self-efficacy increased significantly more than in workers whose <b>occupational</b> <b>physicians</b> had participated in the control group (t[*]=[*]− 2. 626, p[*]≤[*]. 05). Higher baseline RTW self-efficacy scores were significantly more often associated with full RTW than with no RTW three months later (OR 2. 20, 95 % CI 1. 18 – 4. 07), but the intervention did not affect this association. Conclusions This study showed that a training to enhance guideline adherence of <b>occupational</b> <b>physicians</b> leads to increased RTW self-efficacy in workers sick-listed with common mental disorders during the first months of sickness absence in a real-life occupational health care setting. This insight is helpful for optimizing the recovery and RTW process, and for understanding the role of RTW self-efficacy in this process. Trial registration ISRCTN 8660531...|$|R

Methods Eligible were cancer patients treated with curative intent and who have paid work. Data were collected from patients assigned to the intervention group (N = 65) and from nurses who delivered the patient education and support at the hospital (N = 4) by means of questionnaires, nurses' reports, and checklists.
