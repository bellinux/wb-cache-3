Although Wenger agreed his team were set-up cautiously, he denied they abandoned their playing style: [...] "...we defend <b>our</b> <b>game</b> on togetherness and solidarity and on defending well and attacking well."

40|$|Title: Image of Austrian Society in {{the time}} of National Socialism: a Thematic Analysis of the Novel All <b>our</b> <b>Games</b> by Erika Mitterer Abstract: This diploma thesis deals with the work of the Austrian author Erika Mitterer and her {{experience}} with the ideology of the Third Reich. In the first part, I present the life and activities of the author, while putting a special emphasis on the period of National Socialism. The second part deals with the general characteristics of Mitterer's literary production. The main part of the thesis is the analysis of the novel All <b>our</b> <b>Games,</b> in which Mitterer tries to achieve a qualitative image of Austrian society during the Nazi regime. This picture is drawn by the Author using the example of a life of a fictive family. A general picture of the novel's time is constructed {{on the basis of the}} motives that are found in the book.

I guess the plan is, next four years, Rio we go one more." ...|$|E

500|$|The series {{forced the}} NHL and the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association to {{reassess}} {{all aspects of}} how the game was played in North America. Journalist Herb Pinder described the NHL to that point in this way: [...] "The Europeans took <b>our</b> <b>game</b> and evolved it, while we stood still or even went backwards. [...] The Russians had a style, and the Czechs' style was different from that... There was this hockey world evolving through international competition, and we're back here, stuck, just playing ourselves. [...] It was a business monopoly. [...] And like any monopoly, the NHL got stagnant." [...] Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Canadian hockey encouraged the adoption of new coaching and training methods used in Europe, and emphasized conditioning and skills development.|$|E

The model of Warthog used in Forza Motorsport 4 is identical to the version in the then-upcoming Halo 4, although the vehicle is not drivable. Turn 10 has cited the vehicle's exaggerated four wheel steering system, fictional futuristic technology and excessive height as reasons for its exclusion, stating [...] "One, it's got some technology that's built into Halo {{that would have been a}} big investment for us to then build into the game only to support one vehicle.

[...] According to Canada's goaltender Ken Dryden: [...] "We didn't play <b>our</b> <b>game</b> at all. After they tied it up, we started playing a panic type of game. Sometimes there were five men going for the puck at once." [...] At the end of the game, Team Canada accidentally snubbed the Soviets by returning to the dressing room directly without shaking hands with the Soviets after the game.|$|E

Half the stuff on the list I can't even pronounce." [...] Later, Davis would say that he believed Roger Maris's 61 home run season was the true single-season home run record, due to the steroid scandal surrounding Barry Bonds, Sammy Sosa, and Mark McGwire.|$|E

500|$|The {{significance}} of the fixture for the two clubs was increased by the fact that, had Arsenal avoided defeat, they would have extended their unbeaten league run to 50 matches. Wenger told reporters at his press conference that he felt no increased pressure, though added the team's midweek draw in the UEFA Champions League at Panathinaikos increased expectation. He admitted his team's behaviour in the fixture last season was unacceptable, but pointed out [...] "...the best response we gave was to win the fair play table.

[...] In <b>our</b> <b>game</b> with Michigan, we had two men {{instructed}} to play against Schulz and at times three and four were opposed to him. [...] For some time, he handed out as much as we passed to him in the roughing end of the game. [...] He was here, there and everywhere. He did most of the tackling.

Gerrard was unrepentant for tackling Vieira and stated {{he was trying to}} [...] "stamp [...] authority" [...] on the match. [...] He accepted defeat and was optimistic Liverpool had the means to win the Premier League: [...] "We'd rather they beat us in this game and then we go on to pick up the title. That's what we're really looking at. Even though they got the better of us yesterday, it doesn't mean they'll do better than us over the whole season." [...] Diouf insisted he should have earned a penalty in the second half, given he felt there was [...] "definite contact" [...] from a challenge in the penalty box: [...] "It was a penalty, definitely, but the referee is the master on the pitch and he didn't give it.

500|$|In the 2001–02 season, Barcelona {{once more}} {{finished}} {{fourth in the}} league. Petit left the club to join Chelsea before the season commenced, as he had found his first team opportunities limited. While on international duty with the Netherlands in September 2001, Overmars suffered a bruised knee {{and as a result}} did not play for Barcelona for a month. In November 2001, he scored Barcelona's third goal against Liverpool in the Champions League, which came after 29 uninterrupted passes. It was described by the Daily Mirror as [...] "arguably the greatest team goal ever scored". Compared to the previous season, Overmars was used more sparingly in matches. Rexach had changed the team's formation to accommodate new signing Javier Saviola and promoted Xavi as a first-team regular. Overmars made an impact as a substitute against Galatasaray in December 2001; he set up Saviola twice to earn Barcelona a 2–2 draw. Mircea Lucescu, the manager of Galatasaray, complimented Overmars afterwards: [...] "When we were 2–0 up I told my players at half-time to maintain the result, but Overmars is a great player. We did not have a solution to him and it threw <b>our</b> <b>game</b> off balance." ...|$|E
