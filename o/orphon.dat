40|$|To {{ascertain}} {{the extent and}} organization of the germ-line human T-cell receptor (TCR) beta-chain gene repertoire, beta-chain variable region (V beta) genes were mapped by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, cosmid cloning, and in situ hybridization. Probes derived from the 24 known V beta families were mapped {{to a total of}} six Sfi I fragments in DNA samples from multiple individuals representing all possible haplotypes of TCR V- and C (constant) -region insertion/deletion-related polymorphisms. Four of the Sfi I fragments were linked to one another to develop an extended map of the TCR beta-chain gene complex previously localized to chromosome 7 q 35. The remaining two Sfi I fragments, containing 6 V beta genes, could not be linked to the TCR beta-chain gene complex. Using human-hamster somatic cell hybrids and in situ hybridization, these <b>orphon</b> genes were localized to chromosome 9 p. Nucleotide sequences of the <b>orphon</b> V beta genes, derived from cosmid clones, were 93 - 97 % identical to V beta genes in the TCR beta-chain gene complex. Open reading frames in three of the <b>orphon</b> V beta genes were intact as were the recombination signal sequences. As expected, based on their <b>orphon</b> status, none of the V beta genes of chromosome 9 was detected in transcripts containing C beta. These results indicate that the functional germ-line V beta repertoire in humans is substantially (10 %) smaller than previously estimated...|$|E
40|$|The genes {{encoding}} the variable, joining {{and constant}} regions of human immunoglobulin light chains have been localized {{to the short}} arm of chromosome 2. However, several VK genes lie outside of the locus: a single copy cluster of five VK genes is located on chromosome 22; an isolated but amplified VkI gene is found on chromosome 1; and several isolated VkI genes are on as-yet-unidentified chromosomes other than chromosome 2. Vk genes not contained within the kappa locus are termed orphons. We have attempted to gain insight into the mechanism of transposition of both the chromosome 22 cluster and the several amplified VkI genes by searching in the kappa locus for a parent copy of the former, and by analyzing the junctions between transposed VKI-containing segments and adjacent non-amplified regions. The chromosome 22 <b>orphon</b> cluster must have been non-duplicatively transposed. Sequence features at the junctions of this and other <b>orphon</b> regions are direct and inverted repeats, and, in one case, an Alu repeat. These unusual features may have predisposed the <b>orphon</b> regions to transposition by serving as target sites for enzymes involved in recombination...|$|E
40|$|The VK gene {{segments}} {{that have}} been transposed from the kappa locus on the short arm of chromosome 2 at 2 p 11 - 12 to other chromosomal sites are called <b>orphons.</b> The 18 VK <b>orphons</b> sequenced up to now carry defects and are to be considered pseudogenes. We now describe the VKI gene segment V 108 whose sequence is without any defects and which was localized to the long arm of chromosome 2 at 2 q 12 - 14 by in situ hybridization. The V 108 region may have been transposed from the short to the long arm of chromosome 2 by a pericentric inversion. Possible reasons {{for the conservation of}} its sequence are discussed. In spite of its bona fide sequence V 108 is considered to be an unlikely candidate for a VK-JK rearrangement and subsequent functional expression...|$|R
40|$|Some {{aspects of}} the work of our group on the human and mouse {{immunoglobulin}} genes are reviewed. The human locus contains a large duplication: a 600 kb C-proximal copy with 40 V genes is found in the close vicinity of a 440 kb C-distal copy with 36 very similar, but not identical, V genes. The chimpanzee has only the C-proximal copy of the locus. The locus of the mouse is close to 3. 2 Mb in size, of which 3. 1 Mb have been cloned in four contigs, leaving three small gaps of together about 90 kb; 140 V genes and pseudogenes were localized and sequenced. In paral-lel to the elucidation {{of the structure of the}} loci, the mechanisms of the V-J rearrangement, somatic hy-permutation and gene expression were studied. Various polymorphisms were detected in the human population and a number of haplotypes defined. In addition to the V genes within the loci numerous V <b>orphons</b> were localized on different chromosomes. Comparing the loci of different species allows some interesting conclusions as to the evolution of this multigene family. Finally our strategy of elucidating the structure and function of the loci, which has been termed a ‘cottage industry approach’, is discussed in relation to the large-scale genome analysis as pur-sued today using automated methods...|$|R
40|$|The {{immunoglobulin}} (IG) and T {{cell receptor}} (TR) major loci span about 6 Megabases (Mb) {{of the human}} genome on chromosomes 2, 7, 14 and 22, and 9 Mb in mouse on chromosomes 6, 12, 13, 14 and 16. There are seven major loci: three IG loci (IGH, IGK, IGL) and four TR loci (TRA, TRB, TRG, TRD), with a distinct repartition of the variable (V), diversity (D), joining (J) and constant (C) genes. The human genome comprises a total number of 608 - 665 IG and TR genes (371 - 422 IG and 237 - 243 TR), depending on the haplotypes, per haploid genome ^ 1, 2 ^ of which 531 - 588 genes are located in the major loci (distributed in 369 - 418 V, 32 D, 105 - 109 J and 25 - 29 C genes). There are also 77 <b>orphons</b> (68 IG and 9 TR) including two processed IG genes, outside the major loci. The number of functional IG and TR genes is 308 - 356 (136 - 171 IG and 172 - 185 TR) per haploid genome. The mouse genome comprises an approximate number of 876 IG and TR genes (624 IG and 252 TR). All these genomic data are available in the IMGT® gene database, IMGT/GENE-DB ^ 3 ^. The major contribution of IMGT/GENE-DB has been to establish, for the first time, a standardized nomenclature of the IG and TR genes and alleles of humans and other vertebrates. In April 2009, IMGT/GENE-DB manages 1999 genes and 3026 alleles. |$|R
40|$|Diverse mRNAs of Trypanosoma brucei {{possess the}} same 5 ' {{terminal}} 35 nucleotides, termed the spliced leader (SL), {{which appears to}} be derived from a separate 135 nucleotide transcript. This small SL RNA is encoded within a 1. 4 kb unit of DNA which is tandemly reiterated in the genome. In addition, there are at least 4 <b>orphon</b> elements containing SL sequences dispersed from the tandem array. Here we show that during the trypanosome life cycle one of the SL orphons undergoes a stage-specific modification that prevents cleavage of an EcoRV site and we further demonstrate that although only one <b>orphon</b> is modified, three of the SL orphons are flanked by very similar sequences. Each of these contains SL reiteration units including the non-transcribed spacer DNA, suggesting that they did not originate through an RNA intermediate. In addition no evidence of direct repeats at the junction of 1. 4 kb and non- 1. 4 kb DNA was observed. Finally, a phylogenetic survey indicates that while many trypanosomatid species possess similarly organized SL-like sequences, only the SL orphons of closely related subspecies of the T. brucei - T. evansi complex share similar flanking regions...|$|E
40|$|The {{localization}} of Vκ gene {{regions to}} chromosome 2, {{on which the}} κ locus is located, and to other chromosomes is described. The Vκ genes that have been transposed to other chromosomes are called orphons. The finding of two new Vκ genes on chromosome 22 is reported. A Vκ II gene of this region and two Vκ I genes of the Chr 1 and the cos 118 regions were sequenced. The two Vκ I <b>orphon</b> sequences and two others that had been determined previously were 97. 5 % identical, indicating {{that they may have}} evolved from a common ancestor by amplification. A model of the evolution of the human Vκ orphons is discussed.

40|$|In nematodes, the 22 {{nucleotide}} (nt) spliced leader (SL) {{is normally}} encoded by a multi-copy, tandemly reiterated SL gene and is trans-spliced from SL-RNA onto the 5 ' {{end of a}} subset of mRNAs. We {{have found that the}} SL is also encoded at multiple (> 100) <b>orphon</b> genomic sites in the parasitic nematode Angiostrongylus cantonensis. At these sites the sequence forms part of a 198 bp repetitive element (designated con- 198). Transcription from two genomic elements that contain the con- 198 sequence has been characterised. At one element (G- 2) an approximately 850 nt RNA with an internal SL is transcribed. At the other (G- 1), transcription takes place 3 kb downstream of the con- 198 sequence...|$|E
40|$|Yeast {{artificial}} chromosomes (YACs) {{were used}} to construct a physical map of the germline human T-cell beta chain gene complex (TCRB). Variable region genes (BV) for the 25 known subfamilies were used as probes to screen the ICRF AM 4 x YAC library. Of the five positive YACs identified, one YAC designated B 3, 820 kilobase pairs (kbp) in size, scored positive for all 25 TCRBV subfamilies plus the constant region genes (BC) when analyzed by pulse field gel electrophoresis. Restriction enzyme mapping of B 3 located TCRBV and TCRBC gene regions to 4 Sfi I fragments of 280 110, 90, and 125 kbp and was in accordance with published data. In addition comparison of hybridization results of Sfi I-restricted B 3 and genomic DNA from the parental cell line GM 1416 B revealed identical banding patterns. The data thus showed YAC B 3 encoded a complete and unrearranged TCRB gene locus of some 600 - 620 kbp. The map was further resolved by locating restriction sites for Sal I and Bss HII on B 3, giving more precise localization of the individual TCRBV gene families. Fluorescent in situ hybridization of B 3 to spreads of human metaphase chromosomes localized B 3 to 7 q 35. However, two additional signals were obtained; one attributable to the TCRBV <b>orphon</b> cluster on 9 p 21, the second to the long arm of chromosome 2. Polymerase chain reaction amplification of a chromosome 2 somatic cell hybrid, using primers for all 25 TCRBV gene families, revealed that the signal was not attributable to a second <b>orphon</b> cluster. It is suggested that B 3 is a chimeric YAC with an intact TCRB locus flanked by chromosome 2 sequences...|$|E
40|$|In a {{study of}} the {{prevalence}} and incidence of trypanosomosis in horses and donkeys in two regions of the Gambia, surveys were carried out at Niamina east and Bansang south with a high and low to moderate tsetse challenge, respectively. Eleven horses and 67 donkeys were sampled monthly from August 1997 to September 1998. Blood samples were examined for trypanosomes using the buffy-coat (BC) method and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Three primer sets were used, specific for either Trypanosoma vivax (TVW), Trypanosoma congolense (GOL) or Trypanosoma brucei (<b>ORPHON</b> 5 J). The BC results showed that the prevalence (August 1997) and the average monthly incidence (September 1997 - 1998) of trypanosome infections in horses (45. 5 and 16 %, respectively) were significantly higher than in donkeys (6. 2 and 9 %, respectively). Using PCR, the number of detected cases was seven times higher than using the BC. T congolense was the most frequently observed species, followed by T vivax and T brucei. This study confirms earlier observations by other authors that donkeys, which are exposed to a similar tsetse challenge as horses, are significantly less infected with trypanosomes than the latter.
