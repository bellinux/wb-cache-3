5|$|It was {{a little}} strange. And {{definitely}} when I {{walked down the aisle}} I was like, 'This is kind of creepy — there’s some other man standing there!' It was really beautiful. People were all really excited like it was really my wedding. My mother was even like, 'Aww', and I was like, 'Mom, it's a video. This is not my dress. This is not the real wedding.' But I think it’s just <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>moments</b> that every woman kind of fantasizes and relives.|$|E
500|$|This {{would cause}} {{problems}} for the studio, Universal and partner MGM. [...] "The studio is just back from the holiday and is regrouping based on the news, and has no cohesive game plan at the moment," [...] said Kevin Misher, Universal's President of Production. Misher added that, [...] "It was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>moments</b> {{when you sit down}} and think, 'Can Clarice be looked upon as James Bond for instance? A character who is replaceable?' Or was Jodie Foster Clarice Starling, and the audience will not accept anyone else?" [...] Foster said in December 1999 that the characterization of Starling in Hannibal had [...] "negative attributes" [...] and [...] "betrayed" [...] the original character.|$|E
500|$|Lopez was {{surprised}} by the enormous media coverage, declaring in an interview: [...] "It was a nice dress. I had no idea it was going to become such a big deal." [...] Versace later revealed that the dress was the turning point of her career, saying that the media now had confidence in her own work, after the death of Gianni Versace. She declared to the Canadian press, [...] "It was an unexpected success. The next day she [...] was everywhere and people were talking about her in that dress. It was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>moments</b> like the one that Gianni [...] had with Elizabeth Hurley and clothes-pins." [...] The dress has been referred to many times as [...] "notorious" [...] and [...] "infamous" [...] because of its boldness.|$|E
60|$|It was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> supreme <b>moments</b> almost beyond {{speech or}} manifestation of feeling.|$|R
60|$|A strange stillness {{hung over}} the restaurant; it was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> rare <b>moments</b> when the {{orchestra}} was not discoursing the strains of the Ice-cream Sailor waltz.|$|R
60|$|To {{the frightened}} {{boys in the}} cabin {{it was as if}} the night would never come to an end, and during every <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> fearful <b>moments</b> they {{believed}} the yacht was on the point of taking the final plunge.|$|R
500|$|The ending, {{in which}} the pirates are each {{shot to death by}} American snipers, {{reflects}} the resolution of the pirate hijacking of the MV Maersk Alabama in April 2009, where U.S. Navy SEALs rescued the captain after three snipers simultaneously killed three pirates with one shot each. They are portrayed in a particularly sympathetic light when they are killed during the ending. Travis Fickett of IGN said, [...] "It's <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>moments</b> where South Park feels the need to give voice to a side the media is ignoring—and points out that things aren't quite as cut and dry [...] as we might like." [...] The episode has also been described as a commentary on the way in which Americans tend to take their relative wealth and comfort for granted. A U.S. Navy SEAL ordering another to [...] "not hit the white ones" [...] has also been described as an indictment of the American approach to foreign policy.|$|E
500|$|Wan {{pitched the}} idea to Whannell of two men chained to {{opposite}} sides of a bathroom with a dead body {{in the middle of}} the floor and they are trying to figure out why and how they are there. By the end of the film they realize the person lying on the floor is not dead and he is the reason they are locked in the room. Whannell initially did not give Wan the reaction he was looking for. He said, [...] "I'll never forget that day. I remember hanging up the phone and started just going over it in my head, and without any sort of long period of pondering, I opened my diary that I had at the time and wrote the word 'Saw'." [...] Before instantaneously writing the word [...] "Saw" [...] in a blood-red, dripping font, the two had not come up with a title. [...] "It was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>moments</b> that made me aware that some things just really are meant to be. Some things are just waiting there to be discovered," [...] Whannell said.|$|E
500|$|... "Make Me Over" [...] was {{inspired}} by the band's love of British rock, while strains of [...] "Learn You Inside Out" [...] were inspired by the Plastic Ono Band. When asked about the song [...] "Learn You Inside Out", Wade said, [...] "I wrote it really quick. We decided just to freestyle. It was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>moments</b> when we really grew as a band, being able to reach each other and know where we're going." [...] The song [...] "Disarray" [...] {{was inspired}} by Wade's strict and religious family. When asked about the song, he said, [...] "Angels, demons. We all fight them both, and anyone who pretends they don’t is not someone I want to hang out with." [...] "Storm" [...] was originally written by Wade at the age of sixteen, when he was going through difficult times. When asked about the song in an interview, Wade said, [...] "That was fun to record because of its starkness. We love the idea of the title, surrounded by negative space, like the a cappella beginning. Because when you’re lost in confusion, no matter how much is going on around you, you’re still alone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You know my daughter," [...] she said. [...] "Will you {{excuse me}} just a minute? I'm so very sorry." [...] She glided towards the door, and threw a flying look back. It was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> social <b>moments</b> {{precious}} to <b>those</b> who are escaping them.|$|R
60|$|He was at <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> lawless <b>moments</b> {{which come}} to us all if we have no guide but desire, and if the pathway where desire leads us seems {{suddenly}} closed; {{he was ready to}} follow any beckoning that offered him an immediate purpose.|$|R
5000|$|... "At {{that time}} I was hosting the breakfast show on 702 ABC Sydney. It was {{obviously}} a legitimate news story, so I lined up an interview with my father… It was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the highlights of my career and <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> special <b>moments</b> that I {{know a lot of}} listeners remember".|$|R
2500|$|On 2 January 2016 {{a feature}} {{article on the}} BBC News website opened with the words: [...] "It was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>moments</b> when the whole world seems to care." [...] It went on to quote Alan Kurdi's aunt Tima Kurdi: ...|$|E
2500|$|Paul McCartney also {{remembered the}} event for an interview: [...] " [...] said, 'We should go down there. We should go down now {{and just do}} it.' It was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>moments</b> where we said, 'Let's not and say we did.' [...] " ...|$|E
2500|$|Tom Breihan of Pitchfork Media {{selected}} [...] "Someone like You" [...] as {{a song of}} the day, {{claiming it}} served as a reaffirmation of popular music: [...] "Sometimes, pop music can still break your heart." [...] Writing for BBC Online, Ian Wade noted that the [...] "final track Someone Like You, just voice and piano, is an actual thing of beauty, placing the listener in <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>moments</b> where you feel you're {{in the presence of}} a future standard." [...] Bill Lamb of About.com wrote that [...] "the piano melody is gorgeous and combined with Adele's heartfelt reading of her words, the effect is highly emotional. You can imagine it being both honked through by talent show contestants and transcended by veterans alike." [...] Lamb went to write that the song is one of the [...] "top songs of 2011" [...] and that [...] "romantic pain has rarely been so utterly beautiful." [...] Jer Fairall of PopMatters called the song an [...] "absolute magic" [...] and praised Adele's performance by saying, [...] "Though it is unquestionably her finest vocal showcase to date, it is less remarkable for its more powerful moments than for the small ones where her voice dips, with rueful melancholy on the line 'I heard that your dreams came true' or cracks on the 'I beg' in the chorus, like she's startled at the revelation of her own vulnerability." [...] He further called her vocal performance of the song [...] "stunning" [...] and [...] "finally worthy of her talents".|$|E
5000|$|The {{song was}} {{described}} as a [...] "heartfelt piece of self-assessment". Tunstall explained to MusicRemedy.com that the lyrics of this song are some of her most personal. [...] "It's <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> rare <b>moments</b> where you can see yourself objectively and look into your own emotional machinery and realize what you are." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{had begun}} to think with a curious coolness. His {{detachment}} surprised him. It was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> rare <b>moments</b> in a man's life when, from the outside, through a breach in that wall of excuses and self-deception {{which he has been}} at such pains to build, he looks at himself impartially.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm very glad," [...] Hodder replied, gravely. It was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> {{compensating}} <b>moments,</b> for him, {{when his}} tribulations vanished; and the tributes {{of the younger}} generation were those to which his heart most freely responded. But the situation, in view of the attitude of Francis Ferguson, was too delicate to be dwelt upon.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{suddenly}} she fell mute, and glancing {{down at her}} face, I read in an instant the thing she had thought to do. It was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>moments</b> when one sees.|$|E
6000|$|... "You see," [...] he went on, his {{own voice}} a little unsteady, [...] "this is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>moments</b> in both our lives when {{anything}} except the exact truth would mean shipwreck. You still love your husband?" ...|$|E
60|$|Young Staunton {{was about}} to speak, but it was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>moments</b> when those, who, like Jeanie Deans, possess the {{advantage}} of a steady courage and unruffled temper, can assume the superiority over more ardent but less determined spirits.|$|E
5000|$|By the mid-1950s, Wilson was {{increasingly}} focusing on producing expressionist landscapes. Of this period, Wilson said: [...] "In 1956 and 7, I {{found myself in}} <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> lucid <b>moments</b> that occurs every twenty years and I realized I wasn't a second generation Abstract Expressionist. I looked at the ingredients of what I was painting and felt an uncontrollable allegiance to subject matter, and to landscape in particular." ...|$|R
60|$|Poor child! it {{was very}} early for her to know <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> supreme <b>moments</b> in life when all we have hoped or delighted in, all we can dread or endure, falls away from our regard as insignificant; is lost, like a trivial memory, in that simple, {{primitive}} love which knits us to the beings who have been nearest to us, in their times of helplessness or of anguish.|$|R
60|$|Ed Linton was a short, heavy man, and his stocky build gave {{evidence}} of considerable strength. His former strokes {{had not been}} made {{at the expense of}} exertion, but now he got ready for a supreme effort. A sudden silence clamped down upon the exuberant cowboys. It was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> fateful <b>moments</b> when the air was charged with disaster. As Ed swung the club it fairly whistled.|$|R
60|$|The {{rain was}} dashing against the window-panes {{as if an}} angry spirit were within it, and behind it was the great swoop of the wind; it was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>moments</b> in which both the busy and the idle pause with a certain awe.|$|E
60|$|That {{instant of}} indecision {{on the part}} of Cap secured the triumph of Jasper. Looking at the Sergeant, the young man {{received}} a nod that assured him of all he asked, and he lost not <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>moments</b> that were getting to be so very precious.|$|E
60|$|At <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>moments,</b> a voice {{which she}} had not yet {{distinguished}} addressed her in the Anglo-Norman language, and asked, with apparent interest, if she sat safely on her saddle, offering {{at the same time}} to have her accoutrements altered at her pleasure and convenience.|$|E
60|$|With Mrs. Morel it was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> still <b>moments</b> {{when the}} small frets vanish, {{and the beauty}} of things stands out, and she had the peace and the {{strength}} to see herself. Now and again, a swallow cut close to her. Now and again, Annie came up with a handful of alder-currants. The baby was restless on his mother's knee, clambering with his hands at the light.|$|R
60|$|During <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> waking <b>moments,</b> Joe {{heard a sound}} which rooted him to {{his seat}} with horror; and would doubtless have caused his hair to stand on end, if the helmet would have allowed it. The sound was simple enough in itself, however; being slight, slow, and regular, and was only horrible in Joe's mind, because of his being utterly unable to account for it, or to {{conceive}} what it could be.|$|R
60|$|Monsieur le Duc {{must have}} {{raised his voice}} more than he intended, or else perhaps there had {{occurred}} quite suddenly in the crowd of sympathizers, that now stood in a dense group round Madame de Stainville, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> inevitable <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> complete silence when angels {{are said to be}} fluttering round the room. Certain it is that Monsieur le Duc's words sang out somewhat loudly, and were heard by those whose names had been on his lips.|$|R
60|$|The {{gloom and}} reticence of those dark-green forests had wrought {{him into the}} reticent, serious man he was. He was not gloomy naturally, he was strong and hopeful, but this was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>moments</b> which appall a man, even a young man--or more properly, {{especially}} a young man.|$|E
60|$|I {{turned on}} the goad-bearer behind me with a swift {{threatening}} gesture, and he started back. This and Cavor's sudden shout and leap clearly astonished all the Selenites. They receded hastily, facing us. For <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>moments</b> that seem to last for ever, we stood in angry protest, with a scattered semicircle of these inhuman beings about us.|$|E
60|$|Clementina and the Vice-Consul {{afterwards}} {{agreed that}} Mrs. Lander must have sent {{the will to}} Mr. Orson in <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>moments</b> of suspicion when she distrusted everyone about her, or in that trouble concerning her husband's kindred which had grown upon her more and more, {{as a means of}} assuring them that they were provided for.|$|E
60|$|They {{were walking}} hand in hand, {{looking at each}} other; Maggie, indeed, was hurrying along, for she felt it time to be gone. But the sense that their parting was near made her more anxious lest she should have unintentionally left some painful {{impression}} on Philip's mind. It was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> dangerous <b>moments</b> when speech is at once sincere and deceptive; when feeling, rising high above its average depth, leaves floodmarks which are never reached again.|$|R
5000|$|AllMusic {{awarded the}} album 5 stars stating [...] "Joe Williams' debut as the {{featured}} vocalist in Count Basie's band was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> landmark <b>moments</b> that even savvy observers don't fully appreciate when it occurs, then realize years later how momentous an event they witnessed. Williams brought a different presence {{to the great}} Basie orchestra than the one Jimmy Rushing provided; he couldn't shout like Rushing, but he was more effective on romantic and sentimental material, while he was almost as spectacular on surging blues, up-tempo wailers, and stomping standards".|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{was writing}} in my journal I always carry. It’s {{a funny thing}} because that journal entry has kind of grown into {{a life of its}} own because people don’t know if I was writing a play, story, script, or a movie scene, but it was real. It was mostly truly inspiring. It was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> trippy <b>moments.</b> People were {{screaming}} and it was getting crazy, and in that moment I thought I was going to name it [...] "11:59". That’s where the inspiration came." [...] -Ryan Star ...|$|R
