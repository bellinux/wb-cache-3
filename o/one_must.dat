Once that task is done, all {{the properties of}} real addition follow immediately from the properties of rational numbers. Furthermore, the other arithmetic operations, including multiplication, have straightforward, analogous definitions.|$|E
5|$|Alternate {{theories}} of self-defence, inspired by Ahimsa, build principles similar to {{theories of}} just war. Aikido, pioneered in Japan, illustrates one such principles of self-defence. Morihei Ueshiba, {{the founder of}} Aikido, described his inspiration as Ahimsa. According to this interpretation of Ahimsa in self-defence, <b>one</b> <b>must</b> not assume {{that the world is}} free of aggression. <b>One</b> <b>must</b> presume that some people will, out of ignorance, error or fear, attack other persons or intrude into their space, physically or verbally. The aim of self-defence, suggested Ueshiba, must be to neutralise the aggression of the attacker, and avoid the conflict. The best defence is one where the victim is protected, as well as the attacker is respected and not injured if possible. Under Ahimsa and Aikido, there are no enemies, and appropriate self-defence focuses on neutralising the immaturity, assumptions and aggressive strivings of the attacker.|$|E

5|$|Among {{both the}} Maguindanao and the Maranao, the agung embodies {{all that is}} {{masculine}} and thus the agung is traditionally considered a masculine instrument. To be considered a good player, <b>one</b> <b>must</b> possess strength, stamina (playing extremely fast tempos with no mistakes) and endurance. Players must also exhibit improvisation skills for different patterns to be considered as having quality musicianship—lest the audience considers the patterns played repetitions and mundane.|$|E
5|$|Chapter 10 states {{meditation}} practice perfects one's {{ability to}} concentrate, wherein the object one concentrates on becomes {{the one of}} attachment, of oneness and one feels one's identity with it. Verses 10.6–15 suggest that <b>one</b> <b>must</b> concentrate on self as the supreme self, oneness with Brahman in everything, and this process of attachment of one's individual self to the supreme self leads to oneness and liberation.|$|E
5|$|DST {{inherits}} and can magnify {{the disadvantages}} of standard time. For example, when reading a sundial, <b>one</b> <b>must</b> compensate for {{it along with}} time zone and natural discrepancies. Also, sun-exposure guidelines such as avoiding the sun within two hours of noon become less accurate when DST is in effect.|$|E

5|$|However, the PlayStation 2 version {{does not}} include this {{challenge}} feature. Rather than doing the challenges to unlock avatars/content, all <b>one</b> <b>must</b> do is complete the gig by successfully completing all songs. Not all gigs have content to unlock, rather just those to which a particular unlockable applies (for example the Johnny Cash gig allows Johnny Cash to be unlocked as a playable avatar).|$|E
5|$|If {{consciousness}} (the mind) {{can exist}} independently of physical reality (the brain), <b>one</b> <b>must</b> explain how physical memories are created concerning consciousness. Dualism must therefore explain how consciousness affects physical reality. One {{possible explanation is}} that of a miracle, proposed by Arnold Geulincx and Nicolas Malebranche, where all mind–body interactions require the direct intervention of God.|$|E
5|$|In {{the world}} of Hibiki's Magic, {{in order to gain}} magic <b>one</b> <b>must</b> make a sacrifice. It can be a {{physical}} sacrifice, such as Ahito experiencing pain, or a mental sacrifice, such as Shirotsuki losing his memories. Hibiki tries to help by making the sacrifices a little more bearable.|$|E

5|$|In verse 11, {{the text}} makes a {{reference}} to a fragment from section 1.14 of the Shvetashvatara Upanishad, to metaphorically describe how to gain this knowledge. Making his own soul as the lower fire stick and Om the upper fire stick, states the Kaivalya Upanishad, <b>one</b> <b>must</b> rub these together, light up the fire of knowledge, and burn the ties to ignorance.|$|E
5|$|Once granted, {{a coat of}} arms {{becomes the}} {{hereditary}} and inheritable property of the owner and his descendants. However, this can only be so if the inheritor is a legitimate male-line descendent of the person originally granted with the arms. To establish the right to arms by descent, <b>one</b> <b>must</b> {{be able to prove}} that an ancestor had his arms recorded in the registers of the College. If there is a possibility of such an inheritance, <b>one</b> <b>must</b> first make contact with an officer-in-waiting at the College, who could then advise on the course of action and the cost of such a search. The research into a descent of arms requires details of paternal ancestry, which will involve the examination of genealogical records. The first step involve a search of the family name in the College's archives, as coats of arms and family name has no connection, the officer could prove, through this method, that there is in fact no descent. However, if a connection is found a genealogical research outside of the College's archives would then be undertaken to provide definitive evidence of descent from an armigerous individual.|$|E
5|$|One notable {{feature of}} string theory and M-theory {{is that these}} {{theories}} require extra dimensions of spacetime for their mathematical consistency. In string theory, spacetime is ten-dimensional (nine spatial dimensions, and one time dimension), while in M-theory it is eleven-dimensional (ten spatial dimensions, and one time dimension). In order to describe real physical phenomena using these theories, <b>one</b> <b>must</b> therefore imagine scenarios in which these extra dimensions would not be observed in experiments.|$|E

5|$|The Kurisu Makise Ending {{follows a}} similar {{route to the}} True End. To achieve this ending, <b>one</b> <b>must</b> have had several conversations with Kurisu {{throughout}} the game.

5|$|The {{objective}} {{of the game is}} to guide a group of anthropomorphised lemmings through a number of obstacles to a designated exit. To save the required number of lemmings to win, <b>one</b> <b>must</b> determine how to assign a limited number of eight different skills to specific lemmings that allow the selected lemming to alter the landscape, to affect the behaviour of other lemmings, or to clear obstacles to create a safe passage {{for the rest of the}} lemmings.|$|E
5|$|The text then iconographically paints god Shiva, {{as the one}} who is the {{companion}} of Uma, with three eyes, blue neck, the calm wonderful lord imbued with intelligence and bliss, the source of everything.

5|$|A common {{interpretation}} of Either/Or presents {{the reader with}} a choice between two approaches to life. There are no standards or guidelines which indicate how to choose. The reasons for choosing an ethical way of life over the aesthetic only make sense if one is already committed to an ethical way of life. Suggesting the aesthetic approach as evil implies one has already accepted {{the idea that there}} is a good/evil distinction to be made. Likewise, choosing an aesthetic way of life only appeals to the aesthete, ruling Judge Vilhelm's ethics as inconsequential and preferring the pleasures of seduction. Thus, existentialists see Victor Eremita as presenting a radical choice in which no pre-ordained value can be discerned. <b>One</b> <b>must</b> choose, and through one's choices, one creates what one is.|$|E
5|$|About {{a talent}} for composition... I can say nothing as yet. You have tried your powers too little... Yes, one can study on one's own. Sometimes one needs advice, but <b>one</b> <b>must</b> study... All of us, that is, I myself and Borodin, and Balakirev, and {{especially}} Cui and Mussorgsky, did disdain these things. I consider myself lucky that I bethought myself in time and forced myself to work. As for Balakirev, owing to his insufficient technique he writes little; Borodin, with difficulty; Cui, carelessly; and Mussorgsky, sloppily and often incoherently.|$|E
