5|$|The Chng Suan Tze {{decision}} is more notable {{for the issues}} that the Court of Appeal discussed obiter dicta, having already allowed the appeals {{on the ground that}} the respondents had not discharged their burden <b>of</b> <b>proving</b> the President's satisfaction.|$|E
5|$|When the {{question}} of whether a person is alive or dead arises, and it is shown that he was alive within 30 years, the burden <b>of</b> <b>proving</b> {{that he or she is}} dead lies on the person who affirms it. However, if it is proved that he or she has not been heard of for seven years by those who would naturally have heard of the person if he or she had been alive, the burden <b>of</b> <b>proving</b> that the person is alive shifts to the person who affirms this.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Bethe {{also played}} an {{important}} role in the development of the hydrogen bomb, though he had originally joined the project with the hope <b>of</b> <b>proving</b> it could not be made. Bethe later campaigned with Albert Einstein and the Emergency Committee of Atomic Scientists against nuclear testing and the nuclear arms race. He helped persuade the Kennedy and Nixon administrations to sign, respectively, the 1963 Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (SALT I).|$|E
50|$|The term 1P is {{frequently}} used to denote proved reserves; 2P {{is the sum}} <b>of</b> <b>proved</b> and probable reserves; and 3P the sum <b>of</b> <b>proved,</b> probable, and possible reserves. The best estimate of recovery from committed projects is {{generally considered to be}} the 2P sum <b>of</b> <b>proved</b> and probable reserves. Note that these volumes only refer to currently justified projects or those projects already in development.|$|R

5|$|An {{applicant}} has {{the burden}} <b>of</b> <b>proving</b> that a legislative restriction on {{the freedom of}} speech {{has nothing to do with}} public order, public health or morality. There must be some substance in the applicant's complaint – the Government does not have an immediate duty to justify making a decision that restricts the applicant's right to freedom of speech simply because the applicant complains of an alleged infringement of Article 15(1).|$|E
5|$|In Multani v. Marguerite-Bourgeoys (Commission scolaire) (2006), {{the issue}} was whether a ban {{in a public school}} on Sikh {{students}} carrying kirpans (ceremonial daggers) for religious purposes was justifiable. Justice Louise Charron, who delivered the Court's majority opinion, applied the Oakes test to section 2(a) of the Charter. She held that the school could not discharge its burden <b>of</b> <b>proving</b> that prohibiting the kirpan was a reasonable limit on the student's constitutional freedom of religion.|$|E
5|$|A {{somewhat}} similar hypothesis was advanced by astronomer John J. Matese of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette in 2002. He contends that more comets are {{arriving in the}} inner Solar System from a particular region of the postulated Oort cloud than {{can be explained by}} the galactic tide or stellar perturbations alone, and that the most likely cause would be a Jupiter-mass object in a distant orbit. This hypothetical gas giant was nicknamed Tyche. The WISE mission, an all-sky survey using parallax measurements in order to clarify local star distances, was capable <b>of</b> <b>proving</b> or disproving the Tyche hypothesis. In 2014, NASA announced that the WISE survey had ruled out any object as they had defined it.|$|E

5|$|Culturally, Black Sabbath have exerted a huge {{influence}} in both television and literature and have {{in many cases}} become synonymous with heavy metal. In the film Almost Famous, Lester Bangs gives the protagonist an assignment to cover the band (plot point one) with the immortal line: 'Give me 500 words on Black Sabbath'. Contemporary music and arts publication Trebuchet Magazine has put this to practice by asking all new writers to write a short piece (500 words) on Black Sabbath as a means <b>of</b> <b>proving</b> their creativity and voice on a well documented subject.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the end of}} its life, {{there were}} plans for private {{interests}} to purchase Mir, possibly for use as the first orbital television/movie studio. The privately funded Soyuz TM-30 mission by MirCorp, launched on 4 April 2000, carried two crew members, Sergei Zalyotin and Aleksandr Kaleri, to the station for two months to do repair work with the hope <b>of</b> <b>proving</b> that the station could be made safe. This was to be the last manned mission to Mir—while Russia was optimistic about Mir future, its commitments to the International Space Station project left no funding to support the aging station.|$|E
5|$|Non-citizens {{detained}} {{under the}} ISA {{do not have}} a right to make representations to an advisory board. They may, within two months from the date of the detention order, make written representations to the Minister. The Minister may, but is not bound to, refer the representations to an advisory board. Any decision on such representations by the Minister is final and cannot be called into question in any court. The burden <b>of</b> <b>proving</b> that a person is a citizen lies on the person claiming to be one, and again the Minister's decision on the matter is final.|$|E

5|$|Another {{application}} of such chain conditions is in Noetherian induction—also known as well-founded induction—which is a generalization of mathematical induction. It frequently {{is used to}} reduce general statements about collections of objects to statements about specific objects in that collection. Suppose that S is a partially ordered set. One way <b>of</b> <b>proving</b> a statement about the objects of S is to assume {{the existence of a}} counterexample and deduce a contradiction, thereby proving the contrapositive of the original statement. The basic premise of Noetherian induction is that every non-empty subset of S contains a minimal element. In particular, the set of all counterexamples contains a minimal element, the minimal counterexample. In order to prove the original statement, therefore, it suffices to prove something seemingly much weaker: For any counterexample, there is a smaller counterexample.|$|E
5|$|Moyer, who {{had never}} argued before the Supreme Court, {{continued}} to represent Jacobson (who was in the audience). In his brief and at oral argument, he said that a mere stated interest in sex among young men did not rise to a level <b>of</b> <b>proving</b> predisposition, {{that the government should}} have had evidence in hand that Jacobson was actually willing to break the law to do so. (Kenneth Starr, then Solicitor General, had maintained in the government's brief opposing certiorari that his prior purchase of the Bare Boys magazines was all the proof it needed, even if the action were legal at the time.) Pressed on other undercover investigative techniques, he admitted that a government-run pawn shop would be a permissible way to apprehend thieves despite a lack of evidence of predisposition because the crimes might well have occurred prior to any contact with the government or its operatives.|$|E
5|$|In Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs (1988), the appellants {{had been}} {{detained}} without trial under section 8(1) of the Internal Security Act ("ISA") for alleged {{involvement in a}} Marxist conspiracy to subvert and destabilize the country. The detention orders were subsequently suspended under section 10 of the Act, but the suspensions were revoked following {{the release of a}} press statement by the appellants in which they denied being Marxist conspirators. Having applied unsuccessfully to the High Court for writs of habeas corpus to be issued, the appellants appealed against the ruling. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal on the narrow ground that the Government had not adduced sufficient evidence to discharge its burden <b>of</b> <b>proving</b> the President was satisfied that the appellants' detention was necessary to prevent them from endangering, among other things, Singapore's security or public order, which was required by section 8(1) of the ISA before the Minister for Home Affairs could make detention orders against them. However, in a lengthy obiter discussion, the Court held that an objective rather than a subjective test should apply to the exercise of discretion by the authorities under sections 8 and 10 of the ISA. In other words, the executive could not insist that the exercise of the discretion was unchallengeable. The exercise of discretion could be reviewed by the court, and the executive had to satisfy the court that there were objective facts justifying its decision.|$|E
