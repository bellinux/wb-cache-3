40|$|Analyses {{carried out}} on benthonic foraminiferal assemblages of the Puentedey-Hornillalatorre {{formations}} (Norcastilian Platform) {{are part of a}} multidisciplinary research with the main subject of understanding the palaeoceanographic events that took place {{at the end of the}} Cretaceous within the Basque-Cantabrian Basin. The study sections have been dated from the late Cenomanian to the late Turonian. A total of 98 benthonic species have been identified, which clearly correspond to shallow marine water microfauna. In this context, some of the aspects about the palaeoenvironmental variations detected in Puentedey-Santelices area are crucially provided by changes of the foraminiferal assemblages (Units 1 to 3), specific diversity changes of the microfauna, the rate between different type of tests of benthonic, percentage of keeled, incipiently keeled and globular planktonic foraminifera and <b>oceanicity</b> index. Thus, the dominant foraminiferal assemblages, the great percentage of agglutinated tests, and the lower values of the <b>oceanicity</b> index suggest a cool, acid, and bad-oxygenated internal platform (< 100 m) waters palaeoenvironment (Units 1 - 2). The inoceramid bivalves I. (Mytiloides), with thinner shells and grey colour are well-developed. The Unit 3, marked by oxygenated internal platform waters palaeoenvironment, where I.

40|$|The term “heterotopic” {{was applied}} to {{phytogeography}} referring to those populations found on soils apparently different from those typically occurring across the distribution range of a given species. In Italy, it was also applied to European beech populations generally occurring at an altitude below 800 m a. s. l. Based on a multivariate analysis using climatic and altitudinal data, we propose a method to apply reliably this concept to the European beech occurring in peninsular Italy and Sicily. Our results suggest that beech populations located at an altitude ≤ 600 m a. s. l. {{can be defined as}} “quantitatively heterotopic” in Italy. These populations mainly occur on the Tyrrhenian side, marked by high <b>oceanicity.</b> Most of them are located outside of the natural vegetation series with European beech and, some are more than 20 km outside. Our method could be applied to other species in order to quantify the level of heterotopy by defining ad hoc thresholds, resulting from multivariate analysis...|$|E
40|$|Small peat basins (c. 10 - 50 in diameter) {{were used}} to obtain fine spatial {{resolution}} pollen-stratigraphic records of Holocene vegetation and land-use history in upland West Glen Affric and adjacent lowland Kintail, north-westem Scottish Highlands. These data provide evidence for remarkably diverse and dynamic early to mid-Holocene vegetational mosaic and sustained later Holocene upland land-use. While acidophilous Pinus sylvestris-Betula-Calluna vulgaris communities on lower hillslopes appear comparable with {{other areas of the}} Highlands, data from floodplain and alluvial fan sediments in West Affric indicate a greater woodland diversity. Befula-dominated alluvial woods included a species-rich mix of arboreal, fen, tall-herb and ruderal herbaceous taxa, with Pinus forming small populations, confined to marginal soils. Uhnus was {{an important component of the}} lowland Betula-Alnus woods. Spatial differences in soil forining processes, particularly nutrient and base status, played a primary role in determining community composition, structure, dynamics, species diversity and stability.

The statistical synthesis of selected oceanographic parameters (SST, SST anomalies, boundary heat exchanges, etc.) over a specified {{period of time}} at a given place or over a given area is defined as ocean "Hydroclimate". Research and etymological background leading {{to the adoption of}} the term hydroclimate is discussed. Oceanic influence on atmospheric climate is described. In particular, the ocean's role within the earth's hydrologic cycle and heat budget is explained through hydrospheric, lithospheric, and atmospheric interactions, as related to SST distributions, ocean currents, upwelling, sea-breezes, and monsoons. SST anomalies as a cause of short period climatic variations are examined. The deep-sea sediment record of past SST conditions is shown to indicate past effects of the ocean on climate. A previously defined numerical index describing <b>oceanicity,</b> a quantitative measure of the ocean's effect on climate, is reviewed. An evaluation of hydroclimatic products most useful to meteorologists was prepared and includes a categorized list and individual evaluations of 62 hydroclimatic products.

40|$|Pemba {{is thought}} to have had a longer and/or {{stronger}} history of isolation than its better-known counterpart, Unguja. The extent to which the biota support this hypothesis of greater <b>oceanicity</b> have been debated. Here, Pemba’s terrestrial mollusc (“land-snail”) fauna is surveyed and reviewed for the first time. We find at best equivocal evidence for the following hallmarks of greater oceanicity: impoverishment, imbalance, and a high rate of endemism. At least 49 species are present, families are represented in typical proportions, and there are only between two and four island-endemic species - i. e. a 4 % to 8 % rate of endemism. For land-snails, isolation thus seems to have been short (Pleistocene) or, if longer, weak. Nevertheless, Pemba does host endemic and globally rare species. Forty-five percent of the species found, including most of these, is restricted to forest reserves, with Ngezi Forest Reserve particularly rich. A further 45 % are able to tolerate the island’s woody cultivated habitats. One new snail species (Cyclophoridae: Cyathopoma) and one new slug species (Urocyclidae: Dendrolimax pro tem.) are described. New data and illustrations are provided for other taxa...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{effects of climate}} on tree growth of the {{dominating}} conifer species, Picea abies (L) Karst. (Norway spruce) and Pinus sylvestris L (Scots pine), in central Norway and Fennoscandia. Both species are sampled along major environmental gradients, i. e. altitude and <b>oceanicity,</b> and growth responses to climate, i. e. temperature and precipitation, are examined along these gradients. Additionally, time is considered as an environmental gradient and temporal responses are carefully deciphered. Special attention is given to large-scale climate oscillation and their effect on tree growth. In the individual papers the specific aims have been to: 1. identify climate variables (all seasons) with significant influence on radial tree growth of P. abies and P. sylvestris along major environmental gradients (Paper I-IV) 2. identify if and how the growth response to climate {{has changed through time}} along these gradients (Paper I-IV) 3. make interregional comparisons of P. sylvestris growth pattern across Fennoscandia from oceanic western Norway to continental eastern Finland (Paper III) 4. analyse to what degree large-scale circulation patterns of air masses are registered in regional tree growth of both P. abies and P. sylvestris (Paper I, III and IV) 5. discuss possible effects on radial tree growth of a predicted warmer climate (Paper I, III and IV) dr. scient. dr. scient...|$|E

Comparison of the d 18 OP history with a pollen-based palaeotemperature record from the same core clearly reveals pronounced deviations from the normally expected temporal d 18 OP-temperature relation (so-called ‘Dansgaard relation’) {{that may be a}} function of changing <b>oceanicity.</b> The transition from relatively moist, maritime conditions in the early Holo cene to a much drier climate after 6500 cal.

40|$|The plant macrofossil {{records from}} three raised bogs from western and central Ireland and from Cumbria were {{compared}} to investigate variations in the character and timing of the fen-bog transition (FBT). Two modes of raised or ombrotrophic peat formation were recognized. In the first mode the transition develops through a sedge-fen stage directly to raised-bog lawn, maintaining a near surface water table throughout the FBT (Abbeyknockmoy Bog). The second mode {{is characterized by a}} switch from fen or reedswamp to a dry Eriophorum-dominated mire type, suggestive of low or unstable water tables (Mongan Bog and Bolton Fell Moss). Comparisons with the Holocene effective precipitation record suggest that the type of transition and its timing may be affected by the prevailing climate regime. All that is required for ombrotrophy is a separation of the growing peat surface from the influence of ground and surface waters. This separation may be achieved by rapid peat accumulation in a moist climate, the accumulation of decay-resistant Eriophorum vaginatum hummocks or by a lowering of the water table, leading to a 'perched peat bed'. In the latter two cases, a 'pseudo-raised bog' community often persists, laying down highly humified peat, until increased <b>oceanicity</b> enables Sphagnum to dominate...|$|E
40|$|The Brazilian Atlantic {{rainforest}} {{consists of}} a typical tropical rainforest on mountain slopes, and stands out as a biodiversity hotspot for its high species richness and high level of species endemism. This forest is bordered by plant communities with lower species diversity, due mostly to more extreme environmental conditions than {{those found in the}} mesic rainforest. Between the mountain slopes and the sea, the coastal plains have swamp forests, dry semi-deciduous forests and open thicket vegetation on marine sand deposits. At the other extreme, on top of the mountains (> 2000 m a. s. l.), the rainforest is substituted by high altitude ®elds and open thicket vegetation on rocky outcrops. Thus, the plant communities that are marginal to the rainforest are subjected either to ¯ooding, drought, <b>oceanicity</b> or cold winter temperatures. It was found that positive interactions among plants {{play an important role in}} the structuring and functioning of a swamp forest, a coastal sandy vegetation and a cold, high altitude vegetation in the state of Rio de Janeiro. Moreover, only a few species seem to adopt this positive role and, therefore, the functioning of these entire systems may rely on them. Curiously, these nurse plants are often epiphytes in the rainforest, and at the study sites are typically terrestrial. Many exhibit crassulacean acid metabolism.

40|$|Analyses {{carried out}} on benthonic foraminiferal assemblages of the Barrika section (Basque Arc) {{are part of a}} {{multidisciplinary}} research with the main subject of understanding the palaeoceanographic events that took place {{at the end of the}} Cretaceous within the Basque Basin. The Barrika section has been dated as uppermost early Santonian-upper Santonian by means of the planktonic species Dicarinella concavata and Dicarinella asymetrica. It is additionally confirmed by the detection of benthonic species such as Eponides concinna, Vemeuilina muensteri, Tritaxia capitosa, and Reussella szajnochae praecursor. A total of 130 benthonic species have been identified, which clearly correspond to deep marine water microfauna, except that from shallow waters at the top of the section. In this context, some of the aspects about the palaeoenvironmental variations detected in Barrika section are crucially provided by qualitative and quantitative changes of the foraminiferal assemblages, specific diversity changes of the microfauna, and both the rate between different kinds of benthonic wall structures, and the ratio between benthonics and planktonics. Thus, the dominant foraminiferal assemblages, the great percentage of agglutinated tests, and the high values of the <b>oceanicity</b> index suggest a cool well-oxygenated bathyal waters palaeoenvironment for most of the section. However, the top of the section is particularly marked by a relative sea-level fall, that could reach its maximum at the end of the Santonian, producing a dramatic change to an internal platform palaeoenvironment. This event may have probably been the response to the global regression occurred at 85 M. a...|$|E
40|$|Modern {{climate in}} western Norway shows a strong west–east {{gradient}} in oceanicity–continentality (coast to inner fjord) and altitudinal temperature gradients {{that control the}} regional and altitudinal zonation of vegetation. To discover if similar gradients existed during the Lateglacial and early Holocene, plant-macrofossil analyses were made from five lacustrine sediment sequences in the Nordfjord–A˚ lesund region selected to sample the present climatic gradients. The macrofossil assemblages {{could be interpreted as}} analogues of the present vegetation, thus allowing reconstruction of past vegetation and climates. When the five sites were compared, climatic gradients could be detected. During the Lateglacial interstadial, mid-alpine assemblages with Salix herbacea and S. polaris occurred at the lowland coast and upland inland sites, whereas the inland lowland site had low-alpine dwarf-shrub heath dominated by Betula nana, demonstrating a strong west–east gradient in temperature and precipitation and an altitudinal gradient inland. During the Younger Dryas stadial, assemblages at the lowland coast and upland inland sites resembled high-alpine vegetation, whereas the inland lowland site was warmer with mid-alpine vegetation, demonstrating west–east and altitudinal temperature gradients. Gradients became less pronounced in the Holocene. The early abundance of Betula nana in the inner fjord sites but its rarity at the coast is striking and reflects the <b>oceanicity</b> gradient. All sites became forested with Betula pubescens a few centuries into the Holocene. This forest was probably close to tree line at 370 m a. s. l. at the coast. Inland, there was no detectable altitudinal gradient, with the tree line well above 400 m a. s. l. reflecting the present pattern of tree-line elevation...|$|E
40|$|Long-term {{data are}} {{valuable}} for detecting changes in vegetation composition, and investigating how vegetation {{is responding to}} environmental change.   We use a range of approaches to quantify, characterise and interpret vegetation change in upland plant communities of the Scottish Highlands by comparing two datasets, collected in 1956 - 58 and 2007 - 08, on the species composition of representative plots in major vegetation types in the North-West Highlands and the East Central Highlands.   Firstly, we validate the methodology used for relocating plots that were not permanently marked, by showing that temporal change is greater than local spatial heterogeneity in the vegetation.   The results show evidence of biotic homogenisation in the vegetation, manifested through declining plant diversity {{and an increase in}} generalist species, particularly graminoids, at the expense of specialists, particularly dwarf-shrubs, lichens and forbs.   Climate change in the form of increased <b>oceanicity,</b> and grazing were found to have been important in driving these changes, whereas nitrogen deposition had a smaller effect.   These data were also applied to two issues in nature conservation management, showing that protected area status had no effect on the magnitude of vegetation change, and that indicator species of the key drivers of change could be identified.   Finally, we show how long-term vegetation change data can be used in hypothesis formulation for experimental work, by carrying out an ex-situ manipulative experiment on an important upland graminoid species, Trichophorum germanicum.   This thesis incorporates examples of the wide range of ecological questions and analytical approaches that can be investigated through revisitation studies.

40|$|Pollen and plant-macrofossil {{data are}} {{presented}} for two lakes near the timberline in the Italian (Lago Basso, 2250 m) and Swiss Central Alps (Gouille Rion, 2343 m). The reforestation at both sites started at 9700 - 9500 BP with Pinus cembra, Larbc decidua, and Betula. The timberline reached its highest elevation between 8700 and 5000 BP and retreated after 5000 BP, {{due to a}} mid-Holocene climatic change and increasing human impact since about 3500 BP (Bronze Age). The expansion of Picea abies at Lago Basso between ca. 7500 and 6200 BP was probably favored by cold phases accompanied by increased <b>oceanicity,</b> whereas {{in the area of}} Gouille Rion, where spruce expanded rather late (between 4500 and 3500 BP), human influence equally might have been important. The mass expansion of Alnus viridis between ca. 5000 and 3500 BP probably can be related to both climatic change and human activity at timberline. During the early and middle Holocene a series of timberline fluctuations is recorded as declines in pollen and macrofossil concentrations of the major tree species, and as increases in nonarboreal pollen in the pollen percentage diagram of Gouille Rion. Most of ·the periods of low timberline can be correlated by radiocarbon dating with climatic changes in the Alps as indicated by glacier ad­ vances in combination with palynological records, solifluction, and dendrocli­ matical data. Lago Basso and Gouille Rion are the only sites in the Alps showing complete palaeobotanical records of cold phases between 10, 000 and 2000 BP with very good time control. The altitudinal range of the Holocene treeline fluc­ tuations caused by climate most likely was not more than 100 to 150 m. A possible correlation of a cold period at ca. 7500 - 6500 BP (Misox oscil­ lation) in the Alps is made with paleoecological data from North America and Scandinavia and a climatic signal in the GRIP ice core from central Greenland 8200 yr ago (ca. 7400 yr uncal.

40|$|During a mire {{vegetation}} study, conducted {{mainly in}} the subalpine-alpine sector of the Western Italian Alps, the ecology of several plant communities and numerous moss species {{of this kind of}} vegetation was evaluated. The study area covered the Piedmontese sector of the Graian Alps, the eastern sector of the Aosta Valley as well as certain localities of the Pennine Alps, the Canavese district and the Maritime Alps. They have a rocky substratum representative of the various regional lithologies and include the main sectors characterised by the highest precipitation. Three hundred and twenty two relevées were made using the phytosociological method and the pH and the conductivity of the water table and its depth were measured directly. Cluster Analysis allowed a classification of the samples and the identification of various groups of plant communities. Ordination performed by DCA and CCA allowed us to identify the ecological features of the various plant communities by using the values of the main environmental parameters, measured directly in the field, and certain climatic parameters (altitude and mean annual precipitation) available. The use of climatic parameters is an important result for identifying communities which show greater <b>oceanicity,</b> something that is underlined also by the presence of indicator species such as Sphagnum papillosum and S. subnitens. Furthermore the communities are arranged in a "poor-rich" gradient, and are also profoundly influenced by depth to water table which is inversely correlated to the pH. Therefore we find certain kinds of communities all with a very low water table and which are little affected by its chemistry. Other groups share the fact that the water table is outcropping or near the surface and are distinguishable for their pH values and conductivity. We discuss the different response of the bryophytes and vascular plants of these communities to the environmental parameters considered, in light of their anatomic and functional differences. Bryophytes are more sensitive to environmental and climatic parameters whilst vascular plants are mostly ubiquitous in the relevées with a greater ecological plasticity...|$|E
40|$|Small peat basins (c. 10 - 50 m diameter) {{were used}} to obtain fine spatial {{resolution}} pollen-stratigraphic records of Holocene vegetation and land-use history in upland West Glen Affric and adjacent lowland Kintail, north-western Scottish Highlands. These data provide evidence for remarkably diverse and dynamic early to mid-Holocene vegetational mosaic and sustained later Holocene upland land-use. While acidophilous Pinus sylvestris-Betula-Calluna vulgaris communities on lower hillslopes appear comparable with {{other areas of the}} Highlands, data from floodplain and alluvial fan sediments in West Affric indicate a greater woodland diversity. Betula-dominated alluvial woods included a species-rich mix of arboreal, fen, tall-herb and ruderal herbaceous taxa, with Pinus forming small populations, confined to marginal soils. Ulmus was {{an important component of the}} lowland Betula-Alnus woods. Spatial differences in soil forming processes, particularly nutrient and base status, played a primary role in determining community composition, structure, dynamics, species diversity and stability. Inferred climatic shifts during the mid-Holocene, initially to drier, more continental conditions, followed by increased <b>oceanicity,</b> are suggested to have made woodland communities increasingly vulnerable to low intensity grazing disturbance and anthropogenic interference during the later Neolithic and early Bronze Age. These stresses resulted in widespread woodland decline, including that of Pinus, with the spread of blanket peat and heath on poorer hillside soils, and grassland communities on alluvial sediment. Bronze Age agricultural expansion is followed by several phases of expansion and/or intensification, with sustained pastoral and arable activity in the lowlands and on small 'islands' of richer soils in the uplands. There is little evidence for abandonment and the longevity of agricultural activity, particularly cultivation, above 250 m OD clearly indicates that the unqualified assumption of upland marginality is inappropriate. The implications for the interpretation of land-use in the Highlands from conventional palynological and archaeological records are discussed. The level of spatial and temporal detail regarding the palaeoecology of plant communities and adaptive land management evident in the present study is not afforded by conventional pollen analyses. This suggests that fine-spatial resolution palynology has the potential to contribute previously unrecognised information at scales which are directly applicable to ecological and human understanding and which can be more successfully integrated with neoecological and archaeological research, fostering closer collaboration between the disciplines...|$|E
40|$|The moss Bartramia pomiformis, {{which has}} become very rare in Holland (see Fig. 1), was found in 12 localities in the sand dunes on the Isle of Texel. All localities are {{situated}} on steep, north-facing slopes that clearly showed terracing, which {{is caused by the}} activities of rabbits and grazing sheep. Bartramia grows on the steep banks of these terraces, in a vegetation that is dominated by bryophytes and lichens. Four releves of vegetations with Bartramia are presented in Table 1. It is pointed out that Bartramia requires a habitat that on the one hand offers sufficient protection against the desiccating influence of direct sunshine and wind, but which on the other hand still receives enough light to enable good growth of the moss. This kind of habitat is known as the ‘open shade’, which has been called ‘Blauschatten’ (‘blue shade’) by German workers, {{because of the fact that}} only diffuse, blue light, coming from the northern half of the sky, can reach such places. Since Bartramia typically occurs at such places as north facing slopes, wooded banks etc., and does not enter the deeper shade of the true forest, it can be regarded as a very good example of a ‘Blauschattenpflanze’. A remarkable feature of the vegetation of north facing slopes in the open dune landscape of the Wadden Sea Islands is the terrestrial occurrence of a number of bryophytes that are otherwise mainly restricted to woodlands in the Netherlands. Some of these also grow on the ground in woodlands, e. g. Hylocomium splendens and Rhytidiadelphus triquetrus, while others usually occur as epiphytes, e. g. Frullania tamarisci, Isothecium myosuroides, Dicranoweisia cirrata and Metzgeria furcata. The presence of such 'woodland bryophytes' as terrestrials in open dunes has in the past been regarded as the result of a presumed greater 'oceanicity' of the Islands, as compared with the interior. This supposition is probably wrong, since the climate on the islands is not significantly more oceanic than in the rest of Holland. Therefore the occurrence of these bryophytes must largely be attributed to the suitable microclimate that is offered on dune slopes, rather than to greater <b>oceanicity.</b> Finally some attention is paid to the disappearance of Bartramia pomiformis from many of its former localities. The decline of this moss in large parts of the Netherlands is probably connected to the effects of acid rain and the destruction of hedgebanks. The maintenance or reintroduction of sheep grazing as a management tool is recommended for the conservation of its localities, along with those of other interesting bryophytes, in dry sand dunes...|$|E
40|$|The term “heterotopic” (from the Greek roots "hetero-" meaning "other" + "topos" meaning "place" = other place) {{was used}} {{for the first time in}} biology by Haeckel (1) to define a change in germ-layer origin of {{reproductive}} organs in animals. Later, it was applied to phytogeography by Jackson (2), referring to those plant populations found on soils apparently very different from those typically occurring across their distribution range. In Italy, Negri (3) was likely the first to use this term referring to European beech (Fagus sylvatica L. subsp. sylvatica) populations occurring at low altitude. Since then, most of the further Italian authors used the term “heterotopic” mainly referring to beech or other woody species (i. e. Ilex aquifolium L., Quercus ilex L.) populations occurring out of their common altitudinal range or, in a broader sense, growing out of their typical macroclimatic context. Indeed, as regards European beech populations in Italy, those occurring below 800 m a. s. l. have been generally considered as heterotopic (4), even though in many cases stands above 800 m a. s. l. were also termed as “heterotopic” (e. g. 5, 6). Here, we highlight the need to quantify “heterotopy” and propose a standard method to test a reliable applicability of this concept. As model species, we selected the European beech in peninsular Italy and Sicily, primarily because this species is typically dominant in mountain woods in all the considered area and, historically, a number of stands have been reported as heterotopic in literature. We checked 18 bibliographic references reporting 108 populations as heterotopic (sometimes not explicitly, but with related terms like extra-zonal). We also randomly generated 305 points falling within the polygons of natural potential vegetation (7) with F. sylvatica, as provided by [URL] and considered them as controls. Both controls and putatively heterotopic populations were georeferenced by means of a GIS software. Climatic and altitudinal data associated with the occurrence sites were extracted from the Worldclim database (www. worldclim. org). We obtained a data matrix (413 beech stands × 6 environmental variables) that was subjected to a cluster analysis applying as the distance measure the Euclidean Distance and as group linkage method the Group Average (UPGMA), following the methodology commonly used in vegetation studies. Two main clusters were identified, with a dissimilarity index of 0. 35. The first cluster is composed by all those populations (including some control points) located at an altitude ≤ 600 m a. s. l., whereas the second one includes all the remaining points. The former cluster is also characterized by those populations growing on stands with a higher mean annual temperature than the latter (t-test, difference between means = 4. 09 °C, p < 0. 01). These results led us to define as “quantitatively heterotopic” in Italy those beech populations located at an altitude ≤ 600 m a. s. l., and with a mean annual temperature generally higher than 12 °C. They mainly occur on the Tyrrhenian side, namely in Tuscany and Lazio, marked by a high <b>oceanicity.</b> Many of these populations are located outside of vegetation series with European beech and, among these, some are distant more than 20 km, so that they could be interpreted not only as heterotopic, but also as biogeographical-ecological relicts (8). Our methodology could be applied to other species in order to quantify the level of heterotopy by defining ad hoc thresholds (if any), resulting from the multivariate analysis...|$|E
