5|$|The first {{discussion}} {{of improving the}} intersection and grade crossing was a study in 1898, since which there have been about three dozen more. The most recent, a 2009 study of the downtown area, examined the possibility of depressing Route 126 under the grade crossing and intersection {{as well as several}} <b>other</b> <b>alternatives</b> including bypasses. The Route 126 depression was deemed to create barriers to walkability downtown, and the recommended alternative was to depress Route 135 under the intersection to prevent it from being affected by trains passing through the grade crossing. Funds have not yet become available for final design and construction.|$|E
5|$|As {{both the}} <b>other</b> <b>alternatives</b> were discarded, {{consensus}} gradually grew for the Flåm alternative, and the Railway Committee for Nordre Bergenhus County recommended this proposal. New plans from NSB criticized {{the mix of}} rack and adhesion railway, and instead proposed a conventional adhesion line all the way. Engineer Ferdinand Bjerke traveled to Continental Europe to study several combined railways. He published a preliminary report in 1911, which recommended an adhesion railway, although he also felt {{the need for a}} detailed study of a rack railway. His final report was finished in 1913, and although it recommended adhesion, it pointed out that the line's capacity would be smaller than predicted and that costs would be three times as high—NOK5.5 million. The plans were approved by the Ministry of Labour and NSB's main board in 1915.|$|E

Depending on size, voltage, and designed life, small low-voltage halogen lamps can have 70% higher efficacy than large line-voltage lamps. The high operating temperature of halogen bulbs may be a safety hazard in some applications.|$|E
25|$|Strontium {{chloride}} {{is often}} used as a red colouring agent in pyrotechnics.

25|$|Providence was {{retired from}} regular service after the {{introduction}} of two new iron-hulled steamers, Puritan (1889) and Plymouth (1890), but was still used on occasion until Priscilla {{was added to the}} Fall River Line's fleet in 1894. Thereafter, Providence was only used when there were no <b>other</b> <b>alternatives.</b> Her last commercial voyages are believed to have occurred between December 1895 and early 1896, when she was called upon to operate for a few days when some of the regular steamers were temporarily out of commission.|$|E
