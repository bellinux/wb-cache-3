40|$|This {{empirical}} {{study investigated}} the occurrence <b>of</b> meaning <b>negotiation</b> in an interactive synchronous computer-mediated second language (L 2) environment. Sixteen dyads (N = 32) consisting of nonnative speakers (NNSs) and native speakers (NSs) of English performed 2 different tasks using videoconferencing and written chat. The data were coded and analyzed both for instances <b>of</b> <b>negotiation</b> <b>of</b> meaning and for instances where the NNSs did not initiate repair despite nonunderstanding. Absences <b>of</b> <b>negotiation</b> <b>of</b> meaning are generally excluded from detailed analysis primarily because {{it is difficult to}} establish nonunderstanding unless the participant overtly indicates it. In order to assess the effect of the nonoccurrence <b>of</b> <b>negotiation</b> <b>of</b> meaning on task performance and task completion, this study used 2 tasks: a culturally specific task that almost certainly would result in NNS nonunderstanding and a collaborative decision-making task that should trigger instances <b>of</b> <b>negotiation</b> <b>of</b> meaning. It was found that, in both tasks, instead of initiating repair sequences, NNS participants frequently did not engage in <b>negotiation</b> <b>of</b> meaning despite nonunderstanding. We conclude that disregarding nonoccurrence <b>of</b> <b>negotiation</b> <b>of</b> meaning in (digital) task-based language teaching may lead to misrepresenting task performance, task outcome, and task evaluation, and, beyond that, to disregarding evidence that has both empirical and theoretical consequences for the Interaction Hypothesis and, by implication, for second language acquisition...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2005. The study {{focuses on}} the use <b>of</b> <b>negotiation</b> skills as a {{managerial}} task of the school principal {{in order to reduce}} conflicts between teachers and between teachers and themselves, so as to enhance a good working interpersonal relationship between them. This will lead to the building of trust, professional development and success. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine through a literature study and empirical investigation, the nature <b>of</b> <b>negotiation</b> in schools and the skills used by principals when negotiating with teachers. The empirical investigation determined the skills used the most and least by principals when negotiating with teachers. Chapter 1 covered the statement of the problem, aims and methods to be used to obtain an overview of the nature <b>of</b> <b>negotiation.</b> This chapter also covers the empirical investigation which includes the questionnaire, population and sample, the statistical techniques. This chapter further covers the arrangement of chapters. Chapter 2 emphasises the nature <b>of</b> <b>negotiation</b> in general and in schools. The definition <b>of</b> <b>negotiation</b> and the concepts closely related to it are given in this chapter. The significance <b>of</b> <b>negotiation</b> and the negotiation principles are explained. The process <b>of</b> <b>negotiation</b> with its three phases, are discussed, approaches to negotiation are explained and common mistakes that occur during negotiation are highlighted. Mention is also made of the attitude principals have towards the use <b>of</b> <b>negotiation</b> in schools, as well is the effects that negotiations have on school performance. The context and skills needed in successful negotiation are discussed in chapter 3. With regard to the context <b>of</b> <b>negotiation,</b> the climate, negotiating for common ground, the characteristics of good agreement and the elements <b>of</b> <b>negotiation</b> are covered. With regard to skills needed in successful negotiation, listening, empathy, space, timing and persuasion are discussed. In chapter 4 the empirical research design, administrative procedures, population and sampling as well as statistical techniques are discussed. The completed and questionnaires returned by respondents are empirically analysed and interpreted. The practical significance (effect size) of differences between biographical data and the different negotiation factors is done to determine if the differences are large enough to have an effect in practice. In chapter 5 the summary of all the chapters is done as well as the findings 60 m the research and the recommendations. <b>Of</b> all the <b>negotiation</b> skills discussed, it is evident that empathy is a skill that is mostly used by principals, followed by persuasion and the process <b>of</b> <b>negotiation.</b> The skill that is used least by school principals and that is also recommended as a topic for further research, is space. Recommendations of this study emphasize the importance of workshops and or in-service training for principals on the use <b>of</b> <b>negotiation</b> skills. Master...|$|R

40|$|Project {{sales and}} {{delivery}} processes entail complex negotiations between client and contractor, as {{the details of}} the project are agreed upon during extensive interaction, often over a substantial period of time. Although very little research has been done on project negotiations as such, established research in the area <b>of</b> <b>negotiation</b> analysis provides a theoretically well-founded framework for studying project negotiations. This study applies the negotiation analysis framework to describe and analyze negotiations in the context of project sales and delivery processes. The body of this report first develops an understanding of the concept <b>of</b> <b>negotiation</b> and reviews the negotiation analysis approach. Second, the project sales and delivery process and its distinctive features are reviewed and their implications on negotiations in projects are analyzed. Third, the logic and concepts <b>of</b> <b>negotiation</b> analysis are used to describe and analyze a selected set <b>of</b> <b>negotiation</b> strategies available to either the client or contractor at different phases of a single project. The main results of the study include a conceptualization of the project sales and delivery process as a negotiation problem, and a qualitative description <b>of</b> selected <b>negotiation</b> strategies in terms <b>of</b> <b>negotiation</b> analysis. The concepts used (e. g. phases <b>of</b> <b>negotiation,</b> interests, issues, and best alternatives to a negotiated agreement) can be applied in practical settings for the purposes of training professionals and preparing for negotiations, and ultimately for transforming negotiation games in the favor of practicing negotiators...|$|R
