500|$|Live was {{released}} to keep Usher's fans satisfied during the four-year break between My Way (1997) and 8701, his {{second and third}} studio albums, respectively. During that time, Usher was busy pursuing an acting career in films The Faculty (1998), Light It Up (1999) and Texas Rangers (2001). The album was recorded at two free concerts Usher performed {{in his hometown of}} Chattanooga, Tennessee on October15 and 16,1998. Usher stated his reasons for releasing a live album in an interview with MTV, [...] "I really like the sound of a band, that's <b>one,</b> <b>just</b> <b>for</b> myself, but there were so many people who didn't {{get a chance to see}} the concert, so I came out with a live version of most of the songs on my album, and I came out with a home video for all the people who didn't get a chance to see the performance, and a little bio of me as well." [...] Seven of the songs included on Live are from Usher's self-titled debut album (1994) and My Way.

50|$|Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure (later {{abridged}} and renamed Fanny Hill) {{was written}} in 1748 by John Cleland.

50|$|It {{was common}} before {{the modern era}} of {{computerized}} fuel injection to specify {{at least a couple}} of different heat ranges for plugs for an automobile engine; a hotter plug for cars that were mostly driven slowly around the city, and a colder plug for sustained high-speed highway use. This practice has, however, largely become obsolete now that cars' fuel/air mixtures and cylinder temperatures are maintained within a narrow range, for purposes of limiting emissions. Racing engines, however, still benefit from picking a proper plug heat range.

5000|$|Hotwells Halt {{was built}} {{alongside}} the River Avon, {{just north of}} Portnalls Number One Railway Tunnel, {{a few hundred yards}} from the main terminus at [...] The station had a single 700 ft timber platform, a run-around loop and a siding, all controlled by a signal box at the northern end of the platform. It was constructed in 1917 by the government-controlled Great Western and Midland railways as a wartime expedient, since workmen's trains were too long for the platform at the [...] terminus. Some 2,000 dockworkers each day would travel by tram to the terminus, then walk along the riverside to reach Hotwells Halt, where they would buy tickets for Avonmouth. There were two ticket booths, a small <b>one</b> <b>just</b> <b>for</b> Avonmouth tickets, and a larger one for other destinations. Return tickets were valid to Hotwells or , and so after the morning rush few passengers used the halt. The first two services of the day would start at Hotwells Halt, with one return terminating there.From September 1921, the Halt was the terminus of the BPRP line, as the Hotwells terminus was closed to allow construction of the A4 Portway. Hotwells Halt, and the line to Sneyd Park Junction, closed on 3 July 1922, with the final train running on 1 July.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the machine}} was {{designed}} {{to be part of a}} subscription data service, the remaining units are mostly inoperable. The set-top box ROM contains only what is required to continue booting from an external hard drive or from its Ethernet connection. What's more, many of the prototypes do not appear to even attempt to boot. This is likely dependent on changes in the ROM. The ROM itself contained parts of a downsized Mac OS 7.1 enabling the Television Box to establish a network connection to the media servers provided by Oracle. The Oracle Media Server (OMS) initially ran on hardware produced by Larry Ellison's nCube Systems company, but was later also made available by Oracle on SGI, Digital Equipment Corp Alpha, Sun, SCO, Netware, Windows NT, and IBM Aix systems. These servers also provided the parts of the OS not implemented in ROM of the Television Box via the OMS Boot Service. Therefore, a Television Box had to establish a network connection successfully in order to finish the boot process. There have been cases of users entering in a command key combination, to get the Set Top Box to boot off of a pre-installed OS 7.1 on an external SCSI hard drive, using a PowerBook SCSI adapter (NOT a SCSI Disk Mode-enabled adapter, but <b>one</b> <b>just</b> <b>for</b> external hard drives).|$|E

5000|$|Rick Swan {{reviewed}} the adventure in The Space Gamer No. 75. He called the adventure [...] "little {{more than a}} by-the-numbers rewrite of a typical TSR hack-and-slasher circa 1978". Swan added: [...] "Anyone who's even casually experienced with fantasy roleplaying will be in familiar territory with Throne of Evil ... For what it's worth, {{there are plenty of}} well-rendered maps, including <b>one</b> <b>just</b> <b>for</b> the players (always a nice touch). At least you can sense the hand of a good editor at work as there is very little superfluous material to distract from the ... adventure." [...] He continued: [...] "If Mayfair indeed felt compelled to add a simple hack-and-slasher to their RoleAids line, you'd think they'd have at least insisted on some new monsters or some new treasures or at least an interesting trap or two. Instead, we get the usual assortment of snoozers ... the 'political intrigue' referred to in the introduction is little more than an uninvolving fluctuation of loyalties among some of the NPCs. Somebody ought to tell these guys that this approach to fantasy modules is hopelessly old-fashioned. Sure, it's got its place - it's a nice way to introduce young players to the hobby, if nothing else. But it's already been done to death and done much better elsewhere." [...] Swan concluded the review by saying, [...] "If you have an opening for a product of this kind, my suggestion is to pick up an old TSR D&D module. Just for old time's sake, I bought a half dozen of 'em at a book store recently for a buck and a half each. As for Throne of Evil, let's let it go as an unfortunate misfire from the usually excellent RoleAids series. I mean, nobody's perfect." ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This year marked {{our first}} {{participation}} at the Robot Vision task a new task from ImageCLEF competition. The paper represents {{a brief description}} of our system as the {{solution to the problem of}} topological localization of a mobile robot using visual information. We were asked to determine the topological location of a robot based on images acquired with a perspective camera mounted on a robot platform. And so, we decided that we don't need an incremental learning system and we approached a statistical method that always will work the best results. We used to apply a feature-based method (SIFT 1) and two main systems in order to search and classify the given images written by us. At the same time, the systems preserve the recognition performance of the batch algorithm. The first system is reordering the images so we can get the most important/representative images for a room's category. This is done using SIFT. The second system is a brute <b>one,</b> <b>just</b> <b>for</b> testing the differences between this one and the first one, not selecting the representative images. We acquired a separation in directories for every room capturing the key points saved in files for every image (or representative) from every room. About the changes in the environment, the SIFT algorithm occupies itself. The entire recognition system consists in a server – client architecture. Server is processing one single search at a time, and after the search ends connection with the client closes. The resulting file is the asked-for file with the final results for the batched images. ...|$|E
