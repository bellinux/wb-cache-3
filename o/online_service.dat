40|$|With the {{technological}} {{development of the}} last decades, {{an increasing number of}} genealogists are carrying out their research online. The purpose of this master’s thesis is to examine how and why genealogists' information behavior has been influenced by the use of <b>online</b> <b>services</b> for genealogy. Using a conceptual model of genealogists' information behavior as theoretical basis for the study, I examine how the use of <b>online</b> <b>services</b> affect genealogists’ search process, what information they are looking for and what information resources they use. Data is collected by seven qualitative interviews with experienced genealogists. The interviews indicate that <b>online</b> <b>services</b> have not completely taken over the genealogists’ search for information. Genealogists still went to physical repositories for a number of reasons. However, all participants in the study agreed that their visits to physical repositories and their use of physical records had declined since they began to use <b>online</b> <b>services.</b> The search for information was perceived to have become easier and more convenient with <b>online</b> <b>services,</b> although participants also acknowledged the risks of misleading information. <b>Online</b> <b>services</b> for genealogy also seem to have an influence on the contact between genealogists, especially on international contacts. This, together with the increasing research on foreign material, indicates that genealogy has been internationalized {{as a result of the}} use of <b>online</b> <b>services.</b> To the extent that the use of <b>online</b> <b>services</b> affects genealogists' information behavior, it seems in large part to be a result of <b>online</b> <b>services</b> removing geographical barriers that previously influenced genealogists’ information behavior.

40|$|The rapid {{advancement}} of Internet technologies enables {{more and more}} educational institutes, companies, and government agencies to provide <b>services,</b> namely <b>online</b> <b>services,</b> through web portals. With hundreds of <b>online</b> <b>services</b> provided through a web portal, {{it is critical to}} design web portals, namely service portals, through which <b>online</b> <b>services</b> can be easily accessed by their consumers. This article addresses this critical issue from the perspective of service selection, that is, how to select a small number of service-links (i. e., hyperlinks pointing to <b>online</b> <b>services)</b> to be featured in the homepage of a service portal such that users can be directed to find the <b>online</b> <b>services</b> they seek most effectively. We propose a mathematically formulated metric to measure the effectiveness of the selected service-links in directing users to locate their desired <b>online</b> <b>services</b> and formally define the service selection problem. A solution method, ServiceFinder, is then proposed. Using real-world data obtained from the Utah State Government service portal, we show that ServiceFinder outperforms both the current practice of service selection and previous algorithms for adaptive website design. We also show that the performance of ServiceFinder is close to that of the optimal solution resulting from exhaustive search. © 2007 ACM. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

5|$|Perfect Dark Zero {{features}} a campaign mode consisting of 14 missions {{that can be}} played co-operatively and a multiplayer mode where a maximum of 32 players can compete {{against each other in}} numerous types of deathmatch and objective-based games. Both the co-operative and multiplayer modes support split-screen, system link, and the Xbox Live <b>online</b> <b>service.</b> The game was under development for five years and was originally intended to be released for the Nintendo GameCube and later the Xbox. During development, several intended features were canceled so that the game could meet the Xbox 360 launch.|$|E
5|$|Perfect Dark is a remastered {{release of}} the first-person shooter video game by the same name. Developed by 4J Studios and {{published}} by Microsoft Game Studios {{a decade after the}} original's 2000 release, the remaster features several technical improvements, including higher resolution textures and models, a higher frame rate, and a multiplayer mode that supports the Xbox Live <b>online</b> <b>service.</b> It was released for the Xbox 360 video game console in March 2010, through the Xbox Live Arcade download service.

40|$|This study {{examined}} {{the effect of the}} four constructs - trust in online media, trust in <b>online</b> <b>services,</b> perceived risk with online media, and perceived risk with <b>online</b> <b>services</b> - on the use of information-oriented <b>online</b> legal <b>services.</b> Using past theories on adoption studies, a three-level framework was developed. This framework helped to formulate a new research model. A quantitative survey was conducted to identify the important factors affecting the intention of customers to adopt information-oriented <b>online</b> legal <b>services</b> in Hong Kong. Findings indicated that there is a hierarchical relationship among the four constructs. Perceived usefulness was the most important belief that drove people to adopt the <b>online</b> <b>services.</b> Perceived risk and trust were less important at present, probably because <b>online</b> legal <b>services</b> are still somewhat immature and mainly focus on less risky areas, such as information dissemination and marketing.

5|$|The game also {{provides}} a co-operative mode where two players may play through the game's campaign together via split-screen, system link, or through the Xbox Live <b>online</b> <b>service.</b> In co-operative, the missions are slightly altered to suit both players. For instance, some doors may require two players to open them. Additionally, in certain missions, the second player can occasionally start {{far away from the}} main player and takes over an allied character that was AI-controlled in the single player campaign. The respawn procedure is also altered substantially, as if one player dies, the other has to find and revive the partner's corpse to bring it back to life.|$|E
5|$|The game uses {{medals and}} rewards, which are awarded for certain tasks. As of v1.50, the game {{supports}} trophies, {{which will be}} used in the <b>online</b> <b>service</b> PlayStation Home. Players are also able to customize their characters with armor squad markings, Warhawk paint schemes, and other accessories. More customization options are unlocked as the player increases in rank. Warhawk also allows the creation of clans, which may participate in online events and competitions. The game also makes use of arbiters, paid anonymous players who are tasked to find cheaters within the game. They are able to punish offending players in several ways, such as an email warning, a forum post, a kick, or a temporary/permanent ban. Arbiters can also request that the player's stats be erased.|$|E
5|$|Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary was {{developed}} as a partnership between development studios 343 Industries, Saber Interactive, and Certain Affinity. 343 Industries, the Halo series' franchise overseers, approached Saber Interactive to develop a remake of the original Halo in time for its tenth anniversary. After considering whether to remake the game entirely or to adapt and add features to the existing PC version, Saber decided to use its game engine for reproducing the original's appearance and the original Halos engine for gameplay. A development tool for toggling between {{the old and new}} visuals became a game feature. Anniversarys enhancements include a complete high-definition visual overhaul, support for cooperative and multiplayer gameplay via the Xbox Live <b>online</b> <b>service,</b> new and remastered sound effects and music, and extras such as achievements and hidden in-game collectibles. The game is the first in the series to include Kinect support.|$|E

5|$|Subsistences online {{multiplayer}} component, titled Metal Gear Online, {{consists of}} five tournament-style game modes, {{each with a}} capacity of up to eight players. This mode pits players, each playing as a generic soldier {{against each other in}} deathmatch battles and variations of capture the flag, using stages, items, maneuvers, and units (such as the KGB, GRU or Ocelot Unit) from the main game. Depending on server settings, each round the highest-scoring player in each unit automatically assumes the role of one of the main characters (or Reiko Hinomoto from Rumble Roses), along with unique abilities and/or items. For example, the highest scoring player on the GRU team would assume the role of Major Raikov, leader of the GRU, next round. Konami's Metal Gear <b>Online</b> <b>service</b> for the PlayStation 2 closed in Japan on December 26, 2006, followed by in North America on April 2, 2007 and in Europe on October 30, 2007, although a fan community has revived it by emulating the servers. As noted above, the online mode, after one of the players unlocks an animal codename, also allowed for the player to play as either Reiko Hinomoto or Rowdy Reiko from Rumble Roses (depending if the player in question was of red team or blue team, respectively). According to Metal Gear series creator Hideo Kojima, he added the characters into the game as secret characters in part due to opportunity: Kojima had earlier been offered a deal with Rumble Roses producer Akari Uchida to make a crossover between Metal Gear and Rumble Roses. However, the Metal Gear development team at the time refused to work with them. Kojima eventually accepted the offer when trying to decide on secret characters for the online mode for Subsistence to tie up loose ends. He also admitted that he originally considered offering Tomonobu Itagaki, at the time the producer of the Tecmo fighting game series Dead or Alive, the opportunity of using one of his characters as a secret character.|$|E
