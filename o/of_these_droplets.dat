50|$|Droplets of {{supercooled}} water often exist in stratiform and cumulus clouds. An aircraft flying {{through such a}} cloud sees an abrupt crystallization <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>droplets,</b> which can result {{in the formation of}} ice on the aircraft's wings or blockage of its instruments and probes, unless the aircraft is equipped with an appropriate de-icing system.

40|$|In an {{electron}} beam vapour deposition process {{in conjunction with}} arc discharge, cathode focal points occur, causing the formation <b>of</b> <b>droplets.</b> <b>These</b> <b>droplets</b> have a very negative influence {{on the quality of}} the layers. According to the invention, a periodically deflectable, high-energy electron beam moves on the vapour deposition material in order to form a more or less evenly heated area in which a high vaporization rate occurs. In this area, an arc discharge is ignited and its arc forms diffusely and expands over the said area. A high proportion of the vapour is ionized. During the process, no process gas in supplied. The invention is used for coating components, tools and strip steel and can also be used reactively...|$|R
50|$|To use the inhaler {{the patient}} presses {{down on the}} top of the canister, with their thumb {{supporting}} the lower portion of the actuator. Actuation of the device releases a single metered dose of the formulation which contains the medication either dissolved or suspended in the propellant. Breakup of the volatile propellant into droplets, followed by rapid evaporation <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>droplets,</b> results in the generation of an aerosol consisting of micrometer-sized medication particles that are then inhaled.|$|E
50|$|The {{relative}} importance of these three modes of transmission is unclear, and they may all contribute {{to the spread of}} the virus. In the airborne route, the droplets that are small enough for people to inhale are 0.5 to 5 µm in diameter and inhaling just one droplet might be enough to cause an infection. Although a single sneeze releases up to 40,000 droplets, most <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>droplets</b> are quite large and will quickly settle out of the air. How long influenza survives in airborne droplets seems to be influenced by the levels of humidity and UV radiation: with low humidity and a lack of sunlight in winter probably aiding its survival.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{agent is}} the buoyant {{convective}} upward motion caused by significant daytime solar heating at surface level, or by relatively high absolute humidity. [...] Incoming short-wave radiation {{generated by the}} sun is re-emitted as long-wave radiation when it reaches Earth's surface. This process warms the air closest to ground and increases air mass instability by creating a steeper temperature gradient from warm or hot at surface level to cold aloft. This causes it to rise and cool until temperature equilibrium is achieved with the surrounding air aloft. Moderate instability allows {{for the formation of}} cumuliform clouds of moderate size that can produce light showers if the airmass is sufficiently moist. Typical convection upcurrents may allow the droplets to grow to a radius of about 0.015 mm before precipitating as showers. The equivalent diameter <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>droplets</b> is about 0.03 mm.|$|E
50|$|The {{ultimate}} goal when forming a hydrophobic material {{is to reduce}} the polarity of the molecules. Because water molecules are very polar, they are easily attract to partially positive or partially negative charges. On a neutral surface, water molecules bunch up and attract each other, creating a spherical <b>droplet</b> <b>of</b> water. <b>These</b> <b>droplets</b> can then evaporate off the concrete surface rather than be absorbed into the capillaries of the concrete. The exact structure and composition of the crystals used in hydrophobic concrete is not public information; due to its properties, however, it can be assumed that it is a non-polar molecule.|$|R
50|$|The extracion cells {{consists}} of hollow bodies with inlets and oulets of liquid connection. The cells are first {{filled with the}} liquid chosen to be the stationary phase. Under rotation, the pumping of the mobile phase is started, which enters the cells from the inlet. When entering the flow of mobiles phase forms small droplets according to the Stokes' law, which is called atomization. <b>These</b> <b>droplets</b> fall through the stationary phase, creating a high interfacial area, which is called the extraction. At the end <b>of</b> the cells, <b>these</b> <b>droplets</b> unite due to the surface tension, which is called settling.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} how a droplet {{of a complex}} liquid is modified by its internal nanoscale structure. As the liquid passes from an isotropic disordered state to an anisotropic layered morphology, the droplet shape switches from a smooth spherical cap to a terraced hyperbolic profile, which can be modeled as a stack of thin concentric circular disks with a repulsion between adjacent disk edges. Our ability to resolve the detailed shape <b>of</b> <b>these</b> defect-free <b>droplets</b> offers {{a unique opportunity to}} explore the underlying physics...|$|R
50|$|Influenza can {{be spread}} in three main ways: by direct {{transmission}} (when an infected person sneezes mucus {{directly into the}} eyes, nose or mouth of another person); the airborne route (when someone inhales the aerosols produced by an infected person coughing, sneezing or spitting) and through hand-to-eye, hand-to-nose, or hand-to-mouth transmission, either from contaminated surfaces or from direct personal contact such as a handshake. The relative importance of these three modes of transmission is unclear, and they may all contribute {{to the spread of}} the virus. In the airborne route, the droplets that are small enough for people to inhale are 0.5 to 5 µm in diameter and inhaling just one droplet might be enough to cause an infection.

5000|$|The sun, which {{drives the}} water cycle, heats water in oceans and seas. Water evaporates as water vapor into the air. Ice and snow can {{sublimate}} directly into water vapour. Evapotranspiration is water transpired from plants and evaporated from the soil. The water vapour molecule [...] has less density {{compared to the}} major components of the atmosphere, nitrogen and oxygen, [...] and [...] Due to the significant difference in molecular mass, water vapor in gas form gains height in open air {{as a result of}} buoyancy. However, as altitude increases, air pressure decreases and the temperature drops (see Gas laws). The lowered temperature causes water vapour to condense into a tiny liquid water droplet which is heavier than the air, such that it falls unless supported by an updraft. A huge concentration <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>droplets</b> over a large space up in the atmosphere become visible as cloud. Fog is formed if the water vapour condenses near ground level, as a result of moist air and cool air collision or an abrupt reduction in air pressure. Air currents move water vapour around the globe, cloud particles collide, grow, and fall out of the upper atmospheric layers as precipitation. Some precipitation falls as snow or hail, sleet, and can accumulate as ice caps and glaciers, which can store frozen water for thousands of years. Most water falls back into the oceans or onto land as rain, where the water flows over the ground as surface runoff. A portion of runoff enters rivers in valleys in the landscape, with streamflow moving water towards the oceans. Runoff and water emerging from the ground (groundwater) may be stored as freshwater in lakes. Not all runoff flows into rivers, much of it soaks into the ground as infiltration. Some water infiltrates deep into the ground and replenishes aquifers, which can store freshwater for long periods of time. Some infiltration stays close to the land surface and can seep back into surface-water bodies (and the ocean) as groundwater discharge. Some groundwater finds openings in the land surface and comes out as freshwater springs. In river valleys and floodplains, there is often continuous water exchange between surface water and ground water in the hyporheic zone. Over time, the water returns to the ocean, to continue the water cycle.|$|E

The micro-flow measurements are based on epi-fluorescence illumination and high-speed imaging. The experimental data are compared with the numerical results obtained using both turbulent and laminar flow models. It was found that, due to small channel dimensions and very small flow development length, the turbulent energy dissipation takes place mainly in the gap and shortly behind it.

50|$|Another type of {{contamination}} in UPW is dissolved inorganic material, primarily silica. Silica {{is one of}} the most abundant mineral on the planet and is found in all water supplies. Any dissolved inorganic material has the potential to remain on the wafer as the UPW dries. Once again this can lead to a significant loss in yield. To detect trace amounts of dissolved inorganic material a measurement of non-volatile residue is commonly used. This technique involves using a nebulizer to create droplets of UPW suspended in a stream <b>of</b> air. <b>These</b> <b>droplets</b> are dried at a high temperature to produce an aerosol of non-volatile residue particles. A measurement device called a condensation particle counter then counts the residue particles to give a reading in parts per trillion (ppt) by weight.|$|R
5000|$|A {{cloud chamber}} {{consists}} of a sealed environment containing a supersaturated vapor of water or alcohol. An energetic charged particle (for example, an alpha or beta particle) interacts with the gaseous mixture by knocking electrons off gas molecules via electrostatic forces during collisions, resulting in a trail of ionized gas particles. The resulting ions act as condensation centers around which a mist-like trail of small droplets form if the gas mixture is at the point <b>of</b> condensation. <b>These</b> <b>droplets</b> are visible as a [...] "cloud" [...] track that persist for several seconds while the droplets fall through the vapor.

Little is known about how animals package fat within cells. Five related structural proteins serve roles in packaging fat into lipid droplets. The proteins TIP 47, S 3 – 12, and OXPAT/MLDP/PAT- 1 move from the cytosol to coat nascent lipid droplets during rapid fat storage. In contrast, perilipin and adipophilin constitutively associate with lipid droplets and play roles in sustained fat storage and regulation of lipolysis.

40|$|Using a {{microfluidic}} flow-focusing device, mono-disperse {{water droplets}} in oil were generated and their interface populated by either 1 mu m or 500 nm amine modified silica particles {{suspended in the}} water phase. The deformation and breakup <b>of</b> <b>these</b> Pickering <b>droplets</b> were studied in both pure extensional flow and combined extensional and shear flow at various capillary numbers using a microfluidic hyperbolic contraction.

Therefore, large N phase transitions in UMM can be understood in terms of dynamics of an effective UMQM. From the geometry of droplets it is also possible to construct Young diagrams corresponding to U(N) representations and hence different large N states of the theory in momentum space. We explicitly consider two examples : single plaquette model with Tr U^ 2 terms and Chern-Simons theory on S^ 3.
