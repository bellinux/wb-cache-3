25|$|Deciding {{the future}} submarines' {{propulsion}} system is {{closely tied to}} determining its <b>operational</b> range, <b>endurance</b> and stealthiness. Two basic options are presented in submarine propulsion: nuclear propulsion, and conventional, diesel-electric propulsion. The option of nuclear propulsion effectively gives submarines an unlimited range and endurance, only restrained by maintenance and human crew requirements for resupply and rest, and removes the necessity for surfacing to recharge batteries, an unstealthy and risky process. Australian governments have repeatedly rejected the nuclear propulsion option {{due to the lack}} of an Australian nuclear power industry (Australia would be the only non-nuclear nation to operate nuclear submarines), related issues of operational sovereignty were Australia to operate an American nuclear powered submarine such as the Virginia class, rendering it dependent on American technical support, and public opposition to nuclear technology.|$|R

The aerodynamic drag breakdown of a transport aircraft at cruise shows that the skin friction drag and the lift-induced drag constitute the two main sources of drag, approximately one half and {{one third of the}} total drag.

40|$|Drag {{reduction}} for aerial and underwater vehicles has a {{range of}} positive ramifications: reduced fuel consumption, larger <b>operational</b> range, greater <b>endurance</b> and higher achievable speeds. This work capitalizes on recent developments in Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) studies on turbulent drag reduction techniques and active material based actuation to develop an “active ” skin for turbulent drag reduction. The skin operation principle is based on computational evidence from DNS studies indicating that spanwise traveling surface waves of the right amplitude, wavelength and frequency can result in significant turbulent drag reduction. Such traveling waves can be induced in the skin via active-material actuation. The flow control technique pursued is “micro ” {{in the sense that}} only micro-scale wave amplitudes (order of 30 µ m) and energy inputs are expected to produce significant benefits. In this work, a generalized actuation principle that can generate a traveling surface wave is proposed and analyzed. Two actuation schemes, that are approximate implementations of this generalized actuation principle, are considered. Treating these actuation schemes as design paradigms, several skin designs are developed. The feasibility of the different actuation possibilities, such as Shape Memory Alloys and Piezoelectric material based actuators, and the relative merits of the different skin designs are discussed. The feasibility studies include analytical solutions based on geometric idealizations, that are further refined using quasistatic Finite Element Analysis (FEA). The dynamic response of the skin designs to complicated loading sequences, are investigated using dynamic finite element analysis. Rayleigh damping is used in the dynamic analysis to model the total damping present in the system...|$|R
5000|$|The {{official}} RLM Volksjäger {{design competition}} parameters specified a single-seat fighter, {{powered by a}} single BMW 003, a slightly lower-thrust engine not in demand for either the Me 262A or the Ar 234B, already in service. The main structure of the Volksjäger competing airframe designs would use cheap and unsophisticated parts made of wood and other non-strategic materials and, more importantly, could be assembled by semi- and non-skilled labor, including slave labor. [...] Specifications included a weight {{of no more than}} 2000 kg, [...] with maximum speed specified as 750 km/h (470 mph) at sea level, <b>operational</b> <b>endurance</b> at least a half hour, and the takeoff run no more than 500 m (1,640 ft). Armament was specified as either two 20 mm MG 151/20 cannons with 100 rounds each, or two 30 mm MK 108 cannons with 50 rounds each. The Volksjäger needed to be easy to fly. Some suggested even glider or student pilots should be able to fly the jet effectively in combat, and indeed had the Volksjäger gone into full production, that is precisely what would have happened. After the war, Ernst Heinkel would say, [...] "The unrealistic notion that this plane should be a 'people's fighter,' in which the Hitler Youth, after a short training regimen with clipped-wing two-seater gliders like the DFS Stummel-Habicht, could fly for the defense of Germany, displayed the unbalanced fanaticism of those days." [...] The clipped-wingspan DFS Habicht models had varying wingspans of both 8 m or 6 m, and were used to prepare more experienced Luftwaffe pilots for the dangerous Me 163B Komet rocket fighter — the same sort of training approach would also be used for the Hitler Youth aviators chosen to fly the jet-powered Volksjäger.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{introduces}} {{a new class}} of heteroge-neous multi-robot systems composed of mobile ground robots and aerial vehicles, capable of physically connecting to each other by means of a tethered cable on an as-needed basis. The main advantage of this architecture is that it allows energy supply over the link, which leads to {{a significant increase in the}} overall <b>operational</b> <b>endurance</b> of the system while preserving good manipulability in terms of reachable task space. Physical connection may also allow the exchange of forces enhancing the ability to perform maneuvers otherwise impossible for the single platform. The physical constraints arising from the linkage can also be used to enhance the safety of the overall system by reducing the task space of a given unit in order to prevent undesired collisions with obstacles or humans. Additionally, the cable might even provide a high speed and reliable communication channel between units...|$|E
40|$|Developing the {{techniques}} of welding materials with higher dynamic strength onto the rolling surfaces of rails {{is one of the}} options for increasing their <b>operational</b> <b>endurance.</b> The subject of this paper is an analyses of heterogeneous weld interfaces experimentally manufactured by welding medium-carbon austenitic steels onto high-carbon unalloyed pearlitic steels. The analyses focus on examinations of the marginal mixing of the materials at the weld interface and the circumstances under which intercrystalline cracks form in the weld deposit layers. Structural analyses, chemical microanalyses and a hardness assessment were performed in order to identify the corresponding structural changes. The proportion of zonal vs. interdendritic segregation of the alloying elements in the degradation of the welded joint was distinguished. We described the nature of the structural heterogeneities produced, locally connected with the martensitic transformation. The chemical heterogeneity leading to the formation of martensite at grain boundaries was identified as the limiting effect. </p...|$|E

40|$|The naval warfare {{environment}} is rapidly changing. The U. S. Navy is adapting by continuing its blue-water dominance while simultaneously building brown-water capabilities. Unmanned systems, such as unmanned airborne drones, are proving pivotal in facing new battlefield challenges. Unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) are {{emerging as the}} Navy's seaborne equivalent of the Air Force's drones. Representing a low-end disruptive technology relative to traditional shipborne operations, UUVs are becoming capable of taking on increasingly complex roles, tipping the scales of battlefield entropy. They improve mission outcomes and operate {{for a fraction of}} the cost of traditional operations. Furthermore, long-term underwater power sources at currently under development at MIT will extend UUV range and <b>operational</b> <b>endurance</b> by an order of magnitude. Installing these systems will not only allow UUVs to complete new, previously impossible missions, but will also radically decrease costs. I explore the financial and strategic implications of UUVs and long-term underwater power sources to the Navy and its future operations. By examining current naval operations and the ways in which UUVs could complement or replace divers and ships, I identify ways to use UUV technology to reduce risk to human life, decrease costs, and leverage the technology learning curve. I conclude that significant cost savings are immediately available with the widespread use of UUVs, and current research investment levels are inadequate in comparison with the risks and rewards of UUV programs. by Richard Winston Larson.

40|$|As {{the demand}} for highly capable {{microsatellite}} missions continues to grow, so too does the need for small yet effective satellite technologies. One area which {{needs to be addressed}} is compact propulsion systems capable of performing on-orbit maneuvers, station keeping, and de-orbit impulses with good efficiency. Another important consideration for propulsion systems is the safety and ease in handling, integrating, and testing the propulsion system. This is particularly important for small satellites in order to maintain simplicity by avoiding toxic propellants such as hydrazine. In response to this demand, the Space Flight Laboratory has developed its next generation propulsion system which builds on the experience of the Canadian Nanospace Advanced Propulsion System (CNAPS), a cold gas system that enabled the successful CanX- 4 /CanX- 5 formation flying mission in 2014. The new propulsion system uses nitrous oxide (N 2 O) as the propellant. The benefits of nitrous oxide are that it is safe to handle, non toxic, cheap, and much easier to access and transport than traditional propellants. Nitrous oxide also self pressurizes to 50. 5 bar (733 psi) at 20 °C and thus does not require the addition of a pump or pressurant gas to move the propellant; this allows the tank and feed system design to be much simpler than for liquid propellants. Nitrous oxide can also be used as monopropellant, that is to say that it can be exothermically decomposed to provide an increase in efficiency from an input power point of view. This paper summarizes SFL 2 ̆ 7 s effort in the development of this system. A 100 mN resistojet was initially developed. The performance using nitrous oxide was verified with a specific impulse of 100 s and input power ofdevelopment, a monopropellant version of the thruster was developed. The 100 mN monopropellant thruster has successfully demonstrated sustainable nitrous oxide decomposition with a specific impulse of 148 s and <b>operational</b> <b>endurance</b> of greater than 50 hours.
