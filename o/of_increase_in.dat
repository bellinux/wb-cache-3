5|$|The traffic {{projections}} for the bridge {{at the planning stage}} {{have not been}} achieved. A traffic survey carried out for a week during June 2012 recorded traffic of 29,000 vehicles over the bridge in comparison to a projected 85,000. A survey conducted during the same period in June 2012 indicated a figure of 31,865 vehicles, though it is reported by the concerned traffic and transportation engineer that the rate <b>of</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> traffic has been one percent per year on the basis of traffic surveys carried out from the time of commissioning of the bridge. The reason for the fall in traffic during 2012 is attributed to the peak monsoon effect during the survey period.|$|E
5|$|Kepler's {{first major}} astronomical work, Mysterium Cosmographicum (The Cosmographic Mystery) , {{was the first}} {{published}} defense of the Copernican system. Kepler claimed to have had an epiphany on July 19, 1595, while teaching in Graz, demonstrating the periodic conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in the zodiac: he realized that regular polygons bound one inscribed and one circumscribed circle at definite ratios, which, he reasoned, might be the geometrical basis of the universe. After failing to find a unique arrangement of polygons that fit known astronomical observations (even with extra planets added to the system), Kepler began experimenting with 3-dimensional polyhedra. He found {{that each of the}} five Platonic solids could be inscribed and circumscribed by spherical orbs; nesting these solids, each encased in a sphere, within one another would produce six layers, corresponding to the six known planets—Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. By ordering the solids selectively—octahedron, icosahedron, dodecahedron, tetrahedron, cube—Kepler found that the spheres could be placed at intervals corresponding to the relative sizes of each planet's path, assuming the planets circle the Sun. Kepler also found a formula relating the size of each planet's orb to the length of its orbital period: from inner to outer planets, the ratio <b>of</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> orbital period is twice the difference in orb radius. However, Kepler later rejected this formula, because it was not precise enough.|$|E
5|$|Some redshifts are {{an example}} of the Doppler effect, {{familiar}} in the change of apparent pitches of sirens and frequency of the sound waves emitted by speeding vehicles. A redshift occurs whenever a light source moves away from an observer. A special instance of this is the cosmological redshift, which is due to the expansion of the universe, and sufficiently distant light sources (generally more than a few million light years away) show redshift corresponding to the rate <b>of</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> their distance from Earth. Finally, gravitational redshift is a relativistic effect observed in electromagnetic radiation moving out of gravitational fields. Conversely, a decrease in wavelength is called blueshift and is generally seen when a light-emitting object moves toward an observer or when electromagnetic radiation moves into a gravitational field. However, redshift is a more common term and sometimes blueshift is referred to as negative redshift.|$|E

40|$|An {{examination}} of the causes <b>of</b> the <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> payments made for 9 of the 17 health services provided by the New Jersey Medicaid program during calendar years 1970 - 74 revealed that most <b>of</b> the overall <b>increase</b> occurred because <b>of</b> an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> utilization, followed by <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> prices {{and the number of}} eligible persons. An analysis of the annual rates of change {{for each of the three}} factors showed that price changes did not conform to any discernible pattern, while most <b>of</b> the <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> eligible persons plus a substantial amount <b>of</b> the <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> utilization occurred during 1970 - 71. The findings suggest that Medicaid payments will continue to <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> the future. However, because of uncertainty about the magnitude of price and utilization changes, coupled with uncertainty about whether the Medicaid umbrella will be expanded, as it was most recently by the 1972 Amendments to the Social Security Act, no definitive conclusions were reached about the size <b>of</b> future <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> Medicaid payments...|$|R

In the case <b>of</b> an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> the replacement ratio, {{the relationship between}} unemployment insurance and saving depends on the weighted degree of absolute risk aversion, given risk aversion and the normality of leisure.

25|$|Although {{statistics}} of the Soviet economy are notoriously unreliable and its economic growth difficult to estimate precisely, by most accounts, the economy continued to expand until the mid-1980s. During the 1950s and 1960s, the Soviet economy experienced comparatively high growth and was {{catching up to}} the West. However, after 1970, the growth, while still positive, steadily declined much more quickly and consistently than in other countries despite a rapid increase in the capital stock (the rate <b>of</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> capital was only surpassed by Japan).|$|E

However, a deepening national recession meant that, despite the creation of new jobs, there were net job losses from 1979. Unemployment grew from 3.4 per cent in 1969 to over 8 per cent in 1972 and 22.3 per cent (almost double the national average) in 1983; long-term unemployment rose even faster. Nevertheless, the rate <b>of</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> unemployment was slowing down by 1983 and was making some progress against national and regional trends.|$|E

The Russian Ministry of Health and Social Affairs predicted that by 2011 the death rate would equal the birth rate because <b>of</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> fertility and decline in mortality. The government is implementing a number of programs designed to increase the birth rate and attract more migrants.

25|$|Incremental {{health risk}} is the {{increased}} risk that a receptor (normally {{a human being}} living nearby) will face from (the lack of) a remediation project. The use of incremental health risk is based on carcinogenic and other (e.g., mutagenic, teratogenic) effects and often involves value judgements about the acceptable projected rate <b>of</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> cancer. In some jurisdictions this is 1 in 1,000,000 but in other jurisdictions the acceptable projected rate of increase is 1 in 100,000. A relatively small incremental health risk from a single project is not of much comfort if the area already has a relatively high health risk from other operations like incinerators or other emissions, or if other projects exist {{at the same time}} causing a greater cumulative risk or an unacceptably high total risk. An analogy often used by remediators is to compare the risk of the remediation on nearby residents to the risks of death through car accidents or tobacco smoking.|$|E
