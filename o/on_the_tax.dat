5|$|The {{period after}} {{the defeat of}} the Spanish Armada in 1588 brought new {{difficulties}} for Elizabeth that lasted until the end of her reign. The conflicts with Spain and in Ireland dragged <b>on,</b> <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> burden grew heavier, and the economy was hit by poor harvests and the cost of war. Prices rose and the standard of living fell. During this time, repression of Catholics intensified, and Elizabeth authorised commissions in 1591 to interrogate and monitor Catholic householders. To maintain the illusion of peace and prosperity, she increasingly relied on internal spies and propaganda. In her last years, mounting criticism reflected a decline in the public's affection for her.|$|E

Also, E85 fuel price is set significantly lower than diesel or gasoline, resulting in E85 at € 0.80, diesel at €1.15, and gasoline at €1.30 per liter, as of April 2007. By May 2008, France had 211 pumps selling E85, even though the government made plans for the installation of up to 500 E85 pumps by year end 2007.

25|$|The {{welfare and}} {{leaseback}} programs got an abrupt ending as well. Eventually rulings were made <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> issues making the sale-and-lease-back model less favorable.

This caused the collapse of various plans that should have kept the scheme going, such as the sale of certain building sites.
