5|$|In {{the early}} years of the Supreme Court, {{business}} was conducted at a variety of locations in downtown Salem. The first public building to house the court was the Territorial Capitol Building in Salem that was built between 1854 and 1855. In that building the courtroom was in a chamber measuring 20 feet by 27 feet on the first floor. On December 29, 1855, after the building was partially occupied, it burned to the ground. In 1876, the state finished construction on a second capitol building where the court was located on the third floor. This courtroom measured 54 feet by 46 feet, while the state law library was 75 feet by 70 feet. A separate building was built by the state in 1914 to house the Supreme Court, and this is now the oldest building <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Capitol</b> Mall after the second capitol building burned down on April 25, 1935.|$|E
5|$|The 1996 Maryland train {{collision}} {{occurred on}} February 16, 1996, when a MARC commuter train collided with Amtrak's Capitol Limited passenger train in Silver Spring, Maryland. An {{investigation by the}} National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) found that {{the crew of the}} MARC train had forgotten the indication of an approach signal which they had passed before a station stop, and as a consequence could not slow down in time after encountering a stop signal. The collision killed three crew and eight passengers on the MARC train; a further eleven passengers on the MARC train and fifteen passengers and crew <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Capitol</b> Limited were injured. Total damage was estimated at $7.5 million. The crash {{led to the creation of}} comprehensive federal rules for passenger car design, the first in the history of passenger service in the United States, as well as changes to operating rules.|$|E
5|$|The Cocking affair {{occurred}} in 1941 and 1942 when Georgia governor Eugene Talmadge exerted direct {{control over the}} state's educational system, particularly through the firing of University of Georgia professor Walter Cocking, who had been hired to raise the relatively low academic standards at UGA's College of Education. Talmadge justified his actions by asserting that Cocking intended to integrate {{a part of the}} University of Georgia. Cocking's removal and the subsequent removal of members of the Georgia Board of Regents (including the vice chancellor) who disagreed with the decision were particularly controversial. Talmadge attempted to place Tech football star Red Barron in a new position as vice president of Georgia Tech; the move was widely criticized by Georgia Tech alumni, who marched <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>capitol,</b> and Barron subsequently declined to accept the position. In response to the actions of Governor Talmadge, the Southern Association of Independent Schools withdrew accreditation from all Georgia state-supported colleges for whites, including Georgia Tech. The controversy was instrumental in Talmadge's loss in the 1943 gubernatorial elections to Ellis Arnall.|$|E
