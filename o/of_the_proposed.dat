40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} a low {{complexity}} clipping method to reduce <b>the</b> peak power <b>of</b> OFDM signals. <b>The</b> <b>proposed</b> clipping method exploits the conventional square clipping, which clips signal {{according to the}} amplitude in I/Q-channels separately, to avoid obtaining a real amplitude of each sample which costs relatively high computational complexities. By combining the square clipping and phase rotations <b>of</b> signals, <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> octagon clipping achieves close clipping performances to the amplitude based normal clipping {{with a small amount}} <b>of</b> computations. <b>The</b> <b>proposed</b> method requires 4 comparison operations, one addition, and one subtraction to clip a sample of signal.
