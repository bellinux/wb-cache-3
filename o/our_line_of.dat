5|$|NGC 678 and NGC 680 are a pair {{of galaxies}} in Aries that are only about 200,000 light-years apart. Part of the NGC 691 group of galaxies, both are at a {{distance}} of approximately 130 million light-years. NGC 678 is an edge-on spiral galaxy that is 4.5 by 0.8 arcminutes. NGC 680, an elliptical galaxy with an asymmetrical boundary, is the brighter of the two at magnitude 12.9; NGC 678 has a magnitude of 13.35. Both galaxies have bright cores, but NGC 678 is the larger galaxy at a diameter of 171,000 light-years; NGC 680 has a diameter of 72,000 light-years. NGC 678 is further distinguished by its prominent dust lane. NGC 691 itself is a spiral galaxy slightly inclined to <b>our</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> sight. It has multiple spiral arms and a bright core. Because it is so diffuse, it has a low surface brightness. It has a diameter of 126,000 light-years and is 124 million light-years away. NGC 877 is the brightest member of an 8-galaxy group that also includes NGC 870, NGC 871, and NGC 876, with a magnitude of 12.53. It is 2.4 by 1.8 arcminutes and is 178 million light-years away with a diameter of 124,000 light-years. Its companion is NGC 876, which is about 103,000 light-years from the core of NGC 877. They are interacting gravitationally, as they are connected by a faint stream of gas and dust. Arp 276 is a different pair of interacting galaxies in Aries, consisting of NGC 935 and IC 1801.|$|E
25|$|The {{emission}} lines seen on {{the spectrum}} of a Seyfert galaxy may come {{from the surface of}} the accretion disc itself, or may come from clouds of gas illuminated by the central engine in an ionization cone. The exact geometry of the emitting region is difficult to determine due to poor resolution of the galactic center. However, each part of the accretion disc has a different velocity relative to <b>our</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> sight, and the faster the gas is rotating around the black hole, the broader the emission line will be. Similarly, an illuminated disc wind also has a position-dependent velocity.|$|E
25|$|Disks around {{brown dwarfs}} {{have been found}} to have many of the same {{features}} as disks around stars; therefore, it is expected that there will be accretion-formed planets around brown dwarfs. Given the small mass of brown dwarf disks, most planets will be terrestrial planets rather than gas giants. If a giant planet orbits a brown dwarf across <b>our</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> sight, then, because they have approximately the same diameter, this would give a large signal for detection by transit. The accretion zone for planets around a brown dwarf is very close to the brown dwarf itself, so tidal forces would have a strong effect.|$|E

25|$|At low luminosities, {{the objects}} to be unified are Seyfert galaxies. The {{unification}} models propose that in Seyfert 1s the observer {{has a direct}} view of the active nucleus. In Seyfert 2s the nucleus is observed through an obscuring structure which prevents a direct view of the optical continuum, broad-line region or (soft) X-ray emission. The key insight of orientation-dependent accretion models {{is that the two}} types of object can be the same if only certain angles to the line of sight are observed. The standard picture is of a torus of obscuring material surrounding the accretion disc. It must be large enough to obscure the broad-line region but not large enough to obscure the narrow-line region, which is seen in both classes of object. Seyfert 2s are seen through the torus. Outside the torus there is material that can scatter some of the nuclear emission into <b>our</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> sight, allowing us to see some optical and X-ray continuum and, in some cases, broad emission lines—which are strongly polarized, showing that they have been scattered and proving that some Seyfert 2s really do contain hidden Seyfert 1s. Infrared observations of the nuclei of Seyfert 2s also support this picture.|$|E
2500|$|Binary {{stars are}} often {{detected}} optically, {{in which case}} they are called visual binaries. [...] Many visual binaries have long orbital periods of several centuries or millennia and therefore have orbits which are uncertain or poorly known. [...] They may also be detected by indirect techniques, such as spectroscopy (spectroscopic binaries) or astrometry (astrometric binaries). [...] If a binary star happens to orbit in a plane along <b>our</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> sight, its components will eclipse and transit each other; these pairs are called eclipsing binaries, or, as they are detected by their changes in brightness during eclipses and transits, photometric binaries.|$|E

2500|$|The bush raid was the {{beginning}} of a new Māori strategy that would drain Cameron's resources and halt his advance for another 14 weeks. On 22 July a group of about 40 Māori fatally shot a settler cutting timber at Pukekiwiriki near Papakura and were pursued into the forest by the Auckland militia. Seven Maori were killed. When two more settlers were killed at isolated farms near Drury on 24 July, the government formed a special corps of bush fighters named the [...] "Forest Rangers", who began a series of bush reconnaissance missions and pursuits of armed Māori bands. Cameron wrote: [...] "The bush is now so infested with these natives that I have been obliged to establish strong posts along <b>our</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> communication, which absorbs so large a portion of the force that until I receive reinforcements it is impossible for me to advance further up the Waikato." ...|$|E

30|$|Finally, we have {{a remark}} on the {{appearance}} of the Epstein-Hurwitz zeta functions. We used the zeta functions to derive divergence and convergence results for our energy described by certain power series. If we just concentrate ourselves to such results, then the usage of such zeta functions might not be necessary, since divergence and convergence of the relevant power series can be proved rather directly. However, we are using the zeta functions, since they give a unified treatment of the power series and make <b>our</b> <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> discussions clearer in a rather essential way.

40|$|In this dissertation, we {{continue}} {{previous research on}} understanding social media documents along three lines: summarization, classification and recommendation. <b>Our</b> first <b>line</b> <b>of</b> work is the summarization of social media documents. Considering the task of time-aware tweets summarization, we first focus {{on the problem of}} selecting meaningful tweets given a user’s interests and propose a dynamic latent factor model. Thereafter, given a set of opinionated documents, we address the task of summarizing contrastive themes by selecting meaningful sentences to represent contrastive themes in those documents. A viewpoint is a triple consisting of an entity, a topic related to this entity and sentiment towards this topic. In this thesis, we also propose the task of multi-viewpoint summarization of multilingual social text streams, by monitoring viewpoints for a running topic and selecting a small set of informative documents. <b>Our</b> second <b>line</b> <b>of</b> work concerns hierarchical multi-label classification. Hierarchical multi-label classification assigns a document to multiple hierarchical labels. Here, we focus on hierarchical multi-label classification of social text streams, in which we propose a structured learning framework to classify a short text from a social text stream to multiple classes from a predefined hierarchy. Based on a viewpoint extraction model that we propose as part of a multi-viewpoint summarization task, <b>our</b> third <b>line</b> <b>of</b> work applies a latent factor model for predicting item ratings that uses user opinions and social relations to generate explanations...|$|R
