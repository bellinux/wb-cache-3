40|$|Abstract. In this study, the {{effectiveness}} of recent 3 D FEM simulations of <b>orbital</b> <b>forming</b> was investigated by (a) measuring the computation time and (b) {{by comparing the results}} of simulations with experiments. Commercial FEA software DEFORMTM 3 D v 4. 0 that has an efficient computation numerical algorithm for simulating incremental forming process was used for the simulations and the amount of savings in computation time was shown. Two measurable quantities from experiments are (1) deformed tab geometry of the spindle and (2) maximum forming load. Therefore, the accuracy of 3 D FEM simulation was evaluated by comparing the differences between the predicted and measured deformed tab geometry and maximum forming load. In order to provide reliable flow stress for the simulation, a finite element based inverse analysis technique was used to identify the parameters of the flow stress equation from upset test by minimizing a least-square functional of differences between predicted and measured forming loads. Thank to a new development in the DEFORM 3 D, the computation time required for simulating the incremental <b>orbital</b> <b>forming</b> process has been dramatically reduced. The predicted load and the diameter of the formed tab were within 15 % and 2 % of measured values, respectively. Thus, this study showed that 3 D FEM is a reasonably reliable tool for process design in <b>orbital</b> <b>forming...</b>|$|E

Material pre-distribution is applied either by a rolling operation or an <b>orbital</b> <b>forming</b> operation. Both operations produce an adapted semi-finished product to reach a better form filling.

In both cases, the initial electron-transfer step is localized {{on the metal}} centers, but subsequent structural rearrangement results in transfer of the excess charge to the μ-O 2 unit, with concomitant regeneration of the Mn 2 IV/IV core. Two-electron reduction results in population of the O-O σ* orbital and complete cleavage of the O-O bond, whereas two-electron oxidation depopulates the O-O π* <b>orbital,</b> <b>forming</b> molecular oxygen. The coupling between the metal centers (antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic) affects {{the stability of the}} intermediate species, in which the redox process is metal based, and hence influences the kinetic barrier to bond formation or cleavage. Reductive cleavage of the O-O σ bond is favored when the metal centers are antiferromagnetically coupled, whereas oxidative formation of the π component of the O-O bond is favored by ferromagnetic coupling.

For example, in PCl5, if it is supposed that there are five true covalent bonds in which five distinct electron pairs are shared, then the phosphorus would be surrounded by 10 valence electrons in violation of the octet rule. In the early days of quantum mechanics, Pauling proposed that third-row atoms can form five bonds by using one s, three p and one d orbitals, or six bonds by using one s, three p and two d <b>orbitals.</b> To <b>form</b> five bonds, the one s, three p and one d <b>orbitals</b> combine to <b>form</b> five sp3d hybrid orbitals which each share an electron pair with a halogen atom, for a total of 10 shared electrons, two more than the octet rule predicts. Similarly to form six bonds, the six sp3d2 hybrid <b>orbitals</b> <b>form</b> six bonds with 12 shared electrons. In this model the availability of empty d orbitals is used to explain the fact that third-row atoms such as phosphorus and sulfur can form more than four covalent bonds, whereas second-row atoms such as nitrogen and oxygen are strictly limited by the octet rule.|$|R
