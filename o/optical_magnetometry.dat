One such technique, Kerr Magnetometry {{makes use of}} the magneto-optic Kerr effect, or MOKE. In this technique, incident light is directed at the sample’s surface. Light interacts with a magnetized surface nonlinearly so the reflected light has an elliptical polarization, which is then measured by a detector. Another method of <b>optical</b> <b>magnetometry</b> is Faraday Rotation Magnetometry. Faraday Rotation Magnetometry utilizes nonlinear magneto-optical rotation to measure a sample’s magnetization. In this method a Faraday Modulating thin film {{is applied to the}} sample to be measured and a series of images are taken with a camera that senses the polarization of the reflected light. To reduce noise, multiple pictures are then averaged together. One advantage to this method is that it allows mapping of the magnetic characteristics over the surface of a sample. This can be especially useful when studying such things as the Meissner Effect on superconductors. Microfabricated optically pumped magnetometers (µOPMs) can be used to detect the origin of brain seizures more precisely and generate less heat than currently available superconducting quantum interference devices, better known as SQUIDs. The device works by using polarized light to control the spin of rubidium atoms which can be used to measure and monitor the magnetic field.|$|E

Long established as a valuable technique in optical measurements such as gravitational-wave detection, quantum metrology is increasingly being applied to atomic instruments such as matter-wave interferometers, atomic clocks, and atomic magnetometers.

In particular, permanent electric dipole moment (EDM) searches impose strict requirements on magnetic field sensitivity of the underlying atomic or molecular species. Other magnetometer properties [...] such as chemical reactivity, dielectric strength, and interaction cross-sections with other species [...] also impose limitations on experimental conditions. Here, we explore a novel approach to <b>optical</b> <b>magnetometry,</b> using multiphoton transitions of diamagnetic atoms to detect Larmor precession of polarized nuclei. Resonant probes are possible at moderate ultraviolet wavelengths, and hyperfine structure couples spin precession to fluorescence transitions with negligible backgrounds; paramagnetic rotation due to intensity-dependent dispersion may also be detectable. Nuclear spins and nonlinear optical excitation introduce new degrees of freedom, and evade limitations arising from rapid electronic decoherence. This dissertation reports progress towards two-photon <b>optical</b> <b>magnetometry</b> using ytterbium, rubidium, and xenon. We characterize the influence of probe polarization and magnetic fields on fluorescence spectra, for one- and two-photon continuous-wave (cw) excitation of ytterbium. Resolved hyperfine and isotope structure allow us to use spin-zero isotopes for diagnostics and normalization, and we develop analysis for overlapping two-photon resonances. We also report measurements of two-photon excitation in ytterbium and rubidium using picosecond laser pulses, and in xenon using a cw laser. Although hyperfine structure is unresolved, the rubidium measurements are sensitive to probe field polarization. Fluorescence spectra from two-photon excitation of ytterbium with femtosecond pulses show modulation when the repetition rate changes. Although techniques for polarizing noble gas nuclei are mature, existing cell designs are incompatible with two-photon magnetometry.

Current-induced electron spin polarization is shown to produce nuclear hyperpolarization through dynamic nuclear polarization. Saturated nuclear magnetic fields of several millitesla are generated upon the application of electric field over a timescale of minutes in indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) epilayers and measured using <b>optical</b> Larmor <b>magnetometry.</b> We show that, in contrast to previous demonstrations of current-induced dynamic nuclear polarization, the direction of the current relative to the crystal axes and external magnetic field allows for control over the magnitude and direction of the saturation nuclear field. An asymmetry in saturated nuclear magnetic field for anti-parallel currents is found, and ascribed to competing electron spin alignment mechanisms which lead to nuclear polarization which is current-direction independent. The behavior of the saturated nuclear field with temperature, electric field strength, and external magnetic field strength is measured. An unexpected asymmetry in measurements of the change in nuclear field from polarization and depolarization transitions is found and determined {{to be the result of}} an unexpected phase shift in Larmor magnetometric measurements due to previous pulses. Implications for the measurements of nuclear magnetic fields resulting from the phase shift are discussed. Time-resolved Faraday rotation (TRFR) measurements, which have proved transformative in the investigation of spin dynamics in semiconductors, are used to study nuclear polarization. We find that, in materials with spin lifetimes which are on the order of, or greater than, the laser repetition time, the collective effect of spin polarization due to the whole pump pulse train becomes important. A relative phase shift in TRFR measurements is identified which results from these spins. A closed-form expression which describes this phase shift is derived and experimentally validated. Numerical methods are used to characterize this phase shift throughout parameter space. A spin lifetime measurement based on this phase shift is described, and situations in which the model used must be augmented are discussed...|$|R

We describe a complete analogy between our scheme and weak measurement with conventional Gaussian pointers. Instead of a shift in the mean of a Gaussian distribution, an imaginary weak value is exhibited in our scheme by a significantly slower-than-natural exponential distribution of emitted photons at the postselected polarization, leading to a large shift in their mean arrival time.

Extending CPT methods to individual solid-state quantum systems has been only achieved in cryogenic environments for electron spin impurities and superconducting circuits.

To this end, we make use of a three-level system with a Λ-configuration in the microwave domain, which consists of nuclear spin states addressed through their hyperfine coupling to the electron spin of a single nitrogen-vacancy defect in diamond. Dark state pumping requires a relaxation mechanism which, in atomic systems, is simply provided by spontaneous emission. In this work, the relaxation process is externally controlled through incoherent optical pumping and separated in time from consecutive coherent microwave excitations of the nuclear spin Λ-system. Such a pumping scheme with controlled relaxation allows us (i) to monitor the sequential accumulation of population into the dark state and (ii) to reach a new regime of CPT dynamics for which periodic arrays of dark resonances can be observed, owing to multiple constructive interferences.
