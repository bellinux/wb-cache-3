5|$|Once the Thrud strip had run {{its course}} in White Dwarf, Critchlow worked on other comics {{including}} the Judge Dredd/Batman crossover story The Ultimate Riddle, first published in 1995. His work <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>story</b> was fully painted, and while considered impressive was also criticised as being forced, confused and muddy. Critchlow was developing a new style based on line-drawings with computer colouring, but having been pigeon-holed as a painter {{did not believe that}} {{he would be able to}} interest anyone in this very different style.|$|E
5|$|Rotblat {{continued}} to have strong reservations {{about the use of}} science to develop such a devastating weapon. In 1985 he related that at a private dinner at the Chadwicks' house at Los Alamos in March 1944, he was shocked to hear the director of the Manhattan Project, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., say words to the effect that the real purpose in making the bomb was to subdue the Soviets. Historians, notably Barton Bernstein, have cast doubt <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>story.</b>|$|E
5|$|A further {{elaboration}} <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>story</b> {{is possibly}} {{found in a}} chronicle of Wincenty Kadłubek written some three centuries later. The chronicler, inadvertently or intentionally mixing different historic eras, talks of a past Polish war with the army of Alexander the Great. The countless enemy soldiers thrust their way into Poland, and the king himself, having previously subjugated the Pannonians, entered through Moravia {{as if it were}} a back door. He victoriously unfolded the wings of his forces and conquered the Kraków area lands and Silesia, in the process leveling Kraków's ancient city walls. The evidence of a dozen or more gords attacked and destroyed in southern Lesser Poland at the end of 9th century lends some archeological credence to this fanciful version of events.|$|E

25|$|In October 1562 the Queen was {{stricken}} with smallpox, and several modern sources state {{that she was}} cured by Kranich. The story runs that Kranich was summoned when the Queen first fell ill on 10 October. Kranich diagnosed smallpox, whereupon she 'dismissed him as a fool'. However, by 16 October she was so grievously ill that she lapsed into unconsciousness, giving rise to alarmed talk among her councillors of the succession. Henry Carey, 1st Baron Hunsdon, {{is said to have}} forced Kranich, 'some said at the point of a dagger', to resume his treatment of the Queen. Kranich ordered that she be given a potion he had devised, and be wrapped in red flannel and placed close to the fire. Within two hours the Queen is said to have regained consciousness. According to Foot, she rewarded Kranich with a grant which was stopped by Sir William Cecil; however other sources note that in 1562 he was given 100 marks. Doubt has been cast <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>story,</b> however. Bennell terms the tale that Hundson threatened Kranich with a dagger 'a later invention', and Brooks notes that the ultimate source of the story of Kranich's cure of the Queen is the memoirs of Sir Richard Carew, son of the author of The Survey of Cornwall (1602). Carew, writing after 1628, recalled a dinner at his father's home in 1601 or thereabouts at which his father and three other kinsmen of his recounted stories about Kranich, including his treatment of the Queen's smallpox. But Erickson notes that there are 'major discrepancies' between Carew's account, written decades after the fact, and the Spanish ambassador De Quadra's dispatches at the time; she concludes that while it is possible that Burcot treated the Queen for smallpox, Carew's narrative cannot be accepted as accurate.|$|E

500|$|Point du Sable left Chicago in 1800. He {{sold his}} {{property}} to John Kinzie {{and moved to}} Missouri, at that time part of French Louisiana. The reason for his departure is unknown. In her memoir, Juliette Kinzie suggested that [...] "perhaps he was disgusted at not being elected to a similar dignity [...] by the Pottowattamies." [...] In 1874 Nehemiah Matson elaborated <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>story,</b> claiming that Point du Sable was a slave from Virginia who had moved with his master to Lexington, Kentucky in 1790.

500|$|The park {{played an}} {{important}} role during World War I and was used for cavalry training. On 7 December 1915 English inventor Harry Grindell Matthews demonstrated, in a secret test on Pen Ponds, how selenium cells would work in a [...] remotely controlled prototype weapon for use against German Zeppelins. Reporting <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>story</b> several years later, in April 1924, The Daily Chronicle reported that the test had been carried out in the presence of Lord Balfour, Lord Fisher and a staff of experts.

Between 1916 and 1925 the park housed a South African military war hospital, which was built between Bishop's Pond and Conduit Wood. The hospital closed in 1921 and was demolished in 1925. Richmond Cemetery, just outside the park, contains a section of war graves commemorating 39 soldiers who died at the hospital; the section is marked by a Cross of Sacrifice and a grade II listed cenotaph designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens.|$|E
500|$|The VC was {{introduced}} on 29 January 1856 by Queen Victoria to reward acts of valour during the Crimean War. The traditional {{explanation of the}} source of the gunmetal from which the medals are struck is that it derives from Russian cannon captured at the siege of Sevastopol. Recent research has thrown doubt <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>story,</b> suggesting a variety of origins. The original Royal Warrant did not contain a specific clause regarding posthumous awards, although official policy was to not award the VC posthumously. Between 1897 and 1901, several notices were issued in the London Gazette regarding soldiers who would have been awarded the VC had they survived. In a partial reversal of policy in 1902, six of the soldiers mentioned were granted the VC, but not [...] "officially" [...] awarded the medal. In 1907, the posthumous policy was completely reversed and medals were sent to the next of kin of the six officers and men. The Victoria Cross warrant was not officially amended to explicitly allow posthumous awards until 1920 but one quarter of all awards for the First World War were posthumous.|$|E

500|$|As with Kasumi's, Ayane's age has {{not been}} listed in the Western {{versions}} of the games to avoid backlash regarding characters portrayed as underage; according to Itagaki, Ayane's age in Ninja Gaiden would [...] "cause problems with the ESRB." [...] Nevertheless, some outlets raised this issue and questioned the extent of adolescent Ayane's sexualization in the games (in Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 players were even given control over the movement of her breasts through use of the Sixaxis game controller). Destructoid's Jim Sterling has voiced concern about how a supposedly 14-year-old character (Ayane's Sigma 2 age) has such [...] "huge busters", as well as joking he was [...] "worried that this now means I'm a pedophile."

ABC News mistakenly used GamesRadar's joke image of Ayane [...] "with the newly attached pterodactyl head and wings of Metroid boss Ridley" [...] as an illustration for their article while reporting <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>story.</b> Reacting to the Nordic ban, Sterling (writing for GameFront) called her a [...] "big-eyed lump of grade-A jailbait" [...] and added: [...] "Would it murder the fantasy of the fanbase if the girl was canonically 21, despite still looking like an eleven-year-old hormone pill addict?

[...] Ayane became canonically 18-year-old in Dead or Alive 5. Regarding the other changes in DOA5, according to Kotaku, director Yohei Shimbori received a lot of [...] "fan backlash from Ayane's breast reduction."
