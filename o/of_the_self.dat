5|$|Sir Bernard Arthur Owen Williams, FBA (21 September 1929– 10 June 2003) was an English moral philosopher. His {{publications}} include Problems <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Self</b> (1973), Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy (1985), Shame and Necessity (1993), and Truth and Truthfulness (2002). He was knighted in 1999.|$|E
2500|$|Shame is a painful, social {{emotion that}} can be seen as {{resulting}} [...] "...from comparison <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>self's</b> action with <b>the</b> <b>self's</b> standards...". but which may equally stem from comparison <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>self's</b> state <b>of</b> being with <b>the</b> ideal social context's standard. Thus, shame may stem from volitional action or simply self-regard; no action by the shamed being is required: simply existing is enough. Both the comparison and standards are enabled by socialization. Though usually considered an emotion, shame may also variously be considered an affect, cognition, state, or condition.|$|R

Plants {{that are highly}} selfing typically exhibit a suite of morphological traits termed a "selfing syndrome," including reduced corollas and reproductive structures, loss of corolla pigmentation, little anther-stigma separation, and a low pollen/ovule ratio. The overall consensus among scientist is that the morphological changes that accompany <b>the</b> transition to <b>selfing</b> are adaptive and thus a product of natural selection.

5|$|Eugenio Espejo was an autodidact, and {{he claimed}} with pride {{that he never}} left any book in his hands unread, and if he did, he would {{make up for it}} by observing nature. However, his desire to read {{everything}} indiscriminately sometimes led him to hasty judgments, which appear in his manuscripts. Through his own written work, it can be inferred that Espejo considered education as the main means for popular development. He understood that reading was basic in the formation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>self,</b> and his conscience drove him to critiques of the establishment, based on observation and in the application of the law of his time.|$|E
5|$|In 2002 the {{researchers}} Pelham, Mirenberg, and Jones explored Casler's first explanation, arguing {{that people have}} a basic desire {{to feel good about}} themselves and behave according to that desire. These automatic positive associations would influence feelings about almost anything associated with the self. Given the mere ownership effect, which states that people like things more if they own them, {{the researchers}} theorised that people would develop an affection for objects and concepts that are associated with the self, such as their name. They called this unconscious power implicit egotism. Uri Simonsohn suggested that implicit egotism only applies to cases where people are nearly indifferent between options, and therefore it would not apply to major decisions such as career choices. Low-stakes decisions such as choosing a charity would show an effect. Raymond Smeets theorised that if implicit egotism stems from a positive evaluation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>self,</b> then people with low self-esteem would not gravitate towards choices associated with the self, but possibly away from them. A lab experiment confirmed this.|$|E

5|$|Process ethics, Palmer argues, {{is closer}} to individualist consequentialism than individualist deontological {{environmental}} ethics. In considering collectivist environmental ethics, Palmer asks how process thinkers could approach natural collectives, such as ecosystems. She argues that Whitehead could view them as single entities with a good of their own, while Hartshorne could not. The primary difference between process ethics and collectivist environmental ethics, however, is that the former has a theological basis. The advocates of deep ecology have previously sought support from the views of Whitehead; two affinities are the shared holism and a shared concern with the extension <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>self,</b> but Palmer finds that the views of Whitehead and {{the views of the}} deep ecology advocate Arne Næss differ in these areas.|$|E
5|$|Zhu Xi {{was one of}} {{many critics}} who argued that {{government}} schools did not sufficiently encourage personal cultivation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>self</b> and molded students into officials who cared only for profit and salary. Not all social and political philosophers in the Song period blamed the examination system as {{the root of the problem}} (but merely as a method of recruitment and selection), emphasizing instead the gentry's failure to take responsibility in society as the cultural elite. Zhu Xi also laid emphasis on the Four Books, a series of Confucian classics that would become the official introduction of education for all Confucian students, yet were initially discarded by his contemporaries. After his death, his commentary on the Four Books found appeal amongst scholar-officials and in 1241 his writings were adopted as mandatory readings for examination candidates with the support of Emperor Lizong (r. 1224–1264).|$|E
5|$|Nietzsche {{rejected}} fundamental {{components of}} Kant's ethics, particularly his argument that morality, God, and immorality, {{can be shown}} through reason. Nietzsche cast suspicion {{on the use of}} moral intuition, which Kant used as the foundation of his morality, arguing that it has no normative force in ethics. He further attempted to undermine key concepts in Kant's moral psychology, such as the will and pure reason. Like Kant, Nietzsche developed a concept of autonomy; however, he rejected Kant's idea that valuing our own autonomy requires us to respect the autonomy of others. A naturalist reading of Nietzsche's moral psychology stands contrary to Kant's conception of reason and desire. Under the Kantian model, reason is a fundamentally different motive to desire because it has the capacity to stand back from a situation and make an independent decision. Nietzsche conceives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>self</b> as a social structure of all our different drives and motivations; thus, when it seems that our intellect has made a decision against our drives, it is actually just an alternative drive taking dominance over another. This is in direct contrast with Kant's view of the intellect as opposed to instinct; instead, it is just another instinct. There is thus no self-capable of standing back and making a decision; the decision the self-makes is simply determined by the strongest drive. Kantian commentators have argued that Nietzsche's practical philosophy requires the existence of a self-capable of standing back in the Kantian sense. For an individual to create values of their own, which is a key idea in Nietzsche's philosophy, they must be able to conceive of themselves as a unified agent. Even if the agent is influenced by their drives, he must regard them as his own, which undermines Nietzsche's conception of autonomy.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>selfing</b> {{syndrome}} {{constitutes a}} suite of floral and reproductive trait changes that have evolved repeatedly across many evolutionary lineages in response to <b>the</b> shift to <b>selfing.</b> Convergent evolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>selfing</b> syndrome suggests that these changes are adaptive, yet our understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> detailed molecular genetic basis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>selfing</b> syndrome remains limited. Here, we investigate <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> cis-regulatory changes during <b>the</b> recent evolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>selfing</b> syndrome in Capsella rubella, which split from the outcrosser Capsella grandiflora less than 200 ka. We assess allele-specific expression (ASE) in leaves and flower buds at a total of 18, 452 genes in three interspecific F 1 C. grandiflora x C. rubella hybrids. Using a hierarchical Bayesian approach that accounts for technical variation using genomic reads, we find evidence for extensive cis-regulatory changes. On average, 44 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> assayed genes show evidence of ASE; however, only 6 % show strong allelic expression biases. Flower buds, but not leaves, show an enrichment of cis-regulatory changes in genomic regions responsible for floral and reproductive trait divergence between C. rubella and C. grandiflora. We further detected an excess of heterozygous transposable element (TE) insertions near genes with ASE, and TE insertions targeted by uniquely mapping 24 -nt small RNAs were associated with reduced expression of nearby genes. Our results suggest that cis-regulatory changes have been important during the recent adaptive floral evolution in Capsella and that differences in TE dynamics between selfing and outcrossing species could be important for rapid regulatory divergence in association with mating system shifts...|$|R
