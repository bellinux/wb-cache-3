5000|$|Tavares (Citrus japonica 'Margarita' [...] Citrus aurantiifolia) - Key lime crossed with <b>oval</b> <b>kumquat</b> (though {{there is}} some {{speculation}} that it is actually a lemon/kumquat hybrid), fruit is larger and more elongated and color at maturity is more orange than other limequats. It was named after the city of Tavares, Florida.|$|E
50|$|When the kumquats {{are divided}} into {{multiple}} species, the name Fortunella margarita (or Citrus margarita) is used for this group. The <b>oval</b> <b>kumquat</b> is also called the Nagami kumquat. The unusual feature of the Nagami kumquat is in the eating of the fruit. The fruit is eaten whole, skin and all. The inside is still quite sour, but the skin has the sweeter flavour, when eaten together it produces an unusual tart-sweet, refreshing flavour. Fruit ripens mid to late winter and always crops very heavily, making a spectacular display against the dark green foliage. The tree is smaller growing and dwarf in nature, making it ideal for pots and has even been used in bonsai.|$|E
5000|$|The Meiwa kumquat, {{a hybrid}} of a round and an <b>oval</b> <b>kumquat,</b> and the Satsuma {{mandarin}} are the two fruits {{that were used to}} parent the Nippon orangequat. Both of these fruits are able to withstand cooler climates, the meiwa being partially dormant in the winter months [...] and the satsuma maturing in October to December. Since both of these citruses are able to grow in the colder season, the orangequat inherited that trait and is also grown and harvested in the colder seasons. Both of the parents of the orangequat are grown in many countries of the world, like China, Japan, South Africa, and the United States of America. However, orangequats are typically grown in the United States, mainly in the Southern states like Florida and Alabama, but they are also grown in California and other Western states.|$|E
