50|$|The volcano has {{a height}} of {{approximately}} 1 km and a circumference of severall kilometres/miles. The volcano was formed about 160 million years ago, {{during a time of}} <b>orogenesis</b> on the European continent. The eruptions were short and severe with heavy explosions. This, along with the mineral composition, points to volcanic activity as a result of subduction far away from the volcano. During the Cimmerian Orogeny, the Cimmerian Plate collided with Kazakhstania, sending shock waves through the Eurasian Plate, resulting in volcanism.|$|E
50|$|As tectonic plates converge, {{the closing}} of an ocean {{will result in the}} {{convergence}} of two landmasses, each of which is either an island arc or continental margin. When these two bodies collide, the result is <b>orogenesis,</b> at which time the underthrusting oceanic crust slows down. In early stages of arc-continent collision, there is uplift and erosion of the accretionary prism and forearc basin. In the later stages of collision, the forearc region may be sutured, rotated and shortened which can form syn-collisional folds and thrust belts.|$|E
50|$|An orogen may {{be almost}} {{completely}} eroded away, and only recognizable by studying (old) rocks that bear traces of <b>orogenesis.</b> Orogens are usually long, thin, arcuate tracts of rock {{that have a}} pronounced linear structure resulting in terranes or blocks of deformed rocks, separated generally by suture zones or dipping thrust faults. These thrust faults carry relatively thin slices of rock (which are called nappes or thrust sheets, and differ from tectonic plates) from {{the core of the}} shortening orogen out toward the margins, and are intimately associated with folds and the development of metamorphism.|$|E
5000|$|The Nevadan orogeny {{occurred}} {{along the}} western margin of North America during the Middle Jurassic to Early Cretaceous time which is approximately from 155 Ma to 145 Ma. [...] Throughout the duration of this orogeny {{there were at least}} two different kinds of orogenic processes occurring. During the early stages of <b>orogenesis</b> an [...] "Andean type" [...] continental magmatic arc developed due to subduction of an oceanic plate beneath the North American Plate. The latter stages of <b>orogenesis,</b> in contrast, saw multiple oceanic arc terranes accreted onto the western margin of North America in a [...] "Cordilleran type" [...] accretionary orogen. Deformation related to the accretion of these volcanic arc terranes is mostly limited to the western regions of the resulting mountain ranges (Klamath Mountain range and Sierra Nevada Mountains) and is absent from the eastern regions. In addition, the deformation experienced in these mountain ranges is mostly due to the Nevadan orogeny and not other external events such as the more recent Sevier and Laramide Orogenies. It is noted that the Klamath Mountains and the Sierra Nevada mountains share similar stratigraphy indicating that they were both formed by the Nevadan orogeny. In comparison with other orogenic events, it appears that the Nevadan Orogeny occurred rather quickly taking only about 10 million years as compared to hundreds of millions of years for other orogenies around the World (ex. Trans-Hudson orogeny).|$|E
50|$|Northern Asia {{is built}} around the Angara Shield, which lies between the Yenisey River and the Lena River.

These rocks {{can be found in}} the Angara Shield, the Inner Mongolian-Korean Shield, the Ordes Shield and the Southeast Asia Shield. The fragments have been subject to <b>orogenesis</b> around their margins, giving a complex of plateaux and mountain ranges. One can find outcrops of these rocks in unfolded sections of the Shields. Their presence has been confirmed below Mesozoic and later sediments.|$|E
50|$|The Sierra Nevada and the Klamath Mountains {{were the}} result of Continental magmatic arc and then Oceanic arc {{accretion}} during the Nevadan Orogeny between 155-145 Ma. At nearly the same time the Eastern Belt of the Sierra Nevada Mountains was forming, the Western Hayfork Terrane of the Klamath Mountains was being constructed. As the Nevadan Orogeny progressed, the Tuolumne River Terrane was accreted to the Sierra Nevada Mountains at approximately {{the same time as the}} formation of the Josephine Ophiolite in the Klamath Mountains (150-155 Ma). During the last stages of <b>orogenesis,</b> the sedimentary rocks of the Western Belt were accreted to the Sierra Nevada Mountains while the Abrams and Salmon mica schists were thrust ontop of the Stuart Fork Formation in the Klamath Mountains.|$|E
50|$|In {{a slower}} process, {{radioactive}} decay of {{atoms in the}} core of the Earth releases heat. This thermal energy drives plate tectonics and may lift mountains, via <b>orogenesis.</b> This slow lifting represents a kind of gravitational potential energy storage of the thermal energy, which may be later released to active kinetic energy in landslides, after a triggering event. Earthquakes also release stored elastic potential energy in rocks, a store that has been produced ultimately from the same radioactive heat sources. Thus, according to present understanding, familiar events such as landslides and earthquakes release energy that has been stored as potential energy in the Earth's gravitational field or elastic strain (mechanical potential energy) in rocks. Prior to this, they represent release of energy that has been stored in heavy atoms since the collapse of long-destroyed supernova stars created these atoms.|$|E
50|$|Uplifting of {{the north}} of the Kaapvaal Craton, in {{addition}} to <b>orogenesis</b> (mountain formation), {{towards the end of the}} deposition of the “West Rand Group” of sediments caused the Witwatersrand sea to retreat. The area of the craton on top of which Johannesburg is now situated, became a vast riverine plain, which extended along the entire northern and western shoreline of the shrunken sea. The rivers formed braided deltas with many interlacing, slow flowing channels where all the heavy materials brought down from the mountains were deposited: large pebbles, and heavy minerals, such as gold, iron pyrite, and uraninite. The gold was in its elemental metal form. Cyanobacteria grew in relative abundance in these mineral rich waters. The kerogen that is found in association with the gold deposits almost certainly represents what remains of these Archean photosynthesizing micro-organisms.|$|E
5000|$|The {{onset of}} Cordilleran <b>orogenesis</b> {{began in the}} Middle Jurassic time, {{as a result of}} the breakup of Pangea and North American plate motion toward {{subduction}} zones at the western margin. Most of the Canadian Cordillera today consists of numerous tectonostratigraphic terranes that were accreted to the stable margin of North America from the Jurassic to Early Tertiary as a result of eastward and northward drifting island arcs that collided with the continental lithosphere of North America. These terranes were accreted due to upper-crustal rocks being detached from the denser lower-crustal and proto-Pacific upper mantle lithosphere that was subducted under the North American craton. The allochthonous upper crustal terranes were juxtaposed over top of each other and over the western margin of the North American craton along a system of interconnected, northeast and southwest verging major thrust faults.|$|E
5000|$|Gambusia quadruncus, {{known as}} the llanos mosquitofish, is a species of bony fish in the genus Gambusia that lives in east-central Mexico.

50|$|The rocks {{observed}} on the Yalours and surrounding areas are predominantly igneous intrusives that have cooled deep under ground. The main rock type is grey to black gabbro composed of small crystals of grey-white feldspar and black pyroxene. The rocks here were formed by {{much the same}} process {{that the rest of}} the peninsula was formed; the Pacific plate sliding under the Antarctic Peninsula in an ocean/continent subduction-type tectonic event. This process, called <b>orogenesis,</b> is one of the most common ways for a mountain chain to form. The Andres and the coast ranges of North America are other classic examples of this type of tectonism. The mountain building has nearly stopped though; it is only at the very tip of the peninsula and in the South Shetland Islands that the process continues. For the rest of the peninsula, it erosion and gravity’s turn to shape the landscape.|$|E

50|$|Thick-skinned {{deformation}} is {{most commonly}} {{a result of}} crustal shortening and occurs when the region is undergoing horizontal compression. This frequently occurs in at the sites of continental collisions where <b>orogenesis,</b> or mountain building, is taking place and during which the crust is shortened horizontally and thickened vertically. The massive compressional forces involved in such a collision cause the basement rock {{and all of the}} units above it to deform. Deformation occurs in the form of both folds and thrust faults and may form a fold and thrust belt along the collisional zone or as crustal flow.At convergent plate boundaries two plates move towards each other as one is subducted downwards beneath the other but when the crust of two continents meet at a convergent zone neither one of them will be subducted due to their low density. As the two continents are pushed together by tectonic processes a large amount of stress is put on the rock. Eventually deformation will occur in one or multiple ways in order to relieve the stress.|$|E
