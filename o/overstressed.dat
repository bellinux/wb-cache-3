A {{very small number of}} cycles of <b>overstress</b> applied intermittently during {{a very large number of}} cycies of understress below threshold caused significant acceleration, of about one hundred times, in crack growth rate as compared to the case of steady cyclic stress in the cases of moist air, dry air and nitrogen. In the region of low understress, the acceleration in moist air was appreciably less than that in dry air and nitrogen due to oxide-induced crack closure. The acceleration in vacuum was smaller than that in other environments over all understress levels, possibly because of reweiding.

40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} of dynamic earthquake rupture require an artificial initiation procedure, {{if they are}} not integrated in long-term earthquake cycle simulations. A widely applied procedure involves an ‘overstressed asperity’, a localized region stressed beyond the static frictional strength. The physical properties of the asperity (size, shape and <b>overstress)</b> may significantly impact rupture propagation. In particular, to induce a sustained rupture the asperity size needs to exceed a critical value. Although criteria for estimating the critical nucleation size under linear slip-weakening friction have been proposed for 2 -D and 3 -D problems based on simplifying assumptions, they do not provide general rules for designing 3 -D numerical simulations. We conduct a parametric study to estimate parameters of the asperity that minimize numerical artefacts (e. g. changes of rupture shape and speed, artificial supershear transition, higher slip-rate amplitudes). We examine the critical size of square, circular and elliptical asperities as a function of asperity <b>overstress</b> and background (off-asperity) stress. For a given <b>overstress,</b> we find that asperity area controls rupture initiation while asperity shape is of lesser importance. The critical area obtained from our numerical results contrasts with published theoretical estimates when background stress is low. Therefore, we derive two new theoretical estimates of the critical size under low background stress while also accounting for <b>overstress.</b> Our numerical results suggest that setting the asperity <b>overstress</b> and area close to their critical values eliminates strong numerical artefacts even when the <b>overstress</b> is large. We also find that properly chosen asperity size or <b>overstress</b> may significantly shorten the duration of the initiation. Overall, our results provide guidelines for determining the size of the asperity and <b>overstress</b> to minimize the effects of the forced initiation on the subsequent spontaneous rupture propagation...|$|R

40|$|Viscoplasticity {{is mostly}} {{modelled}} by the flowstress approach, where the flowstress (Y) {{is a function}} of pressure, temperature, plastic strain and strain rate Y(P,T, εp, ε̇). For dynamic Viscoplasticity the flowstress approach is used in hydrocodes together with the radial return algorithm, to determine deviatoric stress components in each computational cell and for each time step. The flowstress approach assumes that during plastic loading, the flowstress in stress space follows the current stress point (current Y). Unloading of a computational cell is therefore always elastic. The <b>overstress</b> approach to dynamic viscoplasticity was used in various versions in the 1950 s and early 1960 s, before the advent of hydrocodes. By the <b>overstress</b> approach a state point may move out of the quasistatic flow surface upon loading, and hence the term <b>overstress.</b> When this happens, the state point tends to fall back (or relax) onto the quasistatic flow surface through plastic flow, and the rate of this relaxation is an increasing function of the amount of <b>overstress.</b> In the paper we first outline in detail how these two approaches to dynamic viscoplasticity work, and then show an example for which the <b>overstress</b> approach has an advantage over the flowstress approach. The example has to do with elastic precursor decay in planar impact, and with the phenomenon of anomalous thermal strengthening, revealed recently in planar impact tests. The <b>overstress</b> approach has an advantage whenever plastic flow during unloading is of importance...|$|R
40|$|From time to {{time during}} the past 150 years, discussions have emerged {{about the idea of}} <b>overstress</b> in {{children}} [...] that excessive intellectual activity is harmful to the mind and body and can cause death. Using Philadelphia and Boston as case studies, this dissertation analyzes primary source materials to examine several episodes of intense concern about childhood stress. Drawing on newspaper articles, teachers 2 ̆ 7 journals, board of education reports, and medical literature, it demonstrates that childhood stress has been perceived as a longstanding and recurrent problem. ^ Concern about <b>overstress</b> directed public attention to the needs of children. Journalists brought the issue to public attention and tried to pressure school officials to change aspects of the school environment thought to foster <b>overstress.</b> This discussion led to changes in the schools. In 1868, the Philadelphia Board of Education abolished all homework. In both Boston and Philadelphia, other changes were enacted in the school regimen. Hours of study were shortened and there were attempts to downplay competition. ^ Girls were thought to be more vulnerable to <b>overstress</b> than boys, and public outcry frequently focused on adolescent girls. I highlight early battles in both cities over education and social roles for young women and demonstrate the ways in which <b>overstress</b> has served as a symbolic focus for the conflict over women 2 ̆ 7 s education. In 1865, after the Boston Medical and Surgical Journal recorded the special concern of physicians about the well-being of girls the Boston School Committee appointed a committee to narrow the curriculum. In 1903, after reports of the deaths of students in Philadelphia 2 ̆ 7 s Girls 2 ̆ 7 Normal School and High School, 2, 000 citizens petitioned the Board of Education to lessen the amount of homework. ^ <b>Overstress</b> touched the core tensions about socialization in American society, and debate about <b>overstress</b> involved competition among self-proclaimed 2 ̆ 2 experts 2 ̆ 2 for authority over socialization. An investigation of the controversies about <b>overstress</b> reveals the encroachment of 2 ̆ 2 experts 2 ̆ 2 into the family 2 ̆ 7 s domain of child-rearing.

40|$|Wrinkles in {{thin films}} on soft {{substrates}} {{have been shown}} to self-organize into topological patterns, providing a possible route towards inexpensive generation of surface microstructure. However, the effect of the magnitude of applied stress in relation to the critical buckling stress, or <b>overstress,</b> on the observed patterns has until this point been neglected experimentally. In this paper, we investigate the effect of <b>overstress</b> using poly(dimethylsiloxane) which has been surface-oxidized with a UV-ozone oxidation technique. Using a swelling-based stress application technique, where the applied swelling stress in the thin film is controlled by changing the concentration of vapor-phase swelling agent (ethanol) in a sealed swelling chamber, we are able to impart swelling stresses below, at, and well above the critical stress. We observe a transition from hexagonally packed dimples at low <b>overstress</b> to ridge-based morphologies (herringbone and labyrinth) at high <b>overstress.</b> The observed dimple structures are remarkably widespread, and the hexagonal arrangement of these dimples is confirmed using Fourier analysis. Although analytical results predict that a square arrangement of dimples is preferred to hexagonal for flat wrinkling surfaces, hexagonal arrays are nonetheless unilaterally observed at low <b>overstress.</b> We attribute this observation to an inherent curvature that develops in the swelling film. The <b>overstress</b> is quantified by measuring the radius of curvature of swelling bilayer beams, both confirming the preferential swelling of the surface oxide layer by ethanol and quantifying the swelling extent. Effects of non-equibiaxial stress are investigated by inducing a compressive prestress prior to swelling, and “trapped” non-equilibrium morphologies are discussed briefly...|$|R

Results on thermal <b>overstress</b> and electrical <b>overstress</b> experiments are presented. In addition, preliminary results toward the development of physics-based degradation models are presented focusing on the electrolyte evaporation failure mechanism. An empirical degradation model based on percentage capacitance loss under electrical <b>overstress</b> is presented and used in: (i) a Bayesian-based implementation of model-based prognostics using a discrete Kalman filter for health state estimation, and (ii) a dynamic system representation of the degradation model for forecasting and remaining useful life (RUL) estimation. A leave-one-out validation methodology is used to assess the validity of the methodology under the small sample size constrain. The results observed on the RUL estimation are consistent through the validation tests comparing relative accuracy and prediction error. It has been observed that the inaccuracy of the model to represent the change in degradation behavior observed {{at the end of the}} test data is consistent throughout the validation tests, indicating the need of a more detailed degradation model or the use of an algorithm that could estimate model parameters on-line. Based on the observed degradation process under different stress intensity with rest periods, the need for more sophisticated degradation models is further supported.
