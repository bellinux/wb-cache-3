Their back catalog which was {{initially}} issued on The Echo Label, was later re-issued by Sony Music Entertainment, thus allowing the distribution of this material to continue.|$|E

5|$|For the new {{generation}} of students, producers auditioned over six hundred school-aged children in an attempt to provide characters to which the teenaged target-audience could relate. The decision to cast age-similar actors was purposeful to contrast the series from <b>other</b> <b>shows</b> of the same period such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Dawson's Creek, which had cast actors in their twenties as teenagers.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to composition, O'Donnell also arranges his work. He created a special arrangement {{that was used}} for a Halo 3 segment of Video Games Live in London, after which O'Donnell appeared. He has also appeared with and without Salvatori at <b>other</b> <b>shows</b> featuring his music, including later Video Games Live tours and Play! A Video Game Symphony.|$|E
5|$|Sharks {{tend to be}} seen {{quite often}} in {{cartoons}} whenever a scene involves the ocean. Such examples include the Tom and Jerry cartoons, Jabberjaw, and <b>other</b> <b>shows</b> produced by Hanna-Barbera. They also are used commonly as a clichéd means of killing off a character that is held up by a rope or some similar object as the sharks swim right below them, or the character may be standing on a plank above shark infested waters.|$|E

5|$|The {{first series}} {{received}} a mixed critical reception, with some reviewers concerned {{that it is}} too derivative and predictable, while others were more positive. The producers were happy to have started well, survived the ratings lull in the middle, and ended with an upward curve in the last two weeks. Audience breakdowns indicate that a higher proportion of younger viewers were tuning in to Survivors than many <b>other</b> <b>shows.</b>|$|E
5|$|The show {{takes place}} at the fictional Greendale Community College in Greendale, Colorado. Harmon based the show on his own {{experiences}} in community college, and partly modeled the character of Jeff Winger on himself. He emphasized the cast's importance to the show, and also credited some of the actors for their improvisational skills. The episode attracted generally favorable reviews from critics, who praised both the actors and the comedy writing. The show received good viewership, and stood out in NBC's Thursday lineup, where the network's <b>other</b> <b>shows</b> suffered declines in ratings.|$|E
5|$|Before each episode, Steel {{researches}} {{the history}} of the place in which he is going to perform. His research interests include local notable people, landmarks, customs and humorous anecdotes. The majority of the research sometimes took place close to the actual recording date. For example, Steel carried out almost no research for his episode in Walsall until ten days before the recording. In Merthyr Tydfil he spent three days in the town, where he carried out research and met locals. He then performs a tailor-made show about the town in front of a local audience. The style of the programme is similar to <b>other</b> <b>shows</b> starring Steel, such as The Mark Steel Lectures, in which Steel presented a humorous lecture about a famous person in history.|$|E
50|$|As in Katims's <b>other</b> <b>show,</b> Friday Night Lights, three {{cameras were}} used for shooting, placed at {{both sides of a}} scene. There usually were no table reads prior to the filming of an episode, a process {{otherwise}} often used in <b>other</b> television <b>shows.</b>|$|R

5|$|Early {{pressings}} of {{the sleeve}} {{were presented in}} a six-panel gatefold cover, with one side displaying the landscape in the daytime, whilst the <b>other</b> <b>shows</b> the same image at night, playing {{with the idea that}} during the day, the countryside is glorious and the city is dull and grey, whereas at nighttime the countryside is dark and the city is illuminated and alive. To prioritize the design, no text was included on the sleeve apart from a promotional sticker shaped like a red balloon featuring the band's name and album title. Later copies of the album came in a standard plastic case with a protective cardboard sleeve.|$|E
5|$|MDNA World Tour is {{the fourth}} live album by American singer and {{songwriter}} Madonna. It was released on September 6, 2013, by Interscope Records as a full concert on all formats including a double-disc CD, DVD, and Blu-ray. Madonna had embarked on The MDNA Tour for promotion of her twelfth studio album MDNA. The tour was a commercial success although it courted a number of controversies. The performances at the American Airlines Arena in Miami, Florida during the North American leg of The MDNA Tour were documented for video release. The recording was directed by Danny B. Tull and Stephane Sennour who included footage from <b>other</b> <b>shows</b> of the tour.|$|E
5|$|Speight {{worked on}} {{numerous}} <b>other</b> <b>shows,</b> ranging from children's television to adult factual programmes. His children's television credits include playing the Abominable No Man in Timmy Mallett's Timmy Towers and presenting Beat the Cyborgs, Name That Toon, On Your Marks, Insides Out, and History Busters, {{the last of}} which won a Royal Television Society Award. Speight also worked on This Morning, The Heaven and Earth Show, The Big Breakfast and was a contestant in ITV's Celebrity Wrestling. Speight also played the king on children's programme See It Saw It, where he met Natasha Collins. Collins was seriously injured after {{being hit by a}} car in 2001, and had to leave See It Saw It. Speight began dating her in 2003, and they became engaged in Barbados in 2005. They planned to get married in fancy dress and Speight joked that the wedding might feature monkeys, his favourite animal.|$|E

5|$|The five {{previous}} {{series of}} One Foot in the Grave were produced {{and directed by}} Susan Belbin. She had retired because of ill health. Renwick persuaded her {{to return to work}} on the final series to provide continuity, but her health quickly forced her to resign from the show again. The final series was produced by Jonathon P. Llewellyn and directed by Christine Gernon. Wilson and Renwick felt that Gernon's experience working with Belbin on the earlier series of One Foot as a production secretary and assistant, as well as on <b>other</b> <b>shows,</b> meant that her style was similar to Belbin's, which would aid the transition between directors.|$|E
5|$|When the 2013 festival {{began in}} Park City, Utah, the secrecy {{about the movie}} continued. The festival's website only {{identified}} the setting as a theme park. Nan Chalat-Noaker, critic for the Park Record, recalls that the festival and even the film's publicist were unwilling to share further details about the film, but strongly urged critics to see it. In her review, she declined to identify {{the setting of the}} film by name, although she dropped broad hints, out of fear it would alert Disney's lawyers. The premiere, on the festival's first night, was not fully attended; when word got out to the attendees, all the <b>other</b> <b>shows</b> were effectively sold out.|$|E
5|$|On December 29, 2006, Nielsen Media Research (NMR) {{reported}} {{the results of}} having, for the first time, monitored viewers who use a digital video recorder to record shows for later viewing. NMR reported that 30 Rock adds nearly 7.5% to its total audience every week {{as a result of}} viewers who use a DVR to record the show and then watch it within a week of its initial airing. A March 2007 report from MAGNA Global, based on NMR data about viewership ranked by among adults 25–54, shows that as of the time of the report 30 Rocks viewers have a median income of $65,000, high enough to place the show tied at 11th in affluence with several <b>other</b> <b>shows.</b> This is during a period where for the season 30 Rock is tied at number 85 in the 18–49 demographic. During its second season, 30 Rock ranked in fourth place, against all primetime programming, for television series which are watched by viewers with income above $100,000. Following Fey's popular impressions of Alaskan governor Sarah Palin on Saturday Night Live, the third-season premiere was seen by 8.5million viewers, making it the highest-viewed episode in the series. The premiere earned a 4.1 preliminary adults 18–49 rating, an increase of 21% from the second-season premiere.|$|E

5|$|On October 6, 2016, Nickelodeon {{announced}} that Double Dare would {{be returning to}} television for a half-hour commemorative special celebrating the 30th anniversary of the show's premiere. The Double Dare Reunion Special aired on November 23, 2016, on Nick at Nite, with a special encore airing on The Splat. The special included vintage clips, behind-the-scenes footage, and a new game recorded at San Diego Comic-Con 2016 played by cast members from All That. Marc Summers, announcer Harvey, and stage assistant Robin Russo (née Marrella) appeared in the special. The Double Dare Reunion Special was watched by 1.126 million viewers on Nick at Nite, outperforming all <b>other</b> <b>shows</b> on the network for the evening, and finishing as the third-most viewed of all non-sports original cable telecasts among viewers ages 18 to 34 for that day. In {{the first half of}} 2017, Marc Summers stated that due {{to the success of the}} special, he is in negotiations to return to Double Dare in some form with Nickelodeon, possibly in a version with adult contestants on Nick at Nite.|$|E
5|$|The Simpson Family Smile-Time Variety Hour is {{a parody}} of the 1960s and 1970s live variety shows. Mainly it is {{a parody of}} The Brady Bunch Hour, a {{short-lived}} spin-off of the 1970s sitcom The Brady Bunch. The replacement of Lisa in the third segment with another girl reflects the recasting of Jan Brady in the Brady Bunch Hour when Eve Plumb refused to participate. The Simpson family is {{made to look like}} The Partridge Family. Also, the segment holds numerous references to Laugh-In. Kent Brockman introduces the show from inside a broadcast booth in a style similar to Laugh-In, there is a joke wall similar to the one in Laugh-In where The Sea Captain opens a porthole. There is also a Laugh-In-like montage wherein other characters comment on the skit itself. When Hans Moleman reads a poem, it is based on Henry Gibson reading a poem on Laugh-In. <b>Other</b> <b>shows</b> parodied during the variety show include The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour, and The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour.|$|E
