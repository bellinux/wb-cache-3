His songs {{have appeared on}} more than 50 compilation CDs, and he has made nearly 40 guest appearances on the albums of artists including Lori McKenna, David Wilcox and Mark Erelli. When {{asked if he would}} rather play the 19,600-seat Fleet Theater or the 900-seat Somerville Theater – both in Boston, Paul replied, [...] "I prefer to keep it intimate. That way people can see the whites <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>eyes.</b> I'd love to write a hit song and have it on the radio like [...] "American Pie" [...] or something, but I'm just gonna do what I do and take what I can and run with it, because it's a hard business to have even what I have. So I don't have [...] Springsteen-esque hopes. I just want to write great songs." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Objection (Tango)" [...] {{was written}} by Shakira and co-produced by the singer along with Lester Mendez. It is a {{combination}} of pop rock and tango, a style of fast-paced ballroom dance music that originated in Argentina and Uruguay. According to the sheet music of [...] "Objection (Tango)" [...] published at MusicNotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, it is written in the key of B minor and has a half note metronome of 66 beats per minute. Shakira's vocal range spans from E3 to B4. The song contains instrumentation from the bandoneón, which is played at a [...] "breakneck speed," [...] and also features a [...] "twanging" [...] guitar solo. Lyrically, [...] "Objection (Tango)" [...] is dramatic and humorous in approach and focuses on an angered Shakira ordering her love interest to choose between her and his other leading lady; it was said to be a feminist anthem and a [...] "hell-hath-no-fury it's-her-or-me steam train". It contains a line in which Shakira asserts to her lover that [...] "Next to her cheap silicon I look minimal/ That’s why in front <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>eyes</b> I'm invisible/ But you gotta know small things also count," [...] which a critic commented was a [...] "brave statement in these days of suspiciously ripe teenybop flesh peddlers." [...] During the bridge of the song, Shakira delivers rap-like vocals and instructs her lover to end the love triangle, declaring that [...] "Tango is not for three, was never meant to be." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} most songs in Laundry Service {{are based on}} issues and themes related to love, {{as they had been}} written after Shakira began a {{relationship}} Antonio de la Rúa, the son of former Argentine president Fernando de la Rúa. [...] "Underneath Your Clothes" [...] is an [...] "ode" [...] to the positivity one gains when pursuing a relationship with a good person. Shakira shows an [...] "important side" [...] in [...] "The One", which is a song about how [...] "you love your guy so much that you’re actually going to learn to cook" [...] and contains lines like [...] "To buy more thongs and write more happy songs, it always takes a little help from someone." [...] In [...] "Rules", she aims to make her lover realise that he is [...] "condemned" [...] to her and lists [...] "all the things your new boy can do." [...] Songs like [...] "Objection (Tango)" [...] and [...] "Fool" [...] also deal with issues related to love but in a different manner. The former is dramatic and humorous in approach as Shakira commands her partner to end a love triangle and choose between her and the other lady; it was described as a [...] "hell-hath-no-fury it's-her-or-me steam train." [...] In the song, Shakira asserts that [...] "Next to her cheap silicon I look minimal/That's why in front <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>eyes</b> I'm invisible", which a reviewer commented was a [...] "brave statement in these days of suspiciously ripe teenybop flesh peddlers [...]" [...] "Fool" [...] discusses how Shakira continues to try to build up a relationship with a [...] "shitty, self-absorbed man" [...] even after suffering a [...] "soul-crushing defeat." ...|$|E

2500|$|Duffy wrote a 46 line poem Rings for the 2011 {{wedding of}} Prince William and Catherine Middleton. The poem celebrates the rings {{found in nature}} and does not {{specifically}} mention the couple's names. It begins for both to say and continues [...] "I might have raised your hand to the sky / {{to give you the}} ring surrounding the moon / or looked to twin the rings <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>eyes</b> / with mine / or added a ring to the rings of a tree / by forming a handheld circle with you, thee, / ...". She wrote the verse with Stephen Raw, a textual artist, and a signed print of the work was sent to the couple as a wedding gift. Duffy also wrote the poem The Throne, which she composed for the 60th anniversary of Queen Elizabeth II's coronation.|$|E

[...] Ali immediately retorted, [...] "While fat Arabs rest in soft beds, the Iranians work hard on the hottest days to please God with their efforts. And what do these Arabs want from me? To ostracize the Iranians and become an oppressor! I swear by the God that splits the nucleus and creates Man, I heard the prophet once say, just as you strike the Iranians with your swords in the name of Islam, so will the Iranians one day strike you back the same way for Islam." ...|$|E
