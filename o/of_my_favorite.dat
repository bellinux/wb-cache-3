I have worked very hard on this video, this song is special to me and I had an idea for the video based on some <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>favorite</b> male groups. I remember seeing videos from New Edition, The Jackson 5 and the Temptations, bands I love for their beautiful harmonies, and precise choreography and I always {{wanted to make a}} video and be part of a boy group myself. It was so much fun. I put my heart and soul into 'Love On Top' and I hope you love it.|$|E

500|$|I {{would say}} it was a directorial {{collaborative}} effort. We went to the rainforest and that was interesting. Part of the reason was [...] I love Puerto Rico one <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>favorite</b> places ever and I did one <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>favorite</b> videos, 'Honey', in Puerto Rico at the El Conquistador hotel. I was involved every step of the way... I like a lot of the shots in the video... There was a moment where I had to do an additional water sequence with no director, just myself and a camera man with an underwater camera. I was looking at the take at 5 in the morning, [...] ready to kill me. But if we didn't have those shots there wouldn't be anything to cut away to, except me.|$|E

[...] He continues [...] "What makes these drawings (and the book itself) even more interesting is that Cott (1900-1987) was not just a zoologist—he was a highly skilled scientific illustrator (these are his own pen-and-ink drawings), a wildlife photographer, and a prominent British camoufleur in World War II." [...] Still in 2011, Behrens can write of Cott's way of thinking, citing his words as models of clear and accurate explanation of the mechanisms of camouflage: [...] "As he so aptly explained it, disruptive patterns work 'by the optical destruction of what is present', while continuous patterns work 'by the optical construction of what is not present.'" ...|$|E

500|$|People {{have been}} wanting me to release {{something}} specifically for country radio for years, but I didn't {{want to just}} release something that has a steel guitar on it [...] I wanted to release something I'm proud of, and we finally found that song.

[...] He began singing along and tried to emulate the records he heard: [...] "I always liked Nat King Cole. I {{always wanted to go}} my own way, but I always favored other singers like Dinah Washington, Sarah Vaughan, Ella Fitzgerald - I loved Ella Fitzgerald. There are so many of them. Nina Simone was one <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>favorites</b> - Johnny Mathis, They all had a style, a silkiness about them.... I wanted to sing silky, like butter - mellow.
