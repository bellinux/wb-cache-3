5|$|The recruits' {{indoctrination}} {{period at}} Palm Beach was six weeks. It covered instruction on subjects such as: activities, organization, personnel, current events, and social hygiene. The physical education aspects consisted of: body mechanics, swimming, games, and drill. Another {{important part of}} recruit training was the testing, classification, and selection process. This was designed {{to make the most}} of the recruit's abilities, background and interests. The results <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> were usually the basis for general assignments or the opportunity for specialized training.|$|E
5|$|A key {{development}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> {{program was}} a miss-distance indicator system, which independently measured {{the distance between the}} Zeus and the target at the instant the computers initiated the detonation of the warhead. There were concerns that if the Zeus' own radars were used for this ranging measure, any systematic error in ranging would also be present in the test data, and thus would be hidden. The solution was the use of a separate UHF-frequency transmitter in the warhead reentry vehicle, and a receiver in the Zeus. The received signal was retransmitted to the ground, where its Doppler shift was examined to extract the range information. These instruments eventually demonstrated that the Zeus' own tracking information was accurate. For visual tracking, a small conventional warhead was used, which provided a flash that could be seen on long exposure photographs of the interceptions.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose the model which substantiates {{diagnostics}} decision making based on <b>the</b> analysis <b>of</b> Receiver Operating Characteristic curves (ROC-curves) and predicts optimal values of diagnostic indicators of biomedical information. To assess <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> result prediction <b>the</b> standard criteria <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sensitivity and specificity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> model were used. Values of these criteria were calculated for the cases when <b>the</b> sensitivity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> was greater than specificity by several times, when <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> correct diagnoses was maximal, when <b>the</b> sensitivity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> was equal to its specificity and <b>the</b> sensitivity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> was several times greater than <b>the</b> specificity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>test.</b> To assess <b>the</b> significance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> factor characteristics and to compare <b>the</b> prognostic characteristics <b>of</b> models we used mathematical modeling and plotting the ROC-curves. <b>The</b> optimal value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> diagnostic indicator {{was found to be}} achieved when <b>the</b> sensitivity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> is equal to its specificity.

25|$|It is {{also thought}} that the test's {{reliability}} can depend substantially on details <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> procedure, such as where the tester and subject are seated, any introductory words, verbal and nonverbal responses to subjects' questions or comments, and how responses are recorded. Exner has published detailed instructions, but Wood et al. cites many court cases where these had not been followed. Similarly, the procedures for coding responses are fairly well specified but extremely time-consuming leaving them very subject to the author's style and the publisher {{to the quality of}} the instructions (such as was noted with one of Bohm's textbooks in the 1950s) as well as clinic workers (which would include examiners) being encouraged to cut corners.|$|E
25|$|Suitable {{missiles}} {{from the}} development program and production line {{were converted to}} supersonic target drones as the KD2U-1, later redesignated as the MQM-15A and GQM-15A. These targets were used for training of BOMARC surface-to-air missile crews firing from Santa Rosa Island, Florida, and controlled by the Montgomery Air Defense Sector, Gunter Air Force Base, Montgomery, Alabama. The KD2U-1 targets were launched from the Eglin Gulf Test Range base near Ft. Walton Beach, Florida. Drone flights at Eglin commenced on 3 September 1959, making 46 flights with 13 missiles. After the BOMARC tests the remaining missiles were moved to Naval Station Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico by 30 September 1961, where flights were begun to test Tartar, Terrier, and Talos surface-to-air missiles. Upon completion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> in Puerto Rico in 1963, the Regulus II drones were moved to NAS Point Mugu, California, where they remained in use until December 1965.|$|E
25|$|It {{emerged during}} the {{cross-examination}} of Fung and the other laboratory scientists that the police scientist Andrea Mazzola (who collected blood samples from Simpson to compare with evidence from the crime scene) was a trainee who carried the vial of Simpson's blood around in her lab coat pocket for nearly a day before handing it over as an exhibit. While two errors {{had been found in}} the history of DNA testing at Cellmark, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> laboratories, in 1988 and 1989, the errors were found during quality control tests and had not occurred since. One of the companies hired for DNA consulting by Simpson's defense had made the same error as found in 1988. What should have been the prosecution's strong point became their weak link, amid defense accusations that police technicians handled the blood samples with such a degree of incompetence as to render the delivery of accurate and reliable DNA results almost impossible. The prosecution argued that they had made the DNA evidence available to the defense for its own testing, and if the defense attorneys disagreed with the prosecution's tests, they could have conducted their own testing on the same samples. The defense had chosen not to accept the prosecution's offer.|$|E

25|$|In early 1970, enemy action {{declined}} so {{much that}} more mission were directed to border areas with more interdiction targets. The gunships conducted nighttime armed reconnaissance in specific strike zones known as Shadow boxes, flying a TACAN radial to a location in the box, then dropping position markers and locating targets. Between 1 April and 22 May, the 17 SOS provided nighttime cover for the besieged CIDG camps at Dak Seang and Dak Pek. With the assistance of AC-119K Stingers from the 18th Special Operations Squadron, the Shadows flew one to two sorties a night. During the siege of the camps, the squadrons flew 147 sorties and expended 2,380,161 7.62mm rounds and 21,796 20mm rounds. They also illuminated drop zones for C-7A Caribous resupplying the camps. From 3 April to 31 May, the AC-119Gs based at Tan Son Nhut tested a portable UHF receiver for signals transmitted by ground sensors. On 18 April, Shadow 77 picked up signals in a sensor field, firing nearly 6,000 7.62mm rounds that night and 28,500 rounds on the next night after again detecting movement, as well as assisting an airstrike in the area. 150 enemy bodies were discovered and 17 prisoners captured along with nine crew-served weapons and 67 individual weapons in a subsequent ground sweep. After the conclusion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> period, the final assessment recommended that the receivers be permanently placed in the AC-119.|$|E
25|$|A French {{scientist}} {{notable for}} his anti-GM perspective, Gilles-Eric Seralini, {{raised concerns about}} some of the differences between feeding trials using the genetically modified and unmodified brinjal, and criticized some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> protocols. The EC-II responded to the concerns raised by Seralini and other scientists in their report, New Zealand epidemiologist Lou Gallagher also criticised the feeding trials saying that the raw data indicated toxic effects were associated with the rats fed Bt Brinjal. Concerns have also been raised about a possible conflict of interest, with some of the scientists appointed to the GEAC being involved in developing their own GM products, that the decision by the EC-II was not unanimous, and about the reliability of safety data originating from Mahcyo run trials. The imposed moratorium has been criticized by some scientists as not being based on any compelling scientific evidence and potentially setting Indian biotechnology back decades. Others feel the critical issue is not the safety of the GM technology, but its corporatization and there are claims that India’s crop protection industry was a major player in preventing the commercialization of the Bt brinjal. India's National Biodiversity Authority is probing the crop scientists involved in developing the Bt brinjal for allegedly violating India's Biological Diversity Act, 2002 by using local cultivars and foreign technology without their permission.|$|E
