40|$|Mild {{traumatic}} brain injury (mTBI) is a common and often inconspicuous wound that is frequently associated with chronic low-grade symptoms and cognitive dysfunction. Previous evidence suggests that daily blue wavelength light therapy may be effective at reducing fatigue and improving sleep in patients recovering from mTBI. However, the effects of light therapy on recovering brain structure remain unexplored. In this study, we analyzed white matter diffusion properties, including generalized fractional anisotropy, and the quantity of water diffusion in isotropic (i. e., isotropic diffusion) and anisotropic fashion (i. e., quantitative anisotropy, QA) for fibers crossing 11 brain areas known to be significantly affected following mTBI. Specifically, we investigated how 6 [*]weeks <b>of</b> daily <b>morning</b> <b>blue</b> light exposure therapy (compared to an amber-light placebo condition) impacted changes in white matter diffusion in individuals with mTBI. We observed a significant impact of the blue light treatment (relative to the placebo) {{on the amount of}} water diffusion (QA) for multiple brain areas, including the corpus callosum, anterior corona radiata, and thalamus. Moreover, many of these changes were associated with improvements in sleep latency and delayed memory. These findings suggest that blue wavelength light exposure may serve as one of the potential non-pharmacological treatments for facilitating structural and functional recovery following mTBI; they also support the use of QA as a reliable neuro-biomarker for mTBI therapies...|$|R

My lines in space are made of common substances used in new ways to create illusions of scenes resurrected from memories. How did my sculptures come about? I have worked with grids in drawing and painting. My early pencil and ink drawn squares on canvas were partially erased and some lines strengthened until a ???push-pull??? relationship developed. One pencil work is in the Home Savings and Loan collection now. Later grids were made of plastic lines over flat, convex, or concave canvases so that line shadows were clear, became distorted or disappeared completely. Finally, being dissatisfied with the limitations of my work, I removed the backing and wove and tied the lines so that the work could be free to hang, drape and fold as its nature required and the shadows became strong participating images.

Out of his cave he saw the exquisitely fine foliage of the silver spruces crossing a round space <b>of</b> <b>blue</b> <b>morning</b> sky; and in this lacy leafage fluttered a number of gray birds with black and white stripes and long tails. They were mocking-birds, and they were singing as if they wanted to burst their throats. Venters listened. One long, silver-tipped branch dropped almost to his cave, and upon it, within a few yards of him, sat one of the graceful birds. Venters saw the swelling and quivering of its throat in song. He arose, and when he slid down out of his cave the birds fluttered and flew farther away.|$|R

40|$|Although morning {{stiffness}} {{has long}} been recognized as a characteristic feature of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), {{it is no more}} included in the 2010 ACR/EULAR Classification Criteria or in the current major instruments for evaluating disease activity of RA. In this cross-sectional study, we aimed to determine the independent value and the optimal measurement <b>of</b> <b>morning</b> stiffness by clarifying the associations between morning stiffness and synovial inflammation. We enrolled 76 consecutive RA patients who underwent musculoskeletal ultrasound examination and {{agreed to participate in the}} study. In addition to asking the duration <b>of</b> <b>morning</b> stiffness, we asked patients to complete a diagram which represents the time course <b>of</b> their <b>morning</b> stiffness in the dominant hand. Based on this diagram, we calculated the severity and the diurnal improvement <b>of</b> <b>morning</b> stiffness. We also determined the activity of intra-articular synovitis in 11 joints and tenosynovitis in 8 tendons/tendon compartments in the same hand by using power Doppler (PD) ultrasound with a semiquantitative score (0 - 3). For intra-articular synovitis, swollen/tender joint counts more strongly correlated with total PD scores (ρ = 0. 379 - 0. 561, p ≤ 0. 001) than did any parameters <b>of</b> <b>morning</b> stiffness (ρ = 0. 217 - 0. 314, p = 0. 006 - 0. 021). For tenosynovitis, however, the severity on awakening and the improvement <b>of</b> <b>morning</b> stiffness more strongly correlated with total PD scores (ρ = 0. 503 - 0. 561, p < 0. 001) than did swollen/tender joint counts (ρ = 0. 276 - 0. 388, p = 0. 001 - 0. 016). Multivariate analyses identified the severity on awakening and the improvement but not the duration <b>of</b> <b>morning</b> stiffness as factors that independently associate with the total tenosynovial PD score.

40|$|Introduction: Morning {{report is}} an {{important}} teaching method for interns and externs. Achieving the objectives <b>of</b> <b>morning</b> report affects future performance. This descriptive cross-sectional {{study was conducted to}} analyze the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>morning</b> reports. Methods:Viewpoints <b>of</b> 85 interns and externs at the cardiology wards of teaching hospitals of Mashhad University of Medical Sciences in the academic year of 2012 - 2013 were investigated. The instrument for data collection was a researcher-made questionnaire. Data were analyzed by chisquare and independent t-test. Effectiveness was defined as the rate of the achievement of the goals <b>of</b> <b>morning</b> reports based on dividing the total score of the questionnaire (54 scores) into three parts of 0 - 17 (poor effectiveness), 18 - 36 (moderate effectiveness) and 37 - 54 (good effectiveness). Results: The effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>morning</b> report sessions without the presence of residents was reported as moderate in hospital A, and the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>morning</b> report sessions with the presence of residents in hospital B was reported as moderate in the opinion of interns and poor in the view of externs. There {{was no significant difference between}} the viewpoints of interns in hospitals A and B with regard to the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>morning</b> report sessions (p= 0. 169). Conclusion: Results indicate that the higher academic level of subjects discussed in morning reports with presence of residents caused a reduction in the participation rate of interns and externs, thereby decreasing their learning and satisfaction. However, without the presence of residents, the students’ feelings of fear and anxiety were reduced and their satisfaction was heightened...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Specific {{symptoms}} of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), including joint stiffness and functional disability, are most severe in the morning. 'Morning stiffness' {{has a negative}} impact on health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL); however, how HRQoL is correlated to morning stiffness duration is unknown. The objective {{of this study was to}} obtain population-based utility values associated with different durations <b>of</b> <b>morning</b> stiffness in RA. DESIGN AND METHODS: The time-trade-off (TTO) approach was used to elicit utility values for four different health states (HS), which differed in morning stiffness duration. One hundred and nine members of the UK general public rated each HS in individual face-to-face interviews with trained investigators. TTO scores were converted into utility values. Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores were obtained to validate TTO scores. RESULTS: On a scale of 0 (death) to 1 (full health), a mean utility value of 0. 45 ± 0. 29 was elicited for ∼ 3 [*]h <b>of</b> <b>morning</b> stiffness (anchor HS), 0. 50 ± 0. 28 for 2 - 3 [*]h <b>of</b> <b>morning</b> stiffness (HS 1), 0. 61 ± 0. 25 for 1 - 2 [*]h <b>of</b> <b>morning</b> stiffness (HS 2) and 0. 78 ± 0. 20 for < 1 [*]h <b>of</b> <b>morning</b> stiffness (HS 3). The difference between each HS was statistically significant (p< 0. 01). Mean VAS utility scores followed the same trend. Utility incrementally increased with each HS associated with a shorter duration <b>of</b> <b>morning</b> stiffness. Limitations <b>of</b> this research include potential bias from the TTO method due to the discounting effect of time, scale compatibility, and loss aversion. CONCLUSIONS: The UK population-based utility values show a reduction in morning stiffness duration in RA is associated with improved HRQoL. Despite the impact <b>of</b> <b>morning</b> stiffness on HRQoL, it is rarely evaluated and little is known as to how it is affected by current treatments. The results of this study can be applied in future cost-utility analyses of healthcare interventions which target an improvement in morning stiffness duration for RA patients...|$|R
