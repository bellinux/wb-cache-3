Kermit (performed by Jim Henson) teaches Grump (performed by Frank Oz and voiced by Jerry Juhl) about the concept of {{visualizing}} thoughts through drawings shown <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> <b>screen.</b> This sketch was reprised on June 4, 1967.|$|E

As digital graphic technology progressed, the physical scoreboards were superseded in 1988 by an electronic representation which could be displayed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> <b>screen</b> at the will of the programme's director.|$|E
25|$|The Sensor Bar is {{required}} when the Wii Remote is controlling up-down, left-right motion of a cursor or reticle <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> <b>screen</b> {{to point to}} menu options or objects such as enemies in first-person shooters. Because the Sensor Bar also allows the Wii Remote to calculate {{the distance between the}} Wii Remote and the Sensor Bar, the Wii Remote can also control slow forward-backward motion of an object in a 3-dimensional game. Rapid forward-backward motion, such as punching in a boxing game, is controlled by the acceleration sensors. Using these acceleration sensors (acting as tilt sensors), the Wii Remote can also control rotation of a cursor or other objects.|$|E

Throughout the song, Jackson sings in a quick-voice, which some music critics viewed as Jackson [...] "not singing" [...] but [...] "harrumphing". [...] It is a plea to the public to not believe everything in the tabloids; and the lyrics are about media bias and sensational journalism about Jackson and in general. This can be heard in lyrics such as, [...] "Just because you read it in the magazine or see it <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> <b>screen</b> don't make it factual".|$|E

Krusty then appears <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> <b>screen</b> in the loading room and remarks [...] "Well, that's our ride. Hey! What does THIS do?!". For the Orlando attraction, Krusty is sitting in a control room and pushes an emergency button on a control panel, causing the vehicle to vibrate, ending the ride. In the Hollywood version, Krusty is sitting in a control room and takes a picture of the guests (The on-ride photo is taken here for the Hollywood attraction). After the gullwing doors on the car lift up, guests exit the ride.|$|E
500|$|David Browne, of Entertainment Weekly, {{noted that}} [...] "Tabloid Junkie," [...] comes as [...] "close to {{transcendence}} as {{anywhere on the}} album" [...] and described the chorus, [...] "Just because you {{read it in the}} magazine or see it <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> <b>screen</b> don't make it factual" [...] as Jackson's [...] "grabbiest, most driven refrain in years." [...] Although Browne praised the song, he commented, [...] "The rest of the song, however, is mucked up with fake tabloid-TV snippets about his 'life,' and on the verses Jackson's delivery is so terse (he's not singing, he's harrumphing) that his lyrics are all but obliterated. Handed a golden opportunity, he throws it all away — but then, it wouldn't be the first time." [...] Deepika Reedy, of The Daily Collegian, described the [...] "rust in songs" [...] like [...] "Tabloid Junkie" [...] as having a [...] "raw aspect" [...] that Jackson [...] "hasn't approached since a near-miss with 'Billie Jean'." [...] Patrick Macdonald, of The Seattle Times, noted that [...] "Tabloid Junkie" [...] was a [...] "disingenuous attack on sensational news stories" [...] about Jackson, remarked that most of stories were [...] "planted" [...] by Jackson himself.|$|E

This leads him to believe that the world has become desensitized to the violent images they see <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> <b>screens</b> day after day: Kennedy's assassination in particular, and the images being screened from Vietnam.

50|$|Following Arlie's eviction, the houseguests {{competed in}} the next HOH {{competition}}, Pure 21. With the competition being true and false themed, {{it came down to}} Allison and Neda competing in the first tie-breaker of the season. Neda took a chance by guessing a lower number than Allison did and won the HoH. However, immediately following the competition, Neda was called in to the diary room where she was blindfolded and taken to the war room, where Allison, Scott and Nate had stayed and where Allison got her secret veto. As Neda waited in the war room, the other houseguests began to wonder where she was without knowing that Neda was watching them <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> <b>screens</b> in <b>the</b> war room. After watching her fellow houeseguests, Arisa appeared <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> <b>screens</b> and then told Neda that she had to nominate two people for eviction immediately, because it was an instant eviction. Neda immediately ruled out nominating Jon, Adel and Heather and then had to choose between Rachelle, Sabrina and Allison. After debating it for a few minutes, she decided on nominating Allison and Sabrina for eviction. Neda was then taken back into the house where she told everyone that it was an instant eviction, and that she was nominating Allison and Sabrina. Neda gave a short speech of why she was nominating Allison and Sabrina, and during her speech she made it clear to the house her target was Allison and that Allison could not be trusted. She later revealed she had no such evidence, but wanted to make it clear to the other houseguests what her intentions were. Minutes later, Allison was evicted from the house by a vote of 4-0, and became the second member of the jury.|$|R
