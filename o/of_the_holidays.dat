The whole affair was relatively conservative for Gaga and weirdly progressive for the Muppets". Muller wrote that the special was aired at an opportune moment for Gaga, since Artpop sales had dropped 82 percent in its second week and the show was hoped to woo back her audience. She called the opening performance of [...] "Venus" [...] one of its top moments. Mark Graham wrote for VH1 that Gaga had a lack of relatability at that point in her career: [...] "To her credit, [...] seems to have recognized this flaw in her brand strategy and has been working overtime of late to humanize herself ... who watches the cable premiere of Lady Gaga & The Muppets Holiday Spectacular ... will definitely gain a new appreciation for [...] ". Maricela Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly called Lady Gaga and the Muppets' Holiday Spectacular a [...] "cross-promotional commercial", enabling Gaga to promote Artpop and enhancing the Muppets' popularity. Gonzalez described it as [...] "equal parts warm, fuzzy, cynical, and depressed by consumerism overtaking the so-called 'holiday spirit'. But why fret? It’s Lady Gaga and the Muppets!" ...|$|E

In an interview with Billboard, RCA marketing executive Aaron Borns remarked that the album was their main release <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>holidays,</b> quoting: [...] "The angle on this album is that, like all great Christmas records, it's about amazing vocal performances. That's what this is intended to be - an album launched this year but timeless and genre-defying." [...] In preparation for its release in the United States, RCA shipped a half-million units on Amazon.com and Target, which exclusively released a deluxe edition. A red LP pressing of Wrapped in Red by United Record Pressing followed the CD release on November 25, 2013, marking the first time an album by Clarkson was released on a vinyl record. A deluxe LP and CD edition was also released on the Sony Music store, which included a scarf, a holiday ornament and a snow globe, all of which were decorated in red as inspired from the album. An international promotion campaign was also planned for Clarkson, but was later halted due to her pregnancy. On October 21, 2014, Wrapped in Red was reissued by RCA with a special edition CD+DVD release exclusive to Walmart stores in the United States. A green LP pressing of the album would also be issued with a limited 500-copy release on December 9, 2014.|$|E
