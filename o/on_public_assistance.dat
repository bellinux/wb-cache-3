Black workers were especially vulnerable to the economic downturn since most of them worked the most marginal jobs such as unskilled or service-oriented work.

40|$|Abstract: Under {{the more}} {{decentralized}} welfare system, states {{will now have}} greater responsibility for decisions regarding eligibility, benefit levels, and program rules. This has renewed interest in how interarea differences in welfare programs influence migration of the poor. While scholars and policy-makers have studied the relationship between welfare benefit differentials and migration extensively, they have not considered how interarea variations in eligibility criteria and other program rules might affect migration of the poor. This research uses a sample of large metropolitan areas to study the effect of eligibility criteria on migration of the poor. Will Interstate Differences in Restrictions <b>on</b> Receipt of <b>Public</b> <b>Assistance</b> Affect Migration of the Poor? Some Evidence from the Past The welfare reform bill of 1996 (i. e., the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996) is bringing about {{major changes in the}} welfare system. These changes, particularly the increased decision-making power of states, has renewed interest in the issue of how interarea differences in welfare benefits affect mobility of the poor. A different wrinkle to this old issue is how interarea differences in restrictions <b>on</b> receipt of <b>public</b> <b>assistance</b> influence migration of the poor. States have always differed tremendously with respect to the level of means-tested welfare benefit...|$|R

Labour councils sought to administer the means test in the most favourable terms possible, which involved accepting {{a higher percentage of}} applications for transitional benefit than in non-Labour localities and providing the maximum rate of relief available.

25|$|This {{change in}} {{demographics}} coincided {{with changes in}} the local economy.

As breweries in Bushwick closed, the neighborhood's economic base eroded. Discussions of urban renewal took place in the 1960s, but never materialized, resulting in the demolition of many residential buildings with the intent of replacing these structures with public housing, but nothing new was built in its place as these proposals were scrapped. Another contribution to the change in the socioeconomic profile of the neighborhood was the John Lindsay administration's policy of raising rent for welfare recipients. Since these tenants now brought higher rents than ordinary tenants would pay on the open market, Bushwick landlords actively began to fill vacant units with such tenants. By the mid-1970s, half of Bushwick's residents were <b>on</b> <b>public</b> <b>assistance.</b>|$|E

While it was apparent that SPAN had administrative problems within the organization, it was also clear that economic, political, and historical factors were contributive to SPAN's demise.

Just as it has offered an alternative to both the pure retributivist and rehabilitation models in the area of criminal corrections, the principles and practices of the restorative justice movement offer a better chance to re-shape the relationship between recipient and the community in work programs in a realistic way.

40|$|Recognizing that {{burdensome}} and discriminatory {{voter registration}} laws have a damaging impact on American democracy, Congress passed the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) in 1993 to make voter registration more accessible, {{with the hope}} of reducing disparities in voting among various populations. The NVRA remains one of the nation's most important voting rights laws. Although millions of citizens have taken advantage of voter registration opportunities created by the NVRA, key provisions of the law meant to reach populations with low voter registration rates have been poorly and inconsistently administered in many states. Specifically, states have failed to adequately implement [...] and the Department of Justice has in recent years failed in their duty to enforce [...] NVRA provisions that require states to offer voter registration in government agencies providing <b>public</b> <b>assistance</b> benefits. Unequal Access: Neglecting the National Voter Registration Act, 1995 - 2007 details the following: The number of voter registration applications from <b>public</b> <b>assistance</b> agencies in 2005 - 2006 is a small fraction of what it was in 1995 - 1996, when the NVRA was first implemented (see Figure 1 and Tables 1 a and 1 b). Indeed, registrations from <b>public</b> <b>assistance</b> agencies declined by 79 percent during this time. The decline in registrations from <b>public</b> <b>assistance</b> agencies occurred despite the fact that millions of citizens from low-income households remain unregistered. In 2006, 13 million, or 40 percent of, voting-aged citizens from households earning under $ 25, 000 were unregistered. Many states frequently fail to report data <b>on</b> their <b>public</b> <b>assistance</b> agency registrations to the Elections Assistance Commission (EAC), as required for the EAC's biennial report to Congress. Recent surveys of clients at <b>public</b> <b>assistance</b> agency sites in more than half a dozen states have found numerous instances where voter registration was not being offered as required by the NVRA; voter registration applications were completely absent at some agency sites. States that have adopted improved NVRA procedures have seen dramatic increases in voter registrations at <b>public</b> <b>assistance</b> agencies, indicating the potential for substantial improvement in other states. The Department of Justice has taken little action in recent years to enforce the <b>public</b> <b>assistance</b> agency registration requirements of the NVRA, despite being repeatedly presented with strong evidence of states' noncompliance. Based on the outcomes in states where recent compliance efforts have been undertaken, states can improve their compliance with the NVRA and increase the number of low-income citizens registering to vote by implementing recommended procedures, outlined in this report, to improve training, monitoring and reporting by agencies. The NVRA is the only federal law requiring the government to affirmatively offer voter registration to broad segments of the population. Because of noncompliance with the NVRA, however, the rights of thousands of low-income citizens are violated daily across the nation. Project Vote and Demos call on state election and <b>public</b> <b>assistance</b> officials to take immediate action to properly implement this important civil rights law. We also call on the Department of Justice to fulfill its role by actively enforcing the NVRA's requirement for voter registration at <b>public</b> <b>assistance</b> agencies...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} use of an eight-week, parent-education program (LENA Start™) to {{increase}} the amount of child-directed speech, quantity of conversations, and parental knowledge of child development. For most young children, parents or caregivers primarily provide their language and literacy environment. However, all children do not receive the same early experiences due to differences in socioeconomic status or parent knowledge. Such differences can result in varied quantity and quality of linguistic input to the child, influencing later academic achievement. Therefore, interventions to combat the achievement gap between children of low and high socioeconomic status families are used and researched. To that end, 46 parents of infants and toddlers, about half of whom identified receiving <b>public</b> <b>assistance,</b> completed the LENA Start™ program and were assessed for growth in linguistic behaviors and child development knowledge. Participants received tips and practice to increase the number of words spoken to and the number of conversations engaged in with their child, paired with information about child language and brain development. Each week, participants recorded the number of words spoken to and number of conversational turns taken with their child by use of the LENA Digital Language Processor, receiving quantitative linguistic feedback. Participants completed pre and post SPEAK surveys, a test of parent child development knowledge, as well as the LENA Snapshot, a self-report questionnaire of child language ability. Findings revealed growth in word count and conversational turns, as well as growth in the overall knowledge of child development. No differences were found in growth or number of words and conversational turns based <b>on</b> participant <b>public</b> <b>assistance</b> status, although participants who received <b>public</b> <b>assistance</b> scored significantly lower on child development knowledge.
