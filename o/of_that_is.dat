5|$|The Indiana World War Memorial Plaza is {{an urban}} feature located in Indianapolis, Indiana, United States, {{originally}} built {{to honor the}} veterans of World War I. The five-city-block plaza was conceived in 1919 {{as a location for}} the national headquarters of the American Legion and a memorial to the state's and nation's veterans. At {{the north end of the}} plaza is the American Legion Mall, which is the site of the administration buildings of the Legion, as well as a memorial cenotaph.

The parties appearing before the Tribunal are {{not confined to the}} President and the Attorney-General. The Tribunal may direct that the hearing of a reference be notified to any interested person or, where there is an interested class of persons, to one or more representatives of the class. If there is any interest that is affected which is not represented by counsel, the Tribunal may request that counsel argue the case for this interest.|$|E

25|$|Tactically, {{the guerrilla}} army would avoid any {{confrontation}} with large units of enemy troops, but seek and eliminate {{small groups of}} soldiers to minimize losses and exhaust the opposing force. Not limiting their targets to personnel, enemy resources are also preferred targets.

25|$|Today, only 51% of the Deerwood {{residents}} {{are members of}} the Country Club. Part <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> financial; the equity initiation fee was $21,000 in 2005, with monthly dues of $349 for a golf membership. However, there are about 100 non-residents who are Deerwood Country Club members. When the Deerwood Board of Governors made the decision to build a new clubhouse and renovate the golf course at a cost estimated at $9.5 million, all Equity members were assessed a fee to pay for it. Membership dropped from 700 in 2000 to approximately 500 in January 2004, when the project began. Approximately 25% of the members did not pay it, leaving the club with a $6M debt.|$|E

25|$|The baptistery is {{the oldest}} part of the cathedral, dating to the 5th century. It is similar in form to baptisteries in Northern Italy, at Albenga in Liguria, and to the Lateran Baptistery in Rome, from the same period. On the exterior, the lower part is a square, about eleven meters to a side. On top <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> a domed {{octagonal}} structure. In the interior, the lower level is divided into eight deep arched niches, alternating between semicircular niches and those with flat walls, with the arches resting on columns. The columns support the upper level, which has sixteen small arched niches with windows, which in turn support the dome. Many of the granite columns predate the church, and were probably taken from Roman temples; other columns were made {{at the same time}} as the baptistery.|$|E
25|$|The {{best thing}} {{was simply the}} {{privilege}} {{and the challenge of}} being able to take a shot at the first female captain, transcending stereotypes that I was very familiar with. I was able to do that in front of millions of viewers. That was a remarkable experience—and it continues to resonate. The downside <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> also that it continues to resonate, and threatens to eclipse all else in one's long career if one does not up the ante and stay at it, in a way that may not ordinarily be necessary. I have to work at changing and constantly reinventing myself in a way that probably would not have happened had Star Trek not come along. I knew that going in, and I think that all of the perks attached to this journey have been really inexpressively great. So the negatives are small.|$|E
25|$|The old {{boundary}} between Brighton and Hove is most clearly {{seen on the}} seafront, where the King Edward Peace Statue (1912) straddles the border, and in a twitten called Boundary Passage which runs northwards from Western Road to Montpelier Road. There is a Grade II-listed parish boundary marker stone in this passageway. Between Western Road and the seafront, the boundary runs up Little Western Street (pavement on eastern side, in Brighton), {{but it is not}} visible. Northwards from Western Road, it runs to the west of Norfolk Road, Norfolk Terrace, Windlesham Road and Windlesham Gardens in the Montpelier area, then along the south side of Davigdor Road to Seven Dials. From there it runs along the west side of Dyke Road as far as Withdean Road in Withdean, at which point it crosses Dyke Road so that the section north <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> part of Hove parish. The boundary continues to follow Dyke Road towards Devil's Dyke on the South Downs.|$|E

25|$|Air dry stem yields in Ontario {{have from}} 1998 and onward ranged from 2.6-14.0 tonnes of dry, retted stalks per hectare (1-5.5 t/ac) at 12% moisture. Yields in Kent County, have {{averaged}} 8.75 t/ha (3.5 t/ac). Northern Ontario crops averaged 6.1 t/ha (2.5 t/ac) in 1998. Statistic for the European Union for 2008 to 2010 {{say that the}} average yield of hemp straw has varied between 6.3 and 7.3 ton per ha. Only a part <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> bast fiber. Approximately one tonne of bast fiber and 2-3 tonnes of core material can be decorticated from 3-4 tonnes of good quality, dry retted straw. For an annual yield of this level is it in Ontario recommended to add nitrogen (N):70–110kg/ha, phosphate (P2O5): up to 80kg/ha and potash (K2O): 40–90kg/ha.|$|E
25|$|Another {{example is}} the Agen Warehouse, also known as Olympic Cold Storage Warehouse, {{at the corner of}} Western Avenue and Seneca Street near the {{downtown}} piers. Designed by architect John Graham and built in 1910, it is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It originally housed John Agen's Alaska Butter and Cream Company, which moved from Pier 6 (now Pier 57). Immediately north <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> another Graham building, built in 1918 as a warehouse for the Pacific Net and Twine Company. That company merged with the Marine Supply Company to form the Pacific Marine Supply Company, which continued to use the warehouse in conjunction with its operations on the old Pier 1 at the foot of Yesler Way. More recently, the building has been associated with genetic engineering company Immunex.|$|E
25|$|It {{seems that}} {{on the level of}} the organ, the leaf may be the {{ancestor}} of the flower, or at least some floral organs. When we mutate some crucial genes involved in flower development, we end up with a cluster of leaf-like structures. Thus, sometime in history, the developmental program leading to formation of a leaf must have been altered to generate a flower. There probably also exists an overall robust framework within which the floral diversity has been generated. An example <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> a gene called LEAFY (LFY), which is involved in flower development in Arabidopsis thaliana. The homologs of this gene are found in angiosperms as diverse as tomato, snapdragon, pea, maize and even gymnosperms. Expression of Arabidopsis thaliana LFY in distant plants like poplar and citrus also results in flower-production in these plants. The LFY gene regulates the expression of some gene belonging to the MADS-box family. These genes, in turn, act as direct controllers of flower development.|$|E
30|$|Dynamic {{prediction}} length. It {{is necessary}} to determine {{the length of the}} predicted D-trajectory. The dynamic trajectory length is used by the P-DPA algorithm to determine the number <b>of</b> destinations <b>that</b> <b>are</b> most likely to be visited by a targeted individual on a specific day. The dynamic length will be determined by finding the number <b>of</b> destinations <b>that</b> <b>were</b> visited by an individual on the majority <b>of</b> days <b>that</b> <b>are</b> similar to the day of his/her current activity. For example, if the current activity of individual(x) is occurring on Sunday and the number <b>of</b> destinations <b>that</b> <b>are</b> often visited by individual(x) on all previous Sundays is 7, then the length of the predicted D-trajectory by P-DPA is seven destinations.|$|R
30|$|Reciprocity. Reciprocity is the {{fraction}} <b>of</b> edges <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>of</b> cycle of length two. Note <b>that</b> reciprocity <b>is</b> {{related to the}} flow hierarchy because {{the fraction}}, θ, <b>of</b> edges <b>that</b> <b>are</b> in cycles <b>of</b> length greater than two can be computed as θ= 1 -ζ-α.|$|R
