40|$|ObjectivesTo study {{incidence}} and severity <b>of</b> <b>steal</b> phenomena in hemodialysis patients and to investigate possible methods for its detection. MethodsA questionnaire was composed {{based on a}} literature search. A subgroup <b>of</b> patients having <b>steal</b> as identified by the questionnaire was studied using physical examination, arterial blood pressure, skin temperature, digital oxygenation, grip strength and plethysmography. Contralateral arms served as controls. ResultsA cold hand was present in 50 % of the patients with a brachiocephalic (BC) arteriovenous fistula (AVF, n= 28) compared to 25 % of prosthetic forearm loops (loop, n= 27) and 12 % of the radiocephalic (RC, n= 65, p< 0. 05) fistulas. Diabetics were at risk for steal (p< 0. 001). Intensity <b>of</b> <b>steal</b> {{was not related to}} magnitude of access flow. Digital skin temperatures and grip strength were lower in steal hands (p< 0. 02). Manual compression of the AVF normalised low digital pressures in steal hands (106 ± 33 vs 154 ± 25 mmHg, p< 0. 001, contralateral side 155 ± 21 mmHg). ConclusionsMild to moderate steal symptoms are common in a hemodialysis patient. Individuals with a BC are at a higher risk for developing complaints associated with reduced hand circulation compared to patients with a RC or loop. Low finger pressures in the presence <b>of</b> <b>steal</b> symptoms are usually reversible...|$|R
40|$|Blumofe and Leiserson [6] {{gave the}} first provably good work-stealing work {{scheduler}} for mul-tithreaded computations with dependencies.

This thesis extends the existing literature in two directions. Firstly, we analyze the number <b>of</b> successful <b>steals</b> in multithreaded computations. The existing literature has dealt with the number <b>of</b> <b>steal</b> attempts without distinguishing between successful and unsuccessful steals. While that approach leads to a fruitful probabilistic analysis, it does not yield an interesting result for a worst-case analysis.

5|$|Over time, the {{characterisation}} of Shashthi {{underwent a}} gradual evolution.

For this reason, the text recommends that she be propitiated through worship in her honour on this day in the lying-in room and on the sixth day of every fortnight thereafter.|$|E

40|$|Introduction. Dialysis {{associated}} {{steal syndrome}} (DASS) constitutes a serious risk for patients undergoing vascular access operations. We aim {{to assess the}} measured volume flow using ultrasound in patients with clinically suspected steal syndrome and determine differences in flow among types of arteriovenous (AV) access. Methods. Patients with permanent hemodialysis access with and without ischemic steal underwent duplex ultrasound (US) exams {{for the assessment of}} volume flow and quantitative evidence <b>of</b> hemodynamic <b>steal.</b> Volume flow was measured in the proximal feeding artery. Results. 118 patients underwent US of which 82 (69. 5 %) had clinical evidence <b>of</b> <b>steal.</b> Women were more likely to develop steal compared to men (chi-squared test). Mean volume flow in patients with steal was 1542 [*]mL/min compared to 1087 [*]mL/min () in patients without evidence <b>of</b> <b>steal.</b> A significant difference in flow volumes in patients with and without steal was only seen in patients with a brachial-cephalic upper arm AV fistula (AVF) (). When comparing different types <b>of</b> access with <b>steal,</b> brachial-cephalic upper arm AVFs had higher volume flows than the upper extremity AV graft (AVG) group (). Conclusion. In patients with DASS, women were more likely to develop steal syndrome. Significantly higher volume flows were seen with brachial-cephalic upper arm AVF in patients with steal compared to those without. A physiologic basis of this US finding may be present, which warrants further study into the dynamics of flow and its relationship to the underlying peripheral arterial pathology in the development <b>of</b> ischemic <b>steal...</b>|$|R
5|$|Practicing correct sexual {{practices}} was one method of perfecting the body's internal spirits. The Celestial Masters believed that semen is {{the embodiment of}} qi. If someone ejaculated too often, their life would be shortened. In fact, the Xiang'er indicates that people should not even have sex {{for the purposes of}} reproduction. The Celestial Masters frowned upon the practice of heqi (also known as 'The Union of the Breaths') of not ejaculating during sex in order to 'nourish the brain', and advocated non-ejaculation simply as a way to avoid losing qi. In addition, the Celestial Masters thought that the method <b>of</b> <b>stealing</b> a woman's qi to replenish the man's own qi was completely wrong, and should not be practiced. Despite their opposition to 'heqi' and reproductive sex, there is the possibility that the Celestial Masters supported sex for purposes other than reproduction, and a Celestial Master text from around the 5th century describes an elaborate sexual ritual.See Kalinowski(1985) for a full description of the ritual.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} prison cells {{are found in}} the Castellania. The cells close to the court rooms hosted new cases and also those {{awaiting}} execution. Several other cells are located {{at the rear of the}} building, and they are surrounded by a courtyard. These cells generally housed inmates who had to serve a short sentence of less than eight days, usually due to unpaid rent or accumulated debts. Other convicts were those who refused to bake bread in Valletta which were jailed for a roughly a week and those found guilty <b>of</b> <b>stealing</b> to eat which were imprisoned up to three months. In some cases, individuals were imprisoned for not observing religious norms, such as eating meat on prohibited days. Prisoners with longer sentences were usually sent to other prisons, usually the Gran Prigione, and if in physical capability were subject to be sent to the galleys. Medical physicians were requested to visit the inmates in the prison when needed for multiple reasons related to their health and examinations. There were attempts to re-criminalize gambling during the late magistracy of Pinto as such activity led to undesirable financial consequences to participants but the widespread practice was instead strictly regulated, on fears that if banned it may be of benefit to the underground community.|$|E
5|$|Although the Igor Gouzenko and Elizabeth Bentley affairs {{had raised}} the issue of Soviet espionage as far back as 1945, events in 1949 and 1950 sharply {{increased}} the sense of threat from Communism in the United States. The Soviet Union tested an atomic bomb in 1949, earlier than many analysts had expected. That same year, Mao Zedong's Communist army gained control of mainland China despite heavy American financial support of the opposing Kuomintang. In 1950, the Korean War began, pitting U.S., U.N., and South Korean forces against Communists from North Korea and China. The following year also saw several significant developments regarding Soviet Cold War espionage activities. In January 1950, Alger Hiss, a high-level State Department official, was convicted of perjury. Hiss was in effect found guilty of espionage; the statute of limitations had run out for that crime, but he was convicted of having perjured himself when he denied that charge in earlier testimony before the House Un-American Activities Committee. In Great Britain, Klaus Fuchs confessed to committing espionage on behalf of the Soviet Union while working on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos National Laboratory during the War. Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were arrested in 1950 on charges <b>of</b> <b>stealing</b> atomic bomb secrets for the Soviets and were executed in 1953.|$|E
