25|$|In 1954, Manly Wade Wellman {{enhanced}} Craven's {{story with}} his book titled Dead and Gone. The story {{is based on}} the death of Naomi Wise and the arrest of Jonathan Lewis but all else is fiction. No <b>one</b> <b>really</b> knows who killed Naomi.|$|E

25|$|Galileo Galilei lampooned {{the misuse}} of Occam's razor in his Dialogue. The {{principle}} is represented in the dialogue by Simplicio. The telling point that Galileo presented ironically was that if <b>one</b> <b>really</b> wanted to start from {{a small number of}} entities, one could always consider the letters of the alphabet as the fundamental entities, since one could construct the whole of human knowledge out of them.|$|E
25|$|Fitzy Fitzgerald (Cavan Cunningham) is {{the mayor}} of Dog River. He tends to take his {{position}} very seriously. He is quite paranoid about losing his job and thinks that anyone will do anything for the position of mayor, although no <b>one</b> <b>really</b> wants it. Not a lot is revealed about his personal life; however, {{we do know that}} he has at least one child, and several episodes imply that he may have a son.|$|E
25|$|On 21 May, {{when she}} arrived at Okinawa, the {{campaign}} had been in progress for almost two months, but the Japanese still hung on tenaciously. The members of the Kamikaze Corps continued to hurl themselves at the ships supporting the troops ashore. Watts {{proved to be a}} lucky ship while on radar picket station. Not only did her guns help to shoot down six aerial attackers, but she suffered only <b>one</b> <b>really</b> close call. A suicide plane almost managed to crash into her port side forward, but accurate 20-millimeter fire splashed him at the last possible instant, only 10 yards off the destroyer's port bow.|$|E

25|$|Iowa's {{defense was}} strong against Michigan State, as the Hawkeyes held the Spartans to just 249 yards of total offense. No <b>one</b> <b>really</b> stood out on offense, but the Hawkeyes once again got {{scores from the}} defense and the special teams. Immediately {{following}} a Spartan touchdown, Iowa's Jermelle Lewis returned the kick 94 yards for the touchdown. Later in the 1st quarter, Derek Pagel took an interception 62 yards for the touchdown. C.J. Jones scored twice on passes from Brad Banks as Iowa scored 44 consecutive points spanning the first three quarters. Iowa also held Michigan State's Charles Rogers from scoring a touchdown, ending Rogers' consecutive game streak with a touchdown reception at 14.|$|E
25|$|The divisional supply trains were {{withdrawn}} back to Karm, {{where water}} was readily available, because 30,000 {{animals in the}} Beersheba area needed water. Meanwhile, the horses of the 1st, 2nd Light Horse, 5th Mounted and New Zealand Mounted Rifle Brigades, fighting in the Tel el Khuweilfe area, had only <b>one</b> <b>really</b> good drink during the four days {{they were in the}} area, even though the 7th Mounted Brigade found enough water on the east of the line for their horses. The 8th Light Horse Regiment, having suffered three killed and 14 wounded on 3 November, retired with the 1st Light Horse Brigade back to Beersheba, where the regiment watered {{for the first time in}} 39 hours. The horses of the 1st Light Horse Brigade had, by then, been 30 hours without water.|$|E
25|$|Derbyshire was {{the most}} {{improved}} team of the year, rising ten places from fifteenth in 1946 to fifth in 1947. They were a strong bowling side with pacemen Bill Copson, Cliff Gladwin and George Pope all playing for England. Dusty Rhodes, bowling mainly leg break, and leftarmer Eric Marsh provided support. Derbyshire, captained {{for the first time}} by Edward Gothard, played attacking cricket and were involved in several close finishes. The batting was weakened by injuries to Stan Worthington, in his final season, and Denis Smith. Charlie Elliott and Arnold Townsend topped 1,000 runs but Playfair noted that the presence of <b>one</b> <b>really</b> top-class batsman would have made an enormous difference to Derbyshire's batting. John Eggar, who topped the county averages, might have filled that gap but his teaching career enabled him to play only in August. Smith was seconded to keep wicket for most of the season until George Dawkes, formerly of Leicestershire, was able to join the team. Dawkes went on {{to become one of the}} greatest English wicketkeepers. Another notable debutant was fast bowler Les Jackson. Other players included Albert Alderman, 55-year-old Harry Elliott in his final season, Alan Revill and Pat Vaulkhard.|$|E

500|$|The {{influential}} Swedish critic Wilhelm Peterson-Berger, {{always a}} thorn in Sibelius's side and whom the composer had once mocked as [...] "his lordship", required some three encounters with The Oceanides before warming to the new symphonic poem: after hearing the Stockholm Concert Society under Sibelius in 1923, Peterson-Berger at last embraced the piece. [...] "The Oceanides was totally and completely different from three years ago under Schnéevoigt", he wrote. [...] "In this beautiful poem <b>one</b> <b>really</b> heard something of {{the sound of the}} Aegean Sea and of Homer".|$|E

It also won Wells a Grammy nomination for Best Rhythm and Blues Recording.|$|R
500|$|Harrison's musical biographer, Simon Leng, {{considers}} {{it to be}} an [...] "emotionally complex lyric that ponders how love will even survive, 'when every soul is free'". Christian theologian Dale Allison interprets {{the subject matter of the}} song as moksha, or liberation from rebirth, in the Hindu faith. He writes: [...] "'I'll Still Love You (When Every Song Is Sung)' looks forward to the time when all souls are 'free,' when all eyes will 'see,' and when all human beings will be of the same mind. 'All Things Must Pass,' but no <b>one</b> <b>really</b> ever passes away." ...|$|E

It's not three multiple endings. One thing we're getting rid of is what I call the dorky comedy. [...] basically gone." [...] Due to fan rumors that the Twins would actually be in the film, the director made a public $25,000 [...] "bet" [...] that the Twins would not be seen in Dark of the Moon. However they were briefly seen in the N.E.S.T headquarters in their vehicle modes in the film.|$|E
500|$|The {{government}} decided {{to close a}} number of government libraries without consultation on the closings or the process involved. [...] The {{manner in which it}} was done received significant criticism because it has resulted in the remaining information being put into a disarray, rendering it inaccessible for research, and in a loss of information of a magnitude as of yet unknown. [...] This is because no significant effort was made to inventory the material, to determine what should be preserved, and no <b>one</b> <b>really</b> knows what was discarded. [...] Much material was simply given away, thrown away, or lost in process, very likely including valuable data and historical documents.|$|E

Shane Phoenix of Hot Spots gave a positive review of the song, stating that the lyrics are [...] "spot on" [...] and the [...] "winds are fabo, the keys and key breaks in this <b>one</b> <b>really</b> allow her vocal sense {{to come out and}} shine". He concluded by stating that: [...] "If you have been looking for a new love song, this could be your pick".|$|E
500|$|The English {{experience}} of witchcraft was somewhat {{different from the}} European one, with only <b>one</b> <b>really</b> mass witchhunt, that of Matthew Hopkins in East Anglia during 1645. That one incident {{accounted for more than}} 20% of the number of witches it is estimated were executed in England between the early 15th and mid-18th century, fewer than 500. The English legal system also differed significantly from the inquisitorial model used in Europe, requiring members of the public to accuse their neighbours of some crime, and for the case to be decided by a jury of their peers. English witch trials of the period [...] "revolved around popular beliefs, according to which the crime of witchcraft was one of... evil-doing", for which tangible evidence had to be provided.|$|E
