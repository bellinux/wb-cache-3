40|$|Background The limited {{evidence}} {{on the relationship between}} problem behaviours and symptoms of psychiatric disorders experienced by adults with intellectual disabilities leads to conflict about diagnostic criteria and confused treatment. This study examined the relationship between problem behaviours and other psychopathology, and compared the predictive validity of dimensional and categorical models experienced by adults with intellectual disabilities. Methods Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses appropriate for non-continuous data were used to derive, and validate, symptom dimensions using two clinical datasets (n = 457; n = 274). Categorical diagnoses were derived using DC-LD. Severity and 5 -year longitudinal outcome was measured using a battery of instruments. Results Five factors/dimensions were identified and confirmed. Problem behaviours were included in an emotion dysregulation-problem behaviour dimension that was distinct from the depressive, anxiety, <b>organic</b> and <b>psychosis</b> dimensions. The dimensional model had better predictive validity than categorical diagnosis. Conclusions International classification systems should not include problem behaviours as behavioural equivalents in diagnostic criteria for depression or other psychiatric disorders. Investigating the relevance of emotional regulation to psychopathology may provide an important pathway for development of improved interventions...|$|R
40|$|Various {{psychiatric}} symptoms/signs {{have been}} identified since the identification of Wilson’s disease (WD). Every patient with WD suffers from one or more psychiatric problems (<b>organic</b> dementia, <b>psychosis,</b> and impulsivity) across the disease course. Sometimes, insidious symptoms, such as behavioral changes, failure in school performance, and disturbances in hand-eye coordination may be seen {{before the onset of}} neurologic presentation. In this report, five patients, who were diagnosed with WD and followed up in the Child Neurology Unit, were assessed by a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders- 4 -based semistructured psychiatric interview (Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children). All patients had psychiatric symptoms. One patient had a history of a manic episode and the other had a history of a psychotic disorder at the initial stage of WD. Psychiatric symptoms coexist mostly with neurologic signs in patients with WD. In this sense, pediatric neurological consultation and copper screening are lifesaving in excluding organic etiology. However, WD is a lifelong treatment-requiring disease and psychiatric evaluation of the patients is essential...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Mania with {{psychotic}} features presenting following abrupt normalisation of thyroid function {{from severe}} Graves’s disease is reported.

Symptoms of mania and psychosis then developed. Treatment: Tme limited antipsychotic medication and continuing medical treatment. Outcome: There was resotution of psychiatric symptoms. Conclusions: The association of mania and psychosis with thyroid disease is rare, but aggressive medical treatment and rapid restoration of normal serum thyroid levels {{may increase the}} risk of the emergence of such symptoms.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Subcortical {{structures}} of the brain have been studied extensively to establish their implication {{in the development of}} psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia. Any pathology in these {{structures of}} the brain identified on neuroimaging techniques can give us helpful information in learning the neuropsychiatric background of psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia. Case presentation We report an interesting case of a 38 -year-old man with new onset psychosis who was found to have a lacunar infarct of the putamen region in the left basal ganglia on a computed tomography scan of his brain. Conclusion It is possible to hypothesize that the psychotic symptoms in our patient may be the direct result of the putamen infarct, as pathology in the basal ganglia {{at the level of the}} striatum can result in complex cognitive and behavioural symptoms. Understanding <b>organic</b> causes of <b>psychosis,</b> including cerebrovascular compromises leading to damage of structures in the basal ganglia, can provide important information about the causality of psychosis and ways to treat it. </p...|$|R
40|$|The psychosocial {{impact of}} {{disasters}} has attracted increasing attention. There is little consensus, however, about what priorities should be pursued {{in relation to}} mental health interventions, with most controversy surrounding the relevance of traumatic stress to mental health. The present overview suggests that acute traumatic stress may be a normative response to life threat which tends to subside once conditions of safety are established. At the same time, there is a residual minority of survivors who will continue to experience chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and their needs can be easily overlooked. The ADAPT model offers an expanded perspective on the psychosocial systems undermined by disasters, encompassing threats to safety and security; interpersonal bonds; systems of justice; roles and identities; and institutions that promote meaning and coherence. Social reconstruction programs that are effective in repairing these systems maximize the capacity of communities and individuals to recover spontaneously from various forms of stress. Within that broad recovery context, clinical mental health services can focus specifically on those psychologically disturbed persons who are at greatest survival risk. Only a minority of persons with acute traumatic stress fall into that category, the remainder comprising those with severe behavioural disturbances arising from <b>psychosis,</b> <b>organic</b> brain disorders, severe mood disorders and epilepsy. Establishing mental health services that are community-based, family-focused and culturally sensitive in the post-emergency phase can create a model that helps shape future mental health policy for countries recovering from disaster...|$|R
40|$|Violence is an {{important}} social problem. Violence in the community has important social relevance for the political, criminal justice, and health care systems. Studies of homicide offenders have suggested a high prevalence of neurologic dysfunction due to organic brain damage such as traumatic brain injury, epilepsy and dementia have been observed to exhibit excessive violence. Moreover, violence in the mentally ill {{can be viewed as}} {{an important}} medical and mental health problem with significant implications for forensic psychiatry and the community. Although numerous previous studies showed that rate of violent behavior in the community is not much higher in patients with serious mental disorders (schizophrenia) than in healthy controls, that rate is substantially higher in patients with psychiatric comorbidity and substance abuse. A high proportion of patients in forensic psychiatric facilities are diagnosed with comorbidity, most often with schizophrenia, paranoid <b>psychosis,</b> <b>organic</b> brain syndrome, various personality disorders and comorbid substance abuse. These patients represent a high risk group for violence within forensic psychiatric facilities, and repetitive violent behavior in the community. Understanding the neurobiological basis of aggressive behavior clearly has important social and clinical implications. By introduction of neuroimaging studies (MRI, fMRI, PET, SPECT) as a useful tool in forensic psychiatry, the neurobiological aspect of violence is better understood. Previous studies have shown that individuals with frontotemporal brain dysfunction are frequently displaying antisocial behavior (disinhibition, impulsivity, lack of empathy) that justify the diagnosis of "acquired sociopathy/psychopathy”. A correlation between the potential for impulsive aggression mediated by limbic brain structures, and the control of the aggression by frontotemporal brain regions has been shown. The individuals with such brain dysfunction have an increased risk of violent behavior and scored high on the Webster’s and Hare’s violence risk assessment scale. This article reviews the relationship between psychiatric comorbidity, violence risk assessment and neuroimaging in forensic psychiatry and showing the useful directions for future research, screening and prevention of violent behavior among mentally ill criminal offenders...|$|R

40|$|Background: Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) {{has existed}} as a formal {{consensus}} diagnosis since 1996 and {{is defined by}} dementia and the core features parkinsonism, visual hallucinations and cognitive fluctuations. The original consensus criteria had low sensitivity (20 - 60 %) although the specificity was satisfying. (80 - 100 %) From 2005 the additional suggestive features rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder (RBD), low uptake on Dopamine Transporter Scan (DaTSCAN) and neuroleptic sensitivity have been included to improve sensitivity of the clinical diagnosis. The nosological status of DLB is still discussed, and the frequencies of DLB, and of RBD and other sleep disturbances in DLB, are not known. Objectives: In our first paper we sought to find the frequency of DLB in the Dementia Study of Western Norway, (The DemVest-Study) applying the revised clinical diagnostic DLBcriteria. We compared the frequency of DLB in our cohort applying both the new revised and the original consensus criteria for diagnosing DLB to find if the new criteria are more sensitive. In the second paper we compared the frequency of sleep disturbances in Lewy Body Dementia (LBD) as compared to Alzheimer’s Dementia (AD) and healthy controls. In the third paper we examined how the core and suggestive features of DLB were distributed among all individuals with mild dementia to find empirical support for diagnosing DLB as an own diagnostic entity and to find cut- off values for core and suggestive features designating DLB. Methods: All referrals to 5 specialists out patient clinics doing dementia work up in Western Norway were screened during a 2 year inclusion period. Particular care was taken to screen all included patients for the core and suggestive features of DLB. We offered inclusion to everybody presenting with a first time diagnosis of mild dementia with a MMSE score 20. Exclusion criteria were normal cognition or mild cognitive impairment, severe dementia, <b>organic</b> or functional <b>psychosis</b> and a diagnosis of severe or terminal physical illness. For the first paper dementia was diagnosed according to DSM-IV criteria and DLB according to both the 1996 and 2005 criteria. For the second paper we applied the Mayo Sleep Questionnaire (MSQ) and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) to screen for sleep disturbances. Healthy elderly subjects from the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging were available for comparison. In the third paper we used a two step cluster analysis to classify persons with mild dementia according to continuous scores on scales for the DLB symptoms; hallucinations, fluctuations, parkinsonism and RBD. Results: 196 subjects {{were included in the}} first paper and of these 20 % had DLB according to the revised consensus criteria. We compared the 1996 criteria to the 2005 criteria and found a 25 % increase in patients fulfilling the probable DLB category with the new criteria. The proportion with DLB did not differ according to age bands and dementia severity. (CDR) In the second paper 155 patients with mild dementia who had a caregiver who was also their bed-partner and 420 age matched controls without dementia were included. Participants with Lewy Body Dementia, i. e. DLB and PDD combined, had significantly more sleep disturbances than those with AD (89 % vs. 64 %, p= 0. 008) particularly regarding RBD. (39 % vs. 9 %, p< 0. 0005) Having any sleep disturbance correlated with both anxiety (p= 0. 02) and depression. (p= 0. 03) In the third paper we included 139 persons with mild dementia who had a complete data set for hallucinations, parkinsonism, fluctuations and RBD. Four clusters were identified, one containing persons with high scores on scales for hallucinations, fluctuations and motor parkinsonism (the “LBD-cluster”). A distinct cognitive profile was found for this cluster, with more marked visuospatial deficits. The three other clusters included subjects with very mild or no DLB symptoms (“non LBD-cluster”) and two cluster with pronounced RBD or Visual hallucinations. (VH) Cut-off scores on scales for the DLB symptoms were suggested based on the scores in the four clusters. Conclusions: DLB is the second most frequent primary dementia in specialist out patients’ clinics in Western Norway and accounts for 20 % of the mild dementia population in this setting. The revised clinical diagnostic criteria have increased sensitivity as compared to the original criteria. LBD patients have significantly more sleep disturbances as compared to AD supporting the incorporation of RBD in the clinical diagnostic criteria for DLB. Sleep disturbances in mild dementia is related to anxiety and depression underlining their clinical importance. The core and suggestive features of DLB cluster in our sample of persons with mild dementia, thereby supporting the validity of DLB as a distinct diagnostic entity. The differentiation of DLB from other types of mild dementias can be made according to suggested cut-off values on scales for the core and suggestive DLB features...|$|R

40|$|Background: Niemann-Pick disease type C (NP-C) is a rare, {{inherited}} {{neurodegenerative disease}} of impaired intracellular lipid trafficking. Clinical symptoms are highly heterogeneous, including neurological, visceral, or psychiatric manifestations. The incidence of NP-C is under-estimated due to under-recognition or misdiagnosis {{across a wide}} range of medical fields. New screening and diagnostic methods provide an opportunity to improve detection of unrecognized cases in clinical sub-populations associated with a higher risk of NP-C. Patients in these at-risk groups (clinical niches) have symptoms that are potentially related to NP-C, but go unrecognized due to other, more prevalent clinical features, and lack of awareness regarding underlying metabolic causes. Methods: Twelve potential clinical niches identified by clinical experts were evaluated based on a comprehensive, non-systematic review of literature published to date. Relevant publications were identified by targeted literature searches of EMBASE and PubMed using key search terms specific to each niche. Articles published in English or other European languages up to 2016 were included. Findings: Several niches were found to be relevant based on available data: movement disorders (early-onset ataxia and dystonia), <b>organic</b> <b>psychosis,</b> early-onset cholestasis/(hepato) splenomegaly, cases with relevant antenatal findings or fetal abnormalities, and patients affected by family history, consanguinity, and endogamy.

40|$|The {{arguments}} in the literature for and against "mental illness", are shown to founder {{on the lack of}} a thorough analysis of the sense of "illness" itself. Such an analysis is developed in the present study in three main stages. STAGE ONE: The ordinary use of "dysfunction" is examined. The term is shown to imply a particular kind of value judgement, derived, in respect of objects, from the purposes of living things for them. STAGE TWO: The sense of "illness" is interpreted from examples of physical illness by comparing and contrasting it with "dysfunction". An important logical link with "action" is identified, which provides an interpretation of the particular kind of negative evaluation implied by "illness". The relationship between "illness" and "disease" is examined in terms of this negative evaluation. STAGE THREE: The results of stage two are generalised from "physical illness" to "mental illness" by way of the notion of "action". "Mental illness" is examined as illustrated by examples of four main kinds of condition - <b>organic</b> <b>psychosis,</b> neurosis, addiction and functional psychosis. In respect of the first of these, "mental illness" is shown to be similar in its logical properties to "physical illness"; in respect of the remaining three, it is shown to be different, but in three quite distinct ways. In each case, however, the properties of "mental illness" are derived consistently with the interpretation of "illness" developed from examples of physical illness in stage two. "Mental illness" and "physical illness" are thus shown to be logically equivalent. In a concluding section, the implications of this result for the debate about "mental illness" are examined. </p...|$|E

All cases of <b>organic</b> <b>psychosis,</b> 41. 6 % of the affective disorder and 29. 4 % of the schizophrenia group had {{one or more of}} the physical complications during pregnancy, around delivery or during post-partum period. 25. 2 % of the cases had previous psychiatric illness following childbirth. 52. 9 % of the cases developed psychiatric illness in the 1 st fortnight after delivery. The result of the treatment was highly satisfactory, showing improvement of all the patients included in this study. Although psychiatric ailment followingchildbirth has been recognised since the time of Hippocrates, there has been a lot of controversy as to its claim as a separate disease entity. In the early stages of the illness the clinical picture is often atypical with nonspecific prodromal symptoms and differentiation into typical functional psychoses or into organic reaction occurs only later in the course of the illness (Hamilton, 1962). Women with puerperal psychosis tend to come from families where the incidence of mental disorder is as high as in the families of patients with non-puerperal psychosis (Tetlow, 1955; Janson, 1964; Protheroe, 1969). Among women suffering from manic-depressive disorder the incidence of puerperal depression was at least ten times higher than that in the general populatio...|$|E
40|$|Classifications in {{psychiatry}} {{have always}} posed a challenge, particularly for {{those involved in}} the pursuit of academic systematization of syndromes (Spitzer et al., 1978). References are available which indicate that Greek Physicians developed a system which may well be termed as Biological (Nancy & Spitzer, 1979). And then we have the humoral theorists who advocated the concept of imbalances in the humours leading to the imbalance of temparaments (Fisher, 1936). This particular concept has not {{stood the test of time}} but has indeed encouraged a number of workers in the past and in recent times towards evolving a more acceptable and universal frame of reference. We are aware of the fact that Kraepelin attempted to identify and describe definite clinical syndromes (Kraepelin, 1896). In particular he arranged mental disorders into <b>organic</b> <b>psychosis,</b> endogenous psychosis (without known structural pathology) and the deviations of personality and Reaction states. It may be recalled that endogenous psychosis was divided into two categories on the basis of phenomenological studies, i. e. Dementia Praecox and Manic Depressive Insanity. Such a division made a tremendous impact, atleast at that time when confusion was the prevalent mood in terms cf understanding as related to classification. We would also recall that Kleist (Kraepelin, 1921) compared the endo-genous psychoses with organic states, and since there indeed were some similarities, one was left with the impression that the endogenous psychoses too were organic in nature. Kleist (Kraepelin, 1921) also made a reference to Atypical Psychoses—to which he assigned the label marginal psychosis. In subsequent years the contributions of Kraepelin, Vernicke and Kleist either lay dormant or were inadequately highlighted. It was left to Leonhard (Leonhard, 1957 - 1969) to revive the interest with vigour, leading to enunciation of an impressiv...|$|E
40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo analyze {{comparability}} {{between the}} ninth and tenth {{revisions of the}} International Classification of Diseases (ICD) applied to coding causes of death in Spain. MethodsAccording to the ninth and tenth revisions of the ICD, 80, 084 statistical bulletins of mortality registered in 1999 were assigned the Basic Cause of Death. The statistical bulletins corresponded to the Autonomous Communities of Andalusia, Cantabria, Murcia, Navarre and the Basque Country, {{and the city of}} Barcelona. The underlying causes of death were classified into 17 groups. Simple correspondence, the Kappa index and the comparability ratio for major causes were calculated. ResultsA total of 3. 6 % of deaths changed group due to an increase (36. 4 %) in infectious and parasitic diseases, mainly because of the inclusion of AIDS, and a corresponding decrease due to the exclusion of endocrine, nutritional and metabolic disorders. Furthermore, myelodysplastic syndrome was moved to the category of neoplasm. The group including nervous system diseases, eye and related diseases, and ear and mastoid apophysis diseases increased (14. 7 %) at the expense of mental and behavior disorders, due to the inclusion of senile and presenile <b>organic</b> <b>psychosis.</b> Poorly-defined entities increased (14. 1 %) due to the inclusion of cardiac arrest and its synonyms, together with heart failure, to the detriment of diseases of the vascular system. Diseases of the respiratory system increased (4. 8 %) due to the inclusion of respiratory failure, previously considered as a poorly defined cause. The correspondence for all causes was 96. 4 % and kappa's index was 94. 9 %ConclusionsThe introduction of ICD- 10 affects the comparability of statistical series of mortality according to cause. The results of this study allow us to identify the main modifications and to quantify the changes in the major causes of mortality in Spain...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with a study of thresholds of critical flicker fusion frequency (C. F. F.) of a light stimulus in patients suffering from multiple sclerosis. The capacity of normal human vision to appreciate the intermittency of rapidly repeated light stimuli {{is a function of}} great physiological interest, and it may be impaired by disease at many sites in the visual pathway. Thus Parsons and Miller (1957) examined cases of multiple sclerosis on the hypothesis that general damage within the central nervous system might be responsible for depressing critical flicker fusion frequency. However, they found the C. F. F. so frequently impaired in their group that they were forced to conclude that retrobulbar neuritis must play a part in damaging its perceptual mechanism. They noted a correlation with pallor of the discs but did not observe cases during the course of retro-bulbar neuritis. They suggested the potential value of C. F. F. estimation as a diagnostic test. These observations showed such a striking difference between cases of multiple sclerosis and controls that it appeared profitable to validate them for estima-tions made with different apparatus, and if possible to confirm their conclusion that depression of C. F. F. was related to the occurrence of retrobulbar neuritis. The relation between C. F. F. and visual acuity and the visual fields in multiple sclerosis is also of considerable interest. Kurachi and Yonemura (1956) investigated four cases of retrobulbar neuritis and demonstrated the slower rate at which the flickering light was fused subjectively. Most of the work on flicker fusion has been carried out by ophthalmologists but psychiatrists have also taken an interest in the subject in relation to its impairment in <b>organic</b> <b>psychosis.</b> Phillips (1933) and Riddell (1936) have studied the visual fields by means of flicker {{from the point of view}} of the neurosurgeon and this work made it clear that C. F. F. might be depressed by lesions far removed from the retina an...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: This thesis explores {{different}} symptom profiles {{found in}} First Episode Psychosis (FEP) patients assessed at several points of time over a ten year period. Earlier {{studies have focused}} predominantly on groups of symptoms rather than individual symptoms when describing course of illness and outcome, and long-term studies of symptom development in epidemiological FEP samples assessed multiples times are lacking. By studying individual symptoms longitudinally from the onset of illness we aimed to gain more knowledge about symptom development {{and the relationship between}} symptoms and outcome variables that are known to be affected in psychotic disorders. The aim of the study was threefold: 1) to identify a group of patients with delusions only and a group with hallucinations only, and examine if the groups differed with regard to demographics, clinical variables and outcome measures, and in particular suicidality, 2) to assess the prevalence of apathy ten years after the first psychotic episode, and to explore the association between apathy and general functioning, and between apathy and quality of life, and 3) to identify different flat affect (FA) symptom profiles based on longitudinal symptom trajectories and assess the prevalence and correlates of these trajectories, to assess predictors of enduring FA, and to explore the longitudinal relationship between FA and social functioning. Methods: Three-hundred-and-one first episode, non <b>organic</b> <b>psychosis</b> patients were included in the TIPS Study (Early Treatment and Intervention in Psychosis) and followed over a ten year period. Patients were assessed at baseline, three months, and one, two, five and ten year follow-up with an extensive battery of instruments including measures of demographics, duration of untreated psychosis (DUP), premorbid function (PAS), diagnosis (SCID), symptom measures (PANSS, AES, CDSS), measures of functioning (GAF, SCLFS), suicidality and quality of life (L-QoLI). The relationship of the symptoms of interest, namely hallucinations and delusions (PANSS P 1 and P 3, respectively), apathy (AES-SApathy and PANSS N 2 +N 4) and flat affect (PANSS N 1), to the above measures were assessed with t-test, correlation and regression analyses. Results: Sub-groups of patients with hallucinations only and delusions only can be identified in a five year follow-up study, and the groups differed on multiple variables. Most importantly, the hallucination only group scored higher on measures of suicidality, and insight might be a possible mediator of suicidality in this group. Apathy was found to be a common symptom ten years after the first psychotic episode, affecting 30 % of the sample. Proxy-measures of apathy indicated that this symptom declined in the follow-up period. Clinical apathy was strongly related to poorer functioning and to poorer subjective quality of life in patients ten years after the first psychotic episode. Five different FA trajectory groups were identified. FA was more fluctuant than expected, and only 5 % of the sample experienced enduring FA. Furthermore, FA was related to poorer functional outcome measures, in particular to objective social functioning, both premorbidly and throughout the ten year follow-up period. Conclusions: By looking at individual symptoms rather than groups of symptoms it was possible to shed light on patients with symptom profiles that previously have received limited attention, and {{to learn more about the}} long-term development of the individual symptoms. Combined, the findings highlight the importance of looking at symptoms separately in order to both better understand the longitudinal association between symptoms, and to gain knowledge of how individual symptom profiles affect outcome measures including suicidality, quality of life, and social functioning.
