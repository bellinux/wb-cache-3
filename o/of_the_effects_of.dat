This study was undertaken on 277 students of economics faculty of semarang state university as the samples using propotional random sampling. In addition, the data collection technique used was a questionnaire, then the data were analyzed by path analysis. <b>The</b> results <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study showed that there were 21. 7 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> effectof personality towards the entrepreneurial interest, 18 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> adversity quotient toward <b>the</b> student’s entrepreneurial interest, 57 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> self efficacy towards <b>the</b> student’s entrepreneurial interest, 49 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> personality towards <b>the</b> self efficacy, 20. 2 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> adversity quotient towards <b>the</b> self efficacy, 27. 9 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> personality through self efficacy towards the students’ entrepreneurial interest, and 11. 5 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> adversity quotient through <b>the</b> self efficacy towards the entrepreneurial interest.

5|$|Aspirin {{is readily}} broken {{down in the}} body to {{salicylic}} acid, which itself has anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, and analgesic effects. In 2012, salicylic acid was found to activate AMP-activated protein kinase, which has been suggested as a possible explanation for some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> both salicylic acid and aspirin. The acetyl portion of the aspirin molecule has its own targets. Acetylation of cellular proteins is a well-established phenomenon in the regulation of protein function at the post-translational level. Aspirin is able to acetylate several other targets in addition to COX isoenzymes. These acetylation reactions may explain many hitherto unexplained effects of aspirin.|$|E

5|$|Fermi {{was fond}} of {{pointing}} out that Alessandro Volta, working in his laboratory, could have {{had no idea where}} the study of electricity would lead. Fermi is generally remembered for his work on nuclear power and nuclear weapons, especially the creation of the first nuclear reactor, and the development of the first atomic and hydrogen bombs. His scientific work has stood the test of time. This includes his theory of beta decay, his work with non-linear systems, his discovery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> slow neutrons, his study of pion-nucleon collisions, and his Fermi–Dirac statistics. His speculation that a pion was not a fundamental particle pointed the way towards the study of quarks and leptons.|$|E

5|$|In the {{ten years}} after the fall of Zaculeu various Spanish expeditions crossed into the Sierra de los Cuchumatanes and engaged in the gradual and complex conquest of the Chuj and Q'anjob'al. The Spanish were {{attracted}} to the region in the hope of extracting gold, silver and other riches from the mountains but their remoteness, the difficult terrain and relatively low population made their conquest and exploitation extremely difficult. The population of the Cuchumatanes is estimated to have been 260,000 before European contact. By the time the Spanish physically arrived in the region this had collapsed to 150,000 because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> the Old World diseases that had run ahead of them.|$|E

5|$|Operation Sandstone was {{a series}} of nuclear weapon tests in 1948. It was the third series of American tests, {{following}} Trinity in 1945 and Crossroads in 1946, and preceding Ranger. Like the Crossroads tests, the Sandstone tests were carried out at the Pacific Proving Grounds, although at Enewetak Atoll rather than Bikini Atoll. They differed from Crossroads in that they were conducted by the Atomic Energy Commission, with the armed forces having only a supporting role. The purpose of the Sandstone tests was also different: they were primarily tests of new bomb designs rather than <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> nuclear weapons. Three tests were carried out in April and May 1948 by Joint Task Force 7, with a work force of 10,366 personnel, of whom 9,890 were military.|$|E

5|$|The species' genetic {{diversity}} {{is similar to}} that of other pocket gophers occupying a larger geographic range and diversity of habitat. Compared to Townsend's pocket gopher, which is distributed across a much larger area, but less diverse habitat, it is more genetically heterogeneous. Although there is considerable differentiation between separate populations of camas pocket gophers, their genetic variability does not affect the mammal's appearance. Study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> genetic change over time revealed a pattern affected by a cataclysmic event across the species' entire geographic area about 13,000 years ago.

5|$|There are {{two aspects}} to {{the harmful effects}} of plutonium: the {{radioactivity}} and the heavy metal poison effects.

Studies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> these smaller releases, {{as well as of the}} widespread radiation poisoning sickness and death following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, have provided considerable information regarding the dangers, symptoms and prognosis of radiation poisoning, which in the case of the Japanese Hibakusha/survivors was largely unrelated to direct plutonium exposure.|$|E

In 1926, he was more successful and his performances helped Sussex to rise from thirteenth to tenth in the County Championship. Playing more games, he scored 1,037 runs at 30.50, the highest seasonal batting average of his career, and took 75 wickets at 20.74. That season, although no longer considered for a place in the England team himself, Gilligan joined the panel of Test selectors, and as a consequence missed some cricket for Sussex. He published a book on that summer's tour by Australia called Collins's Men.|$|E
