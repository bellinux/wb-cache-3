25|$|I, who was {{the liaison}} officer of the Irgun central command with Jabotinsky, and who {{accompanied}} him almost daily for four years—remained loyal to his teachings. I also believe that the Land of Israel, on both banks of the Jordan River, is our historic homeland. But I am also certain that had Jabotinsky lived today, he would have argued that now, after we've achieved our independence, <b>our</b> <b>mission</b> <b>is</b> to attain peace {{in order to establish}} the Israeli people as the political heir of the Jewish people.|$|E

500|$|The {{society was}} officially formed in January 1935 to lead {{wilderness}} preservation in the United States. [...] Additional founding members included notable conservationists Bob Marshall, Benton MacKaye, Bernard Frank, Aldo Leopold, and Harvey Broome. [...] In September, Yard published {{the first issue}} of the society's magazine, The Living Wilderness. [...] He wrote of the society's genesis, [...] "The Wilderness Society is born of an emergency in conservation which admits of no delay. [...] The craze is to build all the highways possible everywhere while billions may yet be borrowed from the unlucky future. [...] The fashion is to barber and manicure wild America as smartly as the modern girl. [...] <b>Our</b> <b>mission</b> <b>is</b> clear." ...|$|E
500|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, the Soviet {{leadership}} headed by Leonid Brezhnev, Alexei Kosygin and the Politburo, were {{not eager to}} send troops to Afghanistan. The Soviet Politburo decisions were guided by a Special Commission on Afghanistan, which consisted of Yuri Andropov the KGB Chairman, Andrei Gromyko the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Defence Minister Dmitriy Ustinov, and Boris Ponomarev, {{the head of the}} International Department of the Central Committee. The Politburo was opposed to the removal of Taraki and his subsequent murder. According to Brezhnev, the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, [...] "Events developed so swiftly in Afghanistan that essentially there was little opportunity to somehow interfere in them. Right now <b>our</b> <b>mission</b> <b>is</b> to determine our further actions, so as to preserve our position in Afghanistan and to secure our influence there." [...] Although Afghan–Soviet relations deteriorated during Amin's short stint in power, he was invited on an official visit to Moscow by Alexander Puzanov, the Soviet ambassador to Afghanistan, because of the Soviet leadership's satisfaction with his party and state-building policy. Not everything went as planned, and Andropov talked about [...] "the undesirable turn of events" [...] taking place in Afghanistan under Amin's rule. Andropov also brought up the ongoing political shift in Afghanistan under Amin; the Soviets were afraid that Amin would move Afghanistan's foreign policy from a pro-Soviet position to a pro-United States position. By early-to-mid December 1979, the Soviet leadership had established an alliance with Babrak Karmal and Assadullah Sarwari.|$|E

2500|$|The crisis {{continued}} to worsen. [...] By {{the third week}} of October, the number of Ebola patients had increased to almost 60, overwhelming the volunteers in the isolation ward. [...] Lukwiya ordered other nurses to assist the patients and tried to lead by example, working with Ebola patients from 7 am to 8 pm. [...] However, despite instituting risk minimisation procedures, including wearing of robes, multiple gloves, surgical masks and goggles, hospital workers {{continued to}} fall ill. [...] Twelve more died. [...] At the funeral of an Italian nun on 7 November, he attempted to rally the morale of his workers: [...] "It is our vocation to save life. [...] It involves risk, but when we serve with love, that is when the risk does not matter so much. When we believe <b>our</b> <b>mission</b> <b>is</b> to save lives, we have got to do our work." ...|$|E

I promise to work tirelessly to convince voters that I am the man to lead us through these decisions... Our economy is being renewed but we have much more to do to ensure everybody feels the benefit. <b>Our</b> <b>mission</b> <b>is</b> therefore to build the economic powerhouse of Britain in an inclusive way. That will need leadership from somebody who has a proven record, can bring people together and can represent us with passion. This election needs to go beyond traditional political loyalties and I look forward to seeking voters' support for the job ahead." [...] The following day, it was confirmed that Street would leave John Lewis at the end of October 2016. He was succeeded by Paula Nickolds, who assumed the role in January 2017.|$|E

Mark well all that passes, and what is doing, and all bodies of men who enter or leave the castle. There is no {{occasion}} to bring news to me, for it would be unlikely that we should meet in the forest; you have therefore only to watch. Tomorrow I shall return with the band, and encamp in the woods farther back. Directly we arrive, you will be relieved of your guard." ...|$|E

"I think," [...] he {{said when}} the meal was over and the waiter had placed the dessert and wine {{on the table and}} had retired, [...] "that {{we are going to have}} a very {{pleasant}} cruise. I am afraid we sha'n't have much chance of distinguishing ourselves in the fighting way, though we may pick up some of those rascally little craft that prey on the native commerce and capture a small European merchantman occasionally. With our small crew we certainly cannot regard ourselves as a match for any of the regular pirates, who would carry vastly heavier metal, and crews of at least four times our strength. The admiral expressly warned me that it was not intended that the Arrow should undertake that sort of business. <b>Our</b> <b>mission</b> <b>is</b> rather to gain news of what passes in the interior, pick up fugitives who may be hiding in the woods, and act in fact as a sort of floating observatory. Any fighting, therefore, that we may get will be if we are attacked. In that case, of course, we shall do our best. I am sure we shall be a pleasant party on board. Of course in a small craft like this we shall mess together. It is necessary, for the sake of discipline, that when we are on deck we should follow the usual observances, but when we are below together we shall be three mess-mates without any formality or nonsense." ...|$|E
