25|$|The <b>original</b> <b>submission</b> {{consisted}} of nine steel truss highway bridges in Fulton County, of nearly identical construction, spanning the Spoon River. They {{were located in}} or near various communities, and were collectively admitted to the National Register of Historic Places on October 29, 1980.|$|E
25|$|Washington was {{not entirely}} pleased with the <b>original</b> <b>submission,</b> however; he found it too small, lacking ornament, and not monumental enough to house the nation's president. On his recommendation, the house was changed from three stories to two, and was widened from a nine-bay facade to an 11-bay facade. Hoban's {{competition}} drawings do not survive.|$|E
25|$|In {{situations}} where multiple referees disagree substantially {{about the quality}} of a work, {{there are a number of}} strategies for reaching a decision. When a publisher receives very positive and very negative reviews for the same manuscript, the publisher will often solicit one or more additional reviews as a tie-breaker. As another strategy in the case of ties, the publisher may invite authors to reply to a referee's criticisms and permit a compelling rebuttal to break the tie. If a publisher does not feel confident to weigh the persuasiveness of a rebuttal, the publisher may solicit a response from the referee who made the original criticism. A publisher may convey communications back and forth between authors and a referee, in effect allowing them to debate a point. Even in these cases, however, publishers do not allow multiple referees to confer with each other, though each reviewer may often see earlier comments submitted by other reviewers. The goal of the process is explicitly not to reach consensus or to persuade anyone to change their opinions, but instead to provide material for an informed editorial decision. Some medical journals, usually following the open access model, have begun posting on the Internet the pre-publication history of each individual article, from the <b>original</b> <b>submission</b> to reviewers' reports, authors' comments, and revised manuscripts.|$|E

2500|$|Missouri: The {{design contest}} winner for the Missouri quarter, Paul Jackson, has {{claimed that the}} Mint {{engraver}} needlessly redesigned Jackson's <b>original</b> <b>submission.</b> The Mint stated that Jackson's design was not coinable, but a private mint later demonstrated that it was. It emerged that Mint engravers may exercise discretion in the final design of U.S. coinage, and the term [...] "design contest" [...] was dropped from solicitations for ideas for later state quarters.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the time}} of the <b>original</b> <b>submission,</b> the area {{continued}} within the University-Cultural Center had numerous structures and historic districts already listed on the National Register of Historic Places. These included structures built as private homes (the David Mackenzie House, Col. Frank J. Hecker House, and David Whitney House), public-oriented structures (the Hilberry Theatre, Scarab Club, Orchestra Hall, Detroit Institute of Arts, [...] Rackham Building, Detroit Public Library, and Old Main), large apartment and commercial buildings (the Belcrest and Maccabees Building) and two historic districts (the East Ferry Avenue Historic District and the [...] West Canfield Historic District).|$|E
50|$|In October 1974, HCF, in {{association}} with MBF, challenged the refusal by the then Commonwealth Minister for Social Security to approve increases in contribution rates which the funds required to meet benefit payments on higher public hospital charges.

30|$|In {{this special}} issue, we have {{received}} a total of 32 <b>original</b> <b>submissions,</b> out of which 11 (34 %) papers are accepted for publication after peer review. We regret {{that we had to}} reject many good papers due to the limited number of papers that can be published in this special issue. The accepted papers cover a broad area of PLNC-related topics, including channel estimation, protocol design, scheduling, resource allocation, and channel code design for network coded schemes.|$|R
2500|$|Absolute {{bioavailability}} of rosuvastatin {{is about}} 20% and Cmax is reached in 3 to 5 hours; administration with food {{did not affect}} the AUC according to the original sponsor submitted clinical study and as per product label. However, a subsequent clinical study has shown a marked reduction in rosuvastatin exposure when administered with food. It is 88% protein bound, mainly to albumin. [...] Fraction absorbed of rosuvastatin is frequently misquoted in the literature as approximately 0.5 (50%) due to a miscalculated hepatic extraction ratio in the <b>original</b> <b>submission</b> package subsequently corrected by the FDA reviewer. It is likely that closer to 0.25 (25%) of the administered dose is absorbed.|$|E
2500|$|After {{submitting}} Somewhere in England to Warner Bros. Records, {{the distributor}} of his Dark Horse record label, in late September 1980, Harrison {{was forced to}} rework {{the content of the}} album – including replacing four of the original songs – to ensure the release had more commercial appeal. Harrison chose to retain [...] "Life Itself" [...] and worked with Ray Cooper on a second version of the album. For these sessions, beginning in November, Harrison enlisted keyboardist Al Kooper to complete the recordings. Kooper overdubbed a Hammond organ part, adding to Brooker's original contribution. In Leng's description, the gospel inflections of this final addition combine with Harrison's backing vocals and [...] "guitar choir" [...] to [...] "convey his spiritual vision in music". The mix of the song changed significantly between the <b>original</b> <b>submission</b> and the reworked album, for which Cooper was credited as a co-producer.|$|E
2500|$|The initial {{version of}} the {{aircraft}} had been intended strictly for the aerial reconnaissance role, for which it would have employed its [...] "Red Drover" [...] sideways-looking radar to find targets for attack by the V bomber force that would follow. As development had progressed, {{it became clear that}} the radar would not necessitate as bulky an antenna as initially believed, which had the result of freeing up considerable internal space. In response, the RAF began to concentrate on a secondary bombing role for the type, for which it was to carry both the radar along with a long bomb bay, in which either a weapon or additional fuel could be contained within. A high-speed bomber requirement was also being studied at the time, OR.336, so the two projects were combined into the new RB.156 requirement in October 1955. This led to the Avro 730 undergoing a fairly substantial redesign to correspond with the new requirements being issued. Avro had anticipated this eventuality in their <b>original</b> <b>submission.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The Jets {{name was}} chosen by a name-the-team contest. Choices were Jackals, Jaguars, Jayhawks, Jets, and Juggernauts, having been whittled down from over 200 <b>original</b> <b>submissions.</b> The Jets name and logo were {{announced}} on June 5, 2009, with [...] "Jets" [...] taking 35% of the vote. The name is the name as a previous Janesville hockey team, which played in the former Continental Hockey League in the 1981-82 season. The logo was designed by Tony DiNicola and Christy Kapellen.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>original</b> <b>submissions</b> in January 1920 were {{in order}} for the Prince to have the {{opportunity}} during his visit to make the trip from Melbourne to Sydney overland along the route. Different routes were considered, including the inland route via [...] [...] This idea never came to fruition, due partly to the limited amount of time and the cost to construct the road to a suitable standard for him to undertake the trip. The Prince did, however, give his permission for the naming.|$|R

The poster presentation would be an examination of the implications that such elements would have on the collection and on the representation of communities– and I will illustrate in real time how adding folksonomies into the current taxonomy data model would inherently alter the collection on a fundamental level.
