40|$|The nonuse of {{community}} correction in the Nigeria {{criminal justice system}} has led to increased recidivism, contributed to prison congestion, introduced the risk of prison victimization, and lacked the provision of a rehabilitative structure for nonviolent offenders. The purpose of this phenomenological research {{study was to explore}} Nigerian judges 2 ̆ 7 use of alternatives to incarcerations for nonviolent offenders. Dolinko retributive punishment theory provided the theoretical framework for this study. Ten participant judges comprised the study sample from a purposeful and criterion random sampling method.

According to study findings, judges were inclined to use alternatives to incarceration for nonviolent offenders.

This paper presents and comments on the management model of infectious diseases in foreign prisoners at our outpatient clinic, in order to describe a model of management for these conditions. Overall, 133 subjects (mean age 35. 5 years) from 29 countries were followed {{for a period of}} 15 years. The most commonly represented area of origin (54. 1 %) was the Maghreb region. HCV infection (40. 6 %), HIV (22. 5 %), HBV (9. 8 %) and co-infection (15 %, HIV/HCV or HIV/HBV) were observed. Ten subjects had tuberculosis, and only 30 % of them were compliant with the treatment. Only 46. 3 % of HCV mono-infected patients completed the entire diagnostic process and even a lower percentage (37 %) of them took treatment regularly. 90 % of HBV mono-infected patients and 84 % of those HIV mono- and co-infected completed the diagnostic workout. 77 % of patients in each group took therapy regularly. Overall, the results show limited effectiveness. Therefore, it would be necessary to improve communication between healthcare professionals and correctional systems. Moreover, it appears urgent to reduce <b>overcrowding</b> <b>in</b> <b>prisons</b> to limit morbidity in prisoners...|$|E
40|$|A {{literature}} review of international studies on either sexuality or exposure to sexual violence in prison suggests that inmates face {{various forms of}} deprivation and sexual victimisation and points to high prevalence rates, especially in countries with {{a high rate of}} incarceration and <b>overcrowding</b> <b>in</b> <b>prisons.</b> No single concept pervades the early literature about prison culture and inmate sexuality more than deprivation. According to this concept, the basic structure of inmate culture in general and inmate sexual culture in particular is a response to multiple deprivations. By contrast the importation model proposed by IRWIN & CRESSEY (1962) views the prison culture as primarily the result of the importation of attitudes, norms and mores inmates brought into prison from the outside world. The following thesis includes the results of research conducted in the Berlin-Tegel prison in 2010, in which 60 long-term inmates answered questionnaires regarding their partner status, sexual orientation, sexual interests, frequency of masturbation and accompanying fantasies, as well as their history of consensual sexual relations prior to and during incarceration. These data may now be considered alongside the socio-demographic and forensic characteristics. The results of the study strongly suggest that the deprivation theory, according to which incarceration acts upon the inmate's libido {{in the manner of a}} deprivation, is at least partially invalid. The data obtainable from the few scientific studies by criminological research teams as to the circumstances of incarceration, and more importantly, of victimization in German prisons, offer only sporadic information about the amount of sexual violence in the prison systems of the individual Federal states. What these studies have in common is the assumption that the daily experience of male inmates is largely determined by harassment, violence, and suffering in the context of sexual self-determination. This thesis presents data on the incidence and prevalence of non-consensual sexual relations in the Berlin-Tegel prison...|$|E

40|$|The World Prison Brief Walmsley (2001 : 2) {{reveals that}} there are 8, 7 million people held in penal {{institutions}} throughout the world, either as pre-trial detainees or having been convicted and sentenced. Although the rising prison population in South Africa is of great concern, {{it is certainly not}} just a South African problem, but an international phenomenon. Prison overcrowding and the resultant financial and human rights problems related to this phenomenon, remain one of the paramount concerns of both developed and developing countries. Overcrowding of prisons negates the rehabilitation of offenders, undermines human dignity in correctional facilities and renders the safety and security of offenders and the community vulnerable. Another problem facing the Department of Correctional Services is the control of communicable diseases and viruses, particularly HIV/AIDS and Tuberculosis. The problem of overcrowding facilitates the easy spread of communicable diseases among inmates. Imprisonment as a sanction remains a reality. Providing alternatives to imprisonment, for example, community based-sanctions, does however ensure that a significant number of offenders can be dealt with in a more balanced manner. Alternative sanctions to incarceration can be more successful, less costly to the state, have fewer negative implications and will lighten the load for the criminal justice system, hence reducing overcrowding. In order to reduce the <b>overcrowding</b> <b>in</b> <b>prisons</b> {{there has to be a}} reduction in the number of both awaiting-trial and sentenced prisoners. Reducing the inflow of offenders from the courts to the prisons and trying to get minor offenders in prison to be released should accomplish this. Courts and magistrates must break away from centuries of reliance on imprisonment as punishment. If more people show interest in the human rights of incarcerated prisoners, then further effort will be placed on resolving the overpopulation problem facing the Department of Correctional Services.

40|$|The main {{argument}} of this thesis {{is that the}} penitentiary crisis in Venezuela is brought about an inept criminal justice system whose functioning (or lack thereof) further exacerbates overcrowding in penitentiary facilities as well as violates the most basic human rights. More elaborately, I argue that the unintentional (mis) use of pre-trial preventive detention, one {{of the consequences of}} the inept criminal justice system, further exacerbates the <b>overcrowding</b> <b>in</b> <b>prisons</b> and creates serious human rights implications. The {{purpose of this study is}} to establish a connection between the penitentiary crisis in Venezuela, with a focus on pre-trial preventive detention, and the larger criminal justice system failure in the country. The data source and data gathering technique for the thesis consists of a content analysis and a secondary literature review. Since the theoretical framework of the project is international human rights, instruments from the United Nations and the Organization of American States are used. Reports from non-governmental organizations like Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and Observatorio Venezolano de Prisiones provide the data to conduct the analysis which is specific to pre-trial preventive detention in Venezuela. These reports are produced on a yearly basis and will help to compliment the data obtained from government sources, mainly the Venezuelan Ombudsman 2 ̆ 7 s office. The findings of the thesis support the argument that contrary to common belief, the (mis) use of pre-trial preventive detention in Venezuela is in fact mainly accidental, it is not systematic in the sense that it is not targeting a particular group of people due to their political affiliation and/or beliefs. Furthermore, I prove that Venezuelan penitentiary facilities are overcrowded due to the (mis) use of pre-trial preventive detention. Immediate recommendations for the Venezuelan state include re-categorizing the penal population in Venezuela as well as diminishing the use of deprivation of liberty, specifically pre-trial preventive detention...|$|E
40|$|The United States of America has {{the biggest}} prison {{population}} in the world. With problems and concerns over <b>overcrowding</b> <b>in</b> <b>prisons,</b> human rights abuses, and recidivism of the incarcerated population, {{there is a strong}} argument for the adequate rehabilitation of prisoners so that they can re-enter and co-exist peacefully with the rest of mainstream society. Research has shown that frequent adult offenders of serious, violent, and sometimes gang-related crime share the similar risk factor of delinquent behaviour in their youth; being incarcerated at a young age increases one’s chance of incarceration as an adult. With the increasing criticism of its criminal justice system, particularly over human rights concerns, American society {{can no longer afford to}} ignore this problem, both economically (by investing in more prisons) and socially (by not redressing the structural and cultural violence facing the poor, especially those belonging to disadvantaged minority groups). The incarceration epidemic of America is a reflection of how its social inequalities with a strong component of racial disparity are causing so many avoidable deaths, especially among youth of colour and low-socio economic standing. In an attempt to address this problem, there has been a strong social movement of using community-based arts programmes to assist in the early intervention of at-risk youth in hopes to prevent them from becoming too embedded in the street life of gangs and crime so that they can escape the cycle of violence, drugs, poverty, and incarceration. There are ten mechanisms that contribute to their success. In theory, these mechanisms, when implemented effectively, can help incarcerated youth, those not just at-risk but in-risk, to resist the street life and avoid future incarceration of more serious crimes. In practice, these mechanisms are extremely difficult to operationalise though not impossible, but they do face challenges and limitations that reduce their long-term impact. Despite this setback, their place in the prevention programming field in giving voice to a marginalised group is of significance. The process of creating art and the end-products created by the youth participating in these programmes carry important policy implications for structural change, increase awareness for cultural change, and empower these in-risk youth to seek out personally change to lead a better, longer life...|$|E
