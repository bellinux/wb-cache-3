5|$|Hadley {{is known}} for his account of animal {{property}} rights theory. He proposes that wild animals be offered property rights over their territories, and that guardians be appointed to represent their interests in decision-making procedures. He suggests that this account could be justified directly, on the basis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> the animals concerned, or indirectly, so that natural environments are protected. The theory has received discussion in popular and academic contexts, with critical responses from farming groups and mixed responses from moral and political theorists. Hadley has also conducted research on normative issues related to animal rights extremism, the aiding of others and utilitarianism.|$|E
5|$|The Court {{made clear}} that the {{interests}} of children should be assumed to be covered as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> the parent, not treated as separate, but this doctrine has been less clear in practice as termination proceedings still focus on the fitness of the parent. This has resulted in further constitutional protections for parents and increasingly formal termination proceedings that limit the contribution of the child's interests in the proceedings. Santosky has also contributed to the role of parental rights of undocumented immigrants as the constitutionally protected parental rights may apply to non-citizens as well as United States citizens.|$|E
5|$|According to Russian {{psychiatrist}} Emmanuil Gushansky, psychiatry is {{the only}} medical specialty in which the doctor is given the right to violence {{for the benefit of}} the patient. The application of violence must be based on the mental health law, must be as much as possible transparent and monitored by representatives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> persons who are in need of involuntary examination and treatment. While being hospitalized in a psychiatric hospital for urgent indications, the patient should be accompanied by his relatives, witnesses, or other persons authorized to control the actions of doctors and law-enforcement agencies. Otherwise, psychiatry becomes an obedient maid for administrative and governmental agencies and is deprived of its medical function. It is the police that must come to the aid of citizens and is responsible for their security. Only later, after the appropriate legal measures for social protection have been taken, the psychiatrist must respond to the queries of law enforcement and judicial authorities by solving the issues of involuntary hospitalization, sanity, etc. In Russia, all that goes by opposites. The psychiatrist is vested with punitive functions, is involved in involuntary hospitalization, the state machine hides behind his back, actually manipulating the doctor. The police are reluctant to investigate offences committed by the mentally ill. After receiving the information about their disease, the bodies of inquiry very often stop the investigation and do not bring it to the level of investigative actions. Thereby psychiatry becomes a cloak for the course of justice and, by doing so, serves as a source for the rightlessness and stigmatization of both psychiatrists and persons with mental disorders. The negative attitude to psychiatrists is thereby supported by the state machine and is accompanied by the aggression against the doctors, which increases during the periods of social unrest.|$|E

25|$|Corporate {{governance}} in Vietnam is seen {{more as a}} management framework rather than a system for accountability and protecting minority shareholders.

25|$|The first {{effective}} labor {{organization that}} was more than regional in membership and influence was the Knights of Labor, organized in 1869. The Knights believed in the unity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> all producing groups and sought to enlist in their ranks not only all laborers but everyone who could be truly classified as a producer. The acceptance of all producers led to explosive growth after 1880. Under the leadership of Terence V.

25|$|The way the {{individual}} {{rights of a}} family member versus {{the rights of the}} family as a unit are balanced vary significantly in different societies. This may influence {{the degree to which a}} government may be willing to investigate family incidents. In some cultures, individual members of the family are expected to sacrifice almost completely their own interests in favor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> the family as a whole. What is viewed as an undue expression of personal autonomy is condemned as unacceptable. In these cultures the family predominates over {{the individual}}, and where this interacts with cultures of honor, individualistic choice that may damage the family reputation in the community may result in extreme punishment, such as honor killings.|$|E
25|$|On 10 August 1920 Grand Vizier Damat Ferid Pasha {{signed the}} Treaty of Sèvres, which {{finalized}} {{the plans for}} the partitioning of Ottoman Empire including what Turkish nationals accepted as their heartland.

Kemal Insisted on complete independence and the safeguarding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> the Turkish majority on Turkish soil. The acceptance of treaty and the following events weakened the legitimacy of the Sultan's government in Istanbul, and caused a shift of power in favour of the GNA in Ankara.|$|E

25|$|The {{prevalent}} {{nationalism in}} political circles {{was fueled by}} the large size of Poland's minority populations and their separate agendas. According to the language criterion of the Polish census of 1931, the Poles constituted 69% of the population, Ukrainians 15%, Jews (defined as speakers of the Yiddish language) 8.5%, Belarusians 4.7%, Germans 2.2%, Lithuanians 0.25%, Russians 0.25% and Czechs 0.09%, with some geographical areas dominated by a particular minority. In time, the ethnic conflicts intensified, and the Polish state grew less tolerant <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> its national minorities. In interwar Poland, compulsory free general education substantially reduced illiteracy rates, but discrimination was practiced {{in a way that}} resulted in a dramatic {{decrease in the number of}} Ukrainian language schools and official restrictions on Jewish attendance at selected schools in the late 1930s.|$|E
25|$|Stephenson and {{the other}} {{salesmen}} and office seekers who maneuvered for control of Indiana's Invisible Empire lacked both the ability {{and the desire to}} use the political system to carry out the Klan's stated goals. They were uninterested in, or perhaps even unaware of, grass roots concerns within the movement. For them, the Klan had been nothing more than a means for gaining wealth and power. These marginal men had risen {{to the top of the}} hooded order because, until it became a political force, the Klan had never required strong, dedicated leadership. More established and experienced politicians who endorsed the Klan, or who pursued some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> their Klan constituents, also accomplished little. Factionalism created one barrier, but many politicians had supported the Klan simply out of expedience. When charges of crime and corruption began to taint the movement, those concerned about their political futures had even less reason to work on the Klan's behalf.|$|E
25|$|Governor Grey had {{to contend}} with {{newspapers}} that were unequivocal to their support <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> the settlers: the Auckland Times, Auckland Chronicle, The Southern Cross, which started by William Brown as a weekly paper in 1843 and The New Zealander, which was started in 1845 by John Williamson. These newspapers were known for their partisan editorial policies – both William Brown and John Williamson were aspiring politicians. The Southern Cross supported the land claimants, such as the New Zealand Company, and vigorously attacked Governor Grey's administration, while The New Zealander, supported the ordinary settler and the Māori. The northern war adversely affected business in Auckland, such that The Southern Cross stopped publishing from April 1845 to July 1847. Hugh Carleton, who also became a politician, was the editor of The New Zealander then later established the Anglo-Maori Warder, which followed an editorial policy in opposition to Governor Grey.|$|E
