5|$|The <b>Olympic</b> <b>Movement</b> {{encompasses}} {{a large number}} of national and international sporting organisations and federations, recognised media partners, as well as athletes, officials, judges, and every other person and institution that agrees to abide by the rules of the Olympic Charter. As the umbrella organisation of the <b>Olympic</b> <b>Movement,</b> the International Olympic Committee (IOC) is responsible for selecting the host city, overseeing the planning of the Olympic Games, updating and approving the sports program, and negotiating sponsorship and broadcasting rights.|$|E
5|$|Although the Intercalated Games of 1906 are {{no longer}} {{considered}} official Games of the Olympiad by the IOC, they helped restore the <b>Olympic</b> <b>movement.</b> Participation at subsequent Games grew steadily, with 22 nations in London for 1908 and 28 nations in Stockholm for the 1912 Games.|$|E
5|$|National Olympic Committees (NOCs) {{represent}} {{and regulate}} the <b>Olympic</b> <b>Movement</b> within each country. For example, the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) is the NOC of the United States. There are currently 205 NOCs recognised by the IOC.|$|E
2500|$|Art {{competitions}} formed part of {{the modern}} Olympic Games during its early years, from 1912 to 1948.

5|$|Twenty-eight African {{countries}} boycotted these Games. This {{decision was}} taken {{in response to the}} participation of New Zealand, because its national rugby union team (the All Blacks) continued to play rugby with South Africa, which had been banned from the <b>Olympic</b> <b>movement</b> since 1964 due to its apartheid policies.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} IOC session in August 1972 in Munich {{at which the}} Rhodesians were excluded, the IOC elected Killanin as Brundage's successor, to take office after the Games. Brundage cast a blank ballot in the vote which {{selected}} the Irishman, considering him an intellectual lightweight without the force of character needed to hold the <b>Olympic</b> <b>movement</b> together.|$|E
5|$|In 1971, the IOC, at its Amsterdam session, {{voted to}} strip the South African NOC of recognition. Although Brundage had hoped to keep South Africa within the <b>Olympic</b> <b>movement,</b> he {{believed}} that those who sought its expulsion had made the stronger case. South Africa {{did not return to}} the Olympics until the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, after the end of its apartheid government.|$|E

5000|$|The {{primary concern}} of the Congress in Paris was the {{protection}} of the environment. The delegates focused on developing measures to optimise the <b>Olympic</b> <b>Movement’s</b> contribution to preserving the environment. The 1994 Congress was the first time members of the media were invited to speak and had an entire discussion theme devoted to their concerns. It was not surprising that this Congress was later entitled [...] "The Congress of Unity" [...] as the event was a testimony to the good relationship among the various constituents of the Olympic Family.|$|R
5|$|International Federations (IFs) are the {{governing}} bodies that supervise a sport {{at an international}} level.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} view that the <b>Olympic</b> Games <b>Movement</b> and the modern day Olympic Games while seeking to be a secular event is {{regarded}} by many participants and spectators as an event where they are able to demonstrate expressions of their religious faith. The first Olympic Games were staged in ancient Greece and they comprised a series of sporting events staged as a way of honouring the Greek God; Zeus, considered by the Romans to be a pagan god. The origins and mythology surrounding the early Olympic Games had a non-secular basis and led to an almost intrinsic belief that to attend the Olympic Games was a way of undertake a sporting pilgrimage to affirm one’s faith and to give praise to one’s God. The aim {{of this paper is to}} examine the relevant beliefs and values associated with one of the World’s fastest growing religions Islam, which has over 1. 5 billion worshippers worldwide, and the challenges these beliefs and values may present to the <b>Olympic</b> Games <b>Movement</b> and future host cities. The context for this examination is that the <b>Olympic</b> Games <b>Movement</b> is seeking to engage and encourage greater numbers o...|$|R
5|$|Baron Pierre De Coubertin {{stepped down}} {{as head of the}} <b>Olympic</b> <b>Movement</b> after 1925 and with his {{departure}} the sport lost one of its major advocates. In 1928 the IOC turned down a request to stage rugby at the Amsterdam games. An exhibition tournament was held at the 1936 Berlin Games, with France, Germany, Italy and Romania competing. In what was, to date, the last rugby match played at the Olympics, France beat Germany in the final 19 to 14.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{retirement}} from athletics, Brundage became a sports administrator, rising rapidly {{through the ranks}} in United States sports groups. As leader of America's Olympic organizations, he fought zealously against a boycott of the 1936 Summer Olympics, which had been awarded to Germany before the rise of its Nazi government and its subsequent, escalating persecution of Jews. Although Brundage was successful in getting a team to the Games in Berlin, its participation was controversial and has remained so. Brundage {{was elected to the}} IOC that year, and quickly became a major figure in the <b>Olympic</b> <b>movement.</b> He was elected IOC president in 1952.|$|E
5|$|French and English are the {{official}} languages of the <b>Olympic</b> <b>Movement.</b> The other language used at each Olympic Games {{is the language}} of the host country (or languages, if a country has more than one official language apart from French or English). Every proclamation (such as the announcement of each country during the parade of nations in the opening ceremony) is spoken in these three (or more) languages, or the main two depending on whether the host country is an English or French speaking country.|$|E

500|$|The lack of Olympic {{recognition}} hampered the globalisation of {{the game}} in developing countries because the <b>Olympic</b> Solidarity <b>Movement</b> provides access to funding for these nations through the International Olympic Committee. In some countries, such as Tanzania, the lack of access to Olympic funding cut off other options such as funding by the British Council. With official recognition, funding from the IOC, the <b>Olympic</b> Solidarity <b>Movement</b> and the British Council became available to cover costs for travel to international competitions. For some nations, without that assistance, trying to maintain international calibre teams was difficult. Olympic recognition brought money for development into the sport. In 2004, IFNA received a grant of [...] from the IOC for development. IFNA was given an additional [...] a year until 2007 by the Association of IOC Recognised International Sports (ARISF).|$|R

5|$|A {{significant}} {{step in the}} process of acceptance back into the <b>Olympic</b> <b>Movement</b> was achieved at a ceremony held in Cardiff in November 1994, when the IRB was officially confirmed as a Recognised International Federation of the IOC. At that ceremony, International Olympic Committee President, Juan Antonio Samaranch, pointed out that rugby's history and values were very much in tune with the Olympic philosophy and traditions. This historic meeting in Cardiff led to IRB representation at annual IOC meetings and consideration for inclusion in the programme of future Olympic Games. In 2002, a plan was presented to induct rugby sevens, golf and the Chinese martial art of wushu.|$|E
5|$|Brundage, {{through his}} tenure, slowly {{came around to}} the {{position}} advocated by Iron Curtain IOC members, that the important thing was to recognize the mainland, with Taiwan of less importance. Although the mainland Chinese were invited by the Munich Olympic organizers to send an observer delegation to Munich (they declined due to the Taiwanese presence), {{it was not until}} 1975, after Brundage's departure as president, that the PRC applied to rejoin the <b>Olympic</b> <b>movement.</b> The PRC again participated at the 1980 Winter Games at Lake Placid and then the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles; the island NOC competed as the Republic of China in 1968 and 1972; when refused permission to compete under that name in 1976, after Brundage's death, it boycotted the 1976 and 1980 games, returning in 1984 as Chinese Taipei.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, the Brundage-headed IOC, in {{a narrow}} vote, {{recognized}} both committees, thus allowing both states to participate at Melbourne. Only the PRC's committee initially accepted, but when the Taiwanese NOC changed its mind and decided to send a team to the Games, the mainlanders withdrew in protest. Brundage took the position that despite similar concerns about state sponsorship as with the USSR, once the PRC's committee was recognized and reported to the IOC that all eligibility rules were observed, the international committee had to accept that unless it had evidence to the contrary. He was frustrated by the continuing controversy, considering the squabble a distraction from the goal of advancing the <b>Olympic</b> <b>movement.</b>|$|E

40|$|Contemporary Western {{society has}} an {{abundant}} variety of role models, with celebrities {{from all walks}} of life replacing yesteryear's role models of military heroes and political leaders. However, sport has long provided religious and secular role models dating back to the ancient Olympic Games, and today every two years with the celebration of the summer and winter Olympics, more names are added to the Olympic pantheon of heroes. There is already a discrete acknowledged body of literature investigating celebrity sports men and women. This article draws on this literature speci?cally examining modern secular pilgrimage to sport celebrities, focusing on those who achieve fame and glory on the Olympic victory dais, but also those whose behaviour has led to their expulsion from Olympia. We suggest that because of the <b>Olympic</b> <b>Movement's</b> philosophy of Olympism, it is different from other non-Olympic af?liated sporting organisations, and the price for transgression on and off the playing ?eld can be higher.
