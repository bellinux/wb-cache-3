40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to define the added value <b>of</b> <b>facility</b> {{management}} (FM) in general and to develop a typology <b>of</b> <b>facility</b> services based on their added value in the educational environment. Design/methodology/approach – This paper is based on a literature review and first assesses the different aspects of FM added value. The different variables and relations between the use <b>of</b> <b>facility</b> services and their effects on the educational achievement are then conceptualised and studied. Findings – Research shows that FM added value is the customer perceived trade-off between the effects of the use <b>of</b> <b>facility</b> services on the outcome of their processes, its costs and risks. On this basis, a typology <b>of</b> <b>facility</b> services was constructed around their level of fixity and their influence on the learning outcome. Practical implications – The typology strongly indicates for FM when to engage in the decision-making process relating to the educational environment in order to contribute to education. Also the typology is useful for deriving priorities for adjusting the current use situation <b>of</b> <b>facility</b> services to enhance their effectiveness in both a time and financially efficient manner. Originality/value – This paper operationalises the concept of FM added value and provides several hypotheses and firm recommendations for further research to maximise the contribution of FM. The paper also presents a practical framework for evidenced-based decision making on the use <b>of</b> <b>facility</b> services in the educational environment. It thus offers opportunities for FM to support the future learning landscap...|$|R
5|$|Australia {{played a}} minor {{role in the}} Japan {{campaign}} in {{the last months of}} the war and was preparing to participate in the invasion of Japan at the time the war ended. Several Australian warships operated with the British Pacific Fleet (BPF) during the Battle of Okinawa and Australian destroyers later escorted British aircraft carriers and battleships during attacks on targets in the Japanese home islands.

5|$|Bruntwood Park has {{a variety}} <b>of</b> <b>facilities,</b> {{including}} orienteering, an 18-hole, par 3 pitch and putt golf course, children's play areas, football pitches, and a BMX track.

Bruntwood Park is a Grade B Site of Biological Interest, and in 1999 was given a Green Flag Award for its high standards. The land it occupies was once a large estate, which at one time included a stud farm. Bruntwood Hall, a Victorian Gothic building constructed in 1861, has been used for various purposes, including serving as Cheadle and Gatley Town Hall from 1944 until 1959. It is now used as offices, and since the 1940s the park has been open to the public.|$|E

5|$|Detachments from 5ACS formed part of Australia's {{contribution}} to the Vietnam War. Following the deployment of No.79 Squadron to Ubon Air Force Base in Thailand in June 1962, a party of 5ACS personnel was also sent to Ubon to plan and oversee the construction <b>of</b> <b>facilities</b> for the squadron. Work on these facilities was undertaken by 100 Thai civilians who had built over 50 huts and other support infrastructure for No.79 Squadron {{by the time the}} project concluded at the end of 1962. RAAF units began to be deployed to South Vietnam in 1964, and in May 1966 DetachmentA of 5ACS was formed at Vũng Tàu to improve the airfield there so it could support the UH-1 Iroquois-equipped No. 9 Squadron. The 19 members of this detachment returned to Australia on 8October 1966. DetachmentB of 5ACS was subsequently deployed to South Vietnam in January 1967 to build facilities for eight No.2 Squadron Canberra bombers at Phan Rang Air Base. This task was completed in April, and in June DetachmentB moved to Vũng Tàu to complete the construction <b>of</b> <b>facilities</b> there. Work on Vũng Tàu Airport was finished on 20January 1968 and the detachment was disbanded on 17February 1968.|$|E

Surplus military airfields were closed, and in some cases, for example Beccles, subsequently re-opened as civil aerodromes.
