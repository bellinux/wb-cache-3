5|$|Centralized {{artillery}} {{command and}} control. Since {{the end of}} World War I, German divisions had had their artillery spread out amongst their component regiments, which {{made it difficult to}} bring the maximum weight of fire to bear <b>on</b> <b>any</b> <b>one</b> point.

President Truman boarded on 2 September to {{celebrate}} {{the signing of the}} Rio Treaty, which broadened the Monroe Doctrine by stipulating that an attack <b>on</b> <b>any</b> <b>one</b> of the signatory American countries would be considered an attack on all.|$|E
5|$|The campaign's {{ultimate}} limitation was {{the poor}} formulation of military strategy. The types of targets selected from one operation {{to the next}} differed radically and no sustained pressure was put <b>on</b> <b>any</b> <b>one</b> type of British target. The Luftwaffes strategy became increasingly aimless. Disputes among the OKL staff revolved more around tactics than strategy. This method condemned the offensive over Britain to failure before it had begun.|$|E

5|$|According to the classicist J. C. Stobart, Tiberius's Greek {{education}} had {{caused him to}} overestimate {{the reliability of the}} people as a powerbase, causing him to overplay his hand. In Rome, even when led by a bold Tribune the people lacked anywhere near the influence they enjoyed {{at the height of the}} Athenian polis. Another problem for Gaius's aims was that the Roman constitution, specifically the Tribal Assembly, was designed to prevent any one individual governing for a sustained period of time â€“ and there were several other checks and balances to prevent power being concentrated <b>on</b> <b>any</b> <b>one</b> person. Stobart adds that another reason for the efforts' failures was the Gracchi's idealism; they were deaf to the baser notes of human nature and failed to recognize how corrupt and selfish all sections of Roman society had become.|$|E
5|$|And the Mountains Echoed is {{the third}} novel by Afghan-American author Khaled Hosseini. Published in 2013 by Riverhead Books, it {{deviates}} from Hosseini's style {{in his first two}} works through his choice to avoid focusing <b>on</b> <b>any</b> <b>one</b> character. Rather, the book is written similarly to a collection of short stories, with each of the nine chapters being told {{from the perspective of a}} different character. The book's foundation is built on the relationship between ten-year-old Abdullah and his three-year-old sister Pari and their father's decision to sell her to a childless couple in Kabul, an event that ties the various narratives together.|$|E
5|$|As a scientist, Oppenheimer {{is remembered}} by his {{students}} and colleagues {{as being a}} brilliant researcher and engaging teacher who was the founder of modern theoretical physics in the United States. Because his scientific attentions often changed rapidly, he never worked long enough <b>on</b> <b>any</b> <b>one</b> topic and carried it to fruition to merit the Nobel Prize, although his investigations contributing {{to the theory of}} black holes may have warranted the prize had he lived long enough to see them brought into fruition by later astrophysicists. An asteroid, 67085 Oppenheimer, was named in his honor, as was the lunar crater Oppenheimer.|$|E

5|$|Hopton {{arrived on}} 27 November, given by King Charles 1,580 horse, but only around 2,000 conscripted {{infantry}} and 500 troops {{recently returned from}} fighting in Munster, Ireland. Hopton had been ordered in late September to make secure Dorset, Wiltshire and Hampshire, and to push {{as far as possible}} toward London. Toward this end, Hopton spread his men across Hampshire County, quartering them for the winter at Winchester, Alresford, Petersfield and Alton. He did so to alleviate the burden <b>on</b> <b>any</b> <b>one</b> town, and because winter was approaching quickly. However, this left his army vulnerable. Hopton placed Crawford in charge of Alton, and on 1 December Crawford began to fortify the small town as quickly as he could. Crawford had at his disposal one cavalry regiment and one infantry regiment, though his exact number of men is unknown; it was likely around 1,000.|$|E
5|$|In his Botanical Gardens and Botanical Literature in the Eighteenth Century (1961), Stearn {{provides}} {{some insight into}} his interpretation of botanical history: The progress of botany, as of other sciences, comes from the interaction of so many factors that undue emphasis <b>on</b> <b>any</b> <b>one</b> can give a very distorted impression of the whole, but certainly {{among the most important}} of these for any given period are the prevailing ideas and intellectual attitudes, the assumptions and stimuli of the time, for often upon them depends the extent to which a particular study attracts an unbroken succession of men of industry and originality intent on building a system of knowledge and communicating it successfully to others of like mind.|$|E
5|$|Sycamore {{trees are}} very {{variable}} across their wide range and have strategies to prevent self-pollination, which is undesirable because it limits the genetic {{variation of the}} progeny and may depress their vigour. Most inflorescences are formed of a mixture of functionally male and functionally female flowers. <b>On</b> <b>any</b> <b>one</b> tree, one or other of these flower types opens first and the other type opens later. Some trees may be male-starters in one year and female-starters in another. The change from one sex to the other may take place on different dates {{in different parts of}} the crown, and different trees in any one population may come into bloom over the course of several weeks, so that cross-pollination is encouraged, although self-pollination may not be completely prevented.|$|E

5|$|The basic {{function}} of equipment in SaGa games {{is to increase}} character attributes. Arming a character with a gold helmet increases his or her base defense statistic, for example. The amount of equipment that can be placed <b>on</b> <b>any</b> <b>one</b> character at any time depends on the character's class. Humans can hold eight, mutants four, and monsters none. There are five types of armor: shields, helmets, breastplates, gauntlets, and shoes. Only one of each at a time may be added to one character and cannot be added to monsters. Weapons, consisting of swords, hammers, whips, spell books, and guns, utilize either the strength, agility or mana attribute of a character, {{and can be used}} only a certain number of times before breaking and being removed from the player's inventory. Shields can be used as items in combat, most with a limited number of uses, and allow the user to evade enemy attacks.|$|E
5|$|The first British {{attack on}} Nalapani {{took place on}} 31 October, a day before the {{official}} declaration of war. Gillespie planned to storm the fort from four sides. The storming party was formed into four columns, support by a reserve: the first, under Colonel Carpenter, consisted of 611 men; the second, under Captain Fast, was 363 strong; the third, under Major Kelly, {{was made up of}} 541 men; the fourth, under Captain Campbell, had 283 men; while 939 men made up the reserve, under Major Ludlow. It was intended for these columns to ascend from different points, at a signal made through the guns firing in a specific manner, and thus attack the Nepalese from different sides. In doing so, the British hoped to divert the attention of the Nepalese and prevent them from concentrating their fire <b>on</b> <b>any</b> <b>one</b> point, allowing the attackers to gain an advantage.|$|E
5|$|Trew {{contends that}} the capture of {{northern}} Caen had a psychological impact on the French population, convincing them the Allies were there to stay and that the liberation of France could not be far off. By Operation Charnwood's conclusion, Allied losses since 6 June had amounted to over 30,000 men, excluding {{those who had been}} evacuated due to sickness and those suffering from battle exhaustion. Buckley believes Charnwood to have been a good idea but one that proved better in concept than in execution, influenced as it was by the mounting political pressure on 21st Army Group to produce results. Copp wrote that the broad-based assault plan across the entire front worked, preventing the Germans bringing to bear superior firepower <b>on</b> <b>any</b> <b>one</b> formation.|$|E

25|$|Their tactic was {{to advance}} {{simultaneously}} {{from all sides}} targeting a single central objective.

This would also prevent any of the Quresh from escaping.|$|E
