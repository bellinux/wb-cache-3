5|$|Although the {{presence}} of an embryo per se would be equivocal regarding this issue, the conditions in which the embryo were preserved provide strong evidence that Dinocephalosaurus was viviparous. There is no preserved calcified eggshell surrounding the embryo, despite {{the presence}} of delicately-preserved calcified elements from other animals at Luoping. This is consistent with the eggshells surrounding the embryos of viviparous reptiles being non-calcified membranes. Furthermore, the relative proportions of the humerus and the fibula in the embryo, compared with the maternal individual and IVPP V13898 from Panxian, indicate that the embryo is around 12% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> of its mother. Combined with its ossified bones, this suggests that the embryo was at an advanced developmental stage, whereas crocodilians, birds, turtles, and tuataras lay eggs at very early developmental stages.|$|E
5|$|American {{officials}} {{decided to}} release the prisoners after a few weeks. First, however, the Natives were required to visit several large U.S. cities on the east coast. This was a tactic often used when Native American leaders came to the East, because {{it was thought that}} a demonstration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> and power of the United States would discourage future resistance to U.S. expansion. Beginning on June 4, 1833, Black Hawk and his companions were taken on a tour of Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York City. They attended dinners and plays, and were shown a battleship, various public buildings, and a military parade. Huge crowds gathered to see them. Black Hawk's handsome son Nasheweskaska (Whirling Thunder) was a particular favorite. Reaction in the west, however, was less welcoming. When the prisoners traveled through Detroit on their way home, one crowd burned and hanged effigies of the Indians.|$|E

5|$|Andromeda {{is one of}} the 48 constellations {{listed by}} the 2nd-century Greco-Roman {{astronomer}} Ptolemy and remains one of the 88 modern constellations. Located north of the celestial equator, it is named for Andromeda, daughter of Cassiopeia, in the Greek myth, who was chained to a rock to be eaten by the sea monster Cetus. Andromeda is most prominent during autumn evenings in the Northern Hemisphere, along with several other constellations named for characters in the Perseus myth. Because of its northern declination, Andromeda is visible only north of 40° south latitude; for observers farther south it lies below the horizon. It {{is one of the}} largest constellations, with an area of 722 square degrees. This is over 1,400 times the size of the full moon, 55% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> of the largest constellation, Hydra, and over 10 times the size of the smallest constellation, Crux.|$|E
5|$|As news of an {{impending}} raid {{spread across the}} state, Governor Oliver P. Morton called out the state's militia force, the Indiana Legion, to defend against the threat. Unaware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> of the invading army, four companies of the 6th and 8th Regiments of the Legion, totaling about one hundred men, attempted to prevent the Confederates from crossing the Ohio River into Indiana, but were overcome by superior artillery fire, killing two of the defenders. The units retreated northward where they met with {{the main body of}} the 6th Regiment under the command of Col. Lewis Jordan. Along with the townspeople, they constructed breastworks that formed a defensive line south of Corydon. Despite promises of reinforcements from regional Legion commanders in New Albany, only about 450 men (consisting almost entirely of locals) were defending the town.|$|E
5|$|At the time, John was in {{south-east}} England recruiting mercenaries {{in preparation}} for his war with the barons.

Estimates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> of Rochester's garrison vary, with the chroniclers' figures ranging from 95 to 140knights, supported by crossbowmen, sergeants, and others. Hearing {{the news that the}} city was in enemy hands, John immediately rode to Rochester and arrived on 13October. Royal forces had arrived ahead of John and entered the city on 11October, taking it by surprise and laying siege to the castle. Rochester bridge was pulled down to prevent the arrival of a relief force from London. The siege that followed was the largest in England up to that point, and would take nearly two months.|$|E

5|$|By mid-1943, it {{had become}} clear that the initial {{estimates}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> of the town had been too low, and a second phase of construction was required. Plans now called for a town of 42,000 people. Work began {{in the fall of}} 1943, and continued into the late summer of 1944. Hospitals were expanded, as were the police and fire services, and the telephone system. Only 4,793 of a planned total of 6,000 family houses were built, mostly on the East Town area and the undeveloped stretch along State Route 61. They were supplemented by 55 new dormitories, 2,089 trailers, 391 hutments, a cantonment area of 84 hutments and 42 barracks. Some 2,823 of the family units were prefabricated off-site. The high school was expanded to cater for 1,000 students. Two additional primary schools were built, and existing ones were expanded so that they could accommodate 7,000 students.|$|E
5|$|Derek da Cunha has {{proposed}} that the law of large numbers favours the GRC system. According to the theory, {{the large number of}} voters from GRC wards generally, though not necessarily always, reflects the popular vote. This was evident at the 2006 elections, at which the PAP garnered an average of 67.04% of the votes in a contested GRC, while the average was 61.67% for a SMC ward. The national average for the 2006 elections was 66.6%. Similar trends can be seen from previous elections. In fact, the percentage difference in the PAP votes between SMCs and GRCs grew from 3% in 1991, and remained stable at around 5% in the 1997, 2001 and 2006 elections. This may be attributable to the enlargement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> of GRCs in 1997 which gave greater effect to the law of large numbers.|$|E

5|$|Former Polish {{estimates}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> of the Russian forces {{varied from}} 25,000 through 30,000 to 34,500, with 160 artillery pieces. Recent research on 17th-century Russian archive documents {{showed that the}} size of the Russian army was 23,961. Compared to former Russian armies, Shein's army was significantly modernised. Dissatisfied with their traditional formations of musket-equipped infantry (the streltsy), the Russians looked to foreign officers to update the equipment and training of their troops based on the Western European model of regulars, dragoons, and reiters. Eight such regiments, totaling 14,000 to 17,000 men, comprised part of Shein's army.|$|E
5|$|Having settled {{matters in}} Khurasan, Harun {{returned}} to the west in November 805 and prepared a huge retaliatory expedition for 806, drawing men from Syria, Palestine, Persia, and Egypt. According to al-Tabari, his army numbered 135,000 regular troops and additional volunteers and freebooters. These numbers—and the even more fantastic claims of the Byzantine chronicler Theophanes the Confessor of 300,000 men—are easily the largest ever recorded for the entire Abbasid era and {{far more than the}} estimated strength of the entire Byzantine army. Although they are certainly exaggerated, they are nevertheless indicative <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> of the Abbasid force.

5|$|In 2011, Ryan Schott {{and colleagues}} made a more {{comprehensive}} analysis of cranial dome ontogeny in S. validum. The {{study found that the}} parietosquamosal shelf conserved the arrangement of ornamentation throughout growth, and that vascularity of the frontoparietal domes decreased with size. It also found that dome shape and size was strongly correlated with growth, and that growth was allometric (in contrast to isometric) from flat to domed, supporting Ornatotholus as a juvenile Stegoceras. They also hypothesized that this model of dome growth, with dramatic changes from juvenile to adult, was the common developmental trajectory of pachycephalosaurs. These researchers noted that though Williamson and Carr's observation that the supratemporal fenestrae closed with age was generally correct, there was still a high degree of individual variation in the size of these fenestrae, regardless <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> of the frontoparietal, and this feature may therefore have been independent of ontogeny.|$|E
