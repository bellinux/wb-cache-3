At the end, the couple attend a concert at Carnegie Hall where the boyfriend is angered to notice part of Mann's rattail sticking {{out from under her}} cap.

500|$|Steve Kloves was {{selected}} to write the screenplay. He described adapting the book as [...] "tough", as it did not [...] "lend itself to adaptation {{as well as the}} next two books."

2500|$|In early July 2006, {{when asked}} if he would debate Owens, he said he [...] "wouldn't debate her on how to bake a {{chocolate}} cake."

[...] Later, in an on-air interview with reporter Tyler Evans of local news station News Channel 8, he further commented: [...] "She's got these long clothes on and an old-fashioned hairdo. [...] You know it sort of makes you real mad." [...] On September 8, 2006, another local news station, WUSA9, showed an off-screen reporter asking him, [...] "Did you call her an Old Mother Hubbard?" [...] to which he responded, [...] "Well, what does she look like? ... Old-fashioned hairdo; long dress ... If I lose or win – whatever I do – I'm gonna send her some Style magazines."

[...] Asked about his heated exchanges with Owens, Schaefer said, [...] "This was started not by me." [...] He added, [...] "There's dirty politics, and then there's filthy politics." ...|$|E
