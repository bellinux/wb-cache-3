5|$|With Brownlee as premier and Reid as Provincial Treasurer, {{government}} deficits ceased: {{the budget}} showed a surplus in {{every year from}} 1925 until 1930, except for 1927. In 1929, Reid predicted that Alberta was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cusp</b> of a period of economic expansion; instead, he was soon confronted with the Great Depression. He drastically cut provincial spending and raised taxes, in part by creating a new income tax. He reluctantly accepted that these measures could not prevent a return to deficit spending. His willingness to outspend revenues was due less to any Keynesian desire {{to stimulate the economy}} than to a belief that there was no further spending to be cut or further taxes that could reasonably be raised. Conversely, he rejected calls from the opposition Liberals to cut taxes as a stimulus measure.|$|E

Solskjær put United two goals ahead, but in the 39th minute Gary Neville received a red card for a second bookable offence, tugging on David Ginola's shirt. Spurs captain Sol Campbell brought his team back into the match with 20 minutes remaining and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cusp</b> of stoppage time powered a header in the top left-hand corner, sparking jubilant scenes at White Hart Lane.

25|$|Extraordinary {{sporting}} successes {{did something}} to alleviate the spirits of Australians during the economic downturn. In a Sheffield Shield cricket match at the Sydney Cricket Ground in 1930, Don Bradman, a young New South Welshman of just 21 years of age wrote his name into the record books by smashing the previous highest batting score in first-class cricket with 452 runs not out in just 415 minutes. The rising star's world beating cricketing exploits were to provide Australians with much needed joy through the emerging Great Depression in Australia and post-World War II recovery. Between 1929 and 1931 the racehorse Phar Lap dominated Australia's racing industry, at one stage winning fourteen races in a row. Famous victories included the 1930 Melbourne Cup, following an assassination attempt and carrying 9 stone 12 pounds weight. Phar Lap sailed for the United States in 1931, going on to win North America's richest race, the Agua Caliente Handicap in 1932. Soon after, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cusp</b> of US success, Phar Lap developed suspicious symptoms and died.

40|$|We review five {{often used}} quad lens models, {{each of which}} has {{analytical}} solutions and can produce four images at most. Each lens model has two parameters, including one that describes the intensity of non-dimensional mass density, and the other one that describes the deviation from the circular lens. In our recent work, we have found that <b>the</b> <b>cusp</b> and <b>the</b> fold summations are not equal to 0, when a point source infinitely approaches a cusp or a fold from inner side of <b>the</b> caustic. Based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> magnification invariant theory, which states that the sum of signed magnifications of the total images of a given source is a constant, we calculate <b>the</b> <b>cusp</b> summations for <b>the</b> five lens models.
