40|$|<b>Current</b> <b>transfer</b> {{behaviour}} in anisotropic superconducting bodies is {{the central}} topic of this thesis and focuses on {{the effect that the}} nonlinearity of the electric field dependence upon the local current density value and anisotropy have on the nature of current transport. The main motivation for this work was the desire for {{a better understanding of the}} conceptually difficult behaviour of current transport in superconducting bodies and examines <b>current</b> <b>transfer</b> quantitatively for a number of important problems on the macroscopic and microscopic scale. This behaviour is examined both experimentally and using computer models. The successful development of a powerful, robust and adaptable numerical model for analysing the complex <b>current</b> <b>transfer</b> behaviour has been the primary aim of this work. The range of parameters appropriate to macroscopic models of the Bi- 2212 CRT system has been experimentally examined using a specifically constructed apparatus for the measurement of current transport characteristics. A study of the self-field properties of the Bi- 2212 CRT material using a new experimental technique and mathematical analysis is presented and has allowed the importance of the self-field effect in the numerical model to be assessed. An essential requirement for the practical application of high current superconducting devices is the development of low resistance current contacts. The research presented examines this macroscopic <b>current</b> <b>transfer</b> problem and aims to explain experimentally observed <b>current</b> <b>transfer</b> characteristics at high applied currents. Existing models cannot explain these characteristics. <b>Current</b> <b>transfer</b> on the microscopic scale is also examined. Models of <b>current</b> <b>transfer</b> have been developed from descriptions of specific microstructures that are thought to characterise the microstructure of Bi- 2223 and Bi- 2212 silver-sheathed tapes.

40|$|According to the disciplining hypothesis, {{globalization}} restrains governments by inducing increased budgetary pressure. As a consequence, governments {{shift their}} expenditures {{in favour of}} transfers and subsidies and away from capital expenditures. This expenditure shift is potentially enhanced by citizens' preferences to be compensated for the risks of globalization (compensation hypothesis). Employing two different datasets and various measures of globalization, we analyze whether globalization has indeed influenced the composition of government expenditures. For a sample of 108 countries, we examine the development of four broad expenditure categories for the period 1970 - 2001 : capital expenditures; expenditures for goods and services; interest payments; and subsidies and <b>other</b> <b>current</b> <b>transfers.</b> A second dataset provides a much more detailed classification: public expenditures, expenditures for defence, order, economic environment, housing, health, recreation, education, and social expenditures.

The <b>current</b> <b>transfer</b> length was investigated on two different multi-filamentary Nb 3 Sn wires and one NbTi wire.

Author Summary: Neurons take a great variety of shapes that allow them to perform their different computational roles across the brain. The most distinctive visible feature of many neurons is the extensively branched network of cable-like projections that make up their dendritic tree. A neuron receives current-inducing synaptic contacts from other cells across its dendritic tree. As in the case of botanical trees, dendritic trees are strongly tapered towards their tips. This tapering has previously been shown to offer a number of advantages over a constant width, both in terms of reduced energy requirements and the robust integration of inputs at different locations. However, in order to predict the computations that neurons perform, analytical solutions for the flow of input currents tend to assume constant dendritic diameters. Here we introduce an asymptotic approximation that accurately models the <b>current</b> <b>transfer</b> in dendritic trees with arbitrary, continuously changing, diameters. When we then determine the diameter profiles that maximise <b>current</b> <b>transfer</b> towards the cell body we find diameters similar to those observed in real neurons. We conclude that the tapering in dendritic trees to optimise signal transmission is a fundamental architectural principle of the brain...|$|R
