This paper introduces a novel approach to rendering of high-quality shadows in real-time. The contemporary approach to shadow rendering in real-time is shadow maps algorithm. The standard shadow maps suffer from discretization and aliasing due to the limited resolution of the shadow texture. Moreover, <b>omnidirectional</b> <b>lights</b> need additional treatment to work correctly, e. g. with dual-paraboloid shadow maps. We propose a new technique that significantly reduces the aliasing problem and works correctly for various kinds of light sources. Our technique adapts the light’s field-of-view to the visible part of the scene and thus stores only the relevant part of the scene to the full resolution of the shadow map. It produces high-quality shadows which are not constrained by position or type of the light sources and also works in fully dynamic scenes. The paper describes the new approach, presents some results, and discusses the potential and features of the approach. ...|$|R

In this course on how shadows are incorporated in real-time rendering, attendees learn basic shadowing techniques and more advanced techniques that exploit new features of graphics hardware. The course begins with shadowing techniques using shadow maps. After an introduction to shadow maps and general improvements of this technique (filtering, depth bias, <b>omnidirectional</b> <b>lights,</b> etc.), the first section describes two methods for reducing sampling artifacts: perspective shadow maps and silhouette maps. Both techniques can significantly improve shadow quality, but they require careful implementation. The course continues with extensions of the shadow mapping method that allow soft shadows from linear and area light sources. The second part of the course discusses recent advances in efficient and robust implementation of shadow volumes on graphics hardware and then shows how shadow volumes can be extended to generate accurate soft shadows from area lights. Finally, the course summarizes real-time shadowing from full lighting environments using the technique of precomputed radiance transfer. The course explains the differences among these algorithms and their strengths and weaknesses. Implementation details, often omitted in technical papers, are provided. And throughout the course, the tradeoffs between quality and performance are illustrated for the different techniques...|$|R
40|$|International audienceRecent {{advances}} in GPU technology {{have produced a}} shift in focus for real-time rendering applications, whereby improvements in image quality are sought in addition to raw polygon display performance. Rendering effects such as antialiasing, motion blur and shadow casting are becoming commonplace and will likely be considered indispensable in the near future. The last complete and famous survey on shadow algorithms -Woo, 1990 - has to be updated in particular in view of recent improvements in graphics hardware, which make new algorithms possible. This STAR covers all current methods for real-time shadow rendering, without venturing into slower, high quality techniques based on ray casting or radiosity. Shadows are useful {{for a variety of}} reasons: first, they help understand relative object placement in a 3 D scene by providing visual cues. Second, they dramatically improve image realism and allow the creation of complex lighting ambiances. Depending on the application, the emphasis is placed on a guaranteed framerate, or on the visual quality of the shadows including penumbra effects or ``soft shadows''. Obviously no single method can render physically correct soft shadows in real-time for any dynamic scene! However our survey aims at providing an exhaustive study allowing a programmer to choose the best compromise for his/her needs. In particular we discuss the advantages, limitations, rendering quality and cost of each algorithm. Recommendations are included based on simple characteristics of the application such as static/moving lights, single or multiple light sources, static/dynamic geometry, geometric complexity, directed or <b>omnidirectional</b> <b>lights,</b> etc. Finally we indicate which methods can efficiently exploit the most recent graphics hardware facilities...|$|R
40|$|In the {{following}} work {{we present a}} system for capturing ambient light in a real scene and recreating it in a room equipped with computer-controlled lamps. We capture incident light in one point of a scene with a simple light probe consisting of a camera and a reflective sphere. The acquired environment map is then transferred to a room where an approximated lighting condition is recreated with multiple LED lamps. To achieve this, we first measure the impact each lamp has on the illumination with a light probe and acquire one image per lamp. A linear combination of these images produces a new environment map, which we can recreate inside the room by setting the intensities of the lamps. We employ Quadratic Programming to find the linear combination that approximates a given environment map best. We speed up the optimization process by downsampling the light probe data, which reduces the dimension of our problem. Our method is fast enough for real-time light transfer and works with all types of linear controlled illuminants. In order to evaluate our method, we designed and constructed an <b>omnidirectional</b> <b>lighting</b> system that can spatially illuminate a room in full-color. We first explore several different configurations of our lighting system, our sampling and our optimization algorithm.

Furthermore, the stress-relieving honeycomb pattern within the photodiode micromembranes provided photodetectors with excellent mechanical flexibility (10 % decrease in photocurrent at a bending radius of 3 mm) and durability (minimal change in photocurrent over 10, 000 bending cycles).

The pigment deficient mutants (w a, w) are less sensitive to the pattern contrast in the bright adapted state, and {{more sensitive to the}} flash intensity in the dark adapted state than either the wild-type (+) or the overpigmented mutant(se). These differences are complementary and {{can be explained by the}} increased translucency of the pigment cells.

40|$|The {{construction}} of Grand Coulee and Chief Joseph dams on the Columbia River {{resulted in the}} complete extirpation of the anadromous fishery upstream of these structures. Today, this area is totally dependent upon resident fish resources to support local fisheries. The resident fishing is enhanced by an extensive stocking program for target species in the existing fishery, including kokanee (Oncorhynchus nerka kennerlyi) and rainbow trout (O. mykiss). The kokanee fishery in Lake Roosevelt has not been meeting the return goals set by fisheries managers despite the stocking program. Investigations of physical and biological factors that could affect the kokanee population found predation and entrainment {{had a significant impact}} on the fish population. In 1999 and 2000, walleye (Sander vitreum) consumed between 15 % and 9 %, respectively, of the hatchery kokanee within 41 days of their release, while results from a study in the late 1990 s estimated that entrainment at Grand Coulee Dam could account for up to 30 % of the total mortality of the stocked fish. To address the entrainment loss, the Bonneville Power Administration commissioned a study to determine if fish would avoid areas illuminated by strobe lights in the forebay of the third powerplant. This work was conducted by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) in conjunction with the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation (Colville Confederated Tribes). From 2002 through 2004, six strobe lights were suspended in the center of the opening to the third powerplant forebay during summer months. Results from those studies indicated that fish appeared to be attracted to the illuminated area but only at night and when flow conditions within the third powerplant forebay were minimal. However, small but consistent results from these studies indicated that under high flow conditions, fish might be avoiding the lights. The 2005 study was designed to examine whether, under high flow conditions near the penstock openings, fish would avoid the <b>lighted</b> regions. Four <b>omnidirectional</b> strobe <b>lights</b> were deployed on the one trash rack directly in front of one turbine penstock. Seven splitbeam transducers were deployed to monitor fish approaching three penstock openings either from in front of the trash racks or moving down the dam behind the trash racks. Four key results emerged from the 2005 study. The results provide insight into the current level of entrainment and how fish respond to strobe lights under high flow conditions. First, very few fish were detected inside the trash racks. Of the more than 3, 200 targets identified by the data processing, less than 100 were detected inside the trash racks. Only 23 fish were found inside the trash racks behind the strobe lights. Of those 21 fish, 13 were detected when the lights were on. Most of the fish detected behind the trash racks were above the turbine penstock but were headed downward. No fish were detected at night when minimal flows occurred between midnight and 4 : 00 a. m. Second, significantly more fish (P < 0. 001) were detected in front of the trash racks when the lights were on at night. On a count-per-hour basis, the difference between lights off and lights on was apparent in the early morning hours at depths between 25 m and 50 m from the transducers. The lights were approximately 34 m below the splitbeam transducers, and fish detected at night with lights on were found at a median depth of approximately 35 m, compared to a median depth of from 20. 6 to 23. 5 m when the lights were off. The differences in depth between lights on and off at night were also significant (P < 0. 001). Additionally, the increase in fish occurred only in front of the trash rack where the strobe lights were mounted; there was no increase in the number of detections by the transducers aimed away from the lights. Third, fish clearly manifested a behavioral response to the strobe lights during the day. When the lights were on, fish detected by three of the four transducers generally were swimming north, parallel to the face of the dam. However, the distribution of swimming directions for fish detected by the transducer immediately to the north of the lights was bimodal, with some fish swimming south toward the lighted region. This behavior was similar to that seen at night when the lights were on. Fourth, kokanee, rainbow trout, and walleye were detected near the strobe lights. Data were obtained from three sources: fish size from the hydroacoustic sensors and fish species from gill netting and video recording. Fish ranging in length from 30 to 600 mm (averaging 125 mm) were detected by the splitbeam transducers. There was little difference in target strength for fish detected above 25 m depth with respect to time of day or light treatment. Below 25 m and closer to the strobe lights, larger fish were present when the lights were on during the night, and smaller fish were present during the day...|$|R

Here we report that a delicate modification to the circular cross-section by eliminating a nanocrescent part can substantially strengthen the light-harvesting capability of a single nanowire. Despite the reduced photoactive material, the photocurrent density of the symmetry-broken crescent-deformed free-standing silicon single-nanowire solar cell can be counter-intuitively improved by over 45 %. The excellent light-harvesting ability of the crescent-deformed nanowire can be maintained over a broad spectral band at {{a wide range of}} incident angle as corroborated by its dispersion relation. Under assistance of a metallic back reflector, the photocurrent enhancement ratio can be up to 66. 2 % without taking into account the material reduction. Our electrical evaluation shows that the new design leads to an enhancement ratio of light-conversion efficiency by 40. 8 %. This novel design by breaking structure symmetry represents a new pathway to realize highly efficient and compact photovoltaic devices with <b>omnidirectional</b> <b>light</b> absorption enhancement.
