5|$|Henry begins time {{traveling}} {{at the age}} of five, jumping forward and backward relative to his own timeline. When he leaves, where he goes, <b>or</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> his trips will last are all beyond his control. His destinations are tied to his subconscious—he most often travels to places and times related to his own history. Certain stimuli such as stress can trigger Henry's time traveling; he often goes jogging to keep calm and remain in the present. He searches out pharmaceuticals in the future that may be able to help control his time traveling. He also seeks the advice of a geneticist, Dr. Kendrick. Henry cannot take anything with him into the future or the past; he always arrives naked and then struggles to find clothing, shelter, and food. He amasses a number of survival skills including lock-picking, self-defense, and pickpocketing. Much of this he learns from older versions of himself.|$|E
5|$|The recipes {{were often}} brief {{and did not}} give precise quantities. Cooking times and {{temperatures}} were seldom specified since accurate portable clocks were not available and since all cooking was done with fire. At best, cooking times could be specified as {{the time it took}} to say a certain number of prayers <b>or</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> it took to walk around a certain field. Professional cooks were taught their trade through apprenticeship and practical training, working their way up in the highly defined kitchen hierarchy. A medieval cook employed in a large household would most likely have been able to plan and produce a meal without the help of recipes or written instruction. Due to the generally good condition of surviving manuscripts it has been proposed by food historian Terence Scully that they were records of household practices intended for the wealthy and literate master of a household, such as the Ménagier de Paris from the late 14th century. Over 70 collections of medieval recipes survive today, written in several major European languages.|$|E

5|$|The {{underlying}} bedrock or limestone of the Everglades basin {{affects the}} hydroperiod, <b>or</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> an area {{within the region}} stays flooded throughout the year. Longer hydroperiods are possible in areas that were submerged beneath seawater {{for longer periods of}} time, while the geology of Florida was forming. More water is held within the porous ooids and limestone than older types of rock that spent more time above sea level. A hydroperiod of ten months or more fosters growth of sawgrass, whereas a shorter hydroperiod of six months or less promotes beds of periphyton, a growth of algae and other microscopic organisms. There are only two types of soil in the Everglades, peat and marl. Where there are longer hydroperiods, peat builds up over hundreds or thousands of years due to many generations of decaying plant matter. Where periphyton grows, the soil develops into marl, which is more calcitic in composition.|$|E
25|$|Little {{is known}} about the Gutian period, <b>or</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> it endured. Cuneiform sources suggest that the Gutians' {{administration}} showed little concern for maintaining agriculture, written records, or public safety; they reputedly released all farm animals to roam about Mesopotamia freely, and soon brought about famine and rocketing grain prices. The Sumerian king Ur-Nammu (2112–2095 BC) cleared the Gutians from Mesopotamia during his reign.|$|E
25|$|Half-life (symbol t1⁄2) is {{the time}} {{required}} for a quantity to reduce to half its initial value.

The term is also used more generally to characterize any type of exponential or non-exponential decay. For example, the medical sciences refer to the biological half-life of drugs and other chemicals in the human body. The converse of half-life is doubling time.|$|E

25|$|A {{man named}} Baker Pierce, {{who died in}} 1815, and whose remains were buried in the old pioneer {{graveyard}} at Osceola, {{appears to have been}} the first settler within the boundaries of Elkland borough. Just when he settled <b>or</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> he remained cannot now be ascertained, but it must have been during the earlier years of {{the first decade of the}} present century. The next to settle was the Taylor family, who located at Barney Hill. The family consisted of Mrs. Permelia Taylor and her three sons, Ebenezer, Philip and Mitchell, who emigrated from the Delaware Water Gap, New Jersey, to the Wyoming valley, thence to Pipe Creek, below Owego, from which place, in 1806, they came to the Cowanesque valley. Ebenezer and Philip soon afterward removed to Osceola. The latter, his mother and his brother, Mitchell, all died before 1815, and were buried at Barney Hill. In 1882, their resting place being disturbed by the building of the Addison and Pennsylvania railroad, Capt. Charles R. Taylor and Charles Tubbs—descendants in the fourth generation of Mrs. Permelia Taylor—removed their remains to the cemetery at Osceola.|$|E
500|$|The Act next {{establishes}} a uniform duty towards all lawful visitors, thus abolishing {{the distinction between}} contractors, invitees and licensees. Section 2 provides that the occupier extend a [...] "common duty of care" [...] to all lawful visitors, although it keeps the low duty of care towards unlawful visitors such as trespassers. This duty is described as [...] "a duty to take such care as in all {{the circumstances of the}} case is reasonable to see that the visitor will be reasonably safe in using the premises for the purposes for which he is invited or permitted by the occupier to be there". The Act allows the occupier to set limits on where the visitor is allowed to go <b>or</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> they are allowed to be there, an extension of the common law judgment made by Scrutton LJ in The Calgarth , when he said that [...] "when you invite a person into your house to use the staircase, you do not invite him to slide down the bannisters, you invite him to use the staircase in the ordinary way in which it is used".|$|E

500|$|The Supreme Court's {{decision}} to use Chevron as its test for reviewing the Treasury Department's decision for marked a departure from previous practice; the Court had the courts have previously given less deference to the Internal Revenue Service's statutory interpretations. According to {{an article in the}} Florida Tax Review, the Court in doing so [...] "unambiguously overruled" [...] its previous decision in the National Muffler in favor of Chevron, finding that an agency should have leeway in interpreting the statute in question, no matter when <b>or</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> ago the statute was placed in effect, how consistent the agency was in interpreting the statute, the importance of the statute or how closely Congress has looked into the agency's decision. However, an article in the George Washington Law Review which advocates {{for the use of the}} National Muffler standard in reviewing retroactive tax regulations (...) states that National Muffler may not have been entirely overruled, arguing that the Court implied that Chevron test is only to be used in [...] "complex questions of statutory interpretation" [...] and that the Court left open the possibility that a future scenario may warrant the use of the National Muffler test instead of the Chevron test.|$|E
2500|$|On 16 October 1888 {{a parcel}} {{containing}} half a human kidney {{accompanied by a}} note was received by George Lusk, Chairman of the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee. The note {{has become known as}} the [...] "Lusk letter" [...] or the [...] "From hell" [...] letter, because of a phrase [...] "from hell" [...] used by the writer, who claimed to have [...] "fried and ate" [...] the missing kidney half. The handwriting and style were unlike that of the [...] "Saucy Jacky" [...] postcard. The kidney was taken to Dr Thomas Horrocks Openshaw at the nearby London Hospital. He believed that the kidney was human, from the left side, and preserved in spirit. The Daily Telegraph reported on 19 October that {{he said it was a}} recent [...] "ginny kidney" [...] from a 45-year-old female, but in the Star newspaper the same day Openshaw denied the report strongly, saying it was impossible to tell its age or gender, <b>or</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> it had been preserved in spirits. Major Smith claimed in his memoirs that the sent kidney matched the one missing from Eddowes, because the length of renal artery attached to the kidney matched the missing length from the body, and both the body and kidney showed signs of Bright's disease. Smith's later recollection does not match the medical reports submitted by the examining pathologists or the police records. Police surgeon Dr Brown said that the kidney had been trimmed up, and that the renal artery was entirely absent. Metropolitan police memos state that the kidney could have come from any body, such as those found in a hospital morgue. Smith's story is thought by historians to be dramatic licence on his part, and the kidney could have been a medical student's prank. Dr Saunders, who attended the post-mortem, told the press, [...] "the right kidney of the woman Eddowes was perfectly normal in its structure and healthy... my opinion is that it was a student's antic." [...] Chief Inspector Donald Swanson, who co-ordinated the inquiry, wrote, [...] "similar kidneys might and could be obtained from any dead person upon whom a post mortem had been made for any cause, by students or dissecting room porter." ...|$|E
