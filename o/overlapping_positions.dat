50|$|From 1981 to 1982 Wolfowitz was {{appointed}} {{head of the}} policy planning staff in the State Department. In the same year Perle, who was an assistant secretary for international security policy in President Reagan’s defense department hired and promoted Douglas Feith {{after he had been}} fired from his position as a Middle East analyst at the National Security Council. Later it was found out that Feith was fired due to an FBI investigation suspecting that he had distributed confidential materials to an Israeli embassy official. With the right connections and support of his close allies Wolfowitz and Perle, Feith was able to attain the position of undersecretary for policy in the Pentagon in 2001 of which he resigned in 2005. In return, he appointed Perle as chairman of the Defense Policy Board. This friendship was mutually beneficial for both Perle and Feith who used their <b>overlapping</b> <b>positions</b> of power to help promote the other and bail each other out of trouble. Perle is nonetheless an inspiration and mentor to Feith who describes him as a “godfather” and trusts that “He would actively work to help anybody he had worked with and liked and admired and who he thought was useful to the overall cause of U.S. national security as he saw it.” Both Wolfowitz and Feith would eventually join forces and work closely together to promote the War in Iraq after 9/11, including heading the Office of Special Plans.|$|E

40|$|This article {{introduces}} a new computational {{model for the}} complex-span task, the most popular task for studying working memory. SOB-CS is a two-layer neural network that associates distributed item representations with distributed, <b>overlapping</b> <b>position</b> markers. Memory capacity limits are explained by interference from a superposition of associations. Concurrent processing interferes with memory through involuntary encoding of distractors. Free time in-between distractors is used to remove irrelevant representations, thereby reducing interference. The model accounts for benchmark findings in four areas: (1) effects of processing pace, processing difficulty, and number of processing steps; (2) effects of serial position and error patterns; (3) effects {{of different kinds of}} item-distractor similarity; and (4) correlations between span tasks. The model makes several new predictions in these areas, which were confirmed experimentally...|$|R

The short acquisition time of single slices allows artifact-free imaging during free breathing, which demonstrates the potential use of this technique for whole-body screening. <b>Overlapping</b> <b>positioning</b> of consecutively acquired slices was used to provide gapless volume coverage in free-breathing measurements. The image contrast of ramped TrueFISP was analyzed in detail using simulations and experiments. A high ramp speed results in an increased overall signal intensity and in a modification of the known T 2 /T 1 contrast towards a proton density-weighted contrast. A further increase in imaging speed is achieved with z-interleaved phase-encoding trajectories based on weighted transitions between adjacent views...|$|R

As such, they offer themselves to test central assumptions of Communication Accommodation Theory, in particular, assumptions relating to the processes of convergence and divergence. ^ Researchers have identified linguistic and cultural differences in regard to the frequency, type, and placement of backchannel responses. This study examines differences in American English and German backchannel behavior and investigates backchannel behavior in interactions between monolingual and bilingual Germans. ^ Study 1 documents significant differences in the frequency and placement of backchannel responses among monolingual German speakers and monolingual American English speakers. Results show that Germans produce fewer backchannel responses and place these responses less frequently in <b>overlapping</b> <b>positions</b> than American speakers. ^ Study 2 finds that native Germans who have become equally proficient in American English produce a higher number of backchannel responses and more often in <b>overlapping</b> <b>positions</b> than monolingual Germans when they speak to other native Germans in German. This pragmatic interference, for which some evidence exists in cross-linguistic studies, contradicts basic assumptions of Communication Accommodation Theory. ^ Implications of inappropriate backchannel behavior could include reduced communication efficiency, negative interpersonal perception, and the potential for miscommunication. Implications of these findings for Communication Accommodation Theory and future research on backchannel responses are discussed. ...|$|E

E. coli produces only one functional tRNA from these precursors, indicating that tRNA overlaps are incompatible with its processing pathway.
