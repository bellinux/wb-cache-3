5|$|Although heavily {{populated}} {{prior to the}} conquest, the impact of Old World diseases {{was one of the}} factors that resulted in the depopulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hot,</b> moist lands of the Depresión Central, which remain sparsely populated to this day. Likewise, Soconusco was rapidly depopulated as a result of disease soon after contact with the Spanish. Among the most deadly diseases were smallpox, influenza, measles and a number of pulmonary diseases, including tuberculosis.|$|E

5|$|For centuries, {{the people}} of Iceland have used their hot springs for bathing and washing clothes. The first use of {{geothermal}} energy for heating did not come until 1907 when a farmer ran a concrete pipe from a hot spring that led steam into his house. In 1930, the first pipeline was constructed in Reykjavík, and was used to heat two schools, 60 homes, and the main hospital. It was a 3km pipeline that ran from one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> springs outside the city. In 1943, the first district heating company was started {{with the use of}} geothermal power. An 18km pipeline ran through the city of Reykjavík and by 1945 it was connected to over 2,850 homes.|$|E
5|$|From about 1790 {{textiles}} {{became the}} most important industry in the west of Scotland, especially the spinning and weaving of cotton, which flourished until in 1861 the American Civil War cut off the supplies of raw cotton. The industry never recovered, {{but by that time}} Scotland had developed heavy industries based on its coal and iron resources. The invention <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> blast for smelting iron (1828) revolutionised the Scottish iron industry. As a result, Scotland became a centre for engineering, shipbuilding and the production of locomotives. Toward the end of the 19th century, steel production largely replaced iron production.|$|E

5|$|In 1953, Robert S. Dietz and {{his colleagues}} first {{identified}} the swell behavior. It was suggested that the cause was mantle upwelling. Later work pointed to tectonic uplift, caused by reheating within the lower lithosphere. However, normal seismic activity beneath the swell, as well as lack of detected heat flow, caused scientists to suggest dynamic topography as the cause, in which the motion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> and buoyant mantle plume supports the high surface topography around the islands. Understanding the Hawaiian swell {{has important implications for}} hotspot study, island formation, and inner Earth.|$|E

The most commercially successful performances of the tour were venues with double bookings, found in East Rutherford, grossing $11.5 million, Pasadena grossing $10.9 million and San Francisco, generating $8.8 million. The tour was announced as the 5th highest grossing tour of 2014 in Pollstar's annual highest grossing tours chart, with a total revenue of $109.7 million. The tour also had a total attendance of 979,781 and an average attendance of 57,634 per city.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-40, {{formerly}} known as KOI-428, is an F-type star in the constellation Cygnus. Kepler-40 is known to host at least one planet, Kepler-40b. The star is approximately 1.5 times more massive than the Sun, and is over two times its size; it was, at upon its discovery, the largest yet discovered with a transiting planet in its orbit. Kepler-40 was first noted as home to a possible transiting object by the Kepler spacecraft; the data on the system was released to the public. A team of French and Swiss scientists used follow-up data to determine the existence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hot</b> Jupiter planet Kepler-40b, and later had their results published in a scientific journal on January 4, 2011.|$|E

5|$|The Monkland Canal was {{constructed}} {{at the end}} of the 18th century initially to transport coal to Glasgow from the rich local deposits. The invention <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> blast furnace process in 1828 meant that Coatbridge's ironstone deposits could be exploited to the maximum by the canal link and hot blast process. The new advances meant that iron could be produced with two thirds less fuel. Summerlee Iron Works was one of the first iron works to use this technology. By the mid 19th century there were numerous hot blast furnaces in operation in Coatbridge.|$|E
5|$|During the English Civil War, {{the city}} was garrisoned for Charles I. Seven {{thousand}} pounds was spent on fortifications, but on the appearance of parliamentary forces the gates were thrown open and the city surrendered. It became a significant post for the New Model Army under William Waller. Bath was retaken by royalists following the Battle of Lansdowne fought on the northern {{outskirts of the city}} on 5 July 1643. Thomas Guidott, a student of chemistry and medicine at Wadham College, Oxford, set up a practice in the city in 1668. He was interested in the curative properties of the waters, and he wrote A discourse of Bathe, and the hot waters there. Also, Some Enquiries into the Nature of the water in 1676. It brought the health-giving properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> mineral waters {{to the attention of the}} country, and the aristocracy arrived to partake in them.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{research}} {{has revealed that}} the size distributions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> classical and cold classical objects have differing slopes. The slope for the hot objects is q = 5.3 at large diameters and q = 2.0 at small diameters with the change in slope at 110 km. The slope for the cold objects is q = 8.2 at large diameters and q = 2.9 at small diameters with a change in slope at 140 km. The size distributions of the scattering objects, the plutinos, and the Neptune trojans have slopes similar to the other dynamically hot populations, but may instead have a divot, a sharp {{decrease in the number}} of objects below a specific size. This divot is hypothesized to be due to either the collisional evolution of the population, or to be due to the population having formed with no objects below this size, with the smaller objects being fragments of the original objects.|$|E

5|$|The medieval era is {{represented}} by the remains of the city walls in Upper Borough Walls. There are no other surviving buildings from this period. Several areas of the city underwent development during the Stuart period, in response to the increasing number of visitors to the spa and resort town who required accommodation. The St Thomas à Becket Church was built between 1490 and 1498 by John Cantlow, Prior of Bath Abbey and took the place of an older Norman church. The church was commonly called Old Widcombe Church and used to be the principal church of the parishes of Widcombe and Lyncombe. The Domesday survey of 1086 shows a small settlement around the church although no trace of it remains. In 1847 a much larger church, St Matthews, was built in Widcombe parish. On 22 April 1847, it was announced that the church bells, which had for centuries been in the tower of St. Thomas à Becket, were to be removed and installed in the new St. Matthew's. Widcombe Manor was originally built in 1656 and then rebuilt in 1727 for Philip Bennet the local MP. Thomas Guidott, moved to Bath and set up practice in 1668. He became interested in the curative properties of the waters and he wrote A discourse of Bathe, and the hot waters there. Also, Some Enquiries into the Nature of the water in 1676.
