The active constituent of the solder reacts with the base metal with a rate dependent on the solubility of the active constituents in the base metal.

2500|$|Arsenic has {{a similar}} {{electronegativity}} and ionization energies to its lighter congener phosphorus and as such readily forms covalent molecules {{with most of the}} nonmetals. Though stable in dry air, arsenic forms a golden-bronze tarnish upon exposure to humidity which eventually becomes a black surface layer. When heated in air, arsenic oxidizes to arsenic trioxide; the fumes from this reaction have an odor resembling garlic. This odor can be detected on striking arsenide minerals such as arsenopyrite with a hammer. It burns in oxygen to form arsenic trioxide and arsenic pentoxide, which have the same structure as the more well-known phosphorus compounds, and in fluorine to give arsenic pentafluoride. Arsenic (and some arsenic compounds) sublimes upon heating at atmospheric pressure, converting directly to a gaseous form without an intervening liquid state at [...] The triple point is 3.63MPa and [...] Arsenic makes arsenic acid with concentrated nitric acid, arsenous acid with dilute nitric acid, and arsenic trioxide with concentrated sulfuric acid; however, it does not react with water, alkalis, or non-oxidising acids. Arsenic reacts with metals to form arsenides, though these are not ionic compounds containing the As3− ion as the formation of such an anion would be highly endothermic and even the group 1 arsenides have properties <b>of</b> <b>intermetallic</b> <b>compounds.</b> Like germanium, selenium, and bromine, which like arsenic succeed the 3d transition series, arsenic is much less stable in the group oxidation state of +5 than its vertical neighbors phosphorus and antimony, and hence arsenic pentoxide and arsenic acid are potent oxidizers.|$|E
40|$|The {{formation}} and growth <b>of</b> <b>intermetallic</b> <b>compound</b> layer thickness {{is one of}} the important issues in search for reliable electronic and electrical connections. <b>Intermetallic</b> <b>compounds</b> (IMCs) are an essential part of solder joints. At low levels, they have a strengthening effect on the joint; but at higher levels, they tend to make solder joints more brittle. If the solder joint is subjected to long-standing exposure of high temperature, this could result in continuous growth <b>of</b> <b>intermetallic</b> <b>compound</b> layer. The brittle <b>intermetallic</b> <b>compound</b> layer formed in this way is very much prone to fracture and cold therefore lead to mechanical and electrical failure of the joint. Therefore, the primary aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the growth <b>of</b> <b>intermetallic</b> <b>compound</b> layer thickness subjected to five different reflow profiles. The study also looks at the effect of three different temperature cycles (with maximum cycle temperature of 25 0 C, 40 0 C and 60 0 C) on <b>intermetallic</b> <b>compound</b> {{formation and}} their growth behaviour [...] Two different Sn-Ag-Cu solder pastes (namely paste P 1 and paste P 2) which were different in flux medium, were used for the study.

50|$|Solid {{solution}} strengthening {{is a type}} of alloying {{that can}} be used to improve the strength of a pure metal. The technique works by adding atoms of one element (the alloying element) to the crystalline lattice of another element (the base metal), forming a solid solution. The local nonuniformity in the lattice due to the alloying element makes plastic deformation more difficult by impeding dislocation motion. In contrast, alloying beyond the solubility limit can form a second phase, leading to strengthening via other mechanisms (e.g. the precipitation <b>of</b> <b>intermetallic</b> <b>compounds).</b>|$|E
50|$|Ohmic contact {{degradation}} between metallisation and semiconductor layers. With gallium arsenide, a {{layer of}} gold-germanium alloy (sometimes with nickel) is used to achieve low contact resistance; an ohmic contact is formed by diffusion of germanium, forming a thin, highly n-doped region under the metal facilitating the connection, leaving gold deposited over it. Gallium atoms may migrate through this layer and get scavenged by the gold above, creating a defect-rich gallium-depleted zone under the contact; gold and oxygen then migrate oppositely, resulting in increased resistance of the ohmic contact and depletion of effective doping level.
