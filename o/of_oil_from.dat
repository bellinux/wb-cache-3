5|$|During 1944, Allied {{submarine}} attacks effectively cut off {{the supply}} <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> <b>from</b> Southeast Asia to Japan and greatly reduced Japanese imports of other commodities. By {{this stage of the}} war, the oil reserves in Japan had been largely depleted. U.S.Navy submarines sank many Japanese warships during 1944, including the battleship , seven aircraft carriers, two heavy and seven light cruisers. In early 1945, the Japanese Government assessed that all convoy routes from the south would eventually be cut, and attempted to supplement the supplies of oil brought in by tankers by loading drums of oil on freighters. Several IJN aircraft carriers were also used to transport drums <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> <b>from</b> Singapore to Japan.|$|E

Irrigation did not affect free acidity, peroxide number and fatty acid composition <b>of</b> <b>oils.</b> The oleic acid ranged from 74. 3 to 77. 5 % of total fatty acids in <b>oils</b> <b>from</b> dry-farmed and irrigated trees, respectively.

5|$|To {{supervise}} {{the construction of}} the pipeline, Alyeska appointed two construction management contractors to oversee all the other subcontractors in the project. Bechtel Corporation, from San Francisco, was named the management contractor for the pipeline itself. Fluor Alaska Inc., a division of Fluor Corp., was named the management contractor for the pumping stations and Valdez Marine Terminal, which was the most complex single section of the pipeline, since it involved the transfer <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> <b>from</b> the pipeline to seagoing oil tankers.|$|E
5|$|The electron's {{charge was}} more {{carefully}} {{measured by the}} American physicists Robert Millikan and Harvey Fletcher in their oil-drop experiment of 1909, the results of which were published in 1911. This experiment used an electric field to prevent a charged droplet <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> <b>from</b> falling {{as a result of}} gravity. This device could measure the electric charge from as few as 1–150 ions with an error margin of less than 0.3%. Comparable experiments had been done earlier by Thomson's team, using clouds of charged water droplets generated by electrolysis, and in 1911 by Abram Ioffe, who independently obtained the same result as Millikan using charged microparticles of metals, then published his results in 1913. However, oil drops were more stable than water drops because of their slower evaporation rate, and thus more suited to precise experimentation over longer periods of time.|$|E

25|$|Oil {{extraction}} {{is simply}} the removal <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> <b>from</b> the reservoir (oil pool).

25|$|In 1848 Young left Tennants', and in {{partnership}} with his friend and assistant Edward Meldrum, set up a small business refining the crude oil.

40|$|The {{compositions}} <b>of</b> {{the essential}} <b>oils</b> isolated <b>from</b> leaves and berries of Juniperus navicularis Gand., an endemic species from Portugal, were investigated by GC and GC-MS. <b>Oils</b> <b>from</b> representative samples <b>of</b> populations {{as well as}} from individual samples were studied. The <b>oils</b> consisted mainly <b>of</b> monoterpene hydrocarbons (67. 1 - 88. 0 % and 61. 7 % for leaf and berry oils, respectively). [alpha]-Pinene (6. 3 - 38. 0 %), limonene (7. 0 - 34. 6 %), [alpha]-phellandrene (2. 2 - 13. 1 %) and p-cymene (4. 8 - 10. 3 %) were the major constituents <b>of</b> the <b>oils</b> <b>from</b> leaves and [beta]-myrcene (25. 8 %) and [alpha]-pinene (24. 4 %) the major ones <b>of</b> the <b>oil</b> <b>from</b> berries.
