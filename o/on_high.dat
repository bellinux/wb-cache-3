5|$|Disruptive {{coloration}} (also {{known as}} disruptive camouflage or disruptive patterning) {{is a form}} of camouflage that works by breaking up the outlines of an animal, soldier or military vehicle with a strongly contrasting pattern. It is often combined with other methods of crypsis including background colour matching and countershading. It appears paradoxical as a way of not being seen, since disruption of outlines depends <b>on</b> <b>high</b> contrast, so the patches of colour are themselves conspicuous.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, the New York State Legislature created Route20, an {{unsigned}} legislative route {{extending from}} Elbridge to Rochester via Fairport.

On March1, 1921, Route20 was realigned to enter Monroe County on modern NY31. At {{the junction of}} Palmyra and Moseley Roads, Route20 turned north, following SH1290 into Fairport.
