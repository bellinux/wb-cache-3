We also evaluated the internal consistency using Cronbach's alpha (αC), in order to determine whether the tool had good validity for the target audience. ResultsThe study included 162 individuals with a mean age of 43. 8 ± 13. 6 years, of which 104 were female (64. 2 %) and 128 were married (79. 0 %). When assessing the QOL, the group <b>of</b> <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> healthy children had higher scores than the group <b>of</b> <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> asthmatic children in the four areas evaluated by the questionnaire (Physical, Psychological Health, Social Relationships and Environment), indicating a better quality of life.

40|$|This {{case-control study}} {{compared}} the caregiving experience of adult daughters <b>of</b> <b>parents</b> {{with and without}} dementia who resided in the community. A synthesis of diverse theoretical perspectives, developed by the researcher, provided direction for this study. The data used in the analysis were drawn from the 1991 - 92 Canadian Study of Health and Aging. A representative sample of 106 daughters <b>of</b> <b>parents</b> with dementia and 45 daughters <b>of</b> <b>parents</b> without dementia provided information regarding the context, stressors, and the level and correlates of depressive symptomatology associated with provision <b>of</b> care to <b>parents.</b> Daughters <b>of</b> <b>parents</b> with dementia tended to be slightly older, single or widowed, co-resided with their parent and used more formal care services when compared to daughters <b>of</b> <b>parents</b> without dementia. Differences between groups were also found regarding the stressors they experienced while providing care. More specifically, daughters <b>of</b> <b>parents</b> with dementia assisted with more personal and instrumental care. Their parent's functional status was more impaired and they contended with more behavioural disturbances and experienced greater burden than daughters <b>of</b> <b>parents</b> without dementia. There were no statistical differences between groups with respect to mean scores on the CES-D scale. However, fully one quarter <b>of</b> daughters <b>of</b> <b>parents</b> with dementia and one fifth <b>of</b> daughters <b>of</b> <b>parents</b> without dementia achieved scores indicative {{of at least a}} mild level of depressive symptomatology. Finally, self-reported health, health interferences, the need for additional formal care services and feelings of caregiver burden were associated with depressive symptoms for both groups of daughters.
