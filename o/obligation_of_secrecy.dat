40|$|The {{investigations}} of local police officers for causing {{the deaths of}} unarmed civilians in Ferguson, Missouri and Staten Island, New York have generated significant national discourse about the fairness and transparency of grand jury proceedings. This article addresses one crucial aspect of this ongoing debate; that is, whether witnesses {{before the grand jury}} should be allowed {{to talk to each other}} and to the media about the contents of their testimony. In the federal system and in the majority of states that still employ the grand jury as an investigative and charging tool, <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> grand jury <b>secrecy</b> do not extend to the witnesses themselves. Only persons performing an “official function” before the grand jury are typically covered by the oath <b>of</b> <b>secrecy.</b> Absent a contract or court order, grand jury witnesses are free to talk with each other and to the media. Nevertheless, prosecutors often seek to handcuff grand jury witnesses in talking to others about their testimony by drafting one-sided cooperation agreements that impose <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> confidentiality on grand jury witnesses in exchange for charging or sentencing concessions. Courts on occasion also impose gag orders on grand jury witnesses as part of formal immunity orders. In this article, the author argues that such efforts by prosecutors and courts to impose secrecy obligations on grand jury witnesses violate attorney discipline rules and the First Amendment. As importantly, they impede the target’s access to information essential to enable him to marshal a defense, thus undermining the grand jury’s historic function as a shield against unfounded prosecutions...|$|R

The first part generally focuses on the relation between an advocate and a client. This part is composed of four chapters. Chapter one attempts to define basic terminology used in this paper, such as advocacy, client and advocate. Then the history of advocacy from ancient Rome is outlined in brief as well as legislation of advocacy. Chapter two looks at various ways of formation of the relation between an advocate and a client, it focuses on the most common way - a contract about providing legal services. Chapter three is one of the crucial chapters of this paper and concentrates on chosen rights and obligations of an advocate towards a client and vice versa, rights and obligations of a client towards an advocate.

40|$|Significant {{discrepancies}} in {{the determination of}} the scope of the <b>obligation</b> <b>of</b> <b>secrecy</b> of deliberations by various international tribunals have led to the fact that some international judges are endowed with the right to a separate opinion, while others do not enjoy it. Taking into account the role and missions of the international judiciary, international judges should be given a right to separate opinions, like common law judges and many constitutional judges. Nevertheless, such analogies played only a marginal role in the preparatory works on the Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice in 1920. Indeed, it seemed politically unacceptable to the States that the legal opinion of an international judge, personifying them and their sovereign power within the court, should be condemned to anonymity by virtue of the principle of secrecy of deliberations, due only to the "technical" fact that such an opinion has been outweighed by the majority at the moment of voting on the draft judgment. There is a permissive rule of general International Law guaranteeing an autonomous power to the international judiciary to lay down, in the rules of procedure of any international court, the right to separate opinion, even if such a right is not expressly provided for by its statute or other constituting treaty. The aforementioned rule is presumed to apply unless it can be deduced from the behaviour of the founding States that they wished to derogate from it. The right to separate opinions can also be analysed from the perspective of judges' right to freedom of expression. In accordance with this freedom, an international judge can feel free to demonstrate systematically, in the form of separate opinions, the intellectual weaknesses of the majority views and reasoning, subject to avoiding offensive style and formulations. Such a form of expression is presumed to cause no harm to the authority of the judiciary. If some positive effects of absence or prohibition of separate opinions on the independence of international judges sitting in the case cannot be set aside too easily, nevertheless, such a serious measure restricting substantially their right to freedom of expression seems to be neither sufficiently efficient nor proportional to this pursued legitimate aim. There are other, more efficient and less restrictive tools which are also able to lead to the same result (for example, introduction of a single, non renewable mandate for international judges) ...|$|E
40|$|In {{light of}} current legal developments, {{there is a}} need to analyze the {{interface}} between canon law and civil law with respect to the seal of confession. This study integrates the theology, history, canon law, and civil law in order to ascertain the status of the seal of confession as a privileged communication in the law of evidence and whether it is subject to disclosure in court. The ethical basis may be founded on the exhortation to cover sin which appears in Scripture and patristic writings. After public confession fell into disuse, this ethic later crystallized into a rule, first of local application, then of universal application by the fifth century. By the thirteenth century, the Fourth Lateran Council affirmed its universal application and attached severe penalties to violations. Throughout history, there has been always been an interaction between the canon law and civil law. First, the civil law seems to have reinforced the rule of secrecy. Later, when the Church became established, civil legislation appeared enforcing the rule of secrecy, or alternatively recognizing the canon law. With the Reformation, civil legislation and case law appeared threatening the integrity of the seal of confession, and the Church responded with reaffirmations and legislation forbidding the breach of the of confession. The reason that the Church insists so strongly that the rule be upheld is that it is based on natural law, divine law, and positive law. It is critical that these three elements be clearly established and delineated in order to defend the rule concerning the seal of confession. The civil law of evidence has not received the seal of confession uniformly as a privileged communication. In England, the privilege was denied, whereas in Ireland and the United States the privilege was upheld. The Commonwealth countries of Australia and New Zealand have adopted the rule in certain states but not in others. The Canadian legal system is an offshoot of the English system. As a result, the English law was followed on the priest-penitent privilege, with the exception of provincial legislation in Quebec and Newfoundland. However, in 1991, the Supreme Court implemented the ad hoc use of the Wigmore criteria, a set of four evidentiary tests which is used to adjudicate claims of privilege with respect to confidential communications. With this, the question as to whether confessional communications were privileged communications within the law of evidence was reopened. The issue of whether the Catholic canon law in c. 983 CIC/ 1983 and c. 733 CCEO on the seal is sufficient to satisfy a claim of privilege has not yet been adjudicated, but it appears to satisfy the Wigmore criteria. The <b>obligation</b> <b>of</b> <b>secrecy</b> may conflict with the statutory reporting requirements for incidents of child abuse and communicable diseases. However, confessional secrecy may be a legitimate exercise in religious freedom due to the confessor being in a strong position to counsel a penitent to turn him or her self in to authorities and cease the behaviour, and thereby serves a public safety function. In any event, the Church has stated in no uncertain terms that where there is a conflict between the divine law and the civil law, the divine law is always to be followed...|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{considers}} the oddness <b>of</b> <b>secrecy’s</b> prominence in contemporary theatre marketing strategies that flaunt secrecy as a trope: for instance, {{in the recent}} campaigns of several London-based companies including the Lyric Hammersmith’s Secret Theatre Company, Secret Theatre London, and Secret Cinema. It also {{considers the}} incorporation <b>of</b> <b>secrecy</b> {{in the design of}} frameworks for audience immersion and participation in fairly recent work by Punchdrunk and Coney that encourage audiences to discover a performance’s hidden depths through physically explorative participation (Punchdrunk), or covert forms of participation that are meant to go unnoticed (Coney). Both of these areas – the economics and aesthetics <b>of</b> <b>secrecy</b> – inform the production and reception of work by Secret Cinema, especially, which pulls focus in this chapter. Secret Cinema makes live immersive theatre performances of films that are unknown in advance of a screening that appends each show. Audiences are encouraged to advertise the performance in advance of going by telling others to ‘tell no one’ about it on social media, and they are prompted to figure out the film’s identity by engaging with clues and procedures for participation that are inscribed in a marketing strategy and embedded within immersive environments. Drawing on sociological and psychological studies <b>of</b> <b>secrecy,</b> Erving Goffman’s concept of ‘keying’, and recent scholarship on audience participation and immersion, the chapter explores notions of audience inclusivity and exclusivity in work by Secret Cinema and how these notions are informed by a framework for audience participation and immersion that ties in with the economic uses <b>of</b> <b>secrecy.</b> I argue that the kind <b>of</b> <b>secrecy</b> at stake is a paradoxically spectacular and commodified secrecy in a contemporary twist on the secret society, complicating the binding <b>of</b> <b>secrecy</b> to polarised notions of inclusivity and exclusivity, inclusion and exclusion...|$|R
