The {{operation}} of the mixed feed concentrate distribution line that is installed on the Latvia University of Agriculture training and research farm „Vecauce ” milk farm has been investigated {{if it does not}} ensure regular supply of feed to the feeding stations. It has been stated in the research that at different feeding stations that are connected to the line the consumption of feed concentrate is different, and it interferes with successful {{operation of}} the conveyor switching automation. In order to eliminate this drawback several factors are of essential importance: capacity of the feeding station tanks, the tank capacity part at the last station between the feeding conveyor switching <b>on</b> and <b>off</b> <b>sensors</b> as well as the amount of feed at the conveyor part between the two other feeding stations. Key words: mixed feed concentrate, feeding station, dosimeter, feed conveyor, sensor, milking robot...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIt {{has been}} shown that in the initial stages of motion processing, the <b>ON</b> and <b>OFF</b> {{pathways}} stay more or less separated. There is evidence that this distinction between motion signals from opposite contrast polarities remains at least partly intact in the integration stage of local motion information. At the same time, interactions between the two systems are also apparent. Here we constructed stimuli that contained a constant number of moving checks. The checks were either assigned only one contrast polarity, or contrast polarity was distributed across the checks either randomly or evenly. We investigated how the spatial configuration of the moving stimulus affected direction discrimination thresholds for the different polarity distributions. Our results provide new evidence for contrast-sign-specific integration of local motion signals within areas of limited size, and inhibitory interactions between these separate <b>ON</b> and <b>OFF</b> motion <b>sensor</b> pools...|$|R
40|$|Generic role {{assignment}} is a programming abstraction {{that supports the}} assignment of user-defined roles to sensor nodes such that certain conditions are met. Many common network configuration problems such as coverage (assign roles <b>ON</b> and <b>OFF</b> to <b>sensor</b> nodes such that ON nodes cover a physical area with their sensors), clustering, or in-network data aggregation can be formulated as role assignment problems. Building on our previous work in this area, we propose an extended role specification language that supports the minimization or maximization {{of the use of}} a given role. Moreover, we provide a mapping of this language to integer linear programs and implement this mapping. We show how the resulting tool can be used analyze aspects of role specifications such as feasibility and optimality. 1...|$|R

Our research focuses on three points: (1) Iterative Homogenization of Porous SMAs: Development of a Multiscale Model of porous SMAs utilizing iterative homogenization and based on existing knowledge of constitutive modeling of polycrystalline SMAs. (2) DDDAS: Develop tools to turn <b>on</b> and <b>off</b> the <b>sensors</b> and heating unit(s), to monitor on-line data streams, to change scales based on incoming data, and to control what type of data is generated.

30|$|The useful signals {{inside the}} sensor node {{are divided into}} 5 groups. The first group is the wires between the RF {{transceiver}} and the MCU inside sensor nodes, which provide information on the radio packet. The second group is those from the MCU to the sensor, which provide information on the sensing operation. The third group is the Joint Test Action Group (JTAG) pins of the MCU, which provide functions to reprogram and debug. The forth group is external communication pins of the MCU, such as RS- 232, which provide information about external data sent by MCU. The last group is the power supply lines for the sensor node, which help us to turn <b>on</b> or <b>off</b> the <b>sensor</b> node and measure its power consumption. The test board {{is linked to the}} corresponding sensor node via one or more groups of wires carefully chosen. Among all the five groups, the first group, that is, the signal group between the RF transceiver and the MCU inside sensor nodes, is most important for the networking test.|$|R

Methods Children and adults (n[*]=[*] 153) on CSII with HbA 1 c 7. 5 – 9. 5 % (58. 5 – 80. 3 mmol/mol) were randomised to (CGM) a <b>Sensor</b> <b>On</b> or <b>Sensor</b> <b>Off</b> arm for 6 months. After 4 months’ washout, participants crossed over to the other arm for 6 months. Paediatric and adult participants were separately electronically randomised through the case report form according to a predefined randomisation sequence in eight secondary and tertiary centres. The primary outcome was the difference in HbA 1 c levels between arms after 6 months. Results Seventy-seven participants were randomised to the On/Off sequence and 76 to the Off/On sequence; all were included in the primary analysis. The mean difference in HbA 1 c was – 0. 43 % (– 4. 74 mmol/mol) in favour of the Sensor On arm (8. 04 % [64. 34 mmol/mol] vs 8. 47 % [69. 08 mmol/mol]; 95 % CI − 0. 32 %, − 0. 55 % [− 3. 50, − 6. 01 mmol/mol]; p[*]<[*] 0. 001).

40|$|Background: Studies {{investigating}} {{the effect of}} real-time continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) combined with pump therapy on glycemic outcomes in type 1 diabetes are increasing. Pump therapy is well established as a "gold standard" for insulin delivery, offering improvements over multiple daily insulin injections. However, {{there is still a}} proportion of subjects using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion in whom goals for metabolic control are far from achieved or benefits of this type of insulin therapy are transient. The SWITCH (Sensing With Insulin pump Therapy to Control HbA 1 c [hemoglobin A 1 c]) study is a multicenter, randomized, controlled, crossover study to evaluate if adding CGM to experienced pump patients with suboptimal metabolic control will provide additional insight enabling clinical and therapeutic benefit. Methods: Subjects meeting the inclusion criteria were randomized to <b>Sensor</b> <b>On</b> or <b>Sensor</b> <b>Off</b> arms for 6 months, after a 1 -month run-in period. Following a 4 -month washout period, the subjects crossed over to the other study arm for 6 months. The primary end point was the between arm difference in HbA 1 c levels. Among others, additional end points include time spent in different glycemic ranges, percentage of patients with HbA 1 c < 7 %, number of hypoglycemic events, glucose variability parameters, safety outcomes, treatment satisfaction, and quality of life. Results: Recruitment occurred between January 2008 and February 2009. A total of 153 patients were randomized. Study completion is anticipated in July 2010. Conclusions: The results will establish if adding CGM to existing, capable, insulin pump users can enable better metabolic control. © Copyright 2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2011...|$|R

We introduce a novel method for activity recognition which leverages the predictability {{of human behavior}} to conserve energy by dynamically selecting sensors. We further present a taxonomy of existing approaches to dynamically reducing consumption while maintaining recognition rates. The novel algorithm conserves energy by quantifying activity-sensor dependencies, and using prediction methods to identify likely future activities. The approach is implemented and simulated using two activity recognition data sets {{and the effects of}} the novel method are evaluated in terms of recognition rates, energy consumption and prediction rates. The results indicate that switching <b>off</b> <b>sensors</b> only significantly affects prediction under extreme conditions, and that these effects can be counteracted by adjusting system parameters. Large savings in energy can be achieved at very low cost, e. g. recognition losses of 1. 5 pp with 84. 8 % energy savings for the first data set, and 2. 8 pp and 89. 9 % for the second. ...|$|R
