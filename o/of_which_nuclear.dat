40|$|Nuclear {{power is}} an {{important}} and, the authors believe, essential component of a secure nuclear future. Although nuclear fuel cycles create materials that have some potential for use in nuclear weapons, with appropriate fuel cycles, nuclear power could reduce rather than increase real proliferation risk worldwide. Future fuel cycles could be designed to avoid plutonium production, generate minimal amounts of plutonium in proliferation-resistant amounts or configurations, and/or transparently and efficiently consume plutonium already created. Furthermore, a strong and viable US nuclear infrastructure, <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>nuclear</b> power is a large element, is essential if the US is to maintain a leadership or even participatory role in defining the global nuclear infrastructure and controlling the proliferation of nuclear weapons. By focusing on new fuel cycles and new reactor technologies, {{it is possible to}} advantageously burn and reduce nuclear materials {{that could be used for}} nuclear weapons rather than increase and/or dispose of these materials. Thus, the authors suggest that planners for a secure nuclear future use technology to design an ideal future. In this future, nuclear power creates large amounts of virtually atmospherically clean energy while significantly lowering the threat of proliferation through the thoughtful use, physical security, and agreed-upon transparency of nuclear materials. The authors must develop options for policy makers that bring them as close as practical to this ideal.

40|$|Abstract Background Nuclear receptors are a {{superfamily}} of metazoan transcription {{factors that}} regulate diverse developmental and physiological processes. Sequenced genomes from {{an increasing number}} of bilaterians have provided a more complete picture of duplication and loss of nuclear receptors in protostomes and deuterostomes but have left open the question <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>nuclear</b> receptors were present in the cnidarian-bilaterian ancestor. In addition, nuclear receptor expression and function are largely uncharacterized within cnidarians, preventing determination of conserved and novel nuclear receptor functions in the context of animal evolution. Results Here we report the first complete set of nuclear receptors from a cnidarian, the starlet sea anemone Nematostella vectensis. Genomic searches using conserved DNA- and ligand-binding domains revealed seventeen nuclear receptors in N. vectensis. Phylogenetic analyses support N. vectensis orthologs of bilaterian nuclear receptors in four nuclear receptor subfamilies within nuclear receptor family 2 (COUP-TF, TLL, HNF 4, TR 2 / 4) and one putative ortholog of GCNF (nuclear receptor family 6). Other N. vectensis genes grouped well with nuclear receptor family 2 but represented lineage-specific duplications somewhere within the cnidarian lineage and were not clear orthologs of bilaterian genes. Three nuclear receptors were not well-supported within any particular nuclear receptor family. The seventeen nuclear receptors exhibited distinct developmental expression patterns, with expression of several nuclear receptors limited to a subset of developmental stages. Conclusion N. vectensis contains a diverse complement of nuclear receptors including orthologs of several bilaterian nuclear receptors. Novel nuclear receptors in N. vectensis may be ancient genes lost from triploblastic lineages or may represent cnidarian-specific radiations. Nuclear receptors exhibited distinct developmental expression patterns, which are consistent with diverse regulatory roles for these genes. Understanding the evolutionary relationships and developmental expression of the N. vectensis nuclear receptor complement provides insight into the evolution of the nuclear receptor superfamily and a foundation for mechanistic characterization of cnidarian nuclear receptor function. </p...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} thesis, two {{positive}} sense single-stranded RNA viruses {{have been used}} as models to understand the structure and function of viral-encoded proteins. One of them, Pepper Vein Banding Virus (PVBV; genus Potyvirus; family Potyviridae) is a flexuous, rod-shaped virus that encodes for a polyprotein of size ~ 340 kDa. The polyprotein undergoes proteolytic processing by viral-encoded proteases, <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>Nuclear</b> Inclusion-a Protease (NIa-Pro) is the major protease. It is a serine-like cysteine protease which cleaves between a Q/A or Q/S, present {{in the context of the}} heptapeptide recognition sequence. The temporal regulation of intermediates and mature proteins released by NIa-Pro cleavage is crucial for a successful infection. In the present study, histidine-tagged NIa-Pro, Viral Protein genome-linked (VPg), and the cleavage site mutant (E 191 A) VPg-Pro were over-expressed in E. coli and purified. The protease activity of NIa-Pro was monitored using an HPLC-based protease assay developed using a peptide substrate. NIa-Pro protease activity was found to get modulated upon interaction with VPg and upon undergoing phosphorylation. Both these events have been found to involve the face of NIa-Pro which contains the solvent-exposed Trp 143. Mutational studies and molecular dynamics analyses provide evidence that this residue is buried upon interaction of NIa-Pro with VPg, and any perturbation of its orientation influences the active site Cys 151 via an extensive interaction network. This interaction was found to enhance the velocity of NIa-Pro protease activity, especially if the two domains were present in trans (VPg+Pro). In addition, the main-chain –NH 2 group of Trp 143 was found to be hydrogen-bonded to the side chain –OH group of Ser 129, the residue which was identified to undergo phosphorylation by host plant kinases. Interestingly, when the two domains were present in cis (E 191 A VPg-Pro), no phosphorylation was observed. Mutations of Ser 129 (to phosphorylation-mimic Asp or phosphorylation-deficient Ala residues) which affected this H-bond were found to disturb Trp 143 and Cys 151 orientation, which drastically reduced the protease activity of NIa-Pro. Within the polyprotein, VPg is present at the N-terminus of NIa-Pro and the cleavage site between them is suboptimal (E/A). In the present study, VPg-Pro was shown to be covalently linked to the genomic RNA present in the virions. Interestingly, during purification, VPg could only be purified from the soluble when it was expressed at the N-terminus of NIa-Pro. A series of bioinformatics and biophysical analysis of VPg showed that PVBV VPg, like other potyviral VPgs, exists as a molten-globule. Moreover, while VPg was shown to harbour the Walker motifs, it was found to exhibit an ATPase activity only when it was present with the NIa-Pro (especially in cis). Lys 47 and Asp 88 :Glu 89 were found crucial for optimal activity. Over all the results demonstrated that there is a reciprocal modulation of structure and function of the VPg and NIa-Pro domains. These results can explain the possible significance of an impeded cleavage rate between the two domains of VPg-Pro during PVBV infection. The precursor, VPg-Pro, could offer the advantage of evading the inhibitory phosphorylation of NIa-Pro by the host, as well as drive certain viral processes by virtue of its ATPase activity. And subsequent cleavage of the domains and their trans interaction could offer a higher turnover rate which might assist sufficient CP production required for viral morphogenesis. Another virus, Tobacco Streak Virus (TSV) that belongs to the Ilarvirus genus of the Bromoviridae family is a spherical virus which forms pleiomorphic icosahedral virus particles. It has a tripartite genome and each RNA is encapsidated individually. In the present thesis, TSV was used as a model to understand the properties of its structural protein-the coat protein (CP), with the aim of deciphering TSV assembly process. Thus, the CP gene from TSV RNA 3 was cloned and over-expressed in E. coli. The coat protein thus expressed formed virus-like particles (VLPs), which could be disassembled into dimers using high CaCl 2 concentrations. Reassembly of VLPs was possible from dimers even in the absence of any nucleic acid. Mutational analysis of the N-terminal disordered domain showed that 26 amino acid residues from the amino-terminus could be crucial for capsid heterogeneity while, zinc-binding domain was essential for assembly. Overall, the present study shows that the flexible W-C loop of PVBV NIa-Pro, the disordered N-terminal region of PVBV VPg and the disordered N-terminal region of TSV CP harbour residues crucial for regulation of protein function. Such regulatory elements would ultimately allow viruses to maintain a smaller protein number, and thus a smaller genome size...|$|E
