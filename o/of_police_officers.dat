5|$|The Bill {{is unique}} amongst police dramas {{in that it}} takes a serial format, {{focussing}} on the work and lives of a single shift <b>of</b> <b>police</b> <b>officers,</b> rather than on one particular area of police work. Also unique is that The Bill adapted to this format after several series, whereas comparable series started with the serial format.|$|E
5|$|The first special {{police unit}} {{established}} in the 1990s was the Lučko Anti-Terrorist Unit (ATU). Its ranks were largely filled through the selection <b>of</b> <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> trained in Zagreb in 1990. A small number of other personnel were drawn from a special forces unit of the Croatian Ministry of the Interior that existed before the 1990s. Marko Lukić was the first commanding officer of the Lučko ATU.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of {{graduation}} all officers are qualified for operational service. However, each employee must undergo 40 hours of yearly training, including firearms practice, to keep their operational certification. Without this, they cannot patrol, use firearms or participate in actions. Forty-four percent <b>of</b> <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> in 2012 lacked such certification. The main {{reason is that the}} police districts see it as a waste of resources to train investigation and administrative staff which do not participate in operative duty, and that a higher quality is achieved through specialization of tasks, such as dedicated investigation personnel.|$|E
5|$|Education <b>of</b> <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> is the {{responsibility}} of the Norwegian Police University College, which is subordinate to the National Police Directorate. The main campus is located at Majorstuen in Oslo, while the secondary campus is located at Mørkved in Bodø. In addition the college has training centers in Kongsvinger and Stavern. Police officer training is a three-year bachelor's degree, where the first and third year take place at the college and the second year is on-the-ground training in police districts.|$|E
5|$|Norton {{spent his}} days {{inspecting}} San Francisco's streets in an elaborate blue uniform with gold-plated epaulettes, {{given to him by}} officers of the United States Army post at the Presidio of San Francisco. He also wore a beaver hat decorated with a peacock feather and a rosette. He frequently enhanced this regal posture with a cane or umbrella. During his inspections, Norton would examine the condition of the sidewalks and cable cars, the state of repair of public property, and the appearance <b>of</b> <b>police</b> <b>officers.</b> Norton would also frequently give lengthy philosophical expositions on a variety of topics to anyone within earshot.|$|E

5|$|Sir Oliver Popplewell {{published}} his {{inquiry into the}} fire in 1986, which introduced new safety legislation for sports grounds across the country. Forensic scientist David Woolley believed {{the cause of the}} fire was from a discarded cigarette or match, which had dropped through gaps between the seating to a void below the stand where rubbish had built up. A number <b>of</b> <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> and 22spectators were later awarded bravery awards for their deeds on the day.|$|E
5|$|Despite ongoing {{efforts by}} the Ministry of Domestic Security, crime has worsened in Antananarivo since 2009. Between 1994 and 1998, the city {{had an average of}} eight to twelve police {{officers}} for every 10,000 inhabitants; large cities should typically have closer to fifteen. Under the mayorship of Marc Ravalomanana (1998–2001), street lights were installed or repaired throughout the city to improve night-time safety. He increased the number <b>of</b> <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> on the streets, leading to a drop in crime. , the city lacks a comprehensive strategy for reducing crime. The recent increase in crime and the inadequate response from the CUA has prompted the growth of private security firms in the city.|$|E
5|$|Differences between Rama Rao and Varalakshmi {{due to the}} latter's tantrums, also occurred. When Varalakshmi {{refused to}} touch Rama Rao's feet in the scene in which his father drags him from the {{marriage}} hall, Prasad asked Nagi Reddy's son B. L. N. Prasad—the second assistant cameraman working under Bartley—to wear a dhoti and stand before her. Chakrapani liked a scene in a play in which a group <b>of</b> <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> in ascending hierarchy, each junior gave up his chair for the senior; he used the same idea in Savitri's marriage sequences in the film. Similarly, Prasad incorporated part of a stage play enacted by children into the film, which Nagi Reddy's son Venkatarami Reddy was a part of. Prasad also made a cameo appearance in the film.|$|E

5|$|From the 19th century, deputies {{were hired}} in larger areas {{to assist the}} sheriffs. Following the democratization in 1814, the Ministry of Justice was created in 1818 and has since had the primary {{responsibility}} for organizing the police force. The 19th century saw a large {{increase in the number}} of chiefs of police, reaching sixteen by the middle of the century. Christiania established the country's first uniformed corps of constables in 1859, which gave the force a more unified appearance. Similar structures were soon introduced in many other cities. From 1859 the municipalities would finance the wages of the deputies and constables, which made it difficult for the police to use those forces outside the municipal borders. The first organized education <b>of</b> <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> started in Christiania in 1889.|$|E
5|$|Other policemen {{arrived in}} Houndsditch, {{and began to}} attend to the wounded. Tucker's body was put into a taxi and he was taken to the London Hospital (now the Royal London Hospital) in Whitechapel Road. Choate was also taken there, where he was {{operated}} on, but he died at 5:30 am on 17 December. Bentley was taken to St Bartholomew's Hospital. He was half-conscious on arrival, but recovered {{enough to be able to}} have a conversation with his pregnant wife and answer questions about the events. At 6:45pm on 17 December his condition worsened, and he died at 7:30. The killings of Tucker, Bentley and Choate remain one of the largest multiple murders <b>of</b> <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> carried out in Britain in peacetime.|$|E
5|$|Reports were sketchy {{initially}} – television pictures {{broadcast on}} ITV showed Stein, {{who appeared to}} be both conscious and alert, being carried down the tunnel by a number <b>of</b> <b>police</b> <b>officers,</b> with commentator Brian Moore speculating that he had been overcome with the emotion of the result. BBC Radio commentator Peter Jones (who had no access to the television pictures and was relying on information from other people in the press box) also speculated that the tension of the result and the night had led to Stein's collapse. Willie Miller, the Scottish captain on the night in the absence of Graeme Souness, was informed by Martin Tyler of ITV Sport during the post-match interview that Stein had collapsed, with Alex Ferguson entering the dressing room to tell them that Stein had suffered a heart attack.|$|E

5|$|By {{shortly after}} the passage of the storm, the {{government}} of Veracruz opened 6,000emergency storm shelters for impacted citizens. Floodwaters from the rainfall inundated scores of houses and cars, with a total of 7,500families in Veracruz directly affected by the storm. The Mexican Army, combined with the efforts <b>of</b> <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> and state officials, worked with amphibious vehicles to rescue families in flooded houses, of whom many waited on rooftops; according to reports from the Civil Defense of the government of Veracruz, a person drowned in the city of Cerro Azul. Several people were reported missing, as well. Landslides from the flooding cut communications and left 66villages temporarily isolated. Across Veracruz, the most affected localities were Naranjos, Chinampa de Gorostiza, Tamalín, Tantima, Benito Juárez, Tamiahua, and Tempoal de Sánchez. The government of Veracruz {{declared a state of emergency}} for 14 municipalities. Damage in the state totaled over 100million pesos (2005MXN, $9.3million 2005USD, $10.3million 2008USD); the state government requested reconstruction aid amounting to the equivalent of the damage total.|$|E
5|$|Celeste gives Natasha the waitressing job at Charlie's and {{she moves}} in with Summer and Karl Kennedy (Alan Fletcher), after her house is sold.

Natasha meets Ed Lee (Sebastian Gregory) at Charlie's and offers to help him solve a maths equation, but he dismisses her. When she solves the problem, he invites her to a maths club. Natasha later transfers to his calculus course and Ed helps her with conditional probability, which they use to predict the outcome of a game of cards. They decide to play a game of Blackjack with a group of guys at Charlie's, but are forced to stop when a couple <b>of</b> <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> walks in.

5|$|In June 2008, Stabæk {{announced}} they had signed an eleven-year sponsorship {{agreement with the}} telecommunications company Telenor, where the latter would pay up to NOK115 million for the sole naming rights for the arena, in addition to tickets and access to executive boxes. In March 2009, the retailing property was sold from Scandinavian Property Development to KLP Eiendom. The plans called for twenty to twenty-five football games, four to eight concerts, three to four large sports events and two other large events and conventions per year. Because of larger seating capacity, an all-seating arrangement, higher attendance and VIP facilities, Stabæk is able to generate three times the matchday revenue from Telenor Arena as Nadderud. The stadium is plagued with traffic problems on matchdays, with large crews hired to create temporary barriers to direct the crowds. The bus stops closest to the venue are closed, {{and a large number}} <b>of</b> <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> have to direct the traffic. These are costs which have to be carried by the arena company, and contrasts to matches at the nearly twice as large Ullevaal, where no such measures are necessary.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{gains in}} the {{percentage}} <b>of</b> female <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> over past decades, female <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> are vastly underrepresented in modern <b>policing.</b> Female <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> face barriers to integration into policing and the surrounding culture that male <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> do not face, including unbalanced physical testing, double standards for success, and others. One explanation for the different experiences <b>of</b> female <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> compared to male <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> is the token status <b>of</b> women in <b>policing.</b> Instead <b>of</b> taking the token status <b>of</b> female <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> for granted, this study explored {{the utility of the}} theory of tokenism (Kanter, 1977) in explaining the experiences <b>of</b> female <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> in Midwestern <b>police</b> agencies.

5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the earthquakes, the National Crisis Management Centre was activated through The Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management to manage public response to the disaster; hundreds <b>of</b> <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> were accordingly dispatched to patrol the city streets. Authorities proposed to set up an outdoors emergency operations centre, as well as a public welfare centre to provide shelter to victims overnight. The Student Volunteer Army — which partook in silt shifting after the February 2011 quake — again prepared the recruitment of participants to initiate street clearing actions. A total of NZ$285,000 (US$230,000) was allocated for donations to nine charities, including NZ$40,000 (US$32,000) to both the Red Cross Christchurch earthquake appeal and the Canterbury Earthquake Appeal Salvation Army funds. At Westpac Bank, a public donation account was opened in order to provide financial assistance for earthquake victims. Chief executives from the Commonwealth Bank sponsored an exclusive dinner in Sydney to raise money for rebuilding costs; an initial A$700,000 (US$660,000) was allocated prior to the event, with entry costs of A$10,000 (US$9,500) per ticket.|$|E
5|$|Pericles {{runs into}} {{the wreck of the}} Oberon and Leo runs after him, {{followed}} by General Thade. Thade and Leo fight. Pericles tries to help Leo, but Thade throws him hard against a wall. Thade takes Leo's gun from him and tries to fire the weapon at Leo. Leo sees that Thade is within the pilot's deck and closes the automatic door, trapping Thade inside. Thade fires the weapon repeatedly at the door but the ricochets create sparks that cause Thade to huddle afraid under a control panel. Leo decides to escape the Planet of the Apes and return to Earth. He gives Pericles to Ari, who promises to look after him. He says goodbye and kisses Ari and Daena. Leo climbs aboard Pericles's undamaged pod and travels back in time through the same electromagnetic storm. Leo crashes in Washington, D.C. on Earth.
