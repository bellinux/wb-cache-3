5|$|A Gothic {{screen was}} also {{added to the}} Norman nave at Peterborough, {{but this is an}} {{architectural}} oddity with no precedent or successor. The screen is composed of three enormous open arches, the two outer ones being much wider than that which frames the central door. The overwhelming composition is somewhat spoilt by the later porch and the fact that two towers <b>of</b> <b>very</b> different height pop up from behind the screen. Despite this, it is {{regarded as one of the}} supreme masterpieces of Gothic, revealing the enormous diversity and imagination of English medieval architects.|$|E

500|$|The modern {{reassessment}} <b>of</b> Jones <b>Very</b> as {{an author}} of literary importance can be dated to a 1936 essay by Yvor Winters who wrote of the poet, “In {{the past two decades}} two major American writers have been rediscovered and established securely in their rightful places in literary history. I refer to Emily Dickinson and Herman Melville. I am proposing the establishment of a third.” Winters, in speaking <b>of</b> <b>Very’s</b> relations with Emerson and his circle, concluded, “The attitude of the Transcendentalists toward Very is instructive and amusing, and it proves beyond cavil how remote he was from them. In respect to the doctrine of the submission of the will, he agreed with them in principle; but whereas they recommended the surrender, he practised it, and they regarded him with amazement.” Subsequently, William Irving Bartlett, in 1942, outlined the basic biographical facts <b>of</b> <b>Very’s</b> life in Jones Very, Emerson’s “Brave Saint.” [...] A complete scholarly edition <b>of</b> <b>Very’s</b> poetic works belatedly appeared, over a century after the poet’s death, in 1993.|$|R

This works both ways across the alps but is more efficient if blowing from the south due to the steeper step for oncoming wind from the south. Valleys running south to north trigger the best effect.|$|E

500|$|The last decades <b>of</b> <b>Very's</b> {{life were}} spent in Salem as a recluse {{under the care}} of his sister. It was during these years that he held roles as a visiting {{minister}} in Eastport, Maine and North Beverly, Massachusetts, though these roles were temporary because he had become too shy. By age 45, he had retired. In his last forty years, Very did very little. As biographer Edwin Gittleman wrote, [...] "Although he lived until 1880, Very's effective life was over by the end of 1840."

Nino Bixio was involved in the pursuit of a group of Austro-Hungarian raiders in December 1915, but did not engage them before they escaped. Marsala briefly battled Austro-Hungarian cruisers during the Battle of the Otranto Straits in May 1917.
