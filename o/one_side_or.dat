5|$|A {{forward is}} a player {{position}} on the field whose responsibility is primarily offensive. Typically, a forward is dominant throwing with one hand or the other, and will primarily play {{on that side of}} the floor. Some players, known as creasemen, do not focus on <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>or</b> the other. These players instead focus their offensive attention near the crease area in front of the goaltender.|$|E

Those loyal to <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>or</b> the other told conflicting stories and independent eyewitnesses who did not know the participants by sight were unable to say for certain who shot first.|$|E
5|$|Battles {{consist of}} both story-related boss fights and random {{encounters}} with standard enemies. Battles are turn-based, with the player characters and enemies moving around a small battle arena to perform actions. Once the player {{has laid out}} their strategy in the battle menu, the characters perform their assigned actions until the battle ends with victory for <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>or</b> the player pauses the action to change strategies. Instead of the grid-based battle system from the original Persona, party members and enemy units act in the same phase of a turn, rather than being restricted by their placement on the field.|$|E

5|$|Before {{reaching}} Italy, Titus learnt that Galba {{had been}} murdered and replaced by Otho, the governor of Lusitania (modern Portugal). At the same time Vitellius and his armies in Germania had risen in revolt and prepared to march on Rome, intent on overthrowing Otho. Not wanting to risk being taken hostage by <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>or</b> the other, Titus abandoned the journey to Rome and rejoined his father in Judaea.|$|E
5|$|Bikes may {{experience}} {{a variety of}} longitudinal forces and motions. On most bikes, when the front wheel is turned to <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>or</b> the other, the entire rear frame pitches forward slightly, depending on the steering axis angle {{and the amount of}} trail. On bikes with suspensions, either front, rear, or both, trim is used to describe the geometric configuration of the bike, especially in response to forces of braking, accelerating, turning, drive train, and aerodynamic drag.|$|E
5|$|Bran Stark is {{learning}} how to be the Lord of Winterfell while his older brother is away at war. He has a strange dream, where he sees himself as Summer, his direwolf, running in the Godswood. The next morning, {{he goes to the}} Godswood with Osha, who tries to pry about his dreams, but Bran ignores her questions. The pair notice a red comet in the sky; Bran remarks that the men claim it is an omen of victory for <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>or</b> another in the war, but Osha insists it means one thing: dragons have returned.|$|E

He voted in favor of the Old Court, {{reflecting}} his upper-class status and affinity for the establishment. In so doing, he identified himself with the party of Kentucky's favorite son, Henry Clay. The Whigs would control Kentucky politics for the next twenty-five years. In 1826, the majority of the General Assembly sided with the Old Court and abolished the New Court.|$|E
5|$|Who started {{shooting}} first is not certain; accounts by both participants and eyewitnesses are contradictory. The {{smoke from the}} black powder used in the weapons added to the confusion of the gunfight in the narrow space. Those loyal to <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>or</b> the other told conflicting stories, and independent eyewitnesses {{who did not know}} the participants by sight were unable to say for certain who shot first. The six or seven men with guns fired about 30 shots in around 30 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Even when staying {{relatively}} motionless, a rider can {{balance a}} bike {{by the same}} principle. While performing a track stand, the rider can keep {{the line between the}} two contact patches under the combined center of mass by steering the front wheel to <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>or</b> the other and then moving forward and backward slightly to move the front contact patch from side to side as necessary. Forward motion can be generated simply by pedaling. Backwards motion can be generated the same way on a fixed-gear bicycle. Otherwise, the rider can take advantage of an opportune slope of the pavement or lurch the upper body backwards while the brakes are momentarily engaged.|$|E

5|$|On October 14, the {{retreating}} Patriot force held drumhead courts-martial of Loyalists on various charges (treason, desertion from Patriot militias, incitement of Indian rebellion). Passing through the Sunshine community {{in what is}} now Rutherford County, N.C., the retreat halted on the property of the Biggerstaff family. Aaron Biggerstaff, a Loyalist, had fought in the battle and been mortally wounded. His brother Benjamin was a Patriot and was being held as a prisoner-of-war on a British ship docked at Charleston, S.C. Their cousin John Moore was the Loyalist commander at the earlier Battle of Ramsour's Mill (modern Lincolnton, N.C.), in which many of the combatants at Kings Mountain had participated on <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>or</b> the other.|$|E
5|$|The sails {{of these}} vessels {{are made of}} strips of bamboo, woven into the form of matting. The sailors never lower them (while sailing, but simply) change the {{direction}} of them according to whether {{the wind is blowing}} from <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>or</b> the other. When the ships cast anchor, the sails are left standing in the wind. Each of these ships is worked by 1,000 men, 600 sailors and 400 marines, among whom there are archers and crossbowmen furnished with shields, and men who throw (pots of) naptha. Each great vessel is followed by three others, a 'nisfi', a 'thoulthi' and a 'roubi' (f endnote: a pinnace, a small boat fitted with a rudder, and a rowing boat). These vessels are nowhere made except in the city of Zayton (Quanzhou) in China, or at Sin-Kilan, which is the same as Sin al-Sin (Guangzhou).|$|E
5|$|By 1921 Zobel had further perfected his {{composite}} filter designs. He was now using, in addition, m-type half sections {{at the ends}} of his {{composite filter}}s to improve the impedance matching of the filter to the source and the load, a technique in which he held a patent. The difficulty {{that he was trying to}} overcome was that the image impedance techniques being used to design filter sections only gave the mathematically predicted response if they were terminated in their respective image impedances. Technically, this was easy to do within the filter as it could always be arranged that adjacent filter sections had matching image impedances (one of the characteristics of m-type sections is that <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>or</b> the other of the m-type section will have an image impedance identical to the equivalent constant k section). However, the terminating impedances are a different story. These are normally required to be resistive but the image impedance will be complex. Even worse, it is not even mathematically possible to construct a filter image impedance out of discrete components. The result of impedance mismatch is reflections and a degraded filter performance. Zobel found that a value of m=0.6 for the end half sections, while not mathematically exact, gave a good match to resistive terminations in the pass-band.|$|E

50|$|Grip {{strength}} increases or decreases {{depending on}} the arm position at which the grip strength is being measured. A person's grip strength usually results in having the strongest grip strength when their arm is extended at 90° before their body, {{as opposed to the}} other extreme arm positions, rested at <b>one's</b> <b>side</b> <b>or</b> held straight up above one's head. Grip strength is not optimal if one's arm is extended backwards beyond the resting position at the body's sides.We can conclude that grip strength is affected via the different arm muscles and their ability to contract.|$|R
5|$|On 9 June 68, amidst growing {{opposition}} of the Senate and the army, Nero committed suicide, and with him the Julio-Claudian dynasty came to an end. Chaos ensued, leading to a year of brutal civil war known as the Year of the Four Emperors, during which the four most influential generals in the Roman EmpireGalba, Otho, Vitellius and Vespasiansuccessively vied for the imperial power. News of Nero's death reached Vespasian as he was preparing to besiege the city of Jerusalem. Almost simultaneously the Senate had declared Galba, then governor of Hispania Tarraconensis (modern Spain), as Emperor of Rome. Rather than continue his campaign, Vespasian decided to await further orders and send Titus to greet the new Emperor. Before reaching Italy however, Titus learnt that Galba had been murdered and replaced by Otho, the governor of Lusitania (modern Portugal). At the same time Vitellius and his armies in Germania had risen in revolt, and prepared to march on Rome, intent on overthrowing Otho. Not wanting to risk being taken hostage by <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>or</b> the other, Titus abandoned the journey to Rome and rejoined his father in Judaea.|$|E
