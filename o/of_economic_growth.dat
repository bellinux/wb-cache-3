Currency devaluation effectively reduced wages by 50% making exports more competitive and imports more expensive. Ten-year government bonds were issued below 6%, lower than some of the PIIGS nations in the EU (Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece, and Spain). Tryggvi Thor Herbertsson, a member of parliament, noted that adjustments via currency devaluations are less painful than government labor policies and negotiations. Nevertheless, while EU fervor has cooled the government continued to pursue membership.|$|E

Tirunelveli was a strategic point, connecting the eastern and western parts of the peninsula, as well as a trading centre. Records of sea and overland trade between 1700 and 1850 indicate close trading connections with Sri Lanka and Kerala. During the 1840s, cotton produced in the region was in demand for British mills. The chief exports during British rule were cotton, jaggery, chillies, tobacco, palmyra fibre, salt, dried saltwater fish and cattle.|$|E

The extent it was affected initially was not as severe as that of some of its Asian neighbors.

In 2004, the economy experienced 6.4% GDP growth and 7.1% in 2007, its fastest pace of growth in three decades. Average annual GDP growth per capita for the period 1966–2007 still stands at 1.45% in comparison to an average of 5.96% for the East Asia and the Pacific region as a whole.

5|$|The general {{atmosphere}} of enrichment and satisfaction {{during the period}} <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> in Côte d'Ivoire {{made it possible for}} Houphouët-Boigny to maintain and control internal political tensions. His easygoing authoritarian regime, where political prisoners were almost nonexistent, was well accepted by the population. However, the economic crisis that began in the 1980s caused a sharp decline in living conditions for the middle class and underprivileged urban populations. According to the World Bank, the population living below the poverty threshold went from 11% in 1985 to 31% by 1993. Despite the implementation of certain measures, such as the reduction of the number of young French workers (who worked abroad while serving in the military) from 3,000 to 2,000 in 1986, allowing many jobs to go to young Ivorian graduates, the government failed to control the rising rates of unemployment and bankruptcy in many companies.|$|E

Although the levels of social spending were increased, they remained relatively conservative, with a major priority being placed on constructing paved roads, as well as community spaces such as soccer fields and union buildings. In particular, the government focused on rural infrastructure improvement, to bring roads, running water, and electricity to areas that lacked them.|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} an attempt to produce a {{theoretically}} informed econometric analysis <b>of</b> dynamic regional <b>economic</b> performance. The first paper in this two-part study highlighted the problems and possibilities of translating the propositions contained in six 'soft' theories <b>of</b> local <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> into measurable dimensions and sets of proxy variables that are hypothesized to determine local <b>economic</b> <b>growth.</b> This second paper focuses on issues of econometric-model design and empirical validation. Given the practical limitations imposed by data availability, the 'soft' theories <b>of</b> local <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> are modeled by a simple conditional 'gap' convergence model in which prevailing regional unemployment relativities are determined by a common trend in unemployment and a set of regionally specific variables. The empirical validity of the competing 'soft' theories <b>of</b> local <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> is evaluated by applying test restrictions imposed by the 'soft' theories to a general model specification containing eight regionally specific variables that have been identified as potential drivers <b>of</b> local <b>economic</b> <b>growth.</b> The econometric modeling of Australian data suggests that the processes <b>of</b> regional <b>economic</b> performance might be somewhat different from those specified in individual theoretical models. Significantly, the role of local 'enterprise culture' is revealed [...] built on specialization, technological leadership, human resources, and the local integration of firms [...] though significant caveats are attached to the roles of access to information, institutional support, and interregional trade as promoters <b>of</b> local <b>economic</b> <b>growth.</b> ...|$|R

5|$|There are {{conflicting}} views whether {{improvements in}} technological efficiency and innovation will enable a complete decoupling <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> from environmental degradation. On the one hand, {{it has been}} claimed repeatedly by efficiency experts that resource use intensity (i.e., energy and materials use per unit GDP) could in principle be reduced by at least four or five-fold, thereby allowing for continued economic growth without increasing resource depletion and associated pollution. On the other hand, an extensive historical analysis of technological efficiency improvements has conclusively shown that improvements in {{the efficiency of the}} use of energy and materials were almost always outpaced by economic growth, {{in large part because of}} the rebound effect (conservation) or Jevons Paradox resulting in a net increase in resource use and associated pollution. Furthermore, there are inherent thermodynamic (i.e., second law of thermodynamics) and practical limits to all efficiency improvements. For example, there are certain minimum unavoidable material requirements for growing food, and there are limits to making automobiles, houses, furniture, and other products lighter and thinner without the risk of losing their necessary functions. Since it is both theoretically and practically impossible to increase resource use efficiencies indefinitely, it is equally impossible to have continued and infinite economic growth without a concomitant increase in resource depletion and environmental pollution, i.e., economic growth and resource depletion can be decoupled to some degree over the short run but not the long run. Consequently, long-term sustainability requires the transition to a steady state economy in which total GDP remains more or less constant, as has been advocated for decades by Herman Daly and others in the ecological economics community.|$|E
