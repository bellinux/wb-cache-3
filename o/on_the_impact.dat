5|$|The {{track of}} Tropical Storm Gert was {{slightly}} {{more to the}} north than the National Hurricane Center's initial predictions, giving the storm more time to develop.

5|$|Another bout advertised for {{the event}} was Angle versus Abyss in a Falls Count Anywhere match. At Bound for Glory IV, Angle lost to TNA founder and {{on-screen}} co-owner Jeff Jarrett with Foley as Special Guest Enforcer. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>Impact!</b> after Bound for Glory IV, Angle challenged Jarrett to another match at Turning Point, however, Jarrett refused. Angered by Jarrett's refusal, Angle began assaulting several wrestlers in TNA to persuade Jarrett into accepting the challenge. On the October 23 episode of Impact!, Angle challenged Jarrett again to a rematch, which Jarrett again refused. Jarrett, however, recommended Abyss as Angle's opponent, who was a casualty of Angle's attacks the previous week. On the October 30 episode of Impact!, Angle fought Abyss in a contest which ended in a disqualification after Angle struck Abyss with a steel chair. Following their encounter, a match was promoted pitting Angle against Abyss in a Falls Count Anywhere match at Turning Point.|$|E

5|$|During {{the course}} of the game, the player must acquire twelve Artifacts, which are prizes that are awarded after {{completing}} objectives such as winning minigames or beating bosses. Once having acquired twelve Artifacts, the player is granted access to a table called the Artifact Temple, which places six balls on the table at the same time. To complete the table, twelve different targets must be hit with the balls while they are bombarded by attacks from Meta Ridley, one of the antagonists of the Metroid Prime series. If all of the balls are lost, the table ends; the player does not lose any of the twelve Artifacts already collected but is forced to revisit another table and complete it before being allowed a second attempt at the Artifact Temple. Upon completing the Artifact Temple, access is granted to the final table, Impact Crater. After the player defeats the Metroid Prime creature <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Impact</b> Crater table, the game unlocks a higher difficulty level, Expert mode.|$|E
5|$|In 1967 the Ministry of Transport invited {{construction}} company Freeman Fox, Wilbur Smith Associates (FFWSA) {{to investigate and}} report <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> of the New Town proposals on traffic demand between the proposed New Town site and Wolverhampton, and the best highway solution to meet this demand. The predicted demand was that of 75,000 vehicles per day by 1990 and {{a need for a}} dual 3-lane motorway. Two corridors were identified for a possible new motorway route, and a third option to possibly upgrade existing roads. The route could have followed the A5 Corridor to the M6 South of Gailey, at junction 12, or a new corridor could have been established to the M6, north-east of Featherstone, at junction 11. Additionally, it was proposed that the existing A5 could be upgraded to full dual carriageway grade separated standards together with improvements to the A41 and A464 trunk routes.|$|E
5|$|Manning explores {{these themes}} {{not only in}} her major novels set in Europe and the Middle East, but also in her Irish fiction, The Wind Changes (1937) and eight short stories which were mostly written early in her career. In these works, {{colonialist}} attitudes are reproduced by Manning's stereotyping of Catholic southerners as wild, primitive and undisciplined, while northerners live lives of well-ordered efficiency. Displaced principal characters struggle to find their place in social groups whose values they no longer accept. Manning has also been noted for her direct and early focus <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> {{of the end of}} colonial rule. The Rain Forest (1974) presents a later, highly pessimistic view, satirising British expatriate values on a fictional island. It also critiques those involved in the independence movement, expressing a disillusioned view of the island's future post-independence prospects.|$|E

5|$|Mediterranean tropical-like cyclones, {{sometimes}} referred to as Mediterranean hurricanes or medicanes, are rare meteorological phenomena observed in the Mediterranean Sea. Due to the dry nature of the Mediterranean region, formation of tropical cyclones is infrequent, with only 99recorded tropical-like storms between 1948 and 2011. No agency, however, is officially responsible for monitoring the formation and development of medicanes. Tropical cyclogenesis typically occurs within two separate regions of the sea. The first region, encompassing areas of the western Mediterranean, is more conducive for development than the other, the Ionian Sea to the east. The rough mountainous geography of the region raises additional difficulties despite being favorable for the development of severe weather and convective activity in general, and only with abnormal meteorological circumstances can medicanes form. Numerous studies have been conducted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> of global warming on Mediterranean tropical cyclone formation, generally concluding that fewer yet more intense storms would form.|$|E
5|$|On TNA's first live Monday {{episode of}} Impact! on January 4, 2010, Hardy made {{his return to}} TNA, along with Shannon Moore.

Hardy would make his next appearance for the company on the March 8 episode of Impact!, saving D'Angelo Dinero, Abyss and Hulk Hogan from A.J. Styles, Ric Flair and Desmond Wolfe.

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} studies on climate change and bees examined the species, B. Disinguendus and B. sylvarum between 2000 and 2006 in the UK. The study showed that as the climate of western Europe warmed, these two bee species experienced range declines and narrower climatic niches pushing them to the fringes of their environments. Geographically and climatically we expect this, as climate change continues bees will move and abandon areas of drought and migrate towards the fringes, as this has already been seen within desert oases. Europe has done significant work in tracking bee colony changes within regions. Additional longitudinal surveillance must be conducted in other regions of the globe among a wider array bee species to build the body of research <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> of climate change on bees.|$|E

5|$|Planned by the London Controlling Section, Ironside was {{communicated to}} the Germans via double agents between May and June 1944. Unlike other Bodyguard deceptions, the plan was put across entirely by double agents without support by {{physical}} deception. Agent Bronx took the lead with support from Tate, Rudloff and Garbo. Ironside's story included an initial two-division assault, using Overlord formations, staged out of the United Kingdom. This would then be followed up with six divisions sailing from {{the east coast of}} the United States. Historians disagree <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> of Ironside on German plans. There is no indication that the operation was successful in convincing the Germans of imminent Allied plans to invade the Bay of Biscay. On the other hand, Allied planners attributed the delay of a panzer division moving to Normandy in part to the deception.|$|E
5|$|Shy and {{difficult}} to approach, the nervous shark is harmless to humans. It is occasionally marketed for food. This species is susceptible to being caught incidentally in coastal gillnets, such as the barramundi (Lates calcarifer) gillnet fishery operating off northern Australia. It may also be caught on line gear and in prawn trawls. The Australian nervous shark population {{does not appear to}} be threatened by fishing activities, and there the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Least Concern. No data <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> of fishing are available elsewhere in its range, and thus the IUCN has listed it overall under Data Deficient.|$|E

Whereas the first season mainly focused <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> the surgical field has on the main characters, and the second one provided a detailed perspective on the physicians' private lives, the third season deals with the tough challenges brought by the last phase of the surgeons' internship, combining the professional motif emphasized in the first season, with the complex personal background used in the second. Through the season, several new storylines are introduced, including the arrival of Dane's character, Dr. Mark Sloan, conceived and introduced as an antagonizing presence.|$|E

5|$|Very minimal impact {{occurred}} {{as a result}} from Hurricane Alberto. Dakar, Senegal, received 25mm (1in) of rain as the pre-Alberto tropical wave passed over the city.

Also, from August 12 to August 14, public advisories were issued advising people from Azores to monitor the progress of Hurricane Alberto.
