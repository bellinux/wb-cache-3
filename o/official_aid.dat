5|$|In 1448 and 1451, {{there was}} {{a change in the}} Byzantine and Ottoman leaderships, respectively. Murad II died and was succeeded by Mehmed the Conqueror whilst Constantine XI Palaiologos succeeded John VIII. Constantine XI and Mehmed did not get along well; the former's {{successful}} conquests of Crusader territory in the Peloponnese alarmed the latter, who had since subjugated as vassals the crusaders in the region, and Mehmed had around 40,000 soldiers sent to nullify these gains. Constantine XI threatened to rebel against Mehmed unless certain conditions were met by the Sultan regarding the status quo. Mehmed responded to these threats by building fortifications in the Bosporus and thus closed Constantinople from outside naval assistance. The Ottomans already controlled the land around Constantinople and so they began an assault on the city on 6 April 1453. Despite a union of the Catholic and Orthodox Churches, the Byzantines received no <b>official</b> <b>aid</b> from the Pope or Western Europe, {{with the exception of a}} few soldiers from Venice and Genoa.|$|E

25|$|Most {{monetary}} flows between nations are not counted as aid. These include market-based flows such as foreign direct investments and portfolio investments, remittances from migrant workers {{to their families}} in their home countries, and military aid. In 2009, aid {{in the form of}} remittances by migrant workers in the United States to their international families was twice as large as that country's humanitarian aid. The World Bank reported that, worldwide, foreign workers sent $328 billion from richer to poorer countries in 2008, over twice as much as <b>official</b> <b>aid</b> flows from OECD members. The United States does not count military aid in its foreign aid figures.|$|E

40|$|Using {{country level}} panel data {{over the period}} 1970 â€“ 2011, this paper evaluates the direct as well as {{indirect}} impact of three types of financial flows (foreign direct investment, remittances and <b>official</b> development <b>aid)</b> on the per capita income {{of a group of}} low and middle income countries. The empirical results suggest that the direct effect of <b>official</b> development <b>aid</b> in developing countries is mostly negative. This conclusion also holds when the sample is divided into different regions. All three estimation techniques used (i. e., Ordinary Least Squares, panel fixed effects and system Generalised Method of Moments) yield broadly similar results. We find that <b>official</b> development <b>aid</b> and government spending are complementary and hence, depending on the level of effectiveness of government spending programs, <b>official</b> development <b>aid</b> can have an indirect positive impact on income per capita. On the other hand, both remittances and foreign direct investment appear to have a direct positive and statistically significant effect on per capita income...|$|R

40|$|That {{remittances}} are {{a stable}} source of external finance {{seems to have}} become the received wisdom. In addition, many studies have found remittances to behave counter-cyclically, increasing during crises and times of hardship for the recipient countries. Are remittances reliable macroeconomic stabilizers? To answer this question, the present study examines the stability, cyclicality, and stabilizing impact of remittances {{in comparison with the}} same three features for other foreign-exchange inflows, namely foreign direct investment and <b>official</b> development <b>aid.</b> The analysis is performed at the country and regional levels rather than at the aggregate or global level (on which much of the received wisdom rests), because policymakers are concerned with the impact of remittances in their country rather than at the global level. The main findings for 1980 - 2007 are that in a majority of countries: i) <b>official</b> development <b>aid</b> is more stable than remittances, and remittances are more stable than foreign direct investment; ii) <b>official</b> development <b>aid</b> is counter-cyclical, while remittances are pro-cyclical, although less so than foreign direct investment; and iii) <b>official</b> development <b>aid</b> is stabilizing and remittances are destabilizing, although less so than foreign direct investment. The paper suggests {{that it is necessary to}} examine counter-cyclicality separately from the stabilizing impact, as the former does not seem to always imply the latter.
