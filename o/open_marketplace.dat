5|$|The initial process {{offered by}} Steam Greenlight was panned because while {{developers}} favored the concept, {{the rate of}} games that are eventually approved by Valve is very small. At the time, Valve acknowledged {{that this was a}} problem and believed it could be improved upon it. In January 2013, Newell stated that Valve recognized that its role in Greenlight was perceived as a bottleneck, something the company was planning to eliminate in the future through an <b>open</b> <b>marketplace</b> infrastructure. On the eve of Greenlight's first anniversary, Valve simultaneously approved 100 titles through the Greenlight process to demonstrate this change of direction. While the Greenlight service had helped to bring more and varied games onto Steam without excessive bureaucracy, it also led to an excessively large number of games on the service that make it difficult for a single title to stand out, and as early as 2014, Valve had discussed plans to phase out the Greenlight process in favor of providing developers with easier means to put their games onto the Steam service.|$|E

2500|$|Unlike other Yoruba {{cities with}} {{traditional}} kingship institutions however, In Ibadan, the warrior class became {{the rulers of}} the city as well as the most important economic group. [...] According to HRH Sir Isaac Babalola Akinyele, the late Olubadan (king) of Ibadan (Olu Ibadan means 'Lord of Ibadan'), in his authoritative book on the history of Ibadan, Iwe Itan Ibadan (1911), the first city was destroyed due to an incident at an Egungun (masquerade) festival when an Egungun was accidentally disrobed and derisively mocked by women and children in an <b>open</b> <b>marketplace</b> full of people. The then Alaafin of Oyo had ordered the old city destroyed for the act. [...] Lagelu was by now an old, frail man; he could not stop the destruction of his city, but he and some of his people survived the attack and fled to a nearby hill for sanctuary. On the hill they survived by eating oro fruit and snails; later, they cultivated the land and made corn and millets into pap meals known as oori or eko, which they ate with roasted snails. They improvised a bit by using the snail shells to drink the liquefied eko. Ultimately, Lagelu and his people came down from the hill and founded another city, called Eba'dan.|$|E

It is an interactive process of knowledge generation and transfer between {{internal and external}} firms. However, the search for an external partner can be time consuming and costly. <b>Open</b> innovation <b>marketplaces</b> broker relationships between seekers and solvers of challenges. Seekers have a problem which they need to solve and solvers are a community of people with the right skills to discover innovative ideas to address them. Despite the assistance of <b>open</b> innovation <b>marketplaces,</b> the process of matching seekers and solvers remains a challenge. It will be argued in this article that expertise recommender systems in an <b>open</b> innovation <b>marketplace</b> can facilitate finding the “right partner” leading to benefits {{not only for the}} seeker and the solver but also for the marketplace. With this aim, a list of appropriated dimensions to be considered for the expertise recommender system are defined. An illustrative example is also provided. Preprin...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper offers}} a {{paradigmatic}} analysis of digital application marketplaces for advancing information systems (IS) research on digital platforms and ecosystems. We {{refer to the}} notion of digital application marketplace, colloquially called “appstores,” as a platform component that offers a venue for exchanging applications between developers and end-users belonging to a single or multiple ecosystems. Such marketplaces exhibit diversity in features and assumptions, and we propose that examining this diversity, and its ideal types, will help us to further understand the relationship between application marketplaces, platforms, and platform ecosystems. To this end, we generate a typology that distinguishes four kinds of digital application marketplaces: closed, censored, focused, and <b>open</b> <b>marketplaces.</b> The paper also offers implications for actors wishing to make informed decisions about their relationship to a particular digital application marketplace...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAs mobile {{computing}} becomes {{an integral part}} of the modern user experience, malicious applications have infiltrated <b>open</b> <b>marketplaces</b> for mobile platforms. Malware apps stealthily launch operations to retrieve sensitive user or device data or abuse system resources. We describe a highly accurate classification approach for detecting malicious Android apps. Our method statically extracts a data-flow feature on how user inputs trigger sensitive API invocations, a property referred to as the user-trigger dependence. Our evaluation with 1433 malware apps and 2684 free popular apps gives a classification accuracy (2. 1 % false negative rate and 2. 0 % false positive rate) that is better than, or at least competitive against, the state-of-the-art. Our method also discovers new malicious apps in the Google Play market that cannot be detected by virus scanning tools. Our thesis in this mobile app classification work is to advocate the approach of benign property enforcement, i. e., extracting unique behavioral properties from benign programs and designing corresponding classification policies...|$|R
