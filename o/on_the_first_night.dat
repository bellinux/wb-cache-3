5|$|After Arias' {{death in}} 1988, Endara became a leading {{opponent}} of the Manuel Noriega military dictatorship, heading the opposition coalition in the 1989 presidential election. Though his coalition was judged by international observers as having defeated pro-Noriega candidate Carlos Duque, the results were annulled by the government, and Endara and his running mates were attacked in the streets by the paramilitary Dignity Battalions. The assaults received widespread coverage in international media, helping to build support within the U.S. for military action against Noriega. Seven months later, the United States invaded Panama, and swore in Endara as the new president <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>night</b> of the invasion on a U.S. military base.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the road}} had been opened between Yudam-ni and Hagaru-ri, the convoy {{still had to}} fight through the {{numerous}} Chinese positions on the hills overlooking the road. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>night</b> of the retreat, the Chinese struck the convoy in force and inflicted heavy casualties upon 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines (3/5). Although strong air cover suppressed most of the Chinese forces {{for the rest of}} the march, the cold weather, harassing fire, raiding parties, and road blocks slowed the retreat to a crawl while inflicting numerous casualties. Despite those difficulties, the convoy reached Hagaru-ri in an orderly fashion on the afternoon of 3 December, with the withdrawal completed on 4 December.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, for the North Vietnamese {{the battle}} was {{just one part of}} the May Offensive, {{although}} they later claimed to have killed 800 Australians during a single attack—a fact which may have indicated the importance they placed on it at the time. They had reacted quickly and proficiently to mount a battalion attack <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>night</b> in an attempt to push the Australians off their line of communications; however, while the attacks on Coral and Balmoral had been well co-ordinated, the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong had repeatedly surrendered the element of surprise with preparatory fire and poor light discipline alerting the defenders on each occasion. Meanwhile, rigid command-and-control arrangements and a lack of radio communications had forced the North Vietnamese to operate on fixed schedules, preventing them from taking the initiative or responding rapidly to changing situations. Such inflexibility had resulted in predictability, with the communist commanders ultimately committing their forces to a frontal assault on Coral <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>night,</b> and mounting very similar attacks against Balmoral on the nights of 26 and 28 May, both of which ended in costly failures.|$|E

By mid-February, Army engineers had completed an airfield on the island, after which attacks on the island by the Japanese became less frequent.|$|E

For Wood, the greatest benefit was that the BBC gave him twice as much rehearsal time as he had previously enjoyed. He now had a daily rehearsal and extra rehearsals as needed. He was also allowed extra players when large scores called for them, instead of having to rescore the work for the forces available.|$|E

Foods containing ḥametz– leaven or yeast– may not be eaten during Passover. This means bread, pastries and certain fermented beverages, such as beer, cannot be consumed. Ashkenazim also do not eat legumes, known as kitniyot. Over the centuries, Jewish cooks have developed dishes using alternative ingredients and this characterizes Passover food in Israel today.|$|E

5|$|A {{possible}} {{legend of}} Prince Vladimir was recorded by Branislav Nušić in the 19th {{century in the}} city of Korçë, southeastern Albania, close to Macedonia. Ruins on top of a hill above Korçë were said to be remains of the court of a Latin (Catholic) king, whose kingdom neighbored the state of an Orthodox emperor. The king asked the hand of the emperor's daughter, who agreed to become his wife only if he built an Orthodox church. He did so, and she married him, but <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>night</b> of marriage she killed him. She then became a nun, and the king's body was taken somewhere—he was not buried near his court. Macedonian Slavs inhabiting Saint Achillius Island in the Small Prespa Lake in Greece told of an emperor named Mirče. He lived on their island, where he was killed by a cousin of his out of jealousy, and his body was taken via Ohrid to Albania.|$|E

40|$|Sleep {{is thought}} to {{participate}} in the consolidation of recent memory traces. We tested this hypothesis in humans by using functional neuroimaging (functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography). <b>First,</b> following <b>the</b> training procedural visuo-motor learning task (pursuit task), total sleep deprivation <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> post-training <b>night</b> significantly deteriorates the gain in performance, which is usually observed after one complete night of sleep. In parallel, sleep deprivation hampers the changes in functional segregation and connectivity, which underpin the gain in performance usually observed in subjects allowed to sleep <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> post-training <b>night.</b> Second, following <b>the</b> training <b>on</b> an implicit memory task (probabilistic serial reaction time task), some brain areas are reactivated during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> post-training <b>night.</b> <b>The</b> reactivation was shown {{to be related to the}} processing of high-level material and to be modulated by the amount of learning achieved during the training session. These changes in activity do not involve isolated brain areas but entire macroscopic cortico-subcortical networks. Taken together, the results suggest an off-line processing of recent memory traces during sleep. Key words: functional neuroimaging, memory, plasticity, sleep...|$|R
5|$|Edward {{had been}} invited to stay at Tranby Croft, Yorkshire, the home of Arthur Wilson and his family. Among Edward's party were his advisers, Lord Coventry and Lieutenant-General Owen Williams; Gordon-Cumming, a friend of the prince, was also invited. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>night</b> the guests played baccarat, and Stanley Wilson thought he saw Gordon-Cumming {{illegally}} adding to his stake. Stanley informed other members of the Wilson family, and they agreed to watch him on the following evening. Gordon-Cumming was again seen to be acting in a suspicious manner. The family members asked the advice of the royal courtiers who, with the agreement of the prince, confronted Gordon-Cumming and pressured him into signing a document that declared he would never play cards again, in exchange for the silence of the guests.|$|E

Speculation in the press suggested that his collapse had been the result of excessive alcohol and drug use, but the band claimed that he had simply overeaten.|$|E

60|$|Once {{beyond the}} forest {{they were in}} an undulating country, the hills {{sometimes}} rising to a considerable height.

Time was no object to them, and they made but short journeys, for the Russian, who had never been accustomed to walk long distances, had blistered both his feet badly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>night's</b> journey, and <b>the</b> subsequent travelling had added to <b>the</b> inflammation. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> fourth evening they halted for <b>the</b> night <b>on</b> a little rivulet, after making only five or six miles.|$|R

5|$|When Birdwood {{took over}} {{command of the}} newly formed Dardanelles Army, Godley became {{commander}} of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps for {{the final stages of}} the Gallipoli campaign and was promoted to temporary lieutenant general on 25 November 1915. With his appointment as corps commander, he also effectively took over responsibility for the administration of the AIF. The same month it was decided to evacuate the Allied forces from Gallipoli. Although much of the detailed planning for the evacuation was left to his Chief of Staff, Brigadier General Brudenell White, Godley closely inspected the plans before giving his approval. The evacuation was successfully carried out on the nights of 19 and 20 December, with Godley departing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>night.</b> Following the withdrawal, he was made Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath for his services at Gallipoli, on the recommendation of General Sir Charles Monro, who had replaced Hamilton as Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force.|$|E
5|$|As winter passed, in {{an effort}} to shorten their lines and move into {{prepared}} positions, the Germans fell back towards the Hindenburg Line. After the Allies advanced to follow up the withdrawal, the battalion fought its first major battle of 1917 in early April, around Bullecourt, where the 4th Brigade attacked as a complete formation {{for the first time since}} Gallipoli. Committed without the protection of an artillery barrage, expecting tank support to win the day, the 4th Brigade suffered heavy casualties; <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>night,</b> the tanks broke down and on the second, they had proven unable to breach the enemy defences, leaving the infantry to force their way through. After less than 10 hours of fighting, 2,339 soldiers from the 4th lay dead or wounded, out of 3,000 committed, including 400 from the 15th; by the end of the attack, only 52 men from the battalion's assault force remained uninjured. They were subsequently withdrawn from the line back to farmland around the village of Doulien where the battalion was rebuilt, eventually reaching a strength of 719 personnel of all ranks.|$|E
