If {{agent-based}} {{applications are}} {{to be used in}} large scale, <b>open</b> <b>environments,</b> <b>security</b> is a main issue; digital identity management (DIDM) an essential element. DIDM is needed to be able to determine the rights and obligations of the four main computational entities in such systems: agent platforms, hosts, agents, and services. The framework for evaluation of DIDM in agent systems proposed in this paper is based on four aspects of DIDM: representation, confidentiality, integrity and availability. Two agent platforms (JADE-S and AgentScape) are used to illustrate the potential of this framework. ...|$|R

In today’s era, it is most interesting and enticing technology which is offering the services to its users on demand over the internet.

Even though the Cloud Computing is promising and efficient, there are many challenges for data security as there is no vicinity of the data for the Cloud user.

40|$|ABSTRACT – Cloud {{computing}} hottest {{research area}} {{due to its}} ability to reduce {{the costs associated with}} computing. Data applications are a great benefit to organizations, business, companies and many large scale and small scale industries. Cloud computing security is developing at very rapid pace which include computer security, network security, information security and data privacy. Cloud computing plays very vital role in protecting data, application and the related infrastructure with the help of policies, technologies, controls, and data tools. Since Cloud Computing stores the data and disseminated resources in the <b>open</b> <b>environment,</b> <b>security</b> has become the main obstacle which is hampering the deployment of Cloud environments. Cloud computing’s main benefits include resource consolidation, uniform management, and cost-effective operation; for the cloud user, benefits include on-demand capacity, low cost of ownership, and flexible pricing. However, the feature that brings such benefits, such as sharing and consolidation, also introduce security and privacy problems. Security and privacy issues resulting from the illegal and unethical use of information, and causing disclosure of confidential information, can significantly hinder user acceptance of cloud-based services...|$|R
40|$|Examination of <b>security</b> <b>environment</b> in many <b>security</b> {{papers and}} studies is focused {{primarily}} on analysis of external <b>security</b> <b>environment</b> of different countries. Analyzing the current security problems led us {{to the realization that}} the <b>security</b> <b>environment</b> is characterized by a systemic arrangement in which there are systems of lower and higher order. We want to demonstrate that to ensure safety of the reference object at a lower level (e. g., small social groups, individuals) it is important to evaluate the <b>security</b> <b>environment</b> of the lower order (i. e., at sub-regional, local and sub-local level). Defining and analyzing <b>security</b> <b>environment</b> at lower levels is a prerequisite for creating effective situational prevention strategies and for improving personal safety of citizens and their property...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedPopular consensus exists that the 2007 surge of U. S. forces in Iraq {{led to an}} improved <b>security</b> <b>environment.</b> The surge was designed to reduce violence and improve security by protecting the Iraqi population - a change in strategy. According to the consensus, the <b>security</b> <b>environment</b> improved due to the surge, measured by {{the decreasing number of}} attacks. For this thesis, the <b>security</b> <b>environment</b> consists of the number of attacks and their lethality, supported by data from the Congressional Research Service. This thesis compares the timelines of the surge forces with the numbers of attacks, the lethality of those attacks, and with factors other than the surge that may have improved the <b>security</b> <b>environment.</b> This thesis argues that the surge and associated strategy may have hastened improvement to the <b>security</b> <b>environment,</b> but they were neither necessary nor sufficient for the improvements in the <b>security</b> <b>environment.</b> Several theories and conflict models offer insight into how improvement in the <b>security</b> <b>environment</b> occurred: through efforts that countered insurgent sanctuary and social support, and consequently decreased the lethality of insurgent attacks. This analysis reveals that the political efforts of the Iraqi government and grass roots movements were the necessary and sufficient conditions for improvement. US Army (USA) author...|$|R

40|$|As {{networking}} technologies evolve {{and business}} needs change, traditionally isolated and secure communication networks are {{giving way to}} more <b>open</b> computing <b>environments.</b> <b>Security,</b> network and systems administrators must therefore concern themselves not only with firewall and boundary security, but also with individual system security. Security administration in a large open network is a challenging assignment and requires a combination of auditing, assessment and compliance mechanisms. For very large networks, automation is another variable which is critical to consider in this equation. There are several tools available to assess the security of networks and systems; however, there are few freely available solutions for addressing the problems that these analysis tools detect. This paper describes the changing network security paradigm and discusses what tools are available for identifying security vulnerabilities in an open network environment. It goes on to state {{the problem that we}} faced at Sun and describes the suite of tools that we have designed and implemented as a solution, focusing on the automation of system security assessment and compliance.
