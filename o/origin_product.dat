40|$|As the world`s {{population}} is constantly growing, food security will {{remain on the}} policy Agenda, particularly in Africa. At the same time, global food systems experience a new wave focusing on local foods and food sovereignty featuring high quality food products of verifiable geographical origin. This article argues that Geographical Indications (GI´s) hold the potential to help transform the Tanzanian agriculture-dependent economy through the tapping of value from unique products, attributing taste and colour to place or regional geography. This study aims to identify the existence and characteristics of food <b>origin</b> <b>products</b> in Tanzania that have potential for GI certification. The hypothesis was that there are <b>origin</b> <b>products</b> in Tanzania whose unique characteristics {{are linked to the}} area of production. Geographical indications can be useful policy instruments contributing to food security and sovereignty and quality within an efficient marketing system with the availability of government support, hence the need to identify key candidates for GI certification. Five Tanzanian <b>origin</b> <b>products</b> were selected from 14 candidate agricultural products through a scoping study. Rice from Kyela, Aloe vera, Coffee and Sugar from Kilimanjaro and Cloves from Zanzibar are some of the product cases investigated and provides for in-depth case study, as ´landscape´ products incorporating ´taste of place´. Interviews were conducted to collect quantitative and qualitative data. Data was collected on the production area, product quality perceived by the consumer in terms of taste, flavour, texture, aroma, appearance (colour, size) and perceptions of links between geography related factors (soil, land weather characteristics) and product qualities. A qualitative case study analysis was done for each of the (five) selected Tanzanian <b>origin</b> <b>products</b> investigated with plausible prospects for Tanzania to leapfrog into exports of Geographical Indications products. Framework conditions for producers creating or capturing market value as stewards of cultural and landscape values, environments, and institutional requirements for such creation or capturing to happen, including presence of export opportunities, are discussed. Geographical indication is believed to allow smallholders to create employment and build monetary value, while stewarding local food cultures and natural environments and resources, and increasing the diversity of supply of natural and unique quality products and so contribute to enhanced food security...|$|R

In this study we investigated the characteristics of western European field isolates of infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV) to gain more information on their diversity. The examined 104 isolates, collected from acute outbreaks during the last 35 years, originated from eight different countries: Switzerland (48), Germany (21), Sweden (14), the United Kingdom (9), Italy (5), Belgium (4), Austria (2), and Norway (1). Two vaccines, a chicken embryo <b>origin</b> <b>product</b> and a tissue culture <b>origin</b> <b>product,</b> {{were included in the}} survey. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to amplify a 2. 1 -kb DNA fragment of ILTV using primers generated for the thymidine kinase (TK) gene. After digestion of the resulting PCR products by restriction endonuclease HaeIII, restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis was carried out. PCR amplicons of three field isolates and both vaccine strains were selected for sequencing. Here 98 field isolates showed the same cleavage pattern and were identical to both vaccine strains (clone 1). They differed from five Swiss isolates with identical cleavage pattern (clone 2) and one Swedish isolate (clone 3). The present study demonstrated that at least three clones of ILTV have been circulating in western Europe during the last 35 years. The 104 isolates analyzed showed a high genetic similarity regarding the TK gene, and a large majority of the field isolates (98 / 104) were genetically related to the vaccine strains...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to investigate, in an emerging market, consumer attitudes towards local and foreign brand purchases {{against a background of}} factors like Culture, Country of <b>Origin,</b> <b>Product</b> quality and services. A comprehensive model broadens knowledge on consumer behaviour by incorporating the above mentioned factors. Design/methodology/approach- India is the emerging market studied. A total of 18 respondents were interviewed face-to-face using a semi structured questionnaire in the city of Mumbai and Indian students studying in the United Kingdom. Findings- It was found that the quality of global brands was perceived to be generally higher and superior to local brands. Most consumers also associated greater accessibility of foreign brands in the Indian market with better quality at lower prices. Indian consumers were not prejudiced against foreign brand names. In fact, they evaluated them higher on technology, quality, status and esteem than Indian brands and attributed higher credibility to those countries of origin...|$|E

The researcher has been using students from the special province of Yogyakarta as sample. Results indicate a significant difference between attitudes toward localized and adapted commercials of the same brand. Indonesian generally prefers standardized commercials. However this preference did not affect automatically their attitudes toward the brand itself or the purchase intention. Furthermore, standardized commercials are more likely to gain acceptance in the case of non durable products. Consumers express more positive attitudes toward the standardized commercial in the case of less familiar brands, and when it uses transformational appeals in its execution style. ...|$|E

The {{objective of this}} study is to determine how display size, point-of-purchase material, product <b>origin,</b> <b>product</b> information and display placement impact consumer expenditures for fresh apples and pears. These variables were incorporated into a non-linear Almost Ideal Demand System with share equations for Gala, Fuji, Red Delicious, Other Sweet Apples, Tart Apples, and Pears. Forty-four weeks of data on weekly store sales were collected from two grocery stores in the Portland, Oregon metropolitan area. Share influences and elasticities are provided for price inputs and for other variables where appropriate. Product origin, e. g. state and national, influenced consumers' expenditures for Red Delicious apples and pears; it was insignificant in other share equations. Product information, e. g. tart or sweet, only influenced expenditures on apple varieties that are less familiar to the consumer. The size of point-of-purchase material had a significant effect on expenditures as did display sizes to a lesser extent. This research provided valuable information to produce managers and apple and pear producers on factors that influence consumers' expenditures at the retail level...|$|E
