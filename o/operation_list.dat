50|$|It is not {{possible}} to consider time as an additional spatial dimension. To illustrate this suppose we map the dimension of time onto an axis of space. The data structure we will use to add the spatial time dimension is a min-heap. Let the y axis represent the key values of the items within the heap and the x axis is the spatial time dimension. After several insertions and delete-min operations (all done non-retroactively) our min-heap would appear like in figure 1. Now suppose we retroactively insert zero {{to the beginning of the}} <b>operation</b> <b>list.</b> Our min-heap would appear like in figure 2. Notice how the single operation produces a cascading effect which affects the entire data structure. Thus we can see that while time can be drawn as a spatial dimension, operations with time involved produces dependence which have a ripple when modifications are made with respect to time.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we explore}} the {{complexity}} of mapping filtering streaming applications on large-scale homogeneous and heterogeneous platforms, with a particular emphasis on communication models and their impact. Filtering applications are streaming applications where each node also has a selectivity which either increases or decreases {{the size of its}} input data set. This selectivity makes the problem of scheduling these applications more challenging than the more studied problem of scheduling "non-filtering" streaming workflows. We address {{the complexity of}} the following two problems: Evaluation: Given a mapping of nodes to processors, how can one compute the period and latency? Optimization: Given a filtering workflow, how can one compute the mapping and schedule that minimize the period or latency? A solution to this problem requires generating both the mapping and the associated <b>operation</b> <b>list</b> [...] the order in which each processor executes its assigned tasks. We address this general problem in two steps. First, we address the simplified model without communication cost. In this case, the evaluation problems are easy, and the optimization problems have polynomial complexity on homogeneous platforms. However, we show that the optimization problems become NP-hard on heterogeneous platforms. Second, we consider platforms with communication costs. Clearly, due to the previous results, the optimization problems on heterogeneous platforms are still NP-hard. Therefore we come back to homogeneous platforms and extend the framework with three significant realistic communication models. Now even evaluation problems become difficult, because the mapping must now be enriched with an <b>operation</b> <b>list</b> that provides the time-steps at which each computation and each communication occurs in the system: determining the best <b>operation</b> <b>list</b> has a combinatorial nature. Not too surprisingly, optimization problems are NP-hard too.

Cardioplegic solution and its ingredients are thus of utmost importance in cardioprotection. An ideal protection will help the heart return into its normal function after CABG. This research compared the cardioprotective effects of adding either N-acetylcysteine (NAC) to Cardioplegic solution with infusion of glucoseinsulin-potassium (GIK) in patients with low ejection fraction (EF). In a double-blind randomized clinical trial, 60 elective CABG patients with EF < 50 % were evaluated.

40|$|Background: There {{has been}} an {{increase}} in day case surgery for children worldwide, but there have been few reports of the practice (most of them being retrospective) by many of the surgical sub-specialties in the sub-region. The aim {{of this study was to}} document our experience with day case inguinal hernia surgery in a developing economy. Materials and Methods: This was a prospective study of uncomplicated inguinal hernias treated as day case at OAUTHC between April 2004 and December 2004. Data were collected and analysed. Results: Eighty-eight patients were recruited into the study and none defaulted. There were 88 patients, (M:F = 16. 6 : 1). A majority (n = 54) of the hernias occurred on the right side, while just a few (n = 18) occurred on the left. There were 5 cases of wound infections giving an infection rate of 4. 8 &#x 0025;.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} our unit’s theatre throughput efficiency, {{to identify}} where inefficiencies existed and consequently where the greatest improvement might be made. To identify {{the causes of}} day of surgery cancellations and how they might be avoided.  Patients and Methods: A prospective audit of theatre utilisation was undertaken over a 6 month period between 05 / 02 // 2013 and 02 / 08 / 2013 at Ipswich General Hospital, QLD, Australia. Times collected were: time of patient arrival in anaesthetic bay, start time of operative procedure, end time of operative procedure, and time of patient leaving theatre. The causative factors for any delays or day of surgery cancellations were identified and recorded where possible.  Results: In the six month period 26, 850 sessional minutes were available for elective operating over 100 operating sessions. 304 elective cases were performed, split between 21 major and 283 minor procedures The sessions ran overtime a cumulative 2114 minutes. Total non-operative minutes totalled 13, 209 (50. 3 % of all available time), split between late starts 499 minutes (1. 8 %), early list finishes 1894 minutes (7. 05 %),  changeover time 1869 minutes (6. 9 %) and anaesthetic time, 8974 minutes (33. 4 %) Actual operating time only compromised 50. 7 % of all available elective operating session time (13, 614 minutes) Theatre utilisation was 91. 8 %. 51 procedures were cancelled {{on the day of}} surgery during the audit period, representing 14. 3 % of all scheduled procedures. The most common reason for cancellation was lack of surgical fitness, followed by inadequate operative time.  Conclusion:  A significant proportion of all elective operative time was consumed by non-operative minutes. Inefficiencies existed in turnover of patients as well as over as well as underbooking of patients on elective lists.

40|$|Implementation {{of complex}} {{discrete}} event fabrication processes can be considerably simplified {{by use of}} general reusable software modules representing the physical components. At the same time, construction of the control system can be facilitated by applying the supervisory control theory for the automatic generation of control laws. These two aspects can be joined into a general concept with object-oriented modeling and control law synthesis as foundations. The goal is to allow an operator to specify operation lists describing the required sequences {{of operations for the}} manufacturing of the product, independently of constraints given by a specific plant. With a suitable model of the capabilities and constraints of the resources of that plant, a product route can be automatically generated from the <b>operation</b> <b>list.</b> Such a product route describes all available paths through the system, for each type of product, irrespective of any other type of product that may be simultaneously present within the production system. Given a set of product routes and a model of the plant, control laws guaranteeing production according to those product specifications can be synthesized. Based on the supervisory control theory, using interleaved product routes as specification, we show how such control laws can be synthesized. An added complexity is that the specification becomes non-deterministic, {{in the sense that the}} same string of events can lead to different system states. We show that the supervisory control theory can be used with non-deterministic specifications assuming certain properties. An algorithm for synthesis of a non-deterministic supervisor is presented. We also describe an object-oriented modeling approach to discrete event fabrication processes. It is shown that the properties that have been defined as necessary for the non-deterministic supervisory approach are immediate by the modeling approach. Thus, we show that the approach to non-deterministic supervisory control can be combined with object-oriented modeling techniques, and so we have a powerful framework for implementing control of large and complex discrete event fabrication processes...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Adequate {{post-operative}} {{pain relief}} following total knee replacement (TKR) {{is very important}} to optimal post-operative recovery. Faster mobilisation and rehabilitation ultimately results in optimum recovery outcomes, but pain is often the limiting factor. This study evaluates the potential clinical benefit of the InterX neurostimulation device on pain reduction and rehabilitative outcome. Methods A clinical trial under the Hywel Dda Clinical Audit Committee to validate the clinical benefit of Non-invasive Interactive Neurostimulation (NIN) therapy using the InterX device was performed in patients undergoing TKR. 61 patients were randomised to treatment groups in blocks of two from the Theatre <b>Operation</b> <b>List.</b> The control group received the standard hospital course of pain medication and rehabilitation twice daily for 3 post-op days. The experimental group received 8 sessions of NIN therapy over 3 post-op days in addition to the standard course received by the Control group. Pain and range of motion were collected as the primary study measures. Results Sixty one subjects were enrolled and randomised, but 2 subjects (one/group) were excluded due to missing data at Baseline/Final; one subject in the InterX group was excluded due to pre-existing rheumatoid pain conditions confounding the analysis. The experimental group pre- to post-session Verbal Rating Scale for pain (VRS) showed that NIN therapy consistently reduced the pain scores by a mean of 2. 3 points (SE 0. 11). The NIN pre-treatment score at Final was used for the primary ANCOVA comparison, demonstrating a significantly greater cumulative treatment effect of a mean 2. 2 (SE 0. 49) points pain reduction (p = 0. 002). Control subjects only experienced a mean 0. 34 (SE 0. 49) point decrease in pain. Ninety degrees ROM was required to discharge the patient and this was attained as an average despite the greater Baseline deficit in the InterX group. Eight control patients and three experimental patients did not achieve this ROM. Conclusions The results clearly demonstrated the clinical benefit of NIN therapy as a supplement to the standard rehabilitation protocol. The subjects receiving InterX fared significantly better clinically. Within a relatively short 3 -day period of time, patients in the experimental group obtained the necessary ROM for discharge and did it experiencing lower levels of pain than those in the control group. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background: Surgical care is an {{essential}} component of health care of children worldwide. Incidences of congenital anomalies, trauma, cancers and acquired diseases continue to rise and along with that the impact of surgical intervention on public health system also increases. It then becomes essential that the surgical teams make the procedures safe and error proof. The World Health Organization (WHO) has instituted the surgical checklist as a global initiative to improve surgical safety. Aims: To assess the acceptance, application and adherence to the WHO Safe Surgery Checklist in Pediatric Surgery Practice at a university teaching hospital. Materials and Methods: In a prospective study, spanning 2 years, the checklist was implemented for all patients who underwent operative procedures under general anesthesia. The checklist identified three phases of an operation, each corresponding to a specific period in the normal flow of work: Before the induction of anesthesia ("sign in"), before the skin incision ("time out") and before the patient leaves the operating room ("sign out"). In each phase, an anesthesiologist,-"checklist coordinator," confirmed that the anesthesia, surgery and nursing teams have completed the listed tasks before proceeding with the operation and exit. The checklist was used for 3000 consecutive patients. Results: No major perioperative errors were noted. In 54 (1. 8 %) patients, children had the same names and identical surgical procedure posted on the same <b>operation</b> <b>list.</b> The patient identification tag was missing in four (0. 1 %) patients. Mention of the side of procedures was missing in 108 (3. 6 %) cases. In 0. 1 % (3) of patients there was mix up of the mention of side of operation in the case papers and consent forms. In 78 (2. 6 %) patients, the consent form was not signed by parents/guardians or the side of the procedure was not quoted. Antibiotic orders were missing in five (0. 2 %) patients. In 12 (0. 4 %) cases, immobilization of the patients was suboptimal, which led to displacement of diathermy grounding pad. In 54 (1. 8 %) patients, the checklist was not used at all. In 76 (2. 5 %) patients the checklist was found to be incompletely filled. Conclusions: Our study supports the use of the checklist as {{an essential}} safety tool and reinforcement of the same. The checklist may act as a valuable prompt to focus the team, to ensure that even the simple things have been cared for...|$|E

40|$|Background : The general {{observation}} that children achieve better convalescence {{in the home}} environment supports the need for adoption of day case surgery, which is gaining considerable acceptance in developing countries. Pediatric surgical service is in great demand in developing countries, and in-patient beds and surgical supplies are insufficient. Method : A prospective collection of data on all pediatric day surgeries (PDSs) by the pediatric surgical unit University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital (UITH, Ilorin, was done. Parents had pre-operative outpatient briefing and postoperative interviews on the second and ninth days for consultation regarding post-operative complications and events at home. Study period was between April 2005 and September 2007 (2 &# 189; years). Results : Of the 660 elective cases, 449 (68. 02 &#x 0025;) children were recruited as day cases. The male-to-female ratio was 14. 3 : 1. Age ranged between 20 days and 15 years {{with a mean of}} 37. 6 months and standard deviation (SD) of 34. 4 months. Congenital hernias/ hydroceles were the highest indications (71. 2 &#x 0025;), followed by lump/ masses (12. 9 &#x 0025;), undescended testes (8. 7 &#x 0025;), umbilical hernias (4. 8 &#x 0025;) and thyroglossal duct cyst (2. 5 &#x 0025;). In 98. 9 &#x 0025; of cases, the parents resided within 20 km radius of the hospital, and 91. 5 &#x 0025; of them could reach the hospital within 1 hour. Fathers and mothers of 80. 1 &#x 0025; and 77. 1 &#x 0025; of children, respectively, had above-primary education. More than half of the fathers (55 &#x 0025;) were civil servants, while 30 &#x 0025; were self-employed. The mothers were civil servants in 37. 3 &#x 0025; of cases, and 34 &#x 0025; were self-employed. The average number of outpatient clinic visits before surgery was 2 - 3 visits (41. 2 &#x 0025;) with mean interval to surgery of 4 - 5 weeks (60. 3 &#x 0025;). Logistics (investigations and availability of <b>operation</b> <b>list)</b> and patient&#x 2032;s fitness for surgery were statistically significant delay factors (P = 0. 001). Conclusion : Parents reported 14 children to be irritable at home due to pain, while the others reported satisfactory day case experience. No unplanned admission or mortality was recorded, and only 3 (0. 8 &#x 0025;) parents would not recommend day case surgery to other people. Conclusion: Pediatric day case surgery is feasible for well-selected and monitored cases in our environment. Term neonates with informed parents are suitable for pediatric day case surgery.

40|$|In coastal {{countries}} like Vietnam, sea transportation has always contributed {{greatly to the}} development of the national economy. The development of sea transportation depends on many factors. Among these factors marine traffic safety in ports and adjacent waterways is one which directly influences this development. The launch of the Vessel Traffic Service (VTS) has contributed significantly to improving safety in waterways such as harbor waters, fairways and straits which have high traffic density. After six months of official operation, the Vung Tau VTS Center in Vietnam has helped to reduce the number of accidents in the VTS area by 60 %, compared to the same period in the previous year, 2012. However, the rate of accidents related to traffic in the Vung Tau VTS area is still high, about 70 % of total accidents. It is because of the ?쐂is-order??traffic in the waterway. Navigation assistance and traffic organization are two of the main functions of a VTS system. So that improving the effectiveness of the Vung Tau VTS Center in these two functions is one of the feasible and effective solutions to solve this problem. After studying the work of VTS officers (VTSO), it was found that the key factor in deciding the performance of a VTSO is his/her ability to assess the risk of vessels. In fact, at all VTS centers this process totally depends on the assessment of the VTSO. These assessment results greatly depend on human factors such as working experience, working conditions, human error, etc. An effective solution for this problem is the application of a quantitative risk assessment model to evaluate the risk of a vessel?셲 traffic safety. For this reason this dissertation researches and develops the Real Time Supporting System (RTSS) for VTS officers. It is able to help VTSOs determine the collision risk of vessels quantitatively and alert vessels which have un-acceptable risk of collision. In addition, the RTSS is also able to alert vessels which have the possibility of going aground or being off-route or over-speed. This RTSS was designed for application in the Vung Tau VTS Center to improve marine traffic safety in the three main fairways in the Vung Tau Waterway. It will contribute to the economic development of the Important Triangular Economic Zone in the southern part of Vietnam (Ho Chi Minh City, Dong Nai Province, and Ba Ria-Vung Tau Province). For the purpose of this research a survey of traffic in the Vung Tau Waterway was conducted. Traffic environment factors were studied and statistical data of marine traffic and marine accidents in the waterway were collected. To find the assessment model most appropriate for the Vung Tau Waterway, this data was then analyzed, evaluated, and compared using various methods such as evaluation based on experts??surveys or based on assessment models, comparison evaluation results with statistical data, etc. Results showed that the PARK model (Potential Assessment of Risk model, developed in Korea) is the most appropriate model for the Vung Tau Waterway. This RTSS was developed based on this model. Its functions and user interface were designed according to survey responses of VTSOs in the Vung Tau VTS Center. After development this RTSS has gone into trial operation at the Vung Tau VTS Center where it obtainned data about traffic through the AIS (Automatic Identification System) receiver device. Then the feedback of VTS officers was collected and analyzed for further study on improving the RTSS. The findings of the dissertation are summarized as follows: 1. The affects of marine environment factors such as winds, currents, tides, waves, fog, rain, width and depth of waterway on marine traffic safety were analyzed. It was found that they have a small negative affect on traffic safety in the Vung Tau Waterway 2. Through traffic survey and quantitative assessment by the IWRAP model, it was found that the ?쐂is-order??movement of traffic in this area by ocean vessels, barges, tug boats, fishing boats, etc. is the main factor which affects traffic safety in this waterway. This problem can be looked into by many ways. However, an effective and feasible solution is improving the effectiveness of the Vung Tau VTS Center 3. The effectiveness of the Vung Tau VTS Center is still restricted because of lack of sea and working experience of VTS officers. So a supporting system to support VTS officers for improving their competency and the Vung Tau VTS Center?셲 efficiency needs to be established. The supporting system should be able to help VTS officers to assess collision risks of vessels quantitatively in real time. It must be built based on an assessment model that takes into account the risk of human factors 4. Through analysis it was found that some models other than the ES model and the PARK model use statistical measures or the opinions of experts, but they do not take into account the risks of human factors. So these models cannot be used to assess collision risks of vessels in real time. By qualitative analysis and assessment of VTS officers about the ES model and the PARK model, it was shown that the PARK model is the most appropriate model for evaluating risks of collision in the Vung Tau Waterway in real time 5. The Real Time Supporting System (RTSS) for VTS officers was developed. It is able to evaluate collision risks of vessels based on the PARK model in real time and alert vessels that run a risk of collision. In addition, it can alert officers about vessels??going aground, being off-route and over-speed vessels. The RTSS was put in trial operation in the Vung Tau VTS Center. Most VTS officers have given the same feedback, i. e., that it is a useful tool and should be improved to become an indispensable part of the VTS system From these results this dissertation recommends to the Maritime Administration of Ho Chi Minh City, which manages the Vung Tau VTS Center, to give permission for connecting the RTSS with the VTS system to enable complete traffic data gathering for implementing the subsequent trial operation steps.
