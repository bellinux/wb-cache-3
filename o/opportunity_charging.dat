One challenge is finding a pathway for vehicles that gains wide market acceptance to achieve a meaningful benefit.

Using the current estimates of battery life and cost, only the dynamically plugged-in pathway was cost-effective to the consumer.

However, for mass adoption, EV costs {{have historically been}} too high to be competitive with conventional vehicle options due to {{the high price of}} batteries, long refuel time, and a lack of charging infrastructure. A number of different technologies and business strategies have been proposed to address some of these cost and utility issues: battery leasing, battery fast-charging stations, battery swap stations, deployment of charge points for <b>opportunity</b> <b>charging,</b> etc. In order to investigate these approaches and compare their merits on a consistent basis, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has developed a new techno-economic model.

The various input parameters such as vehicle type, battery, gasoline, and electricity prices; battery cycle life; driving profile; and infrastructure costs can be varied.

40|$|The {{market share}} of plug-in {{electric}} vehicles (PEVs) has been increasing {{in the last years}} which comes along with a raising demand for public charging stations. While the operation of low-power charging stations (Mode- 3) is far from being profitable, prospects for fast charging stations indicate attractive revenues. This is mainly based on a higher workload (shorter charging times), a higher willingness-to-pay of customers and a higher complementary situation compared to home-based charging [1]. Both also serve for different purposes: Slow charging is performed whenever there is an opportunity while fast charging will also allow short stops to recharge on long-distance trips (interim charging). In this paper, we investigate the potential for combining interim and <b>opportunity</b> <b>charging</b> at one location in order to increase the utilization and decrease the payback time of public fast charging stations. For modeling the operation of Mode- 3 charging stations, we applied the ALADIN model [2] and combine it with results from an optimal allocation of fast charging points in Germany (cf. [3]). Results are presented for four fast charging stations around Stuttgart, Germany. Our results show that a combination of long-distance and local customers may increase the occupancy rate and therefore the profitability of fast charging stations. Yet, the willingness to detour of PEV users, the comparably small additional earnings for charging stations together with a joint optimized location modelling might be analyzed in further work...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{economic}} benefits of installing a lithium-ion battery storage (lithium iron phosphate, LFP and lithium titanate, LTO) at an electric bus fast charging station.   It is conducted on a potential electric bus system in the Swedish city Västerås, {{and based on the}} existing bus schedules and routes as well as the local distribution system. The size of the energy storage as well as the maximum power outtake from the grid is optimized in order to minimize the total annual cost of the connection. The assessment of the distribution system shows that implementing an electric bus system based on <b>opportunity</b> <b>charging</b> in Västerås does not cause over-capacity in the 10 kV grid during normal feeding mode. However, grid reinforcements might become necessary to guarantee potential backup feeding modes. Batteries are not a cost effective option to decrease grid owner investments in new transformers. However, battery energy storage have the possibility to decrease the annual cost of connecting a fast charging station to the low-voltage grid. The main advantage of the storage system is to decrease the fees to the grid owner. Of the studied batteries, LTO is the most cost effective solution because of its larger possible depth-of-discharge for a given cycle life. The most important characteristics, that determine if a fast charging station could benefit economically from an energy storage, is the bus frequency. The longer the time in between buses and the higher the power demand, the more advantageous is the energy storage...|$|E

40|$|AbstractElectric buses deliver zero {{tailpipe}} emissions {{and have the}} potential to offer solutions to the air quality challenges of urban mobility in the 21 st century. However, bus duty cycles are very demanding and unusually large batteries are required if electric buses are to have the range and ruggedness of their diesel counterparts. This research investigates an alternative strategy focusing on the performance of electric buses using wireless charging technology to provide <b>opportunity</b> <b>charging</b> during the working day without interrupting the timetable. In particular, the Milton Keynes demonstration project is analysed in an attempt to detect the factors that affect electric vehicles’ functionality, and learn lessons retrospectively in terms of design considerations. Two different approaches are used to evaluate the performance of the eight buses which have taken over the Number 7 route at Milton Keynes since January. Firstly, an overall analysis of the buses has been conducted according to the ambient conditions, driver influence on the performance, vehicles’ capabilities, vertical profile of the route as well as the driving and battery conditions. Additionally, the ground system‘s efficiency is analysed in order to correlate the energy drawn by the buses with the energy drawn from the network during the charging periods at the charging points. Considering the energy consumption and the system's efficiency, the actual performance of the buses and charging system is proven to be reasonably comparable to and consistent with the theoretical one while it is comfortably within the design base. This study raises important points for the crucial factors that affect electric vehicle's performance in a real life context and in a fully operational environment and could be the starting point towards proving that wireless charging is a significant game changer in terms of bus transport in the United Kingdom...|$|E
40|$|The {{electric}} vehicles of today have limited driving range, {{but we can}} expect incremental improvements towards 250 - 300 km / per charge and even longer if the work on new battery chemistry will succeed.

This will take some years. However a big investment in the infrastructure could kick-start the electric vehicle market. If slow and fast chargers will be available on several locations the drivers will be more confident in the car itself. There are several techniques for charging of {{electric vehicles}}, the most promising is conductive charging and inductive wireless charging. These two techniques are already available and there is a common core technology using high frequency switching at high power level. A further development is the ability to deliver energy back to the grid in the future. The report finds that research on inductive charging is the most important. Capacitive, radio frequency or micro wave, conductive power transfer are possible ways to charge the vehicle when it stops at home, for shopping or at work.

40|$|Electric Vehicles (EVs) promise major {{improvements}} in air-quality. But the limited range and long recharge times of EVs have created great uncertainty about consumer demand. Technical constraint studies find good news, that 20 - 60 % of all {{households in the}} United States could substitute an EV with 162 KM range for one of their current vehicles. In startling contrast, choice studies [...] based on the responses of consumers to hypothetical choice sets [...] find that limited range and long recharge are extremely expensive drawbacks and forecast sales of a few percent or less of the yearly new auto market. These studies have relied on meager data and not investigated the potential revolutionary effect on the automobile market of the introduction of alternative fueled vehicles. To explore potential dynamics, we have conducted three linked studies: 1) a test drive of EVs, natural gas, and methanol vehicles by 236 citizens in Los Angeles (with 11 post-drive focus group interviews); 2) purchase intention and range simulation games (PIREG) and 3) interviews with over 100 owners of EVs. In this paper, we focus upon the methods and results of PIREG, an interview gaming technique derived from the CUPIG (Car Use Patterns Interview-Game) developed by Martin Lee-Gosselin to study future automobile use. The interview uses one week diaries of households and detailed descriptions of a recent vehicle purchase decision to create a realistic simulation context for examining the potential substitution of several new electric vehicle technologies. The results demonstrate several dynamics. First, increased information and learning experience will reduce uncertainty in the EV market, affecting stated preferences. In the test drive, 76 % of participants said their opinion of EVs improved after a test drive. Participants were surprised at how normal the EVs looked and performed. Second, households will consider adaptive responses to limited range vehicles, given the social benefits of clean air. Most PIREG participants were surprised at how easily electrics fit their travel needs; most were highly receptive to EVs if the price were {{equal to that of}} a gas car. Using detail diaries of their own car use, participants proposed simple ways of adapting to limited range including swapping vehicles for longer days, <b>opportunity</b> <b>charging</b> at work and in some households increasing the vehicle stock. in most cases, households preferred occasional adaptations to more expensive, long-range vehicles. Finally, PIREG interviews and electric vehicle owner interviews suggest that a multi-fueled household (gasoline and electric) will optimize the EV use with significant fuel cost differences. In some cases, the ability of households to shift vehicle use to the EV was so significant, that it may offset the higher initial cost of EVs. Information development, experience, adaptive response and optimization are central processes underlying the development of the electric vehicle market. PIREG interviews offer the most detailed understanding of these processes and the purchase intentions that will result. While the market is uncertain for EVs, PIREG games and current practices of EV owners suggest that with the right price incentives, EVs could become the primary vehicles in households, used for a higher percentage of household trips and VMTs than a gasoline counter part in the household...|$|E
