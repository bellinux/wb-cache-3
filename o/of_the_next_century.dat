5|$|A slender chancel arch existed {{until the}} mid-19th century and might have been pre-Conquest, but the {{earliest}} visible extant part {{of the church is}} the 13th-century north arcade, which may have been added to an earlier, now-lost, nave. The spire and tower date to the middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>century,</b> roughly when the nave was rebuilt. Many of the windows are reticulated in a fashion popular during the early 14th century. Several medieval bequests are known: Olivia, wife of John Rossen of Quarrington, left 12 pence to the rector and church each in 1412; a donation of wool was made by another parishioner, Joan, wife of William Ward, around the same time. Later, 8 pence was left to the churchwardens by an unknown resident.|$|E
5|$|In the 14th century, {{most of the}} town's {{inhabitants}} and {{the local}} elite were Saxons, largely descended from settlers brought in by the Kings of Hungary in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries to develop and defend the southern borders of the province. By the middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>century</b> roughly half the population had Hungarian names. In Transylvania as a whole, the Reformation sharpened ethnic divisions: Saxons became Lutheran while Hungarians either remained Catholic or became Calvinist or Unitarian. In Kolozsvár, however, the religious lines were blurred. Isolated both geographically from the main areas of German settlement in southern Transylvania and institutionally because of their distinctive religious trajectory, many Saxons eventually assimilated to the Hungarian majority over several generations. New settlers to the town largely spoke Hungarian, a language that many Saxons gradually adopted. (In the seventeenth century, {{out of more than}} thirty royal free towns, only seven had a Hungarian majority, with Kolozsvár/Klausenburg being one of them; the rest were largely German-dominated.) In this manner Kolozsvár became largely Hungarian speaking and would remain so through the mid-20th century, though 4.8% of its residents identified as German as late as 1880.|$|E
5|$|Fearing the worst, the Romans began a major mobilization, all but {{pulling out}} of {{recently}} pacified Spain and Gaul. They even established a major garrison in Sicily in case the Seleucids ever got to Italy. This fear was shared by Rome's Greek allies, who had largely ignored Rome {{in the years after}} the Second Macedonian War, but now followed Rome again {{for the first time since}} that war. A major Roman-Greek force was mobilized under the command of the great hero of the Second Punic War, Scipio Africanus, and set out for Greece, beginning the Roman-Syrian War. After initial fighting that revealed serious Seleucid weaknesses, the Seleucids tried to turn the Roman strength against them at the Battle of Thermopylae (as they believed the 300 Spartans had done centuries earlier). Like the Spartans, the Seleucids lost the battle, and were forced to evacuate Greece. The Romans pursued the Seleucids by crossing the Hellespont, which marked the first time a Roman army had ever entered Asia. The decisive engagement was fought at the Battle of Magnesia, resulting in a complete Roman victory. The Seleucids sued for peace, and Rome forced them to give up their recent Greek conquests. Although they still controlled a great deal of territory, this defeat marked the decline of their empire, as they were to begin facing increasingly aggressive subjects in the east (the Parthians) and the west (the Greeks). Their empire disintegrated into a rump over the course <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>century,</b> when it was eclipsed by Pontus. Following Magnesia, Rome again withdrew from Greece, assuming (or hoping) that the lack of a major Greek power would ensure a stable peace. In fact, it did the opposite.|$|E

25|$|The Heptanesean kantádhes (καντάδες 'serenades'; sing.: καντάδα) {{became the}} {{forerunners}} of the Greek modern urban popular song, influencing its development {{to a considerable}} degree.

25|$|Penal Laws (which {{had been}} allowed to lapse {{somewhat}} after the English Restoration) were re-applied with great harshness after this war, as the Protestant elite wanted to ensure that the Irish Catholic landed classes would not {{be in a position to}} repeat their rebellions of the 17th century.

25|$|Though comets had {{now been}} {{demonstrated}} to be in space, {{the question of how}} they moved would be debated for most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>century.</b> Even after Johannes Kepler had determined in 1609 that the planets moved about the Sun in elliptical orbits, he was reluctant to believe that the laws that governed the motions of the planets should also influence the motion of other bodies – he believed that comets travel among the planets along straight lines, and it required Edmund Halley to prove that their orbits are in fact curved. Galileo Galilei, although a staunch Copernicanist, rejected Tycho's parallax measurements and his Discourse on Comets held to the Aristotelian notion of comets moving on straight lines through the upper atmosphere.|$|E
25|$|Queen's {{struggled}} with top-flight football {{and the professional}} sides which surrounded them. An early high-point was a 1–0 victory over Celtic {{at the opening of}} the new Hampden Park in 1903. By previous standards, however, unspectacular seasons followed and the club even finished in the relegation zone on five occasions. Queen's were spared by vote until 1922 when, after a few solid seasons, the team were eventually relegated in second-last place. Queen's bounced back immediately, winning Division Two at the first attempt. In a league season of 24 victories and only 5 defeats, the Spiders even managed a 4–3 win over Celtic in the Glasgow Cup, with James McAlpine scoring a hat-trick. McAlpine's fine play inspired Queen's to their greatest ever placing in the Scottish League, when they finished 5th in Division One in 1929. He would go on to set a goal scoring record for the club and his appearance record was only beaten by Ross Caven at the turn <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>century.</b> In 1928, the same side also came closest to any Spiders team since 1900 to winning the Scottish Cup but lost 2–1 to Celtic in the semi-finals.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the past}} 25 years, politicians, {{academics}} and journalists have frequently predicted that disputes over water {{would be a}} source of future wars. Commonly cited quotes include: that of former Egyptian Foreign Minister and former Secretary-General of the United Nations Boutrous Ghali, who forecast, “The next war in the Middle East will be fought over water, not politics”; his successor at the UN, Kofi Annan, who in 2001 said, “Fierce competition for fresh water may well become a source of conflict and wars in the future,” and the former Vice President of the World Bank, Ismail Serageldin, who said the wars <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>century</b> will be over water unless significant changes in governance occurred. The water wars hypothesis had its roots in earlier research carried out on a small number of transboundary rivers such as the Indus, Jordan and Nile. These particular rivers became the focus because they had experienced water-related disputes. Specific events cited as evidence include Israel’s bombing of Syria’s attempts to divert the Jordan’s headwaters, and military threats by Egypt against any country building dams in the upstream waters of the Nile. However, while some links made between conflict and water were valid, they did not necessarily represent the norm.|$|E

25|$|The Babylonians removed only {{a portion}} of the {{population}} of Jerusalem; of those exiles, only a small portion returned to Jerusalem (539) after the Persian conquest of Babylon, and did so over several decades. The population of Persian-period Jerusalem and the area was smaller than once believed, only a few thousands. Much of the literature which became the Hebrew bible was compiled during the Persian period, and Persian Yehud saw considerable conflict over the construction and function of the Temple and matters of cult (i.e., how God was to be worshiped). Persia controlled Yehud using the same methods it used in other colonies, and the bible reflects this, and Yehud's status as a Persian colony is crucial to understanding the society and literature of the period. The restoration of the Davidic kingdom under Persian royal patronage was clearly the project of the exile community in the early post-Exilic period. The returnees attempted to restore in Yehud the First Temple threefold leadership template of king (Sheshbazzar and Zerubbabel), high priest (Joshua, descended from the priestly line), and prophets (Haggai, Zechariah). However, by the middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>century,</b> probably around 450 BCE, the kings and prophets had disappeared and only the high priest remained, joined by the scribe-sage (Ezra and the appointed aristocrat-governor Nehemiah). This new pattern provided the leadership model for Yehud for centuries to come.|$|E

A few months later the city asked him to get involved in Millennium Park; Gehry felt he would prefer to design a building, but that he could not complete it in time for the Millennium, and that he would need a much larger budget than the city had envisioned.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{before his}} death Bizet signed a {{contract}} for a production of Carmen by the Vienna Court Opera. For this version, first staged on 23 October 1875, Bizet's friend Ernest Guiraud replaced the original dialogue with recitatives, to create a [...] "grand opera" [...] format. Guiraud also reorchestrated music from Bizet's L'Arlésienne suite to provide a spectacular ballet for Carmens second act. Shortly before the initial Vienna performance the Court Opera's director Franz von Jauner decided to use parts of the original dialogue {{along with some of}} Guiraud's recitatives; this hybrid and the full recitative version became the norms for productions of the opera outside France for most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>century.</b>|$|E
