5|$|If it is {{necessary}} to walk near the nest, wearing a broad-brimmed or legionnaire's hat or using an umbrella will deter attacking birds, but beanies and bicycle helmets are of little value as birds attack the sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> neck.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} support the robust head, the neck of Hatzegopteryx was likely {{strongly}} muscled. On the occipital bones, the nuchal lines, which serve as muscular attachments, are very well-developed and bear prominent scars. These conceivably supported the transversospinalis muscles, which aid in extension and flexion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> neck. Likewise, the opisthotic process, neural spines, and zygapophyses all {{appeared to have been}} large and robust (with the latter bearing many pits and edges that likely represent muscle scars), and the basioccipital tuberosities were long; these all serve as points of attachment for various muscles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> neck. Although not entirely unmuscled, the neck of Arambourgiania probably would not have been as extensively muscled as that of Hatzegopteryx.|$|E
5|$|In {{over one}} or more sittings, a highly skilled {{sculptor}} from Madame Tussauds Studios who is given {{direct access to the}} celebrity will record the colours of the hair and eyes, and over 500 precise body measurements are referenced. Most important is to capture the look of the celebrity to reflect the personality of each unique individual. The next task is to make a clay model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> body which is used to create a mould. Wax cast <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> hands are made from the mould, and the eyes are inserted. Each eye is hand-painted to achieve a perfect match of the original. Real human hair is then inserted painstakingly strand by strand.|$|E

5|$|Cockroaches are {{generalized}} insects, {{with few}} special adaptations, {{and may be}} among the most primitive living neopteran insects. They have a relatively small head and a broad, flattened body, and most species are reddish-brown to dark brown. They have large compound eyes, two ocelli, and long, flexible antennae. The mouthparts are on the underside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> include generalized chewing mandibles, salivary glands and various touch and taste receptors.|$|E
5|$|Dolphins have sharp eyesight. The {{eyes are}} {{located at the}} sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> have a tapetum lucidum, or {{reflecting}} membrane, {{at the back of}} the retina, which aids vision in dim light. Their horseshoe-shaped, double-slit pupils enable dolphins to have good vision both in air and underwater, despite the different indices of refraction of these media. When under water, the eyeball's lens serves to focus light, whereas in the in-air environment, the typically bright light serves to contract the specialized pupil, resulting in sharpness from a smaller aperture (similar to a pinhole camera).|$|E
5|$|Flatfish are {{demersal}} fish (bottom-feeding fish) that show {{a greater degree}} of asymmetry than any other vertebrates. The larvae are at first bilaterally symmetrical but they undergo metamorphosis during the course of their development, with one eye migrating to the other side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> they simultaneously start swimming on their side. This has the advantage that, when they lie on the seabed, both eyes are on top, giving them a broad field of view. The upper side is usually speckled and mottled for camouflage, while the underside is pale.|$|E

Combined with their streamlined shape and the concentration of fins towards the back (similar to that of a pike), these adaptations allow halfbeaks to locate, catch, and swallow food items very effectively.|$|E
5|$|In 1879, Forbes {{stated the}} cere {{was covered by}} {{feathers}} which concealed the nostrils. This contradicts other accounts that mention that the nostrils were surrounded by red skin. Forbes based his description on the Paris specimen which had previously had its skull and mandible removed for study by the French zoologist Alphonse Milne-Edwards. This {{may have led to}} the distortion of the shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> nostrils as indicated by the illustration in Forbes' article.|$|E
5|$|In a fatal attack, however, it manifests very quickly. In {{a number}} of cases, death has {{occurred}} within 24 hours of {{the onset of the}} infection, while other cases do not last longer than around five days. The virus attacks endothelial cells, rupturing capillaries and causing blood loss and haemorrhaging; once this reaches the heart, the haemorrhage kills quickly through shock. Symptoms include lethargy and an unwillingness to eat, a rapid heartbeat, and decreased blood-cell count, as well as cyanosis of the tongue, mouth ulcers, and oedema <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> trunk.|$|E

5|$|James Spotila et al. (1991) {{concludes that}} the large body size of sauropods would have made them unable to {{maintain}} high metabolic rates because {{they would not have}} been able to release enough heat. They assumed sauropods had a reptilian respiratory system. Wedel says that an avian system would have allowed it to dump more heat. Some scientists state that the heart would have had trouble sustaining sufficient blood pressure to oxygenate the brain. Others suggest that the near-horizontal posture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> neck would have eliminated the problem of supplying blood to the brain because it would not have been elevated.|$|E
5|$|Like all jumping spiders, M. inclemens has {{excellent}} vision. The main eyes, in the front-and-center position, are large, and {{are more}} acute than those of a cat and about 10 times as acute as a dragonfly's. The remaining three pairs of eyes are along the sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> work as motion detectors. The eyes are used for hunting, for avoiding threats and for finding and wooing mates. Almost all jumping spiders are predators, mostly preying on insects, on other spiders, and on other arthropods.|$|E

5|$|Originally, Borsuk-Bia≈Çynicka {{assumed that}} in {{standard}} position the neck was horizontal or slanted slightly downward. This {{was based on}} the reconstruction of the nuchal ligament, which runs atop of the cervical and dorsal vertebrae and serves to support the weight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> neck. Although an S-curved, swan-like ascending neck was envisaged in several subsequent reconstructions following similar depictions of better known sauropods, recent studies argue that sauropod necks were relatively straight and were carried more horizontally.|$|E
5|$|The Central American {{squirrel}} monkey differs in coloration from South American {{squirrel monkey}}s. While South American squirrel monkeys {{tend to be}} primarily greenish in color, the Central American species has an orange back with olive shoulders, hips and tail and white undersides. The hands and feet are also orange. There is a black cap at the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> a black tip {{at the end of}} the tail. Males generally have lighter caps than females. The face is white with black rims around the eyes and black around the nose and mouth.|$|E
5|$|The {{adult male}} of the {{nominate}} subspecies, S. c. carolinensis, has pale blue-gray upperparts, a glossy black cap (crown <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head),</b> <b>and</b> a black band {{on the upper}} back. The wing coverts and flight feathers are very dark gray with paler fringes, and the closed wing is pale gray and black, with a thin white wing bar. The face and the underparts are white. The outer tail feathers are black with broad diagonal white bands across the outer three feathers, a feature readily visible in flight.|$|E

5|$|The condor's {{head and}} neck have few feathers, and the skin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> neck is capable of {{flushing}} noticeably in response to emotional state, a capability that can serve as communication between individuals.

5|$|The mantis thorax {{consists}} of a prothorax, a mesothorax, and a metathorax. In all species apart from the genus Mantoida, the prothorax, which bears the head and forelegs, is much longer {{than the other two}} thoracic segments. The prothorax is also flexibly articulated, allowing {{for a wide range of}} movements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> fore limbs while the remainder of the body remains more or less immobile.|$|E
5|$|The {{masked shrike}} feeds mainly on large insects, {{although}} other arthropods and small vertebrates are also caught. Shrikes fatten up before migration, {{but to a}} lesser extent than other passerines because they can feed on the way, sometimes taking other tired migrants. Despite its relatively small size, the masked shrike has been recorded as killing species such as lesser whitethroat and little swift. Vertebrates are killed by bill blows to the back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> the tomial teeth are then used to separate the neck bones.|$|E
