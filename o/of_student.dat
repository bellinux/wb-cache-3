The Leader Behavior Description Questionnaire (LBDQ) was employed to assess the leadership behavior of the deans <b>of</b> <b>students</b> in the dimensions of initiating structure and consideration. The population included 10 current deans <b>of</b> <b>students</b> and 8 former deans <b>of</b> <b>students,</b> 173 student affairs staff members, and 224 student leaders. In addition, six current deans <b>of</b> <b>students</b> and one officer of the Ministry of Education were interviewed by the researcher. The conclusions are as follows. 1. Current and former deans <b>of</b> <b>students</b> had the same perceptions and expectations of the leadership behavior in the initiating structure and consideration dimensions. 2. Effective leadership behavior <b>of</b> deans <b>of</b> <b>students</b> was associated with high scores on initiating structure and consideration. 3. Deans <b>of</b> <b>students</b> employed different leadership behaviors to lead the student affairs staff members and student leaders. 4. The leadership behavior of the deans <b>of</b> <b>students</b> was inclined toward high initiating structure and low consideration. 5. Deans <b>of</b> <b>students</b> and student affairs staff members had differing perceptions of leadership behavior on real consideration. 6. Deans <b>of</b> <b>students</b> and the student leaders had differing perceptions of leadership behavior on real initiating structure. This study suggested that a dean <b>of</b> <b>students</b> may want to employ a plan of self-study, or participate in leadership training programs, workshops, and conferences related to student affairs to improve leadership behavior effectively. Further research to examine the perceptions of the leadership behavior <b>of</b> deans <b>of</b> <b>students</b> is recommended...|$|R
