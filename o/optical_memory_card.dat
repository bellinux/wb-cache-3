No where is this more apparent than in the military community. As the amount of information each military unit must have to function efficiently and effectively increases, so does the space required to store it. This situation has prompted at least one high-level Navy official to initiate a program to test the concept of a "paperless ship" by 1990. At the head of the list of systems to meet the mass storage requirements of the program are the optical memory technologies. Included under this heading are the optical memory cards. An <b>optical</b> <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> is the size of a standard 54 mm x 85 mm wallet card and, in one particular configuration, is capable of storing 800 pages of text alone or 200 pages of combined text and graphics. Employing <b>optical</b> <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> technology in the "paperless ship" will reduce the space required to store technical manuals and directives by a factor of over 200 ! Two applications; A Technical Document Publishing, Distributing and Update Program; and An Individual Personnel Record Storage and Update Program are discussed as potentially beneficial to the military community.

40|$|Smart cards, Chip cards, and Integrated Circuit(s) Cards (ICC) {{were invented}} and {{patented}} in the 70 s. A smart card is embedded {{with either a}} microprocessor and a memory chip or simply a memory chip with non-programmable logic. Today, there are three broad categories of smart cards: Microprocessor <b>Cards,</b> <b>Memory</b> <b>Cards,</b> and <b>Optical</b> <b>Memory</b> <b>Cards.</b> In the 90 s, the smart card prevailed, specifically, {{with the introduction of}} the smart-card-based Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) used in the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) mobile phone equipment in Europe. Since then smart cards proven to be the most efficient tools and rational solution for handling large and diverse transactions. The Smart Card proved applications are also constantly being extended with the increasing arithmetic power and storage capacity of available integrated circuits. Building a variety of functions and services in a single card is a key factor in successful implementation of smart-card applications. A multi-function smart-card application prototype that consists of a Health Card, an Electronic Purse and Access Control card is presented, with a focus on the Java Card Runtime Environment (JCRE), Object sharing, and the Applet firewalls. To demonstrate the Java Card Object Sharing Mechanism, sample codes are shown in this paper. Furthermore, a brief review of the weaknesses associated with the java card object sharing mechanism is presented...|$|R

50|$|Recently, {{electronic}} {{devices such as}} digital cameras, MP3 players, cellular phones, etc., are required with larger capacity of storage to store data. A <b>memory</b> <b>card,</b> such as a Micro SD card, a MMC card, etc., which has larger capacity of storage and a small size, is extensively used to expend the capacity of storage of the {{electronic devices}}. The data transmission between the electronic device and the <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> is through a <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> connector mounted on a PCB of the electronic device for connecting with the <b>memory</b> <b>card.</b> The <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> connector has an insulating housing; the insulating housing includes a receiving cavity for receiving the <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> and a plurality of grooves for respectively receiving a plurality of terminals. One end of the terminal forms a soldering portion for being soldered to the PCB and {{the other end of}} each terminal forms a connecting portion for mating with the <b>memory</b> <b>card.</b> A metallic cover couples with the insulating housing. The <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> is inserted and held in the receiving cavity of the <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> connector for being used in storing various data and taken by the electronic device as a recording medium. If not in use, the inserted <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> can be pulled out from the receiving cavity of the <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> connector.|$|R

50|$|When {{recording}} to a <b>memory</b> <b>card,</b> {{the recording}} time depends only on {{capacity of the}} card. The GZ-MG555 uses full-size SDHC <b>memory</b> <b>cards.</b> One 4GB card can fit roughly 1 hour of video at highest quality setting. There are no limitations for using any of the recording formats when recording to a <b>memory</b> <b>card.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} PlayStation 2 <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> has an 8 MB {{capacity and}} uses Sony's MagicGate encryption. This requirement prevented {{the production of}} <b>memory</b> <b>cards</b> by third parties who did not purchase a MagicGate license. <b>Memory</b> <b>cards</b> without encryption {{can be used to}} store PlayStation game saves, but PlayStation games would be unable to read from or write to the card - such a card could only be used as a backup. There are a variety of non-Sony manufactured <b>memory</b> <b>cards</b> available for the PlayStation 2, allowing for a larger memory capacity than the standard 8 MB. However their use is unsupported and compatibility is not guaranteed. These <b>memory</b> <b>cards</b> can have up to 128 MB storage space.|$|R

Categorized by Sony {{as a combination}} of a <b>Memory</b> <b>Card</b> and a miniature personal digital assistant, the device features a monochrome liquid crystal display (LCD), infrared communication capability, a real-time clock, built-in flash memory, and sound capability. To use the device's <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> functionality, it must be connected to a PlayStation through a <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> slot. It was released exclusively in Japan on January 23, 1999.|$|R
5000|$|Multiple Dreamcast <b>memory</b> <b>cards</b> with no VMU {{features}} {{have been}} released. The cards therefore omit a display screen, input buttons, speaker and built-in clock.

50|$|The PlayStation 3 <b>Memory</b> <b>Card</b> Adaptor (CECHZM1) is {{a device}} that allows data to be {{transferred}} from a PlayStation or PlayStation 2 <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> to the PlayStation 3's hard disk. At launch, the device did not support transferring saved game files back to a <b>memory</b> <b>card,</b> but upon {{the release of the}} PlayStation 3 system software version 1.80, the user is now able to transfer PS1 and PS2 game saves from the PS3 directly onto a physical <b>Memory</b> <b>Card</b> via the adaptor. PlayStation 2 saved game files can also be transferred between PlayStation 3 users via other current <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> formats. The device connects to the PlayStation 3's USB port on one end through a USB Mini-B cable (not included with adaptor, but it was included with the console itself), and features a PlayStation 2 <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> port on the other end. The adaptor works with every PlayStation 3 model, regardless of whether it is compatible with PlayStation 2 games or not. The adaptor was available for purchase simultaneously with the console's launch. The <b>Memory</b> <b>Card</b> Adaptor was released on 25 May 2007 in the UK.|$|R
50|$|Originally console games had no {{additional}} storage memory for saving game related data. During the Nintendo Entertainment System's {{time on the}} market, battery backed cartridge games that could retain {{a limited number of}} game files were introduced. When the original PlayStation was released it included support for an external memory source, called a <b>memory</b> <b>card.</b> Its purpose was to store important information about the games, such as game states or scoring info. That <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> used a <b>memory</b> of type EEPROM. To support the growing use of these cards in normal game play and the different amounts of data to be saved, larger <b>memory</b> <b>cards</b> were created. Other consoles also adopted the use of <b>memory</b> <b>cards,</b> such as the Sega Dreamcast, whose <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> was called the Visual Memory Unit or VMU. The Dreamcast’s memory unit was unique in that it had a monochrome LCD display, a D-pad, and two buttons. A large third party <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> market also sprung up, offering cards that were often much cheaper and larger than the official released <b>memory</b> <b>cards.</b> Some unique third party cards required extra software to access the cards, or possibly increase the data capacity by compressing the contained data.|$|R
