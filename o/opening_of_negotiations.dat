25|$|The dossier, an {{incomplete}} series of {{documents related to}} the deposit and administration of the gold of the Bank of Spain, was sent to Alberto Martín Artajo, Minister of Foreign Affairs, and was forwarded to the Lieutenant Governor of the Bank of Spain, Jesús Rodríguez Salmones, who, without inspecting the papers, ordered them to be stored in the security vaults of the institution. Even though the transfer was made with strict discretion, as Negrín had intended for it to remain an absolute secret, the events soon came into public domain, which instigated passionate controversies. In January 1957, Franco sent a diplomatic commission to Moscow, officially to discuss the repatriation of Spaniards — however, it was suspected that the commission's actual goal was the <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> <b>negotiations</b> {{for the return of}} the gold, in light of the documentary evidence uncovered by the Negrín dossier.|$|E

500|$|Stephen was crowned king by Archbishop Lawrence of Esztergom in Székesfehérvár within {{thirty days}} of his father's death. His {{peaceful}} succession showed {{the effectiveness of the}} measures Coloman had implemented to prevent Álmos from usurping the throne. [...] Upon his councilor’s advice, Stephen initiated a meeting with Vladislaus I, Duke of Bohemia, in order to improve the countries' relations, which had deteriorated in the previous decade. The two monarchs met on the river Olšava, which marked the border of their realms. However, the lack of mutual confidence hindered the <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> <b>negotiations,</b> leading to armed conflicts which evolved into a battle on 13 May. On the battlefield, the Bohemian army inflicted a serious defeat on Stephen's troops. The contemporaneous Cosmas of Prague blamed the young king's advisors for the fiasco, but later medieval Hungarian chronicles [...] all completed under kings descending from Stephen's opponent, Álmos [...] wrote that the king acted without consulting his advisors [...] "... for he was of an impetuous nature".|$|E

40|$|The {{coming weeks}} and months will be decisive for the general tenor of {{politics}} in Turkey. The country faces local elections this March, presidential elections in August and general elections next June, while top-level political scandals compound the deterioration {{in the state of}} democracy and rule of law. At the same time, stagnation in Turkey’s accession process continues to sour relations with the EU. In this new Policy Brief, Steven Blockmans puts forward a number of recommendations to help drive the EU accession process forward, namely the early <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> <b>negotiation</b> chapters 23 (judiciary and fundamental rights) and 24 (justice, freedom and security), in line with the EU’s so-called New Approach. In that way reform could not just be assured on paper, but a track record in implementation could be established throughout the process. To achieve this, member states, and Cyprus in particular, need to be persuaded to end their opposition to formulating benchmarks for the <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> accession negotiating chapters 23 and 24...|$|R

This group, known disparagingly by the Conservative whips as 'The Glamour Boys', formed around Anthony Eden when he had resigned as Foreign Secretary in February 1938 in protest at the <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> <b>negotiations</b> with Italy by the Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain. Given his long-standing friendship with Winston Churchill, it was not surprising that Spears also joined the latter's group of anti-appeasers, known as 'The Old Guard'.

Following the <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> accession <b>negotiations</b> on 3 October 2005, the process of screening 35 acquis chapters with Croatia was completed on 18 October 2006.

5000|$|On 2 February, many General Assemblies {{were held}} and the {{decision}} was made to strike. On 9 February, the date of the start of the summer semester at the Sorbonne, a General Assembly was held. This was unexpectedly successful and led to the <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> three lecture halls for the debates. Ultimately, Chancellors from eight universities made numerous speeches in the famous Richelieu Amphitheatre and called for a strike until the withdrawal of all the proposed changes and the <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> joint <b>negotiations</b> on the future of the universities. In his address, Georges Molinié spoke of the [...] "most dangerous threat to the French educational system since the end of the Vichy-regime".|$|R
50|$|Worldwide {{interest}} in the subject was generated by announcements in 1991 of the location of objects confiscated by Soviet Trophy Brigades from German territory {{at the end of the}} war. The unification of Germany in 1990 and dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 were followed by a number of goodwill agreements between Germany and the countries of the former USSR, as well as the <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> official <b>negotiations</b> on repatriation. It was this spirit of openness and cooperation that made the New York symposium possible. This initial gathering of concerned parties would be followed by a series of conferences, initiatives, agreements, and repatriations that continue into the present.|$|R
50|$|President Rexhep Meidani {{announced}} on 18 April 2001 {{that the first}} round of the elections would be held on 24 June, with the second round on 8 July. The governing Socialist Party had the aim of gaining 60% of the vote, in order to have a sufficient majority to elect a new President in 2002. They campaigned on infrastructure improvements such as communication and transport and on their record in restoring order and economic growth. They were also boosted by achieving the <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> <b>negotiations</b> with the European Union on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement just before the election.|$|E
50|$|Following this agreement, the EU {{planned to}} grant {{candidate}} status to Serbia {{as early as}} 2009, contingent on its full cooperation with the Hague tribunal. The European Commission (EC) recommended making it an official candidate on 12 October 2011. On 28 February 2012, the Council of the European Union issued a candidate status recommendation, and Serbia received a full candidate status on 1 March. In December 2012, the Council launched the accession process {{with a view to}} open negotiations in June 2013, provided that political conditions regarding cooperation with Kosovo were met.

50|$|Maitland's {{instincts}} proved correct, and Napoleon {{arrived at}} Rochefort in early July. By this time, {{he was in}} an untenable position. He could no longer remain in France without risking arrest; indeed, Prussian troops had orders to capture him dead or alive. However, the Bellerophon {{and the rest of}} Hotham's fleet were blocking every port. He therefore authorised the <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> <b>negotiations</b> with Maitland. The negotiations opened on 10 July. Maitland refused to allow Napoleon to sail for America, but offered to take him to England instead. The negotiations went on for four days, but eventually Napoleon acquiesced. He surrendered to Maitland on 15 July and embarked on the Bellerophon with his staff and servants.|$|E

The peace agreement was followed by the formal demarcation of the border on 13 May 1999 and the end of the multi-national MOMEP (Military Observer Mission for Ecuador and Peru) troop deployment on 17 June 1999 which effectively put an end to the longest territorial dispute in the Western Hemisphere.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} assess the impact of Europeanization on Turkey’s FP, we {{analyzed}} the country’s alignment to the Council of the European Union’s CFSP statements 3. Most statements are open to an “alignment procedure” to acceding countries 4, candidate countries and potential candidates, members of the European Economic Area (Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway), and even to some European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) partners. We looked at Turkey’s alignment, starting from 2000 when the country was included in the procedure (after being recognized as an official candidate and before the <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> accession <b>negotiations)</b> until 2014. The Turkish alignment with CFSP was examined diachronically and across different topics and was compared with that of other candidate...|$|R
