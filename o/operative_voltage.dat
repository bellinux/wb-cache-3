40|$|International audienceThe present work {{reports the}} use and {{application}} of a novel protic ionic liquid (triethylammonium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide; NEt 3 H TFSI) as an electrolyte for symmetric planar micro-supercapacitors based on silicon nanowire electrodes. The excellent performance of the device has been successfully demonstrated using cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge cycles and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The electrochemical characterization of this system exhibits a wide <b>operative</b> <b>voltage</b> of 4 V {{as well as an}} outstanding long cycling stability after millions of galvanostatic cycles at a high current density of 2 mA cm(- 2). In addition, the electrochemical double layer micro-supercapacitor was able to deliver a high power density of 4 mW cm(- 2) {{in a very short time}} pulses (a few ms). Our results could be of interest to develop prospective on-chip micro-supercapacitors using protic ionic liquids as electrolytes with high performance in terms of power and energy densities...|$|E
40|$|ASTRI SST- 2 M {{is one of}} the prototypes of {{the small}} size class of telescopes {{proposed}} for the Cherenkov Telescope Array. Its optical design is based on a dual-mirror Schwarzschild-Couder configuration, and the camera is composed by a matrix of monolithic multipixel silicon photomultipliers managed by ad-hoc tailored front-end electronics. This paper describes the procedures for the gain calibration on the ASTRI SST- 2 M. Since the SiPM gain depends on the <b>operative</b> <b>voltage</b> and the temperature, we adjust the operative voltages for all sensors to have equal gains at a reference temperature. We then correct gain variations caused by temperature changes by adjusting the operating voltage of each sensor. For that purpose the SiPM gain dependence on operating voltage and on temperature have been measured. In addition, we present the calibration procedures and the results of the experimental measurements to evaluate, for each pixel, the parameters necessary to make the trigger uniform over the whole focal plane.

40|$|In {{this work}} we {{considered}} {{the influence of}} pore structure, morphology and surface chemistry on the electrochemical performance of activated carbon in the electrolyte 0. 7 M Et 4 NBF 4 ADN. We showed that the treatment of commercial activated carbon with CO 2 is a promising strategy for the realization of a material with high affinity for ADN-based electrolyte. When composite electrodes containing this carbon are used in combination with 0. 7 M Et 4 NBF 4 ADN, {{it is possible to}} realize high performance EDLCs with <b>operative</b> <b>voltages</b> of 3. 5 V and 3. 6 V. During tests carried out at a current density of 1 A g− 1, an EDLC operating at 3. 6 V containing 0. 7 M Et 4 NBF 4 ADN as electrolyte delivers an average energy and power of 45 Wh kg− 1 and 1. 5 kW kg− 1, respectively, and a capacitance retention of more than 80 % after 50, 000 cycles...|$|R

40|$|A {{study on}} {{optimization}} of Ink-Jet printing parameters, {{in terms of}} drop spacing, <b>operative</b> <b>voltage</b> and waveform, metallic line width and spacing is presented, {{with the aim of}} producing flexible Transparent Conducting Electrodes (TCEs). Silver micronets were produced by Ink-Jet printing on PET films, to obtain polymer supported transparent electrodes; preliminary studies were also performed on the production of freestanding electrodes, by electrodeposition on the printed micronets. The study reveals that PET supported transparent conductive electrodes can be obtained by ink-jet printing, having improved performances with respect to Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) in terms of resistivity and resistance to bending: no cracking or delamination was observed during bending of the micronets and resistance, measured between two points at 3 cm distance, is one order of magnitude lower for the micronets. Preliminary studies on production of freestanding meshes reveal that this process is promising and allows further reduction in electrode resistance, measured between two points at 3 cm distance, of one order of magnitude. Line width, which is the main limitation of this process, can be conformally reduced by electropolishing without causing collapse of the freestanding micronet...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA novel cyclic sulfonium cation-based {{ionic liquid}} (IL) with an ether-group {{appendage}} and the bis{(trifluoromethyl) sulfonyl}imide anion was synthesised and developed for {{electrochemical double layer}} capacitor (EDLC) testing. The synthesis and chemical-physical characterisation of the ether-group containing IL is reported in parallel with a similarly sized alkyl-functionalised sulfonium IL. Results of the chemical-physical measurements demonstrate how important transport properties, i. e. viscosity and conductivity, can be promoted through {{the introduction of the}} ether-functionality without impeding thermal, chemical or electrochemical stability of the IL. Although the apparent transport properties are improved relative to the alkyl-functionalised analogue, the ether-functionalised sulfonium cation-based IL exhibits moderately high viscosity, and poorer conductivity, when compared to traditional EDLC electrolytes based on organic solvents (propylene carbonate and acetonitrile). Electrochemical testing of the ether-functionalised sulfonium IL was conducted using activated carbon composite electrodes to inspect the performance of the IL as a solvent-free electrolyte for EDLC application. Good cycling stability was achieved over the studied range and the performance was comparable to other solvent-free, IL-based EDLC systems. Nevertheless, limitations of the attainable performance are primarily the result of sluggish transport properties and a restricted <b>operative</b> <b>voltage</b> of the IL, thus highlighting key aspects of this field which require further attention...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{illustrates}} {{the construction of}} a new class of iterative solvers for power flow calculations based on the method of Alternating Search Directions. This method is fit to the particular algebraic structure of the power flow problem resulting from the combination of a globally linear set of equations and nonlinear local relations imposed by power conversion devices, such as loads and generators. The choice of the search directions is shown to be crucial for improving the overall robustness of the solver. A noteworthy advantage is that constant search directions yield stationary methods that, in contrast with Newton or Quasi-Newton methods, do not require the evaluation of the Jacobian matrix. Such directions can be elected to enforce the convergence to the high <b>voltage</b> <b>operative</b> solution. The method is explained through an intuitive example illustrating how the proposed generalized formulation is able to include other nonlinear solvers that are classically used for power flow analysis, thus offering a unified view on the topic. Numerical experiments are performed on publicly available benchmarks for large distribution and transmission systems. Peer ReviewedPostprint (author's final draft...|$|R

It is considered a portion of the ACEA Distribuzione S. p. A. network which presents backflow of active power for 20 % of the annual operative time. The network taken into consideration includes about 100 nodes, 25 km of MV lines, three feeders and three distributed energy sources (two biogas generators and one photovoltaic plant).

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we face the}} problem of the joint {{optimization}} of both topology and network parameters in order to minimize the total active power losses in a real Smart Grid. It is considered a portion of the Italian electric distribution network managed by the ACEA Distribuzione S. p. A. located in Rome which presents back-flows of active power for 20 % of the annual operative time. It includes about 1200 user loads, 70 km of MV lines, 6 feeders, a thyristor voltage regulator (TVR) and 6 distributed energy sources (5 generator sets and 1 photovoltaic plant). Network topology can be changed by 106 breakers. The grid has been accurately modelled and simulated in the phasor domain by Matlab/Simulink, relying on the SimPowerSystems ToolBox, following a Multi-Level Hierarchical and Modular approach. Network optimization is faced by defining and solving a suited multi-objective optimization problem, considering suited constraints on nominal <b>operative</b> ranges on <b>voltages</b> and currents, as well as on generator's capability functions, in order to take into account safety and quality of service issues. To this aim it is adopted a genetic algorithm, defining a suited fitness function. Tests have been performed by feeding the simulation environment with real data concerning dissipated and generated active and reactive power values. First results are very interesting, showing that relying on evolutionary computation it is possible to yield a satisfactory power factor correction, confirming that the proposed optimization technique can be adopted as the core of a hierarchical Smart Grid control system. © 2013 IEEE...|$|R
