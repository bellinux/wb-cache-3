Therefore, {{it is important to}} detect thrombin in blood serum for <b>purposes</b> <b>of</b> diagnosis. <b>To</b> <b>achieve</b> this goal, {{it has been suggested that}} a 15 -mer aptamer strongly binds with thrombin to form a G-quartet structure of the aptamer.

40|$|Abstract: Education plays {{vital role}} in {{sustainable}} development. Education is permanent modification of creativity and behaviour {{as the result of}} new experiences through education (Kaushik, 1997). It is not only a catalyst with potentialities to transform all the aspects of development but contributes in the current challenges of sustainability. The aim of education is to ensure and secure the basic <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> education, <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> the tasks of life and to attain basic life skills in an integrated and sustainable manner (Azam, 2003). According to Singh (2008) “Education is essentially a process of growth and development, which goes on throughout the whole life ” (p. 7). Education for sustainability is less understood and less practiced by teacher educators in Government Colleges of Education offering Associate Degree in education and four years B. Ed program. It is difficult to assume that whether teacher educators have proper acquaintance with education for sustainability, skills and willing to incorporate education for sustainability in teacher education policies and practices. In addition, it cannot be presupposed that through experience teacher educators will attain such skills. Therefore, education for sustainability should be carefully planned and made as integral part of teacher education programs instead of ad hoc based approach for education for sustainability. This study will investigate how Associate Degree for education teacher training program for prospectiv...|$|R

40|$|Given {{the ambitious}} goals for and {{interest}} in integrating students' experiences in both educational and practice settings, {{it is helpful to}} have some clear bases with which to proceed in planning, enacting and evaluating these educational provisions. It is necessary, therefore, to understand the kinds <b>of</b> educational <b>purposes</b> <b>to</b> be <b>achieved,</b> and means by which those purposes can likely be realised. Accordingly, this chapter first identifies the forms and kinds of knowledge required to be developed for effective professional practice, that then become the key educational purposes for integrating these experiences. They comprise the canonical conceptual, procedural and dispositional knowledge of the occupation and the particular situational requirements of that occupational knowledge for the circumstances where it is enacted. Following this, the likely contributions of experiences in academic and practice settings are discussed in terms of how they separately and when integrated together can best secure the kinds and forms of knowledge required to be learnt. That is to identify how best the fit between the experiences provided and their integration can realise both the canonical and situational knowledge required for effective professional practice. Hence, the consideration of these integrations goes beyond what is provided or afforded by the two settings and needs to include how novice and experienced practitioners come to draw upon and reconcile both sets of contributions. In doing so, it extends beyond what is enacted as experiences for students and includes their epistemological development as agentic learners. Consequently, it will not be sufficient to consider the only development of appropriate curriculum and pedagogies to integrate experiences. In addition, {{it will be necessary to}} account for the development of agentic personal epistemologies. Arts, Education & Law Group, School of Education and Professional StudiesNo Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} trade has been {{considered}} in this paper {{mainly because of the}} aim of existance and activity of this discipline of economy. But simultaneously there are other elements of this concept which ought to be considered e. g. the subject and the sphere of activity. The entire concept <b>of</b> the <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> trade is confined in two basic criteria i. e. profitableness of the enterprise and the needs of the community. Some concepts take an intermediate position in this distribution. Definitions disposed to answer the first criteria regard trade as the professional purchase of economic goods for the <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> selling <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> profit. In this way the point of gravity in the commercial activity moves from the activity of exchange to the flow of benefits in the form of merchant's profit. The concept that the problem <b>of</b> the <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> trade can be solved on the grounds of profit remains in close contact with the principle accepted in capitalistic economy in running an enterprise. This concept <b>of</b> <b>purpose</b> can not explain the social and economic role of trade. The universalistic concepts represent a totally different opinion. By replacing the narrow meaning of enterprise by the broader meaning of the needs of the community the aims of these concepts change from the pursuit of profit to the method of procedure. The social functions of trade show distinctly the concepts of socialistic trade. Since numerous definitions of trade based on social grounds stress variously the meaning of different exchangeable functions and do not make its purpose precise, the following definition has been proposed in this paper: Trade is the professional mediation in the exchange of goods accomplished by means of purchase deed and bill of sale depending on association and adjustment of the aims of market methods dictated by the bidders and the receivers of goods, for the <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> optimalization of meeting the demand for consumptive and industrial goods, and minimalization of the time of transactions. The salient characteristic of this definition is, that it joins and combines all positive points of definitions of concept of trade applied before. It results also from the apparent contemporary level and developing tendency in this of materialistic culture of industrialized communities.

40|$|International audienceSimilar to {{the idea}} of a digital library, in the recent time, a new concept has emerged called an {{ontology}} library. Principally both a digital library and an ontology library have the similar kinds <b>of</b> <b>purposes</b> and objectives <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> (e. g., store, organize and provide access to the digital objects), except the kind of materials they deal with. While a digital library deals with the documents of various types, such as text, audio, video, images, etc., an ontology library deals with the ontologies (where an ontology is an intelligent object, often referred as a digital artifact, consisted of representations of the entities in terms of their types, properties and the relationships of a domain of discourse). An ontology library is a kind of organizational network that is easily accessible from any place or location and offers relevant or admissible ontologies in a well-organized manner and with a competent approach, which is based on different well-established ontology representation languages, such as RDFS, OWL, etc. The goal of an ontology library is of two-fold: (i) to provide a platform to the ontologists (a practitioner who builds the ontologies) to publish, store, preserve, share and evaluate the ontologies; (ii) to facilitate the ontofiers (an ontology user) to retrieve the right ontology at the right time to make the best (re) use of it. Besides the term ontology library, we often come across with some other related terminologies, such as ontology repository, ontology registry, and ontology directory. Conceptually they are similar kind of things but still they have some differences. An ontology repository is a collection of the ontologies and their metadata. An ontology registry consists of a list of ontologies and metadata instead of the actual ontologies. It is an architecture that allows ontology providers and users to use, share and exploit semantic information in a real world scenario. An ontology registry offers several tools and technologies which enable the users to find out the relevant ontologies as per their need. An ontology directory is a service which provides metadata and sources of information of the ontologies. Besides providing the reference services, it supports the registration services and service requests. The objective of this paper is to disseminate the result of our survey research designed based on some of the existing ontology libraries and to provide a set of guidelines that the future ontology libraries should possess to support the increasing complexity of ontology search and retrieval. The entire work is carried out as follows: we discuss the various concepts related to an ontology library. We elaborate some of the popular ontology libraries and make a comparative analysis of them from both the theoretical and implementation perspectives. We study their various features including the underlying designing principles, ontology exploitation facility, metadata, tools, etc. Based on this analysis, we finally propose the essential features and principles that an ontology library must follow. We envision that from the current work the various agencies namely, the ontology researchers, practitioners and ontology library developers will be highly benefitted...|$|R

The primary data of this study are collected from Charlotte Bronte’s Jane Eyre 163 -page novel text which published originally in 1966 by Penguin Inc, New York. The researcher himself becomes the research instrument in the process of the data collection and data analysis. Jane Eyre got some difficulties to fulfill her basic needs, in Gateshead hall she spend her childhood in loneliness, admits Mrs. Reed family in intercourse. Her needs for affection, love, and belonging can not be satisfied in Gateshead hall. Then she decide to live in Lowood institution to get better life, but here Jane still got the need is unsatisfied, physiology needs is the most hindrance in her development to concentrate in Lowood, and the place which is not enough in standard of healthy. But Jane still survives here until she becomes success student. She finds her only friend in Helen Burns, who is very learned and intelligent, has a patient and philosophical mind, and believes firmly in God. In Thornfield hall Jane applies her ability as governor it means that she try to be self actualization person.

40|$|Information {{technology}} and political motives, e. g. e-governance, {{freedom of information}} legislation, has recent years lead to an increasing emphasis on users and access to records, but little research based knowledge about those issues exist so far. The main focus of the previous research {{is the use of}} non-current records in archival repositories. The aim of this thesis is to make a contribution to the research field, in order {{to gain a better understanding}} of the information behaviour of users of records in contemporary organizational settings. The research questions addressed are: § How are records used in contemporary organizations?- In what context and for what purposes are records used?- What user categories can be identified? § How is the search for records mediated?- What intermediaries are used in the search process?- How well do the features of the artefactual intermediaries serve the users' information needs?- What is the role of human intermediaries? An additional <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> the study is to contribute to theory development, and to provide a conceptual model of the information behaviour of users of records that can form the basis for further research. The thesis is based on explorative case studies undertaken in two contemporary Swedish public organizations, one municipality and one governmental agency. Data was collected through interviews, analysis of documentary sources and complementary observations. The analysis of the findings was guided by a theoretical framework consisting of activity theory informed by concepts from archival theory and models of information behaviour. The results of the cases studies showed that information behaviour of users of records and the search process could be described as a part of an activity system. The search process was a sub-ordinated activity of other activities. The needs for records was generated by a task or accomplishment <b>of</b> anykind with <b>purpose</b> <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> something. Those needs motivated the <b>purposes</b> <b>of</b> use of records: material, operational, accountability seeking or knowledge enhancing purposes. The subjects, users in collaboration with the registrars and archivists, seeked to obtain records with help of different mediational means, e. g. artifactual intermediaries as the journal and the archives inventory that could be defined as representational systems, in order to reach a certain outcome: fact-finding, re-construction of past actions and events, regaining experience and knowledge, verifying status, or illustrating and exemplifying. A variety of user groups, internal as well as external, could be identified in both organizations. Those could act as direct or indirect users, and indirect use by one part meant direct use by another who acted as a mediator between the records and the end users. The external users could be defined as stakeholders of the organizations or other users. Users showed, with occasional exceptions, a preference for informal means of mediation, particularly personal communication. Certain features of the formal representational systems, journals and inventories, could be identified, which made them less useful as search tool. Those were generated by contradictions and tensions within the organizations: contradictions within the representational systems; contradictions between the tasks of the users and the representational systems; contradictions between user requests and the access points in the representational systems; contradictions between external users and the activities of the organizations; contradictions between exogenous institutional conditions and the the activities of the organizations; and contradictions of a temporal character. These circumstances necessitated an active intervention of human intermediaries. This could be seen as an example of the division of labour in the organizations. Search and retrieval of records were part of the registrars’ and the archivists’ specific professional knowledge, but were not considered as primary tasks of other employees or, especially not, of the external users. The results of the study contributes to to the knowledge about the use of records, and how records are approached. It provides a model of the search process that can form the basis for further research. The practical implications of the findings could be improved search tools and user services, i. e. enhanced access. The thesis can also contribute to theoretical enrichment of the field by combining a more comprehensive social theory with archival theory and concepts from information science.  Utveckling av arkiv- och informationsvetenska...|$|R

The framework developed in this paper {{could also be used}} to facilitate designing game-based research programmes. Multi Actor SystemsTechnology, Policy and Managemen...|$|R
5000|$|A PCB {{may need}} varying amounts of solder paste {{to be applied}} {{depending}} upon the design and size of components. Applying a uniform maximum level of solder {{may not be a}} good solution in this case, as these stencils often find use when [...] "pin and paste" [...] technology (i.e., printing solder paste into through-holes to avoid wave soldering) and components of significantly different pitch are used in the same PWB.
