5|$|On Shelter Island itself, NY114 acts as {{the main}} thoroughfare, once again turning along {{different}} local roads. It traverses {{the length of the}} island, and ends in historic Shelter Island Heights at the North Ferry terminal. Once across to Greenport, NY114 ends quickly at NY25, again just a block <b>or</b> <b>so</b> <b>from</b> the heart of the village. Despite the short distance between the North Ferry terminal and the northern terminus, NY114 includes three streets in Greenport. Northbound Route114 runs on Third Street from the ferry terminal to NY25. Southbound NY114 runs along Fifth Street then one block later turns left onto Wiggins Street, where it heads eastbound until it passes the historic Greenport Railroad Station, and terminates at Third Street and the North Ferry terminal. The portion of NY114 within Greenport is maintained by the village.|$|E

Thescelosaurus was {{probably}} slower than other hypsilophodonts, because of its heavier build and leg structure. Compared to them, it had unusual hindlimbs, because the upper leg was longer than the shin, the opposite of Hypsilophodon and running animals in general. One specimen {{is known to have}} had a bone pathology, with the long bones of the right foot fused at their tops, hindering swift movement.|$|E

2500|$|The British {{originally}} constructed River Fort Martello Tower in {{the early}} 19th century, {{on the site of}} a previous fort (presumed to have been built by the Spanish) to guard nearby River Landing, which was Barbuda's original quay. Confusion with the previous fort is presumably explains the claims made in Barbudian tourism publications that this was the World's first, and is its oldest, Martello tower, built in 1745. [...] The tower is located on the south coast of the island, a mile <b>or</b> <b>so</b> <b>from</b> River Landing and some seven miles south of the island's main village of Codrington. The tower is 56 feet high, has a raised gun platform and extremely thick walls, but is missing the floors.|$|E
2500|$|In June 1712, St John's {{commercial}} treaty with France, establishing free trade with that country, {{was rejected by}} the House of Commons. The treaty was presented in the Commons by Arthur Moore as St John had been created Viscount Bolingbroke earlier that year. At least 40 <b>or</b> <b>so</b> <b>from</b> the Tories voted to reject the treaty. In August 1712, Bolingbroke went to France and signed an armistice between England and France for four months. Finally, the Treaty of Utrecht was signed in March 1713 by all the allies except the emperor. The first production of Addison's Cato was made by the Whigs the occasion of a great demonstration of indignation against the peace, and by Bolingbroke for presenting the actor Barton Booth with a purse of fifty guineas for [...] "defending the cause of liberty against a perpetual dictator".|$|E
2500|$|The {{pocket holes}} require two {{drilling}} operations to be completed. The {{first is to}} counterbore the pocket hole itself, which houses the screw head within the member. This hole is stopped 1/4" [...] (5mm) <b>or</b> <b>so</b> <b>from</b> {{the edge of the}} frame member. The second step is to drill a pilot hole concentric with the pocket hole which extends through the edge of the member. The pilot hole allows the screw to pass through the member and into the adjoining member. This two stage drilling operation may be performed with two different sized drill bits, however there are special stepped bits available to perform the operation in a single pass. The drilling operation is often facilitated by a pocket hole jig which allows the user to drill the pocket hole at the correct angle and to the correct depth.|$|E

2500|$|The return {{journey was}} very {{different}} from coming down in a hospital train as a draft usually travelled at night, in practically open trucks with about 35 men packed into each truck including all their kits, rifles, 48 hours' rations, and a loaded bandolier. They would arrive at Ludd in the morning after a sleepless night in a bumping, clanking train where they would have time for a wash and a scratch meal before moving on by train to Jerusalem where the draft would be accommodated for perhaps a night or two at the Desert Mounted Corps rest camp, [...] <b>or</b> <b>so</b> <b>from</b> the station. From there they would be despatched in motor lorries down the hill to Jericho, where led horses would be sent in some miles, from the brigade bivouac, to meet them and carry them back to their units.|$|E
2500|$|Most of the {{buildings}} of the medieval Hospital and College of the Newarke, including the Collegiate Church much admired by Leland during his visit in ca. 1535, were demolished soon after the Dissolution, and the campus of De Montfort University today covers almost the whole site. In March 2015 the University opened a new [...] incorporating the remaining ruins of the Church of the Annunciation together with displays explaining {{the history of the}} Newarke area. On 17 March 2010 Patrick McKenna, founder and Chief Executive of Ingenious Media, declared open De Montfort University's new £35 million Faculty of Business and Law, adjacent to the great Gateway to The Newarke and only 100 metres <b>or</b> <b>so</b> <b>from</b> the site of Aston’s Hangman’s Lane house: this new building is called the Hugh Aston Building. The event was also marked by performances by singers from the choir of the Holy Cross Dominican Priory, New Walk, Leicester (directed by David Cowen) of sections from Aston's Te Deum Mass and Te Deum, two of Aston's keyboard compositions, and some of the 'Sarum Rite' medieval plainsong for 17 March - St. Patrick's Day.|$|E
2500|$|The chancel {{still remains}} in the east wing and has some reconstructed colonial features. It is on a {{platform}} raised a foot <b>or</b> <b>so</b> <b>from</b> the church floor. On {{either side of the}} window opening are simple rectangular tablets bearing on the left The Lord’s Prayer above the Apostles' Creed and on the right Exodus XX (The Ten Commandments) under which is printed the Summary of the Law. In the middle is a reredos, obviously of non-colonial origin with an opening for the window incorporated within it. It bears, from the top down: 1) a cross placed so as to intersect center of the circular window; 2) a truncated tympanum, 3) a square-columned pilaster {{on either side of the}} window, and 4) a bottom forming a flat window sill. [...] The chancel is physically separated from the rest of the church by [...] vertical panels a few feet north and south of the window openings and a rail with 8 turned balusters on either side and a central opening. There are south and north facing [...] seats in the space between the side panels and the outer walls, on the north a built-in slip pew and on the south a short bench.|$|E

2500|$|On November 4, 1993, Chrétien was {{appointed}} by Governor General Ray Hnatyshyn as prime minister. While Trudeau, Joe Clark and Mulroney had been relative political outsiders prior to becoming prime minister, Chrétien had served in every Liberal cabinet since 1965. This experience gave him knowledge of the Canadian parliamentary system, and allowed Chrétien to establish a very centralized government that, although highly efficient, was also lambasted by critics such as Jeffrey Simpson and the media as being a [...] "friendly dictatorship" [...] and intolerant of internal dissent. The political scientist Donald Savoie wrote that under Chrétien's authoritarian style of leadership that [...] "Cabinet has now joined Parliament as an institution being by-passed" [...] while Simpson wrote that Chrétien possessed [...] " [...] a streak of terrible pettiness and vengeance directed against those who have crossed him". Reflecting the relative impotence of Parliament, the most powerful advisors to Chrétien were a triumvirate comprising his wife Aline, his Chief of Staff Jean Pelletier and his right-hand man Eddie Goldenberg, none of whom held {{a seat in the}} House of Commons. Chrétien liked to present himself as the heir to Trudeau, but his governing style had little in common with the intense bouts of governmental activism that had characterised the Trudeau era. The Chrétien government had a cautious, managerial approach to governing, reacting to issues as they arose, and was otherwise inclined to inactivity. The most common critique of the Chrétien government, especially in its first 15 months <b>or</b> <b>so</b> <b>from</b> late 1993 to early 1995 was that the government had been [...] "sleepwalking".|$|E
