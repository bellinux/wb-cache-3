40|$|Despite {{the clarity}} of the {{sequential}} segmential segmental approach to complex congenital heart malformations, the classification of hearts with <b>overriding</b> arterial <b>valves</b> remains contentious. A series of 67 hearts, all with <b>overriding</b> arterial <b>valves,</b> has therefore been studied in an attempt to provide clear and unambiguous criteria for their classification. There were 51 hearts with an <b>overriding</b> aortic <b>valve,</b> 13 hearts with an <b>overriding</b> pulmonary <b>valve</b> and 3 specimens with <b>overriding</b> of both <b>valves.</b> In each of these categories the degree of override and the underlying morphology varied considerably. The options to classify these hearts are limited. Using the " 50 per cent rule" as a device to catalogue the type of connexion - irrespective of the morphology - all hearts were described in unambiguous fashion. A comparison with synonyms, as frequently used for purposes of classification, revealed that the latter are often insufficient properly to classify the basic abnormality. By classifying the type of connexion and describing the morphology separately, no basic problem remains in distinguishing between hearts with double outlet right ventricle and subpulmonary ventricular septal defect and hearts with the morphology of Fallot's tetralogy with an aorta almost exclusively arising from the right ventricle. Similarly, the classification of hearts with complete transposition and subpulmonary defect in the setting of the so-called Taussig-Bing heart is brought back to its proper perspective. Proper and consistent application of the sequential segmental approach leaves no room for ambiguity, even in complicated hearts with <b>overriding</b> arterial <b>valve...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{four year}} old girl with {{pulmonary}} atresia had a straddling tricuspid valve without an interventricular communication. The <b>overriding</b> tricuspid <b>valve</b> had two orifices, which {{connected with the}} right and the left ventricles. Valve tissue separated both orifices and was firmly connected to the crest of the ventricular septum, thus sealing off the expected interventricular communication. Surgical correction was performed and the outcome was satisfactory...|$|R
50|$|Pumping brakes {{are often}} used where a pump is already part of the machinery. For example, an {{internal}}-combustion piston motor can have the fuel supply stopped, and then internal pumping losses of the engine create some braking. Some engines use a <b>valve</b> <b>override</b> called a Jake brake to greatly increase pumping losses. Pumping brakes can dump energy as heat, or can be regenerative brakes that recharge a pressure reservoir called a hydraulic accumulator.|$|R
40|$|Background—Transforming growth factor-b 2 (TGF-b 2) is {{a member}} of a family of growth factors with the {{potential}} to modify multiple processes. Mice deficient in the TGF-b 2 gene die around birth and show a variety of defects of different organs, including the heart. Methods and Results—We studied the hearts of TGF-b 2 –null mouse embryos from 11. 5 to 18. 5 days of gestation to analyze the types of defects and determine which processes of cardiac morphogenesis are affected by the absence of TGF-b 2. Analysis of serial sections revealed malformations of the outflow tract (typically a double-outlet right ventricle) in 87. 5 %. There was 1 case of common arterial trunk. Abnormal thickening of the semilunar valves was seen in 4. 2 %. Associated malformations of the atrioventricular (AV) canal were found in 62. 5 % and were composed of perimem-branous inlet ventricular septal defects (37. 5 %), AV valve thickening (33. 3 %), <b>overriding</b> tricuspid <b>valve</b> (25. 0 %), and complete AV septal defects (4. 2 %). Anomalies of the aorta and its branches were seen in 33. 3 %. Immunohistochemical staining showed failure of myocardialization of the mesenchyme of the atrial septum and the ventricular outflow tract as well as deficient valve differentiation. Morphometry documented this to be associated with absence of the normal decrease of total endocardial cushion volume in the older stages. Apoptosis in TGF-b 2 –knockout mice was increased, although regional distribution was normal. Conclusions—TGF-b 2 –knockout mice exhibited characteristic cardiovascular anomalies comparable to malformation...|$|R
40|$|A 3 -day-old alpaca cria {{presented}} for progressive weakness and dyspnea since birth. Complete bloodwork, thoracic radiographs, and endoscopic {{examination of the}} nasal passages and distal trachea revealed no significant findings. Echocardiogram and contrast study revealed a single artery overriding a large ventricular septal defect (VSD). A small atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale was also noted. Color flow Doppler and an agitated saline contrast study revealed bidirectional but primarily right to left flow through the VSD and bidirectional shunting through the atrial defect. Differential diagnosis based on echocardiographic findings included common arterial trunk, Tetralogy of Fallot, and pulmonary atresia with a VSD. Postmortem examination revealed a large common arterial trunk with a quadricuspid <b>valve</b> <b>overriding</b> a VSD. Additionally, defect in the atrial septum {{was determined to be}} a patent foramen ovale. A single pulmonary trunk arose from the common arterial trunk and bifurcated to the left and right pulmonary artery, consistent with a Collet and Edwards’ type I common arterial trunk with aortic predominance. Although uncommon, congenital cardiac defects should be considered in animals presenting with clinical signs of hypoxemia, dyspnea, or failure to thrive...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Trisomy 9 {{is a rare}} {{chromosomal}} abnormality {{usually associated}} with first-trimester miscarriage; few fetuses survive until the second trimester. We report two new cases of complete trisomy 9 that both present unusual phenotypic associations, and we analyze the genetic pathway involved in this chromosomal abnormality. Case report: The first fetus investigated showed Dandy-Walker malformation, cleft lip, and cleft palate) at the second trimester scan. Cardiovascular abnormalities were characterized by a right-sided, U-shaped aortic arch associated with a ventricular septal defect (VSD). Symmetrical intrauterine growth restriction and multicystic dysplastic kidney disease were associated findings. The second fetus showed a dysmorphic face, bilateral cleft lip, hypoplastic corpus callosum, and a Dandy-Walker malformation. Postmortem examination revealed cardiovascular abnormalities such as persistent left superior vena cava draining into the coronary sinus, membranous ventricular septal defect, <b>overriding</b> aorta, pulmonary <b>valve</b> with two cusps and three sinuses, and {{the origin of the}} left subclavian artery distal to the junction of ductus arteriosus and aortic arch.

40|$|Sixteen {{patients}} with a straddling tricuspid and two with a straddling mitral valve were identified by two dimensional echocardiography. In all but one the atrioventricular valves appeared at the same level, indicating absence of the ventriculoatrial septum. A straddling valve was diagnosed by identifying subvalvular apparatus from one atrioventricular valve in both chambers, independent of whether they were ventricles or rudimentary chambers. Further confirmation was obtained during real time study where the valve leaflets appeared to fly through the ventricular septal defect. <b>Overriding</b> of the <b>valve</b> annulus was greater than 50 % in 12 and less than 50 % in five, with one other patient having none detectable. The relation of the central fibrous body {{to the tip of}} the interventricular septum was reliable in assessing overriding of greater than 50 %, but where it was less than 50 % other views were necessary to detect its presence. The diagnosis of straddling with or without overriding of an atrioventricular valve can be reliably made by two dimensional echocardiography, and carries important implications relating to the type of surgical intervention possible, and in those with a straddling tricuspid valve, the position of the atrioventricular node...|$|R

40|$|IntroductionPrevious {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that in cardiac surgical patients, TEE provides essential information before and after cardiopulmonary bypass regarding cardiac performance, valve function, and congenital anomalies. Significant residual abnormalities may be missed during TOF surgical repair. The result is often post-operative morbidity and mortality and sometimes the need for reoperation. ObjectivesTo determine impact and accuracy of perioperative TEE in assessment of patients undergoing TOF total repair. MethodsThe study included 50 patients with TOF referred to Cardiothoracic Surgery Department Ain Shams University Hospitals for total repair. Each patient was subjected to history taking, clinical examination, routine preoperative investigations, preoperative TTE, perioperative TEE and Post recovery TTE. ResultsOur study population included 45 (90 %) pediatric patients and 5 (10 %) adults. Youngest was 1 year 2 months old and oldest was 25 years old. Their weight ranged from 8 to 85 Kg. TEE was feasible in 49 cases (98 %) while the pediatric probe failed to be introduced in only one patient. TEE was able to visualize LM coronary artery in 96 % of cases, and visualized RCA in 70 % of cases. TEE newly detected a case with separate ostea of LAD and LCX. Only one patient developed non sustained runs of SVTThere was significant difference between TEE and TTE as regard IAS visualization (P value < 0. 0001). All our patients had only subaortic VSD except 4 patients. Three had doubly commited subarterial VSD seen by both TTE and TEE, while one patient had subaortic VSD with inlet extension, which was visualized only by TEE. Postoperative TEE detected residual small VSD in 29 cases of whom 14 cases had the VSD closed spontaneously by the time of TTE. TEE missed small residual VSD in 3 cases. In one case postoperative TEE showed a serpignous mid muscular VSD which was not detected preoperatively. There was moderate agreement between TEE and TTE regarding <b>overriding</b> of aortic <b>valve</b> (weighted Kappa 0. 580). There was strong agreement between TTE and TEE in assessment of postoperative PR (r o. 8594, P< 0. 0001). Preoperative TEE showed major impact in 2 cases (4 %). In one case total repair was decided instead of shunt operation. While in the other TEE newly detected TV chordae attached to IVS crest with inlet extension of VSD. Preoperative TEE had minor impact in 29 cases (59 %) by adding new information which did not alter surgical plan, as visualization of coronaries and IAS. TEE showed major postoperative impact in 2 cases (4 %) in the form of second run of CPB and RVOT reconstruction. Minor impact in the form of detection of relieved RVOT obstruction, absence of residual shunts, preserved biventricular function in 47 cases (94 %). ConclusionTEE imaging is a safe, feasible, and accurate tool for anatomical, hemodynamic, and functional assessment in patients with TOF during surgical repair. TEE offers the advantage of permitting visualization of the operative procedure in real time and provides guidance for the surgeon in making decisions inside the operating room...|$|R
