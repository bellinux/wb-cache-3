5|$|Cardiovascular {{disease is}} the leading cause of death (30%) amongst women in the United States, and the leading cause of chronic disease amongst them, {{affecting}} nearly 40% (Gronowski and Schindler, Tables I and IV). The onset occurs at a later age in women than in men. For instance the incidence of stroke in women under the age of 80 is less than that in men, but higher in those aged over 80. Overall the lifetime risk of stroke in women exceeds that in men. The risk <b>of</b> <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>disease</b> amongst those with diabetes and amongst smokers is also higher in women than in men. Many aspects <b>of</b> <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>disease</b> vary between women and men, including risk factors, prevalence, physiology, symptoms, response to intervention and outcome.|$|E

GST gene polymorphisms, which are among antioxidant system enzymes, have a relationship with each of the factors that are considered among the risk factors for <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>diseases.</b> Consequently, {{it can be said that}} the polymorphisms of GST genes are effective both in the risk factors <b>of</b> <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>diseases</b> and directly in <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>diseases...</b>|$|R

Some relatively common adverse events include: lipodystrophy syndrome, dyslipidemia, and diabetes mellitus, especially with protease inhibitors. Other common symptoms include diarrhea, and an increased risk <b>of</b> <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>disease.</b> Newer recommended treatments are associated with fewer adverse effects. Certain medications may be associated with birth defects and therefore may be unsuitable for women hoping to have children.|$|E

5|$|Aspirin {{appears to}} offer little benefit to those at {{lower risk of}} heart attack or strokeâ€”for instance, those without a history of these events or with {{pre-existing}} disease. Some studies recommend aspirin on a case-by-case basis, while others have suggested the risks of other events, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, were enough to outweigh any potential benefit, and recommended against using aspirin for primary prevention entirely. Aspirin has also been suggested as a component of a polypill for prevention <b>of</b> <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>disease.</b>|$|E

There is some evidence that aspirin is effective at preventing colorectal cancer, though the mechanisms of this effect are unclear.

5|$|Cardiovascular {{diseases}}, {{which include}} {{diseases of the}} heart, are {{the leading cause of}} death worldwide. The majority <b>of</b> <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>disease</b> is noncommunicable and related to lifestyle and other factors, becoming more prevalent with ageing. Heart disease is a major cause of death, accounting for an average of 30% of all deaths in 2008, globally. This rate varies from a lower 28% to a high 40% in high-income countries. Doctors that specialise in the heart are called cardiologists. Many other medical professionals are involved in treating diseases of the heart, including doctors such as general practitioners, cardiothoracic surgeons and intensivists, and allied health practitioners including physiotherapists and dieticians.|$|E

Subsequent attacks in 1984, 1988, 2000, and 2010 have resulted in moderate contractile dysfunction of his left ventricle. He underwent four-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting in 1988, coronary artery stenting in November 2000, urgent coronary balloon angioplasty in March 2001, and the implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator in June, 2001.|$|E

5|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that {{hypopituitarism}} is associated with an increased risk <b>of</b> <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>disease</b> and some also an increased risk of death of about 50% to 150% the normal population. It has been difficult to establish which hormone deficiency is responsible for this risk, as almost all patients studied had growth hormone deficiency. The studies also do not answer the question as to whether the hypopituitarism itself causes the increased mortality, or whether some of the risk is to be attributed to the treatments, some of which (such as sex hormone supplementation) have a recognized adverse effect on cardiovascular risk.|$|E
5|$|The major {{differences}} in life expectancy for women between {{developed and developing}} countries lie in the childbearing years. If a woman survives this period, {{the differences between the}} two regions become less marked, since in later life non-communicable diseases (NCDs) become the major causes of death in women throughout the world, with cardiovascular deaths accounting for 45% of deaths in older women, followed by cancer (15%) and lung disease (10%). These create additional burdens on the resources of developing countries. Changing lifestyles, including diet, physical activity and cultural factors that favour larger body size in women, are contributing to an increasing problem with obesity and diabetes amongst women in these countries and increasing the risks <b>of</b> <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>disease</b> and other NCDs.|$|E
5|$|Accelerated {{deposition}} of cholesterol {{in the walls}} of arteries leads to atherosclerosis, the underlying cause <b>of</b> <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>disease.</b> The most common problem in FH {{is the development of}} coronary artery disease (atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries that supply the heart) at a much younger age than would be expected in the general population. This may lead to angina pectoris (chest pain or tightness on exertion) or heart attacks. Less commonly, arteries of the brain are affected; this may lead to transient ischemic attacks (brief episodes of weakness {{on one side of the}} body or inability to talk) or occasionally stroke. Peripheral artery occlusive disease (obstruction of the arteries of the legs) occurs mainly in people with FH who smoke; this can cause pain in the calf muscles during walking that resolves with rest (intermittent claudication) and problems due to a decreased blood supply to the feet (such as gangrene).|$|E

A pattern compatible with hyperlipoproteinemia type IIa on the Fredrickson classification is typically found: raised level of total cholesterol, markedly raised level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), normal level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and normal level of triglycerides. Total cholesterol levels of 350â€“550 mg/dL are typical of heterozygous FH while total cholesterol levels of 650â€“1000 mg/dL are typical of homozygous FH. The LDL is typically above the 75th percentile, that is, 75% of the healthy population would have a lower LDL level. Cholesterol levels can be drastically higher in people with FH who are also obese.|$|E
5|$|In adults, {{occupational}} exposure {{is the main}} cause of lead poisoning. People can be exposed when working in facilities that produce a variety of lead-containing products; these include radiation shields, ammunition, certain surgical equipment, developing dental x-ray films prior to digital x-rays (each film packet had a lead liner to prevent the radiation from going through), fetal monitors, plumbing, circuit boards, jet engines, and ceramic glazes. In addition, lead miners and smelters, plumbers and fitters, auto mechanics, glass manufacturers, construction workers, battery manufacturers and recyclers, firing range instructors, and plastic manufacturers are at risk for lead exposure. Other occupations that present lead exposure risks include welding, manufacture of rubber, printing, zinc and copper smelting, processing of ore, combustion of solid waste, and production of paints and pigments. Parents who are exposed to lead in the workplace can bring lead dust home on clothes or skin and expose their children. Occupational exposure to lead increases the risk <b>of</b> <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>disease,</b> in particular: stroke, and high blood pressure.|$|E
