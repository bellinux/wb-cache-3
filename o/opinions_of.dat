40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} {{in order to determine}} the relationship between enjoyment of music in a live setting and enjoyment of wine consumed while at the concert. Surveys were collected from 113 respondents throughout the summer of 2011 at San Luis Obispo’s “Concerts in the Plaza. ” J. Lohr Vineyards and Wines was the wine sponsor throughout the summer concert series, which represented a wide variety of musical genres. Overall, 80 % of the sample was women, 69 % drank white wine, and 93 % had tried J. Lohr wines before the event. With regard to wine <b>opinion,</b> 57 % <b>of</b> the sample maintained the same <b>opinion</b> <b>of</b> the wine before and during the live music event. Regression analysis was used to explain the change in <b>opinion</b> <b>of</b> wine by various factors such as <b>opinion</b> <b>of</b> music at the event and previous <b>opinion</b> <b>of</b> wine. The analysis suggests that <b>opinion</b> <b>of</b> the live music was not a statistically significant factor influencing <b>opinion</b> <b>of</b> wine consumed at the live music event. The only variables that significantly influenced <b>opinion</b> <b>of</b> wine at the concert were the respondents’ previous <b>opinion</b> <b>of</b> wine and frequency of listening to music while drinking wine. Both of these variables positively correlated with <b>opinion</b> <b>of</b> wine consumed at the event. The inability for the respondent to separate previous and current <b>opinion</b> <b>of</b> the wine could have contributed to the lack of significant results, as on average the sample had a somewhat positive <b>opinion</b> <b>of</b> the wine before and after the concert, regardless <b>of</b> the respondents’ <b>opinion</b> <b>of</b> the live music. Recommendations for further research include isolating the wine and music variables so no outside factors influence opinion. Serving the wine to respondents without their knowledge of the brand would eliminate their ability to associate previous opinions with the current experience influenced by the presence of varying music...|$|R

5|$|At {{the time}} there was a growing {{movement}} to attract native intelligentsia, educated at schools run by the Dutch colonial government, and convince them to view domestic films, which were generally considered to be of much lower quality than imported Hollywood productions. This was blamed, in part, on the dominance of theatrically trained actors and crew. As such, Ariffien invited Gani, at the time a medical doctor and a prominent member of the nationalist movement, to join the cast. Although some nationalists considered Gani's involvement in Asmara Moerni as besmirching the independence movement, Gani considered it necessary: he believed audiences needed to have higher <b>opinions</b> <b>of</b> domestic film productions.|$|E
