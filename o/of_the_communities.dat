5|$|During {{the later}} 20th century and afterward, many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>communities</b> and {{businesses}} in the area began cooperative efforts, including the Clear Lake Area Chamber of Commerce, the Bay Area Houston Economic Partnership, and the Bay Area Houston Transportation Partnership, to create a distinct economic and civic identity for the region and to plan regional development. Though most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>communities</b> {{in the region have}} been incorporated into municipalities, a few unincorporated communities remain under the extra-territorial jurisdiction of neighboring towns. These include San Leon, Bacliff, and Smith Point. The communities of San Leon and Bacliff, despite their seaside location, their proximity to the relatively prosperous Clear Lake Area, and the development of summer resort communities there in the early 20th century, have suffered economic decline since the mid-20th century and are among the least affluent parts of the Bay Area today.|$|E

5|$|A {{settlement}} and cemetery of the Lengyel-Polgár cultural zone, dated around or after 4600 BCE, {{was discovered in}} Ślęza, Wrocław County. It consisted of a central long trapezoidal house accompanied by several post-built supporting structures. Among the large explored settlements of the Lengyel culture from the 4400-4000 BCE period, there is one in Brześć Kujawski, and another one in Osłonki, solidly fortified about 4200 BCE after an assault incident involving arson and murder, both located in the Kujawy region. At the Osłonki settlement nearly 30 trapezoidal houses and over 80 graves were located, some of them with many copper ornaments. The agricultural and construction activities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>communities</b> centered on the two large settlements (hunting and fishing were also practiced) caused very likely an accumulation of environmental damage, which eventually forced them to abandon the area. 4th millennium BC constructions reinforced with ditches and palisades and ceramics molded into figural representations of the Lengyel-Polgár culture were located in Podłęże, Wieliczka County.|$|E
5|$|Across {{the county}} line in Lake Luzerne, NY9N begins {{to deviate from}} the Hudson River, {{gradually}} curving to the northeast as it passes through the hamlets of Lake Luzerne, Fourth Lake, and Lake Vanare, {{all of which are}} named for small lakes bearing those names near the center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>communities.</b> Just northeast of Lake Vanare, NY9N enters the town of Lake George, where it connects to I-87 (the Adirondack Northway) at exit21 and meets US9. Here, it joins its parent route northward toward the village of Lake George. The conjoined routes intersect the northern end of NY9L just south of the village line before becoming Canada Street and entering the village limits upon crossing over West Brook. US9 and NY9N serve as the primary north–south thoroughfare through the village before splitting {{at the north end of}} the village.

5|$|Despite {{the shift}} in policy from {{educational}} assimilation to integration, the removal of Indigenous children from their families by state officials continued {{through much of the}} 1960s and 70s. The removals were the result of the 1951 addition of Section 88 to the Indian Act, which allowed for the application of provincial laws to Indigenous peoples living on reserves in instances where federal laws were not in place. The change included the monitoring of child welfare. With no requirement for specialized training regarding the traditions or lifestyles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>communities</b> they entered, provincial officials assessed the welfare of Indigenous children based on Euro-Canadian values that, for example, deemed traditional diets of game, fish and berries insufficient and grounds for taking children into custody. This period resulted in the widespread removal of Indigenous children from their traditional communities, first termed the Sixties Scoop by Patrick Johnston, the author of the 1983 report Native Children and the Child Welfare System. Often taken without the consent of their parents or community elders, some children were placed in state-run child welfare facilities, increasingly operated in former residential schools, while others were fostered or placed up for adoption by predominantly non-Indigenous families throughout Canada and the United States. While the Indian and Northern Affairs estimates that 11,132 children were adopted between 1960 and 1990, the actual number may be as high as 20,000.|$|E

5|$|NASA's Johnson Space Center (JSC) was {{established}} in the area in 1963. That and the explosive growth of neighboring Houston in the mid-20th century, especially the 1970s and 1980s, caused the remainder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>communities</b> on the southwestern shore to urbanize. The Clear Lake City community was created by the Friendswood Development Company, a venture of Humble Oil and Dell E. Webb Corporation, to support residential growth near the new NASA facility. The communities around Clear Lake rapidly reoriented toward aerospace related industries, and the region's economy diversified further. Urban development spread solidly between Houston and the Bay Area communities. Houston formally annexed most of Clear Lake City in 1977 with Pasadena annexing most of the rest. Most of the other communities around the bay, however, had already incorporated, or incorporated soon afterward, and thus were independent of the metropolis. Texas State Historical Association.|$|E
5|$|Some Euryarchaeota are methanogens (archaea {{that produce}} methane {{as a result}} of metabolism) living in {{anaerobic}} environments, such as swamps. This form of metabolism evolved early, and it is even possible that the first free-living organism was a methanogen. A common reaction involves the use of carbon dioxide as an electron acceptor to oxidize hydrogen. Methanogenesis involves a range of coenzymes that are unique to these archaea, such as coenzyme M and methanofuran. Other organic compounds such as alcohols, acetic acid or formic acid are used as alternative electron acceptors by methanogens. These reactions are common in gut-dwelling archaea. Acetic acid is also broken down into methane and carbon dioxide directly, by acetotrophic archaea. These acetotrophs are archaea in the order Methanosarcinales, and are a major part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>communities</b> of microorganisms that produce biogas.|$|E
