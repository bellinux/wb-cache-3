30|$|Gas pool coupled {{activating}} TIG (GPCA-TIG) welding {{put forward}} in-house can dramatically enhance weld penetration of TIG welding through introducing active element oxygen {{to reverse the}} Marangoni convection flow in the molten pool. In order to further improve the welding productivity, the normal solid tungsten electrode {{is replaced by a}} kind of coupling <b>arc</b> <b>electrode.</b> The changes of arc pressure distribution along anode surface and the weld appearance were evaluated. On this basis, the dependences of weld shape characterized with weld depth, width and undercut on the main welding parameters were discussed. The results indicate, the substitution of coupling <b>arc</b> <b>electrode</b> can lead to an obvious decrease of arc pressure. Compared to hollow tungsten electrode and twin tungsten <b>electrodes,</b> the coupling <b>arc</b> <b>electrode</b> is much easier to manufacture and has more compacter structure.

40|$|Purpose: Contact lens {{electrodes}} (CLEs) {{are frequently}} used to register electroretinograms (ERGs) in small {{animals such as}} mice or rats. CLEs are expensive to buy or difficult to be produced individually. In addition, CLE`s have been noticed to elicit inconstant results and they carry potential to injure the cornea. Therefore, a new <b>electrode</b> <b>holder</b> was constructed based on the clinically used DTL-electrode and compared to CLEs. Material and methods: ERGs were recorded with both electrode types in nine healthy Brown-Norway rats under scotopic conditions. For low intensity responses a Naka-Rushton function was fitted and the parameters V(max), k and n were analyzed. The a-wave, b-wave and oscillatory potentials were analyzed for brighter flash intensities (1 - 60 scot cd s/m(2)). Repeatability was assessed for both electrode types in consecutive measurements. Results: The new <b>electrode</b> <b>holder</b> was faster in setting up than the CLE and showed lower standard deviations. No corneal alterations were observed. Slightly higher amplitudes were recorded {{in most of the}} measurements with the new <b>electrode</b> <b>holder</b> (except amplitudes induced by 60 cd s/m(2)). A Bland-Altman test showed good agreement between the DTL holder and the CLE (mean difference 35. 2 mu V (Holder-CLE)). Pearson`s correlation coefficient for test-retest-reliability was r = 0. 783. Conclusions: The DTL holder was superior in handling and caused far less corneal problems than the CLE and produced comparable or better electrophysiological results. The minimal production costs and the possibility of adapting the DTL holder to bigger eyes, such as for dogs or rabbits, offers with broader application prospects. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V.

30|$|In this study, a novel {{variation}} of activated TIG welding method called Gas Pool Coupled Activating TIG (GPCA-TIG) welding with coupling <b>arc</b> <b>electrode</b> is put forward to actualize a TIG welding process simultaneously with deep penetration and high welding speed. This process {{is based on}} a specialized double layers gas shielded TIG welding method named GPCA-TIG welding [32] developed in-house. The inner inert shielding gas is to prevent tungsten electrode from oxidation. The outer pure/mixing gas contains oxygen and/or nitrogen elements. Oxygen is introduced to dramatically increase weld depth, while nitrogen to improve weld quality. The relative position between the outer and inner convergent nozzles, simplified as a variable h named coupling degree, can be changed to adjust the coupled area and position between the outer activating gas and molten pool surface and control the weld shape and properties. The kind of coupling <b>arc</b> <b>electrode</b> was developed in-house to decrease arc pressure by cutting the tip of normal solid clubbed tungsten into four identical parts. Through analyzing the arc pressure and the influences of welding parameter on weld appearance, the feasibility of this process is discussed in this paper.|$|R
50|$|To {{strike the}} {{electric}} <b>arc,</b> the <b>electrode</b> {{is brought into}} contact with the workpiece by a very light touch with the electrode to the base metal then is pulled back slightly. This initiates the arc and thus the melting of the workpiece and the consumable electrode, and causes droplets of the electrode to be passed from the electrode to the weld pool. Striking an arc, which varies widely based upon electrode and workpiece composition, can be the hardest skill for beginners. The orientation of the electrode to workpiece is where most stumble, if the electrode is held at a perpendicular angle to the workpiece the tip will likely stick to the metal which will fuse the electrode to the workpiece which will cause it to heat up very rapidly. The tip of the electrode needs to be at a lower angle to the workpiece, which allows the weld pool to flow out of the <b>arc.</b> As the <b>electrode</b> melts, the flux covering disintegrates, giving off shielding gases that protect the weld area from oxygen and other atmospheric gases. In addition, the flux provides molten slag which covers the filler metal as it travels from the electrode to the weld pool. Once part of the weld pool, the slag floats to the surface and protects the weld from contamination as it solidifies. Once hardened, it must be chipped away to reveal the finished weld. As welding progresses and the electrode melts, the welder must periodically stop welding to remove the remaining electrode stub and insert a new electrode into the <b>electrode</b> <b>holder.</b> This activity, combined with chipping away the slag, reduces {{the amount of time that}} the welder can spend laying the weld, making SMAW one of the least efficient welding processes. In general, the operator factor, or the percentage of operator's time spent laying weld, is approximately 25%.|$|R

40|$|This methodological paper {{provides}} {{a detailed description}} of a novel ultralownoise pre- and main-amplifier system designed for the extracellular recording of voltage spikes produced by neuronal action potentials. The main difficulties with extracellular recording are the unwanted electrical signals that lower the recording quality. They include destructive interferences by alternating electric or magnetic fields, in addition to thermal and other random noises resulting from the intrinsic properties of the substances from which the electrode and the electrical circuit are made. The preamplifier is placed in a specially built metal headstage probe. It is designed so that microelectrodes can be plugged directly into the probe, keeping the electrode and preamplifier in the closest possible proximity. Unique <b>electrode</b> <b>holder</b> adaptors at the same time make the probe for the <b>electrode</b> <b>holder</b> with the added benefit of extended electrical shielding. The main amplifier contains tuned circuit band pass filters optimized for metal and carbon fiber microelectrodes. Electromagnetic interference pickup is reduced by the enclosing tin-plated iron box and a built-in 50 / 60 Hz reject filter. In test experiments, an excellent signal-to-noise ratio and low-noise baseline recording were achieved. When carbon fiber microelectrodes were applied in the medulla of anesthetized rats, the total peak-to-peak noise level of the system was about 25 µV, i. e., about 6 µV RMS, which is only a few µV higher than the theoretical random noise. It is concluded that, in combination with carbon fiber electrodes, the present amplifiers do not contribute significantly to the overall noise...|$|R
