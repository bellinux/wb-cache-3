5|$|Thorpe {{is known}} for his {{interests}} in fashion, and serves as an ambassador for Armani, and has his own line <b>of</b> <b>designer</b> jewellery and underwear. During his career, Thorpe {{was one of the most}} prominent and popular sportspeople in Australia. Despite competing in a sport in which the vast majority of international athletes' earnings are below the poverty line, marketing surveys consistently ranked Thorpe as the most sought-after Australian athlete for sponsorship deals, surpassing footballers who compete on a weekly basis in much larger stadia. Aside from his swimsuit sponsor Adidas, Thorpe was sponsored by Australian corporate giants such as Qantas, Telstra, and the Seven Network.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{development}} {{began in}} November 2008 when Urban Squall met in San Diego for their annual meeting, 2008's theme was 'a {{game in a}} week'. The team consisted <b>of</b> <b>designer</b> and programmer Andrew Pellerano, programmer Panayoti Haritatos, graphic designer Tim Wendorf and musician Nick Esposito. The developers hired two adjoining hotel rooms and opened the connecting door, allowing them to concentrate solely on creating the game {{over a period of}} five days, resulting in a demo. Pellerano spent further weeks updating the game during his spare time after which it was released to the public. During the weeks between the initial demo version and the game's release, Wendorf playtested the game and provided feedback on the number of souls needed to allow special abilities to be activated. The music track was created one night when Pellerano met Esposito in the latter's studio, during which Pellerano also voiced the sound effects resulting from Cuties being killed.|$|E

5|$|On December 12, 2001, Ryder {{was arrested}} on {{shoplifting}} charges in Beverly Hills, California. She was accused of stealing $5,500 worth <b>of</b> <b>designer</b> clothes and accessories at a Saks Fifth Avenue department store. In the security offices of the store, before Ryder was arrested by the Los Angeles Police Department, she signed two civil demands that bound her {{to pay for the}} stolen and surrendered merchandise, as permitted under California's Statute for Civil Recovery for Shoplifting. Los Angeles District Attorney Stephen Cooley produced a team of eight prosecutors, and filed four felony charges against her. Ryder hired noted celebrity defense attorney Mark Geragos. Negotiations for a plea bargain failed at the end of summer 2002. As noted by Joel Mowbray from National Review, the prosecution was not ready to offer the actress an open door to a no-contest plea on misdemeanor charges.|$|E
5|$|The Klingons {{received}} {{the first major}} revision in design since their appearance in The Motion Picture. Dodie Shepard designed new red and black uniforms for Chancellor Gorkon and his staff, as it was judged {{that it would be}} unseemly for the chancellor to wear common warrior garb. Another concern was that there was not enough <b>of</b> <b>designer</b> Robert Fletcher's The Motion Picture uniforms for all the Klingons in the film. While the important Klingons were given multi-layered prosthetics and unique head ridges, background characters wore ready-made masks, with minor touch-ups on the eyes and mouth. Since it was important for the actors' expressions to be visible through the makeup, the appliances were made thin using the latest glues and paints. Transforming an actor into a Klingon took three and a half hours. Hairstylist Jan Alexander designed braids and jewelry that suggested a tribal people with a long and treasured heritage.|$|E

25|$|The fanciers <b>of</b> <b>designer</b> dogs {{respond that}} all modern dog breeds were created from earlier breeds {{and types of}} dogs through {{the same kind of}} {{selective}} breeding that is used to create designer dogs. The Toy Poodle was bred down in size from larger poodles, most likely by crossing with various very small Bichon types, such as the Maltese and Havanese. Most of the modern breeds have ancestries that include various older dog types and breeds; see individual breed articles for details of the origin of each breed.|$|E

25|$|During the 1970s, Vanderbilt {{ventured into}} the fashion business, first with Glentex, {{licensing}} her name for a line of scarves. In 1976, Indian designer Mohan Murjani's Murjani Corporation, proposed launching a line <b>of</b> <b>designer</b> jeans carrying Vanderbilt's signature embroidered on the back pocket, {{as well as her}} swan logo. Her jeans were more tightly fitted than other jeans of that time. The logo eventually appeared on dresses and perfumes, while Vanderbilt also launched a line of blouses, sheets, shoes, leather goods, liqueurs, and accessories. Vanderbilt {{was one of the first}} designers to make public appearances, which was a difficult thing for her because of her shyness.|$|E
25|$|Another {{defining}} characteristic <b>of</b> <b>designer</b> dogs is {{that they}} are usually bred as companions and pets. Working and hunting dogs deliberately crossbred for a particular working purpose are not generally given portmanteau names; they are most often referred to by a type (not breed) name, such as Eurohounds (racing sled dogs) or Lurchers (hunting dogs). These dogs could be considered only as cross breeds, not as designer animals, since appearance is not the main reason for them to be bred. An exception to this is the Labradoodle, which although having a Portmanteau name, is often used as a Guide or Assistance dog as well as being popular family dogs.|$|E
