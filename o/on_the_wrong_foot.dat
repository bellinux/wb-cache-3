When Morgan's brother Michael (Chad Duell) forces Morgan {{to go back home}} to Port Charles, Kiki follows and moves in with Morgan and Michael. While they initially get off <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>foot,</b> Kiki softens toward Michael when she learns why he is so protective of Morgan. Kiki is shocked when her mother Ava Jerome (Maura West) confesses that her father, Franco (Roger Howarth) is very much alive. In addition, Kiki is also shocked to learn that Ava is a member of powerful Jerome crime family that is challenging Michael and Morgan's father Sonny Corinthos (Maurice Benard) for his territory. After they kiss, Michael and Kiki are led to believe they are cousins. Noticing the attraction, Morgan convinces Kiki to marry him in the summer of 2013 only for it to be revealed that Kiki is the biological daughter of Dr. Silas Clay (Michael Easton). To divert his new bride's attention, Morgan resorts to buying Kiki expensive gifts. The marriage quickly implodes when Kiki learns that Morgan knew about her paternity before they married and she files for an annulment.

500|$|The episode {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} television sources and critics. Ahsan Haque of IGN gave the episode 7.5/10 and said: [...] "While it featured more than [...] {{a couple of}} genuinely unfunny ideas, this episode succeeds for the most part. [...] While this episode definitely won't make anyone's top ten list of great Family Guy, there was a much better balance between random humor and storytelling in this outing". Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A-, and said that Family Guy [...] "started things out <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>foot</b> with an oh-so-relevant Jackass storyline.

This {{resulted}} in [...] "professional jealousy" [...] forming with Penny, and in retaliation to their disagreements, he put {{her career in}} jeopardy by revealing her affair. Registrar Greg Douglas was appointed as Oliver's mentor. The fast-paced storyline saw Greg initially [...] "kick against his newfound responsibility", before realising that Oliver could be beneficial to his own career, which resulted in an [...] "unlikely friendship" [...] forming between them. Though a [...] "fairly light, buddy-buddy" [...] storyline to begin with, Anderson felt that filming their scenes was [...] "intensive". Speaking of their friendship, Anderson explained: [...] "We start off <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>foot</b> {{with each other and}} we're competitive, which is unhelpful to the patients and (initially) we're not out to help one another at all. But they have similarities... in terms of dropping people in it." [...] The pace of the storyline had to be changed when Anderson injured his knee upon falling down a ten foot cellar. The pair clashed over conflicting medical opinions on patient care, and their friendship soon created a negative effect over Oliver's work ethic. Greg's jokes at his expense left Oliver unable to carry out simple procedures correctly.|$|E
500|$|Taft {{began the}} {{campaign}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>foot,</b> fueling {{the arguments of}} those {{who said he was}} not his own man by traveling to Roosevelt's home at Sagamore Hill for advice on his acceptance speech, saying that he needed [...] "the President's judgment and criticism". Taft supported most of Roosevelt's policies. He argued that labor had a right to organize, but not boycott, and that corporations and the wealthy must also obey the law. Bryan wanted the railroads to be owned by the government, but Taft preferred that they remain in the private sector, with their maximum rates set by the Interstate Commerce Commission, subject to judicial review. Taft attributed blame for the recent recession, the Panic of 1907, to stock speculation and other abuses, and felt some reform of the currency (the U.S. was on the gold standard) was needed to allow flexibility in the government's response to poor economic times, that specific legislation on trusts was needed to supplement the Sherman Antitrust Act, and that the constitution should be amended to allow for an income tax, thus overruling decisions of the Supreme Court striking such a tax down. Roosevelt's expansive use of executive power had been controversial; Taft proposed to continue his policies, but place them on more solid legal underpinnings through the passage of legislation.|$|E

500|$|Swan's {{time on the}} South Coast was miserable: {{family dog}} Zee died; wife Bex had a {{difficult}} birth with baby George; and Swan became a hate figure with his teammates and the local population at large after the club suffered a poor start to the season. Swan's problems then took a supernatural bent as the young couple became convinced that their Plymouth home was haunted – the family moved 260 miles back to the more friendly surroundings of Stoke. He got off <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>foot</b> with the Argyle fans after the local media pointed out that his goal saving tackle at Vale Park on 19 February 1994 had cost Plymouth promotion (Vale had finished three points ahead of Plymouth, who lost out to Burnley in the playoffs); Shilton also did little to help Swan's cause by appointing him as captain {{at the expense of}} fan's favourite Steve Castle. His new teammates also resented the record-signing Northerner for intruding on their clique. Rudge offered Shilton £150,000 to bring Swan back to Vale Park, but was refused; the local press asked Swan [...] "If you're so desperate to leave, why did you come to Plymouth in the first place?"; his answer of [...] "For the money" [...] only served to further incense supporters. Meanwhile, he had off-the-field scuffles with teammates Alan Nicholls and Kevin Nugent. Despite this, Swan's form on the pitch did improve {{towards the end of the}} season. Shilton was replaced by Steve McCall, who was in turn replaced by caretaker-manager Russell Osman, though neither men were able to steer the club away from relegation at the end of 1994–95 – to Swan's delight.|$|E

Typically, most moves consist of a number of steps that are a multiples of two or four, due to most marching band music being in even-numbered time signatures.

50|$|In addition, another {{variation}} of the lay-up is the wrong-foot layup. Typically, this move {{can be seen by}} inexperienced players with poor footwork, however, when done intentionally, a wrong-footed layup can deceive a defender into mistiming his block attempt. In a normal layup, the left foot is used to step off when laying in with the right hand, and vice versa. However, in a wrong-footed layup, the right foot is used to step off when laying in with the right hand. This also helps to shield the defender from reaching across to block the shot; in reaching across however, the defender will likely get called for a defensive foul. Tony Parker of the San Antonio Spurs relies heavily <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>footed</b> layup, largely due to his smaller size and deceptive quickness.|$|R

The standard pattern is that the deity disappears {{as a result of}} their anger and they have to be molified in order to bring them back.

40|$|A {{hard look}} in the mirror, as they say, is good for fitness and vitality. The time seems ripe, then, fifty years {{after the birth of}} modern {{linguistics}}, to re-examine its foundations. Or rather, the rubble, as the editors of Probabilistic linguistics suggest: corpus statistics, Markov chains, information theory, and the very notion of probability that were supposedly buried by the Chomskyan landslide. One of the foundations of modern linguistics is the maxim of categoricity: language is categorical. Numbers play no role, or, where they do, they are artifacts of nonlinguistic performance factors. (1) This sets <b>the</b> volume <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>footing,</b> and <b>on</b> too narrow a ground. After all, linguistics in the past half-century has had the good fortune of witnessing not one revolution, but two. The very essence of William Labov’s groundbreaking work is that the individual’s knowledge of language is inherently variable, and this is a field where probability and statistics reign supreme. But linguistic probability isn’t inherently incompatible with linguistic categoricity. Variationist analysis, as Sankoff (1988 : 986) explains, concerns the DISTRIBUTION of DISCRETE linguistic choices: Whenever a choice among two (or more) discrete alternatives can be perceived as having been made in the course of linguistic performance, and where this choice may have been influenced by factors such as features in the phonological environment, the syntactic context, discursive function of the utterance, topic, style, interactional situation or personal [1] I thank Bob Berwick, Abby Cohn, Julie Legate, my colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania, and two anonymous JL referees for helpful comments and suggestions.
