Rose removed the three bullets that had entered Tippit's chest and head, noting that there was massive hemorrhaging as a result of penetration of the lung and liver, as well as a large amount of damage to his brain.|$|E
25|$|On 23 January 1941, at {{of meeting}} of 3,000 rate-payers on Shanghai Racecourse, Keswick was shot twice by Y. Hayashi, {{chairman}} of the Japanese Street Union Association. The shooting occurred after the meeting rejected an amendment proposed by Hayashi, which opposed the imposition of higher taxes and instead recommended acceptance of a loan from an unnamed Japanese bank. Keswick's wounds, one {{to the left side}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> and the other to his left forearm, were not considered serious, with doctors commenting that his heavy coat had probably saved his life. Hayashi was subsequently arrested.|$|E
25|$|The {{condition}} {{of their bodies}} when returned by the British authorities to their families supports this assertion. There were extensive signs of discolouring, which seemed to indicate extensive bruising. The army doctor claimed that large staining could occur, and this {{would depend on the}} way the bodies had been lying. He also said that Clancy had been hit with up to five bullets, which made eight wounds; Dick McKee had three wounds caused by two bullets. He said McKee had no bayonet wounds, but there was a bullet lodged underneath his skin on the right <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest.</b> Clune, he said, had nine wounds caused by seven bullets. T. Ryle Dwyer also states that David Neligan was adamant that they had not been bayoneted.|$|E

25|$|When the Rangers {{arrived at}} the cabin site they found the Ament and the other men safely barricaded inside the cabin. Ament waved a white flag through the roof to signal the {{soldiers}} as they approached. Outside, they found the undisturbed body of Phillips lying where he had fallen, in the dooryard with his face upturned. He had been shot through the left side <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> and through the stomach. His body was badly tomahawked, and had slashes across one eye and his neck. He had not, however, been scalped. The Rangers formed a small detachment and set off {{in pursuit of the}} attackers but they soon gave up and returned to Hennepin with Phillips' remains. The funeral took place the next day and was attended by citizens and soldiers alike.|$|E
25|$|Moyne {{arrived in}} his car with his driver, Lance Corporal Arthur Fuller, his secretary, Dorothy Osmond, and his ADC, Major Andrew Hughes-Onslow. The ADC went to {{open the front door}} of the {{residence}} and the driver got out to open the door for Moyne. They were suddenly told not to move, as Bet-Zuri emerged and shot Fuller in the chest, causing him to collapse in the driveway and bleed to death in minutes. Hakim then pulled the car door open and shot Moyne three times. The first bullet hit him in the neck on the right side, just above the clavicle, the second penetrated his abdomen, punctured his colon and large intestine, and became embedded to the right of the second lumbar vertebrae, while the third shot, fired after Moyne raised his right hand, ripped across four of his fingers and went in and out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest,</b> causing no serious injuries.|$|E

25|$|Lindros' {{relationship}} with Flyers General Manager Bobby Clarke soon deteriorated. He and Clarke feuded in the media, with Clarke questioning his toughness; Lindros spent many {{games on the}} injured reserve and suffered a series of concussions, the first in 1998 from a hit delivered by Pittsburgh's Darius Kasparaitis that sidelined him for 18 games. Lindros would suffer a second concussion in January 1999 that sidelined him for two games. During an April 1, 1999, game against the Nashville Predators, Lindros suffered what was diagnosed as a rib injury. Later that night, the teammate he was sharing a hotel room with, Keith Jones, discovered Lindros lying in a tub, pale and cold. In {{a call to the}} Flyers, the trainer was told to put Lindros on a plane that was returning to Philadelphia with injured teammate Mark Recchi. But Jones insisted that Lindros be taken to a nearby hospital and it was discovered Lindros had a collapsed lung caused by internal bleeding <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> wall. Lindros' father wrote the Flyers a letter in which he stated that if the trainer had followed team orders, Eric would be dead, a statement supported by the doctors who treated him in Nashville.|$|E
500|$|Three of {{the four}} bullets that struck Lennon's back passed {{completely}} through his body and out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest,</b> one of which hit and became lodged in his upper left arm, while the fourth lodged itself in his aorta beside his heart; {{nearly all of them}} would have been fatal by themselves as each bullet hit vital arteries around the heart. As Lennon had been shot four times at close range with hollow-point bullets, Lennon's affected organs (particularly his left lung) and major blood vessels above his heart were virtually destroyed upon impact. Lynn later stated to reporters on the extent of Lennon's injuries: [...] "If he [...] had been shot this way {{in the middle of the}} operating room with a whole team of surgeons ready to work on him... he still wouldn't have survived his injuries".|$|E
500|$|After {{capturing}} the knoll, the two platoons—reinforced by two {{sections of the}} 2/4th Commando Squadron—dug in to await an expected Japanese counter-attack. At about 03:30 on 23 May, a Japanese light machine gun fired into the Australian position. [...] Derrick sat upright to see if his men were all right, and was hit by five bullets from the gun's second burst; striking him from his left hip to the right <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest.</b> His runner, [...] "Curly" [...] Colby, dragged him behind cover, but Derrick could not be immediately evacuated as Japanese troops attacked at about 04:00. Derrick was in great pain, and told Colby that he had [...] "had it". Despite his wounds, he continued to issue orders for several hours. When day broke, {{it was discovered that}} Derrick's platoon were directly overlooked by a Japanese bunker—though this would not have been visible during the assault late the previous evening.|$|E

During the feast, she tells him that she needs to know he has a heart. The warlock shows her his beating hairy heart inside a crystal casket in his dungeon. The witch begs him to put it back inside himself. After the warlock does so, she embraces him. However, being {{disconnected}} from its body for so long, his heart has developed savage tastes as it has degenerated into an animalistic state. And so he is driven to take by force a truly human heart. He tears out the witch's heart to replace his own, but finding that he cannot magic the hairy heart back out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest,</b> he cuts it out with a dagger. Thus he and the maiden both die, with him holding both hearts in his hands.|$|E

David leads Oram to a room filled with Alien eggs, where Oram is attacked and impregnated by a Facehugger by forcing its ovipositor down his throat. David watches as Oram awakens a short time later and dies as the first Alien Xenomorph bursts out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest.</b> Having discovered the dissected and mutilated corpse of Shaw, Walter confronts David, stating that he knows that David killed her, along with the Engineers. Walter rejects David's offer to join him, prompting David to impale him through the neck with his flute, apparently terminating him.|$|E
500|$|Endubis, {{the first}} known Aksumite king to mint coins, focused almost entirely on his image on both the obverse and reverse. The images were {{of his head and}} upper half <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> in profile, wearing a regnal {{headcloth}} or helmet and abundant jewelry. [...] In addition to inscribing his regnal name, Endybis also noted his [...] "bisi name, a practice continued by his early successors, but often missing in later coins. The bisi name was a sort of tribal affiliation or [...] "ethnikon" [...] (i.e. a reference to the king's lineage) that was different for every king. Endybis also emphasized his religion through the pre-Christian symbol of the disk and crescent as a propaganda method (a purpose which the coins already served). A second motif used by Enybis and continued by following coins was that of two (though sometimes one in later years) ears of barley or wheat around the image of his head in profile. Though no inscriptional evidence exists, given its prominent position around the image of the king, the two ears of barley (or wheat) may have been representative symbols of the Aksumite state. Though later coins would be smaller, Endybis chose the Roman aureus to standardize Aksumite coin weights against, with gold issues at half-aureus around 2.70grams (more precisely, the theoretical weight may have been 2.725g).|$|E

500|$|His Staffel, {{which had}} been flying a tight {{formation}} around him, peeled away {{to give him the}} necessary room to manoeuvre. Marseille rolled his aircraft onto its back, the standard procedure for bail out, but due to the smoke and slight disorientation, he failed to notice that the aircraft had entered a steep dive at an angle of 70–80 degrees and was now travelling at a considerably faster speed (about [...] ).

500|$|The {{episode was}} {{positively}} received. Writing for Variety, Brian Lowry called the second season's opening [...] "a bloody winner" [...] {{and said that}} Hall's performance [...] "remains a towering achievement". IGN's Eric Goldman thought that the episode's biggest problem was [...] "having to follow up such a great first season", but called [...] "It's Alive!" [...] "a solid episode". He praised Dexter's flashbacks and Dexter and Debra's storylines, though he said that Doakes' following Dexter was [...] "ridiculous" [...] and that LaGuerta's overhearing Lt. Esmee Pascal's private conversation was [...] "a bit contrived". Keith McDuffee of TV Squad [...] "love the flashbacks to a young Dexter and living Harry". Regarding the episode's end, he wrote that [...] "just as Dexter's heart beats out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest,</b> as does ours." [...] Paula Paige, writing for TV Guide, said that the episode [...] "made for some exciting, heart-pounding fear" [...] and called the discovery of Dexter's corpses [...] "a fantastic storyline". She commended Benz for [...] "develop her character, Rita, into a person instead of just the shell of one she appeared to be". Blogcritics Ray Ellis commented, [...] "If [...] is any indication, Dexters second season looks to delve deeper into the psyches of its characters. It certainly sets up a number of plot complexities [...] and new devices that offer a myriad of new developments." [...] The A.V.

500|$|The children's book The World's Angriest Boy in the World, {{which appears}} in Haller's {{memories}} of his childhood, was written by Hawley and published {{for use in the}} show. Stevens described it as [...] "the world's most twisted children's book", but useful for him to hold and read while acting. The physical manifestation of the book's title character was inspired by Edward Gorey drawings, with Wylie explaining that he [...] "loved the idea of him wearing a little velvet, Eddie Munster child’s funeral suit. That’s where that dude came from. He’s really scary." [...] Another manifestation of the Shadow King, the Devil with the Yellow Eyes, was inspired by the reality television series My 600-lb Life, with Wylie explaining, [...] "They do this amazing thing at the beginning of every episode of that show where they show the person struggling {{to get out of bed}} or walk down a hallway ... They light it badly just to make the person’s journey seem that much more difficult." [...] Boisclair was cast in the role due to his [...] height and slender frame, with prosthetics used to give him a [...] "gigantic body with no neck [...] really skinny arms and legs". Boisclair was called a [...] "rare and lucky find", akin to Bolaji Badejo, who portrayed the alien in the 1979 film Alien. Boisclair's prosthetics were designed by Sarah Pickersgill, under special effects makeup head Todd Masters, and took four-and-a-half hours to apply. Masters' team were also responsible for creating the body parts that are found sticking out of walls in the pilot, including Lenny's upper body and arm, produced from a silicone copy of Plaza; extensive bruising for Cary and Kerry Loudermilk after a major fight sequence, which was achieved with Pros-Aide transfers that were reduced each day to show the wounds healing; and the burn makeup for Linklater after he is injured in the pilot, which was designed to cover half his face and most <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> and back, with just the face and neck requiring five separate prosthetics. Marcine Peter at Contour Contact Lens provided hand-painted contact lenses for the production, including for Boisclair to wear as the Devil with the Yellow Eyes.|$|E
