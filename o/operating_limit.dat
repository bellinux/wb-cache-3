40|$|During an {{investigation}} of the J 57 -P- 1 turbojet engine in the Lewis altitude wind tunnel, effects of inlet-flow distortion on engine stall characteristics and <b>operating</b> <b>limits</b> were determined. In addition to a uniform inlet-flow profile, the inlet-pressure distortions imposed included two radial, two circumferential, and one combined radial-circumferential profile. Data were obtained over a range of compressor speeds at an altitude of 50, 000 and a flight Mach number of 0. 8; in addition, the high- and low-speed engine <b>operating</b> <b>limits</b> were investigated up to the maximum operable altitude. The effect of changing the compressor bleed position on the stall and <b>operating</b> <b>limits</b> was determined for one of the inlet distortions. The circumferential distortions lowered the compressor stall pressure ratios; this resulted in less fuel-flow margin between steady-state operation and compressor stall. Consequently, the altitude <b>operating</b> <b>Limits</b> with circumferential distortions were reduced compared with the uniform inlet profile. Radial inlet-pressure distortions increased the pressure ratio required for compressor stall over that obtained with uniform inlet flow; this resulted in higher altitude <b>operating</b> <b>limits.</b> Likewise, the stall-limit fuel flows required with the radial inlet-pressure distortions were considerably higher than those obtained with the uniform inlet-pressure profile. A combined radial-circumferential inlet distortion had effects on the engine similar to the circumferential distortion. Bleeding air between the two compressors eliminated the low-speed stall limit and thus permitted higher altitude operation than was possible without compressor bleed...|$|R

50|$|Internal {{combustion}} engines are heat engines, {{and as such}} their theoretical efficiency can be approximated by idealized thermodynamic cycles. The thermal efficiency of a theoretical cycle cannot exceed that of the Carnot cycle, whose efficiency {{is determined by the}} difference between the lower and upper operating temperatures of the engine. The upper operating temperature of an engine is limited by two main factors; the thermal operating limits of the materials, and the auto-ignition resistance of the fuel. All metals and alloys have a thermal <b>operating</b> <b>limit,</b> and there is significant research into ceramic materials that can be made with greater thermal stability and desirable structural properties. Higher thermal stability allows for a greater temperature difference between the lower (ambient) and upper operating temperatures, hence greater thermodynamic efficiency. Also, as the cylinder temperature rises, the engine becomes more prone to auto-ignition. This is caused when the cylinder temperature nears the flash point of the charge. At this point, ignition can spontaneously occur before the spark plug fires, causing excessive cylinder pressures. Auto-ignition can be mitigated by using fuels with high auto-ignition resistance (octane rating), however it still puts an upper bound on the allowable peak cylinder temperature.|$|E

Alternative refrigerants with low-GWP are under investigation for residential heat pumps and air-conditioners as R- 410 A has a GWP of 2088. In this study, two promising alternative refrigerants with a low-GWP, DR- 5 A (R- 454 B) and L 41 - 2 (R- 447 A), both HFC-HFO mixtures with a GWP of 466 and 583 respectively, have been tested in a residential heat pump. Â To assess and to compare the heat pump performances using R- 410 A, DR- 5 A and L 41 - 2, drop-in tests {{have been carried out}} in a 10 kW air-to-water reversible heat pump. For each refrigerant, the heat pump performances have been assessed for 2 rating conditions and 2 <b>operating</b> <b>limit</b> conditions in the cooling mode and for 6 rating conditions and 3 <b>operating</b> <b>limit</b> conditions in the heating mode. The tests have been performed according to the ENÂ 14511 standard. This experimental investigation has been carried out in three phases. In the first one, the performances of the heat pump using R- 410 A have been evaluated. Then, in phases 2 and 3, both alternative refrigerants, DR- 5 A and L 41 - 2, have been tested. For each, a refrigerant charge optimization has been done, then the rating and <b>operating</b> <b>limit</b> condition tests have been performed, and finally, a performance verification using R- 410 A has been carried out to detect any anomaly after the use of {{one or the other of}} these alternative refrigerants. During all the tests, measurements have allowed to determine the thermal capacities, the electric energy consumptions, the efficiencies (EER or COP), as well as the refrigerant circuit pressures and discharge temperatures. Â A total of 39 tests have been performed. The refrigerant charge optimization drives to decrease the charge in the heat pump by 15 % for DR- 5 A and by 21 % for L 41 - 2 in comparison with R- 410 A. The results show that R- 410 A replacement by L 41 - 2 and DR- 5 A do not raise any particular problem even in <b>operating</b> <b>limit</b> condition tests and the performances obtained are, aside from some exceptions, almost equivalent (+/- 10 %) to those of R- 410 A.

40|$|The <b>operating</b> <b>limits</b> of a {{transistor}} are conventionally {{determined by}} {{characterization of the}} curves that form the boundary of the safe operating area (SOA) in the twodimensional drain current-voltage (Id, Vds) plane [1, 2]. The shape of these SOA curves depends on parameters such as pulse time tpulse, ambient temperature Tamb and area of the transistor A [3, 4]. Consequently, this way of characterizing the safe <b>operating</b> <b>limits</b> does not result in a single safe operating range for the transistor, but in many different curves that depend on operating conditions and transistor geometry. Besides the drain-source voltage Vds and the gate-width Wgate normalized drain current Idn (Idn = Id/Wgate), the junction temperature Tj also plays {{an essential role in}} determining the safe <b>operating</b> <b>limits</b> of a transistor with a certain cross-section. Therefore, it is proposed to extend the SOA concept by adding a temperature Tj-axis. In this way, the safe operating range can be represented by a volume in the three dimensional (Idn, Vds, Tj) space, which we define as the safe operating volume (SOV). In this work, extensive measurements of the safe <b>operating</b> <b>limits</b> of SOI LDMOS transistors are presented. Integrated temperature sensors are used to measure the junction temperature of the devices up {{to the edge of the}} operating range. By comparing measured SOV data for varying tpulse, Tamb and A for devices of identical cross-section (Figs. 2 - 5) it is demonstrated that the SOV is nearly independent of operating conditions and device area. This establishes the SOV as a general measure for the safe <b>operating</b> <b>limits</b> of transistors. The usefulness of the SOV concept is demonstrated by showing how conventional two-dimensional SOA curves for different operating conditions and device areas can be predicted once the SOV and the effective thermal impedance Zth,eff of the LDMOS transistor have been determined (Table I and Figs. 6 - 7) ...|$|R
