The nucleation of the cluster is controlled through coordination of 6 -dimethylaminopurine via. -N(CH 3) 2 group. Excess 6 -dimethylaminopurine binds to the core structure through H-bonding involving protonated N(9). CdS capped with 6 -dimethylaminopurine produced relatively small sized particles (2 nm) having a narrow size distribution. These particles did not exhibit any <b>Ostwald's</b> <b>ripening</b> and its solid sample could be fully redispersed in aqueous medium. Thermolysis results in the growth of these particles but demonstrates a better photocatalytic activity. Relaxation kinetics reveals the surface to contain a large number of surface states and the emission is originated by the presence of sulfur vacancies on the particle. The addition of indole simply quenches the emission of CdS in a bimolecular collisional process at a diffusion-controlled rate of about 9 × 109 dm 3 mol− 1 s− 1.

40|$|Recent {{evidence}} indicates that ferrous carbonate (FeCO 3, siderite) plays {{a critical role in}} forming corrosion resistant scale. Although FeCO 3 also limits the solubility of iron in some anaerobic systems, its precipitation kinetics have received little attention. The temperature dependent precipitation kinetics of ferrous carbonate were studied using a powerful new "temperature ramped" approach. Activation energies calculated using three second order and two first order precipitation models (53. 8 - 123 kJ/mol) all qualitatively indicate that precipitation is controlled by surface reaction rate. Precipitation is extremely slow at ambient temperatures, but becomes limited by diffusion above approximately 110 C. Surface reaction rate equations must, therefore, be used to model low temperature precipitation, and mass transfer equations should be used to estimate high temperature FeCO 3 growth. Seed crystals were prepared and <b>Ostwald</b> <b>ripened</b> in a reactor under anoxic conditions. Precipitation was induced by linearly increasing (ramping) the temperature and recording the change in iron concentration with respect to time and temperature. Rather than performing a series of isothermal experiments, temperature dependent kinetics were determined by fitting nonlinear models to temperature ramped experiments. The techniques developed in this research could easily be adapted for use with a number of other reduced metal systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{degree of}} {{supercooling}} (1 T 0) dependence of lamellar thickening growth rate (U) of an isolated extended chain single crystal (ECSC) of polyethylene is studied. The experimental formula, U DC exp(¡D= 1 T 0), where C D 130 nm/s and D D 20 : 0 K is {{obtained for the}} first time. The formula {{is the same as}} that of lateral growth rate (V). The reason why U and V obey the same formula is well explained by a model named 2 ̆ 2 sliding diffusion model of the lamellar thickening growth 2 ̆ 2. The model proposed that the lamellar thickening growth is controlled by both chain sliding diffusion within the ECSC and the nucleation on the side surface. The observed fact that the U increases with increase of 1 T 0 is opposite to the well known fact that lamellar thickening rateW decreases with increase of 1 T 0. This siginificant difference was well explained by the difference between the 2 ̆ 2 primary crystallization 2 ̆ 2 and the 2 ̆ 2 secondary crystallization 2 ̆ 2, which is a kind of 2 ̆ 2 <b>Ostwald’s</b> <b>ripening</b> process 2 ̆ 2.

40|$|International audienceThe thermal {{stability}} of catalytic precursors is of major {{importance for the}} synthesis of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) with narrow diameter distributions by chemical vapor deposition at high temperature. We report {{a study of the}} {{thermal stability}} of iron (Fe) and iron oxide (Fe 2 O 3) nanoparticles with narrow size distribution grown onto Si/SiO 2 hydroxylated flat substrates. Whereas the Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles are thermally stable up to 900 °C, above their reducing temperature of ∼ 700 °C, the size distribution of Fe nanoparticles increases and broadens. An accurate analysis of atomic force microscopy data shows that this instability is due to a diffusion−coalescence mechanism, ruling out a possible <b>Ostwald's</b> <b>ripening</b> mechanism. The origin of this behavior is attributed to the dewetting of the nanoparticles. Using the thermally stable oxide nanoparticles as catalytic precursors, SWNTs can be successfully grown using a methane−hydrogen mixed gas. Statistical analysis of the SWNTs Raman radial breathing modesmeasured using four excitation wavelengths indicates that the diameter distribution of the nanotubes is centered at 1. 3 ± 0. 03 nm with a narrow full width at half-maximum of 0. 3 ± 0. 05 nm. The analysis of our results compared with other results recently published suggests that the metal−surface interaction could {{play a key role in}} the catalytic decomposition of methane and in the growth of SWNTs...|$|R

40|$|Copper oxide {{nanoparticles}} nanofluids (CuO-NPs-NF) {{are promising}} candidates for pool boiling {{critical heat flux}} (CHF) applications due to their multifaceted advantages like easy tunability, eco-friendliness, cost-effectiveness, easy chemical modification and higher thermal conductivities. In addition, entrapping the CuO-NPs in/on to graphene oxide (GO) improves the CHF values compared to CuO-NPs alone. This paper reports a high performance hybrid NFs based on CuO and GO nanocomposites (CuO:GO-NCs-NFs), exhibiting higher pool boiling CHF values even at very low concentrations. The proposed novel NFs have higher thermal conductivities compared with the DI water. The 0. 06 wt% CuO:GO-NCs-NF shows the highest CHF value, ca. 160 %, which {{is much higher than}} that of pure CuO-NPs-NF (99 %). Atomic force microscope (AFM) and field-emission SEM (FE-SEM) micrographs of the wire after the pool boiling experiments revealed a rough surface having high wettability and lower contact angle (CA) with 47 ° due to the formation of a layer-on-layer network on the wire surface.

30|$|Based on the {{time-dependent}} study, {{a growth}} mechanism can be proposed for these nanostructures. In the initial stage, the reacting solution consists of Cl- ions and Ti precursors. Cl- ions diffuse out leading to nucleation of Ti precursor {{on the surface}} of nanofibers. These precursors tend to settle on the nanofibers surface and act as nuclei for further growth. It is through <b>Ostwald’s</b> <b>ripening</b> process that the initially formed aggregates gradually scavenge, accompanied by the growth of rod-like nanostructures. It is reported that the ratio of Cl- ions to Ti in the solution is important[19, 20]. The high acidity and low concentration of Cl- ions favor the growth of rutile-phase rod-like nanostructures. The precursor containing HCl as the acid medium has a tendency to form rod-shaped rutile TiO 2 nanostructures. It appears that the anatase nucleates and grows first according to Ostwald’s law, and rutile nuclei appear eventually when the successive reaction is taking place since rutile is thermodynamically the most stable phase[20]. Thereafter, the rutile quickly grows epitaxially at the expense of mother anatase crystallites via a dissolution and precipitation process[21]. Both rutile and anatase belong to the tetragonal crystal system, consisting of TiO 6 octahedra as a fundamental structural unit. Their crystalline structures differ in the assembly of the octahedral chains[22, 23]. Rutile has 42 screw-axes along the crystallographic c-axis. The screw structure promotes crystal growth along this direction, resulting in a crystal morphology dominated by the { 110 } faces[24]. Therefore, rutile nanoparticles are usually rod-like.|$|R
30|$|Moreover, {{to attain}} maximum {{utilization}} efficiency and minimum platinum usage, the ultrafine Pt–M (M=Co, Ni, Cr, Pd, and Rh) alloys having {{large surface area}} with maximum active sites are proposed. However, the agglomeration and <b>Ostwald’s</b> <b>ripening</b> of nano-particles may lead to deterioration in stability and activity of these alloys [7]. Recently, various engineered allotropes of carbon such as carbon black, carbon nanotubes, graphene, and graphene oxide (GO) have been investigated as a support matrix owing to their high surface area and a better electron conductivity [8]. The oxidized form of graphene, i.e., reduced graphene oxide (rGO) acts as a conductive material to modulate the electrochemical reaction in a controlled fashion. The presence of functional groups such as –OH and –COOH on rGO nanosheets provide sites for metal anchoring and their 2 D structure allow higher loading of nanosize catalysts with almost no agglomeration contributing to higher current efficiency during MOR [9, 10, 11]. Furthermore, the hydrophilic nature of rGO promotes water activation at lower potential and induce the oxidation of adsorbed CO on active Pt sites of pure Pt or Pt–M nano-catalysts, by the bi-functional mechanism [12, 13, 14]. Among numerous reported bimetallic Pt-based catalysts, PtCo is considered a better catalyst as the incorporation of Co into the lattice of platinum introduce enhanced Pt d-band vacancies which modify the adsorption energy of the carbonaceous species on Pt surface and produce oxidized species at a lower potential [15, 16]. The modified electronic structure of PtCo alloys affects Pt–Pt bond distance resulting in easier adsorption of oxygen moieties on to alloy nano-particles and reduced CO poisoning [17]. Recently, we have reported the synthesis of PtCo nano-particles with varying Pt and Co molar ratio onto rGO support using co-impregnation reduction method, where PtCo (1 : 9)/rGO catalyst showed the highest catalytic activity and long-term stability towards MOR [18].|$|R

40|$|Colloidal dispersions such as oil-in-water or water-in-oil {{emulsions}} {{have found}} widespread {{use in the}} food industry. Oil-in-water emulsions consist of three principal components i. e. oil dispersed {{in the form of}} droplets, water surrounding the droplets as the continuous phase, and emulsifiers comprising the interface. Because of the complicated interaction among components, {{it is often difficult to}} predict the physicochemical properties and final functionalities of emulsions. Nevertheless, the structural and functional features of emulsions allow scientists to create many unique emulsions that may serve as suitable carriers for lipophilic functional compounds. These functional compounds may include antioxidants, flavors, colors and antimicrobials, the latter which is the principal topic of this thesis. Incorporation of food antimicrobials in emulsions could create value-added emulsions that may improve the safety and quality of a variety of foods, but to date, few systematic studies on their formulation have been reported. The objective of this thesis was therefore to formulate food emulsions that are physicochemically stable and able to deliver antimicrobial compounds to microbial target sites. Two antimicrobial agents, N-α-lauroyl-L-arginine ethyl ester monohydrochloride, (LAE) and eugenol were used as model compound to be incorporated into the colloidal food dispersion. The two antimicrobials were selected because they are either amphiphilic (LAE) or predominantly lipophilic (eugenol). When emulsions were formulated with eugenol, an essential oil component, it was found that O/W emulsions were only stable when emulsions were formulated with other lipids (hexadecane, dodecane, tetradecane, and corn oil). Above a critical loading of the carrier lipid with eugenol, <b>Ostwald’s</b> <b>ripening</b> led to rapid destabilization while above this critical loading concentration, the ripening rate was greatly reduced and depended on type of carrier lipid and concentration of eugenol. Alternatively, when emulsions were formulated with LAE as emulsifier, results indicated that emulsions were not stable to aggregation and coalescence. Consequently, LAE had to be combined with a nonionic surfactant (Tween 20) to improve the emulsion stability. Higher Tween 20 composition led to more stable emulsions droplets. Both systems (emulsions with either eugenol or LAE) had high antimicrobial efficacies and were able to completely inhibit microbial growth at concentrations that depended on the type of microorganisms and formulation of the emulsions. Generally, eugenol were able to more effectively inhibit the growth of E. coli O 157 :H 7 while LAE containing emulsions were more effective against L. monocytogenes. Finally, a food emulsion was formulated that contained both antimicrobial agents; eugenol in the lipid phase and LAE in the droplet interface. Interestingly, stability of these emulsions depended both on the LAE and eugenol loading. The antimicrobial activity in this double antimicrobial emulsion was high but was principally influenced by the interfacial formulation that is the ratio of LAE to Tween 20. The combined emulsion similar to the LAE stabilized emulsion more effectively inhibited growth of L. monocytogenes...|$|R
