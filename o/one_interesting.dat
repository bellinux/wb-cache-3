25|$|Sankt Hans Church in Hjørring, {{northern}} Jutland, has <b>one</b> <b>interesting</b> wall {{painting from}} about 1350 of St Christopher carrying the baby Jesus.|$|E
25|$|<b>One</b> <b>interesting</b> {{property}} of the standard uniform distribution is that if u1 has a standard uniform distribution, then so does 1-u1. This property {{can be used for}} generating antithetic variates, among other things.|$|E
25|$|<b>One</b> <b>interesting</b> {{and useful}} {{feature of the}} Occitan {{language}} is its virtually infinite ability to create new words {{through a number of}} interchangeable and embeddable suffixes, giving the original terms a whole array of semantic nuances.|$|E

25|$|The {{versatility}} of fullerene molecules {{has led to}} a {{large amount}} of research exploring their properties. <b>One</b> <b>interesting</b> property is the relatively large volume of the internal space of the molecule. Atoms of different elements may be placed inside the molecular cage formed by the carbon atoms.|$|E
25|$|<b>One</b> <b>interesting</b> {{use of the}} Sparrowhawks was to act as 'flying ballast'. The airship {{could take}} off with {{additional}} ballast or fuel aboard instead of its airplanes. Once the airship was cruising, the aircraft would be flown aboard, the additional weight being supported by dynamic lift until the airship lightened.|$|E
5000|$|Hamam {{tradition}} in Baku is <b>one</b> of <b>interesting</b> <b>one.</b> There {{are a number}} of ancient hamams in Baku belonging to 12th, 14th and 18th centuries. Hamams also plays a very important role in the architectural appearance of Baku.|$|R

25|$|<b>One</b> <b>interesting</b> {{and widely}} {{researched}} topic is {{the relation between}} cosmovision, religion, geography, and architecture in Mesoamerica. Much {{seems to suggest that}} many traits of Mesoamerican architecture were governed by religious and mythological ideas. For example, the layout of most Mesoamerican cities seem to be influenced by the cardinal directions and their mythological and symbolic meanings in Mesoamerican culture.|$|E
25|$|Production of {{agricultural}} machinery and implements had occurred since the 1930s, {{such as the}} 1933 number 22e Fordson farm tractor, and such offerings were maintained post-war. <b>One</b> <b>interesting</b> model was the odd Opperman 3-wheeled Motocart, a tilting flat-bed vehicle with engine hanging {{off to the side}} of its large front wheel (Rixon 2005, pp.122–123).|$|E
25|$|The {{state was}} formed with 18 districts that were {{formerly}} part of south Bihar. Some of these districts were reorganised to form 6 new districts, namely, Latehar, Saraikela Kharsawan, Jamtara, Sahebganj, Khunti and Ramgarh. At present, {{the state has}} 5 Divisions and 24 Districts. <b>One</b> <b>interesting</b> thing about Jharkhand is that all its districts, except Lohardaga and Khunti, share a border with a neighboring state.|$|E
50|$|The idea of {{the program}} came from an eight-year-old little boy who used to stay up to watch The Probe Team, a multi-award-winning investigative {{television}} program. Zak Yuson, a nephew of The Probe Teams executive producer and head investigative journalist, Cheche Lazaro, {{came up with the}} idea of having kids as the show's reporters for one episode. Topics that would be featured would be <b>ones</b> <b>interesting</b> to children.|$|R
40|$|In {{the logical}} theory {{of a set}} of axioms there are many boring logical consequences, and {{scattered}} among them there are a few <b>interesting</b> <b>ones.</b> The few <b>interesting</b> <b>ones</b> include those that are singled out as theorems by experts in the domain. This paper describes the techniques, implementation, and results of an automated system that generates logical consequences {{of a set of}} axioms, and uses filters and ranking to identify interesting theorems among the logical consequences. 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} and compares different risk classification {{models for the}} annual number of claims reported to the insurer. Generalized heterogeneous, zero-inflated, hurdle and compound frequency models are applied {{to a sample of}} an automobile portfolio of a major company operating in Spain. A statistical comparison between models is performed with the help of various specification tests (Score and Hausman tests for nested models, Vuong test or information criteria for non-nested <b>ones).</b> <b>Interesting</b> results about claiming behavior are obtained...|$|R
25|$|<b>One</b> <b>interesting</b> {{aspect of}} the Ackermann {{function}} {{is that the only}} arithmetic operations it ever uses are addition and subtraction of 1. Its properties come solely from the power of unlimited recursion. This also implies that its running time is at least proportional to its output, and so is also extremely huge. In actuality, for most cases the running time is far larger than the output; see below.|$|E
25|$|<b>One</b> <b>interesting</b> {{version of}} the Yugo, the {{automatic}} one, is increasingly rare and estimates say that around 20 are left in use in Serbia, {{and most of those}} were sold in 1992, just after the sanctions were imposed, fetching a large value on auctions. A small number of newer Yugos can be found with automatic transmissions, and they were mostly built by request and featured a 1.3 liter engine.|$|E
25|$|<b>One</b> <b>interesting</b> but {{short-lived}} {{operation was}} {{the development of}} the Swallow Doretti sports car. Only about 275 vehicles were made before complaints were received from T.I. clients in the car manufacturing business. Although it was a superior product to its competition, T.I. felt it might be politic not to aggravate some of the larger clients of its steel and aluminium business. Despite recognising the Doretti's qualities, Stedeford showed his legendary toughness and shut the operation down, transferring the employees {{to other parts of the}} T.I. group.|$|E

25|$|<b>One</b> <b>interesting</b> {{difference}} between a woodwind instrument and a brass instrument is that woodwind instruments are non-directional. This means that the sound produced propagates in all directions with approximately equal volume. Brass instruments, on the other hand, are highly directional, {{with most of the}} sound produced traveling straight outward from the bell. This difference makes it significantly more difficult to record a brass instrument accurately. It also {{plays a major role in}} some performance situations, such as in marching bands.|$|E
25|$|Suzuki was {{the first}} company to offer a kei car in 1955. <b>One</b> <b>interesting</b> {{departure}} from other Kei cars was the Fronte Coupé introduced in September 1971. It was a 2+2 (or a strict 2-seater) Giugiaro-designed mini GT based on the rear-engine Suzuki Fronte, measuring a mere 2,995mm. It used a 359cc two-stroke engine developing 31, 34 or 37hp (35 in later models) depending on equipment level. The Fronte Coupé was discontinued in June, 1976, as it didn't suit the new Kei Jidosha limits, nor the stricter emissions regulations.|$|E
25|$|<b>One</b> <b>interesting</b> and {{enduring}} exhibit was the 1933 Homes of Tomorrow Exhibition that demonstrated modern home convenience and creative practical new building materials and techniques with twelve model homes sponsored by several corporations affiliated with home decor and construction. Marine artist Hilda Goldblatt Gorenstein (Hilgos) painted twelve murals for the Navy's exhibit in the Federal Building for the fair. The frieze {{was composed of}} twelve murals depicting the influence of sea power on America, beginning with the settlement of Jamestown, Virginia in 1607 when sea power first reached America and carrying through World War I.|$|E

25|$|<b>One</b> <b>interesting</b> {{exception}} was a horizontal seven inch turntable. Although made in 1886, {{the machine was}} a duplicate of one made earlier but taken to Europe by Chichester Bell. Tainter was granted Patent No. 385886 for it on July 10, 1888. The playing arm is rigid except for a pivoted vertical motion of 90 degrees to allow removal of the record or a return to starting position. While recording or playing, the record not only rotated but moved laterally under the stylus which thus described a spiral, recording 150 grooves to the inch.|$|E
25|$|The {{lopsided}} {{score of}} the first game gave indications that the series would be quickly over. <b>One</b> <b>interesting</b> emergence was that of Marty Walsh. Walsh would help hold Ottawa to a 5–3 lead scoring two goals. In the game's second half, Ottawa broke away after the score was made 5–4 with nine unanswered goals. Ottawa would win game one by a score of 16–7. The game featured many multiple goal scorers; Westwick, McGee, A. Smith and H Smith would all score four goals for the Senators, and Richardson, Dobbson, and Walsh would each score two for Queen's.|$|E
25|$|Some sources {{attribute}} their {{introduction to}} the ancient Phoenicians who traded along {{the west coast of}} Africa or even early Carthaginian explorers and traders. The Egyptians have also been suggested as they used penannular money. <b>One</b> <b>interesting</b> suggestion is that Nigerian fishermen brought them up in their nets from the shipwrecks of European wrecks or made them from the copper 'pins' used in wooden sailing ships wrecked in the Bight of Benin. One theory is that if indigenous, they copied a splayed-end Raffia cloth bracelet worn by women, another that the well-known Yoruba Mondua with its bulbous ends inspired the manilla shape.|$|E
