Critic Francis Jeffrey (1773–1850) claimed that, in [...] "Strange fits", [...] "Mr Wordsworth, however, has thought fit to compose a piece, illustrating this copious subject by one single thought. A lover trots away to see his mistress <b>one</b> <b>fine</b> evening, staring all the way at the moon: when he comes to her door, 'O mercy! to myself I cried, / If Lucy should be dead!'

[...] On [...] "A slumber did my spirit seal", Wordsworth's friend Thomas Powell wrote that the poem [...] "stands by itself, and is without title prefixed, yet we are to know, from the penetration of Mr. Wordsworth's admirers, that it is a sequel to the other deep poems that precede it, and is about one Lucy, who is dead. From the table of contents, however, we are informed by the author that it is about 'A Slumber;' for this is the actual title which he has condescended to give it, to put us out of pain as to what it is about." ...|$|E
