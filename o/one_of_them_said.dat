25|$|There {{are several}} legends {{to how the}} town of Modoc got its name. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>said</b> that a man {{travelling}} on the train threw out a cigar box containing the name Modoc, and that Henry Conley, {{one of the first}} settlers of the town, picked it up and suggested to bystanders {{that it would be a}} good name for the town. Another theory is that Modoc was named after the Modoc people who were traditionally located in northern California. They became noted for their resistance to the US Army during the Modoc War, ending in 1873.|$|E

Eisenhower had spent three years in Panama as an aide to General Fox Conner, who knew that the terms of the Treaty of Versailles were being ignored by Adolf Hitler and the Nazis, and who was certain another war was coming soon. Eisenhower reasoned that this was no time for an officer with Middleton's combat experience to be getting out of the Army.|$|E

2500|$|A Midrash asked why, in [...] Jacob [...] "offered {{sacrifices to}} the God {{of his father}} Isaac," [...] {{and not to the}} God of Abraham and Isaac. Judah ben Pedayah, the nephew of Ben HaKappar, {{explained}} that when one encounters a teacher and the teacher's disciple walking on a road, one first greets the disciple and then the teacher. Rabbi Johanan said that the reason was because a person owes more honor to a parent than to a grandparent. Resh Lakish said that Jacob offered sacrifices (in thanksgiving) for the covenant with the ancestors (which Isaac had conveyed to Jacob with his blessing). Bar Kappara discussed the question with Rabbi Jose bar Patros. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>said</b> that Jacob declared that as Isaac had been eager for his food (for, as [...] reports, Isaac loved Esau because Esau brought Isaac venison), so Jacob was eager for his food (and thus was headed to Egypt to avoid the famine).

But then Jacob noted on reconsideration that Isaac was responsible for only one soul, whereas Jacob was responsible for 70 souls. Rabbi Judan said that Jacob declared that Isaac blessed him with five blessings, and God correspondingly appeared five times to Jacob and blessed him (in [...] and [...] ). Rabbi Judan also said that Jacob wanted to thank God for permitting Jacob to see the fulfillment of those blessings. And the blessing that was fulfilled was that of [...] "Let people serve you, and nations bow down to you," [...] which was fulfilled with regard to Joseph.

Rabbi Berekiah observed that God never unites God's Name with a living person (to say, for example, [...] "I am the God of Jacob," [...] while they are alive) except with those who are experiencing suffering. (And thus Jacob referred to the God of Isaac instead of the God of Jacob.) And Rabbi Berekiah also observed that Isaac did indeed experience suffering. The Rabbis said that we look upon Isaac as if his ashes were heaped in a pile on the altar.
