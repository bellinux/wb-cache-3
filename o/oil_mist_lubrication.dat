5000|$|<b>Oil</b> <b>mist</b> <b>lubrication</b> oils {{are applied}} to rolling element (antifriction) {{bearings}} as an oil mist. Neither oil rings nor constant level lubricators are used in pumps and drivers connected to plant-wide oil mist systems. Oil mist is an atomized amount of oil carried or suspended in a volume of pressurized dry air. The oil mist, actually a ratio of one volume of oil suspended or carried in 200,000 volumes of clean, dry air, moves in a piping system (header). The point of origin is usually a mixing valve (the oil mist generator), connected to this header. Branch lines often feed oil mist to hundreds of rolling elements in the many pumps and drivers connected to a plant-wide system.|$|E
50|$|Unlike larger engines, the {{crankcase}} {{does not}} contain only engine oil because it handles the fuel/air mixture. Instead, oil is {{mixed in with the}} fuel supply as petroil, and this mixture provides splash lubrication for the cylinder walls, crankshaft and connecting rod bearings. Using ball or roller bearings for the bearings in such engines has always been more common than the oil-fed plain bearings used for other engines, as these are more amenable to using this <b>oil</b> <b>mist</b> <b>lubrication.</b> These engines have been used in larger sizes for small cars. They were considered in the 1980s as more fuel efficient engines for larger cars, but the increased interest in engine emissions at this time prevented their use: mixing their lubricating oil into the engine's intake mixture gave high HC emissions and this problem was not overcome.|$|E

The mist air was also supplied at 366 K (200 F) to the radial position mist nozzle at a constant rate of 0. 0632 mol/s (3 SCFM) per nozzle. The lubricant contained in the mist air varied between 32 - 44 cc/hour. In the recirculating jet spray mode, the flow rate was varied between 1893 - 2650 cc/hour. Visual inspection revealed the jet spray mode produced a superior surface finish on the gear teeth but a thermal energy survey showed a 15 - 20 % increase in heat generated. The gear tooth condition in the <b>mist</b> <b>lubrication</b> mode system could be improved if the cooling air and lubricant/air flow ratio were increased.

40|$|Parametric {{tests were}} {{conducted}} with an optimized 35 -mm-bore-angular-contact ball bearing on a high-speed, high-temperature bearing tester. Results from both air-oil <b>mist</b> <b>lubrication</b> and oil-jet lubrication systems used to lubricate the bearing were compared to speeds of 2. 5 x 10 (exp 6) DN. The maximum obtainable speed with air-oil <b>mist</b> <b>lubrication</b> is 2. 5 x 10 (exp 6) DN. Lower bearing temperatures and higher power losses are obtained with oil-jet lubrication than with air-oil <b>mist</b> <b>lubrication.</b> Bearing power loss is a direct function of oil flow to the bearing and independent of oil delivery system. For a given oil-flow rate, bearing temperature and power loss increase with increases in speed. Bearing life is an inverse function of temperature, the difference in temperature between the individual bearing ring components, and the resultant elastohydrodynamic (EHD) film thicknesses. Bearing life is independent of the oil delivery system except as it affects temperature. Cage slip increased with increases in speed. Cage slip as high as 7 % was measured and was generally higher with air-oil <b>mist</b> <b>lubrication</b> than with oil-jet lubrication...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 89 - 90). Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. <b>Oil</b> <b>mist</b> <b>lubrication</b> offers many advantages over sump lubrication. Unfortunately, mist lubrication generates sub-micrometer sized aerosol particles (fines) that escape from the <b>oil</b> <b>mist</b> <b>lubrication</b> system. These particles are an environmental hazard. There can be a two-pronged approach to the present problem. The first method is to develop a suitable blend that reduces the number of 'fine' particles. Experiments are designed to identify the effect of the additives and the temperature of the lube oil in the generator. The best performing lube oil formulations are identified based on performance at different bearing speeds and the temperature of the lube oil in the generator. The second approach is based on the design of a better bearing casing to maximize collection efficiency. An attempt is made to study collection efficiency using dimensional analysis. The non-dimensional numbers are identified and their validity is analyzed. Alternatively, a boundary value problem based on continuum mechanics is partially formulated for future study...|$|E

MQL has become an attractive option to dry and flood cutting in terms of being able to increase tool life and reduce the cost of the product.

40|$|LectureThe {{choice of}} which {{lubrication}} strategy {{to apply for}} pump bearings has implications for both the short term characteristics exhibited by the bearings and their long term reliability. When lubricating rolling element bearings, four basic strategies have historically been employed: Grease lubrication; Oil bath lubrication; Oil lubrication via slinger disc or oil ring; <b>Oil</b> <b>mist</b> <b>lubrication.</b> For high speed (3000 RPM and higher), slinger discs or oil rings are commonly used due to the short re-greasing interval exhibited with grease lubrication and the high heat generation due to churning seen with oil bath lubrication. This paper seeks to reprise the work of Lemmon & Booser, Heshmat & Pinkus, Gardner and Ettles et al in defining the equations of performance related to oil slinger discs and oil rings. It will then {{address some of the}} operational and reliability concerns of each of these oiling methods using a purpose built test rig that is representative of {{the current state of the}} art in bearing housing design for pumps. Specifically it will look at how the following parameters affect oil delivery and stability: Rotational speed; Bearing housing inclination; Oil ring material; Slinger geometry; Slinger and oil ring submergence depth...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{assess the}} {{relation}} between measured levels of exposure to soluble <b>oil</b> <b>mists</b> in a plant manufacturing ball bearings, and both respiratory symptoms and airway responsiveness in the workforce. METHODS: 114 male workers exposed to <b>oil</b> <b>mist</b> and 55 unexposed male controls from nearby factories were studied. Soluble <b>oil</b> <b>mist</b> concentrations were measured with area samplers. Respiratory symptoms were assessed by questionnaire and measurement of airway responsiveness to methacholine with an abbreviated method. Subjects were labelled positive to methacholine airway challenge (MAC+) if forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) fell by > or = 20 %. The linear dose-response slope was calculated as the percentage fall in FEV 1 at the last dose divided by the total dose given. RESULTS: Geometric mean concentrations of <b>oil</b> <b>mists</b> ranged from 0. 65 mg/m 3 (GSD 1. 29) to 2. 20 mg/m 3 (GSD 1. 55) based on 92 measurements obtained from 1979 - 93. The prevalence of chronic cough or phlegm, bouts of bronchitis, and dyspnoea was greater among exposed workers than among controls (odds ratio (OR) 4. 64, P = 0. 002 for chronic cough and phlegm). After adjustment for smoking and age, dyspnoea {{was significantly related to}} an index of cumulative exposure to <b>oil</b> <b>mist</b> (OR 1. 44, P = 0. 006 / 10 y. mg/m 3). The proportion of MAC+ subjects was similar in the two groups. However, after adjustment for baseline FEV 1 and age, the dose-response slope was significantly steeper among exposed workers than among controls (P = 0. 01), a finding indicating airway hyperresponsiveness in the exposed workers. Furthermore, the dose-response slope was significantly related to baseline FEV 1, age, and, after adjustment for FEV 1, the index of cumulative exposure to oil (P = 0. 004). CONCLUSION: Subjects with exposure to soluble <b>oil</b> <b>mist</b> in the metal industry are at risk of developing both respiratory symptoms and airway hyperresponsiveness...|$|R

The diesel engineers have, so far, neglected investigations in this held and the literature available on blowby emissions investigation is very scarce. This paper deals with investigations on the control of blowby emissions in high power turbocharged diesel engine by installing positive crank case ventilation (PCV) system. The lubricating <b>oil</b> <b>mist</b> escaping with blowby gases is also quite significant. Feasibility of recovering this mist by installing in the PCV system a lubricating <b>oil</b> <b>mist</b> separator, designed and fabricated for the purpose has been established. The results obtained clearly show that the blowby emissions can be effectively controlled with the help of PCV system. However, the cross-section area of the PCV pipe has to be adjusted according to the amount of blowby gases and the inflow of ventilating air through the breather.

50|$|In many vehicles, a {{crankcase}} breather pipe feeds {{into the air}} intake to vent the crankcase without releasing raw hydrocarbon vapors into the atmosphere. In a highly worn engine, hot gases, including unburnt fuel can blow past the piston rings and into the crankcase. This creates an excess <b>oil</b> <b>mist,</b> which is then drawn from the crankcase into the air intake via the breather. A diesel engine will readily burn this <b>oil</b> <b>mist</b> as fuel, since engine oil has similar energy content and combustion properties as diesel fuel. The extra fuel causes the engine revolutions to increase, causing still more <b>oil</b> <b>mist</b> to be {{forced out of the}} crankcase and into the engine, and a positive feedback loop is created. The engine quickly reaches a point where it is generating so much fuel from its own crankcase oil that it can sustain operation even with the normal fuel supply shut off, and it will run faster and faster until it is destroyed.|$|R
