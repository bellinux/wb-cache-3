5|$|An {{increase}} in intracranial pressure {{may lead to}} impairment of the <b>optic</b> nerves (II) due to compression of the surrounding veins and capillaries, causing swelling of the eyeball (papilloedema). A cancer, such as an <b>optic</b> glioma, may also impact the <b>optic</b> nerve (II). A pituitary tumour may compress the <b>optic</b> tracts or the <b>optic</b> chiasm of the <b>optic</b> nerve (II), leading to visual field loss. A pituitary tumour may also extend into the cavernous sinus, compressing the oculuomotor nerve (III), trochlear nerve (IV) and abducens nerve (VI), leading to double-vision and strabismus. These nerves may also be affected by herniation of the temporal lobes of the brain through the falx cerebri.|$|E
5|$|As of {{the year}} 2000, about 15% of United States {{consumption}} of germanium was used for infrared optics technology and 50% for fiber-optics. Over the past 20 years, infrared use has consistently decreased; fiber <b>optic</b> demand, however, is slowly increasing. In America, 30–50% of current fiber <b>optic</b> lines are unused dark fiber, sparking discussion of over-production and a future reduction in demand. Worldwide, demand is increasing dramatically as countries such as China are installing fiber <b>optic</b> telecommunication lines throughout the country.|$|E

5|$|Damage to the <b>optic</b> nerve (II) affects {{specific}} {{aspects of}} vision that depend on {{the location of the}} lesion. A person {{may not be able to}} see objects on their left or right sides (homonymous hemianopsia), or may have difficulty seeing objects on their outer visual fields (bitemporal hemianopsia) if the <b>optic</b> chiasm is involved. Vision may be tested by examining the visual field, or by examining the retina with an ophthalmoscope, using a process known as funduscopy. Visual field testing may be used to pin-point structural lesions in the <b>optic</b> nerve, or further along the visual pathways.|$|E

5|$|There {{have also}} been {{dramatic}} changes in telephone communication behind the scenes. Starting with the operation of TAT-8 in 1988, the 1990s saw the widespread adoption of systems based on optical fibers. The benefit of communicating with <b>optic</b> fibers is that they offer a drastic increase in data capacity. TAT-8 itself was able to carry 10 times as many telephone calls as the last copper cable laid {{at that time and}} today's <b>optic</b> fibre cables are able to carry 25 times as many telephone calls as TAT-8. This increase in data capacity is due to several factors: First, <b>optic</b> fibres are physically much smaller than competing technologies. Second, they do not suffer from crosstalk which means several hundred of them can be easily bundled together in a single cable. Lastly, improvements in multiplexing have led to an exponential growth in the data capacity of a single fibre.|$|E

5|$|After an apoplexy, the {{pressure}} inside the sella turcica rises, and surrounding {{structures such as}} the <b>optic</b> nerve and {{the contents of the}} cavernous sinus are compressed. The raised pressure further impairs the blood supply to the pituitary hormone-producing tissue, leading to tissue death due to insufficient blood supply.|$|E
5|$|Connecting the {{forebrain}} to the midbrain is the diencephalon (in the diagram, {{this structure}} {{is below the}} <b>optic</b> lobes and consequently not visible). The diencephalon performs functions associated with hormones and homeostasis. The pineal body lies just above the diencephalon. This structure detects light, maintains circadian rhythms, and controls color changes.|$|E
5|$|Damage and {{subsequent}} dysfunction in mitochondria {{is an important}} factor in a range of human diseases due to their influence in cell metabolism. Mitochondrial disorders often present themselves as neurological disorders, including autism. They can also manifest as myopathy, diabetes, multiple endocrinopathy, and a variety of other systemic disorders. Diseases caused by mutation in the mtDNA include Kearns-Sayre syndrome, MELAS syndrome and Leber's hereditary <b>optic</b> neuropathy. In the vast majority of cases, these diseases are transmitted by a female to her children, as the zygote derives its mitochondria and hence its mtDNA from the ovum. Diseases such as Kearns-Sayre syndrome, Pearson syndrome, and progressive external ophthalmoplegia are thought to be due to large-scale mtDNA rearrangements, whereas other diseases such as MELAS syndrome, Leber's hereditary <b>optic</b> neuropathy, myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers (MERRF), and others are due to point mutations in mtDNA.|$|E

5|$|For visual course control, flies' <b>optic</b> {{flow field}} is {{analyzed}} {{by a set}} of motion-sensitive neurons. A subset of these neurons is thought to be involved in using the <b>optic</b> flow to estimate the parameters of self-motion, such as yaw, roll, and sideward translation. Other neurons are thought to be involved in analyzing the content of the visual scene itself, such as separating figures from the ground using motion parallax. The H1 neuron is responsible for detecting horizontal motion across the entire visual field of the fly, allowing the fly to generate and guide stabilizing motor corrections midflight with respect to yaw. The ocelli are concerned in the detection of changes in light intensity, enabling the fly to react swiftly to the approach of an object.|$|E

5|$|Octopuses have a {{relatively}} short life expectancy; some species live {{for as little as}} six months. The giant Pacific octopus, one of the two largest species of octopus, may live for as much as five years. Octopus lifespan is limited by reproduction: males can live for only a few months after mating, and females die shortly after their eggs hatch. Octopus reproductive organs mature due to the hormonal influence of the <b>optic</b> gland but result in the inactivation of their digestive glands, typically causing the octopus to eventually die from starvation. Experimental removal of both <b>optic</b> glands after spawning was found to result in the cessation of broodiness, the resumption of feeding, increased growth, and greatly extended lifespans.|$|E

5|$|<b>Optic</b> nerve sheath {{fenestration}} is {{an operation}} that involves the making of an incision in the connective tissue lining of the <b>optic</b> nerve in its portion behind the eye. It is not entirely clear how it protects the eye from the raised pressure, {{but it may be}} the result of either diversion of the CSF into the orbit or the creation of an area of scar tissue that lowers the pressure. The effects on the intracranial pressure itself are more modest. Moreover, the procedure may lead to significant complications, including blindness in 1–2%. The procedure is therefore recommended mainly in those who have limited headache symptoms but significant papilledema or threatened vision, or in those who have undergone unsuccessful treatment with a shunt or have a contraindication for shunt surgery.|$|E
5|$|Pressure on {{the part}} of the <b>optic</b> nerve known as the chiasm, which is located above the gland, leads to loss of vision on the outer side of the visual field on both sides, as this {{corresponds}} to areas on the retinas supplied by these parts of the <b>optic</b> nerve; it is encountered in 75% of cases. Visual acuity is reduced in half, and over 60% have a visual field defect. The visual loss depends on which part of the nerve is affected. If the part of the nerve between the eye and the chiasm is compressed, the result is vision loss in one eye. If the part after the chiasm is affected, visual loss on one side of the visual field occurs.|$|E
5|$|Some animals {{mimic the}} <b>optic</b> {{flow of the}} background, so that the {{attacker}} {{does not appear to}} move when seen by the target. This is the main focus of work on motion camouflage, and is often treated as synonymous with it. An attacker can achieve this by choosing its flight path so as to remain on the line between the target and either some real landmark point, or a point at infinite distance (giving different pursuit algorithms). It therefore does not move from the landmark point as seen by the target, though it inevitably looms larger as it approaches. This {{is not the same as}} moving straight towards the target (classical pursuit): that results in visible sideways motion with a readily detectable difference in <b>optic</b> flow from the background. The strategy works whether the background is plain or textured.|$|E

5|$|Sometimes, {{there are}} {{additional}} symptoms {{that arise from}} the underlying cause; for instance, if the hypopituitarism {{is due to a}} growth hormone-producing tumor, there may be symptoms of acromegaly (enlargement of the hands and feet, coarse facial features), and if the tumor extends to the <b>optic</b> nerve or <b>optic</b> chiasm, there may be visual field defects. Headaches may also accompany pituitary tumors, as well as pituitary apoplexy (infarction or haemorrhage of a pituitary tumor) and lymphocytic hypophysitis (autoimmune inflammation of the pituitary). Apoplexy, in addition to sudden headaches and rapidly worsening visual loss, may also be associated with double vision that results from compression of the nerves in the adjacent cavernous sinus that control the eye muscles.|$|E
