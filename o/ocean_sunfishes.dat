50|$|Robert Collett, who {{examined}} {{some of the}} first known specimens of sharptail mola, speculated they might represent abnormal <b>ocean</b> <b>sunfishes</b> that had retained larval characteristics. However, the caudal projection is now known to be a secondary development that follows the loss of the primary tail. The swimming mode of the sharptail {{is similar to that of}} other <b>ocean</b> <b>sunfishes,</b> using sculling motions of its long dorsal and anal fins to propel itself through the water. The anal fin moves more extensively than the dorsal fin. The small pectoral fins move constantly to control pitch, while the clavus is employed as a rudder.|$|E
50|$|Austromola angerhoferi is an {{extinct species}} of the <b>ocean</b> <b>sunfishes</b> (Molidae). It is known from the Lower Miocene Ebelsberg Formation near Pucking, Austria. This species was a {{resident}} of the Paratethys Sea and is estimated to have reached a length around 320 cm.|$|E
5000|$|The Molidae {{comprise}} {{the family of}} the molas or <b>ocean</b> <b>sunfishes,</b> unusual fish whose bodies come to an end just behind the dorsal and anal fins, giving them a [...] "half-fish" [...] appearance. They are also the largest of the ray-finned bony fish, with the ocean sunfish Mola mola recorded at up to 15 ft in length and 2000 kg in weight.|$|E

40|$|<b>Ocean</b> <b>sunfishes</b> of {{the family}} Molidae are large pelagic fishes rarely found along the {{south-west}} coast of India. Presently, four species are recognised under this family throughout the world. An ocean sunfish,Mola mola was landed in Beypore fishing harbour, Calicut on 14. 12. 06.

40|$|<b>Ocean</b> <b>sunfishes,</b> Molidae, {{comprise}} the world’s heaviest bony fishes. They include the short mola, Mola ramsayi (Giglioli 1883), an important tourist draw at Nusa Penida and Nusa Lembongan, Bali, where SCUBA divers can observe ectoparasite-laden individuals being cleaned by smaller reef fishes. Despite widespread appeal, {{little is known}} about these fishes relative to regional oceanography. We present the first behavioral information for this species anywhere in the world. Satellite tag data indicate a wide thermal range (10 – 27. 5 °C) with depth occupation mostly (95 %) in the upper 250 [*]m and habitat preference {{near the bottom of the}} warm surface layer. One tag popped off as scheduled after 6 months off Nusa Penida, < 10 [*]km from its original deployment. The 3 other tags popped off prematurely: 747 [*]km southeast 89 days after deployment; 142 [*]km south after 7 days of deployment; and 162 [*]km south after 24 days of deployment. Amid mounting tourist pressures and bycatch of M. ramsayi in eastern regions of Indonesia, such as Alor, behavioral information of this species is essential for effective management and conservation of this valuable marine ecotourism asset...|$|E
40|$|The {{taxonomy}} of the <b>ocean</b> <b>sunfishes</b> (Molidae) has a complicated history. Currently, three genera and four species are recognized, including {{two in the}} genus Mola (M. mola and M. ramsayi). In 2009, a genetic study revealed a potential third species, Mola species C, in Southeast Australian waters. Concentrating on this region, we obtained samples and morphological data from 27 Mola sp. C specimens, genetically confirmed {{the existence of this}} species (mtDNA D-loop and cytochrome c oxidase 1), and established its morphology across a size spectrum of 50 – 242 cm total length. Mola sp. C is diagnosed by clavus meristics [15 – 17 fin rays (13 – 15 principal, 2 minor), 5 – 7 ossicles, paraxial ossicles separate], clavus morphology (prominent smooth band back-fold, rounded clavus edge with an indent), and body scale morphology (raised conical midpoints, non-branching). This species does not develop a protruding snout, or swollen dorso- or ventrolateral ridges. Body proportions remain similar with growth. A review of the historic literature revealed that Mola sp. C is a new, hitherto undescribed species, M. tecta, which we describe and diagnose, and that it is the first proposed addition to the genus Mola in 125 years. Its core distribution is likely in the temperate waters of the Southern Hemisphere...|$|E

40|$|<b>Ocean</b> <b>sunfishes,</b> {{with their}} {{peculiar}} morphology, large size, and surface habits, are valuable assets in ecotourism destinations worldwide. This study investigates site fidelity and long-range movements of short ocean sunfish, Mola ramsayi (Giglioli 1883), at Punta Vicente Roca (PVR) off Isabela Island in the Galapagos Islands. Five individuals were tracked between 32 and 733 days using ultrasonic receivers and transmitters. Two of the 5 were also tracked with towed pop-off satellite tags. One travelled to the equatorial front covering 2700 [*]km in 53 days, with dive depths {{in the upper}} 360 [*]m at temperatures between 9. 2 °C and 22 °C. During its westward travel, dives extended to 1112 [*]m (the deepest depth yet recorded for Molidae) into temperatures ranging between 4. 5 °C and 23. 2 °C. The remaining four individuals demonstrated site fidelity to PVR and were detected at the site between 128 – 1361 times {{for a total of}} 3557 reports. Forty-eight percent of the reports occurred during daytime hours and 52 % after dark. Presumed cleaning session durations had a median of 15 minutes and a maximum of nearly 100 minutes. No other ultrasonic arrays around Galapagos or in the Eastern Pacific regional network recorded the presence of tagged individuals. These data are combined with tourist vessel sightings and submersible observations to confirm Punta Vicente Roca as an important sunfish hotspot...|$|E
40|$|SYNOPSIS. The use of fossils in the phylogenetics of extant clades {{traditionally}} {{has been a}} contentious issue. Fossils usually are relatively incomplete, and their use commonly leads {{to an increase in}} the number of equally most parsimonious trees and a decrease in the resolution of phylogenies. Fossils alone, however, provide certain kinds of information about the biological history of a clade, and computer simulations have shown that even highly incomplete material can, under certain circumstances, increase the accuracy of a phylogeny, rather than decrease it. Because empirical data are still scarce on the effects of the inclusion of fossils on phylogenetic reconstruc-tions, we attempted to investigate this problem by using a relatively well-known group of acanthomorph fishes, the Tetraodontiformes (triggerfishes, pufferfishes, and <b>ocean</b> <b>sunfishes),</b> for which robust phylogenies using extant taxa already exist and that has a well-studied fossil record. Adding incomplete fossil taxa of tetraodontiforms usually increases the number of equally most parsimonious trees and often decreases the resolution of consensus trees. However, adding fossil taxa may help to correctly establish relationships among lineages that have experienced high degrees of morphological diversification by allowing for a reinterpre-tation of homologous and homoplastic features, increasing the resolution rather than decreasing it. Fur-thermore, taxa that were scored for 25 % or more of their characters did not cause a significant loss of resolution, while providing unique biological information...|$|E
40|$|Vertebrate dentitions are {{extraordinarily}} {{diverse in}} both morphology and regenerative capacity. The teleost order Tetraodontiformes exhibits an exceptional array of novel dental morphologies, epitomized by constrained beak-like dentitions in several families, i. e., porcupinefishes, three-toothed pufferfishes, <b>ocean</b> <b>sunfishes,</b> and pufferfishes. Modification of tooth replacement within these groups {{leads to the}} progressive accumulation of tooth generations, underlying the structure of their beaks. We focus on the dentition of the pufferfish (Tetraodontidae) because of its distinct dental morphology. This complex dentition develops {{as a result of}} (i) a {{reduction in the number of}} tooth positions from seven to one per quadrant during the transition from first to second tooth generations and (ii) a dramatic shift in tooth morphogenesis following the development of the first-generation teeth, leading to the elongation of dental units along the jaw. Gene expression and 1, 1 ′-Dioctadecyl- 3, 3, 3 ′, 3 ′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI) lineage tracing reveal a putative dental epithelial progenitor niche, suggesting a highly conserved mechanism for tooth regeneration despite the development of a unique dentition. MicroCT analysis reveals restricted labial openings in the beak, through which the dental epithelium (lamina) invades the cavity of the highly mineralized beak. Reduction in the number of replacement tooth positions coincides with the development of only four labial openings in the pufferfish beak, restricting connection of the oral epithelium to the dental cavity. Our data suggest the spatial restriction of dental regeneration, coupled with the unique extension of the replacement dental units throughout the jaw, are primary contributors to the evolution and development of this unique beak-like dentition...|$|E
40|$|Relatively {{little is}} known about the biology and ecology of the world’s largest (heaviest) bony fish, the <b>ocean</b> <b>sunfish</b> Mola mola, despite its {{worldwide}} occurrence in temperate and tropical seas. Studies are now emerging that require many common perceptions about sunfish behaviour and ecology to be re-examined. Indeed, the long-held view that <b>ocean</b> <b>sunfish</b> are an inactive, passively drifting species seems to be entirely misplaced. Technological advances in marine telemetry are revealing distinct behavioural patterns and protracted seasonal movements. Extensive forays by <b>ocean</b> <b>sunfish</b> into the deep ocean have been documented and broad-scale surveys, together with molecular and laboratory based techniques, are addressing the connectivity and trophic role of these animals. These emerging molecular and movement studies suggest that local distinct populations may be prone to depletion through bycatch in commercial fisheries. Rising interest in <b>ocean</b> <b>sunfish,</b> highlighted by the increase in recent publications, warrants a thorough review of the biology and ecology of this species. Here we review the taxonomy, morphology, geography, diet, locomotion, vision, movements, foraging ecology, reproduction and species interactions of M. mola. We present a summary of current conservation issues and suggest methods for addressing fundamental gaps in our knowledge...|$|R
