5|$|In <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>address</b> the {{shortcomings}} of the RNZAF's Skyhawk fleet, the New Zealand Government approved the Project Kahu program in May 1985. This project had a total cost of NZ$140 million, and primarily involved upgrading the A-4G and A-4Ks' avionics to almost the standard of those fitted to the modern General Dynamics F-16C Fighting Falcon. The Skyhawks also received new wings drawn from the stock of spare parts purchased from the RAN in 1984. Work began on the first aircraft in 1986, and the program was completed in 1991. After receiving the Kahu upgrade package the A-4Gs were re-designated A-4Ks.|$|E
5|$|The Sea Dart {{began as}} Convair's entry in a 1948 U.S. Navy contest for a {{supersonic}} interceptor aircraft. During the time, {{there was much}} skepticism about operating supersonic aircraft from carrier decks. So in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>address</b> this issue, U.S. Navy ordered many subsonic fighters. The worry had some foundation, since many supersonic designs of the time required long takeoff rolls, had high approach speeds, and were not very stable or easy to control—all factors that were troublesome on a carrier.|$|E
5|$|With condo prices {{set from}} US$500,000 to US$2,000,000, many critics {{have noted that}} the One Rincon Hill complex is too {{expensive}} for most San Franciscans. With the total initial development cost of US$290 million, the average development cost per unit with 709 units total is approximately US$409,000. However, the developer Urban West Associates has contributed a total of US$38.5 million to funds like the South of Market Community Stabilization Fund in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>address</b> this concern.|$|E

5|$|The Nagorno-Karabakh {{movement}} that had originally begun in Armenia {{during the late}} 1980s called for the Karabakh enclave to be united with that country, despite it being behind the borders of Azerbaijan. With a population that was 75 percent Armenian, official petitions were sent by Armenian leaders to the Soviet government in Moscow in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>address</b> the issue but were rejected by General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev. The demands to annex the region came {{in the middle of}} Gorbachev's reform policies, Glasnost and Perestroika. First implemented in 1985, when Gorbachev came into power, the liberalization of political and economical constraints in the Soviet Union gave birth to numerous nationalist groups in the different Soviet republics who insisted that they be given the right to secede and form their own independent countries.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the first}} {{skirmish}} in Pakrac in March, a predominantly Serb-populated area {{east of the}} town, straddling the Pakrac–Bučje–Požega road, remained generally {{beyond the control of}} Croatian authorities. In early July, the insurrection spread to the entire area between the towns of Pakrac and Požega and north to the northern slopes of Papuk and Bilogora. This development threatened to interdict the Croatian use of the Varaždin–Osijek road, as it was within range of Croatian Serb artillery near Slatina. After the Serb rebels declared the Serbian Autonomous Oblast of Western Slavonia (SAO Western Slavonia) and expanded the territory under their control to include the town of Okučani, the most significant transport route between Zagreb and Slavonia—the Zagreb–Belgrade motorway between Novska and Nova Gradiška—was severed. SAO Western Slavonia comprised no major settlements. In <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>address</b> this deficiency, Croatian Serb forces launched an offensive early on 19 August. The objectives of the offensive were to capture the towns of Grubišno Polje, Daruvar, Pakrac and Lipik, and consolidate the territory of SAO Western Slavonia. The offensive failed after the arrival of Croatian reinforcements from Zagreb and Bjelovar, but the line of control remained in close proximity to the four towns.|$|E

These priors have full support {{in the space of}} stochastically ordered distributions, and can be used for collections of unknown mixture distributions to obtain a flexible class of mixture models. Theoretical properties are discussed, efficient methods are developed for posterior computation using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation and the methods are illustrated using data from a study of DNA damage and repair.
