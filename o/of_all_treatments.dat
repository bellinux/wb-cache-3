Many new treatments were tried, since existing methods for heavy metal poisoning were not particularly effective. Dimercaprol was administered to several patients, but caused rapid deterioration of their condition. It was ruled out {{as a treatment for}} this sort of poisoning following the outbreak. Polythiol resins, penicillamine and dimercaprol sulfonate all helped, but are believed to have been largely insignificant in overall recovery and outcomes. Dialysis was tested on a few patients late in the treatment period, but they showed no clinical improvement. The result <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>treatments</b> was varied, with some patients' blood mercury level being dramatically reduced, but a negligible effect in others. All patients received periods of treatment interspersed with lay periods; continuous treatment was suggested in future cases. Later treatment was less effective in reducing blood toxicity.|$|E

50|$|Treatment has {{traditionally}} been splenectomy. However, splenectomy is avoided if possible, particularly in children, to avoid the resulting permanent susceptibility to bacterial infections. Most small, and some moderate-sized lacerations in stable patients (particularly children) are managed with hospital observation and sometimes transfusion rather than surgery. Embolization, blocking off of the hemorrhaging vessels, is a newer and less invasive treatment. When surgery is needed, the spleen can be surgically repaired in a few cases, but splenectomy is still the primary surgical treatment, and has the highest success rate <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>treatments.</b>|$|E
50|$|In the {{dry solid}} growth test, {{it was found}} that when mixed at 25% with soil, corn had the highest {{recorded}} heights <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>treatments</b> when compared to commonly used all-purpose plant food. This indicates that under the correct mixing ratio, the LWR dry solid fertilizer supports the growth of corn. The study determined that the nitrogen and potassium in the 50% LWR liquid solution is more easily adsorbed by corn than when compared to a commonly used all-purpose plant food. Corn that was fed the all-purpose fertilizer absorbed 7.958% of input nitrogen and 9.105% of input potassium. When given the 50% LWR liquid solution, percentages of absorption increased to 22.87% and 24.98%, respectively.|$|E

50|$|Primary spine {{practitioners}} (also {{referred to}} as PSP, Spine Care Clinician, or Spine Care Specialist, or in the broader context a primary musculoskeletal specialist or provider) are health care professionals who are specially trained to provide primary care for patients with spinal disease.The PSP has the training necessary to provide differential diagnosis, rule out serious pathology (such as infection, fracture, cancer, inflammatory joint disease) and provide evidence-based management {{for the majority of}} patients with spinal disease. Evidence-based treatment methods include spinal manipulation and manual therapy, rehabilitative exercises, patient education, motivational techniques and the application of psychological principles, particularly those of cognitive-behavioral therapy and acceptance and commitment therapy.In addition, the PSP has the ability to recognize the relatively few patients who require special tests (radiography, MRI, laboratory workup) and invasive procedures (injections, surgery) and to serve as the center of care for the purpose of providing counseling for the patient, coordination of care and long term follow up.An important aspect of this role is educating the patient on the risks, benefits and research evidence <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>treatments</b> for spinal pain so that, through a shared decision making process, appropriate choices can be made as to what is the best treatment for the patient.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the effects of brown seaweed (Undaria pinnatifida) by-product and seaweed fusiforme (Hizikia fusiformis) by-product supplementation on growth performance and blood profiles including serum immunoglobulin (Ig) in broilers. Fermentation of seaweeds was conducted by Bacillus subtilis and Aspergillus oryzae. In a 5 -wk feeding trial, 750 one-d-old broiler chicks were divided into 5 groups, and were assigned to the control diet or experimental diets including control+ 0. 5 % brown seaweed (BS) by-product, control+ 0. 5 % seaweed fusiforme (SF) by-product, control+ 0. 5 % fermented brown seaweed (FBS) by-product, and control+ 0. 5 % fermented seaweed fusiforme (FSF) by-product. As a consequence, body weight gain (BWG) and gain:feed of seaweed by-product groups were clearly higher, when compared to those of control diet group from d 18 to 35 and the entire experimental period (p< 0. 05). In mortality rate, seaweed by-product groups were significantly lower when compared to control diet group during entire experimental period (p< 0. 05). However, Feed Intake of experimental diets group was not {{different from that of the}} control group during the entire experimental period. Whereas, Feed Intake of fermented seaweed by-product groups was lower than that of non-fermented seaweed groups (p< 0. 05). Total organ weights, lipids, and glutamic oxalacetic transaminase (GOT) <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>treatment</b> groups were not different from those of control group. However, glutamic pyruvate transaminase (GPT) <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>treatment</b> groups was higher than that of control group at d 17 (p< 0. 05). In case of serum Igs concentration, the concentration of IgA antibody in BS, SF, FSF treatment groups was significantly higher than in control group at d 35 (p< 0. 01). IgA concentration in FBS supplementation groups was negligibly decreased when compared to the control group. IgM concentration in the serums <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>treatment</b> groups was significantly higher than in control group (p< 0. 05) and in fermented seaweed by-product groups were much higher than in non-fermented seaweed groups (p< 0. 05). On the other hand, IgG concentrations in <b>all</b> <b>treatment</b> groups were lower than in control group (p< 0. 05). Taken together, our results suggest that by-product dietary supplementation of BS, SF, FBS, and FSF in poultry may provide positive effects of growth performance and immune response...|$|R
