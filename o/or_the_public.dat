5|$|Public or {{representative}} standing {{is standing}} possessed by an applicant who brings a case {{on behalf of}} a larger group of people, or even {{in the interest of the}} general public. The applicant need not show that a personal right or interest has been infringed. As long as the represented individuals have, <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> has, sufficient interest in the matter, the applicant will be held to have adequate standing to pursue the case.|$|E

5|$|The bill then {{proceeds}} {{to the committee}} stage, where {{the details of the}} drafting of the proposed law are examined. Where a bill is relatively uncontroversial, it is referred to a committee of the whole Parliament; in other words, all the MPs attending the sitting form a committee and discuss the bill clause by clause. Bills that are more controversial, or that require the views of interested groups <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>public,</b> are often referred to a select committee. This is a committee of selected MPs who invite interested people to make representations to the committee. Public hearings to hear submissions on the bill may be held. The select committee then reports its findings, together with any suggested amendments to the bill, to Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Depending on the {{interest}} that the applicant seeks to represent, standing {{can be categorized}} as either private or public standing. Applicants must establish they have private standing if they seek to represent personal interests. In contrast, an applicant who seeks to represent {{the interest}}s of a larger group <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> at large must establish {{he or she has}} public or representative standing. Where private standing is concerned, the Singapore courts have not yet directly addressed the issue of the standing required to obtain a declaration in an administrative law case, but where constitutional claims are concerned the Court of Appeal held that three elements must exist: (1) the applicant must have a real interest in bringing the case, (2) there must be a real controversy between the parties to the case, and (3) a personal right possessed by the applicant must have been violated. The Court also suggested that the same test applied to applications for prerogative orders. The legal position on public standing in administrative law cases is indeterminate as, to date, no applicant has sought to rely on public standing to obtain leave for judicial review. In constitutional law cases, the Court has drawn a distinction between public and private rights, and held that people will not have standing to vindicate public rights unless they have suffered special damage and have genuine private interests to protect or further.|$|E
5|$|The Obscene Publications Act 1959 (c. 66) is an Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom Parliament that {{significantly}} reformed the law related to obscenity in England and Wales. Prior {{to the passage}} of the Act, the law on publishing obscene materials was governed by the common law case of R v Hicklin, which had no exceptions for artistic merit <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> good. During the 1950s, the Society of Authors formed a committee to recommend reform of the existing law, submitting a draft bill to the Home Office in February 1955. After several failed attempts to push a bill through Parliament, a committee finally succeeded in creating a viable bill, which was introduced to Parliament by Roy Jenkins and given the Royal Assent on 29 July 1959, coming into force on 29 August 1959 as the Obscene Publications Act 1959. With the committee consisting of both censors and reformers, the actual reform of the law was limited, with several extensions to police powers included in the final version.|$|E

25|$|Coins {{are usually}} metal or alloy, or {{sometimes}} made of synthetic materials. They are usually disc shaped.

In the last hundred years, the face value of circulation coins has occasionally been lower than {{the value of the}} metal they contain, for example due to inflation. If the difference becomes significant, the issuing authority may decide to withdraw these coins from circulation, possibly issuing new equivalents with a different composition, <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> may decide to melt the coins down or hoard them (see Gresham's law).|$|E
