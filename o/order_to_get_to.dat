5|$|The film's idea {{resulted}} from a small scale exercise between Nemescu and Liviu Marghidan {{when they were in}} university in 2003.

5|$|The next morning, Mulder shows Scully some tracks by {{the front}} door of the house that appear to be human. Based on the weight distribution, however, the assailant evidently travels on the balls of its feet rather than from heel to toe. Additionally, that the {{creature}} lured the mother out of the house in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> Louis suggests to Mulder that the creatures are paranormal in nature.|$|E
5|$|The Terminator and the T-1000 {{converge}} on John {{in a shopping}} mall, and a chase ensues after which John and the Terminator escape together on a motorcycle. Fearing that the T-1000 will kill Sarah in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> him, John orders the Terminator to help free her. They encounter Sarah as she is escaping from the hospital, although she is initially reluctant to trust the T-800. After the trio escapes from the T-1000 in a police car, the Terminator informs John and Sarah about Skynet's history. In addition, it would create machines that will hunt and kill the remnants of humanity. Sarah learns that the man most directly responsible for Skynet's creation is Miles Bennett Dyson, a Cyberdyne Systems engineer working on a revolutionary new neural net processor that will {{form the basis for}} Skynet.|$|E

5|$|In early 1945, Đurišić {{decided to}} move to the Ljubljana Gap {{independent}} of Mihailović, and arranged for Ljotić's forces already in Slovenia to meet him near Bihać in western Bosnia to assist his movement. In <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> Bihać, Đurišić had to make a safe-conduct agreement with elements of the Armed Forces of the Independent State of Croatia and with Montenegrin separatist Sekula Drljević. He was captured by the Ustaše and Drljević's followers in April 1945 and killed along with other Chetnik leaders, some Serbian Orthodox priests and others. Between March and April, Ljotić and Mihailović exchanged messages concerning a last-ditch alliance against the Partisans. Although the agreement was reached too late to be of any practical use, the forces of Ljotić and Mihailović came together under the command of Chetnik General Miodrag Damjanović on 27 March. Together, they tried to contact the western Allies in Italy in an attempt to secure foreign aid for a proposed anti-Communist offensive to restore royalist Yugoslavia. In mid-April, at Ljotić's request, Dožić and Velimirović blessed approximately 25,000 members of the SDS, SUK, Serbian Border Guard, and the Special Police, as well as Đujić's and Dobroslav Jevđević's Chetniks and Slovene collaborators, who had gathered on the Slovenian coast.|$|E

25|$|The {{widely publicized}} case of Christine and Walter Collins was {{depicted}} in the 2008 film Changeling. In March 1928, Christine Collins reported her nine-year-old son, Walter, missing. Five months later a boy named Arthur Hutchins came forth claiming to be Walter. When Mrs. Collins tried to tell the police that the boy was not her son, she was committed to a mental institution under a Section 12 internment. It was later determined that Walter had actually fallen victim to a child rapist/murderer in the infamous Wineville Chicken Coop Murders. Arthur Hutchins eventually {{admitted that he had}} lied about his identity in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> Hollywood and meet his favorite actor, Tom Mix.|$|E
25|$|All {{passengers}} {{traveling on}} international flight must {{pass through the}} duty-free shop in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> their flight. There is a possibility for some passengers (for example, those allergic to perfume) to ask security to use a narrow corridor which bypasses the shop. Nonetheless, the layout has been criticized by teetotalist organizations. The airport's response is that the layout was needed due to the terminal's small size. The shop has also been criticized for informing passengers who purchase less than their permitted tax-free quota of alcohol that {{they are allowed to}} purchase more. The Norwegian Directorate for Health and Social Affairs indicated that this may violate the ban on alcohol advertising.|$|E
25|$|Checking is {{prohibited}} in floorball. Controlled shoulder-to-shoulder contact is allowed, but ice hockey-like checking is forbidden. Pushing players without the ball or competing for a loose ball is also disallowed, {{and many of}} these infractions lead to two-minute penalties. The best comparison in terms of legal physical contact is football, where checking is used to improve one's positioning in relation to the ball rather than to remove an opposing player from the play. In addition to checking, players cannot lift another opponents stick or perform any stick infractions in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> the ball. As well, players may not raise their stick or play the ball above their knee level, and a stick cannot be placed in between a player's legs.|$|E

25|$|During {{this time}} of British {{victories}} along the Caribbean coast, events taking place in Spain would prove {{to have a significant}} effect on the outcome of the largest engagement of the war. Spain had decided to replace Don Pedro Hidalgo as governor of Cartagena de Indias. But, the new governor-designate, Lieutenant General of the Royal Armies Sebastián de Eslava y Lazaga had first to dodge the Royal Navy in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> his new post. Starting from the Galician port of Ferrol, the vessels Galicia and San Carlos set out on the journey. Hearing the news, Vernon immediately sent four ships to intercept the Spanish. They were unsuccessful in their mission. The Spanish managed to circumvent the British interceptors and entered the port of Cartagena on 21 April 1740, landing there with the new governor and several hundred veteran soldiers.|$|E
25|$|Commitments by Schwarzenegger {{delayed the}} start of filming by several months. The delay gave Silver enough time to secure a minor rewrite from screenwriter David Peoples. Principal {{photography}} eventually began in the jungles of Palenque, Mexico, near Villahermosa, Tabasco, during {{the second week of}} April 1986, but the film overall was filmed in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. Much of the material dealing with the unit's deployment in the jungle was completed in a few short weeks and both Silver and Gordon were pleased by the dailies provided by McTiernan. On Friday, April 25, production halted so that Schwarzenegger could fly to Hyannis Port in a Learjet chartered by Silver in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> his wedding on time. He was married on April 26, 1986, to Maria Shriver, and honeymooned for only three days while the second unit completed additional lensing. The production resumed filming on May 12.|$|E
25|$|The cunning folk of Britain {{were often}} from the {{societal}} class that included artisans, tradesmen, and farmers, {{and as such}} were commonly at least semi-literate and of a higher social position than common labourers. In many cases they continued in their ordinary line of work alongside earning money as a professional cunning man or woman {{in order to gain}} the maximum possible income. In almost all cases, cunning folk worked either alone, as a solitary magical practitioner, or with one other person, such as a spouse or sibling. The only known exception was in early nineteenth-century Manchester, where a group of cunning men used to meet in a group centred around the most prominent of their members, a cunning fellow called Rawlinson. This method of working alone was one factor that separated the cunning folk from the stereotype of witches then prevalent in Britain, which often held that these witches met together in groups, sometimes known as covens, and at times flew through the air in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> their meeting points.|$|E

Bart is controlled by the player both on foot and on a skateboard. To get rid of aliens, which are disguised as real humans, he needs to jump on their heads, although some are just regular humans. The game increases in difficulty for every level, and Bart meets up with a boss {{at the end of the}} first four. The levels are familiar to fans of The Simpsons and {{some of the}} television humor appears in the game: for example, in the first level Bart can make a prank call to the bartender Moe in order for him to run outside so that the player can spray paint his purple apron (an example of an item that the aliens need) into a red color that the aliens do not want. The game also includes some minigames.|$|E

At Glasgow Prestwick Airport, 9 charter flights departed before 9 a.m. BST with 3,500 additional fans.|$|E
