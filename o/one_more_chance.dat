United progressed well in that season's UEFA Cup and Shearer's six goals helped the club reach the semi-finals, where they were beaten by eventual runners up Olympique de Marseille. Domestically he also had a good season, with 22goals in 37appearances, however could not prevent the club dropping out of the Champions League places to finish in fifth, qualifying once again for the UEFA Cup.|$|E

By the time the tour finally finished in early May, Clarke's international career looked in serious jeopardy, but he was given <b>one</b> <b>more</b> <b>chance</b> by injuries to Flintoff and Marcus Trescothick early in the summer of 2004.

25|$|Utah {{began its}} next {{possession}} with two quick completions of 11 yards {{to move the}} drive to the Midshipmen 49-yard line. Johnson continued to move the ball, picking up yardage {{through the air and}} on the ground. As Utah reached Navy territory, however, the Midshipmen's defense stiffened. Inside the 10-yard line, Utah had three tries to cross the goal line and earn a touchdown. On the third play inside the ten, Utah wide receiver Jereme Brooks caught a pass from Brian Johnson. As he extended the ball toward the goal line, he was hit by Navy cornerback Ketric Buffin. Brooks lost control of the ball, which came out of his hands, hitting the pylon {{at the corner of the}} end zone. According to NCAA rules, the pylon was both out of bounds and in the end zone. Therefore, the fumble should have been considered a touchback, with Navy awarded possession at its own 20-yard line. Instead, officials ruled that Brooks had been out of bounds before fumbling and Utah maintained possession. After the game, officials acknowledged the mistake. Utah had <b>one</b> <b>more</b> <b>chance</b> to score, but turned the ball over on downs after failing to cross the goal line on a run from inside the 1-yard line.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} Thomas Pynchon’s indirect critique of utopian posthumanism in 'Bleeding Edge' {{by analyzing the}} deleterious effects that an emerging Internet culture has on the novel’s characters. By seeping into every aspect of their lives, embedding itself in their minds, and becoming a prosthetic consciousness, the Internet has transformed the characters into posthumans and altered their subject positions within a technological global capitalist culture. Contrasting the novel’s take on the posthuman with the posthuman theories of Donna Harraway, N. Katherine Hayles, Robert Pepperell, Rosi Braidotti, David Roden and Seb Franklin, I argue that, while the dominant utopian strain in posthuman theory imagines the advent of posthumanism {{as an opportunity for}} liberation from the sexism, racism, and colonial oppression that are enabled by the positing of the classical humanist subject, Pynchon demonstrates that because the Internet technology that brought about the posthuman condition is controlled by governments and corporations, it has become just <b>one</b> <b>more</b> lost <b>chance</b> at freedom that was converted into an instrument of increased control and surveillance. Reading 'Bleeding Edge' against William Gibson’s prototypical posthuman novel Neuromancer, I also contend that while Gibson, despite challenging the ontological primacy of meatspace over cyberspace, keeps the two realms separate, Pynchon, who borrows Gibson’s terms, shows that cyberspace has already merged with meatspace. As a result, Maxine Tarnow, the protagonist of 'Bleeding Edge', has nowhere to run in her attempt to find a provisional refuge for herself and her family...|$|R
