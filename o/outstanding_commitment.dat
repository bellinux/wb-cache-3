500|$|On 1 March he was {{promoted}} to Generalmajor, and five days later he became the 205th recipient of the Oak Leaves to the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross, in recognition of his <b>outstanding</b> <b>commitment</b> as the commander of the 25th Panzergrenadier Regiment during winter 1942–43. Of modest habits, Mickl had rarely worn the Knight's Cross itself, usually wearing only the ribbon around his neck, and now he merely added the Oak Leaves device to the ribbon. During his time in the Führerreserve, he also had the opportunity to meet with his mentor Rommel, now a Generalfeldmarschall, and he also attended a course for divisional commanders, which he referred to as a [...] "fool's course". In early May, Mickl was summoned to Berlin and advised that he was to be entrusted with the command of the 11th Panzer Division during the absence of Generalleutnant Dietrich von Choltitz, who had been suffering with heart problems. Despite the good news of being appointed to a divisional command, Mickl expressed his disappointment that he was being allocated a division in need of re-organisation, rather than a fully equipped and full-strength modern division.|$|E

2500|$|Carson {{was inaugurated}} as {{president}} of UNC's student body in April 2007, and her term was due to expire in April 2008.

In this role, Carson served as a member of the university's board of trustees and many other committees, but viewed one of her most important roles as representing all UNC students. Carson was especially vocal about providing students more predictable increases in school tuition and fees, one of her major platform points when running for student body president. Her platform also included ideas to provide additional opportunities open to all students, most notably the establishment of a prestigious scholarship for students in their junior who showed <b>outstanding</b> <b>commitment</b> and service to the university, and the creation of an endowment to fund a big-name speaker series that would be free for all students.|$|E
