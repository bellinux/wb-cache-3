5|$|The hurricane's outer fringes {{produced}} swells {{along the}} Texas coast, and swimmers were advised {{to be cautious}} because <b>of</b> <b>hazardous</b> conditions.

5|$|Cadmium {{occurs as}} a minor {{component}} in most zinc ores and is a byproduct of zinc production. Cadmium was used {{for a long time}} as a corrosion-resistant plating on steel, and cadmium compounds are used as red, orange and yellow pigments, to colour glass, and to stabilize plastic. Cadmium use is generally decreasing because it is toxic (it is specifically listed in the European Restriction <b>of</b> <b>Hazardous</b> Substances) and nickel-cadmium batteries have been replaced with nickel-metal hydride and lithium-ion batteries. One of its few new uses is cadmium telluride solar panels.|$|E
5|$|Colder weather, {{bringing}} with it rain and snow on September 11 calmed the fires down substantially throughout the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Though the fires continued to burn {{well into the}} middle of November, they never again posed an immediate risk to life or property. Many fire crews were sent home, but additional manpower continued to arrive at Yellowstone to rehabilitate areas that had been affected by the firefighting efforts. Hundreds of miles of firelines, helicopter landing zones and fire camps needed to be restored to a more natural state, and thousands <b>of</b> <b>hazardous</b> dead trees needed to be cut down to protect roads and buildings. Finally, on November 18, all fires in Yellowstone were officially declared out.|$|E

5|$|In Odile's {{developmental}} stage, {{its heavy}} rainfall and storm surge inflicted minor coastal damage across southwestern Mexico and three deaths in Oaxaca and Jalisco. The most significant storm impacts {{occurred on the}} Baja California Peninsula, where damages amounted to approximately MXN$16.6billion (US$1.22billion). Power outages spurred by Odile's intense winds and rain cut electricity to 92%of the population of Baja California Sur. Severe flooding also occurred, causing rivers to swell and the mass evacuation of people out <b>of</b> <b>hazardous</b> low-lying areas. The remnants of Odile brought rains and unseasonably powerful thunderstorms to the southwestern United States. In total, Odile led {{to the deaths of}} 18people throughout its nine-day existence.|$|E
5|$|The {{demolition}} {{contract for}} the station was won by London-based company Brown & Mason. Before the demolition of the stations' main structures, it was required that they be decommissioned. This involved the removal <b>of</b> <b>hazardous</b> materials and contaminants, to keep in line with Health & Safety at Work regulations. Oils and chemicals were removed for re-use or disposal and storage tanks were flushed out. Methanol was removed from hydrogen production plants on site, along with bottled propane used for welding. The remaining coal in the coal storage area was dispatched to operating power stations {{in other parts of}} the country. The landfill site where ash waste from the station was dumped was topsoiled. Asbestos used in the stations was removed prior to the demolition of the stations' structures.|$|E
5|$|The {{transport}} <b>of</b> <b>hazardous</b> goods {{through the}} crossing {{is governed by}} the European ADR Agreement. The Dartford Crossing is class C, which restricts transporting goods such as nitrates and flammable liquids. The introduction of the ADR scheme initially caused confusion, and for a short time, transporting aerosols through the tunnel was banned. Certain hazardous goods vehicles, together with some oversize and abnormal loads (if permitted) may require escorting by Highways Agency Traffic Officers. The crossing authority must hold exercises {{in conjunction with the}} emergency services. In 2006 Exercise Orpheus was held, involving the closure of both road tunnels for five hours.|$|E

Cylinders manufactured to DOT standards or special permits (exemptions)issued by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration and filled to the authorized working pressure are legal for commercial transport in the USA under the provisions and conditions of the regulations. Cylinders manufactured outside the USA may be transported under a special permit, and these have been issued for solid metal and composite cylinders with working pressures of up to 300 bar (4400psi) by several manufacturers.|$|E
5|$|A {{state of}} {{emergency}} was declared for Aklan, where property damage equated to ₱51million (US$1million). The Central Visayas region of the Philippines suffered the worst impacts, with a damage cost of ₱345.2million (US$7million), primarily to agriculture. Following the storm's passage, chapters of the Philippine Red Cross assisted in relief efforts in impacted areas. The Philippine Department of Social Welfare and Development allocated ₱27.7million (US$600,000) to relief efforts. Food and sheltering were provided to 2,615people in three provinces by the Adventist Development and Relief Agency. Many localized relief agencies donated sacks of rice to impacted residents. The United Nations appealed for US$46million for use in recovery efforts following Utor {{in addition to the}} three Philippine typhoons which preceded it. Overall, the impacts of Utor killed 30people and injured 44in the Philippines. Another eight people were never accounted for. The damage toll wrought by Utor amounted to US$15.8million. Furthermore, 36,542houses were damaged by Utor, of which 9,439were destroyed. Capiz and Aklan were the areas that sustained the most residential damage. People who were evacuated out <b>of</b> <b>hazardous</b> regions in advance of Utor were able to return home beginning on December18, nine days after initial landfall.|$|E
