500|$|Upon {{graduating in}} September 1785, Bonaparte was {{commissioned}} a second lieutenant in La Fère artillery regiment. He served in Valence and Auxonne {{until after the}} outbreak of the Revolution in 1789, and took nearly two years' leave in Corsica and Paris during this period. At this time, he was a fervent Corsican nationalist, and wrote to Corsican leader Pasquale Paoli in May 1789, [...] "As the nation was perishing I was born. Thirty thousand Frenchmen were vomited <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> shores, drowning the throne of liberty in waves of blood. Such was the odious sight which was the first to strike me".|$|E
500|$|Reactions {{to the red}} culture {{movement}} were divided. Bo’s {{revival of}} Mao-era culture and accompanying social welfare programs were popular within certain segments of society, and made Bo popular with both Marxists and neo-leftists. One student quoted in The Washington Post embraced the ethos of the campaign, saying, [...] "When I sing red songs, I find a kind of spirit I never felt when singing modern songs…To surround yourself with material stuff is just a waste of time." [...] A group of retired participants in a red song routine told the Los Angeles Times [...] "We know these songs from our youth. We grew up with revolutionary spirit {{and we want to}} pass that <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> children.” Another noted that he felt compelled to participate in order to express appreciation to the Communist Party for the country’s strong economy.|$|E

It {{has been seen}} as a transitional work, with Brown commenting in 2005 that [...] "a lot of people have cited it as a classic Autechre album because it bridges the gap between the guys who liked our old stuff and the guys who got propelled <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> new stuff." ...|$|E
2500|$|Taylor {{said that}} Lucas, who was {{consumed}} by {{the details of the}} complicated production, [...] "avoided all meetings and contact with me from day one, so I read the extra-long script many times and made my own decisions as to how I would shoot the picture." [...] He also [...] "took it upon myself to experiment with photographing the lightsabers and other things onstage before we moved <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> two weeks of location work in Tunisia". Taylor was aware of the [...] "enormous amount of process work" [...] to follow principal photography and believed [...] "a crisp result would help".|$|E
2500|$|... {{the idea}} of a future strong united {{independent}} Arab State... too seriously... the conditions of Arabia do not and will not {{for a very long time}} to come, lend themselves to such a thing... I do not for one moment go to the length of imagining that the present negotiations will go far to shape the future form of Arabia or to either establish our rights or to bind our hands in that country. The situation and its elements are much too nebulous for that. What we have to arrive at now is to tempt the Arab people into the right path, detach them from the enemy and bring them <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> side. This on our part is at present largely a matter of words, and to succeed we must use persuasive terms and abstain from academic haggling over conditions – whether about Baghdad or elsewhere.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1997/98 {{series against}} Australia, Srinath's with one {{particular}} delivery measured at 149.6km/h. [...] The Zimbabwe captain Alistair Campbell revealed that Srinath was recorded at 157km/hr on 27 January 1997 {{in the game}} at Paarl between India and Zimbabwe. He said about this game: [...] "We then moved <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> second game against India, at Boland Bank Park. In all 236 was quite a decent score, as it wasn't the easiest of pitches to bat on, and Srinath I think bowled the quickest that any of our guys had ever seen. He bowled a really quick spell early on, even quicker than Allan Donald; he was timed at 157 km/h, a good 10 km/h faster than Donald was bowling throughout the tournament. Grant Flower was hit on the thigh pad, {{and when he came}} off he said he thought he had broken his leg". (See paragraph 7 of the article by clicking on the below link).|$|E
2500|$|Haussmann's {{renovation}} of Paris had many critics during his own time. [...] Some were simply {{tired of the}} continuous construction. [...] The French historian Léon Halévy wrote in 1867, [...] "the work of Monsieur Haussmann is incomparable. [...] Everyone agrees. Paris is a marvel, and M. Haussmann has done in fifteen years what a century could not have done. But that's enough for the moment. There will be a 20th century. Let's leave something for them to do." [...] Others regretted that he had destroyed a historic part of the city. The brothers Goncourt condemned the avenues that cut at right angles {{through the center of}} the old city, [...] where [...] "one could no longer feel in the world of Balzac." [...] Jules Ferry, the most vocal critic of Haussmann in the French parliament, wrote: [...] "We weep with our eyes full of tears for the old Paris, the Paris of Voltaire, of Desmoulins, the Paris of 1830 and 1848, [...] when we see the grand and intolerable new buildings, the costly confusion, the triumphant vulgarity, the awful materialism, that we are going to pass <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> descendants." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the 2012 {{presidential primary}} campaign, {{when asked what}} the federal government’s role should be in {{responding}} to natural disasters, Romney suggested that responsibility for handling disasters should be taken from FEMA, the federal agency dedicated to disaster relief, and given to the states, or outsourced to the private sector: [...] "Every time you have an occasion to take something {{from the federal government}} and send it back to the states, that's the right direction. And if you can go even further, and send it back to the private sector, that's even better. Instead of thinking in the federal budget, what we should cut -- we should ask ourselves the opposite question. What should we keep? We should take all of what we're doing at the federal level and say, what are the things we're doing that we don't have to do? And those things we've got to stop doing, because we're borrowing $1.6 trillion more this year than we're taking in." [...] Asked whether by that he specifically meant disaster relief, he replied, “we cannot afford to do those things without jeopardizing the future for our kids. It is simply immoral, in my view, for us to continue to rack up larger and larger debts and pass them <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> kids, knowing full well that we'll all be dead and gone before it's paid off. It makes no sense at all.” ...|$|E
