40|$|The Federal Reserve {{implements}} its {{monetary policy}} by using {{open market operations}} in U. S. government securities to target the federal funds rate. A substantial decline in the stock of U. S. Treasury debt could interfere with the conduct of monetary policy, possibly forcing the Fed to rely more heavily on discount window lending or to conduct open market transactions in other types of securities. Either would cause the implementation of monetary policy to resemble the methods used by the Fed before World War II. This paper describes two things: (i) how the Fed implemented monetary policy before the war and (ii) the conflicts that arose within the Fed over the allocation of private-sector credit when discount window loans and Fed purchases of private securities were a substantial component of Federal Reserve credit. Those conflicts help explain the Fed’s failure to respond vigorously to the Great Depression. The experience suggests that a renewed reliance on the discount window or on open market <b>operations</b> <b>in</b> <b>securities</b> other than those issued by the U. S. Treasury could hamper the conduct of monetary policy if it leads to increased pressure on the Fed to affect the allocation of credit.

40|$|This article explores NATO’s support {{mission to}} the African Union’s {{peacekeeping}} <b>operation</b> <b>in</b> Darfur, Sudan between 2005 and 2007. NATO policies are commonly presented as functional responses to events, but how did a conflict on the African continent become the Atlantic Alliance’s business? In this essay, a poststructuralist practice-oriented approach is used to understand {{the way in which}} discursive practices progressively establish a policy option as ‘natural’ in a given situation. It is argued that the normalization of NATO’s support {{mission to the}} African Union in Darfur and the integration of this <b>operation</b> <b>in</b> NATO’s <b>security</b> identity were the result of complex and conflict-ridden social interactions between different discursive practices supported by different actors.

50|$|PDEx began trading <b>operations</b> <b>in</b> Government <b>Securities</b> <b>in</b> March 2005, with a Negotiated Dealing System for the Inter-Dealer Market. The {{system was}} {{enhanced}} {{with the introduction}} of Straight-Through-Processing (STP) in September 2006. The STP facility generates settlement instructions from trades in the centralized transaction data base in the Trading System and publishes them into a secure website for the Operations Personnel of Trading Participants to reconcile and authorize. Once authorized, the settlement instructions are sent through to the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr), which operates the Delivery-versus-Payment Service for Government Securities with the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP, the Philippine Central bank). The facility eliminates the need for the Operations Personnel to re-enter trade-related settlement instructions into a separate system.|$|R

40|$|What {{would happen}} if the Federal Reserve were to change the assets in its portfolio? Suppose that instead of using open-market <b>operations</b> <b>in</b> Treasury <b>securities</b> to {{increase}} the monetary base, the Fed were to engage <b>in</b> open-market <b>operations</b> <b>in</b> private <b>securities</b> or to use discount loans via a mechanism that allowed banks to borrow as much as they would like at a fixed discount rate. The analysis in this paper shows the impact on the economy in a static general-equilibrium model. This model follows Santomero (1983), adapted to evaluate a change in the Fed's portfolio and how that affects the economy's general equilibrium at a point in time. The nature of the exercise done here is completely static in nature and does not evaluate the economy's response to a disappearance of government debt, analysis of which would require a more complete model that's dynamic in nature and incorporates real effects. The present model focuses on the more narrow issue of the direction of portfolio changes with no real-side economic effects. But the model is general equilibrium in nature and thus performs a reasonable comparative-static exercise. In what follows, the author first describes the model in Section I. Next, the author models {{a situation in which the}} Fed changes its portfolio in such a way as to keep the interest rate on deposits from changing (Section II). Section III generates results under a special set of assumptions that lock most interest rates together. Section IV attempts to generalize the results to a situation in which the monetary base is unchanged. Section V summarizes the results. ...|$|R

Our previously proposed see-through vision {{is a system that}} provides benefit for ordinary people who might be subjects of surveillance cameras. It enables people to see-through obstacles and watch places behind them. Since the see-through vision is a powerful tool that may violate privacy of other people, we then need a good solution that can make a good balance between the benefit and the privacy. In this paper, we propose privacy-safe see-through vision. Technically, we utilize a marker-based camera tracking for achieving the see-through vision which makes our system more reliable and easy set-up. We have demonstrated the system in a shopping mall in Kyoto. Comments from ordinary visitors indicate the system serves as what it is intended to be...|$|R

40|$|We {{analyze the}} ability of {{earnings}} and non-earnings performance metrics to explain stock returns for industries where we identify, ex ante, an allegedly preferred (for valuation purposes) performance metric. We identify three industries each where earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and cash from operations are preferred, and three industries where specific non-GAAP performance metrics are preferred. As a benchmark, we also examine {{the ability of}} EBITDA and cash from operations to explain returns for seven industries for which earnings is the preferred metric. Results for the benchmark earnings industries show that earnings dominates EBITDA and cash from <b>operations</b> <b>in</b> explaining <b>security</b> returns.
