5|$|A true <b>ocean</b> <b>basin</b> {{developed}} to the west, breaking all the earlier formations along a steep front. A wedge of clastic sediment {{then began to}} accumulate {{at the base of}} the two underwater precipices, starting the formation of opposing continental shelves. Three formations developed from sediment that accumulated on the wedge. The region's first known fossils of complex life are found in the resulting formations. Notable among these are the Ediacara fauna and trilobites, the evolution of the latter being part of the Cambrian Explosion of life.|$|E
5|$|As the {{incipient}} ocean widened in the Late Proterozoic and Early Paleozoic, {{it broke}} the continental crust {{in two and}} a true <b>ocean</b> <b>basin</b> developed to the west. All the earlier formations were thus dissected along a steep front on {{the two halves of}} the previous continent. A wedge of clastic sediment then started to accumulate {{at the base of the}} two underwater precipices, starting the formation of opposing continental shelves.|$|E
50|$|Older {{references}} (e.g., Littlehales 1930) {{consider the}} oceanic basins {{to be the}} complement to the continents, with erosion dominating the latter, and the sediments so derived ending up in the <b>ocean</b> <b>basins.</b> More modern sources (e.g., Floyd 1991) regard the <b>ocean</b> <b>basins</b> more as basaltic plains, than as sedimentary depositories, since most sedimentation occurs on the continental shelves {{and not in the}} geologically-defined <b>ocean</b> <b>basins.</b>|$|R
30|$|Ocean swells are wind-waves {{generated}} by intense storms that journeys long distances as they propagate {{away from their}} generation zone. Unlike the Northern Hemisphere (Northern Atlantic and Pacific Ocean) where land masses provide a barrier which hinders the connection to other <b>ocean</b> <b>basins,</b> the Southern Hemisphere {{is open to the}} propagation of southern swell towards all <b>ocean</b> <b>basins</b> {{due to the fact that}} a circumpolar oceanic zone free of land barriers connects them together [25]. The wide connection existing among southern <b>ocean</b> <b>basins</b> permits extratropical south Indian Ocean swells originating from extratropical systems from adjacent extratropical areas to freely penetrate adjacent <b>ocean</b> <b>basins.</b> Storms within the extratropical south Atlantic, Indian and Pacific oceans generally propagate towards the east, below 40 ^∘S, with maximum storm densities occurring on the western flanks of these <b>ocean</b> <b>basins</b> near 50 ^∘S [25].|$|R
50|$|The {{depth of}} the <b>ocean</b> <b>basins</b> is a {{function}} of the age of oceanic lithosphere (the tectonic plates beneath the floors of the world's oceans). As older plates age, they become denser and sink, allowing newer plates to rise and take their place. Therefore, a configuration with many small oceanic plates that rapidly recycle the oceanic lithosphere would produce shallower <b>ocean</b> <b>basins</b> and (all other things being equal) higher sea levels. A configuration with fewer plates and more cold, dense oceanic lithosphere, on the other hand, would result in deeper <b>ocean</b> <b>basins</b> and lower sea levels.|$|R
5|$|The South Pacific <b>Ocean</b> <b>basin</b> runs between 160°E and 120°W, with {{tropical}} cyclones {{developing in}} it officially {{monitored by the}} Fiji Meteorological Service and New Zealand's MetService. Tropical Cyclones that develop within this basin generally affect countries {{to the west of}} the dateline, though during El Niños cyclones have been known to develop to the east of the dateline near French Polynesia. On average the basin sees nine tropical cyclones annually with about half of them becoming severe tropical cyclones.|$|E
5|$|The South-West Indian <b>Ocean</b> <b>basin</b> {{consists}} of {{the portion of the}} Indian Ocean west of 90°E and south of the Equator. Tropical cyclone activity was monitored by Météo-France office in Réunion, the Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre for the basin. The basin is also unofficially monitored by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center, which uses one-minute sustained winds to estimate wind speeds within systems, while Météo-France uses ten-minute sustained winds and its own intensity scale.|$|E
5|$|The 1994–95 South Pacific cyclone {{season was}} one of the least active South Pacific {{tropical}} cyclone season's on record, with only two tropical cyclones officially occurring within the South Pacific <b>Ocean</b> <b>basin</b> between 160°E and 120°W. The season ran from November 1, 1994, until April 30, 1995, with the first disturbance of the season developing on November 12 and the last disturbance dissipating on March 17. The most intense tropical cyclone during the season was Tropical Cyclone William, which affected the Cook Islands. After the season the name William was retired from the tropical cyclone naming lists.|$|E

5|$|The 2001 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season {{was a fairly}} active Atlantic {{hurricane season}} that produced 17 tropical cyclones, 15 named storms, nine hurricanes, and four major hurricanes. The season officially lasted from June 1, 2001, to November 30, 2001, dates which by convention limit the period of each year when tropical cyclones tend to form in the Atlantic <b>Ocean</b> <b>basin.</b> The season began with Tropical Storm Allison on June 4, and ended with Hurricane Olga, which dissipated on December 6. The most intense storm was Hurricane Michelle, which attained Category 4 strength on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale.|$|E
5|$|Marine {{deposition}} occurred 1200 to 800 Ma, creating thick {{sequences of}} conglomerate, mudstone, and carbonate rock topped by stromatolites, and possibly glacial deposits from the hypothesized Snowball Earth event. Rifting thinned huge roughly linear {{parts of the}} supercontinent Rodinia enough to allow sea water to invade and divide its landmass into component continents separated by narrow straits. A passive margin developed {{on the edges of}} these new seas in the Death Valley region. Carbonate banks formed on this part of the two margins only to be subsided as the continental crust thinned until it broke, giving birth to a new <b>ocean</b> <b>basin.</b> An accretion wedge of clastic sediment then started to accumulate {{at the base of the}} submerged precipice, entombing the region's first known fossils of complex life. These sandy mudflats gave way about 550 Ma to a carbonate platform which lasted for the next 300 million years of Paleozoic time.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Julio was a {{tropical}} storm that made landfall on {{the southern tip of}} Baja California Sur in August 2008. The tenth named storm of the 2008 Pacific hurricane season, it developed from {{a tropical}} wave on August 23 off the coast of Mexico. It moved parallel to the coast, reaching peak winds of 50mph (85km/h) before moving ashore and weakening. On August 26 it dissipated in the Gulf of California. Julio was the third tropical cyclone to make landfall in the Pacific <b>Ocean</b> <b>basin</b> during the season, after Tropical Storm Alma, which struck Nicaragua in May, and Tropical Depression Five-E, which moved ashore along southwestern Mexico in July. The storm brought locally heavy rainfall to southern Baja California, killing one person and leaving several towns isolated. Moisture from Julio reached Arizona, producing thunderstorms, including one which damaged ten small planes in Chandler.|$|E
40|$|By using {{accepted}} crustal density distributions {{and either}} error function or linear temperature distributions {{the difference in}} geoid height between stable continental areas and deep <b>ocean</b> <b>basins</b> has been determined {{as a function of}} the continental lithospheric thickness. If the continental lithosphere were greater than 200 km thick, the geoid anomaly over the continents would be systematically negative in relation to that over the <b>ocean</b> <b>basins.</b> By using the GEM 9 satellite geoid the mean geoid anomalies over <b>ocean</b> <b>basins</b> and stable continental areas have been obtained. No systematic difference between continental and oceanic geoids is observed. It is concluded that the thickness of the continental lithosphere is near 180 km. This is in good agreement with various interpretations of the surface heat flow observations...|$|R

It drifted westward over the subsequent days, and on October15, while located over the South China Sea, the disturbance was classified as a tropical depression. Late the following day, the system was briefly upgraded into a tropical storm, but the storm dissipated quickly after making landfall in Vietnam early on October17. After trekking across Indochina, the remnants of Kim moved into the Andaman Sea and re-developed into a tropical cyclone on October19. However, Kim dissipated for good the next day while located inland over Burma.|$|E

25|$|Divergent {{boundaries}} (Constructive) occur {{where two}} plates slide apart from each other. At zones of ocean-to-ocean rifting, divergent boundaries form by seafloor spreading, {{allowing for the}} formation of new <b>ocean</b> <b>basin.</b> As the ocean plate splits, the ridge forms at the spreading center, the <b>ocean</b> <b>basin</b> expands, and finally, the plate area increases causing many small volcanoes and/or shallow earthquakes. At zones of continent-to-continent rifting, divergent boundaries may cause new <b>ocean</b> <b>basin</b> to form as the continent splits, spreads, the central rift collapses, and ocean fills the basin. Active zones of Mid-ocean ridges (e.g., Mid-Atlantic Ridge and East Pacific Rise), and continent-to-continent rifting (such as Africa's East African Rift and Valley, Red Sea) are examples of divergent boundaries.|$|E

25|$|It {{is often}} {{stated that the}} thermohaline {{circulation}} is the primary reason that the climate of Western Europe is so temperate. An alternate hypothesis claims that this is largely incorrect, and that Europe is warm mostly because it lies downwind of an <b>ocean</b> <b>basin,</b> and because atmospheric waves bring warm air north from the subtropics.|$|E
25|$|Ophiolite assemblages in the Alps {{and some}} other collisional {{mountain}} belts are not formed during subduction, but rather represent the thinned margin of the continent that forms during rifting and continental drift.

25|$|Furthermore, the {{occurrence}} of ophiolites throughout Earth history is not constant but rather formed and emplaced at specific intervals. These intervals correspond closely to times of super-continent break-up and dispersal — not because they form at the ridges that separate the drifting continents but because the large <b>ocean</b> <b>basin</b> coexisting with any super-continent must subduct along new subduction zones as rifting progresses.|$|E

25|$|Gravitational sliding {{away from}} mantle doming: According to older theories, {{one of the}} driving {{mechanisms}} of the plates is the existence of large scale asthenosphere/mantle domes which cause the gravitational sliding of lithosphere plates away from them. This gravitational sliding represents a secondary phenomenon of this basically vertically oriented mechanism. This can act on various scales, from the small scale of one island arc up to the larger scale of an entire <b>ocean</b> <b>basin.</b>|$|E

40|$|From {{studies of}} the global heat flow data set, it has been generalized, {{with respect to the}} {{continental}} lithosphere, that there is a negative correlation between heat flow and the lithosphere's tectonic edge, and that the lithosphere's thermal evolution {{is similar to that of}} the <b>ocean</b> <b>basins,</b> resulting in a 'stable geotherm' in both environments. It is presently noted that a regional study perspective for heat flow data leads to doubts concerning the general applicability of either statement. Rao et al. (1982) have demonstrated that the data are not normally distributed, and that it is not possible to establish a negative correlation between heat flow and age in a rigorous statistical fashion. While some sites of stable continental blocks may have a geotherm that is by chance similar to that for old <b>ocean</b> <b>basins,</b> this need not hold true generally, and many stable continental terranes will be characterized by geotherms very different from those for old <b>ocean</b> <b>basins...</b>|$|R
