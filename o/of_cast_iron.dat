5|$|North Parade Bridge {{was built}} almost 100 {{years later in}} 1836 by William Tierney Clark. His {{original}} bridge was made <b>of</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> on stone abutments, with lodges and staircases. This was rebuilt in 1936 completely in stone. Many of the buildings in South Parade are now hotels and restaurants whilst some remain as private residences. The area which Wood envisaged as an area of sunken gardens matching the houses is now a car park.|$|E

5|$|Modern deep frying {{began in}} the 19th century with the growing {{popularity}} <b>of</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron,</b> particularly around the American South {{which led to the}} development of many modern deep-fried dishes. French fries, invented in the late 18th century, became popular in the early 19th century western Europe. Doughnuts were invented in the mid-19th century, with foods such as onion rings, deep-fried turkey, and corn dogs all being invented in the early 20th century. In recent years, the growth of fast food has expanded the reach of deep-fried foods, especially French fries.|$|E

5|$|The {{process is}} {{versatile}} {{and can be}} performed with relatively inexpensive equipment, making it well suited to shop jobs and field work. An operator can become reasonably proficient with a modest amount of training and can achieve mastery with experience. Weld times are rather slow, since the consumable electrodes must be frequently replaced and because slag, the residue from the flux, must be chipped away after welding. Furthermore, the process is generally limited to welding ferrous materials, though special electrodes have made possible the welding <b>of</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron,</b> nickel, aluminum, copper, and other metals.|$|E
5|$|After his {{graduation}} as {{an architect}} in 1878, Gaudí's first work was a set of lampposts for the Plaça Reial, the project for the Girossi newsstands and the Mataró cooperative, which was his first important work. He received the request from the city council of Barcelona in February 1878, when he had graduated but not yet received his degree, which was sent from Madrid on 15 March of the same year. For this commission he designed two types of lampposts: one with six arms, of which two were installed in the Plaça Reial, and another with three, of which two were installed in the Pla del Palau, opposite the Civil Government. The lampposts were inaugurated during the Mercè festivities in 1879. Made <b>of</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> with a marble base, they have a decoration in which the caduceus of Mercury is prominent, symbol of commerce and emblem of Barcelona.|$|E
5|$|Commercially {{available}} iron {{is classified}} based on purity and {{the abundance of}} additives. Pig iron has 3.5–4.5% carbon and contains varying amounts of contaminants such as sulfur, silicon and phosphorus. Pig iron is not a saleable product, but rather an intermediate step in the production <b>of</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> and steel. The reduction of contaminants in pig iron that negatively affect material properties, such as sulfur and phosphorus, yields cast iron containing 2–4% carbon, 1–6% silicon, and small amounts of manganese. Pig iron has a melting point {{in the range of}} 1420–1470K, which is lower than either of its two main components, and makes it the first product to be melted when carbon and iron are heated together. Its mechanical properties vary greatly and depend on the form the carbon takes in the alloy.|$|E

5|$|The {{swing bridge}} {{spanning}} the Esk divides {{the upper and}} lower harbours and joins the east and west sides of the town. Whitby developed as an important bridging point of the River Esk and in 1351 permission was granted for tolls to be taken on the bridge for its maintenance. In 1609 a survey for a new bridge was commissioned while in 1628 it was described as a drawbridge where men raised planks to let vessels pass and tolls were collected. The bridge posts were rebuilt in stone at a cost of £3,000 in 1766. This structure was replaced by a four-arched bridge between 1833 and 1835, one arch made <b>of</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> swivelled to allow vessels to pass. This bridge was replaced between 1908 and 1909 by the current electric swing bridge.|$|E

5|$|A {{blast furnace}} {{converts}} raw iron ore into pig iron, {{which can be}} remelted in a cupola furnace to produce cast iron. The earliest specimens <b>of</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> found in China date to the 5th century BC during the late Spring and Autumn period, yet the oldest discovered blast furnaces date to the 3rd century BCE and the majority date to the period after Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141–87 BCE) established a government monopoly over the iron industry in 117 BCE (most of the discovered iron works sites built before this date were merely foundries which recast iron that had been smelt elsewhere). Iron ore smelted in blast furnaces during the Han was rarely if ever cast directly into permanent molds; instead, the pig iron scraps were remelted in the cupola furnace to make cast iron. Cupola furnaces utilized a cold blast traveling through tuyere pipes from the bottom and over the top where the charge of charcoal and pig iron was introduced. The air traveling through the tuyere pipes thus became a hot blast once it reached {{the bottom of the}} furnace.|$|E
5|$|Being one of {{the tallest}} {{buildings}} in Singapore in the early 20th century, the Great Southern Hotel was an important landmark of Chinatown. Designed by Swan and Maclaren, the architectural style of the Nam Tin Building {{was that of the}} Modern Movement. The building was designed to be strictly functional. The grey-coloured façade of the Great Southern Hotel seemed to consist only of the bare essentials, with ordinary designs like strong horizontal lines with angular arches and simple cornices. The building was fitted with steel frame windows, with metal railings and grills, which were considered fashionable in the 1930s. The loggia on the uppermost floor was a little lighter in colour with the use <b>of</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> balustrades and brackets, and there was extensive use of green glass. The building was {{one of the}} first in Singapore to be built as an integral structure of reinforced concrete slab and beam with infill brick wall.|$|E
5|$|Land mine: Textual {{evidence}} suggests that the first use of a land mine in history was by a Song Dynasty brigadier general known as Lou Qianxia, who used an 'enormous bomb' (huo pao) to kill Mongol soldiers invading Guangxi in 1277. However, the first detailed description of the land mine was given in the Huolongjing text written by Jiao Yu (fl. 14th to early 15th century) and Liu Bowen (1311–1375) during the late Yuan Dynasty (1271–1368) and early Ming Dynasty (1368–1644). Jiao and Liu wrote that land mines were spherical, made <b>of</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron,</b> and their fuses ignited by a mechanism tripped by enemy movement; although Jiao and Liu did not describe this trip mechanism in full detail, a later text of 1606 revealed that enemy movement released a pin that allowed hidden underground weights to fall and spin a chord around an axle that rotated a spinning wheel acting as a flint to spark a train of fuses.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{role of the}} {{chemical}} composition <b>of</b> <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> for mill rolls in tendencies of diffusionless transformations in the matrix was determined. The investigations of {{the chemical}} composition, microstructure and hardness influence on tribological properties <b>of</b> mottled <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> {{is presented in the}} paper. Design/methodology/approach: The research stand is generally used in the tribological tests, and the counter sample of the material also common in such tests. Bearing steel 100 Cr 6, of a hardness of 57 HRC, was applied as a counter sample. The tribological tests were performed at a load of 100 N. Samples for tests were taken from seven mill rolls made by various producers. Mottled <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> had a different chemical composition. Findings: The role of individual alloying elements in a tendency of the diffusionless transformations in the matrix, hardness, wear resistance and friction coefficient <b>of</b> mottled <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> used for the mill rolls was estimated. The hardness increase rather increases the wear resistance <b>of</b> the investigated <b>cast</b> <b>irons.</b> Research limitations/implications: The possibility of designing the chemical composition <b>of</b> mottled <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> {{in such a way as}} to obtain the low tribological wear at retaining, at the same time, the high friction coefficient was found. The relationship between the hardness resulting from the chemical composition and the wear resistance of the investigated mottled <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> was presented. Practical implications: The obtained results can be utilised in designing the chemical compositions <b>of</b> the <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> mill rolls and to obtain materials characterised by the high wear resistance at the assumed friction coefficient. Originality/value: Surprisingly, the increased chromium content seems to decrease the wear resistance <b>of</b> the investigated <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> and the wear resistance of the investigated mottled <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> is rather decreasing when the coefficient of friction increases...|$|R

5|$|Although the {{destructive}} effects of gunpowder were {{described in the}} earlier Tang dynasty by a Daoist alchemist, the earliest-known existent written formulas for gunpowder come from the Wujing Zongyao text of 1044, which described explosive bombs hurled from catapults. The earliest developments of the gun barrel and the projectile-fire cannon were found in late Song China. The first art depiction of the Chinese 'fire lance' (a combination of a temporary-fire flamethrower and gun) was from a Buddhist mural painting of Dunhuang, dated circa 950. These 'fire-lances' were widespread in use by the early 12th century, featuring hollowed bamboo poles as tubes to fire sand particles (to blind and choke), lead pellets, bits of sharp metal and pottery shards, and finally large gunpowder-propelled arrows and rocket weaponry. Eventually, perishable bamboo was replaced with hollow tubes <b>of</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron,</b> and so too did the terminology of this new weapon change, from 'fire-spear' ('huo qiang') to 'fire-tube' ('huo tong'). This ancestor to the gun was complemented by the ancestor to the cannon, what the Chinese referred to since the 13th century as the 'multiple bullets magazine erupter' ('bai zu lian zhu pao'), a tube of bronze or cast iron that was filled with about 100 lead balls. In 1132, at the Siege of De'an, Song Chinese forces used fire lances against the rival Jurchen-led Jin dynasty.|$|E
