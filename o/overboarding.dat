5000|$|Melanie and Max, two {{actors who}} are {{unknown in the}} USA, have ambitious {{expectations}} and {{want to write a}} script for a Hollywood blockbuster. Working for the perfect script in the home of the Swiss actress, Melanie Winiger, she and her school friend, Max Loong, also a Swiss actor, and two friends watch a hit and run from their house, and it is none other than Johnny Depp, obviously dead. What to do with such a well known body ... as to take to their change! Unintentionally taken hashish, sex, at least in their minds, philosophy, <b>overboarding</b> phantasies and talks, a mix of love and little violence and the everyday life behind the scenes of the glittering metropolis, Los Angeles: four immigrants and their friends demonstrate the craziness of the movie business, but also the loving and bizarre people of LA.

40|$|The Canadian Hydrographic Service (CHS). as {{with many}} other organisations {{involved}} in ocean based research, is faced with the requirement to collect water co lumn data profiles {{for a variety of}} reasons. The CHS's specific need is the co l-lection of sound velocity profiles for the day-to-day measurement of the changing water column wh ile operating multi-beam sounders. Increasing pressures to improve the economic efficiency of survey operations {{and the quality of the}} data collected have led to the development of a family of tools to collect near vertical water column profiles from a moving vessel. These systems consist of a comput-er controlled hydraulic (or electric) winch, <b>overboarding</b> system and free fall fish capable of carrying a variety of instrumentat ion. The MVP is capable of collecting profiles at ship speeds up to 12 knots and includes two modes of operation, a repetitive mode with adjustable time delay between casts or manually initiated mode. The control system includes bottom avoidance and real time feedback of free fall f ish depth. Although the CHS 's primary need was for Sound Velocity (SV) profiling, other pay...|$|E
40|$|Master's thesis in Offshore technologyThe {{combination}} of deeper offshore field developments and larger, more complex subsea structures results in new requirements and challenges for installation vessels and related deployment systems. The conventional vertical deployment system, utilizing steel wire as lifting line, {{is struggling to}} meet the industries requirement of installing heavy subsea structures in water depths exceeding 2000 m. The objective of this thesis {{is to find a}} viable solution to the challenges met during deepwater installation of subsea structures, and to possibly reduce the problem of vessel availability faced in the industry today. This thesis considers new installation methods and assesses their applicability for deepwater installation through a state of the art review. A comparison study between a fiber rope deployment system and a conventional steel wire deployment system is conducted. The study cover all main challenges met during deepwater installation, and consider the installation of two different subsea structures. Due to the low self-weight of fiber rope, the fiber rope deployment system is seen as applicable for deepwater installation with smaller vessels. The system is equipped with active heave compensators and constant tension function, making it applicable for <b>overboarding</b> and splash zone lifting. A feasibility study of deepwater installation with a smaller vessel, rigged with an A-frame and a fiber rope deployment system is conducted. Dynamic analysis of splash zone lifting and lowering to seabed operations is performed with the modeling and analysis program ORCAFLEX. A laboratory exercise is performed to verify the ORCAFLEX model. The fiber rope deployment system is found to be a viable substitute for the conventional steel wire system for deepwater purposes. The system solves the problem related to self-weight of steel wire and has a better weather limiting criteria for lowering to seabed operations. Positioning of the lifted object on the seabed is however found to be more challenging when utilizing fiber rope as lifting line. The A-frame vessel rigged with a fiber rope deployment system is found to be applicable for deepwater installation of subsea structures weighing ≤ 70 Te. The installation can be performed {{for a wide range of}} sea-states in deepwater regions, and problems related to vessel availability can possibly be reduced...|$|E
