5|$|In {{the past}} Mérens horses {{were used for}} farm work, {{particularly}} on steep <b>or</b> <b>difficult</b> terrain, as packhorses and for draft work in mining or hauling timber or sledges. Today, following breeding selection towards a slightly taller and livelier type, they are used principally as saddle horses, especially for trekking in mountainous areas; but have also proved successful in carriage driving. Some {{have been used for}} vaulting, dressage, show jumping and three-day eventing.|$|E

5|$|The {{captain of}} a sailing ship seeks a course along which the winds can be {{expected}} to blow in the direction of travel. During the Age of Sail, the pattern of prevailing winds made various points of the globe easy <b>or</b> <b>difficult</b> to access, and therefore had a direct effect on European empire-building and thus on modern political geography. For example, Manila galleons could not sail into the wind at all.|$|E
5|$|The legendary herb {{has entered}} the modern Bulgarian {{vocabulary}} {{as a metaphor for}} a magic key or a panacea in the wider sense. The phrase “to find the razkovniche” („да намериш разковничето“ „da namerish razkovnicheto“) means to find the solution to a certain problem, usually a complex <b>or</b> <b>difficult</b> one. Razkovniche is also the common Bulgarian name for the plant European waterclover (Marsilea quadrifolia) which, in its appearance, has many similarities with the descriptions of the mythical raskovnik. In eastern Serbia, raskovnik also refers to a specific plant used in vernacular medicine, namely Laserpitium siler.|$|E
5|$|The typical {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} in children under five are fever, cough, and fast <b>or</b> <b>difficult</b> breathing. Fever is not very specific, as it occurs in many other common illnesses, may be absent in those with severe disease, malnutrition or in the elderly. In addition, a cough is frequently absent in children less than 2 months old. More severe {{signs and symptoms}} in children may include blue-tinged skin, unwillingness to drink, convulsions, ongoing vomiting, extremes of temperature, or a decreased level of consciousness.|$|E

5|$|A {{factor that}} {{influences}} how easy <b>or</b> <b>difficult</b> a bike {{will be to}} ride is trail, the distance that the front wheel ground contact point trails behind the steering axis ground contact point. The steering axis is the axis about which the entire steering mechanism (fork, handlebars, front wheel, etc.) pivots. In traditional bike designs, with a steering axis tilted back from the vertical, positive trail tends to steer the front wheel into {{the direction of a}} lean, independent of forward speed. This can be simulated by pushing a stationary bike to one side. The front wheel will usually also steer to that side. In a lean, gravity provides this force. The dynamics of a moving bike are more complicated, however, and other factors can contribute to or detract from this effect.|$|E
5|$|The {{study of}} {{vibrations}} in bikes includes its causes, such as engine balance, wheel balance, ground surface, and aerodynamics; its transmission and absorption; {{and its effects}} on the bike, the rider, and safety. An important factor in any vibration analysis is a comparison of the natural frequencies of the system with the possible driving frequencies of the vibration sources. A close match means mechanical resonance that can result in large amplitudes. A challenge in vibration damping is to create compliance in certain directions (vertically) without sacrificing frame rigidity needed for power transmission and handling (torsionally). Another issue with vibration for the bike is the possibility of failure due to material fatigue Effects of vibration on riders include discomfort, loss of efficiency, Hand-Arm Vibration Syndrome, a secondary form Raynaud's disease, and whole body vibration. Vibrating instruments may be inaccurate <b>or</b> <b>difficult</b> to read.|$|E

30|$|Based on {{previous}} research, health literacy was assessed with two questions: (1) “When you get written information at a doctor’s office, {{would you say}} that it is very easy, somewhat easy, somewhat <b>difficult,</b> <b>or</b> very <b>difficult</b> to understand?” and (2) “When you read the instructions on a prescription bottle, {{would you say that}} it is very easy, somewhat easy, somewhat <b>difficult,</b> <b>or</b> very <b>difficult</b> to understand?” (Sentell et al. 2013; Health Research for Action 2009). Respondents could report not getting written information (< 4  % of all respondents) or not using prescription medicine (< 2  % of all respondents). In the full sample, < 1  % of the sample lacked a response to either question. Low health literacy was defined as responding that (1) written information at the doctor’s office is “somewhat” or “very difficult” to understand and/or (2) instructions on a prescription bottle are “somewhat difficult” or “very difficult” to understand.|$|R
