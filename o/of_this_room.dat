5|$|The museum's National Mall {{building}} construction began in mid-1983. The project, which also included the Sackler Gallery for the Smithsonian's Asian art, created 368,000 {{square feet of}} exhibition space {{at a cost of}} $73.2 million, half of which from the federal government. Almost all <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>room</b> was created underground so as not to affect the quadrangle's landmark Smithsonian Institution Building (the Castle), its greenery, or its view. The Smithsonian Castle hides the museum and South Quadrangle from the National Mall, which has contributed to the museum's lower attendance compared with other Mall attractions. The quadrangle project's design architect was Jean-Paul Carlhian of Shepley, Bulfinch, Richardson & Abbott, based on a concept by Junzō Yoshimura. The two new museums had little involvement in the architectural designs, which were drawn in the 1970s prior to their arrival.|$|E
5|$|Thutmose I {{organized}} great {{building projects}} during his reign, including many temples and tombs, but his greatest projects {{were at the}} Temple of Karnak {{under the supervision of}} the architect Ineni. Previous to Thutmose, Karnak probably consisted only of a long road to a central platform, with a number of shrines for the solar bark along the side of the road. Thutmose was the first king to drastically enlarge the temple. Thutmose had the fifth pylon built along the temple's main road, along with a wall to run around the inner sanctuary and two flagpoles to flank the gateway. Outside of this, he built a fourth pylon and another enclosure wall. Between pylons four and five, he had a hypostyle hall constructed, with columns made of cedar wood. This type of structure was common in ancient Egyptian temples, and supposedly represents a papyrus marsh, an Egyptian symbol of creation. Along the edge <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>room</b> he built colossal statues, each one alternating wearing the crown of Upper Egypt and the crown of Lower Egypt. Finally, outside of the fourth pylon, he erected four more flagpoles and two obelisks, although one of them, which now has fallen, was not inscribed until Thutmose III inscribed it about 50 years later. The cedar columns in Thutmose I's hypostyle hall were replaced with stone columns by Thutmose III, however at least the northernmost two were replaced by Thutmose I himself. Hatshepsut also erected two of her own obelisks inside of Thutmose I's hypostyle hall.|$|E

During the early excavations, the walls <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>room</b> were found covered with a coat of stucco painted in panels of different colours.

The presence <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>room</b> before the hall suggests that the original plan included a mandala style courtyard for devotees to gather and wait, an entrance and facade to this courtyard, all of whose ruins are now lost to history. Cave 19 {{is one of the}} caves known for its sculpture. It includes Naga figures with a serpent canopy protecting the Buddha, similar to those found for spiritual icons in the ancient Jain and Hindu traditions. It includes Yaksha dvarapala (guardian) images on the side of its vatayana (arches), flying couples, sitting Buddha, standing Buddhas and evidence that its ceiling was once painted.|$|E

This room is full of classical motifs, presenting a ceiling with animals, figures and chariots, based on a Greek frieze, with painted walls and inlaid parquet floor. Three of the walls have tapestries with royal coats of arms and the last with a fireplace surmounted by mirror, with chairs assembled for the gathered visitors, all accented in red velvet and gold, and two large ornamental vases. Alongside is a small antechamber used so that visitors could wait as their name was presented to the monarchs, before appearing in the throne room.

25|$|Durbar Hall is {{situated}} {{directly under the}} double-dome of the main building. Known as the “Throne Room” before independence, it had two separate thrones for the Viceroy and Vicereine. Presently, a single high chair for the President is kept here under a 2-ton chandelier hanging from a height of 33 m by a 23 m long rope. The flooring of the hall is made of chocolate-coloured Italian marble. The columns in Durbar Hall are made in Delhi Order which combines vertical lines with the motif of a bell. The vertical lines from the column were also used in the frieze around the room, which {{could not have been}} done with one of the traditional Greek orders of columns. The columns are made from yellow Jaisalmer marble, with a thick line running along the centre. It is said that the line thus drawn on the floor perfectly divides the mansion into two equal parts. It houses a 5th century Buddha statue from the Gupta period. This ancient Buddha statue is in a perfect straight line to the Gupta-period Bull placed outside and onto the India Gate at the end of Rajpath. The elevation of Raisina Hills is so much that the top of the India Gate lies at the same level as the feet of the Buddha’s statue placed in the Durbar Hall. The interior <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>room</b> and almost all the rooms of the palace are bare, relying on stonework and shapes to show austerity rather than intricate decoration.|$|E

500|$|The Entrance Hall, {{which is}} in the east range, was remodelled by Leoni. It is {{asymmetrical}} and contains giant pilasters and a screen of three fluted Ionic columns. The doorway to the courtyard has an open pediment. A hinged picture can be swung out from the wall to reveal a squint looking into the Entrance Hall. [...] Also in the Entrance Hall are tapestries which were woven at Mortlake between 1623 and 1636. They were originally in the Leghs' London home in Belgrave Square and were moved to Lyme in 1903. In order to accommodate them, the interior decorator, Amadée Joubert, had to make alterations, including the removal of a tabernacle and cutting out four of the pilasters. To the south of the Entrance Hall is the Library, and to the east is Wyatt's Dining Room, which has a stucco ceiling and a carved overmantel both in a late 17th-century style, as well as a frieze. The decoration <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>room</b> {{is considered to be a}} rare early example of the Wrenaissance style.|$|E
500|$|The hall's {{flight of}} steps {{lead to the}} piano nobile and state rooms. The grandest, the Saloon, is {{situated}} immediately behind the great portico, with its walls lined with patterned red caffoy (a mixture of wool, linen and silk) and a coffered, gilded ceiling. In this room hangs Rubens's Return from Egypt. On his Grand Tour, the Earl acquired a collection of Roman copies of Greek and Roman sculpture which is contained in the extensive Statue Gallery, which runs {{the full length of}} the house north to south. The North Dining Room, a cube room of 27feet (8.2m) contains an Axminster carpet that perfectly mirrors the pattern of the ceiling above. A bust of Aelius Verus, set in a niche in the wall <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>room,</b> was found during the restoration at Nettuno. A classical apse gives the room an almost temple air. The apse in fact, contains concealed access to the labyrinth of corridors and narrow stairs that lead to the distant kitchens and service areas of the house. Each corner of {{the east side of the}} principal block contains a square salon lit by a huge Venetian window, one of them—the Landscape Room—hung with paintings by Claude Lorrain and Gaspar Poussin. All of the major state rooms have symmetrical walls, even where this involves matching real with false doors. The major rooms also have elaborate white and multi-coloured marble fireplaces, most with carvings and sculpture, mainly the work of Thomas Carter, though Joseph Pickford carved the fireplace in the Statue Gallery. [...] Much of the furniture in the state rooms was also designed by William Kent, in a stately classicising baroque manner.|$|E

[...] In the north range, and on the south front, the timber frame has been encased in brick, with timbering applied to its outer surface. [...] Internally the roof trusses have been retained. [...] Its plan is that of a U-shape with its open side facing the west, towards what was the courtyard. [...] The main entrance is in the north range, leading into the Entrance Hall. [...] To the west of this is the Library, and to the east, the Morning Room. [...] The Entrance Hall leads into the longest range, the eastern range, consisting of the Long Hall, at the north end, and the Dining Room. [...] The Long Hall was originally the Great Hall, and was open to the roof, but is now divided into two floors. [...] To the east of the range extend the kitchen and the chapel. [...] The Dining Room leads into a room now known as the Green Room, which is canted ten degrees to the east. [...] This was also originally open to the roof, but was not a great hall. [...] DeFigueiredo and Treuherz are of the opinion that this was originally a larger, separate structure, probably a barn, and incorporated into the main building when the east range was built. [...] Little of the south range remains. [...] It originally contained domestic apartments, which formerly extended to join the now-demolished west range. [...] In the angle between the Dining Room and what remains of the south range is the Drawing Room. [...] The special feature <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>room</b> is a canted bay window on the north side, extending upwards for three storeys.

500|$|Within {{the area}} of the Omarska mining complex that was used for the camp, the camp {{authorities}} generally confined the prisoners in three different buildings: the administration building, where interrogations and killings took place; the crammed hangar building; the [...] "white house", where the inmates were tortured; and on a cement courtyard area between the buildings known as the [...] "pista", an L-shaped strip of concrete land in between, also a scene of torture and mass killings. There was another small building, known as the [...] "red house", where prisoners were sometimes taken in order to be summarily executed.

Chadwick {{utilised}} the ceremonial character of the elegant neo-classical rooms of the upper galleries to house an installation {{made up of a}} number of autonomous artworks. One room was at the centre of the exhibition and took the name of The Oval Court (1984–86), an ovoid platform that lay {{in the middle of the}} space. The platform presents a twelve-part collage of layered blue toned A4 photocopies made directly of the artist’s naked form, dead animals, plants and drapery suspended in an ovoid pool. The work speaks to the still life, evoking vanitas tradition in its subtle depictions of the transience of the things we surround ourselves with. Twelve figures, according to the artist’s notes, represent the [...] "12 gates to paradise", where she achieves [...] "oneness with all living things". Five golden spheres rest atop the platform corresponding to the finger placing’s of a huge hand, alluding to the touch of divine.
