5|$|Elders, queens, and kits must be fed before {{apprentices}} and warriors. Unless {{they have}} permission, apprentices may not eat {{until they have}} hunted to feed the elders. If any warrior or apprentice is sick <b>or</b> <b>injured,</b> they may eat while the elders, queens, and kits are eating.|$|E

5|$|The milk {{is first}} carrot-red {{and becomes a}} maroon colour within 10 to 30minutes. The brittle and pale-yellowish flesh is often infested with maggots. If cut <b>or</b> <b>injured</b> it becomes, as the milk, first carrot-red, then maroon and within hours dirty green. The fruit body smells harsh, fruit-like and first tastes mild, but then {{slightly}} resinous-bitter and nearly spicy or somewhat astringent.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} found in Mexico, where it grows singly or in small groups in clayey soils in {{subtropical}} coffee plantations, and from Colombia and Brazil in South America. The mushroom contains the psychedelic compounds psilocybin and psilocin, and all parts will stain blue or bluish black when handled <b>or</b> <b>injured.</b> P.hoogshagenii is used for divinatory purposes by some indigenous groups in Mexico.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} leisure spots and {{conservation}} areas are available around Sandakan. The Sepilok Orang Utan Sanctuary {{is a place}} where orphaned <b>or</b> <b>injured</b> orangutans are brought to be rehabilitated to return to forest life. Established in 1964, it is one of only four orangutan sanctuaries in the world. Other conservation areas are the Malaysian Turtle Islands where many turtles lay their eggs on the islands. They cover an area of 1,740 hectares which includes the surrounding reefs and seas. The islands are also ideal for swimming, snorkelling and scuba diving.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} {{wave that}} {{had reached the}} Eastern Pacific from Africa was first spotted on July 23. The wave continued westward with little development occurring until August 3, when convection increased. After additional slow organization, the wave was classified as Tropical Depression Seven-E on August 6 near the tip of Baja California. The system did not strengthen much, and development was halted when wind shear destroyed the system on August 8. The depression never came near land and hence no one was killed <b>or</b> <b>injured.</b> Like Tropical Depression Three-E, this cyclone was forecast to reach tropical storm intensity, but it never did.|$|E
5|$|An ultranationalist Mi-24 Hind {{helicopter}} destroys a vital {{bridge and}} traps the joint force. In the ensuing fight, a tanker explodes, {{and many of}} the group are either killed <b>or</b> <b>injured.</b> Zakhaev himself arrives and begins killing wounded soldiers when loyalists in a Mi-28 Havoc suddenly destroy his Mi-24 Hind and join the fray. Distracted, Zakhaev turns to the Loyalist forces at which point Price gives Soap a M1911; the latter kills Zakhaev and his escort. Loyalist forces start tending to the wounded immediately.|$|E

5|$|During the retreat, Montcalm, still mounted, {{was struck}} by either {{canister}} shot from the British artillery or repeated musket fire, suffering injuries to the lower abdomen and thigh. He {{was able to make}} it back into the city, but his wounds were mortal and he died early the next morning. He was buried in a shell crater left in the floor of the Ursuline chapel by a British shell. The battle resulted in similar numbers of casualties {{on both sides of the}} field; the French had 644 men killed <b>or</b> <b>injured,</b> while the British were left with 658 killed or wounded.|$|E
5|$|He {{made his}} maiden Test century against Bangladesh {{and then was}} India's leading scorer in the Test tour of England, helping India to win their first series in England in 21 years. However, Karthik {{suffered}} a form slump in late-2007 and was dropped from the Test team, and since then has only made sporadic international appearances, although he continues to score heavily in domestic cricket. These have come in occasional appearances as a specialist batsman when other players were rested <b>or</b> <b>injured,</b> or as a wicket-keeper when Dhoni was sidelined.|$|E
5|$|In {{front of}} the total failure of the attack, Shlomo Shamir ordered the retreat at 11.30 am. But this {{occurred}} on open ground under a heavy sun and the soldiers had no water. Numerous men were killed <b>or</b> <b>injured</b> by Arab fire. It was only at 2 pm that the first injured men reached the transport they had left in the morning. However, the Arab Legion didn't {{take advantage of this}} victory while, according to Benny Morris, it could easily have performed a counter-attack up to the Israeli headquarters located at Hulda.|$|E

5|$|Many {{members of}} the {{garrison}} tried to sneak aboard Leake's ships to escape the siege. The situation was precarious and was only worsened when a storm damaged many of Leake's ships on 4–5 December. By this time, the garrison was critically short of medicines and supplies. Many were sick <b>or</b> <b>injured</b> and too few remained to carry out repairs to the shell-damaged fortifications. Only 1,300 were healthy enough to man the defences. Their living conditions were increasingly grim; their shoes had worn out and many men wore makeshift sandals made from hay and straw.|$|E
5|$|Once aposematic {{individuals}} reach {{a certain}} threshold population, for whatever reason, the predator learning process would be {{spread out over}} {{a larger number of}} individuals and therefore is less likely to wipe out the trait for warning colouration completely. If the population of aposematic individuals all originated from the same few individuals, the predator learning process would result in a stronger warning signal for surviving kin, resulting in higher inclusive fitness for the dead <b>or</b> <b>injured</b> individuals through kin selection.|$|E
5|$|Registered nurse (RN) – Nurses can be {{involved}} in ambulance work dependent on the jurisdiction, and as with doctors, this is mostly as air-medical rescuers often {{in conjunction with a}} technician or paramedic.

5|$|Some navies operate ocean-going {{hospital}} {{ships to}} lend medical assistance in high casualty situations like wars or natural disasters. These hospital ships fulfill {{the criteria of}} an ambulance (transporting the sick <b>or</b> <b>injured),</b> although the capabilities of a hospital ship are more on par with a Mobile Army Surgical Hospital. In line with the laws of war, these ships can display a prominent Red Cross or Red Crescent to confer protection under the appropriate Geneva convention. However, this designation has not always protected hospital ships from enemy fire.|$|E
5|$|The Grenztruppen {{were closely}} watched {{to ensure that}} they could not take {{advantage}} of their inside knowledge to escape across the border. Patrols, watchtowers and observation posts were always manned by two or three guards at a time. They were not allowed to go out of each other's sight in any circumstances. If a guard attempted to escape, his colleagues were under instructions to shoot him without hesitation or prior warning; 2,500 did escape to the West, 5,500 more were caught and imprisoned for up to five years, and a number were shot and killed <b>or</b> <b>injured</b> in the attempt.|$|E
5|$|The open {{nature of}} the New Forest means that ponies are able to wander onto roads. The ponies {{actually}} have right of way over vehicles and many wear reflective collars {{in an effort to}} reduce traffic fatalities, but despite this, many ponies, along with commoners' cattle, pigs, and donkeys are killed <b>or</b> <b>injured</b> in road traffic accidents every year. Human interaction with ponies is also a problem; well meaning but misguided visitors to the forest frequently feed them, which can create dietary problems and sickness (eg colic) and cause the ponies to adopt an aggressive attitude in order to obtain human food.|$|E
