Since the book does not have a continuous narrative to summarise, the account here will use one species as a running example to illustrate the book's approach.

He also chose the species for the colour frontispiece of the book.|$|E

5|$|Many of Sorabji's {{works are}} {{written for the}} piano or have an {{important}} piano part. His writing for the instrument was influenced by that of composers such as Liszt, Alkan and Godowsky, {{and he has been}} described as a composer-pianist in their tradition, partly because he was one of the 20th century's most prolific piano composers. It exhibits particularly the influence of Godowsky, specifically in its polyphony and its use of polyrhythms and polydynamics. This necessitated the regular use of systems of more than two staves in Sorabji's keyboard parts, reaching its peak <b>on</b> <b>page</b> 124 of the manuscript of his Third Organ Symphony (1949–53), which uses 11 staves, as well as frequent calls for use of the sostenuto pedal.|$|E
5|$|Team Nash versus Team Jarrett {{began on}} the March18 episode of Impact! when Nash {{requested}} a six man tag team cage match at Lockdown from Rhodes. The following week, Rhodes granted the request and officially announced it for the Lockdown card.

Afterwards, members from each team entered at time intervals until all wrestlers {{were involved in the}} bout so a pinfall or submission could occur. The storyline behind this encounter revolved around Jarrett and his reign as NWA World Heavyweight Champion. At Against All Odds, Jarrett successfully defended the title against Nash, which Waltman and The Outlaw interfered with by aiding Nash and Jarrett, respectively. At TNA's previous PPV event Destination X on March13, Jarrett defended the title against Page, in which Brown turned <b>on</b> <b>Page</b> by helping Jarrett retain the title.|$|E
5|$|In the Grolier Codex captives {{are shown}} bound with cords leading to their necks, however {{the most common}} {{convention}} in Mesoamerican art is the depiction of captives bound by the arms or wrists. Some of the figures in the codex represent deities (on pages 1–2, 4–6 and 9) and some represent mortal warriors without supernatural attributes (on pages 3, 7 and 8). Both the deities and the mortals are performing the same actions such as the capture of a prisoner, or conquest symbolised by a spear passing through a temple. Although the codex depicts the stations of Venus, none of the warlike figures is identified with attributes normally associated with the planet in Maya or central Mexican art. <b>On</b> <b>page</b> 9, a bound captive is depicted from a high point of view {{with a sense of}} perspective that French Mesoamericanist and iconographer Claude-François Baudez considers alien to Mesoamerican art. God K (K'awiil) is depicted twice in the codex. However, his attributes are inconsistent with other pre-Columbian depictions, as he is shown with human incisors instead of snake fangs.|$|E

5|$|The {{term was}} first used in a {{scientific}} context by Charles Lyell in the third edition (1851) of his book Elements of Geology in relation to missing parts of the geological column, but it was popularized in its present meaning by its appearance <b>on</b> <b>page</b> xi of his book Geological Evidences of the Antiquity of Man of 1863. By {{that time it was}} generally thought {{that the end of the}} last glacial period marked the first appearance of humanity, but Lyell drew on new findings in his Antiquity of Man to put the origin of human beings much further back in the deep geological past. Lyell wrote that it remained a profound mystery how the huge gulf between man and beast could be bridged. Lyell's vivid writing fired the public imagination, inspiring Jules Verne's Journey to the Center of the Earth (1864) and Louis Figuier's 1867 second edition of La Terre avant le déluge ("Earth before the Flood"), which included dramatic illustrations of savage men and women wearing animal skins and wielding stone axes, in place of the Garden of Eden shown in the 1863 edition.|$|E
