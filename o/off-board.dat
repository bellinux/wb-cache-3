This stage, the last one of the ELC, spans from the moment an employee becomes disengaged until his or her departure from the organization. This is the key time that an {{exit interview}} should be administered because the employee’s feelings regarding his or her departure are fresh in mind. An <b>off-boarding</b> process allows both the employer and employee to properly close the existing relationship so that company materials are collected, administrative forms are completed, knowledge base and projects are transferred or documented, feedback and insights are gathered through exit interviews, and any loose ends are resolved.|$|R
40|$|As a {{consequence}} of an aging workforce, electric utilities {{are at risk of}} losing their most experienced and knowledgeable electrical engineers. In this research, the problem was a lack of understanding of what electric utilities were doing to capture the tacit knowledge or know-how of these engineers. The purpose of this qualitative research study was to explore the tacit knowledge capture strategies currently used in the industry by conducting a case study of 7 U. S. electrical utilities that have demonstrated an industry commitment to improving operational standards. The research question addressed the implemented strategies to capture the tacit knowledge of retiring electrical engineers and technical personnel. The research methodology involved a qualitative embedded case study. The theories used in this study included knowledge creation theory, resource-based theory, and organizational learning theory. Data were collected through one time interviews of a senior electrical engineer or technician within each utility and a workforce planning or training professional within 2 of the 7 utilities. The analysis included the use of triangulation and content analysis strategies. Ten tacit knowledge capture strategies were identified: (a) formal and informal on-boarding mentorship and apprenticeship programs, (b) formal and informal <b>off-boarding</b> mentorship programs, (c) formal and informal training programs, (d) using lessons learned during training sessions, (e) communities of practice, (f) technology enabled tools, (g) storytelling, (h) exit interviews, (i) rehiring of retirees as consultants, and (j) knowledge risk assessments. This research contributes to social change by offering strategies to capture the know-how needed to ensure operational continuity in the delivery of safe, reliable, and sustainable power...|$|R

25|$|In rebreather diving, bailout to {{open circuit}} is a {{procedure}} where the diver switches from breathing from the rebreather loop to open circuit. This is done when the loop is compromised for any reason, {{and is often}} done temporarily when there is some doubt that the gas in the loop is right for the depth. Bailout to open circuit may be a local switch-over at the bailout valve (BOV) to breathe gas directly from the diluent cylinder, or may be a switch to <b>off-board</b> gas, which is carried in an independent cylinder and is directly equivalent to open circuit bailout. This may be done through an <b>off-board</b> supply connected to the BOV or through a regular fully independent bailout set carried for the purpose. Both options may be available on deep dives with long decompression obligations. Occasionally rebreather divers will carry a bailout rebreather, {{when it is not}} practical to carry the required gas volume for open circuit bailout.|$|E
25|$|The Independence-class ships {{also have}} an {{integrated}} LOS Mast, Sea Giraffe 3D Radar and SeaStar Safire FLIR.

25|$|Bus lanes have {{generally}} increased average bus speeds and reduced travel times {{where they are}} installed. For instance, after bus lanes were installed along East 125th Street in East Harlem in 2014, the average speeds of the M60 Select Bus Service route along that segment increased 32% to 34%, and the average speeds of the M100 and Bx15 local buses increased 7% to 20%. By contrast, along West 125th Street where bus lanes were not initially installed, there was no marked increase in local bus speeds. The speeds of M60 SBS buses increased 27% to 36%, but only {{as a result of}} other improvements such as <b>off-board</b> fare payment and fewer stops. Another corridor, Fordham Road in the Bronx, saw a 14% to 24% increase in average bus speeds on the Bx12 route after bus lanes were installed.|$|E
25|$|The S79 SBS route {{began on}} September 2, 2012. While the routing was left mostly intact, the S79 had all local service {{eliminated}} {{and replaced by}} local service on the S59 route along Richmond Avenue and the S78 route along Hylan Boulevard. The route was also straightened through New Springville to bypass the Yukon Bus Depot. This route uses rigid 40-foot Orion VII hybrid-electric diesel buses, {{and is the only}} SBS line that does not utilize <b>off-board</b> fare collection. Additionally, it was the only SBS line in the 5 boroughs that did not use 60-foot articulated buses before the B46 SBS was introduced as well as the only SBS line to not have blue destination signs until July 2017. Riders must pay the fare on board, as they do on local, limited-stop, and express buses. The S79 Select Bus Service is based out of the Yukon Bus Depot.|$|E
25|$|The IIR sensor has a stabilised mount {{so that it}} can {{maintain}} a target within its field of view. Up to 200 targets can be simultaneously tracked using one of several different modes; Multiple Target Track (MTT), Single Target Track (STT), Single Target Track Ident (STTI), Sector Acquisition and Slaved Acquisition. In MTT mode the system will scan a designated volume space looking for potential targets. In STT mode PIRATE will provide high precision tracking of a single designated target. An addition to this mode, STT Ident allows for visual identification of the target, the resolution being superior to CAPTOR's. Both Sector and Slave Acquisition demonstrate the level of sensor fusion present in the Typhoon. When in Sector Acquisition mode PIRATE will scan a volume of space under direction of another onboard sensor such as CAPTOR. In Slave Acquisition, <b>off-board</b> sensors are used with PIRATE being commanded by data obtained from an AWACS for example. When a target is found in either of these modes, PIRATE will automatically designate it and switch to STT.|$|E

Although the Q70 was intended as a bus rapid transit project, it had yet to be branded as Select Bus Service and did not employ most SBS elements, as it lacked ticket machines, all-door boarding, branded buses, and dedicated bus lanes. The Q70 SBS was implemented on September 25, 2016, when it was rebranded as the [...] "LaGuardia Link" [...] with the implementation of <b>off-board</b> payment of fares. As opposed to other SBS routes, the Q70 is wrapped in a light blue scheme with clouds and airplanes on {{the top half of the}} bus imposed with the standard SBS livery on the lower half.

A Metroway fare costs the same as Metrobus, which is $2.00 (using cash & SmarTrip).|$|E
2500|$|In 2011, the U.S. Missile Defense Agency (MDA) {{reported}} {{its interest}} {{in using the}} Reaper and its MTS-B sensor to provide firing quality data for early interception of ballistic missile launches. The MDA is exploring concepts to use the UAV's EO/IR sensor to achieve [...] "launch-on-remote" [...] capabilities with missile interceptors before detection by Aegis radars. [...] At least two aircraft {{would be needed to}} triangulate a target to provide high-fidelity data. The MTS-B includes short and mid-wave IR bands, optimal for tracking launch and rocket burn. In 2013, the MDA terminated plans to build a follow-on to the two orbiting Space Tracking and Surveillance System (STSS) satellites due to near-term costs, opting to continue testing the Reaper for ballistic missile target discrimination. The MDA planned to test the improved MTS-C sensor, which adds a long-wave IR detector optimized for tracking cold bodies such as missiles and warheads after booster burnout, or plumes and exhaust. The goal is to use data from multiple high-flying UAVs to provide an <b>off-board</b> cue to launch an SM-3 missile from an Aegis ship. Two Reapers demonstrated their ability to track ballistic missiles using their MTS-B EO/IR turret during a test in late June 2016.|$|E
2500|$|In late 2014, the Navy began early {{preparation}} {{work on the}} SSN(X). It was planned that the first submarine would be procured in 2025. However, their introduction (i.e., procurement of the first submarine) has been pushed back to 2033/2034. [...] The long-range shipbuilding plan is for the new SSN to be authorized in 2034, and become operational by 2044 after the last Block VII Virginia is built. Roughly a decade will be spent identifying, designing, and demonstrating new technologies before an analysis of alternatives is issued in 2024. An initial small team has been formed to consult with industry and identify the threat environment and technologies the submarine will need to operate against in the 2050-plus timeframe. One area already identified {{is the need to}} integrate with <b>off-board</b> systems so future Virginia boats and the SSN(X) can employ networked, extremely long-ranged weapons. A torpedo propulsion system concept from the Pennsylvania State University could allow a torpedo to hit a target [...] away and be guided by another asset during the terminal phase. Targeting information might also come from another platform like a patrol aircraft or an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) launched from the submarine. Researchers have identified a quieter advanced propulsion system and the ability to control multiple unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) at once as key SSN(X) components. [...] The future submarines will operate {{through the end of the}} 21st century, and potentially into the 22nd century. New propulsion technology, moving beyond the use of a rotating mechanical device to push the boat through the water, could come in the form a biomimetic propulsion system that would eliminate noise-generating moving parts like the drive shaft and the spinning blades of the propulsor.|$|E
