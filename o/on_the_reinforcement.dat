25|$|The affective {{reactivity}} model {{states that}} {{the strength of a}} person's reactions to affect-relevant events are caused by people's differences in affect. This model is based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>reinforcement</b> sensitivity theory by Jeffrey Alan Gray, which states that people with stronger behavioral activation system (BAS) are high in reward responsiveness and are predisposed to the personality trait of extraversion, while people with a stronger behavioral inhibition system (BIS) are lower in reward responsiveness and are more predisposed to personality trait of neuroticism and introversion. Therefore, extraverts are seen as having a temperamental predisposition to positive affect since positive mood induction has a greater effect on them than on introverts, thus extraverts are more prone to react to pleasant effects. For example, Gable, Reis, and Elliot (2000). found in two consecutive studies that people with more sensitive BIS reported higher levels of average negative affect, while people with more sensitive BAS reported higher levels of positive affect. Also Zelenski and Larsen (1999) found that people with more sensitive BAS reported more positive emotions during the positive mood induction, while people with more sensitive BIS reported more negative emotions during the negative mood induction.|$|E

2500|$|Robert C. Bolles (1970), a {{researcher}} at University of Washington, wanted to understand species-specific defense reactions and avoidance learning among animals, but found that the theories of avoidance learning and the tools {{that were used to}} measure this tendency were {{out of touch with the}} natural world. He theorized the species-specific defense reaction (SSDR). There are three forms of SSDRs: flight, fight (pseudo-aggression), or freeze. Even domesticated animals have SSDRs, and in those moments it is seen that animals revert to atavistic standards and become [...] "wild" [...] again. Dr. Bolles states that responses are often dependent <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>reinforcement</b> of a safety signal, and not the aversive conditioned stimuli. This safety signal can be a source of feedback or even stimulus change. Intrinsic feedback or information coming from within, muscle twitches, increased heart rate, is seen to be more important in SSRDs than extrinsic feedback, stimuli that comes from the external environment. Dr. Bolles found that most creatures have some intrinsic set of fears, to help assure survival of the species. Rats will run away from any shocking event, and pigeons will flap their wings harder when threatened, the wing flapping in pigeons and the scattered running of rats are considered a species-specific defense reaction or behavior. Bolles believed that SSDR are conditioned through pavlovian conditioning, and not operant conditioning; SSDR arise from the association between the environmental stimuli and adverse events. Michael S. Fanselow conducted an experiment, to test some specific defense reactions, he observed that rats in two different shock situations responded differently, based on instinct or defensive topography, rather than contextual information.|$|E
6000|$|On {{the death}} of the father there {{remained}} golden-haired Kirstie, who took service with her distant kinsfolk, the Rutherfords, and black-a-vised Gilbert, twenty years older, who farmed the Cauldstaneslap, married, and begot four sons between 1773 and 1784, and a daughter, like a postscript, in ’97, the year of Camperdown and Cape St. Vincent. It seemed it was a tradition in the family to wind up with a belated girl. In 1804, at the age of sixty, Gilbert met an end that might be called heroic. He was due home from market any time from eight at night till five in the morning, and in any condition from the quarrelsome to the speechless, for he maintained to that age the goodly customs of the Scots farmer. It was known on this occasion that he had a good bit of money to bring home; the word had gone round loosely. The laird had shown his guineas, and if anybody had but noticed it, there was an ill-looking, vagabond crew, the scum of Edinburgh, that drew out of the market long ere it was dusk and took the hill-road by Hermiston, where {{it was not to be}} believed that they had lawful business. One of the country-side, one Dickieson, they took with them to be their guide, and dear he paid for it! Of a sudden in the ford of the Broken Dykes, this vermin clan fell on the laird, six to one, and him three parts asleep, having drunk hard. But it is ill to catch an Elliott. For a while, in the night and the black water that was deep as to his saddle-girths, he wrought with his staff like a smith at his stithy, and great was the sound of oaths and blows. With that the ambuscade was burst, and he rode for home with a pistol-ball in him, three knife wounds, the loss of his front teeth, a broken rib and bridle, and a dying horse. That was a race with death that the laird rode! In the mirk night, with his broken bridle and his head swimming, he dug his spurs to the rowels in the horse’s side, and the horse, that was even worse off than himself, the poor creature! screamed out loud like a person as he went, so that the hills echoed with it, and the folks at Cauldstaneslap got to their feet about the table and looked at each other with white faces. The horse fell dead at the yard gate, the laird won the length of the house and fell there on the threshold. To the son that raised him he gave the bag of money. “Hae,” said he. All the way up the thieves had seemed to him to be at his heels, but now the hallucination left him—he saw them again in the place of the ambuscade—and the thirst of vengeance seized on his dying mind. Raising himself and pointing with an imperious finger into the black night from which he had come, he uttered the single command, “Brocken Dykes,” and fainted. He had never been loved, but he had been feared in honour. At that sight, at that word, gasped out at them from a toothless and bleeding mouth, the old Elliott spirit awoke with a shout in the four sons. “Wanting the hat,” continues my author, Kirstie, whom I but haltingly follow, for she told this tale like one inspired, “wanting guns, for there wasna twa grains o’ pouder in the house, wi’ nae mair weepons than their sticks into their hands, the fower o’ them took the road. Only Hob, and that was the eldest, hunkered at the doorsill where the blood had rin, fyled his hand wi’ it—and haddit it up to Heeven in the way o’ the auld Border aith. ‘Hell shall have her ain again this nicht!’ he raired, and rode forth upon his earrand.” It was three miles to Broken Dykes, down hill, and a sore road. Kirstie has seen men from Edinburgh dismounting there in plain day to lead their horses. But the four brothers rode it as if Auld Hornie were behind and Heaven in front. Come to the ford, and there was Dickieson. By all tales, he was not dead, but breathed and reared upon his elbow, and cried out to them for help. It was at a graceless face that he asked mercy. As soon as Hob saw, by the glint of the lantern, the eyes shining and the whiteness of the teeth in the man’s face, “Damn you!” says he; “ye hae your teeth, hae ye?” and rode his horse to and fro upon that human remnant. Beyond that, Dandie must dismount with the lantern to be their guide; he was the youngest son, scarce twenty at the time. “A’ nicht long they gaed in the wet heath and jennipers, and whaur they gaed they neither knew nor cared, but just followed the bluid stains and the footprints o’ their faither’s murderers.

By eight o’clock they had word of them—a shepherd had seen four men “uncoly mishandled” go by in the last hour. “That’s yin a piece,” says Clem, and swung his cudgel. “Five o’ them!” says Hob. “God’s death, but the faither was a man!

Four sour faces looked <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>reinforcement.</b> “The Deil’s broughten you!” said Clem, and they rode thenceforward in the rear of the party with hanging heads. Before ten they had found and secured the rogues, and by three of the afternoon, as they rode up the Vennel with their prisoners, they were aware of a concourse of people bearing in their midst something that dripped. “For the boady of the saxt,” pursued Kirstie, “wi’ his head smashed like a hazelnit, had been a’ that nicht in the chairge o’ Hermiston Water, and it dunting it on the stanes, and grunding it on the shallows, and flinging the deid thing heels-ower-hurdie at the Fa’s o’ Spango; and in the first o’ the day, Tweed had got a hold o’ him and carried him off like a wind, for it was uncoly swalled, and raced wi’ him, bobbing under brae-sides, and was long playing with the creature in the drumlie lynns under the castle, and at the hinder end of all cuist him up on the starling of Crossmichael brig.

5000|$|The intuitive-experiential {{system is}} a preconscious {{learning}} system that humans likely share with other higher-order animals {{as it is a}} much older evolutionary development. It is fast, automatic, holistic, and intimately associated with affect or emotion. [...] Change occurs within the system through three forms of associative learning: classical conditioning, operant conditioning, and observational learning. Learning often occurs slowly in this system through reinforcement and repetition, but once change has occurred, it is often highly stable and resistant to invalidation. [...] Recent research has identified three reliable facets of intuitive-experiential processing: intuition, emotionality, and imagination. [...] The intuition is most closely associated with the system as a whole, as this factor addresses the experiential system's capability of making associations and affective judgments outside of awareness. [...] Within the intuitive-experiential system, imagining an experience can have cognitive and behavioral effects similar to experience itself. [...] In this way, imagination also plays a primary role in the experiential system, which learns primarily through experience. [...] Emotion is the third sub-factor of the intuitive-experiential system. It may be that emotion is the most fundamental component; without it, the experiential system would not exist at all. [...] Emotional reinforcement is necessary for associative learning to occur. Emotions also affect what experiences are attended to based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>reinforcement</b> history of the experiential system, as well as our motivations to approach or avoid particular experiences. It has also been shown that emotional involvement in experience affects the relative influence of the experiential system.

50|$|Dave Dowle {{started his}} career when he was 13: he joined his first band, Canterbury Glass, playing {{alongside}} future Genesis guitarist Steve Hackett. According to Dave, the band recorded a Radio One session after meeting the late John Peel DJ-ing at a gig. Following Canterbury Glass, Dave worked {{with a variety of}} artists including Doris Troy and PP Arnold before forming a band called Curly who also recorded a John Peel session in November 1973. Steve Farr and Stewart Blandameer from Curly both ended up in the Q-Tips with Paul Young, with Blandameer also working with Status Quo. Dave next worked with Brian Auger's Oblivion Express, touring the US and appearing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Reinforcements</b> album in 1975.|$|R
5000|$|In his history, No Small Achievement: Special Operations Executive and the Danish Resistance 1940-1945 (2002), Knud Jespersen {{examined}} the relationship between British Intelligence and the Danish Resistance. He quoted a report from SHAEF stating that the resistance in Denmark [...] "caused strain and embarrassment to the enemy...a striking reduction in the flow of troops and stores from Norway that undoubtedly had an adverse effect <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>reinforcements</b> for <b>the</b> battles East and West of the Rhine."Examining the British archives, Jespersen also found a report concluding [...] "that the overall effect of Danish resistance was to restore national pride and political unity." [...] He agreed that this was the movement's most important contribution to the nation.|$|R

Two centrifuge model tests were conducted to simulate the excavation of cohesive slopes with and without <b>reinforcement.</b> <b>The</b> tests results showed that the geotextile greatly enhanced the slope stability and <b>the</b> effects of <b>reinforcement</b> mainly emerge in two aspects as follows: (1) to diminish the deformation and to unify deformation distribution; (2) <b>the</b> <b>reinforcement</b> effect was achieved mainly through friction forces...|$|R

40|$|Hybrid {{syntactic}} foams with AlSi 12 aluminum alloymatrix {{were produced}} bylow pressure infiltration and the wear properties were investigated by pin-on-disc method against a {{low carbon steel}} disc counterpart. As reinforcement iron(GM; Ø 1. 9 mm) and two ceramic type(GC; Ø 1. 4 mmandSLG; Ø 0. 12 mm) hollow spheres were used. The volume ratio of GM-GC hollow spheres variedand also SLGþGC hybrid composites were produced. The tests inlubricated condition showed significantly different roperties to the dry tests,due to the different oil reservoir capacity of the open hollow spheres in the contact zone, depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>reinforcement</b> type and ratio. The coefficient of friction, specific wear, height loss and surface damage of the specimens were strongly dependent <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>reinforcement</b> type. ...|$|E
50|$|The {{bridge was}} guarded by 20 heavily armed Greek soldiers, {{supported}} with machine guns. In {{the night of}} 15-16 June, the Turks advanced from Donduran and crossed the Büyük Menderes River with rafts at 02:00 am. During the crossing they {{were divided into two}} groups, each group contained 30 men. When they finally reached the Malgaç bridge, they surrounded it by advancing in the cornfields. Simultaneously, some of <b>the</b> men climbed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> telephone poles and cut off the phone lines to prevent the calling of Greek <b>reinforcements.</b> They attacked <b>the</b> bridge from three sides, surprising the Greek guards and killing all of them. The bridge was destroyed by placing dynamite at the bridge piers. Woken up by the explosion and loud gunfire, Greek soldiers from the nearby headquarter tried to reach for help but they were hold off. After inflicting some casualties <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>reinforcements,</b> <b>the</b> Turkish forces retreated. The attack lasted several hours and the Greek troops had suffered over 20 killed and the Turks had only one wounded.|$|R
