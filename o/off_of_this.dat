500|$|The {{scene that}} {{corresponds}} with [...] "You Can't Win" [...] in The Wiz begins with Dorothy Gale (played by Diana Ross), stumbling upon a scarecrow being heckled by crows while {{stuck in the}} air on a pole. Dorothy remains hidden while the crows mock Scarecrow for asking to be let down. They state that he will remain on the pole because that is his role {{and there is nothing}} to get down for. The crows tell Scarecrow that even if he was let down, {{he would not be able}} to walk as he is a [...] "straw paper dummy". Scarecrow tries to reason with the birds by reading relevant quotations from figures such as Francis Bacon and Cicero as a rationale to be freed. The crows do not relent, however, and make him recite their [...] "Crow Commandments": [...] "Thou shall honor all crows", [...] "Thou shall stop reading all bits of paper and literature" [...] and [...] "Thou shall never, never get down <b>off</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> here pole". In addition, the birds tell Scarecrow to sing the crow anthem, [...] "You Can't Win". After the song concludes, Dorothy comes out of hiding and releases Scarecrow from the pole. Together, they then dance their way down the yellow brick road in search of The Wiz, singing [...] "Ease on Down the Road" [...] as they go.|$|E
500|$|Bret Hart's {{feud with}} Bob Backlund dated {{back to the}} July 30, 1994 episode of WWF Superstars of Wrestling. Backlund {{believed}} that he had won the match and the WWF World Heavyweight Championship by defeating Hart. The match had not ended, however, and Hart pinned Backlund. When Hart tried to shake Backlund's hand after the match, Backlund slapped {{him in the face}} and locked him in a crossface chickenwing. After that Backlund began acting in a completely different manner than he had before, demanding respect from his fellow wrestlers insisting that they call him [...] "Mr. Backlund" [...] and using the crossface chickenwing, a hold he said was unbreakable, on them if they did not adhere to his wishes. He claimed that he had never truly been beaten for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship on December 26, 1983, as the match ended when his manager, Arnold Skaaland, threw a towel into the ring rather than allowing Backlund to submit to The Iron Sheik's camel clutch. Playing <b>off</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> a rematch between Hart and Backlund was signed for Survivor Series. The match was signed as a submission match, but with the stipulation that the only way for a wrestler to win was to have the other person throw in a towel. Since this required a wrestler to have a cornerman, each of the participants chose one. The challenger chose Owen Hart, while the champion went with Davey Boy Smith.|$|E
500|$|The song {{begins with}} a brief {{introduction}} in which Eminem says while the chorus plays underneath, [...] "Yeh, it's been a ride. I guess I {{had to go to}} that place to get to this one." [...] When he begins the first verse, his lyrics threaten people who have looked down on him: [...] "You can try to read my lyrics <b>off</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> paper before I lay 'em/ But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em." [...] On the second verse, Eminem says that he has indeed made mistakes, commenting on his Relapse album: [...] "That last Relapse CD was ehh/ Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground/ Relax, I ain't going to do that now." [...] When he says [...] "All I'm trying to say is get back, click clack, pow", a gunshot is heard. Approaching {{the end of the second}} verse, Eminem raps about his personal experiences: [...] "But I think I'm still trying to figure this crap out/ Thought I had it mapped out, but I guess I didn't/ It's time to exercise these demons/ These motherfuckers are doing jumping jacks now." [...] After the chorus, Eminem sings a bridge and focuses on a positive change, as he says [...] "I just can't keep living this way, so starting today I'm breaking out of this cage." [...] Before the final chorus, he says that he [...] "shoots for the moon". The song features a choir composed of Kip Blackshire, Christal Garrick II, Terry Dexter, Rich King, Kristen Ashley Cole and Sly Jordan.|$|E

2500|$|In {{many parts}} of the world, an {{emergency}} service can identify the telephone number that a call has been placed from. This is normally done using the system that the telephone company uses to bill calls, making the number visible even for users who have unlisted numbers or who block caller ID. For an individual fixed landline telephone, the caller's number can often be associated with the caller's address and therefore their location. However, with mobile phones and business telephones, the address may be a mailing address rather than the caller's location. The latest [...] "enhanced" [...] systems, such as Enhanced 911, are able to provide the address the cell phone tower a mobile telephone is bouncing <b>off</b> <b>of.</b> <b>This</b> is often specifically mandated in a country's legislation.|$|E
2500|$|The first strobe tuner {{dates back}} to 1936 and was {{originally}} made by the Conn company; {{it was called the}} Stroboconn and was produced for approximately 40 years. However, these strobes are now mainly collector pieces. They had 12 strobe discs, driven by one motor. The gearing between discs was a very close approximation to the 12th root of two ratio. This tuner had an electrically driven temperature-compensated tuning fork; the electrical output of this fork was amplified to run the motor. The fork had sliding weights, an adjustment knob, and a dial to show the position of the weights. These weights permitted setting it to different reference frequencies (such as A4 = 435Hz), although over a relatively narrow range, perhaps a whole tone. [...] When set at A4 = 440Hz the tuning fork produced a 55Hz signal, which drove the four-pole 1650 RPM synchronous motor to which the A disc was mounted. [...] (The other discs were all gear-driven <b>off</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> one.) [...] Incoming audio was amplified to feed a long neon tube common to all 12 discs. Wind instrument repair people liked this tuner because it needed no adjustment to show different notes. [...] Anyone who had to move this tuner around was less inclined to like it because of its size and weight: two record-player-sized cases of 30-40 pounds each.|$|E
2500|$|In 1984, Martin Peng of ORNL {{proposed}} an alternate {{arrangement of the}} magnet coils that would greatly reduce the aspect ratio while avoiding the erosion issues of the compact tokamak: a Spherical tokamak. Instead of wiring each magnet coil separately, he proposed using a single large conductor in the center, and wiring the magnets as half-rings <b>off</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> conductor. What was once a series of individual rings passing {{through the hole in}} the center of the reactor was reduced to a single post, allowing for aspect ratios as low as 1.2. The ST concept appeared to represent an enormous advance in tokamak design. However, it was being proposed during a period when US fusion research budgets were being dramatically scaled back. ORNL was provided with funds to develop a suitable central column built out of a high-strength copper alloy called [...] "Glidcop". However, they were unable to secure funding to build a demonstration machine, [...] "STX". Failing to build an ST at ORNL, Peng began a worldwide effort to interest other teams in the ST concept and get a test machine built. One way to do this quickly would be to convert a spheromak machine to the Spherical tokamak layout. Peng's advocacy also caught the interest of Derek Robinson, of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority fusion center at Culham. Robinson was able to gather together a team and secure funding on the order of 100,000 pounds to build an experimental machine, the Small Tight Aspect Ratio Tokamak, or START. Several parts of the machine were recycled from earlier projects, while others were loaned from other labs, including a 40 keV neutral beam injector from ORNL. Construction of START began in 1990, it was assembled rapidly and started operation in January 1991.|$|E
