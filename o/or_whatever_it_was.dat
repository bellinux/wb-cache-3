500|$|Bruce, a boyhood fan of Newcastle United, {{claims to}} have sneaked into St James' Park without paying to watch the team play, saying [...] "I {{have always been a}} Newcastle lad and when I was a kid, I crawled under the {{turnstiles}} to get in to try and save a bob <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was.</b> They were my team, I went to support them as a boy and being a Geordie it's in-bred, you follow the club still the same today." [...] Like several other future professionals from the area, he played football for Wallsend Boys Club. He was also selected for the Newcastle Schools representative team, and at the age of 13 was among a group of players from the team selected to serve as ball boys at the 1974 Football League Cup Final at Wembley Stadium.|$|E
2500|$|A common myth {{about this}} story is that the colour-separation overlay (CSO) {{backgrounds}} were accidentally omitted {{in some of the}} car interior scenes, leaving the blue screen behind the characters. In reality, the blue is supposed to represent the sky. The differing shades of blue compared to the location exterior footage {{is the result of the}} shots' separate origins. This is contradicted by Paul Vanezis in an interview, in which he states [...] "I wouldn't put a background in and I'll tell you why they didn't put a background in there - it wasn't lit properly. There wasn't enough blue in it to key it, or yellow or green <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was.</b> It was shot wrong. It shouldn't have been shot in the studio and it shouldn't have been shot on xchrome. These days with modern technology you could easily key it... easily, but it wouldn't look right." ...|$|E
60|$|They listened, but the cry, <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> was not repeated. Soon {{they were}} back {{to the side of}} the {{houseboat}} once more.|$|E
60|$|DOLLY. Oh, Crampstones, <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> He said I {{was like}} his mother. I knew he must mean his daughter.|$|R

6000|$|... "Before his accident, <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{that made}} him lose his memory, he was an unusual man, a man of {{exceptional}} ability. You know that." ...|$|E
6000|$|The boy, with {{a return}} of that former {{reluctance}} or struggle <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> seemed to debate with himself. At length he said, raising {{his eyes to the}} master's face: ...|$|E
6000|$|Britt went on musingly. [...] "One {{night as}} I sat between Viola and the closed piano, the spook, <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> {{ran up and}} down the keys--now on the treble, now on the bass--keeping time to my whistling." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; {{and them}} {{that has the}} best fruit, or cows, <b>or</b> butter, <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> they gets a premium," [...] said Sam, {{chopping}} away.|$|R
6000|$|... "All right. Send {{the head}} of this post, or fort, <b>or</b> village, <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> aboard, and make what {{arrangements}} you can for your men." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Not if {{they come}} from the North, madam,' said the Jesuit. 'And do not all your Irish reapers belong to that dreadful Land League, <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> called?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At {{any rate}} the vision or reflection, <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> startled {{me so much}} that I {{came to a halt}} under the lee of one of the monoliths, and found myself unable even to call to the distraught man whom I pursued.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not so. The {{superintendent}} would fix {{the hours}} o' wark, an' {{they would all}} write, <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> thegither in one large room. Man, man, it would mak a grand draw for a painter-chield, that room, wi' all the geniuses working awa' thegither." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know it," [...] said Mary. [...] "And you've {{been very}} foolish. I hope you didn't {{find what you}} wanted not to find, or get off at the station where there wasn't any, <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> you {{expected}} wouldn't happen to you during the three years you've been away." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{very much}} fear," [...] {{he said to}} Captain Millet, after {{inspecting}} his patient, [...] "that the poor fellow has received some bad internal injuries. The mast, <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> must have struck him a tremendous blow, for his side is severely bruised, {{and two of his}} ribs are broken." ...|$|E
6000|$|First comes Easter, pagan {{goddess of}} spring. Here his fancy may have free play. A {{beautiful}} maiden with decorative {{hair and the}} proper number of toes will fill the bill.

6000|$|... "The {{chief officer}} ordered {{a good many}} of the sails to be taken in, for they were only uselessly {{straining}} the masts, but there were enough left to move her in case the power of the current, <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> that stopped her, had slackened, and she steadily kept her position with the breeze abaft.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Nickleby,' said Sir Mulberry Hawk, {{in a thick}} coarse voice, 'take the hint, and tack it on {{the other}} five-and-twenty, <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> and give me half for the advice.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't like it," [...] he remarked, {{when he had}} finished; [...] "don't like it at all. Take my advice, Philip; {{send him}} his box, <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> and don't go." ...|$|R

60|$|George {{looked at}} her, startled. He had hardly {{been aware of}} her {{presence}} till now. Rapidly he diagnosed her as a mother--or aunt. She looked more like an aunt. Of course, it must seem odd to her, his charging in like this, a perfect stranger, and beginning to chat with her daughter, or niece, <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was.</b> He began to justify himself.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{knew that}} the {{invisible}} dog, <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> could not get in unless the door was open. I had frequently noticed that when he entered a room it was through an open door, and I sometimes knew of his approach by seeing an unlatched door open without visible cause; so, feeling secure for the present, I lay and gasped and panted.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, a {{very curious}} coincidence," [...] he continued, {{with the same}} knowing look. [...] "Of course, you are aware that your cousin Everard King was the next heir to the estates. Now, {{if it had been}} you instead of him who had been torn to pieces by this tiger, <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> then of course he would have been Lord Southerton at the present moment." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh no," [...] said he. [...] "There {{is nothing}} regular or exact in nature; even our earth {{is not a}} perfect sphere. Nature is never mathematically correct. You must always allow for variations. In {{some parts of the}} earth its heated core, <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> must be very, very far down." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no, sir," [...] {{the officer}} said. [...] "The priest <b>or</b> woman, <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> begged {{me to keep}} it, and I don't even know that it belongs to you; what do you say, major?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I implore {{you to be}} quiet, Captain De Stancy! Leave me, {{and look}} {{out of the window}} at the view here, or at the pictures, or at the armour, <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> we are come to see.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{shall have}} my entire confidence, Spencer," [...] Duncombe declared. [...] "The man {{who called himself}} Fielding was badly wounded, and he passed here almost unconscious. He {{entrusted}} the paper or letter, <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> he stole from Von Rothe's messenger, to his so-called daughter, and she in her turn {{passed it on to}} me. It is at this moment in my possession." ...|$|E
60|$|At {{last the}} form reappeared, {{crouched}} lower than ever, {{so that it}} was almost hidden by the rocks and low brushwood leading to the jungle. At first Dick imagined the beast, <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> was going to retreat to the timber, but soon it appeared to turn back, as if to make another semicircle, this time around {{to the rear of the}} house.|$|E
60|$|It was a {{long night}} for both of the boys. They took turns at resting and at {{replenishing}} the fire, and it is doubtful if either of them got much real sleep. Once, in the early morning, came an alarm, and Fred imagined a bear was in the bushes. But the animal, <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> soon went away, {{and that was the}} end of the disturbance.|$|E
6000|$|Young Morland {{clutched}} his hair. [...] "Everyone's {{in the same}} boat, but it can't last for ever; and now we're engaged we can be together all the time till I've got the licence <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> And then--!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; {{only between}} the first and second walls, and once between the second and third. The old temple, <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> is on the top, and into that they would never admit us. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> there that the {{treasure}} lies." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It strikes me," [...] I said, [...] "that <b>it</b> would <b>be</b> a {{good idea}} to put on that bay rum, <b>or</b> cologne, <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> with a clean paint-brush, or {{something}} of the kind. Don't you dislike using your fingers?" ...|$|R
